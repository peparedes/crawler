"event","So I am more than certain I have found the love of my life. She makes me feel better when I'm around her. I miss her and think about her every second when I'm away from her. No body has ever made me smile as much in my entire life. These last few months have been amazing. I'm so glad I found her. I just want to spend every second with my beautiful Ty Marie =) 

Although today she was kinda distant... but then again I felt kind distant too. Maybe its the cold that we both have... its probably nothing to worry about"

"event","I feel rather tired lately. That dream world state where you think things are happening but then again it might not be happening, but in all actuality it is happening. Insomnia! its really besting me. You feel like the living dead, everything around you moves at lightspeed, zoom, zoom, zoom you forget, you remember, you forget a again, you forget that you were thinking about that thing. Just one endless day of compacted material trash of the unimportance. the only things you remember are pointless and get you nowhere. You lose yourself you find yourself over and over. You feel like an empty sheel, a void, wasted space and for what a little a lack of sleep. HOw ridiculous, is it? Simply put there is no measurement. You feel the grip of reality slowly slipping, blurring everything into your subconscious thinking things happened but maybe you dreamed it awake? Day-dreaming? No. Dreaming the day, yes. Is this really real? I need a fucking drink someone get my something to drink. Alcohol seems to be a logical answer for things now. I turn to it to ease this fictional mess. A fucking blur, i need more alcohol damn it. Helps me sleep, one bottle? no I'll take two.  

I'm pretty lonely too, i really need to get a girlfriend to occupy time, thats sounds bad but I mean it completely innocently. I need someone to really talk to thats all."

I've failed a lot i failed myself mostly. do you know whats worse than failing your self? absolutely nothing! for the first time in my life i regret what i have done in the past. i regret where i'm at in life right now. I'm nothing a nobody. So i have to pick which road i shall take from here. which will be get my shit togather and fix my mistakes that can be fixed and for the one that can't... I'm sorry. 

I'm sorry i left you
i should be holding your hand
as we stroll across the land
laughing and talking of the goodtimes
forgetting about all the bad times
kissing your cheek to let you know i care
kissing your lips to show how much i care
losing myself for hours in your lovely eyes
being there to hold you when you cry
giving me a reason for why i should never die
giving me a reason to wake up everyday

i'm sorry to everyone i failed"

"event","Its been a while. Many many things have happened since I last posted. For Example i moved to the Seattle, WA area, got a job, went back to school, made friends with punk kids, oh and i just recently bought a car. I don't feel like filling in the blanks because other than those few events i haven't done much over here. I miss my friends a lot but I don't want to go back to the black hole that is Peoria, IL there was nothing for me to further my interests and goals there. So i did the only reasonable thing, I left. I don't regret it either. I like living in this town it has this atmosphere which you don't feel so uptight, its very weird. I like the people, I like the scenery, i like the fucking rain. The only thing i don't like is that i haven't gotten laid and after have a year of nothing it kinda gets to you for those of you who know what i mean. well bonjour everyone. peace and love.

It seems like they have gotten soft from what i remember. I'm tired that there are people half assing work around there pretending that they are part of the program, and there only making it seem like they are because the picked up one little thing and say that they bult the set..... i wonder who that could be.... take an easy guess... i also am pissed that some people 2 in particular think they can show up late or whenever they want and not get repremanded for it..... anyone that reads this and is or was in the theatre program should know who i'm taking about and if not i will tell you its really easy to guess though... so since i tried to be nice about it and it just seems like its not going to change i'm going to take some action and show the light to those who need to be informed more closely on whats happening, because i'm tired of busting my own ass just to see some punk retarded ass teenage acting kids take credit for things that i have done and other have done and they didn't. i hear by salute you dumb lazy fucking bastards that call yourselfs actors or stage crew that can't really hack it in this world with my middle finger. i'm not carrying your fat lazy wannabe theatre major punk asses anymore. fuck you."

"event","As i stand back and watch as friends and others i associate with, that i rather would not want to associate with, i realize that they all seem a little scared about whats going to happen. i'm not maybe its from all the let downs that i have already gone through which got me to the place i live now and the people i know. Being an army brat isn't a fun life and i wouldn't wish it upon anyone. besides that i don't understand why people try to get close with each other, esp. now since everyone is moving on with there lives and watching the lives around them move on to other things. Sure its nice that you MAY see the person in a few years but seriously....how much would you have in common then since many of those people change who they are and what they stand for so often now. and there are a few exceptions there are people that you don't even have to try to get to know or make an effort to be friends with...those are really the only people that are going to care what you do and how you do it now and later on in life. Really i couldn't be critized about this because lets face it i have lost more feeling and friends and loved ones and memories than anyone i know, everyone pretty much knows what its like to grow up in a place for more than 5 years at a time, that number is just an example its usually a lot more than that. I never had that and i'm finding out that i'm going to have to move again in maybe the next year or 2 only to have more memories loved ones and friends to never see again..... maybe thats why i'm so callous and cold lately or maybe it just people not really being themselves i don't know.

"event","i have come to realize something just about 15 mins ago. now i'm really fucking pissed off, i can't say why but i am really fucking pissed at 2 people. thats really all you need to know.

i need to start a fucking band, third time is not a charm. fuck maybe i should just quit playing music, i barely play anymore, so i'm making no progress at getting better. The last time i tried to start a band it flopped in my face cuz i wasn't playing enough then either, so i wasn't getting the music down, i got the music pretty much down now, but its a little too late, besides i don't think skyler liked my guitar playing either, oh well. its hard to go from one type of music that your so used to playing to another thats so much different, just a warning to those about to change music styles. but i thought it over and i don't want to do what norm and skyler want me to do i don't want to sing and play guitar at the same time i just want one or the other, its hard to play technical stuff and sing at the same time.

i can't sleep now i'm depressed about the band situation

i want to do nothing but play music for the rest of my life, i would literally drop everything just to play music on stage all the time til i die"

"event","yesterday was a pretty good day saw v for vendetta after working at the pac for about 5 hrs that kinda sucked but it happens. v for vendetta was good but i thought that it was pretty funny how pretty much everyone thought the whole movie was a statement about our country and what kind of people we were. i don't really know how such a conclusion could have came about from a movie but i'm pretty sure that none of the people that watched the movie would have the perverbial balls to actually do anything extreme enough, because what they have not yet realized is that, they themselves are as scared as everyone else, to say anything about whats going on now. we all complain i do the least of it on our country cuz right now i can't so anything about it. so i dodn't need to say much.

in spite of all of that i have also realized something that i will be hounded upon for, because it is going to thought of as a lie, and there going to say how could you have some up with such a hasty conclusion about us. well you see last night i realized something i should have realized a while back. the things that most of you try so hard not to be...you really are that thing that you try not to be, sheep in a field grazing with the other sheep. sometimes a state of mind will cloud you from what really is true from what is really false. and this is not a such a hasty conclusion this has formulated over a period of time that i have known most of you, i see and hear a little more than what you think i do."

"event","so opening night for the play went off without a hitch, thank mother fucking god. i don't think people understand what was running through my head. i was fucking watching the play with nothing on my mind but please dont fuck up, please dont fuck up. i was so fucking nervous, but luckly nothing bad happened. woo feels like 500 pounds of weights were just lifted off my chest.

so i was reading a friend of mines livejournal there. and he noted that he hates racists and other things that tie to that. and some random person replied to him and is of southern decent but still thinks that the confederate heritage is still with them? shit the confederate shit died with the civil war. its like black people still claiming that they are still slaves and should be compensated for it even though there not. i'm sorry but history books are made for a fucking reason people. get all that this is my heraitage shit out of your heads and just fucking live you own god damn life and not dwell on a past happenings of ""your people"" (that applies to every mother fucker that is living) because you didn't fucking experiance it so why the fuck should you claim it? my point is all that shit that happened before is irrelevant to you so don't bother calling yourself something that you are not. you make yourself what you are in the end not your past.

also the on mystery person also wrote that ""your generation needs to figure it out, needs to be kind..."" and someother horse shit. fuck that i'm kind enough as it i would give my fucking life for a friend. i do so much shit for so many people that its not even funny. because not even a fifth of the time i get any favors done for me, i don't fucking complain. and figure it out, figure what out? how to live forever? the fountain of youth? the meaning of life? seriously if your gonna say something that is generalized about someones generation you need to finsih what the fuck your trying to say. you can't ask a question or make a statement that has no ending because iot means your too fucking stupid to make something logical out of something that doesn't exist. besides i can't be classified as part of a generation because i don't believe in all that shit in the first place. sorry i think i may have been a little harsh about that shit but i hate it when people classify others in a group. and that has a reason all its own. well since i have time i'm gonna write about it.

racism started because people were classified into a group. discrimanation came about because people were placed in a group. hate was brought about because people classified others in a group. do you get what i'm trying to say. i'm done  if you don't get what i mean then you need some serious help or something.

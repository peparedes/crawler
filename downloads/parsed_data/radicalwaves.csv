The greatest thing about Halloween that hardly anyone even takes advantage of is it's the one time of year that you can be someone or something else for a night.  Tons of people dress up as something or other but it's rare to find someone who really becomes that thing, that character.  But I guess a lot of people like to play dress up and that's all they need to feel like they're celebrating.  But for me there's no point in putting on the penguin costume if I'm just going to walk around like I would any other day.  It's so much more fun and rewarding to play the part.  And people recognize it.  They see you as that character and not just a fancy get up or a clever statement without any substance.  Anyone can wear a penguin costume, but not many would choose to be a penguin for a night.

The funny thing to me is a good portion of people thought I was Happy Feet.  But I never saw the movie and I really wasn't trying to be some famous dancing penguin.  But people are funny.

Some other costumes (I mostly only saw people's feet):
A half-court game of beruit (a good example of playing the part)
Sherman Tank
droves of females in skimpy outfits (lots of girls just want to be scandalously clad without the repercussions for a night)
Chicken
lots of made-up combinations of clothing"

So some lyrics.  That's why I started this thing.



[no title]

I want to but I can't be with you
(Oh no) I'm not strong enough
For this

I walk alone on my path
This heavy burden breaks my back
Whoa

I found you on my way
You held me tight and I thought
You'd stay



I know I need to find myself
I want to belong here
Again

You thought that I was using you
(I was) But I didn't mean to
Oh no

You took me when I was down
I knew it could not last too long
Like this

--------------------------------

I am all on my own now
But that doesn't keep my 
Bleeding heart from wanting you

It sucks that our paths don't align
And now you're gone
And I'm still looking for love"

V:
Why won't you see me
Why won't you come here
I just need to tell you
That I loved you
On the first day we met
And every day since

Why won't you speak to me
Why won't you laugh at me
Why can't I see you
Why can't I hear you
Are you even there
Behind the drapes

When can I hold you
When can I kiss you
When will you hug me
When will you tell me
That I've gone insane

V:
I want this to reach you
I want this to touch you 
Would you tell me it's good
Would you hear it again
Your silhouette is fading
Into the darkness

Please don't betray me
Please don't ignore me
If you leave me here
Outside in the rain
I don't think I'll make it
On my own

When can I hold you
When can I kiss you
When will you hug me
When will you tell me
That I've gone insane

Ch:
Confiscating this reality
Turning it upside down
The poison sets in, our minds are so numb
Paralyzed tempest, together we suffer
A bump in the road, morphing our fate

Interlude

Bridge:  
Even if we never discuss again the quirks of the world
I'll never forget the moments we share or the way you make me feel
You've lit the candle that guides my feet today
Without you I'd be stuck uninspired sitting here alone
The life you've lived is twice as big as any other
You've conquered the world that needed you 
And now it's time for you to move on

Met a girl, forgot her name.  She was beautiful and I gave her lots of headgasms with Brenna's head massager (that thing is priceless).  She asked for my number and said she'd call the next time she visited santa cruz.

Thought about her once in a long while, figured she wouldn't call and I'd never see her.

Saw her at Inn of the Beginning last night, she probably didn't recognize me or want to.

"event","This past week, at least 15 people said they hate me.  You will too as you read on.  

My roommate said he doesn't hate me, he just envies me...and he said it's too bad all we have are butter knives...

So instead of this whole idea of ""finals"", my professors have collectively agreed (possibly via thetawave transmissions) that they will give me one 3-5 page paper to write for each class, with the last one due on the first day of finals week.  So what does this mean?  No tests, no studying, no nonsense.  It means more bullshit than a bull can shit.  It means I'm already done with the first two, and one due in three days.  I'd say I have it pretty good.  

That's why people hate me.  But.  They don't know a few things.  First of all, the grade in one of my classes is based solely on two take home papers (one of which is due monday) and one in-class short essay exam.  So at least 1/3 of my grade is based on what i write this weekend.  Second of all, I've been writing papers all quarter long.  I've written at least 25 papers, with an average length of 3 pages.  about 8 of those were only a page long and were busy work type things.  Thirdly, yes, I'll be done with academics for this quarter on monday.  But.  I have to stick around until the next sunday june 18th because I have to work the graduation ceremony.  this means I'll either be bored out of my mind or drunk out of my mind for the 4 days between monday and saturday of next week.  maybe that's a good thing, maybe it's not something to envy.  Fourthly, this whole week I've progressively gotten more sick, with my lymph nodes now swollen to roughly 75-90% the size of golf balls.  The one on the left is the same size around as a golf ball, but i'm guessing it's not as big depthwize.  These nodes have been causing considerable discomfort in my jaw, ears, and head.  I went to the doc today and all he could tell me is it's not strep (damn it would be gone in 3 days if it was), and that I should gargle salt water.  He prescribed 12 5mg vicodins to help me sleep, since the past two nights have witnessed me taking 2 ibuprofen every 4 hours, which means waking up in the middle of the night at least once, wincing in agony.  Oh yeah, and 10mg of vicodin and 2 ibuprofen did little to keep me asleep for longer than an hour and a half, with the nagging, throbbing pain (not discomfort, pain) of my new best friend who lives to the left of my tongue in the basement of my mouth, giving me a wakeup call.  I call him Freddy.  

So perhaps you won't hate me, because would you rather trade your finals for at least a week of physical misery?  I suppose it's a toss up.  There are drugs for physical misery, but not for finals.

The good thing about test finals is that they take less time, usually, than writing a paper.  well, maybe that's because I haven't ever studied longer than 30 minutes for a final.  That's why they pay me the big bucks  and give me the good grades.  Okay, you can hate me for that.  But I'll take it as envy."

I missed all the ""fun"" we reportedly had that night.  Somehow the three amigos all made it outside for a vomit session, and John says he pulled us back in.  They say I took 14 shots, which is really too much in a period of 2 hours.  Apparently I spilled some beer on a girl, felt really bad for it, and offered her $3 as compensation.  I guess she didn't take it because I still had a 5 and 3 ones in my wallet.

Saturday:  wake up at 10 still drunk, pass out at noon, wake up at 5:30 hungover like no other, go to work at 7pm.  I didn't get off work until 12:30.  Fucking MeCHa conference bullshit.  They broke a table and blew out a speaker.  Talked to people after the event, passed out in my bed, my head and stomach still throbbing from the effects of the drunken stupor (see above).

Sunday:  wake up at 11, feeling somewhat refreshed, go to work (more fucking MeCHa conference bullshit) at 1:30, eat a sandwich that doesn't get digested for a few hours (one after effect of the drunken stupor that I still haven't gotten rid of by tonight).  I got off work at 5, went grocery shopping, bought a box (50% more!) of taquitos, return home and cook the salmon filet I just bought, and tristan and matt come over, to start the end of the birthday festivities.  They ate all of my taquitos.  Some more people come over, we have a grand old time.  Every one leaves except for Sarah and I ended up talking to her until 4:30 this morning... didn't fall asleep until 6.

Monday:  up at 8, asleep til 9, work at 9:30.  fucking unfunctional would be a good way to describe it.  

After a weekend of feeling hungover or drunk at all times, I look forward to my three weeks of self-imposed detox.  Too bad I'm going to miss the Cinco de Mayo fun."

"event","So last night Santa Cruz saw snow for the first time since 1972.  All the roads were covered in white, and the skies were being split by bolts of lightning and the dark clouds above kept crashing together and the enormous thunder would skate across the sky.  It was quite the amazing night, as far as the weather was concerned.  This afternoon when I got back on campus, there was still snow covering the parts of grass and street that hid from the sun that morning.  Very cool, indeed."

"event","so the busses ran all day yesterday, but not during the late 'night owl' hours.  the reason the man who put up a paper sign on the window gave me and the other two people who had been waiting with me for a bus for 25 minutes was that it was president's day.  actually, sir, it wasn't because president's day ends on the third monday of february one second after the clock reads 11:59:59 pm.  it was 12:30 when the dude put the sign on the window.  busses run until 2-3am.  the website for the metro center said their busses would run as normal on the holiday.  What a wonderful way to start the week."

"event","what the hell is up with random girls walking up to me when i'm eating alone in the dinning hall and asking me if i'd like to join them at their table?  i say that as if this has happened more than once, but no.  it was just so random, and i was really looking forward to wallowing in my own thoughts, not trying to engage with other people.  i enjoy being alone sometimes.  it lets me breathe, make sense of this crazy world.  but these santa cruz people never cease to amaze me in how open and outgoing they can be.  it's comforting, sure, but sometimes i just don't feel like talking.  i don't even know why it bothers me. 

okay whatever.  i'm over it.  

yay for the B-Side Players tomorrow night!"

"event","I.  Hate.  Typos in publications.  Bunches of monies go in to producing written work such as a college newspaper or even our beloved press democrat.  However, the level of professionalism is reduced to nil when something is misprinted for whatever reason.  The credibility of the paper gets thrown out the window, on the tail of said paper.  I'm not sure how someone can turn ""eleven"" into ""seven"" or ""the"" to ""a"", or ""2005"" to ""1995"", but it happens.  and it's really lame.  It bothers me that I have to correct in my head what the paper has printed unless I want to let myself acquire grammatically incorrect or statistically incorrect information.  What I hate almost as much as typos in publications are typos in their online representations, or other online journals that are backed by money.  I don't care if someone mispells a word on livejurnal.  It happens.  But if someone paid you to write journalism and you misuse or present false data, you should be thrown into a fiery pit of mutant alligators.  (only the surface of the water in which the alligators live would be on fire, so it wouldn't be THAT bad)"

so i thought i had 3 advil cold and sinus caplets left.  well, i know i did.  but i can't find them anywhere.  the rational thing to think is that someone ""borrowed"" them.  possible, but not probable.    

and an hour before this, i tried to burn some songs onto what i thought was a blank cd.  but it had raaandom songs already on it, including a Creedence song.  I don't know anyone that could have been in contact with that previously blank cd that has a creedence cd.  and there was a bunch of hip hop and reggae.  and some inspirational guy.  i pulled this cd off the bottom of my stack of 3 blanks, which came off the top of a pretty new stack of blanks that's in my home in santa rosa.  i don't have a rational answer to this one.  

so these two events combined with the flash of questionable schizophrenia makes three things in one weekend that say i'm crazy...freakin awesome.  the schizophrenia thing was partially self-manifested, but i could have sworn mei was saying something when in fact she had said nothing, a few times on friday.  but then one of us jokingly pointed out that maybe mei doesn't exist, that she's just a manifestation.  this triggered a similar numbing/sobering/sinking realization that that john guy in A Beautiful Mind experiences when he realizes that those fools were all in his head.  it was trippy as hell for me.  who needs drugs when you can mess with your own head?"

Sometimes myspace gets some sort of bad syndrome thing like Tourette's that just keeps shouting something about an error that's been sent to the tech department, and it doesn't let anything work except for the advertisements.  which is lame.  i understand that the guy who created it made or is still making a lot of money, but it makes the already-tedious-process of viewing a comment a fucking hassle.

Okay, here goes.

Excuse Song #1

I wrote you this song
So I wouldn't have to make the call
The letters I never wrote
Will never come between us
So what do you say
Let's just carry on this way

I haven't seen you in ages
So I don't think I can cope
If we wait for the time
When we can start from scratch
Things will be better
If we just carry on this way

This way we never have to concede defeat
We never need to whine and moan or fear the repeat
We're free to live our own lives far away
The ticket costs too much it's too much to pay
The seasons come and go leaving far too much pain
This is the only way I can live without going insane

I know I'm a flake
So you're not the one to blame
Your cards are forever
Your heart is divine but
We can't face the facts
And that's why we can't carry on this way"

Some parts are so over the top cheesy that they are genuinely funny.  The cinamatography is impeccable.  If you ever get a chance, see this movie.  I forgot the director's name, but I'm sure it wouldn't be too hard to find.  It's all in Japanese, except for a couple phrases like ""super mitt"" and ""super tornado"".  It's about high school baseball, and how the players finally find out that in the end, it takes teamwork and friendship to win.  But in the middle, there's a bunch of killing and fighting and stuff.  Very awesome.  If I had more than two thumbs, I'd put them up for this movie."

"event","Is King Kong a kid's movie or an adult's movie?  If it is the former, then it is the most violent, obscene, and boring kid's movie I've ever seen. If it is the latter, then it is the most straight-forward, simple, and boring adult's movie I've ever seen.  And the ""special"" effects were very noticable and they often took away from the flow and feeling that the movie sometimes had.  It was obvious that in 90 percent of the shots, all the actors were in front of a green screen.  The movie was entertaining once it got going, but the whole ""make the audience sympathize with Kong"" routine was rehashed, too drawn out, and unsurprising.  This movie was way too hollywood and not nearly creative enough for me.  The dialogue was boring and pointless.  What the hell does ""it wasn't the planes.  beauty killed the beast"" mean?  was it the beauty of humanity that was hunting the monkey?  or more literally, did naomi watts's radiant attractiveness stop the monkey's heart like an old man who dies of a heart attack while having sex with a skanky prostitute?  If Kong thought the girl was beautiful, then why would he slide off of the building and plunge to his death?  The movie even has old school techniques like playing footage behind live actors to make it look like they are really in some environment somewhere.  And as far as I can tell, all that the vast majority of the people who saw Kong knew about dinosaurs came from Jurassic Park.  So it made sense for the girl to lay still while the t-rex lost track of her.  And it made sense for the audience to tell the screen ""stop running!  they can't find you if you stop running!"".  But all the dinos were taken straight out of Jurassic Park:  T-rex (except Kong had 3 of them), your run-of-the-mill herbivorous brontasaurus herds, and hungry, vicious, and hungry velociraptors.  And the dinos sounded better, were scarier, and looked more realistic in Jurassic Park.  But it made sense for the dudes who make movies to put Jurassic Park-esque dinos in there so that their assumably ignorant audience would make the connection that they were in fact, dinosaurs, but they should have done something more interesting and told a different tale of how dinos might have lived, run, fed, etc.  But no, they didn't have enough money for innovation, i suppose.  They spent it on computers and graphics.  And why were dinosaurs even in the film?  they had no business living on that island.  I guess they just wanted something big to fight Kong to make him earn his keep as King of all things.  yet a group of tiny humans can trap him and somehow load him on their small, run-down boat and chug all the way back to NY without running out of chloroform.  and what does Kong eat?  dinos?  giant bananas?  leaves?  he would have to eat all day long to get enough energy just to fart.  And what was up with the human emotion they pumped through Kong's virtual veins?  He's a giant monkey.  people monkeynapped him and brought him to new york, then helped him commit suicide.  big deal.  we don't need to stare at his face and see his eyebrows move up and down and his eyes well up at the same strangely coincidental time as the girl's did.  and the girl finally figured out the giant monkeys don't speak english after trying to teach Kong how to say ""beautiful"" by slowly pronouncing it three times throughout the movie.  Now, I like Jack Black and what he does, and what he brings to a film.  But he wasn't the best actor for this role.  He brought too much modern flair to a role that is set in the 20's or 30's.  He rocked that hair, though.  The guy from the Pianist was good, but i liked that movie better.  After watching ""Dot the i"" last night, I was sorely disappointed by Kong.  I thought there was an interesting plot to follow as the film progressed, but I was wrong.  The ""intense"" scene where they were out of control and crashing in to rocks and stuff was really lame and ho-hum, simply because we didn't have any reason to want the characters to live through the experience.  I wouldn't have cared if they all died before setting foot on Skull Island.  We know that they find Kong, so we know that at least the main characters live on through the boat scene, so why did they even put it in there?  The movie was long enough without that part.  And why was so much emphasis put on making a film?  the characters supposedly shot hours of film, but the movie just sort of forgot about that part of the plot, which took up the entire first hour and a half of the movie.  and why was the writer dude so heroic?  that was random.  if anyone should have been the ""heroic one"", it should have been that dude who stowed away and reads ""heart of darkness"" all the time.  and what's up with the only black guy dying?  and that asian dude (there was only one) died too, a pretty helpless, silly death by the way.  and why would an abominable snowman make footprints on a rather tropical island?  the trailer tries to persuade us that this movie is at least worth seeing, to see a new version of an old classic.  but the only memorable part of the movie was the satisfied feeling i had after I ate half a box of delicious sour patch kids.  for a dollar fifty."

However, there are also people who intrigue me, amuse me, and generally make me smile.  Like Chase, who spent thanksgiving at disneyland with his family and decided to order pesto instead of a turkey dinner, which is what the other 30 something family members ordered.  Fucking awesome.  And vegetarians who have leopard print blankets and zebra print thongs.  Sexy, but confusing.  And middle school science teachers and 3rd grade teachers who live in communes up in the hills.  Trippy as fuck.  

People who have amazing singing voices, british, french, russian or german accents, and/or can play guitar or some other neat instrument have an easy path to the key to my soul.  I'm a sucker, it's true.  

Oh, and I'd like to say that blue-eyed brunettes rock my world.  

And best friends who become potheads aren't as cool as they were before, but they're much more entertaining to watch.

The judging eyes of people are nearly impossible to avoid.  So the key is to accept the judgements and continue on with life in a way that makes you happy.  Fuck what someone thinks about something that makes you happy.

Peace.  Pace.  Paix.

1.  Pre-game your own party.
2.  The best thing you can do is turn 21.
3.  ""Vintage medical instruments"" should never be sought after for use.
4.  Always be able to say ""at least I've got my health"".  That way, life doesn't totally suck.
5.  Producing a  bowl with a built in straw that connects to the bottom of it is a great idea for those of us who like to drink the milk after eating all the cereal.  too bad the bowl i have is plastic.
6.  You can't spell ""move on"" without the two o's in ""alcohol"".
7.  ""Faudra remplacer tous les 'pas de chance' par de l'intelligence"" - lamest attempt at an inspiring message ever, but since it's from a french song, it's alright.  It's a good, common sense idea, so it makes my list.
8.  Wash dishes to sober up.
9.  ""Auto response from ChosunGuy86: Great Idea #9:  Never date a girl that can bench more than you.  Especially if your bench max is 295lbs.""  Thank you, stevo."

I guess the answer to all these is that we're human.  which is to say that we have tender emotions, we make mistakes, we indulge too much, we want what we can't have, we envie those who have it, we drink too much and pass it off as a good time, we let ourselves be free now and again, but we cannot never completely free ourselves from what is normal to us.  We give too much of ourselves to other people when we think they want it.  We read into things far further than we should.  We compare our actions and those of the people around us to our own sets of judgements, usually handed down (or force-fed) to us by the hegemony that is our society.  I guess it's impossible to operate outside of some framework.  Perhaps that is the goal for life:  to break free of all framework, structure, or restraint.  


Innaresting.


Whoa, i just realized there's some discrepancy between my computer's clock and my alarm clock...must rectify this, in order for me to wake up at what really is ""9:30"", and not an hour later."

"event","Man, I can't wait to go home and record some guitar.  It's all boiling up inside.  I need to piece things together.  I need to get them down so i don't forget them.  I need to get some equipment for myself here in santa cruz.

Whoa.  The facebook is messed up.  They are trivializing all things good.  Their poster page includes these things i like:  Tool, pink floyd, the mars volta, green day (okay, i like their old stuff), amy lee, weezer, system of a down, jimi hendrix, neil young, thom yorke, barenaked ladies, red hot chili peppers, foo fighters, pearl jam, the beatles (okay, not a huge fan), the shawshank redemption (one of my favorite movies), monty python, tool again (who doesn't need more tool?), family guy, beer pong, and brooke burke (who doesn't like her?).  

The posters that i don't like at all are:  kissing the war goodbye, the O.C., trainspotting, david bowie, and the darkness.  

Perhaps the facebook just shows me posters of the bands i've listed...but then why would they show me the OC?  or the darkness, or trainspotting???  none of this makes any sense.  screw it all."

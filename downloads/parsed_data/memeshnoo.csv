"event","ya so another day in the boring life of hannah. I dont understand why does god hate me so much?
   Today my friend madeline came over, we went and saw stepford wives which was pretty good, kinda creepy but good. then my mom came and picked us up but when we got home she just startedd bitching me out and now i am grounded all week. i guess that could be a good thing cause now i have a reason to stay home and i dont feel like such a loser. but ya so that was my day and now i have to go clean the bathroom which sucks ass. but ya. thats all"

"event","OH MAN!! today was officially  the third day of summer and i still have acomplished nothing.
i had my dance recital tonight and laela and i were sitting there with this girl sabrina and we are playing lemons.
now i dont know if any of you remeber this game but we played it in like 5th grade. you know its like the
dirty version of mash. so we are sitting here playing lemons and there are all these little 5 and 6 year olds running around and i am writing...and suddenly i look up and there is this girl. she is prob 7 so ya she can read. and she is reading over my shoulder!!! and there are bad words!! like DICK and FUCK so this of course is not acceptable. so i look up...and she looks at me...and i look at my paper and at laela and then back at the girl and the girl looks at the paper and at laela and then at me. and stands there and continues to read my paper. and im like what the fuck!! this girl!! what is she doing?! and she is still standing there!!! 
 so finnaly this girl walks away and then this other girl comes up and sits next to me.... and i am just like what is this?! do i smell like food?! why are these girls drooling all over me?! so that is the mystery of my life....and i am pondering it as i get ready to go to bed. for yet another boring day of the life of hannah....if you feel like joining me....give me a call!!"

"event","It has been nearly two weeks since the wedding.  I am still a little down that that was the best night of my life and probably the prettiest I will ever look in my life!
Ah well!
We got my immigration card today and it is good for 5 year!  After that I am entitled to an Irish passport :)  The law had actually changed so I got 5 years instead of 1!!
I also checked stuff out online and from what I see I can change my US licence into an Australian one when we are down there and then change the Australian one into an Irish one back here, thus avoiding having to test again. 
I mean, I know I would pass...I can and do drive.  Both manual and automatic AND have had a full and clear licence since I was 16!!!
Oh well.....
Billy is off to Sweden on Sunday and will be working nights for two weeks, 4 days on, 3 days off and so on.  I am going to Brussels to hang with Silke and be lazy but try not to spend any money.
On September 2nd we are flying to the US and spending just over a month traveling around: Boston, D.C. Philly, VA, SC, FL, New Orleans, Chicago....should be good times.  Then on October 1st we will fly to HI!  And finally to Sydney on the 6th......
Crazy!
So excited!"

The wedding was fabulous, BEST night of my life, easily.  We're currently parked in an internet cafe in Cork pricing out our round the world trip and just applying for our Oz visas.  Now once we get approved, we will purchase the tickets and be off!!!!!
Crazy!
We will road trip the US east coast for a month or so and then spend a week in Honolulu and then head down to Oz to work and wander for 9 months.  We plan on doing some of Asia on the way back :)  Crazy and exciting!"

Very busy with wedding planning and stuff...booked a band, buying some decorations, helping people plan their trips.
Also working a shitload, and going to the gym 5 times a week.
Billy and I are hermits, never going out so we can save the money to pay for the wedding.  If we stick to our budget, then it will be paid for in two months.  Not so bad....but I do miss going out!
Hopefully Sam will come and visit in Feb or this Spring, so that will be nice.  Janet and Peter are giving me and Billy the Chalet for a weekend....sweet!

"event","So the long awaited update. And to be honest, so much time has passed now that I am not sad or upset or anything...and honestly, he has not been missed.
So Oktoberfest started as a weekend away for my birthday, the start day of Oktberfest with just me, Billy, Ross and Jiji.....a weekend away before we probably all ended up scattering to different countries.  Ross asked if his fb, i mean girlfriend, Corinne could come.  I said I had to think about it because it would change the group alot.  I got forced into inviting her because she attacked me and Jiji as not liking her.  I asked if she wanted to come, she told me no, she was busy September 22nd, mind you this was in August, but fair enough.  
We book our campsites, but by now it was too late for ross to book in with us so he booked a different place.  A few weeks before my birthday we find out that Corinne is coming, ross and her just forgot to tell us, and they are staying with her boss up there, but that it is good news because now we have seats in a tent for opening day.  Fair enough...that will be fun, but i am a little frustrated.  Ross had sent me an email bitiching me out early in the month telling me that we couldnt be friends if i didnt like corinne.  I never said I didnt like her, I was fine with her, but we were never going to be best friends.  However, admittedly this makes me not like her too much. But I try, ross was one of my best friends afterall.
Whatever, the two of them took the train to Munich and the three of us drove.  We all got up there on the Friday night, which also happened to be the night that Ireland was playing France in Rugby.  We made sure to leave super early to get to Munich in time to find a pub to watch the match in.  Now we are texting and calling ross and making plans to meet at the main station to go find a pub to watch the match.  we're supposed to meet at 7, we hustle to get into town because Billy is obviously dying to see this game!  We are there and we wait....and wait.....and wait.....ross keeps saying they are one their way and they know a place to go.  Finally the lovely couple shows up at 7:45 and Ross cops an attitude and asks if anyone really wants to see the game.  Billy nearly flipped then, but held it in.  After getting lost and Ross not really knowing where we were going, we finally got to the most packed pub I have ever been in, but we grabbed the last seats and settled down.  We'd had nothing to eat because those two were so late and I was fighting a cold, so not the best mood.  We got our beers, we intently watched the match, we all chatted a bit but the game was the focus.  At one point Ross got up to use the toilet and Corinne turned her back to all of us!!  This came out later that jiji and i were evil and we never talk to corinne and we ignore her. THE GIRL TURNED HER BACK TO ALL OF US as soon as Ross was gone.
We left after the match,we got to meet Robert that night, her boss who was getting us in.  We went back to crash so we could make sure to meet up with the crew for a breakfast before going to Oktoberfest.  The next morning we take their directions to get to the breakfast place, which were very bad directions, and eventually use my german to ask for REAL directions.  Despite that, we are waiting for them for nearly 45 minutes for breakfast.  Whatever, we all eat.  the Bill was 80 euros and billy passed down 60 to corinne who was paying and got NO CHANGE and we later found out she was keeping all the slips to get reimbursed anyways.  What the fuck.  She also ignores me and doesn't say happy birthday or anything.
As I had predicted earlier, when we go to get in cabs they stick us three in one and the rest in another.  By the time our cab gets to oktoberfest and we get to the tent we have seats in the tent is closed and we cant get in.  Everyone else is inside.  I get really upset!  I suggest to Ross that he come out and celebrate my birthday.  He calls me selfish and ungrateful.  Yes, I was very ungrateful to be stuck outside a tent.  He then calls and says we should stop complaining and just do whatever we would do if we werent there with them.  If we hadn't been sticking to their plans we would have been in a tent at 9am just holding seats...i nearly lost it over that one.  The days was so nice that all out door seats were packed too so we walked away from Oktoberfest and had a few beers in a bar.  I was pretty fucking upset....Ross said he would do his best to get us in at 5, when there is a change over.
At 4 he texts us to hurry down he can get us in. We hurry....we wait for almost 2 hours before a very apologetic Robert comes and does get us in.  We jump on him with joy, Billy kisses his bald head. i kiss him, jiji kisses him!  WOO HOO we're in, right?
No.
We sit down....2 hours later no beer!  When a few beers show up at Roberts end of the table he has everyone pass them down to us and is apologetic once again and says happy birthday.  Billy tries to pass money down to him, but Robert nicely says the first ones are on him....we say thank you, Corinne tells him to take the money since it isnt from her or ross.  Seriously?
Jiji and I have kinda given up on being drunk at this point, but the people watching is fucking awesome.  Those tents are incredible and despite all the shit of this visit, I really can't wait to go back next year.  
So the night continues....we all order beers, not enough show up but billy does get one.  However, a friend of Corinnes doesnt...she is only sitting two people away from me, but she tells him loudly that he should take billys beer since 'we don't deserve any beer.'  Yes, that would be a direct quote.  I was pretty shocked. But when I was forced to invite her back in august, i pretty much predicted this whole scenario.  Later we got a few beers down our end of the table, and Corinne muttered that we were being so rude because they had bought us a round and we didnt get them back.  She never bought us anything.
A woman came around with cigars and shit and when her and ross wanted stuff billy bought it for them, didnt hear her saying thank you.  
Later on when everyone was dancing Ross came up to Billy and told him that he wasn't going to ever talk to me and jiji again, but that billy was a sound guy so he would like to stay friends with him.  I had no idea what was being said at this point, but billy looked like he was going to punch the shit out of ross.  Billy told him to fuck off, but before he did that to tell jiji and me what he just said.  He had to get corinne by his side first, she told us to all fuck off and ross said he couldnt be friends with us anymore because of here.  We suddenly became very determined to sit there and finish our beers....i have never been that mad in my life.  Corinne told us also that we were fucking ungrateful and we better have fucking thanked Robert.....she didnt ask if we thanked him, which if you have read this whole thing we did profusely before!  I had to keep jiji from dumping a beer on her...they left before we did and I haven't seen him since.  Funny to note though, by the time we got home that Sunday night Ross and Corinne had deleted us both from their facebook friends list.  Billy reckons Corinne kept Ross drunk on the way home and held his hand while he deleted us in an internet cafe.

Whatever, my life is actually drama free....but some of you wanted the story!
So that was Oktoberfest....

I still need to put in a wedding in Ireland update.  That was a blast!! :D"

Funny how fast the summer is booked up.  Hopeing to go camping next weekend, then there is the fete de geneve through like the 12....the weekend after Corinne is back, and the weekend after that is seeing Silke again and then it is back to work.
I also need to get a new passport, like yesterday, mine has one spot for a stamp left....so I am going to go get a new one and change my name on Monday.  I can hold on to my old one until the new one comes in so that is good news.

Three days of work and it is off to Ireland....which is going to be an insane trip.  Then the weekend we are back Kenny may come down from the Netherlands to visit.  It would be nice to see him again!

i got my dad to download skype and he was so happy to see me...my new laptop has a built in webcam.....he thought it was so neat he immediately went out and bought himself a webcam so I can see the family.  My 61 year old dad is finally getting with it :)

Going to London this weekend...which is good, for many reasons, but one is i think i would go nuts without a break from here!  We leave for Ireland on Thursday too...YAY!  Getting to go `home` and to a wedding and i just need to find a dress....easier said than done though!

Nothing new really, just work and whatnot.  French is done, for now, until I sort myself out with a less intensive class.  I did love the fast progress with that intensive course though!"

Friday nigh went out for a few drinks with Ross, his gf Corinne, some of her friends, Billy and Jiji.  Good times, drunken times, and darts included!
Last night went out with Billy to go watch the Redsox v Yankees play....it was on at Pickwicks!! :)  Met up with my friend Geneva, from French class, and her husband Antonio and then another couple of their friends.  It was a lot of fun!  So glad we finally got to hang out outside of class, that girl rocks.
Corinne and Jiji came and met us there after their dinner at Heaven.  We stayed til they kicked us out and then went home with our plastic cup of beer!
Today heading to Ross` amazing balcony surrounded apartment for a BBQ and sun time.  SO excited!  I have been marinating meat since yesterday...should be delish!
This week I am single mom, besides the fact that I will miss Billy, it`ll be fun!"

"event","Billy and I were talking about poetry and I remembered how much I loved Robert Frost, among many others....
I think these are may favorite top three of his poems though.

Fire and Ice

Some say the world will end in fire,
Some say in ice.
From what I've tasted of desire
I hold with those who favour fire.
But if it had to perish twice,
I think I know enough of hate
To say that for destruction ice
Is also great
And would suffice. 


Mending Wall

Something there is that doesn't love a wall,
That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it
And spills the upper boulder in the sun,
And make gaps even two can pass abreast.
The work of hunters is another thing:
I have come after them and made repair
Where they have left not one stone on a stone,
But they would have the rabbit out of hiding,
To please the yelping dogs. The gaps I mean,
No one has seen them made or heard them made,
But at spring mending-time we find them there,
I let my neighbor know beyond the hill;
And on a day we meet to walk the line
And set the wall between us once again.
We keep the wall between us as we go.
To each the boulders that have fallen to each.
And some are loaves and some so nearly balls
We have to use a spell to make them balance:
""Stay where you are until our backs are turned!""
We wear our fingers rough with handling them.
Oh, just another kind of outdoor game,
One on a side. It comes to little more:
There where it is we do not need the wall:
He is all pine and I am apple orchard.
My apple trees will never get across
And eat the cones under his pines, I tell him.
He only says, ""Good fences make good neighbors.""
Spring is the mischief in me, and I wonder
If I could put a notion in his head:
""Why do they make good neighbors? Isn't it
Where there are cows? But here there are no cows.
Before I built a wall I'd ask to know
What I was walling in or walling out,
And to whom I was like to give offense.
Something there is that doesn't love a wall,
That wants it down."" I could say ""Elves"" to him,
But it's not elves exactly, and I'd rather
He said it for himself. I see him there,
Bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top
In each hand, like an old-stone savage armed.
He moves in darkness as it seems to me,
Not of woods only and the shade of trees.
He will not go behind his father's saying,
And he likes having thought of it so well
He says again, ""Good fences make good neighbors.""


THE ROAD NOT TAKEN

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;
Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,
And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.
I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I-
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference."

"event","YAY redsox :)  Would have been pissed if the expensive pitcher had let us down already this early in the season!
It is the first day of our four day easter weekend....mike was supposed to be gone today until april 30th, but he missed his flight so now he is around until tuesday, kinda a bit of a bummer for me and billy.  I do feel badly for mike though, that sucks, and he has no food since shops are closed!!
I wish I knew if the market was on tomorrow...kinda guessing no, but not sure.  I was off yesterday, so spent the day cleaning and doing laundry so place is nice and clean.
We sent my mom an easter centerpiece yesterday with same day delivery so she could use it tonight for her fishcakes dinner and also for family easter sunday night.  I know it was delivered because I got a confirmation email, but no one from home called me so i dunno....guess i expected my mom to call when she got it.  oh well.
i love that we have four days off, though I bet we get bored.....supposed to have a lazy dinner with ross tonight, we`ll probably go to the park for a puck about today once it gets a little warmer.  It is supposed to be like 66 each day for the next two days!  This will be sweet!!
We`ve got loads of groceries and stuff so we should be set for the weekend.....may do a picnic sunday if it is nice too....
Mike texted me and told me his boyfriend Ben is in town and they have a car, so maybe a day trip or two....not sure, felt kinda shit yesterday so will see how it goes.
I wish I was Brogs or Brooke and at the beach for Easter....if only we had a tent I bet Billy and I would have gone somewhere this weekend!!"

"event","Last night turned out to be really great fun.

Jiji was late getting here but we downed a rum and coke and made ones to go and headed out to meet Mike and Ben at Cafe de Paris....it is like Chez Ma Cuisine, but with amazingly awesome steak.  Good thing we had a reservation, because it still took us a half hour to get seated.  The waiter was funny and we were seated right next to two Italians, so it made for much chatting and laughing all night.  The food was so good, Jiji gave up meat for Lent so she just had salad and chips, but the waiter didn't even charge her! :)

After a nice long dinner we headed to Eamon's apartment for his going away party.  Only in Geneve do you go to someone's going away party when you just met him the night before in the pub :)  Corrine was there and she was the only other one we knew....met loads of cool new people and we just hung out and drank until 3am.  I actually met a guy from Simone's home town which was amusing, we go to talk about clubs and stuff.  Also met a cute ocuple who are die hard redsox fans.....so baseball talk is always good!  Around 3:30 the call was made to move to a club....I walked with them to the club but then just headed home to pass out.  
Was nicely tipsy.....went to bed and woke up without a hangover at 9, so good deal.

Billy himself was in the hotel bar until 2 apparently....so he is rough today, poor guy, but it is his own fault.  I miss him loads, seriously just want to get through this week....i do know it is going to be so busy and i will be exhausted for most of it, but I get to see him friday night! YAY

ok.....just doing laundry and cleaning today and doing some extra french.  When Kathleen gets back from Madrid I may go see a movie, but we'll see.  There's not much out that I Haven't seen so unless she wants to go see dreamgirls, i will just stay in and hopefully get to bed early!"

I talked to my friend Danny last night, the one that talks to Hilary Duff haha... I just remembered that there is a really cute girl that she's friends with... she used to be on her show... kind of ugly, but she's so hot now haha
So I told him her name, which is Lelaine or something... and just told him to hook me up with her, since I'm going back to Cali in December haha ... I hope not to have a gf by then :X 
Lately I've been attracted to the ""punk rockish type"" ... not the hardcore ones... can't explain it really... I can't stand the ones that don't take showers though... that's some nasty shit.

I wonder who I will see when I'm in Cali.. it's true when they say... time changes, love changes and best friends become strangers... it's sad, but true.

I'll stay at Danny's house...which is kind of far from all the people I would want to see... I'm becoming pretty distant with him too... Stephan, I barely talk to him and I used to stay at him house every day... and Dele haha damn I haven't heard from that nigga in a while. Shit does change. Is the Spunk still alive? Yes Sir!

I can't wait for my b-day... tattoo, a job :D AND A CAR !!! Freedom at last!!!

Too bad I can't buy a new car because my insurance would cost so much money... about 2500 a year... and my parents cannot afford that shit right now. 
Fuck those cockroaches.. they are bastards, just getting richer and richer.

I'm usually right about those kind of things. If you are going to a place where there are people you don't like and that make you unconfortable... then why bother? ...oh well... we will see what happens... I trust her, but I don't trust those guys, they are idiots.

My mom must be fucking bi-polar... I laugh at her so much hahaha I don't think she likes it... it's so funny when she gets scared for the smallest things... today she was listening to music, and the CD ended so it went to the next CD (which was one of mine) ... it started playing the intro and she turned around and she was sooooo freaked out and she made a weird noise HAHAHAHAHA I was cracking up.

nel profumo dei fiori;
e fu piena la stanza solitaria
di te, dei tuoi splendori.

In te rapito, al suon de la tua voce
lungamente sognai,
e de la terra ogni affanno, ogni croce
in quel giorno scordai.
Torna, caro ideal, torna un istante

in the scent from the flowers;
the lonely room was full of your radiance.

Entranced by you, at the sound of your voice 
I dreamed at length,
and all the world's distress and anguish 
I forgot that day.
Coma back, dear perfection, come back for a momoment
and smile on me again,
and from your face a new dawn
will shine upon me."

Forgive but don't forget, girl keep your head up
And when he tells you you ain't nothing don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you, you should leave him
Cause you don't need him
And I ain't tryin to gas ya up, I just call them how I see them
You know it makes me unhappy (what's that)
When dudes make babies, and leave a young mother to be a pappy
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women, do we hate our women?
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies, that make the babies
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up
I know you're fed up ladies, but keep your head up.




I need to get my own place and live by myself... oh man, I cannot wait... I wonder when that will happen. Probably next year, I thank God that my mom won't be home that much... since she will go to Cali a lot... YES! Party ;)
Life is k... nothing really interesting going on right now... I wonder if I will get along with those people at the new school. 
One of the girls I ""know"" from there is pretty nice... haven't met her yet, but she seems really cool.. and her name isssssssss     ---- camie :X

Anyway... I don't have anything better to write, later.

I just need something serious in my life. I feel like a fucking old man haha.

hey baby i got you
this is so real
can't you see da love and how i feel
even if i tripped and messed things up
we will get over rough times and makeup



I've known you for a long time
you can even tell what I'm doing while we talk on the phone
we started with a great friendship, you can tell I've grown
and we have a deep connection 
to me you are perfection
we have love and a real affection
this isn't none of that bullshit other guys told you
it isn't infatuation
we have a strong foundation
nothing can separate us
I love how we get in little fights about things we discuss
I dont get to see you very often
but when we chill we make love like we're soul mates
your ex can't stand us being together, that's what he hates
i'd kiss you all night long, holding you by my side
what should i do? i can't decide
i wanna be with you but this distance is makin me crazyyy
my vision is startin to go hazyyy
Baby i got you
ill never make you cry, it's true
you got faith in me, I got faith in you.

Fucking bitches... all these insurance companies are so fucking expensive... what if you don't have enough money? you can't drive a car because you can afford insurance?

fuck that shit, that's stupid.

These are few questions I found interesting :::


- Why do you need a driver's license to buy liquor when you can't drink and drive?

- Why isn't phonetic spelled the way it sounds?

- Why are there interstate highways in Hawaii?

- Why are there flotation devices under plane seats instead of parachutes?

- Why are cigarettes sold in gas stations when smoking is prohibited there?

- Do you need a silencer if you are going to shoot a mime?

- Have you ever imagined a world with no hypothetical situations?

- How does the guy who drives the snowplow get to work in the mornings?

- If 7-11 is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, why are there locks on the doors?

- If a cow laughed, would milk come out her nose?

- If nothing ever sticks to TEFLON, how do they make TEFLON stick to the pan?

- If you tied buttered toast to the back of a cat and dropped it from a height, what would happen?

- If you're in a vehicle going the speed of light, what happens when you turn on the headlights?

- Why do they put Braille dots on the keypad of the drive-up ATM?

- Why do we drive on parkways and park on driveways?

- Why is it that when you transport something by car, it's called a shipment, but when you transport something by ship, it's called cargo?

- You know that little indestructible black box that is used on planes, why can't they make the whole plane out of the same substance?

- Why is it that when you're driving and looking for an address, you turn down the volume on the radio?"

I exist in the depths of solitude
pondering my true goal
Trying to find peace of mindand still preserve my soul
CONSTANTLY yearning to be acceptedand from all receive respect
Never compromising but sometimes risky
and that is my only regret
A young heart with an old soul
how can there be peace
How can I be in the depths of solitude
when there are two inside of me
This Duo within me causes
the perfect opportunityto learn and live twice as fast
as those who accept simplicity"

How come we dont even talk no more,
and you dont even call no more.
We dont barely keep in touch at all,
and I dont even feel the same love when we hug no more.
And I heard it through the grape vine we even beefin now.
After all the years we been down,
aint no way no how, this bullshit can't be true.
We family and aint a damn thing changed, unless it's you


[Verse 1]
So young, so full of life in vibrant,
side by side wherever you was ridin' I went.
So close, almost on some Bonnie & Clyde shit.
When Ronnie died you was right by my side with a shoulder to cry on,
tissue to wipe my eyes, and a bucket to catch every tear I cried inside it.
You even had the same type of childhood I did.
Sometimes I just want to know why is it that you surcame to yours
and mine I survived it. You ran the streets, I 9 to 5'd it.
We grew up, grew apart, as time went by us,
then I blew up to both yours and mine surprises.
Now I feel a vibe I just cant describe it,
as much as your pride tries to hide it.
Your cold, your touch it's just like ice
in your eyes is the look of resenment
I can sense it, and I dont like it.


[Verse 2]
It was my dream at first to be on spittin' a verse
on my own album with a deal but shit got worse.
So I came out, I woulda killed a nigga first
before I let him disrespect me and check me over some worst.
Some bitch that I wasn't with, I would hit her then quit.
But you would pull a talk with her and tell her she was the shit.
I told you dont get involved in it, you was smokin the chron with her
comin' out of the bar with her stumblin half drunk
like y'all was husband and wife or somethin'.
But me catchin' you fuckin' other niggas musta hurt your pride or somethin'
cause you won't fuck at the mouth with people like you wanted with me,
when all I tried to do was show you that your bitch was shifty.
And ever since the fans and all the shit that I produced,
you actin' like I ain't your man and lyin' like she can't be loose.
But I am really your friend, I'm just tryin' to tell you the truth,
but dont hate the game or the player
cause the one that's changing is you.



[Verse 3]
You're only at the top cause my homie had to stop,
now we actin' like I gotta live only for the block.
And homies in the hood, only she be on the tube,
only gossip on the porch, get to speakin' on who.
Fools I used to rap with all expect magic
like my finger get to snappin' and *poof* it just happen.
But Proof is just actin out the party was stoned,
Shady made it so my babys ain't starvin' at home.
See the devil in you grin, since the ghetto we been friends,
whenever real intelligence thats forever till the end.
I be the hatred in your eyes and the satan in your lives
and wastin' my times with these snakes in disguise.
(How come) when you talk it's with bitter and spite,
and (How come) it's my fault for what you did with your life
and everytime I go to hear you and play you look away."

"event","... getting verbally abused is worse than getting physically harmed.

I can't take it anymore... this WHOLE day I've been fighting with my mom, over the stupidest shit. She's a fucking moron.. AAAAAAAAAAAH. I just want to hit something.

If I go crazy, it will be her fault. She's making me insane. 

She thinks she's always right... she fucking yells at me for something she did cuz she was clear is what she was saying. FUCK HER...FUUUUUUUUUCK.

How can I hate my mom ... when she's my mom... it just doesn't work...

She just has no respect for me... and she expects to get respect from me? haha that's a joke."

<P>I hate getting my hopes up... and stupid shit always happen... things never work out the way you want them to...</P>
<P>I need therapy haha, so much shit I need to get off my chest. Sometimes it builds up so much that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I reach a point where I can't really control myself, and I need to let it out through physical contact...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>I think it will be therapeutic to go to Italy in December... people I grew up with... that I can actually relate to... you know... friendly faces.</P>
<P>I can't wait for my best friend to come visit. </P>
<P>Family issues are the worse... I'm tired of it though... being away from home will help me get all my shit together, and I think I will be happier.</P>

Girls are def not worth it... When you have one you CAN live without one, but when you don't have one, you CANNOT live without one... pretty ironic.

People just don't take the time to get to know me. I have many bad things about my personality, but I also have great qualities... hey, nobody is perfect.

So I'm done with school and ready to leave for STL at the end of august :D.

Does anybody else have problems getting along with your mom? ... seriously, this is getting so fucking immature. I don't care if she has PMS or whatever.
She keeps holding a grudge at me for no reason... and today she left me at the mall for no reason.

SHE NEEDS TO STOP TAKING HER FUCKING ANGER OUT ON ME. Fuck. No wonder I'm so violent... I need to just get out of here."

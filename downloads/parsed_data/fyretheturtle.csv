"event","Today Tari went out to get me food today, she bought me more of the red floating balls that I like and 10 rosy red minnows... they were good. I showed my apprication by going into a feeding frenzy... They are not as large as the goldfish she used to give me, but she says these are healthier. She is nervous about something... she has been cleaning a lot. she messed up our room very badly, and one of her frogs died... I think she cried a bit, she wanted them to have babies to feed to me"

"event","Tari has been trying to to take pictures of me lately, but I have not been a good turtle. She is working hard on the plans for my enclouser. people keep giving me new ideas... I am thinking of going allong with them. 2 feet tall will be fine for the enclouser I think. but I am afaraid of growing out of it. 

wanna see more pictures of me?

"event","Hello all. I am Fyre, a Female common snapping turtle. I belong to <a href=http://www.livejournal.com/users/xaftertherain/>Xafthertherain</a> we live togather in her parents attic with 2 frogs, and a few fish tanks. Shh dont tell anyone but she soon plans to repace the fish with turtles or all different types, since I am very anti social. I am also very messy. I am getting old (one year and 4 months allready and very large, even if i am in a tank i out grew at birth) I may have to look for a new home soon if Rain can't get her parents to let her house me in the yard. 

well thats all for my first entry. Laters all. I have to make a cool icon!"

"event","More than just a little weary these days. Work has been all too consuming of late, the only consolation at this point seems to be the fact end is nigh. I will oh so happy to be done with this project, although I'm concerned that when I'm done here they are going to drop me into the Urbz team.  I don't like the very notion of the game, and I sure the hell don't want to work on it. They need modelers however, and being one of the few available people on this side of the building that know 3DSMax, I'm a resource thats ripe to be shifted around. Frankly it pisses me off, it is not nice to work so hard for so long on one project, just to be dropped into the fire on the next one. This has happened to 3 of the 4 titles I've worked on now.

Friday night we had the going away party for one of my favorite people, Wombat. For a middle aged guy with a wife and kids, he is one of the coolest people I know. Wombat is a renaissance man who manages to be extremely funny in a dry cynical way, well read, well traveled, well opinioned, and a connoiseur of life. So he is off to Montreal and I will likely never get to see him again, it has been a fun ride and I'm going to miss him.

Saturday was a work day, fuck all to talk about there.

Sunday was Kevin and Suzanne's wedding. It was an enjoyable experience, a beautiful day at Mills college. The crowd was mixed between the normal stuffy sort you find at any wedding, and the eclectic crowd comprised of people from the local art scene and Burning Man. The first time I've ever had Indian food at a wedding, it was a perfect choice."

"event","It has been a hard last few years, I simply can't find the words. The entirety of that pain can be distilled down to one simple statement, I don't care. My ability and capacity to care right now may be of some debate as it has been a sword more than one person has impaled themself on by now.

Daddy touched you? I don't care.
Daddy never touched you? I don't care.
Your mother didn't like you? I don't care.
You lost your favorite blankie in a fire 15 years ago? I don't care.
You don't like the way you look? I don't care.
You don't like the way I look? I don't care.
You don't believe me when I tell you how I feel? I don't care.
You are unable to control yourself or your emotions? I don't care.

Because I don't care I can cut hard and deep, I can cut at myself, take things away. I can feel the pain, but I don't care. Survival mode, I can saw off my foot with a rusty spoon, because I can't really feel it. It is only a metaphor, I loathe the idea of actually cutting or hurting myself in a physical manner.

When Jen died I was alone, alone with myself. Someone who is hurting and feels guilty, shouldn't be alone with themself and people try to be there. If you will it, and I did, you can be alone. Nobody is harsher, or more relentless. You can see the truth in yourself, and pick at it until it bleeds crimson. You can cut and scratch and claw at yourself from the inside into a creshendo of pain, angst and rage. If you lose that fight, your neighbors get a chance to go on television and say ""I never saw it coming! He was such a nice guy.""

I am not there anymore. How I got here, alive, is thanks only to the love of my family. There for me, even if they were a world away. How I got here was turning that scrap of goodness, the only one I could summon with any might, and use it to beat down the feelings until I couldn't feel anything at all. I had become comfortably numb. Detached from my feelings. I stopped caring. I turned cold. It was never quite iron clad, more to the notion of when you are just so sore you stop feeling it. A poke or a prod can bring the pain back into frightening clarity. I lived this way for a while. In the human experience, I feel grateful for the brevity of my stay. That is where the problem lies, I could check out, but could I ever leave?

2 years later, I'm still living with it. I've been with 3 women since, and each has run up against my walls, hard. Each has seen in my past what I am capable of as far as being a loving and nurturing human being, each has been stung hard by it. I'm not innocent, I'm not guilty, but I have played a part that has hurt people I've never wanted to harm. In truth, my only defense is that I didn't want to. 

I am not your white knight.
I will not slay your dragon.
I will not prop your self esteem.
I will not comfort you from your own mistakes.
I will not give you more consideration than I give myself.
I do not want your help or your gifts.
I do not need you, I only want you if you do not need me.
I will not protect you from your past.
I will not protect you from yourself.
I am not your salvation.

While I may not be a white knight, I am no black night. I'm clad in old steel, rusty in places, worn smooth and shiny in others. Full of dents and scratches, but still bearing the mark of some higher craftsman (the love of my family). I will not slay your dragons and in turn I will defend myself to the death.

This has left me for the most part alone, by choice. The only person within my inner circle is Nicki, and she is there because I respect her for who she is. People who don't know her often do not like her. She is uncomfortable, full of uncomfortable feelings and thoughts you don't want to deal with. She is as cold as I have become, yet still burns hot. She challenges you, and if you accept that challenge you realize she is forcing you to challenge yourself. Holding you responsible for yourself and your actions. There is a fierce loyalty at play, and there is a very deep and strong sense of morality that I've only ever seen equaled in my mother. She is a tempest in a tea-kettle. If you don't know her and think you do, then fuck you, you haven't got a clue.

I've changed on my own accord. I'm not her bitch, and she isn't mine. You can't meet me now and tell me she changed me. You can't tell me who I am, or was, fuck you for presuming to try.

I'm leaving this post screened. I'll read responses but never unscreen them, so please unload on me. I also am not going to run spellcheck on it, because if you measure my intelligence on my ability to spell, who is the one being stupid?"

"event","Not really news anymore, but old Dutch is pushing up daisies. Originally I reacted to the news with sadness, then the fucking theatrics set in. Ronnie is teaching us yet another lesson, how you can be a bastard towards people in life, but if you work it right they will kiss your ass in death as the second coming of Christ. I hate post obitum sanctification more than just about anything, and there are 4 current pushes that I'm aware of:

Reagan on Rushmore: fat fucking chance.
Reagan on the Dime: pushing the liberal icon FDR off the dime would be a coup d'etat for conservatives. The scary thing is that all this would take is a push from the current administration and not an act of congress, they are usually consulted but hold no power over the appearance currency.
Reagan on the $10 bill: same as the dime, except the travesty would be for Hamilton's legacy.
Reagan monuments in every US county: fat fucking chance, they couldn't even accomplish it here in California

Now Bush is going to use Reagan's death as a shield to stop the bleeding from his failed iraq policies. Every conservative since Reagan has claimed to be his heir, and the amusing thing to me is that Bush is even fucking that one up. Reagan wanted to shrink the government, Bush has seen to it that the government is now larger than its ever been. The only thing they really seem to have in common is that they both used tax cuts to push the national debt into record territories. Every time you hear the word ""billion"" used by the feds, remember that its costing $3 for every person in the country. Think about that next time you hear $400b for drug subsidies, $150b for Iraq, $300b for a pork laden transportation bill.

So far all I've heard about Reagan that has stuck with me is the fact that the guy could sell you poisoned kool-aide and you would thank him for it. He fucking gutted the California budget and cut so many services to shift the burden of funding our government from the wealthy to the middle class. Then he turned around and did it to the rest of the country. Thanks Ronnie! He purposefully ignored AIDs out of what can only be attributed to spite, and left 30,000 people to die a much more slow and painful death than the one he enjoyed. Real fucking American hero. Iran-Contra, just claim to not remember it. Problem solved! The institution of trickle down economics has empowered and exacerbated the current stranglehold industry has over every facet of our government. One more for the gipper!
 
I'm over most of my bitter feelings about all this bullshit, but the glorification really pisses me off.

H.I. McDonnough said it best:
""I tried to stand up and fly straight, but it wasn't easy with that son' bitch Reagan in the White House."""

"event","I hated my sisters music when I kid, she was a little more advanced in her perception and choice in music than I was. Funny thing is now I have a soft spot for a lot of that music because my sister exposed me to it. Amazing how things do tend to come full circle.

Good example, Stage Fright by the Band:

Now deep in the heart of a lonely kid
Who suffered so much for what he did,
They gave this ploughboy his fortune and fame,
Since that day he ain't been the same.

See the man with the stage fright
Just standin' up there to give it all his might.
And he got caught in the spotlight,
But when we get to the end
He wants to start all over again.

<lj-cut text=""the rest of the lyrics.."">
I've got fire water right on my breath
And the doctor warned me I might catch a death.
Said, ""You can make it in your disguise,
Just never show the fear that's in your eyes.""

See the man with the stage fright,
Just standin' up there to give it all his might.
He got caught in the spotlight,
But when we get to the end
He wants to start all over again.


Now if he says that he's afraid,
Take him at his word.
And for the price that the poor boy has paid,
He gets to sing just like a bird, oh, ooh ooh ooh.

Your brow is sweatin' and your mouth gets dry,
Fancy people go driftin' by.
The moment of truth is right at hand,
Just one more nightmare you can stand.

See the man with the stage fright
Just standin' up there to give it all his might.
And he got caught in the spotlight,
But when we get to the end
He wants to start all over again, hmm hmm,

You wanna try it once again, hmm hmm,
Please don't make him stop, hmm hmm,
Let him take it from the top, hmm hmm,
Let him start all over again.

</lj-cut>
Thank you sissy.

P.S. Levon Helm is my new hero."

"event","Went to E3 today. It's the yearly video game trade show where all the software and hardware developers come to hype and sell thier gear. It started out being more of a publisher to vendor sales convention, and has since turned into ground central for anyone who has an interest in the industry. All the publishers and developers but their best tits forward, all the hot marketing girls man the booths, those that don't have hot marketing girls hire from the ready pool of model types in LA. Basically its a bunch of sales bullshit, some T&amp;A, rare freebies, and they even manage to squeeze some video game stuff in. That being said, the only thing that changes from year to year is really the games. The steady marginalizing of PC games to consoles continues, in a few years nobody is going to lay out the cash to develop AAA titles for PC anymore. It doesn't help that companies like EA buy franchises and when they can't exploit them properly, the properties die. There will always be a ton of smaller developers fighting for the remains of the market, but the money involved in creating a 'quality' commercial game today is prohibitive. Consoles seem to be gaining steam if anything, at least I'll still have a job. Got a few little trinkets, nothing to write home about. I got to see some games I've been waiting to see in action, that made the trip worthwhile. Thank you to Mel who got me a free plane ticket and got up at 4:30 to drive me to the airport."

I got a pass yesterday and going to stop at the airport tonight to pick up a ticket for tomorrow. I need to get out of my head for a while, I figure the dazzling lights and busty booth babes will at least prove a distraction for a bit.

She plays wipeout on the drums
The squirrels and the birds come
Gather round and sing the guitar
Oh I. . .have you got nothing to say
When all words fail she speaks
Her mix tape's a masterpiece
She walks through the garden so the roses can see
Oh I. . .have you got nothing to say
And you can see daisies in her footsteps
Dandelions, butterflies
I wanna be Kate
Everyday she wears the same thing
I think she smokes pot
she's everything I want
she's everything I'm not
Oh I. . .

she smiles and it's a rainbow

"event","It has been a stretch since I have updated, I do it now not out of a compulsion to share or vent, but because I don't want people to drop me out of inactivity. Frankly thats a rejection that I take take to heart. My life has been pretty hectic of late...

Work is pushing ahead and onward with TS2, tons of work coming up and I am not looking forward to a season of crunch. The loss of my time adds fuel to the fight I face when I have to balance my life between the women in it, my job, and my often greedy desire to be alone. We moved down to EARS this last week, so far I like most facets of the move. The campus is awesome, it feels like a college campus, so many like minded people milling about. My new cube is nice, I do miss the open environment of my old space but having my own enclosed area is something I sorely missed. I still lament what I feel as the loss of Maxis. The commute is just a big pain in the grommit, but I am trying to be positive and keep my spirits up.

Socially I've been quite busy, I've met someone who I really like and enjoy. Last weekend we went up to Tahoe for Mel's birthday weekend. We went with a handful of her very best friends, and I am happy to have gotten to know them and hang out with them. The list of firsts from that trip:
1. first time to Tahoe
2. first time in a ski lodge
3. first time on a ski slope (we went tubing)
4. first time to Nevada (that I remember)
5. first time to a Casino
6. first time gambling
7. first time I've felt comfortable with a group of people I barely know
There were a number of others, but I won't go into details. :)

This Friday I went with a group of coworkers out for dinner and to see Hellboy, was a very enjoyable night. Last night I went to Mel's birthday dinner and after-party. Dinner was at a wonderful Afghan restuarant, I got to meet her mom and some family friends. I was told by her mom, and the general consensus of the women at the table, that I look like Nick Cage. Hardly the first time, and I still don't know if its something I'm happy to hear, but I still try take it as a compliment. After dinner we went to some little dive bar in the mission. I don't tend to drink heavily, but I did last night. I got plastered, but managed to stay comfortable and happy, mostly because of the company I was in. For me this is an accomplishment that I like to acknowledge. I had one major faux pas, when I smacked Soshi (Mel's cousin) on the ass thinking it was Mel. I'm sure I turned a wonderful shade of red and tried to make myself disapear.

Today I spent most of the day in bed with a wicked hangover. Still feel like crap, but I should be good as new tomorrow. Tomorrow night I'm going to Mel's for a passover seder. I'm not religious, let alone Jewish, but I'm eager to expand myself culturally and experience new things. 

I have yet to really address my emotional state, but I'm finding that difficult to do at the moment. I feel like I'm being pulled apart by tidal forces being created by the people and the context of my life. Its not negative as much as it is stressful. That stress is pushing me to grow and advance, so I see it as a positive step in my life.

I'd like state an unspoken policy I have regarding my journal. I don't write about the women in my life who I know read this journal. I like to be honest and frank and the same time, and I find it can seriously hurt people's feelings. I could write about Jen and how her death affected me with all the honesty I could muster because I knew it could never be read by her. I tend to see the world in shades of gray, negatives and positives, to talk about the people I'm involved with on a romantic level adds a level of tension to my posts that I am just not comfortable with.  Just because I don't write about someone does not mean you don't fill a large place of my heart and mind."

"event","Time marches on. Had to work today, major bitch because it was quite nice out. The even bigger bitch is that we get Thurs & Fri off next week for the studio move, long term forecasts look like shit for late next week.

Regarding the move, last Friday was our last TGIF at Walnut Creek, and likely the last TGIF for Maxis. Every friday the studio has always gotten together for an update from management about the various things going on in the studio. Free beer, hot food, a warm atmosphere, and a lot of socializing. Its always meant a lot to me, because we hop around teams so much that I never get to see some of my good friends at work. You work in the trenches for 10 hours a day, 60 hours a week and you form an odd sort of bond. That bond seems to fall apart after every few projects. There is a small handful of guys who I've worked with for 3 of the last 3 1/2 years, if you do the math its a couple thousand hours. Slowly but surely things get split and broken up. You become a tight knit squad, a band of brothers. At least every Friday we could at least catch up and have a few laughs. I hope its something they continue.

This weeks TGIF was special because we got to meet our new studio lead, seems like a nice enough guy, had a few funny stories to share. Lucy, Luc, and a few other said their peace. Luc is being replaced and shipped off somewhere else, I could say slanderous things about him but at this point I'm just happy to know he is out of my food chain. Will spoke several times, and for such a notorious geek he can be magnanimous and downright touching. Will Wright, if you have never heard of him, is probably the most respected game designer in the industry. If you know him, you like him, if you know what he does, you respect him. I've never found anyone who would disagree with that statement. His brilliance is only outdone by his creativity, if you ever hear him speak you know the guy is a true savant. He co-founded the studio back in 1987 and has been the lead designer and driving creative force behind the Sim City and Sims franchises. He won't be making the move with us to EARS, he has enough clout to force them to open a new small studio somewhere in the east bay so they can finish design on his next project. Having seen it first hand, I can't say if it will be a commercial success, but it is incredible.

On my way home from the SC4 Rushhour ship party we had last Thursday (6 months late), I walked with my old lead Brian. Brian is a nice guy, I like him, I didn't like working under him but some people just don't make good leads. It was funny earlier he told us the story of when he got in his first fist fight in Brooklyn as a kid. He and his best friend, Adam Yauch were jumped walking home. Adam had a cast on his arm so the left him alone to beat up Brian. The story was funny in its own right, until Brian mentioned that Adam was now a millionaire. After someone asked how, Brian said he was in a band, turns out Adam Yauch is also known as MCA, from a little group called the Beastie Boys. 

At any rate on the walk home we talked about my position in the studio and Brian was dismayed that I haven't gotten a raise yet. He drove home the point that I should talk to my boss about it. After I got back, in a margarita induced haze, I talked to Dave, my current boss. He seemed confident that he can push me up a level from CGA II to CGA III, and get me a raise on the order of $15k a year. I've gotten this promise before, but with a few black marks on my record it hasn't happened yet. Doing what I have been for The Sims 2, a high profile game, is going to help me finally get what I deserve. I hope it happens this time, if not, I will burn the building down. Okay maybe I'll just quit.

Other than that not much going on. I helped get Nicki into her corset for the ball tonight, she was so looking forward to it. She was looking damn sexy too. Hope she has a good time, its a rough time of year for her.

In closing I present a link to a story they did a few years back on Maxis, seems like a fitting tribute.

"event","Feel like I've been neglecting my journal so I'm now compelled to post just so people do drop my slothful ass.

Things are well enough for me right now:

Work: Work is chugging along, enough to do that I don't get too bored, but not enough to not make the day drag on. We move the studio next week, I'm gonna miss California Plaza its been home for 3 1/2 years now. I have yet to get my commute issues sorted out. Short term is going to probably be Bart/Shuttle. Long term I'm looking at either a car or a crotch rocket. I'd like to avoid a car if possible, parking in the city is more pain than its worth. I definitely could use the extra mobility, untethering myself from public transit is sounding mighty tempting.

Social: Well I am back in a semi-hermitude, which suits me. Nicki and I still hang out quite a bit and she is usually up to do just about anything. I have been going to Edinburgh 2 or 3 times a week by myself, it has been a growth experience for me. I now feel comfortable walking into most social establishments by myself and not experiencing extreme anxiety like I used to. This is a big step forward for me, I have challenged myself to do it and so far I have been. Other than that my social life has been flat, I need to make more friends but its something I have always had a hard time doing. I would like to find an established group of people who interest me and work myself into a new circle. The mere thought of attempting it sends a cold shiver down my spine, I don't know why or where this fear comes from, it has ruled me all of my life. I will break myself of it, soon.

Tomorrow is St. Patricks Day, my parents anniversary. Tradition dictates I must eat corned beef and cabbage for dinner, and honestly right now that sounds superb. Nicki and I are probably going to head down to Lefty O'douls tomorrow night and fight for a table. If anyone in the city wants to join in the fun, the more the merrier."

<lj-cut>
I hear the train a comin' 
It's rollin' 'round the bend, 
And I ain't seen the sunshine, 
Since, I don't know when, 
I'm stuck in Folsom Prison, 
And time keeps draggin' on, 
But that train keeps a-rollin', 
On down to San Antone. 

When I was just a baby, 
My Mama told me, ""Son, 
Always be a good boy, 
Don't ever play with guns,"" 
But I shot a man in Reno, 
Just to watch him die, 
When I hear that whistle blowin', 
I hang my head and cry. 

I bet there's rich folks eatin', 
In a fancy dining car, 
They're probably drinkin' coffee, 
And smokin' big cigars, 
But I know I had it comin', 
I know I can't be free, 
But those people keep a-movin', 
And that's what tortures me. 

Well, if they freed me from this prison, 
If that railroad train was mine, 
I bet I'd move out over a little, 
Farther down the line, 
Far from Folsom Prison, 
That's where I want to stay, 
And I'd let that lonesome whistle, 
Blow my Blues away.

"event","I hadn't seen Forrest Gump in a quite a while, I knew it would be hard to watch. Apparently I had blocked a lot of it out, I had forgotten how right I was. The movie was Jenny's favorite, for so many reasons. The philosophy of a simple creature just drifting through life on their own internal goodness was one that resonated with her. So many things about that movie, Forrest's braces, his loss of his mother, Jenny's early death, just choke me up now. I had forgotten most these things, the signifigance to me, to her, perhaps just blocked out. Buried.

     I've walled myself in so tight, I wasn't prepared for how I felt when she died. People would look at me at the time and just cry, because they could see my pain, in my face, my shaking hands. People who hadn't met her, people who I had only ever met through the things she had told me about them. Amazing how one person touches so many others. I had everybody there willing to be there for me, yet I wanted no-one. The attention faded, some of it squelched because I didn't welcome it. As it did and the reality of what had happened literaly ripped me asunder. The night she died I got drunk to a degree I don't think I had ever experienced. I was sober during the wake, but when I got back home I came unglued.. I completely fell apart, at least a week of my life dissapeared into a haze of misery I simply cannot remember. I went back to work so soon after, so I wouldn't have to think about it. It distracted me for a little while, then the pain came back. My work suffered, and the flexibility that people had given me in my job had faded when I needed it most. I then started shutting off emotions, I started running. I have rarely felt joy or pain since. I'm more numb than anything now. But like a foot that has fallen asleep because you have been sitting on the toilet too long, the feeling has slowly been coming back with intense moments of pain.

     I'm beginning to feel lost again and I don't know why. Perhaps with emotion coming back, that painful haze comes with it. I've sabotaged my relationships, not giving them the chance they deserve. Part of me wants desperately to run, just keep running to leave it all behind. I want to go, perhaps New York, but maybe I will just let things drift along on their own and see what happens. I don't know whats in store for me, I just know that deep down I hope its a milk chocolate care-a-mel."

"event","I finally finished my ME109, it took too long (I completely retextured it). Theres about 35 maps and 100k polys of love. I didn't think until recently that it might be offensive to some, until I did the tail textures. Needless to say I hate the nazi bastards as much as anybody. I just thought it was a cool plane, and the first one I got some excellent reference on.

"event","Looks like they raised fairs again, downtown to WC is now $4 each way. $40 a week now, it used to be around $30. I guess belts are tight, but I can't help feel peeved about the waste in the bart system. What the hell are we paying for?

The cars stink, some of them have a nice cocktail of odeur thats a pleasant mix of sweat, vomit, urine and feces. Homeless people like to hop on the train and sleep all day. I can't really begrudge them a warm safe place to sleep but I can be pissed that they never seem to clean some of the cars.

Broken escalators. I'm not a lazy man, I have my moments but nothing is more relaxing after a hard days work than to trudge up 3 or 4 long flights of stairs because the escalators are out. I think the Powell station surface escalator has been ripped appart for at least a 1/3 of the last year. They seem to feel the need to rip it apart and put it back together in a manner that makes me suspect that the only thing being fixed is the engineers job security. I think that one escalator has so many 'problems' because its in a prime area to gawk at women. I've noticed they spend WAY too much time being aware of the people exiting/entering the station when they should actually be working. What better job to sit there all day, pretend to fix something thats not broken, and get your jones off by checking out the asses of the women going up and down the stairs?

Conspiracy theories aside, I've long ago accepted the fact that you get what you pay for, and in the case of BART you don't even get that anymore.

Work has started to give us $45 'compensation' transit vouchers every month if you don't use a parking space in the building garage. It cuts down about a fifth of my daily transit costs so I am thankful for that."

"event","So Nicki essentially told me that if we aren't a couple anymore shes going to start meeting new people. I don't really know how to feel about it. I don't have any right to feel too strongly, I ended the relationship and if I don't like it, well thats none of my business anymore. Yet I do feel torn, torn because I do love her and care deeply about what happens to her.  It feels like a finality on our relationship, a finality that hadn't sunken in before, even if it was my own doing.

I lament my own stubborn ways. Irrational fears that mean I rarely form casual friendships and avoid any real commitment. I realized today that I haven't always been like this. Its part of the coping from Jen's death, I was destroyed the first few days and stopped the hemorrhaging by shutting off emotions. Its was suprisingly easy to find myself hurting so bad that having no feelings is preferable to the pain. Over time I turned some things back on. Nicki helped by engaging me to the point where I was dealing with my emotions surrounding the last 2 years and even beyond to teen and childhood years. There is nothing like insight into yourself from someone who is so keen at discerning emotion and emotional reactions. She can be a window to the soul.

With things slowing down at work again and me being alone again I'm going to have a lot of time to think, which is a good thing. Evading your feelings by simply not thinking or indulging them is a dangerous course. I've done it long enough that its become my main coping mechanism, I need to change this.

I would like to expand and work on my social abilities, I feel like a Jack who needs to find his inner Tyler Durden. Meeting new people who live nearby would be great, as would forging ahead with some of my relationships from work. I don't really have a clue where to go from here, guess I'm just going to pick something and run with it.

I am Jack's social ineptitude."

Me: ""Do you like crying?""
Her: ""Yep.""
Me: ""Why do you like crying?""
Her: ""I like to eat my tears.""
Me: ""Why, aren't they salty?""
Her: ""Nope, they are juicy!""
Her: ""But a little salty.""

"event","We have been telling Mia that she has to stop using her paci (our word for pacifier) when she turns three, but that she can love it and use it as much as she wants until then.

So she has become much more picky about it. She wants specific colors at nap time and specific colors at bedtime. Today at my parents house they didn't have the right color so she just went to bed without it.

My mom heard her wake up from her nap. She had rolled over to face my dad (she takes naps with her Papa) and said, ""Mommy wants to get me off the paci. Mommy wants to get me off the bottle, too."" She sighed. ""But I want the bottle.""

She said it so matter of fact and it was just hilarious. Funny thing is since we moved in to this place she hasn't had a single bottle... here. My mom still gives her one there and it drives me nuts. 

She is so great. Cracks me up."

"event","Mia is almost 2 years and 4 months old. She has a wacky sense of humor. She strings lots of real sentences together. She doesn't speak broken English and random words. She uses complete sentences to convey most of her thoughts. Her imagination is incredible. She uses multiple toys for multiple reasons. Her fort is a library, a den, a bookstore, a shop, a store, a bedroom, a kitchen. She tells stories. She plays Doctor Mia. She has jealousy issues. She has vivid dreams that she tells us all about. She loves to go potty on her potty chair, but she isn't fully potty trained yet. She still drinks a bottle, but I'm not pushing her too hard to get off of it. Same goes with her pacifier. I'm giving her the rest of the year to enjoy most of them as much as she can. Once she hits three, they are gone. She's such a girl who loves nail polish, her hair and looking pretty. Her dresses, her tank tops, her jeans, her dresses. She's the ULTIMATE in little pretty.

The way they made Captain Feathersword laugh. Jeff laugh. Their Everett song (about rain, Boeing, the Navy, and coffee). Murray playing Stairway to Heaven. Captain Feathersword singing various spoofs of songs from Metallica to Barbara Streisand. 

It was a blast. Mia was in awe. For most of the show she was just staring at the stage completely star struck and in shock that they were in person and not in the TV.

"event","Mia went tinkle on the potty for the first time today!!! She has been asking to sit on the toilet for awhile now and I would always hover her over the big toilet and she would sit there and nothing would happen and she'd be done. We bought her a Baby Bjorn potty chair awhile back and she always plays with it with her stuffed animals. Well, tonight she started tugging at her pants saying, ""My pants off, Mommy. Go potty!"" I asked her if she wanted to go sit on the big potty and she said no. I asked if she'd like to use her baby potty and she got all excited. So, we took the potty chair to the bathroom and she ripped her diaper off and flopped on the potty. We sat in there for about 20 minutes and then she just started to go!! I was so proud of her. We all clapped and hollered and she was BEAMING. What fun! So proud of my girl. She never wanted to get up either. We'd ask if she was done and she'd say, ""No, not yet."" It was so cute.

She decided when she was on the potty that she needed to take her shirt off, too. <a href=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v502/maybemilla/april6FIRSTPOTTY.jpg"">Warning! Naked potty baby!!</a>

"event","The doctor confirmed that it is ringworm, however he actually said, ""Some people call it ringworm. It's a fungus. It's no big deal."" He probably said, ""It's no big deal"" about a thousand times when he was asked various questions.

He had us pick up some Clotrimazol (for jock itch) and apply it to the area. There are actually two years. The big spot in her diaper area and a tiny spot behind her knee. He figures it should be gone in about a week. To be on the safe side, since the one on her leg is there now, I threw all of her clothes in the wash on hot. I will also do her sheets and our clothes. 

He said that there's no reason to keep her home from daycare and that we don't really need to do any more than put the cream on. I'm just a paranoid fool. Everytime I feel an itch I check myself now, even though I have always had patchy, itchy, dry skin. Sounds like what we're dealing with is simple though and for that I am glad."

She has a small whitish blistery looking half circle in her little private spot area. Based upon readings, it sounds like it might be ringworm, although its not red. Going to go to the doctor tomorrow to see.

I am pretty creeped out by it. Even though it's not really a worm. And it sounds pretty easy to treat with anti-fungal cream. The whole really contagious thing bugs me out and I don't want her to keep having situations like this come back. Not to mention, I don't want to deal with having it.

"event","Today Mia turned two years old. It was such a fun little day.

We all wokre her up singing, got her dressed, and headed down to my late grandma's house. There we met up with my mom, dad, brother, aunt and two great aunts. We watched Mia opened her gifts (which included Rainbow Brite, Baby Ariel, 75 Big Legos, triplet babies, some books, a few DVDs and some really cute realistic play keys). She got to eat chocolate cake off of her Strawberry Shortcake plates with her Strawberry Shortcake napkins. She blew out the singing birthday candle that my grandma bought for her and was so excited about her using. I almost lost it when I was lighting it and watching Mia get so excited, but I kept it together.

After the birthday festivities, we got her dressed in her super pretty pink Easter dress and took her to the Everett Mall for bunny photos (to come later). She LOVED the bunny this year. She ran right up to him, sat in his lap, hugged him. He gave her an egg and a pinwheel. She walked away blowing kisses and then ran back to him, even though two other girls were in his lap. I pulled her away while they got their photos done, but as soon as they were, she ran back up into his lap and got super snuggles. The bunny began orchestrating a Happy Birthday tune for her, in which the photographer, assistant, us, and all of the passerbys around sang to her. She was just smiling and happy sitting in his lap. He gave her another egg, pinwheel and a stuffed Easter bunny (that came with the big photo package). 

As we were walking away from the bunny she wanted to go give him more kisses and she almost had a meltdown, but crisis was averted and all was well. 

After her nap we went over to her Uncle Andy and Aunt Lena's house where she got another book and one of Strawberry Shortcake's friends. We watched some cartoons, she ate pizza crust, and played.

All in all I think she had a fabulous birthday. It was weird to have the party at grandma's house without her. To have a birthday party without her. But we knew she was with us and Mia kept saying, ""Nana hanging out in Heaven, Mommy?"" which made me smile. 

Happy Birthday, Mia Isabella. 

We miss you, Grandma."

When I opened the card up from Mia it said, ""Mommy, your present from me is in my diaper. No, really!!""

I looked at him and couldn't believe he would do such a thing. So I pulled the back of her pants to see if he had put something down the back of her diaper. He was like, ""No, it's in the front.""

I was just dumbfounded and couldn't believe he'd make a poor girl hide something in her diaper. So, I laid her down and went to open her diaper. When I took off her pants though, there on the outside of the front was a message, ""Your present is under my crib.""

I started laughing so hard.

Sure enough, my gift was under her bed. It was Donkey Konga for the Gamecube and is SO FUN. But I will never forget how he decided to surprise me. It was a funny night."

"event","Possibly the worst experience of my life was seeing Mia get her CT Scan done yesterday.

Aron and I were still pretty shaken up about the whole ordeal from Sunday, and we were both bothered that the ER doctor at Children's hadn't done a scan, just to rule out the idea that something is going on in her head. So, I called her doctor late Monday night and we had an appointment with him bright and early yesterday morning.

Monday night was a rough one. She woke up 3 times in the night screaming and was up for the morning at 5:30am. This is a girl who typically sleeps until 9 or 10am and she just had a horrible night of no sleep. I had no sleep. We were both miserable. I couldn't wait for her appointment.

He checked her out and said that she seems fine now, but that it bothered him what had happened. He said the things that took place didn't mesh into any one category and that to make us feel better, and to just eliminate possibilites of what it may have been, we should go in for a CT Scan.

So, we took Mia home and let her take a nap so she wouldn't be too grumpy. That didn't work out so well. She took a good 2 hour nap, but she woke up <b>SCREAMING</b>. Aron got her out of bed and we both tried to calm her down, but she just stood in the living room screaming, ""NO! OWIE!"" and slapping her head over and over and over again. If either of us would try to pick her up or rub her back she would scream, ""NO!"" again and continue just sobbing. It was so hard to watch, and even harder that she wouldn't let either of us soothe her. It was as though she had a horrible dream about us and was afraid. I couldn't help but start crying myself seeing her go through this.

We decided to her ready and go down to imaging. AS soon as we got in the car and put on some Wiggles and gave her a cookie she was FINE.

We got back in the room fast. Because she's such a squirmy little 19-month old, they had to restrain her. They basically strapped her down to a table, and then strapped her her head into a device to hold it still. The machine itself is pretty intimidating and Mia was scared out of her mind.

I stood right next to her and tried to sing her songs and stroke her tummy, but she just screamed and screamed. I haven't heard her cry like that since she was a newborn and the doctors were pricking her foot every other day to test her jaundice. She was just so frightened out of her mind. She got so worked up that she jerked herself free and I had to hold her down, or else they'd have had to do the whole process again.

She was fine once it was over, and she even said ""thank you"" to the technician. 

The rest of the day she was fine, save for when we gave her some crackers in the evening and she held her mouth and said, ""Owie, Mommy."" That now leads me to believe that MAYBE all of this has been her cutting a tooth. Which, is odd for her. She has cut 4 molars and 6 other teeth without any problems AT ALL. But maybe she has a tooth coming now that is hurting more than any had before and maybe that is freaking her out, because it's something she's not used to. All of this just seems extreme for a tooth cutting, but reading some of your stories about how your kids cut teeth, maybe it's not. I hope it's just a tooth.

She slept through the entire night last night without waking up at all. I had to leave for work at 7am and she was still sleeping. I'll be curious to see if she wakes up crying or if she wakes up like normal - just babbling away in her bed. 

I'm glad we did the CT Scan. Even if it shows nothing, it will put us at ease. I've got the most perfect little girl and I just want her to be okay. So keep your fingers crossed for us. We'll find out today if the scan shows anything."

"event","Today was pretty crazy.

Mia was just standing in the living room when suddenly she grabbed the back of her head, started screaming, and was yelling, ""OWIE!"" at the top of her lungs. She came over to me, I picked her up, her eyes lolled back in her head, she went limp and her body started shaking. Not more than a couple seconds later she was completely passed out. Aron splashed some water in her face, she came around, cried a little more, and then was fine.

Earlier this week something similar happened. We were just sitting there and she grabbed her head and started screaming, ""OWIE!"" but nothing else happened that day.

Twice this week she's woken up from sleeping just screaming. We assumed they were bad dreams, but now I wonder if it was something more.

So we called Children's Hospital and spoke with a consulting nurse who asked us to bring her down the ER. A few hours later she was seen by her doctor. They had her hooked up to a machine that indicated no problems in her breathing or heartrate. The doctor checked her reflexes, her walking, her ears, ears, nose, mouth, tummy, and her ability to follow his finger around. He felt that she is acting fine and normal and that he would hold off on doing a CT Scan, which is what they initially said they'd probably do.

So, he sent us home with the peace of mind that she is probably fine, but with the directions to watch her. He said the shaking and passing out this afternoon MIGHT have been a small seizure, but there's no way to no for sure. He said if it happens again they will count today as a first seizure. So now we're supposed to watch for that and take her to the ER again if it happens.

We're also supposed to look for this head situation. He said both times might have just been simple headaches. But, if they become frequent... if another happens in a couple days, and another after that... then he wants us to bring her in and they will do the scan.

I'm bothered they didn't do the scan today. I worry something is going on in her head, but he said that the fact that her reflexes, her capacities and her walking were all normal indicates no head trauma.

So now we wait. Hopefully she is fine. He thinks she is. I pray she is."

Head: 18.5 inches (50 percentile)

And HOORAY for no shots this time! :)

Also, she is such a BIG GIRL now. This was the first visit where she wasn't on the baby scale. She stood on the big people scale, although she was a bit afraid, she stood there and let the nurse weigh her. This is also the first time she didn't have to lay down to be measured with measuring tape. She stood against the scale on the wall!!! 

And tonight she brushed her own teeth for the first time! We've been using a finger brush and Gerber baby tooth gel with her for a long time now, but today we bought a toddler tooth brush and she stood there and scrubbed her own teeth!!"

Just yesterday (as in the day that was 5 minutes ago) my girl is 18 MONTHS OLD! Holy crap.

She took her first trip to the Aquarium on the 22nd. She loved the Sea Otters and ""Oc-pus.""

She can count to 5 with no problem - in both English and Spanish.

Instead of saying ""open"" she says ""abre,"" (sp?) which is Spanish for open.

She can tell you what sound pretty much every animal I can think of asking her makes.

She calls milk ""nook"" and chocolate milk ""noo-nook.""

She sings her own version of ""Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star"" and ""Row Your Boat."" All other songs she'll sing the last word of each sentence. It's super cute.

She's taken a new fondness to The Wiggles, Care Bears and The Count on Sesame Street.


Will add more as I think of them... tomorrow is the 18 month check up, so I'll post her stats."

**

Did any of you ever have a kid that flat out refused to drink?

Mia is 16 months old and just this past week started refusing her bottle. Or a sippy cup. Or even drinking out of a ""big cup"" as she's always loved to do.

We just switched her from formula to whole milk, but she was on it for almost 2 weeks before she stopped all together.

She says ""owie"" when the bottle comes to her mouth, but she still takes her pacifier.

She begs for the bottle, but the instant it gets there she says no.

She will eat anything. My husband got her to drink pedialyte from a spoon.

I just don't understand this and want to know if anyone else has dealt with it. She is staying hydrated. She's producing wet diapers, acting normally aside from this, and is getting fluids other ways (popsicles, Jello, baby food, etc.)

I just need help! I don't know what to do and it's very, very frustrating. 

And I wanted to add that she has seen the doctor today. He says she's perfectly healthy and is saying this might just be a behavioral thing. Her asserting her independance and letting us know that she's running the show. It just seems off for her, to me."

Then Mia starts freaking out and going ""DOUGH-UH"" ""DOUGH-UH"" at the top of her lungs. (That's baby speak for Dora, if you don't know.) So I turn the stroller around and lo-and-behold the stroller has a BIG OL' DORA THE EXPLORER plastered on it.

Needless to say, we bought it and she demanded a ride around the store in it. So cute.

"event","We went to Portland yesterday. Mia's first trip with both her mommy and daddy. It was a pretty fun drive down. Once we got there, however, it was a pain in the ass. My brother does NOT have a baby-friendly apartment and she was getting into EVERYTHING hearing ""NO!"" every two seconds. We finally got him to get some stuff moved that wasn't okay for her to play with. The evening seemed to take forever. The house was stuffy and muggy and we were all really uncomfortable and tired.

Aron decided to take Mia to bed. He laid her in her pack-and-play and then he got in bed. I was in the living room and heard her screaming. Then she stopped. 15 minutes later a scream. Then it stopped. 20 minutes later a scream. And then it stopped for good. Figured she'd finally gone to sleep. A couple hours later I went in to go to bed, myself. Shined the flashlight in her bed only to find she wasn't there. Shined it on the bed and there she was... sleeping with her daddy in the big bed. She has always refused to co-sleep with us, but something about the pack-and-play and new environment changed her mind. It was a pretty uncomfortable night on his small bed. Mia sleeps everywhichaway and any movement we'd make would wake her up.

At 2am she woke up screaming. We gave her a diaper change and a bottle, hoping she'd fall back asleep. After about an hour of her being restless and crying she finally did crash out until 7am. That 2am-7am sleep was pretty good and comfortable. I was awoken to kisses on my cheek from my girl and that was nice. I wouldn't be opposed to her sleeping with us again as long as we can find a way to all be happy doing it.

This morning, however, was a pain. She didn't want to take a nap in the pack-and-play and was REALLY fussy once naptime came and went. We finally made the decision to just leave early. No one was having fun. Brandon was sick. We were all hot. Mia was tired. Around 12:45pm we took off. Mia fell asleep not even 5 minutes onto the road and slept until 2:30am when we were coming upon Olympia. We called Ashlee and Thom and they came and met us for lunch. It was nice seeing them. Been wayyyy too fucking long.

Mia loved Ashlee to bits, and she always has loved Thom, but he was messing with her hair and it PISSED her off (as you'll see in the pictures to follow), so for the rest of the lunch she wasn't too happy with him. But anyway, it was a good time.

Took a ton of pictures. Check 'em out.

If you've got dial-up beware... there's quite a few (and I mean A LOT) to come...

"event","On my way home from work, as I was belting out with Bif Naked in the car, it occurred to me that some of you might be interested in doing a book club with me.

I've had the idea for <b>Circle of Words</b> for a LONG time. It was came to fruition on an ezboard with about 8 people, but I think it failed into the first or second book. Not enough people and not enough drive to get it going.

With the large friends list full of bookworms I have here and the mama friends I have over at Mia's journal, I thought that maybe now this thing could actually come to happen and work.

The idea would be, since we're all busy with work, school, kids.. LIFE, and don't have much time to read but really wish we did... that it would kind of be a ""Book of the Month"" kind of deal. A new book would start on the 1st of each month and we'd set up either a message board or an LJ community and have different post topics for each week. We'd divide the readings into chapters that fit into four weeks. That or we'd make posts for each chapter and as you get to that point in the book you could go into that subcategory and talk about it.

A month is plenty of time to read a book. Say with a limit of 300 pages or so. We'd compile a list of a choice from everybody and I'd draw a new book each month and that would be our selected reading.

I know I don't find enough time to read and in not reading as much as I did when I was younger, I feel like the smart in me is filtering out slowly. Being involved in something like this might give me purpose to sit down and make the time. Besides, we'd all be introduced to new writing styles, authors, etc. that we may never have picked up before.

Just wondering if there's much interest out there in doing this.

They look fabulous when they are at their highest quality, but I reduced the size and resolution a bit to save on space for you all!

"event","Since I didn't discover my new camera until I was actually already out shopping, I decided to read reviews and do research on it now. Wow! Not only are review after review fantastic, but I'm seeing how much I'd have paid for this elsewhere and now I realize why this camera never blipped on my ""possibility"" radar. 

Price estimate at official <a href=""http://www.olympusamerica.com"">Olympus</a> website: $449.00
Price at <a href=""http://www.officedepot.com"">Office Depot</a>: $447.00
Price at <a href=""http://www.staples.com"">Staples</a>: $370.90
Price at <a href=""http://www.walmart.com"">Wal-Mart</a>: $347.57
<b><font color=""red"">Price I paid at <a href=""http://www.costco.com"">Costco</a>: $250.00</font>!!</b>

So, I'm pretty pleased. Sounds like we snagged ourself a DEAL buying from Costco. It beats out the other cameras by 1-2 MP and by only $50-100 more. I'm pretty happy.

The only hope is that this won't give me the same problem my other Olympus has. It was much cheaper and more flimsy, so let's hope!

In July '03 it pooped out. The flash stopped completely and so just now we got around to sending it off to Olympus for repairs. $100 to fix! No way, Jose.

So, we were off to buy <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00009WN9P/qid=1084904611/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1_etk-photo/104-3199434-6236721?v=glance&s=photo&n=502394"">this</a> camera.

When I was at Costco I saw <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00006F2MW/qid=1085004491/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1_etk-electronics/104-3199434-6236721?v=glance&s=photo&n=172282"">this</a> and threw the money at it and now have a pretty camera that takes pictures that BLOWS my other Olympus away.

MUCH HAPPINESS.

"event","Well, Mia is set for the summer. We've spent $100 in summer clothes at the Baby Gap within the past 2 weeks and then on Tuesday night my mom and I blew through another $100 at Toys 'R' Us. They were having a fantastic baby clothing sale and we went crazy. (It's amazing how much more $100 buys at Toys 'R' Us over the Baby Gap!!!)

She got 2 new bikinis (making 3 bikinis and 5 one piece bathing suits!). She's got 3 pairs of cotton shorts, 2 cotton t-shirts, 3 short sets, 2 pairs of capris, a 3-piece PJ set, socks, onesies, shoes. You name it. She's set good.

I love shoppnig for her clothes.

Finally I got my digital camera mailed out after 10 months of the flash being broken and indoor photos being pointless. I should have her back within 2 weeks and then I'll post some pics of little miss modelling her new wardrobe. ;)"

"event","This was the best Mother's Day I could have asked for, with the exception that I am now at work and not spending the entire day with my girl.

I woke up really early to take care of my now-flu-ridden brother and so when Mia woke up Aron told me I could go back to bed.

I was awoken a couple hours later by a beautiful little baby giving her mommy a card. She gave me a big hug and a kiss and then went to play with the light switch. It was so sweet.

Later, after Mia had gone down for her nap, I was laying in bed reading a book while Aron was tinkering around on his computer. He said to me, ""Come over here. I need your help with something."" I was so comfy so I said, ""What is it?"" And he said, ""Come here! I need your help."" I got pissy and said, ""Tell me with what so I can tell you what to do. I don't have to get out of bed."" Then, frustrated, he was like, ""It your Mother's Day gift, jerk!"" So I wandered over to see a slide show begin.

He spent this past week, with the help of his brother, putting together an 8 minute slide show of the past year. Pictures of Mia at all her various stages, set to the song ""Ordinary Life"" by Kristen Barry, which is ""our"" (mine and Aron's) song since the beginning of our relationship.

I sat there on his lap and just had tears in my eyes. I had told him we couldn't afford much for me this year, but to just think of something from their hearts that I would love. He couldn't have done a better job. He was so worried I wouldn't like it, but I LOVED it. I may upload it later so you all can see it. I don't know how big it is, so we'll see.

I gave my mom her gift - a $50 gift certificate to Gene Juarez. And a card that made her cry. Aww. :(

We then spent the afternoon at Aron's parent's house with them and his brother, Lena, both of his grandmother's, his uncle Kevin and his cousin Jon. We were all having such a fun time. We got Lori, his stepmom, a really nice blend of coffee from Starbucks ($20 for half-pound!!) and we got Lena a vase and <b>Mona Lisa Smile</b> for her birthday. It was going so great, but then I had to leave for work. :(

And here I am now. And I better get back to it!!"

"event","Ergh. My mom finally got well and went back to work today, but this thing is spreading like wildfire.

Yesterday afternoon Aron called me from his truck and asked me to come out from. So, I did, only to find him covered in vomit and his truck messy as well. He was in near tears as he explained he couldn't get pulled over fast enough. The rest of the night he spent hobbling between bed and bathroom. Poor guy.

So, when I went to bed last night I felt kind of funny and that continued through the night. I kept a bucket with me just in case. Nothing happened, but when I woke up this morning I felt surely nauseous. I've yet to throw up, but all other symtoms have hit me.

My dad is home. He's been sick since early morning.

We decided to call my grandma to take Mia since 3/4 adults in this house have the flu now. She said she would take her if Mom could bring her over. So, I called my mom, she said she'd be home soon. Not 10 minutes after I hung up with her, Mia got sick again. So, needless to say, Grandma can't take her now.

So we're all sick, except my mom, and dealing with your own sick on top of baby sick is so hard. Mom is coming home from work to help out, but jeez. This flu is the devil."

Mia was mostly better on Tuesday. She was ALL better on Wednesday. My baby was back in full force.

My mom came down with this crap on Friday and was throwing up a whole lot.

Mia spent Friday and Saturday night at my grandma's house. We were worried about her being around my mom (even though she'd already been around her and she's the one who gave my mom the bug to begin with).

Well, anyway. This evening she threw up. They said it doesn't smell like vomit, the way it did last week. It just had a formula smell to it.

But then she had a diarhea diaper.

Aron said she's not acting sick, but she's definitely resting and cuddling and taking it easy.

I hope to god she's not sick AGAIN. How does she give it to my mom only to get it right back? GRR. We were going to Portland on Tuesday and now that might not happen. :("

We bought these at the store:

<li><a href=""http://www.gap.com/assets/product/big/bg235402-01b.jpg"">Talc Tie-Shoulder Tank Top</a>

<li>(and a really cute pair of pink baby Camo pants that are not on the website)


I just bought these on gap.com:

<li><a href=""http://www.gap.com/assets/product/big/bg235531-01b.jpg"">Soft Pink Roll-Up Cargo Pants</a> <---------the camo pants are the same style


She also got two new summery PJs from Costco as well as being reintroduced to her Dora the Explorer PJs from Easter. She's definitely a little female. She still doesn't feel well but when mama came home with a bag full of new clothes, she perked up. Retail therapy works even for a 13-month old!"

"event","So, the girl slept straight from 11:30pm-11:30am. She took one oz. bottle of pedialyte and a jar of rice cereal with apples and bananas for breakfast. Later she had a pedialyte freezer pop and then we went to the doc. 

He said her ear is fine, and that she is probably digging in it as a sign that she doesn't feel good. He thinks she just has a bug, obviously.

So, the day goes by. She takes a bottle of formula when we get home. Takes a 2 hour nap. Upon waking up from the nap she refuses fluids of any kind. Still, we've made it 24 hours since the last puke and diarhea. Here I am thinking the icky stage of this bug is done.

Well, so much for that. 

7:15pm - throw up all over mommy.
7:30pm - throw up all over grandpa.
7:45pm - leave a nice leaky surprise in your diaper for daddy.

This thing is definitely NOT over.

I'm calling in again tomorrow, me thinks."

"event","The day started out with a bottle of formula and a jar of oatmeal and fruit. She had very poopy diaper after very poopy diaper, finally culminating in another throwup session right after we gave her some pedialyte. Took her temperature and she was at 100.3 before her nap at 4pm. Woke up at 6:30pm and since then, according to the ER nurses' orders, we are just giving her 1 oz. of pedialyte every 20 minutes to try and keep her from throwing up again.

So far so good. Last throw up was at 3pm and last diarhea was at 4pm. She's had two wet diapers in the interim. Let's keep away dehydration! Her fever has climbed and she is jabbing at her ears. Can't wait for her dr appt. in the morning."

Last night I was in the bathroom when I heard Aron yelling for me. I ran out the bathroom and Aron was like, ""I was laying in bed and I heard what felt like water dumping on the floor."" I guess he ran upstairs to find her throwing up in her bed.

I walked in to see the poor girl, her bed, her stuffed animals, EVERYTHING, just covered in sick. She was just sitting there. Not crying. Not acting upset. Just waiting for us to clean her up.

We stripped her down and gave her a bath. She was shivering the whole time and crying while we bathed her. She was a-okay when we got her out and dressed. We bundled her up and Aron cuddled her while I stripped her bed, washed off the sick, and threw it all in the machine. 

Luckily I was able to find her spare crib sheets and a blanket and put her back to bed about an hour later. When she woke up this morning there was a little bit more vomit in her bed, but not much. 

Today she's been good. She has had a lot of diahrea. I found our from my friend Sarah that her son, EJ, has the flu and most likely gave it to Mia on their playdate on Monday. So, I have me a sick little girl. We're going to see her doctor tomorrow and see if she has an ear infection like EJ does. She's been digging in her ear, so I think she may.

I went out and bought some pear juice and pedialyte and a transition cup to try and start her on. She's an amazing sick kid, though. More cuddly and tired than normal, but not crying or fussy. She's still got her appetite and ate some rice cereal this morning. I was told not to give her any formula or whole milk while she's sick, so we'll see how she does on the juice when she wakes up.

I'm staying home from work today. My husband is here, but I want my girl. I want to take care of her and make sure she is okay. If I lose my job because I take too many days off to take care of my kid, then so be it. I've already got 4 occurances and we're only allowed 6 in a year. If you have sick time, you still get an occurance. If you take unpaid time, an occurance. It's tough. I was sitting here crying because I felt like I can't stay home to care for my girl because I'll lose my job if I do.

Well that's not cool and it's not fair and my daughter means way more to me than the extra bit of money this job gives us. I can always find another job..."

Well, tonight the little rugrat just sat there going, ""Mamamamamamamam!"" This makes me feel so squishy and happy and makes it REALLY hard to stay here for another hour and fifteen minutes.

Bear in mind now that this little girl once decided to spend an entire day calling me Mama but has since reverted back to her stinkerish little ways of Dada. I AM NOT DADA!

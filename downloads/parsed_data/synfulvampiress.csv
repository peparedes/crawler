"event","I had a false belief
I thought I came here to stay
We're all just visiting
All just breaking like waves
The oceans made me, but who came up with me?
Push me, pull me, push me, or pull me out 

So if there were no angels, would there be no sin?
You better stop me before I begin
But let me say: if I behave, can you arrange a spacious hole in the ground
Somewhere nice, make it nice
Where the land meets my tide
Push me, pull me, push me, or pull me out 

Like a cloud dropping rain
I'm discarding all thought
I'll dry up, leaving puddles on the ground
I'm like an opening band for the sun
Push me, pull me 
I've had enough, said enough, felt enough, I'm fine

"event","This Morning:
Me: What the hell is your problem
Mom: You, know what my problem is? You.
Me: Do you want me to fucking slap you, bitch?
Mom: If you do, I'm calling the cops.
Me: *smashes glass*

Tonight:
Mom: Jackie, I'm not in the mood for company
Me: Okay, mom... I'll be right in.
Me: I'll clean the house for you, I filled out applications.
Mom: As you should.
Me: I'm really sorry about this morning, mom. I love you.
Mom: Yeah, well... you need help.
Me: Don't we all... I've been really depressed and-
Mom: What else is new?
Me: Huh? I'll just ignore that... mom, can't we just be friends? I want us both to help each other out. We really need to-
Mom: I'm the mom, I call the shots!
Me: Yeah, you know what... I understand that, but my friend should be able to be here, I was going to clean
Mom: I'm so tired of putting up with all your crap, you have turned into a slob. I should have thrown you & your stuff out a long time ago... but I've just been letting you take advantage of my house. I'm so tired of putting up with you.
Me: Putting up with me? You don't even know what love is.
Mom: Who ever said that I love you? Oh & what is a bowl doing in your bath room? Do actually eat in the same place as you go to the bath room?
Me: No, fucker! I was dying someone's hair!
Mom: See? I can't talk to you, all you ever do is curse me.

After all of those empty ""I love you's."" I finally know the truth. 
I wish that my dad was still my friend, he's fabulous; untill he blows up... but that's not real either. He apparently feels like he just has to put up with me too.

Mom & Dad: I'll be whatever you want me to be from now on, just let me be your daughter. I'm sorry, I'll put butterflies in my hair, date guys & go to church. 
I really wish that I grew up respecting my parents.

Fuck it."

"event","Aww:
Katrina's parents drove 2 1/2 hours to come get me today. Why?------> I called their house at 4:30 in the morning piss-drunk, bawling my eyes out------> that's LUV. 
Blah:
Every time my pride is hurt I have to change my surroundings. That's just the way I have always been. 
I want:
Someone to hold me.
I went:
To West Virginia to live with my Dad & got the Shit beaten out of me the second night I was there. 
I went there:
Beacause I was humiliated & ""needed"" different surroundings.
I no longer have:
Alyssa ------> See my previous post(s)... I let myself care for her too much.
And...:
I still do... love her so much that it hurts to breath.
Now: 
I'm done being sappy

It's not REALLY my style

"event","So, this weekend I went down to VA & stayed at Crazy Adventists R US AKA my family, went to a Southern Gospel Concert, just to make everyone happy & alomst died, I mean a soon as I waled in there one of the performers started joking about my libret, which would have been fine & dandy if they didn't have thins whole like dedicate yourself to ""g0d"" thing & start staring right at me. ARGH! I wanted to shoot them all.
Never have I felt more like a child than I have in the past 6 months, I know I'm supposed to feel liberated, right? ""Legally"" I'm an adult woo hoo! That's bullshit, I fel like the biggest waste of space right now, & tell me why I've been trying to get a job & I had a few applications to drop off today & my mother comes home & is like ""I'm going to the Mall, but wait you look like shit, so I won't be taking you"" I know, I should have a car OR at least a liscence, right? Nope, I don't... I hate getting rides from people all the time, I don't want my friends to feel like I'm using them, I need to get my liscence, a car, of course I need to move out, & it's imperative that I get my GED... --->wouldn't this all require a job? But how do I get there without help, not from my frinds but MY MOTHER?!?! 
I am now the loser that I swore I would never become. This is the longest period of my life that I've gone without a job since... well, 7th grade.
So, what is my life now? Well, I no longer see a reason to socialize really,I no longer see myself as a person of substance, so why go out, right? So, I'm either at home alone, with Jackie, OR @ Alyssa's house... which is fine because I adore them both... Oh, yeah & some nights I go to practice for Finnian's Rainbow (which I have a nothing part in) 
I feel so empty, & not to sound dramatic... but somebody do me a favor & just shoot me, I see no reason to to fight back."

"event","Every smile to me has been on the surface
Looking past each smile to merely see a mask
I can remeber the first day that all changed 
That night my photographic memory was rearranged
Is it morbid to dream of her smiling in death?
I always picture taking one last breath...
With a smile
If she will smile in the grave
I will stand there for a while
Attepting to be brave
But I'm not...
                                               ~Me~

Tomarrow I'm hoping to see a few people that I haven't seen in forever...
Life has been beautiful lately...
School did not work out...
But I will surround myself in positve things from now on...
Attempt to be happy, cause happiness I hear is a great thing...
I've been feeling it on a higher degree than normal lately...
All my ""people"" let's start focusing on nothing but postive things...
Once they become negative, find something else beautiful to fully emerse youself in...
Good idea eh? No FUCKING GREAT Idea!

Pitiful Update:
So, I've become really careless with this whole live Journal thing... I hardly ever update anymore (If anyone noticed.) 
But, yeah I am definately missing some kids that I haven't seen in an extemely long time. I guess other than that life has been great, well close to it. I've been attepting to get my shit strait, you know... get a job, my GED, voice lessons, take some courses in community college... All of which are currently NOT happening at the moment, practically this entire summer (with an exception of 2 weeks) I've been a jobless, careless, freeloading loser. It's been somewhat beneficial though, I guess with all this ""free time"" I've gotten to actually KNOW myself & be more accepting of others.(which by the way,is a HUGE step for me) I have actually started to talk things out better & accept the fact that I might need help. 
So guess I'm just really tired.  /What could I possibly be tired of, right?/ -My Friends & Girlfriend having to pay for EVERYTHING,(practically) Having little, to no reason to get up in the morning, not having a sense of responsbility, a sense of life, having INSANE emotions *NOTE: the Mushy Gushy LJ entries*... 
I'm sure that everyone around me is getting sick of it, too. I've broken promises, stood people up, I've just been a god-damn JERK! So, I am truly sorry for neglecting people... but I guess once I hit the ""legal age of responsiblity"" things just kind of fell. 
Well, I'm ready to get back on the ball & try kickin' some ass... But first, I need about 10 people to kick MY ass, yeah that'd be great."

<P>So I went to Va to take care of my Grandmother for like a week &amp; when I got back <FONT color=#ffcc33>I got to see my baby</FONT>... I missed her muchly so, she got me these really purty <FONT color=#ff0000>Marilyn Monroe</FONT>&nbsp; pictures...&nbsp; <FONT color=#9999ff>(which was really&nbsp;ironic,&nbsp;because when she came over I was wearing a <FONT color=#ff0000>Marilyn Monroe</FONT> shirt&nbsp;&amp; was listening to my <FONT color=#ff0000>Marilyn Monroe </FONT>C.D.)</FONT>&nbsp;Just seeing&nbsp;<FONT color=#ffcc66>her </FONT>for even a&nbsp;little bit made me forget&nbsp;that there could ever be anything wrong in my life. Even just hearing her voice makes me&nbsp;smile... Okay, folks... make the discusting <FONT color=#cc66cc>*gushy noise* <FONT color=#000000>I've earned it.</FONT>&nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P>Then yesterday <FONT color=#33cc00>Jackie </FONT>took me to see the Exorcist and lemme tell you I almost&nbsp;pissed my&nbsp;pants! I think she got tired of me jumpin' up &amp; sqeezing her arm.&nbsp;Anywho,&nbsp;after that she got me a really cute wig *shhh don't tell anyone*, but yeah my head is getting all fuzzy from shaving it &amp; well sometimes I just wanna be a girl... a really girlie girl... cause it's fun to have&nbsp;<FONT color=#999900>*MEN*</FONT>&nbsp; turn their heads&nbsp;at me, I kind of missed that attention<FONT color=#336666 size=1><STRONG> (even though I am not attracted to guys, it still can be fun to have them all hot &amp; bothered by me)&nbsp; </STRONG><FONT color=#000000 size=3>So after that we went to get some Mexican food &amp; the waitress was like ""can I get you a margita"" <FONT color=#3333ff>(it's funny how different I look with some heels, a dress, &amp; lil wig. I kind of reminded myself of a buisiness woman, I didn't even feel like myself.) </FONT><FONT color=#000000>I mean, I used to never get carded, but it seems like the older&nbsp;I get&nbsp;the younger I look. <FONT color=#006600>~*Alright, got side tracked*~</FONT>...&nbsp;So then we&nbsp;made a liquor run, went to hang out with Justin, Matt, Racheal, &amp; Raquel... &amp; yeah Racheal had to go to work &amp; Matt wanted to go get some ass... So all that was left was Justin &amp; that girl, Raquel... BOO!!! They were boring us, so we left. </FONT><FONT color=#33ccff>(Not like we aren't funny enough gals to entertain ourselves! Har. Har. *big toothy grin*) </FONT><FONT color=#000000>So we came home &amp; were thinking about going to Alyssa's, because you know- -</FONT><FONT color=#9999ff>I have an evil, fat old Ma' &amp; I just knew that she'd ruin our night</FONT><FONT color=#000000>- -And that she did, when she came home all she could do was yell &amp; she didn't even *gasp* say anything about my wig! The nerve of her! So we went down stairs &amp; I boo hooed, but soon the boo hooing turned to laughter &amp; the laughter turned to being scared of the Exorcist all over again. </FONT><FONT color=#663366>(Damn that </FONT><FONT color=#33cc00>Jackie</FONT><FONT color=#663366>) </FONT><FONT color=#000000>Then she went home, cause the fat one&nbsp;*affectionately known as mom* said she couldn't sleep over &amp; she was getting tired. </FONT><FONT color=#6666cc>The liqour is still sittin' in the basement, waitin' for Jackie to come &amp; drink it.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000 size=3>So yeah, it wasn't long after she left that I started crying &amp; being a dumb little kid, crying for my lost childhood. I know, <FONT color=#000066>*Boo Hoo*</FONT>&nbsp;So I just started looking for something that I thought would make me feel better &amp; sure enough, I found it... Only it all it did was make deleriously stupid. So I called Alyssa &amp; didn't tell her what I did at all, just focussed on the <FONT color=#ffff99>highlights</FONT> of&nbsp;my day... Then my friend, Joey saw me online &amp; asked me if I wanted to do anything, immediately I asked him if he wanted to go up to Towson to suprise Alyssa, so he picked me up &amp; I was all excited... on the way we were talking&nbsp;about how we were going to sing&nbsp;Xmas Carol's on her door step, but instead... I did the stalkerish thing &amp; just tapped on her bed room window... I really tried to play off the whole being fucked up thing with her, it worked for Joey, but she's seen me drunk too many times &amp; I just seemed like &nbsp;a different person... I was an ass... made her all worried...&nbsp;Then we just talked for a while &amp; suddenly I&nbsp;somehow managed&nbsp;my whole stupid silly high. I <FONT color=#cc66cc><STRONG>LOVE </STRONG></FONT><FONT color=#000000>her. </FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>We left after about an hour, Joey got called to a house fire <FONT color=#663300>(he's a firefighter &amp; a republican, yuck!)&nbsp;</FONT><FONT color=#000000>I saw someone there that I'd rather forget, but thankfully she was too preoccupied with the fire to notice that I was there.&nbsp;We watched the house disengrate &amp; it felt like a nice lil campfire.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>Okay... after I went home I didn't fall asleep untill about 6 or 7 <FONT color=#ff6666>(which is not too unusual for me, but still I'm blaming it on that damn movie)</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000>And there we have it yesterday was wonderful in alot of ways,&nbsp;Muh <FONT color=#33cc00>Jackie&nbsp;&nbsp; </FONT>really&nbsp;sweet to me, My <FONT color=#ffcc66>Alyssa</FONT> helped me focus...

I didn't never _get_ the concept of `rape'; sure it's evil to stick
your dick in some guy's ass; that ain't natural, it serves no use
except to get your rocks off, which is ok of course, because guys got
needs. Like if you're locked up, like in juvie hall, like in prison,
where there's only guys, nobody holds it against you for using some
little faggot punk like a girl, considering there's no pussy to be
had. But if there's pussy around, you're not supposed to do that
shit, it ain't _right_.

But what the fuck is this bullshit concept `rape'? Women got pussies
and pussies are for sticking your dick in, to further the species. To
make more humans. It's biology, pure and simple.

You ever been around when a female cat goes in heat??? You think the
Toms lining up for a turn bother to ask ""please may I fuck you?""

Fuck no, they line up and take turns banging away, one after the
other, and it ain't all sweet and lovey dovey, hell no! What, you
think ol' Tom sucks a little cat twat to `get her in the mood'?? Shit
no, the males do a train on the cat in heat, stick their dicks in her
one after the other, all fucking day long, scratching and biting at
her, they keep at it for a couple days, till she's knocked up and
outta heat.

So what me and my boys do, it's nature, that's all. We're just
cattin' around is all.

There was this Dina bitch in the neighborhood, god she was sweet,
they say she was only ten when we broke her in, I don't know about
that, all I know is the little cunt's _body_ was ripe, her tits were
starting to fill out, and as soon as the little bitches in the
neighborhood start poking nipples through their T-shirts, me and my
boys have them down the basement, teaching them about how it is with
men and women, just like your cat first time it goes in heat, all the
neighborhood Toms have their dick in her cunt.

Like that Dina kid.

We kept that little baby locked up, banging her all ways to hell, four
fucking days. She was so fucking tight, bled like a sonofabitch, they
always do the first time, screamed just like a cat in heat, when I
busted her cherry. She quit screaming so hard after about the 8th guy
balled her she just kinda whimpered, going along for the ride, moaning
a little louder when some guy with a really fat dick would opened her
snatch up again. And man, she finally got the swing of things, movin'
with the flow of guys crawlin' her body, nice firm chunky body too,
fat nipples, real strong, real fuckable, by the second day, round two,
I could tell she was really into it man, the way she fucked me back.
She didn't have no pussy hair yet, but I hear from some a the boys she
do now.

She was great man, the fucking best. Guys were coming and going all
fucking day and night, four whole days and she couldn't of got more
than maybe six, seven hours sleep the whole time, only a hour here and
there when somebody wasn't on her. Not counting the time she was
passed out and guys were fucking her limp. Really fine bitch in heat
like that, guys go nuts. I don't say it's right to fuck some chick
that ain't conscious, but you get your nut up, what the hell you gonna
do, you know?

I did pull PeeWee off her ass though, that's some sick shit, he was
hollerin' her cunt was all stretched out, too loose, that's why he
done her in the ass, when I was beating the piss out of him for being
a goddamn pervert. He was hollering it was all slimy with everybody's
jizz, fuck that shit I told him his fucking pinky dick is just too
small the filthy fucking scum. Have some goddamn respect for the
bitch. You don't fuck no girls in the ass, you wanna do that sick
shit go find yourself a fucking pervert fag to poke.

Christ, you know, time we got around to doin her, this Dina, man
she been struttin' all over the goddamn neighborhood for months, big
ol' nipples bulging through her t-shirt, plump little ass wigglin' she
was obviously ripe for it, and she was doing up her hair and shit,
dressing hot, obviously trying to attract some sexual attention.

So it beats the fuck out of me why she went to her Mama, that uptight
religious bitch, and claimed she didn't want it, the little slut,
crawlin' home to mama with a pussyful of four days worth of about
twenty, thirty guy's jizz running down the inside of her legs, all
sticky with cum like some goddamn whore. I already explained how it
don't matter if they want it, cuz it's just nature that men fuck women.
I tried to explain it to the judge too but the goddamn faggot just
couldn't get what it is that non-faggots do, what the score is with us
regular hetero sexuals.

So big fuckin' deal, I'll be out in a couple months on good behavior.
There's a punk little nigger in here his ass is tighter than Dina's
cunt, he don't dare rat me out for fucking his cherry little butt,
just means that much longer I'll be around to screw his ass if he gets
me in shit with the man.

Course, couple more weeks with my dick up his ass a couple times a day
and it won't be so tight anymore, but he's mine, the other guys know
to lay off him and he don't do a half bad job suckin me off, that's
another thing faggots are good for, eatin' my jizz. Anyhow, there's
new punks almost every day, his ass gets too loose I'll pick up some
new faggot and set the wolves on him.

This Discusts ME... I found it on a website... I don't get it how some people get off to this shit! PURE SICKNESS!!!"

"event","We all know that one day we will forget; even if we choose not to. Our memories will one day be shot. Most of us will grow old, but few will truly find happiness. Everyone has the one person that they are supposed to share life with, but sadly most people over look that one person according to different issues. I have never gone searching for love, it's just always kind of found me; love scares, as it should everyone, for once you've reached that level of vulnerability, you're likely to get burned. It seems like I always fall for the one that will scar me to the core, but like someone once said to me- You can't help who you fall in love with, it just happens, and unfortunately she was right! 
Everyone has the potential to be happy, but they need to stop depending it on everyone else, happiness comes from with in and yes, only you can let yourself be hurt. I just hope that one day the rest of civilization will realize that.

My soul mate said to me two weeks before she died: 
Never forget the glorious moments in life and never dwell on the heart aches, that will get you no where, keep your head up baby girl. Only you can let your self fall. 

I should have remembered that instead of her death... she was right, I can kind of feel her telling me to move on now, I think that she regrets killing herself over our little dispute, because now I think she knows how much I  cherished her.

Good news, guys... I'm moving on and listening to all the good advice that the sane Prestine gave to me... never again will I blame myself for her death!

I am at peace now :)"

I hate so many people (including myself), sometimes I wish that I never went to rehab, yeah it made me grow up and not use drugs anymore, but it also helped to develop a stick up my ass. 
I want to be innocent; I want not to know what it feels like to have done pretty much everything, now I feel numb. There is so much in my life that I want to change, so much in my past that I need to erase. 
I want to be perfect, stable; but I never will be. Not even my own mother has faith in me.

That is at least what people keep telling me and what I keep on telling myself... I loved the way she made me feel... Now I feel empty... I wish that I didn't have so much baggage... Maybe then things would have been perfect... But wait- she has baggage too! I DO know how to deal with it though! Hmmm... I guess she was right when she said that we have nothing in common... But if that was truly the case would I still have felt so safe and close to her? I think not! 
I was at church today and could not stop bawling! I tried to stop but the tear kept rolling down my cheeks. So the guy next to me went and go me a tissue that was sweet. Yet it still didn't cheer me up... so I had to take a breath outside, I tried calling her, but she didn't pick up, so I called Tori, and she kinda made me feel better... Her mom rocks by the way... and I just found out that mine does too!
I just wish that I could stop crying over her... Hopefully I will... I feel like a stupid little girl... I guess I just need to forget all of my regrets and just go with it! Love hurts but everything will get better in time, It's not like I haven't or won't experience worse things."

Can I scream?!?!?! Or will anyone even stop and here me? 
No. I'll just keep my mouth shut and pretend that I have meaning, just act like everything is fine, because after all... it is... in everyone else's eyes... things with me will always be fine. Since I am no longer able to talk to her... things seem fair... She always said the time will come when life will leave it's scar... I think it has... No one knows how or when, but SHE.

I was an official Mall rat last night... felt kinda childish just hanging out there... Too much drama at the mall I swear! I had to stop a fight and then some chick wanted to fight me just because I was wearing an extremely short skirt & her little boy toy looked at me... big fuckin' whoop! Ah, children, children. I'm being good though... Earlier I would have gotten angry, but this time, I just laughed and ya know what? It felt good! The night turned out nice I met someone really cool, so that's always good!

So, yeah today I went to Ellicott City with my friends Soo & Steph, it was splendid... Stephanie bought a vintage dress which she looks amazingly gorgeous in. She will look super-hot at prom! 
The day was so beautiful and I was completely happy and really had no problems at all (which is really rare for me) Splendid, Splendid!

"event","HER death had left it's venom inside of me, and the scar was deep, but SHE came and eased the swelling. I can now let go of HER, for SHE has freed me from bondage. There was a darkness in my soul that left when SHE touched my hand and HER face no longer haunts my sleep. SHE says she loves me and I forget that I LOVED HER. SHE held me... And the memory I had of HER froze and was forgotten. For SHE brought peace to my guilty conscience and NOW, my heart can love once again."

"event","Nic, Lindsay, Tori and I Went to the Cemetary to see a friend of Tori & mine. Tori & I lost it... I never got to say good bye to her, go to her funeral, nor had I ever seen her Grave... In the same cemetary was my former girlfriend, Prestine. I tried to focus on Holly but soon all of my thoughts went stait to Prestine... I felt so Guilty being there with Nic... Prestine would roll over in her grave if she saw that... all that I could think about was her cold, lifless body in my arms... I feel horrible telling Nic my feelings towards her when Prestine never got to here it from me...
 I guess the beauty of the day is soon forgotten when one finds themselves in grief... But I will never forget that moment... And I will never forget HER."

My Dad is fileing for custody of me after I'm 18 so technically I would still be a minor because of ""mental issues"" life would really suck for me if that happened. I just want my fucking independence! I'm not crazy... I just hope that the judge can see that!"

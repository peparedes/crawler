"event","well there is a reason well 1st we spent all of english talking about who likes who and then well it carried into lunch.  Josh decides that they (members of my table) all got to ask me 10 yes and no questions to find out who i like people always want to know who i like well i like this one guy and i honestly have liked him for a long time but yah i always say i like someone else or i date someone but nothing gets real serious cause this guy is always in the back of my head no matter who i say i like and if i say someone is cute or that i like somone it is usually just a cover for the truth but thats the way i work because if i told you who i have liked for so long so much drama would occur from such an announcement as one of that magnitude well otherwise today was fine i got a 100 on my Media test lol (hah hah hah josh and shippy have to read it lol lol) but its all good there are english versions out there just go and find them well the rest of the day is ok today is the last voleyball so well i'll live but everyone has to call me while i'm absent or else  Tutals   Vicki"

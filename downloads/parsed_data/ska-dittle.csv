"event","theres no reason to read this. since ive been back ive realized my friends arnt what they used to be.Ive gone though this before and now again. Its my junior year of highschool and these so called friends arnt there. youd get close with a group of people and they would stab you so quick for there own good.on my birthday people let me down. once a year you expect to have this awesome day were everything is good. it starts with school and this years going to be hard. teachers being cool be hard. first real day of getting things started. your not perfect and the teacher puts you down after you say its your birthday. your 16th is suposed to be one of your best and your friends forget it and also dont pick up there phones. this is after you have to take a test to get into this class with the teacher who is more concernded about a contract over the lives of her students. they have no idea what is going on in there kids lives but can be cruel and have this power that im older and i must tell you what to do.so after i take the test not knowing if i will pass it i come home to a house were everthing might be alright to others but inside were having problems as well. my family will never do anything wrong to anyone but people but people will walk all over us like theres nothing wrong. ive given so much and what is happening i do not deserve. theres an old saying you give you get. i give and i get stabed in the back. on my birthday. i will repeat this for how my day was on a level of understanding that no one could imagine. i learned working at camp this summer you have to hold in things. ive though myself keep many things to myself. i dont complain much. i dont get everything i want.how i can treat people like shit and pick out everything wrong with them so i can feel better.to have someone wait one me hand and foot. but dont ever say anything.so as my day went on i was asked to go out to dinner with the family. i wasnt in the best ""mood"" and really could have done somthing fun with my friends but they were busy,that busy they would forget to say anything in the hallway.not even a hey happybirthday. just to make fun of everything you do wrong.once the sister got home we left. i wasnt feeling it as we got there. with eyes watering i didnt want to be there.i asked for a cellphone.a small present that wouldnt be to much work to try and do.i was almost taked to like i was nin again,about how money for it would fuck people over. it couldnt be a simple dinner with good conversations and happy talk of things. it had to be about everything wrong in peoples lives. i stoped listening. it would ruin my night,day even more.they realized what was going on but still couldnt feel the stress i was going though. it wasnt fun.it was on my birthday.please dont comment.im mostly venting.but with tears in my eyes.its also raining, on my birthday.after dinner staples for school supplies. it was not as bad as it oould have been.once i got home i watched a show on 9/11andit put me in a mood in which i felt saddened. i walked upstairs to use the computer.telling a girl what everyone has done before and was let down.wishing there would be some type of person out there would connects on the same level. not upset just hurt. all this on my birthday.i havent been this sad in a long time.all the things about this year suposted to be the best well its not starting out so good. well i must go to bed now. theres one thing i can say if your a good person stay that way.dont let people hurt you."

"event","this summer was undiscibable, see i dont think i spelled that right either but it doesnt matter. i worked at a camp for 2 and a half months. Most of my friends wouldnt be able to do it. Having to get up at 7 in the morning, teaching kids how to use guns and bow and arrows. Yes i worked with guns,shotguns,22's. kids sucking and adults sucking more. but these bad things dont even compare to the friends i made.Some but not all were better than the freinds i have at home and thats sad to say because its partly true. these guys i worked with were almost brothers to me. we had times that no one outside of camp would understand. But better than my friends was the place. Camp Yawgoog is unlike anywhere on this earth. its in our backyards to. only 40 minutes away. The things i saw and dreamed were unblieveable. I have come to say i love camp. Its an amazing place and i wish to go back.

After camp was over i went to my beach house. Once a year my family rents this old little house thats been around since the hurricane of 38. The best house we could have rented. It was nonstop fun. going fishing, windsurfing, sailing, and having friends that came down. the week went by so fast that were going to start getting two weeks. its also amazing compared to others like home.

I start school next friday or somthing. It should be crazy. in aspect of it sucking. good seeing people i havent all summer but ill get sick of it fast.havent picked up a book yet and not sure if i will."

I know I fell asleep in a few classes, but I promise it was because I was working so hard that I just exhausted myself.&nbsp; And lastly, I want to give a very special thank you to everyone who's ever read my blogs, followed me on Twitter, friended me on MySpace/Facebook, stopped me in the streets, or just quietly listened to our radio station.&nbsp; Whether you realize it or not, you're the reason why I love radio - your reactions, your participation in all of our silly little games and contests, your phone calls, the stories you respond to and remember us telling...&nbsp; I never thought&nbsp;anyone would ever ask me&nbsp;for an autograph or a picture, but you do sometimes&nbsp;and it's all too much - too wonderful.&nbsp; Thank you all, and congratulations to my fellow 40 Under 40 honorees.&nbsp; It's all downhill from here."

"event","Reposted from <a href=http://www.hot1079.com/pages/deafgeoff.html target=_blank>my hot1079.com page</a> - not everyone reads both pages, and this meant a lot to me, so...


Marty, Shannon and I are always enthusiastic to help out whenever we can, wherever we can.  For example, three weeks ago I got my head shaved for St. Baldrick's, the foundation that fights children's cancer.  In June, we'll be at the AIDS Walk at Beaver Lake Nature Center.  Even the Donkey Basketball game was more than just another silly night out - we helped raise money for the ESM Class of 2010.  

One of my favorite things to do is visit schools and speak to kids about who I am and what I do - it's funny because I never thought I'd be someone talking about my career and giving advice to others.  I do it because I see how I can help not only with giving direction about finding the things you're passionate about and pursuing them, but also about growing up with a disability, coping with it, and overcoming it to do what you want to do.

I got this e-mail today:

<I>I want to give you a HUGE shout out! On Tuesday March 25 you were at my daughters school Weedsport Elementary as a guest reader. I just want to say thank you for talking to my daughter about being deaf. In the past I have had issues with her. She does not like to wear her hearing aids. She will not put them on until she gets to school and takes them off as soon as that bell rings to go home. She is embarrassed by the fact that she needs them.  When she came home Tuesday she was so excited to tell me about you. She listens to 107.9 all the time and to have someone from the Radio talk to her about this excited her! She told me about her conversation about the FM system and how you only have 10% of your hearing. Anyways... Thank you for being a mentor for my daughter and I hope she continues to meet more people like you! By the way... She carries your autograph around with her and shows it to EVERYONE!
  - Kim A.</i>


I felt tears well up in my eyes as I was reading it.  It means a lot to me to know that what I do means a lot to other people.  Thank you, Kim."

"event","First, I need to apologize that my posting here is going to become more and more sporadic, or at least if I am going to able to write here it'll be much more abbreviated.

Second, I need to apologize to just about every woman that's ever stepped in my life or allowed me to step into hers.  Because I'm writing a book about you.  

Ever since I was a kid (I still am to some, I guess) I wanted to be a writer, and I've always tinkered with this and that, indulged in poetry, lyrics, gonzo blogging and various other literary expressions of my mad mind.  I conceptualized a few ideas for a book, including an embarassing collection of poetry I shared with a small handful of people as well as a script that never saw the light of day beyond a Film class.  However, consistently writing about one thing has always been taxing on me, both emotionally and creatively.  I think I've finally found a way to organize a lot of the things I've wanted to write, and I'm going to do it.  

And yes, before you ask, the fantasist in me has already started pondering what I'd tell Oprah if I ever became a book of the month.  Even though I've only got a dozen pages written.  But I really think this is far less damaging of a fantasy than the one I had about the musician the other day.  And far more... possible."

"event","One of my most memorable classes at Syracuse University was Philosophy 191 with Dr. Laurence Thomas, not just because he was a great professor but because it was one of the few classes that has an immediate application to the real world.  I'm not going to use Italian history (except on Jeopardy) or 18th century poetry (except to impress girls), but I can apply all of our discussions about moral fiber and debates about justice and righteousness to my own daily life.  Hot-button issues like abortion, racism, and other polarizing discussions were turned on their head in that class when we established premises or modified the situation in light of various scenarios.

That semester, I met with Dr. Thomas in office hours, spoke with him outside of class and even had lunch with him.  One of his favorite questions to pose to me was a debate that is not unlike the ""Sound And The Fury"" debate, and now, possibly three years after being in his class, he's written an entire essay about on his blog and he used me as an example:

<a href=http://www.moralhealth.com/blog/_archives/2007/12/27/3431739.html target=_blank>http://www.moralhealth.com/blog/_archives/2007/12/27/3431739.html</a>

He called me ""the Frederick Douglass of deaf people,"" which may be the most unusual thing I've ever been called, but I agree with his stance.  It is wrong and inappropriate for parents to want to impose any condition on their children, be it blindness, deafness or any other characteristic.  I don't like the idea of genetic manipulation in fetuses that's in the very near future (i.e. making your kid have blue eyes because you want it to have blue eyes) but that's a bigger debate.  At the same time, Dr. Thomas is right - just like Douglass would not have been who he was had he not been born into slavery, I most likely very much would not be who I am today had I not been born hard of hearing.

Think about it -- if you hadn't been born the way you are, would you be doing what you're doing right now?  That's not a light question, folks."

"event","I wonder what Fatboy Slim listens to when he's having a bad day.  This probably sounds ridiculous to anyone who only knows him as ""that Funk Soul Brother guy,"" but in the UK he's written about in the tabloids as often as the US gossips about Brad Pitt.  In fact, 4 years ago, he and his wife (a famous UK radio DJ) broke up because she had an affair - in the press, it was like a British version of the Nick and Jessica breakup.  They had a kid, too, to make matters more complicated but they did get back together later that year and are still together to this day.  Perhaps happy endings are possible.

In the early 90s, before he was Fatboy, Norman Cook had a group called Beats International and wrote a song called ""Come Home"" that included this verse:
<I>Yesterday my radio came alive
All the words seemed to be about my life
Hearing ""Ain't No Sunshine"" makes me cry
""The Whole World's Down On Me"" and ""For The Good Times""
Come home...</I>


(sigh)


Beats International was a good glimpse at his soul, but the rest of his work over the last 15 years has been nothing but acid house, big beat, tripped out funk, dance remixes, and pure tongue-in-cheek musical fun.  His two latest albums, <I>Late Night Tales</I> and <I>Greatest Hits Remixed</I>, are just more of the same fun that I've been in love with ever since I first saw the video for ""Praise You"" over 10 years ago.  And even better, it gives me something new to listen to instead of the same depressing crap I listen to over and over again - hooray for distractions from myself!    

<U>The liner notes from <I>Greatest Hits Remixed</I>, a hilarious list of each remix:</U>
<B>Redanka</B> - great to have a new version to play out as I am bored titless of the original
<B>Chemical Brothers</B> - they really are my brothers
<B>Plump DJs</B> - welcome to the plump world of breaks
<B>Junkie XL</B> - if it's good enough for Elvis...
<B>Mulder</B> - it started as a bootleg, loved it, legalised it
<B>Timo Maas</B> - Der Englaender hat es wiedermal geschafft
<B>Mike D and Adrock</B> - they are as old and skool as me and you've got to love them
<B>Darren Emerson</B> - loveable chancer - wish he'd used some of the original
<B>Simon's GT Mix</B> - this poor bastard has been locked in a studio with me for 20 years at last he gets to mix one of my tracks his way...
<B>Justice</B> - je ne regret rien
<B>Dave Clarke</B> - the cigar smoking James Bond, shaken and stirred
<B>Xpress 2</B> - apparently there's three of them
<B>Fantastic Plastic</B> - thought they didn't have drugs in Japan
<B>Jon Carter</B> - my mental mentor strikes again
<B>Kid Carpet</B> - I told you modern computers were shit, casios and ataris rule
<B>Chief Xcel</B> - big up the bay area
<B>Midfield General</B> - self indulgent bollocks but he was my label manager
<B>Krafty Kuts</B> - started out selling me records, ended up selling records for me
<B>Switch</B> - Switch is the best thing that's happened to dance music since Daft Punk 


Three years ago, I drove all the way to Toronto on a school night just to see Fatboy Slim.  He was set up in the middle of the dancefloor, so the records would occasionally skip - not a perfect performance by any means, but it was perfect to me.  No alcohol, and I left promptly at the end to be back to work at the morning show, go to class AND work at Blockbuster.  It was one of the happiest nights of my life.

Only thing is, I had no one to share it with.  I mean, I love Fatboy Slim, but has Fatboy Slim ever loved me back?  He did give me a high-five, though."

"event","<P>Everyone has a hero.&nbsp; Mine for the last seven years was in Toronto on Wednesday, November 10th.&nbsp; Yeah, a school night.&nbsp; Toronto's 250 miles from Syracuse, and the event started at 10pm.&nbsp; He was supposed to appear around midnight.&nbsp; And I had class the next morning at 8:30am.&nbsp; No one else wanted or could go.&nbsp; Was I crazy enough to do it?</P>
<P>You bet your ass I was.&nbsp; </P>
<P><lj-cut text=""one of the greatest nights of my life with the barefoot man behind the record...""> </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>First he greeted us warmly with a message scribbled on a record sleeve in that familiar handwriting: ""Hello Torontoes.""</P>
<P><IMG style=""WIDTH: 627px; HEIGHT: 478px"" height=478 src=""http://godeafmusic.com/images/hellotorontoes.JPG"" width=610></P>
<P>And then gave a noisy greeting to the crowd and (kindly) asked the opening DJs to wrap up so he could break the party open:</P>
<P><IMG style=""WIDTH: 654px; HEIGHT: 509px"" height=562 src=""http://godeafmusic.com/images/airhorn.JPG"" width=654></P>
<P>And we gave our own noisy greeting:</P>
<P><IMG style=""WIDTH: 670px; HEIGHT: 472px"" height=538 src=""http://godeafmusic.com/images/crowd.JPG"" width=670></P>
<P>I would be in that picture, but just a couple people to the left out of the frame.&nbsp; It's okay, though, because I've got my own pictures that I took with my cellphone as evidence that I was there.&nbsp; Yeah, with a cellphone, so you can tell how close I was to my hero, the&nbsp;bassist for 80's band The Housemartins, the ringleader of early 90's Beats International, the former one-man acid jazz band Pizzaman, the funkmaster chairperson of mid-90s Freak Power,&nbsp;the man of&nbsp;so many monikers that&nbsp;his name, Norman&nbsp;Cook, is not even his real first&nbsp;name.&nbsp; Let's hear it for <FONT SIZE=""+3""><STRONG>FATBOY SLIM!!!!</STRONG></FONT>:</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://godeafmusic.com/images/letshearit.JPG""></P>
<P>We all went nuts, and then&nbsp;the 43-year old Fatboy&nbsp;proceeded to drop the beats and tweak the freqs:</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://godeafmusic.com/images/dropanotherone.JPG"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <IMG src=""http://godeafmusic.com/images/EQfreak.jpg""></P>
<P>He started off the set with Twisted Nerve -- you know the song if you've seen Kill Bill Vol. 1, it plays when Daryl Hannah goes into the hospital to kill Uma Thurman and then broke into his own ""Build It Up, Tear It Down"", dancing as goofily as we all did:</P>
<P><IMG style=""WIDTH: 664px; HEIGHT: 524px"" height=548 src=""http://godeafmusic.com/images/fatboydances.JPG"" width=664><A href=""http://godeafmusic.com/images/fatboydances.JPG""></A></P>
<P>However, the coolest part of the whole event also became a bit of a problem.&nbsp; If you hadn't noticed, Fatboy's setup is in the middle of the freakin' dancefloor (how cool is that?!).&nbsp; So yeah, I got to be five feet away from him the whole time as I danced like an idiot (by myself, mind you -- I didn't know a single person there), but also because of the way turntables work, the records got jolted every so often from the thumping of people dancing (including Fatboy) and the bass rumbling through the dancefloor.&nbsp; He first tried to get us to stop dancing by writing on a sleeve saying ""what you have to do is stop dancing so the floor doesn't shake"":</P>
<P><IMG height=596 src=""http://godeafmusic.com/images/stopdancing.JPG"" width=685></P>
<P>Yeah, right.&nbsp; Like we're going to stop having the night of our lives.&nbsp; Fatboy conceded and then wrote this response:</P>
<P><IMG style=""WIDTH: 696px; HEIGHT: 566px"" height=653 src=""http://godeafmusic.com/images/icantdance.JPG"" width=885></P>
<P>Despite the occasional record skip because of the grounding problems, he proceeded with the party and doing what Fatboy does best: playing dirty songs.&nbsp; I took this one with my cellphone, he guided us with the lyrics to a remix of his 2000 anthem ""Star 69"":</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://godeafmusic.com/images/whatthefuck.jpg""></P>
<P>He also played another fun and&nbsp;dirty&nbsp;song that just repeated one word:</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://godeafmusic.com/images/motherfuckers.JPG""></P>
<P>God, it was great.&nbsp; He was barefoot the whole time, drank his traditional vodka 'n' oranges (screwdrivers to you American lot), danced as much as he could without jolting the turntables, wrote dirty words on record sleeves and showed them to us, and sang along with the great music that played all night, which included lots of his own great songs such as ""Everybody Loves a 303,"" ""Soul Surfing,"" and a blend of his new noisemaker ""Slash Dot Dash"" over some 80s beat.&nbsp; Other significant songs included a remix of Beastie Boys ""Ch-Check It Out,"" Tom Neville's ""Just Fuck"" (he provided us with part of the lyrics in the picture that's above the cut, in case we didn't get it when it was being repeated throughout the song: 'don't do any drugs, don't smoke cigarettes, don't go at night, JUST FUCK'), The Bangles ""Walk Like An Egyptian"", a remix of Franz Ferdinand's ""Take Me Out,"" not to mention closing the set with Jimi Hendrix's ""Crosstown Traffic.""&nbsp; My favorite musical moment of the whole set was the one we all knew was coming: a 12"" record with no label on it, completely black and only identified by the words written on its sleeve: ""Fucking In Heaven A Cappella.""&nbsp; I screamed when I saw him pull it out, yelled when he put it on the turntable, and cheered when he played that&nbsp;sample any Fatboy fan knows and loves: ""Fatboy Slim is fucking in heaven.""&nbsp; He played the one line only twice, letting the beat cut out so we could all hear it nice and clear.&nbsp; Awesome.</P>
<P>Going back to talking about the set-up, I should probably mention the fact that this show was one of less than a dozen North America tour dates to promote his new album ""Palookaville,"" which is just an all-around awesome CD.&nbsp; I think it just may be my favorite Fatboy record of all time, even though it lacks heavy dance songs -- my favorite track is the one he wrote with Blur's Damon Albarn (and of Gorillaz fame), called ""Put It Back Together"" about his brief seperation with his wife last year.&nbsp; I've tried to see him several times over the years, but never gotten the chance to and now that he's 43, married to British TV/Radio personality Zoe Ball, has a 3-year old son, I may never get the chance to see him again.&nbsp; So I made sure I left my mark, and I did so by honoring the theme of that particular show, which was a tribute to ""Slash Dot Dash"", the second single from the new album which only has four words in it: SLASH DOT DASH and, as the sample gets cut up, it becomes SLASH DOT DASH DOT DASH DOT DASH DOT DOT D-DOT DOT COM.&nbsp; The music video for it is fun (you can see it at <A href=""http://www.mtv.com/bands/az/fatboy_slim/audvid.jhtml"">http://www.mtv.com/bands/az/fatboy_slim/audvid.jhtml</A>), because it's just a guy in a girl in an all-grey room with big fat markers.&nbsp; What do they draw?&nbsp; Well, slashes, dots and dashes of course.&nbsp; As fast as they can.&nbsp; So they set up a white wall and an all-white car on the dancefloor so people could sign their dots and dashes.&nbsp; Here's Fatboy taking a break from DJing and signing the car:</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://www.fatboyslim.net/pics/toronto/3.jpg""></P>
<P>Earlier in the night,&nbsp;Fatboy had written on the front left side of the car ""You lot better have a proper party tonight or else&nbsp;I will kill your parents.......""&nbsp; You can also see how I wrote&nbsp;just a few inches above it: ""DeafGeoff went deaf here.""</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://godeafmusic.com/images/car.jpg""></P>
<P>Much more in line with the music video's theme was the white paper wall they had put up for everyone to sign.&nbsp; I wrote here my own gratifying statement: ""7-YEAR FAN SEEING FATBOY FOR FIRST TIME... DROVE FOUR HOURS ON A SCHOOL NIGHT...""</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://godeafmusic.com/images/slashdotdash.jpg""></P>
<P>A girl who saw me writing it, smiled at me and then told me that that was really cool.&nbsp; Half an hour later, someone else had written, as you can see: ""That's hardcore.""&nbsp; You better believe it.&nbsp; Anything to see the god of DJing, who reaffirmed my faith in him above even Z-Trip.&nbsp; Here's a picture by a Rolling Stone photographer from the same night, showing Fatboy in his ""divine"" form:</P>
<P><IMG src=""http://godeafmusic.com/images/rstone1.JPG""></P>
<P>Oh yeah, and that class I had the next morning at 8:30am?&nbsp; I still went, with maybe an hour's worth of sleep.&nbsp; And I wore my new obnoxiously orange Fatboy shirt proudly, with a permanently goofy grin to match.</P>"

"event","A writer once dreamed an entire poem, word for word, line for line.  When he awoke, he remembered all of it and furiously began copying it down on paper.  He transcribed the words perfectly and was on the last stanza when his wife came in and asked what he wanted for breakfast.  His train of thought broken, the writer lost that last stanza from the dream.  Everything else was remembered perfectly and trying to write a stanza anew would obviously have affected the poem, so he published the poem incomplete.  It's still an amazing poem.


Sunday morning, I awoke from an interesting dream of my own at Tony's cottage in Maine.  I dreamt I was with my SU floormates (Mike, Kelly, Jenn, and Alyssa and maybe others) at a concert.  DJ Z-Trip was spinning and I was trying to enjoy his set at the same time I was trying to explain to my friends how he was mixing all of that live.  I heard some of his usual mixes, like ""Iko Iko,"" all within the dream.  

But then all of a sudden, Z-Trip scratched the intro to Orbital's ""Halcyon + On + On"" and let it play by itself.  This was surprising because it defies Z-Trip's typical genre of music.  So I told everyone to shut up and listen closely to what would come next.  Some beats from Plump DJs' remix of Argonauts' ""Bumper"" emerged, in sync with the haunting piano-based intro to Orbital's classic club anthem, and I was blown away.  <I>I was dreaming my own original mix.</I>

I woke up and instantly wrote down the two songs.  I've started mixing them already and it sounds, well, dreamy.  And cool.  Reminiscient of DJ Tiesto, the man behind the ""In Search Of Sunrise"" mix series.  Expect to hear it on Mixology 303 (when it comes out).  Think about how cool it would be to dream an entire mix CD."

Humanity is an achingly complex body that bears no generalizations or universal truths simply because there are none to be made.  Every single individual person is so frighteningly different from everyone else.  It is a fundamental weakness of the mind to automatically group information and categorize experiences and stimuli -- it is for this reason that a white person may see all black people as being the same.  Or a Jewish person seeing all Buddhists as the same.  Or a feminist seeing all men as the same.  These socially construed groups lead us to victimize large masses of people, either by preconceptions and assumptions or by graver, more genocidic measures.  We simply don't have the psychological strength or time to give every experience and person an equal and fair amount of analysis.  And you know it's true because you call people an asshole if they cut you off on the road -- you have no idea what kind of person they are, where they came from, what their dreams are, whether or not that was the first poor judgment they made behind the wheel in twenty years... -- all you know is they cut you off and you make a characterization.  No one ever says ""well that was a poor decision by that driver, I wonder why they did that.""  It's always a flat-out ""asshole.""  (Or Masshole, depending on the license plate...)

So we group everyone else into a ""them"" category.  What about us?  You can sleep over at the House with your sorority sisters and talk about what an amazing bond you have with all of them.  After all, you're all in the ""pretty girl sorority,"" you MUST be all the same and have so much in common.  Or maybe you feel some strange connection with the guy who sits next to you in class; after all, you both agree on all the same points your professor makes.  Oh, and what about your best friend?  You both had the same type of guy break your heart last year, and have gone through everything together -- you two understand each other and listen indiscriminately always.  And then there's the person of your dreams, the one you love with all your heart and would lay down in traffic for.  Because you think you two are soulmates.

However, we are blind if we don't realize that there are things we will never understand about each other.  We do not have the same memories, the same dreams, the same goals, the same thoughts, the same heart.  You will never fully understand me.  And I will never fully understand you.  I find so many situations where people express deep levels of empathy and compassion, but the lie of it stinks underneath the words.  And the over-assumption of understanding sickens me.  Having one or two similar experiences or traits does not make you the be-all end-all of compassion for the other.  It's important, yes, to do the best we can when someone needs a friend.  But be careful with who you put all your faith in, because that one person you choose will never be someone who understands you fully.  And if you pick one person to depend on, you're asking for something they can't give -- understanding.  

The only one who'll ever understand you completely is yourself.  Depend on the good person that lies within.  If there's any credo to always follow, it's ""I don't believe in Beatles, I just believe in me.""  If we all listened to Lennon a bit more often, then I think we'd have a lot less problems because we'd be making far fewer assumptions and doing less damage to people, and perhaps more importantly, to ourselves."

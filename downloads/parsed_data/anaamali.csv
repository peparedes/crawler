"event","So, some things must go on here, 'cause they're amusing.

First one happened by the dinner table, as she was ranting about how if I moved to back to Israel (like I plan to after highschool) she won't talk to me (which would kill us both) and how she'd talk my parents into not paying for my flight.
After all that, this is how it went:
&nbsp;""Why do you want to live there anyways?&nbsp; The people are not THAT cool.&nbsp; They're like, 'YO YO YO!&nbsp; DRIVE BETTER.&nbsp; GET OUT OF MY WAY.&nbsp; YO YO YO""
""Are you implying all Israeli's are gangsters?""
""...ARG!&nbsp; NO.&nbsp; UH.&nbsp; WHATEVER.&nbsp; I'M TALKING ABA INTO NOT PAYING FOR YOUR STUFF.""

... And the more amusing one.
Read this and keep in mind that Tamar is my tiny 11 year old sister.

She and Inbar were tickling me, and using the fact that there were two of them, that i was on Tamar's meter-off-the-ground bed, and that I didn't want to hurt them to make the most damage.&nbsp; Finally, when I was about to die (I'M REALLY TICKLISH) my dad made them stop and go to bed, but not before Tamar goes...
""You're never going to have sex.""
""WHAT?!...=O...Why not?""
""You're way too ticklish.&nbsp; Some guy'll touch you and you'll just giggle.""
""......... O.O""


MORE!

Sherri is our.. um... downstairs neighbour.&nbsp; She smokes weed.&nbsp; We can smell it.
Today we came home and the house smelled funny and so Tamar, who claims she is funnier when she's sick, which must be true, went, ""Maybe she cooked in her pot.""


My siblings make me laugh."

I think I should never feel bad again.
It'd be nice if I could control that.

Also, I don't like not being able to do more for people, or realizing that, because people can't read what goes on in my head, I can sometimes seem like I'm being a horrible twit, although I can understand exactly why people might think so, and I apologize.


On a strange other note, when I was walking home today, I decided that I really would like to give people flowers.

"event","I figured this was too good of a story to let disappear...

It was one of those rare golden (or blue really... the sun rises late now) where my sisters, namely Tamar, 'cause Inbar was upstairs getting ready, were up before I left the house.&nbsp; Tamar has just gotten glasses, but they gave her a tiny purple case, and I let her use my Pikachu case instead, 'cause it's AWESOME and I never take my glasses off during the day anyways.&nbsp; She gave me the purple one for my pins.&nbsp; Anyhow, she was very very very happy, and I was brushing my hair...

Tamar:&nbsp; I have two Pikachus on Pokemon!&nbsp; (She recently got Leaf Green)
Na'ama:&nbsp; Cool... but didn't you say one of your Pikachus evolved into a Raichu?
Tamar:&nbsp; Yeah... ONE OF THEM IS NAMED YOCHAN.
Na'ama:&nbsp; ...Don't you already have a Buneary named Yochan?
Tamar:&nbsp; Yeah... but that's in the other game...&nbsp; Besides, I had a Pikachu named Yunie, so I had to name the other one Yochan!

It was adorable =)

Then we had another discussion, a few minutes later:

Tamar:&nbsp; This case will remind me of Yunie and Yochan!
Na'ama:&nbsp; Aww!!! =)&nbsp; (So much for remembering the person who GAVE you the case... KIDDING)
Tamar:&nbsp; Haha... My GLASSES will remind me of you!
Na'ama:&nbsp; 'Cause I have glasses?
Tamar:&nbsp; Yup!&nbsp; =)

This is why I manage to love mornings, even though if I'm awake it probably means I didn't get enough sleep ;)"

I missed the crickets when I moved to Canada.
I always miss the crickets.


Behind my grandparents' building (most people live in apartments here), if you go a little bit, is a little park, with a fenced in sand area.
There used to be a playground, with a slide with rollers, the most amazing slide there ever was.
Last year I went looking and they'd taken the slide away.
This year I went looking and they'd taken the playground away.
Now there are only two lonely swings, and a lot of soft&nbsp;lonely sand, fenced in from the rest of the world, with little hope of little pittery feet a-coming to play.


There are a lot of things being taken away this year.
A lot of things to miss."

"event","I just realised, in retrospect, that people might misinterperet the way I go about things, thinking I'm taking things too harshly, or turning it into something of myself.
They do that when people tell them stories that relate.
Maybe some people ARE turning it into themselves, but I think the ones who really care, are just trying to give a piece of their heart, and stories are the way to do it.

I have one other place I write stories, but those are more things I see or think, small things, little pieces of wonder.
I don't like denting that one with so much sorrow.&nbsp; It feels like it might hurt the pages of the book, to have to carry that in one place forever.

That reminds me of&nbsp;a story my aunt told me about myself when I was little.&nbsp; I'm still like that...
When I was very little, and still lived in Israel, my aunt, or my grandparents, bought me a pack of animal crackers, like you would for a little child, because they're fun to play with, fun to look at, and then fun to eat.
I knew you were supposed to eat it.
I picked one up and looked at it for a long long time, but couldn't do anything about it.
I couldn't eat it.
They never bought me animal crackers again.

They did though, by my sisters some a few days ago.
The same thing happened.
I picked one up, and almost cried at the thought of eating such a small little creature that never really got to have a life.
I put it back."

"event","It pains me to think of all the pain in the world.&nbsp; How many people are crying, the big pains, the little pains, all amounting to one huge sorrow.
I sit up late, not falling asleep, wondering why there are such huge holes in so many hearts, and where it goes.
Maybe one day somebody stabbed a hole in somebody's heart, and the poor heart became weak with the sorrowful burdon it was carrying, each day collapsing a little bit, and having to strengthen with the happiness.&nbsp; What if that person had a child, and saw such a beautiful child with such a beautiful living happy heart, and became frightened and angry, at facing a true heart it had forgotten, and not having one of his own?&nbsp; Maybe it couldn't bear to see such a wonderful thing, and stabbed holes in his little child's heart.&nbsp; The poor little child.&nbsp; The poor little heart.
And I see all these hearts, being stabbed, being broken.&nbsp; Maybe they turn into rain, the beating life of a wonderful heart always finding a new place to make life, like the ashes of a volcano, making the purest soil.
It's like I have three bodies.&nbsp; One is full of life, with blood and organs, moving, changing.&nbsp; One is full of little specks of joy, like stars in the sky, but hundreds of thousands.&nbsp; So many specks of joy, from every happy person that ever was or will be,&nbsp;overwhelming me with their wonder.&nbsp; The third holds the holes of peoples' hearts, like the emptiness of space, forever feeling the crevises of sorrow that can never be filled.
And I wonder how I could ever bring a creature into this world, how people manage to ignore all the weeping broken hearts that the world passes on, and create more little things, that have to suffer.&nbsp; But I couldn't not, because it's all I've wanted since I was small, since forever.&nbsp; I wonder if maybe a thousand happy creatures, could sew with thousands of little happy fingers, a golden lining to all the sadness, that would always shine, so you could still smile, even with your room of tears, the room in your heart of life.&nbsp; How I could make a truly happy creature, if I have such&nbsp;a third self?

"event","I want to give the whole world a hug, because if this is how I am after one person, imagine how the whole world must be.
A while ago the world hit me, and it was like a flooding of all of the suffering and upset in the world, but also of all the beauty and amazement in the world.
It made me upset, but it also made me so happy.
But now I can connect the unhappiness to something, and it hurts so much more, because I can see billions of people crying all at the same time, for so many things.
That doesn't mean I'll never be happy again, because I will, and I am, it just means that I'm going to world doubly hard to fix things.

I've tried to explain this before, but here is what I think of my life.
I had this thing in the middle of my life, from about 9 to 13 where I kind of didn't have what I used to, and then some time between 13 and 16 where I was gaining it back, and more.
When I was smaller though, I was pretty much like I am now inside my head, except I only saw the happy amazing parts, and now I see the other side too.
I hope it lasts.&nbsp; The nothingness in the middle wasn't very good.&nbsp; It was fun sometimes, but not as productive.

This all sounds so upsetting and conceited.
I don't know everything, I don't plan on knowing everything, it just feels like I can feel the world sometimes, but there are almost an infinite things that I don't know about it.
I just like it when people are happy."

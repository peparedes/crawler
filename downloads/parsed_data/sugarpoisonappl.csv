if you add me without commenting, and i happen to notice, chances are i won't add you back unless i recognize you
from elsewhere online or lj - this is especially true if your journal is relatively empty and i can't figure out anything
about you from your info page. there are a lot of people i consider friends on here, but i've had to become somewhat
more selective about who i allow to see my thoughts and the goings-on inside of my mind.</center>"

"event","Well its been awhile since I last updated, and the format has changed slightly.  Anyway here's a very brief recap of what's up lately: 

- ive realized how little I really need my computer (thats obvious by lack of updates)

- ive realized how little running really means to me, and i dont really care, it doesnt mean im not workin hard, im just not carin hard - although im racin wednesday in hamilton, so im hopin to pull off somethin decent unlike my last couple outings

- daniella and I are celebratin our two month anniversary on october 19th haha, and considerin im not sure what day of the month it is today, that could be comin up sooner than I think

- upon further review, by lookin at the top of my update page it says it's october 11th, so 8 days...

- ive realized moosehead is capable of gettin u quasi-drunk, if you drink it fast enough, weird


that's all, 
keep on truckin

"event","fuck football, its finally cross season.

ran a 6k in barrie yesterday with the club.  stuart, me and brian won the team title easily finishin 3rd,4th and 8th accordingly.
i was pissed, i could have won this race if it wasnt for a brutal hill we encountered 3 times (once a lap).  unfortunately, considerin my stride is short and choppy, i cant negotiate the quick steep hills as well as i would like too, oh well.

apparently, i have a showdown with matt butters on tuesday at the sir winston invite in st kitts, should be fun, if im loose and recovered from yesterdays race. we seem to be in similar shape right now, but ill definitely have his number by SOSSA which is on october 26th if all goes well.

umm, this weekend was pretty cool overall, no complaints.
throat givin me some problems early on, but im feelin better, just waitin for daniella to get off work so we can talk before school tomorrowww


anywayyyy, all is well

take care,

of course !!!


this may have been the most exhilirating hockey game i've ever witnessed.  the czech republic is the team i hate the absolute mostt in hockey and i'd be postin some pretty suicidal thoughts had they beat us tonite.  

but holy fuck, vincent lecavalier scores a beauty goal to end it in overtime.  fuckin awesome game, luongo was solid in net thank god and even tho we didnt play our best, it was enough in the end to overcome the hated czechs.

now we play the finns on tuesday night in the final, daniella and I will be doin some pretty rowdy celebratin if all goes well...

GO CANADA GO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

started the month off with an incident at registration with baumer, i forgot all my forms, he forgot to get his signed. bottom line, lots of drivin, lots of swearin.  not used to gettin up at 8am at home in the summer, and it confirms my reputation as not bein a morning person.  but i have no real hard classes so i wont complain for long.  yeaa media studies.

gettin lots of hours at the theatre lately, bein a supervisor is schweet.  first drivin lesson is tomorrow, then i have a work barbecue to eat at, then i work all night and then they're screenin some new movie, im not in the loop though so i dont know what were gettin.

world cup started, and Canada is currently doin quite well, clutch win over USA last night and a blowout win over slovakia tonight bodes well. russia on saturday and then the playoff round.

went to wonderland on monday with katie, steph and pat, had a wicked time.  got front seat on vortex and top gun which was wickeddd and the new tomb raider ride was crazy too.  i also sunk a 3pointer at the bball game to win this giant 4 foot long stuffed fish.  shes a keeperrr

anywayyy, not much else to say other than go canada."

"event","ok this will be part two of the cottage debacle.  i have some time now to write before i go to brock to play some squash with paul and then i have to work.

anyway, i did race on sunday in the city of brockville in a 5k.   it was definitely easier than i expected, and that showed in my time of 18:25.  i took over the lead after 1km and just cruised the rest of the way on a very hilly and longer course.  i had no pain at all which is a great sign and finished strong to win by over a minute. if you dont believe me, here's some proof bitches http://www.sportstats.ca/res2004/10005.htm

anyway, on the way to brockville, i made sure to look at that famous fence pat ran into in july and low and behold, there was a MASSIVE deformation at the spot he hit. you can literally see the mould of his bodyw when it hit the fence.

other than that, it was a chillin time.  caught some nice large mouth to add on to the 9 or 10 pike that we slayed.  like i said, it'd been 3 years since i'd nabbed a pike there and to catch so many in so little time was a shock.  

also got some good football games in with the family and drove the boat without a top for the motor for the last half of the trip since the cord wasnt recoilin and i had to do it manually everytime.  the weather was pretty chilly but its still a great feeling to wake up to the lake.  i have a pic of that lake which is the last thing i look at everynight before goin to bed and to see the lake in the mornin firsthand up there was kinda mind blowing.

the olympics were a dissapointment, i wont get started on that til later but its a real shame.  i stayed up to watch the entire triathlon last night live, which didnt end til 5.  whitfield got 11th, but ran a gutsy race so im satisfied with that but most of the rest of the canadians have been suckin this year in most olympic events.

anyway, i gotta run to brock for squash

"event","well, unfortunately im back from the cottage.  i had a great time and realized how much better it is there than it is here.  i hate the city.  i just hate it, theres somethin about a country road that is that much more inviting and relaxin and i swear i will eventually end up in a place like that.

***warning: these next paragraphs are all fishing related, so unless ur bored or u enjoy fishing, u dont have to read the rest***

anywayy, we got there friday afternoon, pat and I went fishin right away and got shut out haha.  to add to that, the motor's cord snapped as i was pullin it so i had to row all the way back to the cottage, about 1500m against current, not good times.  rowing didnt come naturally to pat so he was my coxie and tellin me when to straighten up since my weight was shiftin horribly.

the next day (saturday) was much better.  now u have to understand it had been a little over THREE YEARS since i had last caught a pike on my lake.  its a horrible drought and i was anxious to end it soon.  as fate had it, i caught a smallish one, to end the streak, i was so relieved.  then my very next cast, a huuuuge pike jumped at my lure and missed. i could tell it wasnt hungry, just pissed off, kinda tellin the lure to get out.  i casted at it again and it lunged at it and missed again.  i thought one more time should do it and i was right, i set the hook mass hard and pulled him towards the boat.  pat showed this pike the net a little too early and it took off, i was doin a gymnastic act by tryin to keep this guy from goin under the boat and snappin my line and pat finally got the net on it and we landed it.  

i was shakin in the boat just tryin to get the lure outta this guy, and time was tickin.  i eventually got him on the stringer, let him regain his senses for a while and brought him back home to show everyone.  
donnie put the digi scale on him, and he came out at 5 and a half pounds.  which made that pike the biggest one caught outta the pond so far this year.  i ran over to my uncle larry's two doors down and asked for his cage.  i brought it back, and we put it under the dock because there was a fishing derby the next day for all the lakes in the area, and this sucker had a chance.

then my luck turned sour.  not 6 hours later, i can see my uncle larry and his nephew jim on our dock lookin into the cage.  i left my cottage to join them and i just thought they were lookin at my beautiful fish...wrong.  jim had just caught the absolute biggest pike in the lake's history, no doubt.  11 pounds! exactly double the weight of my fish.  imagine what im thinkin here, i had just caught the biggest fish of the year 6 hours earlier and now the exact same day, someone catches the biggest one ever.  after reviving this mother, we put him in the cage with my pike.  2 hours later, my pike was on its belly, it died from stress of bein in a cage with a fish twice its size i assume.  and thats when the snappin turtle comes in.   it smelt the dead pike and was circlin the cage.  it was dark by now, so we needed flashlights, i was thinkin i could revive my fish so i was holdin it in the water, and just chattin away with my cousin when the turtle came to within 3 inches of the fish, and i immediately pulled it out, scary shit.  i told my uncle larry to take this fish to the derby anyway, but since it was still breatin a little bit, he whacked it against one of our trees, puttin it out of its misery.

the next mornin, i was up early since i was racin in brockville (a race i won handily by the way)  and i checked on the big fish in the cage.  to my surprise, the cage was fuckin EMPTY.  gone.  no trace of it.  just to clarify though, no one from our cottage took it and released it and larry and jim did not take it either.  so it was either stolen or it somehow esacaped this cage with its pike acrobatics (sarcasm).  the latter seemed like the best option since a neighbour said they saw a very large pike in the weeds, in distress a day or two later not far from our dock.  who knows, but thats how the story goes.  

larry was upset.  jim was upset.  i felt bad but with this twist of faith, my original 5.5 pound pike won 2nd prize and 50$ cash at the derby so that was cool.

holy fuck that took a long time to tell, ill go on about the rest of the trip later i guess... shit

later,

im pretty bored, its too hot to run this afternoon so ill update now and run after work tonight.  

headin back up to the cottage on friday morning.  bellamy's pond is gonna be a packed house with just about my whole immediate family stayin in within 2 cottages of everyone. i pushed hard to the chiefs to get baumer to come along, but to no avail since there is a horrible  lack of room to sleep and the fact that my whole family together gets on each others nerves within 36 hours.  no worries baumer, next year is a guaranteed certainty, ur gonna see what real large mouth fishing is like.  hee ha

got my haircut earlier today, its much thinner and much shorter than im used to seein it, but its all good. 

im racin for the first time since ofsaa track this sunday in brockville.  just an easy 5km, not expectin much but i should be in the front pack challengin to win this thing.  you can get the results on http://www.sportstats.ca hours after the race unfolds haha.  

went to wonderland with some buddies from work on monday, it was pretty schweet. it was packed but everyone had a good time and i didnt vomit, which was clutch.  im goin back with katie, one of her friends and pat on the 30th so its all good.

anyway, im workin at 530, last shift before vacation so thats a nice feeling.

ummm, i got promoted at work last week! i am now a concession supervisor, haaha oooh.  and the only supervisor to be under 18 so thats kinda cool.  more money, more hours so it's a win win situation.

i closed at work 4 straight nights from wednesday to saturday, that took quite a bit out of me, but i was still good to attend ribfest yesterday afternoon/night, as it was packed with ppl and everyone was havin a good time.  i managed to down about 2 pounds of fudge, bought a fake rolex for 10 dollars and a new pair of shades for 5.  and oh yea, the ribs were pretty tasty.  cheers to ribfest!  jeers to me spillin beer all over the table at ribfest.

today rob and I went to see anchorman, fuckin hilarious movie, the previews dont really do it justice.  we also got into a lil food fight with some 14 year old loser chicks, capped off by a classic baumer type line ""what the fuck do you need a purse for, you're 10"".  that prompted a freak out which is always funny to watch.  i dont know if the other ppl in the theatre appreciated our frequent bickering but what evvv, we went to hit some balls after and cranked a couple down the range.

i worked tonite, saw a whole bunch of ppl i know or havent seen for a while.  a little rivalry between me and Matt Butters is startin to brew, as he was talkin smack about cross country next year haha, he's a good kid, but i cant wait to beat him.  

also, speakin of fuckin running, i have to volunteer at the olympic club's invitational meet tomorrow night...should be aiite i guess.  i havent been to the club since the end of may so i have to catch up with some ppl as well.

"event","hey hey, i have returned from my cottage vacation with nothin but good things to say.  it's so wicked to get away, comin home just sucks, but i wont get into that...

anyway, as always, i spent a lot of time fishing with pat, donnie, my dad and my uncle greg.  unfortunately, the hot weather made it tough to rape the waters but we came out ok.  pat got the biggest one of the week, 4 pound and 1 ounce large mouth, that was sweet.  my biggest one was a 2 and a half pound large mouth but i lost a couple other decent sized fish.  i also nabbed a perch that tipped the scales at well over a pound so that was a beautyy.  pics to come laterr

when i wasnt fishin, i sure as hell was havin a hard time motivatin myself to train.  i did a couple easy runs but nothin more and i basically sat around and drank either pepsi or moosehead.  my gut is developpin once again, i balooned from 142 lbs to 153 tonite so that weight has to come off, i look rough.  i haven't really shaved for almost a month?!? i've lost track so i look pretty rugged.  

friday night, we lit off 200 bucks worth of fireworks for no real reason at all but it was still cool.  donnie lit one and tried runnin off the dock, but in the process, he shook the dock so hard the firework fell and started shootin every which way at the crowd haha. fortunately, our fuckin paddleboat blocked two shots headed for everyone sittin down, thefore savin us a couple visits to the burn unit at the smiths falls hospital haha.

we had a family reunion on saturday in brockville and as is my family's tradition, everyone got hammered, fast.  so once everyone was hammered, pat and i started gettin into my dad's molson dry (beauty) and donnie's moosehead again (he didnt care) and just played fusebol, pinball and shuffleboard all night with random ppl in the livin room of this mansion where the party was.

the drive back to the cottage goes along highway 29, and its about 40 minutes.  we stopped 4 times for ""vomit breaks"", not one of them for me but i got out, right infront of the OPP station, since i needed to take a piss.  pat got outta the van too and decided to run in the open field beside the police station.  of course, he was goin full speed and didnt realize there was a wired fence blockin his way so he ran smack into it, fell back and was out for a while.  he got a few bad cuts on his arms and face but was fine the next day haha.  brutal.

we left the cottage on monday and headed out to the bay of quinte area where my cousins aunt has a house on the edge of lake ontario.  it was also a fuckin mansion, i felt very uncomfortable the whole time but i snagged 10 good sized perch in an hour of fishin off the rocks, so that was aiite.

we drove home today, and its back to fuckin reality for now at least.  beautiful.  i gotta get this weight off so ill be tryin to train half decently hard these next few weeks since i look like a train wreck.  

did i mention i saw the biggest fuckin snappin turtle ive ever seen the first night at the cottage.  incase u didnt know, i already hate bein in that area late at night, due to past experiences, but that put me right off.  i didnt go near that area the whole week cuz like fuck, this turtle was massive, about twice the diameter of this computer screen.  

either way, thats all for now, if i remember anythin good ill be back but right now i need to visit the couch."

i have a new found respect for the drummer of the hip too - i forget his name - but he was poundin hard all night and really backboned the whole show.

i was there with 3 of my cousins - katie, maryse and pat.  the ppl behind us were kind enough to let me and pat have a couple drags of their joint during blow at high dough. it was all in all a great show, decent sound for an outdoor venue and the place was absolutely packed to the bone.  even the lawn had no room on it i saw.

anyway, the past two nights i've slept for 12 hours a piece.  but this afternoon i woke up with a nasty pain in my shoulder and my lower neck. i think it's strained or somethin, not sure how it happened, but it obviously happened as i was sleepin since that's all ive done lately more or less.  

today, i finally got the chance to re-line all my fishing rods. it may seem boring but somethin about fishin just triggers a passion for me and i love it, wayyy more than i love running but unfortunately, u cant get a scholarship by catching fish so im forced to train and kill my body day after day to get my post-secondary schooling payed for. (cross your fingers)

Oh yeaaa and whether or not i mentioned it before, who the fuck cares, but im seeing the hip july 1st, yeaahhhh, fuckin right

let's hear it for summer ehh, 
later folks

ummm, finished the two harder exams today - sociology and english, think i did pretty well in both.  
got french listening exam and presentation tomorrow then im running home since I have no ride, all i have are my legs, which arent so fit right now anyway but what ev
friday is the open book history exam, so im obviously very worried about the outcome of that...

summer plans are up in the air as far as some things but I am going to see the hip in toronto on july 1st so im pumped for that.  also should be up fishin at my cottage, on the rideau, and on charleston lots this summer, hopefully i can bring in something massive.

olympic club isnt too pleased that i backed out of running nationals at the end of july in saskatoon.  haha, no way im payin big money to run there, the competition usually blows anyway since many ppl, like myself, dont wanna go to saskatchewan to run.  im still pumped up about gettin a good summer of trainin in, next year im gonna hopefully dominate, hopefully.


thats all for now i suppose,

school is so close to bein done!!  looking at every angle, this summer seems promising. 
im also goin to see the tragically hip july 1st in toronto and plannin to see rush august 22nd as well.

"event","finally!

thats all I can say is finally.  

my 1500 yesterday was horrendous, i false started (yea I did) and i dont wanna talk about the rest.

the 3000 was what I was aiming for and it took top 4 to qualify for OFSAA.  Scull took off from the start and never was challenged winning in 8:46.  I took over 2nd place with a little less than 3 laps to go, not my smartest move but I knew somethin had to be done.  I was still in 2nd until the last lap when I started to labour.  Steeds passed me and Blair passed me as well.  I looked back to see where 5th place was and he seemed too far away to catch me.  I was wrong.  With 200 to go, i could hear ppl screaming at me ""dont look back, he's comin hard"".  i could see him from the corner of my eye and i kept lookin back (not a good idea).  he got right onto my shoulder and i thought i was toast but somethin made me push faster and i just nipped him at the line.  
1st place was in his 5th year, 2nd place 4th year, 3rd place 4th year and 5th place was 5th year which makes me the first 3rd year runner to finish!  i ran a personal best of 9:01.74, 1 seconds than last week.  


woooo, am i relieved, greatest race of my life, no doubt!"

"event","Yeaaa, so today was SOSSA.  A very important meet for me and my ""fragile"" confidence.

Weirdly, two decent competitors - Tim Serre (still ringing from last week ahha) and Pat Cook came up with injuries and didn't compete at all.

Anyway, so I lined up in the 15.  Jeff Scull (the king) and Blair Paul took the pace out so fast but I stuck with them.  We were all together with 500m to go when Scull made a break, no way we could go with him. I passed Blair with 400 left, he passed me with 300 left and with 200 left I made one more surge and dropped him crusing into the finish in a personal best time of 4:12.  Silver medal !! yeaaa

Later in the day came my best event, the 3000m.  Again, I was not thinking about winning cuz that would mean trying to beat Scull which is near impossible.  But again, Scull, Blair and I went out together, midway thru the race Scull made his move and pulled away.  Next it was my turn as I pulled away from Blair and ran the last half of the race alone.  I held off a charging Mark Steeds from Hamilton as I shut it down basically on the last lap.  Another silver and tied my personal best of 9:17.

Next week is the big show at WestPark - South Regionals

Expectations for myself :

1500m - Whatever happens, happens
3000m - 3rd

Next stop - OFSAA ?"

Although Tim Serre outkicked me in a wild finish in our 1500m earlier in the day, I finally executed my game plan the way I wanted to.

Midway through the 3000m, I tried one surge to get him off my shoulder, no luck.  I tried again, no luck, he was sticking right on me and actually took the lead.  I decided I would give it one more shot and went for it again.  He sustained my pace again, but not for long as he started to drop off with 3 laps remaining.  I cruised into the finish for my first ever individual zone title.  Coming into this race he had won all previous 9 Zone races (cross country & track) so it feels good to finally get him.  

Next week will be good - SOSSA.

1500m - 3rd

ran a blazin 4:14 1500m yesterday, good enough for 9th and a 6 second personal best.  actually took the lead early on, got cut off, both feet went off the track, but luckily no officials noticed and i didnt get DQ'd.  real big confidence boost.

was havin a horrible sleep at the hotel last night when i was rudely awakaned by the fire alarm.  15 minutes before it stopped, horrible.  cops and fire trucks came but as far as i know, it was a false alarm.

up at 7 this mornin to get to the track bright and early for brian's 2km steeplechase race.  i was really pumped cuz this was supposed to be a big confidence boost for him.  brian cleared the first hurdle fine, running in 3rd place goin to the dreaded water jump.  he got one foot on the barrier and his other knee absolutely smashed into it, sendin him 6 feet in the air, doin a total front flip in the process and landin flat on his back in the freezin cold water.  i duno how he didnt get stepped on, but fortunately he got up fast, but collapsed again.  diagnosis = negative. his school season is toast and i have no training partner for the indefinite future.  however, it could have been a lot worse. he went to the hospital right away, and is on krutches, hopefully he recovers fast.  

so that incident really dented my focus for my 3000 later in the day - 3 of us broke away from everyone.  one of them, my archrival - rob brown just decided to quit half way thru and cut me off in the process. i lost touch with the leader, never recovered and settled for a silver medal in a sluggish 9:23, ouch. wind was brutal throughout, couldnt really get anythin goin and my head wasnt totally in it like usual.  

overall, a decent weekend though, good times more or less and my confidence is improvin daily.

missed my alarm completely this mornin (set for 730am) and woke up at 845. hopped in the van with my dad and set off to jordan just in time to get registered. 

met up with AP and Brian on the warmup, had a couple good laughs before the race, and then it was go time.
me and brian went out together at a pedestrian pace, splittin thru 3k in 10:00.  i tried to make a move, but brian was better on this day, as we cruised into the finish 10th and 11th overall, 2nd and 3rd in our age group, behind the legend - AP haha.

brian ran 16:45, i ran 16:55, a personal best by 33 seconds, beauty!  AP pushed the pace infront of a really good african runner for the first 3k and then the african started to pull away. AP coasted it in 15:25, crazy fast time.

after the race, the organizer told me im the first runner from thorold to break the 17 minute barrier that he can recall - so thats decent.

after the race, i got to be in the middle of the first (of many most likely) Club vs School Coaches confrontations...frankly its just an annoyin situation with one major double standard that I wont even go into detail with.

seems about accurate...and im worth more than toni apparently, haha


anyway, good workout on thursday, 10x400m. slowest was 66.5, fastest was 63.5 seconds, so its all good.
racing tomorrow (today) at 10am in the jordan 5k, should run faster than my somewhat embarassing 17:28 5k PB. not expectin anythin superb tho since im not a terrific road racer.

this weekend seems a little bit more promising than last, hopefully that holds true.  worked a double today, made just under 200 dollars total (holiday) for doin basically nothin.  played some pool with mike and ed in between shifts at pendale billiards, sweet place i never even knew existed.

"event","so i had the first really bad workout in about 2 months tonight...it was 4x1000m

target time was 2:57. i was right on 2:57 on the first one, second one was 2:59 which is ok but the last two were bad. stuart and brian pulled away with about 250m to go on each one and i finished in 3:06 both times...hurting cuz ive been dominatin workouts lately.
recovered somewhat doing 6 x 200m afterwards but still it wasnt impressive. me and bowden went all out on the last one and i collapsed to the track right after crossin the line. i then crawled to the infield and vomited whatever was left of my large chocolate milkshake earlier on in the day...big mistake. it happens I guess, knees were buckling a lot, probably from the bike so we'll ease off of that a bit.

my eye is also infected (not seriously) but im not goin to school tomorrow so I will spend the day doin absolutely nothin most likely...and lots of sleep with an easy workout mixed in somewhere.

that's about it, neighbourhood was good today and oh yah i have a great new locker in the geo hallway. and neighbourhood was good today.

"event","So I just realized we're exactly two months away from possibly the biggest race of my life, the race injury prevented me from getting too last year. The race that is potentially an instant ticket to free education in the US of A.

SOUTH REGIONALS, 3000m - May 28th, 2004 at the West Park Track, St.Catharines

It's gonna be after school, so book the day off work now, you won't be dissapointed, trust me.

7.5 laps of guts. 

Years of hard work culminated into about 9 minutes of work.

"event","well i've had some good sleep time this weekend to recover from last week. legs always seem to be sore, which i'm used to and my jaw doesnt feel right but other  than that, i feel good.

my cousin pat turned 18 today! happy birthday buddy! were celebratin his birthday as well as my cousin andrew's (24) and my father (49) today at my aunts. should be good. my two cousins and I are huge Duke fans so we shall cheer em on to victory today over Xavier to get to the Final Four.

so yesteday im just lookin over the start lists for this race at eastern michigan university where jeff, blair and tim are running. as i look at the two mile list, i see Tim's name. the school he's listed under turns out to be Myer...or to be totally specific ""A.N. Meyer"". turns out his bonehead coach doesnt know what school he goes to or how to spell my school. i think Mr. Hinton gets us confused a lot but its really quite simple to tell the difference. I don't like Mr. Hinton at all, Tim is indifferent...easy enough ?!? dumbass, im glad i dont train with that coach cuz i would be a miserable mess day after day...

well im gonna go for a run and then hop in the shower before the party...

cheers,

last night was pretty eventful

first went to practice, ran 5x600m all in around 1:44 or 1:45. also 5x300m, all around 0:48. good practice which prompted coach galloway to predict the following : 
""there is no way you will lose at (south) regionals. you're gonna surprise yourself and crush blair (paul) and surprise tim (serre)""

coming from mr. galloway, it's shocking because he's usually very quiet and reserved. he just gave me more motivation to train hard and win the South. May 28th 2004 - that's the big day!

anyway, after that went to game 4 of thorold - niagara falls jr b. series. thorold won 4-0 and won the series in 4 straight games. i was pumped. thorold arena crammed 2200 people inside. the coach of the falls, terry masterson aka most hated man left the bench and did not even shake hands with thorold after the game, wat a dick.

after that me and ciofi went to mcdonalds and then to the theatre for his big retirement match with russell. it went to a 3rd and deciding game where ciolfi pulled thru 7-4. russell wasnt happy but a deal' a deal. as the #1 contender, i got a shot at ciolfi but lost 7-5 - it was an epic defensive battle, i just couldnt capitalize on my oppurtunities.

then they showed that new tom hanks movie, ladykillers - it was horrid and a waste of time.

got home at 2am, went to bed and went to school today. the 100% still lives in history but it's in jeopardy after a homework quiz today. i may have missed sometin - i cant remember.

after school, before the bus it was weird times, i wont even explain but if things develop i will get back to yall on that.

worked tonight, got off early (930) and now im gettin ready to watch Duke play Illinois. gonna be a good one.

practice in the mornin at the track, not lookin forward to it but wat ya gonna do ehh 


later,
rocket"

My walls are caving in, 

Darkness smothers me. 

I have no where to turn. 

I have no one to help me. 

No one wants to save me.

They can't see the pain reflected in my eyes. 

They can't see that any moment I might collapse. 

Collapse in sorrow, in anger, and in pain.""

The young man frowned, blinking hard.

""I wish someone would see the pain I am in. 

I wish I could be held by protective arms while I collapse. 

I wish I could just be held, 

But for now I will wait for the walls to collapse.

I will wait for protection that will never come. 

I will wait for friendship, I will wait for love.


The things you find when tired."

"event","I am feeling much better now. I have been able to somewhat balance myself out now. I am really enjoying my fencing class. But I wish I was fencing with someone else. My class on soil is well dirty. I am learning how different types of soil and what organisiums in the soil effect the flavor of the grapes. I think my archery is slowly improving but would be better if I had a better teacher but he is off fighting some war. I wish it was his arms around me guiding my hands instead of one of the aids. I also miss hearin his voice but i think that longing is one of the reasons I am still holding on well that and my son. I think he will make me proud someday when he becomes a redcap around and I need to be here to make sure he becomes the right kind of redcap. He needs to be ashamed to be what he dreams are but to not be afraid to face the consequences of his actions. I till owrry about how I effect my humans life but have come to the understanding that she needs me as much as I need her. I think I let her let go. I think what i see influneces her. I have seen the art she draws. I can see Avalon and Drake in pictures. I even see HIM. HE is her knight in shining armor. I think that we may both want the same thing and if it is the last thing I do I will give her a taste of that knight. I will make our dream come true."

"event","It is so bright it hurts my eyes. My ears ring with the sounds. But my heart feels so cold. Everything is so hard to focus on. It is a little too much. Like walking from a darkened prison cell into the bright sunlight. I fight for every second now. But it so bloody cold. It is like the warm of this place can not seem to hold me. I have tasted death before and it is always bittersweet but never like this. It is like when the lights come on at the end of movie you can not quite see the screen any more and it starts to fade from your mind. I feel the cold trying to numb me away but I wil not give up. I will be warm again and I will love the colors and sounds again they will be real to me again not just tissue paper and lights. I will be able to see again like a blind man who is granted sight it will come and I will wait."

"event","What is it about fall and dying? I mean I have yet to have a friend die in spring. Is it a preview of the future or just pretelling of the future. We changling fear the up coming Winter we think it brings death the end of us. What if it is instead just fear of changing? Dream will never end they will always continue they just change. Like a infant becoming a child, a child to becoming a teenager, the teenager giving way into young adulthood, adult progressing into old age and death but it continues. We pay a price for the change but we get something equal in return. Are not the dreams of elder as stronger if not stroger then the very young. We once long ago survived a great change. We adapted and learned a new way. Maybe it is time to once again change. Fall is the time of prepartion for change. Do we just sit and try to push the seasons back or do we accept and prepare. It is the time to make choices. To give into Hope or give into Fear."

"event","Well, Krieger has managed to make an utter mockery of my honor which kind Jason was gentlemanly trying defend. Because Jason could not fight the duel at court on saturday it went to Jason's second Crush to fight the duel. Well, I do have to admit now that I have calmed down that Crush was more then willing to fight Krieger but then Crush is a redcap like myself so given a chance most red caps will not turn down a good fight. Any ways for some reason probably because he was a facing a redcap Krieger ran. Crush described it that he ran like a yellow bellied coward with his tail between his legs or from Highwinds point of view he ran like a coward with a dildo between his legs. Anyways the blueberry decided to re-challenged Crush and Crush accepted but Krieger decided he need a champion and he chose Andre. Now I really respect Andre, he willing to do the dirty jobs in this world so I hated to see him end up in this farce. Crush and Andre for some reason known only to these two decided to fight the duel with scabbards not the swords. At the time I was pissed but know I can sit and laugh afterall in the end it showed that the champions realized that blueberry had made a circus of the duel and that it had lose it worth. Needless to say I will never again let a duel be done over my honor because as one person pointed out to me that my honor is not how others see me but how I see myself. So I have learned that no matter what I am what I was before Rose di Falco a redcap . And that Krieger is not worth another entry in my LJ"

"event","Well let me put it this way I read Kat post and then took a nice long walk to prevent damage to my keyboard. During this walk I had a lot to think about. Who I am. What I am. What am I going to do. I am going to fall banality soon it is just a matter of time before it creeps up on to me. I mean look around me I just realized that Avalon has grey hairs already and I have quite a few myself. How do I want to spend my time. Do I want to fade and whither away like flower or do I want to burn like a wild fire. A wild fire is remembered after it is gone. It is sometimes hate and feared but remembered. I want to be remember. I want to feared, respected and  loved but since my chances for loved and respected are slim I think I will settle for feared. and Eeon mind your own god damned business."

"event","Well this year is like none I have ever been through before. I did not compete in a single event and wore a dress with the stupid fishnet nelons and 2 inch hells that swished my toes and left nasty blisters. Why all the woman in my family wear all the stupid shit is beyond me but I  have to say it gave me new respect for my mother who is never seen in anything but 3 inch hells. Because I try to be honest and truthful, I will say it was kind of fun to see the looks of appreciationand the looks of surprise when it hit them that I was wearing a dress. 
Anyways back to the real meat of the evening. I got to watch and help judge the Joust. It is almost as wonderful to watch as to compete. I even got to feel what it is like to have a champion in the event. I will go into it later why I had a champion but right now I want to feel the wonderfulness that is the joust for me. The smell of the horses and the fear of the riders. The sounds of the crowd how load at the start of the ride but how still and quiet it seems to get when the rider's lances smash into each other. The smell of the blood of the defeated and the triume of the vitoriuos. I wish there were joust more often.

How did a redcap end up with a champion?
Well, It is a long story but I think a interesting one. It started out with me seeking out Kriger. I went to ask him if we could have a truce for a single evening. He gave no response which menas he either was being an asshole and ignoring me or he did not hear me. O well I will never know because I do not trust Kriger to tell the truth now. Anyways, I was walking about talking to people try to enjoy myself and act like a lady. Did I do a good job of acting the part? I heard a nasty rumer and decided to go to the horse mouth to find out if it was true. So I found Eeon and got his attetion in the redcap way because he was battling someone but it was a duel or part of the Pennons so I felt I could just but in. I just gave him a quick kick to the jewels Eeon took it like a redcap and we talked. I was a bit pissed when were done but hell I had the right so it does not mater. Back to the story, Hope's troll brother was helping me get my cape back on when. Kriger jumps in front of Eeon, Jamie, and Crunch. He says something and waves his arms and nothoing happens then he turns and runs away. I draw my boot blade and head around the corner to catch him on the otherside. Thinking that shit is goign to hit the fan and that my Kithmates are about to end up in brawl with the stupid troll and I know Eeon is most liking not up to snuff do to dueling early in the evening. When I drew my blade that I was breaking an oath to a friend that I would not fight or compet on Pennons but theses are my brothers at arms and well I am not goign to let them get hurt dress ,nelons, and my word be damned. When I get around the corner the troll is gone and the mens bathroom door is swinging and the boys are tearing into the men's bathroom. I follow and on the other side we run into a pack of people and Kriger. Everyone starts yelling and it get really noisey. I figure this offense is going to get handle by words now. So I start to put my daggar back. It was then I noticed that I had run the damn nelons. I spent 10 buck on the f*cking things and then a good ten mintues wrestling into the horrible things so I got even more pissed. And then it hit me what I had done. I had just broken my word bond to Lady Greywind. I had drawn a blade and prepared to fight on Pennons. I just lost it. I wanted justice or at least some blood for all the sh*i that had happened. After being talked down all I wanted was an apology. For Kriger to say ""I am sorry threw your words in your face"", "" I am sorry I was so stupid for thinking I could attack people on Pennons"" Hell, I would have settled for just a "" I am sorry"" even with out the heart felt feeling behind it. I was insulted really insulted and an redcap will tell you. If you piss off a redcap it is a bad thing but a girl re d cap make sit worse because when a girl   redcap starts looking of revenge it is  a bad thing. It is  time to go into protective custody. But it got worse for me I st arted to cry honestly cry something I have not done in a long while. It must have been all the after noons with my mother and her lectures on how to be a lady. Because I was so hurt. I got all dressed up and it took a lot to get me in that shape and then I broke an oath and I could not compete in the Joust. It just hit me bad, The next thing I know Jason the satyr is willing to challenge Kriger for my honor. I have insulted this satyr so many times that I can not remember them all and he is still willin got defend my honor. It was so sweet and touching. I felt all womanly. I thing I understnad what a girl is suppose to see in a knight or in Jason case a knight in training.
I am goign to skip the next little while of pennons because I talked to a lot of people and do not have thier permission to disclose what I talked to them about. Anyways after the wonderful Joust. Congrads again to Sid. Jason challenged Kriger to a duel. Kriger declined he did nto even really listen. He just walked off. SO when the awards ceromony came about Jason declared Kriger to be a coward for not being willing to duel him over my honor. I had to control the urge to bat my eyes and beam at my champion. He looked so knightly with all that righteous indignation. So Krieger finally agreed to the duel which is suppose to take place next gathering wow it was a emotional evening."

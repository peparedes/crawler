"event","ok, so maybe i DID need more than 10 minutes of sleep ((everytime i started to drift off, i either felt bad for falling asleep or ruth's cough snapped me back to wakefulness)). i ended up sleeping 7 hours after i wrote the last entry. then i woke cause of kim txting me at 2 a.m. and fell back to sleep for 3 more hours after kim said she was going to bed. 

3 people this past week have told me i'm cute, 2 votes for pretty, and 2 votes for beautiful. everyone, go to the omptomitriste ((sp?)). 

mum's friend gave her a car. so she gave it to me. it needs work. lmao, it really does. but like it matters, i have to go to driving school ((lowers your insurance)) before mum will let me go for my license and all.

"event","so yeah, i am dating someone extremely awesome now. but i'm scared that i'm going to fuck things up and hurt her like i always end up doing. ::sigh:: wonder if she even remembers the fact that i'm still dating christie...

i think i was claimed by these 2 guys in class today...i was half asleep so i know i agreed...wonder if they were serious. 

we had a lockdown at school today. this pakistan man came into the school and didn't know english so of course, they freaked out. assholes. good thing we had a teacher that knows how to speak the pakistani ((SP?)) language. 

um, i have yet again not been sleeping well and i've been thinking entirely too much.

"event","ok so, the whole schooling thing at phoenix, i'm still not sure about. i haven't talked much to any of my friends lately and i think it'll probably end up staying that way. i have become to realize that a lot of my friends that used to be precious to me are now just annoying and are starting to piss me off. i told grunk the other day that i'm not going to be sitting with the flunkies anymore during lunch and she got really weird. i don't see why, she said she doesn't love me anymore. i don't think she really ever did. i really want to make some new friends and to get some new people to date and everything. i no longer find anyone interesting. i know too much about them and their stupid ways and dirty, fucked up habits. 

i'm getting really fucking antsy. i can't stand going too long without traveling. and it's been since like last summer since i've been anywhere. i need to get out of GA. i'm going stir crazy being here. 

guess what folks, i might be starting my own little lit mag or something. i'm most likely going to be posting some of my poetry in random places around school and downtown atlanta. why? because i can.  

it hailed or sleeted or snowed or some shit this morning. it started last night. the ground was white this morning when i got up. they called me in early to work and i got out at 5 cause they decided to close the store early so everyone could get home safe. 

one of the guys i like is going to be proposing to his ex next year after he graduates. damn. on a lighter note though, 2 of the other guys i like have been paying a hella lot of attention to me. one asks me when my birthday was so he could get me a present. he's a nerd but he's sweet. i teased the other one the other night to the point of him about ready to sneak out of the house and come to mine. lol. i told him i'd lock the door and not let him in. then i continued teasing him. hahaha...i'm mean, i know. 

so yeah, i still haven't talked to amanda in wisconsin so i still don't even know if she's alive or not. i haven't talked to moogies in a really long ass time so i'm not sure what's happening with her anymore either. i know that paula moved into the apartment with her and kyle and everyone. 

i found a car for $1800 but if i don't come up with the cash soon, they're going to sell it. and there's no fucking way i can get the money by then so it looks like that dream is gone. mum told me that she's going to be getting me into driving school soon. booya! maybe i'll be able to get my license on time after all, since she's spent so much time on my sister's learning to drive and she probably fears me driving because she doesn't think i'll come back one day. 

well i'm gunna go watch movies and shit now. i think i'm caching a cold. fuck. i was just sick for 2 weeks! i don't need to be sick again!!! gr...

"event","spent the weekend welcoming ruth home. she's apparently moving back. dunno how long that will last though. we went to the mall friday and while i was waiting for her arrival, i met this guy named luke that i clicked with so awesomly. 

i have come to realize that i am extremely infatuated with this guy i know from school. he's so smart and he treats women better than anything else in this world. he's the sweetest guy i've ever met really and he's totally driving me crazy because i used to spend like an hour a day with him. now i see him for only a quick hug not even daily. ::sigh::  it sucks balls cause he also still loves his ex and yeah. 

i'm also highly fascinated by this big black guy in one of my classes. it's insane because yeah, i always find myself watching him and shit. he's really kinda cute though. he's also got these big thick fingers and full lips and just gr... 

i'm turning straight!! dundundun. 

o man, i'm so fucking hung up on these guys right now! yay! one of them just told me goodnight and gave me an internet kiss! lol, now if he'd make it real, it'd all be good. 

i'm off...later days fuckers."

"event","hey guys! i decided that since so many of my friends have livejournal, i should go ahead and update for them. i'll have to get everyones' user names later. um...new in my life? i'm dating these 3 great girls. christie, teresa, and moogies. it's ok dating them but i'm really considering breaking it off with all 3. christie doesn't seem to like me anymore, teresa and i aren't really going anywhere more with our relationship, and moogies is with kyle. who doesn't even tell her when i call. and since she's an adult with a full-time job and i've got school PLUS a job, our schedules never seem to hit together enough for us to actually see each other often...so my life in that department is currently going to shit. but of course there's robert also. he's such a sweet guy ((even if he is a perv, lol)). he wants to be with me and everyone that knows the 2 of us and sees us together thinks we'd be perfect together. even gina had to ask if we were dating. gr...i just don't know what to do. he's 20 and sexually active. i mean...i am but like...not as much as a 20 year old guy...so i'm kinda iffy about that whole situation. i just...don't want to hurt anyone. but i know i'm hurting grunk and amber and nazik all right now. all of them are 'in love' with me as they say and i know they all want to be with me but it's hard when the only person my heart still wants to be with is robyn. she will ALWAYS fucking be there. and i know it. 

i'm going to go look some things up and finish what's left of the dishes for now. try not to think...

WHEN SCHOOL STARTS BACK, I CAN TALK ABOUT ALL THE CLASSES I FAILED AND IF THEY FIGURED OUT I SKIPPED ONE DAY. BUT, WHATEVER. WANNA KNOW WHAT I'M LIKE? WELL THEN...I WEAR BLACK SHIRTS WITH LITTLE PHRASES ON THEM CONSTANTLY, GUY JEANS OR HOT TOPIC-TYPE PANTS, WHICH I LOVE. I NEVER GO ANYWHERE WITHOUT AT LEAST ONE NECKLACE ON AND ALMOST ALL OF MY TEN FINGERS ARE GOING TO HAVE RINGS ON THEM VERY SOON. I AM CURRENTLY ENGAGED TO MY EX EX GIRLFRIEND. I LIKE GUYS AND GIRLS SEXUALLY. NO, I'M NOT INDECISIVE ABOUT THAT, I JUST LIKE BOTH. YES, I REALIZE THAT I SHOULD HAVE WRITTEN ALL OF THIS ON THE OTHER PAGE THINGY, BUT I'M JUST SO...DIFFERENT, THAT I'D RATHER MAKE IT MY FIRST ENTRY. IF U WANT TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ME, JUST LEAVE A COMMENT OR E-MAIL ME. I DON'T MIND. BUT FOR NOW, I'M GOING TO GO FINISH WATCHING 'RUNAWAY BRIDE'. PEACE TO THE DEAD, LATER."

"event","last night was bad yet but good. A friend of mine is moving next week and we had our last get together. We saw Catwoman and it was definatly one of the best movies i have seen. But the bad part isnt that she is moving its that my bestfriend didnt come to wish her off. I dont know why she didnt come but i hope one day she will tell me."

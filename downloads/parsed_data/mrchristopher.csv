"event","i havent seen anyone mention it....so. wednesday night i was sitting on the couch working on my laptop, talking to wendy, with the tv muted. anyway, she goes ""hey isnt that....?"" and i look up to see mister nick cave playing a piano on dave letterman.  and when i unmuted it? he was playing ""the mercy seat"". coolest thing ive seen on tv in quite some time."

"event","so last night the wee wifey and i decided after some coaxing from friends to go see the cure festival thingee. it was filthy evil swampy august hot out, so we dropped the kids off at my mom's house and then just hung out there eating her food for awhile until the sun had begun to let up. we ended up getting to the show around 730 or so, still hotter than christ outside but tolerable. met up with some folks, caught a wee bit of interpol which wasnt terribly impressive, then watched muse who my friends raved about but i thought sounded like angry radiohead. not awful, but whatever. 

god how i loathe the crowd at these summer festival tour things. while ozzfest is fun just for the whole ""i wonder who's working at mcdonalds today?"" effect, this was just tragic. it's endlessly entertaining watching young dorks get all gothed out for an OUTDOOR SHOW when it's 93 degrees with 95% humidity. that's some funny shit right there. and the hipster parade is a whole nother post entirely. also, large fat unbelievably badly tattooed shirtless drunken frat boy types stomping around aggressively to ""inbetween days"" has to be the highlight of my year thus far. truly truly pathetic, but in a brilliant way.

as for fat bob and friends, i havent seen a show since disintegration in...89 or so. well thats not true, saw the wish tour and left after about half an hour. but i digress.i didnt really have terribly high hopes seeing as how it was a festival thingee so i expected the ""hits"" to be trotted out. which they were, HOWEVER.. they also played shake dog shake, 100 years, charlotte sometimes, faith, and a strange day. so it was all good. and his voice sounded quite good. he joked at one point ""here's another song off our new album called 'disintegration'"" which was funny. i think they only played maybe....3 or 4 songs off the new one, and 6 or 7 off that. all in all, not too shabby. fun was had. went back, picked the kidlets up, came home and collapsed.

brian is on his way over, we're gonna finish up the laptop stuff. i ran off mine about half the night on saturday and it sounded great. hopefully ill be 100% on it very shortly which will be a huge improvement. no more lugging ginormous cd cases with me all the time. annnnnnnnd....that's all for now."

"event","well apparently i set the books down next to the car when i was talking to the bouncer guy, and then left them in the parking lot. one of the owners found them a little while later as he went to leave and theyre waiting for me in the office, and i am told they didnt even get run over. the dj gods smile mightily upon me on this fine day. werd."

"event","okay....so. when i left work on saturday night, i had to bring home my stand-alone cd burner and a few other things i ordinarily leave at the club because i had a lot of things to burn and get done in my ongoing quest to get everything loaded into this external hard drive so i can be fully laptop at work. ANYWAY. this meant i had tons of stuff to get into the car. i enlisted the help of a friend of mine who is a bouncer at the club, he helped me by carrying out my huge heavy roadcases full of cd's. we put those in the car, i put in my burner, my shoulderbag, and i THOUGHT i put in my 2 cd books as well.

the next day, i went over to my friend brian's house to continue the loading into the laptop process, and upon opening the back of the car, everything is there EXCEPT the 2 books of cd's. i freaked out briefly, but then assumed i had left them at the club which would have been annoying but really no big deal. well, i get ahold of the club, have the GM go upstairs into the booth and look. nope, no cd books. call the bouncer guy, he says he THINKS i put them into the car, he doesnt remember as we were talking. but they werent in the parking lot or anything as he left right after i did and would have noticed. keep in mind this guy is totally trustworthy. NOW. what this means is this: these 2 books contained my promo only cd's for the last FIVE YEARS as well as various compilation cd's i had made of assorted crap. AND THEY'RE GONE. AND CANT BE REPLACED. oh man i am so very very very fucked. we're talking THOUSANDS of dollars worth of stuff. seriously.
 
on the other hand, brian and i have worked together off and on for years, therefore he probably has at least 75% of the stuff i am missing....but it's a matter of getting it all again that is a huge monstrous pain in the ass.and i do still have my cases, which have like....i dunno, 1500 more cd's in them. but the promo's are what i play constantly....all the various pop stuff i dont own the whole album of, just a track here and there. whew....it's gonna make working this week very interesting to say the least. it just makes no sense. the car was locked, and even if someone DID break into the car on my quiet street out in the burbs, they wouldnt have only taken the books, as there was a cd burner and two huge roadcases right there too. and then magically relocked the car. and supposing i did leave them at the club, there were only a couple of bouncers left, all of whom i trust. eh....i guess it's irrelevant. i need to move into the ""acceptance phase"" and see what i can do to salvage the situation. i dont work again until thursday night so i guess i'll be a cd burning fool until then to see what i can salvage. fuckity mcfuckles. other than that though, everything is fine. heh."

"event","while wendywife is upstairs washing dye out of her hair and the wee kidlets are playing nicely in their rooms, i shall update. let's see... well i walked out of one of my dj jobs the other night, which i have never done before. not in the middle of the shift at least. but the guy was just a complete fucktard and had no idea what he was doing or how to run a club and had been abnormally insulting as of late and he made a snide comment about something i was playing and i just went ""....you know what? i'm going home. bye."" packed up my shit and walked....leaving him with nothing but the 100 or so songs he has in his computer, which last i checked was 20% xmas tunes and stuff like ""the electric slide"". heh. i really needed the paltry amount of cash i made there, but oh well. sometimes you just have to do what feels right.

speaking of computers, i have been wanting to make the change to a laptop at work for some time now, as lugging the insane amount of cd's i bring from club to club is unbelievably obnoxious. but i havent had the cash to switch it up. while on the phone with my father the other day i mentioned something about it and lo and behold he calls me the next day to say ""hey, i got you a free laptop"". he works for raytheon and apparently they get new computers every couple of years and just give the old ones to charity or whatnot as a writeoff. so i got a free laptop. it's older, a compaq armada 7800. only has a pentium 2 and a few other things, but nothing that isn't easily upgradable. and hey, FREE. so i've been sitting with my friend and fellow titty-bar guy brian and uploading everything i have that he doesnt into HIS laptop, and when we're done i'm just ripping his whole hard drive. so far we have made it to ""H"" alphabetically, and we're already at something like 34 gigs. and after the alphabet comes all the soundtracks and random compilations, then the book of promo only discs, so i think when this is all said and done we will have more songs than god. nice. and in a groovy easily transportable package. even better.

see this is why i never post.....i dont have anything terribly interesting to say. blargh.

 at any rate, thaddeus has been at my mom's house for 10 days or so. it's strange not having him around, but man are there far less noisy ""DAAAAAAAAD!!!! HE TOUCHED ME!!!"" type fights. so yeah. i'm gonna shower after wendy is done, then go poke around a bit for new job possibilities. i need to find something else not stripclub related because i am seriously sick of it, but i'm hard pressed to find something that is easy hours and straight cash. i'm not cute enough to be a gigolo, and drug dealer is not the profession for me so....i dunno. maybe i'll whore myself out to do weddings and parties or some other obnoxious thing like that. i just don't know. ANYWAY. there you have it, kids. carry on."

"event","wheeeeee. look at me, i'm posting. everything is crazy in my little corner of the world. i'm working 5 nights a week and making great money, and still we're broke. but nonetheless, all is well. wendy will be 30 in 2 weeks, and we'll be together for 12 years next month. there is of course random assorted kid crap that occurs, that i dont feel like boring all you xero population folks with. at any rate, i'm fat, i drink too much, i tried, incredibly unsuccessfully i might add, to quit smoking and. yeah. i am rocking this biker/cowboy/leather daddy mustache thing, and i get hit on by burly men at home depot because of it. but that's another story for another time. oh, anyone who lives nearby and cares, surprise party for wendy next friday the 11th. email me for details. this means you, blackjack. and you, too stacy. and farrar. um. yeah. this is why i never post. i really have nothing interesting to say unless i tell you about my bizarre dreams and whatnot. and all i really do is work in strip clubs, which is nowhere near as interesting as you might think. but my knowledge of horrible top 40 hiphop is disturbing. test me, i dare you. carry on, folks. we'll do this again in a year or so."

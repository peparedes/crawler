The autumn leaves breeze pass her face and strands of hair cover her eyes.

Maybe I am making excuses, not to get hurt... 
Maybe I am making excuses because I will never be good enough.
But really I don't know.
So many snags and bumps have came my way and my only defense has been laying there and taking it.
Why am I sitting here I have a life to be lived, and I headache to be rid of.

Blah. I really don't even know what I am saying nor thinking nor doing.

It's all weird. weird. weird. weird. weird. weird.

That's all.


Ps. I love Holly and Kelly a lot, they keep me sane."

Buildings tower over your small being, you amount to nothing more than a grain of sand, but the city has never felt so much like home. The paths I walked, I hope to walk everyday, in the future.
Insecurity is so securing. I never have felt so lost, so dazed, and so unprotected; but never have I felt like I was where I was meant to be.

This is how I see the future.
A crowded newsroom, filled with writers of all sorts, running and rushing to make their deadline. Everyone is frantic, everyone is crazed; the newsroom walls are filled with windows, and the 15th floor has an amazing view of the chicago skyline, it's the only reassurance the reporters have. I leave the Chicago Tribune at a late hour, just despite time. i take the subway longer than necessary, just to sort my thoughts. You fly by people awaiting in the cold, awaiting for their turn to get their thoughts in line. I get off, and walk the chilly walk all alone, the streets are dark, and filled with am erie hue. I make it to my small, dirty apartment, to sit and write. And that's all I want.

"event","No matter how hard we try to conform, or even fight conformity.
We are such different people (than i think we realize).
I don't know what people see when they look at me, and I don't know what anyone really thinks of me.
People can take my face, and put it in a crowd of other adolescent kids who are lost.
But the one thing that will make me different from the rest is that i know deep down I have something they don't. And hopefully it will shine through.
So on the topic of who I am, let me have a moment to introduce myself.
We maybe friends.. but you might not know me...

I'm Laura. Ordinary. Autumn is my favorite, it reminds me of my childhood. It makes me think of the possibility this life has. The soundtrack to my life would be 104.3 (the oldies channel). I dance in the kitchen with my mom, and it's my favorite thing to do. Saturday mornings are the best, I like waking up to children playing outside, and birds chirping. I miss sitting alone in my room on fridays nights, wondering what the world was doing. I try to be care-free, but really I'm a really anxious person. I have no confidence what so ever, nor do I have self-esteem. When I was young I used to lie about everything, because I thought my life was boring. I wanted to be a bus driver when I was 6. I've always liked playing with boys, in a recces type of way(and i still so). I think the most heartbreaking moment of my life was seeing my dad getting arrested. My mother has endured so much in her life I don't know how she continues to smile, she is my strength. I like going to churches, when there's nobody there, and lying down just to feel like I'm one with God, whom I love. I like going to shows, because it's so chaotic much like life, and everyone is in it together. I have three brothers, and I can't imagine life without them. I have one surviving grandparent, and she's one of my best friends, she is truly amazing. My aunt debbie is my mom number 2, she gets me in a way, that only an aunt can understand. I wish I could save the world. My past relationships have been nothing but heart shredding and meaningless. Night life is my favorite, I like the hustle and bustle of the city and the serenity of the country. I'm a nature type of gal. And that's all for now.

If you read that all;
thanks, it was nice (re)meeting you."

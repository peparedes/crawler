"event","i need to change. i can feel myself redy to be different in a big way, but i'm not exactly sure how i am going to go about innitiating anything.

i AM pretty much stuck in the same place for the next month or so...but thats a pretty tiny amount of time, in comparison to other times in the past where i have made the effort to measure time until doing something.

as it is, though, i seem to be ""going slightly mad""(to use the words of the late freddy mercury), and am also borderline intoxicated as i have downed....well, ""sipped slowly over the course of an hour or so"" would be a better way of putting it...an okanogen strawberry rhubarb cider.

this is because i am way too easily drunkified.

i'm going to my gramma's house tomorrow morning to fix all of my pants...and by fix i mean patch and make all the intense flaires go away, as i've decided flaires are hazardous to my health due to the fact that i constantly get my big tow caught in the opposite pant leg and biff it hard. i'm pretty excited; it's like getting new clothes, sort of...but i feel efficient and non-wasteful because i'm fixing instead of discarding and purchasing anew things of a similar nature. i feel like it will help trick me into feeling like i'm starting new...but i guess i'm actually starting new in a broader sense, as i've never made the choice to fix old shat instead of just buying new stuff.i am a new and more practical person:D. 

spending my own money has put me in a whole new place perspectively.

i honesstly do feel like i need something NEW to happen; not to won something new...but an actual feeling in my life where everything isnt jsut a slightly modified version of before. i need something fresh and unexpected. something drastic.

i know i've said this before, many a time...but think about it this way; i've been saying it for soo long, without anythin really huge happening...my patience is beginning to wear thin! i've waited quite a long time for someone who doesnt have an attention span problem; which i do!!!

i need to go for a walk.

spend some paper.

love and peace

"event","i wish that i could retrain my mind...so it thinks spontaneously, without routine, so i dont get bored like i do.

everything seems to become rhythmic...

i miss some of my friends desperately...but i'm silmotaneously stoked on some people i've been hanging out with lately...but no matter how much fun i can have in kamloops, the fact is; i cannot continue to live there for any long amount of time.

i think i'll go up to the charlottes for thanksgiving with jasmin, then when i go back down to drop jas off for school, i'll mosey on down to vancouver to spend some time with jordan and dana, dawson and jaslyne.i actually really miss dawson, it has been since xmas since i've seen him.wooowee.

it sucks...my interweb self seems to be such a wanker;i guess its because when i;m stokeed on life i'm too busy living to rant on how fucked upit is...haehehe.

i'm not unhappy right now; on the contrary, i'm pretty stoked....just bored.

my brain needs another wake up call; i need to let soemthing go, and the sooner i figure it out the better. i think i should go outside for a shmoke...:D

pyramidmindfuck.blogspot.com  ...for those of you who are interested, which could be none, as i have no clue.

i feel the need to start fresh...i'll probably construct a new email address as well, (although i will never get rid of rainbowsaresexy, because i love it) in order to feel that much less attached to the person i was before i knew about anything important going on in the world.

i love knowledge. i love sharing knowledge, and i love people sharing knowledge with me. 

this entry will be retardedly short, but thats ok because if you really feel like reading words typed out by me you can utilize the blogspot address i typed out all conveniently for you:D

what the fuck is up? am i frusterated beyond belief because society is keeping so many so trapped into underestimating themselves intensly? well, yes...but arent i always? am i freaking out because i stopped smoking everything all at once without even weening myself off of either substance properly? perhaps a wee bit, but i really cant see that being the problem, as it never has been one in the past. do i feel like punching things randomly because i have too much pent up sexual energy, and now that i know what its like to release it and currently have noone to direct it at, am going mental? naw...although all i seem to really want to do aside from getting the fuck as far away from everyone and everything i know slash have always known as i can, is just go back to covert farms and just like...i dunno...just say hi to pete(pierre). or soemthing. 

but seriously, i expect to never see him again, so i really shouldnt act all vaguely disapointed when i didnt even have any expectations in the first place.

owch...there also appears to be a lurker on the back of my neck thats waiting to show its head (ew).just thought i'd share that, although i dont think a pimple could have an amazing effect on my mood.

i jsut like...need something good to happen. just anything, really...well not anything, something good.

i'm jsut so sick of the ridiculous routine that is my life thus far. 
 


    PLEASE PLEASE, LIFE OF ME, CHANGE QUICKLY BEFORE I GO COMPLETELY MAD!


perhaps it is all of the above that is making me emotionally unstable, plus maybe one other thing that will remain unnamed on this lj because its just not meant to be shared at this point and time...once I know what to think, i'll let you know.

"event","i jsut spent the whole weekend with hannah, roi, graham and jasmine. it was wonderous. well...there were more people talked to than them because we WERE at a music festival. the roots and blues festival in salmon arm, to be exact. it was gloriously glorious. i'm not sure if i've ever been exposed ot that much good music over such a solidly long period of time. anyways...my friends? i love them.

jasmine and i contact danced and it was a magnificent experience; i think i shall vigerously pass on the tradition, as it was the most un i've had dancing for quite some time.

meeting a mysteriously beautiful person named pierre, or peter of you listen to what he wants you to call him, who is an 18 year old hair dresser in montreal. we had a wild night of spontaneous shenanegans,shenanegans which left me with scars... i'd like to say we rather connected on a nicely personal level; i was at least quite alot more than a little fond of his energy. i left my email on one of the torn out, partially burned bible pages from the night before's crazy drunk fest. perhaps he will utilise it, perhaps not. 

it's all sort of adventurous and mysterious of us, dont you think?

i feel like a harlet almost...if my mind's definition of a harlet is the same as everyone else's...theres a good chance its not, so we'll just omit that word and replace it with something sensible. the funniest part of the whole thing, really, is the fact that he had really no clue that i was a virgin previous to that evening.

i almost feel bad for not telling him....

oh well, i AM going to montreal this fall so perhaps i can find the four star hair place he works at...i might be able to do some pretty nifty detective work. i might also be much too lazy to do anything, which is more likely based on my usual peronality pattern of doing things.

well, it seems as though i havent had an actually good nights slepp since the night before i stayed up all night on lsd...i think a fattie and a cup of black tea are in order. then a deliciously suspensfull slash adventurous film to fall asleep to slash afterwards.

"event","i miss my friends roi, graham and andrew.

i feel like they are 3 of the like..7 actually aware persons i know. it's strange being surrounded by the city; so many people just caught up by consuming consuming consuming: so lost in gaining personal wealth that they forget that we're all the same, and the only reason that things are so unbalanced is because nobody helps each other anymore.

the irritating, awkward, confusing energy of society has become more powerful, and i feel as though this is the elite having one last go by fucking things up as hard as they can before everything is forced to change. it will change. and it will be glorious, for lack of a better word. but until then, my molecules are distressed and are waiting ever more impatiently for the excitement in their life to be properly kick-started, and continue on in a more or less continuously fun flowwww.

on an even brighter note, i found the bombay laughing club on myspace, and there are two songs on their page that i hadn't heard until now. their genius blows me away. i can honestly say they're my favorite. now, that may not seem like much, as we all know how many favorites i have, but seriously, lets list off my actual favortie bands that are enjoyable enough to listen to non-stop:

the bombay laughing club
ween

there are more, but these are the only two bands eclectic and genius enough to constantly be listened to. seriously. i almost feel bad for leaving the band and the grateful dead out of that list, but in all honesty; i love them, but i dont make an overly huge effort to go searching for their music.

i have alot of jumbled thoughts that may or may not have been more interesting than going off about my love for the bombay laughing club, but i cant seem to organize them into sensicle bantering.

i'm starting work again tomorrow for the first time in two weeks, as i was iiilllllllll.i think im stoked to get buffed again. i need to do all work in the wee hours of the morning though. eugh. intensly, i cannot believe it got ot be over 40 degrees the other day, and its at least 40 on every other day.

"event","so apparently i am over being awkward around my highschool peers. proof of this? i just emailed ty hamill, one of the ""hot"" and ""cool"" boys of my grad class, and talked about armpit hair and picking my nose.without feeling any remorse after pressing the ""send"" button. i actually feel strangely liberated.

i've recently let go of any and all particular crushes i've had on anyone over the past year or so(i tend to cling to things a little long sometimes), and have decided that i really like myself, and even though i do still semi-desperately want someone cute to cuddle, i'm not impatient. i know i'm no leper, so i figure that someone sometime that i'm attracted to is bound to return my fondness and want to cuddle with me back. 

living in the moment is so much harder to do than you'd think. it took me quite some time to even grasp the concept fully. i think i'm slowly mastering the skill, though, as i am feeling much happier than i ever really remember feeling before. this kind of contentness was always associated with being in a relationship before, but now i'm just alone...and totally stoked.

i'm not actually alone alone, because i live with like...7 other people. and its always changing.

"event","i feel so...almost overwhelmed lately. and i know what it is that is occupying, however subconscious it may be, my mind so much that i dont have the ability to move forward anymore. 

                      i 


                                            need

              to


                              work 




                    on                            just


                              





                               being.

i have to get over this thing i do where i let other people's intentions control mine. its not a bad thing smallscale, and sometimes big scale, too, to have this powerful of an emotion...its jsut not cool to have to suppress it into my subconscious because i'm stuck on a question with two possible answer. one more possible than the other, perhaps.

i jsut know how I feel...and i dont believe that feelings this powerful...energies that powerful...feelings that i am feeling through spontaneous and consuming energy surges...energies i recognize particularily...can be my imagination. 

because although we DO manifest our own realities through our choices and thoughts and emotions, this is not a typical annie situation. if it were a different source of energy...the connection wouldnt be this strong...there's something unique there thats almost more intuition (and a fraction of an hour's worth of complete communication...along with countless other moments), than it is verbalization or flat-out confirmation....

the unique situation makes it almost more difficult to deal with...almost more torturous? 



                                     (i'm happy though.)

if i were feeling this strongly a different sort of...thing...energy
................i would inevitably be like, ""yes, this is undenyable..""..........but this is different somehow. 


all of this guessing makes it hard to concentrate on living as an infinite being.

 



                   


        (which we all are, by the way)





                           :)*wink*

but it IS all part of being on this planet, so i suppose i'd better just appreciate the strength of the energy, and bask in it while it's there...............



..........and try not to focus so hard on guessing,






          and spend some more time...





                                         













                                    being:)

for the first time in my life, i feel as though i truley LOVE myself.



.................yet there is this built up elemental energy and walled of place in my brain that is trying to tell me otherwise, and i cannot seem to bring myself to realize fully the root of this...well, problem.


                   or i KNOW the root of it and only time and happenings will change the way i feel blocked off, and slightly drained.



            loud music seems to be helping me: the loudness and energeticness is giving my body enough adrenaline to keep my mind and body sufficiently awake....although if i tried to go out for another walk, i may or may not collapse in the streets. 



        except of course a ganja run, 





                                          which will be neccesary.


         

i love the psycadelic screen on windows media player:D




i guess i'm just tired of waiting around for something tangeable to happen...........although waiting is undeniably part of living....and being surrounded by this strange, controlled consciousness makes the waiting periods longer and less bearable.


thank the universe for the people who keep the film industry from running itself into a deep repetitive hole of decroded shite. if it werent for independant films, insane cult masterpeices, insane rock musicals, and classic old authentic films, i think my life would have alot less of a technicolour tinge to it. 


         also really good documentaries hold a special place in my

the solstice party was so ultimate. i only stayed for one night, but i spent that night glalvanting in the forest and being with with my friend hannah, and alone, and with radom crazy hippie folk such as myself, on psycadelics, and drumming for hours on end until dawn.

i've recently been contemplating the options i have regarding drug use while farming; i've ruled out lsd, because if i do it too often, i'll never want to come back to reality; mushrooms are too expensive to keep up days in a row, as the tolerance you build up after doing them makes it neccesary to take marginally more and more each successive day; kedamine might work, but i really dont feel like chemically imbalancing myself, jsut to feel like my head is floating;mdma would make everything feel pretty happy and interesting, but i'd rather not take away from the reality of feeling things without drugs; alcohol would be so prime if it werent for the fact that there is alcoholism in my family, and it would be way too easy for me to get OOC (out of control)and altogether ridonkulous. there are other drugs i could choose, but really, after alot of contemplation and canceling-out of substances, i have simply agreed with myself that marijuana and caffeine are the two drugs that will keep me entertained, yet awake; because marijuana alone would only make me apathetic, and coffee alone wouldnt be fun enough, the mixture of the two seems to make sense. which is stupid because those have more or less always been my favorites (and alcohol..but thats because its fun...although nothing can really beat lsd on all around radness, i must say; seeign and feeling the truth at the same time is pretty awsomely trippy).

there was the CRAZIEST storm last night; i woke up at like 1:30 in the morning and it was sooooo windy and crazy, but there was no rain, and there was insane-oh lightning, but absolutely no thunder. and when i got out of bed to stop the blinds from noising i looked out the door to the balcony and the sky was sooo strange; a medly of white/yellow clouds and a half yellow half white moon...the whole sky was radiating this super natural power. i actually could not sleep for at least an hour...the weirdest thing to me, is that the storm made me want to be outside...usually i'd be borderline terrified of being struck by lightning or something, yet still intrigued enough to stand outside near no metal whatsoever, but this made me want to stand on the roof to get closer to the crazy energy.

i'm glad energies have accelerated yet again, because i'm slowly becoming more easily bored with life. like rightnow i dont know what to do because i've picked all the strawberries i can, and now i 'm waiting for tristan to get back so we can lay straw down, andin the meantime i am drinking some coffee (and contemplating jointage, depending on how long it takes tristan to get here, and if the coffee is gone before he gets here)...


NICE!!!...karl jsut told me that marijuana has 420 chemicals(naturally produced, loves) in it (which apprently is quite a small amount compared to most substances), which is the root of all other rumours of how 420 originsted; police code, hitlers birthday, bob marley's death day or birthday (<----which is false becasue i googled it on the interweb once and i think the date of his death was may 18th and his birhtday was april 9th or something...nothingn to do with the 20th of april)and random others. good to know, though. i feel like 420 has a whole new, valid meaning in my life...that, consiquently, has absolutely nothing to do with a crazy nazi feind who killed people. thank you, karl and karls high school drug counseler dude.

things i am looking forward to:

>lori's summer solstice party(weekend after the 21st of june)
>my uncles wedding slash the hat creek gathering(first weekend in august)
>camping trip with high school buddies(mid july...we're all saving roaches for it)
>an email from someone supercool
>open mic tonight and the inevitable group singing of rocketman
>a weekend of shenanigans in town(starting tomorrow night)
>having a vehicle to live slash travel in after i'm done doing whatever here
>getting my braces off in december
>one day vandelizing starbucks or walmart or mcdonalds(drunkenly and stealthily, of course...if those two things do, in fact, go together ever)
>living in montreal after two years or so of exploring this awsome place called british columbia, perhaps with annelise or hannah...or maybe someone else exciting?
>roi coming to the farm for a bit
>learning more about photon bands, orbital patterns, 26,000 year cycles, pleiadians, and dimensions
>having someone to love(in a special way, becuase i love everyone)
>finding trees in chase to explore slash smoke ganja in, all the while thwarting those powertripping smalltown fuzz...""get a bike helmet"" PFFFFFFFFFFF
>kyaking off the west coast with my mum, dad, sister, and neice in the autumn

well my coffee is done and tristans not here....i want to roll a j and go innebriate myself further, but i dont know if thats the thing to do...we'll see how the energy moves me after i get off this interweb device called ""computer""

i kind of want to go run into something.......

i think i'll refrain.:)

LOVE YOU SOOOOO MUCH (forever)

"event","man oh man i feel good.

life is good


life is actually splendid....i appreciate every moment.

i have been concentrating on bettering myself and i've officially started by removing lactose from my diet completely. tria will help me because apparently steven and tristan are convincing when they say cheese cant hurt me...they're kniving little tricksters.

the reason of my bliss with life? it's currently occured to me that i'm actually completely independant now...i live at a farm where i work....no longer answering to parents is a trippy thing after years of obedience. sadly, the cops are inescapeable...or so they'd like to think, as i plan to find every sneaky place i can to get innebriated in chase (which apparently means not the park because it ""closes at 11""...fuckers), thus thwarting their fascist ways.

this is the first time in my life (this time around) that i've been completely content with being with myself. wanna know how i'm actually ok with not having someone to snuggle(although it would obviously make my contentness morf into bliss)? well i'll tell you anyways..:D. i know because i dont have the urge to innitiate any sort of hanky panky with the boys slash men around me...i'm just waiting for a compatible perosn who will hit one ME. its my new rule of living. i will not make any more moves, because i misjudge peoples emotions sometimes and rejection definitly isnt the key to happiness....i may or may not eat my words about hitting on people, depending on whether or not i see a certain interesting someone anytime soon.

i've discovered that i really like feeling productive. weeding was very satisfying today, as was my second job, even though it took less physical effort.

i need to think of a magical food to eat with my evening alcohol...i've decided that drinking wine or beer every night is fun. i odnt get DRUNK every night...jsut one or two glasses/bottles(<----of beer not wine...glasses of wine); enough to feel it in my cheeks:D

my future intention is becoming more clear to me...its refreshing. i wish realizations on everyone i know. i feel like i'm learning ocnstantly and its a really good feeling.

i'd also like to express my love of the band and xavier rudd...they're sooooo good it actually gives me pain, and then takes it away, replacing it with a gooey happy feeling, similar to warm jam, i think.

i dont know how to conclude this entry...as my thoughts arent really flowing nicely right now...so i'll jsut say ""GAZEEBO""

               GAZEEBO!

love you!!!1111!!1

but i know what i really...desire?...so i shall keep strong, even the the antici....PATION...is killing me. so hard. it hurts. OWCH.

things are becoming too repetitive, even though the things i am doing are productive, i feel twitchy for...eerrrrrr...something.

        SIGH....

i cant even concentrate on reading my pleiadian agenda book, even though its -hands down- the most interesting peice of book i've ever read. 

im getting more pigment from being in the sun....very neat as i've never been one for being tan...theres usually only a transition from white, to a slightly darker shade of white. now its like a sunkissed beige..actually i have no effing clue what i'm talking about. i just dont burn as hard now. 

i need a nap...harshcore. i think i may have to accomplish that like...nowish..

my brain is too out of focus to possibly write about anything of importance...in fact, i am sure i'll look back on this entry and giggle while shaking my head in shame.

"event","things are flowing so randomly-intentionally around me....its like even though i can feel everything speeding up without any letting up around me, i cant help but feel a tad angstly impatient; even though i KNOW things are happeneing as they should and they COULDNT even ever happen another way because in between milestones in one's life, you always have to deal with those seemingly insignificant lessons (that are obviously cataclysmically large and important, whether you are aware of it or not) that take up soooooo much time. 

i'm only half complaining because, even though i feel completely content with how things are right now, and could continue to be happy like this for a long(ish) period of time, i am ever-so constantly aware of this one particular energy that is always with me. i'm very very stoked on this energy(verging on confused about it because i've never felt anything so real before), and it is the only thing that IS keeping me content(i say keeping me content because everything i am doing is constructive, and i'm happy with the people i'm around and such, but this energy is the crucial link in the contentness chain)...but i AM constantly wanting more. this energy is strange because, even though its overwhelmingly awsome to have, i know it could be SO MUCH BETTER, if only circumstances were a bit different...or if time would move faster and i could see the outcome of it...even though i know the most important thing is to appreciate and love the moment i am in, i cant help but always have this tiny prodding at the back of my mind saying, ""ooooh but think of how itCOULD be""


i'm not letting this little prodding voice get in my way of being content, although it IS making me a freak about checking my email...despite evidence against there being anything exciting any more often than once a week.

oh well

these crazy emotions are all part of being here and being human, and i  wouldnt trade my situation for any other.

its raining SO HARD...for kamloops area, anyways...im worried about the state of the corn, as corn does not like moisture, so much...and the early corn will be not-so-early if it keeps up..UH OH.  and weeding the small strawberry patch is going to be a bitch and a half to weed once its dry again, as the plants are too close together to weed when its wet(roots wil be squished), but sadly rain makes weeds grow as much as it makes strawberries grow.

me and carl and tria found two bags of magic today and i think i may take advantage of the contents of one of them in the crazily near future...perhaps even make some money off of it of the quality is up to parr.

i dont know why i even write in this livejournal anymore; i cant think of anyone who is genuinly interested in my rantings about figuring out life (slowly...painfully slowly...yet faster as we speak...or type or breathe or whateverrrrr), and you'd think that because this is all jsut my little thoughts, i'd write them in my actual journal...well, normally i would...but there are only so many beautiful blank pages left in my journal, and i need to let out some brian steam, and i'd like to conserve my sheets of paper for more significant rantings....not like i put my thoughts together any more logically on paper than i do here, on the interweb, but i tend to wait longer to write it all down.

i'll leave you with the song by the band that i have stuck in my head(heck, i'll give you the whole freaking tab):

I Shall Be Released

E                             F#m
 They say everything can be replaced  
G#m            A         B      E
 They say every distance is not near  
                    F#m
So I remember every face
G#m       A       B      E    B
 Of every man who put me here

(Chorus:)
E                    F#m
 I see my light come shinin'
G#m       A      B      E
 From the west unto the east
            F#m  
Any day now, any day now  
G#m A       B  E
 I  shall be released 

They say ev'ry man needs protection  
They say that ev'ry man must fall  
Yet I swear I see my reflection  
Somewhere so high above this wall 

(Chorus)

Now yonder standing there in this lonely crowd  
A man who swears he's not to blame  
All day long I hear him shouting so loud  
Just crying out that he was framed

(Chorus)



hows THAT for a damn good song?!?!?!?...it is a damn good song...download it if you dont believe me...its origionally by bob dylan, though. but im over it.

i wish it would stop raining so i felt like biking into chase to get some chinese food and a film...perhaps after i'm not so low i'll feel more adventurous...:|

i love you

anywho.............quitting school to farm has been the best descision of my life that has more or less directly led to the countless other major lessons i have learned since doing so. i've discovered so much about myself and...well...life...i feel so much more awake and alive, being able to think so much while hoeing all day long and eating only organic foods and reading books and things...

all of the energies are changing and moving so fast around us...the ecceleration will be startling soon..not that it already isnt. its making me feel excited for not only the things about to come, but also of the things happening now in a way that i've never felt beforee...its all very good.

a new consciousness in on its way...watch out, things are going to change undeniabley and unreasonably fast...whew.

im currently in town to sort throughall of my so called belongings and throw out what is neccesary..............so most of it....to be sold for charity at a flea market.

i have been eating non-stop for four days on account of my birthday celebration weekend..not only my birthday but vaugn, hannah and tristans as well, which made it about three times as fun, as there were three gihugous meals to stuff myself with...not to mention the lsd experience silly, consistant drinking and mass cheeba consumption...needless to say i spent the weekend more or less completely inebriated.

some bands i've been really liking:

stevie wonder
zubot and dawson
of montreal
sam roberts
aretha franklin
bombay laughing club
system of a down
ugly casanova
morphine
joanna newsom
kate bush
neil young
the beatles

some of these may or may not be constant in all music lists i ever make, but that jsut means they never get boring to listen to in my world:D.

i'm going to eat a bit more food, and bike to annelises house now so's i can go to xmen 3 tonight!(woooooooooooooohooo)

          i hope im not disapointed.........

"event","it seems as though it has been a substancial amount of time since i have written last...HUM.

well let me think of what has happened that is exciting.................well i guess seeing santosh again was a slight adventure; we didnt really talk or anything because it was me dropping by JR's on the 22nd when him, santosh, chuch, xoph, owen and lex were jamming...and what jamming it was; some of the best jamming i have ever heard, actually. well apparently i was too shy and awkward to say much because i got all stoned when i got there so i didnt even really say hi properly to him because i was in, well, awkward teenager mood. funny story though; he was jsut as shy and awkward as me? so that made me feel a bit better about the situation of awkwardness and we shared a magical goodbye hug..but thats because santosh is magical. no joke. 

anywho i am supposed to be making copies of this jam for JR tright now, but either there's something wrong with the mastercopy cd, or my burner is jsut fucked beyond all comprehension. i hope its not my burner, but seeing as this computer's such a decroded piece of crap and JR's recording studio..well..isn't, i wouldnt doubt the fault of wrecking two cd's by only copying three songs would be on my shitty piece of machinery. i think i'll see if the cd will copy itself onto my computer and maybe i can burn it that way...oy veh this is an ordeal. 

so i'm procrastinating cleaning the kitchen for a bit to write in this livejournal, even though i cant really think of anything significant to say at this moment.all i can say is that i'm pretty much ready for someone of the male gender (possibly a magical one!?!) could come and sweep me off my feet at any given time and it would not be a disapointment in the least. 

this time around though, the ""lust for love"" is muchos different from all the other times i felt ""boy-lonely""...i wouldnt describe it as a ""lonely"" feeling this time, because it's not like i'm looking for someone to make me happy...i guess it's because i've finally mastered the making-myself-happy thing. i just feel like i'm mentally ready to be found by someone special and have a functional, not fucked-up-inso-many-ways, mutually fond but not clingy or dependant relationship. i'm not even looking for some ""official"" ""will you go out with me"" sort fo relationship; just having someone to be fond of for their crazy self  who also jsut likes me for my crazy self that i can have fun with (sans judgementalness)and smooch and whatnot. I DUNNO. my friends hannah and roi have the ideal relationship i think. they both just started off having crush-like thoughts about each other, and after a lot of time being around each other and spending time and whatnot it's jsut wordlessly been established that htey only like each other and there isnt any need for hanky-panky with anyone but each other for the time being. none of that high-school lame ass ""you belong to me and i belong to you"" officialness bull shite.

i'm helping my dad's girl-friend-but-sometimes-just-friend-room-mate stephanie to organize all of her stuff, as she jsut moved into my dad's place and she has SO MUCH STUFF and she's all overwhelmed by the workload and stuff and i think that even jsut having some company would be nice for her. especially since she just loves me so much (i almost get overwhelmed by the amount of love energy she directs at me sometimes)that having my stop by ""home"" makes her feel super special and accepted and stuff...even though her and dad supposedly arent ""together"" right now, she feels like the ""step mum"" figure and it makes her feel  really good when sarah or myself make her feel like part of the family. that's probably why she likes me so much; i've always jsut treated her like an equal (liek i try to treat everyone because we ARE all equal)...maybe she's not used to that. plus in comparison to my overly-protective-and-possesive-of-dad sister sarah, i must seem pretty cool . ahhaaha lgadlygagbgjuilah bau9h aiugv a

i'm jsut getting over being all sick (i know...again...)and i jsut really dont want to go out and socialize with everyone jsut yet. in fact i'm not sure when that feeling wil pass. i think i just need to be a more home-based person in general for the next month or so till i go out to tristan's farm to work. i'm so excited for the summer to start. but i'm also happy being here right now and experiencing stuff...oi'm not sure exactly what stuff..but stuff. who knows, perhaps the tree planters will jam at JR's soon and i'll get to talk to santosh again...or like..properly because i wont get stoned and self-concious this time. but they may or may not have already left to tree plant...which is tragic beyond all else because they live in lee creek and i'll be living in chase and thats really close...but not close if they're not there. OY VEH.

you may think i'm being creeoy or obsessive about santosh because i've only met him once; i'm not obsessed. i'm jsut curious. he has magical energy and i'd like to be his friend. thats all. all of those guys are super awsome actually, and it's awsome that i hug them all and stuff because i feel as though i'll be knowing them for a long time. i know you've felt that about people you've met before; like you've already known them for a long time and obviously you'll know them more or less forever from now on? well i got that...like with andrew and roi and the guys from the big house; i recognized them the first time i met them and i knwo i'll always know them, even if i go years without seeing them. same with my close girlfriends, or my new (ish)friend trevor, who i spent about a week straight with as soon as i met him. or the davises. and corey layton.

anyhow...i'd like to start on the kitchen so i can eat some brekky and go help steph move stuff and tell JR that the burning process is fucked up...:|

"event","the way i see it, my mind is always changing because i'm always up for change. change is good. it keeps me on my toes. for example; after that five day drug binge i've re-come to the realization that i'd like to experience life in a concious light; as in i'd like to be aware in a really real sense. no more drugs. or coffee. or booze. i jsut dont feel the need to inhebriate myself anymore. i know i've said this in the past and like...stopped for ten or twelve days and then succumbed ot my love of the smell of pot and the fact that almost EVERYONE i know smokes it more or less chronically and the annoyed energy coming off my best friend when i tell her i dont want to smoke...all that has gone away now. i'm over it, its safe to say. 

i really want to experience the world for what it is. the good and the bad. the dark and the light. the loving and the confused. everything. if i hug someone i want to feel their energy purely, without a drug-induced confusion making the self-concious less-than-equal voice in my head bring me down; you know what? i am equal. we're all equal. i know i've said ""we're all equal"" forever, but i've never really thought about myself as equal; the only person i could think degrading thoughts about was myself. but in order to love others fully i needed to learn to love myself with as much enthusiasm. in order to come to this self-conciousness i have been repeating the affirmations "" i am equal "" and "" i willingly and conciously accept the right to be equal"" and it is slowly working and i am overcoming this horrible thought-pattern i've been in since i was, well...too young.

my mum told me that i should live life as i paint; do what i feel is right for it without really caring if anyone else likes the outcome, or thinks it's weird, or silly or WHATEVER. and it seemed so obvious. everyone should live life as a piece of art in the making. life IS an art project; it's just waiting to become a masterpiece. to me that means dancing when i feel moved, hugging when i feel a surge of love and affection towards someone, making funny noises when i feel them wanting to come out, liking the zillions of different kinds of music i do without worrying about who i'm with and what they might think of me, laughing at a cheesey movie without worrying about who's going to think i have crap taste in films, burst out running when i feel energetic, jumping, twisting, singing, hand holding, cheek kissing, sharing a thought at the time when it seems right to me!whenever i DO feel like doing any of these things, i've never felt any negative energy being directed at me for doing so, in fact, my eccentricness is usually appreciated....so why do i let my negative voice in my head tell me that i should restrain myself? it matters not because i'm completely done listening to her. she's being optimisticified.

along with all of these other changes in mind, i have become really fed up with computers and find myself not wanting to go on at all, but i feel an obligation to keep this journal updated. i dont know why. it's going to stop. and by stop i mean there will no longer be semi-daily entrees, there may or may not be semi-weekly or -monthly entrees, but thats it. i dont like having my mind subconciously controlled by this peice of technology. barf. i appreciate those of you who care enough about my thoughts to read this page of random ramblings (even though you may think my entrees are ""too long"":P). i love you. i love those of you who dont read this as well. i love everyone, though. lovelovelove. may 1st is global love day. so please hug as many people as you can ; who knows, maybe jsut one day of innitiating hugs will result in more hugs every day.:) and how could that be bad?!?!!?!?IT CAN'T, I TELL YOU, IT CAN'T!!!

speaking of loving people; i jsut met the most amazing new friend...who i knew in grade eight actually as well, but never really innitiated an actual frinedship...named trevor. he's jsut so interesting to talk to. i've been willingly and conciously accepting new love in my life lately, and i think that him being my new friend is a treaure. he's got similar views on life as i do; it's very refreshing. i thi8nk he'll be a life friend to hannah and myself. its so exciting to have found him so early on in this journey, this time around. i am very thankfull.

anywho, i need to go tinkle now, and i'm rather sick of this computer screen already, despite the pleasant green colour of my desktop and john lennon as my wallpaper. so this is where i bid you adieu.

ADIEU! and endless and unconditional love to you all!xoxoxooxox

"event","apparently MDMA is used by many psychiatrists in order to have a better connection with themselves and their clients. it is said that ""one dose of MDMA is equal to three monthes of psyciatric help""...it increases your desire to touch, hug and love the people around you , and it causes some to come to intense self-realizations.

when i treid this drug on friday, i couldnt tell that i was high. the thing is, i am always so full of love for my friends(and when i didnt it i was with people that i really love and enjoy being around)and even when sober i always have the urge to hug them and tell them i love them and appreciate them. also, in the past two weeks i have come to more self-realization than i ever really have before in my life. i think the drug didnt have too much of an effect on me because, at this point in my life, i am very aware of myself and of other people's energies and importance and uniquness. i find this interesting, because when i told hannah about this, she said ""i know..but think about it for a second...you really are high"" ...and i did..and i was. it is much different than ganja in the sense that i feel very connected to my brain and conciousness as opposed to completely disconnected from rational thought(this onlyhappens after consuming copious amounts of cheeba)and not sure what to say to people. 

i think that my experimentations are purely educational...i am finding out more about myself by experiencing how my body and mind react to these different forms of escapism from reality. i like to think that i'm going to come out of this unscathed in the sense that i will not have lost anytihng of myself, but more or less gained some knowledge and experience of life because i take breaks in between experimenting. the past five days i've more or less binged on experimentation, but its time to take a five day break now, i think. three different...shit no i guess including the chronic and alcohol its more like five, even though those are almost habitual by now. not so much alcohol but i'm so iused to the effects of pot that it doesnt really phase me anymore, hence the cutting down on my intake HARSHCORE. i only drink like once a month if that at all. so no worries, concerend amigos. no scolding will make me change my ways for the time being, i need to learn some lessons from this first. i cant see it lasting an unnessesarily long amount of time.

well today the sun is shining (as bob sings these exact words to me...), so i shall prepare myself for the day with food and tea and then i shall go out and find miss angela campbell and perhaps we can go wandering in the sunshine. wooooooooooooooooooooooooooo.

love love love to you ( a completely sober love that will never alter or fade)

"event","i had the BEST night last night. and you know why? because i wasnt expecting anything spectacular; it jsut snuk up on me!

it started out at the grind, where i drank a small amount of whiskey (as in like..two sips or something silly like that)and learned how to make all kinds of coffee; i am now a coffee makig MACHINE..and by mnachine i mean person with organs and blood pumping through them and whatnot.ANYYYYYYYHOW...i met the re-incarnate of bob dylan(and by met i mean i made a ice cap for him and we made saucy eyes at each other...also i think he went out with my friend steph davis in like grade 7 or 8 or something...i think i'll let him know that next time because it seems as though he'll be a regular at the grind...i'd like to be friends. because i'm good at that ,apparently :D)

after hannah got off work we wandered up to a big house party, which, surprisingly, was one of the best parties i've ever been to. it was so full of happy hippie love energy and everyone was jsut like ""i love you lets hug!"" and then we hugged. alot. so much hugging and love gazing and positive engery that it was WONDERFUL. i mean, i am always in the modd for hapy love energy sharing and hugging and touching and stuff, it jsut seemed like natural,...like everyhitng should be like that always...i think alot of the letting-loose of the positive energy has to do with the mass consumption of MDMA...but whatever. it seemed normal enough to me. i didnt mind people telling me they loved me and hugging me all the time, because, in my opinion, all of us are lie that all the time, but society has molded our brains into thinking that we cant show affection to everyone because they'll ""get the wrong idea"" or WHATEVER, so people use inhebriation as this huge excuse to act how they want to . its silly. i'd like to always hug people and say i love them becaus ei really do love them. actually...i do do that. HAHAHAH. its everyone lese who has to smarten up . hehe. yeeeeeeea.well i think i shall get dressed and do the tea thing with miss lucy burgess. 

i love you with the most sincerest of sincerness

"event","well then...apparently i cannot decide what i'm up for tonight...i've decided that i'll try out being social(if not only because i am wearing alot of colours tonight, thus making me feel like seeing people, but because it's friday and i should try for hannah, who wants to have an adventure), and if that doesnt work out i'll head on home for living in oblivion because i didnt finish it last night. thankfully, the grind is happening at 8:00 so i dont have to wait too long and risk losing my social enthusiasm. frank zappa is really making me feel in a party mood as well. fucing rihts frank zappa: how do you rock so hard without ever taking a break or letting up at all?!!?!?

i feel undescriblably antisocial lately though. its like the only people i REALLY want ot see are katherine phillips, annelise, tria, hannah and shannon(and santoge, but i dont see him often enough to hope to run into him randomly). my mum thinks its because this time in town before i move out for the summer is for self-discovery. i cant argue with that, because that seems ot be what's been mainly happening to me lately. also alot of good music discovery or rediscovery in my life right now. like the grateful dead and bob dylan(rediscovery) and joanna newson(new discovery)...oh yea, and also the song ""cars and telephones"" by the arcade fire.lovely. jsut awsomeness. all i ever feel like doing with myself is either listen to music while lying there and staring slash thinking at everything slash nothing or watching interesting films. i think i'll be watchig alot of films these next few monthes. 

so, i dont know why i celebrate st patrick's day, as st patrick was the guy who chased (violently) the druids our of ireland in order to establish christianity. what. the. fuck. do people realize what they're celebrating?! my mum and i have come up with the perfect counter-celebration for it though; drink whiskey, get rowdy and loud, and kick all of the christians out of our hippie fest at the grind. i think its works, although i'm not usually bitter enough about things to take prejudice action. i wont actually kick christians out of the grind. i'll jsut drink whisky and get rowdy and maybe vandalize a starbucks franchise:D. now THAT would be fun.

i'm thinking about making myself supper, but i dont feel hunry and i'm not sure what to eat because i'm not craving anything. normally, i would jsut turnj on the TV and wait for food commercials to find out what i really crave, but i realy cant see how it will help me to crave deep fried shit, when i've resolved to eat nothing but organic, free range, non-lactose things for awhile if not forever. basically i'll be living a mostly vegetarian lifestyle, excluding free range eggs. and the occaisional forcedupon me family-farm-raised-with-love peice of dead animal (well cooked...).

next week i've decided ot check out the job source location and do a random day job or five to get some money...i'm a little sick of being broke. i still have a ""christmas"" present to purchse that's waiting for me at spinners, and having hannah pay for everything is making me feel lame beyond belief. although i guess i've paid for her lots before when i was the one with the job...whatever we are even more or less; we're good at doing that without even meaning to. also i'd like to buy some groceries or something for my home so i dont feel liek i'm freeloading off of my mum.

i need to accquire a film-renting buddy. someone who has the same eclectic, CRAZY taste in films as i do. someone who can watch movies any given day of the week, without having to worry about school or a steady, wake-up-early job and such silliness. i'm thinking katherine phillips and levi stables will have to fill that position, as they're my only peeps that i can think of that fulfill such requirements. I'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

i really need to visit lucy. i am jsut finding it hard to be around her sad energy lately. i wish i could jsut be a good friend and go and comfort her and make her feel better and give her all of the self esteem she deserves to have, but she jsut seems incurable right now. no matter how much time i spend with her, she jsut seems to maintain this sad, pessimistic view on everything. i should jsut get over my super-sensitivity to other's energies and try to talk her out of this slump she seems to be in; i jsut wish she realized how wonderful she is. shes so beautiful and kind and talented and she jsut doesnt seem to see it. she does everything she can for her friends and doesnt think twice about spending her last money on taking a friend our for dinner, even if she knows that that perosn will never pay her back, or spend all day making a delicious meal for some who may not appreciate the effort she's put into this and have someone poitn out that theres ""sand in the spinach""...i appreciate you, lucy. so much. you've helped me when i needed you and it's time for me to suck it up and try harder to make you feel better. much harder than i have been. i feel liek an asshole for not putting every iota of effort i have into making you feel better, because you've always done the same for me. i hope shes not busy on sunday becuase i shall phone her and we can watch a random film and i'll bake some cookies or something and we can talk. ok. good plan, annie...now to put it into action.

i shall get off el computero now to eat some food while RAWKING out to system(which reminds me, i should call keith bes too:|i keep forgetting..too much innebriation)

love you all with every peice of me:D

"event","so i've decided that out of all of my high school friends who i havent seen for forever (even though i miss them all dearly) i miss brandon mills the most. seriosuly, i have so much fun with him, it makes me sad that i havent seen him for like two weeks and i didnt get a goodbye hug from pretty much only him...SAD. b-dawg, you are the most fun and random person ever and i'm amazed at the amount of time we can go on randomly about almost nothing for, laughing histerically. like that time me and shannon and him went randomly galavanting and dancing and slipping on ice and eating candy a bit? and whatever. silly that it only happened once. i miss shannon lake as well; i'm not used to being away from her for elongated periods of time and not speaking with her about all of our life troubles, and now that im bak in town, shes gone, so it'll be liek i week before i get to spend some chill-time with her. 


so now that i'm done whinig about THAT...my tooth hurts and i jsut figured out that my jaw is crooked and i need to somehow fix that.:| fucking orthodontists taking too long to straighten my teeht...i'm sure it has NOTHING to do with the fact that i've missed as many appointments as i've made...*coughcoughsnort*

HUMM...so its almost 7 and i wish that i felt motivated to go out and be social, but im so tired and i havent gotten over my anti-social spurt yet...so far the only people i've chillaxed with lately are my mum, her friends9on a small-scale level) hannah and annelise. its good though...slow transitions are smoother than jumpingin full speeeeeeeeeed into the social pool. 

also i rented the chumscrubber, living in oblivion and detroit rock city. obviously i'll be entertained, even if i have no one to cuddle up with (which i cant really see happening at all anyhow becuase, hey, there arent any takers save trian and annelise and cuddling with girls is losing its novelty.)or talk with or whatev. i'm over it. for serious. accordingto my palm reading i'll have two major major relationships in my life, and one semi-major one. and two kids? i dont know how i feel about that...because i cant really deal with them right now and if the world revolutionizes in 2012, i dont think having a kid before then (AS IF, HOLY CRAP) would be wise, as the chance of them snuffing it amungst the chaos is high. maybe i'll want them eventually...maybe.

AAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNNNNND i'm tired of writing on this thinger so i shall bid you adieu and good night.

"event","i blame you and you blame me and we're both right...


so my ""last weekend"" in kamloops (for a little hwile anyways) has been an interesting one. last night i pretty much did the usghe (<---which is the only way i can think of how to spell the first sound in ""usual"" in order to talk cool slang...); me and hannah decided we were going to make it a funfun party night with adventure and shit disturbing...only to end up passing out, halfbaked, midway thorugh some random film-watching at the big house with andrew and roi. the only thing we did differently is we decided to play chess at the grind earlier that evening(while listening to a couple of teachers from our, i mean hannah's(ha!), school play in their very constitutionalized sounding band)...only we made up the rules as we went along. not telling each other whatever rules we made up, and changing them throughout the game...we played three games and set up the board differently each time. it takes alot of concentration and skill if you ask me...to be truley entertaining, anyways. which it totally was!

today i went out for lunch/supper with my dad, his girlfriend, her son, my niece and my little sister at senor froggy's..then i bought some supplies (almost 100% natural, actually..my toothbrush is the only thing that wasnt made out of 100%organic materials...sweet i feel good about my choices already:D)for my moving out tomorrow evening. i came home, put my faerie shirt on and some spandex under my ripped jeans because its cold...then i walked to hannahs, had somem tea, watched some of fear and loathing in las vegas(one of the best fucking moveis EVER)and then went to hang out with my mum and levi and mary stables. we watched a jackie chan movie and laughed....alot. i had forgotten how hilariously entertaining jackie chan movies are; thanks, levi, for the reminder, you crazy fool, you. and by fool i mean awsome person! my mum and i convinced him to watch chocolat; that is an impressive feat, as most 20 something year olds arent super open minded about the appearing-to-be-cheesey-love-story thing. its an excellent movie; i'd tell anyone to watch it. its barely a romance...its more of a comedy and a drama than a romance, really.

FAAAAAAAAAACK...i have this tremendous cough now that spontaneously sprouted from my throat. i dont understand! why am i always getting sick?!?!! i feel like i should be way healthier due to the fact that a) i dont wash my hands super often so i SHOULD have an amazing immunity build up and b) i eat so moslty healthy that i should have enough vitamins and whatnot to keep me healthy! like it actually feels like i'm coughing up chunks of toburculosis or something..GAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWDDDDDDDDDDDDDD...i'm jsut kidding of course...but seriosuly. owch. so unfun.

so i guess i've left everything i REALLY need to do in order to prepare myself for semi-moving out tomorrow..for tomorrow. oh yeaaaaaaaa procrastination! two thumbs up. well my tea didnt make me sleepy likei though it would and my cough is NOT easing up...i dont know how the eff i am supposed to go to sleep while violently awake and coughing fit to die horribly.

well i have hardcore ADD and SNL is on...so i'm going to stop typing because any significant thought pattern i had before it gone now...LOVE LOVE LOVE!

"event","i feel so liberated. it was like as soon as i was done seperating myself from school some random gave me the best (possibly only?) mental high five of my life. it was so heartfelt and enthusiatic! it was more or less a sign that i am on the right path in life to better myself as a person. i planned on removing myself more or less completely from the system anyways, i jsut sped it up a little. my dad was even all supportive and stuff? it was weird he really didnt seem like he had a problem with it , he jsut said, ""i jsut want you to do what makes you happy"" and that works for me. i need to give everyone a great farewell-for-now hug tomorrow at the schhhhhhoooooooooliooolio tomorrow...cept hannah because i'll be spending the whole weekend with her talking to make up for the time we'll miss when i'm gone for a couple of weeks. 

so when i was walking home tonight i had this re-realization...like i've had the same realization before, but on a lower-understanding level. you see, i was getting really sketched out by this negative vibey guy with swishy track pants on all walking fast and ...well...sketchily and at first i was scared and he make this ""wishhhhhhhhhhhhh"" sound really oudly with his vocal chords (i got the feeling he was seeing if he could...sketch..me out, luckily i only shudder inwardly when things startle me...sometimes:|)and before i could get super panicky about the whoel situation(sketchy guy at ten past midnight on a thursday being scarryyyy), but then i got this cloud of positivity blanketing my mind, and i decided to say ""thank you for sending love to this guy, because it seems like he needs it if he's giving off such a sketchy vibe"" (to god, the creator of the universe, allah, buddah, krishna, ganesha, zuess, jesus, the infinite, whicever name you prefer)and just sending love vibes his way. within seconds , no, demi-seconds, i felt absolutely no fear, but jsut pure love. i then realized that love can absolutely abolish anything. fear, anger, jealousy, depression, sketched-outedness, bitterness...all you have to do is learn to love everybody.

but please remember, dear borthers (CLOCKWOROK ORANGE STYLE, YEEEAHHH), that there are many different kinds of love, and the kind of love i am talking about isnt neccesarily the infatuated in-love kind of love, nor the undconditional friendsship/bonding love, nor even the unchangable family love, but jsut the continual respect-for-human-kind love that is a result of appreciating everyones right to expression, uniqueness, eccentricity, mind expansion, divineness and choice. it's all quite amazing if you think about jsut how intricate all the thoughts in the world are. so many people have so many views on everything, and everyone's usually trying to dorwn out the truley unique ones in order to maintain order in society. ""let's make up a shiteload of mental disorders and diagnose everyone in north america with one, and inject them with mind-altering pharmacudicals that keep them in line. read brave new world and think hard about soma; it's alot like taking anti-depressants or ridalin...doesnt it occur to people that maybe some people were born with an excess amount of enrgy for a purpose? and ADD kids; maybe they're here with a short attention span so they can learn the lesson of self control and concentration, instead of jsut depending on chemicals to do it for them? if you ask me, humans (or, ultimately the anunake and illuminate) are basically trying to sneakily beat us into submission with ""socially accepted"" forms of drugs ( and, actually illegal drugs as well; acid was put out by the government to take the hippie's on a random ADD path that took them away from their love revolution...serisouly...when was acid introduced? the 70's...when did the love revolution turn into the sex revolution and the drug revolution? in the seventies, right before the hippies reached their peak of ultimate spreading the word of awsomeness...thewn they got distracted and the revolution died and was reborn as something else)to keep us from discovering what we really came here to do...which is most likely to spread the love. seriously. you actually feel better when you start jsut sending love vibes to people you see on the street, whether they are sketchy, or drunk, or sad-looking, or crippled, or jsut lost looking, or angry, or even depressing to look at; chances are the more awkward the vibe they have, the more they need a little extra love sent their way, however anonomously it may be sent. they get the message no matter what. 

well then it appears to be one o'clock...i thin ki shall go to bed as so i am able to wake up at a semi-decent hour and make my way to el schoolio for lunch undt last bloc.

endless and unconditional LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE to you!

"event","""take your time
think alot
why, think of everything you've got
for you will still be here tomorrow
but your dreams may not""

-cat stevens-

this awsomley radical super quote from cat steven's song ""father and son"" basically describes what i've been doing for the past monthes, and also my conlusion that came to my descision of leaving school; if i would have stayed in school my body would, indeed, still be wandering the hallways of skss, but my dreams and ambitions would have died due to under-use.its sad but true. and i know its rather melodramatic to say,but i really feel as though my soul would have closed up and died if i wouldnt have listened to my heart and decided to escape to the country instead of finishing high school at this point. i really feel that all of this (semi) alone time will help me get back in touch with my spirituality, and ponder the meaning of my existance, and possibly all of that pondering will lead me to a better understanding and acceptance of mnyself.

as much as i hate school, i am really really going to miss the people (as in my friends) who are there to make it bearable for each other(and for me so far...i definitly would have dropped out sooner if my acting class hadnt have rocked so hard). honestly i jsut recently made friends with jessie and he's actually one of the coolest people ever, and if i wasnt removed from the system (you hacve no idea how elated that fraction of a sentence ""i'm removed from the system"") i would probably find myself having a crush on him before too long. good thing i'll never have to go through more of the high school rejection, as i really think it's been damaging to my self esteem...but i've come to the conclusion that everything's going to happen as it will, andi'll learn from it all and after this so called difficult year is over, i will find myself in an aware and happier state of mind. i do so lust for someone to snuggle with though..*SIGH*. well it'll be awhile i'm sure as there arent any individuals up at the  rubinsons farm except my practially-relatives (the rubinsons themselves!), and as i'll only be coming in to town once a week for two day periods at a time, i dont think i'll be meeting anyone special until i have my N and am able to drive back and forth at will. even then the outlook is cloudy, as my luck in the affection department has been less than awsome.HOH WELL. i need to figure out myself before i try to figure anyone else out at this point and time anyways.

i'm going to miss hannah so so much when i'm gone though, she's the only one that i see regularily that really seems to understand where i'm coming from. if she wasnt there to talk to me about everything, i think i'd more or less have exploded form inner angst by now. obviosulyi will be calling her frequently. but not too frequently in the first two weeks because i really need to semi-dinstance myself from everyone in order to gather thoughts; if i spend all of my tim eomn the phone i'll never have any independant thought time. and that will be silly and rahter counterproductive.

so it jsut occured to me that my dad hasnt really heard about my..ahem...plan yet. i wonder how he feels about being virtually no part in my life-descision-making process. hopefully he's not too sore as he's not exactly a great parent and he cant really claim the right to have a say in my life. thanks for buying me shoes all these years dad, but no matter how angry you get at me its not really going to phase me or change my mind. not like i could now if i tried because everyhting's set and done. despite my teachers best efforts to change my mind; i can't really understand their spontaneous affection, as the majority of them either showed little to no interest in me, or jsut straight up irritation.......i actually felt no ill-content coming from mrs taylor, i really liked her because she was super into opinions and stuff...open mindedness is important to maintain in a corrupted system like ours.

well i should go layer up properly as tonight's my last open mic for awhile and i'd like to get some fun-time in and not be too late. farewell and goodnight.

"event","have i professed my undyinglove for bob marley lately?no? well i am now...soo good. i will seriously never ever get sick of bobs soothing reggae beats and positive affirmations of the human race. it's jsut good in so many ways. i pretty much havnet stopped listening to it since i was born, and i dont think i ever will. 

apparently almost nothing will go smoothly this year for me, as i am the yielding dragon and as it is the year of the dog, apparently my hardships are the worst this year. i'm feeling ok about that though...a lesson is learned from essentially everything that is ever experienced; one hard year is only going to make me appreciate the awsomeness of the years to come. 

my friend shannon is so awsome.(not like my other friends arent, but i've some to this great appreciation of her lately). she's jsut so supportive ad always does her best to make others feel better and is so full of SPUNK that it automatically gives me energy and pizazz jsut being around her!like, even if she doesnt agree with your descisions, she never tries to force her opinion on anyone; she'll tell you her opinion, but its always jsut such a ""i care about you, please dont take this is any oter way either than me being concerned about your well-being..jsut listen and contemplate"". and she's so talented: i wish she realized it on a more ultimate level; SHANNON YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO REASON TO EVER FEEL SELF CONSCIOUS! you're beautiful and musical and creative and funny and dont ever forget it! no haircut will ever look bad on you, even if b oneil gets pretend angry at your hairdresser for lack of length...you're fabulous. and always will be.  i wouldn't have been able to stay happy and sane(from certain perspectives...)for this long if it wasnt for yours, hannah and annelise's friendsships...you're my shining stars. i love you endlessly and unconditionally.

so it's 3:30 and i've cleaned the kitchen and tidied my room and am doing laundry...i'm not really sure what to do with myself rightnow so i think i'll make some tortelini chicken soup.:)WOOHOO.

"event","which is exactly what i intend to do...it's almost 100% set up that i will be moving out to the rubinson's farm for a couple of months to be a woofer; paula put it as my ""need to get away from the city"" and it made sense, so i wasnt going to argue. this tim ein the bush will help me to re-asses my values and put my thougts together in a rational manner...because right now i dont have the time or means to know what i'm thinking...also i wont be consuming *ahem* substances when i'm up at the farm so my mind will be sooo clear..and the fesh air and the organic food and the...ohhh yeaaa. i'm really excited and it feels like a huge weight has been lifted off of my shoulders.

i realize that alot of people will be disapointed in my descision, but it doesnt really bother me because it really seems like the healthy thing to do right now; learning about organic farming seems alot more useful to my life plan than anything i would be learning in school. plus the option of GED in a couple years is always there if i change my mind about the necessity of high school. i'm sorry to my friends and family that will probably have some negative feelings towards me for a while because of this descision...but it's my life and i've fully thought about it from all angles; please jsut have faith in my intelligence and realization about my current situation, i'm a little more rational than you would think. (this isnt to ALL friends and family, because i know there are a couple of you that support me and trust me...just the ones who are overly-concerned with my well being... my being will be fine, if not better, because of this descision, please understand that it's alot better than feeling an over-powering soul-crushing sensation every day for four monthes; oi can see it seriously damaging my personality)

the rubinsons farm is the perfect choice because:
-it's really quite in the middle of nothing; lots of alone time
-i have the option of coming into town whenever i want as becky drives danielle to her dance classes every day...yes she has them every day of the week
-i'll be spending time with people who love me and want to teach me about usefull things.
-lots of music will be played as they are all into that there
-film watching is also a big thing there so that rocks too(they have good choices in films as well so they'll appreciate the eclecticness of my favorites)
-my cell phone works up there and as i have free long distance its not going to cost a cent to keep in contact with people..actually it doesnt cost anything to call from the normal phone up there either...i guess what i meant to say is that it wont cost people any long distance to call me on the cell and i can call them back on the land line as to not get brain cancer
-no internet up there; i'll have to rely on myself and noone else to keep my thought patter sane, which will make me alot more self-sufficient
-with nooine my age to compare myself with, my self esteem problems will probably be fixed after awhile
-i'll have more time and initiative to learn songs well to play at open mic at the grind on thursdays
-i'll lose all urges to wear make-up and uncomfy clothes (not liek i really ever wear uncomfy thigns in the first place...but still)
-by being away from my friends i'll appreciate them more and cherish the time i get to spend with them when i'm in town instead of taking their awsomeness for granted
-i'll appreciate my mum more as well for the same reason(and my sister and dad etc)
-as i'll most likely be making a small amount of money, i'll be able to save it as there wont be anywhere to spend it

WELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL...i need to clean the kitchen and my room and put some laundry on and consume some more water to flush the sickness out of me..faretheewell loveers

"event","oh my GAWD i'm going to die because i feel sooo sick...out of nowhere. head ache almost sore throaght and random pukey ness i never seem to get..bah...also my not wanting to go to school has become a neccesity for the survival of my mental health. i'm currently phoning mendal and paula( they own an organic farm up past savona)to see if they need any help; ie me being a woofer for them, doing farmwork or cleaning the house or cooking or WHATEVER for a couple of monthes in exchange for room and board. pretty sweet. plus they're like my other set of grnaparents practically because they've known me since i was like...3 or something.my mum says i can drop out as soon as i have a plan. this is my plan. it needs to follow through or i'm going to do something rash. 

before you jsudge me to harshly here's another piece of information that makes dropping out make SO MUCH SENSE: in thwo years i can take ONE TEST that takes a few hours and get my high school diploma; do i choose four months of iftody and HELL or do i choose a few hours of review in a couple of years IF i find it necessary to grad at all...i like the latter, personally. plus learning how to grow food seems about ten million times more important in this day and age than learning how to convert a general form algebra equation into a standard form, which, b-t-w, i DO know how to do. dont be all assuming that i'm dropping out because my two english classes, socials and math proves to be too heavy a workload; i haev over 80% in all my classes so dont fucking worry about it. i simply cannot take the bull crap. 

i really dont like that my body took the initiative to make me sick so i wouldnt have to go to school...i guess it was my own fault for thinking about it so hard all the time, but i really dont enjoy being ill, and it isnt really worth the huge headache and dizziness...BAH. silly mind power effing me over...but i guess i'll be able to read alot tomorrow. WOOHOO. i may or may not have a fever; my hands are cold so everything feels warm. i think i'll get my aunt to check it for me ...apparently i have one. FAAAAAAACK. well i wont be seeing any of youse at school any time soon...if at all? no im kidding...i'm coming to choir on thursday if i'm not too sick(BFSAK ZILGAHL GDSAH!!!@@##@%#$DSAJK LFVBAL)to sing...which i was todya so that sucks. anywho have a lovely night and i hope you watch a good film in the near future.

"event","i am currently conteplating the option of drop-out-ism. nothing in my mind is opposing it; not even the part of my mind that is knowledgable of the fact that there are only four monthes left and i'd might as well ""finish what i've started""...for starters...i didnt start it; i was forced at a young age to consume all the school bullshit..and even though i was promptly yoinked out and homeschooled from grade two until grade five, i still had to learn alot of useless information, as nice as the setting change was.

see, the problem with most drop outs is the fact that they act in haste, and proceed to go from one extreme to the other and choose to party every night and forget about knowledge; the reason i'm dropping out is because i'm sick of stooping to the stupidity level of school. everything that is ever discussed in school, i have already thought about, and formed a firm opinion on. therefore i dont take kindly to people telling me what my opinion should be, as most teachers do in the attempt to conditionalize the masses. all i have to say is fuck you, you capatilist pigs. yea that's right i said it. ...that may or may not have been the activist listening to system of a down full blast in her room (she lives in my mind) talking. i'm going to go with yes, it was....but shes a part of me too and deserves to be heard..

the way i see it, the only thing keeping me in school right now are other people's opinions; but to do soemthing for soemone else and not at all for oneself, especially if that something is against all of ones beliefs and morals, is more or less denying ones own truths jsut to please the majority. and thats fucked. seriosuly though, the only answers i can think of for the ""why am i still here"" question are ""because you're going to be the first in your family to grad, and people will be dissapointed in you"" (dissapointed in what, pray tell? the fact that i refuse to continue to be conditionalized and told that my ideals are ""weird"" and that i'm going to beccome a ""loser"" because i dont put huge amounts of importance on making money and refuse to have a five dya a week 9-5 job working for the government....fuckers) and the other response is either ""i dont know!!!!!!"" or ""because i should finish what i've started""(<---you've seen the response to that one above^), and obviosuly ""i dont know"" is unsatisfactory.

i cant think of one plausible answer to the question. the simple way of putting this descision is , do i want to spend the next four monthes depressed because i hate what i'm doing every day? i think the answer is obvious. i wouldnt be caught in some job that i hate doing every day, and i would get paid for that, so why would i stay in school jsut for the acception of society? society is fucked in my opinion and the only people's opinions whome i truley trust are people who have turned their backs on society too. its not that i'm narrow minded; i am stoked on hearing other's opinions and i like seeing where other people are coming from; i jsut dont believe in forcing ideals on other people; and that is exactly what school has been and will be doing to children and young adults for who knows how long. it's a sneakier way than in brave new world, but its basically the same principle. 

i'm getting this feeling of elation while thinking about staying at home and cleaning and playing guitar and piano and drums and stuffing envelopes for money and learnign yoga and tai chi instead of putting up with this bull crap for the next four monthes. it seems like a waste of life to spend more time here, when i've got more figured out than most of the teachers trying to tell me how to think. being here is only creating more frusteration than a person should have to deal with.

i'm going to recite some soad for you now...

crackpipes, needles pcp and fast cars
kinda mix really well with dead movie star
when i feel like talking i'd never be wrong
if i feel like walking yo best come along
i roll up my windows crank the heat up high
till my plams are wet and my tongue is dry
i'm looking for a mother that'll get me high
just a stupid mother fucker, if i die, i die


i love how sarcastic this band is at all times. they;re so meaningful and at the same time so cheekily mocking the system. endless and unconditional love towards them.

i've rediscovered my love of funk. this lovely band called the bombay laughing club played at the grind on friday and they blew my mind. i was in a terrible mood; being flung violently to the ground my the system; and as soon as they started to play i had to dance, and i couldnt stop until they played the last song. my mood was completely changed around and i hadnt felt that good in sooo sooo soo long. plus making friends with the band  (mostly santosh, the bassist/vocals/saxophone player)at the afterparty at my mums friends michelle's place was amazingly fun. making stuff up is my favorite; i've resolved to start playing the points game again, as it is endlessly entertaining. also hackie sack is a delight beyond all comprehension. 

there are twenty minutes left in class...i dont really know how to kill that time as i've ranted about all i need to right now. i'm ranted out, as soemone would say. 

i cant wait to farm in the summer. if i could fast farward time i would. only i suppose things are meant to be learned and experienced before then, so rushing things might be a mistake.

i feel so cheeky writing on this livejournal page when i'm supposed to be doing some stupid short story assignment...oh well if i'm dropping out it doesnt matter if it gets done or not anyways. actually i think i'll finish it anyways so ms if has soemthing to remember me by;)...not like she'll really appreciate a re-written version of ""labyrinth"", starrring david bowie, anyhow...but oh well. it's more for my entertainment anyways.

i need to get rid of my cell phone. i hate it so much. its always on me, always on, and always ringing. i cant even screen my calls because there isnt call display or anything, and i cant just leave it in my bag and not answer it incase my mum decides she needs to call me. it was so much simpler when i could jsut take a couple quarters and use a pay phone when my plans change. GAHHHHHH. we were so cloose to being rid of them too; too bad it costs 200$ to return them:O...i know...absofuckinglutely ridiculous.

but it looks teacher dearest has asked us to come back to the classroom....i like this better than my msnspace thing so i'm going to rant here form now on.

endless and unconditional love

"event","I am, once again, feeling awkward and discontent and just...BAH-ish. I am so sick of school that I can barely even think about having to go back next year withough being high for every moment of it. Only that's ridiculous, expensive and impossible. And I don't think I'd survive if I did that. Not that I have a chance of surviving now, anyways...I have to somehow do enlgish, math and soicials 11 before I graduate...as well as English 12. That doesn't leave alot of spare time for next year. And now that I'm used to haveing all of this free time I cannot picture having to stay in a building for 6 hours of my day and then going to work and then doing homework and FRICK. I am just going to have toi pull myself out of it. I need to concentrate. I had better get mylself to finish PE at least before the summer starts. I* want to get high and go play basketball. Right now. But it's not even 1:00 therefor all of my potential basketball buddies are at school. Fricking frick.
I am also feeling a little fat and alot lonely. (And alot mad at my chihuahua because she is annoying and I want to kill her with a knife. Actually, I don't but I'd like to sell her or give her away or something because she won't SHUT UP.) I've decided that I am going to not have solid food for awhile as I will feel better about myself once I shrink my stomach. I need to be good at guitar so I don't feel as lame when I pay with Dawson next...he is amazing at guitar. I guess he has to be because he's been playing since he was 7 freaking years old. I suppose I should probably get off of the computer and  clean more so I don;'t feel like I havent accomplished anyhting today...

"event","Well, then. My party was, from many points of view(except perhaps the people I kicked out...)a success.

There was live music from about 8 until about 3 in the morning. Amazing. That is the kind of thing I need to do more often. ( I have a feeling that this summer will be filled with music..) Just the feeling of..mutual fun. When you get like 20 people in a room who all love listening to and playing music you get such a good vibe and such a friendly feeling; like you could just hug everyone in the room, even if you don't really know them very well. I made friends with Dan and Josh( they are in this rockin-awsome local band called Vinyl Cause...check them out if you get the chance; they're amazing)and I forgive them for being a billion times more musical than me.

There was also some mad dancing at the beginning of the night, consisting mostly of me switching the music every 30 seconds and me and Heather dancing like crazies to all of our favorite songs...sadly Hannah didnt fall in the rain this time, as that was one of the highlights of last year's birthday bash. If only I would have remembered to take some pictures of this year's shin dig.

I think alcohol may impaire my judgement more so than the average person; as I only had the smallest amount of it on Saturday night and I ended up smooching with this older guy that I have apparently had a crush on for quite some time that I thought had gone away (the crush on the boy, because the boy did go away..to Vancouver)but when he got here I led him away to the trampoline and we sat...well, not sat as it IS a hammock; it was more of a squished cuddle...for an elongated period of time and the cuddling turned into mad making out somehow. The problem is I really have no excuse for being so pervy, as the amount of alcohol I had shouldn't have messed with my head as much as it feels like it did; but he had the excuse of being really drunk. Lucky guy. Now, normally I wouldn't be talking about this as if it were a bad things, seeing as I've been ranting on about how much I wanted to smooch someone( which, by the way hasn't changed......oy veh), but there are a few tiny details that have put a damper on the stokededness of my feelings. Such as the tiny thing about him living in Vancouver and there being a plump age difference between us. I'm not actually stressed about the situation; it was insanely comfortable just lying there and talking (and trying to get warm on my part), I am more just trying to igure what I think about it at all. Honeslty the casualness of my feelings about the happenings saddens me because I don't really feel that emotional about this. I feel like a total ass, not only because I pretty much took advantage of a drunk person who also happens to be my friend, but also the fact that he seems a bit stressed about the whole thing as he was asking to make sure there was no ""bad blood"" about it and I was like ""obviously not"" because I can't see myself being awkward around him or stop talking about my lactose slash his soy problem...should I be more awkward about this? Am I being too detached about this? It's not like I don't like him because I do really feel he is super important to me and stuff but I feel like I am just accepting the fact that nothing is going to happen with this too easily without being upset about it. I feel like it wasn't that big of a deal, but I feel like he felt like it was but it shouldn't have been... I think I need to just accept that my attitude about it basically jsut being the result of lusty teenage hormones mixed with lusty drunken hormones. My casuality is officially normal. This is officially wiped from the slate of my memory as something stressfull or emotionally damaging. In any case I will continue to hope for some meaningfull relationship with someone closer to my age, and hopefully in the near future. The tricky thing is finding someone as mentally abstract as me but also as sexually amish as far as sex goes.(as in it scares me like it should a 12 year old)

I am going to Edmonton on Wednesday and I am so excited! My friend Shane and I are going to try and bring our guitars and busk during our free time ahahah. Yes. I am stoked. I need to find some black clothes, though. So I should get off the internet as I need to make lunch for Eli and Brian and then head off to my 3 hour shift at Movie Mart, as well as ask Lucy to lend me black stuff so I don't get castrated by the choir teacher (a metaphorical castration, obviously because I do not have the right genetalia to be castrated for real)

Have a HAPPY last couple monthes before SUMMMMMMMMER!

Aka: I had lots of fun with Lucy and Ben, but when I got home (at roughly 1:30) there was a note on my bed saying(quote) "" WHERE R U?!?! I'M WORRIED!"" from my mum, and I went upstairs to find her waiting up for me in the living room and I am now grounded and am not alloiwed to have friends over for the night;which normally wouldn't sound bad if it weren't for the fact that I NEVER GET GROUNDED. Sick. It's working out OK though becuase Shane, Shannon and Jasper were all just over here and they are coming back shortly with Annelise and Chelsey added to the crowd. So much for listenign to my mum? I'm a bad daughter and I'm feeling rather guilty about all of it. I mean she knew Jasper and Shannon were here because they got here before she left...but she didnt want anyone else here...I don't think they'll stay too long though...as they are all going to the movie at around 9 I think.

I already got some pretty nice karma for sneaking out anyways: I am so crazy sick it sucks bum...I was in bed for about 85% of the day today and the other 15% was spent getting water and fruit for myself(and now typing and whatnot..) my throat feels like it's going to die twice as bad as it was last night. And I'm twice as boy lonely and feeling fat so I think i've pretty much payed the price for being a bad daughter by health problems and lack of self confidence.

           When you eat meat, it attracts the layer of sodium in your stomach (the one that keeps your stomach from eating itself..)and creates stomache ulcers. EW.

So I'm basically pretty screwed over...actually I do beleive I can continue to work during the summer, I jsut can't hand anything in until next school year.
       
I feel so incredibly lame right now...and I'm not exactly sure why because I was pretty accomplished last week with the schooling and whatnot. Maybe it's my lack of social feelings. Which is a lie..because I totally want to go hang out with my friend Lucy or Hannah or Annelise or Shannon or Karri or John or go say HI so Katie or Amanda at Zacks...OK THEN...I like how I figure out what I'm feeling while I'm typing it; making it crazy hard to follow...even I don't really understand what I'm trying to say. I think it's something like ""I'm feelign social, but only towards certain people and only one of them at a time.."". Does that make even an inkling of sense? No? Fair enough.
        Let's run through what I've done today(I'll make a nice little list..)
- Woke up at bloody 7 am and went to get a filling(supergood!)
- Walked home(without even buying a coffee..)
- Went on the computer-checked my email 
                      -checked my WebCT(to no avail, I still can't get past
                      the grammar section because I havent taken the unit exam, 
                       even though I've finished Lord Of the Flies and am 
                       nearly doing Macbeth now..)
                      - wrote on my msn space
                      -talked to Douglas Weibersteinhaus on msn
                      - watched Hotel Rwanda, and ate Honey Nut Cheerios and 
                       cried like a baby while doing so
                      - missed Lucy's instant message(replyed)
  
And now I'm writing on here because apparently I'm crazy-inspired to write crap about nothing in particular lately.
         
Yea..not so full-of-excitement as I'd hoped. I think I'd like to start writing a play now, and include all of my friends and my crazy random scenes we've come up with over the past year. But I might want to work on English and Socials 11 as a side project..heh..Oy Veh.

Have a SPLENDID day seeing as it is SPLENDID outside. SPRING IS IN THE AIR LA LA LA LA LA.

"event","i need to sort some things out in my head. today's topic i think will be sex and love. is it wrong to have sex before marraige? i really dont think that it would be. i think that if you have feelings for somebody and love them then its ok..what if you dont even beleive in marraige?i mean in theory it is nice, but dont you think it would be nice to be able to trust your partner or the person you love enough to know that at that moment in time they feel like they DO want to spend the rest of their lives with you, without having to rely on a promise you made in front of everyone to make it ""official"" or ""binding"". shouldn't just the feeling at that time be good enough? because hearts can change, and if they do why should anybody have to live the rest of their lives pretending to love someone, instead of going out and finding someone they really do love. i mean..i DO beleive that there is somebody for everybody; one special soul mate that you are destined to be with...but how can you be sure that you will find them your first try? i dont think that alot of people can be that lucky.and if you feel that you love someone enough to give them that special part of you that you give when you have sex with them...shouldnt that jsut be a wonderful, beautiful thing? the problem with sex is the absolute casualty that has sort of festered around the thought of it: alot of people jsut have sex as a physical thing and dont allow themselves to phsycologically open up to the person they are doing it with..i think that not loving somebody that you are having sex with would take away from the beauty of the act: which is probably why our world is so broken:there is not enough love. not jsut that kind of love either...but the kind of general love for the planet and everything on it is missing too. so many people are jsut waiting for excuses to hurt others and destroy beautiful things for power. if everybody just learned to love everyone else jsut a little more i guarentee that the world would brighten up a bit. think about it;its simple: do you fel better when you are happy and optimistic feeling or when you are grumpy and pessimistic? i know it seems like a hoplessly stupid and obvious question, but maybe thats all it really is.a simple question that everybody is just over thinking. to yoink a tidbit from an old Aesop's Fables book i has as a kid: the man only held onto his cloak tighter when the wind tore viciously at him, but took it off easily aand happily, even, when the sun shone down warmly....

frick...i think i've over-thunk myself..well if you do happen to be reading this and it makes even a little bit of sense please feel free to send me an email on your thoughts about my ramblings to rainbowsaresexy@hotmail.com and maybe put the subject as ""reply to your craziness"" or something hahahaha

i hope your days (and nights, i suppose because i am feeling like quite the night-owl lately and it would be a shame to forget those twelve-ish hours jsut because of the lack of light)are wonderfu and ahppy and far less confusing and over-thunk than mine!flippin flip and bloody hell to my cranium..."

"event","my life reminds me of jalepeno flavoured tofu cheese. it's flavourless until you hit the tasty little bits of spicy, which can be quite frequent in one section, but depressingly scarce in another.i'm currently in a jalepeno-free zone.i think i might have a mental disorder.is it normal to have about ten mood swings in one day?well not ten, but i find myself going from really happy and then one little thing can make me free-fall into depression. i guess i cant't actually call it depression because it's not like i'm depressed enough to write an intense emo song or feel suicidal or any of that sort of ridiculousness. 
       i think i might just be dissatisfied with my current life situation.my life isnt anywhere near depressing;i work at a movie store and that's pretty cool because, hey, money is good and i get free rentals, i am starting virtual school to finish grade eleven, so the only time i will ever have to go to ""hell"" (as school is frequently looked at as)is to possibly take acting class, i have wonderfull friends and an awsome boiyfriend and understanding parents. i can't really complain about anything either than the fact that everything i do turns into a rutine(how do you spell that?i have no clue)and i currently have no where to rant about everything thats pulling my brain apart. until now. i now have this online journal. it's the perfect escapism because not only will it be helpful with practicing my journalism and or writing skills but it is going to be completely mine(aside from the occasional person i dont know reading this), because i odnt intend to tell shane or any of my friends that i have this thing...as they have al read my normal journal i think it's important for my mental well being to have something this confidential, (if confidential is the word i am looking for...which i don't think it is).
        as this introduction of my life has taken up quite a bit of space, i am going to rant about my day at a later hour,s eeing as i have to go to wrok for 7 hours...hopefully my mood will brighten once i get there.

love annie"

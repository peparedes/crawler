today has been tiring
yet i didnt really do anything
i was just there.

i blame the mood on the weather
because no one likes to blame themselves.

english was surprisingly easy
but anything is when people do the work for you.

a 20 ounce pop and a vending machine snack
do not make for a good meal.
thankfully someone had my back.
a cold, smushed burger probably wasnt better
but it sure did hit the spot.

"event","Yes. Singing Oklahoma tunes in my head. Even though I'm listening to FrouFrou. Last night was pretty busy at work around the 7 o'clock hour (Friday night everyone wants to see the show) and my feet are now hurting AND I work the late shift tonight which means I'll be up till 12:30 or later. Boo. :( AND I still have to finish those portraits for Beth. Yikes. Time is slipppping away from me...right through my fingers. But I do have a vacation to look forward to a week from today. All next week my hours are pretty long (working every day except Sunday and Monday) and then Saturday we are leaving for the family vacation at CALLWAY GARDENS! Woot. And then....well about a month till school starts. And how scary/exciting/nothing is that?"

"event","Why do I get so hopeful when I meet a nice guy, even though I know that probably nothing will ever come of it? I mean why should anything happen? It never has in the past and I don't know why all of the sudden I seem to think that it's time for boys to start paying attention to me and, heaven forbid, actually doing something about it. God, I know You've got a plan for me and I know I should just stop being concerned (or at least realize that none of my actions would merit attention from boys anyway). The fact is, just for once I want things to work out for me. I want the boy (ha, or boys) that I like to like me back! And it wouldn't hurt if they actually made the first move! Is that so difficult? Lord, give me patience and forgive my presumptuousness. I know that I have other much more important things to focus on before I consider a boyfriend. Perhaps that is the point. Perhaps He is using this to put me in the right place spiritually before I am ready for a meaningful and worthwhile relationship? Sounds good to me. :) It always helps to work these things out in writing. Well, thank God for patience and always the hope of something better around the corner...."

"event","Drinking is evil. Or at least drinking too much is. And that is why it is something I will never do again. Because hangovers suck. A lot. Ouch my head. Ok so last night I totally wasn't planing on going out AT ALL. I wanted to do homework and then perhaps go swinging....yes, like on a swingset. That, unfortunately, did not happen. I ended up going to Katie's house with Stacks and there consumed far too many shots for my own good (which was about 5 or 6). And then (somehow) we went to the Sticks. That was fun, I admit. But it would have been more fun if I were sober. I did ""meet"" some people, or rather just see drunk. Bill Richards was there....yes Tom Richardss older brother and Nate's housemate. I know, I know. Where has my concern for reputation gone? Lord knows, but I really want it back. I need to talk to Adrienne.....Truth is, I really DON'T want to do this again, so God, please give me self-control. Help me to learn to say NO!!!"

"event","So this is Spring Break 2005 and so far it's been a blast!! I still really can't believe that I'm actually in college and experiencing this break as a college student. Now, I know what you're thinking: ""Gosh, it's been 6 months and she still can't handle the fact that she's a living, breathing 18 year old?!?"" Well, yes folks, it's quite true. I'm having reality conception difficulties. It just seems like yesterday that I was in 8th grade (in fact I was looking at photos last night and my appearance hasn't really changed much since then....still haven't lost 20 pounds...) and yet I must admit to myself time and again that it's actually been about 5 years since then. I've graduated from Lovett (yet another tough fact to deal with) and a lot of things have happened in just one semester at Hillsdale that have made me question who I am and where I stand. But, not to worry, these questions are always easily answerable...it's simply a matter of returning to God. ""Simply"" is an easy word to say, but in fact, the actions are much harder than the words. So these are the thoughts that are never too distant from my mind. Nonetheless, I can tell that this break is already doing me worlds of good. Home is such a good place to be and I love it. So here's to a great Wednesday! Thank God for being home with family and friends."

"event","Google the lyrics to Paramore's ""Misery Business"" and Avril Lavigne's ""Girlfriend"" and that's baaaasically my life in a nutshell right now.
School/Exams are done tomorrow. It's been the most incredible semester of my life. I never imagined I'd find such a balance between fun with friends and studying. Work hard, party hard.

Going home on Saturday to start working two jobs because I leave for my month in London in like 50something days. My brother is going to be home the whole time I am. He's playing the last month of warped tour.&nbsp;Chrissy and I&nbsp;want to follow him for a few shows, it would be fun.

Growing up is really scary, fun and cool. I like it."

It'd be neat to have this journal unlocked 
due to the fun nature of lurking... However
I'll save the creepy lurking as my <b>own</b> hobby.
Comment to be added. Please & Thank you. </center>"

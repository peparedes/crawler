"event","YAY!!!! We are finally DONE with actually attending Prout! I say attending because we are all well aware  of the fact that we aren't exactly just going to pick up and walk away, even if some of us say that's what we're gonna do. We'll be in and out over the next little while, I'm sure.

Anyway! Yes! I have finally done what my parents, Ms. Hoyt, My other absolutely awesome and favorite teachers (Doc H., Greco,...), and myself especially, have been working towards, and trying to get me to and through. I have officially graduated from The Prout School, Wakefield, RI. Yes! I am now officially an Alumnaieaiaeiaia of the Prout School, and a member of the 37th graduating class, the Class of 2005. But, that's all just a bunch of mumbo-jumbo. A bunch of bullshit. Class this, and school that. I am a member of a family, and together, this family and I, have just finally opened the friggin' door those teachers have been talking about showing to us. Yes, all 115 of us managed to squeeze right on through that door. And now, we start off on our owns in the coming fall season. My family, my whole entire world, my reason for living, my support group, my brothers and sisters, my friends, and my home... they've all just started a very short and quick process of leaving....and of saying good-bye. And While I am so utterly and completely  proud, happy, and thrilled with my class and the people in it, the ceaselessly-amazing people of my class, I can't help being sad right now.....

I've heard it said before....That some seniors just might not have awakened to the fact that it really is a ""Ready or Not!"" type of thing....graduation. While it is a wonderful new beginning, and an amazing end to amazing times in your life.....It's heart-wrenching, and ""pull the carpet out from under you"" at the exact same time! Everything that I am today, All of the people I know and care about and know about and worry about....they're going away....off in new directions, off to live with new people, make new friends, have a new set of classmates, whom will be dubbed ""The <School name> Class of 2009"" in most cases. I....I guess that I'm afraid......

Many of my comforts have been the ability to fall back and depend upon Prout, and my classmates, and the activities, and so forth.......and it bothers me now that all of it is changing.....all of it..... The people are going to change, whether we are ready for it or not, the school is changing, both physically and spiritually ready for it or not, the way we live our lives is about to change completely ready for it or not, and now, many of us will be forced completely out of our comfort zones, be forced to meet new people, be forced into living with some complete stranger in most cases, and in new places, with new ideas, teachers, classes, and EVERYTHING.......ready or not.....here it all comes! And I'm not ready for it all....I'm really not! I can't stand the idea of my family leaving me here in Rhode Island, alone and stuck in my parent's house. Yeah, cuz I'm going to a school where they don't have dorms, and so I won't even get a chance to try and change to that. I'm afraid.....So absolutely and completely afraid that now, outside the safety of Prout, I'm gonna fall and fall hard.....I'm afraid that I am once again going to be looked down upon and shunned and disgraced and humiliated by my new classmates...that I will be utterly and completely alone....and that I'll lie solely for those times when I can go visit Prout, or when I get to see someone from my wonderful Highschool years.....and that the rest of my life will just be one living Hell-On-Earth, just like before...... I Don't want to be alone!!!!! I NEED people....without people....I'm nothing...I'm a pathetic waste of matter, and I have no reason to exist.... Not one is anywhere near as accepting as my family has been here at Prout....no one...... And I don't want to lose the people I have grown so close to these past 4 or 5 years....If I do...I know that part of me will just die...and I won't be able to live as I have....happy...

Which brings me down to what it is I have started working on....

I would like to present to those who haven't heard yet, or have but need reminding, or have and don't need reminding and are actually getting very sick of hearing about it, I am putting together an address book for the Prouties of '05, and need help with it. I need e-mail addresses, AIM Screen names, and the person they accompany e-mailed to me @: Trunks02835@mailblocks.com

If you can help me, that'd be awesome. If not, you suck, But I still love you! Remember, this is for class of 2005 members only, Please only send their information. Thanks!!

Now, back to making my list with the s/n I already have. Please help if you can. And to everyone who reads this lj, member of my class or not.....Please, I'm here, talk tome if you need someone to talk to, rant to me if you need to vent, hear me when I call out for help........and know this: I Am STUCK HERE IN RI! MIGHT AS WELL USE THAT! I am pretty much telling anyone who listens that I will be a steady contact point if they need to talk too someone about anything, whether it be local news or events, school problems, whatever, I am your guy to talk to, if you want. And soon hopefully, I'll also be able to help keep you guys all updated on anything needed to be known by everyone, and to help all of you keep up with one another. 

Ok! I'm off now. Remember, Seniors... Graduates....Brothers and Sisters.....Barry's song, <u>Companions on the Journey</u>... 

<i>Would you be my friend,
Walking on this journey? 
Would you be my companion,
Stand by me right or wrong?
On the road to the Promised Land... </i>

Yes...in a Heartbeat.....

Much Love to the Prouties of '05! I'll be talking to all of you soon!"

Yes, I now can once again play xbox games....once i find a non-occupied tv in my fucking house!!!!!

Damn it! I know we're being nice and all, but I want my fucking basement back NOW!!!! I mean, i just had to go from a fucking 60"" widescreen tv, to a 20"" tv!!! ( iknow I sound spoiled and selfish...but damnit!)
I usually have the basement, my brother the guest room, and my parents the living room. Tonight, and probably all of this fucking month, dave is staying with us for his house arrest, and will probably have control of the basement, locking me out, and so i have no where to go for the one stress relief I look forward to every day of the fucking week!!!! (I'm not allowed to play games during the week -_-)

Friday night, out of frustration when my new Jade Empire disc scratched in my xbox, I struck my xbox. And then I struck it again sunday when it stopped working and stopped showing pictures. It then screamed that it demanded service...I struck it again.....

So today, I opened my dear ""Caboose"" as it was so dearly titled, and opened its hard drive, as i thought that it was ok, but upon plugging it into my computer, heard a familiar click of doom....

My hard drive has been systematically scratched, ruinning absolutely everythin on it.....and so...I have lost over 250 hours of gameplay.....which really pisses me off quite a bit!!!!!!

Like most Geminis, you are a playful little creature.
You tend to be extremely curious, craving knowledge but sometimes having a short attention span.
For the most part, you are charming and loveable.
But at times, you can seem scattered and high-strung.

Don't think of it as the end, but rather, think of it as your lasting mark on the school. Either through your smiles, your laughs, your songs and dances, in one way or another, you've inspired someone, somewhere. You've given someone a chance, a dream...You've helped someone to overcome their fears, their saddness....Most of all, you've brought a ray of pure un-adultured happiness to the lives of many. Seniors, there will be other shows, there will be other auditions, other rehearsals, other laughs, other show dates, other audiences, and more applause. So cheer up, and get some rest, for who knows when you're next audition may be, when you move on to have your name emblazoned in lights for all to see, and once again, the world will delight in seeing your smile, and hearing your voice, while you take them away from this world, and en-trance them with the music of the night."

I at least know that I won't be losing it completely. They made me box it, but only the computer, and i heard my fucking male-guardian(father) tell my mom to put it away somewhere.

Also, I think I'm gonna have to start working out again (haven't in over a year and a half >.<). Yah! I know... ""FREAK! Why are you posting this!?""
Truth be told, I don't know why I am saying this... I dunno at all why....

Ok! So Mr Potter called my dad again today. I didn't give him my paper (monday, because it was due friday before vacation, and is now a complete 0) and so I'm afraid when my father talks to Mr. Potter tomorrow, I might end up in trouble! So I gotta get my fucking paper done tonight to pass in to potter tomorrow morning (Might happen.....) >.< Damn I'm a fuck-up! Why didn't I just do the paper when I was sposed to? Oh well! I have just about completely checked out of school anyway.... I dun care what I get for grades anymore, as long as I am passing. I'm going to New England Tech....I have already been accepted and been placed in advanced entry-level math and probably english.....so why do I care if my year average isn't so hot for english? It's cuz i just can't do papers on time anymore..... Ever since last year, I haven't been able to do work ontime anymore, including projects that are worth major grades (Not GOOD!!!!). so yeah...

I might actually update again later on.....

I know....

WTF, Mate? ^^

"event","Today I barely even made it to work because I thought for sure we weren't going to be running since it was so horrible out at 7:45AM. But then i couldn't fall asleep again and at 8:00 I realized it was too bright in my room, which made as much sense as a toaster and purple monkey making turtle wax! So I looked out the window, getting to be pretty out, called work, said we were going out afterall. I rushed through everything and got down to work as soon as possible. All morning all I could think about was last night and if I would ever see Charlotte again. (Even if the following didn't happen, I would find a way to see this girl againbefore I turned 20 3/4!!!) When we were over in newport, we saw the flag up at Rose (we have a flag down system for pickups at Rose Island.) So we got there, and who should come down onto the dock with the overnight guest but Charlotte! ^_^ So we tried saying hi and stuff, but Skip was just like a watchful grandfather, said we had a few minutes, but didn't give us privacy, silly man...
So we talked for a few seconds while looking around, and we spotted her mom up next to the light house, and she was waving her hand pointing from the island to jamestown and back. She let Charlotte come with us for one last ride over to Jamestown and back. We just sat together talking (I was surrounded by people who would never let anything I said or did fall til the day I quit). We got to Jamestown (Picked up more employees =P) and headed back to Rose. While nobody was looking (or so I thought....) We sneaked a quick kiss, our last one bafore she goes back to HOUSTON!!!!!!!! *grrrrrrrr* So she got off, and I had to watch her slowly disappear as we backed away from the dock.

Later on, when the Rose Island boat went out and picked them up, we could see the boat leave on our way to Jamestown. It was phyiscally exhausting for me to know and realize how she was leaving, and how far she was going. She left out og Logan Int. around maybe 2, and will prolly get home around 11. >.<

I'm working on an e-mail for her right now to welcome her home.

Never take what you are given for granted. 
Never give up hope.
Never forget that love is lasting.
Never say never, since we still have forever."

"event","<P>Okay. Charlotte is the most remarkable girl I've ever met. Bright blue eyes, shoulder length dirty-blonde hair, an incredible smile, and she thinks that I am absolutely special (no, I'm not being egotistical, she would not stop telling me how someone like me is very rare. She also kept telling me that I had very beautiful eyes. I kid you not!) <BR><BR>So here's how it went down today:</P>
<P>I worked from 8 this morning 'til bout 4:30. At maybe 10, Charlotte got on from Rose Island with her mom. We thought we had seen the last of each other yesterday. Thankfully, that wasn't the case (I never really got to say good-bye)&nbsp;^_^. So, blah blah blah, we talked on the way to Newport in between my stupid little chores onboard (you know, like selling drinks and tickets and making sure everybody is ok, that kind of crap.) So yeah, we got to Newport, Charlotte got off ( !_! ) And work continued as usual, save the 7 full boatloads of people =P. so, at about 2:20, Charlotte and her mom came back onboard, we sat, held hands, talked. We get to Rose and I invite Charlotte to stay on for the next run and go for the ride, she asked her mom(who had&nbsp;surprised Charlotte a lot these past couple days by letting her go around with me on our date and stuff) and her mom said ""yes."" So Charlotte came out for the ride.I wanted more than anything to not have to keep getting up and tying the lines and stuff. So after a glorious 'nother hour, and being scared by a drunk who we&nbsp;probably&nbsp;should not have&nbsp;let get on the ferry&nbsp;in the first place (he nearly face-faulted into the gunnel trying to get on, he was so drunk), we got to Rose I., and it was time for us to say good-bye. I was really depressed about that. We didn't even really get to say good-bye at all! When we pulled into Jamestown and my now absolute FAVORITE captain came aboard, I jokingly asked him if he would drop me off at Rose and pick me up later on, and he said that he would. But, I didn't really form a plan until I got home. I got home still sad, went upstairs and had an idea. I called the ferry, and asked the captain (John) if he seriously would be willing to take me out to the island if i got permission to go out from charlotte's mom, aunt, and aunt's friend. He said yes. So I called the lighthouse, and they said yes. So I&nbsp;got out there&nbsp;at about 6:15. I got to see the keeper's apartment for the first time. We ate dinner (It was really good{chicken salad type stuff with celery, apples, pickles.....It was damn tasty}) After dinner, Charlotte and I went for a walk around the bunkers. We talked for almost and hour. Yadda yadda yadda.....(For us to know, nothing extreme, but still would rather keep that little while private.) Then, after maybe an hour and a half of talking and hand holding,&nbsp;we kissed each other. I found this next part to be so unbelievable, but I don't see any reason why she'd lie about anything, but she told me right before&nbsp;we kissed that she didn't know&nbsp;how to, because it was her first time.&nbsp;After a while we went over to the beach and sat on the rocks there. We talked some more there. We also just sat and watched some of the boats going by in the dark. I will tell you right now, the Newport bridge at night, from that island, when you are next to someone you care about, is&nbsp;one of THE most beautiful things&nbsp;you will ever see. We just sat there talking and looking out at the&nbsp;water.&nbsp;Then I had to call the ferry to come pick me up when they got a chance. So after that we went up to the lighthouse, and I started to say my good-byes to Charlotte's mom, her aunt, and their friend Kate, but then they asked me if I'd ever been up into the light. I told them yes, but never at night. So Charlotte and I went into the light tower with the light going off every 6 to 8 seconds. It was such an awesome(it's literal definition, as in awe-inspiring =P )&nbsp;sight. Before we went back down, while Charlotte was starting to head down and I was still up top, I bent over and we kissed again. Now I don't care if you guys tease me or any shit like that about what I am about to say next, but I thought that that was one of the most romantic moments of my night out on the island. Okay, so then we went back down to the keeper's apartment, and I said our final good-byes(I'm gonna miss them, not just Charlotte, but her mom, Aunt &nbsp;and kate too, the three of them are awesome. Her aunt is a photographer, so she took a lot of pictures, some of me and Charlotte too, but not tonight. And Kate is a school teacher in LA.) They gave us flashlights, and for some reason, a pair of binoculars (it was too dark to use them....) and we headed down towards the dock, we stopped, said ""our"" good-byes where we knew we couldn't be seen by her ever watchful mother =P. Then the ferry came......&gt;.&lt; And then i had to leave cuz there's not much you can do that you&nbsp;want to when there's a searchlight from a ferry shining on you and putting you in the spotlight.</P>
<P>And that was the&nbsp;end of&nbsp;the most perfect 4 1/2 hours of my life.....</P>"

...Anyway......
There has been this girl who's been staying out at Rose Island for the week with her mom and aunts. She has the most awesomely bright blue eyes I have ever seen. We went out on a date today, went for lunch and just walked around newport for awhile. It was awesome. The worstest thing is that while we seem to connect perfectly, get along very well, and have similiar personallities......She lives in Houston......TEXAS!!!    **DIES SEVERAL TIMES**"

I never really could grasp the fact that one of our beloved and invulnerable class could possibly have been smacked down by something like this...I've never really known Jackie all too well.....And I regret that so much now.....There is one thing I do know about her though, and anybody who sees her knows this: You never see her without a smile on her face. That in itself is something special. DAMNIT!!! I really wish I was 18!!!! I would go get tested for a transplant. Yes, I know you can get a blood test and crap when you're 17 with parental consent, but even if your marrow matches what then!? It's not like, oh! You're 17, but you're a match? Just tell everyone you're 18...."" NO! It's more like ""Ok, so you are a match. now wait 11 monthes until you are legally capable of donating! Have a nice PAIN AND FEAR FILLED 11 Freakin' monthes! I really want to help....in absolutely any way, shape, or form, that I can...even if I can't, I still wanna try.....
On top of all of this, or rather, along with this, or maybe they aren't even related but....TOMORROW IS OUR LAST DAY OF SCHOOL!!!!!!!!!!And I have to end it with chemistry -_-;;

Ihad to get up at 3 in the morning today and work on it til 5:30 and then not finish it in its entirety until the end of F period today, But I did it!(That's the yay!) 2nd, exams start tomorrow.(That's the boo). I have been really stressed out lately because of that fucking paper... Like there has been a constant weight or lungful of bad air constantly filling my chest. I would wake up in the middle of the night, go get a drink, then suddenly be overtaken with such a bonechilling fear as I realized I wouldn't have my paper in by the next day >.<...heehee.....My bird Helios is funny.....Anyway! Tomorrow I have my english and my Math exams. >.< GREAT! My worst two classes all packed nice and cozy into one hellish day!

"event","Yup...I got a new LJ. Why? Do I Need a reason? *sigh* for those of you who do think that I need a reason: I'm getting sick and tired of my old screen name (trunks02835). It came from my old obsession with Dragonball Z, and since I couldn't give a rat's ass about it anymore, I have decided to move as much as I can away from it. This means that I'll probably be getting a new e-mail address again soon (sorry ^.^;;). Anyway. Today wasn't all too bad. Still haven't finished my freakin' english paper, I plan to tonight when I am certain that my dad won't walk in on me and ask what I am working on, and discover that I haven't turned it in yet (I'm supposed to have by last friday according to what I told them...) *smacks himself aside the head with a 2X4* I'm such as freakin moron! Stacey seems to want to get back together with  her old boyfriend. that's kind of a let down. I don't know that she does for a fact, it's just a crazy paranoid hunch of mine. I'm sooooo freakin' screwed.... I have probably failed english this quarter, and math prolly ain't much better... Ok! well, be sure to visit the gift shop for all kinds of cheap, useless stuff! Love goes out ot Meg for a spectacular job on the decor of the new LJ. Comment on anything you want to! ^_^"

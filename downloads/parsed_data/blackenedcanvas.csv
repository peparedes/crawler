Did customer service today, not looking forward to it, selling stuff no problem but certain stuff is gonna be hard, got a lot to learn. Wont know what ship im on till friday but will be going out after that where it is im going! Said about the videography and they seem very interested especially seeing as ive used final cut which is what they use. So hopefully get into that as they are expanding the videography department. Let you know more when i do. Also we have a midterm and a final exam this week!! AH!!!Then 2 weeks of forty hour training for the safety!! I mean so much to learn!! Off for a wee swim and my dunkin donuts, then another early night i think, bloody weather has given me a cold but il get over it, got to buy alka seltzr cold stuff, interesting!

"event","Well here we are .... in the sunny city of miami! After a very long day yesterday, leaving one queue to join another, I have finally had a productive day. We had another medical which was tiresome but we were able to go aboard the Majesty of the Seas which was in port. I mean wow!! everyone must go on a cruise ship at some point it was amazing the amount of stuff on the ship and the top deck! The view was amazing and the heat was just perfect was an amazing experience. The crew deck were well nothing compared to the top 11 floors haha!! They were dark and dingy but didnt get to see the crew rooms, will soon enough i guess. Had a talk about going into videography the guy seemed enthusiastic about it ... going to find out more about that later ... have a few picks on my phone but forgot my wire so cant put it onto a computer! Dumbass!! But the cameras i get a cost price so il buy a wee one though my phone camera is great for just now!! Didnt have a room when i got there but i got it sorted and im sharing with Genna. Theres 14 of us here but not sure where we will all go and if we have a choice il let you know. Had my uniform fitting OH MY GOD!!! the most unflattering clothes that wouldnt look good on a cow!! Oh and guess what i had for lunch yes oh yes!! PASTA AND CHEESE!!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!! Oh and pizza hut for dinner tonight!

Anyhoo will update 2moro, love you all x x x x

"event","I'm in a good place right now. Not only have I taken steps to improve my own life, but I see that things are going exceptionally well for others too, and that makes me happy.

I've taken a lot of missteps in the past. I've made careless mistakes and trampled on people's feelings in the process. I've gone down paths that seemed to be right, only to find that where they led me I did not want to go. I've had plenty of doubts about myself, thought that there was something wrong with me. I've tried to force things that are against my nature just because I thought I was supposed to. Chalk it up to inexperience, immaturity, insecurity, whatever. Bottom line is I've hurt people over the past several years with some regularity. I didn't come out of it all completely unscathed either, nor was I 100% at fault.

The point, though, is that I've learned from it all and have a much clearer knowledge of what's good for me and what isn't. Not that I expect people I've hurt to wallow in sadness forever either, but it's good to find out when someone has moved forward and found happiness too. Yes, I do check up on people I no longer talk to, whenever I can. I don't think it makes me a stalker. It's hard to just completely forget about people who once meant the world. Anyway, to see them happy just reinforces the conclusions I came to long ago...that they were better off without me and vice versa. Cold as that may sound, it's the truth. The truth always comes out one way or another."

"event","A family recently moved into the apartment above mine. They have a baby. Sucks for them. I think I wake the baby up every night when I come home and start playing my guitar. This is the second night in a row I've heard the baby crying upstairs after a few minutes of guitar strumming. It's not like I'm shredding on an electric! I'm just harmlessly playing my acoustic. To be honest, the baby's crying is distracting, which is why I'm updating this right now instead of practicing. This is precisely the reason I don't like playing in front of people. Everyone is a critic! You think you could do better, baby? Well then, be my guest! Your vocals suck! The whiney emo thing is so overdone and <i>so</i> annoying!

I might get christmas eve off. Then again, I might not. Same with new year's eve.

Speaking of Eve, the Chronicles of Narnia was a bit too camouflaged churchy for my taste. I'm not sure I would've felt the same way if I hadn't seen the story CNN did that talked about churches loving it and comparing the lion to Jesus and pointing out that C.S.Lewis was religious. I sat through the movie trying to pick apart each character and find all of the symbolism. I'm not bashing the movie or C.S.Lewis for being religious, I just think I might've enjoyed it more if I hadn't known all of that in advance. I might have rolled my eyes less.

God, that baby is still screaming. I wish it would gtfu already."

"event","I'm sitting here eating my Chick Fil A breakfast. For those of you who didn't know, my local Chick Fil A had a promotion going today. First 50 people to dine in get free Chick Fil A for a year. I eat there on a regular basis, so I had to do it. It opens at 6am, at which time I am normally sound asleep. No matter. For this I would compromise. I got out of bed at 5, after about 2 and a half hours of sleep. I left home at 5:20 and got there at 5:30. Long story short, there were already about 100 people standing outside. I found out that the ""free chick fil a for a year"" was really only 1 free sandwich a week. Yet for some reason I still got in line. I was NOT going to get out of bed at that hour only to go home empty handed. So I stood in line for half an hour in 40 something degree weather. I heard a lady talking about her experiences of the day. She slept on the sidewalk outside of Best Buy to be one of the first people in. Across the street at Circuit City there was a riot which was broken up by police. 

No riots at Chick Fil A, which is a miracle if you ask me. People had been there since before 11pm. Greed is enough fuel to make people turn nasty, but throw hunger into the equation and you have yourself a killing machine. Everyone was nice though, and patient. They had a consolation for those of us who weren't among the first 50: 5 coupons for free chicken sandwiches. Not bad, but they all have to be used by wednesday. 

So now I'm warm and sated...and tired. I'm really not disappointed at all. I got some early morning amusement, a hot breakfast, and I'm about to get into my warm bed. What more could I ask for?"

"event","Ok, here's what I've decided about the TV thing. I enjoy watching sports too much to give that up, so.....I called today to get rid of all the hundreds of extra channels I have. I'm downgrading to plain ol' basic cable. No more HBO or Skinemax. I'll be going tomorrow to turn in the box and remote. So now my TV doesn't have a remote. I'll have to get up every time I want to change the channel, LOL. Oh, and my TV only seems to go up to channel 51. That means I can't get MTV or VH1 or BET, along with a few other channels. I'm absolutely fine with that. I figure this downgrade is going to save me about 20 bucks a month. 

I tried to quit TV cold turkey, but I just don't have the will power. I felt a little too cut off from the world, weird as that might sound. I'm still watching way less than I was before and maintining productivity. This new arrangement works great for me.

"event","I'm conducting an experiment. I'm going to go without watching TV for an indefinite amount of time. Last night at work I really got to thinking about all the time I waste sitting on the couch watching tv. All the time spent flipping channels and watching shows like pimp my ride and next could really be used in more productive ways. I don't know if I'm beginning to think this way because I'm getting older, but lately I'm just not cool with wasting so much time. I don't want the memories of my younger days to be cluttered with mtv 'reality' shows and whatever else manages to distract me from the things I'd really rather be doing.

So I guess I'll give it a month. If I can go a month without watching tv and feel that I'm better off for it, I will call and cancel my cable subscription. The thing that's going to make this toughest is the fact that I'm a big sports fan. Once baseball season starts up again I might start to really miss it. That's 5 months away though.

Alright I gotta go to work. Wish me luck."

"event","Well, I got what I had coming to me. Work, work, and more work. 70 hours last week and another 12 today. Basically all I've done for the past week is work and sleep. I can't remember the last time I was so happy to get a day off. I'm going into full on slacker mode tomorrow. If I were a rapper, I'd be Lay-Z.

As much as I like making extra money, I hope things slow down at work soon. I know I didn't have much of a life before, but I miss what I had. My tv watching, internet surfing, and guitar playing are way way down. Most importantly though, my sleep is way down. There's this crazy guy at work who has been working 14 hours a day, 7 days a week. He's a jerk who no one likes. I don't want to end up like him! He makes all this money, yet wears the same clothes every day. I think he has a gambling problem, lol. I don't know why that made me chuckle.

The weather is cooling down a good bit, finally. It makes me happy because I love autumn and I get to wear this sweater that I like a lot.

I wish I had a reason to dress up for halloween. I miss doing that. It would be pretty pointless, though, to dress up just to sit here in front of the computer. ""Hey guys, I'm a t-rex! rawr! pix?"" We don't even get trick or treaters here at my apartment complex, I don't think. They probably prefer to go to actual houses.

Deaf old guy at work tried to push me into the urinal tonight while I was peeing. Luckily I was able to hold it together and commence with the urination. He was probably trying to get me back for scaring him all the time. He falls asleep in the break room and I walk up and hit him on the shoulder. What a great old jerk.

I'm feeling pretty incoherent. Yeah, I'm done here."

They've been giving other people a lot of extra hours and me....not so much. Now, it's already against my natural tendencies to work the extra hours, so actually having to fight to be able to do it is really a stretch. I've been talking to my union rep about it though and hopefully we can get it all worked out and those fux will stop overlooking me.

*sigh* The things a guy has to do to try and get ahead in this crazy world!

Yeesh, I just ate all of my tater tots without even realizing it.

The Red Sox sucked this year, got pwnt in the first round of the playoffs, and are now out of it. On the bright side though, I'm way more relaxed than I was last year during the playoffs. The Yankees lost too, so I can happily sit back and watch the remaining 4 teams beat each others brains out without caring who wins.

Yep, that's about all that's on my mind right now. I'm so simple."

Where should I begin? Well, Weezer and Foo Fighters rocked hard! SO HARD! I enjoyed the show despite all of the drunk assholes around me. I swear, some people just don't know how to act in public. It's a real shame.

I've decided to start working more hours for at least the next 3 months. I figure I don't do a lot here at home besides sit on my ass so I might as well be productive at work and make a little extra money. I like money. I want to get my car paid off and save up a good amount.

My life seems really problem free and simple right now. I'm not worried about anything. I feel like I have a pretty decent plan that I'm following. I'm organized. It's not a feeling that I'm used to. Nothing can stop me! Not even dumb teenage boys and their footballs.

I guess I haven't been getting online as much as I used to. I just get bored pretty quickly and start feeling like I'm wasting time. I realize that sitting on the couch watching tv is also a waste of time, but it's slightly less boring. See, this is why I need to work more. It also feels like everyone else is doing their own thing and coming around less too. You guys have school and junk. A lot of the time I get online and no one is around. The internet is so boring....but I frickin' <i>need</i> it.

I've run out of things to say."

-So, in other news, I'm going to see Weezer and Foo Fighters in Dallas in September. I already bought a ticket from ticketmaster, but the seat isn't that great. Since this is going to be such a HUGE deal for me, I've been looking at ebay to see if I can get anything better. Just like always, ebay is there for me when I need it. I'm currently watching 10 auctions for PIT tickets. It came as a surprise to me because I've been to that venue about 5-6 times and didn't know it had a pit. I guess that's because I'm always way the hell back from the stage. Anyway, I'm probably going to have to buy 2 tickets, so I'll have an extra one. If any of you jerks wants to go with me, let me know we'll hook it up. I won't even charge you for the dang ticket. That's right, free. You can't beat free. We're talking WEEZER AND FOO FIGHTERS, people! PIT!

-I've only worked twice since returning but I'm already sick of it. I guess I'm just going through one of those ""I hate work"" phases. Saturday I was there just thinking how satisfying it would be to just quit right on the spot and walk out. But of course that would make no sense at all. If I actually were to quit I would burn up all of my sick leave and vacation time first, then quit. But still, in my mind it was more fun to go up and just spontaneously say ""I quit"" and walk the hell up outta there. 

Don't worry, folks. I'm not really going to quit my job, I only want to.

-Today I went to the website to renew my driver's license, but I found out that you have to get some invitation in the mail to do that. I guess I'm not 1337 enough to avoid long lines at the dumb dmv. This is a discouraging development.

-A year ago today I got freedom. I still appreciate it just as much now as I did then.

-It's nice to have new things to make me smile lately.

-Hi, you.

Yeah, I'm about done here.

Anyway, I'm already bored with home again. It was nice to be back for a little while, but now I'm ready to take off again. Worst part is I haven't even been back to work yet. Tonight will be my first night back. If only you were here to see the pure excitement on my face. I'm pretty sure I'll get asked a lot of questions about what I did on my trip and how I got certain things. I'm not sure how open I'll be with my nosy co-workers. I guess it depends on my mood once I get there.

"event","Hi, well I'm back. I was never really gone, just too lazy to update. I haven't been up to much really. The only thing you'd find surprising is how little I actually have done. Work and come home, occasionally take in a movie. I really would update this thing more if I had anything worth sharing. 

I guess I could talk about the mischievous thing I did at work last night. A couple of you have already heard this story, so you can just skip over it. 

Last night I was working by myself. Next to the machine where I was working is a large area where the mail carriers come in and sort their mail in the morning before they hit the streets. I just happened to notice a note taped to one of the mail sorting cases. It read as follows:

DO NOT TOUCH MY TRAYS!
GO FIND YOUR OWN

So I looked under the case and sure enough there were a few stacks of letter trays. Of course after reading that rude note I just <i>had</i> to take the trays. They don't belong to that jerk, they belong to the post office. So I took 'em and moved them far away so the carrier would have to walk a long way to get some more. Then I took their little note and wrote my own message on it. It read as follows:

They're not yours.
Yeah I took them.
I win.

Doing this gave me some satisfaction and amusement on an otherwise boring night. The lesson learned here is not to write rude bossy notes if you're not around to enforce them. 

In other news, in a little over a week I'll be taking a trip. I'm driving to Georgia where I will pick up Michele, then we'll drive up to NY to visit Amma and possibly up to Toronto to see Steph. It'll only be for a week, unfortunately, but should still be lots of fun. It'll be way cooler than that movie Crossroads starring Britney Spears which I have never seen. I don't need to see it to know that our trip will be cooler.

That's about all I have to talk about for now. Sorry I didn't do a LJ Cut but I forgot how."

One night last week I was at work and felt a very quick, very intense pain in that nagging area. Since then the pain has not come back. I guess maybe something was out of place and it suddenly snapped back in? I don't know, I'm no doctor. I'm just glad the pain is gone.

Today I bought some Dr. Scholl's Massaging Gel Insoles for my shoes. Hopefully that will take care of the foot pain and I'll be totally pain free. I'll be so comfortable in my shoes that nothing will ever bother me, just like on the commercials. All of life's problems will be solved by the insoles.

3.Radiohead-OK Computer might be my all time favorite album. I just think it's so brilliant and I'll always love it despite the fact that it reminds me of unhappy times.
4.Incubus-Make Yourself which has been mentioned a couple of times in other journals. It's just such a damn good CD and it really motivated me to uh...tell people to fuck off I guess.
5.Ash-Free All Angels is just...pop/rock goodness at its best. 'nuff said

So I went back to work this week. It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be because I felt pretty rested physically and mentally. Well it took all of one day for this pain in my right leg to come back. I've had this pain in my right hip/groin area for about the last 6 months. It only hurts when I walk, so it causes a slight limp. It bothers me the most when I've been sitting down and I first get up and walk around. I think it started a few years back while I was running every day. I thought it was just a minor thing that would work itself out if I just kept exercising. It didn't go away until I stopped running completely, and now it's back. I thought maybe 2 weeks off work and off my feet would help. It didn't bother me at all while I was on vacation. By the end of the first day back to work it had returned. Dangit, I hope this isn't something I have to deal with for my whole life. It's not like I can just switch to another job where I'm not on my feet all day.

Other than that work has been fine. People told me it's good to have me back and stuff, which is nice."

Sometimes I start thinking about how I'm only existing and consuming and not contributing anything of much value to the world. It doesn't really bother me that much though, because like I said, I've been really complacent. I probably need to get out more. I've really become a shut-in lately.

There is one thing I've been thinking about a lot lately....

I'm not sure how to phrase it.

OK here's the deal. I'm single. I generally like being single because I like the freedom. I don't have to worry about pleasing anyone but myself. I don't have to compromise what I want or how I feel or anything like that for anyone. Period. And...I don't have to deal with certain insecurities that I have.

But at the same time....

Sometimes I really want that feeling of companionship. I like having someone I can do stuff with. I like having someone I can confide in about anything. I enjoy connecting with someone on that level. I miss the physical aspects of it, which I will refrain from talking about in detail. And like Ro said in one of her entries, I also miss being liked in that way. It's a really cool feeling. I also think that there's a limit to how much you can grow as a person when you spend most of your free time alone. 

I've never been in a normal relationship before. Both of mine have been long distance, which absolutely sucks. Maybe one day I'll get the chance to give a normal one a try. 

In conclusion, I think that I'm spending WAY too much time sitting around this apartment. Otherwise I wouldn't be thinking about this shit. I need something else to focus on. I really ought to stop wasting my brain.

I'm going to get out of this aparment tomorrow even if it kills me. Although I really hope it doesn't."

"event","So I went to see Ash last night. I absolutely loved it. The atmosphere was great, the venue was great, the band was great. It really exceeded my expectations.

I had a little trouble finding the place. Partly because of dumb mapquest and partly because it's so small. It's probably the smallest place I've ever seen a show. When I finally got there, I pulled in to park and I noticed Tim Wheeler (lead singer, for those who aren't familiar with the band) standing around outside, talking to a few people. I don't think they were fans, but people who either worked for the venue or worked for the band. Anyway, when I saw him I got nervous and excited, because I worship the guy. I paid the parking attendant and just sat in my car for a minute, looking and thinking about what I should say/do. I got out and walked over. He was still talking to the people so I just kind of hung around nearby until he was finished. Then I walked up and said, ""I'm sorry to bother you, but can I shake your hand? I'm a huge fan."" Then he shook my hand, said thanks, and asked if I was coming to the show. I said yes, then walked on. He seemed busy, so I didn't think I should try to have any drawn out conversation with him. Plus I was nervous and probably would've made a fool of myself. 

I waited around almost 2 hours outside before they started letting people in. There were only a few people in front of me in the line, so I was able to get right up next to the stage. Like I said, the place was small, but there were only a couple hundred people there, so it wasn't very crowded. The people were friendly and I actually talked to a few of them. No one got rowdy, no jerks. Just a great atmosphere. 

Two bands played before Ash. The first was The Crimea. They weren't bad, but not that good either. The lead singer was annoying. The second band was The Bravery. They were actually pretty good. Better than the first band, they just dress like a bunch of flamers. I might buy their cd when it comes out. I was so pumped when Ash came out. I was singing along and jumping up and down, which isn't something I normally do. I was just having so much fun and letting loose. How could I not get excited when one of my favorite bands is standing 3 feet away from me? They played 15 songs, alternating old and new. The last song was a cover of The Boys Are Back In Town. Pretty cool. 

There are more details I could talk about, but I don't like making really long entries. I bought an Ash t-shirt after it was over and went home. I was so tired when I got home, my bed has never felt so good. The perfect ending to a great day! *thumbs up*"

"event","-A quick update on the shoe saga:

I went back to check ebay again saturday and found not one, but two great pairs of shoes, which I bought. In a related matter, I'm seriously thinking about making ebay my wife.

-I went to best buy on sunday to buy the new mars volta cd, but they didn't have it. In fact, they didn't have the old one either. What the heck, best buy? You're usually better than that. This means that I'll have to go to *shudders* the mall.

-I found out that I can phone in orders to IHOP and just go pick them up. This is great because it's only across the street and I have a tendency to get cravings for pancakes at 1 in the morning.

-When I went in to pick up my food, there were 2 guys also waiting for food. When I walked in they started laughing a lot. I got the feeling that they were laughing at me. I really didn't care though, I just wanted to get my food and gtfo. 

-I just remembered that I left a cup of water in the freezer.

-The water is frozen solid.

-I'm licking the ice.

-I had a fun time in the chat saturday night. So many good laughs. I swear I have the funniest friends. I <4 you guys.

-I still don't know what to do for my vacation.

I'm going to make it short this time. I've been looking for the longest time for a pair of shoes that I want because I'm very picky when it comes to shoes. I've looked at tons of stores and all over the internet. Recently I found a pair of shoes that I liked very very much and the site had my size in stock, so I bought a pair. Well, yesterday I got an email saying that my money had been refunded because the shoes were sold out. Pissed me off because they're so damn hard to find. 

*bitch bitch moan moan*

At this rate I'll be wearing the same shoes for <i>another</i> 8 years.

"event","Okay, so yesterday I went out and spent a small fortune on new sheets and a comforter for my queen sized bed. I haven't slept on it in over a year because my cats used to get on it/sleep on it and they got the sheets and pillow cases unbelievably hairy. I refuse to sleep in hair, so I've been sleeping on the twin bed in the extra bedroom all this time. So since the cats are no longer here, I decided to splurge and get new sheets so that I can sleep in the big comfy bed that I spent a lot of money on. I like reading in that bed. I'm also a big fan of sleep. I do it a lot and I'm good at it. It all makes perfect sense, right?

Well, it's 8am and I'm here updating my livejournal. I slept all of 4 hours before my eyes popped open. It wasn't good sleep either. I tossed and turned a lot. I got up to get a drink of water, watched a little TV, then got back in bed. No dice. Could not get back to sleep. I'm wide awake now and it'll be nice having all of this extra time today, but I know I'll be paying for it by the end of the day. 

I'm going to chalk this up to being in an unfamiliar bed. Even the pillows are different....bigger. It's a comfy bed! It really is! I also haven't done much for the past 3 days, so maybe I need to do a better job of tiring myself out. That seems logical, right? Everything is going to be okay, right!?

"event","Good ol' trusty livejournal. I've forsaken you for over a month and you're still here for me when I need you. Never change, my friend.

Yeah, I'm finally updating again. This is my first one of 2005 (can't even call it the new year anymore) and I still don't have anything interesting to talk about. I guess I'll have to bullshit my way through it. Bear with me.

I honestly haven't done anything for the past few months but work and sit at home (you probably wouldn't have known it because I haven't been online as much). I don't see much change in that routine anytime soon either. You would think that that would get me down, but it really hasn't. Sure, I've had my down days when I feel sick of the same old thing. Then there are the rare times when I feel useless. But overall, I've been in pretty good spirits. I've really made a point of being more responsible and getting my life more in order. I think that's what's kept my outlook positive. I just don't have any problems to speak of. I feel like if I do my best to do things the right way and have a decent plan, then things will work out in my favor in the long run. These mundane days are just something I have to put up with for a while. 

I have a couple of vacations scheduled for later this year. 2 weeks at the end of April/beginning of May, and a week in July. For the first time in a long time, I don't know what I'm going to do for my vacations. I've always had someone to visit or something I really wanted to do. I was thinking of driving to California again in April to attend Coachella, but I haven't made up my mind. A couple of reasons not to go. 

1. I just drove to California last summmer. It kind of sucks to make that long drive alone. Actually, it kind of sucks to go on vacation alone, period. 

2. I'm trying to be financially responsible, and that vacation would not be cheap. I'm still paying for trips I took last year.

A couple of reasons to go.

1. Duh, it's Coachella

2. By April, I'll be dying to get away from Shreveport.

So I don't know what to do. I also have that 400 something dollar credit with Delta that expires in July. Only problem is it's only good for international flights. I just don't know what I would possibly use that on. Looks like it's going to go to waste.

So, I have about 2 and a half months to decide what to do with my vacation time. If nothing comes up, then I'll just cancel it or cut it down to a few days, which will be used to rest. 

That's about all I'll say for this entry. I might start updating more again because I sort of feel like babbling about more stuff, but don't want to shoot my load all at once. 

Take it easy!"

1. Green Day-American Idiot
2. Ash-Meltdown
3. The Vines-Winning Days
4. Franz Ferdinand-Self Titled
5. Snow Patrol-Final Straw

Green Day was easily number one for me. I think it's their best album since Dookie. Really a pleasant surprise. 

I loved the new Ash too. I don't think they can ever disappoint me. Just straight forward good ol' pop/rock that I love. No thinking required. 

There was a pretty significant drop off after number two. Not because the last 3 aren't great, but because I just loved the top two so much. Can't wait to hear what 2005 has to offer.

I think I might make some more top 5 lists later when I have more time."

"event","I don't understand people sometimes. They front too much, na mean? lol

Seriously though, there's this lady at work who bitched at me all dramatically one night because I wasn't being talkative enough. I told most of you the story already. Anyway, she said I was stuck up and held a grudge about it for months. Really the only beef I had with her before that was her being lazy on the job. But after that episode and the ensuing dirty looks and attempts to piss me off, I really wanted nothing to do with her. I'd never seen an adult act like such a child in my entire life. I did my best just to avoid her and have nothing to do with her. Then last night we got stuck working together. It made me uncomfortable right away but hey, that's life. Then she started talking to me as if we're friends or something, which made me even more uncomfortable. All I wanted to do was get through the night peacefully, with as little contact with her as possible. But she insisted on having conversation. What makes it worse is that she's deaf and very hard to understand. I have nothing against deaf people, but I really cannot understand what they're saying sometimes, and that makes me feel even more uncomfortable. 

The point to all of this is, I KNOW she didn't wake up yesterday with a new found love for me. I certainly don't enjoy her company. Why did she all of a sudden decide to be all friendly? It was obviously all an act, I just don't know what the motivation was. We'll never be friends, we don't need to be friends to do our job. It seems that with her, you're either going to get some cheery nut or a bitch sent from the depths of hell. People like that drive me crazy. How about a little balance, eh?"

I used to believe in fate. Now? Well, it doesn't really fit in too well with the way I think. But sometimes things happen that make me at least contemplate it. I had that dream thursday night which left such an impression on me that it stayed with me all day and compelled me to follow up on it after work on friday. Then I found it. A little glimmer of hope. It had been there for months and I knew nothing about it. So yes, last night I stumbled upon it and it was perfect. It was exactly what I needed. It was perfect in ways that I cannot even explain. 

So now I'm wondering what to do with this new thing that I've found; this new opportunity. Right now I'm just biding my time. Maybe things will continue to unfold on their own. Maybe fate put me in this position and now it's up to me to do something with it. Maybe everything I've ever been through was for this very reason. 

Then again, maybe it all means nothing......

It's that last maybe that has me on guard. Cautiously optimistic.

I'll drown my beliefs
To have you be in peace
I'll dress like your niece 
To wash your swollen feet

Don't leave

<b>I'm not living
I'm just killing time</b>
Your tiny hands
Your crazy kitten smile

Just don't leave
Don't leave

<b>And true love waits
In haunted attics
And true love lives
On lollipops and crisps</b>

The end of the year is approaching. It feels like 2004 has gone by so fast, but at the same time, the beginning of the year seems a world away. I'm a different person. Better or worse? I could probably argue either side. I'm calloused now. I think more with my brain and less with my heart. There aren't that many things that evoke any strong emotion from me anymore. The Red Sox winning got the strongest reaction out of me that I can remember in quite a while. I'm not sure if this is just a natural part of the growing up process or a product of other circumstances. Maybe a little of each. 

I don't think it ought to be a natural thing. Aren't our emotions part of what makes us human? Which is worse, being overly emotional and irrational or being logical and numb? Perhaps being too sensitive in modern society eventually leads to numbness. I think that's the route that I've taken. Yes, I'm sure of it. I'd like to think that it's not a one way trip. There must be a way back. A perfect balance of the two extremes. I'd settle for anywhere in between. I don't know; this all seems silly to me, but it's how I feel.

"event","Yeah it was a dumb day. I didn't do stuff that I should've done. The Red Sox lost. I got off work late. I was pretty cranky. My legs were really sore by the time I left work. 

Something really stupid happened before work. I needed to fill up my car so I stopped by the gas station. I normally just pay at the pump with my credit card but this time I wanted to use cash. So I removed the nozzle and stood there waiting to begin fueling. The screen said ""waiting for cashier to authorize"". Strange. I waited and waited, kept glancing over to try and see what was taking so long. Finally I got frustrated and went inside to ask the cashier to turn on the friggin pump. I was polite. I said, ""will you turn on pump 2 please?"" She then asked me if I was at pump 2. What a dumb question. No, you dumb ho, I'm parked at pump 5, I just want to play games and waste time. I didn't say that, but that's what I thought. So then I walked back out to my car, filled up, then went back inside to pay. She asked me if I wanted to donate a dollar of my change to St. Jude. I said no. Then some old guy who happened to be nearby said he wanted to donate a dollar. He walked over and tossed a buck on the counter and looked at me. I just kept looking straight ahead, waiting for my change. That old guy annoyed me. It was as if he was trying to either make me feel bad for not donating or make himself look good for giving a whole dollar. I just wanted to get my change and get the hell out of there. I had to go to work. The cashier started asking him if he wanted to put his name on some stupid list that said he donated. What the hell? Why do people always need some sort of recognition for doing something nice? It was just a measly dollar, gimme a break. Anyway, finally she got around to giving me my change and I left. I wanted to peel out, but I didn't. I should point out that I'm usually a little cranky on my way to work and stay that way until I've been there for about 30-45 minutes. 

During my first break at work I noticed that I had a couple of missed calls, so I checked my voicemail. Robin and Ro were eating at wendy's so I guess they thought it would be funny to crank call me. j/k They weren't crank calls, just strange and funny. After listening to the first message I was kind of confused. Then I listened to the second one and I finally understood. Then I listened to the first one again and laffed. I didn't call back because I didn't have time. We still need to have that 3 way conversation some Sunday.

Yesterday was a good day. First, the Red Sox won their playoff game. Second, I found out I don't have to work my day off for Columbus Day next week. It seemed like more good things happened, but I guess it was just those two. It was a good day nonetheless.

Alright, no more goofing around. Gotta go."

"event","I was woken up today by a weed whacker or a weed eater or whatever you like to call them. I was cursing the yard workers when I opened my eyes and saw that it was already 11:45. Then the noise stopped, so I decided I would sleep another 15 minutes. After all, who gets up at 11:45? Getting up at an even 12:00 makes way more sense. At least, that's what I told myself in my drowsy state. 

What felt like 20 seconds later, the phone rang. I glanced at the clock again and it said 12:00. Perfect. I checked the caller ID and it said Lafayette, LA and then the phone number. I assumed it was my sister since she lives in Lafayette. So I answer, and it's a female voice, so I say ""hey"". But it's not my sister, it's some woman asking me if I'll vote for some guy on election day. To be honest, I didn't even understand the name that she said. She could've been asking me to vote for Osama Bin Laden for all I knew. So she's like, ""can he count on your vote?"" and I said, ""yeah, sure"". Then she thanked me and I said bye and hung up. 

So I got up and took a shower and drove to the bank because I need cash for the weekend. I have about 47 parties to go to and I want to make sure I have lots of cash for....well, for party stuff. You know how it is. So I was waiting in line to get my money and some guy walks in and goes directly up to the teller and asks her to give some envelope to someone, blah blah. Then as he's walking out, he says, ""have a nice weekend"". I don't know who he was talking to, maybe everyone, but no one said anything back. Then when he was out the door this lady behind me in line said, ""you too"" really quietly. I bet I'm the only one who heard it. I thought that was kind of stupid, so I chuckled to myself. 

On the way home from the bank I decided that I wanted a Flame Thrower Burger from Dairy Queen. They're pretty darn good. It'd been a while since I'd had one and I was sort of craving it. The last time I ate one I was throwing flames from my ass....at work. After that I vowed that I wouldn't eat them anymore. But hey, that was a few months ago, I thought it was time that I gave it another shot. 

That's my day up to now. I'm done with lunch and just killing time before work."

"event","Yes, it is my 1 year livejournal anniversary. What a year it has been. 

One year ago today Ro gave me a lj key (thanks, Ro) and convinced me to use it. I mostly agreed because people were making entries friends only and I didn't want to be left out. I really didn't think I'd use it much. But now I love lj. If something significant happens in my life, I think, ""Yes, this will make a good lj entry"". It's a great way to document important events or to just vent. I also like how I can share my thoughts with people, stuff that probably wouldn't come up in conversation. However, I think my FAVORITE thing about lj is that it's free.

I thought about doing a 'year in review' sort of thing with highlights from my lj, but I think that would be a bit over the top. Plus I don't really have time to do it."

It failed.

I went on and on about the largeness of it. I did the preview and everything was in order. Then I updated and went to my journal and it was normal font size! I felt like such a fool so I deleted it.

There is one part from the big entry that I want to put here. 

""I hung my new painting today. It gives this room some much needed character. Plus it is a constant reminder that I have something Carlos wants.""

"event","Right now I am looking at 2 tickets to Green Day. They just arrived via fedex. God, I've wanted to see this band for 10 years now. It'll finally happen on saturday. 

I just have one thing to say about the trip....

Hurrican Ivan, if you somehow screw things up and ground or delay my flights, you will face the wrath of Hurricane Rob. I will kick your ass.

Okay, maybe I'm paranoid, but I always worry that when I want something really badly, forces of nature usually conspire to somehow fuck it up. K.

---------------------

Went back to work last night. My lifeless co-workers didn't ask as many questions about my trip as I thought they would. That was a nice surprise. I'm out of work shape right now though. Half way through, my legs got tired/sore and I really wanted to sit down. Hopefully tonight will be easier. 

---------------------

My left eye started hurting a little last night. I woke up today and it was still feeling the same. I hope I'm not getting pink eye or something. I have no idea what the symptoms of pink eye are, other than...a pink eye.

---------------------

I was trying to trim my hair around the neck today, but I think I messed up on one side. Damn only being able to see through one eye. I just hope it's not too noticeable. Maybe I should stop trying to cut my own hair and go to a barber. Something to consider."

"event","I got back home from my ""california adventure"" last night around 8pm. It was a good trip. The drive got pretty boring, but it wasn't as bad as I thought it'd be. Plus I had no car trouble and no speeding tickets, always welcomed on a long drive. 

I'm not really in the mood to go into a lot of detail about the trip right now. For now I'll just say that it was good for me to get away. It was a good experience and something that I've wanted to do for a long time. It also made me realize how much I enjoy the comfort of home. As boring as it may be sometimes, I'm pretty happy with my life. I really don't have many worries at the moment. It's a nice feeling that I haven't had very often in the last 10 years or so. It's not like optimism, I've felt that plenty of times. It's more a feeling that nothing is wrong. I'm doing just fine and can handle more than I thought I could before. Stability. That's the word for it. 

So I made that long trip alone. I think it's kind of cool that I can do something like that. I had lots of time to just sit and think. No self discovery. No epiphanies. To be honest, what I thought about while driving is all a blur to me now. I just kind of thought about life in general. Songs brought back memories, some good and some bad. Maybe I worked some things out, I'm not even sure. My subconscious took over throughout most of the 4,500 miles. 

Right now my hunger is preventing me from focusing on this entry. I think I'll go take care of that now. 

There's no place like home."

My sister called a little while ago to wish me a happy birthday and we talked for a little while. It was nice. She and I have never been all that close, but I do miss her sometimes. We have good laughs when she's not being bossy...lol

Then later my mom and grandpa called to tell me happy birthday too. My mom asked if it was okay for her to leave a birthday surprise at my apartment while I'm at work. I said of course. I hope it's caek!

I changed my lj picture to a much happier one. It makes me smile. Peanuts is probably my all time favorite comic. 

That's about all I've got. I'll leave for work in about half an hour and my birthday will pretty much be over lol. If anything else happens I'll be sure and update.

Thanks again guys. <3"

-I'll be turning 25 in like 12 days. I'm not sure yet how I feel about this. My 20's are half over. 

-I just zoned out for a good 2 minutes, contemplating my age. 

-I think I'm going to drive to california for my 2 week vacation. That should be an experience. The longest drive I've made has been like 5 hours. I think it's about a 30 hour drive to cali. I could fly, but where's the fun in that? My mom and grandparents will probably soil themselves when I tell them. They worry about me and stuff. 

-Since I'm going to be making such a long drive, I'm going to have to break down and buy a cell phone.

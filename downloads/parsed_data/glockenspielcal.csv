"event","Merry Christmas, everyone!  It's crazy that it's already Christmas, considering my schedule the past few days.  Anyway, here's my annual Christmas wish list, which has been extended by one this year:
-Peace
-Love
-Nuclear Disarmament
-Friendship

Of course, happiness is implied in all of this.

Anyhow, I leave for Berkeley in a few hours.  A rough schedule of things to come is as follows:

3:30am - Call time at BRH.
3:45am - Leave for SFO
6:00am - Flight to Phoenix
9am (Mountain Time) - Arrive in Phoenix
10am - Arrive at hotel, dress, eat
11am - Practice at Tempe High School, lunch, etc
3pm - Tailgate performance, head to stadium, marchup, etc.  Probably not in that order
6pm (That's 5pm PACIFIC TIME) - Insight Bowl: Cal vs. VA Tech.  Televised on ESPN
11pm - Back to hotel.  Chill, sleep, etc.
4am - Wake up!!!  Go to airport, fly to SFO
9am (Pacific Time) - Back to Berkeley.  Hup sleep.

Go Bears!  Beat the Hokies!

Merry Christmas!"

"event","After walking to Memorial Stadium I found out that we were starting the day off with music rehearsal in BRH.  Lots of walking with glockenspiel = shoulder pain.  Anyhow, practice today went pretty well.  I was able to learn halftime to the point that it's performable, but there's always improvement that could be made, such as better memorizing ""In The Stone"".  It's something I should have memorized last year, in addition to half the songs in the packet.  Oh well.

TH has emptied out considerably since practice ended.  In less than an hour, it'll be my turn to go home.  Then madness ensues on Friday at 3:30am.  When I say madness, I mean that things will be happening back to back, from the airplane trip to practice to the game to the hotel to the airplane trip back.  I didn't bother mentioning meals.  Thinking about it, I don't know how I'll be able to sleep during that period of time.  I guess it'll be fun with friends and band until I really have to go home for three weeks.  Go Bears."

"event","Yay for TAs on crack.  And when I say crack, I mean sugar.  

Today, I fell out of the block to help teach the halftime show.  It was the most fun I had as a TA this year.  If I somehow make MAC next year, I'm definitely going to miss the job.

The only problem with falling out of the block is that I still don't know my continuity for halftime.  Perhaps I'll learn it between now and 9 hours from now.  Go Bears."

"event","I was somewhat apprehensive going into this rehearsal, but it generally turned out well.  I learned my pregame spot in its entirety, which is unlike Saturday morning rehearsals, where I'm still attempting to perfect my spot.  A few things:
-My playing was rather mediocre today, and I didn't practice at all tonight.  Perhaps I'll try again in the morning.
-I broke another mallet during one of our pregame runthroughs.  I believe it was during ""Sons"".  Hopefully there's a spare in the glockenspiel locker or else I will have to purchase mallets or use my nice clear ones :).
-Feeling pretty sickly after one the the runthroughs, I got to sit out towards the end of rehearsal.  Here, I had a chance to watch the band from the bleachers.  It was quite nice.

The rest of today was spent doing close to nothing.  I mean, I didn't even bother practicing my instrument!  As for tomorrow, I have practice from 11-3p, followed by sectional, followed by Christmas shopping, followed by maybe strip club bonding with percussion.  I'm not sure if I'm going yet because that would result in a loss of purity points."

"event","As some of you already know, I have had bronchitis for about a week.  This has resulted in me not having slept well in a week (in addition to finals) because I would wake up coughing at night.  So yeah, if I have been a bit ""off"" lately, that's why.  If anyone sees me doing something like dumping juice in the garbage can instead of the sink and food in the sink instead of the garbage can, please kindly stop me.  I would appreciate it.

Fortunately, I go home in about an hour, so I can wreck havoc in my house instead of TH."

"event","Either that, or my finals are over, therefore freeing up immense amounts of time which can be consumed in acts that constitute having no life.

Anyhow, why did I create this livejournal?  Well, initially I was going to create one as a joke.  My username was going to be GlockenspielPeace0607.  Let me explain:

Glockenspiel:  The instrument I play in the University of California Marching Band.  Go Bears!
Peace:  For those who know me, this is self-explanatory.  For those who don't know me, it will become self-explanatory eventually.
0607:  One of the years I will graduate from this crazy university.  Go Bears!

Unfortunately, there were too many characters in that handle, so I had to shorten it to GlockenspielCal, which is in fact related to the satiric http://GlockenspielCAL.blogspot.com.  Go there if you wish to read about the fictitious adventures of Kim, Liz, and I while living in the same apartment building (Glockenspiel Pride!).  So yeah, I'm not sure how much of a joke this site will be.  I might use to to write indepth about my Cal Band experiences or as a means or keeping in touch with my old high school company, most of which uses livejournal.  OR, I could just use this journal as a means of being silly and sarcastic, because I'm a silly and sarcastic person (well, I try.  No, I don't).  If you guys really want to read my real journal, which occasionally has some semi-insightful thoughts, visit my deadjournal.  Ask me and I just might give you the link.  Or you can search for it.  I'm sure it's not hard to find.

So now that the basic introductions are over, I will proceed with the rest of the entry:

Finals ended for me today, meaning that I don't have to deal with class for a whole month.  For now, my focuses will shift to band.  Rehearsals for the Insight Bowl start this Sunday, and on the 26th we fly down to Phoenix for the game.  Hopefully we'll win, because that will mean more money for the school.  Anyhow, we fly back on the 27th and then the absolute vegetation until 2nd semester begins.  I could always practice my glockenspiel, as I have not been to a SHB since the Axe Rally after Big Game and will probably be rusty.  Better yet, I should start practicing really soon for the bowl game.

Tonight was De Anza's Holiday concert.  I should really visit that school, though most of my friends are gone.  Better yet, Nick and I should organize a SHB and play at De Anza, so everyone can see the ever wonderful school that we came from.  Go Bears!"

"event","Man, I just wish this would get over with. I'm tired of sitting around waiting being anxious and nervous and getting a stomach ache with everything i eat. i'm in boca at the grandparents and i have no clue whats happening with the house. i just want the storm to pass and to go back to my home. frances stop being stationary do your business and let us get along with our lives. i hate the waitig game, i'm very bad at it and i already know i lost. even my dog knows somethings up. oh and ivan wtf don't mess with us stay out of our way. why do the hurricanes have to come one after another? at least i wont have to put up shutters again we can just live in the dark not knowing the time of day again for another week. wow life in florida is just dandy, but thats what you get for living here. so i just have to suck it up. hope everybody stays safe and the hurricane is over and done with as soon as possible. 

stay safe i love you all <3"

Well, I put up hurricane shutters. I quit once my grandpa came though but i was still doing it for a good hour or two. It sucks. I hate this damn hurricane. And I think my development is going to get evacuated. I may not show it but I'm really scared. I don't want my house to be ruined or to loose anybody around me. Man, this sucks. Everybody stay safe this weekend, and everybody please say prayers that everything will be okay. I love you all<3

From:http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/video_speeding_conn_cop_in_killer_46VZsd1vq4waops50GDfYO

Chilling video released yesterday in Connecticut shows the final moments before a speeding cop car plowed into another car in June, killing both teens inside.

Milford, Conn., police Officer Jason Anderson was going 94 mph and may have been racing another officer on the Boston Post Road June 13 when he struck a car carrying David Servin and Ashlie Krakowski, both 19, the New Haven Register reported.

The video, obtained by the newspaper through a Freedom of Informaton Act, shows Anderson fly by another cruiser as both cars were returning to headquarters from another call before slamming into the other car.

Anderson is charged with two counts of second-degree manslaughter and reckless operation, and has been suspended without pay.

There have been allegations that Anderson was racing the other cop car at the time of the accident. The other officer has not been charged.

The force of the crash was so great that Krakowski's body was thrown 30 feet, the Register reported.

An attorney for the victims' families told the paper that Anderson was going so fast the teens ""had no chance."""

He asked me if it was pot or hash. They don't understand I try just as hard in school, maybe harder. They don't understand that its better than doing anyother drug. They don't relize its one of the only things that relives stress in my life. I can't talk to my parents about anything. I hate growing up. I don't get whats going on in my head as a teenager.

I will form one then look at it from someone elses point of view and not be sure if I still feel the same. I want to go skate with people. Its the only thing besides drums that have followed me through my teenage years. I always have in intrest in skating, there is always something new I could do or going on.

Buy a Mac. Get a free iPod mini. And with your everyday student discount save up to $479.* But act now. This offer is good only through September 24, 2005. Such as mini macs starting at 479, ibooks starting at 900 etc. Good deals. Still dont know if i want to get one now by working out  a deal with my parents since im most likely going to be employed by mid augest.(i should have at least 300 saved by then). Might wait for the intels in them idk. Bit torrent finally works with my new router so many cds being downloaded such as average rate of 4 in hour if i want. Ive been chillen with scott almost everyday lately lots of crap blowing up. Were immature but its cool. Hopefully we will get some filming done the next few days with 2 cams."

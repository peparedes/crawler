I CANT MAKE LJ CUTS ANYMORE!!!!<br /><br />:-(<br /><br />Alright so....let me just scream out my schedule before i talk about stuff.<br /><br />Tonight -- Meadowbrook&nbsp;<br />Tomorrow -- 3:45 Shift at Patrick's<br />Tuesday -- 10:30 Shift at Patrick's, then going to Jill's for a bit.<br />Wednesday -- With Ben&nbsp;<strong>all day long.<br /></strong>Thursday -- Meadowbrook. Molly - Make sure you come see me:)<br />Friday -- Meadowbrook<br />Saturday -- Dad's work<br />Sunday -- Meadowbrook.<br /><br />Okay now that I've gotten that out of the way...let me tell you a little about a fellow at Meadowbrook. His name is Aaron, and he's 35...and he's funny, and nice, but....So he works at the icecream stand across the way from us, and we talk all the time, and it used to be normal, but now....<br /><br />...well lets just say that he's buying me flowers, and asking to go to concerts with me, and he's blown me some kisses.<br /><br />Yeahhhh. I think he tested the waters a little cause he was like ""So would your boyfriend be mad if i bought you flowers?"" and i was like ""uhh..yeah."" lol...but i think today he's getting me them anyways! I'll keep you updated on sketchy stalker.<br /><br />So...speaking of that boyfriend of mine....:-( I miss him. I haven't seen him in like, <strong>forever, </strong>and...i feel like we're <strong>drifting </strong>and I <strong>hate </strong>it and <u>I don't know what to do.</u> Wednesday we're spending all day together, i hope...maybe that will make me feel better.<br /><br />I think i'm going to take him to gunstock and go horseback riding:-) and then maybe a little mini golf, or something:-)&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>I love him so much.<br /><br /></strong>So i think I'm going to call Patricia and ask her to take me off the waitlist for New Zealand. I've gotten over the fact that I'm not accepted...Im still a little shocked and disappointed, but...I've pretty much accepted it. And i think maybe I'll just go abroad during college or something...I donno. But i am contemplating having her take me off the list.<br /><br />Speaking of colleges...<strong>COLLEGE SEARCHING SUCKS.</strong> Okay so the one school I <strong>really really really really really</strong> want to get into is like...a ""never-gonna-happen"" sorta thing.&nbsp;<br /><br />Yeah, its Yale.<br /><br />Well, whatever, i'm visiting Yale next week...along with BU, and probably Williams and Suffolk. And then I'm flying out to Michigan and going to U of M, M State, and Albian.&nbsp; And <strong>then </strong>I'm going to NY and going to all the colleges there....and <strong>then</strong> I'm finding random colleges in CA and if i want to go visit then I'll go there too.<br /><br />JESUS!<br /><br /><strong>xxmiserylovemexx: you should definitely mention that i think you are a sexy beast and that i'd tap that. </strong><br />--Its true.&lt;3.<br /><br /><br />Alright let me think..anything else really important worth mentioning? I dont think so.<br /><br />Trac - your <strong>amazing.</strong> I just thought i should mention that:)<br /><br />alright....<br /><br />xox Sro&lt;333"

lol.

well mrs.landroche has a meeting with the DMV people today to discuss me scheduling another session and therefore getting my license on the 28th.

So hopefully that works:)

Okay well i dont have much to say...im actually kinda depressed. i dont know why. all i really want to do is talk to benj, but he's off with jj probably...so...yeahhhh. im at home baking him cookies.

maybe i'll bring them into work tomorrow instead.

whateverrrrr. im sick and tired of being here right now.

So she was going to put two sessions into one today, so i can get my license on the 28th. well for the whole frigging hour we drove on and off the bypass...finally she was like ""well since we dont have traffic we'll go back to the school and just make up the hour later."" so guess when im getting my license?

August 15.

FUCK YOU.

I need to calm down. but i'm so ripshit, its not even funny.

so today i had an apt at 10...got home at 1030. and sat. and waited. i thought maybe i was going to see ben. yeah, i didnt. whatever. so at 330 i went to my driving.

I just dont care. I just dont.

People suck, and im moving. Once i get my license, im running mrs. landroche over and then im moving. 


You people wonder why i'm going across the world for 6 months.

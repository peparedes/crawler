"event","ah everyone asks me to update this livejournal (which I made as a joke in the beggining PS!) and now noooo one comments but everyone still annoys for updates....grr 

anyways- I am sooo bored, this summer hopefully will pick-up...ahh rup is leaving me, jenny is leaving me, FL suckssssss! andd all my Nobles lovers are like MIA these days- they're all in South Africa or Berlin together or at their summer housesss ugh why didn't I go!
yeah so tomro= big parties (well TWO- and I HAVE to go to both *one Sweet 16, one graduation/going-away party*  so that should be interesting) <---- FINALLY! something worthwhilee

the highlight of my summer days is fulfilling my Desperate Housewives scenario- whoever gets that: bravo!!!

umm yeah and me and Court are generating seducing plans....what's new? riding new vehicles is what we do best- right court? 

hmm and having as many last minute crazy sleepovers with jennyyyyy who is leaving soon...newport bebe? haha last time we watched America's Next Top Model and were inspired and took these goofy pictures that we thought were wicked artistic until we actually saw them- example: alena taking off her earings became a work of art- 

<img src=""http://tinypic.com/5zqxj5"" alt=""Image hosted by TinyPic.com"">

uhh I guess the artistic part came in when we realised we didn't know how to actually WORK the camera and most of the pictures were inappropriate anyway.....haha gotta love us...anyways more entertaining pictures are always on the way.... 

haha okay other than that- working at Mass General Hospital this summer two days a week with cancer patients (even tho it's just not the same without my MGH buddy...he is off to med school now...sniff)  and doing a bit here and there and then a big trip around the world in August...woo! 

alrighty, bedtime- later ;-)

ps- u wonder why jenny's pics are not here: well if I wanna stay alive I best refrain haha"

I am mad because of yesterday nite and kinda disappointed in some of my friends
I am also mad because I like never get to see my friends anymore and I feel so distanced from some ppl that used to be my best friends and I hate ittttt so much cuz I genuinely miss them and I love them so much
and that is mostly because I live so far from ppl and when ppl do remember to call me cuz they think I can make it, usually I can't get there for some stupid reason like the SNOW .....ugh
and I have just been really stressed lately because of this whole moving thing and everything going on in my life that ah I just can't take it.....afjdkl
and what really makes me mad too is that my only friend that lives close (this is what I get for never going to school in my own town), is moving to FL......this upsets me....Jenny is one of my best friends and we never really get to properly hang out anymore and ugh

I guess I should stay at home tho, even tho I don't want to since I am exhausted from going to bed last nite at like 4:30 AM, woo cuz I was at Molly's housey....that was a lot of fun tho and I got to see Jake Kringdon and Katy in Grease, the musical. They were both great of course and it was an unb (woo Hingham lingo) performance all in all, and then us girls and Mrs. Kringdon and Molly's babysitter Juliette went to the Ground Round for some chow after the show and Caitlin and Craig went homeee (they are so cute, it makes me happy!!!!!!!) and then we went back to Molly's at like midnite and attempted for an hour to decide which movie to watch and when we decided, it turned out to be horrible so we watched like 3 per-per-view moviesss that were supposidly 'horror' and somehow we laughed hysterically but also got really scared and everyone went to bed but then me and Molly stayed up to watch a documentary on VH1 about Paris Hilton (myyyy idol haha, I want her life so bad, eek) and so ""That's Hott!"" 
todayyyy I am watching the Pats game (WE ARE WINNING, WOOO) and then the Golden Globes and then some work......"

"event","hey, I just got back from NYC last nite and it took SO long because of the snow storm (it snowed a foot here!)
anyways, MERRY CHRISTMAS AND HAPPY HOLIDAYS to all of you! (and a HAPPY NEW YEAR to come!)
so I left for NY on Wednesday (got out of school on Monday, and just skipped Tuesday) and that nite me and my two older girlie cousins took me to The Roosevelt's Field Mall for some last minute shopping. Then, on Thursday my family and my cousins and aunt and uncle went to Atlantic City to celebrated my guy cousin's 21st bday! :-D so we stayed up till 4:30 AM and me and my cousins (all older and in their 20's), went to ALL the big hotels and casinos and gambled the nite away (oops, there goes some of my Christmas money) and then went to a bar and got my cousins some drinks since he would be turning 21 on Saturday...we stayed the night at an awesome hotel called Caesar's...I won some and lost some, but ultimately lost $20....ya I know ur wondering how I even got in...well my cousins dressed me up to look 21, in my mom's clothes and their clothes, woot woot and so I did not get carded (xcept once outside 'The Blue Martini' so we couldn't go in there). After spending another day in Atlantic City, we all drove home (my cousins' housey) back to NY (about 4-5 hours away) and then one of my cousin's and her husband went back to their appartment in New Jersey. 
Here are some pics of the hotels and casinos:

Now for Christmas!
all my cousins and their family and my family got together, opened presenttsss (my parents are the grinches of this Christmas b/c they gave me only money, to go buy my own presents!) and then we ateeee lots of foody and Christmas was my cousin's 21st bday so there was looooots of cake involved and we all snuggled together in the family room and watched Three's Company till late at nite. Sundayyyyyy we left for homeee

so yeah before Lex's I went to Julia's housey w/ Elena to get ready and that was awesome, we got ready in her penthouse suite and then Nick (my new personal chauffer...haha yay) came to pick us up and took us to Lex's.
then at Lex's we ate Chinese food and everyone watched The OC in her ""movie theater"" 
of course me and Craig (my OC-watching buddy) had in intense convo while watching the show woo 
Nick and Rob took some ppl in their cars to Friendly's (ah and Kerin drove, so thank goodness I didn't go....haha jk Ker I am just messing around- I bet ur an amazing driver) and I stayed in and played (more like watched) ppl play at Lex's poker table
and then slowly all the guys left and it was just us girlies and that is when the *REAL* party started
haha we did our *stuff* (just for us to know...;-) haha I am so mysterious), and then we watched Sex and the City
I was leaping around like a fool and fell and hurt myself, but couldn't feel it till today ahh
and then everyone went sleepy and I gave Molly one of the longest back massages of my LIFE
haha and this morning I woke up with no ride home, so we ate Dunkin Donuts and then I was the last to leave Lex's housey
so we got to bond (FINALLY!).....woo and clean up her basement (YAY!) with this really cool vaccuum cleaner that is attatched to the wall (woo, woo haha)
and now I am home and Lex is out getting her permit (even tho she thinks the shape of a stop sign is a pentagon....AH! eek, octagon maybes, Lex? =-O) haha and Ky was feeling sickly last nite (SO FEEL BETTER!) and now I am craving Lex's bday cake that Fabia (sp?) made, BUT I need to do USH extra-credit before JENNY comes over for another night of funness ;-)

Shane Oman: You're right, hon. 
Regina George: I like *invented* her, you know what I mean? 

Regina: [Repeated Line] I know, right? 

Gretchen: That is so fetch!

[trying to avoid plans with Regina] 
Karen: I can't go out. 
[coughs softly] 
Karen: I'm sick. 
Regina: Boo. You whore.

Regina: Oh my God, I love your skirt! Where did you get it? 
Girl: It was my mom's in the '80s. 
Regina: Vintage, so adorable. 
Girl: Thanks. 
Regina: [after girl walks away] That is the ugliest f-ing skirt I've ever seen.

Regina: But you're, like, really pretty. 
Cady: Thank you. 
Regina: So you agree? 
Cady: What? 
Regina: You think you're really pretty?

two years ago, my family and I were supposed to move to Orange County, right next to the Laguna Beach area (Newport Beach) and we even picked out a house and got me into a school there! But, then my parents decided against it, and needless to say I was upset, but I know I am totally gunna go to college in California (I hope and will do anything to) and then will live there after college, woo! (and I was born in LA, so ya know how it is..... ;-) yesssss)

"event","hey, sum ppl asked to read it cuz they heard about it and other ppl thought it was funny (haha as did I.....lighten up people who took me all seriously!) so here it issss once again ladies and gentlemen:

Hey everyone!
So Kaius was telling me today how lame live journals are, so I thought, I would change his mind by writing all about HIM! (plus he payed notice to how many times I named other guys, so I think he felt left out....) wooT (yeah Kaius, ""woot"" is a word along with ""woo"" and ""whoop"" )

KaiusJG (9:05:10 PM): so, you write your stupid journal yet? 
CuTiEgUrL31300 (9:05:46 PM): hahaha nope
CuTiEgUrL31300 (9:06:05 PM): but I can tell ur psycheddd for the thing, ""All About Kaius"" hahaha
KaiusJG (9:07:30 PM): i am, i want to know what you think about me
KaiusJG (9:07:41 PM): its gonna be wicked funny

okay so Kaius is like one of the most *unique* ppl you will ever meet. He lived in England for a bunch of years and yet he has no accent and hates foreigners. Also, Kaius is hysteral (when he is not using his sense of humor to be mean.....cough cough) and quite the stud (as per the ladies). He does not give a crap about what anyone thinks of him, and quotes movie lines with Jack and Ty and everyone like it's his biz. His name is pretty unique, kinda like him, and since I don't happen to have a pic (besides the one of him on his own profile of him peeing on a wall) at the current moment (but maybe he will be generous enough to supply us with one), I will describe quickly what he looks like: tallish, blonde hair, erm blue eyes (maybe?), and stuff ya not much of a description but whatever....oh he kinda looks like Owen Wilson, but at the same time kinda no......I wanna say something nice here, but I think it would be best to mention his fav. phrase is ""Alena, shut the fuck up!"" (and so I will keep MY nice comments to myself) oh and he could be on Dreamstreet if he wanted and hmm what a crazy kid.....

Random Survey:

If he was an animal he would be a lion cub (thank u anymous person that said that and doesn't wish to be named!)....

CuTiEgUrL31300 (9:28:17 PM): one word
CuTiEgUrL31300 (9:28:19 PM): to describe kaius
CuTiEgUrL31300 (9:28:22 PM): haha what would it be
petersen359 (9:28:35 PM): uhhh
petersen359 (9:28:38 PM): fascist?

friz107 (9:31:29 PM): kaius and i had a nice chat about how aim, despite its ""american online instant messaging"" name, can still be found in england and france

p o p r o x 5 7 (9:34:37 PM): one word to describe kaius
p o p r o x 5 7 (9:34:38 PM): banging

PS- question of the day: should I play ice hockey this winter or not?! ahh

re-post of deleted entry to re-cap for my estis (aka Molly): 

Ok! ah where to start? Well, I guess I'll start by saying that I decided to make one of these thingys like two weeks ago and never got the chance, but yesterday nite I got back from NYC and had nothing better to do so here goes-

Thursday was Thanksgiving and I had a kickass time (my cousin drove me to her fam's housey on Wednesday which is in Queens, NY and my fam and more ppl joined us on Thursday).....my cousin's husband (not the same cousin who drove me there) got me drunk because everyone else was, so wut the heck. It was a good night- yummy food, lots of alcohol, great company.....what can I say? :-D

Friday was even more kickass. I went to Manhattan bright and early in the morning and met up with Sarah at Grand Central Station and then we met up with James and his cousin Dmitry who we nicknamed D-dawg (or D for short). Then the four of us and James' entire extended family that came all the way from LA for an engagement party, hit up the mean streets of NYC. We went to Ground Zero, Rockafelller Center, Radio City Music Hall, this hott NY pizza joint, 5th Avenue, etc. and the four of us took taxis all around like it was our buisiness. Then my parents took me and Sarah around while James' fam hit up the Rockettes. Then we met up with them again, and James, D, Sarah, and I went back to their hotel room at The W. After great difficulty getting into their room, we hung out and ""watched"" the movie ""How High"". I actually was daring and tried D's cigarette one teeny time and almost died, so wutev that was like legit stupid. But, we spent a couple hours of doing this ;) and that ;) in the hotel suite, which would be inappropriate for me to state in this livejournal. Then me and Sarah went homey later that night and went back to Queens. 

Yesteday, I dropped Sarah off somewhere in the middle of Connecticut to meet her family, and now I am home in MA and am wicked tired, but at the same time, too lazy to go to bed. Anwaysssa, enough of this for now!

"event","hey all! okay, so I had to get rid of my last entry because some people have legit issues with things, and couldn't deal with it. SO, I had to take it off before they further sounded like losers. Fortunately, I really don't care much about what they have to say with their nonsense commentsss, BUT since SOME of them are my friends, I thought I'd apologise for saying anything wrong or giving off the wrong impression (if you know what I am talking about then great, if not then w/e), that really was not the intention. I just thought this was a cool way to keep people updated, but hey, I guess there are other perspectives people can look at it from. Anyways, all for now!

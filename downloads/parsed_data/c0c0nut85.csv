"event","Wassa babys---ihavent written in like over 2 months!! where have I been? that i do not know! But anyways, i was just reading everyone live journals and VERO- i completely agree with you. the phrase ""i love you"" has become so cliche now. I mean i cant say that i dont say i love you to everyone all the time, because i am used to it but the problem with tthat is that since its overused and everything its beginning to lose its value and stufdf. now when someone says i love you to me /I don't take it as such a big deal, more like yea youre cool..!! Whne i say i love you online i always spell is LOV or LUV cause its not real love---its only real when i say i loove someone as a friend or family--but guy love, nope not just yet....vero look what you startred you got me babbling over some shit now!!! haha well guys i just wanted to let everyone know that i moved today, YES I CCAN OFFICIALLY SLEEP IN MY NEW HOUSE NOW, ITS ALL LEGAL!!!!! so come visit me this weekend-its in Golden Beach on collins--prob around 200th or 190 somehting...

I was soo excited and happy to see all of you that i saw b/c i was like oh hellz yea we all get to chill real nice right? WRONG! Sean and Noah flip me over and drag me sall over the floor while everyoone pitches in--then while theyre are lifting up my legs they notice that i have a huge hole in my pants--right on my crotch. then everyone sits on me and shit i didnt even know what they were doing anymore. then like 5 people trip me (sean, sean, sean, sean, and sean.) then you bang me into the bleachers, then you mess up my hair, then you permanently made my knuckles red ...but its a ""sunburn"" right sean? then gabe smacks my asss sooooo hard, then rebecca llike grabs my boobs or something..then my hair thing gets stuck in my hair and while im taking it out like 20 people hurt me. Finally it was all over and i was saying goodbyes to everyone and i was like ok vero, your turn so i grabbed her to put her in the garbage and as she was being put in there, what do i see in the garbage can?

"event","quote of hte day """"You cannot say you've lost a friend. If a friendship is capable of ending, it is because it never existed."" =---yeah thats right thers so much craziness goin on right now that is not even worth it. There are so many more important things in life to be worrying about. Hope everyone reads this cause it might just be a part about you. Sometimes i feel like everybody is just turning on me. Thats when i realize who my true friends are (you know who you are) becasue you are always there for me. Melanie Lauren and Ana thanks so much for today i love you with all my heart and i don;t know where i would be without you girls. probably lost because with all thisshit happening you guys have stuck by me every minute. I love you guys. But then there are also oother people...those people who hurt me and betray me...those people whom i feel used by..theyre my ""BFF"" when they need something or they need me to talk to or findout stuff about someone for them...its just not cool. And they think i don't realize but im not dumb like that and its not hard to see. I miss a lot of people. I miss chilling with summer people so much.Especialy Kyle and Darren and josh, we had some good times. I hope to see you guys real soon you guys are the coolest people ever. I miss dustin --not only cause hes the HOTTESSTTT guy ever but hes tthe coolest i love him and he always knew how to make me smile-dustin come visit me when i move i will chill with you everyday. I miss Brian Beraha. Brian, always making fun of me and throwing balls at me, i miss you tons. I miss Elana, now in michigan state, i love you babe i have never met such an incredible girl like you and i hope to see you soon. Mike Courtney, you are definitley the best and i love you@!!!! i know you are in NY but the minute you get here you are taking em out, i miss you!I miss maccabi. Maccabi was all about expressing yourself and having fun without having everyone judge you about everything you do at all times. It was about actually loving who you really are. I miss Noah, i miss you so much im coming to see you November 21st better fucken show me agood time..jk. I miss Roberto, talking to you everyday..you are one of the few who always understood how i felt and you were always there through good times and bad..im so happy we are so close again but not like we used to be at first and i damn miss you a lot . i love you best friend. I miss you Stefanie. Even though it maight not seem like it, i really do miss you. You were (and to me still are) one of my best best friends ever and i don't know what happened to us at all. To tell you the truth I called you every single day for like the past 5 months. Everyday and out of those 5 months i think you called me back 2 or 3 times. I just got sick of being the only one putting in all the effort--A friendship works 2-way. Anyway, i still miss you and all the amazing times we always have together. Nick i love you husband. ""Punk man 4: wife!!""  i love you i love you i love you! I dont know why because you are such a sell-out but i do because you are one of the madd-coolest kids i know by far and when i move next to you nick---we will be madd chillen and partyin so damn much you will have the time of your life--and I WILL COME PICK YOU UP IN MY CAR...haha big kiss to you nick, i miss you...Meagan, ilana, elena, vero...you guys are the best im so happy we became close again this year youz my girls and will always be! Beccs,youz my girl too for sure we gotta start chillen on weekends though...I miss monica candice jessie and judy we used to be so close what happened---i still love you guys a lot...Sean, nestor, anthony...so glad to have met you guys hope to become better friends with you guys though---nestor i have bonded with you already--you gonn dance for me/? Sean sometimes it bothers me when all you talk about to me is stuff that you want me to do for you or like i dotn know--i know you dont do it intentionally but it still bothers me and i am letting you know only because today i am just letting everything go and everything out. anthony-hope to become better friends. Alex Smu i will miss you asm my neighbor you are the best. 
Hope for the ebst for everyone, have a great year and goodluck with everything
For those whom i love, its for true, I LOVE YOOU and thanks for always being there
feel free to comment on this--actuaally id really appreciate it

"event","Today I'm feeling really weird.  I had like the best day ever, but then again today is the National Day Of Prayer so during class we gave moments of silnece and prayers...it really got me thinking about all those poor families who have lost their loved ones and how lucky i am to be here living such an amazing life with my family and friends. (I love my best friends).I wish there was something i could do to help but i am too young to even give blood or anything..i feel horrible for that matter.  
          After school i went to hang out with some friends but the guy that hurt me now likes my friend and they were all over eachother. It was kinda WEIRD...Whatever i guess i kinda felt out of place and stuff. So i walked away from them, thinking about stuff and I then called another one of my best friends just by talking to him i felt comforted. i love him so much, i would do anything in the world for him. I used to love him as a guy but that created many problems so i've learned to love him as my best friend. 
        I think there;s only one or two people who could understand the way i am feeling now..im feeling really WEIRD

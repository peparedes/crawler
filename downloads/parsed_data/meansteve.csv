Last month I moved down to Las Vegas, expecting to find a career and a life and success.

I was met with disappointment, frustration, heartache, unemployment and homelessness.

Fuck yeah!

So, since I fear that I'll never, ever get a job and I've basically hemorrhaged all my dang money out onto the floor and now lay on the ground gasping for air with a sucking wound through my bank account, I figure I may as well blog about it.

I suppose I'll do here like Griph does and post links whenever I do a new entry and continue languishing in obscurity until somebody fucking notices me and starts paying me to do the thing that I do better than 90% of the assholes who <i>do</i> get paid to do this shit.

Good times. At least there's no snow down here."

"event","I don't know why I didn't mention the whole story/gameplay segregation/integration issues that keep coming up in games.

Half-Life 2 is praised for its tight storytelling, when it's in actuality no different than games like Marathon or Metal Gear Solid in which all action comes to a complete grinding halt while you read or listen to the exposition. Hell, one of the scientists in HL2: Episode 2 even lantern-hangs this by stating outright that he's spewing an expository monologue! How is this honestly any different than earlier games which give you background data as plaintext during a between-levels loading screen.

Certain games that are very story-heavy end up becoming interactive novels, to the point where the game seems like an afterthought to both the creator and the player (again, Marathon, MGS and HL2), the player though is so compelled by the story that he's compelled to continue through it, to slog though muddy, repetitive, boring gameplay (MGS3) just to finish the story.

Metal Slug didn't have much of an established story, forcing the player to imagine in the holes. Dictator on the rampage, Vest Dudes and Cutie Girls gotta fight him. Dictator sides with Mars People. In a move nobody saw coming, Mars People turn on Dictator. BLOW UP RADLY-RENDERED STUFF! That's basically all there is to it. Each character onscreen has a unique appearance and mannerism. This is what advertising copy-writers refer to as ""story appeal."" 

Is this entirely ""better"" than the rigidly-defined characters from the ""deeper"" interactive novels? That's entirely up to the viewer. I will say this: Fio is still way-cuter than Alyx.

"event","This is an idea I've been kicking around for the past few weeks and trying to stitch down, streamline and get done right with a minimum of capital invested on my end.

First things first, I found some sweet shit on the Ebay that I intend on buying once I get this round of bills paid off. <a href=""http://cgi.ebay.com/Nady-DKW-1-Wireless-Lavalier-Mic-System-Factory-Refurb_W0QQitemZ380101801031QQcmdZViewItemQQptZLH_DefaultDomain_0?hash=item587fd53447"">Wireless Lav kit for 28$</a>, a <a href=""http://cgi.ebay.com/BEHRINGER-XENYX-502_W0QQitemZ160370819872QQcmdZViewItemQQptZLH_DefaultDomain_0?hash=item2556d88320"">Behringer 502 4-input mixer</a> for 15$ or 40$ One Click Buy It Now and a <a href=""http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16812156023"">Cheapy USB2 capture device</a> for 32$. I'm a fan of Newegg and I prefer to do business with them for some reason. They've treated me right in the past and I'll continue to do business with them. I digress.

Why do I need this stuff? Well, here's my plan:
<lj-cut text=""[eyecatch] [commercial break] [eyecatch]"">


I intend on doing a little web show of episodes no longer than six minutes each in which I travel to pawn shops, used stores and thrift shops and track down bizarre, unusual, weird, unknown/underappreciated and totally sweet games. The show will be half travelogue / half video game / media series. 

But here's the twist: It's not going to be a review show per se. No Yahtzee-style can't-enjoy-anything criticism, no Seanbaby-style non-sequitur ranting, no Nostalgia Critic-style low-production-values-bullshit-that's-somehow-beloved-by-tens-of-thousands-of-mouthbreathing-cretins* low-charisma idiocy.

No. I've decided to adopt the kind of stylistic direction as Anthony Bourdain's series ""No Reservations"" in which the camera follows me as I discuss geography and history and tie it into a game I'd found, all the while holding a sort of wisty, nostalgic tone to my narration and voice, in stark contrast to the way I imagine everybody else imagines my literary voice; as more of a gibbon dangling from a vine, hooting excitedly and throwing half-chewed mango at passersby.

We then transition to actually playing the game and discussing how it affects me, as an individual in that primal, lizard-brain instant-gratification center that videogames are intended to touch a person. At least that's what I'm told. I do recall in fourth grade being asked by the school psychologist to show him on the doll where exactly Super Mario Bros. 2 touched me.

In this series I eschew any pretense I have at being some kind of illuminated, intellectual, liberal art-school graduate and revert to my roots as what I think is a state of zen; a well-read, hard-fightin', well-traveled, storied, hard-drinkin', passionate desert-dwelling hillbilly that ""grew up"" with video games as a parental surrogate. Instead of presenting myself as one of the well-dressed web video assholes with a sportcoat and tie, I'll buck the trend by wearing beat-up old BDU trousers, slogan t-shirts (ZU-related homemade stencils or screenprints) and aloha shirts. I also have this totally sweet black cowboy hat. Your hat is a pussy, Yahtzee.

I've watched enough travelogues on the Travel Channel to understand how to shoot, compose, edit and tone a travelogue. It'll be difficult at first to do the shooting, lighting and audio gathering myself, so chances are, for this thing to be something great, I'll have to troll Craigslist for a PA.

I've been fiddling around with a <a href=""http://camstudio.org/"">neat screencasting utility</a> to actually grab the video being displayed on my monitor as a video file. I'll do this for emulated games. The video capture device is for capturing video from my varied consoles. I even saw a neat <a href=""http://speeddemosarchive.com/forum/index.php?topic=8983.0"">homebrew kit for capturing video from a DS</a> (original generation, so note-to-self, score one used).

Recurring jokes:
- Thrown controller montage.
- Any time I give an actual criticism of a game, it instantly cuts away to some cute girl giving a very hostile and disappointed line about my sexual prowess.
- Fightin' and Drinkin'. I have enough friends in my ju-jitsu and shootin'-stuff circles that can participate in punching me/getting punched by me as well as stage gunplay silliness. Also, I really like gin, this cannot be helped.
- Arrests. I have a friend in the Lyon County Sheriff's Office. Perhaps I can run a deal in which I have a recurring visual gag in which I'm arrested after making a joke about things that would be patently or statutorily illegal (drugs, violence, the inevitable underage jokes that'll come with an episode focusing on Pokemon).
- Self-awareness. Call myself out on when I get overly-nostalgic.
- Firefly Facepalm of the Week. Every week, as the episode's stinger, I state a moment from the inexplicably-beloved series Firefly that made me cringe with embarrassment. (jesus this could be a feature on its own!)**


Episode Ideas:
- Gun - PS2. I'm a fella who's from the Old West and likes revolvers. Hell I carry two. In short, Gun is an awful GTA3-clone set in the Old West. Is it fun? Sure. But it's pretty short and disappointing. Compare and contrast Red Dead Revolver, Gun.Smoke and Sunset Riders (SR fucking rules, btw)

- Battletoads - NES. Wisty nostalgic piece in which I discuss how shit my life was in middle school and how all I really had holding me together was Battletoads and my undying desire to conquer it. Cut to twenty years later and I still can't beat the fucker. Discuss Rare / Coin-It's track record, how they came to be and why they were an important player in the Nintendo-dominated era. All this over screencast video of me playing the game with the disclaimer that I'm going through it with the Game Genie on, running Infinite Lives. It'd be a long, brutal montage of three second clips showing every time I died, complete with rolling ticker at the bottom. In comparison, I can go through Metal Slug 3 in fewer than 30 credits.

- Oni - PS2/Windows. Noble successor to the Battletoads throne, the most compellingly-frustrating game of the last console generation or rightfully-ignored piece of shit? Discuss the genesis of the game, its schizophrenic art style and how it, like much media from the late 90s was directly inspired by mid/early-'90s anime (Ghost in the Shell in particular - cf. The Matrix, Shogo Mobile Armor Division). Also, state how the game is only fun when you are running the Infinite Ammo cheat. Max Payne is the game Oni should have been. Also, there's a reason I have two copies of this game, keyboard and mouse is fucking retarded for a beat-em-up.

- Playing Mega Crap - Long-time ZU readers (basically my whole flist less Hilary I think) will know Mega Crap. What's not known is that last time I went to San Jose, my friend Compy fabbed up a damn real, live, actual fuckin' Mega Crap cart for me. This episode will show the trials and tribulations involved in making a cart, in burning the ROM image to an EPROM (which itself was a Battletoads-level exercise in frustrating) and how Mega Crap is honestly the Original Gangster of the entire modding scene and how you little shits that play Counterstrike and Team Fortress should show some fucking respect.

- Bokosuka Madness - Compy also fabbed up a Bokosuka Wars cart. How fucking rad is that? Detail the maddening quest one man takes in unraveling its mysteries and defeating the game. Travelogue Segment: Tracking down a totally sweet bottle of three dollar cab sauv.

- Metal Slug Anthology - PS2/Wii. Underappreciated by mainstream gamers, lauded and praised by people with sense in their heads. I go out of my way to track down Metal Slug cabinets. Travelogue Section: Metal Slug machines in my general vicinity. I know of at least six. Also take some time to discuss lovingly the Irem shooters that are MS's direct ancestors. Also, the Wii's controls fucking suck. Shake the Wiimote to throw a grenade? Why? There's a perfectly good trigger button right under your left middle finger. ,.|..

- Playing Violence Fight - Arcade. A VF cab is owned by Tip Top Amusement and Vending in Carson City. They have to know where the game is. It's my mission to track it down and play it again. There was at one time, a VF cab in the discount theater where I worked my first job. The 1P 8-way was stuck and you could only play as 2P if 2P joined and beat 1P. Fucking weak. Wisty nostalgic horseshit about Carson City and my love/hate relationship with the town. ""It seems that the town is full of people who share the same interests in media as me but also harbor gambling and substance abuse problems. This is why I'm able to grab a copy of Planet Earth on DVD for six dollars."" Also: get a great shot of the Nugget's facade. <a href=""http://renoscasinos.com/carson/city.html"">Street Fighter 2, bitches!</a>

- Zelda Wind Waker / Controller Issues - GC. While not an underdog, bizarre or maligned, Wind Waker is a totally sweet game with <i>bullshit backwards-assed c-stick controls</i>. In this episode, I discuss how I find a copy of Wind Waker at a pawn shop for C H E E P and then go into a segment where I take a controller into the workshop and perform some gruesome surgery on it in order to flip the axes on the c-stick or second analog while discussing how much the insistence that up=look up and right=look left shit pisses me the fuck right off.

- Metal Slug revisited. I intend on writing a game design doc which transposes the rules from Metal Slug into an FPS situation and submit it to the Half-Life 2 modding community. I want to know, is it possible to glean as much enjoyment from Metal Slug in a different medium. This will open the door to another series of essay-style episodes in which I transpose genres into different media, such as: turn-based strategy into a third-person shooter. Shooter into RPG (RM2K community), and others as I think them up.

- Beyond Good and Evil - XBox. Holy shit is this ever an underappreciated gem. I think that more people have played with my wiener than with this game. Which given the amount of times I've woken up sprawled out in an alley plus one hangover minus one pair trousers, isn't difficult to imagine.  I found my (current) copy in a pawn shop in Sparks (""It's said of Reno that it's so close to hell you can see Sparks"") for five fucking dollars. Holy shit goddamn! I lost (or had stolen -__- ) my original copy some years back and it's heartbreaking, as BG&E is a beautiful game that nobody played and also has the same horseshit second analog controls issue as Wind Waker.

- Breakdown - XBox. Irritating first-person puncher. What a piece of shit. It's Oni all over again. Bullshit combos that you can't ever remember, all requiring beat-perfect timing that expert Guitar Hero players can't possibly pull off and ineffectual gunplay. Interesting novelty, transposing a fighter into FPS, but nothing that hasn't already been done by The Super Spy and Punch-Out! Tried again with Mirror's Edge to mixed results. Tie this in as a callback to Metal Slug Revisited episode. - or - Combine the two.

- Bayou Billy - NES. My life's story is co-opted by those fuckers at Konami!

- Rolling Thunder Retrospective. Goddamn do I ever love me up some Rolling Thunder. Little do you realize that the much-maligned SUNA RT clone Rough Rangers had residence in local Carson fixture, Rico's Pizzeria. Similar to the Playing Violence Fight episode, this one is more about me tracking down Rough Rangers and playing it again.

- The Wizard and Me. Interesting fun Steve fact! Was part of the casting process for The Wizard. Producer was scouting locations in my town (Gardnerville) for shooting the movie and caught me begging for quarters from my grandpa at a local casino (Sharkey's). I'm sure I was playing that bullshit gun game Cheyenne or Choplifter. More Travelogue than games episode in which I wax nostalgic about the movie and the places it was shot and how I played in them as a child. Hey big surprise that I spent a lot of time in pizza restaurants as a kid, right? (this may end up being the pilot episode)

- Bubble Ghost - GB. Sweet puzzle game that few people have heard of and even fewer have played. Travelogue section to spooky-balls haunted shit (Virginia City is a great spooky-balls haunted shit location)

- MANLY GAMES. Games so manly your beard will sprout, your muscles will throb and you'll basically have a hard-on so hard that it'll basically tear the universe asunder, its density will be so great that it'll form a tiny singularity. I speak of course of. ~TwInKlE StAr SpRiTeS~ (Arcade, PSX-Import) This episode can also deal with modding your PS2 to accept a boot disc and allow you to play any damn game.

- Emulation vs. Real Media. I think this is a valid topic of discussion, the debate of which deserves an entire episode. Personally, I'm on the emu side but I'd much rather have the legit cart/system if it can be had. There's something just visceral about it. Also featured: DIY controllers and my teenymame project!

- Interview with Ulillillia. Dude is insane, but our kind of insane. Guy should be cherished as a National Treasure among video gamers. Hat is perpetually off, glass is perpetually tipped to U-dogg.

- Charles Barclay Shut Up and Jam: Gaiden. - RM2K. And RM games in general. Crossover episode with Richie in which we discuss freeware RPGs, how much I hate RPGs but will make an exception for one that's truly fantastic (Chrono Trigger, CBSUAJ:G and uh ???) as well as a jaunt into the bowels of the RPG Maker community and why CBSUAJ:G works well as a comedy game and why the myriad other RM games fall so flat as comedy. Maybe interview the creators?

- Duke It Out! Duke Nukem retrospective. Wisty nostalgic horseshit about the early shareware scene and how I was introduced to it and Duke Nukem by way of a 3.5"" floppy bearing the first shareware episode as a Christmas gift circa 1994. Discuss the lesser-known Duke games (oh god the one on the PSX sucks balls but The Manhattan Project is great!) and lament the leaked footage from the cancelled Duke Forever.

- Future ideas/Random noodling that I have to write down or the consciousness stream will wind through the rocks and then cascade off the rushing falls of my intellect:
` The Game Boy through its four (five?) iterations as a handheld has been a dumping-ground for shovelware. Track down an Urban Yeti cart. Urban Yeti fucking rules.
` I fucking hate GTA3 San Andreas - not as an ironic iconoclast that's attacking things that are generally held as good - but as a dude that's tired of needless minigames and tacked-on ""RPG Elements"" that he doesn't want to play but is forced to anyway to progress the story. Compare and Contrast to System Shock/SS2 (also, I am so bent out of shape that I can't find my SS media). Also, Mercenaries Playground of Destruction out-GTAs GTA.
` Sly Cooper series is fucking awesome and I'm glad I grabbed a second-hand copy at a Gamestop so many years ago.
` Game Crazy is going out of business. That's a total fucking bummer, as I preferred shopping there to Gamestop. Nostalgic travelogue about the games stores that are out of business and the stuff we purchased there. Funcoland (System Shock ;___;), Babbage's (Police Quest Swat 2, total bullshit unwinnable FMV game I still have around somewhere), CompUSA (too many to name, UT, Q3, HL, the first copy of Oni, etc etc); and how depressing it is that there are so few indy game shops in the area (I know of two, in an area of over a half a million people).
` How come Kingpin: Life of Crime was so damn underwhelming?
` Tachyon The Fringe: Wing Commander clone starring Bruce Fucking Campbell. Shit yeah! Underapprciated gem of the eon! <a href=""http://cgi.ebay.com/Tachyon-the-Fringe-for-PC-Computer-Game-Rare_W0QQitemZ280411633124QQcmdZViewItemQQptZVideo_Games_Games?hash=item4149d5f5e4"">Oooooh~ eleven bucks!</a>
` Build-ing worlds. Build engine games that weren't Duke-3D. Blood, Shadow Warrior and Redneck Rampage. All classics. Especially Redneck Rampage fuck yeah.
' Skate or Die 2 is the same game as Skate 2, just four console generations and the ""or die"" removed. Frustrating controls, stupid, pointless story mode that's rendered moot as the big payoff to the story mode is offered from the title screen. Ripoff. Also, skateboarding games are at heart the same as wrestling games in which they require you to stop pressing directions and buttons at a precise moment and then press a different direction and button in order to execute a move. I hate these more than the hold-back-then-forward-and-button moves from Street Fighter.
` Outfoxies (Arcade) vs. Super Smash Bros. (varied Nintendo consoles). Deep-scrolling sidescrolling platform fighting games full of randomly-generated items and weapons. Outfoxies rules, SSB is kind of meh. But that's just like, my opinion.
` Speaking of randomly-generated: Spelunky! Do some more research on procedurally-generated dungeoneering games. (Also is Diablo is just a graphics patch on top of Rogue/NetHack?)

And so on. I have a lot of faith in this project. As soon as I can score that mixer and lavaliere, I can start turning this mother out. This will be the anchor to my relaunch of Zeroes Unlimited. We'll see where it goes and if success follows it.

Onward and upward!

"event","A criticism that's come up from people whose reference pool is shallower than the reservoir tip on a dollar-store condom is that the Saucer from Voices bears too much resemblance to the one in District 9.

While I was going for references and inspirations a little more deep than a current blockbuster, angling more for the obtuse alien mysteries of the novels ""Roadside Picnic"" and ""Rendezvous With Rama"" blended with the foreboding silent dread of the ships from The War Of The Worlds and Independence Day while sharing the worn-out, broken-down spaceship design aesthetic from the short film <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNReejO7Zu8"">Alive In Joburg</a>, which itself was the ""pilot film"" for District 9.

Alas, people only cry ""ripoff!"" at the sight of a broken-down old spaceship hanging overhead.

Fine, whatever, the shitheels with limited literacy win. I've spent a few days rolling the idea around in my head and think that I've discovered how to do a minor retool without scrapping the whole damn thing <i>and</i> making the show more friendly to local advertising interests.

Dig if you will an outline:

At the beginning of the story, it's revealed that there's a recent spate UFO sightings in the geographical vicinity (west coast United States and Canada). Sixie, the frustrated Bracewell probe residing unseen within our primitive Internet sees the Saucer sightings as an opportunity. Sixie wants off this planet and will do whatever it takes to return to an advanced computer network where it can properly think and communicate and live as was intended.*

Sixie uses its ability to manipulate lonely nerds (posing as a synthoid anime girl) to assist in the construction of a sort of FTL broadband antenna so as to allow it to attract and impregnate itself into one of these UFOs. Naturally, the energies and <i>SCIENCE!</i> involved in creating a FTL broadband transmitter causes Weirding to happen.**

Sixie's machinations attract the attention of the UFOs and they congregate over the city. Once Weirdness begins to materialize from the <a href=""http://www.exitmundi.nl/quantum.htm"">quantum vacuum</a>,**** it's at this point that the Saucers begin to take action, they do so exactly as the autonomous broken ship did in the original production bible, by erecting an impenetrable defensive shell around the city and disallowing entry or egress. 

Since the aliens have not press-ganged tens of thousands of Insiders into service to repair the broken ship, I can eschew the abandoned soft post-apocalypse setting I'd originally envisioned, instead replacing the mass shanghai with a few dozen to hundred at most Insiders being taken up onto the ships in an attempt for the aliens to learn to understand our intelligence and communicate. Naturally, the differences between our races' intelligence would be like us humans attempting to have a meaningful conversation with ants.

This change allows me to dodge the claim that I'm simply ripping off District 9 while also making the show friendly to local advertising interests. I had the idea, before I thought of a half dozen saucers over the city was to have the original broken-down saucer just sort of drift like a dinghy awash in the ocean, appearing at any old place in the city, rather than being moored at the city's 0:0 navigation point. The adrift idea was to allow for a nice lingering shot on a local business' storefront with the ship in the background as an establishing shot.

If the business in question were say on the south side of town with its facade pointing north, it would be impossible to get both the storefront and the ship in the frame if the ship were considered anchored at the point where the main drag (Virginia St.) intersects with the Truckee River (Reno's navigational zero point). By allowing for multiple ships, I can just eschew the previous conceit. K.I.S.S. principle, especially as established by the thesis statement in this entry, my audience is so retarded that they're the sorts of folks who call into nationally syndicated radio talk shows because the can't figure out how to fuck.*****

* Check the production bible as linked in the previous entry for the villain Sixie's backstory.
** as per the production bible, ""anomalies"" as far as I'm concerned sounds pretty unimaginitive and hackish, do a mental Ctrl+R and replace ""Anomaly"" with ""Weirdness"" and carry on.***
*** <3 footnotes to footnotes. At long enough timescales, anything is possible. Objects and energies will simply materialize out of the cold, hard vacuum of post Universal entropic heat-death. This is a great explanation of what causes the ""weirding"" to happen, as far as I'm concerned.
**** Zero-point energy collectors and quantum vacuum mines can potentially create infinite, cheap, clean energy that can boost a civilization up a rung on the Kardashev Scale but also you know kind of unmake reality.
***** literate people listen to Coast To Coast, illiterates listen to Loveline. I'm sure Loveline listeners would gripe at this entry if only it weren't a bunch of those funny squiggly little lines all drawn out in rows on that white glowy thing on that box what from their pornography come."

If anybody still cares, I stuck the Word docs relevant to Voices From The Inside up on Trainwreck.

I had a couple of interesting story-noodling ideas in my head that I wanted to jot down before I forgot them.

First:
I want to do a love story with a tragic ending in which a dimension-hopping spacetime-traveler appears. She takes on the form of an exotic-looking supercute human girl with an eerie hair/eye color combination (I was thinking green/purple or orange/gray). She'll explain that ""her"" true form has neither form nor intelligence as we can perceive it and it takes an immense amount of intellectual energy on her part to dumb herself down enough for those she interacts with to understand her. Dale almost instantly falls for her, seeing a sort of kindred spirit (also because this is television and we need to compress our stories as much as possible). 

The two are able to communicate at the same level, as Dale feels that he too has to always condescend to everybody around him. Since this extradimensional entity is only appearing human, it's just as likely that she's as condescending to Dale as he is to everybody else.

I imagined her being just awestruck at the sight of The Ship. Naturally it's nowhere near as impressive as the things from her spacetime, but as she explains:

XD:
So this is it, huh? Doesn't look like much from down here. And look at you! It's very interesting being in the presence of the species that will eventually go on to become the dominant race in the universe. The things you'll achieve and accomplish will make thing overhead pale in comparison. It's just junk, a broken toy discarded by an absent-minded child-race. But, every great saga has a first page, and no matter how humble it is, it's always interesting to see where the story starts and follow it to its epic conclusion.

DALE:
Us? Really? Humans spreading out not just to all corners of our galaxy, but out into the universe as well? That's amazing.

XD:
Well, not you as you are now, no. Your present forms and intelligence capacities are by far too rudimentary and frail. A billion of your Earth years will pass before the the descendants of your descendants will spread out to every star in the heavens. It's interesting to see your kind, preserved as a sort of evolutionary larval stage.

TIM:
Did she really just say 'of your Earth years'?

XD:
You as you are now are as far removed from those beings that will one day conquer the universe as you now are from stromatolites.

TIM:
What the hell is a stromatolite?

DALE:
Very primitive life form, quite possibly the O.G. Still around, basically unchanged from their forms of a billion years ago. Have you ever even watched the damn National Geographic Channel?

TIM:
Yeah man, I'm all about that show where people who deserve it sob about how they ended up in foreign jails, I laugh and laugh every time it's on.

Anyhow, Dale falls in love with the XD (or thinks he does) and faces a gutwrenching decision to kill her once their hideout is set upon by the antibody-zombies seeking to purge her as an effect spawned in by The Ship's reality-distorting engines. I want this story to be significant as it not only shows Dale as being more than just the comic relief loose-screw crackpot he starts off as in early episodes, but as a completely broken man, trying his hardest to cope with the tragedy of being stuck on the Inside without anybody to relate to or even love. When he finds this person, he has to destroy her as she's the cause of the seemingly nonstop attacks by the antibody force. This shatters him, having lasting continuity-effects. Part of Dale's backstory is that a girl he liked a lot and dated casually but never had the guts to kiss ended up being shanghaied by The Ship and he took it hard, as us nerds who have girls that <i>never return our phone calls</i> tend.

This is also a narrative point where Dale figures out the nature of the zombies (a thing he puzzles over for the first few episodes) and gets it mostly right. From this point on, the zombies stop being seen as less a threat than as a non-antagonistic force of nature and eventually they mature as full-on allies.

Second: 
I was in-and-out of the car all night tonight and missed much of Coast To Coast (honestly, does anybody out there not understand that C2CAM is where I get the germ for many of my ideas?), but what I did catch was the guest speaker discussing how hauntings, Old Hag, alien abductions, night terrors, lucid dreaming/sleep paralysis and bigfoot may all be tied to the same kind of psychological phenomenon but are all interpreted differently by different experiencers and will be every bit as ""real"" to them as it is to another experiencer who perceives what he experienced in a completely different manner.

This got me thinking about haunted house stories. I thought it'd be an interesting twist if the house itself were the ghost or alien or succubus or night terror and it is perceived differently by the characters as they explore it. Rooms are constantly shifting, the house's style changes from observer to observer, the layout has no consistency as does its physical location within the city.

Just kind of stream-of-consciousness making this up as I type, I imagine the story starting off with Our Heroes trying to ditch a Cultist police patrol and winding up in a house that one of them swears to God was a vacant lot last week.

From there, Alison tries to explain the above thesis and everybody else tries to puzzle out the nature of the house, battling with their own internal demons which manifest themselves within the house.

"event","Hey I think I'm done acting crazy and being all down on myself.

Good times with medication. I keep on forgetting how much better I feel when I'm on speed than when I'm drunk and morose.

Anyhow, back to bullshit about writing.

Syfy (sigh) runs The Twilight Zone at 1am. Tonight they played ""The Lonely,"" a beautiful, heartbreaking piece about a man named Corry wrongfully convicted of murder and sentenced to fifty years solitary on an asteroid. When we meet him, he's spent four and a half years on the rock and he's slowly descending into madness brought on by his crushing desperation and lonliness.

Gee I can't say I know why this episode speaks to me or anything.

When out of the blue the captain of the rocketship that does a quarterly supply drop leaves with Corry a crate containing a gynoid named Alicia. Corry is at first offput by the machine, but as time passes he learns to accept her and appreciate her company, eventually coming to love her.

Another year passes and the rocketship returns, its captain bringing good news, Corry's been pardoned and he's to return home a free man. Only he has to leave Alicia behind.

Now, this is a great story, but it's crippled by the half-hour television format. The budding relationship between Corry and Alicia is only glossed over in a montage and the third act takes up barely two minutes of screentime. Instead of Corry anguishing over whether or not he's finally found happiness in his prison with his no-hot-like-'60s-hot (well, 1958) robot girlfriend and having to be convinced that he's fit to return to Earth society in what could have been a tense, gripping sequence in which Corry comes to terms with his place in the world and decides to stay - instead the rocket captain simply shoots Alicia in head, revealing her to be nothing more than a bundle of wires in the shape of a pretty girl.

It was a good story by one of my literary idols, Rod Serling himself, an early Zone (seventh episode of the first season), so it was a bit rough around the edges and not as polished as later episodes such as ""The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street"" and Richard Matheson's ""The Invaders"" (my two all-time favorite pieces of television-as-art) but ""The Lonely"" as a story seems to run contrary to Serling's own philosophy on writing.

Rod Serling has stated that all good stories start with a good ending then work their way backwards. You don't need an ironic twist, or a twist at all, just a good ending, a memorable way to end the story, as it's the only thing most people will really ever remember. Everybody remembers that To Serve Man was a cookbook, everybody knows that the self-absorbed asshole's glasses break in ""Time Enough At Last"" but who remembers the rest of the story?

""The Lonely"" however is an inversion of this thesis, we have a great long first act, a short second act that's mostly a montage and a scant third act with no real twist and no denounment to speak of. The ending is nowhere near as memorable as the setup and rising action, the first act really makes the episode and then it just sort of faceplants off a cliff.

That said, I really love the episode, I just wish that it weren't a half-hour teleplay. As an hour-long format, we'd have had a lot more screentime to explore the relationship that Corry forms with Alicia and how he eventually learns that he's home here on his little asteroid. As an hour-long episode, the story could detail how Corry couldn't adapt to life back home, haunted by Alicia's memory or completely warped by five years of solitary that he honestly cannot deal with life back home. Alas, the story is indered by the half hour format.

What this episode reminds me is that even though the people I idolize are so much better than I am, they're also not infallible. They make mistakes, they learn, they struggle and stumble. Rod Serling didn't start out writing ""The Monsters Are Due"" or ""Five Characters In Search Of an Exit"" rather, cut their teeth on stories like ""The Lonely."""

"event","In the year 201X, long after the novelty of the Las Vegas Elvis impersonator has waned and the fleeting popularity of the Michael impersonater went floppy like the fourth hour of a Viagra-induced priapism, did the city need a new celebrity to latch onto and appreciate ironically.

And thus was born the Lounge Lemmy. The Mayor of Drinkin' Island, still alive into his seventies, rocking faces and banging jailbait backstage found himself reborn in the guise of lounge singers crooning out Motorhead hits in dive bars, strip clubs and the Fremont Street Experience Remembers The Eighties.

The success of the Lounge Lemmy led to some not-so-successful imitators of the impersonators, the Dive Bar Diamond Dave soon followed and fizzled but the Jukebox James Hetfield worked fairly well, but ended up being segregated to pirate-themed bars and fish and chips joints in Norftown. Seaside Sebastian Bach crooned out a few gigs consiting mainly of misremembered lyrics to ""Eighteen And Life"" on Lake Mead but ended up getting into a fatal knife fight with an Axl Rose impersonator who as fate later revealed turned out to not be an impersonator but the real Guns 'n' Roses frontman.

Long Live The Mayor!

If anybody gives a shit, here's the .doc file of what I've been doing:

<a href=""http://zeroesunlimited.com/trainwreck/AEON_BABEL_08-24-09.doc"">AEON_BABEL_08-24-09.doc</a>

I'm at 96 pages so far, acts one and two are mostly complete, now it's time for the third act climax and resolution bullshit.

Writing action scenes is pretty easy, they tend to flow from my fingertips a lot more smoothly than dialog, as evident by these godawful Livejournal posts where I feel as I'm talking down to you, holding back my words, trying so very hard to just write as someone would speak instead of just putting words down. The last few entries where I basically gushed about my favorite films were done with a lot of Dutch Courage. Love dat gin.

Anyway, I've discovered that I'm kind of crappy at writing actual setup-punchline jokes, but feel that most of the dialog in this thing should be read like the totally deadpan exchanges in Ghostbusters, in which the characters know they're saying something ridiculous, but to them it's serious business, resulting in some of the funniest exchanges in cinema history, for example:

PETER:
Egon, this is like that time you tried to drill a hole in your head. Remember that?
EGON:
That would've worked if you hadn't stopped me.

That's sort of the vibe I'm going for here and don't know exactly if I'm pulling it off. Time will tell, I suppose. I'll just be glad to be done with this and stop writing a finger-quotes ""comedy"" and be on to the WAR IS SERIOUS WW2 story that's been buzzing around in my head."

I got another two pages of Aeon Babel out. I really should stop putting movies on in the background and absently looking up to them every so often.

Tonight, following my trend of ""watch all of Cameron's films chronologically"" that I've for some reason set instead of actually working on this thing, I noticed one of the ""little things"" that I do so adore about his films and gushed all over in the previous entry like a staked vampire bleeding out in its coffin:

Toward the beginning of the film, the focus character Bud gets angry at his soon-to-be ex-wife Lindsay and throws his wedding ring in the chemical toilet. He has a change of heart and fishes the ring out, staining his hands blue in the process.

Throughout the whole movie, Bud's hand remains blue, even after three scenes where he's swimming underwater, hands very clearly exposed to the sea. In the sequence where he's reviving the intentionally-drowned Lindsay, you can still see the blue residue from the chemical toilet around his fingernails and the creases in his knuckles.

That's devotion to detail, one of the dumb ridiculous little things that most people would overlook. Hell, that was just <i>one</i> dumb little thing to overlook out of <i>thousands</i> of dumb little things in the movie.

Outstanding work. I honestly cannot wait for Avatar.

"event","Writing about giant robots smashing Las Vegas has got me in the mood to reflect on Godzilla a bit.

<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEEXydQc9KE"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEEXydQc9KE</a>
I don't know how to feel about this clip. At first, HOLY SHIT IS THAT EVER FUCKING AWESOME!?  J.J. ""The Good Parts Aren't Original And The Original Parts Aren't Good"" Abrams likely feebly clawed for this sort of feel when he made Cloverfield. But at second glance... CGI Godzilla? We went that route once, it was awful. So I'm torn between my ideals and my cynicism, like never knowing who to root for or against when a cop tasers a hippie.

--
The above though is pretty hypocritical when viewed alongside this:
<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOISbaA2G18"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOISbaA2G18</a>
In which sweet rubber suit Godzilla soundly trounces the choppily-animated rejoinder to Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich's 1998 take on Godzilla in a one-blow fight that takes up all of 00:45 of screentime. This was basically a statement made by the producers that ""Godzilla will always be a dude in a suit."" Then of course, he's shown in the link above as being full on CGI. I feel betrayed.

--
While my formative years were spent watching and re-watching VHS copies of the Showa-era tokusatsu/kaiju* movies until the tapes stretched and we got that distorted stagger effect on the top eighth of the screen, I'll always have a soft spot in my heart for the Showa-era, despite how ridiculous the films got toward the end. That said; I do so adore the Millennium series, starting with Godzilla 2000:

<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK8GVlkl9tY"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK8GVlkl9tY</a>
I loved the redesign. Godzilla basically looked the same from around 1964**-1995***, despite the Heisei-era's ""dark and edgy like an obsidian knife"" reboot to the franchise (beating Christopher Nolan to the punch by over two decades), Godzilla's design stayed basically the same as it had since ""vs. Mothra."" There was a gradual sleekening of the Godzilla suit over the span of the Heisei films, leading us to the finalized design for the Millennium series.

With Millennium, Godzilla began to look more like a giant bipedal lizardmonster and less like a guy in a rubber lizard suit. The lines were sleekened, his snout was made a bit pointier, his spikes had a more organic stegosaurian aesthetic, his skin looked more like the pebbled texture of a crocodilian's and his posture looked more ""correct."" Millennium Godzilla didn't stand erect, dragging his tail behind him, rather stood with tail and torso in more-or-less a straight line, tail acting as a counterbalance to his body's extreme bulk. Millennium Godzilla looked more ""real"" than his Heisei and Showa counterparts and this verisimilitude made him actually scary. 

Well, as scary as a duder in a rubber suit bonking foam rubber buildings and stomping on RC tanks can be, but that's the fun of tokusatsu as an artform.

Godzilla 2000's ending was hysterical. Dipshits on TVTropes would say it was [narm], but I think it basically encapsulates everything that's right with Godzilla as a franchise. So over the top that it looks down on the top from its secret base on the moon. That classic exchange at the end just seals it for me.
""Then why, Why does he keep protecting us. Why didn't he kill us?""
""Maybe because... Godzilla is inside each one of us...""
(stomp stomp breath breath)

Godzilla's death in ""vs. Destroyah."" It's okay to cry. Everybody cries when they see this. It's like Kamina dying but cranked up to ten thousand. The way Big G goes out at the end with the most pitiful mewling instead of his trademark triumphant roar is heartbreaking, it's like that final whimper your beloved family pet wheezes out its terminal breath at the veternarian's office. When Big G went down in 1984/The Return he bellowed, he let us know that as he sunk into the firey magma of Mount Fuji, that he'd be back, and there'd be a whirlwind to reap. But as he went in ""vs. Destroyah,"" we're reassured and relieved that this is the last we'd ever see of him, that he finally went and with him, went an era. ""vs. Destroyah"" was the last of the Heisei-era films. 

We had a five year break until Godzilla 2000**** when the big rubber monster was reborn as a tongue-in-cheek revival, keeping the good, throwing out the bad, returning to the humor of the Showa-era but leaving the camp with the Coleman stove in the garage.

Here's to another fifty years of a guy in a rubber lizard suit stomping on radio controlled tanks while another guy in a rubber pterodactyl costume sprays fire extinguisher foam out its mouth at him*****.



* I really hate being <i>that guy.</i> You know, the dipshit Japanophile douchefag who insists on calling things by their Japanese terms than by an English equivalent. I loathe how there's a distinction between ""anime/manga"" and ""cartoons/comics."" They're the same fucking thing. But the term <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokusatsu"">""Tokusatsu""</a> doesn't have a hard-and-fast English transliteration. It's like another favorite loanword of mine - schadenfreude. So forgive me if I come across like a dipshit Japanophile douchefag when I use and abuse the term.

** Godzilla vs. Mothra is where his look seemed to stop evolving, the four films before appeared to have new, and redesigned costumes in each, but I'm more an dabbling enthusiast than any sort of serious Godzilla historian.

*** 1995's ""Vs. Destroyah"" was the last of he Heisei-era films, leading to 1998's lukewarm Devlin/Emmerich film.

**** See above. Most of us have stricken the 1998 film from our personal canons.

I've been writing hell of crazy on Aeon Babel this last week. I'm up to having added a good thirty pages to the original manuscript. However I'm in that boring godawful second act slump. I really, honestly hate writing second acts. It's said that American writers love second acts and tend to neglect the third. I tend to make my first acts go on for about fifty pages too long, neglect the second act as pointless busywork to get us to the third act payoff.

As it stands, yes I seriously wrote fifteen pages on Rick and Tristan in a damned flight simulator. Why aren't there more mecha anime feature films? It just feels like I'm writing a feature at the same lethargic pace as an OAV or 12-episode mini series, my pacing is just all off kilter.

I basically have a month to pound out this Devil Cars thing we'd talked about for LIKE FIVE YEARS NOW IT SEEMS for the screenwriting competition I posted about a few entries back in my history.

I spent about two hours tonight... And got one page of prewriting. Herp derp duh. I'm so bummed that I lost a bunch of previous work I'd done on the piece. I really especially loathe it when I come up with something clever and original and then lose it, forcing me to try and dig it up again and reconstruct a very pale imitation of the original creature, much like dinosaur bones in a museum as opposed to the original creature.

It's all very frustrating, but I feel that I've pruned the main cast of protagonists, antagonists and protagonist support characters down to three for each faction, instead of the like five I had previously.

After spending some time in Las Vegas, I got a bit of a lay of the land. I keep forgetting that the supertacky Fremont Street Experience is hell and gone away from the new Strip, it's all the way over by the Fitzgerald's and the Stratosphere, like three miles from the Neostrip.

Regardless, I need to write a sequence where a Devil Car is rampaging through that accursed M&M's store. Fuck that place, fuck it in the buttery soft asshole. If I were to distill what I hate about Las Vegas into 2400 square feet, it'd be that fucking soulsore.

"event","Just on the border of my waking mind there lied another time when darkness and light were one. I treaded the halls of sanity, I felt so glad to be unable to go beyond.

Then I watched Twilight again (you heard me). It made me come to a few stark realizations.
Well hell guys, watch it yourself and then we'll discuss. Go ahead. Oh hell here's a <a href=""http://www.poetv.com/video.php?vid=58895"">link for you.</a> It's eleven minutes, it won't kill you, you big burly strapping manny-man-man men. 

So, what the hell, women? Is this what passes for a panties-moistening cultural phenomenon these days? If so, then my respect for you as a gender has crashed through the floor, set back by a good eighty to ninety percent. No amount of enlightened video rebuttals from <a href=""http://www.poetv.com/tags.php?k-sarah%20haskins-32554-.html="">Sarah Haskins</a> can make me retain the level of respect I had prior. 

And they've made me think about swearing off of women. I don't want to look at or touch one ever again. Just basically fuck women. Not in the literal sense of course - because they're dead, beneath notice... Instead of being respectful and attempting to treat them with the same level of respect I give others that I've previously assumed to be of equal or similar intellectual footing, rather instead to treat them with the same disinterested disdain as I would a small child that doesn't know better or an inbred show-quality dog.

But wait... are those voices crying out in the darkness? Not all women fall for the line of bullshit antifeminist propaganda spewed by the Stephanie Meyer multimedia juggernaut machine? Tinny distant voices peeping like baby chicks in a nest. ""But we don't all feel that way! It's the same folly as perpetrated by a High School disciplinarian to dismiss or punish the body whole thanks to the actions of a minority!"" 

Being an enlightened, liberal-minded populist, I realize that to dismiss an entire gender based upon the harpy-like trills of a vocal minority is fundamentally opposed to my very system of ideals, so I let the gears turn a bit and actually sit and think this out.

Is what we're seeing with the Cult of Twilight exactly what it says on the tin: women in general reducing themselves to incoherent, irrational beings obsessed with that which the media tells them to obsess - this behavior is so repellant to my ideals, thus forcing me to finally stop straddling the fence on this whole ""hetero vs. homo"" debate and jangle my spurs full time in Rob Halford's tent... or is it something far more sinister?

The crankjob conspiracy theorist Yang to my idealist Yin pokes its fanged maw out from under the bridge where it likes to sleep and grumbles a thesis:

""Look, asshole"" it snarls. ""You saw this before. Remember Interview With the Vampire? Yeah that movie in which Brad Pitt and Antonio Banderas totally made kissyfaces at Tom Cruise and got you seriously considering the gay lifestyle? Filled your head with the false expectations that if only the rest of gay life were as ab-fab as this, then you'd be totally in? It's that all over again."" The cranky conspiracy theorist side of the anthropomorphized Janus sculpture representation of my intellect thus shuffles back under its bridge, unscrews the tin lid from a bottle of bottom-shelf rum and can be heard guzzling deep drafts, muttering about black helicopters the whole while.

And he's right. Basically Twilight tries that gambit again. Typically vampire movies are dismissed as mere chick flick romantic wish-fulfillment fantasies. Whereas Interview was a big giant full-motion LED matrix billboard glowing in the darkness alongside your otherwise featurelessly straight freeway trying to sell you on the Gay Lifestyle - Twilight takes the opposite route: Rather than enticing you to the Gay Side, it attempts to repel you from the Straight Side.

And this is a real quandary for those of us that range between 2 and 6 on the Kinsey scale. Interview didn't convince us fully to ascend that latter to 7 Kinsey, which in the eyes of the gay recruiters is nothing short than a massive failure. A decade later and they tried again with the same tactic and thus Twilight was released to theaters in a further attempt to woo us undecideds.

A stiff and solid manly and secure 1K isn't going to be swayed by the movie's depiction of women, while those traipsing in the minefield between ""WAY STRAIGHT DON'T LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT"" and  a 7K ""TOM'S MAN"" may find themselves utterly repelled by women, repulsed by the way they're so completely unilaterally attracted to a man that is completely dismissive of her, unless he's watching her when she sleeps, licking his chops with the same desire as you or I would when encountered with a cherry cheesecake. 

When he's not thinking about her as a food item he's abusive, battering her to the point of broken bones and required surgery-intensive and yet still she swoons! She forgoes a guy that really truly does love her and is incredibly compatible with her [i]and she concedes the point, agreeing that they're perfect for one another[/i] only to return to the abusive monsterman who is only interested in her the same way we're interested in bacon cheeseburgers.

This behavior was engineered, plotted and distilled to turn us fence-sitters completely off of women forever. Well played, gay mafia. Well played indeed. You've taken my knight and placed me into check.

Maybe instead of turning totally gay, I'll simply treat women as fuck/food objects, as it's apparent that's how they want to be treated. The way women behave over Twilight has made me reevaluate my attractedness to you, my populist pro-feminist, equalitist ideals and may have decided that I'm not Way Gay yet, but a few steps closer.

If this was your intention, bravo! You brought me here but can you take me back again?"

"event","<a href=""http://www.nevadafilm.com/screenwriters.php"">The ""Nevada"" Film Office is holding a screenwriting contest.</a>
I put ""Nevada"" in scary quotation marks because of the widly-held conception that Las Vegas is the state despite occupying less than one percent of its entire area. Basically the script contest is to write a feature film length commercial for the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority.

Anyway, some time back we came up with the idea to do a story about monster hot rods. The basic idea was for me to write it about Las Vegas (mainly because I hate the place and want to see people there die in a horribly hilarious manner) anyway. Sooo...

Due date August 1. 90-130 pages.

Fucking easy."

I wrote some 20+ pages on Aeon Babel between last night and a few hours today, cleared up some continuity and changed Tristan's character from a hostile cocksnot toward Rick to more of a Kamina-like mentor. I still need to write the ""party scene"" where Tristan bestows upon Rick some sage advice on the nature of manhood, before going out and deflating Rick's ego by totally banging Satsuki, the thinly-veiled Rei clone (of which I have dozens of tubes in my basement, all full of gloshy orange fluid and naked little doll-like clones. I think many are dead, but that's beside the point).

See, the joke here is that the Dragons are actually a manifestation of Rick's sexual frustration, and it's Tristan's part in the ridiculously-complicated-and-stupid ""The Project"" to act as his mentor, to build Rick up, then knock him down again, amplifying and maximizing his despair and frustration.

This is all done ""For Some Reason"" not at all unlike the actions of the clock guy in the last couple of episodes of Torchwood's first season.

Fun fact! She had the naughty bits airbrushed out of her totally-hip tattoo before arrival at the Oscar Stadium. Apparently, according to 4chan who just <i>loves</i> that woman to itty bitty pieces, her tattoo informed the world that she belonged to a pimp named ""John."" 

Awesome, huh!

I can't wait to be a piece of shit hipster that wins a gilded statue of a naked man based upon a movie I'll write based on the following guide!

<lj-cut text=""Click to read the helpful guide: 'How To Make an Indie Comedy'."">
<blockquote>How to Make an Indie Comedy.

They've sweeped the box office for a tiny budget and sapped the allowance money for kids ages 11-18 nationwide, and now you too can learn the secrets of this new exciting form of filmmaking, For I the OP, am here to teach you all you need to know in regards to how to make indie comedy.

The Script
All films start as words on a page, and as an indie screenwriter, you must make sure that every word on every page of your soon-to-be movie will induce an immense groan in every person who reads or hears it who has not experienced a full frontal lobotomy. 
Being careful with your dialogue is essential here, so make sure you follow all the rules of thumb.

First, you need to master the far-from-subtle art of ""Slanguage"". Each and every character that matters must be under the age of twenty-five and over the age of thirteen, as such, they must use ""hip"" and ""cool"" slang that no one on the fucking planet actually uses in speech. It must also be filled with half-assed pop-culture references, lengthy discussions about indie bands, and Invader Zim-style ""lol XD so randum"" humor. Despite the fact that you are guaranteed to hear the word ""fuck"" in exorbitant amounts should you venture onto any public schoolyard in America today, your characters must abstain from swearing at every turn. But don't think that you need everyone to talk like the Mormon kid you remember from Junior High. Oh no, in fact, even your substitute swears must be shit that no actual human being uses in speech. Take a tip from Diablo Cody. Instead of having her characters say ""Honest to God"" which could offend some, or ""Honest to gosh"" which is far too realistic (marginally realistic is still too realistic, bear that in mind), she uses the wonderful line ""Honest to blog"". Now isn't that great? How many people have you heard say that? None? Well, that's the beauty of it.

The basic premise of your movie can be meandering and aimless, or painfully formulaic. No other patterns will be accepted. Make sure that whatever resolution you awkwardly slap on is over-the-top sappy and tries FAR too hard at being heartwarming. Your audience is full of vapid cunts, so you must play to the only two emotions they know: ""lol"" and ""awww"".

Don't forget to slip some jokes in there at the beginning, indie films are a visual medium, so be sure to write in visual gags like Garden State's ""wallpaper shirt"" and ""gas pump handle"". Visual gags are beautiful in that they can make moments in which the only sounds in the theater playing your film are the simultaneous guffaws of the audience, with no other audio interference.

Visual Scheme 
Speaking of visuals, remember that indie films need to share an identical art and visual style. Napoleon Dynamite and Juno are your best friends in this department as they practically bleed indie imagery (which you must call ""indimagery"" from now on, portmanteaus are your fuckbuddies now). Title cards and credits have to use a font that resembles what you used to draw in the margins of your composition books when you were in eighth grade, and you must have shots of bad drawings made to look like a fourteen-year-old drew them with a half-inch long no. 2 pencil.

Acting 
Since your shitty movie is actually going to go nowhere, your best bet of producing anything out of your shitty script is making the movie yourself and having your friends act for you. You're probably going to want to find your one friend who can sort of act, and have them play the singular lead role. Rewrite your script to give them the most screentime, and rename the movie to just be the name of their character. You need to keep all eyes on the one semi-decent actor, at all costs. Fuck everyone else. If you just so happen to be the best actor in your circle of friends, make like Zach Braff and and make sure to pump up your ego before diving in.

Your star has one job that's more important than any other. One arbitrary line of theirs has to be delivered with more emphasis and focus than any other. It could be a shitty one-line joke or semi-ironic quasi-joke, but your lead has to say SOMETHING that will eventually be your movie's key phrase to be printed on future T-shirts (that's hoping you get a distributing and subsequent merchandising deal). Make sure whoever your star is can not only SELL this line, but WHORE it out on the streets.

Psyching Yourself 
If you're going to be making an indie comedy, you need to transform yourself into the indiefuck you've always wanted to be. Go to your local Starbuck's or Freudian Sip on the campus of the closest college in your town, bring your MacBook and don't leave until you've gained something that could aid your effort. Take notes on how the denizens of whatever coffee house you're using dress and talk and act. After that it's just imitate them as best as you can. Then, slip on your hoodie and Elvis Costello glasses, grease up a faux-hawk on your head, shove a stick up your ass, and get cracking on your movie.</blockquote>

"event","It's come to my attention that I've been ""friended"" by a teenaged Floridian Torchwood fan.

Are we <i>ever</i> going to be bestest of friends! Are you cute? Florida is Floridawesome. I want to pay a visit so I can shoot at alligators. Either them or nutria, which I hear are more comical than jackrabbits. Can I shoot from one of those fan-backed swamp-skiffs? If not, ha ha, you Florida rednecks might have saucy bikini beach babes, but us Nevada rednecks can spotlight jackrabbits (but not shoot at them from a vehicle because that would be <i>illegal</i> and we would never, ever do anything that even comes near the hem of skirting the law.)

For those of you keeping score, CSI: Miami <i>rules</i> and Torchwood is <i>godawful</i>, just in case the home audience missed the last ticker crawl that tends to speed along the bottom edge of the screen at such a lightning pace with which many of the quasi-literate viewers plonked down on their Barcoloungers have difficulty keeping pace.

Godspeed <lj user=""Undersea"">, welcome to the club. Stay awhile, <i>stay forever.</i>

IN OTHER EARTHSHATTERING NEWS:

I haven't written paragraph one on Aeon Babel - The Genesis Saga in almost two weeks. I'm feeling very ashamed of myself, but I'm having a difficult time with the jokes. RIFFING ON ANIME CULTURE - GIANT MECHA ANIME IN GENERAL IS DIFFICULT !!!! >____<;; Maybe I should make an /m/ thread? Comedy - that's hard! But Tragedy - man, that's funny.

The worst part is, I lump my rucksack, laptop within to work every day, drop it on the tech bench and not do anything with it, despite the hours and hours of soul-crushing downtime with which I'm saddled.

I did however think that it'd be dang hilarious if I were to arbitrarily throw in eyecatches and a two-minute ""recap episode"" somewhere toward the end of the second act, about which my Greek Chorus (two maintenance techs named Oscar and Ray) comment.

Maybe I'd be better off just writing a bunch of scenes that riff on M-Anime tropes and then find some way to stitch them together in a cohesive narrative. That's how Hot Shots! did it, right?

"event","An idea, a brilliant idea has formed in our heads and we have, no we <i>need</i> to write it down.

As the six of you who read this page realize, I've long been in collaboration with my brainstorming buddy Richie (aka Colonel Craud, aka Toadpole). Earlier today, we stumbled on a goddamned gold mine, a veritable Motherlode of brilliance. If you'll take the shit to care and read beyond the cut, you can see our work (because IM conversations <i>are unique content</i>)

It basically boils down to this:
The <i>_____ Movie</i>s suck balls. They're godawful and you're a complete cockshot for watching them. If you're the kind of asshole who <i>pays money</i> to go see these movies, please, for the love of God kill yourself now. If you have children, drown them first, sterilize your spouse then kill yourself lest your genes be allowed into the pool.

Yeah, I saw Epic Movie in the theatre, but I paid for Night at the Museum. I told the cutie behind the ticket counter to not sell me a ticket to Epic Movie, that I would pay to get in to see something else, but I was going to see Epic Movie, those fuckers were not getting a goddamned penny out of me. 

The girl just rolled her eyes and punched out a ticket for Epic Movie, to which I threw a rather extravagant hissy, <i>forcing her</i> to refund the ticket and sell me one to Night at the Museum (which was still playing at the time at the Northgate 10 cinemas in Carson City). So, not only did Epic Movie not get any of my goddamned money, but I technically lost money for the film. Swish, two points <i>nothin' but net, on fire</i> etc.

Where was I? Okay anyway, pursuant to my ""I Love You The Asylum, Can I Be Your Awesome-O"" post from last week, I think I've found the most brilliant way to get a movie made. 

Dig if you will, <i>NOT FUNNY</i>. A deconstruction of the <i>____ Movie</i> franchise except actually funny and competent for maximum irony.

The plot, as thin as it is features two idealized self-inserts in an empty theatre watching <i>INEPT PARODY MOVIE VIII: GREET THE EPIC SCARY HOBBITS</i>. They throw shit at the screen (literal feces) and proclaim that they could do better.

Thus begins their quest to do better. Naturally, these characters are forgotten about as the movie progresses.

The movie is a series of three to five minute shorts (approximately twenty of them) that follow the same path as my Awesome-O post: Simply making a deconstruction based upon the IMDB and Wikipedia synopses of the huge blockbuster movies that will be released in 2008 and 2009, boil them down to a short recurring sketch featuring a cast of seven or so actors who switch roles (like the Flying Circus). Each sketch is tenuously-connected to the last - for instance - a character from Rasp could walk across the street and tip his hat to the character from Budgie who continues across the street, starting her story (again like the Flying Circus).

<i>NOT FUNNY</i> will contain a Greek Chorus, which imagine being two assholes liveblogging the experience to 4chan, posting ridiculous memes and generally deconstructing the movie as it goes.

Given that The Asylum (with whom I'm in love) bankrolls small movies to the tune of $.5M, easily recouping that loss in the rental sales market, thus guaranteeing a profit stream, were I to write this film, put together a business plan and budget for it, contact the local agencies and find out what it would cost to set up a soundstage.

Given my propensity, my predilection toward doing things on the under side, the black market side, on the <i>delta lima</i> as we like to say, I'm certain I could steal, scrounge and scam the appropriate equipment I'd need to make this film for rock bottom, and at the same time actually have it be, you know, <i>good</i>.

I have the tools, I have the talent. I'm going to <i>Git-R-Done</i>.

OH YEAH WHILE WE'RE AT IT, PUTTIN' AEON BABEL ON THE BACKBURNER BECAUSE <i>NOT FUNNY</i> IS A PROFITABLE IDEA THAT WOULD BE EASIER TO WRITE AND HAVE FINANCIAL BACKING PROVIDED.

Something tells me that I'll be consumed by another wacky and retarded idea by next week and forget completely about <i>this one</i> too. But that's how I roll, I assume any day now, I'll approach a Creative Singularity where my awesome ideas come at a rate that is by far too rapid for me to contend, likely causing my head to explode like in the hit film Scanners which is being re-fucking-made for a 2008 release.

tome of finland: ""ha ha you fucking retards will watch anything!""
tome of finland: ""this piece of shit is going to be Number One in America this weekend!""
comissar craud: Or it's a cathartic sequence in the which the audience rise up from their seats and destroy the screen
tome of finland: ""Tell your friends that you're a collossal fucking moron and deserve to be euthanized!""
tome of finland: ""Total bonus points if one of them actually does it""
comissar craud: Actually, it should keep cutting back to two guys in the audience, who function like a Greek Chorus and comment on how unfunny everything is. Then at the end the camera pans slightly to a big button called ""DESTRUCT"" and one of them says ""Hey, what do you reckon this does?"". Then they press it and the screen explodes, and it cuts to the audience cheering
tome of finland: excellent
tome of finland: Live Action Statler and Waldorf
comissar craud: Totally
tome of finland: except they're not old, but twentysomething hipsters
tome of finland: the whole time, they're posting liveblog commentary to 4chan
comissar craud: It ends on a cliffhanger where they leave the burning theatre and say ""What do we watch now?"", then the door immediately in front of them reads ALIEN VS. PREDATOR 3, so they turn direct to camera and scream

tome of finland: yes!
tome of finland: ""special guest director""
comissar craud: DIRECTED BY UWE BOLL AND ALAN SMITHEE
comissar craud: It occasionally cuts back to us being told to make it less funny, and we're holding pennants with ""COMPROMISE"" written on them
tome of finland: it could be a series of Flying Circus sketches that are connected only by the most tenuous of threads
comissar craud: Yes
tome of finland: intercut with our discussions with The Studio
comissar craud: It cuts from the movie to the guys in the audience, then they say ""God, imagine the kind of people who made this shit"" and it cuts to the sequences of us, then we say ""God, imagine how awful this will be"" and it cuts back to the movie
comissar craud: In this constant cycle
tome of finland: it should start off with us (our self-inserts, at least) watching Incompetent Parody Movie and throwing shit at the screen
tome of finland: (literal feces)
comissar craud: This is going to be awesome
comissar craud: We just need those idiots to crank out Meet The Hobbits or something in the mean time
tome of finland: and the best part: it could be made with a The Asylum budget
comissar craud: Yes
tome of finland: 500K?
tome of finland: easy shit
comissar craud: Especially if the same people play multiple parts
comissar craud: And it's all done in the one studio somewhere
tome of finland: or on location
tome of finland: studio would be hard
comissar craud: We could rent out one of those storage hangers
comissar craud: And film it in that
tome of finland: those are expensive
tome of finland: on the plus side though
tome of finland: I know lots of local actors and models
comissar craud: I don't know, I knew some guys in a band who rented out one to practise in because it was cheaper than a rehearsal room
tome of finland: I can look into it

comissar craud: It could
tome of finland: it's not at all impossible to actually make it better than Epic and Spartans
tome of finland: production values wise (they did have some expensive makeup effects)

tome of finland: the best part is, I could easily just write an unfunny sketch based on any movie coming out in the next two years (just like I did in my Awesome-O post) and once we get ten or twenty of them, we could turn them into punchy little sketches
comissar craud: I love it
tome of finland: that are held together by meagre threads (a character from one crosses paths with a character from another, tips his hat and keeps walking)

tome of finland: oh I love you, netsol
tome of finland: the best part is, I have a contact (through my social network) from one of the big porn sites (kink.com, it's fucking huge, probably bigger than FTV), he's a former camera operator. I'm certain I could ply him to come over and be the DP
tome of finland: (not double pen)
comissar craud: Excellent
tome of finland: I like, know what I'm doing behind a camera, I'm just rusty
comissar craud: Yeah
tome of finland: I have the hardware to edit the movie, I have the software to do it (archaic versions of Avid and After Effects, it's all I really need) and were I given several hundred thousand to make the movie, I'll have the time
tome of finland: because I could easily take a leave from work for a month or so to work on it
tome of finland: since the technology to make a film is so fucking inexpensive now (HD cameras are like 2K, HD dubbing decks are 1K), it's not altogether impossible that I could spend less than 10K on material costs, pump the rest into actually making the movie, paying the talent peanuts
tome of finland: one of the benefits of having a cast of like seven dudes and dudesses
comissar craud: Yes
tome of finland: ""we'll pay you ten grand for eight weeks""
tome of finland: let's do it
tome of finland: god damn it, let's DO IT
comissar craud: Yatta!
tome of finland: fucking A
comissar craud: Throw in a Bar-B-Q parody somewhere just to confuse people
comissar craud: ""...Oh yeah, that movie. Har har!""
tome of finland: Donut Convention - A  Hip-Hop Sequel Featuring Rappers
comissar craud: Yes!
tome of finland: it could feature me (because i fit the build) in blackface, communicating primarily in flatulence
comissar craud: ^_^
tome of finland: and then the self-inserts could be all THE SHIT IS THIS FUCK?
comissar craud: hee hee
tome of finland: man, I'm trying to think which movies were out when Epic came out
tome of finland: because when I went to see it, I paid for something else
comissar craud: I don't get your crazy cinema system
comissar craud: Here you get the name of the movie you're seeing written on the ticket
tome of finland: how is it crazy? Movies come out on Friday, stick around for awhile
tome of finland: uh, yeah
tome of finland: I bought a ticket for a different movie and went to go see Epic
comissar craud: Oh
comissar craud: Did they not check?
tome of finland: apathy rules american cinemas
comissar craud: Awesome
tome of finland: the girl at the counter gave me a ticket for Epic, after I explained to her what I was paying for vs. what I was going to see
tome of finland: I made her, forced her to refund the ticket
comissar craud: hee hee
tome of finland: what should INEPT PARODY MOVIE VI be called?
tome of finland: subtitled, I mean
tome of finland: Dig if you will, NOT FUNNY. A deconstruction of the ____ Movie franchise except actually funny and competent for maximum irony.

The plot, as thin as it is features two idealized self-inserts watching INEPT PARODY MOVIE III: (insert witty subtitle here)
comissar craud: MEET THE HOBBITS
comissar craud: Because that could possibly coincide with the Hobbit movie Peter Jackson is making
tome of finland: how about Greet
comissar craud: MEET THE EPIC SCARY HOBBITS
tome of finland: greet
comissar craud: OK
tome of finland: aw fuck it, meet, whatever
tome of finland: it's irrelevant, because the movie is titled INEPT PARODY MOVIE VI
comissar craud: We should write in the bit where Harry Knowles has to dance before we'll give him any pages of the script
comissar craud: Dressed as a smurf
tome of finland: naturally
comissar craud: Sweating, causing all of his blue makeup to run off</blockquote>"

"event","I had a long conversation with my meatfriend Earl - with whom I should just stop showing my work, because it's apparent that he just doesn't ""get it."" He's one of these nerds that's effectively lived in a goddamned vacuum since 1997 and refuses to accept that the nerdscape has changed since we were in high school. 

Us old-guard traditionalist nerds with interests in art and music and engineering and science are a dead or dying breed, supplanted by 4chan meme-posting weaboo faggots. Waps, janks - for the uninitiated.

And we (proper nerds) loathe them.

So! I think I figured out exactly how to fix this disaster of a screenplay.
More under the cut!<lj-cut>

- The University at Stroketon is (for some reason) a West Coast Mecca for Waps. They flood the town like hippies did the Haight back in Fuck Summer 1967. The locals (again mirroring the Haight) were at first amused by the influx of retards, then eventually grew to absolutely loathe them.

- Susan, instead of being a paleofungologist (since the original movie was about killer mushrooms) is now a professor / lecturer of Pan-Asian Mythology, primarily all the fun monsters the collective culture has spawned. Since she lived and studied in Japan, she's grown to absolutely loathe waps.

- Iota, still owns the mushroom ranch (the ground is still sour, nothing but mushrooms will grow on it, so he capitalizes on this), the ranch used to be an internment camp during The War. Since the waps in town are complete retards, they confuse the words ""internment"" with ""forced labor and death,"" treating Iota's property as if it were Bergen Belsen. Scratch that, they treat it more like Jim Morrison's grave.

- I need to figure out a way though to have the petty hostility-masking-attraction that Susan feels toward Iota maintain through this small plot/details change. If both characters loathe weaboos, then that gives them something similar to hate - and as I've discovered through my varied relationships: having a mutual dislike is by far more important than having a mutual like. This is going to make the Moonlighting-style repartee I've written for the two characters more difficult to maintain. I need to find a crutch.

- Monsters still perform horrible atrocities in order to feed off of anguish. They'll commit brutal and horrifying acts of murder so that they may feed off of the sorrow of the loved ones who witness the act. Totally not Cartman licking Scott Tenorman's tears away, or anything. Actually, for the dense out there, I <i>should</i> put in a scene toward the end of the second act where one of them <i>does</i> lick away tears for sustenance.

- I figured it'd be fun if the monsters only kill off the waps, since <s>I</s> the main characters completely loathe them, making it a real question of conscience for the heroes to defeat the monsters in order to protect those they hate. For this, I imagine a scene like in Tremors where they're looking at the map, except they're looking at mugshots or newspaper obit photos or whatever. Iota makes the comment that they shouldn't do anything about the monsters, as they're killing off those he wishes he could kill anyway, but would be illegal to do so (Iota's not exactly the film's moral compass)

- The toughest part is going to be the hook, the teaser at the beginning. As the uncompleted first draft stands now, it's sixteen pages until something horrific happens. In Tremors (I mention it because A: It's one of my favorite no-budget horror movies and B: I watched it the other night and read along with the screenplay to get a taste for the pacing), nothing really happens for the first twenty pages either, it's all characterization. But that movie moves a hell of a lot faster than I'm going, because I tend to overwrite my dialog.

This is because I'm a hack, I guess.

Apparently, our buddy ""Diamond"" Dallas Page doesn't understand our delightful obsession with CSI Miami.

A licensed CSI Miami game using a head-tracking peripheral would be so amazingly great. I can imagine little games like in Trauma Center where your CSI Guys search for clues, Shoot-and-Dodge sequences as Horatio and every mission starts with a ""time the sunglasses take"" minigame.

Jesus Christ, it'd be the best video game ever made. I'd buy a Wii just to play it."

"event","I heard on the radio (on one of the K-lame shock jock morning shows that runs instead of music because I guess that way the radio stations can save money on ASCAP / BMI fees, I suppose) that there was a fuckin' Revenge of the Nerds remake in the pipe.

Well what the fuck? Why?

So, some ideas cropped into my head. Bear with me, this is very first draft and stream-of-consciousness.

Let's recap, shall we?

Our Heroes, a put-upon bunch of sad-sack losers with skills, talents, experiences and determination that by far outstrips the imaginationless, unchecked, irrational hatred of their oppressors. In the end, the Nerds get the girl(s), beat the bad guys, win the Greek Games and get their fraternity house back. Neato, I guess.

Neato if you're the kind of complete asshole who thinks that sports movies in which the heroes get better with a montage sequence only to win an athletic contest and become that which they hated - rather than overcoming, becoming greater than those who hated them, being the better person, the better human being. There is absolutely no difference, on a thematic level between Revenge of the Nerds and Rocky. Both movies are about underdogs, GUTS AND EFFORT, montage sequences and eventually overcoming the bad guy on the bad guy's terms, rather than doing the nerdish thing and actually beating the bad guys on <i>the hero's terms</i> rather than the villain's terms.

The titular Nerds in that movie were no different from the Jocks against whom they were fighting.

It's not that I dislike the movie in question, it's just that it's really no goddamned different from every other sports movie ever made. Being that it's an embodiment of the very essence of self-insertion wish-fulfillment that all nerds for some reason find immensely-appealing, the movie has enjoyed a quarter of a century of cult college comedy status, alongside such fare as Animal House, PCU and Van Wilder - all of which had to do with fucking fraternity houses.

In the words of Space Moose: <a href=""http://www.zeroesunlimited.com/spacemoose/frat%20.gif"">I can't wait to be brothers with a bunch of numbnuts who have wet dreams about their dads.</a>

So, onto the meat of this post about which nobody else will give a shit:
When I'm done writing my horror movie about those awful, awful trolls, I'll start to focus my attention on a speculation Revenge of the Nerds redux College Comedy Movie. Below is some of the original conversation that sprung from this epiphany:
<blockquote>< Tome> I had the best brainstorm ever earlier
< Tome> maybe not ever, but it was awesome
< Tome> I heard there was going to be a remake of Revenge of the Nerds
< Tome> then the gears started turning. The next Revenge of the Nerds movie should be about proper nerds, engineers, math students, linguists, artists and the like going up against the new wave of 4chan meme-spouting japanophile fags
< ddp> YES
< ddp> also ED/SA ""I'M WAY BETTER THAN YOU SNORT NEENER"" nerds
< Tome> totally
< Tome> fuck those people
< Tome> they're ruining what it means to be a nerd

< Tome> when I'm done with Zombie Nation The Movie
< ReverendRagu> they keep stealing all the decent words that useless idiots who hate themselves can use
< Tome> I imagine the Normal Nerds just staring at them with immense loathing and revulsion from across the quad
< Tome> ""I swear to God, I'm going to rip that ""I Want a Japanse Girlfriend"" t-shirt off his his scrawny chest and shove it down his throat""
< Tome> I had written in the screenwriting elljay groupthink community that if you were to try and regain the sort of Gen-X slacker appeal that Kevin Smith had, one would have to do something that appeals to the 4chan meme-posting Gen-Y hikkikomori
< ddp> and the ""oppressed straight white male"" demographic
< Tome> oh totally
< Tome> I imagine that the Jnerdz will constantly be spouting ""OPRESSION"" and ""LOL RAEP"" at every chance.
< ddp> it's not just japanophiles
< ddp> it's the same people who take the ironic jokes in Wonder Showzen as empowerment
< Tome> yeah, it's everybody involved in the SA/Maddox internet culture</blockquote>
In my fantasy world where I'm able to make the sort of movies I want to make, my Revenge of the Nerds remake will be primarily about Proper Nerds facing off against Weeaboo Fags, Furries and LARPers; the sort of abominable nerds that make being someone who's into art and language and math and science and engineering (you know, proper nerds) cringe by association.

In my movie, the Proper Nerds will be the heroes, taking on and defeating the Weeaboo Fags who have completely destroyed in the public's opinion what it means to be a nerd."

"event","And I'm still giggling. This is the best idea I've EVER HAD. Nine pages of first-drafty copypasta below the cut.
<lj-cut>
STILL VERY FIRST DRAFT. IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE WAY I ROLL WITH MY FRIST DRAFTS, THEN MAYBE WE AREN'T REALLY LIVEJOURNAL FRIENDS.<blockquote>Four tardballs weaboo faggots are sitting alone in a big open field, studded with fairy rings of mushrooms. These mushrooms are glowing faintly green. The four weaboo fags (2x P0N0S 2x VAG000) are sitting in a circle. There's an incense burner in the center, all four of them are wearing white scarves around their heads, emblazoned with the rising sun and Japanese scribbledeygook, like the sort worn by Kamikaze pilots.

	MAY:
Are you sure this is going to work?

	DAVID:
Of course it will, it has to! This place used to be an internment camp, you know, during the war. Thousands of Japanese people were rounded up here, murdered and buried in mass graves. It's in the history books.

	MAY:
Oh?

	DAVID:
Yeah, so if we have a chance at all of communing with the real live spirit, the very essence of Japaneseness, we'll be able to do it here!

	AARON:
Yeah! Aren't you excited? We're going to live our dreams and channel the spirit of the Samurai, the purest essence of Japan's culture and sophistication!

	KEYSHAWNA:
You guys really get into this, don't you?

	DAVID:
Who wouldn't? Japanese culture is the most pure and beautiful culture on Earth! Our embracing it is getting as close to purity as we possibly can.

	AARON:
Seeing as how we weren't born Japanese.

	DAVID:
Or have Japanese girlfriends.

May goes HRMF

	DAVID:
Sorry, May.

	AARON:
The moon's reaching its zenith, we should start.

David procures from his rucksack a set of long fabric scrolls adorned with images of terrifying monsters from Japanese folklore and moonman scribbledegyook calligraphs.

He unrolls them on the grass and pins the corners to the ground with a votive candle. Bonus points if they're the scented candles (yesssss) OH BETTER YET, NARUTO AND CLAMP MANGAS FROM BORDERS

	DAVID:
And now we should start the rites.

David unfolds a piece of printer paper, printed out upon which are Japanese kanji glyphs, next to them are katakana glyphs and next to them romanji. The text is oriented in vertical columns.

	KEYSHAWNA:
Are you sure you know what you're doing?

	DAVID:
I've been watching fansubbed anime for the better part of ten years, I think I have the requisite expertise with la langue japonais.

	MAY:
Oh, he speaks French too, be still my heart.

LATER:

Candlelit from below, scented votive candles atop the Naruto and Ah! My Goddess manga books. Sticks of Pocky are laid out in kanji ideograms on the scroll (naturally, obscene and obtuse)

	DAVID:
(something hilarious and naughty in Finnski) Rise, Rise noble spirit of the Samurai Warrior, so that we may commune with you and you can impart into us your very essence of Japaneseness, which is awesome, awesomer than Americanness.

	MAY:
Nani!

	AARON:
Are you sure that worked?

Aaron starts munching on Pocky.

	DAVID:
Look, I got the diagrams from the internet, there's no way this could possibly fail! And quit eating those!

David slaps the Pocky stick out of Aaron's mouth.

	DAVID:
They're vital to the process!

	KEYSHAWNA:
What about these cans of Pocari Sweat? I'm thirsty.

	MAY:
Yeah David, I'm thirsty too. Can I have a BM?

	DAVID:
No! You cannot! Those are for the ghost of the honorable samurai so he understands that we're not gaijin, but are of the same master culture as he! Truly, these delightful foods and drinks from his homeland will be enough to prove us worthy!

	AARON:
Surely!

	DAVID:
(continuing, more hilarious finnski) And with that, rise noble spirit of the samurai! Rise noble ghosts of those who were so cruelly struck down by those that hate them for having a culture that's totally better than theirs in every manner conceivable.

	AARON AND MAE:
Nippon Ichi!

	DAVID:
(Straight-faced, completely serious)
Nippon Ichi.

Keyshawn though is rolling her eyes, this is total bullshit.

Nothing happens.

	MAY:
Did it... did it work?

	AARON:
I don't know? Do you see anything?

	MAY:
No, I don't think so.
	AARON:
Do you feel anything?

	KEYSHAWN:
I'm starting to feel something.

	DAVID AND AARON (together):
Yeah?

	KEYSHAWN:
Cold. Tired. Wet. Hungry. Let's get out of here.

	DAVID:
What? What? What! We're not just up and leaving! This is our moment! The time is right, the moon is right, the air at night.

	KEYSHAWN:
Yeah okay Fernando.

	DAVID:
I told you time and again, my name is David. Or Dave-o, or Daveykins, or His Royal Daveship, if you're not into the whole brevity thing.

	KEYSHAWN:
Yeah okay, Jeff Bridges. I'm out of here.

Keyshawn stands up and brushes the wet grass and mud off of her knees.

	KEYSHAWN:
I just bought these jeans, now they're all ruined.

May gets up to chase after her.

	MAY:
Come on Keyshawn, I remember that you said that you'd come along with me to the Fantasy Anime Gamer's Club, that you said that as long as we were friends, we'd do everything together!

	KEYSHAWN:
That's right, but this is stupid. What are we doing out here, trying to raise samurai ghosts? That's ridiculous. Even for this crowd.

Wide shot, the four kids are on a small hill in the background, they're just barely specks moving around in silhouette against the moonlit nightscape.

David stands up, indignant.

	DAVID:
Hey! This is not ridiculous! This is us honoring the culture that bore us, that raised us, that educated and enlightened us! We should only be so worthy!

	KEYSHAWN:
Listen to yourself! Honoring the culture that bore you? You're from Dubuque!

As if there were some malevolent force under the ground, feeding on the hostility in the air, a slight rumble comes from the foreground, from this rumble pokes up a little mound, like a spontaneous anthill. As the yelling and back-and-forth increases, so does the size of the hill.

	AARON:
(yelling)
How dare you!

	KEYSHAWN:
(loud-voiced rebut)
How dare me? How dare you, you insignificant little idiot! Why would you pretend to be something you're not! Look, idiot, you're not Japanese, you never were Japanese and you never will be Japanese! Why don't you just look at how great you have things and not try to be what you aren't!? You're worse than those kids who pretend to be rappers! May, I'm going home. Since I have our keys, you're welcome to come with me!

As Keyshawn yells, the little anthill in the background topples over, revealing a column of pale blue-green light. Not a Luxor spotlight into the heavens, but more of a pale, light, low swamp light. That light is emitting in a ring around what appears to be a pale gray human's head, poking up out of the dirt.

May, confused looks back and forth, caught between two angry parties in a bitter conflict. David, her hard-suffering boyfriend and Keyshawn, her BFF from forever ago.

	MAY:
K-key...

	KEYSHAWN:
Oh don't you start laughing like you play Starcraft. Don't you dare!

	MAY:
I'm going to stay with David. I believe... I believe in him!

	KEYSHAWN:
Fine, whatever. Stay with him. I think you and I though, we're through.

The pallid gray head in the foreground pushes against the crevasse in the dirt, forcing its way up and out, straining against the weight of the dirt.

	KEYSHAWN:
(continuing)
Feel free to get your stuff out of my place any time.

	MAY:
Your place! I've lived there for two years!

	KEYSHAWN:
I don't see your name on any leases, on any bills, on the mailbox. Why don't you stay with your lame weeaboo boyfriend and leave me out of your ridiculous garbage!

	DAVID:
(seriously offended)
Oh you did not just call me..!

	KEYSHAWN:
I did! You're the worst people on the planet and I don't want to have anything to do with you or the culture that you think is so goddamned superior to ours!

	MAY:
Key...

	KEYSHAWN:
(cutting her off)
No, We're through! I hope you're happy with the life you've chosen! If it means anything to you, I'm not going to miss you or your idiot boyfriend!

And with that, the gray pallid head bursts forth from the ground. As soon as the head is free, it topples over to the grass, gasping for air. It is at this moment that we learn the grisly truth: This head is completely lacking a body. It's been severed and is moving about on its own, gasping for air like a fish upon the dock. Now that we can see it, the head is truly of a middle-aged Japanese man, its hair up in a topknot. As it gasps for air, we can see that its teeth are long, translucent spikes like those of a deep sea anglerfish.

The blue-green light shining up from underground persists, blazing a column into the night sky, a pale mist pours from the opening in the ground, surrounding the severed-but-ambulatory head.

	DAVID:
Oh yeah! Well we're not going to miss your snide remarks and your superiorist attitude! It's not you that's superior, it's us!

	KEYSHAWN:
You know, why don't you just shove that attitude right up your ass? I'm out.

	DAVID:
Fine! Go on! Get out of here! Who needs you!

The severed head appears to be feeding off of this hostility. It smiles as the two parties exchange shouts. With every verbal barrage, it appears to be getting stronger. Its eyes alight with life and its smile widens, revealing row after row of needle-sharp teeth. The head begins to rise on an invisible spine, starting to lift up off of the ground, to float. They all float down here.

Keyshawn storms off. The scene reverts to a focus upon David, May and Aaron.

	DAVID:
(normal speaking voice)
We don't, that's for sure.

	AARON:
I can't believe we had an unbeliever in our midst for so long!

	DAVID:
How could you, of all people not? You were dating her!

	AARON:
Yeah like two years ago! That's news so old Slashdot would just now be getting around to covering it.

	MAY:
Come on, let's not fight about it anymore.

	AARON:
Yeah, let's go home.

The three turn back to collect their paraphernalia.

As they leave, THE HEAD floats after them, holding tight to the ground, barely floating over the ground, moving itself along in an inchworming, flopping sort of gait, floating for a few inches, setting down to rest, floating for few and settling down again, panting the whole while.

TRANSITION:

	INT. DAVID'S HOUSE
Big, suburban home. David's parents have money. They have a very large first floor with a staircase leading up to a second floor landing. Perched at the top of this landing is a baby grand piano.

David, Aaron and May trudge on in through the front door.

	DAVID:
I just can't believe her!

	AARON:
Man, it's over. Let it go!

The pale gray-blue head is floating head is right outside, peering in through the kitchen window. It's gaining strength from their hostility and anguish.

	DAVID:
Easy for you to say, you were... you know... you've been intimate with her.

	AARON:
Yeah, so? So've a lot of guys. I don't know what that has to do with you cooling down.

	MAY:
It's not like she kicked you out of your house. Are you sure your parents will be okay with me staying here, at least for tonight?

	DAVID:
They're out of town. Mom's at Tahoe and Dad... Dad's off living the dream, on business in Hokkaido. 

David looks off into space and sighs wistfully. He wishes he could be in Hokkaido.

	DAVID:
Even though it's not Tokyo or Akihabra... It's still...

	AARON:
(staring off into space)
I know. I wish I were there too.

	MAY:
(likewise, staring off into space)
Me too.

	DAVID:
Hay, Aaron. It's been a long night, I think we're going to turn in.

ANYHOW AFTER A BUNCH OF BULLSHIT, THE PIANO FALLS ON MAY. DAVID AND AARON HAVE A BUNCH OF ANGUISH.

	DAVID:
I never got my chance to tell her, tell her that I loved her!

	AARON:
What, you've been with her for like four years.

	DAVID:
And in that whole time... In that whole time I never got a chance to, you know, be intimate with her.

At that moment, the floating head, now at the height of a tall, confident man, moving around with a phantom body that took powerful strides smashes through the kitchen window. It hisses, pulling decomposing old lips beyond the hideous needle teeth. The floating head growls something nasty in japanese and then hisses, charging David and Aaron. 

They clutch each other tight and scream like little girls as the monster approaches.

TOMORROW - DAY

MAY UNDER THE PIANO, GOLIATH ROBINSON WITH THE PIANO JOKE

	GOLIATH:
This sounds like a song of murder (sunglasses) in G-sharp.</b;ockquote>

Later on, Iota (the main character and hero) remarks to Goliath Robinson ""I bet you said something all cold and completely in disregard for human life like 'Sounds like someone's playing a song of murder' then you put on your sunglasses and continue ""... in B-flat.""

Then Goliath snaps his fingers and comments that Iota's was better because it stands on its own as a pun.

It's still better than anything Joss Whedon's written."

I wish I got paid to piss people off. he makes awful movies based on beloved titles, is generally loathed by the entire world, punched Lowtax in the mouth and bangs bikini models - truly, my role model) in which we postulated the prospect of adapting the hit video game Zombie Nation to the big screen. Below the cut are some AWESOME transcripts, yo! 
<lj-cut>
<blockquote>Tome: MAN I TELL YOU, ALL THESE FORUM POSTS ABOUT CLOVERFIELD HAVE ME REALLY EXCITED TO GO SEE IT

Tome: thinking about a Zombie Nation movie 
Tome: 90 minutes of a severed samurai head, floating around and shooting down jet fighters with its lazor eyes</blockquote>

Well, you know what? I decided that Doomshrooms (the screenplay I linked from the previous entry, all three of you keeping tabs at home) would be much better off if I modified the existing premise and focused more on an ""all floating severed zombie head"" sort of menace, rather than adorable little mushrooms eating people. So, some modifications will have to be made:
<blockquote>tome of finland: so, fuck Doomshrooms, it's stupid
tome of finland: Zombie Nation movie
tome of finland: I could easily change what I have now into a movie about flying heads shooting lazers from their eyes
comissar craud: Yes
tome of finland: it'd be trivial, actually
comissar craud: The floating severed head genre is criminally underrated
tome of finland: AND A WHOLE LOT MORE FUN TO WRITE, BECAUSE I JUST CAN'T FUCKING GET INTO WRITING MUSHROOMS AS SCARYBADS
tome of finland: I could very easily dip into Japanese horror, like I was doing with Trainwreck! anyway
tome of finland: Change Susan into a professor of Japanese folklore and leave Iota as a rancher on sour land
tome of finland: maybe it was a Japanese Internment Camp during the war and they cursed the dirt (atop the indial burial ground, serial murderer who lived there and the planeload of holocaust survivors)
comissar craud: Work in Japanophiles somehow
tome of finland: oh totarry
comissar craud: Like, a bunch of dipshit otaku accidentally resurrect a samurai
tome of finland: YESSSS
tome of finland: YESSSSSSS
tome of finland: that's the piano drop at the beginning
comissar craud: I'm giggling furiously
tome of finland: dumbshit kids get the piano pushed down the stairs at them, instead of a rich old lady
tome of finland: (me too)
tome of finland: and at the end, Gentleman Captain Jim Morgan US Navy Marines Aviator gets into a dogfight with them in a crop duster
comissar craud: Write Kanenwisher in as the guy who dies at the beginning
tome of finland: oh, naturally
tome of finland: he's shooting Neoranger Gamma
comissar craud: He tries to fight off the severed head using martial arts he's learned by watching Masked Rider
comissar craud: YES
tome of finland: ""It's okay! I know how to fight! I learned it by watching Kamen Mask and Supidioman!""
comissar craud: Then he does a bunch of poses and yells ""Henshin! V3!""
tome of finland: and the floating severed head just goes all ZAP like in Indiana Jokes
comissar craud: It should kill Annamae and then Kanenwisher breaks down about how he never told her he loves her, and then another guy goes ""Dude, you knew her for four fucking years""
tome of finland: oh god yes
tome of finland: again, we sound like we're having cybersex. I'm certain that internet archaeologists will read these raw logs and figure that this is all just some kind of elaborate foreplay ritual
tome of finland: ""Humm look at this here Zalpkknaj, it appears that this unit, Tome of Finland really seemed to become aroused when this unit, Commisar Craud said this."" ""You're right Fnwalrd, It appears that both parties in this sexual display prefer to have their egoes stroked more than their penes."" ""Gosh, I love it when you talk like that?""

This is about five pages from my feature film screenplay ""Doomshrooms."" It's about killer mushrooms. And as an aficiando of <i>killer mushrooms</i> myself, I can wholeheartedly agree.

This portion takes place after the killer mushrooms start killing those who are eating them. Cherry and Goliath Robinson are two of the main characters, the other main character, Iota Haamstein is only mentioned (he's on his own adventure in an adjoining scene).

This is really more me playing with formatting a screenplay for consumption in a web browser! Hopefully, these careful tables I spent about an hour formatting show up correctly!

"event","Jesus Christ, what a piece of shit. I had to leave the theater with my face obscured, lest anybody I know recognize me as I left the theatre.

The entire film was just a rundown of callbacks to previous films in the two franchises. Since I'm a total nerd who accepts the movie Aliens as his favorite film in the history of cinema, I find this movie to be particularly irritating. I'm going to rattle off a rundown of the irritating callbacks to previous films:

First and foremost, the title. ""Alien vs. Predator - Requiem"" Redundant because the creatures are both alien and predatory, and there wasn't a single sad song to be sung throughout the film, unless you count our NERDRAGEOUS ANGUISH.

- We're introduced to a TOUGH FEMALE LEAD character (who really only has an incidental role), she's wearing a USMC uniform (Desert Marpat) but has U.S. Army nametapes and unit patches. But she's an aviator. The fact that she can fly a helicopter is never alluded-to before the first act (It's called ""Checkhov's Gun, people. Learn to write.)

- The TOUGH FEMALE LEAD has a fragile young daughter with whom she's alienated. It was implied (but never stated outright) that the girl was five to six years of age, meaning that her mother was on deployment for much (four years) of her life, allowing the girl to become more attached to her father than to her mother. The girl was not cutely nicknamed after an amphibian.

- The main character (tough hombre Ex-Con who just <i>happens</i> to be BFF with the Sheriff) is named Dallas. Dallas was the name of the crewmember of the Nostromo that was sent into the Derelict on Company orders and came back with the facehugger parasite.

- ""What the fuck are you?""

- Scene where the Predator is walking along a grate and its quarry is clinging to the underside of the very grate upon which he is walking.

- Scene where the TOUGH FEMALE LEAD is driving an Armored Personnel Carrier (this time, a Stryker) through hordes of Aliens.

- ""There's a monster outside the window can I have a glass of water?"" ""There's no monster outside, here let me lean my face against the glass and shine my Mag-Lite..."" ~SURPRISE!~  Actually, the funniest scene in the whole fucking movie. The audience laughed for good three minutes straight after that scene.
As you'll recall:
<blockquote>
                                  NEWT
                   My mommy always said there
                   were no monsters.  No real
                   ones.  But there are.

        Ripley's expression becomes sober.  She brushes damp
        hair back from the child's pale forehead.

                                  RIPLEY
                          (quietly)
                   Yes, there are, aren't there.

                                  NEWT
                   Why do they tell little kids
                   that?.</blockquote>

- In Aliens, Hicks was splattered, gooshed solid with a healthy spray of acid blood, and it only kind of burned him a little bit, causing slight discomfort and requiring some ointment and gauze to repair. In AVP2, a hunter shoots a Facehugger, and the spray from its acid blood was <i>caustic enough to melt his arm off at the elbow.</i> Maybe their acid blood diluted a bit in the THREE HUNDRED FUCKING YEARS UNTIL HUMANS ACTUALLY MADE FIRST CONTACT WITH THEM.

- Predator uses the healing mechanism from the first two movies. Alas, he doesn't make a paste out of drywall.

- Predator's ship deploys in the same method as in the first movie. Main ship is left in orbit and a landing capsule is ejected to the surface.

- Fuck! Why are the Aliens even on Earth <i>to begin with?</i> Recall:
<blockquote>               INSURANCE MAN
                           (to ECA Rep)
                    Are there any species like this
                    'hostile organism' on LV-426?

                                   ECA REP
                    No.  It's a rock.  No indigenous
                    life larger than a simple virus.

        Ripley grits her teeth in frustration.

                                   RIPLEY
                    I told you, it wasn't indigenous.
                    There was an alien spacecraft there.
                    A derelict ship.  We homed on its
                    beacon...

                                   ECA REP
                    To be perfectly frank, we've surveyed
                    over three hundred worlds and no one's
                    ever reported a creature which, using
                    your words...
                           (read from Ripley's
                           statement)
                    ...'gestates in a living human host'
                    and has 'concentrated molecular acid
                    for blood.'

        Ripley glances at Burke, silent at the far end of the
        table.  His expression is grim.  Her mouth hardens as
        a bit of the old nail-eating Ripley surfaces.

                                   RIPLEY
                    Look, I can see where this is
                    going.  But I'm telling you those
                    things exist.  Back on that planetoid
                    is an alien ship and on that ship
                    are thousands of eggs.  Thousands.
                    Do you understand?  I suggest you
                    find it, using the flight recorder's
                    data.  Find it and deal with it --
                    before one of your survey teams
                    comes back with a little surprise...

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That
                    will be...

                                   RIPLEY
                           (louder, stepping
                           on him)
                    ...because just one of those
                    things managed to kill my entire
                    crew, within twelve hours of
                    hatching...

        Van Leuwen stands, out of patience.

                                   VAN LEUWEN
                    Thank you, that will be all.

        Ripley stares him down, glowering at the board.

                                   RIPLEY
                    That's not all, Goddamnit!  If
                    those things get back here, that
                    will be all.  Then you can just
                    kiss it good-bye, Jack!  Just kiss
                    it goodbye.</blockquote>

- ""Get to the chopper!"" I actually stood up and shouted ""OH FUCK YOU!"" to the screen when he said this, the audience cheered.

- It'd been established that ball ammunition and buckshot was worthless against the Aliens' armored hide (Hicks' shotgun was ineffective until shoved into an Alien's mouth, Vasquez was only able to kill the Alien with her supersexy nickel-plated pearl-handled High Power by shoving it against the creature's unarmored cheek), so of course, plain-jane 55gr ball ammo carried by the National Guard soldiers in their M4 carbines was of course sufficient to kill the Aliens (but however bounced off the Predator's loincloth, throwing sparks the whole while).

- Predator Gizmos: Wrist blades, Combi-stick, medical kit, AKIMBO PLASMACASTERS (WTF, seriously retarded, how is he supposed to track with two plasmacasters when he's only one targeting laser on his hemet?). There was no net-launcher, no dart-launcher, none of the fun tools he was packing in Predator 2.

- When the helicopter is flying away from the atomic fireball, the ""Escape From The Reactor"" overture is playing. 

- At the end, the remains of the Predator's kit is delivered to an Asian-looking woman who is referred to as ""Ms. Yutani."" This is a reference to The Company, who was only referred-to as such until the 1994 Extended Director's Cut of Aliens, where for a brief goddamned instant (seriously, like ten frames of film) is The Company referred to as ""Weyland-Yutani"" W-Y is a piece of fan lore, like the Ewoks, something that <i>everybody knows</i> despite the fact that it's never said aloud in the canon.

Jesus fucking Christ almighty over us. I'd like to say that the movie were an exercise in fanservice, but were it, it A: Wouldn't have taken place on Earth; B: Especially not in contemporary times and C: Would have at least had a sense of humor about itself. So, that being said, I'm of the opinion that the film was just a wholesale plagarism of half-dozen or so films that preceeded it.

What'd you think?

EDITED TO ADD:
But wait, there's more!

Due to the fact that the Alien in the film Alien Cubed was of a different design and locomoted in a primarily non-bipedal manner (seriously, in Aliens, we rarely even saw them in a bipedal locomotor, they were primarily quadrupedaling across ceilings and walls) than those in Aliens, coupled with the fact that the Alien emerged from a dog (in the original draft, it was a draft ox), that everybody automatically assumed that the Aliens as a species had some sort of mechanism that is able to blend itself with the host organism, taking on some of its traits.

This was the basis of the (super rad, I still have all mine) mid-90s Kenner line of Aliens toys and their accompanying comic booklets that they shipped with (I bought the Bishop figure just because I wanted the goddamned minicomic). 

To assume that this already fanciful monster can somehow be <i>even more fanciful</i> by modifying its already highly-improbable reproduction cycle to have the beast take on traits from the host organism is infuriating, as it detracts from the series' (not counting Ressurection) veneer of <i>plausibility,</i> for that plausibility is what defined the Alien series as one of the true masterworks of science fiction / horror. Eschewing the fine layer of plausibility and verisimilitude does to Alien what the Prequels did to Star Wars.

Uh and what Resurrection and AVP did to the Alien and Predator franchises. 

FURTHERMORE: It's <i>implied</i> in Aliens by Bishop that the Aliens timeline maintains continuity parity with the Terminator timeline. The original draft of the script, Bishop referred to his predecessor Ash as ""one of those old Cyberdyne models."" In the screen version, Ash is referred-to as ""one of those old Hyperdyne models."" While the possibility of an Alien / Predator / Terminator triangle crossover is a <i>wicked fucking sweet</i> idea, something tells me that those grassfucking executroids at Fox would even fuck <i>that</i> up.

EVEN ANOTHER MORE FURTHER:
I can't shake how this movie changed me on a fundamental level, yes, I realize THAT'S THE POINT OF ART. You're supposed to be a different person coming out than you were going in. But this film did it to me in the <i>bad way,</i> not in the good way like how Stalin starring Indian Superstar Chiru Chiranjheevi changed my outlook on life for the better, but in that sort of manner that convinced Chuck Manson that a Beatles B-Side (and not even a very good one at that) was the trumpet blare that signified the events depicted in The Revelation of Mark.

When I saw the movie, the whole theater was filled with hate. It was at that moment that I finally understood the appeal of the Klan or the Nazi party. Everybody is engaged in a mutual experience where the sole emotion being felt is a blinding hatred, directed with a pinprick focus upon one thing in particular.

It was an amazing experience, one I'd never felt before. It had an appeal to it, a sexy, slick sort of attraction like a centerfold model, slick with mineral oil and glaring from the studio lights. I've been hating things my whole life, but never in a group, never in an organized sort of herd, never before have I experienced raw, unilateral <i>hatred</i>. It was powerful, it was seductive - like that first snoot of cocaine. My mind was swirling and swimming with the very intoxication of a group-hate.

Now I know what it feels like to be a liberal, and I can certainly see the appeal.

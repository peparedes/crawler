"event","<a href=""http://bookshop.livejournal.com/834653.html"">What the HELL is wrong with people??</a>  How can there still be places where a lack of Hate Crime Legislation actually allows something called the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_panic_defense"">""gay panic defense""</a> to exist?? That a person can get away with murder just by claiming the victim was gay, regardless of if it's true?  And the fact that no one seems to want to cover this story nationally.  No major news stations or newspapers have covered this and it has been 2 months!

<a href=""http://www.crothersville.net/times/050207_murder.htm"">The details of this crime are horrific</a> and yet only <a href=""http://www.bloomingtonalternative.com/articles/2007/06/06/8379"">local papers</a> picked up the story at the time and only recently is anything getting out about it.  Mostly on blogs, which is basically like the internet equivalent of word-of-mouth.  This is not enough to get this out to the general public.  Spread the word but also be proactive and write to your local news stations and newspapers.  Write to your Senators and Congress Reps.  The fact that the ""gay panic defense"" has worked at least once and deadlocked two juries is a horrible and frightening statement about our country and its Justice System.

To see this and know it is part of the representation of the United States... how can this be?  How can these things happen?  This is my country, that we or our loved ones go to war and fight and die for?  This is the way of life we are defending?  What happened to those <u>Inalienable Rights</u> to <i>Life</i>, <i>Liberty</i> and the <i>Pursuit Happiness</i> that the United States of America was founded on?

<i>Talk</i> people!  Don't stay silent and allow this to happen.  Race, gender, religion, sexuality... <b>NONE</b> of these things are an excuse for murder!  

No hate.

Not in our yards.

Not in our towns.

Not anywhere."

"event","I know a lot of people around this area are not completely ""out of
the broom closet"" but please put on a ribbon so that those of us not
from here will know we are not all alone.

Pagan Awareness Day

All practitioners of Earth religions, Wicca, Shamanism, Druidry etc,
are being encouraged to wear a purple ribbon as a way of promoting
religious tolerance and to potentially raise awareness: On <b>Sept.
21st to 22nd</b> all Witches are going to wear little purple ribbons so
everyone will know Who Else is a witch/wiccan/ pagan/... . But no
one can do this if they don't know about it, so pass the word along!
This message goes to all Witches, Wiccans, Pagans from all sorts of
traditions.

We can make a day for ourselves!! Actually, two days!!! You can buy
a purple ribbon anywhere, Dollar store, Wal-Mart, shoppers Drug
Mart, anywhere...Wear it in your Hair, or pin it up to your shirt.
Make it public!!!

My thoughts: To alert that we are Pagans, Wiccans, Druids..etc. ..
tie a note on the end or label it ""Fight Religious Discrimination""

Mine will say that....PASS THIS ALONG!!!! to every one and to EVERY
group!!!!"

<b>Oldest, Middle, Youngest: Who's More Successful?</b>
Kate Lorenz, CareerBuilder.com Editor

All men may be created equal; but a look at their pay stubs will tell you that their incomes are not. Blame it on social class, education -- even luck, but according to Dalton Conley, New York University professor of sociology and public policy, inequality begins at home.

In his book ""The Pecking Order: Which Siblings Succeed and Why,"" Conley says that 75 percent of the income inequality between individuals in the United States occurs between siblings in the same families. He points to the diverse fortunes of Bill and Roger Clinton, and Jimmy and Billy Carter as examples.

Research shows that first borns (and onlys) lead the pack in terms of educational attainment, occupational prestige, income and net worth. Conversely middle children in large families tend to fare the worst. (Marcia! Marcia! Marcia!)

""A child's position in the family impacts his personality, his behavior, his learning and ultimately his earning power,"" states Michael Grose, author of ""Why First Born Rule the World and Last-borns Want to Change It."" ""Most people have an intuitive knowledge that birth order somehow has an impact on development, but they underestimate how far-reaching and just how significant that impact really is.""

Conley concedes that birth order is significant in shaping individual success, but only for children of large families -- four or more siblings -- and in families where finances and parental time are constrained. (In wealthy families, like the Bushes and Kennedys, it has less effect.)

Here's a look at what impact your birth-order may have on you:

<b>First Borns:</b>
More conscientious, ambitious and aggressive than their younger siblings, first borns are over-represented at Harvard and Yale as well as disciplines requiring higher education such as medicine, engineering or law. Every astronaut to go into space has been either the oldest child in his or her family or the eldest boy. And throughout history -- even when large families were the norm -- more than half of all Nobel Prize winners and U.S. presidents have been first born. Famous eldest children include: Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, Richard Branson, J.K. Rowling and Winston Churchill. And macho movie stars are First Born, too, including Clint Eastwood, John Wayne, Sylvester Stallone, Bruce Willis and all the actors who have played James Bond.
<b>
Middles:</b>
Middle children are more easy going and peer-oriented. Since they can get lost in the shuffle of their own families, they learn to build bridges to other sources of support and therefore tend to have excellent people skills. Middle children often take on the role of mediator and peacemaker. Famous middle children include: Bill Gates, J.F.K., Madonna and Princess Diana.

<b>Youngest:</b>
The youngest child tends to be the most creative and can be very charming -- even manipulative. Because they often identify with the underdog, they tend to champion egalitarian causes. (Youngest siblings were the earliest backers of the Protestant Reformation and the Enlightenment.) Successful in journalism, advertising, sales and the arts, famous youngest children include Cameron Diaz, Jim Carrey, Drew Carey, Rosie O'Donnell, Eddie Murphy and Billy Crystal.

<b>Only Children:</b>
Only children have similar characteristics to first borns and are frequently burdened with high parental expectations. Research shows they are more confident, articulate and likely to use their imagination than other children. They also expect a lot from others, hate criticism, can be inflexible and are likely to be perfectionists. Well-known only children include Rudy Guiliani, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Alan Greenspan, Tiger Woods, tennis' teen queen Maria Sharapova and Leonardo Da Vinci.

<b>Twins:</b>
Because they hold equal status and are treated so similarly, twins turn out similarly in most cases. Consider advice columnists ""Dear Abby"" and ""Ann Landers"" (Abigail and Esther Friedman), and Harold and Bernard Shapiro, who became presidents of Princeton University and Canada's McGill University respectively.

Dr. Frank Sulloway, a behavioral scientist and visiting professor at the Institute of Personality and Social Research at University of California, Berkeley and author of the book, ""Born To Rebel: Birth Order, Family Dynamics and Creative Lives,"" says first borns are more similar in personality to first borns in other families than they are to their own younger siblings and that youngest children are often more similar to the youngest child in another family than his or her own elder siblings. He says this is because the family is not as much a ""shared environment"" as a set of niches that provide siblings with different outlooks.

Conley agrees, but stresses that these are just general trends -- and that the whole birth-order theory can be turned on its head depending on the child's personality, the age gap between siblings and the family circumstances each child experiences during his or her formative years.

He apparently just found out that their old bassist, who left a while back, is bisexual.  So he comes into the store, complaining to the other guitarist about this fact, and grossed out that the man used to stand behind him for gigs.  He then makes a comment that if the guy had ever come on to him while he was still with the band, ""well, there'd be no way he'd ever be playing the bass again.""

"event","gotten from <lj user=""twilightfalcon"">.  Originally it had an ""If you agree, repost it"" at the end... but I left that out because I feel a little funny posting it in the first place.  I partially agree with the sentiment, but not with the agressive targetting of men, and the unspoken idea that only men can commit rape and all men are capable of raping a woman.  Or that only women get raped. A man can be raped as easily as a woman, and often has a lot less support or help dealing with the aftermath.  There are a lot of factors and possibilities.  And no one group of people can be singled out as either perpetrator or victim.


<i>A lot has been said about how to prevent rape.

Women should learn self-defense.
Women should lock themselves in their houses after dark.
Women shouldn't have long hair and women shouldn't wear short skirts.
Women shouldn't leave drinks unattended.
In fact, they shouldn't dare to get drunk at all.

Instead of that, how about:
If a woman is drunk, don't rape her.
If a woman is walking alone at night, don't rape her.
If a women is drugged and unconscious, don't rape her.
If a woman is wearing a short skirt, don't rape her.
If a woman is jogging in a park at 5 am, don't rape her.
If a woman looks like your ex-girlfriend you're still hung up on, don't rape her.
If a woman is asleep in her bed, don't rape her.
If a woman is asleep in your bed, don't rape her.
If a woman is doing her laundry, don't rape her.
If a woman is in a coma, don't rape her.
If a woman changes her mind in the middle of or about a particular activity, don't rape her.
If a woman has repeatedly refused a certain activity, don't rape her.
If a woman is not yet a woman, but a child, don't rape her.
If your girlfriend or wife is not in the mood, don't rape her.
If your step-daughter is watching tv, don't rape her.
If you break into a house and find a woman there, don't rape her.
If your friend thinks it's okay to rape someone, tell him it's not, and that he's not your friend.
If your ""friend"" tells you he raped someone, report him to the police.
If your frat-brother or another guy at the party tells you there's an unconscious woman upstairs and it's your turn, don't rape her, call the police and tell the guy he's a rapist.

Tell your sons, god-sons, nephews, grandsons, sons of friends it's not okay to rape someone.
Don't tell your women friends how to be safe and avoid rape.
Don't imply that she could have avoided it if she'd only done/not done x.
Don't imply that it's in any way her fault.
Don't let silence imply agreement when someone tells you he ""got some"" with the drunk girl.
Don't perpetuate a culture that tells you that you have no control over or responsibility for your actions. You can, too, help yourself.

<i>What I'm about to tell you is so outrageous, it's hard to believe it's true. But unfortunately, it is: Representative Richard Pombo (R-CA) has outlined a plan for the House draft budget reconciliation bill to sell off 15 national parks for energy and commercial development.

That's right - our natural heritage could soon be up for sale. Please sign this petition today to stop Congress' national park give-away.

One of the parks on the chopping block is Lake Clark National Park and Preserve in Alaska. Lake Clark protects the largest known Athapaskan archeological site in Alaska; an incredibly rugged wilderness containing two active volcanoes; and a wide variety of wildlife, including caribou, Dall sheep, brown bears, bald eagles, and peregrine falcons. The protected Lake Clark watershed is a significant part of the greater Bristol Bay watershed, which contains the world's largest Sockeye salmon fishery. This national treasure is irreplaceable.

Incredibly, there's more to the bill than just selling off 23% of the National Park System's acreage. Rep. Pombo's bill would require the Park Service to sell commercial advertising on the exterior and interior of all buses, shuttles, vans, trams, and passenger ferries operated within the National Park System. This bill would also require the Park Service to solicit and sell commercial sponsorship of park visitor centers, education centers, information centers, museums, trails, auditoriums, amphitheaters, and theatres throughout the National Park System.

And a painfully ironic provision of this bill would require the immediate sale of Theodore Roosevelt Island in the District of Columbia, which was established as a memorial for our nation's greatest conservation president.

Congress and the administration have a responsibility to protect our national heritage. Instead, Representative Pombo seems prepared to put our American heritage on the auction block, insulting the American people and tarnishing the birthright of current and future generations.

Sign this petition today to urge your Representative to oppose Rep. Pombo's National Park give-away! http://go.care2.com/e/Gg./BN/C.SZ

Thank you so much for helping to protect our national parks,

"event","REAL reasons Americans are opposed to gay marriage...

1) Being gay is not natural. Real Americans always reject unnatural things like eyeglasses, polyester, and air conditioning.

2) Gay marriage will encourage people to be gay, in the same way that hanging around tall people will make you tall.

3) Legalizing gay marriage will open the door to all kinds of crazy behavior. People may even wish to marry their pets because a dog has legal standing and can sign a marriage contract.

4) Straight marriage has been around a long time and hasn't changed at all; women are still property, blacks still can't marry whites, and divorce is still illegal.

5) Straight marriage will be less meaningful if gay marriage were allowed; the sanctity of Britney Spears' 55-hour just-for-fun marriage would be destroyed.

6) Straight marriages are valid because they produce children. Gay couples, infertile couples, and old people shouldn't be allowed to marry because our orphanages aren't full yet, and the world needs more children.

7) Obviously gay parents will raise gay children, since straight parents only raise straight children.

8) Gay marriage is not supported by religion. In a theocracy like ours, the values of one religion are imposed on the entire country. That's why we have only one religion in America.

9) Children can never succeed without a male and a female role model at home. That's why we as a society expressly forbid single parents to raise children.

10) Gay marriage will change the foundation of society; we could never adapt to new social norms. Just like we haven't adapted to cars, the service-sector economy, or longer life spans.

</sarcasm>
Please post this in your journal if you are for gay marriage."

Strep test came back negative.  Doc decided to send out for a culture anyway, just in case.  But if it isn't strep, he said, it's mono.

HOW THE HELL DID I CATCH MONO???

I live like a frikkin' nun!  I barely leave my house except to go to work, and even then, it would have to be incubating 2 days before my tonssils began to hurt on Thursday morning.  What. the frik?

If I swallow, it hurts.  If I try to drink anything, I choke.  I can't even <i>yawn</i> without it feeling like I'm tearing a hole in my throat.  When I lay down to go to sleep, I can't breathe.  I've taken to sleeping sitting up and even then I'm having trouble.

This.  sucks.  I want it to go away.

So far I've been getting by on art sites, but I can't read any of the info sites, and also there are a few artists I've been visiting for a while who for various reasons (which I can guess without being able to read the explantions) who have made their sites more difficult to access, some requiring passwords and some just saying along the lines of ""click the teeny tiny whatzzit down in the corner"".  The latter I can usually figure out... tiny icons or random questionmarks down at the bottom of a page with almost nothing but blank space between the last bits of writing and where it is kinda clues you in.

Yes.. yes... I browsed the <i>PORN</i> store with my <i>MOTHER</i>.  This just goes to show that I have no shame.  Not a single blush graced my face.  Though we did laugh a lot at the gag gifts.  (We were shopping for a bridal shower)  My next goal, now, is to actually buy something from a porn store.. anyone have any ideas?  <img src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y128/ebonykain/Clip%20Art/animesweat.gif"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">

So, I found a zinc penny, a silver quarter, got a trip to the porn store, and a free scoop of Rum Raisin ice cream... almost makes up for the phone call from the doc telling me Friday, they're gonna take this camera a stick it inside my knee while poking around in places that are already painful without the poking and prodding  -_-;;

ah well... hopefully they're be able to fix anything that's wrong... otherwise, I'm shite outta luck and just have to deal with the pain for the rest of my life.  Currently, the doc thinks that my patella and my knee ""have a bad relationship"".  Hopefully he can play marriage councellor to my joints.

"event","work is killing me.. I'm so exhausted, and my joints are killing me because of the humidity.  I need to find a job somewhere that I can sit for at least half the time.  I'm not going to last, and since I'm only part time, it isn't like I get any health insurance or benefits of any kind.  I see the doc on the 21st and he's going to tell me if I need knee surgury or not.  THEN we can finally look at the other joints that are killing me.  I ccoul barely lift anything with my left arm today.  Hell, forget lifting, i could barely raise it!  I'm allergic to cinnamon and they have me making the coffees, which includes three caraf-thingies of cinnamon flavoured coffees (each gets filled with 2 and a half pots).  I got beaned in the head with the shelf of cigaretts, so I've been dealing with that headache.  To top it all off, I got my period last night.

...you know, despite having been employed at Sunoco since July 6th, I'm so irregular that this will be my first time working there with my period.  I've come to the conclusion that it sucks.  BAD.

And to top of a <i>lovely</i> 9 hour shift that began at 5:30am... we had a drive off that I had to <b>chace down the bloody street</b> to get the bint's license plate number.  I called the cops, gave the description and then the bitch has the nerve to say she pre-paid in the store... SHE NEVER BLOODY CAME INTO THE STORE!  And anyhow, her story didn't hold water.  She said she came in, asked for 15 buck, handed a 20 to me and got five dollars back.  Now if this were the case the pump would automatically stop at $15, and you can't open the register until that's keyed in, and it wasn't on any other pumps by mistake or anything.  She pumps $16.73, and claimed that she had to stop it because it didn't stop on its own.  Then it is STILL her responsibility to come inside the store and pay the difference, otherwise it is stealing.  She didn't.  Instead she pulls away from the pump, drive AROUND the back of the store and tries to go out the side entrance.  I ran after her, shouting at the top of my lungs, and her windows were rolled down, so she damn well shoulda heard me, yet she <i>sped</i> into the street and through a red light.

I HATE MY FSCKING JOB!!

I wish I could just go back to school and work a computer job again...  I get along with my coworkers well enough... but I have no friends here at home, and none of them are the kind of people I'd really be friends with.  the two closest to my age are mothers of infants, and both are younger than me.  It boggles my mind!  I'm only 22!  i can't even begin to think about <i>breeding!</i>  To boot, they're all smokers, which I am not.  To hang out with them is to be in a perpetual cloud of smoke, which leaves me feeling nausious and dizzy.  I'm only making enough to make sure my student loan bill is paid each month, with a bit left over to put toward tuition for next term, which I still don't think I'm going to be able to afford, even with taking out loans.

I'm bloody miserable here and still haven't found a mental health doc. near here that I can go to.  And everything is getting worse.  The meds that were meant to control the schizophrenia never worked in the first place, the depression is back, but I'm so out of my freaking mind when on Paxil that it's as bad as the depression was to begin with, and the black outs are happening again.  The panic attacks are worse than ever, and I don't know what I'm going to do.  I just keep thinking to myself ""I want to go home"" but the kicker is, I AM home.  But I wish I was back at Elmira....

and now... I need to go to bed... at 9pm, because I have to get up at 4:30am again.  Good night."

not only was it the day from hell because we got all the deliveries and I had 2 drive offs, but I wound up getting sick.  Actually, I was in the middle of counting back change to a customer when I had to clap my hand over my mouth and run to the bathroom, where I stayed for a good 15 minutes paying tribute to the porceline god.

Ah, yes... the joys of being an adult and working.  After that, I got to continue working until the end of my shift.  fun stuff, eh?

"event","*siiigh*  I just keep reading about all the crap going down in New Orleans because of Hurricane Katrina.  Everything is just so messed up, and we're now being 'treated' to the worst that humanity has to offer... People are actually taking pot shots at rescue helicopters to make the pilots rescue THEM and THEIR family.  There's looting, and probably murder and rape, though that hasn't been reported yet.  People wading through water infested with disease, alligators and sharks.  Our National Guard is <i>overseas</i> fighting a war no one wants to be a part of, rather than being home to do their job... protecting the people HERE!

Parents have been forced to leave their children behind and pray that they are rescued.  Barriers have been erected around hospitals to keep looters out.  Busses carrying emergency supplies have been hijacked for their water.  The Search and Rescue has been suspended because the crime needs to be held in check.  Who knows how many people are still out there waiting to be saved?

The hospitals attempt to evacuate, yet are inundated with new patients needing help.  15,000 to 20,000 people had taken sheltar in the convention center, and are waiting on busses to come get them.  Yet only one bus at a time comes and it'll hold maybe 20-30 people. There are no more resources at the center.  Soon there will be a riot.

The Superdome isn't much better off.  25,000 people packed in like sardines, for days have been without fresh water, working toilets, or any power.  Only a few busses came to evacuate people, at first.  Fights broke out between civilians and the few National Guardsmen there.  Everntually, the people were moved to Houston's Astrodome, which hasn't been used in years.  But the ambulance service in charge of taking the sick and injured from the Superdome suspended flights after someone shot at a military helicopter.

While all this is going on, reporters have been flown in and are waltzing around, snapping pictures of the dead, dying, and bereaved.  Yet they neither provide, nor offer to help those they could.

It's like the tsunami that trashed SE Asia came back to get us for sending them help.

And yet here we are... and no one sends help the United States.

yeah, these little guys (well... not SO little) like to hang out in our backyard.  they sit in the pear tree, walk across the lawn, and I think they roost in our woods.  THEN they go take little naps on our deck and tease the cat.  Seriously!  They do!  Mystic is sitting in the window, watching them and murmuring every now and then, trying to convince us to open the screen and let her go out.  The cranes come over to the edge of the railing and stretch their necks out as far as they can toward her.  She tail switches and she gives his little complaining yowl, and then the crane slowly settles back again.  They know she can't get to them, so they teast her!

<img src=""http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y128/ebonykain/photos/youngcrane.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">
this is a picture from the first time they came, when we still had our pool.  I've nicknamed this one ""The Scout"", because that first year it was only him/her (I can't tell the gender, I don't even know the species!).  Then, the following year, there was a whole family... two adults (who won't stay still for me to get my camera and take pictures) and about 3 fledeglings.  

Now there's only two who still hang out, but they aren't the ones I figured for the adults a couple years ago.  They don't have the same faces (and I'm not talking about face-markings or shape... I mean their <i>faces</i>... leave me alone, they do all have different faces!).

I hope they keep coming back.  They're pretty, and don't mind too much if I get... relatively close to them... They'll stay still unil I'm about a yard away, and <i>then</i> fly off in a huff.  I like them.  They're cute and fluffy.  ^__^

EDIT:  Thanks to  <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/mactavish/"">mactavish</a> for helping me identify these birds.  We believe they are immature Black-crowned Night Herons.  They'll reach full size at about a year old, but aren't adults until around age 3, when they'll look like <a href=""http://www.mbr-pwrc.usgs.gov/id/framlst/Photo/Images/h2020pi.jpg"">this</a>.  I hope they decide to stick around when they're adults.  I want some pictures of these guys.  They're so pretty!"

Powers: Charges objects with kinetic energy by touching them, then they explode like grenades.<br><br><table border='0' width='300' cellspacing='0' cellpadding='0'><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Gambit</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='75' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>75%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Rogue</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='70' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>70%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Storm</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='65' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>65%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Emma Frost</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='65' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>65%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Iceman</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='60' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>60%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Nightcrawler</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='60' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>60%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Jean Grey</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='55' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>55%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Colossus</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='55' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>55%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Wolverine</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='55' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>55%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Beast</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='25' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>25%</font></td></tr><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Cyclops</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='25' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>25%</font></td></tr></td></tr></table><br><a href='http://quizfarm.com/test.php?q_id=37497'>Most Comprehensive X-Men Personality Quiz 2.0</a><br><font face='Arial' size='1'>created with <a href='http://quizfarm.com'>QuizFarm.com</a></font></table>

"event","so, I'm not sure how I feel about the interveiw...  i don't feel confident, but I don't feel like I bombed it... I told mum all about it, and she says I was pretty good (though, she <i>is</i> my mum) but there was also a literal <i>stack</i> of other people's resumes, so if there are people with more experiance going for the job....

ah well... if it doesn't work out, mum's boss basically ensured me a job (so long as there's an opening) working as a paraprofessional in Special Ed.

But I'm not so sure about it... considering the only current opening is for a multiple-handicapped kid who would need both feeding, and <i>diaper changing</i>.

Though I politely said I would think on it, inside I was going <i>Oh <b>hells</b> no!</i>.  Changing the diaper of a 5th grade boy??  o_<;

*shudder*

ah well... tomorrow I go back to my craptacular job that is killing me (quite literally, actually) and wish or something better...

"event","hmmmm... Ebony has two bunnies running around in her head... But no clue how to go about writing them at the moment.  

The first doesn't need a spoiler space, but the second does.

1)  I suppose it would have to be AU, but.. well, here it is:  Someone comes to Central Military HQ, looking for the Elric brothers.  He says he's their father--and after so long a time since they saw him, they can't be 100% sure he isn't.  He <i>looks</i> like he could be.  He's there to lay claim to the boys as their legal guardian, and demands Edward be removed from the military.  Fullmetal refuses, and a legal battle begins--Edward is still a minor, after all.  Mustang, as Ed's sponsor, is given leave to return to Central from East HQ--he knows something isn't right, but will he be able ot prove it?  Who is this man who wants to take the boys, and what is he after?

..I know, vague and choppy.. but that's the mutant plot bunny for you.

second Bunny, behind the <lj-cut text=""SPOILER SPACE"">

2)In the manga-verse of FMA, Hoho-papa leaves to return to Rizembul.  There, he meets up with Ed and they have.. a litle bit of a spat.  Edward goes back to his life, while Hoho-papa's carriage gets laywayed by bandits on the way back to Central (at least, I assume that's where Hohenhiem was headed).  Now here's where all thsoe chimera fics invade Ebony's head and make a mutant bunny:  Between Hoho-papa getting shot up and living through it, and getting back to Central, Ed has a run in with an Alchemist wanting revenge against the military.  A big fan of the late Shou Tucker, this alchemist wants to see the results of transmuting and Alchemist and an animal.  In Al and Winry's attempts to smuggle Ed out of Central before his condition is discovered, they literally run into Hohenhiem.  What does he do, when confronted with both his sons, and what they've become?

</lj-cut>

ok, those are my bunnies.  please someone adopt them!"

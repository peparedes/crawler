"event","OK HI, i'm drunk.  It is 1:15 in the morning the day after St. Patty's Day, and I'm drunk.  I had a very interesting night tonight.  I saw my old group of friends from when I was dating Randy.  I haven't seen them in 2 and a half months.  I was very nervous, but of course, everything was fine.  They all actually said that they missed me.  It was really nice to see everyone.

That is until around 11:00 when Randy rolled in.  I totally thought that I was home free without seeing him, but he did show up.  He completely ignored me when he arrived.  He did say hi and how are you as he was already walking away.  So, I didn't even have a chance to respond.  Gay!!!

At the end of the night, when I was super ready to go, he brings up the Floyd conversation.  Actually it happened before I was ready to go.  He is so annoying about that stupid rabbit that needs to be put down anyway.  He was pissed when he told me that I had to take him, and I said that's fine because I'll just take him to the Humane Society.  he got pissed and I just walked away as though we were never talking.  

He brought it up again later.  and I told him that no one wants him, and he was pissed again.  I never said good-bye or anything.  Seriously, is that what he needs to talk about when he sees me out?  Couldn't we just hide our bullshit from everyone just once?  Whatever, what is done is done, and I have never been happier in the past 8 years, so Iknow that I did the right thing.  

There was a lot of editing in this because I am typing very stupidly right now."

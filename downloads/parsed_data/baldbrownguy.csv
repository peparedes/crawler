"event","Lately, I've been giving quite a bit of thought to viewpoints of organized religions that are shared with me by people I&nbsp;meet.

Well, in particular, Roman Catholicism.&nbsp; For reasons which I'm sure must be obvious to anyone who reads this entry.

In California particularly, that question and that issue can be very...&nbsp; well, charged.&nbsp; Especially in light of all the buzz regarding Prop 8 last November.&nbsp; It's funny, because I've had to explain *to Catholics and non-Catholics alike* what the Catechism of the Catholic Church has to say on the matter of LGBT.

It says, and yes this is an excerpt of a bigger section, &quot;they need understanding but must not be discriminated against in any way whatsoever&quot;.

Who promulgated this writing?&nbsp; Ioannus Paulus II Pontifex Maximus.&nbsp; Yup.&nbsp; JP2.&nbsp; No, it wasn't some liberal author in a commune.

The Church doesn't hate LGBT.&nbsp; The Church *does* defend the sacrament of matrimony.&nbsp; Then again, it has defended its views of sacraments against everyone from Caesar Agustus to Martin Luther, so that shouldn't be much of a shock.

I don't think I'll every truly understand, beyond acceptance of &quot;practical realities&quot;, which really shouldn't have any bearing on the topic of faith and spirituality (of *any* religion or faith practice), why people constantly take the easy way out.&nbsp; Neither those who are judgmental (approaching bigotted) in the name of their deity or religion -- in contravention to their own religion's views of the issue, nor of those who just desperately look for something, someone, or a group of someone's to blame for &quot;impeding&quot; the direction which they are trying to move in.

-----

Why am I&nbsp;thinking about this today?

Well, I try to attend Mass in Latin once a month.&nbsp; There is a certain...&nbsp; solemnity in it.&nbsp; It's been said by many, that lots of religious faiths have a tongue of worship; a language which exists for them solely for prayerful use.&nbsp; In the history of the Roman Catholic Church, this is Latin.

But boy oh boy is it a different experience.&nbsp; The rector of the chapel in my area who celebrates Latin Mass via the Tridentine form (not the Mass of Paul VI, post Vatican II) is...&nbsp; well, different.&nbsp; I suppose part of this is because he is French.&nbsp; But his homilies use...&nbsp; well, language and descriptions which would make me want to cover the ears of a child.&nbsp; I&nbsp;mean, even in &quot;modern day&quot;, we learn of Hell and Purgatory and Satan and other poetic things described by Milton in &quot;Dante's Inferno&quot;.&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; But in modern day, we don't talk about these things every day, nor throw around these powerful words and images so cavalierly.

I&nbsp;mean seriously,&nbsp; my local parish doesn't use those words so much; much less does it exhort ghastly imagery of sinners burning for eternity.&nbsp; That's rather more...&nbsp; well, Jehovah's Witness.&nbsp; (Yeah, I've been to a Kingdom Hall Meeting before).

My local parish, and most Catholic parishes that I know of, focus on Christ's Love more than they focus on Christ's Suffering.&nbsp; And they focus on both of these more than they focus on &quot;what happens to you if you don't follow every rule to the letter&quot;.&nbsp; I mean...&nbsp; we have a Sacrament which you could I suppose call &quot;The Sacrament of Owning Up to My Bad Because I Screwed Up, I'm Sorry, and I Ask Spiritual Support In Not Doing It Again&quot;.

So why those particular thoughts?

Because Pope Benedict XVI in the last couple of weeks lifted the excommunications on the Society of Saint Pius X.

You know what?&nbsp; SSPX scares me.&nbsp; Really.

Excommunication isn't what it used to be, you know.&nbsp; It's not like the Inquisition and the Auto da F&eacute;.

Here's the short skinny on SSPX.

They don't approve of Vatican II, don't like the &quot;modernizations&quot; in the Church, and don't like the Mass of Paul VI.&nbsp; There are other reasons, but like I&nbsp;said, the short skinny.

So they did their own thing.&nbsp; Thing is, they were a small group, and lacking in headcount.&nbsp; So they consecrated four bishops.

K, here's the deal.&nbsp; The Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church, and to an extent various branches of Protestantism (like the Anglican Church) in this case adhere to a principle known as Apostolic Succession.&nbsp; These big churches argue over the implications of authority (a secular/political thing) in Apostolic Succession, but they adhere to the principle nonetheless.&nbsp; Apostolic Succession means that bishops are the heirs of the Apostles.&nbsp; That's why all the &quot;higher ups&quot; are bishops.&nbsp; Even the Pope is just a bishop.&nbsp; It just so happens that being the heir of Peter, he is therefore the head bishop, and this is where the argument comes in.

Anyhow, how do apostles make apostles?&nbsp; Well, unless you were a follower of Christ Himself (who made you an apostle Himself), the other apostles honour you as an apostle, and you become one of their brethren.&nbsp; Okay, this means this:&nbsp; bishops are consecrated by other bishops.&nbsp; Plural.&nbsp; Other bishops.

SSPX didn't start a Holy War or anything.&nbsp; What they did was consecrate bishops.&nbsp; Which is beyond the bounds of their authority.&nbsp; In defiance of the Church's Magisterium.&nbsp; Magisterium in this case means &quot;the teaching authority of the Church&quot;.&nbsp; No, they weren't barricaded in a seminary and put in a Waco-style siege.&nbsp; They broke Canon Law, and the excommunication was automatic.&nbsp; There's no real drama here.&nbsp; It's like when you get a ticket, you don't pay it, and x number of days from the time it gets to the County Registrar, the DMV is notified and your license is suspended.

So why does it scare me?

Because so far, based on what little I've been able to dig up on the recent events...&nbsp; I feel like they broke the law and got away with it.

-----

The point?

The point is that organized religions are blamed for many things, and are used as justification for many things.&nbsp; We may not be invading lands and trying to convert Indians anymore, but just as before great evil is often done in God's name, whether you call Him Yahweh, Allah, Jehovah, or what have you.&nbsp; In no way am I leaving out polytheistic faiths or any other religion, but it'd take too long to type.

And in this day and age...&nbsp; that great evil is ignorance and laziness, it seems to me.&nbsp; There's so much that one could understand and reflect upon, with a little effort and a little time; which incidentally makes a wonderful excuse to break out of our day-to-day in a crappy economy and just...&nbsp; hang out on a sunny day or look up at stars or something.

Funny how little effort people put into trying to understand what it is that they really believe.&nbsp; Both those who participate in organized religions/faiths, and those who don't."

"event","I didn't think of either candidate as ""the perfect president for our time"", honestly.  I had concerns with both of them.  Frankly, none of my concerns were show-stoppers for me favouring the one or the other.

I expected Obama to win, simply because he ran a better campaign.  In other words, simply because he did a better job, he deserved to win.

But from what I saw...  in mid-October, the race blew wide open as the economy took a crap.

And the more imperfect McCain became...  the more perfect Obama became.

I think that's a Bad Thing(tm).

We're in a recession.  The next few years are going to be tough.  He knows it.  He even said so in his acceptance speech.

Yes, the next few years will be tough.  And if he falls short of the hype we are collectively stirring up...  it's our fault, not his.

He may prove to be one of the most brilliant leaders we've ever had.

But what if we're shitty followers?

Neither of them made us spend beyond our means, buy houses we can't afford on crappy loan terms, and with that big pile of debt turn right around and buy a 52"" HDTV at Walmart (which last I checked was not guaranteed to us in the Constitution).

We collectively as a nation turned on McCain so fast...  I hope we don't do the same to Obama."

"event","My mom and I argue so much that I about to cry! She drives me insane! She is just crazy! I hate her so much!! She just wants everyone to feel sorry for her... I don't feel sorry for her. It was her fault that my rother left in teh first place. He never would have left and gotten murdered if it wasn't for her. I blame her!"

"event","Wow, I am feeling really strange right now. I don't think that I can even describe how I feel. I don't think that I have ever felt this way before. I am feeling kinda sad, depressed, happy, nervous, and excited all at the same time. The relationship with my mom is getting better, and I am happy about that.. I am sad because the guy I like now knows that I like him, and he told me that he likes someone else... I don't even know what I am nervous about.. I am excited for the steer show that I am going to next weekend. I am sad because I miss my brother tht died about four years ago... I am kinda mad about the fact that my mom does not trust me in anything I do.. She always says that I am to old to act the way I do.. But then later she'll say that I am to young to do something.. I hate the way she is.. She is so cruel.. She thinks just because my brother died everyone will feel sorry for her and do whatever she wants them to. Well, I am not going to fall for that trick.. I am to smart for her. I miss my friends from middle school, and I feel out of place in high school. There are so many different kinds of people.. They all act like they don't like me because I hang around the guys.. My dad does not like that I have guy friends and that I don't have many girl friends.. He says that if he was in high school, he would think that I am a slut... He also said that I am getting fat... I think that that is kind of rude for him to say about his FIRST child.. If I had the choice to livce with any one in the world, would choose to move to Vegas and live with my best friend, Lisa. Or, I would live with my big brother Trevor. He is so cool. If he didn't want me, my neighbor would.. He is 18 and he is the biggest pimp in the world. He is hella nice though. Oh Wellz, that is enpugh for now..."

"event","I went to fair this past summer, and I sold my best friend. I loved him a lot. His biggest problem was the fact that he had an attitude problem. He was kinda mean. Well anyways, I showed him.... I didn't place in shownamship(but who cares about that anyways?) and I got 2nd place in Market. I advanced to the championship round. I got placed in last place because he was so small. He was the smallest in the class. I still did better than about 75 steers. I didn't come out of the ring sad that I got last, I had a smile on my face because I had fun. That is the main thing- to have fun, and I had a lot. My beef group got first place for the best display. We got third in Herdsmen. I can't wait until this summer when I can do it all again."

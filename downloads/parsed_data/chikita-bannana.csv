"event","today is a sad but funny day. I was like superly duperly hyper at lunch today and every one was like tweeker and yeah.NE ways josh came to school today oh my gos is he annoying. this guy... i dont even know his name always gives me his french fries so im like cool D-A-W-G and this guy on my bus that totally listens to good music ""n"" stuff kept untieing my shoe then id tie it and he would do the sames thing to the other so i kept having to tie them but it's ok cuz hes cool. oh yeah and then he poked me in my butt because of the hole in the side of my pants. then somethin else happened but i can't remember oh well.
the only reason i was sad is because of the same stupid reason yesterday. I know this is gonna sound really stupid but last night i fell asleep with the wheels in my hand. I can't help it he is sooo nice and if you read my journal entries then you should kno who i am talking about ""LOGAN!"" of corse. i am so tired right now i think i used all my energy at lunch today.
it sucks because we have to run because this dude says hell give us 9th hour if we walk to slow and if we go behind him then we will get 9th hour and have to stay 2 whole hourse after school and thats not gonna happen.so then the fat fuck starts to run and im like poopty puty pant i have to run. well i think iv typed enough my fingers hurt now.

"event","i don't get it is there something wrong with me? I guess it's just ont of those days when you stop and think about ..... well just about everything, but for me those kind of days are every day sometimes just more than others. i don't see why no one likes me i know im not that pretty or anything but i dtill don't get it. I wish i could find a guy who i don't have to impress or live up to his standards like some pet. am I a threat to guys just because i skateboard or don't wear slutty outfits."

What good does all this introspection do me? I am still not sure; at one time it served the purpose of sorting out all the knickknacks and souveniers of my mind... but, as of late, I feel like an obsessive-compulsive personality, forever rearranging and dusting off every little objet, forgetting that the house I am in is so bloody large that the job shall never been finished. It is a hard, hard habit to break, though. I'm not sure how to stop, and I think that, for my better health, I'd best come up with someone... elsewise, I'm just going to end up falling into myself and making quite the large mess for anyone who has to clean up after me. I remember, being younger, and thinking about all matters of thing; the nature of truth, meaning in life, and just random little things... what happened? Where has all this egotism come from? Oooer. I just realized how horribly ironic that statement is. I do believe I shall save the introspection for Livejournal alone; I need to find a way to prevent me from thinking about myself nigh all the time... a rubber band around the wrist to snap myself when I'm naughty? We'll see, we'll see. A mood swing today was, veritably indeed. Resulting from academic and otherwise stress? Yes. I do not handle stress well, and my internal state over the last week or so illustrates this painfully. For my continued well-being, I am going to bed now.

That is all."

What a weekend this was. To detail it would take a long time, and I am not sure whether I am feeling up to such a task or not. A summary, at the very least, is called for. Four hours of sleep on Thursday night left me quite tired for Friday classes; after classes, I phoned Michelle, some random girl who graduated with me. She gave me her number after a conversation I had with her on the bus (our meeting was serendipitous, and nothing more). She seemed quite happy to hear from me; I'd like to believe that, mayhap, a romance might be on the horizon that way, but it is most likely my optimism, and not my sensibilities, speaking such a hope. Went to visit my cousin, Chris, for the usual idle and surreal conversation that characterizes our time together; I shall be glad when he is gone, for though I enjoy his company, it consumes far too much of my time for not enough overall benefit, either social or otherwise.

Caught the late night bus out; no sleep was got, and my rest in the hotel room so kindly booked for me was far from substantial. After 12 hours at the conference, punctured by long bouts of waiting for the next meeting, I went out on the town to waste away some time 'til around 2 AM, which is when my bus left (at the time it was 9 PM). Bumping into a duo of stoners lead me to a random party where I met up with Megan, an old crush of mine. We talked a bit, I played video games with her boyfriend whilst arguing economy, and I left, catching the bus back. During those 12 hours of meeting, interacting with other teenagers, though mostly younger, I rediscovered my inability to interact in an appropriate manner with normal people. Of course, it could have been the sleep deprivation, but my inclusion in a game of half court ruined the game, because of my tendancy to play-to-win in stead of play-to-have-fun.

In matters of games, I often play to win, for that is what causes me happiness. I have no true definition of 'fun'; though I may experience the same state that others label 'having fun', I do not call it such... hence, no conception of the activities to label 'fun'. Hrrm. I need to think on this more before I can properly explain it; though the words are there, they are not coherent, and I need to analyse events in my past more before I can come up with a properly-articulated and -supported theory.

Ah, yes. Going to the party in Smithers; obseving someone else's social world was, to be honest, a disturbing and upsetting event. To be reminded that there are thousands of other people out there, whose company you one would love to share, and whose friendship will never be yours, is a difficult experience. Comparable to realizing how small one is in comparison with the whole of the universe, this knowledge weighed heavy on me, and caused me depression most certainly, though, now, it doesn't bother me. Those who say ignorance is a sin forget that ignorance, the deprivation of cruel knowledge, is the greatest mercy of them all.

With that, I do believe I am finished. Certianly, I could write more, but I tire of this; the emotional relevance of the happenings of this weekend is most certainly gone, and the introspection I've spent on such happenings seems wasted. Freshness, this is important; like a pauper's dinner, introspection may be  impatable when taken from the fire that cooked it, but is inedible not long after. There is a critical period, and getting near a computer with an internet connection during this window of emotional awareness is a task, indeed!

That is all."

My dreams, as of late, have all possessed a very sexual quality to them. Though not involve coitus per se, there is often much in the way of nudity and groping, or just making out. Is my waking denial of my own sexuality causing small fissures to appear in my consious, creating this odd night-reals of surreal soft-core pornography? Last night, in that theatre that is my head, I was the bedmate of a beautiful woman 42 year old woman, with two young children (I knew about these children only because she told me of them, and I guessed her age based on the fact she told me she graduated in '79.) Hrrrm. Maybe this is something that should be addressed; I ignore my sexuality largely out of lack of... well, satieation, much as a person hungered will try to think of food as little as possible. It does me no good to think about sex, or even consider it, for there is a pronounced lack of it in my life. Best that I don't think of the pronounced lack, either; down that path lies traitorous self-deprecation and shame.

Speaking of which, I'm feeling, or was feeling, quite untalented. Of course, I am not saying that I rare in this; many people flow through life without being able to do little outside of what is taught to them in school, or, at least, with any amount of skill. I know that I can write well, and school-related things come easy to me, but... that is all, when I consider it. This is an issue relating to something else, the issue of creations and impressions and so forth, an issue better left to a time when I am less tired and more careful, precise about how I express myself. I should not try to update in the morning, as a future note.

Chatted with Alexandria during class, today; the talking over the professor and such made me reminice to high school, for it felt very high-school like today in class. Alex seems an interesting person, maybe; a girl who dresses in the most unique of clothing, and seems relatively unphased by the reality around her. A valuable friend, at the very least! I might have had a crush on her, but, as of late, I am felling paticularly unromantic, so such interest is going to be difficult to inspire in me.

I tire of education, to be honest; I must continually question my presense here, and, as my mother said to me, ""If you don't join academia now, you are going to be painfully lonely when you are older. Even if you consider most of your peers flakes, it is among the academics you will find others like you, as you age."" Odd, to spend 7 to 8 years in school for a social life in the future, but, in consideration of how important human contact is to all peoples. As well, university does give me something to whittle away the time with, though I believe I would be quite happy doing not much at all. Walking late at night, drinking coffee, sleeping in as late as I wish, tending to household duties... I am happy with these small details; I have yet to be visited with a long burst of ""urge to change things"", but I am a chaotic person, and a long burst of anything beyond despair is rare within me. Even then, said emoness/despair is continually punctured with moments of happiness.

Katie signed on for the first time in a long time; our talking was short enough to prevent me from becoming enamoured with her again, thankfully. Surely, she must be perceptive enough to realize the effect she has on me, but people have failed this before, and I have a tendancy to be a disgustingly subtle person, at times. My attempts at a sense of Zen like peace are working, though I find that, during these moments of effort, I tune out, making navigating the halls and recognizing the faces of people I know quite difficult. Beyond that, little has happened. My relationship with Christopher, is, as always, quite bland, involving the shared consumption of coffee and the exchange of surrealisms. It is hard to believe that I have known him for 14 years, now; a long time to be friends, most certainly. I spend upwards of 6 hours a day, every three or four days of a week, hanging out with him. A great consumer of my awake time, to be certain.

The journal, it is being restarted. I feel the need to continue on with my postings, for my internal musing put into text oftne helps me deal with my lesser tragedies, and come to grip with my greater ones. As before, the purpose of keeping a record of my emotional development is a matter of interest. Being in Prince George has made me a happier person, overall, though it can be lonely, at times. I find that much of my introspection is spent (i.e. wasted) on coming to grips with my own sense of isolation; I am not sure whether to cure it, or to accept it. Accept it is the current state of my mind, but, as always, this is subject to change. Lonliness, for me, has never been based so much on the reality of my social life so much as it is based on the oft' highly skewed perception of such. Other, more superficial, things haunt my thoughts, as always. From what to do with my future to whether or not I am attractive to the opposite sex, these details of my internal dialouge assure me of my humanity. Certainly, it is the less beautiful side of humanity, but it makes me feel human, nonetheless, and with this sense of humanity, a promise to the near-permanent end of lonliness is created.

I've also come across the percieved need for some sort of... belief, in myself. In conversation with my mother, the subject of faith and belief came up, and I realized how little I believe in, how little I have faith in. Even an atheist burns inside with a sort of cold flame, but, myself? There is nothing. Certainly, with this, comes a type of mental flexibility, but structure is needed for support, and, in the environs of society, I oftne feel as a jellyfish hauled up from the ocean bottom, all flesh and no bone. Hmm; the environs of society are over-rated, anyways. An egotistical statement it may be, but I say this: those who find difficulties in dealing with my, at times, near-total ambivalence are those I don't paticularly want to have dealings with me. This is what I tell myself. Self deception? Most theories and statements are, for they ignore the richness of detail.

Still, life is beautiful, I find. Little things, like delicious egg rolls, or a tree painted in orange across my vision of the night sky; these things, and much more, bring me a sort of happiness that defies description (as many emotions do). I'd like to call these feelings my own, but I know others feel them, as well, whether it is in song or sunset (my frequent experience of them through uncommon stimuli is what causes me to theorize a different betweem myself and everyone else in this respect). Ah, such it is, such it is! Oh? Reality calls, and I must heed.

Haven't showered in a long time; I am sure that this grease building up on my scalp cannot be healthy. Talking with Jessica, and she became edgy when talking about children, talking about abortion. I asked her why she would not get an abortion if she accidentaly had a child, and she told me, ""It's my mistake; I should live with it."" It struck me as a foolish thing to say, but, then again, everyone has their foolishnesses. I believe, at least. I am not sure if my weirdness about romance and the like is foolishness so much as it is abject confusion. New Years' Eve party , tomorrow. All my theories about self mean nothing at certain times, except the most important, and that theory is that my perception of myself is highly coloured by my mood, even if my perception of the world is relatively unchanged. I am currently pondering over whether sexual infidelity or romantic infidelity hurts me more, and how much it might hurt me.

""Because I am addicted to lacrima (my lute, you know)... it is late, but I can play quite a bit better. Before I put it away to-night I kissed it down chassis and across strings, my lips randomly enfolding the corner between the soundboard and ribs, then breathed in the scent of the rose and expelled it back into that glorious chamber. You know the sound of slightly, ever sparsely moist fingertips sliding down strings? Sometimes I think I get too carried away... for I breathe like a madwoman in the desire to make love to a being of rosewood and metal.""

Agh. More reasons to torture my foolish heart over Katie. So far, today, it has been painful, but lifting. I must ponder on the nature of my self created pain; it may not be enjoyable, but I feel I must revel in it. For the most part, I am a sensible and logical person; why I allow myself this foolishness, there must be a reason. The stupidities surrounding females in my social life, I believe, must be my manner of keeping alive, keeping human. It may seem an exagguration, but it certainly fits well into my conception of self.

I must remember not to be upset when Eden never speaks with me or tries to communicate with me in any fashion. I must remember the discussion I had with her, when I basically said, ""Being around you makes me sad"". Her actions are out of caring for me. Oh, and I must admit to myself, I am jealous of Murray, in the same way I was jealous of the other fellow. She once gave her unwavering lurve to me, and now she gives it to others; I took said thing for granted, and to have it removed... hurts. On another topic of romantic neurosis, Across Five April's ""A Year From Now"" reminds me a lot of Katie. Just like Train's ""Missisipi"". Just like every damn song I listen to can, after a while. That girl helped me fuck myself up something beaaaaautiful.

It's been an uneventful past couple days. I've been skipping out on get-togethers with my normal group of friends... I don't really like being around them, as a group, all that much. Too many games of Halo and Halo 2, too many sojurns from callan's room to go and see if anyone of interest is online. In the absense of stress from work and school and the like, I find that I am being happier, on average, at least. Of course, I'm still my emotional self.

Last night, talking with Alex, he mentioned how he, Eden, Cayley, and Anna went off to do something, and I felt this... hurt welling up in me. As illogical as it was, I felt quite angered by the lack of inclusion I have in that group. Regardless of whether or not I want to be around them, I want them to want me to be around them. I enjoy being wanted (not so much needed), and the feeling that I am liked is a grand one, indeed. Cayley has always seemed to enjoy my company, but she hardly ever seeks it out, which causes both a conflict of messages in my own, limited sense of my social world, as well as being a small wound to my ego.

A mere 77 hours until I am gone from this place, and I shall be glad to go, indeed. Never mind that the weather in my new place will be worse than it is here, with snow and winds that make the weather here seem paltry in comparison. I pray I am happier with my social life there than I am with my current one. Then again, in my view, this social reality is looking a lot like a wounded pack animal that is about to have the predators of distance and the scavengers of time fall upon it. Par usuale, I am still having difficulties talking with Eden. My concept of her is so confused and contradictory in my mind that the best solution is just to be gone with her, and hopefully never speak seriously with her again. Even seeing her signed in, not talking with me, hurts me; at the same time, I know she is a pain in the arse, and that her presence in any social situation causes me at least a small degree of strife. Ooo. I must catalogue that away as a good reason to not be upset that I was not invited out with Cayley. Hey! Maybe that is why I was not invited out. Cayley knows my presence makes Eden uncomfortable, and vice versa. Since she was also hanging with Alex and Anna, who are better friends with Eden than they are with me... eh, fuckit. I understand it in my mind, now, though it arises new questions, as always, and doesn't answer the one of ""Why doesn't Cayley try to hang out with me?!?""

I'm a sad, melodramatic blogger. Regardless, I believe I shall not depress myself further with painful and unfruitful pondering on my current situation. I doubt anything good will come of it.

I find that I try far too hard to understand myself. Much of my thought is concentrated on trying to discover the mechanics, and the cause of the mechanics, of my own processes. It is a difficult task, for I seem to a be a person of a highly chaotic nature, and how I feel and think one moment is no clear indication for the next. Much of this pondering, as of late, has been devoted to how I function in the matters of romance and sex. The best I can come up with is ""not very well"". I can say for certain that the idea of dating does not appeal to me, and ""asking someone out"" is a process that I don't paticulary like going through. It seems trite and pointless, to me. Better to engage in conversation, I believe, but I am not sure if this an effective way to garner romance. Even this slight issue is highly conviluted for me. Sex is a whole other thing. Sometimes, I hate the idea of it. Other times, it seems like a good way of entertainment. Yet, even now, when I would kind of like sex, I can remember that, after sex, I often feel dissatached with the person who just fucked me. To be honest, I have never fucked someone I romantic-type loved; Eden and I fucked a little while after I fell out of romantic-type love, and Robin... that was just gruesome, and I hope that we can give screwing another chance before she goes. Crushes and romance are also difficult things, for me. Sometimes, it seems that any pretty female will do, but my definition of pretty is, well, badly defined and atypical.

I believe it to be foolish to become frusturated ove rmy lack of self-understanding. It is better to accept that what I am is whom I am; I shall fix errors in cognition as they come around, certainly, and I will always stive for a greater degree of mental clarity, but to become angered because I cannot clarify is counter-productive.

The last days have been stressful in the completion of school work, and the further considertaion of the odd things in my life. I think, in a mild way, I am falling for Mellisa, a friend of mine from Texas. She has little self confidence though... but she makes odd observations, and has this sort of quriky beauty about the way she thinks. Alas, my internet capabilities will be limited when I get to university, so I must limit any romance I might have online. Ah, and Whitney; this is an odd situation. I do not know whether we will live together this summer (an unlikely event even in its first stages). In fact, this summer is an ill-defined area for me. I pray that I will not spend it at home, is all.

I could go on further, about Rob and Kyla's sister, Kelly, or about my always-dimming view of Callan, but these events are unimportant in the light of my absence in three weeks.

I am starting to believe that I am an emotionally unstable individuals. It seems to me that how I feel one day is no good predictor of how I feel the next. Today, for example, I woke up OK, felt good after doing some work, slipped into neutral when reading, and after 'sex' with Robin in the secret office building space, kind of mneh. Walking to the college, I felt godawful, and went back into neutral once I got to class. I felt happy a bit after I got home, went to quite sad for an hour or so, and I've made a grand return to neutrality, right now. Of course, I can say each event had a cause, but eight signifigant changes in one day seems a bit much to me, for some reason. Oh, and sex with Robin was just ackward. Good foreplay for an hour and a half, put on a condom, we fucked for a minute or so, I withdrew to move to a more comfortable position, and I had to withdrawl a second time for some reason, and, by that time, my penis went soft, and it would not go hard again. Mildly embaressing. Ah, Samantha. Why must I have a crush on you?

Little was done; I fell in a blue funk, so to speak. I find that, on occasion, when I become sad, I start to think about Katie, and become even more so. For numerous reasons, most of which I probably do not know, I believe I still romantically love her. My mind refuses to remember her bad qualities, and celebrates her good qualities far too much. Ah, I could go on for a long time, but the theraputic qualities of confession have already been garnered, and I don't wish to talk about it any further, more out of impatience than anything else.

Waking up at 4 PM, it now being 8 PM, little in the way of 'portant activity has been done. I am feeling much less sickly, and will be able to continue on with updating. As an additional parameter of this journal, I believe that I will try to record the numerous stories that happen to me. Stories, for some obscure reason, are quite important to me. Not only do I like hearing others tell their stories (at least, as long as they are moderately well-told), I enjoy telling them myself. The Story (of my quite eventful 10 day vacation during the summer of 2004) has been told at least 4 times now, to various audiences; once, to a front-room filled with teenagers. I got a standing ovation, I believe. Or, at least, an ovation of some sort.

A new discovery, partially fueled by Robin and my snogging-and-then-some of the 4th floor of an office building. I am not a very physically affectiona person at all. Hugs aside, I am not fond of being near other people for the sake of being near other people. Though I enjoy the anticipation of sex, and the story-telling that can come from interesting sex, I do not enjoy the act itself, and could quite easily do without. I do not enjoy cuddling, either, or sleeping next to someone (though I am sure I have contradicted myself on this point, I believe that what I stated is the truth). This makes me a bad candidate for the current form of romantic relationship idealized in our society... and most of the variations, for that matter. What I do enjoy is talking. I enjoy this greatly. I could fall in love with someone, and have, many times before, purely based on who they are as told through what they say. I am not going to tout verbal communication as the only true and pure form of relationships, but I do prefer it.

I believe that this harkens back to my use of Yahoo! chat and, later on, MSN, as my main form of socializations. My first confession of love were though IM, and I've had at least three good relationships with people who live over a 1000 miles away from me, and whom I've never met in the flesh. This can profoundly affect how someone perceives romance and otherwise, and I do believe it has done just that to me.

It seems to me that, somehow, in the last couple of days, my quality of life has seriously degraded. To try and convince myself otherwise, I shall attempt to list negative, and then the positive, aspects of my current existence. Currently, I am ill; certainly, this is a temporary state of things, but it has come in the midst of the last weeks of school, when the majority of papers and projects are due. I have a fine old tradition of doing my papers a night or two before the class, for it has always worked for me. I do not have a  find old tradition, however, of becoming ill during the last weeks of class. These two conflict. Heavily. I missed handing in my time sheet, yesterday, which might translate on no pay check on Friday; a moot point, considering how few hours I got in the two weeks before last Friday. My job at the College... is not a good thing, at this moment. I have yet to organize some method of testing for my Research and Methodology course challenge; it is not forthcoming from my Psychology professor, though this is mostly fault of mine. After all, I have been skipping his classes almost consistently for a while now. I have not finished my Geography presentation, which was to be done in about 6 hours from now; I have, instead, decided to stay home. I am not sure why, seeing as my brain is having great difficulties processing, absorbing, or manipulating information, at this point. No sleep and illness tend to do that to a thinking machine. I would be looking forward to spending time at my house (alone) with Robin tomorrow, except my mom has been making a habit of going to work earlier and coming home earlier; in fact, she left at 6:30 AM today. If this trend continues to Friday, I will have about, oh, an hour and a half, if that, with Robin. This causes me great strife, for I was looking forward to more time with her than that. With the exception of the actual end of this godforsaken term, I have little to look forward to. For once, I am actually fearing finals, seeing as my studying has been lacklustre and highly spotty, this term, not to mention the stress this college job and my challenge credit is ending. Even at term's end, I still must spent my Winter break working on a 200 level correspondence Mathematics course, whose exam is in the middle of January, which is when I will be 'acclimatizing' to the university atmosphere. It is very hard to be optimistic, right now. I am, in my mind, putting forth an effort to be hopeful, and not succumb to a great deal of [negative emotion], but I fear I am failing. Ah, well; I shall continue to try, regardless. I am sure that recovering from this illness will help a great deal.

Can't remember what of much happened today. I am certain that things were done, I just cannot recall what they were. Talking with Andrew about happiness, and morality; I said that morality is unnecessary, and, looking at me, he quoted Kant (I believe) saying, ""One should act as if all one does is law."" I rebutted with this: if everyone acted as I did, and had the same reasons that I did for these actions, the world would be a much better place, indeed. After a moment or two of discussion, mostly revolving around what my motivations actually are, he agreed. Though I commit many amoral acts, molotoving coming to mind, few of these acts actually cause others suffering. It was an odd night of that sort of discussion. I also recall my pointing out of Andrew's morality, coorelating it with his misery, and he stated that he had little of it as well. I tried to counterpoint with the eating babies discussion from before, but he mentioned that it just... bothers him. I had to conceed at that point.

Certain chord progressions make me feel like no one person ever has.

Five hours driving to a one hour meeting reinforced the lesson of absurdity in my mind. I realize that time is not an asset unto itself, and that only through wise investment does it gain value... but damn. That was a mighty big investment. The cold bothers me deeply, even more so than the heat; one can argue that there is a limit to how much you can take off, but one can always dress for the weather, yet I feel more comfortable when overtly hot than when cold in the least. My sister, Kat, she disconcerts me. At 14, she's had many more boyfriends than I've had girlfriends, and probably already lost her virginity. It isn't so much such that bothers me, more that it highlights how much of a 'uncool' geek I am (yet, I revel in my geekiness). I do not fear for her at all, for she is a strong and, at times, downright cruel person. Combined with charm and actual physical power, and there is little that can stand in her way.

I do not know what to make of my current situation. I pray that it is over soon, and the stress, the demands, they all turn to stone under the rising sun. A lack of sleep is probably casing cynicism in me, for I do not feel right, at all. Discontent, and generally jaded. After this entry, I think I shall go to bed, and try to think of that which I can look forward to (I find hope cheers me when I am feeling ennui-filled). Andrew and I ate jelly-beans and talked of girls, as we often do. Little new ground was reached; only the old and familiar wargrounds of lost battles. Ah, well. I find life to be overall pleasant, regardless.

Went out walking with Callan. It appears to me that Callan has lost his, for lack of a better word, 'charisma'. Though I still love him, he is becoming highly aggravating, as of late. I shall be glad to be gone in 5 weeks; I do pray that living in dorms at university shall be better. I fear I've ruined Eden's ability to feel lurve toward other people. Lurve is the tingly happy feeling one gets toward another; what a crush becomes when it grows up, I suppose. Eden stated that her feelings toward her now ex-boyfriend of a week and a half lasted about... a day. I cannot help but feel responsible; over our year and a half relationship, I inundated her with reason and logic in all shapes and forms. Maybe, though this, I have helped her create 'logical' mental subroutines that prevent lurve. I no longer feel it, either; at least, I cannot recall feeling anything beyond crushes for the last while.

 Yesterday did improve greatly. Attending a birthday party, in my snogging with Robin publicly, I examined my disgust over public displays of affection. Though no substantial conclusion was made, I think it might result from my ideal of social situations as being generally removed from matters of a romantic nature. Where *that* comes from, I do not know. As well, I spoke much with Rob. Rob is a relatively recent friend, the younger brother of my long time friend, Jessica. In thanks at least partly to myself and Callan, Rob has come a long way, socially. From a general social reject, he has become... a social reject loved and welcomed by other fellow social rejects. 

Now, I feel slightly blue. Randomly, out of the van window of Andrew's, I saw a fairly pretty girl walking. Pretty girls hurt my soul, and I've yet to find out why. I feel it might be related to my odd (mis?)conceptions of romance and, to a degree, that which is sexual. I will profess to those who wish to hear that my pre-occupation with pretty females has nothing to do with lust (for I do not think lustfully of them), but I must admit to the possibility that it could be subconscious lust. Now, *that's* Freudian. 

Talking with Whitney, now. Why I enjoy talking to her, I do not know. She loves me much, though, and I've always had a weak spot for those who love me, even if the feeling is not fully reciprocal. Blasted distracting music; I find it hard to be coherently social when I am listening to music. I have, very much so, a music addiction. I have left parties to go home and listen to music, put off Eden in the past to listen to music, ect. I find that music makes me have emotions other people cannot inspire in me. Though I am not sure if I have state this before, it is worth restating, regardless: music can cause me greater pain than any traumatic event (and it is gone after the song ends), and music can cause me greater pleasure than the heights of romance (and I can play the song at my leisure). 

As a final observation, I become habituated to a lot of stimuli, social and emotional included, far too quickly for my own tastes. I tire of songs, of food, of places, of people with great speed. It would disconcert me, if it were not for my seeming ability to not become *attached* to these stimuli. I can move on with great ease, and find new things to replace the old ones. A horrible way to look at people, some might say, but that is their opinion. There is no meaning of any one object in life, beyond the meaning that the observer grants it. Life is not sacred, sex is not evil, death is not horrible. I take the meaning right out of life, and reassign it as I wish. At least, I would like to be able to do this, and, to a greater degree than most, I can. 

That is all."

I do not take stress well, espcially when self inflicted. I've been 'wasting' a lot of time trying to get my new computer working, when studying or doing other types of schoolwork would probably be more advisable. Robin didn't show up today. Such it is... I doubt I was going to get more than a bit of snogging out of it, anyways. Either that, or I use understatement and cynicism to alleviate dissapointment. Taking with Anna, who would be the shared friend of my ex girlfriend and myself, an attractive German girl with some emotional issues. And by some, I mean what appears to be a well above average number of such. Talking of social resouces, we were; how I prefer to invest a bit in many people, so that if one person becomes invalid in some way to me, it doesn not affect me greatly. Anna preffers to become very close to a select number of people. Certainly, in any other situation such resouce extraction would be foolish in the long term, but foolishness is not necessarily a bad thing, at all times.

Being around my mother in social situations is quite stressful, I find. Be it shopping or eating at a resturant, both of which happened today, she aggrevates me to no end. I believe it is a combination of our parent-child relationship, which has little room for the consideration of others, as well as her irritating personal commentary, which is often on the faults of the people around us, be they a shared opinion or percieved by her alone. Either way, I find such quite obnoxious.

Sleep is still odd. An uneventful day, where I took maniacal glee in kicking ass in a Geography debate when our team had what amounted to the losing side. I have an intellectually competitive streak. I also came to the realization that if I do, indeed, tryst with Robin, it is a highly wrong thing to do. Certainly, she is not the property of Callan, but it will hurt him, nonetheless. I am an uncaring person, at times. Andrew still expresses much distain and anger over his situation; I often feel like pointing out to him that he has control over his destiny, and if he truly wanted change, he could move away from his father's house and attempt to live on his own. I do not point this out because he will not listen, as he has not in the past, and he will become upset with me, as he has in the past.

Talking with Eden last night, I became upset over my lack of confidence in matters of sex and romance; quite upset, in fact. Yet, when I thought about it an hour later, such silliness was no longer there. I feel it might be a reactive thing; as in, such foolery exists only when it has to. Hrrm. Things must be done about this; I must think such things over, and expose myself to more situations where confidence of a romantic/sexual sort are needed. My tiredness, it is great. I fear for my health.

Slept far too much today; 14 hours of sleep cannot be healthy. OK, well, it was probably more like 12 hours broken up. Talked more with Amanda; what an odd person, indeed.

He will try to take control of the class once it has got out of hand, but wins more from pity than from forcefulness, for he has little in the way of commanding presence.

Also, had a very good time walking the foggy streets with Andrew. Andrew is a short-time friend of mine, for we've known each other for... err, about a year now, but we're fairly tight. There is an interesting story of how we became friends, and it revolves around two weeks straight where we kept on bumping into each other in social situations. Andrew and I talked of the Scottish, in a humorous context, and did a lot of plot for an imaginary radio series called, ""The Scottish Journey"". Good times all around. Andrew is a lost person; he has no plans for the future, at all. He kind of wants a girlfriend, and likes doing his pen and paper game design, but, outside of that, he just wants to have wants and plans. Sadness. 

And now, I talk to Mellisa, a girl from... somewhere, online. Mel and I have an odd friendship, which I don't fully understand; she is good to talk to, regardless. She reminds me somewhat of Stephanie, an old friend I don't talk to much, lately. Steph was also an online friend. I do miss her, but I don't feel like trying to become her friend, again; this is because she will not be Stephanie, anymore. People change, and unless you change with them, it is difficult to start again. Stephanie and I once promised that we would not fall in love with each other. This seems vaguely relevant. Would I fall in love with her, if I met her now? 

Ah, and now for Eden. Eden. My ex-girlfriend. I was looking forward to holiday sex, but with her new boyfriend, I fear I shall not be getting it. Damned.

That is all."

Talked with Robin online, of our upcoming tryst, for lack of a better word. She is the ex-girlfriend of one of my very close friends, Callan; Callan is far from being over her, for she broke up with him, and it was through a conversation on MSN that Robin and I established our shared attraction to one another. I feel no guilt over this, despite the great anger and jealousy I fear it will cause Callan when he discovers this. Robin is an attractive girl, and I do hope we fuck on Friday (for my mom will be at work, thankfully). This is my partially-ego-inspired expectation. I must remember to pick up condoms sometime this week. 

I have not talked to Whitney in a long time, I fear (well, a week or so). She is my only current online love; a very odd girl with a pain fetish. I cannot explain my love for her, nor I am sure that it exists, but there are plans we share, including mayhap living together come this summer. Though to some this may seem odd, I always relish the idea of living with another, regardless of how far they travel for such. If that is what she wishes to do, I welcome her. I would never move down to where she lives, though. Nay.

As well, I conversed with Amanda of her jealousy issues and other things on MSN. She is a distant friend, as well, whom I met during my RP days. She has an odd love/hate relationship with me, and I usually treat her with a professional sort of distance, though I do care about her. She, as many of the females in my life, has problems.

That is all."

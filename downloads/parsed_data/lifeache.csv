I have officially gone insane.  I don't know what the leading cause has been though.  Here's a list of the possible causes:

- I'm stuck at home all the time nowadays 'cause I don't have a car anymore.
- I work 14 hours a day, 7 days a week for my own business that I created about 3 weeks ago.  I basically sit online and create artwork and websites for bands all day.
- I might've had 3 sober nights in the past week and a half.  I'm drunk most of the time 'cause my friends always bring over alcohol.
- I've gone fuckin crazy with my comedic band, Strokanoff, here recently.  Just take a look at the website I've put together for Strokanoff.  www.geocities.com/strokanoff

I'm too tired to type anymore tonight.  Maybe I'll get back to this later.  Maybe I'll get some time away from work long enough to do something else.  Peace

"event","I think I'm done making entries in this livejournal of mine.  It just seems pointless to write out my life story in this thing when I can't tell who's reading it, if anyone.  It just feels like i'm talking to myself, day in and day out.  I'm just not looked at as ""insane"" by doing it like this cuz my rambling is published online so others CAN hear/see it.  I had some poetic outro. for this thing earlier when I was trying to make this post from a friend's house, but after I was finished typing it and clicked 'post'... it didn't post cuz livejournal was dickin around with their servers or something.  So... so much for my poetic departure.  For those of you I actually talk to online via MSN/Yahoo/AIM, I'll catch ya later.  For those of you who never converse with me online, good bye.

"event","Wearing these non-prescription sunglasses all the time is jacking up my eye sight.  Seems like everything's tinted now or somethin, and I don't even have them on.  Oh well.  Anyways, that's not what I was posting in here for today.  This post was to update the few people who might actually read this thing on the current events.

As you know, if you read the previous post, Chantel and I are no longer a dating couple.  It's only been this way for less than 72 hours, and I could've sworn this morning, by the looks of it, that Chantel and Luke had somethin goin on between them already.  I'll just say this.  They were sleeping on the same bed and looking a bit closer than how ""friends"" should ever sleep together.  Everyone who was in the house and awake was under the same impression, and I didn't even have to say a word, so I know it's not just me being jealous or anything.  Well, later in the day, Phong and I talked to her about what was going on there.  She said there's nothing going on between them nor will there.  That brought some ease to my mind.  We just need to talk to Luke about this and get his side of the story still.  I know what he said a couple days ago when we talked about things before her and I broke up, but I just wanna make sure he's still got the same opinions and thoughts as he did then.  I can never trust a friend 100%... we're human beings with active minds; people change from time to time.  I just hope Chantel's not mad cuz Phong and I are so concerned about the situation. Things going the way they went this morning will cause Luke to lose a lot of the friends he has over there.  He's a good friend to us, but I dont know... Sometimes he's just too free with himself for us to allow certain girls around him.  Too much damn drama, but hopefully everything will work out for the best.  Chantel, if you're reading this, I just want to let you know that I don't think anything negative or horibble of you after this whole episode.  I already talked to you about that one ahead of time, so you know where I stand; I love you, and I know you didn't mean anything by allowing all that to happen the way it did.

I'm just fuckin tired of being the scarecrow, but I can't ever shake that away from my existence and being.  Need a reminder of what I mean by being the scarecrow?  Take a look at these lyrics.  It's the song that dictates my existence.  I know I've posted it before, but it's due to be posted again... so here it is:


""Scarecrow"" written and performed by Ministry

staring in the face of condemnation
laughter fills the sky instead of rain

live my life alone in resignation
arms outstretched for those who cannot see

scarecrow

crucified and left in isolation
pictures of our lost morality

scarecrow

eyeless stares invite this whole damnation
rotting corpse of inhumanity

You people can't even begin to comprehand how much I've missed her, and what seems so pathetic about that is that we only went about 4 or 5 days without seeing one another.  It just seemed like an eternity.  That sands of time slip away at its slowest pace when you're all alone."

On the last hole, Trevor didn't even get halfway to the hole, and he hit a bi-passing car with his ball... shattered the right-hand mirror.  Being the guy I am, I just continued playing like nothing happened  X-D.  I never finished my game though cuz I hit my ball too hard, and it rolled out into the road.  They really need a fence there.  Those posts and metal cables don't cut it.  But yeah... so Trevor hit this car full of mexicans that didn't speak english.  After Trevor tried talking to them, they drove around to find a parking place, but DJ saw them rolling around the corner and said for us to just leave, so we made a dash for his car, loaded our shit up in there, and got outta there before they could catch us.  I don't think they even saw us leaving cuz a lady that was in the car went running down to where the accident happened, and the guy that was in the car went walking to the office at the golf course.  We should go golfing again soon... different course though.  :-)"

I would've made it there, but Chantel's car broke down last night while we were in route to DJ's so that I could sleep there and go to work in the morning with him.  I've been sittin around trying to figure out who could get me out there, and it just dawned on me that my mom's proposition is still available.  Had this shit came to mind last night or this morning when she failed to wake me up, I could've drove her to work, took her car to Empire so I could go to work, and then just bring it back when I got off work, but noooo....

There were times I wanted to update this but just looked at the screen all dumb-founded like that pic. with the Russian hat on my head.  If you haven't seen that, I'll try to give ya a link for it, if I can give public access to one of my image hosting accounts.  So... what's been happening?  Well, apparently Trevor and Lisa are an item now.  I guess they hooked up on Monday or somethin.  That's cool... I hope everything works out for them cuz they're both my absolute best friends, and I wouldn't want anything shitty to happen to or with those two, ever.
Oh yeah, about our trip to San Francisco... hahahahaha!  Good times.
Towards the end of our trip, Phong decided that we needed to go to Castro district.  Now for those of you who dont know what that is, it's a very large part of town that's really a concentration of homosexuals and bisexuals alike.  Everyone in our van wanted to get out and walk around the place to check out the sights except for Trevor because he was being a big pussy about it.  I'm not talkin shit about him here; just stating facts, so Trevor... if you read this, don't get all pissy with me.  Anyways, the guy didn't want to get out of the van cuz he has a huge fear of being hit on by numerous gay men.  I don't know what his problem is.  I'd think it's funny as fuck myself.  I've been shot down by gay men in the past, and a homosexual male prostitute tried to make a customer out of me for himself.  I don't fear the cock, but I aint no friend of it either.  Aside from making Trevor mad, we had a decent time, walking along the piers.  It was too damn crowded though.  We're gonna go back there again sometime but take different people with us... People who are more homophobic than Trevor X-D
I think Chantel was about to beat me up last night as I was making more homosexual passes at Phong over dinner.  I said somethin about how I'd still have gay sex with him even though I'm with Chantel (joking of course), and she just gave me this look like ""you better shut up before I shut you up.""  It was priceless.  You know we mean nothing by our homosexual jokes, love.  We're all straight here.  Alright, I gotta go and shower.  It's about that time again.

Chantel made it back in town yesterday, and we picked up Lisa who was 45 minutes late getting to the station cuz her train was slow with it.  It's all good though.  She's hella cool.  We're going to San Francisco later today around 3:00 or so.  Be out there until around midnight or so.  It's gonna be good times cuz I'm going with Brian, Phong, Chantel, Lisa, Trevor, and Luke.  I've never taken trips with this particular group of people, so it should prove to be an interesting adventure.  I've been to SF with Trevor before, but that was to go see Ministry, which fuckin rocked.  That trip was especially fun cuz Josh got us lost in the 'burbs of 'Frisco.  Good times, good times... Word, this is gonna be a sick-ass day, and you know we'll love it.

I was sitting here online, and I got an instant message on AIM from Waldwick police department in New Jersey.  The sarge wanted me to call him on the phone about Lisa's disappearance from Jersey.  So I call the guy up, explain everything to him, and then tried calling Brian to let him know the cops might call him as well.  There was no answer, so I go to his house, and there's a note on his door addressed to me.  It was from the Ceres police department wanting me to call that cop in NJ, but I already did, so I disregarded that note.  Brian wasn't home, so I came back here.  I get over here, and there's an e-mail in my inbox from Lisa's mom asking me to give her my phone number so she can call me about the situation.  About a half hour later or so, she calls up, and I let her know everything's alright, and that I'll see to it that her daughter eventually returns.  Now she's not freakin out so much cuz she's talked to me.  So!  That's been my ""excitement"" for today.

Aside from that, I've been helping my mom clean out the garage.  Her and her boyfriend are having some yard sale this weekend, so we're pulling all the shit out of there that we don't need or want.  What doesn't sale, goes to the dump cuz there's no way it's going back in there.  On a shitty note, my car's running like mega crap now, and I don't know why.  I'll investigate that tomorrow when it's light out.  Joy.

I'm home by myself once more.  Time to recap on the past weekend's events:
 - Jammed outta here Friday to hang out with Chantel.  We stayed the night at Brian's that night.  Prior to that though, I began to learn how to drive stick (finally).  It was good times.
 - Came home Saturday night after spending the day with Chantel.  Not too sure what all was going on that day.  My memory's fading on me here, so live with it.  I just remember staying the night here with Chantel that night.
 - Spent Sunday with Chantel's family.  That went well.  Also learned how to properly install IDE drives that evening.  Weee.
 - Adrian came over on Monday, and once Chantel got here, we continued to hang out until Brian got home from work.  Went over to his house for dinner, and odds are that the pizza's still sitting on the dinner table from when we left last night.  Poor girl was too tired last night and kept falling asleep, so she ended up sleeping here again.
 - Went to Riverbank High School today... I think they tried to send me to student supervision over there cuz I kept getting spotted by the same fuck-tard.  You're not suppose to wear hats on school grounds, but that rule doesn't apply to me cuz I'm not a student there... This guy kept mistaking me for a student.  Not much else has been going on today though.

I thought I was gonna be home last night, but Orlando called up around 9:15 and wanted me to go out drinking with him and Luke, so that's just what I did.  I only drank 2 beers, and then I fell asleep at Orlando's house.  Wasn't much goin on there, but I got to hang out with a couple people I don't see very often anymore at least.  I guess that made it all worth it... reuniting with my fellow negros... even though aint none of us is black.  8-p

On a side note, I think my mom finally gave up bitching at me about having girls stay the night here.  She never said a word to me about Chantel staying the night here Thursday night.  Weee, sorry that was completely random, as most of my posts are.  Fuck, I just sneezed out hella blood.  Might wanna check on this now.

I stayed the night at Chantel's house on Wednesday to keep her company while there wasn't anyone else there at the house to be with her.  Came home yesterday for a short while to shower, and we left again to go chill with her friends with Oakdale.  It was good times, but at some point, we left, came here for the night, and I heard my mom this morning talking to my older brother about me ""being sneaky"" cuz I had Chantel stay the night.  She always rants about me having a female stay the night here with me.  I had to hear about it a couple times when I was seeing Caroline.  Nothing new there.  Alright, I can't focus on this thing, so I'm gonna bounce.  Need to get the yard work done as well as a load of laundry so I can get outta here for the night.  Anything to avoid my mom.

"event","Well, that was quite a long weekend.  I just got home earlier today from being away from my house for the past 3 days.  I've been chillin over at Brian's with Chantel since Saturday.  Actually, since Friday, but we didn't stay the night over there on Friday.  I haven't been away from a computer for that long in quite a long time.  Moving up in the world, haha.  So!  Time to play catch-up on the current events.

- Friday:  Dan came over here and woke me up at 9:15 in the morning, but I was too tired to deal with friends, so I just let him in and went back to sleep.  Woke up at 10:30 to him asking me if it'd be alright if Chantel came over (cuz he was talking to her on my computer).  She eventually gets here, and the 3 of us leave for the day.  Whoopty doo.

-Saturday:  I get online, and Chantel's telling me about what happened to make her day shitty, so I had her come over here to get away from all the shit at her house.  We ended up going over to Brian's and just never left.

-Sunday:  Just another day of chillin.  Don't really remember what went on that day.  Oh yeah, I slept most of the day away.  Weee

-Monday:  Woke up and realized I'm not single anymore.  Here I was waiting around for a final answer from Chantel about her and I dating, and it was right there.  Didn't get out of bed until about 4 pm or so, and Trevor freaked out cuz he suspected ""things"" happened.  I thought it was funny anyways.  Didn't really do too much with Monday after that.  Just sat around watching Scary Movie 2 for the first time cuz I neglected to watch it before.  Later that night, the three amigos (Trevor, Chantel, and myself) played some Scrabble, and I got powned as Trevor cheated me out of using the word ""mows.""  What a punk... that would've been phat points too.  Oh well though, I lost by hella points anyways.

-Tuesday:  I finally came home at 6:30 this morning and passed out in my cozy bed.  I know my mom's gonna give me shit when she gets off work cuz I've been gone so much.  Oh well though... I'll probably be gone quite a bit this week as well.  Not so much, but yeah... Alright, I gotta peace out now.

A while back, there was a poor guy living in poverty, and he wanted to get drunk one day, but he didn't have enough money to buy alcohol.  Well, he got the idea to buy a gallon of gasoline and a gallon of milk.  His idea was to mix the two as a cocktail to get drunk cuz gasoline has alcohol in it.  So he goes to the gas station and buys his two items, goes home to his house that's being heated by a fireplace, mixes the two contents, tries to drink it, and pukes in the fire.  He incidently pukes gasoline and milk into an open flame, that shit spreads, and burnt his house down.  Smooth"

"event","One week later... I finally return to my livejournal.  Well, whats been crackin?
I've been hanging out with Chantel for the past week or longer, and as of last night, we both admitted to one another that we like each other, so we'll see what develops there.

During the past week, nothing has really been going on.  Thats why I haven't updated.  

On Saturday, I went to a LAN party over at Brian's house.  However, I didn't get to do any gaming cuz I was busy conversing with the homies.  I had Chantel there with me, so that was all good.  These dumb kids over there got ahold of the webcam on my computer, and just wouldn't quit recording stupid shit.  I about had to kick some ass up in there.  .... Dammit, I lost my train of thought.  Well, anyfuck, I ended up passing out at about 6:15 a.m. the following morning with Chantel there, but i woke up at 9:30, and she was gone... found out later what happened there.  Details not important.

I went to work on Sunday for my brother with Trevor, and sometime after we got off work, we hit up the Taco Bell where our friend's ex g/f works, and I talked to her for a bit there.  I thought she hated me, but apparently not.  After that, Luke came over.  If you're familiar with the past couple of months, you'll know things haven't been too settle with him and I cuz of the whole Caroline issue, but we're completely cool with one another, and it was just like old times all over again, so weee.  Trevor, Luke, and I went to pick up Chantel that night, and we just hung out here until about 3 a.m. when my mother came outside and bitched at us for keeping her awake, so we had to leave.  I think I'm safe now though.

I didn't do shit yesteday... what a sec... yeah I did.  I finally saw Amanda after her 5 month disappearence from the Modesto area.  I love that girl to death... even though I incidently hit her in the head with a plastic hammer.  Sorry hun!  Didn't mean to do that.

Last on my list is today.  I went back to work today with Trevor to chop down 3 bushes at a customer's house.  That was a tiring one hour & twenty minutes, but it's done with.  I gotta get up at 10 a.m. tomorrow to go with my mom to some place on the boulevard to turn in an application.  Joy."

The desperate-for-attention pop star commits every fashion crime in the book at the ""MTV Bash,"" even renting out her backside as advertising space for designer Patricia Field. Meanwhile, Brit's off-the-shoulder ""Flashdance""-y shirt takes an uninspired dig at the New York Post's Page Six, and her Warhol-esque tights pay lip-service to bad taste. Toss in her Playboy-ish rhinestone bow tie, tacky stilettos and *N Sync-ish fedora and what we have is an outfit not fit for pole-dancing, never mind the red carpet."

I couldn't use her actual screen name in the song though because it's too long.  Plus... it's a privacy issue.  Yes, I hate the person, but I'll give her the respect of not using her name in the song... mainly cuz I wouldn't want someone out-right dawging me like that.  Treat others as you would like to be treated (I know; old advice).  Anyways... here's the song:


""I Hate You Whore""

Hey SexyGAL1504
16 female from Flor...
Da, your so fucking dumb you make me sick
All you want is some cyber dick
Your crabs are like viruses to my PC
Your text reeks of drying fecies
Redneck trash, F.L. slut
It's quite obvious you take it...
up the butt
From your brother, incestuous lust
This rectal mating is a must

Be gone you whore
I want you out the door
I hate you whore
I can't stand you anymore

Damn SexyGAL1504
You just keep coming back for more
Cock on your mind, there's nothing there
The holocaust of what's in my underwear
Snot dripping out, boogers on your lip
You'd just turn off the horniest dick
Dumb bitch, I'm gonna tow your trailer
Into a river, I'll see you later
Good bye bitch
From the park, you'll disappear
You drowning is music to my ears

Be gone you whore
I want you out the door
I hate you whore
I can't stand you anymore"

I cannot drink anymore, I need relief
I cannot think anymore, I need to drink
But I can't take another swig of this pain
It's soon to break my ribs and drain my brain
	
It hurts so fucking bad I can't control these spasms
convulsive, involuntary twitching, I know just what happened
But like a vicious cycle, we go round and round
Take another drink until the epileptic deafening sound
	
Won't you please fill this seizure cup?
Merchant of murder, won't you fill it up?
Come on mother fucker and give it up!
Won't you please fill this seizure cup?
	
Former book of knowledge tells me not to persist
But it does me such good, I just cannot resist
You'd think we'd learn from our previous actions
But no sir, they just keep on hagglin' and askin'

Merchant of murder, won't you fill it up?

I had to get up at 7:30 this morning to be down there at 8:30 just to sit on my ass until 11:40 when I went home for lunch... went back down there at 1:10 and got outta there at 2:30.  All I did was sit there in the jury assembly room, bored out of my mind.  What made it so much crappier is that I only got 2 hours of sleep this morning before I had to be up.  Gah Dammit.

Another complaint...
I had to help my brother move yesterday from about 1:00 to 8:30 last night.  I really hope I'm done with that.  Moving sucks ass, and I'll be doing that myself here in another week or two.  Moving out of my mom's house and into Brian's house in Ceres.  Weee.

My final complaint for the night...
So I'm looking at the weather forecast for the next few days, and it's gonna be getting up to about 106 or 107 (F) degrees by about Thursday or Friday.  That's terrific.  I love the heat.  Can't ya tell?  I hope I'm not at work on Friday... I mean, I'd like to be working, but not doing my training for Osh in 107 degree weather.  Fuck that."

"event","this has turned out to be one slow night... after I ended up losing a game of chess that took an hour, there hasn't really been anything to do.  I think it's time to just go out on my nightly walk.  Maybe by the time I get back, there won't be such an abundance of wiener online... the dudes-to-hoes ratio is just lookin real uneven right now.  I'll be back in half an hour or so to see what's goin on with shit..."

"event","I was bangin on my guitar last night, and I think I came up with a new style of playing... and if it's not really new, it's new to me at least.  I'm all playin my 6 string electric like it's slap bass but with the distortion on, and at the end of every other measure, i bust out some real short hammer-on solo.  It's kinda funky, and it sounds really weird when I play it with the wah pedal instead of the distortion.  Maybe I'll use this new technique in my next demo... who knows.  I know one thing though... playing slap on this guitar hurts my thumb."

"event","won a free stewart copeland brass and steel snare drum from music central so im pretty happy about that...i love its distinct sound. other than that lifes been pretty fucked lately and everyone i thought i could turn to has the wrong things to say or pays too close attention to the wrong things...or just blows me off completely. pretty funny me talkin to myself since i have no friends on this thing pretty much since no one i know here really has one that i know of, so im not too worried about people readin my shit (not that i really care anyway) oh well ill just keep pushing and pushing til ive got nothin left. it all falls down. im becoming more anti social and leary with my trust as the days go by and im trying to resist it as much as possible and become my regular self again...though im not too sure now as to what that is. eh oh well some people have it much worse so i guess i shouldnt be talking."

"event","im tired as hell right now bout to go to sleep, feelin really pessimistic, and dont give a shit about anything right now. ive decided that from now on im just gonna not give a shit about anything except like maybe...2 things i care about and love..they know who they are and what my other love is. i try to be nice and help people and fuckin be a good person, but it just gets thrown back in my face and people take advantage of it, like a fucking napkin...a napkin. use it for what you need then never look back. Fucccckkkkkkkkkk!!!!!!!! all i know is i better not wake up feelin this way tomorrow or im gonna just throw my fist into that wall, or the first thing that bothers me...i just dont care anymore.i cant express the hatred i have for people sometimes and the way they choose to be. lifes too short to be a fuckin idiot, so let people know everyday that you love them, and always let your enemies know youre not gonna ever take their shit. even the smallest little act of kindness, could brighten someones whole day up more than you could possibly know. all i ask is that people are nice and respectful to me, and ill be the same back...but thats just too much to ask from some people i guess"

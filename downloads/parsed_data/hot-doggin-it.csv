So it is yet another day wasted, sitting around this house after sleeping the day away. Sleeping to ease the time. Sleeping to quicken the pace of life. Sleeping so when I wake Im closer to something. Something... but what? What is it that I have to wait for? Another day of sleeping. Another night of work. Another night of school. Another night wasted where human contact is boiled down into casual hellos and meaningless goodbyes.

I find myself reserved these past weeks. Quiet. Not that I am afraid to speak, no not that. I have nothing to say.  Off in my own little world but still here among the rest.

But...
and there is always a but, isnt there?

I also seem to be coming out of it. Coming out of what? I dont know. Its like stepping out of your house after being snowed in for a few days. Those first few breaths of cold, crisp air fill your lungs and you feel reborn. Renewed. Alive. Isnt that what we are all looking for in the end? To feel reborn. To feel alive. To feel invincible.

There are some things that are always with you. Ex-lovers behind your eyelids when you lay your head down and try to sleep. Closing your eyes, thinking that maybe, just maybe you will be safe for once. Safe from the questions of what if and why. Safe from the overwhelming sense of lonliness and loss that snakes its way into your throat, curling up into a tight ball and making its presnece know as you try and choke it back.

Then there is that one moment........ (another ""but"", if you will)

That one moment where eyes meet and coy smiles are exchanged. That ""accidental"" brush of the hand. Its at those moments that your hope glands start to leak. Seeping down your eyes and into your throat, dissolving the lonliness into the pit of your stomach.

Its these moments that we thrive on. Its these moments that are too few and far between. Shallow breaths and butterflies in the stomach await those few moments. Like an old friend waiting at the train station for long lost best friend to step past the conductor, eyes meet, memories come flooding back. The person standing before you is a now a stranger but you know deep down that there is that bond.  Of times you had and times you wish were still the present but always looking to the future.

Yeah. Its like that."

"event","My neck is as sore as a Vietnamese hooker on a sailor's payday. Gah. I think I slept funny last night.

Oh well.

Today I am hoping to get to the mall. I need to buy a dress for the Christmas party on Friday. I guess I should be more concerned with finding a date, but bah. I couldnt trick any boys into going with me. That and most of the guys I know are already going. So I am going solo. It should be fun. Then I dont have to worry about anyone else. I guess.

This party is causing a lot of unwanted drama. I wish things didnt work out like they did. Its hard to see two people who act like they are ""together"" but one acts like that when it is convient for that persons respective self. I know, I have been there. Its hard to not grab that person by the ears and yell that they will not find anyone better nor anyone that is willing to put up with all that bullshit. I guess it will take a lot for any realization to occur.

I guess that is the way that works though. It is my belief that two people cannot be in love with each other at the same time. It sucks, yes, but if there is not challenge, no threat of losing that person... what keeps one coming back for more? Nothing. Even so, there is a fine line between what is healthy, normal  behavior and what is self destructive. The line is so fine that it may even be said that love is self destructive.

I dunno.

Im enjoying my new job. Yes.

I want to go to a show! Damn it. Why is this area so desolate and devoid of culture, arts and music?

I will now create a list for Christams. Even though i dont do the whole ""reason for the season thing"", its nice to give and recieve. To be a catcher and a giver... wait... what are we talking about?

-GOOD band shirts. Youth large. I have to be able to fit my boobs in them.
-Horror movies, more specific, those with zombies.
-Books. About anything. Except mystery and romance. I wont read them.
-mittens,scarves,hats...anything knit and proper for a crack addicted bag lady.
Random info:
- I have a strange attraction to shiny things.
- Im fond of the colors: pink, brown, cornflower blue and avacado green.
- I will never scoff at a present, particularly a gift certificate.
- Lavender is a nice smell. Patchouli is better and sandlewood is nice.
- I like random things. If any of you saw my old apartment or my room, you know I have an eccentric taste.
- I get giddy over Lord of the Rings.
- Indie films are sex in a box. Stranger the better.

That is all.

Maybe I will do some shopping today as well. I havent started yet
OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH Maybe I will go thrifting! eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee <3 old people clothes.

This is from a friend of mine's journal, blog, whatever they are this week. Im quoting it because it couldnt ring more true:

""even though deep down, I've probably been the same person all along, I still feel like I've had several lifetimes already... each one defined by relationships I hold... in the last 6 years, those relationships have primarily been of the romantic type... when one ends, I heal and I soon become a different person, having learned from mistakes or whatever... but I don't feel like I really healed properly from one... I'm over it in the sense that I'm not still in love, nor do I hold any ill will toward her, nor do I really have the same concerns now that I did then... but every other time, I've healed and gone on to be a slightly stronger and/or better person... I've felt like the same person for roughly the last year and a half, even throughout another relationship and the aftermath of that, I'm still the same person I was a year and a half ago... emotionally, an uneasy combination of scared little boy and bitter old man... I think in some ways, I've always had that duality, but it's been magnified lately... I've given up any real hopes of someone coming along and saving me or fixing me or whatever... yet I still have some sort of hope that keeps me going... hope that someone will understand and will be there when I need them, and eventually, in such a supportive environment, I can become a better person, shift into a better state of being, and stay in said better state for a nice extended period of time""

That about sums it up. I need to shower and go to the dreaded mall."

hahhahahahhhahaa BOING!
Wednesday El Jimbo, The Bearup and myself went out to kareoke night at La Pub in Rome. It was more fun than you can shake a stick at. The Bearup, stricken with the illness, left early. He sang 2 or 3 songs like a rock star. El Jimbo and I went on a kareoke rampage. Among the many songs we sang, including the ones with The Bearup, here are a few: Men Without Hats- Safety Dance, The DeVinyls- I touch Myself, Billy Joel- We can start the fire, The Clash- Should I stay or should I go?, Air Supply- Im All Out of Love,. Hrm. There are more but I cant think of them right now. Im tired. 
On the way home El Jimbo had the door open while we were driving down the highway. He was going to nail one of those construction cones ""Im gonna get that fucker"". Ok, El Jimbo.

Yesterday afternoon Val took me to visit her friend she went to Paramedic school with. He pierced the back of my neck. Yay.

Wait, like what?

Last night was super fun in the sun. We ate at Red Lobster and went to JohnnyPants house to watch Napolean Dynamite. Awesome movie. It was a very fun night. Sorry, Val... I didnt come drink with you and Alex and The Bearup. Hope you cats had a chill time, yo.

Allllllllllllllllllllisooooooooooo-ooooooooooon, I know this world is kill you."

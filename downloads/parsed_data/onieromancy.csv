"event","Interesting. (:

Your Existing Situation

Sensitive and understanding but under some strain; needs to unwind in the company of someone close to her.

Your Stress Sources

The situation is regarded as threatening or dangerous. Outraged by the thought that she will be unable to achieve her goals and distressed at the feeling of helplessness to remedy this. Over-extended and feels beset, possibly to the point of nervous prostration.

Your Restrained Characteristics

Feels that she is burdened with more than her fair share of problems. However, she sticks to her goals and tries to overcome her difficulties by being flexible and accommodating.<P>Feels that she cannot do much about her existing problems and difficulties and that she must make the best of things as they are. Able to achieve satisfaction from sexual activity.<P>

Your Desired Objective

Has an imperative need for some bond or fusion with another which will prove sensually fulfilling, but which will not conflict with her convictions or sense of fitness.

Your Actual Problem

Depleted vitality has created an intolerance for any further stimulation, or demands on her resources. This feeling of powerlessness subjects her to agitation and acute distress. She attempts to escape into a substitute world in which things are more nearly as she desires them to be."

"event","I have a half an hour to write this before I have to go outside and shovel snow with my brother. Shoveling snow with my brother isn't really shoveling snow with him, it's me doing the work while he stands around and complains or plays in it. At least, I'm assuming, given his behavior when it was time to rake leaves.

Anyway.

So, I have a gerbil. I bought him on the weekend after my birthday, and so he's what, two months old? He wasn't a baby when I got him, he was fully grown, so I seriously have no idea how old he was. He could be three months, six months, a year, or more. The average life span for a gerbil is one to two years. Okay? The first month was fine. Mom hated him, but he was playful and fun and happy, and he liked being held and he didn't bite me and we got along really nice. And then come December, he started biting me, and I mean, real bites. He drew blood, okay? Not cool. So I stopped picking him up, because homie don't play that.

And then he started trying to get out of his cage. It's a 10 gallon tank with a screen lid, so I put some books on it. He would just jump up and hit his whole body on the screen, and it was annoying. He would seriously go at it for hours. And then he would hit the water bottle, too, which was metal and plastic, and which made a REALLY annoying smack-clank sound. So, I was trying to get to sleep two nights ago, and he kept doing it, and I was about to take the bottle out, when he stopped. So then around five AM, he does it again, so I remove the bottle and replace it later in the day. I change his food and water once a week, because that's what you do with gerbil. Enough said.

So today my mom goes into my room and is all ""He's dead, you killed him, you got your wish. There was no food in there.""

A little node in my brain cries out, BULLSHIT. Not that he's dead or that I got my wish (I never wished Dobby dead, and he was a little curmudgeon if there ever was one, but I'll admit that I wished Apollo would just run away or something), but that there was no food in there. I fed him on Wednesday. She said there was no food in his bowl.

Well, duh. Gerbils and hamster and little rodents, what do they do? They hide their food, for fuck's sake. Check his bedding. Er, well, don't, because I didn't clean it last week. Anyway. Now she's going off on this big ""He suffered and that means nothing to you!"" tangent. She's also saying that he didn't just drop dead.

Well, au contrair, Dobby dropped dead. For all either of us knows, he could've cracked his head on the god damn water bottle. I think that's some kind of poetic justice. But I'm not going around throwing some huge party because he's dead, which is what she probably thinks I'm doing. I don't want an animal to die, especially one I'm taking care of, no matter how much of a pain in the fucking ass it was. But seriously, I've had too many animals kick the bucket on me to get all upset about one I didn't like all that much."

"event","The car accident still fresh in his mind, Jerry woke up knowing he was dead. 



    The fact that he woke up at all told him something, but there were some very important details that needed to be filled in.  Looking around, he found himself in some kind of enormous hall, white walls off in the distance, a white ceiling hundreds of feet above him, some sort of lush beige growth stretching out beneath his feet.  Huge structures filled the place, alien but oddly familiar.  After a long moment of staring at one fuzzy monolith he made an bizarre connection:  furniture.  There was his sofa, his easy chair, his coffee table, all blown up to the size of office buildings. 



    It was his living room, only much, much larger.  This knowledge allowed him to get his bearings, in a way.  The chairs and television were where they ought to be,  and the thick growth on the floor suddenly made sense interpreted as his highly regrettable shag carpeting.  The only things that didn't fit were the numerous scratching posts and an extensive piece of cat furniture that filled patches of what should have been empty floor. 



    The cat furniture, an elaborate system of perches, ramps and hidey-holes that stretched almost to the ceiling, was much bigger, and presumably more expensive, than the piece he'd bought back when he'd had a cat.  Why make such a large but detailed replica of his apartment and fill it with cat paraphenalia he'd never owned?  The fact that is was scaled to a cat the size of a Greyhound bus only added to the mystery. 



    Jerry scratched his neck thoughtfully, or tried to, and was faced with an even bigger surprise.  He looked at his hand, which for some reason had only four fingers and an oddly inflated look to it.  His other hand was the same, gray and rounded with three raised lines down its back.  His glance dropped from his hands to a cartoonishly paunchy body.  He saw that he was wearing what appeared to be a butler's uniform, rendered in soft rubber.  Running his hand down his front showed this assumption to be wrong, and nearly sent him into a panic.  He wasn't wearing anything at all.  While it felt slightly numb, the tactile sensation he got from both his hand and his torso made it clear that this was his skin -- rubber pressed and dyed into the shape and color of a fat body in a tuxedo, with an odd give to it that suggested disturbingly that he was hollow.  Raising his hands to his face, he found what feeled like a blunt snout, huge oval eyes, and two ears the size and shape of dinner plates on either side of his head.  Everything was soft and rubbery, and it all reacted to his touch in such a way as to leave no doubt that they were his.  A little cry of alarm escaped from his mouth, which came out sounding very much like the noise a rubber squeak toy makes. 



    A shadow passed silently over Jerry.  He turned around to face a pair of beachball sized yellow eyes, and the mystery of the giant cat furniture was solved.  The beast looked down dispassionately at him and spoke. 



    ""It's about time you got here."" 



    Scooter.  A calico.  Died three years ago.  Kidney trouble. 



    ""What... what...  what...""  Jerry squeaked. 



    ""It's been a long time,"" the cat explained patiently ""But I knew you'd end up here eventually, with all my other things.  Good thing you're here now.  I was starting to get bored."" 



    ""What do you mean, 'your things'?  What's going on?  What happened to me?"" 



    The cat blinked slowly and sighed.  ""You remember how I used to rub my head on everything?  The sofa,  the scratching post, the walls...  I was rubbing my scent on them.  That's how I marked things that belonged to me. All of the things that are mine are here now for me to enjoy, just the way I want them to be.  That's how it works.  I thought everybody knew that. Anyway, I rubbed my scent on you a lot because you were my favorite thing of all.  I must say, though, I like you a lot more like this than the way you were before."" 



    Jerry could only stare up at her in response. 



    ""Anyway, I'm hungry.  Go to the kitchen and get me some fish.  After I eat, we can play.""  The cat yawned, showing teeth like white knives. 



    ""I'm so glad you're here now, Toy."""

I don't know why my dreams are bad, but maybe I should stop reading so much. Eh. I feel so out of it.. I miss Gary and I miss Joanie (and everyone else, but them most of all) but feel afraid to call or something in case they're like, ""No, we hate you, loser!"" but they wouldn't do that.

Shit, I know I had something to say in this entry, and forgetting it makes me sad. The weather is crazy. Tomorrow I want to call Gary because I haven't seen him in fucking forever and it seriously makes me upset. I'll probably send Kris' letter tomorrow or maybe Friday, so he gets to his place before the letter does, just in case, you know? Right now I have $17 and want to go buy a book or a magazine or some coffee. Usually money doesn't burn a hole in my pocket, but it is now, for some reason.

Haven't seen my dad in almost three months. That's weird. Umm .. What else?

"event","I don't know what's wrong with me. This summer has pretty much been me having shitty dreams and acting like a fuckhead towards everyone I know. That makes me sad, because I miss everyone, but I'm afraid to actually do anything about it. Last night was Kayly's party and I didn't want to go because I was afraid of not knowing anyone. And I didn't know anyone, and it was awkward, but okay because Michelle was there and so was Johnathan. Really, I don't have a damn clue as to what's wrong with me, and just.. Yeah. The thing about it is that it's probably nothing, and that after writing this I'll perk up or something. Well, hopefully, anyway. A summer spent inside reading and sleeping isn't much of a summer at all, but I don't want to bother anyone. How stupid does that sound? Anyway, time to get off this machine for now."

"event","I'm going to try and make this entry as eloquent as possible, but I really don't have a way with words (or etiquette, for that matter), so it probably won't work.

There seems to be a rumor of sorts going around that I'm a raving drunk, and that I find no pleasure greater in life than going home, cracking open a cold one, and vomiting all over my person, only to laugh and say how great it feels to be drunk.

Well, let me start by saying that I've never been shit faced, off my ass, puking all over the place-drunk. Ever. I don't drink to get shit faced, and I don't drink to drown away my problems in a river of alcohol, Or what the fuck ever people do. (-1 eloquence point, there).

And with that said, I don't drink often. I did last night, and if it matters, I am right now. I'm not knocking back vodka and tonic or jack daniels, because <b>I don't drink to get drunk and feel cool about it.</b> Are you hearing me?

My family is very open about alcohol. They don't really shove it in my face, but they're not some uber-fascists about not having their children drink. My mother and I will mix drinks from time to time and sit and watch a movie, and laugh and be generally stupid. We do it without the drinks, too. We're honorary members of the Idiot Girls Action-Adventure club, by the way. 

So, for all you people who are against it and seem to enjoy climbing on my back (and for those of you who have left my back free and clear of all monkeys), the question I've heard a million times before is:

<i>But why do you drink in the first place?</i>

And I could give you a million reasons. Because it tastes good, and it does. Because I feel like an adult in a way because my parents did it (I won't lie), or maybe because in some deep part of my psyche I enjoy the buzz and feel a little more comfortable. I don't know.

That's my reason. I don't know.

Why do you color your hair? It's been known to cause skin cancer.
Why do you play on your computer? Ever hear of carpal tunnel?
Why do you smoke? It's called lung cancer.
Why do you play so many god damn video games? Go outside and play a sport.

To everyone who finds it their perogative to chew out my ass about this, bite me, okay? I don't care if you're straight edge, I won't 'peer pressue' you into drinking and I won't drink around you, even if you're in my house. It's called having respect for someone else. I have it for you, so shut the hell up and leave me alone.

Thank you."

<i>98% of the Livejournal population has done this goddamn meme about smoking pot. If you're part of the 2% that hasn't and you want to throttle the moron who came up with it because you're sick of reading 10,000 variations of ""I don't smoke or drink anything therefore I'm automatically much smarter than you, you stupid conformist pig"" every day, copy this into your journal.

"event","Most of the time, we show the worst of our attitudes to the one we truly love thinking that despite your flaws, they will love us just the same. However there are times their love for you is not enough to tolerate you at your worst moment. Or maybe it could have been enough, they are capable of tolerating or even liking your flaws its just all of a sudden they wake up one day and decide altogether to stop loving you and give up on you just because of the pride that they have in their heart.

Pride that deceives them into thinking that they are better off without you and that they will find someone better than you. But one day they will realize, the new person may not have your flaws but is also dysfunctional in other areas.

You can never find the perfect person. The person might be patient but can also be apathetic. A person maybe ill-tempered but is passionate. Not because they are quiet about their dismay or irritation toward you doesn't mean that they aren't feeling anything at all. Not because they are showing you dismay or they get irritated at you at times it doesn't mean that they don't love you. People have different ways to express emotions.

Love is always a choice.
To love is to choose to appreciate the good in the person.
To love is not to ignore the flaws but to see them but still decide to look at the person and not the flaw.
You do not base love on your emotions and feelings. Emotions and feelings can easily disappear with just a small mistake or an offensive word.
To love is to keep holding on even though there are fights.There will always be an end to every fight. You can always make up for it. But when you let love go, there's no assurance you'll have that love back.

I am happy because I know I have loved with all that I am. My love may not be perfect. My love may include irritation and unkind words at times. But my love is passionate, willing to see things through, willing to change and willing to forgive."

"event","After reading a couple of Coelho's books, I have made my first attempt to read a work by Marquez. I was rather disappointed with the book. I was expecting alot from Marquez because I heard of his other works such as 100 years of solitude. 

Its just a short novel, finished it in less than four hours at local coffee shop. 

In my opinion, the story was flat, a little aimless. It was like waiting for the narrator to die. I was looking for a page-turner. Instead, I just wanted to finish the book so that I'll be able to cross it down my list for the books to read for 2008. 

And I think it lacks reality. Narrator declares love for someone he knows nothing about, or may be few.You can't even call what they have a relationship. I am not wooed by his passion for her. I think the narrator is dillusional. His age gives him the tendency to create a relationship, to experience love for the last time or at least before he dies..

But I have to commend his writing, I can still see the legend that he was. Unfortunately, this is not enough for me.

I still plan to read ""Of Love and other demons."" I just wish I won't be disappointed this time and I''ll be able to experience Marquez's power in writing.

It sort of become a tradition for me. To tell you honestly, I don't really plan to get the planner this year. What I plan to do is design or jazz up the planner sterling gave to me. Its just that I don't go to starbucks that often ever since I started working. And also for two yearsm I've shared the planner experience with friends. During 2006, I was collecting the stickers with Aisce, Myrrh and Kate. Last year I was collecting it with alot of people, My college barkada- Mos, Drei, Kat, Jhena and my Sister. All of a sudden it hit me. I'm in a different situation now. And it makes me feel sad that its almost Christmas and I know I won't be able to do the Christmas things I do for the past four years. Like paskuhan, yes we will attend it but its alot different if you are no longer a part of it. I can't present my I.D. to get free food anymore! *sigh* Darn it! I hate getting old.

"event","an hour ago, i just woke up :) anyway, i had a strange dream. back in elementary, i hav a crush on this guy. we were classmates up to our senior year in high school. but during highschool i was no longer attracted to him to the fact that i don't even know why i had a crush on him. don't get me wrong, he is a nice young man. he's just not my cup of tea now. back to dream, some of our elementary and highschool classmates where visiting a house right across of us. this is weird because they don't even know anyone there.i was in my jammies, already lying in bed. we ended up hanging out together. when we were left alone for a moment, he said ""i love you."" just plain i love you, no long introductions or no reason why he loves me. and when we were left alone for another moment, he repeated the same word. but this time i said that we are jsut friends. after i said that and we started hanging out with the group again, my classmates were like disappointed or something. 

i don't know what's the explanation for this. but it felt good to find out that someone loves you and appreciates you. honestly, i haven't felt this appreciated in a long time, well only less than a year. but i'm thinking, am i always like t his? i mean whenever someone mustered up enough guts to tell me how he feels, do i immediately push him away without even thinking about it? is it the reason i'm eternally single? is it god's way of telling me that he's not the right one for me. is it a sign that if i finally felt like giving someone a chance immediately without thinking about it, it means he's the one for me. 

oh crap, i am overanalyzing again. i tend to that alot, according to people around me. hahaha. and that person who tells me that alot before just signed in via ym. what a coincidence. hi kate! you'll laugh when you read this. but you won't because you don't have an lj account."

"event","naalala ko nung bata pa ako, meron akong pang-ipt ng buhol na gustong-gusto. at dahil nga bata pa lang ako, wala pa akong pambili noon. piso lang kada linggo ang binibigay ni nanay sa amin. gusto rin iyon ng akin kapatid. naguunahan nga kaming makapag-ipon para mabili iyon. pero dahil mas matanda sya, mas malaki ang baong pera n binibigay sa kanya. pero kahit alam ko na malamang ay mauunahan niya ko, di pa rin ako huminto sa pagiipon. kahit na nagyaya ang mga kalaro ko na magmeryenda hindi pa rin ako gumagastos. sinasabi ko na lang na kelanagan ko umuwi ng maaga. at habang naglalakad ako pauwi, dinadasal ko na lang na sana ang paborito kong champorado ang nilito ni nanay. minsan, dumating ang kaklase ko na may dalang supot na puno ng mga stationery galing U.S. Padala daw iyon ng kanyang mga pinsan. Marami daw ang pinadala sa kanya kaya naisipan niya ibenta iyong mga ayaw niya. Ayokong lumapit at tingnan ang laman ng suot kasi baka may magustuhan ako at bigla kong magastos ang iniipon ko na pambili ng ipit. Tinawag ako ni Lyka, ""Sandra, di ba mahilig ka sa disenyo ng korona? Tingnan mo ito ang ganda, koronoa ang design. Kulay asul pa, paborito mong kulay iyon di ba?"" Kapag nga naman naglaro ang pagkakataon. Dati pa ako naghahanap ng ganun at ngayon di ko pwedeng gastusin ang pera ko saka ako makakahanap. Sinabi ko na lang, ""Ah, nagpabili na ko nun e. Baka biglang duamting iyong pinabili ko sayang naman.""

Bigayan ng report card kahapon, nangunguna sa klase si ate. Ako, ayos naman ang mga grado ko pero pangsampu lang ako. Masaya naman ako para sa kapatid ko. Ilang gabi din siya nagpupuyat para lang tumaas ang kanyang mga marka. Sana kapag nagpouyat din ako, magkakapera ako para mabili ko na ang ipit na gusto ko. Noong gumabi na, dumating si tatay galing sa trabaho. May dala siyang ice cream at pansit. Magdidiwang daw kami dahil parehong nakabilang ang kanyang anak sa Top Ten. Busog na busog kaming lahat. Sarap na sarap ako s tsokolateng ice cream na dala ni tatay. Bago matulog ay tinawag ni tatay si ate. ""Aisa, regalo ko ito sayo dahil nangunguna ka sa klase."" ""Ano po ito tatay?""tanong ni ate. ""Buksan mo na lang para makita mo,"" sagot ni tatay. ""Oo nga ate. Dali, buksan mo na,"" dagdag ko. At binuksan na nga ni ate ang regalo ni tatay.Mangiyak-ngiyak ako ng makita ko kung ano ito. Ito ay ang ipit na inaasam-asam naming dalawang. Ang ipit na hugis puso, na punung-puno ng makikinang na bato na kulay asul at puti. Sinubukan kong itago ang nadama ko. ""Anak, isukat mo. Tiyak na bag na bagay sayo yan,"" sambit ni nanay. Nang isinukat ni ate ang ipit sabi ni tatay, ""Bagay na bagay nga sayo yan. Alam mo ba na huling piraso na iyan. Wala na daw sialng ganyang klase ng ipit."" Pagkarinig ko ng mga katagang iyo ay halos madurog ang puso ko. Umaasa pa man ako na mabili parin ang ipit na iyo kahi na ibang kulay man lang. Mukhang walang patutunguhan ang pagtitiis na ginawa ko.

At sa ganitong murang isip ay namulat ako sa katotohanan na kahit anong gawin mo, may mga bagay na hindi para sa iyo.

                                                                                                                         ....itutuloy"

i was not feeling this good a while ago. i was actually feeling bad and i wanted to go home early. it was because of this freaking disminor. yes, i call it disminor. (dysmenorrhea in the real world). I usually don't have this because I'm an active person. But since I started working, I seldom if not never engage in sports. Maybe I should start playing football again. I don't know. It's a thing of the past for me now. There are nice and bad things I associate with it but sometimes the bad things are highlighted.

Anyway, I'm really starving now. Due to my disminor, I wasn't able to eat lunch well. And because of that, I called Manong and Manang Panciteria and ordered a turon for Marian, palabok for PJ and for the grand finale, a turon and palabok for ME!! Mwahahah! Hope it gets here soon. The excitment is killing me literally."

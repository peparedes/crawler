"event","I don't know what's going on with me. I have the sweetest man, even if he does drive me a little crazy. I have a fairly good job with possibilities, even though I'm stressed. I have good friends who care about me, but they don't really know me. Or maybe they do and everyone else just thought they did. I don't know if I'm a lazy, fat hypocrite or if I'm actually a worthwhile person. I feel so dissatisfied with life in general. I don't really have anyone I can rely on to be objective. Everyone here has someone that they want to bitch about. I don't know how long it will be until I break. 
I want to cry once a week, not just tears, but sobbing. I'm in a corner of a world i thought i knew, cut off from everything i had figured out. By the time i figure everything out here, it'll change again. Someone will hit me so hard that I'll fall off, and i won't have anything to hold on to this time. Returning to my world with my tail between my legs and asking forgiveness for all my transgressions is not something i can do. I'd probably go through with it in some manner or another, either from guilt or not being forgiven. I am sorry for what i've done. I fucked everything up just by trying to do the right thing. I gave the wrong help. 
Maybe i'm stuck. How horrible would that be. He's in there snoring, and i'm out here all but confessing that it's gone. I hope it's not, but at the same time I wish i could die just to get out of this. I don't even like myself. How could anyone else like me. There's no rhyme or reason to life. There's no method to this madness. ""The time has come to say goodbye"" takes on an entirely different meaning now. 
How badly i wish that i could take everything back and do it all over again. Start with kindergarten without being such an idiot, all the way to the end doing it all the right way. Or was it meant to be this way, with me being the go between for people i barely know, all the time saying the wrong thing to the wrong person. All I do is make people angry with each other. There's no way out except to dig, and i'm standing in a rock sided pit holding a plastic shovel. 
Maybe I just miss her that bad. I hope you didn't read this."

"event","So, it seems that everyone is mad at me for some stupid reason or another.  I just do not see where they are coming from.  All I tried to do was help them both.  But if they don't want my help, then they won't get it.  I'm honestly quite tired of being the laughing stock among my ""friends"".  Seeing as how I'm always wrong about one thing or another.  I know they're all watching and going ""What a fucking idiot."" to each other.  Why should I just sit around and take that?  Not talking to each other anymore was her decision, not mine.  Yes, I hung up on her.  I didn't really want to listen to her yell at me anymore after she said she that we're over.  She never accepted anything I tried to do for her anyway.  GODDAMN IT, it's not charity, it's friendship.  I have someone who loves me exactly as I am, and I have friends here who care about me feelings.  I'm more than happy to stay here in worcester and get used to city life.  I can always go back home to Fitchburg and smell the Earth and trees and every other wonderful scent.  I have to go back to fitchburg to get some furniture anyway."

"event","I must've done something terrible to someone somewhere that I don't know about.  I have to move all of my stuff out of my room and into the small room at the end of the hall so that my brother can get a bigger bed that he will fit into....he's tall.  I totally understand that, and it didn't bother me at all until I came home last night and my room was slightly more dismantled than it had been before I left.  Not a REAL problem, as Alex promised me that he would come to my house tomorrow to help me pack things up and move them.  Sweetest guy ever!  I'm mostly upset over the prospect of finding another job.  That's right, I got laid off today from my beloved job at RadioShack.  I must have done something bad to someone.  Oh well.  I'm not going to pull the disgruntled employee crap.  But Alex called the guy who got him his job.  Adam is supposed to call me either today or tomorrow about a secretary job in this general area.  ""Near Fitchburg"" is what Alex told me.  I love that boy!  Sarah told me that her mom has a temp agency as well, so if Adam doesn't find anything for me, I can talk to her.  Somehow, this isn't as bad as the last time I got laid off.  It hurts more, that's for sure.  But this time, I've got friends and loved ones helping me, being sympathetic, and giving me options.  Life is just better once you've stopped being a teenager.  I'm kind of mad at my eyes for crying though.  I tried so hard to hold it back.  Lol.....that never works out for me.  I'm lucky to have the man I love.  Condolences are very welcome.  lol.....emo-ness!  Pity me! Pity me!  PITY ME!!!!!  lol.  I'll be back on my feet soon.  I'm going to drink tonight at Sarah's house.  Hooray for drinking the pain away.

"event","So, let's see.  I left off when Alex and I decided that we were indeed a couple.  That was, as you may recall, a week after I met him.  It didn't feel like a week, though.  I really felt as though I'd known him forever.  

So, when we had started talking, (monday, i think it was.) we had made plans to go to this pool hall after I got out of work on sunday.  Well, since I'd been with him friday night, and saturday night we went to DI, I stayed with him saturday night as well.  Got up early sunday morning so I could get to work on time, then made plans for him to pick me up that night.  Honestly, I don't remember what we did that night, but I imagine it was something sexual, as that's our usual way.  

I stayed with him on Monday night, all of Tuesday, and Wednesday morning as well.  We spent a LOT of time together the next two or three weeks, but soon enough he had to get a REAL job, not just the wonderful website-building business that he's trying to get off the ground.  So, he now works nights in the town where he grew up, 4 pm to 11 pm, in a call center making out-going calls for an insurance company, asking people to send back their damaged wireless phones.  This job is five days a week, which means that when he gets out of work on Fridays, it takes at least an hour and a half for him to get here to pick me up and bring me back to Worcester.  Friday nights are very long nights for us.

Now, we spend Friday night, which is technically Saturday morning, together, followed by all of Saturday and a bit of Sunday morning before we leave to bring me to work.  Except, of course, for this weekend coming up, as Thursday is my 21st birthday, and I have taken Thursday, Friday, and Sunday off.  Since I always have Saturdays off, I have the entire weekend plus a little bit more.  YAY!

A couple of weeks ago, Alex and I decided it wasn't worth the time and money to go to the clubs anymore.  At least until I turned 21, I said.  So, this Saturday, I will be at Dark Intentions, a goth club in Lowell.  Every other night of the week, it's called the Down the Street Cafe.  If anyone would like to join me in my drinking, that is where I will be.  Thursday I will be at Resurrection in Nashua, NH, (main st across from CVS) but I will not be there with Alex.  I will most likely be at the Compound in Fitchburg both Wednesday night and Friday night.  Sunday I will be going to my mother's house for a short b-day celebration, so I will most likely not be drinking.  

JOIN ME!  I'LL BE DRUNK!

Anyway, even though Alex and I have not been together for very long, the relationship is still going quite strong.  I can't wait for the first fight and the make-up sex that comes after.

:-D"

"event","It really does take me fucking forever to update this damn thing.  Let's see.....I'm sure I noted working at RadioShack in here cuz there was a comment about my co-worker, Brendan.  He FINALLY broke up with that aweful girlfriend of his.  She showed her true colors again and he said ""BYE!""  From what I understand, he was really fucking nice about it.  I'm never that nice when I'm breaking up with someone.

On that note, breaking up is something I don't see myself doing for a LONG time, if ever again.  


Here's the whole story:

So, I went to Dark Intentions one Saturday Night back in early March.  The place was friggin' crowded, so Maggie and I are walking around the place looking for a place to at least put our stuff down where it will be safe.  So, I'm thinking to myself, ""I'm just gonna look hot and have fun, and maybe get me some phone numbers.""  Earlier that week (specifically the sunday before), I had given my number to this guy at the pool hall.  He and I talked for a few days, and then he said he ""just wants to be friends.""  Needless to say, I haven't heard from him since.  So, I'm looking for fun, not long-term bullshit.....(that would have been my mindset at the time).....Suddenly I spot a free chair.....well, a little bit free.....there was some stuff around it.  Unfortunately, the table was surrounded by people.  Well, I decided to be a little bold.  I walked up to the table, glanced around, and asked loudly if anyone minded if my friend and I set our stuff down there.  The people glanced around at each other, and one young man said, ""No, go ahead.""  So we set out stuff down at the table, grabbed our ciggabutts and headed out for a smoke.  When we went back inside, the people were still sitting at the table, so Maggie and I introduced ourselves.  The man who had spoken up earlier said his name was Alex, then introduced us to Anna, Kristen, Sarah, Curtis, and some guy whose name I cannot remember.  So, I sat with the group a little while Slightly drunk maggie danced her heart out.  Later on, when maggie grabbed me for another butt break, I was about to leave and Alex handed me a slip of paper, saying it was his number and I should call him if I felt like it.  I handed the paper back to him, whipped out my cell phone, handed it to him, and told him I'd lose the paper, he should put his number directly into my cell phone.  Then I walked away with maggie to smoke.  When I came back he had put my cell phone in my purse.  So on went the night, which included a waltz with a very drunk man (I could smell his breath) named Bear.  So ended the night of March 5, 2006.

Sunday, March 6, 2006, I decided it was time to bite the bullet and call him.  (Not something I do.....ever.)  I left a message.  He called me back the next day.  We talked for a few hours every day until thurday night, March 9.  That was the night I Called him from maggie's car to tell him he should join us at a club in Nashua, NH.  He agreed to do so, but needed to know the address so he could look up the info on howto get there.  This resulted in a few more phone calls, but did not quite pan out how we thought it would, since that particular club was not 18+ that night.  So, plans changed and we decided to go to Worcester instead.  We met up at a parking lot near a bar that maggie wanted to go to.  Alex had brought a friend with him at Maggie's request.  The friend was none other than Anna, quite a sweetheart, love her muchly.  Seeing as how I was not 21 then, nor am I now (that's next thursday), i was not going to be able to get into the bar.  Anna, Maggie, and Caroline (who I neglected to mention was with us on this trip) went to the bar, while Alex and I went to Sh-booms, which quite possibly the worst little club I've ever been to.  The music was way too high for us to talk, but i was very much amazed when he decided to pay for my admission.  Kind of a waste of his money though, we stayed for about 20 minutes.  From there we headed to Dunkin Donuts to talk, cuz we could.  My phone was on vibrate so I didn't hear it.  But Maggie called me from Caroline's phone a couple of times to say they were going to go to Denny's and that we should meet them there.  So, when we're done at DD's, we head toward that which we hope is Denny's.  When we finally find a denny's, we circle the parking lot, but they're not there.  But what if they show up later.....we'd have missed them.  So, we're sitting in his car while I keep trying to call caroline, but her phone is off.  They finally show up, saying they were late because Anna decided they would go by Alex's house to try to cock block him if we were there (what are friends for?).  We went into denny's where we talked for a little bit.  That is until he started to play with my ears and scratch my head.  Loved it.  We was just touching me in all the right places that night.  I had to step outside at one point to cool off.  I guess it was only fair.  I used him to hold myself up when I was taking off my thigh-highs, then I proceeded to sit on his lap cuz it seemed like it would be fun (bear with me, I was a bit tired that night, but I think it worked out quite well).  Eventually we all left the restaurant to head our separate ways, but not before Alex and I had our first kiss.  We made tentative plans for the next night, to go bowling in worcester.  

Ah, onto the bowling already are we?  I gave him directions to my work, and he promised to pick me up at 9.  Finally we were on our way to worcester.  We get to the bowling, request a lane, and I am finally introduced to his friends.....including his ex-gf, Megan.  She was not entirely nice to me, but Anna was there so it was all good.  We got our lane, and our shoes and began bowling.  This is when I discovered that Alex has a great appreciation for hips and butts, both of which I have in abundance.  So, to taunt him, I shook my booty quite a bit.  The bowling itself being less than important we stopped to eat, then I smoked and we bowled a bit more before we decided to hang with his friends for a bit before they closed.  Soon, it was time to leave.  But, me being who I am, I did not want to go home.  So I spent the night with Alex.  That was the weekend I had already planned to help Maggie move her stuff from her mother's house to Caroline's Apartment.  Of course, I would have needed to have Alex bring me there, so why not let him help in the process, since we planned to go to DI that night anyway.  So, Alex decided that he would help Maggie move, but he was only gonna do it for me.  We got that done, drove back to maggie's mother's house, and headed to worcester, so we could all get gothed up.  Then we were off to DI.  Shortly after we got there and I had hugged the people that I knew,  we were standing outside talking, and we decided then and there that we were, indeed, a couple, not just dating.

Well, kids, that's all for now.  Part one will take so long to read that I'll let part two wait at least a week.  Enjoy the silence while it lasts.  Part two is the mushy part.


Holy shit!  That's a lot of writing for just over an hour!  The time is now 6:58pm, and I'll have to try getting in contact with him soon.  Bye!"

"event","lol.....I bloody hate valentine's day.  And if you're going to comment with ""it's just because you're jealous!"" I've beat you to it.  It IS because I'm jealous.  There has only been one year in which I was in a relationship on Valentine's Day and he gave me a fucking YELLOW rose.  In case you don't know, yellow is the color of friendship.  i would have been less upset if the rose had been pink, or if it had been some other flower so long as it wasn't yellow.  I hate the color pick, but pink is the color of love.  Red is the color of passion, and would have been the best choice considering how our relationship was.  As much as i didn't want to admit it, there was no love in that relationship.  Passion was there, but not love.  Fuck there was barely even friendship.  I'd known him all of a month.  Meh.......One day......"

No boyfriend, full time job, no car, no time to go out.  I basically live a life of solitude except for thursdays and fridays when I hang with nick (thurs) and nick + mae (fri).  And then there's the random phone calls from Heather.  And Maggie called me today......SHOCKAGE!  yeah....I have SOOOOO many friends.  This guy from one of my myspace groups messaged me yesterday (AFTER i got offline) to say that me telling some hypocritical idiot what a hypocritical idoit she was was very good and that he'd like to be ""e-friends"" with me.....that's cool.  I've seen his comments in the groups forums, and i find him rather interesting as well.  So, that's all about that.  Anyway....i'm done now, cuz I've got a survey waiting for me to finish it.

"event","Seeing as how anyone who reads this is not going to know much more than what I'm about to say, I feel safe enough in revealing my thoughts here.  I work with either the hottest sweetie or the sweetest hottie in the world.  I'm not sure which he is more of.  I so desperately wish he could be mine for just one night.  How I could do so, I'm not sure, since it would kill me if he hated me after.  This is, of course, all hypothetical.  No matter how often he calls her a bitch, he still have a girlfriend, and he is strongly opposed to cheating.....thank the gods!  I hate cheaters.  Those damned idiots at work had better not change that about him.  They've already started turning him into a loafer.  Anyway.  I refuse to do what I usually do and claim that I ""love"" him......I know that's not true.  I barely know him.  But I know him enough to know that I want to know him better.  Basic function of dating, right?  But dating a co-worker would be a really bad idea.  Sleeping with one, however, might not be so bad.......maybe....."

I haven't been in the greatest of moods this week, and if I pissed someone off, I'm sorry.  I hate winter.  It makes me tired and bitchy.  I'm more likely to do something if I feel warm than if I feel cold.  And the lack of sunshine really fucking bums me out.  And yet, I don't really like to stay in the sunshine during the summer.  Just knowing that it's there is enough.  Well, seeing as how my cat is sitting on the keyboard, I think I'll wrap it up.

have fun."

Seeing as how I haven't talked to any of you in forever.  Whatever.  Working at RadioShack.  Loads of fun there.  We do get to play with all the new toys, but it's seasonal employment, so I probably won't be here for very long.  Which will mean I will have to get another job.  maybe, just maybe, I'll go back to Pizza Hut.....as a waitress this time.  I hate the idea of it, but you gotta do what you gotta do.

"event","So, it turns out that none of the big insurance companies have insurance for Massachusetts.  That's right.  Not Progressive.  Not Geico.  Not State Farm.  Why do I have to live in the ONE state that doesn't have any of these big companies who offer so fucking much.  Progressive auto insurance gives you their quote plus the quotes of the other big companies.  But not for Massachusetts residents.  This bites.  I'd really like to get my auto insurance from somewhere besides where my dad gets his.  Just like I'd like to switch my money to some other back or credit union besides DCU.  He doesn't need to be constantly looking over my shoulder now that I'm nineteen.  And besides that, DCU is really far away from the house and my job.  It's all the way on the other side of Leominster.  My car can't make it that far.  Which means that dad gets to deposit my check for my and be all nosy the way he is.  I'm so tired of this shit.  It's always whatever's convenient for him.  No one else.  And now Grampa has been here for a couple days and he's driving us BOTH nuts.  I didn't want him here in the first place.  He's been answering our phone calls.  Heather called on Tuesday and he didn't have the decency to let me know that someone had called for me.  I only found out because I saw it on the caller ID.  And this morning, he walked right into the house without even knocking first.  Not even a courtesy knock.  And there's no cute guys around to keep my mind off all of this.  Is it my turn yet to find someone I could really be in love WITH?  Not just I really love him or he really loves me.  A relationship where we both love eachother, and we can stand eachother's little quirks.  I need a guy who can live with the fact that Heather and I are as close as we are.  He'd have to be my shoulder to cry on should anything happen to her.  Maybe after heather becomes famous.  Maybe then I'll meet him.  And he can't EVER yell at me.  I hate people who yell at me.  And people who lie to me.  Even little things.  Telling me you used to work somewhere you didn't is only slightly less horrible that NOT telling me that you have another girlfriend somewhere.  There's a chain reaction in there, too.  Lying about, say, a five dollar bill.  What do I really care about a five dollar bill?  But you tell me that you don't know what happened to it when really you took it from my wallet.  Sure, you have every intention of replacing it.  But that fact that you said you didn't know what happened to it when you did is the big concern.  I really could care less that there's five bucks gone from my wallet, even if I find out before I'm told.  Just let me know, ""Hey, I borrowed five bucks from you."" Ok, fine.  But you don't tell me that and I find out.  Now i can't trust you.  I say, ""Lies about something I don't care about.....could lie about something I DO care about....shows lack of respect.....bye bye loser.""  I hate insurance companies.  I hate nosy parents.  I hate pushy grandparents.  I hate Liars!  yay! That's, like, everyone!!!

"event","I just went looking through my old journal entries.  I'm so embarrassed at my own stupidity.  Every time I find a guy I like, my head gets all fucked up.  I'm too possesive.  Why am I such a dork?  I keep thinking about all the horrible things I said about Ryan.  The whole time I was jealous.  There's no doubt about it in my mind now.  And now there's Shawn.  Really cute.  Really sweet.  But I know that even if he did ask me out (which is never going to happen), I would only end up ruining everthing.  I always do.  I scare guys away.  I'm just too needy.  I scared Seth away after 2 months.  Same with Dylan.  I think the only one who doesn't fit that profile is Zack.  It took me 3 years to scare him away.  No there is one other.  I didn't scare Rick away at all.  I think I actually got pissed at him for not being scared away and I broke up with him.  Not that I'd go back to him anyway.  I was getting quite tired of driving his ass around everywhere.  I just wish I could find someone who isn't very easily scared, but who also doesn't scare me.  It'll never happen.  I'm gonna die alone except for the million cats I will have in my little house.  They'll be my babies.  Each one will have a name from a fantasy novel I have read.  There will be a Raistlin and a Vidanric in every generation.  Time will not be short for me.  I will have many long nights to think about how horrible I am at dating.  And while Heather's out seeing this or that guy.  I will be sitting at home in front of the T.V. getting fat and petting the cats.  All million of them.  Yay for an overactive imagination.  I still believe I'm going to die alone.  I can't help but wonder if I'll ever get out of this house.  If I died tomorrow, would I haunt this house?  My life is a bore.  I work, I eat, I sleep, I work again.  I have to work for 3 hours today.  I'm not really supposed to work on Tuesdays.  But I'll go.  At least I don't have to close.  I hate closing.  I'd much rather do opening.  Am I boring?  I think I am, but DJ called me fun and interesting last night.  Then again, he also said I looked pretty, so how good can his judgement be?  Not to say that he's a bad judge of character.  I just happen to think that he's wrong about me.  I'm rarely funny.  I hide behind sarcasm.  Not even wit, just sarcasm.  The voices in my head are trying to make me feel better again.  This whole entry doesn't matter.  Nobody is going to read this thing all the way through.  I don't blame you.  It's rather depressing.

"event","I'm considering weeding out all the entries about ryan....It still hurts to think of him.  I no longer hold any anger towards him.  It just hurts in the pit of my stomach when I think about him or the time I spent with him, or the things he did to me.  Of course, it also hurts when I think about how I reacted. I am a girl plain and simple.  And now I'm getting the feeling that my relationship with Dylan is going downhill.  I just can't shake the feeling that it was never meant to be.  I'm not happy in the relationship.  Unfortunately, breaking up with him right now would be bad.  His friend and his cousin just died in an accident, so now is not a good time for more heartbreak.  The thing I find intereting is that now that I'm about to leave this relationship, I don't feel like I want another one very soon.  I feel now like I just need to figure myself out.  Maybe If I can learn to be happy just being with myself, maybe I can make myself into a better girlfriend.  If I can learn to be happy on my own, maybe the guys going off together won't bother me so much.  
Well, I've been charged with mowing the lawn, loading the soda rack, and cleaning the bathroom.

"event","So, I've been spending a whole bunch of time thinking over this one issue and I've come to a conclusion that is not really a conclusion.  But I guess I'd better explain the issue first.  Dylan and I have become really close lately.  Even after he said he liked me, I found I enjoyed spending time with him.  It wasn't until Sunday that I discovered how far it had gone.  He told me he loves me.  That's not the issue because I find myself liking him more and more as time progresses.  The issue is that he also invited me to live with him and some of his friends in Amhearst when he moves.  And the semi-conclusion that I have come to is that I really want to move with him.  And yet there's about a million things that we need to talk about before I do.  And that million doesn't include everything about the apartment.  He needs to know about how wierd I get around my time of the month.  He needs to know that I go nuts without an authority figure.  As to the apartment, I have, in my head, compiled a short list of extra expenses they or we will have to think about besides rent. Even if heat, electricity, and water are included, they still have to think about food, towels, dishes, silverware, a vaccuum, a broom, cleaning agents, phone bills, tv, cable if they get it...There's a lot to think about.  And jobs.  They need to get jobs.  I know Dylan and Randy are already thinking about the farms in that area.  This is a really big step, but I'd love to be semi-independant, cook for people who appreciate it, be able to do all the things I can't do at home.

"event","There are some guys that I just don't want asking me out.  Fucking, Nick calls me the other day to see what I was doing.  He was going to Boston to see a movie.  So, I went with him.  We were watching the movie and he put his arm around me.  So, I removed it.  We're waling through the parking lot toward the subway and he put his arm around me there, too.  He never seems to get the hint.  And even if he did, I still would not be attracted to him.  It's strange, but I kind of miss Dylan after that.  Anyway, we're back at my house and I don't know how to tell him to leave.  Then suddenly, he asked me out on a date.  Of course I said no.  It just irritates me that he still can't take the hint.  Three years we've known eachother.  He still doen't get that I don't like him and I never will.  
On another VERY weird note, I had a dream recently that Prozac punched my currently-non-existant bridegroom for yelling at me.  Wierd.  I had the impression that I was over that stupid little crush.  I know he's never going to want me.  And even if the only reason is that he saw how I was with Ryan, I can understand that.  I was a complete dork about it.  I still don't like to see him or be anywhere near him or see things that make me think of him.  I can do all of those things, I just don't like to.  That's just the way I am when I get hurt.  The way I see it, anyone who doesn't like it can kiss my ass.  That's the way I am and I'm not going to change.  So much for finding the right guy early.  Meh, he'll be right where I need him, I suppose.  Not where I want him, just where I need him."

Meh!  Anyway, Rico's been kinda wierd around me lately.  The other day, he wanted a hug from me and he held on a bit longer than usual. Then, today, Heather and I saw him and Jess going into Dunkin Doughnuts with Luke (I hate him!) and Mae (AKA Skud).  So, I turned around and we went to see them.  So, we walk in and he gives me this big hug and says he's not going to let me go.....wierd, huh?  He's sexy, but he's not my type.  He's your traditional tall, dark and handsome.  Why don't I like him?  Umm...He doesn't seem to have his life in order.  Besides, I like the chubby guys.  I don't know.  Maybe if he's not wirey, but he's still muscular, he could still be good.  But, at the same time, there's my feelings for Prozac to consider.  Can I do another guy while I have unrequited feelings for him?  Possibly.  I did Carlos while I was still pining over Ryan.  I think that did a bit to help me get over him.  I'll probably read this later and wonder when I wrote it.  I guess it's time to go.  I've ignored Heather for a while..

"event","I really need to find out what's going on inside Prozac's head.  And the only way to do that is to ask him.  But I feel so stupid about that.  It's Prozac!  How do I say, ""I really like you and I want us to be more than friends,"" to Prozac?!  I can't make stupid jokes the way he does.  I get nervous and fumble over my words and end up looking like a fool, not that I won't in this situation anyway.  I can't even get information from Paco about it cuz Paco ""don't know shit.""  Fuck this.  I'm too tired to think about it.  I'm going to bed.  And maybe for once I won't go to bed thinking about him.....Fat chance of that happening.

"event","So, I sat outside for a half hour tonight just talking to my cat about everything I've done, said, and written in various journals this past week.  It was oddly soothing.  That fact in and of itself is quite disturbing.  But I surprised myself with my thoughts.  I guess first and formost is that I'm truly worried about what I'm gonna end up doing to my friendship with Prozac by saying what I need to say.  I'm sure it's going to change everything between us.  My big question with that is: Will it be changed for the better or for the worse?  If only I knew.  But if I knew then it wouldn't be much of a decision to make, would it?  If I knew, then the decision would be made for me.  Then again, even if I did know, what about what the future might bring?  Heartache and pain, or true love and hope?  What miserable thoughts I have today: good or bad, heartache or true love.  Who thinks about such things on a daily basis?  I'm gonna drive myself nuts with these thoughts in the next few HOURS.  I couldn't possibly think like this every day.  Or maybe I do and I just don't want to admit it.  Maybe I just cover it up with half thunk thoughts of sex......Wow!  Tangent much???  So, other than changing things between us, what if suddenly he and I are...an item...and one day I decide I don't like something about him, but everything else is still good?  I'm sure I did it more than once to Ryan, and plenty of people could vouch for it.  Right now, Prozac is great, Prozac is sexy, Prozac is wonderful.  But at some point it will likely change to, ""Oh, I hate it when he does this, I hate it when he does that.""  And then comes that changing.  The kind of changing that so many women try to do to men.  I don't want to be that type of woman.  But I also don't want to seem like a nag.  Ladies, all two of you, we all do it.  The changing, then the nagging.  But the worst part, in my mind, the part I don't think I've ever gotten to, is the bickering.  I hate fighting with people I care about.  Especially the guys I care about.  I think that the worst feeling I ever had was when I got mad at Prozac for something he said to Jordan and Bill.  Heh!  Not that any of that shit matters now.  I haven't seen Jordan in a couple of months (nor do I want to) and Bill's trying to get me and Big Gay Eric to talk to his lawyer about a conversation between Bill and Casey that Eric and I oversaw.  Now, that problem with that is that I can't even remember what was said.  I was there only so that Casey would not get too freaked out.  I suspect that Eric was there for that same reason, but he's the type who might actually pay attention to a conversation like that.  I am an actress.  I stand there staring off into space while I pretend to listen to what's going on.  So, I got mad at Prozac and felt bad about it.  But he was never mad at me.  Never.  I think about him now and how silly he can be and I get the impression that under that calm, almost glazed expression, there's so much passion.  I know that, one day, it will come out.  But in what aspect?  Anger?  Sorrow?  Lust?  And towards who?  I care about him very much, and I truly want him to find love, whether it's with me or someone else.  But I hope it's me.

When I liked him last semester, it was purely emotional.  or maybe i just didn't dig into it enough.....proabably cuz I was with Ryan and I felt all guilty for it....now is see that the guilt was wasted on Ryan.  Prozac is sexy whether he realizes it or not.
He's sexy whether he cares or not.  I'm not sure if he realizes that I like him.  He might for all I know....he's a very private person.  Would he want me?  i really want him to....I want that sexy beast to be all mine!  He's working till 7 tonight.  Oh, if only he didn't have to work and if only Auntie Flo wasn't around!  I told casey today about my plan and she was laughing at me and saying it was cute....It's not cute....it's primal.....But I guess if it were anyone but prozac it wouldn't be so cute.  maybe it's just cuz she's such good friends with him....they're getting an apartment together and i think Paco'll be there too....it wouldn't do to have a prozac and a casey and no Paco....That just wouldn't be right!  paco's kinda sexy, but he's not Porzac sexy.....Heather thinks Paco's sexier....NAH!  But it's not enough for Prozac to be A sexy man.....I want him to be MY sexy man.  Primal Urges! Primal Urges!  Must resist these primal urges!!!!  Sudden urge to drive to jaffrey and jump on him while he's working.  But I can't! grrrrr!  Mlar!  I want him.  But I suppose I've said that already....in every journal I own in fact.....There isn't one place in my house that I haven't written about him.....GRRRRR!  I hate having school girl crushes and not being able to do anything about them....i don't know when I'll be able to talk to him......I hope it's soon....Well, I guess this crap has gone on for long enough....

"event","I have an Eddy.  YAY!  From all accounts, he's a really nice guy with a heart of gold.  But who knows.....I've been known to turn guys into assholes, or so it seems....Zack, Seth, Rick and Ryan.  But I think I'm at least making progress on that front.  Zack and Seth turned into assholes before I broke up with them.  Rick turned into an asshole WHEN I dumped him.  Ryan Turned into an asshole about five days AFTER I broke up with him.....Maybe Eddy won't turn into an asshole at all.  
And now for spectacular news.....I finally got that picture of Ryan in drag.  He he he....I'm considering finding a way to post it on here.....I'm just feeling all sorts of evil.....
I was soooooooo bitchy on Friday.....well, just to Ryan and Moo.....They wanted to see the picture I took out of Prude's stack because apparently someone took the other copy.  I told them I'd show them when I was good and ready.  So, I grabbed the picture out of my bag while Ryan was outside and I showed it to Moo.  Then, when Ryan came in Moo wanted to show it to him.....Now, I'm not the type to just let things go.  So I said, ""Ryan can ask me himself if Ryan wants to see it."" Moo goes, ""Just let me show him the picture."" Still I refused.  So Ryan comes over and says, ""I already did ask you.""  I looked him straight in the eye and said, ""So ask me again.  Cater to my ego.""  I loved it!!!!  And he had the stupidest response....""Can I see the picture.........again?""  Dumb-ass.  HAVE FUN WITH YOUR LITTLE HUSSY, SCUMBAG!!!!!!!!  HOPE YOU GET SOME NASTY DISEASES!  SERVES YOU RIGHT FOR BREAKIN' MY HEART!
Nah.....I'm not bitter at all.
Don't break Eddy's Heart, Artemis.....whatever you do, don't hurt him!!!!!
Just gotta keep tellin myself that.  
Those of you who ""really"" know me, probably don't realize what an active imagination I have.....I don't usually talk about my strange ""daymares"".  The most recent of these is that Ryan's little hussy is going to go after Eddy.  I keep seeing it play out in my mind.....Eddy likes the attetion she gives him.  He wants her.  I tell him to go for it.  (Oddly enough, every time he comes to me with this confession, I'm reading a newspaper. humph)  Then I end up telling Ryan that I knew she'd hurt him somehow.  And his face tells me that he wants to know why I didn't say anything.....
Here's the simple answer.....I DIDN'T WANT TO TALK TO THE ASSHOLE!!!!!
But, yeah.....that's my overactive imagination at work.  That's just the tip of the iceberg.......I'll tell you what, these puppies get a hell of a lot worse.
But that's a story for another day, kids.
So here's the bottom line.  I hate Ryan.  He's a huge asshole.  I've got the picture I wanted and I might put it up here.  I have a great guy named Eddy.  My imagination works way too well.
A toute a l'heure

I probably won't see Seth again, even at college.  And I doubt he'd show up for the reunions.  But that's why i love him, right?  
On another note, I spent my monday afternoon having sex with Ben..lol...he's really not that good.  So not worth the time I spent, but the experience was..so, yeah..."

"event","My life is empty without him....I've gone back to reading way too much and not doing what I should be doing.....Like my homework.  He was good for me in that respect.  i do miss him a lot.....like every time I see him.  But it seems that I am invisible to him.  he said hi to me once, a a while ago...maybe I was too quiet when I replied.  Maybe I should just stop analyzing and get over him.....but i don't want to.
gtg bye

"event","So I broke up with Seth a couple weeks ago, and now I'm thinking that it was a bad idea....I didn't even really talk to him about what was bothering me.....It may actually have done some good.  Maybe, if we start over, I'll be able to tell him things like that.....At least this time I gave him my rough draft when I wrote my apology letter.  I hope he's read it.....For all I know, he hates me enough to throw it away.  But I certainly hope not. He was really good for me...I was doing my homework.  I was keeping my weight off.  I wasn't eating like a pig.  i may have completely ruined myself.  I hope he can forgive me.  I want him back so bad.  We could make it work.  There was this line in ""The Mexican"".  ""If two people who are in love drive eachother completely out of their minds, When do you say enough is enough?""  ""Never.""  I liked that..... It seemed appropriate.  Well, It's lunch time....See you later.

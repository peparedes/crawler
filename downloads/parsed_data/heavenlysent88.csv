I think next years show is going to be really gay. Its like the wizard of oz before dorothy came along. Drum majors were who I expected them to be, Brent Chris and Tony. I think Mrs. Sleeper picked some bad people for officers, and others should have gotten it, but thats just my opinion. I kinda think there are more people than just me that think the show is stupid and the officers and stuff should be different. I dunno I guess every thing will work out to be ok.

I have a spanish project due on wednesday, I worked on it for 2 hours and I'm almost done. I'm caught up till the 5 in algebra, problem sets are due some time soon, I'm just falling too far behind. I have been so stressed and taking it out on people I shouldn't be. Today my aunt, mom, grandfather, and sister all decided it was pick on Melaine day, that did not go over too well with me. I am like in the worst mood ever, you say one thing to me and I bite her head off, spit it on the floor and then stomp on it. I am so stressed, I have so much to do and they all think high school is a breeze, news flash its not. When they went to school their classes weren't nearly as hard as mine are, people didn't expect so much out of them, most people didn't go to college then, there wasn't as much going on then. Michelle had it easy in high school, she took boom boom classes, I'm in all honors, I get like 1 or 2 easy classes a year. They don't understand how hard and stressful high school is and that sometimes I can't handle it, I'm not perfect, I can't handle everything. Blahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh"

Some of the people that made it are good, but then others that didn't make it definitely should have. I think the judging was rigged or something. We were talking about this at Chelsea's party, and none of us were really happy about who made it. I mean Kristen Ponte didn't make it, and she made it last year, every one thought for sure she would make it, I think she should have. I think Chelsea should have made it too. And some of the people that didn't make it definitely shouldn't have, but I don't want to say who because I don't want to hurt any ones feelings. Well thats just my opinion on it, and hopefully we will end up with good drum majors, but its not looking too good."

"event","Ok today was really good, until like 30 minutes ago. I got along with every one in my family, Chelsea's party was a lot of fun, I haven't laughed that long and hard in a while, I was feeling a lot better, every thing was good. And then my sister and her lovely boyfriend come to pick me and caitlin up. I don't say anything to him, I never do, I will just be talking in general and he will have some smart comment to say to me, he threaten to give me a swirly and to help my sister beat me up... um yeah theres no way I'm going to like him. My sister is sooo mean to me when hes around, she joins him. And then she complains to my mom and yells at me when I don't even do anything. Any one that has been around me when hes here knows I try really hard not to say anything back, but thats not me, I'm not one to just sit there and take it, I'm not a push over, I say some thing back, but my mom had asked me to try not to since Michelle is like in love with the retard so I haven't said anything back. When he says something I will just be like, um sorry I wasn't talking to you, thats all I have over done, and thats like twice. So I got yelled at by my sister, for like 15 minutes, and then my mom for another 15 minutes, and then both of them for a while. I seriously hate my sister. I never cuss and I just want to like cuss her out all the time. She is so mean to me and I don't do anything, and heaven forbid that every once in a while I actually do say something. Her boyfriend is such a mean, controlling, retarded, fat, ugly, bald, jelly donut eating, cop wanna be. And my sister, well shes a lot of things that I won't say because I try not to cuss, but she is a slut, stupid, retarded, ugly, mean, push over, and does what her boyfriends want her to do. Ughhh I can't stand her. I hate how my family can ruin my day in a matter of seconds, I absolutely hate it, I wish they all would just go away, and my friends could be my family."

"event","I should go to bed, but I don't feel like it. Lately I have had the  ability to make people mad, and I don't even mean to. If I made you mad, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to and I don't even know what I did. 

My sister is making a scrap book for my mom, and I was looking at all the pictures, and I wanted to cry. It was scary, to realize how much I have grown up, and changed, and how everything else has changed so much. I really miss how it was, when everything was good. I miss it so much. In the pictures every one looked so happy, theres one of me sleeping on the couch with my aunts dog, and I look so safe and happy, and its completely the opposite of how I feel now. Pictures are said to be worth a thousand words, but I think its much more than that. Its funny how such a small and seemingly insignificant thing can make you think, and experience so many emotions. It doesn't take much for me to start thinking about something, but I didn't really expect it to bother me this much. I saw myself grow up over the years, and all the memories that I had put out of my mind came rushing back. You know how in school you would sometimes right about where you want to be in like 5 years or 10 years, well I started thinking about that, and I think I have ended up in a totally different place then I wanted to be. I think its a good thing, but at the same time a bad thing. I like some parts that are different from what I thought, but others not so much. I feel like some where I let some one down, or maybe I let myself down. I feel like I lost a lot, and I now have an emptiness that will never be filled. But I also feel like I gained some things, but never enough to fill the hole. I wonder where I will be 10 years from now. I will be 26. Maybe out of college, or still in college, or married to wonderful guy working at a great place. Hopefully some of the people in my life now will still be in it, some people I don't know what I would do with out and I can't imagine not having them in my life, because they made such an impact. No matter where I am in 10 years, I know I won't be a failure, and I won't have 5 kids living with a drug dealer who uses me. In 10 years my hole still won't be filled, but I think I will be where I want to be. I think I have grown up pretty decent so far, and I think I will continue to, and I have a lot of people to thank for that, yes even the ones that hurt me so much, and put me through so much. Life is definitely difficult, but I think I'm doing ok, looking back on everything. And who ever said life is just one big game, was totally wrong, its no where near being a game. You can control a game, change the rules, make it all go your way, but you can't do that in life, and you can't just start over when you are losing. You do get some chances in life, but you never know how many, and when they will run out, so you have to make the best of the first one you were given because you might not get another. Its amazing how something that seems unimportant, can make you think of so many important things.

Today was a pretty easy day, not much going on, slept for a while, I seem to be doing that a lot lately. I have also been kinda... bitchy I guess is the word lately, I haven't felt good, and when I don't feel good I'm not in a good mood, and when I'm in a bad mood, I have very little patience, and thats just not good because there are a lot of retarded people at king, and then I take it out on other people, and I just have been really touchy lately. For the past couple days it has hurt to breath in deep, like a dull pain, and I haven't had much of an appetite and I think I have had a fever on off, but I rarely show that I don't feel good, I just try to ignore it and hope it goes away, because I can't get sick. I haven't told my mom about my lungs hurting, because last time I ended up with bronchitis and phenomena and I had to get shots and go to the doctor and miss all this school, so I'm hoping if I rest a lot and take a lot of medicine I will get better. I told my sister about my lungs (in case I die or something, I want some one to know there was something going on and I just didn't like all of a sudden die, or if something else happens and I can't say that my lungs hurt) and she was like have you been smoking and I was like yeah... thats me favorite thing to do *rolls eyes* and then she was like have you been making out with any guys and I was like no HAHA. Ok I'm done now, I'm going to practice breathing and see if I can get my lungs to like stretch out or something, they feel tight, yes I'm retarded."

"event","I will admit that I have some major mood swings. But sometimes I can't help but to feel that people deserve it. Some times my mood swings are provoked by things, even the smallest things, and other times its for no apparent reason. I think the reason why I have theses mood swings is because I have experienced so much emotion in my life, and a wide variety of it, and most of the time I just keep it inside, but then it over flows resulting in mood swings. The smallest thing triggers them, sometimes its really annoying. Lately its kinda been affecting me more than normal. I can't focus on anything for like more than 5 minutes, I am definitely slacking in my classes, my head is just stuck in the clouds, but its so nice there, but every one once in a while I come back down to earth, and its not good there, so I like staying in the clouds, but it makes things worse, but as long as I'm in the clouds things are ok, I hate coming back down to earth. The clouds are nice, I don't have to think about anything, I don't have to worry about anything, nothing can hurt me there, until I come back down to earth and realize everything that is going wrong, and how far behind I am. Its just not fun. And what makes it worse is I think I can control everything, and I can't, so when I realize that, I just go back to the clouds."

Shes in Disney world right now, I hope she is having a bunch of fun, I wish I was there. I might go to down town disney tonight, but its a very slim chance, especially now that I have to go to my dad's wife's daughter's son's birthday party at like 5. I don't like any of the people that will be there, except for my dad sometimes, and my step sister's husband, hes cool, he lets me drink hehe. I'm almost caught up with most of my homework. And I think I'm going to take AP chemistry next year... yeah I'm stupid but oh well I'm good at chemistry and I don't think Ms. Bachteler will be mean to that class because it will be like super honors and they will probably behave better. I've been trying really hard lately to not think about things and to not let every thing bother me, but its getting really hard. It seems like every time things settle down something else happens and it just makes me think and worry and get stressed out, and I think its starting to effect my school work. So I need to work on that. Other than that every thing is ok, for the most part, there are some things I'm a little worried about, but I hope every thing will just work out soon so I can stop worrying about it. This has been extremely random.... I was just writing the thoughts that came to me, I have such random thoughts, I think thats why its so easy for me to zone out and lose focus.

I don't think its fair that I have to have 2 separate birthday parties. One with my moms side and one with my dads side. I don't think its fair that at every birthday party some one is missing, and they always will be. Birthdays will never be the same for me, so I just don't want anymore. I probably sound stupid to you, you are probably think ""whats wrong with you, you get 2 birthday parties, you are closer to getting away from parents and doing whatever you want all the time"" But I don't really see it that way, I would trade it all just to have one birthday the way its supposed to be. I'm like split on it, I'm glad I'm growing up and stuff, but at the same time I'm not. I know I'm definitely ready to get away from here, and I guess this one step closer to that."

"event","People are starting to really make me mad. My mom just told me she doesn't trust me, what did I do to make her think she can't trust me. She doesn't trust me, so I'm pretty much not allowed to do anything for a while. I was supposed to go to Yorks tonight, I might still go, but I don't know. I don't understand why my mom doesn't trust me, I haven't done anything bad, I rarely lie to her, although lately the lying has been a little more frequent. Blah I'm so confused. I really think I need to get away from the people here for a while. I feel like I'm falling in hole, and I keep going deeper and deeper, at first I liked it, and I still do for the most part, but I'm just confused, theres still the angel and the devil sitting on my shoulders arguing over what to do, and I think I know which one I'm going to go with, and if its a mistake, then oh well its a mistake, I will learn from it, and if I get hurt, then oh well, I will get stronger. I don't think I'm going to go to Yorks, I would if my mom would let me stay the night, but she doesn't trust me. And I don't feel very good, my head hurts really bad, its been hurting for like a week now, and I feel like I'm going to throw up, blah you can tell theres a lot going on, I only get head aches and feel like I'm going to throw up when I'm stressed about things, or worried. I need to take something, and just like sleep for a year or 2, and then everything will be better. I love how my mom talks about me to other people, while I'm in the other room, and thinks I can't hear her, it just makes me feel oh so good *extreme sarcasm*. She says I hurt her, and make her feel bad, maybe its because she hurts me and makes me feel bad. Maybe I need to go to a shrink. My aunt keeps asking me if I'm stoned, shes asked me that like every time I have seen her. That really hurts, never will I do drugs. Drugs helped turn my world upside down, nothing will be the same it was, they have ruined many lives, and I'm not willing to risk mine, and I'm not willing to risk putting my family through something like that. You know what else hurts, how my dad considers his wifes family part of mine. I have one mom, one dad, and one sister. His wifes grandchildren, are NOT his grandchildren. His wifes kids, are NOT his kids. Just like I'm not his wifes kid. I hate how my dad forces me to talk to her, she is the one person I hate the most. And yes, I mean hate. So many times I have just wanted to yell at her, and ask her why she even got involved with my dad, when she knew he was married, and she was married. Every time I see her so much anger and hatred builds up inside of me, like if I was the hulk, I would be the biggest, greenest thing you ever saw. Ok I think I should stop now, its just making me even more mad and upset and making me feel worse than I already do"

"event","I have been thinking a lot about church, and I really don't know why I go to my church. Most of the people are fake, the adults are too up tight and stuck up and blame you for doing every thing wrong, when really, most of us aren't that bad and don't do bad things. There are like maybe 8 people at church that I like and get along with, the other ones, I pretend to like and get along with. I don't get anything out of going to church. Every time I go, I find more things I don't like about, I find more things that I don't agree with, and I feel like I get pushed even further away. So I guess the only reason left to go is God. But I'm having problems with that. If I don't get anything out of going to church, and all it does is push me away, then why go. Maybe I should go to a different church, like one not so up tight, and the people are nicer, or maybe I just should stop going to church for a while. I hate to say this, but God isn't my top priority. I'm going through this phase, were I feel I need to put myself first, and find myself, and figure out what I want, I want to experience things, if God will never leave me, then why can't I wait longer to have him be my whole life, and my top priority. If you are going to tell me to stay at church, and to fully trust in God, and just live my life for God, you are wasting your time, I tried that, many times, and it never worked. Don't try to talk me into doing something I'm not sure that I want. I want to find my own way, I have to find my own way, thats the only way it will ever work. My whole life I have been told to be a christian, and do what good christians do, simply because I'm supposed to. I want to make that decision for myself, I want to decide what I should and should not do, I think I have done a pretty good job at that. If you think any less of me because of this, that is your problem, you shouldn't, but its your decision. And I understand if you do, I used to do the same thing, but no one of us have the right to judge some one else, thats not our job, you don't really know me, you don't know what I feel, and you don't know what I think, the only reason you know some things is because I just told you some of them. You are entitled to your own opinion, but if you are going to preach to me, please don't, you will just be wasting your time. I still believe in God, but I need to find my own way, I need to figure out what I want to do.

But its kinda more fun like that. I was going to try to go back how I was, a good girl that didn't do anything wrong and had extremely high morals, but I don't want to. I like the way it is now. I'm not wild or anything, I just want to have fun. I probably sound like a bad person, but I'm not. I was talking to someone about this the other day, and they feel the same way. We are just teenagers, we just want to have fun, and if it means making a mistake or 2, oh well, we will learn from it. Its not like we are doing anything that bad. And in case you're wondering, I will never do drugs of any kind, so don't think that. I don't know if I should be saying this on here, some people will probably freak out and be like ""Melaine... you should be a good girl, and not do anything wrong, you have always had such high morals, don't let them fall, I'm disappointed in you...blah blah blah"" But I don't really care if any of you are disappointed in me, or think less of me, it doesn't matter what you think. I know.... it does matter what God thinks, but I'm still very much a christian, and I always will be, and God is in my heart, and he always will be, I probably should be a better christian, but I'm not, one day I might be, but I'm not now. I'm happy with the way things are, and the way I am, and the way I feel about things. If I really thought I would be ruining my life or something or making a bad decision, I woudln't be making it. I let you all live your life how you want to, and you let me live my life how I want to. Most of you don't really know me, you don't know what I think, or how I feel, so please don't try to talk to me about it unless you agree with me. I used to care what people thought of me, whether or not I met their standards, but I don't care anymore, I want to have fun, I don't want to worry about anything, I want to do things that some of you may not agree with, and I won't regret it, you only live once, so live it to the fullest. You shouldn't be disappointed in me, or think any less of me, but if you do, thats your decision, and just like I made this one, you have the right to make that decision. </FONT></P>

I'm tired, but I can't go to bed yet, I have to keep myself entertained until my sister goes to bed, theres something wrong with her, she makes me stay up until shes asleep, or sleep in her bed, but I don't sleep well in her bed. I hope this stops before I have to go back to school, it just won't work.

I'm going to go play a game or something it occupy my time"

"event","Last night I went to amanda's and andrea's and spent the night. We watched the cat and the hat, thats a good movie, it has a lot of adult humor in it, and go figure, I caught it all lol. Andrea woke me up this morning to go to the beach, and I got back in bed like 4 times, Amanda's bed is sooo comfy, I didn't want to get out of it. So I finally got out of bed, ate a brownie for breakfast went back to bed again lol and then I finally got ready to go to the beach, which only takes like 10 minutes. It was kinda cold at the beach. It was nice, but cold. On the way back we stopped at this place to eat and in the bathroom theres a picture of a naked guy with a leaf over his parts (as Amanda put it) and if you lift up the leaf an alarm goes off at the bar and you get a button pin thingy that says I peeked, it was funny. We then dropped of their aunt and cousin at their aunts house and then we went back to their house. Amanda and Andrea took a little nap, but I didn't feel like sleeping till I got home.Amanda pointed out that I say a lot of things that make sense when I say them in my head, but not when I say them out loud lol. Andrea understood what I meant, I guess I just have my own special language. I had a lot of fun, and I miss them sooo much.

So then I got home, and things kinda went down hill. I walked in the door and my mom followed me in, gave this look and goes you're in trouble and walks to her room to get something. She comes out with my cell phone bill. Ok I was told that I have free roaming, well who ever told me that (which was my MOM) lied to me. In Vermont I used my cell phone, not a lot, and I figured if I did get charged for roaming it would be like 10 cents per minute or something, its more like 2 dollars per minute. So now I owe my mom like 90 dollars of which I don't have so it comes out of my birthday money. I went to go get in the shower and my mom still yelled at me. She yelled at me for like 20 minutes, and I was like ok whatever that isn't my fault. Tomorrow my mom was supposed to be gone working, but nooooo my sisters friend had to go get pregnant and have a baby and now my mom is going to watch it tomorrow so she will be home all day. Grrr I don't want to have to be here with her all day. I hate how things can be so good one minute and then change in like a matter of seconds. But whatever I'm still in a good mood, my mom won't ruin this good mood."

"event","I'm happy, like actually happy. Last night was a good night, I went to dinner with my dad and them, it wasn't that bad, and I hadn't seen my dad in a while so that was good. 

Thank you Anthony!!! Me and him have come a long way, I used to hate him, when really I probably should have been thanking him, but lets not get into that, it doesn't matter anymore. But me and Anthony have become pretty good friends, and then last night he did something for me, which made me happy!!! *big smile* 

Ok I will admit that lately, my morals have gone down. I didn't really try to stop it and I was ok with it, I was having fun and being a teenager and it doesn't really bother me or anything. But wednesday Jason would just say things and it would make me feel bad because he doesn't know somethings. A lot of people my age are having sex, and you know what thats their decision, they can do that if they really feel they are ready for it, but I can almost guarantee that they will regret it. Unless you really and truly love the person, which at this age I don't know if we even know what love is. I think you can love someone a lot, as a really good friend, and maybe even more than that, and if you decide to have sex, then thats your decision I'm not going to think less of anyone for doing it, but it seems like everyone is doing it, like seriously, that makes me not want to do it even more. Its hard to not give into temptations, but I think its better to not give in. You may love someone now, and love is an extremely powerful emotion, its the strongest one out there, but we are just in high school, that means theres still college, and then the real world, there are so many other people you are going to meet, so many things are going to change, and you have to think of those things. If you really and truly love someone and think you are ready, then go for it, but only if you are totally positive you are ready, think of everything, not just whats going at the moment. I'm sorry to say this, but the people that are together now, and having sex, probably won't be together in another year or so. Things happen, things change, and just as fast as you fall in love, you fall out of love. You will never fall out of true love though, and if you are sure you are in true love, and it will never go away, then why not wait, I guess that can go both ways, but what if it turns out you aren't going to be with that person forever. You may always love that person, part of you probably will, and having sex just complicates it. It brings new emotions and feelings, it makes you even closer, it makes the break up even harder, and if someone this age can handle that, then you are an extremely strong person. A couple weeks ago, when my morals were at their lowest, I probably would have done anything, (and I'm really ashamed to say that) but things change, things happen, you realize things and they make you think. Never again will I let my morals slip, it was fun, I admit that, but I wasn't happy, I wanted more, and it made me unhappy. If you wait till you are married and keep your morals up, I think you will be much more happy. I know every one has different opinions about this, and I'm not saying mine is the only right one, but its the one I'm going with. I don't think anything less of anyone that is having sex, or has had sex, I might be a little disappointed, but its your decision, not mine. My decision is to wait, and I think I will be very happy with that decision."

"event","The dream I had last night...wow it wasn't cool. I woke up, and I was crying so much, it was scary. I don't like my dreams, and I definitely did not like that one, it wasn't a dream, it was a nightmare.

I feel bad, I haven't been to my dads in like a month. I was supposed to go today, but I didn't sleep very well last night after I had that dream and he called me at like 6:30 and was like I will be there in a half hour, and I was like there is no way I'm going to be able to get up. I felt really bad, I do that to my dad a lot, it makes me feel bad. Ugh I probably should have went, but he was going to be working on something all anyways, I feel bad. I know my dad wants to see me, I'm lucky that my dad is still in my life, but I don't like going out there when hes busy because then I'm forced to actually talk to my step mom, and I don't like her. And today my step moms son was supposed to be there (I guess he would be my step brother..but I don't consider myself related to any of them in any way) and I really don't like him, theres something about him that I jsut don't like, he reminds me of one of those guys that likes to rape little kids. When me and my sister used to go to my dads every other weekend, sometimes he would be there, and my grandmother would be like make sure when you go to bed you lock the door. My grandmother thinks the best of everyone so for her to say that, she obviously must not like him. Not to mention my dad doesn't like him either. Maybe I will go to my dads tomorrow, or maybe I can go to dinner with him tonight, I feel bad."

"event","I don't like being confused, I talked to some people about it, and they all said I have to figure it out, they can't tell me what to do. But I want them to tell me what to do. I don't know what to think, or how to feel, or what to do, or anything. I'm just confused. I know what I want, but it can never happen, but I still want it to, but it won't, I know it won't, and if it did it probably wouldn't be a smart thing or a good thing, but I still want it, thats how it is for all of it, except I know what I want from each, but it can't happen and I know this has to be confusing you because I'm not even sure if I know what I'm talking about. This would be so much easier if I could like totally explain it, but I can't, not on here, I don't like people knowing things about me. Maybe I should make this friends only...or totally private...or just start writing things on paper, that no one will read...thats an idea"

"event","Ok I went to the mall with Caitlin, Rachel, Stephanie and Lauren. It was fun, I found a lot of things I wanted to buy but I couldn't because my mom gave me money for a bathing suite last night and she said I didn't need anymore more money because I haven't done any chores in like 3 weeks.

I'm kinda confused about some things. Like I dunno, I'm just confused. I want some one to tell me what to do, because I don't know what to do. I used to not be confuse about it, but then I was and then I wasn't and now I am again. I don't know if its confused or like mixed emotions. I think its a little bit of both. I need someone to tell me what to do, because I obviously don't know what to do. Ughhhhhhhhh"

"event","Today was a good day, until like 30 minutes ago, and it wasn't that bad, just makes me really mad. Ok first period in algebra Mr. Johnson wasn't here, at first we had Ms. Faulkenberry, she wasn't that bad all we did was work in groups and play around, then we had some other sub and he didn't really care what we did. Algebra was actually fun today. Second period was chemistry. Ms. Bachteler has been getting on my nerves. First she goes on for like 20 minutes how we are disrespectful and blah blah blah and we aren't allowed to have cell phones, they have to be off and blah blah blah. We then went to the mulitcultural thing, when really there was only one culture.That was ok, much better than being stuck in chemistry. Then I was supposed to go to spanish, but my class was on a field trip so I got a ""note"" that said I needed to go do something for another class and the sub was like ok whats your name so I can take attendance. I went to first lunch and then to the band room, where they played cards the whole time, do they ever get tired of playing them, I guess not. Well they started getting a little, um loud and hyper I guess so I went to like the last 15 minutes of third lunch, which is my real lunch with Sean. And then I went to band, Johnathon and Abner made up a game and they were playing that and I looked at some pictures Chelsie had, there are pictures of me from like 3 years ago, I so don't like those pictures. Then I went and talked to Kelsey and them, lol I wish her luck tonight. Then the bell rang so I went to chemistry so I could get my exam grade and stuff, this is the part that makes me mad. Ok the<STRONG> whole </STRONG>time in chemistry I had an A, never once did I drop&nbsp;below an A. I did most of my work, I did good on all the test, I did good on all the labs, and all the problem sets, I payed attention and I took notes. I got a C on the exam, a C, how did I get a C!!!!!!! That brought my grade down to a B, one freaking thing brought my grade down to a B. I got the same grade as people that did absolutely nothing in that class, and that really makes me mad, I worked for my A, I deserve my A, not a B. Some people that got B's deserve like F's. You are probably thinking oh poor baby you got a B, its not the end of the world most people would love to have a B, but its not just that, I deserve an A, I worked hard for my A, and one freaking thing brought it down to a B. And Ms. Bachteler is like you should have done the exam review and studied, and had an attitude about it.&nbsp;I did do the exam review and I did study. Ughhhh that makes me so mad. Why even try when all that matters is what you make on the exam, I worked hard for my A, and now I don't even get it, that just makes me not want to try, and to just give up. That makes me soo mad. So other than that I'm in a pretty good mood and I'm supposed to be going to the mall tonight with Caitlin and them so that should be fun."

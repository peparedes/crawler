"event","I, uh, forgot about my LJ and recently was like say what? i want my LJ. and it was still here. sweet. things that have changed in like the last 3 years. I graduated college and got a good job that i loved. got laid off from said job, have new job, do not love as much. went on major alcohol induced craziness. used to only have ""sober tuesdays"" in which we could violate if we could find any reason to celebrate (i.e. i saw the cutest puppy today! lets celebrate"")  i am currently living with boyfriend and have for over a year and half. I dont think it will last, we met a strip club. my mom passed away almost a year ago (january 10th 2009). it sucks and blows at the same time. my dad got remarried the beginning of october. He seems to be doing well and new wife seems to really care about him. my boyfriend has 2 daughters that stay with us on the weekends. i love them to death, they both just had birthdays and are 5 and 4. (one year, one month and 1 day apart, they are). they are the cutest little blond haired shits you will ever meet. :)"

"event","so seriously, i can't figure out what is so fucking wrong with me that i can't get a date. I am cute, although not skinny. i am independent, i have an okay job with nice perks (for a college student), i can pay my own bills. i am graduating from college in one semester with my Bachelors. SERIOUSLY? what the fuck is so wrong with me? its not like i even want to get married or something, i just want a date, fuck, people, a date. okay, maybe its my extreme cursing. i do swear a lot. or maybe because i don't really censor who i am and i am kind of loud. but seriously, that can't be so bad that no one wants to date me can it? i would date me, if i was a guy. i am fun, damnit. i have great taste in movies and music. ah! i am going crazy with this. i went on a date a week or so ago, i thought it went okay but apparently ""emily has a great personality and awesome to hang out with, but i don't really see us dating"" awesome, WHY THE FUCK NOT!? thats all i want to know. and seriously, i thought things were kind of clicking with this guy, we made plans for next week and major flirting going on, but, not good enough date. awesome. okay, so mostly i am just really angry. not even about the guy because i could care less about that guy, hes moving in january anyway. its just, what is so wrong with me?"

"event","but i always like to get a head count, so if you want a christmas card from yours truly (me) you have to hit me with your address...i still have tikijams but im not sure if its the current one...and i think thats actually all that i have. i love sending christmas cards so really, its my pleasure...gimmie your address!!! :)

Okay, the movie Happy Endings...GREAT MOVIE. im not kidding. i totally loved it, and who knew Maggie Gyllenhaal could sing like that?!? i mean, she rocks...i am NOT kidding..and not just for an actor. i mean she really sings. i just have one problem, there is a song i like, and i don't know how to get it and its pissing me off. but oh well, if there is nothing you can do about it, then there is nothing you can do about it.

work is going good. i actually won a dvd/vcr combo player the other day from work. which rocked. *Laughs* so i took back the cheapass dvd player i had bought a shopko..i was within 3 days of my 90 day return time frame. *laughs* i knew i kept that box for a reason, it was like, a sign.

i got my directv installed, and i just have to say, TIVO is the greatest invention EVER. i mean, wow. if you dont have it, you should look into it. it truly is the most amazing invention. i have no seen every episode of My So Called Life, WHICH is on at 3am in the morning. i would never get to see it otherwise...YES! and i also tivo southpark...and talk sex with sue but thats just funny! and daria, nip/tuck (though i completely am out of the loop since ive only seen season one and these new episodes i get now *laughs*) and drawn together (hilarious) and okay, i just found out that Beverly Hills 90210 plays on the SoapNet channel...and...i just want to see brenda! but its like the super newer episodes with like hiliary swank on them, WTF. so i will wait til it recycles back to the old episodes. i used to tivo MTV after hours with the music videos, but even after a like 5 hour block, there is only one video i actually care to watch, so F that. okay, im done with my tivo rant, the only thing is, if i got Fox so i could tivo the O.C. then that would be the best, but i dont get my locals :(

anyone that is interested in buying me a christmas present for some random weird reason, i want the o.c. trivia game, available at www.theocinsidershop.com :) i also wouldn't mind the ""captain oats/bait shop"" notebook set.. god, im such a loser but i love the o.c.

okay, yeah, sleep. i have 12 new emails in my Gmail box and EVERY single one is from my teacher...*laughs*"

GREAT band, i have the entire cd with the Emily song, but its my specially favorite, because, why? you figure it out...

Smiles and her laughter
its the only thing that I've been waiting for a time
regardless of our distance and our hope...grows greater
trapped by pretty eyes and letters for all time
...the only thing that I've been waiting for.

I hope its something worth the waiting
cause its the only thought that I ever feel real
thunder storms could never stop me
cause there's no one in the world like Emily

she's simple yet confusing
her sparkling eyes make me weak at my words, they tremble
days seem like years in this month of December
the winter coldens me for I have yet to sleep
and never will I give up trying cause you're everything to me

I hope its something worth the waiting
its the only thought that I ever feel real
thunder storms could never stop me

So, on the plus side, i won a free iPod Shuffle from Jane Magazine (WOO JANE everyone get a subscription!!) how rocking is that? its not 340 million dollar lottery, but hey, still rocks. FREE STUFF ROCKS! i've wanted an iPod since forever, and although its just a shuffle, its still FREE and better than NOTHING! *jumps* rocks. oh and a 50$ gift card to iTunes. (originally the guy told me 100$ but then he apologized and said he was mistaken, oh well 50 is still better than nothing! woo.)

my job is going well, i am getting my complementary DirecTV installed on thursday. however, i have to pay for my DVR (99$) But then there is a 100$ mail in rebate, so it ends up being free, or they pay me a dollar to have it *Laughs* rocks. and then i get the ""total choice premier"" package free cuz i work there. *woo* that rocks too. 

lets see, school is going great too. i have a paper coming up on abortion for my women's studies class. we watched a short flick about it. the horrible thing was that you could tell some of the chicks in my class are sooo pro-life FOR THE RECORD: i personally would never get an abortion, but you can't take that right away from anyone else. if you are against abortion than DON'T GET ONE, but don't take it away from anyone else. the flick we watched was about women that lived in a time when it was illegal (which is it is idaho *rolls her eyes*) and it was so sad. it was about women that died because they would try to do it themselves with a coat hanger, or pay people that were not doctors to do...it was so sad. *sighs* i also have a test in a class on tuesday but i just remember, so i will try to get some studying in tomorrow *Laughs* im not to worried about it, its my human conciousness class, where we talk about sleep, dream interepratations and psychic stuff. fun? yeah. something i feel like i need to hardcore study for? no.

oh yeah and my friend RB made me carve a pumpkin today (which i did 2 weekends ago as well) it has a spider on it, and then its suppose to say ""wicked"" but i rearranged the letters so it says ""dick"" i took a picture, when i find my connector cable i will post a picture. its funny.

lets see, as always, boy problems. *sighs* i dont really feel like getting into it though. i went and saw goonies the other night and got this HUGE bruise on my leg, like HUGE...its like 4 inches across and 1 inch wide. UGH. and then the next day i cut my leg and it has a huge bruise around the cut. (i slammed it on my car license plate) anyways, my leg F'ing hurts. its the same leg too, the cut/bruise is like 1 inch away from the real bruise. *sighs*

my bronco II's clutch stopped working, so my dad loaned me his regular bronco, it is great except it wouldn't start the other day (and its like 90 bucks to fill the tank). i assumed the battery must be dead, so i got a jump but it still wouldn't start. i told my dad so today he came down and cleaned the battery cables, *shrugs* it started so i guess that was the problem. while he was doing that, my mom did my dishes *woo!!!* i was beyond excited *laughs* 

*yawns and sighs* i love fall out boy...this is a really long post because i haven't posted in a long time. im sorry people. *sighs* i think thats about everything..."

"event","so i decided to get my hair professionally straightened. i have done it once before and it didn't work but that was ages ago...so i figured times had changed and they had nicer methods. and i was right. my hair is STICK STRAIGHT. i am so totally stoked. its awesome. totally worth what i paid for it. the only thing i can't do anything (ie wash, put it up in a pony tail) for 2 days. i can't put it into a pony tail or i will have a permant pony tail kink in my hair...so i get to work today and my boss is all ""oh you straighted your hair again"" (she really hates it, she LOVES my curls) and i was like, no, its permant, its never gonna be curly again! *laughs* i mean for a year. and she wigged out saying that i have to have it pulled out of my face and everything, when its exactly! the same as it was before, just not curly. like WHAT THE FUCK. its a little longer in the back but definetly not in the front, it can't be pulled back. AND second, i can't pull it back for 2 days anyway! i am not wasting the money i spent on this by having a permant kink in my hair. why does my boss have to be a bitch. shes a fucking snag...like does she want me to quit today or what? im fucking pissed. i know she's mad at me for quitting in like 3 weeks, but she needs to stop being a fucking bitch. AHHHHHHHH. and seriously, its not right for her to say ANYTHING about ""health code"" violations because there are a few girls that work there that dont pull their hair back AND like i said, my hair is the same as it was before as far as style and length, its just straight and i NEVER had to pull it back before. FUCK FUCK. what a biatch. i am SOO happy i am quitting. *jumps for joy* anyways, that sorta put a damper on my exciting sexy sleek hair, but other then that, i love it."

"event","My boss wants to be nice to me as i am her friend, but she is very angry about me leaving. she keeps bringing up all the people she knows that works there and how much they hate it and all other kinds of shit...when really i need her support...*sighs* oh well, i have to do whats best for me. and i feel like it would be leaving my current job and going to a different....

I have been hanging out with Ace a lot. last night we slept out of her trampoline. now, shes nice, dont get me wrong, and she's my friend but she has some racist issues. everytime she says something like that i get after her, but she still has issues. we are going fishing with my parents tomorrow on their boat. im way excited. i haven't been fishing yet this year, so im totally stoked actually. we slept out on Ace's trampoline last night, which was fun...it didn't rain or anything. it was even warm enough. fun time fun times.

Its J's week to work so i havne't seen much of her since she got back from her wedding. i helped her paint her house and it looks really good....

i can't wait for my trip...its in 16 days and i can't wait! i can't wait! i can't wait! i can't wait! *jumps around* i can't wait!!!!! i am so excited....i can't wait!!! i can't wait!!!!"

"event","I think its better if i keep myself off the market...i mean maybe nothing will happen with this guy but i want to wait just in case. i mean, im not ""waiting"" for the guy..its just...i dont want to try to date, i dont want other guys to like me...i just want this guy and i dont want to mess up anything that may happen...and if nothing does, i wont feel bad because we have a great friendship and i MOST definetly dont want to fuck that up. its very important to me...

i dont like it when the dynamics of relationships change. i informed my boss that after i get back from my vacation i will be quitting. the way the training schedule is, i would still be able to open on sundays, which i will during training. but after that, im not sure what will happen, most likely i will quit. *sighs* so now my boss is pissy/bitchy/angry with me and i really REALLY dont like her attitude about it. i am giving her MORE then a month to find someone new to take my position. and what if i dont get hired on at that place? then what...i have to stay at my lame ass job. LAME ASS JOB. but most likely i will get hired, since i know people have had jobs there, and i am SO much better then them. 

Also the dynamics of Jessie's and I's relationship..she's getting married. and whenever my friends get married, i lose them....it sucks...it makes me sad...jessie is pretty cool....and it sucks..

oh, speaking of jessie, we were coming back from lunch today and we turned the corner and this guy waiting at the light was so HOT. he looked like johnny depp but like, younger...mmmm he was soooo soo delicious looking. i was like....wow.....yummy."

"event","i think i have been sort of ""taking myself off the market"" so to speak.not only have i not been looking for someone to date or anything, but ive sort of been blocking it when the oppurtunity presents itself (ie. a guy is interested in me) i sorta, cock block him myself. i figured out yesterday why i was doing this and im going to try to stop doing it. im waiting for someone that isn't ever going to ask me to be more then a friend. i need to learn to accept that and move on with my life. *sighs* its so hard. *sighs again* im not sure if i can do it...we will see how it goes.

As always, the guys i want seem to be taken. i finally asked out video store hottie and well lets just say 'i felt like an ass' as he's engaged to be married and living with his fiancee. UGH my life sucks. HONESTLY it does. the only person that wants to get with me is this chick thats obviously a vagitarian...and i am not swinging that way. :) *not that there's anything wrong with that*

Sway by the Perishers

i talk to you as to a friend
i hope thats what you've
come to be
It feels as though we've
made amends
Like we found a way 
eventually

It was you picked
the pieces up
When i was a broken soul
And then glued me
back together
Returned to me what
others stole

I don't wanna hurt you
I don't wanna make you sway
Like I know I've done before
I will not do it anymore
I've always been a dreamer
I've had my head among
the clouds
Now that I'm coming down
Won't you be my solid ground?

I look at you and see a friend
I hope that's what you want to be
Are we back now where
it all began?
Have you finally forgiven me?

You gathered my dreams in
When they all blew away
And then tricked them
back into me
You saved me I was
almost dead"

"event","...""This is my tribute to the nice girls. To the nice girls who are overlooked, who become friends and nothing more, who spend hours fixating upon their looks and their personalities and their actions because it must be they that are doing something wrong. This is for the girls who don't give it up on the first date, who don't want to play mind games, who provide a comforting hug and a supportive audience for a story they've heard a thousand times. This is for the girls who understand that they aren't perfect and that the guys they're interested in aren't either, for the girls who flirt and laugh and worry and obsess over the slightest glance, whisper, touch, because somehow they are able to keep alive that hope that maybe... maybe this time he'll have understood. This is an homage to the girls who laugh loud and often, who are comfortable in skirts and sweats and combat boots, who care more than they should for guys who don't deserve their attention. This is for those girls who have been in the trenches, who have watched other girls time and time again fake up and make up and @..%$ up the guys in their lives without saying a word. This is for the girls who have been there from the beginning and have heard the trite words of advice, from ""there are plenty of fish in the sea,"" to ""time heals all wounds."" This is to honor those girls who know that guys are just as scared as they are, who know that they deserve better, who are seeking to find it. 

This is for the girls who have never been in love, but know that it's an experience that they don't want to miss out on. For the girls who have sought a night with friends and been greeted by a night of catcalling, rude comments and explicit invitations that they'd rather not have experienced. This is for the girls who have spent their weekends sitting on the sidelines of a beer pong tournament or a case race, or playing Florence Nightingale for a vomiting guy friend or a comatose crush, who have received a drunk phone call just before dawn from someone who doesn't care enough to invite them over but is still willing to pass out in their bed. This is for the girls who have left sad song lyrics in their away messages, who have tried to make someone understand through a subliminally appealing profile, who have time and time again dropped their male friend hint after hint after hint only to watch him chase after the first blonde girl in a skirt. This is for the girls who have been told that they're too good or too smart or too pretty, who have been given compliments as a way of breaking off a relationship, who have ever been told they are only wanted as a friend. 

This one's for the girls who you can take home to mom, but won't because it's easier to sleep with a @..%$ than foster a relationship; this is for the girls who have been led on by words and kisses and touches, all of which were either only true for the moment, or never real to begin with. This is for the girls who have allowed a guy into their head and heart and bed, only to discover that he's just not ready, he's just not over her, he's just not looking to be tied down; this is for the girls who believe the excuses because it's easier to believe that it's not that they don't want you, it's that they don't want anyone. This is for the girls who have had their hearts broken and their hopes dashed by someone too cavalier to have cared in the first place; this is for the nights spent dissecting every word and syllable and inflection in his speech, for the nights when you've returned home alone, for the nights when you've seen from across the room him leaning a little too close, or standing a little too near, or talking a little too softly for the girl he's with to be a random hookup. This is for the girls who have endured party after party in his presence, finally having realized that it wasn't that he didn't want a relationship: it was that he didn't want you. I honor you for the night his dog died or his grandmother died or his little brother crashed his car and you held him, thinking that if you only comforted him just right, or said the right words, or rubbed his back in the right way then perhaps he'd realize what it was that he already had. This is for the night you realized that it would never happen, and the sunrise you saw the next morning after failing to sleep. 

This is for the ""I really like you, so let's still be friends"" comment after you read more into a situation than he ever intended; this is for never realizing that when you choose friends, you seldom choose those which make you cry yourself to sleep. This is for the hugs you've received from your female friends, for the nights they've reassured you that you are beautiful and intelligent and amazing and loyal and truly worthy of a great guy; this is for the despair you all felt as you sat in the aftermath of your tears, knowing that that night the only companionship you'd have was with a pillow and your teddy bear. This is for the girls who have been used and abused, who have endured what he was giving because at least he was giving something; this is for the stupidity of the nights we've believed that something was better than nothing, though his something was nothing we'd have ever wanted. This is for the girls who have been satisified with too little and who have learned never to expect anything more: for the girls who don't think that they deserve more, because they've been conditioned for so long to accept the scraps thrown to them by guys. 

This is what I don't understand. Men sit and question and whine that girls are only attracted to the mean guys, the guys who berate them and belittle them and don't appreciate them and don't want them; who use them for sex and think of little else than where their next conquest will be made. Men complain that they never meet nice girls, girls who are genuinely interested and compelling, who are intelligent and sweet and smart and beautiful; men despair that no good women want to share in their lives, that girls play mindgames, that girls love to keep them hanging. Yet, men, I ask you: were you to meet one of these genuinely interested, thrillingly compelling, interesting and intelligent and sweet and beautiful and smart girls, were you to give her your number and wait for her to call... and if you were to receive a call from her the next day and she, in her truthful, loyal, intelligent and straightforward nice girl fashion, were to tell you that she finds you intriguing and attractive and interesting and worth her time and perhaps material from which she could fashion a boyfriend, would you or would you not immediately call your friends to tell them of the ""stalker chick"" you'd met the night prior, who called you and wore her heart on her sleeve and told the truth? And would you, or would you not, refuse to make plans with her, speak with her, see her again, and once again return to the bar or club or party scene and search once more for this ""nice girl"" who you just cannot seem to find? Because therein lies the truth, guys: we nice girls are everywhere. But you're not looking for a nice girl. You're not looking for someone genuinely interested in your intermural basketball game, or your anatomy midterm grade, or that argument you keep having with your father; you're looking for a quick fix, a night when you can pretend to have a connection with another human being which is just as disposable as the condom you were using during it. 

So don't say you're on the lookout for nice girls, guys, when you pass us up on every step you take. Sometimes we go undercover; sometimes we go in disguise: sometimes when that girl in the low cut shirt or the too tight miniskirt won't answer your catcalls, sometimes you're looking at a nice girl in @..%$'s clothing - - we might say we like the attention, we might blush and giggle and turn back to our friends, but we're all thinking the same thing: ""This isn't me. Tomorrow morning, I'll be wearing a teeshirt and flannel shorts, I'll have slept alone and I'll be making my hungover best friend breakfast. See through the disguise. See me."""

so i got woken up today by mark. he called me and told me to drag my ass out of bed because he needs to ""talk"" what-the fuck-ever. so i get out of bed, and throw on some clothes. he brought his dog with him which is SUPER cute so she run around my apartment hysterically. shes way hyper but i love her. so he then proceeds to tell me that someone told my boss how big his dick was and how i need to stop talking about HIS personal life. *rolls her eyes* first of all, i never told my boss how big his dick was. or anything relating to that. i told my so called friend denise that he was ""packing"" and she asked me HOW BIG EXACTLY which i honestly couldn't tell her because i didn't bust out a ruler when we were getting it on. then when denise was quitting she told my boss that i talked about my personal life  WAY too much at work because she even knew how big his dick was *rolls her eyes* when we had that conversation, we were in her car, around midnight on our way to dennys to get some apple crisp. i know all kinds of personal shit about her and her husbands fucking sex life. thas what friends talk about! GOD. to lie to my boss and tell her that i talk about it at work YEAH RIGHT. how unprofessional do you think i am!? also, when she said that shit, it was in front of another employee which i think was HELLA unprofessional.  i really hate it how mark just assumes i talk about shit like that with everyone and yells at me. it happened like a month ago, him yelling at me for something i didn't do....weird...deja vu."

"event","so when i wrote that last post, i didn't realize how drunk i was because i HONESTLY did not think i had that many typos. god. 

i got my bonus check, it was 100 dollars but then they take 40% so i got ripped off *laughs* so i decided to just buy myself some stuff i wanted with it...so i got the 4th season of seinfeld since i already have the first 3. then i got scrubs the first season as well. i LOVE scrubs. zach braff kicks major ass. and i bought Pixie a new runny ball thing since she out grew her other one. 

i went home because my boss ended up giving me sunday off. so i had friday, saturday, sunday, monday and tuesday off. so i got home on thursday night, friday i decided that i needed to go see my cousin darci. she hasn't seen ANYONE in our family for a few weeks, and she LOVES my grandpa so much...so she was like hiding under her blankets, like completely covered...she told me to leave her alone and she wouldn't talk to me...i think she might be pregnant or something...*shrugs* anyways so saturday jessie calls and tells me that she has to CANCEL the vegas/phoenix trip. she can't go anymore. im really upset about it...but what can i do...so my mom feels bad for me...so she springs for plane tickets so i can go still, just alone...but since im flying i get to stay an extra day in vegas now...since there wont be any driving involved.

I LOVE FLYING. except i get really nervous that someone will puke on me. ugh i hate that. SO much!  so i get to fly from SLC to LAS VEGAS, stay there for 3 nights, fly from LAS VEGAS to PHOENIX, stay there for 3 days, then fly from PHOENIX to SLC. thats 3 flights....woo....i love the flying.

i am really excited i still get to go....i haven't seen my sister and her family in a really long time, and i haven't seen NICK! in even longer. wooo im so excited. any been to Las Vegas, what is the like MUST SEE thing i have to do!?! i need ideas because jessie was suppose to plan all that stuff....

So then i felt a little bit better but then i lost my fucking phone. YEAH thats what i said. i love my phone. i went back to every place that we went after i had it last...and yeah, its still lost. i went to the cell phone place but because i opted not to get the insurance (ive had a cell phone for like 6 years, never lost/damaged it EVER) so to get a new phone i would have to pay 160 bucks...instead my dad had a super old dinosaur sized nokia so im using that. it sucks ass...

then tuesday morning i finally came back here and then ive just been workiing my ass off since then. *laughs* luckily i have monday and tuesday...im tired....im going to lay down."

"event","so today mark came into work to tell me to ""leave my personal shit at home and that i shouldn't drag davita into it"" HELLOOOOOOO. i haven't done SHIT about my personal life at work. its all Denise and i'm sorry but it is. so i was just like ""what the fuck ever"" i couldn't do anything because i was at work...but god. so apparently davita talked to him and told him that it was ALL denise that i hadn't done shit. so when he came over to see me tonight, he brought me roses. *sighs* his ""im sorry i was a dick"" roses. which was a really nice gesture. they are beautiful...and then i had to tell tell him that we are just friends from now on. and he was telling me that it was me that said ""we are just fuck friends, no commitment"" and i did say that and i meant it because its all i knew i could get....he wasn't ready to date, so i settled for what i could. OF COURSE, i knew all along it was a LINE (im NOT stupid) but he wasn't dating anyone else so it wasn't a big deal. but now he's dating....and its not me...so we aren't going to fuck anymore. because i still have to associate with him, i was civil and told him that we can be friends...but...i dont see us ever hanging out. so after he left, i went to the video store and rented some sad movies so i could cry. (the notebook, my girl, and sweet november). and i just got done watching sweet november...and now i am going to sleep. as i have to work tomorrow. with mark. *sighs* *Breathes Deeply* the trick is to keep breathing..."

"event","lets see the girl at work i dont like is quitting! wooo!!! *jumps* i mean it sucks that she is quitting because then i have to work more while she is gone, but hell who cares, i hated that girl. 

my birthday is on saturday. i have to work, but i am having a little fiesta over here that night. i am going to dinner with jacob my ex-roommate first, and then cocktails and movies at my house. anyone that wants to come is welcome too although no one i know from here could possibly come. 

after taking the easiest test of my life, my friend jessie had this brilliant idea to go get my birthday present, which she picked out, which was....a hamster! she bought the starter kit cage, the food, the bedding, the lil rolly ball for it (which is loves) and the hamster itself. i named it sofie after the rat that i had in anatomy class that we had to kill after performing surgery on it but she said that name sucks so i picked the name pixie and she said that name was worse then sofie so i told her go to hell its name is PIXIE. so my hamsters name is pixie. she is super cute and TOTALLY is a non-biter which is funny cuz the first one jessie picked up totally bit her *Laughs* shes really cute and she LOVES the little ball that she runs around in. the only this is im technically not allowed to have pets, so i SERIOUSLY hope my landlord doesn't freak out about it. i mean its a freaking hamster. she stays in her cage or the ball, i dont think its a big deal.

jacob redid my tattoos. they look awesome. they are sooo dark which is exactly the way i wanted them. my skin is so light and white but before i got them touched up they just weren't contrasting enough, they were super faded and the one on my lower back was way to splotchy. soo now they are great. SORE! but great. next i am getting two hibiscus flowers on each of my shoulder blades. this was jacobs first ""real"" tattoo job and he did great. so im sure doing an actual tattoo, not just fixing up one thats a year old, he will do great on. he's working up pictures now as we speak. 
*smiles* mmm tattoos. the good pain.

lets see, i think thats it. i was suppose to get a 50 cent raise but it didn't go thru so now my boss has to get the district manager to approve it and even if he does, corporate won't approve it. i am currently making 2 dollars more then i was when i was hired a year ago, which is actually a really good raise. but 50 cents more an hour would be nice too. most likely i will just end up getting a 25 cent raise or maybe a 30 instead. we will see how that works out. 

um...thats it...that is all thats going on. my mom is coming down tomorrow to have a birthday lunch with me. i have to meet with my faculty advisor to official get accepted into my major, but i have enough credits and i have a good enough GPA so it shouldn't be a problem. *wiggles around* thats all folks.

OH and the fact that garbage came out with a new cd today and i have yet to purchase it. im totally broke until the first of next month so, that bites. but it will still be there in a month, so i guess i can wait til then. however, i already downloaded the song that i feel will be my favorite on the cd which is ""its all over but the crying"". we will see in a month when i can get the cd though...

hope life is good with everyone else, i rarely have time to chat anymore *sighs* but if you want my phone number or anything just email me or comment. keep in touch people!"

so the last time my fuck buddy was in town he had a date. *sighs* i wish i didn't care about him. last night after work he called me and asked me if i wanted to go over to his apartment and watch a movie. i had just worked a 13 hour shift so i was pretty fucking tired, but i showered, thru on some sweats and a tank top and went over there. i sat on his chair watching naked gun 2 (i think) for like 10 mins before he was like ""why dont you go lay down in my bed, you are like about to pass out"" so i did...and about 10 mins later, he came and laid down with me. then my ""friend"" denise called and was like ""what ya doing"" im like ""just laying in bed"" and she's all ""this is kind of weird but i need marks phone number because i want him to meet my cousin"" so im like ""whats your phone number"" and he tells me and she's all ""oh, are you there with him now?"" and im like ""um yah"" and she's all ""okay gotta go bye"" OHMIGOD im sorry but if you are someone's friend, you dont try to fucking set up their FUCK BUDDY that you know they have FEELINGS for with your FUCKING COUSIN! OHMIGOD! i am REALLY REALLY beginning to not like my ""friend"" denise. *rolls her eyes* FUCKITY FUCK FUCK FUCKIN. UGH. so then i ended up NOT fucking my fuck buddy but just sleeping with him. and  in actuallity, it was really nice. i mean, dont get me wrong, i LOVE the sex. but i just, it was better to have him hold me ...he was doing that cute thing where he just, holds me and like, caresses my face and pets my hair, kisses my forehead......
.....ugh! sometimes i really hate my life. thru all of that, all i was thinking was how much i wish i could give up mark and be with nick.. i know he's technically still married, and we had a rough break up but his wife <i>finally</i> filed for divorce (he had to be a resident of nevada before he could, he still has a month left) and since she filed, there shouldn't be any complications. they haven't lived together for like 8 months or more, and since the kid isn't his...........Nick and I  talk EVERY night for hours. and i realized he's the only guy ive ever truly loved. (i know if my sister is reading this, she's gonna be bitching me out)...but nick is my lobster. (Friends reference)...my soulmate...the one i am suppose to be with...im rachel (but not as cute) and he's ross (but black and not a dinosaur bone guy and im the one that hooked up with someone else while we were on a break)...and i know we have a past, but we are both forgive each other and...we are meant to be together..and if for some reason we never do get together, a part of me will always belong to him. and i just wish i could tell him all of this...

i only have one more day of work and then im off for 2 days and then my boss will be back! of course, those 2 days, i have to be on call...but hopefully everything goes so smoothly i dont have to go in...it would be hard anyways because of my hardcore school schedules on mondays but it could work out. *laughs* i hope i get that 50 cent raise my boss put me in for. since its more then a 4% raise, i might not get it. and have to settle for 25 cents. a raise is a raise is a raise....

i can't sleep, what if mark is hooking up with denise's cousin right now.?!?! AH.

i got off work tonight about 5pm...i came home and took a super long bath and talked to nick for about an hour before he had to get ready to go to a bbq. then i fell asleep. the girl at work called around 7:30 to tell me some customer got bitchy and walked out of store (sorry lady!!) and then i fell back asleep and then the girl at work called me back at 10:30 to tell me that her drawer was 14 bucks short...i told her where to find some extra money and if was fine. but then i couldn't sleep anymore...so i got up and decided to post on my LJ....since its been forever and no one knows what im doing anymore...

oh yeah, sorry to all the Catholics that the Pope Died... :( i assume he was a great leader to his people and im sure he will be missed.

im listening to the Yeah Yeah Yeahs but what i really want is my fucking Damien Rice CD but i can't fucking find it. ive had it for Like ever and i can't find it now...ARG. i used to listen to it in ceramics class when throwing pots...my stuff always turned out nicer..probably cuz its all mellow and stuff...i think i will listen to dashboard confessional now instead..

"event","so i rented the movie Closer, which i actually paid to see as i wanted to see it THAT bad. HELLA awesome. i am really starting to like natalie portman. she's a very VERY talented actress and SMOKING hot. there were some really great lines on that movie. mmmmm natalie portman.

so i am work today, until next wednesday i am the manager as my boss is in texas, and quite readily unavailable.  so i am the manager. so today we got our freight shipment. the day girl did not put ONE thing away. I AM not joking. they were not that busy and there were 3 of them on during the day. second i asked her how everything was, she said the soup kettle wasn't working but all that was needed was a breaker flip and that she spilled the mop water all OVER this morning. so later she calls my boss at her daughters house to tell her how the close the night before was HORRIBLE and she told me all about it and i didn't do anything. ARE YOU JOKING ME? she wants my job so bad she can taste it but she's too lazy to get it. ugh. she's always lying to make me look like a fucking idiot and thankfully my boss can see right thru it. she also told my boss she put all the ""refrigerator freight"" away when it hasn't even been touched except these new cakes we got in because she wanted to try one. HONESTLY. luckily she told my boss that she can't handle working 30 hours a week *waaaaaaaahhhh* the girl doesn't do anything else. god honestly. she's married but no kids, no school. so her hours are getting cut back so thats exciting for me. 

so then around 7pm this lady comes and tells that the womans toilet is overflowing. um hell yeah it is...all over the fucking place. all over the bathroom floor, out the door, down the hall UGH. so i take the plunger *gloves on first always gloves* and try to unclog it, there is absolutely NOTHING there, i cant get anything to happen. so luckily i know this plumber guy John, so i call him, he brings his Snake (get your mind out of the gutter) and unclogs it. some stupid moron flushed a sanitary napkin down the toilet. HONESTLY. are people really that stupid? who the fuck does that? do you do it at your home? NO. why would you do that any where else? UGH. so since John's cool and he loves me, the store only had to shell out 25 bucks which i feel was incrediably reasonable. normally just a service call, after hours can range from 50 to 100 bucks so that was awesome. 

i need someone to love me...

A girl asked a guy if he thought she was pretty, he said...no.
She asked him if he would want to be with her forever....and he said no.
She then asked him if she were to leave would he cry, and once again he replied with a no.
She had heard enough. As she walked away, tears streaming down her face, the guy grabbed her arm and said....
You're not pretty, you're beautiful. I dont want to be with you forever. I NEED to be with you forever. And I wouldn't cry if you walked away...I'd die... 

i am SUPER excited for our vegas/phoenix trip occuring this summer. jessie is SUPER exciting too. which keeps us both super excited by feeding of each others super excitedness. god i can't wait til july! ah! it seems so fucking far away...within the next 3 weeks we are booking a suite at the Royal Resort which is barely off the strip (totally walking distance) but hella good priced and looks clean and respectable. and certain people are going to shoot me but i am sorta excited/nervous to be hanging out with nick. *does not say anything else about that*"

"event","wow its been forever since ive updated. i have been mad busy moving. i got an apartment on the 17th and moved my ass out of that other place. so  i was waiting for my phone line to get transfered and now it is so here i am. my apartment is SOO perfect, not to mention i live ALONE! which kicks hardcore ass. its a one bedroom (that is huge). the living room is super huge, tons of closet spaces, the bathroom is bigger then my old one and everything in the apartment is new. new paint job, new carpet, new toilet, fridge, stove, wood laminate floor in the kitchen! its so nice. and the tub is huge! like seriously two people could fit in it, and its long. the apartment is in a four plex, but no one lives under my apartment, its used for storage (so its actually a tri-plex) . the apartment on the side of me is currently inhabitated by an older lady that is moving out ASAP because of her failing health, she is gonna go live with daughter. and an older gentlemen lives under her. *jumps* its soo unbelievably quiet and nice! i can sleep! its so nice. i have plenty of room for everything even my storage. its only like 3 blocks from other place so its still close enough to school that i could walk (when it warms up, it snowed on wednesday! and a little bit tonight) OH yeah, i have my own designated parking spot! no fighting with anyone over parking spaces. the rent includes all the utilities and is perfectly in my price range. this is really like the best thing that has happened to me in a REALLY long time. so if anyone needs my new address because my birthday is coming up next month (hint hint!) then just email me or talk to me online and i will let ya know what it is. the only thing that is frustrating me is i paid up my rent until april 1st at the old apartment and i was being super nice and not telling them that i wanted it pro-rated and to give it back right? so the new girl moved in the day i moved out (the 18th) which is also fine, except they wont give me the 150 bucks for my deposit which is pissing me off. neil says he will give it to me on 1st which i think they should give it to me ASAP as i am being super nice about everything else. (plus as i had to pay the pro-rated rate to move in here i am MAD broke for the next 2 weeks). ugh. it sucks fucking  balls. i need that money damnit. all my shit has been moved out since like the 19th, except my gazelle work out machine which is in the basement, which i am picking up tomorrow. ugh. if i dont get that money tonight (which is really looks like i wont) then i'd better fucking get it tomorrow. thats about the only stress i have. well and my boss is going to texas next week so i am in charge. (grimaces) other then that my life couldn't be peachier."

"event","okay, Nie was crying that i hadn't updated in a while so i am. not really much is going on. my good good friend jessie is getting married in june and i can't go because my boss already has plans that weekend (a church convention) im like HELLO! she's like my best friend. fuck. *rolls her eyes* whatever. so that blows. but a month after that, in july i am taking the 13th thru 19th off and going to phoenix to visit my sister (with jessie) and staying a few days in vegas on the way there and the night on the way back. *jumps around* im excited. 

all i do is work and go to school. it sorta sucks. i am looking for a new place to live because i have a HUGE problem with my roommate neil. the other night he had a party and one of his friends stole 20 bucks from my room. NICE yeah? i mean i was planning on moving out before that but honestly. neil went and talked to his friend and his friend has said he will pay me back because it was wrong to take it (he says he returned it that night but it must have been lost in my room) yah right, im cleaning/packing up my room and there is NO money here. god.

i can't wait to get my tax return back. luckily i get it all back woo! thats exciting. im happy. i have to save half of it for my vegas/phoenix trip but still, i have a bit to spend on some new clothes and whatever i want. *jumps* 

um...okay thats it. its short, but seriously, nothing happens to me."

did i mention steph and jacob got back together just after christmas break? (her idea) and then last night she broke up with him AGAIN. what crap. i feel so bad for jacob. he's so cute and nice. and she just keeps fucking him up. AH. poor boy.

jessie my friend came up with this brilliant idea to make out a workout schedule *laughs* so we did. then she signed a paper that says we will work out 5 days a week AND no more drinking soda. the first one to give in owes the other person 100.00 dollars, dinner at the place of their choice, and a movie. *laughs* im super excited, as there is NO way she can go longer then a week without drinking soda. she will totally give in and its fucking awesome. :)  oh yah the bad, because of our schedules the only time we can work out is like 6am. which blows donkey cock.

i was thinking about going to vegas for a week in the summer, but i dont know. i definetly want to go somewhere but i  just dont know. jessie is 21 now, so maybe she will want to go with me sometime in the summer...to somewhere. i may have to change my ""tentative time off"" schedule with my boss though. hopefully she doesn't get all fucking bitchy about it. im so sick of my job. i've almost been working there a year. a year in march actually. ugh thats for fucking ever. ugh.

anyways i gotta go to sleep as i gotta get up at the buttcrack of dawn for working out."

"event","i hope everyone had a great christmas. mine was fine. i mostly enjoyed having 4 WHOLE DAYS off in a row! *jumps* that was actually the coolest part. which means im not going to have a day off ever again! but thats okay. for christmas i got cash and seinfeld seasons 1 & 2, then with the cash i bought season 3. i got a cookbook from ""santa"" that says ""to emily love mom"" on the inside cover. *laughs* i got some different kinds of lotion in my stocking and a gift certificate or two. i got some much needed new bras although one didn't fit cuz my boobs are so fucking huge so that one had to be sent back. *shrugs* i got one to replace it, it should be here soon. i also used my money and bought a keane cd. and i got trivial suit pop culture edition which is pretty damn fun/easy. 

the day after christmas my cousin darci came over and her and my mom played it. it was fun. we also went and saw Spanglish with adam sandler. it was SUPER good. totally loved it. 

then my mom and went and saw national treasure which was okay. my mom was totally! in love with it, she can stop talking about how great it is *laughs* 

then today i went back to my home from my parents home. i opened the fridge to put some soda away and the fridge light was off. i was like hmm weird, so i thought maybe something had happened, but no...the fridge was still on. so i checked the deep freeze and EVERYTHING is melted, all the meat is like, not rotted, but um its not frozen and there is like a gallon of water/blood in the bottom of the freezer. it was pretty damn sick. not to mention im pretty pissed off that all my food was ruined. *cries* i just went shopping last weekend too. *sighs*

so to make myself feel better i rented the movie Garden State, which i must say is one of the coolest movies ever. totally love it. i gotta go buy it. gotta go buy it. i already have the shins music that on the soundtrack, but i might have to go buy the entire soundtrack anyway. 

and tomorrow i have to work. *pouts* but first i gotta get up early and clean my room. woo clean my room. 

hope every had a great holiday and has a great new years."

Neil works next door at the tattoo parlor as a tattoo apprentince, so thats cool. he seems slightly weird, but nice. he's not moving in til the 15th though, and steph is moving out on the first of december so. 

thanksgiving was pretty good, i drove home wednesday night and then had thanksgiving dinner with my parents. it was really nice not having to go anywhere else. *sighs* really nice. i forgot to bring left overs home though. damn it. (there actually wasn't that many left overs anyway) and then kael came over after, and it was fun to chat with the boy. then that night my mother and i went to see National Treasure and it was sold out, so we went to rent movies and she ended up buying me Mean Girls and The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. (both great! flicks).

OH yeah, before the holiday, on wednesday, the health inspector showed up at my work, and after careful inspection *laughs* the inspector tells us that we had NO VIOLATIONS, we got a perfect score baybe! i was so fucking excited. yes! perfect score.

If anyone really loves me, they can get me the 3rd season of Seinfeld on DVD for christmas. i am pretty sure my mom is getting me 1 & 2. (they come together) or the dvd box set for My So Called Life. i catch the re-runs on THE N, but i hardly am home and they are on at like 3am....i always bid on the MSCL box set on ebay but i always! get outbid, which is sad. actually forget the seinfeld ones, just get me the MSCL one. *laughs* 

lets see, what else what else. it snowed like from 8am to 11pm today. fucking snowed all fucking day, the roads are SHIT, i hate! it. i hate driving in snow,  i have 4 wheel drive and i still hate it. UGH. fricking snow. i was hoping it would be a winter without snow, but no.

k so that picture REALLY Freaks me out, i've never had anything that scary in my nightmares. as far as 97% of my dreams involving sex, id have to go with a little bit less then that, like 96.9% :P.


also i changed my class schedule. i was able to get into intermediate ceramics so i had to drop my applied techniquies class , but thats okay. and i added a MicroEconomics class on Tuesday nights 7-9:45pm because i am pretty sure i am flunking that this semester (i know, i dont need a lecture, i already feel like worlds biggest fucking chump about it alright). my friend Jessie is taking the econ class, so she will make me go, and i will have a study partner so i think it will work out really well. *smiles* i am taking 18 credits next semester, and working 30 hours, i am not doing ANYTHING ever. if i thought this time was bad, i can't wait til next semester. oh well, its so worth it though, i need to graduate in 2 years."

To Hell with him. I just hope things with Blake go well. He found out that Waggie is leaving for California. I have my plans. I really do. There will be retribution.

I learned something else tonight about one of my crushes. He may not be straight. So let's hear it for that. 

This is my life. So Fuck you! And as always you can take it or leave it. But still...FUCK YOU!"

"event","It is nice return to LiveJournal. It just feels right. I have been talking to Alex, and I have been thinking. 

How can I have known him for such a short time and still feel closer to him than I ever was to Josh? We are not together, yet we cannot stand to be apart. I must be careful with how I precede.

Blake's mother's surgery was yesterday. It went well. I hope for the best, but I have been there. I have seen it way too many times. I cannot watch it again. Hope has always been my greatest friend, or should I say I have always been hope's greatest friend. I have never abandoned it. Clinging to hope is how I survive. 

Blake asked me to deliver a message to Waggie on Saturday. I will in all likelihood do as requested. I just am unsure as to how he will receive it. He ignores Blake and then goes all week without calling him. Blake is a sweet kid that deserves better treatment than that. I understand his fears of being alone, though. I have been there. I shall be as true a friend as possible to him.

On December 2nd, 2003 when Mr. Henley first introduced me to Greg I never would have expected that we would become such good friends. I would like to take this time now to give him a salute. For Greg Wright I would do anything. He is my dearest and most trusted friend. Never before has he let me down. 

Ladies and Gents, (though I am fairly certain no one will read this anytime soon) that is my life. Take it or Leave it.

I have my friends. I have my heart. My fingers dance across my keyboard and with each stroke of the keys, my soul is laid bare for all the world to see. If you see this, let me know. I am happy to share myself with you.

The issues I used to write about in here seem trivial now. I am now out of school and blazing my own path. I still have the same friends to help me along the way and some great new ones.

This Journal knows the old. Time for it to meet the new. Here is what I think of everything.

This world has gone to shit. I used to be the one that thought I could save it. I can't but I can do my damnedest to try. I may not accomplish anything. However, my life will not be in vain if I put eveything I have into being the best person I can. That is all that matters. 

If I have said it once, I have said it a million times.


I'M BACK, BABY!! BIGGER AND BETTER THAN EVER!!!!

It feels good to get a chance to say this again:
That's my life...take it or leave it. I AM ME!!!!!"

"event","Do we know what friendship is?

Friendship is a particular brand of love. Not the love where we have to spend every waking moment thinking about the next moment we spend with the one/ones we love. It is a love where on a subconcious level we know the one we love will return (whether or no they do). True friendship is the kind where even after not seeing your friend for 20,30,or even 70 years, when brought to the same room you both act as if nothing ever changed. You each behave as if it were the day you last saw one another and the rest of your life inbetween was a single instance and you must recount it all to achother so that you can make fun of it the next night as you lay out in your tents and get ready for the first day of school. Friendship is timeless. True love is timeless. Both bonds are highly regarded by myself. This could be because of my somewhat naive nature combined with my status of hopeless romantic. 

Am I naive? Yes. I still believe in the knight in shining armor. I still believe that the good guy is always going to win in the end even if it takes him a while. I still believe there s hope even in the darkest situation. 

Am I stupid? Of course not. I know the way the world works. I also know that the world is always changing and if you put your wrench in the right place you can bring the gears to a grinding halt long enough to implement a minor change.

Am I a hopeless romantic? I think I answered this question when I answered the one about naivety. I have spent countless hours pondering about the beauty of life. Living in a dream world, I have found the poetry of this world. I have spent my time contemplating the ways of love and romance, deciding what is and is not a way of the Lover, practicing these skills, and  finally, refining them. 

This brings me to a new section that explains the skills required of a certain breed of romantic. The Lover.

""What are these skills?"" some might ask.

Well they are the arts of romance. Keep in mind that what is written here is best learned through experience or observation. Primarily experience.

But before we get to the skills I suppose it would be best if I explained the difference between your garden variety romantic and the Lover. The Romantic lives in dreams and finds beauty everywhere. Drifting through their dreams they wish for all to see the beauty they see in the world. They wish to show beauty. The Lover, however, understands beauty and loves beauty in all forms. They wish to for all feel the love everyone should feel atleast once. They wish to teach love. Especially, if they have a lover.

Understanding people. Having the ability to empathize with any given person. To be able to, with a single look mind you, understand the hopes and dreams and fears of a person. Essentially, becoming the one person that anyone particularly lovers and potential lovers can talk to. Best learned through experience or observation.

Understanding the surroundings. To judge what lighting would be of most effect to your cause. Knowing the proper timing. Seeing the potential fun (for this one it helps to be a bit childish.). Essentailly, how to create a certain mood. It is still so much more than that though. It is also how to judge the mood. This is the most difficult to explain. It is best learned through experience or observation.

There are disciplines of touch. Knowing how to control your own body. Knowing how the body works. Knowing how to reduce your lover to goo with but a word (being able to change the pitch of your voice.). Essentially, understanding how to handle the body. Best learned through experience or observation.

Separate but still part of the others, are the less esoteric of the arts of lovers. The ways of love known to the rest of the world. The way of the kiss. The way of the dance (I am not the best dancer in the world but I can hold my own on a dance floor.). Best learned through experience or observation.

There is also knowing how to create excitement. Excitement is a mood. However, creating excitement through the art of teasing is something that is known only to lovers and bitches. Giving just enough to make the mouth water, then backing off. Keep them waiting to make even your worst aspects seem flawless. This is just as hard to explain of Mood. This also must be learned by experience or observation.

This is not meant to give anyone the abilities to become a good lover. It is meant so that the reader may understand the way of the Lover. If someone wishes to know more, I suggest talking to me privately."

"event","Hey guys long time no update. Well, My grandfather passed away Wednesday morning. He raised me up until I got here. He took me to see my first movie, Aladdin. I wasn't very close to him until about 6th grade. I would stay up late due to insomnia and when he got up for work I would cook him breakfast and talk with him. Then I would go to bed for about 2 hours. He adopted me. The funeral is tomorrow and I am not sure if I am going to make it. I have so many shortcomings. Even though I have an understanding of the way people work,I cannot read people the way Greg does. I am not strong like Aurora. I don't have the outlook on life that Amber does. I don't have Poff's sarcasm. All of my friends are so strong. Like the ninth amendment just because there are things not listed doesn't mean that they don't exist. The funeral is tomorrow at 10a.m. Whether or not I'll hold up is up to debate. My grammar sucks today. I don't think I can go the viewing. It is only a family viewing for about 15 minutes that starts in about 5 minutes. I think I am going to go curl up in his bed and pop in Aladdin."

"event","I HATE today!!! I never have liked Valentine's. It just serves to remind me of last year and what I have to look forward to this year in the romance department. 

See, me and this ""holiday"" have a terrible history. Ever since I was little this day has been nothing but trouble. When I was eight I screwed up and my basketball team lost a game that was quite important at the time. At nine this was the day I had to give up martial arts classes and all my other activities because we couldn't afford them anymore. At ten I was betrayed by my bestfriend**. His new friend decided to hold me down by sitting on me while his (the new friend) friend hit me. Now we come to 11, it was this particular year that I started gaining weight...fat kid + chocolate=a hell of a lot of ""funny"" jokes. Ah 12, six grade the year I started to notice I was different. Anyone know what its like to be picked on by sixth graders for being a virgin? Seventh grade was somewhat better. I was still in shock over the fact that I watched hundreds of people die. I went to the school's Valentine's dance. There I was ridculed by the preps for the same reason as last year. Questions were raised when a certain girl, who will remain nameless, touched me and my little friend stayed asleep. Now the year is 2003, I have a girlfriend. There is a problem, this past year all the rumors about me were confirmed. Well, to me atleast. Moving forward yet another year, I have been at A-High for a little while now. I am still secretive about things. Valentine's was in the middle of Winter Break as it is this year also. It was the Saturday following. I decided to go home for the break. While there, I spend the night with my brother* on Friday the 13th. I propose a ""hypothetical"" situation, asking him what he would do if I were gay. I was planning on telling him everything that was going on and start coming out. He replies, ""I would tell you to get out of my house."" This occured after midnight, so it counts as a Valentine's event. Last year I was in Fouke. I get a call from Amber, telling me about everything that had gone down recently. She tells me about how she is going out with Duane. I had apparently ""dropped off the face of the earth."" This reminded me that I would rather be at A-High where I had more friends. 

I can't stand Valentine's. How is it that this ONE day taunts me? It is a mystery. Well I suppose today has been better than the others, but the day isn't over yet.

*not biological brother. bestfriend** for as far back as I can remember

That one song I think it is by 3 Doors Down but it goes ""you love me but you don't know who I am."" How is it that you guys can call me your friend. I am just a total screw up. I mean, do any of you even know anything personal about me? Do I know anything personal about you? Why is it that we say we have a bond of friendship, when you don't know what kind of person I am? Especially since I don't know what kind of person I am. What kind of person am I? Why is it that I had to tell someone I liked them? Am I that stupid to have thought that my saying something could have not blown up in my face, like everything else? I wish I could not be so two-faced. To some of you you see and know only a guy who is energetic and ""way too friggin' happy, all the friggin time"" I don't think any of you see the real me. The exhausted, sick, tired, depressed me. The me that you only see when I think no one is looking. The me that when I am alone just tries to cry as some sort of release. The me that just wants to worry about me. Why is it that I act like others won't let me in, when it is myself who has intimacy issues? Honestly, I don't think I have ever let anyone get close enough to cry in front of them. If I didn't habitually throw on that facade of happy guy, I wouldn't have to worry now. Everytime I am not smiling there has to be something wrong with me. The fact is ladies and gents that whenever I AM smiling is when there is something wrong."

"event","Hey guys I know a couple of us are not doing to good in the romance department. I wrote this because I think it is what some of us are feeling right now. Still we cannot give up. There is someone out there for all of us. Anyways enjoy.
 
 
 
 
  
It is all just a game 
just a little innocent fun 
until somebody winds up
falling in love
 
 
We've all got our fears 
and we dont have a clue
about whats goin on in here
till we all fin'ly lose
 
cuzz somebody fell in love
 
Buddy I don't know 
why you think its so great
All I know 
is that it is the worst of all  fates
 
Nobody cares about whats going on in their lives
their Nasty little hearts are puking up lies
 
It starts out as a simple game
everyone trying to have simple fun
thats before somebody winds up
falling in love
 
They lose sight of their goals
no longer looking for gold
they want to share their souls
and stay together till they are both old
 
Looks like somebody just fell in love
 
They want something more
that this world can provide
They will give all to explore
this new violent tide
 
It all seems Okay 
but I'm still not convinced
No matter what they say
I won't rest 
until I've gotten Cupid lynched
 
It starts out playing the game of life
Everyone trying to have their own fun
until somebody falls in love
Somebody falls in love"

If anyone reads this call me if you know my number and if not Comment me and I'll call you. Umm DO NOT e-mail me and I have no IM for the next couple of weeks. I am gonna try to make it to A-High's HOmecoming I have had someone get me my ticket so if I make it see you there.
I like someone but she likes a guy who can be a complete jerk. I lost my temper and ended up making Sofia mad. Oh yeah apparently I can be an insensitive jerk. That's my life, Take it or Leave it."

Ok Tuesday Mr. Lusk was not at school soo I get out on the field and everyone is whining. Drumline won't strap up all anyone is saying is that it's hot sao me being me I said ""To hell with it. I QUIT"" but I get inside and talk to Ashley and Sofia and end up changing my mind (after school Jessica runs and tells Ms.Tice (finish new song for Duane still haven't sent it to hime). Wednesday, I got to activities and Steven says something like ""atleast Justin didn't walk off cuzz he was hot"" end up wanting to slap Jessica cuzz she says (talking about people walking off the field) ""I don't care they all would pay hell for walking off if I was drum major."" Shayla came back and after band we talk she lifts my shirt and says ""I remember when your stomach hung over your pants"" Wait on my sister's to start their lesson and end up giving Shayla a ride to the elementary before I go home. Thursday nothing eventful (except I accidently woke someone up and I am really sorry about it) . Friday Checked out book on law from the library. Get to 5th period Shayla constantly hitting me with her pen (still don't know why.) 6th period talk to Sofia about a lot of stuff mainly HP theories. 7th we were inside and somebody help the person who stole my music, but other than that I don't really know it's not over yet. That's My Life; Take it or Leave it"

thier enemies will ignite fire in their hearts, bellies, and even their loins with hate and then gain control 
passion is but a fools puppetstring 
whereas apathy can be a double edges sword cutting that puppet string but plunging itself deep within ones heart killing you spiritually and mentally  and manifest itself physically
hence my dillema 
do i continue to feel and let everyone walk over me or close myself off to the world and die inside leaving this shell hollow and void"

"event","Well, it seems that in my absence heated debates have ensued. I have this to say it is a most famous quote. ""If you want to keep your friends NEVER discuss religion."" It looks to me like some of you have decided to go to a point of hurting eachother and I for one am hurt by you doing this. Live and let live, people. It does not matter whether your conservative or liberal, you do not need to attack each other or provoke each other. Some of us have bad living environments and our friendship(s) is/are the closest thing(s) to family we have. Please dear friends, end these feuds before someone ends up hurt for the worst. That's my opinion take it or leave it.

ps.
    In regards to my last entry, I was hurt at the time that yall were all fighting one another that I was going to leave but I have decided that it wouldn't be right to just up and disappear. So I have spoken. I do not want to have to leave

                                                   With all love,

                                                               The JazzMan"

"event","So here is how it is. I have been whined at for like a long time. Went to the Ber/Jess party Friday. Half the guests hated me but I guess I had a good time. Saw JT and could tell something was wrong but she would not respond so I just let it go. and I have done a poll to get it out in the open what ppl think about me. 6 think I am straight 3 think I am gay and 2 think I am bi. Nobody wants to sleep with me however Greg, Kelley, and KT will sleep in the same bed and Amber and Aurora will sleep in the same room. For those of you who do not know my sexual preferences you will just have to find out the ""HARD"" way lol. Please feel free to respond to the poles. Well that's my life. Take it or leave it."

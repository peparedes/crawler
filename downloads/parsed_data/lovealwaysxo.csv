There was alot of like teenagers working there, so i asked how old you had to be to work there and they were like 14, so i wanted to work there but then they told me you had to be 15, so yea..even if i was 15 i wouldnt be able to work because i wont be here for like the WHOLE summer..casue like 2 days after school ends im going to SOUTH AMERICA for a month!(YES!)and after i come back im going to the beach for like a month with hannah's family!(YES!)hopefully i will come back like BLACK!lol! anyways,right now im at hannah's house and im with hannah,rachael,sophia,lainey and scarlet.and we were having fun like a minute ago but were bored now!so yea, i decided to update, but anyways.. i dont know what im doing this weekend,i will mayb go to see children of eden! i cant wait to see it! its gonna be so cool!

We passed upon the stair
We spoke of was and when
Although I wasn't there
He said I was his friend
Which came as a surprise
I spoke into his eyes
I thought you died alone
A long long time ago

Oh no, not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With The Man Who Sold The World

I laughed and shook his hand
And made my way back home
I searched for form and land
For years and years I roamed
I gazed a gazeless stare
At all the millions here
I must have died alone
A long, long time ago

Who knows?
Not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the Man who Sold the World

ORGASMIC."

You are dreamy, peaceful, and young at heart.
Optimistic and caring, you tend to see the best in people.
You tend to be always smiling - and making others smile.

You are shy and intelligent... and a very hard worker.
You're also funny, but many people don't see your funny side.
Your subtle dry humor leaves your close friends in stitches.</font></td></tr></table>

You are elegant, withdrawn, and brilliant.
Your mind is a weapon, able to solve any puzzle.
You are also great at poking holes in arguments and common beliefs.

For you, comfort and calm are very important.
You tend to thrive on your own and shrug off most affection.
You prefer to protect your emotions and stay strong.</font></td></tr></table>

"event","Alright, just getting home from the super fun world of Watertown, I got tons of gorgeous pictures of all of us, I would load them up, but I just hate the whole process of loading pictures onto livejournal, so, pictures are available upon request. Wicked cute.

We lazed around her house for a few hours just listening to music and talking about how close we all used to be, it was actually really nice. For a while, Heather and Deac were really cold towards eachother, but by the end of the night, it was just like old times. Maybe they were afraid of connecting and then losing eachother for the second time? I dunno, I'm no shrink. It was just the first time in a looooooong time all four of us have been in the same room together, and I wasted no time trying to get them to talk and laugh together again.

After all that we went to visit one of Heather's friends, (sp?) Shautandraw (oh god, I'm probably butchering this poor sweet girl's name!) and she basically asked if Deacan and I were together. We were so worried that she was going to be extremely embarrassed if we said no (and she had just started talking too!) that we desided to just pretend to be a couple. It was so hard not to crack up the entire time! We did contain ourselves until we left, however.

When we got back to the house we were all quite dissappointed that we didn't get to see any fireworks, even though its really quite odd to go with Heather. Every time one of the REALLY loud ones goes off she jumps about five feet. Anyways, we were disappointed so we played a nice game of spider solitaire on the computer just for the pretty fireworks at the end for us to oooo and awww about.

Oh, and reaaaaaal funny Ryan...nice, really! You know what I'm talking about!"

Oh...by the way...I'm not mad...at all.

And if you're reading this Mista Bishop...could you not be quite so dramatic in your friends only statement, I don't care if it's friends only and I'm not a ""friend"", but really...I was just being an ass and protecting my friend...I'm sure that you'd do the same if our roles were reversed! This is by no means a personal attack...I just think that by keeping that there when you know that none of the people that commented on that entry think those things about you, you're kind of trying to make Heather feel even more badly about what she said than she already does, and that's not cool.

"event","Alright, I told Heather that I loved her last night and she said...she loves pie. NO lies, I know she just felt that she had to say SOMETHING, because she was uncomfortable, but nothing would have been better than ""I love pie.""

Yeah. By that time I was mighty depressed, so I asked Morgana back out. Yes, you read right, Morgana and I are back together. I know, I know, you all have mixed feelings about her, and some of you *coughcoughHEATHERJESSEMINDILIZAMANDAcoughcough* have made your feelings about her VERY clear, but right now, she and I want to be together, and I think we make a great couple. Plus, who else is gonna take me? Beggars can't be choosers, right?"

"event","I feel nice and geeky now. What with sharing my feelings with people online, some of which I don't know. (Side note: I can be a TOTAL loser at times) Usually I feel this way because I'm in love with my best friend and have been since I met her, although she does not share these emotions. I mean she DOES loves me, but it's completely different from the way that I love her and I loathe that she can't return the feelings. Nope, she loves someone else, a real asshole, and a mutual former friend (and by that I mean that neither of us are really friends with him now.), and she won't admit it if asked, but she does. It makes me horribly depressed to think that she loves someone so awful, and yet still can't love me in that way. 

I would be so good to and for her...but someone is already trying to spoil her in ways she can't imagine. A different someone, a better someone. A Ryan someone...okay that doesn't make sense, but it's true. I dunno, I'm sort of glad it's him... I guess I consider him a friend, even though we've never really met in the traditional sense, and we haven't really talked much lately, what with my being out of state and all, but I think that if they get back together it'd be pretty good for Heather, she's beautiful, intelligent, and funny, but lets face it, she's got some issues to deal with.

I'm extremely possessive when it comes to her, I never thought I'd be that guy...that guy who feels he has to mark his territory. A ""Bobby Beach"". A dog. There have been a couple of guys that shes toyed with the idea of dating between the time she and Ryan broke up and when they started to talk about getting back together, and I swear, when I met them, I almost beat their asses. I also told them that if they ever hurt her I would stab them in the jugular, thankfully I haven't had to live up to my promise...yet. I love her so deeply, and I know that it's that forever kind of love. It's unwavering, but I wish I didn't love her this much, because it makes it hurt SO much more when I get rejected. That's all for now I suppose..."

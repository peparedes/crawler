<b><i>The HRG Trooper</i></b>
My contribution to <i>As You Wish Charity Helmet Project</i>
at <i>Star Wars Celebration VI</i>, Orlando, Florida, August, 2012</p>

<lj-cut text=""Click for full story""> 

Good afternoon,

<i>SW Celebration IV</i> in Los Angeles saw the first SW helmet project in 2007;
<img src=""http://farm1.staticflickr.com/231/511916596_487b7b89d8_z.jpg"">
66 Artists used raw Masterpiece Replica Vader helmets as their canvas to create original interpretations on the theme.


<i>SW Celebration V</i> hosted the TK Project in Orlando, FL;

This tyme around Stormtrooper buckets were re-envisioned with proceeds benefitting the Make-A-Wish foundation.




At <i>Star Wars Celebration VI,</i> Orlando Florida, the project will be returning under the title; <b><i>As You Wish.</i></b>


The <i>As You Wish</i> project will be featuring Clonetrooper helmets donated by eFX.

I am making a helmet for this show. My concept is a recreation of H.R. Giger's Alien, as made from the parts of Star Wars;

I have made a maquette to help visualize the full sized helmet as I work;

The full sized helmet will be large;

"event","<font color=""006699"">Four decades is a long tyme to remain silent. I no longer remember when I first noticed the doorways. They are in all sizes, and they are everywhere. Mostly I learned to ignore them. As I grew older, I saw them for what they really were. I became afraid to go into rooms with other folk where I knew the larger gateways to exist. Everyone else is at home in the knowledge of the alternate identical world--empty of life as it must seem. But what they don't know is that other world was inhabited. And he looks like me. Just like me. He only comes when I am there. Mocking my every move. I won't give him that chance to point me out in front of the others.

<i>Was inhabited.</i>

I heard a crash this morning issuing from the bathroom. The portal there was shattered. Amid the shards began a trail of blood. I followed until I came to the hall gateway. For forty years he mocked my every move. Now he is no longer there. I shudder to think where I am. It is so quiet.</font>

This represents many hours of my costume work.

I am a fan of the Star Wars Expanded Universe. I am also a part of the Star Wars Expanded Universe. I love how that works out.

Photo/costume change marathon; With my friend Nathaniel Fremont behind the lens and four hours of daylight, we shot each these costumes, one after the other, in my backyard, even as the weather turned. (Note the rain drops on some of the suits.)

<font color=""999999"">There's so much more and at the same tyme so much less behind this statement, and the  image it captions. It seems my world has been ending with alarming frequency this year. Only instead of the promise of a new beginning I find myself awaking in the same bed. I feel I am losing aspects of my life in new and inventively cruel ways.

It is a struggle to hold myself together. I do realize I could lose it all. And I am OK with this.

Once, I fought for my life, literally. I took a blow that hurt so much that instantly went from surviving at all costs to just letting go. I came to peace and stopped all resistance. Only when I accepted my demise, death by drowning, was I set free. The whirl pool let go of my limp body and I was pulled from the river. I think I am there again. And I think once again I have to contradict my own survival instincts to live.</font>"

<i>""It's true, I really am interested in you for your brains.</i></p>
<lj-cut text=""Click for more BRAINSSSSSSS"">
One week ago my friend Sarah rung me up and asked me if I would escort her to the <a href=""http://chicagozombie.com/2010/05/zombie-army-productions-presents-zombie-prom-2/""><i>2010 Zombie Prom</i></a> in Chicago. (Sarah works for a Gothic dance club I frequent and we often go out dancing together.)

Blood and gore are not part of my aesthetic. But then I am not in the habit of turning down an invitation to do something new--especially those invitations that challenge my comfort zone. By the close observation of friends in the ""gore"" industry, I have come into a fair understanding of what would be expected at such an event. I found myself intimidated at the prospect. In the the 11th hour, I gathered my resolve. I imagined a refined zombie, one that might carefully swish the brain about in the open skull of the victim and sample the aroma before dining.

Somehow, it all came together. I had a fine tyme painting Sarah and myself. As I painted Sarah, I began to get a sense of what it must be to use the bodies of others as canvas. (I have always held good body painting in high regard.)

To see other couple portaits from the even visit <a href=""http://glitterguts.com/photobooth/zombie-prom""><i>Glitter Guts.</i></a>

The ""Prom"" itself was held at <i>Excalibur</i> in Chicago. It was well attended, and everyone was done up well in their undead finery. They could have easily played appropriate Zombie rock the whole night. Instead, they played the kind of bad music one comes to associate with the awkwardness of prom. It was so bad it was good again;

I often search artist communities for interpretations of characters I am interested in costuming. When I run across an image that appears to draw from elements in my own costumes, I contact the artist to confirm my observation. These three recent works are by <a href=""http://www.tomhodges.com/"">Tom Hodges,</a> <a href=""http://grafunkel.livejournal.com/"">Art Garfunkel,</a> and <a href=""http://www.ragelion.com/"">Jamie Snell</a> respectively.

I am a technical illustrator by trade. Costuming is my true passion, my art. I don't get paid to costume, and I don't make costumes for sale. I do however, feel compensated by the response my work elicits from others. I love, respect, and honour when the work I put in to a suit inspires another artist.

Thanks to Tom and Art (Steven) for sharing their work with me.

Myself as <b><i>Frylock</i></b> from <i>""Aqua Teen Hunger Force.""</i> Quite a fun project for an evening. I think I nearly melted the cashier's brain when I asked for a second empty french fry sleeve when I ordered the fries for this shoot. I painted the clean sleeve, and posed the fries individually.

I shot in a light box with the fries suspended on a mini tripod (which I later edited out.) I put in contacts and painted myself to match the box. I then moved the light box to the edge of the table so that I could get my head inside. That way I could photograph my mug under the same lighting conditions as the fries.

Combining the two photos went by fairly smoothly after that.

I feel like I have been electrocuted by the full force of my own Sith lightning storm, poisoned by a dying colony of Orbalisks, and left for dead. But it was so worth it...
<lj-cut text=""getting here"">
I have been working on this costume for several years now, but not constantly. I have too many other projects going at any one tyme to supply the attention to complete the suit further. My schedule opened up these past few weekends and allowed for a ""growth spurt.""

New since my last update is an <i>Orbalisk</i> encrusted collar and set of bracers, and the second rebato--noticeably absent from my first test fitting. My body aches thinking of the hours required to create these pieces.

After pulling an all-nighter to advance the project, I lugged my gear out to a parking lot and discovered my camera battery was mysteriously losing charge. I only managed 6 images before the camera went to sleep. This image was the first of those.

Evidence of the reverence of the <i>Iron Age Stag Lord</i> has been found as early as 400 BCE. This spirit is associated with fertility and the will of the hunt.

As is their want, invading Christian forces sought to quell ""The Horned One's"" influence by associating this benevolent force of nature with the newly created control mechanism of the devil.

I personally feel man is most noble when he takes responsibility for his own actions. Blaming the misdeeds of others on ""evil"" supernatural forces is a poor excuse for morality.

Since then, it has been all free fall down a vast rabbit hole.

My individual costumes projects now span years. I do this as a hobby, with no real reimbursement other than the learning experience. But the endeavour is not without its perks. And I am thrilled each tyme I learn one of my creations was used as reference by another artist.

I seem to have reached a fair balance between enjoying an event and detailing the experience. While I was unable to attend for any one full day, I did catch a few hours of each. To follow is my coverage of the costumes and personalities of <a href=""http://www.paralada.org/2009/WWCC2009/index.htm""><b><i>2009 Wizard World Chicago Comic Con;</i></b>

Day I</p></a>
A sampling of the <i>Midwest Garrison</i> at the convention. The Star Wars presence on the floor was well represented, and in my mind, well appreciated.

I woke earlier than is holy in order to get into work early, so that I might go home early enough to get my costume, make the half hour drive to the convention centre, and catch the last few hours of opening day. Afterwards I went out with my Garrison to be social at a restaurant. I miss hanging out with my fellows.

<p align=""center""><a href=""http://www.paralada.org/2009/WWCC2009/WWCC0925.htm""><img src=""http://www.paralada.org/2009/WWCC2009/WWCC0925.jpg"">
Day II</p></a>
I had every intent of arriving early, suiting up as the bounty hunter <i>DURGE,</i> and participating in the <i>501st Droid Hunt,</i> which, as it so happens, featured my own art work;
<p align=""center""><a href=""http://www.paralada.org/2009/WWCC2009/WWCC0923.htm""><img src=""http://www.paralada.org/2009/WWCC2009/WWCC0923.jpg""></a></p>
However, it was not to be. After taking my morning shower at home, I was rushing from room to room preparing to leave. My ears still had water in them and I was using a Q-tip to clean them. As I left the bathroom my elbow smacked the door frame, jabbing my hand against the ear I was cleaning. I swore, and pulled the Q-tip out slowly, discovering to my great dismay that it was now bloody.

I went the Emergency room because of my foolishness, and missed the Droid Hunt entirely. The GOOD NEWS is I did no permanent damage. I still went on to catch the last third of the show, suited up in my armour, which was rather well received.

<p align=""center""><a href=""http://www.paralada.org/2009/WWCC2009/WWCC0948.htm""><img src=""http://www.paralada.org/2009/WWCC2009/WWCC0948.jpg"">
Day III</p></a>
Sunday, rode in late with a friend, suited up as <i>The Clone Emperor,</i> struck up some bargains with the vendors, and conversations with friends and other attendees. It was a fine culmination to the event.

Thomas</font>"

<font color=006699><b>C-3PX, IG-88,</b> and <b>HK-47</b> lend new meaning to the <i>501st's Droid Hunt.</i></p>

The Droid Hunt is a convention game invented by the 501st Imperial costuming community. At the start of a convention, attendees are given Droid Hunt badges to wear. Then, costumed members of the 501st go ""hunting."" Upon locating an attendee with a badge, the costumed Imperial speaks the phrase ""How long have you had these droids?"" In exchange for the badge, the attendee is given a raffle ticket. At the end of the convention, raffle ticket holders convene on the 501st fan table to reclaim their badges and vie for a chance to win Star Wars related prizes.

This illustration was conceived as an alternative interpretation of the theme Droid Hunt, (instead of the traditional helpless droids running from Imperials, I have chosen the fiercest droids in the Star Wars Universe. This Droid Hunting party is assembled in homage to <i>Charlie's Angels.</i>) Free hand pencil illustration, scanned and then coloured digitally in Photoshop CS2.

Curious. If my web panel statistics are to be given credence, I have more visitors to this account than external signs would indicate. So be it. I have attended and made galleries for two events in the past months that I would like to share. I found my self spending hours researching and captioning these. I find this after-event research to be invaluable as it affords me a greater appreciation of the effort my fellows have put into their creations while bringing me ever closer to my community.

<b>15--17th of May, 2009;</b>
Freshly returned from the 590 mile round trip weekend in Novi, Michigan for the <a href=""http://www.paralada.org/2009/MCCC2009/index.htm""><b><i>2009 Motor City Comic Con,</i></b></a> and I call it 14 gallons well spent. The event was well attended, but not over attended, making celebrities, artists, and friends equally accessible. The strong presence of my 501st Legion Brothers, made me feel right at home.

<a href=""http://www.paralada.org/2009/CHW2009/index.htm""><b><i>The 24th Annual City of Chicago Hunger Walk</i></b></a> is a family oriented event organized in coordination with the <a href=""http://www.chicagosfoodbank.org/""><b><i>Greater Chicago Food Depository</i></b></a> to combat hunger.

For me, <b><i>2009 Motor City Comic Con,</i></b> began and ended with the presence of my best friend Demon. I am amused by the assumptions folk make about our relationship. We are really just that good of friends. I wish for greater things for those folk who don't understand.

<p align=""center""><a href=""http://www.paralada.org/2009/MCCC2009/index.htm""><img src=""http://www.paralada.org/2009/MCCC2009/MCCC09014.jpg"">

The <i>501st, via the Great Lake Garrison,</i> really took ownership of this convention. And to good effect. I was inspired by the cooperative spirit both between Legionnaires and with convention attendees alike. The Droid Hunt was a huge success. (Which reminds me, I have a badge to illustrate.)

<p align=""center""><a href=""http://www.paralada.org/2009/MCCC2009/index.htm""><img src=""http://www.paralada.org/2009/MCCC2009/MCCC09074.jpg"">

Unlike most other events, the ""celebrities"" and artists on hand at MCCC were easily accessible, both on the convention floor, and at the hotels we shared.

<p align=""center""><a href=""http://www.paralada.org/2009/MCCC2009/index.htm""><img src=""http://www.paralada.org/2009/MCCC2009/MCCC09108.jpg""></p></a>
I look forward to the opportunity to return for next year's event.




<p align=""center""><b><i>Chicago Hunger Walk</i></b>

<a href=""http://www.paralada.org/2009/CHW2009/index.htm""><img src=""http://www.paralada.org/2009/CHW2009/CHW0908.jpg""></p></a>
I always felt the <b><i>Chicago Hunger Walk</i></b> was amoungst the noblest of ""troops"" I have had the honour to participate in. I had been part of the event since 2003. In 2007 I became soured on the affair when a random teenager came up behind me while I was taking a photo of my garrison-mates. The punk took my hand cast guns from my holsters and proceed to whack my armour with them. I turned and closed my hand around his trachea. I really don't play about these things--I treated it as if a man meant to rob me. The instance sickened me. In 2008, either my garrison missed the event--or we were not invited back. If the latter, I felt that my reaction to the rude incident likely contributed to our being excluded.

I was therefore surprised and elated to be invited back for 2009.

While garrison turn-out was small, our presence was big. I made sure that when they began to assemble the walkers that our contingent was before the stage, working with the announcer to whip up excitement.

<p align=""center""><a href=""http://www.paralada.org/2009/CHW2009/index.htm""><img src=""http://www.paralada.org/2009/CHW2009/CHW0909.jpg""></p></a>
Most could not identify our costumes, but many wanted to know who we were. And to my eye, our presence was appreciated in support of this cause.

A very proud, community building moment for us all.

I made these sketches last year as studies for my <i><b>Ultimate Evil</b></i> project. The illustrations above are of the first layer of the character's suit, before the insertion of armour and blades into the his tortured flesh. I intend to own this costume and I will take the large arm tattoo into my own arm.

I will sculpt the exposed endoskeleton and grafted fibre muscles to wear with a medical stocking or as an appliance.

I mean to do this costume proud.

I had a wonderful tyme at <i>Motor City Comic Con 2009</i> this weekend. While it may take me a while to post, I have started work on my convention coverage gallery for the event.

While I worked to revise and maintain all three of the costumes that I brought to the show, the labour on my <i>DURGE</i> suit was the most intensive. I did win their costume contest, but the real pay-off, persay, was the response I received from my fellow Legion members, artists, and general convention attendees.

On the convention floor, Rebel Legion member Alex Ford had set up a nice back drop for costume portraits. Alex then generously burnt CD's for everyone he took photographs of. Thanks Alex.

Be well,

I recently came across footage of a spontaneous interview from <a href=http://www.paralada.org/2009/NYCC2009/index.htm><i><b>New York Comic Con 2009</b></i></a> that I'd care to share;

<p align=center><a href=""http://www.mefeedia.com/entry/imperial-knight-comic-con/16131945""><img src=""http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u319/thecloneemperor/crazyalcayce_interview.png"">
(Click on the video still to view)</a></p>
This is one of the rare instances that I do not cringe at the sound of my own voice.

While I personally feel my suit is presentable, I still require a great deal of work before I would call <i>Version 1</i> complete. I hope to attend to the next upgrade to the suit, custom cast red straps for the underside of the bracers, in tyme for my next convention, <b><i>Motor City Comic Con.</i></b>

"event","<font color=006699>Hello,

Start up issues with my recent return to my post as the <i>501st Legion Membership Officer</i> has taken up all of my free tyme. As such personal projects--completing costumes, artwork, and my own gallery maintenance--has suffered. Now that I am beginning to free up again, I'd like to share some of what I have been up to. These images are from my visit to the <a href=""http://www.paralada.org/2009/NYCC2009/index.htm""><b><i>2009 New York Comic Con;</i></b>
<p align=""center""><img src=""http://www.paralada.org/2009/NYCC2009/NYCC09_banner.jpg"" border=""1"">

<lj-cut text=""Follow this cut for a bit more commentary on the convention."">
<p align=""center""><a href=""http://www.paralada.org/2009/NYCC2009/NYCC09003.htm""><img src=""http://www.paralada.org/2009/NYCC2009/NYCC09003.jpg""></p></a>
Once I arrived in New York, I rendezvoused with my sister in the costuming arts, Mary Alice. Together we traveled to my friend's gallery opening.

<p align=""center""><a href=""http://www.paralada.org/2009/NYCC2009/NYCC09004.htm""><img src=""http://www.paralada.org/2009/NYCC2009/NYCC09004.jpg""></p></a>
I had not seen <a href=""http://www.ekatherinas.com/"">Ekatherina</a> since 2005, at her home in Germany. I considered the chances that she would be in New York having a show on the same weekend that I was there to be astronomical. I don't know how it was possible, but I feel she looks even younger than when we first met in 1995. I find her art to be every bit the reflection of her own beauty.

<p align=""center""><a href=""http://www.paralada.org/Estonia_self/Estonia_htm/SWgeekhtm/IK_Ganner_Krieg/IKGannerKrieg47.htm""><img src=""http://www.paralada.org/Estonia_self/Estonia_htm/SWgeekhtm/IK_Ganner_Krieg/GannerKriegNYCC09KT.jpg""></p></a>
For this event, I upgraded my <a href=""http://www.paralada.org/Estonia_self/Estonia_htm/SWgeekhtm/IK_Ganner_Krieg/index.htm""><i>Imperial Knight armour;</i></a> 1. New cape with twice the fabric for a more dramatic flow. 2. Resewed the undertop to better disperse body heat. 3. Removed magnets on chest armour and replaced with hinge and cotter pin system for more secure closure.

<p align=""center""><a href=""http://www.paralada.org/2009/NYCC2009/NYCC09032.htm""><img src=""http://www.paralada.org/2009/NYCC2009/NYCC09032.jpg""></p></a>
My <i>501st family,</i> starting and ending with Mary Alice, was heartwarmingly cordial with me. It is an amazing thing to travel around the world and be amongst family no matter where you are.

<p align=""center""><a href=""http://www.paralada.org/2009/NYCC2009/NYCC09105.htm""><img src=""http://www.paralada.org/2009/NYCC2009/NYCC09105.jpg""></p></a>
Amongst the familiar faces that I had hoped to encounter was Briana, who appeared positively radiant in her new <i>Loki Goddess</i> costume. Bravo.

<p align=""center""><a href=""http://www.paralada.org/2009/NYCC2009/NYCC09008.htm""><img src=""http://www.paralada.org/2009/NYCC2009/NYCC09008.jpg""></p></a>
Another costume highlight for me was Bill's <i>Rahm Kota.</i> I had seen Bill's work before and I still admire his craftsmanship. A great helping of respect there.

<p align=""center""><a href=""http://www.paralada.org/2009/NYCC2009/NYCC09029.htm""><img src=""http://www.paralada.org/2009/NYCC2009/NYCC09029.jpg""></p></a>
One of the main reasons I go to NYCC is to visit with my friend Jan Duurseama. Jan's entirely family is incredibly kind and inspirational. (In this image, fellow Legionnaire Chip, Artist Jan, and Model Doug.) A big thank you to Jan and her man Tom for allowing me to rest at their table. And for sharing those kettle chips with me when I was low on energy. Never before has a bag of chips been so valuable.

<p align=""center""><a href=""http://www.paralada.org/2009/NYCC2009/NYCC09089.htm""><img src=""http://www.paralada.org/2009/NYCC2009/NYCC09089.jpg""></p></a>
On the last night of the convention I joined with my fellows from both Rebel and 501st Legions for a celebration dinner. All the hard-core, dyed-in-the-wool-Legionnaires stayed behind to sing Karaoke. <i>The Legion has got talent.</i>

<p align=""center""><a href=""http://www.paralada.org/2009/NYCC2009/NYCC09071.htm""><img src=""http://www.paralada.org/2009/NYCC2009/NYCC09071.jpg""></p></a>
Starting with <a href=""http://www.paralada.org/Estonia_self/Estonia_htm/SWgeekhtm/NYComicCon2008/NYCC08115.html""><i>NYCC 2008,</i></a> I like to complete each convention overview with an image of <i>Harley Quin.</i> Monique was only too happy to oblige. Thank you dear.

For completeness sake, I wanted to share these latest <i>Star Wars Galaxy Series 4</i> cards referencing my costumes. To my way of thinking being selected for one card is a great honour. Becoming aware of being featured by several artists is overwhelming to me. I will need tyme to digest this.

Last year (2008) I received two requests for use images of my costumed portrayal of <b><i>The Clone Emperor</i></b> for official reference for the character. This, combined with my remaking/updating of the costume, encouraged me to revisit my sorely out-of-date 2002 gallery.

Over the course of the New Year holiday and the two weekends to follow, I have assembled a new gallery for this project.  In the process I have added new images from forgotten archives with more relevant captions than the gallery's previous incarnation.

I seem to be catching the attention of a number of artists recently. As an illustrator by profession myself, this is not something I take for granted. 

I am honoured to have my work chosen for reference for the character of <b><i>DURGE,</i></b> and especially so by such an adroit artist as Jamie. And a colour card no less. I have now identified nearly a dozen costuming friends appearing in this series, and that is just the beginning. I think it is a beautiful chain of inspiration and brotherhood.

Joe went on to say that I was free to share these images with the costume community. That's actually rare. I have worked with a few LFL artists now and almost always there's a wait period before I can share good news. The waiting can be difficult. Therefore I was doubly excited to be able to share these images at about the same tyme I saw them.

From what I have seen, Joe's contribution will also include illustrations based on other costumers from the Star Wars community. I'll let them to share their joy when they find out.

There is even a possibility that a few other characters that I model might make their way into this set. If this happens, you can bet I'll post an update.

<lj-cut text=""Follow this cut for a bit more commentary on the convention."">
Each convention I attend is preceded by a period of labour and stress as I endeavour to present my own work in the best possible light. I have to learn to pace myself so as to enjoy the tyme spent creating as much as the tyme spent parading.
<p align=""center""><a href=""http://www.paralada.org/Estonia_self/Estonia_htm/SWgeekhtm/Dragoncon22_2008/index.html""><img src=""http://www.paralada.org/Estonia_self/Estonia_htm/SWgeekhtm/Dragoncon22_2008/DC_XXII001.jpg""></p></a>
Together with a fully packed caravan of 5 cars, we made the 11-13 hour trip to Atlanta, Georgia from Chicago, Illinois. It may seem strange not to make use of air travel, but with the number and mass of the costumes I bring, travel by land is the only practical conveyance. I do look forward to the journey, as I enjoy the camaraderie along the way.

Once again I was blessed by the company of dear friends I had not seen in full season.

My roommates Scott and Pamela sported the finest <i>Darth Nihilus and Mara Jade</I> costumes I have ever seen, and that is a statement considering my role as the 501st Legion Membership Officer (2006-2008).
<p align=""center""><a href=""http://www.paralada.org/Estonia_self/Estonia_htm/SWgeekhtm/Dragoncon22_2008/index.html""><img src=""http://www.paralada.org/Estonia_self/Estonia_htm/SWgeekhtm/Dragoncon22_2008/DC_XXII120.jpg""></p></a>
After having been escorted out of the event and into my room by EMT's in 2007 (Heat stroke), I am happy to report that I participated in and completed the 2008 D*C parade without incident.
<p align=""center""><a href=""http://www.paralada.org/Estonia_self/Estonia_htm/SWgeekhtm/Dragoncon22_2008/index.html""><img src=""http://www.paralada.org/Estonia_self/Estonia_htm/SWgeekhtm/Dragoncon22_2008/DC_XXII043.jpg""></p></a>
With fortune smiling upon me, I caught a number of amazing and original costumes with my lens.

However, I was almost ashamed to find that quality of many of my images unworthy of the fantastic creations that I tried to take the portraits of.

This represents a nice circle for me; 
1993 Inspired by Star Wars and the work of Timothy Zahn, Tom Veitch and Cam Kennedy created <i>Dark Empire,</i> one of the first Dark Horse SW: Expanded Universe tales. The Clone Emperor is introduced as the main villain.
1998 Hasbro creates their first Clone Emperor action figure as part of their Expanded Universe line.
<img src=""http://www.paralada.org/Estonia_self/Estonia_images/SWgeek/GenCon02/swinsider65.jpg"">
2002 I learn of the Dark Empire tales after discovering the Hasbro Clone Emperor action figure. I make my Clone Emperor as my very first ""convention costume"" to wear at <i>Star Wars Celebration II.</i>
<img src=""http://www.paralada.org/Estonia_self/Estonia_images/SWgeek/cE_Omar/SWI83_tn.jpg"">
2005 I am surprised to find myself illustrated by Joe Corroney as The Clone Emperor in the Star Wars Insider Issue 83
<img src=""http://www.paralada.org/Estonia_self/Estonia_htm/SWgeekhtm/Eclipse/Clone_EmperorLMOt.jpg"">
2006 Meaning well, my friends send me a forged lettre ""from Hasbro"" saying I had been chosen as the model for the retooling of their Clone Emperor.  It was not meant to be a cruel gesture, but a cute way of introducing a gift they had made together; <i>Darth Elmo.</i>

Back in March  (2008) I was contacted for reference images to be used in an upcoming LFL project. I could not however, confirm the nature of the project until recently. Even then I was asked not share the art work until the product was released. SInce I ran across the little guys at a <i>Toys 'R Us</i> today, I feel it is safe to share this;

Only the art is based on my costume, not the figure. If you look closely at the art for Luke, you may notice that from the waist up, Luke's attire is based on the flip of this image;

"event","<font color=006699>During the months of October and November, I had turned my focus to making a wearable version of my beloved <b><i>Darth Bane.</i></b> With a deadline set by my very favourite yearly online costume contest, I was motivated to new heights. And some lows. (In my industry, I missed out on some events with family and friends. I lost some sleep and even had a nightmare about not finishing on tyme.)
<img src=""http://fc04.deviantart.com/fs35/f/2008/309/4/3/Darth_Bane_test_fitting__2008a_by_TheCloneEmperor.jpg"">
I turned this image in just hours before the deadline. A few days later I was a little disappointed to learn I had not placed. But I realized that is OK. I know the individuals that did place, and the stories that go with their costumes. As fellow costumers and individuals I am happy for them.

There may have been I tyme when this result would have brought me down. But now I laugh lightly at the thought. I know what I made. I made it for me, and I have grown in the effort. This is the point.

I consider the suit as it stands above to be a test fitting. There are several components I wish to add to it, and then optimise the rest for floor wear. I look forward to having something new to bring to the dance.

"event","<font color=006699>Greetings,

I have been keeping this project secret for over four months, with the notion I would not surface until it was complete. Now that <i>The Force Unleashed</i> has been released and this character has been revealed, I feel it might serve better to share my progress. It is actually a release for me just to share this much.

I am proud to say this is <b>NOT PEPAKURA.</b>

Not that there is anything wrong with <i>Pepakura</i>--the software that allows folk to print out the facets of 3-D models for easy assembly--it is just a different animal than sculpting by hand and from scratch.

Last year my companion orchestrated an Air-theme adventure to celebrate my birth day. This year we traveled to Copper Harbor, Michigan, with a reservation to sea-kayak on Lake Superior. On arrival, we discovered that wind conditions on the lake prevented the use of small craft. So our plans transformed into mountain biking. We were able to rent some serious wheels for the occasion. I am not one to be dazzled by price tags, but the two grand a piece retail belies an indication of precision of the equipment.
<p align=""center""><img src=""http://a296.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images01/122/l_ff830fda42a0c574f54817952a1a3f47.jpg""></p>

We traveled up meticulously groomed and technical* paths 550 feet to the local summit before letting gravity take over on the <i>Here We Go</i> trail. *The use of the term ""technical"" is applied to both river courses and bike routes. In context I take it to mean ""challenging terrain"" with plenty of features to keep the enthusiast alert while avoided being brained.
<p align=""center""><img src=""http://a352.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images01/113/l_65b02de7ca8bce95bbd1b3cfc5aa23bf.jpg"">
<img src=""http://a495.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images01/112/l_840c18de037d6f502ffbb76c20ba0aee.jpg""></p>

The descent on the trail was intoxicating. The first few moments of air-tyme I experience gave me pause to reflect the integrity of my body. I became keenly aware that my bones were intact, that my blood resided on the ""in"" side of my skin, and that it would be in my best interest if that arrangement was maintained. I subsequently became more generous in my application of the bike's disc breaking system.

Stretches of the trail were elevated on timber paths. Large caution shields advised of approaching cliff edges, where, at our own election it was decided to walk our bikes. This pair of images is from a more relaxed section of the planked trail;

After a half-day's travel we returned home on the day of my 37th year. When the evening began to blossom, we made the short trip to High Priestess Carol's keep. There we observed <i>Mabon</i> with a brief ceremony.
<p align=""center""><img src=""http://a767.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images01/28/l_1a538cf8c83ce780a001d2e9311829be.jpg""></p>

My good friends crafted a delicious red velvet cake for me, hidden somewhere under an inferno. I was instantly transported back to my post-op lung capacity exercises;

<i>My Friend, he meant a lot to me. 2004</i></p>
<lj-cut text=""some_things_man_is_not_fit_to_cut"">
I stopped mid stride as I realized he was gone. Removed by the village over the the long 4th of July weekend of 2008. I had greeted him every day for the past decade as I made my journey to and from the city. Now he was reduced to a stump and some sawdust.

I stood bewildered. He was in good health, near as I could tell. But such is the the mystery of life itself. One could go mad trying to make sense of death and loss.

He was a handsome tree, I took comfort in his presence. He exuded an air of grace and enchantment. (I swear I could hear chanting as I looked up at him at night.)

As is my way I will not mourn him. We were on good terms and we had no unfinished business. I feel blessed that I should have these images of his corporeal form to remember him by. When I pass my hand over the stump of a <i>Great Tree</i> I can sense the presence. A persistent life force like that does not disappear merely because external forces have wrought ruin upon the body. 

Be well,
Thomas

I think that they did a fine job of editing as I don't cringe so much listening to myself talk.

Oddly enough, just moments ago I completed a phone interview with my colleague Dean for next week's <a href=""http://www.501stlegion.org/podcast/""><i><b>501st pod cast</b></i></a>--episode 20 perhaps? I know that both Melanie and Dutch, and Dean put a whole lot of effort into making these productions sound and appear professional. I am honoured to contribute to their projects.

<b><i>DURGE,</i></a> June 2008</b></p>
My friend Rick took a series of images of me in my DURGE suit at the beginning of June, 2008 for a special project. The following images are culled from that set.

We took 240+ shots in order to glean the one to submit as my contribution to an advertisement in the <i>Star Wars Insider Magazine.</i> The advertisement is being created to promote awareness of <a href=""http://www.thedentedhelmet.com/forums/""><b><i>The Dented Helmet (TDH)</b></i></a> costuming community.

There were slots nine slots for the advertisement, and the steep competition for place was juried by an independent, but knowledgeable set of judges. Since 2003, TDH has been very good to me. Through the TDH I met with other artists and learned the skills and techniques that allowed me to complete not only my DURGE costume, but also provided me with a substantial foundation from which to draw upon in other artistic endeavours. The TDH is a wonderful community distinguished in no small part by a respectful, responsible and dedicated administration that I truly admire.

I am honoured to contribute back to the TDH, with my small part in this upcoming advertisement.

<b><i>Darth Traya from Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</i></b>
(Made in honour of my friend Demon)

<lj-cut text=Making_of_a_Dark_Dashboard_Diva></p>

<i>Darth Traya</i> is the magnificent, malevolent force driving the player's experience in the role playing masterpiece, <i>Star Wars, Knights of the Old Republic II, The Sith Lords.</i>
<p align=""center""><img src=""http://theflagshipeclipse.com/gallery/albums/upload/traya/normal_DarthTrayaFront.jpg"">
<i>Darth Traya</i> character render</p>
I met a wonderful being last year at the <b><i><a href=""http://www.paralada.org/Estonia_self/Estonia_htm/SWgeekhtm/SWCIV_2007/index.html"">Celebration IV convention</a></i></b> who, to my great delight, thoroughly recreated the character.
<p align=""center""><img src=""http://www.paralada.org/Estonia_self/Estonia_htm/SWgeekhtm/SWCIV_2007/SWCIV100.jpg"">
Demon as <i>Darth Traya.</i></p>
Demon has since become a very close friend of mine. And when I speak that Demon is my <u>friend,</u> I use the word in to the fullest sense. One night as we were exchanging beliefs, the idea to modify a Virgin Mary statue to become a miniature <i>Darth Traya</i> struck me. And thus;
<p align=""center""><img src=""http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u319/thecloneemperor/DarthTrayaMini01.jpg?t=1211515190"">
<b><i>Conversion of Mary to Darth Traya</i></b>

<b><i>Darth Traya proof and multiple resin castings</i></b>

<b><i>Darth Traya proof and multiple resin castings</i></b>
</p>
Today, at last, Demon received the package bearing the artist's proof. I am overjoyed that she has it at last and loves the gesture.  (It was a surprise, I have been holding in for too long.)

How I became a real action figure. This is a lot like the story of Pinocchio only in reverse.
<p align=""center""><lj-cut text=Now_I'm_a_real_toy></p>

I had met artist Jan Duursema at <a href=""http://www.paralada.org/Estonia_self/Estonia_htm/SWgeekhtm/2005allspice/WizWorld0504.html""><i>Wizard World Chicago in 2005.</i></a> Her contributions to the art of Star Wars had impressed me a great deal and I was delighted to meet her in person. As we hung out that day, she snapped a portrait image of me saying that she was always on the look out for new faces for use in her art.

It came  as a <i>non sequitur</i> when Jan sent me an e-mail the next year asking if I would model for a  character for a new series she was illustrating for <i>Dark Horse Comics.</i> At the tyme she was sworn to secrecy about the series so even I did not know what was in store. None-the-less I was thrilled and honoured for the consideration.

<i>Imperial Knight Ganner Krieg</i> turned out to be a great character, one that I could feel some sense of pride to represent. As Jan had predicted, I was motivated to place all my other projects on hold while I laboured to recreate ""my"" character's armour.

In 2007 at the 501st Legion Mixer at <i><a href=""http://www.paralada.org/Estonia_self/Estonia_htm/SWgeekhtm/SWCIV_2007/index.html"">Celebration IV,</a></i> Hasbro Marketing Team member Derryl D. DePriest, approached <a href=""http://www.paralada.org/Estonia_self/Estonia_htm/SWgeekhtm/SWCIV_2007/SWCIV119.html"">Doug Wrangler (Jan's model for <i>Quinlan Vos</i> and <em>Imperial Knight Antares Draco</em>) and I.</a> Derryl was excited to let us know that plans to make action figures based on &quot;our&quot; Imperial Knights were underway at Hasbro. It was almost painful to be asked to keep the news secret.

In Feburary of 2008, I received the above product sample image from Derryl. With the public announcement of Hasbro's <i>Imperial Knight Comic Pack</i> action figure set at the 2008 New York Toyfare, I can finally share this news.

While not the final product, I think the Hasbro Team has done a remarkable job.</color>"

<font color=666666>To some the helm looked finished in 2006. But I was not content with the way it fit together. In remedy, I have chosen to first refine the piece, and then extend the challenge by converting it for use in a production mold.

<i>""You have chosen the way of PAIN!,"" says my friend from Isengard.</i>

Despite the apparent set back, I feel secure that this project is moving forward once again.

Be well,

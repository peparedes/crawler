I got in contact with an old friend of mine through the Facebook last week. I haven't talked to him since 3rd grade when we were at SPCS. Its great to make contact with an old friend since I am slowly losing contact with most of my current friends. 

I just got done talking to Murff about my project since I was having trouble with the circulation axis. At some point I might try to load up some pics of my stuff so all of you who aren't architecturally literate can see what i talk about. 

Well thats all for now....lame i know but...oh well"

I had a great christmas with my family. My grandma came over from Florida for the holidays. I got a bike no matter the cost which was awfully nice of my parents. Plus the best part is I now own the 2nd and 3rd movies of the LOTR trilogy  and all 3 are extended versions. I am so happy, now if only Peter Jackson would hurry up and do the Hobbit! In addition tracy (wendy's brother), Diana (tracy's wife), and Paul (diana's son) got a new necklace and a bracelet. the necklace is hemp and cocoa beads and now its on until it breaks. 

Since its that time of year again I have made two new years's resolutions. One is to go to church every sunday and, Two is to exercise and workout on a regular basis. These resolutions are the ones i will keep instead of the usual start and never continue.

For New Year's instaed of going to the Tempe Block Party, I am going up to Strawberry with my friends Stacey and Chris and their group of friends whom i am hanging out with more. 

I hope everyone's New Year's will be as good as mine."

"event","Updating after a long absence. Finally.

Haven't been up to much besides sleeping unfortunately. Somehow my sleeping schedule got messed up so i am awake most of the night and sleep most of the day, which is very annoying. I need to get back on a normal sleeping schedule and actually get things done. I have to pour my pourstone shadow garden memorial and finish designing my cemetary and then do the ink and mylar drawings as well as new models. Plus i have to document all my work. 
Now that i don't have school i been able to catch up on my reading. I read Terry Brooks latest book <em>Tanequil</em> the other day. Got it back to the library within 24 hrs of getting it. Now i have book five of the Wheel of Time series that i have to finish. Though that was on hold as I was reading the Bleach manga. I just finished it about half an hour ago. I think I will start reading the Naruto manga next. Reason being that for some reason my computer is being dumb and won't play the anime collection i have acquired from nathan so its manga only for me until nathan gets back.
Two nights ago was my first Skanksgiving. It was lots of fun also. Stacey got me to join ""TheFacebook"". So i am on it now though i am not sure why. It seems kinda pointless, but oh well at least its free.
Well, thats about it from my end."

"event","Hey Everyone,

Yep! I am finally updating again. I have been working a lot on homework especially in studio. I didn't go out this weekend except to my friend jen's house last night where ben, jen and i watched eddie izzard. I am doing well in studio so far. All my projects turn out well. Chris (not the roommate) and I are working on our bridge for structures right now. Hopefully it will work. 

I know brandi has been yelling at me since I haven't undated in awhile. My mom and grandma survived the two hurricanes unscathed along with all my FL friends. 

(disappeared for a time)

Sorry about disappearing forgot about this entry and got caught up and our bridge project. I just got back from working with chris on the second truss. I will dry over night and be ready tomorrow. We may make third though we aren't sure. 

I haven't been up to much besides school. Not much to say about social life. Met some new people in studio so i hang out with them occasionally. I am meeting more. Its nice to meet new people instead of hanging out with the same people all the time. 

I need to work on my due diligence but instead i am writing this update. got most of my work done though. For my shadow garden i am memorializing the navajo code talkers so if you have any good info please send it to me. 

I have found recently that partying and drinking just don't do it for me anymore and no one seems to want to just have small gatherings of the group us at all so i haven't really seen anyone nor do i think i will see anyone much the rest of the year due to it. I am reverting back to my old self in that respect. Which I actually think is kinda good because i think i will get more work done. I will escape from work occasionally cause you need those breaks. I will do that by talking to nathan or reading or watching anime.

Well i think thats about it. I hope that satisfies you brandi. This is why I don't update that much cause my life is boring and redundant."

I know i haven't updated in awhile but that is because I have been busy. As you all know I am now in Upper Division Architecture. Oh Yeah! I have had two projects due in the past two weeks and another one on wednesday. I am excited cause I definitely saw improvement from the 1st to the 2nd one. My photos were of wood and my idea for the compositions is how time effects the material.

I am excited about the next part which is representing the composition in a 3-d model. Anyway I should get back to my Zoning Ordinances homework so I can maybe watch more Naruto.

<b><u>Want To Know Which Element You Are?</b></u><br><br>You are Spirit!</a><BR><BR>Truly a rare breed, you're calm and thoughtful 
but still know how to live life. Things are taken slowly but your large list of experiences (yours as well 
as others) can help you adapt to new situations with little trouble or people being hurt. Unfortunately,

I sang of leaves, of leaves of gold, and leaves of gold there grew:
Of wind I sang, a wind there came and in the branches blew.
Beyond the Sun, beyond the Moon, the foam was on the Sea,
And by the strands of Ilamrin there grew a golden tree.
Beneath the stars of Ever-eve in Eldamar it shone,
In Eldamar beside the walls of Elven Tirion.
There long the golden leaves have grown upon the branching years,
While here beyond the Sundering Seas now fall the Elven-tears.
O Lorien! The Winter comes, the bare and leafless Day;
The leaves are falling in the stream, the River flows away.
O Lorien! Too long I have dwelt upon this Hither Shore
And in a fading crown have twined the golden elanor.
but if of ships I now sing, what ship would come to me,
What ship would bear me ever back across so wide a Sea?

I will leave, I will leave the woods that bore me;
For our days are ending and our years failing.
I will pass the whide waters lonely sailing.
Long are the waves  on the Last Shore falling,
Sweat are the voices in the Lost Isle calling,
In Eress&#1105;a, in Elvenhome that no man can discover,
Where the leaves fall not: land of my people for ever!

All I have left after this paper is 4 more redone webpages for APH313. Then I have nothing else to do besides study for my INT223 exam next tuesday but I will do that this weekend. Finally I will have not to much to do. I wish I had more time for the webpages cause  I enjoy doing them. Maybe I will work on my new portfolio and add stuff to my website. Sounds good huh.

Oddly enough I have hung out with ben and ryan late into the night twice so far. I don't mind its fun to have other friends besides the athena circle. I just hope they don't mind. I am sure ben doesn't but i am not sure about ryan. he seems to like me well enough.

oh well its back to work on paper. see ya'll

P.S. - yes the music i am listening to is the usual itunes internet radio techno. Though its eurodance instead of vocal trance since vocal trance is not working"

"event","Well its the day after thanksgiving and guess what I am doing? Having fun? Goofing off? Relaxing? NO!!

I am working the front desk at Mac. I am here from 8am, since I took over Heather TM's shift so she could go shopping with her grandma, until 4pm this evening. Thats a long time and no one is here at the dorm so I am not going to have very much human interaction. Though I did talk to a visiting New Zealander, a New Zealander is someone from New Zealand incase you didn't know, for about 10 minutes. It was interesting he said he was pleased that I was social and introverted like most americans he has met. 

One good thing about getting up early to come to work and not having human interaction is that I will mostly likely get most of the book, <I>The Evaluative Image of the City</I>,  that I have to read for PUP 424 done. Then I can start writing the paper for and not be doing it last minute. I told my self if I can get past chapter four by like nine tonight I will allow myself to watch LOTR:FOTR DVD. Maybe some of my friends will join me but probably not so I will be all alone. 

Its been weird being at the condo all alone. Its both a curse and a blessing. Its nice to finally be completely alone for once but I wish I had someone there to hang with for a little bit. Oh well nothing to do about that. I might be going to skanksgiving tomorrow. Not sure if I will attend both sessions or not though. I may just go to the drinking part with emily and try to get thomas to take us and pick us up, hopefully.

I am still waiting for the letter brandi is supposed to send me. Brandi does not like talking either. I try talking to her on aim and she is always very brief. Oh well what can you do. Steph is even worse she is never on line so I never get to talk to her.

Well I am going to get back to reading my book so I can watch FOTR tonight.

Talk to you all later. Bye"

"event","Well, THANKSGIVING has started out shitly. My key ring lost my condo key, so now when I get off working the desk I have to go scour the parking lot for my key. The really sucky thing is that Chris and Nathan are gone so I have no way of getting in unless I find the key. Hopefully God will be with me and allow me to find it.


I took the LOTR personality quiz and my results were as follows:
<I>You are most like Arwen. Calm and reserved, you are not given to sudden outbursts. You conduct yourself dignity...most of the time. The rest of the time you cut loose are are totally cool. You don't really think of yourself as popular, but plenty of people like you. You are not given to needless flirting. The right person will come along some day, and you are content to wait.</I>


Thats about it for now. I am talking to Brandi on AIM and working the MAC front desk though no one is here. Pray for me so that I may find my key. PLEASE!!!

Well Happy Thanksgiving and eat lots of food."

"event","Hey

Well its been a non eventful night for me. I have not gotten any sleep yet except for the 45  minutes when I fell sleep at the dinning room table working. I took over most the shift stacey had to take over since her replacement didn't show up. On the bright side though I got a good portion of my website for myself as well as APH 313 done. Looks reasonably good for a beginner, though not as good as Chris's. Only 20 minutes and I am through and can go to bed for a little bit before I have to go meet my studio group in studio. 

On a random side note the in picture the upper corner of my entry is a stylized not so kiddish more mature picture of <i>Quatre Raberba Winner</i>, who pilots the <i>Sandrock Gundam</i> in <i>Gundam Wing</i> and <i>Gundam Wing Endless Waltz</i>. He is my favorite character from both of them, sorta reminds me of myself, in certain ways.

Well thats my rant for now. I am going to start packing up my compy so I can be ready to go when my replacement gets here. Oh and Brandi you better get the letter and stuff put in the mail box soon. I am itching for something to read besides school related stuff.

Talk to everyone at a later date and HAPPY THANKSGIVING!!!"

"event","I just finished cleaning my area of the room Chris and I share. I got to finally hang some things on the wall. Now it looks occupied. I am now about to eat dinner, wash the dishes, then do some reading. I have to really hit the reading since I will be going to my parents house for Thanksgiving then to Stacey's friends house for Skanksgiving (maybe). 

I got the community center building for my studio project done last night. It looks pretty good. Could be much better but I don't really care at this point. I am already guaranteed an A in the class. I can't wait for Brandi's letter it is apparently in the mail, so I should be getting it soon. Can't wait to see the pictures she made me as well. She is an amazing artist and photographer so they should be excellent. 

I haven't talked to or heard from my friend Steph who lives out here now though. She is the type of person to hunt you down if she wants to talk or hurt you in some way. For me its usually to hurt but thats because I say stupid stuff. You know its true to Steph if your reading this. I hope your doing well here in AZ. 

The semester is almost over. Another year half over. It exactly 63 days until my birthday. Its still hard to believe that I will be in Upper Division Architecture next year. One year behind but what's one year in the compared to the rest of your life. I love to learn anyway. Speaking of which in Bernardi's class this morning, Interior Design Issues and Theories, we had a lecture about the Pompidou, Museu D'Orsay, and the Louvre. The totally awesome thing is that when I was on the Europe trip this summer I went to all three of those museums. That and listening to the interview with I.M. Pei, who did the renovation of the Louvre in the 80's, makes me want to go back to Europe. I would kill to go on the Design and Context Trip again this summer cause it is to Italy and I would get to see work done by the Romans, who I am really interested in, and Carlo Scarpa, an excellent designer.

Oh well, I think I am going to go make dinner now since I am done babbling and Brandi is not responding to my IMs. After dinner its back to the tasks I need to accomplish tonight mainly reading the book titled, ""The Evaluative Image of the City"" for my PUP 424 final paper."

"event","Well I currently sitting here eating dinner and updating this journal. I am about to get ready to head over to studio to work on our site model. My groups project for studio is kick ass. Its sad that urban planning gets all the architecture rejects. They really are rejects because their craft and design sense sucks. 

I can't wait for next year when i am in upper division architecture. I am going to have so much fun since I know a few people who will be with me. It will be so much fun.

Later I am going to go see ELf staring Will Ferrell with Jen, Ben, Erin, Heather, Nathan, and may be Molly and Beth. Though Beth and Molly will probably go to see Gothika.

I am in a great mood tonight for reasons known only to me so thats good. Well better get going.

See ya'll"

Good Lord! I haven't had an entry in my livejournal since last January and its almost a year since then. Well I am a junior in college now. Had an unfortunate incident with my studio last year and got a C in it and turned in a late portfolio but by the grace of god or something like that I will be in upper division architecture next year. <b>WAHOO!!!</b>

I also went to Europe this summer. I went to Barcelona, Spain; Paris and Ronchamp, France; Basel and Zurich, Switzerland; and Wil-am-Rhien, Germany. Had lots of fun with my friends and the new friends I met. I got drunk for my first time and got the most amazing massages from katie, megan, and casey. Thanks ladies.

So far this year has gone ok. I am finally over angela sinclair. For those of you not in the know I had a mad crush on her since last october. 

I now live at Hayden Square Condominiums with my roommates Nathan and Chris. Both of whom I the end of freshman year.

Oh and my sister has now officially moved out here to Tempe, AZ. With that I am off to bed."

My birthday was this past sunday and I had a good one except for all the architecture studio work.

Well, I am off to go read The Silmarilion by J.R.R. Tolkien

"event","I got back from Colorado today. Was there with some friends since monday. I went snowboarding for the first time on wednesday all day and was really sore the next day. Stayed at my friend Rena's grandma's house monday night then at the log house tuesday and wednesday night and at Rena's house last night. The drive was long but it was very scenic. Soem of Rena's friends came over wednesday night and we had a little party. Later Rena, chris and her friends went sledding on powderhorn which is illegal so both heathers adn i stayed behind since we already had run-ins with the law and didn't want it to happen again. When they got back they went to the hot tub and i should gone since chelsea went with them but decided not to for some odd reason. though because i stayed behind for both events i got a quarter of The Mists of Avalon done. 

I am now back at the dorm. Moved most of my stuff in tonight. I visited with the couple of people who were back and I am now about ready to go to bed.  

Thats all that is happening at the moment."

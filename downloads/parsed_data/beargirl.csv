"event","sooo I am pretty sure that someday I am going to make a fabulous stalker...
I honestly say this for no apparent reason, I just feel that I am good at keeping track of some people...and I feel that due to my general nature someday it is going to get obscenely out of hand... maybe I should be like a private detective of something... no that is lame... okay I just felt that yes I am crazy...

people who live in the same town as me should call me, but as none of THOSE people read this livejournal I guess it is pointless to say that...

does anyone remember the cartoon ""Don Coyote""??? I kind of liked that show... Also I kindof vaguely remember ""Fantastic Max"" with the baby with the orange mohawk who explored space...

okay now I am just writing because I feel like I should...that=lame"

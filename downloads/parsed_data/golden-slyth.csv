"event","<p>Grinwald and I are okay, we're friends, I guess. We had a huge fight because he kept talking about me behind my back. I hate people like that. If I have something to say. I'll tell whoever it is to their face, not behind their back. Anyways, he didn't do anything, he just kept going on and on about how he was going to pop me one. He's alot of talk and no action. Just thinking about our fight pisses me off, because McGonagall gave us detentions, and took points away. We didnt even do anything. We just kinda talked about doing something, and she gave us a ddetention and took points away. I would say, we deserved it because of the fight, but we didnt even use magic or anything. <s> She's  such a biased old cow, it makes me want to scream. </s> I'm just in a foul mood because of this whole detentiont thing. We're loosing so many points its killing me. </p>
<p>Anyways, I'm doing great so far in my classes, I've been working on Professor Snapes assignment,I'm working on the pepper-up potion. Its fun, plus when I test it out, I get instanly happy. So far I know that it was manufactured but Gwenda Mafaldic in 16.... something, and it was oringinally used as a general happiness potion (kind of like cheering charms) until 18..uh, something it was accidentally used by a doctor on a patient. I guess the guy picked up the wrong potion or something, but to his surprise, it worked wonders.</p> 
<p>""I think I may even talk to Weasley if he decides to go... He may be a prat sometimes, but we can't have ourselves bickering at every turn... I wonder if he'll talk to me."" Part of me feels like Grinwald is right about this, the whole interhouse unity junk. But the other part of me feels disgusted by even thinking about being nice to Weasley. Since when have I grown a concience? I've been battling with it more and more latley, its driving me nuts. I feel like I have a little angel and a devil on each of my shoulders. Of course the devil is more prominent, but I hear that angel in the back of my mind, quietly convincing me to be nicer. I think I'm going crazy.</p>

<p> I'm looking forward to Hogsmeade. Its jut what I need, to have some time on my own for a while. Plus maybe I'll see the girl I like. I have such a crush on her, its off setting all the other stuff I have to do, because I sit around daydreaming instead of getting some of my work done though. 

Thats enough for today, I'm outta here....</p>"

"event","<P>Blimey, that Grinwald is driving me mad.&nbsp;&nbsp; I should show him what happens to daft, dotty, arrogant little drama queens. &nbsp;Nah, he's not even worth fighting over. He'd prbably run right over to Professor Snape anyway if I did anything. He thinks hes so tough, doesnt he? But dont I think I'm so tough? Wait, what am I doing? I'm questioning myself, I never question myself.&nbsp; Fabulous, that little prat is making me question myself, wich I never do. Oy. Well at least Blaise seems nice. Hopefully I'll have an ally in this since Crabbe and Goyle never seem to be around anymore. </P>
<P>The only thing I'm really worried about is how I actually agree with the <s> Weasel King </s> Weasley. <s> I know its crazy, but maybe I should be a little nicer to those Gryffindors. </s> Wait, wait wait. What the hell am I thinking? Me? nice to Gryffindors? Ha! Yeah right! </P> 

<P> Whats gotten into me latley? </p>

<p> Well I dont have time to find out. I've got a class soon </p>"

"event","For once I'm so glad to be back. The  beggining of this summer was a pain in the arse. Daddy bringing me around to meet his friends, showing me off, telling everyone how I got eleven O.W.L.'s. I know I'm usually willing to show off, but around my parents old friends?  I could think of a million better ways to spend a day than meeting old stuffy women and rich men. I mean, it was great for a while, everyone congratulating me, daddy reminding everyone about things I'd done but after a week of going to peoples houses, and country clubs, it was just so boring. I dont know what he was thinking.

The rest of my summer was pretty good though. I went on holiday to Majorca. I guess it was his way of making things better. I started to get so annoyed with him after a while, and I guess he realized it.  I think dad might have had some business their or something; I could swear he was hiding something. He was gone mostly all the time during the day. I got to go to the beach, though, and I got really tan. I also tried out the muggle sport, surfing. I wasn't to keen at first, but when I saw there were other wizards doing it I decided to give it a go. I did pretty well, and it was actually fun.  We stayed in a really big chateau. I had my own room, and my own servants. It was bloody great.

For once I atually agree with Weasley, but, mark you,it will be the only time. 

Grinwald <b>is</b> an arrogant little berk.

Alright, well I'm off."

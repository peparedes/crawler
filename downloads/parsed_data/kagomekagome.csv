II totally copied off <lj user=""itami_kitsune"">'s style. So sorry ;_;. I did very few icons because I have still to get permission from the owner of the site to use her screencaps. I ought to do that since it's the only site with screencaps available &hearts; OMG, I love this movie to deaaaath! (x-posted in <lj user=""shanhu""> and <lj user=""wandaba"">). Woah, I can really make craptastic icons, huh?

"event","Argh, I'm in my Star Wars fan mode. I never really liked the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd episodes, though. When you talk about Star Wars with me, please leave Anakin out. Augh, he makes me feel all ""aww, poor little silly lovesick chum"". Darth Vader is cooler. Bt even Han Solo is even better &hearts;. Most of it comes from Harrison Ford being the actor, but he is really all cool and bad-ass and cool. 

Influenced by <lj user=""girls_are_weird""> I will watch some Indiana Jones at night :D. My favourite is The Temple of Doom, but my favourite scene is in Raiders of the Lost Ark when there's his guy doing things with his sword and Indy, instead of doing his lasso thing, just pulls a revolver and shoots him down. 

What's the point on having the three Indiana Jones movies and the three final episodes of Star Wars if your computer will not read them because they're region 4? How can I make graphics? *whimper*

Haha, so handsome... Yes, I had nothing better to do than write this stupid entry."

I'm putting this because I will not be here to remind you every single day. I will be away from Monday to Saturday, which is good because there will be no way I can sulk about not going over and watch it. But you must tell me what ti's all about people! Just be sure not to pay too much attention to the English dialogues. They are evil and will guide you into the path of excessive freedom in the translation of dialogues and dubbing. If you can, go and watch it subtitled. If it is not available, ask someone who watched it subtitled. If you don't know anyone, wait for the DVD to come out and watch it with subtitles, but be sure not to use those ""For the hearing-impaired"" because you will see that the dialogues that appear in there do no match with what the cahracters are saying."

I spent a good time of the afternoon downloading Koi Suru 1/4. It turns out to be really good, but disturbingly similar to Parfait Tic. Miake and Fuuko both like to have different (and exotic) hairstyles, are usually torn apart between two guys that break her feelings constantly, one of them is all serious and has a broken heart out of loving an older woman and the other is very cheerful but doesn't share her feelings back, her best girlfriend is extremely popular, but at first hated her.... the list can go on and on.

How long has it been since I last cared about Inuyasha? September? It must be. That's when I read Howl's Moving Castle. Really, how can one be so obsessed with a book? I mean, you already read the ending! It's not as if you were trying to figure out who's gonna end with who, or what's gonna happen. Well, it doesn't happen to me that way because I usually read the books in one sitting. Hate to leave them for later. 

I finally learned to post the correct subjects in my journals. <lj user=""shanhu""> is for general stuff and <lj user=""kagomekagome""> is for fandom rantage. So if you had always wondered why I talked so little about myself, here's the answer :D. 

SO HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT! I'M GONNA DIE OUT OF SWEATING SO MUCH ;^;"

"event","Ah, the weather is so hot...!

I was visiting http://possible-soup.net (Impossibility is normal. Beautiful Soup is yaoi) and ended up downloading a lot of manga, haha. Because for some reason I can't download the Bleach manga ;^;sniff.
<b>Hitsuji no Namida</b> is so cute >D. Wahahaha. And funny. A girl named Kei wants to go into a boy's apartment... but she doesn't have a crush on him. What is the purpose of trying to get into his flowery house? Shoujo-ish and pretty.
<b>Koi Suru 1/4</b> I'm not sure I understand it... And the artwork is somewhat messy. I must keep reading it. Shoujo.
<b>Mahou no te ni Notte</b> Is very basic. Satsuki wants to become a great hairstylist by working with her idol/crush Ryuichi Hayama. He's very stubborn and a skirt-chaser, but deep inside he has a sweet personality. Very typical shoujo.
<b>Seishunchuu!</b> I think this one was my favourite. Kiriko is a high-school girl that lives shadowed by her ""perfect"" older sister Eiko. She wants to be just like her until Eiko turns to be her teacher that everyone loves! What's good out of always being ""the teacher's sister""? And the only person that seems to like her is a sex maniac virgin guy. Kiriko decides to change forever. Shoujo.
<b>Shisha no Gakuensai.</b> Machiko changes school when she witnessed her friend suicide, but three of her classmates are murdered too. She decides to play detective. It develops too quickly, and Machiko doesn't seem affected by the death of so many girls. But it's passable. Shoujo (?)

I have decided I will keep downloading manga from this group. I like their releases."

"event","I had already watched Howl's Moving Castle trailer, but didn't like it. And today, as I was looking for the Kung Fu Hustle trailer, I saw it again. <i>Let's watch it again</i>, I thought. And I still dislike it very much. 
First of all, what's with scary-ass narrator/voice? Really, I detest it. It frikkin' scares the hell outta me. What's the point of having the happy Jinsei no Merry-Go-Round music and then a scary dude proclaiming ""From master film-maker Hayawo Meeiazakee..."". I think I've heard ""An enchanting/epic [fairy]tale of a young woman/girl"" more times than I've watched Spirited Away (which is a big number). Then , Christian Bale's voice! It seems like he had just been hit in the stomach. It's all raspy and deep and argh! Just when I was getting comfortable with Takuya Kimura's voice... I just hope that Howl's voice is not like that all through the movie. Hated Sophie's voice too. She screams like a dog. Really, I can't tell you how much I detest American dubs. I'm really sorry, but I can't help it.
Second thing that I hated was that they practically gave off the whole movie. No, really. Why in the world would they show Bird-Howl? And Sophie kissing Bird-Howl! And that ""Find me in the future!"" out-of-the-blue scream. And white-haired young Sophie! Ha! There's no way one could tell that in the end she returns to her normal age and ends up with Howl, huh? < /sarcasm> 

What's wrong with keeping the Japanese trailers? They kept me in suspense so much time and making out what would really happen. And they they practically took some scissors, clickety-snapped bits of the film despite how spoilerful they might be, and put them together and pretended that was cool. Then they tried to make Jinsei no Merry-Go-Round to fit, but since it didn't they decide to cut it too. 

Or maybe I'm just being a bitch because I already know what's gonna happen. Yes, that's probably it. Because I actually screamed in indignation when Howl told Sophie to ""keep this charm"". Charm, my butt! Thet's a festering RING and you can't change that, Disney Dub! 

I even liked The DaVinci Code trailer better, and I'm not that big of a fan of that book. Angels and Demons is my favourite from Dan Brown. The music is like inspired by the X-Files or something, lol.

The trailer that I really love is Narnia. I think the actors are pretty good-looking. But I always pictured Lucy with pigtails. And Edmund kinda looks like a wimp. But Peter is so handsome! And Susan... well, she is pretty. I really liked her until I read ""The Last Battle"". I felt so betrayed. But I shall pretend I still like her. I'm making my little sister read the books. God, I'm such a bully. But Aslan definitely is cool. And Mr. Tumnus looks cute (from behind, anyway). And yeah...

"event","I reread <u>Castle in the Air</u> for hidden purposes. I used to hate Abdullah. Now I hate Abdullah AND Sophie. I can't believe I hadn't realized how annoying she was. 
I really loved Sophie because I felt so identified with her. Sure, she was strong-headed when she was an old lady, but it was funny. I just loved to picture old Sophie with her walking stick trying to beat the King of Ingary. But Sophie2 (let's call <u>Castle in the Air</u> Sophie like that) gives a feeling of being always angry and getting what she wants. I really admired Sophie because she was to meek and shy, and suddenly being at odds made her realize that if she didn't do things by herself no one would. It's the sort of story that gives us shy people hope! But everything came down when she turned out to become an extremely bossy and loud witch (she is a witch). Maybe it's because of Howl. Living with someone like him can really make you loose your temper. But I think it was Sophie who changed Howl. And the fact that he has his heart back could prove that he's nicer than what he wished he was.

But what the hell? Two weeks without Photoshop and my skills went to... whistle. Meh...

Mys siter wants me to write that she's very shocked from Floricienta's ending. How is it possible that Federico Fritsgummything could be dead, repented his sins, and went to heaven (which is a golf course, by the way)? She's very upset by this. And she think that the County sucks. Because Flor and the County fall in love. Flor betrays her one and only true love Don Fritsengummything. How distressing. She says she's going to sue the company that films that soap opera.

Ishida x Orihime is love <3. And Kabu x Sophie! Because Kabu is so... what was the word again? Curses, I had the perfect adjective but it slipped my mind. Well, you know he is that. You know you secretly have a crush on him. You know you fancy his turnip head."

Have you watched the Harry Potter IV teaser? Have you? Have you? It's half great and half OMG-it's-so-lame. It's a teaser, what's to be expected? I don't know... I hoped some R/Hr action like on the HPIII trailer (hand-holding, hugging or something). And Hermione's dress is pink! And the dragon was sooooooo cool! Love it. And Fleur's not as pretty as I thought. But Cho! Now I LOVE Cho because I hate Harry and anyone who makes Harry upset it my best friend. Ron's so cute! But why is he the third? He should be second! Well, three's my favourite number so it's not that bad... But anyway! Why is Hermione suddenly Harry's BF4E? Huh? HUH? She's not ALWAYS right, you know? Why is she suddenly the brain of the team? A team needs Ron's spirit, for crying out loud! Oh, and Cedric is so handsome, but he's gonna die so boo. I totally forgot he was dead and I got all awww, poor Cho. 

And Disney Channel (Latin America) is so mean! They said they would show the Narnia special Sunday at 7:00PM MEXICO, but two seconds later they show an add saying that The Lion King II was going to show at 7:00PM MEXICO. They did the same thing all afternoon and of course The Lion King II was what they transmited. Boo. I want Narnia! I'm reading the books yet again but I don't have time because I have important exams, so there. 

When I'm living in the States I shall go and watch every single damn cool movie! And when I graduate I shall go study college to the University of Cardiff. They have Graphic Design! And when I live there, I shall marry and have 7 kids and grow old and love my husband to death! And I shall work as a librarian and read books to the children!

Stupid computer! I can't watch HMC because stupid computer man erased the codec and I can't find it. Hate hate hate hate hate. Still no Photoshop."

"event","Stupid Disney Channel (Latin America)! They announced that a special behind-the-scenes in Narnia was taking place today at 7PM, but instead they played 102 Dalmatians. It's a good movie, but I aws really hoping for Narnia goodness. I even set my alarm clock and stopped <i>studying</i> for Math for watching it. Oh, well...

The computer guy unnecesarily erased half of my files. And her erased those that are most important, like my websites and drawings and mangas and PHOTOSHOP! Hatehimhatehimhatehim *chomps his head off*. Well, apart from that everything's okay. I'm downloading Photoshop and PSP already.

Also my Howl fic was erased, but that's okay. I'm writing a new one :D. I just have 2 pages *cough*loser*cough* but I'm proud of them. They're PG, also! No more PG-13! And as always, they're bits of the story here and there; I never ever have an order while writing. Bad Ginny! Bad Ginny!

Before my computer went bad, I did a <b>Neko no Ongaeshi</b> colourbar. <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/wandaba/993.html"">Go and look</a>.

Oh, and doing stuff when I have my Math final on Monday is not good either. Bad Ginny! Bad Ginny!"

The Daily Yomiuri reports that, unlike Miyazaki's Spirited Away, which was initially given a limited theatrical release to 26 theaters, Howl's Moving Castle will be released in 700 to 800 theaters. Spirited Away was expanded to 150 theaters in its initial, limited release and 700+ theaters after it won the Oscar for Best Animated Theatrical Feature. It went on to earn $10 million at the domestic box office.

The Howl's Moving Castle will feature the voices of Christian Bale (31) as Howl, Jean Simmons (76) as Sophie Hatter (old), Lauren Bacall (80) as the Witch of the Waste, Billy Crystal (58) as Calcifer and Blythe Danner (62) as Madam Salliman. The voice actress for the young version of Sophie has yet to be announced. In the Japanese dub Chieko Baisho voiced both the young and old versions of Sophie. Pete Docter will direct.</i>

<b>How long did it take to read?</b> One week. 
<b>Describe the book in three words or less:</b> Carnivorous sheep rule. Oh, and Friendly cows too, but they aren't quite as funny as the sheep. 
<b>State your favourite character(s):</b> That is a hard one. I think Reville or Talithan. Or Derk. Or Blade. 
<b>What part made you feel funny inside?</b> ""Oh, Wizard. Is it true that when a wizard kisses you a special kind of magic happens?"" (or something along those lines, I don't have the books with me). 
<b>What was your least favourite part?</b> When Derk was all sulky because he thought Kit was dead. 
<b>Would you recommend this books?</b> Absolutely
<b>Would you read it again?</b> Definitely.
<b>Would you rant about this book?</b> Positive."

I had heard about <b>Naisho</b> but I thought it was another movie. And since it was just released in Japan, very few people actually know about it, let alone anyone who speaks a language I can understand. Aha!

1) <lj user=""okorimakuri""> searched for Hauru doujinshi in http://jpqueen.com so after looking at some of them I searched for Ron/Hermione doujin godness and my favourites are <a href=""http://jpqueen.com/onlineshop/productinfo.asp?PID=50150"" target=""_blank"">this</a> and <a href=""http://jpqueen.com/onlineshop/productinfo.asp?PID=47714"" target=""_blank"">this</a>.

2) You know the guy who played Laurie in <b>Little Women</b>? Well, he's going to be Howl's voice in the English version. He's handsome, but I can't remember his voice (or his name). 

3) Yesterday I finished reading <u>Angels & Demons</u> by Dan Brown. Excellent book with an unexpected ending, but I didn't like the narration. It was... simple. I don't know, I didn't like his style. What kept me reading were the series of events that developed. He could learn from DWJ (guess who's obsessed). 
Despite the shocking ending, the camerlengo is my very favourite character. In chapter 94 I cried all the way without caring. It was hard between all the tears, but I just loved what the camerlengo said, even when he didn't meant it. Oh, well... I disliked Vittoria. Bleh, she's annoying. 

4) http://eki.to/howl
I love this website since a long time ago, it's a bunch of short doujinshis (all of them howl x sophie except one that is lettie x suliman). lovely, lovely. I used to have a sen to chihiro address to, but they are broken links now >:(

5) I watched <b>Robots</b> on Sunday. I didn't know Aleks Syntek was Rodney's voice. Whatever, it was a GREAT movie! You must go watch it! Definitely! It's extremely funny and the animation is aweeeeeesome. BTW, it you live in Tampico, go watch <b>The Triplets of Belleville</b> (in Cinepolis). I would go watch it but I am going <i>en voyage</i>. Other movie I want to watch are <b>The Corpse Bride</b> (Johnny Depp is loooove), <b>The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe</b>, <b>Rapunzel Unbraided</b>, and the movie Ghibli said was going to appear in 2007/8 (<lj user=""silleress""> is the source of animation knowledge). 

6) <lj user=""wandaba> is my icons/graphics journal. no real layout, but working on it.

7) The other day I was looking for good shows on the TV and in the menu there was <b>A Wrinkle in Time</b>. Oh, I jumped with joy and hope and changed the channels, but we hadn't bought that channel transmision, so I sulked all day long. 

8) Almost done with the Kabu fanlisting. Kabu is love, LOVE I tell you. 

9) Oh, my God! I have enough money for buying a Wacom tablet! I have enough money for buying a Wacom tablet! I would buy it but... I'm going to the States for one year... I'm not going to buy it only to let it sit in the dust. I can wait other 5 months with my crappy cheap-ass mouse. Plus, that means MORE money for buying MORE books. And when I say MORE books, you know I'm referring to either DWJ or Madeleine L'Engle or Cornelia Funke. 

10) Someone joined the fanlisting and put as country <b>spore</b>. Is that Singapore?"

<lj-cut text=""The Poopie List"">
The Poopie List 
The Ghost Poopie 
The kind where you feel poopie come out, see poopie on the toilet paper, but there's no poopie in the bowl. 

The Clean Poopie 
The kind where you feel poopie come out, see poopie in the bowl, but there's no poopie on the toilet paper. 

The Wet Poopie 
You wipe your butt fifty times and it still feels unwiped. So you end up putting toilet paper between your butt and your underwear so you don't ruin them with those dreadful skid marks.

The Second Wave Poopie 
This poopie happens when you've finished, your pants are up to your knees, and you suddenly realize you have to poop some more.

The Brain Hemorrahage Through Your Nose Poopie 
Also known as ""Pop a Vein in Your Forehead Poopie"". You have to strain so much to get it out that you turn purple and practically have a stroke. 

The Corn Poopie 
No explanation necessary. 

The Lincoln Log Poopie 
The kind of poopie that's so enormous you're afraid to flush it down without first breaking it up into little pieces with the toilet brush. 

The Nororius Drinker Poopie 
The kind of poopie you have the morning after a long night of drinking. It's most noticeable trait is the tread mark left on the bottom of the toilet bowl after you flush. 

The ""Gee, I Really Wish I Could Poopie"" Poopie 
The kind where you want to poopie, but even after straining your guts out, all you can do is sit on the toilet, cramped and farting. 

The Wet Cheeks Poopie 
Also known as the ""Power Dump"". That's the kind that comes out of your ass so fast that your butt cheeks get splashed with the toilet water. 

The Liquid Poopie 
That's the kind where yellowish-brown liquid shoots out of your butt, splashes all over the side of the toilet bowl and, at the same time, chronically burns your tender poop-chute. 

The Mexican Food Poopie 
A class all on its own. 

The Crowd Pleaser 
This poopie is so intriguing in size and/or appearance that you have to show it to someone before flushing. 

The Mood Enhancer 
This poopie occurs after a lengthy period of constipation, thereby allowing you to be your old self again. 

The Ritual 
This poopie occurs at the same time each day and is accomplished with the aid of a newspaper. 

The Guinness Book Of Records Poopie 
A poopie so noteworthy it should be recorded for future generations. 

The Aftershock Poopie 
This poopie has an odour so powerful than anyone entering the vicinity within the next seven hours is affected. 

The ""Honeymoon's Over"" Poopie 
This is any Poopie created in the presence of another person. 

The Groaner 
A poopie so huge it cannot exit without vocal assistance. 

The Floater 
Characterized by its floatability, this poopie has been known to resurface after many flushings. 

The Ranger 
A poopie which refuses to let go. It is usually necessary to engage in a rocking or bouncing motion, but quite often the only solution is to push it away with a small piece of toilet paper. 

The Phantom Poopie 
This appears in the toilet mysteriously and no one will admit to putting it there. 

The Peek-A-Boo Poopie 
Now you see it, now you don't. This poopie is playing games with you. Requires patience and muscle control. 

The Bombshell 
A poopie that comes as a complete surprise at a time that is either inappropriate to poopie (i.e. during making out or a root canal) or you are nowhere near pooping facilities. 

The ""I Just Know There's A Turd Still Dangling There"" Poopie 
Where you just sit there patiently and wait for the last cling-on to drop off because if you wipe now, it's going to smear all over the place. 

The Snake Charmer 
A long skinny poopie which has managed to coil itself into a frightening position - usually harmless. 

The Olympic Poopie 
This poopie occurs exactly one hour prior to the start of any competitive event in which you are entered and bears a close resemblance to the Drinker's Poopie. 

The Back-To-Nature Poopie 
This poopie may be of any variety but is always deposited either in the woods or while hiding behind the passenger side of your car. 

The Pebbles-From-Heaven Poopie 
An adorable collection of small turds in a cluster, often a gift from God when you actually can't poopie.

Premeditated Poopie 
Laxative induced. Doesn't count. 

Shitzopherenia 
Fear of Poopies - can be fatal! 

Energizer Vs. Duracell Poopie 
Also known as a ""Still Going"" poopie. 

The Power Dump Poopie 
The kind that comes out so fast, you barely get your pants down when you're done.

The Liquid Plumber Poopie 
This kind of poopie is so big it plugs up the toilet and it overflows all over the floor. (You should have followed the advice from the Lincoln Log Poopie.)

The Spinal Tap Poopie 
The kind of poopie that hurts so much coming out, you'd swear it's got to be coming out sideways. 

The ""I Think I'm Giving Birth Through My Asshole"" Poopie 
Similar to the Lincoln Log and The Spinal Tap Poopies. The shape and size of the turd resembles a tall boy beer can. Vacuous air space remains in the rectum for some time afterwards. 

The Porridge Poopie 
The type that comes out like toothpaste, and just keeps on coming. You have two choices: a) flush and keep going, or b) risk it piling up to your butt while you sit there helpless. 

The ""I'm Going To Chew My Food Better"" Poopie 
When the bag of Doritos you ate last night lacerates the insides of your rectum on the way out in the morning.

The ""I Think I'm Turning Into A Bunny"" Poopie 
When you drop lots of cute, little round ones that look like marbles and make tiny splashing sounds when they hit the water. 

The ""What The Hell Died In Here?"" Poopie 
Also sometimes referred to as ""The Toxic Dump"". Of course you don't warn anyone of the poisonous bathroom odour. Instead, you stand innocently near the door and enjoy the show as they run out gagging and gasping for air.

     Chieko Baisho = LOVE. She did a wonderful job doing young Sophie's voice. I'd never imagine she's a very grown-up woman. Oh, and when Howl grabs her waist and stroll through the Kingsbury skies I just go all ""KAWAII SUGOI KYAAAH!!!!!!!111!12345"" and every other fangirlish exclamations. 

     Once again, I must say I LOVE Howl. I love Howl. Although I am usually very determined about liking better bookish Howl than movie Howl, this time I had to reconsider. I mean, look at his face. He looks so sure, so handsome and kind, ready to save his damsel in distress from the soldier-bad-guys. Perhaps not that unlikely from the book --as that is the kind of stuff someone like Howl would do to impress a lady he wants to fall for him-- but he is like that all the movie (except when his hair goes red, then purple, and then black). I like him that way, but the main point of the story was that Howl did not have a heart, therefore he couldn't care very much for someone, yet he worried a lot for Sophie, and she made him change... ok, she didn't make a big difference if we talk about Howl being a slitherer-outer, vain, and self-centered. But she occcupies a space in Howl's heart. Awww, itsn't that sweet?

     Then there's Sophie. Good, old Sophie (literally, anyway). What I loved about the movie is that she was already fancying Howl since she met him (who whouldn't). Sure, Love-Hate relationships are my favourite, but this was good and hot like hotcakes (I had to say hot... I dunno. Pervert). It was sort of refreshing to have that change, but I would have liked it a big deal better if they weren't so lovey-dovey. Yes, I am cross because of Ouji-sama. I LOVE the Prince!!! He has puffy hair and a chicken-yellow suit, and instead of walking he jumps on a stick. And Sophie refuses him (Well, DUH!). It was stupid of me to think otherwise, but it was so sad. I mean he said, ""I love you"" and she said ""I love Howl"" and he says ""I know you love him so I'll just go Buh-bye"". Awww, come ON, don't tell me it wasn't sad? He should have coupled up with Lettie (Actually, I AM coupling them up, fufufufufu).
Yeah, I would have like it better if there were more conflicts in Howl and Sophie's relationship, but they worked out fine.

     A few thoughts on the looks: Sophie looks very petite. Really. I mean, I never did expect her to be tall or fat, but she looks so... weak. I mean, when DWJ says that Martha was thin, I imediately thought Lettie and Sophie were a little plump (in the normal weight someone might be). Usually when they descirbe someone as healthy, they are like that, so I just thought... Anyway, movie Sophie would look like me if I was thinner. Dark brown hair, somwhat thick eyebrows, calm and quiet... Yeah... Howl is HOT. In the clip I have (and a few others I've seen in French websites) his hair is messy, and that makes him look more manly. Yeah, I remember the first trailer where he looked SO MUCH like a girl. Hehe. Sophie looks more manly than he does, lol. The Witch of the Waste looks ewy. I mean, what's with the giant waves of flesh under her chin? That is gross! Meh, but when Mme. Suliman turns the Witch of the Waste into a giant lump of flesh, strangely I find her cute. Except when she smokes >_<. 

     In conclusion: I NEED TO WATCH THE MOVIE!!! I CAN'T GO ON LIKE THIS!!! I NEED IT!!! Please? You can cut it to small pieces and send it to me in parts, I don't care. I'd love you forever."

"event","Just a quick review on the Howl's Moving Castle OST before I go to celebrate Christmas at my grandma's.

<b>Name:</b> Howl's Moving Castle Original Soundtrack
<b>Composer:</b> Joe Hisaishi
<b>Number of tracks:</b> 26

Oh, the love. Oh, the wonderful notes by Joe Hisaishi. Oh, all the Jinsei no Merry-Go-Roundish songs! I can't believe Joe Hisaishi did that! At least 20 of the tracks have SOME fragment with Jinsei no Merry-Go-Round. I love the song, it's beautiful, but ARGH! It' annoying to hear it again and again. I understand it's the theme song, but he didn't have to abuse. Beside that, I guess it's okay. Nothing awfully outstanding, and a lot of tracks sound similar. But it's funny. How can music be funny? I dunno... It makes me laugh. And cry. And feel ""awwww"".
You should buy it ONLY if you're a big fan of the movie. Or Joe Hisaishi. Or Ghibli. Otherwise, the best choice is the Image Album.
Oh, the Image Album is <b>THE LOVE</b>. The Image Album is beautiful and you enjoy every single track to bits. You must buy it even when you don't know anything about Howl or Ghibli or Joe Hisaishi. MUST BUY! Remember that. MUST BUY! And if you don't want it anymore... would you give it to me? I want it badly."

"event","Yesterday I went to watch ""The Incredibles"". It's an AWESOME movie! I loved every bit of it, and I am very happy about it. I even have a new shipping (Bob x Hellen), and that would be the first married couple I ship.
Marriages are usually not very fun to ship because they are already <i>married</i>, so there's not a lot from where to plot and imagine stuff. But this one was great! I mean, I seriously love Bob Parr. Did you see how many times he kissed his wife? Wow... And Hellen! When she told him that she really loved him, I was about to cry. It was just so sweet and I went all ""Awww, loookit thaaaat!"". I would LOVE to marry someone like Bob. Or Howl. Or Haku. *cough*
There I go again with my fiction crushes. I think that's why I don't have any friends. Maybe the lack of friendliness is making my Christmas bitter this year. At least there's always family, no matter how bitchy they are. They are always there.
But I'm not actually sad or depressed. It's more like I'm disappointed. I really thought I had friends. 
But next year I will be going for good. If God allows it, I will finish High School in Prineville. There I will be able to choose a good American or British college, and then I would never have to come back. Then I would make real friends and I'll be happy. The END.

Oh, don't mind me. I'm just being idiotic as always. Don't feel sorry for me, I'm used to being ignored. Oh, lunch time!"

So, I remembered I hadn't checked the <a hreF=""http://www.inuyasha-movie.com"" target=""_blank"">Inuyasha Official Guren no Hourajima website</a>. Now I check, I discover a very very cool trailer!

<font size=""-2""><i>Sophie says: What the Fuck!?</i></font><br>
Ok, you all know I'm a pervert who collects Inuyasha doujinshi (fufufu). But this certainly did make me ashamed by just looking at the TOP picture. You see, yesterday I was browsing around Japanese Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi art sites, like most days. So, I found a site that had this cute CLAMP-ish/Koge Donbo-ish style and I decided to look around. There were two separate galleries, Howl and Sen to Chihiro. I first went to the Howl gallery, since it's my most recent obsession. Plus, there was a warning that no one under 12 could enter the site. I paid no attention, since most Japanese art sites have some nudity or something, nothing out of the ordinary. Yep, a few pervy pictures, fine. Then, I proceeded to the Sen to Chihiro gallery. Same warning. Paid no attention. Oh, my God. What kind of person would... would draw - or even IMAGINE- something like THAT!? Geez, they make Haku look like a first-class hentai addict when he's such an innocent boy/god. Really, double eww tee eff. I mean, Chihiro IS a 10-year old CHILD. Sophie and Howl are adults, and even Inuyasha/Kagome isn't that bad. Or even if they would have drawn them more grown-up. I feel so so so ashamed of having looked in there. 
Yeah..."

Isn't this, like, the cutest thing ever?</center>

I've been browsing through Japanese art sites and I was quite pleased until I found out not every Howl fan support Howl/Sophie. And no, I wouldn't mind if it was Howl/Lettie or something... But NOOOOOO. It has to be Howl/Wizard Suliman. *vomits* Geez, they didn't even consider Howl/Michael, which would have been understandable. I mean, the guys haven't even talked (Percival doesn't count)! Argh. Well, I'm fairly happy with the Haku sprite, so I'll just leave before I make a campaign against Howl/wizard Suliman"

"event","Why, I am extremely worried. I have found someone in IRC that can give me <b>Howl's Moving Castle Image Album</b>, but I have already heard 3 of them. I must say they're lovely, but the one I love the most is that in the extended preview. I fear that one will not come, since that is what happened to the tune in Spirited Away's trailers. It was a beautiful piano melody (reminds me somehow of the music in <b>Beauty and The Beast</b>), but it wasn't included in the OST. I was very mad, as every time I want to hear it I must play the DVD. 
The three I have are: 
01. <b>Mysterious World</b> 5:48 <br>
06. <b>War War War</b> 4:47<br>
10. <b>Cave of Mind</b> 5:48 <br>
I downloaded them from <a href=""www.pathea.com/media/music/ghibli/howl/index.shtml"" target=""_blank"">Pathea.com</a>. Another site I found is <a href=""http://www.ed2kmagazine.com/modules.php?name=Forums&file=viewtopic&t=3327"" target=""_blank"">Ed2kmagazine</a>. This one offers the full album in a .rar (a compression file) format. But I can't download it, and I think it's because I don't have a P2P network (I accidentally erased it). So if anyone can download it, I'll love you to death <3.

And anyway, I just found out I'm a stupid arse. I hadn't figured our why the Witch of the Waste had turned Sophie into an old lady, but now I re-read the book for the fourth time, I realized it was because she misinterprets the nature of the relationship between Howl and Sophie (as he had invited her for a drink and had been really nice to her). Man, I sure need to pay more attention to what I read @_@"

I just read the book in the morning and by lunch time I was already fancying DWJ's butt. It's just I love <b>Howl's Moving Castle</b>. I loved it since I saw <b>Spirited Away</b>, because there was a small note on this, and I had already read a review about it. I can't wait for the movie release. I can't wait for the movie release. I can't wait for the movie release. I love ever single word written in it, I love every character to bits (except the Wicked Witch of the Waste). I also like the happy ending style. Why are people against happy endings? I mean, endings that happy aren't real, but for Christ's sake, let me enjoy the moment!!! Arrgh!!!
Right now, I'm downloading the trailer <333. btw, thanks to <lj user=""hi_chan""> for loving me enough to send me the book :D"

"event","I had this weird dream... about kissing a blond guy who spoke Japanese in the States. Could it be a prediction of some sort? Lol, I don't think so.
Anyway, he kissed me and I don't know what, but he said he was sorry because he didn't give me a kiss, but instead just pressed his lips against mine. When I woke up, I began thinking about it. I've always considered a kiss to put your lips against something. But a <i>kiss</i> kiss is when two person't lips meet. But according to my dream, a <i>kiss</i> kiss is when the tongue plays part, or when people move their mouths or something so that they need to take a breath every once in a while. What do you (points to Hika & Cali, for they are the only people who read this) think? I immediately related to my actual favourite ship, InuSan, and was rather pleased with the possibilities *drools*. 
Working on my Haku shrine. Specifically, the seiyuu info. And Tokimeki <3"

"event","I just finished watching <b>Mononoke Hime</b>. The OST was disturbingly similar to <b>Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi</b>'s, but what did you expect? After all, both were composed by Hisaishi Joe <3. I love his music so much. Now more than ever I can't wait for Ghibli's next movie, <b>Howl's Moving Castle</b>.
Anyway, I'm still in the search of a fellow InuSan shipper. There used to be a fanlisting, but there is no longer a link in TFL or google. Boo...
Oh, yeah. Last night I dreamt of the boy I like. It was funny/scary, because he was wearing my grandma's bra after he supposedly killed her. O_o"

"event","Hi everyone *waves*. I love this journal, but recently I've got nothing to tell you. Except that Kouga was finally remembered by Takahashi :p. And I'm happy, cos that means Kohaku is still alive <3. Anyway...
I got the Mononoke-hime movie on VHS, so I need to ask a favour to Hikari. If she would be so kind as to record it :D. Because my VHS is retarded and can't play everything.
And I'll be able to upload the 9.5 MB <i>Brand New World</i> song! How? Well, on http://s7.yousendit.com you can send up to 1 GB to anyone's inbox. Instead of sending it to one person, I can send it to me, copy the link and paste it. It expires in 7 days, though, but that is fine because that is all you need to download it, ne?
And I just got 2 <b>G-MAIL</b> accounts *prances around the computer*! It's a the beta, so not everyone can have it. You need to get invited by someone. And once someone invited you, easy as a peanut register yourself and get 1 GB space. You'll never have to erase your e-mails or attachments! You can save files there ;D Yay-hoo! My addresses are ginny.garza @ gmail.com and ogino.chihiro @ gmail.com, if you ever need to send me one GB lol"

"event","Once again, I talk about my opinion on Inuyasha yaoi. I can't believe how many people like it. Why, God, WHY? Why are people so screwed up? What's wrong with liking a straight couple. Why is it a TREND? Most of all, why Inuyasha? I mean, I can understand it if you have Naraku & Sesshoumaru (they look like girls), but Inuyasha is the straightest guy on the whole series. Really.

I know, everyone is entitled to like whatever they want, but I just can't understand it. Most of them just like it because everyone is into yaoi. And I'm neutral until they mess up with Inuyasha. One thing is that people find <i>cute</i> some sort of atraction between both of them, and another thing is that they snog each other and climax in a sex scene. It's WRONG!!!!

I know what you're thinking: ""Poor Ginny, she's so into Inuyasha she can't talk about anything else"". Lol."

<b>Update about how I feel/what I'm doing:</b> I fit into a size 7 jeans! What the deuce! I have been maintaining my 20-in-20 challenge on my other blog. I added some running because I realized the end goal is coming up. I feel amazingly good. I wore a short skirt today and felt confident. What's very weird is changing my relationship with myself. I can't think of myself as a fat girl any more, yet part of me still does. I'm NOT big, but I am so used to thinking of myself that way that I find myself correcting my thinking. Doing BJJ a lot - and supplementing that with deadlifts.

<b>Short term motivators:</b> Fit into my new gi pants! Hit 140 before Christmas time.

<b>Long term motivators:</b> Purple belt. Hitting my maintenance size.

<b>Major road blocks:</b> None right now!

<b>Exercises that make me feel good:</b> Jiu jitsu and handstand pushups!

<b>Accomplishments thus far:</b> I can now do 5 unassisted chinups. I eat clean 90% of the time and I feel great. Losing 1/3 of my body weight! Whaaaat?"

Current weight: 158.7 - a 72.3 lb loss
Goal weight: Not a weight goal now, but a body fat percentage - 20-22%. Currently 31.8%

<b>Update about how I feel/what I'm doing:</b> I've been on a roll with the weight loss. I downloaded the Zombies, Run! app, which is a running game, and I try to go running 2-3 times per week. I am unhappy with how my clothes fit now - it's time for new clothes. I currently wear size 8 pants. I have consistently gone to the gym 2-3 times per week since January. Still weighing myself daily. I don't drink soda any more, save for maybe once per week - it's black coffee and water. I started posting pictures of myself online showing my body composition changes - I try to take them once per week, but sometimes I skip a week. Still - have been doing that consistently for 14 weeks. I like that I have consistency in my life.

<b>Short term motivators:</b> Fit into my new gi pants! They're too tight! I want to get my squat form good so I can start piling on those weights! 

<b>Long term motivators:</b> Bench pressing my body weight - squatting 1.5 times my body weight - dead lifting 2 times my body weight. Get those fat pockets behind my knees VANQUISHED! Get back to BJJ.

<b>Major road blocks:</b> Herniated disc. Sleep - just flat out don't get enough.

<b>Exercises that make me feel good:</b>
Jiu jitsu and lifting weights.

<b>Accomplishments thus far:</b>
Consistently cooking my own food - I eat plain now. Mostly from basic ingredients. I indulge a bit here and there, but overall I have a very clean diet. I've learned some self control. TWO UNASSISTED CHINUPS!

<b>Next weeks goal:</b> Complete 3 missions in Zombies, Run! Eat totally clean for 5 days. Get to the gym and jiu jitsu 3x."

"event","I made some big changes this month - I started running. Just 2-3 times per week, just 10-20 minutes at a time. I haven't been tracking my food but have continued eating the same positive things I had been.

These are my numbers: I hit a new low on these dates:

3/5 164.5    3/6 163.5    3/8 163.3   3/10 163.1 (1.4 lbs)

There are, of course, a lot of ups and downs.

<img src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7226/7305946858_0fc900b340_z.jpg"">
Stained and dirty but used daily. Black = daily weight. Green = Saturday weights. Red = Weight loss lows.

My weight is at a new low: 158.7 Excellent! I was 211.8 in January 2010. Wow - 53.1 lbs in the last 2ish years. I'm down from 231 in February 2006 - total of 72.3 lbs. My original goal weight was 150, then I changed it to 160 because it felt so out of reach. Now 150 is NOT where I will be stopping. I'm just amazed.

It seems like for most people the bigger they are, the faster the weight comes off. For me, it's the opposite. I think it's because I intentionally made small, lasting changes rather than large, drastic ones. Because of that, they stuck, and it's been lately that my changes were bigger, because they were built upon that foundation. It's a great feeling.

I feel very good. I am very satisfied. Now I have to somehow create a new body image and replace my old body image. I'm so used to being a BIG GIRL that it's REALLY hard not to think of myself like that any more. REALLY hard. I am DEFINITELY NOT a bbw now. I'm DEFINITELY NOT fat. I'm DEFINITELY NOT required to shop at the big girl's store. This is a strange feeling - like I somehow stepped into a new body and can't connect my brain with reality.

"event","So I'll be starting an elimination diet next week. I'm curious as to whether any specific foods in my diet are hampering weight loss, or causing some bloating. On occasion my guts get all twisted up and I'd like to narrow down the cause.

I haven't quite decided if I'll do the full elimination for 3 weeks or 4. During this time I will eliminate: eggs, shellfish, seafood (except salmon), soy, wheat, tree nuts, peanuts, citrus, alcohol, strawberries, tomatoes, potatoes, peppers, eggplant, pork, beef, and buckwheat.

Foods I will rely fairly heavily on are: vegetables, chicken, lamb, salmon, lentils and flax.

After the 3-4 weeks I will reintroduce one food at a time. Starting with eggs. So on the day I introduce eggs, I will eat eggs 2-3 times that day, then not eat it for 2 days and see if any symptoms develop. If they do, I eliminate them permanently. If they don't, I integrate them into my diet. Next will be dairy, then strawberries, etc.

I'll be also watching caloric intake during this time: 1600 calories per day, with roughly a 20/30/50 balance of carbs/fat/protein, though with fat/protein more flexible. This means 80g of carbs per day.

I contacted some people on Craigslist. I plan to purchase this month: a salad spinner, a food processor, a slow cooker, and a soup pot. I want to experiment with the slow cooker and making some beans.

My biggest challenge is that my housekeeper makes DELICIOUS food that is cheap for me. 30,000 per week. Amazing. But to keep accurate track of calories/macros I can't do that. :(

I'm planning a trip to Costco and will load up on chicken breasts, lamb, and the like. Blargh!"

"event","It's interesting to see the difference between me now Feb 2012 and me 6 years ago, Feb 2006. Here's an update:

Starting weight: 231
Current weight: <s>231</s> <b>172 - a 59 lb loss</b>
Goal weight: 150 <b>Now my goal is 135/140, but this is not definitive.</b>

<b>Update about how I feel/what I'm doing</b> I think I look HOT! I started doing jiu jitsu in 2010, however in October 2011 I herniated a disc in my back and have been unable to do BJJ for the last three months. I have started weight lifting and actually joined a gym. I'm happy with how I look, though I do have to admit that I tend to focus a lot of negative attention on my legs and on my tummy. I went from a size 38H to a 38C bra, and I'm currently wearing a size 10 pants. I joined Fitocracy and have been consistently logging points, which is amazing. I weigh myself daily and average the results each week. I rarely drink soda any more, and rarely drink. 

<b>Short term motivators:</b> <i>I want to look good, Orycon in October, summer coming up, not having to worry about a store having my size pants, feeling better about myself, I want to feel good about what I've eaten at the end of the day, I want to feel guilt free at the end of the day, I want to feel good about how I look in pictures, able to touch the ground with my palms.</i>
<b>Updated:</b> Go to sleep by midnight. Drink a full bottle of water every day. I want to go on an elimination diet, cut down to 1600 calories and have approximately 20% calories come from carbs, with a goal of 30% from fat and 50% from protein, but if the fat/protein ratios are off, that's fine. So that puts me at about 80g of carbs per day.

<b>Long term motivators:</b> <i>BE HEALTHY! Fit into my Wonder Woman costume, able to walk up stairs without getting winded, be much more flexible: I'd like to be able to sit in a lotus position, Move to a primarily vegetarian diet with some fish and chicken, but try to maintain at least a few days a week completely vegetarian and maybe only have red meat maybe twice a week.</i>
<b>Updated:</b> Hahaha don't care about most of those things any more! Long term motivators now include earning Fitocracy milestones - such as benchpressing my bodyweight - right now I can struggle with 45 kilos. I want to do one unassisted chin up. 

<b>Major road blocks:</b> <i>in my head I'm thinner than I actually am, I love sitting in front of the television, most of my favorite crafts all require sitting, I love sitting in front of the computer>>>>SITTING!!!, binge drinking, constant eating, losing motivation quickly.</i>
<b>Updated:</b> Interesting - now I find that in my head I'm heavier than I actually am. I don't binge drink any more - I rarely drink now, and when I do it's often just one beer or one glass of wine. I find that I often crave just coming home and unwinding. Going to BJJ and the gym take up a fair amount of time. My herniated disc has prevented me from doing what I REALLY love - jiu jitsu. I also am terrible at cooking, so I prefer paying my housekeeper to cook for me, but when she does, I have zero ability to accurately keep track of food. I still struggle with television - I recently realized I actively watched 39 shows, and I cut 9 of them. That's still 30 tv shows! For the past several months my weight loss has been at a bit of a stand still - I've hovered around 170-175 for at least 4 months. Sleep - I always seem to go to bed REALLY late. >_<

<b>Healthier foods I love: Updated - crossed out foods I no longer love</b>
<i>FRUITS: oranges, kiwi, bananas, strawberries, blue berries, raspberries, <s>Whole wheat tortillas,</s> Fat free refried beans, Chicken, Seafood, Fat free yogurt, Vegetarian sandwiches with lots of veggies, Broccoli, cauliflower, avocados, asparagus, <s>pickles,</s> cucumbers, radishes, mushrooms, Garlic, horseradish, Salsa/hot sauce, <s>Diet Dr Pepper,</s> Soups (lentil, pinto bean, chicken noodle), <s>Virgin bloody marys, Healthy cereals! Shredded wheat, corn flakes, grape nuts</s></i>
<b>Updated to add:</b> smoked salmon, persimmons, Asian pears, kimchi, eggs, flax, black coffee

<b>Exercises that make me feel good:</b>
<i>walking, weights, dancing!</i>
<b>Updated to add</b>: I love doing jiu jitsu. I like lifting weights. I love picking up a barbell. I love doing pushups. 

<b>Accomplishments thus far:</b>
<i>joined swing dancing class and have gone to two extra dances, started walking, found a free gym (I'm a student), began my juice fast to kick start my motivation, created this new journal, wrote everything above</i>
<b>Updated to add</b>: I have an actual gym membership now. I've consistently gone to the gym since the start of January. I recently did a set of 30, and one week I did 1000 pushups. Sincerely.

<b>This weeks goal:</b> <i>Walk 1+ miles five times this week, Go to the gym once, Go dancing once, Maintain my juice fast until Friday, allowing potential for whole veggies or fruits, Only have four drinks on Friday night, buy a scale this weekend, measure my body</i>
My goal for next week is to start my elimination diet and start tracking calories again. My goal is to observe BJJ 3x and to go to the gym 3x."

I reduced my calorie intake to 1600 calories per day. Since then I've been losing. Check it out:

3/12 87.8 (193.5)
3/14 85.9 (189.3)
3/22 86.3 (190.2)
3/25 86.1 (189.8)
3/26 84.7 (186.7)
3/28 83.9 (184.9)

My size 16 jeans are too big for me now, but the size 14 are a tiny bit too small in the belly--I mushroom out of it. This is a super exciting feeling for me.

My weight loss has always been difficult. I was looking back over some old journal entries. Back in July 2002 I was at 170 and fit a size 12 jeans. February 2003 I was back up to 191. From there it really has been an uphill climb, up in weight (up to something like 231 at my heaviest) and up in jeans sizes--up to a size 22. I am terribly excited that I'm in a downward losing trend. It's healthier and I feel better.

Now it feels a bit like ""How did I ever fit into a size 12 jeans?"" and then I ask ""How did I NOT maintain that?"" >_<

Part of it was realizing I ate like a fat person--I was eating fried foods all the time, crazy over chocolate, desserts, drinking sodas every single day, and completely inactive. It's no wonder I gained weight and couldn't keep it off--not enough was changing in my life.

Remembering that I fit a size 12 at 170 lbs makes me realize that I AM able to one day fit a size 8. It's NOT out of the realm of possibility. That's exciting to me.

When I lose another 1.7 kilos I'll be technically down another weight category in BJJ! (men's division) WOOT!"

I've started on the South Beach Diet. I've cut sugars and carbs down. When I have indulged it has cut the amount of crap I've indulged by by about 90%. For example, on Saturday I had 5 pieces of pizza over the course of the whole day, plus half an oreo and half a mini kit kat. I had no other junk, but had I think 2 Diet Cokes. A normal day of gaming I would have had at least 5 or 10 oreos, 5 kit kats, probably closer to 8 or 10 pieces of pizza plus the breadsticks, chips, and regular coke.

So yeah, most days I'm eating eggs, meat, veggies, and now I've added Kimchi. I LOVE KIMCHI! :)

I do need to integrate exercise into my routine. :("

1.  I like color variations in my food.  If I have tofu, I do not want to have a pale fruit like kiwi or pineapple and a pale vegetable.  I try specifically to switch up colors in my food.  For example, today I had avocados on my quinoa, so instead of just putting peas in my lunch, I put some nice pink radishes as well, and rounded it out with bright red raspberries.

2.  I like sweet & savory, savory, sweet, sweet & sour, and tart.  I *hate* bitter.  hatehatehate.

3.  Bento lets me ""paint by numbers"" instead of start from scratch.  This is my box:

<img src=""http://www.boomspeed.com/scifigal/locknlock.jpg"" />

For lunch I fill one compartment with fruit, one compartment with veggies and two compartments with protein.  For dinner I fill one compartment with fruit, one with protein, and two with veggies.  EASY!

I get my lock & locks from Uwujimaya.  They're around $5-$6 apiece.  I <3 lock & locks."

Today I made some healthier choices.  I put on my plate two turkey sausages, about three eggs of scrambled eggs, grapes, and a cup and a half of Cracklin' Oat Bran cereal with skim milk.  I chose to throw away one of the sausages, and about one of the eggs.  I also found out that Cracklin' Oat Bran is not a recommended cereal choice, so this weekend I'm going to go shopping for some healthier snacks/foods.

I've been sticking to a toasted sandwich at lunch:  whole grain bread, one slice of havarti cheese, two slices of smoked turkey, half an avocado, tomato, lettuce, red/green peppers, pepproncini, and pickles.  I like my lunches.

I've also been drinking more water.  Over the last week I've had /much/ less soda.  I would guesstimate that I've drunk at least 1/3 to 1/2 less soda than I normally do.

Yesterday my friend and I got together and were going to order pizzas.  Instead we ordered awesome chicken salads from Wing Zone.  I got the grilled chicken salad.  It was sooo yummy, and so much healthier.  We also drank water instead of soda.

I've been trying to encourage people to think of me when they want to exercise.  I don't want to do it by myself, but I certainly will if no one else will.

I am putting together my SG1 outfit, and would like to lose sizes by the summertime and DEFINITELY by halloween.  I don't want to be one of the science fiction girls that looks like I am twice the size of most girls."

I'm glad that I have people like <lj user=""entropy13""> to tell me how I should pace myself.  Still:  10 weeks!  Go me!

If, however, I am signed up for a class, I will go as much as I possibly can.  I'm very excited about this, and it will double the amount of exercise I currently do.  Minimum.

I weighed myself, and I'm definitely going down.  I weighed in at 223.2lbs.  yay!

I've been eating a lot of whole grain cereals lately, and sticking to diet sodas when I *need* a soda.  I figure that right now it's a choice I can stick with...cutting out soda won't work long term for me.  It's the small long term changes that really matter, not the big grandiose gestures that fade away and do not take permanent hold.

I have lots of swing dancing friends now:  dj, amy, julz, joolie, matthew and tim.  Six people I can call when I have the urge to go dancing.  I'm really excited about that."

I also bought some weights:  some 8 pound free weights, 1 pound wrist weights, and 2.5 pound ankle/wrist weights.  I also got pilates bands, a pedometer, and a jumprope.  AND, I bought a bat'leth.

I found out it costs $2 to bring a guest to the Seattle U gym.  I also answered an ad asking for activity partners, and I even placed this ad:

<i><b>Own a bat'leth?  Wanna get in shape?</b>
I just purchased a Bat'leth, partly because I have wanted one for a really long time, and partly because I thought it would make a really really fun geeky upper body workout! About me: I'm 29, a con-goer, pretty normal looking, but geeky as hell. 

I'd love to find someone /whatever/ age who owns a bat'leth or can make one out of plywood and wants to develop a workout routine using it! Am I fishing in the wrong place? </i>

I'm going to start wearing the 2.5 lb weights on my wrists when I cross stitch.  I also made friends with <lj user=""entropy13"">, who is very health focused, so that's awesome as well.

I really feel like I have things solidly in place for me to get to a healthier place.  Plus, assuming the scales were the same, I lost about 10 lbs since last time I was in the dr. office about a month and a half ago.  I weighed in at 231.  Hooray for me!"

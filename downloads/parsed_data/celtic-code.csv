I still do the YMCA thing, and tutoring, and I've added T.A.ing to the list so I am always running somewhere or another and just an all around basketcase. I have one day off a week (fridays) and those days are usually filled with doctors appointments. But I am about done. Basically, all they will do for me is say I'm fat and I nee dto lose weight.. well no shit, but what the hell else do I need to do? David and I have changed to a practically organic food style and eat nothing with sugar or sugar type substance and meals are completely balanced and I am taking two dance classes plus other workout sessions throughout the week.. Come to fine out I've got a mini tumor in my brain that again no one will do a god damn thing about. Ya know how I was so excited because I got this kinda sorta insurance? Well no, their funds have been cut back so they won't let me go get a CT scan of my brain to find out how serious this thing is, they won't send me to physical therapy, hell I can't even go see a nutritionist to find out if there is anything else at all I can do. This country sucks ass sometimes. I swear, we are the only fucking country in the industrialized world where health care (ya know, the thing that helps you stay alive!) is a fucking priviledge.....

Okay, I took a breather, I'm okay now, in other news, I have none.. lol Still waiting to hear from UCSD (The acceptace period goes til the 30th), graduate in a month... oh, yeah, and my counselor in college recommended me for some award.. I hate recognition, but I guess if it means monetary, I can deal cause well.. i need money. You can send me some if you want....... Okay, fine, didn't think so, but I had to try. Okay, signing off, hopefully I'll write again soon though."

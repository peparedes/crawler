"event","Hey guys! I know it's been a while since I have posted anything. I'm still around, I promise.

So what's new with me? Well I am in my final year at UT Martin. I will graduate in Spring of '08 with a BFA in Graphic Design.  During the summer I worked at Walgreens in the Green Hills area of Nashville. I enjoyed working there...I like my managers and my co-workers. Couldn't have asked for a better group to work with. I got to work there with my best friend and also met the guy who I'm now dating there. He and I have been dating for almost 6 months now. I love him very much. He is so good to me. I couldn't have asked for a better guy to come into my life. I believe God has a plan for us and has His reasons for why he crossed our paths this summer. I don't get to see him very often when I am here at school, so I miss him a lot. But we try to talk to each other everyday. Not always easy but we are making it work.

Well my train of thought has apparently derailed because I can't think of anything else to add. So if you guys have any thoughts or want to know anything...leave me a comment.

Lots of love,
~Tari"

"event","Well my day was going well until about 6 pm this evening.  That's what time my Martial Arts class starts.  Don't get me wrong, I love Martial Arts.  However, tonight was apparently just not my night.

Lia & I were hanging out at the beginning of class chatting.  We had to do an eval for the class.  Once we were done, Lia & I started chatting & goofing around.  Well, while she was sitting on the floor (which is a padded mat), I walked up to her & played like I was gonna stomp her ankles.  So I hopped up & kicked my left foot out like I was gonna stomp her but didn't.  

Apparently my feet didn't want to cooperate with me tonight.  When I came back down (with a majority of my weight on my right foot), I'm guessing I came down on the side of my right foot instead of flat footed.  Well this through my balance off causing me to side step my ankle (if you know what I mean by that then you understand what I did).  Seeing as how a majority of my weight was already on that leg, I begain to fall over on my already overturned ankle.  And as I collapse, what do I hear?

You guessed it...a POP!  Yep, my ankle popped.  Meaning that I have a very badly sprained ankle.  I had an atheletic (sp?) trainer look at my ankle & he says it's a Grade 1 Sprain (I believe that is how he phrased it) with major swelling.  So I've been icing it & keeping it wrapped.  Hopefully it'll be better in a week.

I'm just grateful it didn't break......again.  Night all.

For the most part I agree with him.  However, I do try to put things at the very back of my mind and lock them away, but somehow they still manage to find their way to the surface whether I really want them to or not.  Hopefully next semester will be better.

Right now, I'd love to hang out with some of my close friends...I miss some of them.  Maybe I'll get to see some of them when I go home for Thanksgiving.

Well I think I'm gonna go loose myself in the world of virtual reality because sometimes I think virtual reality is better than reality itself.

That's right...I'm too high for Cloud 9 but not high enough for Cloud 13.  That Cloud is currently roped off...not sure if or when I'll ever get back to that Cloud.

I love hearing Edwin McCain perform live.  He is a wonderful singer and a great songwriter and guitar-player.  Plus it is awesome to see and hear his fellow band members playing alongside him.  Seeing Larry Chaney, Dave Harrison, and Craig Shields playing helps bring to the foreground who these guys are and the instruments they play that we hear on Edwin's albums, instead of viewing it the other instruments as just background sound accompanying Edwin and his guitar.

Edwin McCain played several, several songs tonight (pretty much covering all my favorites and then some).  Hearing him live, he is able to give better to some of his songs that he just can't do in the studio.  It is awesome to hear how his songs sound on the albums and then hear him perform them live.  Half the time it's a totally different sound and feel.

This is now my fourth time seeing him in concert.  I now own pretty much all of his albums.  Is it bad that not only, upon hearing the beginning of his songs, I can tell you the name of the song as well as the album it is on??  I also bought one of his shirts that they were selling tonight.  I own one of his DVDs and I am working on getting his other one.  I am also going to be keeping up with his tour so I can find out the next time he will be in Nashville again.

If you have heard his music and like it, I'd suggest seeing him in concert.  It is a wonderful experience.  Also, in case some of you who are fans don't already know this, he has been picked up by a record label (Vangard Records) and his music is also being aired on 101.1 in Nashville...not sure how far that station reaches.  Check him out if you haven't already.  His music is great."

"event","Well Set Strike was fun tonight...not.  We got about three-fourths of the way through taking down the stage before an accident happened.  If you know anything about building a stage or have been to the play, then you may understand this.

The Prescenium (sp?) arch at the front of the stage (closest to the audience) snapped in half and fell.  We think what happened was that the flat on the right side of the stage (the right side if you are looking at the stage from out in the audience) started to come loose while we were taking other parts and flats down.  Then the corner pointing away from the stage started swaying which then caused the arch to snap down near the flat on the left of the stage.  Upon snapping, the rope helping to support it broke and the flat fell.

Well almost everyone got out of the way of the flat.  Unfortunately, JB got caught underneath it.  I'm guessing she was trying to get out of its way but the flat came down to fast and trapped her.  Luckily she was only hurt a little bit...just some bruising.  I'm just glad she didn't get hurt worse.  The bruises are on her side and her arm around her elbow.

I'm also glad we didn't have much more to do after that.  O my, that was scary.  I'm glad she is okay.

Well I've got to go study now.  Later you guys.  Good luck on mid-terms."

"event","To all my friends, I apologize if I do not seem like myself for the next couple of days.  I received some really depressing news this morning.  My mom called a little after 9am to talk with me and tell me that my great uncle (brother-in-law of my grandmother) had passed away.  Not expecting it to, this news hit me really hard.  I have been crying on and off all morning.  Right now I feel like I could still cry.  

While he was still in good health, I loved talking to him when I would see him at Thanksgiving.  He was a really good guy.  He would come over with his son (my cousin), Steve.  Mom is going to get Steve's address for me so I can write to him.  This past Thanksgiving, Casper (my great uncle) was not in the best of health.  He could barely walk and was hardly aware of anything around him.  But I guess I didn't think he would pass away this soon.  I miss him.  He was the last remaining WWII Veteran, that I know of, in my family.  This coming Thanksgiving will be different without him there.  It will be kind of weird to see Steve and not see Casper with him.  O I hope Steve does come this year.  If I knew how to post a picture in this blog I would show you guys a picture of him.  

Well I think I'm gonna go now.
Love to all,
Tari (aka Lauren)"

"event","What's new?  Hmm...Well I am currently taking 6 classes: Drawing II, History of Art, Mixed Media, Theatre Workshop, Using Color, and Karate.  Three of these classes I have with Ronnie (sometimes I wonder if that's a good thing).  We are taking Mixed Media, Using Color, and Karate together.

I am currently rooming with Nova this semester.  It's good to room with someone again that I get along with.  Nova and I are also taking Karate together.

I've started going to the Interfaith on Thursday nights.  I kind of like going over there.  But I'm still going to try to go over to the COCSC on Tuesday nights.  

I went over to Interfaith on Friday night as well and just hung out.  My friend Shawn made Vegetable Beef Soup because he couldn't eat the chili they had made.  We watched the movie ""Ray"".  It was good, at least what I saw of it was.  I left about half to three-fourths of the way through.  I may rent it tho and watch it all the way through.  Anyone up for a movie night?
When I got back to my room, I got a call from Harold informing me that he was on the way down.  He and Ronnie came over to my room.  A little later, the three of us joined up with Todd and Rebecca and went to Huddle House in Union City.  It was a fun night.

Last night I went and saw ""Brokeback Mountain"" with Todd and Rebecca.  It was a good movie.  I enjoyed going and seeing it.  We went and ate at Steak'N'Shake afterwards.  Their food is good.

Right now, I am currently stuck in my dorm room working on projects and hoping Ronnie will come over soon.  :-/"

Anyways, I went and got a new Skyhawk card today.  The old one was working just fine, I had no problem with it.  It got me in wherever I needed it to.  However, it had slight problems when I would use it to get into supper.  That card reader at the door had trouble reading it.  Of course, it didn't help that the stupid git that usually mans that card reader tries to forces the card reader to read my card instead of typing in my number after the card reader fails to read my card after 2 tries.  I think he made my card worse and may have caused that card reader some issues now.  I've been told my card isn't the only one that has trouble being scanned on it.  But now I have a new card and it's all pretty.  *holds up card, starring at it in aww* YEA!!!"

"event","Well, I guess it's about time for me to actually make a real post on here...after being prompted by several friends.

So...what have I been up to lately?  Not too terribly much.  Just going to classes, being involved in extra curricular activities, trying to hang out with friends, and hanging out with my boyfriend.  <i>For any of you who may not know, Ronnie and I are back together.  Although, in a way, we never really broke up...we just did not have the means to actually ""see"" one another over the summer.  So if you wanna view it that way, Ronnie and I have sort of been together for about 7 months now.</i>  o.O
<i>7 months...wow...that's the longest relationship I have ever been in.  I hope it lasts...I really do love him.</i>

About a week ago, Ein was staying over in my room.  Well the power went out at about 1:30 am.  Sandy and I left my room at around 2:00 am because I didn't want to try and sleep with no real means to wake up by in the morning.  I grab my half-dead flashlight and we head outside.  We find T. and sit and talk with him for a bit.  We run across another friend of mine and decide to trapes over to Cooper and see if Ronnie is awake.  We get over there, my friend goes and knocks on Ronnie's door but gets no answer.  We didn't know where Ronnie was.  We then head back to Ellington and sit out on the brick wall for a bit.  Around 3:00 am or so, I see someone come out of Ellington who looked a little familiar.  Pointing my flashlight at the person to get a better look, it turned out to be Ronnie.  Turned out his friend ""D"" had come over and kidnapped him when the power went out and they had been running around the campus.  So then D., C., T., Ein, Ronnie, and I decide to walk about the campus. Upon passing by Clement, D. and C. want to go up to the 4th floor.  Ein and I tell them ""NO"" and continue walking.  They don't seem to understand why, we try to explain it to them.  (more like yelled at them after telling them ""no"" three times.)  After this, Ein, Ronnie, and I head over to Cooper and down to the basement, where we stayed until the power came back on at 4 am.  That was a fun night.  Wouldn't mind if it happened again but maybe next time it'll be on a weekend.  
<i>anyone wanna go Transformer bowling next Saturday (after Fall break)?</i>"

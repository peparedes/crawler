The power connection appears to be the problem, though there's no visible signs of damage, and the cable and charger itself are fine. I think my laptop must have been accidentally knocked / dropped one time too many and an internal connection has come loose.

This is rather annoying as the company whom I purchased this thing from went into liquidation over a year ago, so the chances of getting it repaired 'properly' are slim at best.

I still have my desktop computer so I won't be completely without internet access, but it's still going to be rather a pain as I'm incredibly attached to this little blighter now that I've had it for so long.


Anyway, I'm trying to inform as many online-friends as possible of my predicament, so if [ you ] know someone whom it seems obvious I've been unable to contact through some medium or other, please pass on the message that I will be out of contact even longer than usual.


Yeah, this probably means I won't be updating LJ again for *ages*, depending on what happens to this. If worst comes to worst, I'll buy a new one and somehow get the files transferred over (even though I love this, it is getting old in computing terms - March 2005).


And on a sidenote: I have a seriously bad cold that's got me coughing like a nicotine addict with bronchitis and a feather duster stuck in his lungs, which in turn has caused a headache of migraine proportions and an exceedingly sore throat.

Life's good, wouldn't you agree? @_@



I have very little battery life left so this'll have to be the extent of the message, I'm afraid.


Goodbye for now..."

Hello there. My name is Jon. What's yours? I'm an infrequent user of this site so I'm wondering just what it was that drew you to my little corner of it, you see... 

I'm generally a private person and it takes a fair bit for me to feel comfortable calling someone a friend. But, if you're up to the task of bearing with my personality, I might let you see the nicer side once in a while. Anything's better than the Dark Side, right? =P

So, if you for some reason aren't repulsed by the person who's writing this, leave a nice little comment just here explaining why you'd like to get to know him (slightly) better.

You don't have to write a nice comment, however, you could just leave a witty sentence, or even single letter. Whatever floats your boat.

Well, that's all you're getting from me 'til I get something in return.


May the Force be with you, always..."

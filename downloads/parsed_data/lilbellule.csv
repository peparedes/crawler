"event","Tonight I went to a seminar at my gym called ""Weights for Weight Loss.""  While it was highly entertaining (the personal trainer that gave it is a hoot), I didn't really learn anything I didn't already know.  Still, it's nice to know that I at least had the right information as far as weight lifting goes.  They also had a dietitian there which I thought was great, and I asked her afterwards about combining vegetarianism and strength training.  She confirmed that my problem when I was lifting heavy was probably that I wasn't taking in enough protein and that's why I was so danged hungry all the time.  That's a tough problem to solve though, given what I already eat.  It's going to take some work and planning I think.  The good thing is that she didn't outright dismiss a vegetarian diet as being incompatible with strength training, so that was encouraging.

But anyway, the point is that the seminar has got me thinking about hiring a personal trainer.  I've used a trainer before and it was great, but I used her in an instruction-only capacity to teach weightlifting techniques and supervise my form until I was comfy enough to go on my own.  I've never had somebody personally overseeing my fitness routine and progress for an extended period of time.  I think it might be fun and shake things up a bit, as I've been feeling stale and unmotivated with my usual stuff lately.  I'm trying to justify the cost though and that's tough.  But I suppose there's not really a commitment beyond whatever sessions I initially purchase so I could just buy one package and see how it goes.  I think I would try and schedule with the guy who taught the seminar as he seems very knowledgeable and also fun, which is definitely a good thing when working out."

"event","Today at Best Buy, Shaun and I got into an argument over the improbability of the metal bikini outfit thing that the chick on the <a href=""http://www.ign.com/games/rift-storm-legion/pc-135457"">Rift: Storm Legion</a> expansion box was wearing.  I say it wouldn't even stay up, let alone stop any kind of weaponry.  Shaun claims that it might be attached in the back and that's how it stays up.  But we all know that nobody (that makes video games anyway) cares that <a href=""http://boobsdontworkthatway.tumblr.com/day/2012/12/06/"">boobs don't work that way</a> (NSFW, but flippin hilarious).

Anyway the funny part, besides the argument itself, was the guy down the aisle listening to us and laughing while trying to pretend that he wasn't.  I totally saw you, dude!"

"event","We took down the Christmas decorations today.  That always makes me a little bit sad, not because I miss the baubles and shiny things (though they are nice) but because I miss the lights.  Christmas lights are what make the ever-darkening dreariness of December better.  And they make everything seem warmer somehow.  Now I just have to remind myself that we have passed the solstice, so each day is ever so slightly getting longer again.

I'm definitely looking forward to being able to spend more time outside again.  I'm just too much of a cold-weather wimp to enjoy walks outside when it is so cold.  And running during the winter is o-u-t.  I spend most of the season paranoid that I am going to fall and kill myself just walking, so no way am I running anywhere.  Good thing the gym is indoors and warm!  Though it does get crowded this time of year.  I was amazed today because we got there 25 minutes before the class I wanted to take started and we were #17 and #18 and the class completely filled up 10 minutes later.  I think that's probably a record.

We went to Strong, which is an instructor-led free weight routine set to music.  It's pretty fun, though it's hard to lift very heavy weights in stuff like squats and lunges since there is no rack to assist in getting the weight on my back.  I'm limited to what I can press over my head (when tired) which is not reliably much more than 30-40 pounds.  I've been doing 30 for a while now and really should move up to 40 soon.  Anyway, it's a fun class.  Shaun came with me today and didn't totally hate it, so score one for that.  Though he said that the music just made him want to dance rather than lift weights, so I think we will go to Zumba tomorrow and see how he likes that.  And I can try out my new outfit!

As a Christmas fitness gift to myself, I got a totally cute new outfit from Prana (<a href=""http://www.prana.com/kira-top.html?color=Plum"">Top in purple</a>, <a href=""http://www.prana.com/satori-pant.html?color=Black"">pants in black</a>, and <a href=""http://www.prana.com/neah-shrug.html?color=Plum"">shrug in purple, my favorite part!</a>, which is a high-end yoga clothing company.  I usually scoff at the idea of $80 yoga pants, but I've tried all kinds of the cheap ones and I always hate them.  My two original pairs of cheap pants (no longer made so I can't just go get new ones) that I actually did like are now so old that they have holes in awkward spots and I really shouldn't wear them in public anymore (though they make great lounge at home pants!).  So finally I decided to see if the $80 ones are actually worth it.  It makes me laugh though, because this outfit is now the most expensive outfit I own by far (except for my wedding dress), and I bought it to sweat in.  I figure it will be great for both yoga and Zumba classes though, so I will definitely get some use out of it."

"event","Well 2013, here we are.

The end of 2012 was pretty good, with lots of time spent visiting family and friends.  Christmas with Shaun's family went well.  I made the gingerbread house and train for decorations with some help from Shaun and his Mom and they turned out great!  I think I am going to try and build one for Festival of Trees this year, assuming I remember in time to sign up.

I got some nice gifts, mostly baking related from Shaun's parents.  His brother got me an awesome Iowa t-shirt that I love, and Shaun got me a Kate Spade bag and wallet that I &hearts;.  I got Shaun a replica blaster and belt to complete his Han Solo outfit for wearing to cons and such in the future.  Which reminds me, I need to see about getting a Princess Leia wig as well...

The weekend after Christmas, we went to the Chicago suburbs to visit with some of Shaun's college friends, which was a lot of fun.  It's been a while since we've seen Brad and Jenna and the others.  There was a lot of fun gaming, including Telestrations (aka telephone-pictionary) which is my new favorite party game.  

There was even more Telestrations action on New Years' Eve, when we had Jess and Nathan, Lindsey, Bryce and Jack over for a casual evening of gaming.  We ended up having so much fun playing games that we missed the ball dropping at midnight, oops!  So to remedy that, Shaun grabbed our mini disco ball and stood on a chair and we had our own countdown, which was just as good if not better than watching the TV one."

"event","I wish I wrote in here more.  So many things have happened in the last few months that are very worthy of recording and yet I haven't.  I'm still planning on a wedding post with pics, but I haven't written that yet either.  I better get to it before I forget everything!

I also wish I took more pictures.  I think my resolution for 2013 (I don't usually make them because ""resolutions"" seem empty and I believe in making a real effort to change yourself if that's what you want) is going to be to do a better job with the blog - more writing and more pictures.  Maybe I need a new focus besides the minutia of my daily life.  

I'm not sure what else I do enough to blog about though.  Fitness is a constant in my life now (hooray for that I suppose!), as is nerdy stuff, baking and crafting, but I'm not sure I'm far enough into any of those worlds to solely dedicate my blog to the topic.   I'm not quite sure if there's enough room in the blogosphere for one more crafter-baker-fitness-nerd.

I'll give it some thought."

"event","I get married next weekend.  And to the 80 million people who have asked me this question in the last few months: I am ready.

I am <i>so</i> ready.  And I don't just mean that I'm finished with all my wedding projects either.  Though I should note, this is like the one time in my life I've been finished with projects well in advance of the deadline (take that, 18 years of school!).  I guess working on project stuff is easier when you really want to.  Who knew!

But beyond that, I'm ready to move on with my life.  Getting married is a huge step.  Something that responsible adults do.  I sometimes still feel caught in a limbo between being an adult and not and I think this will help.  It's strange how easy it was to slip into a life where I don't see or talk to my parents every day and where I have complete independence over what I do with my time for each minute of the day.  I work, I help Shaun take care of our life together, rinse and repeat.  It sure seems like a grownup life, but I don't often feel that way.  I mean, we even have a house, but I still feel like a little kid playing pretend.  I think getting married will make everything a little more real.

And I love Shaun so much.  I think we're a fantastic match.  We have similar life goals and values, our strengths work together, and our weaknesses complement to minimize problems rather than magnify them.  I feel ridiculously lucky to have found someone who loves me so much to the point where I don't know what I did to deserve it.  But whatever it is, I want to keep doing it.

Introspection aside, I think the wedding is going to be awesome.  I really hope everything goes smoothly and that people have fun.  Today I'm going to start packing up the wedding stuff to take it to my parents' house next week.  It'll be nice to get the dining room back from weddingland mania, but I'll miss having so many little projects to work on.  I really like doing that sort of thing.  I guess I'll just have to start doing little things for the house instead.  Work on my goal of having a house that looks like it came out of a magazine (but a little more lived in).  

<lj-cut text=""A few of my wedding projects"">Here are a few of my wedding DIY projects.  I didn't take a lot of pictures of wedding prep stuff, but these are a few of my favorite projects.

<a href=""http://lilbellule.livejournal.com/pics/catalog/3943/46037"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/lilbellule/1282935/46037/46037_original.jpg"" alt=""IMG_0914"" title=""IMG_0914"" width=""300"" height=""225"" /></a>
I kept seeing these pretty hangers in wedding blogs and fell in love.  I couldn't justify the $25/hanger price so I decided to make my own!  $5 for 5 hangers, $4 for wire, and $3 for ribbon sure beats the Etsy prices.  Though I did have to spend about an hour just learning how to tie pretty bows....

<a href=""http://lilbellule.livejournal.com/pics/catalog/3943/45574"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/lilbellule/1282935/45574/45574_original.jpg"" alt=""IMG_0910"" title=""IMG_0910"" width=""300"" height=""225"" /></a>
Our escort cards/favors.  I wasn't going to have favors but then my Mom pointed out that our wedding date is Sweetest Day and I became stuck on the idea of having at least a little bit of candy.  And once I saw the Han Solo in Carbonite ice cube tray, I was sold!

<a href=""http://lilbellule.livejournal.com/pics/catalog/3943/45498"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/lilbellule/1282935/45498/45498_original.jpg"" alt=""IMG_0907"" title=""IMG_0907"" width=""300"" height=""225"" /></a>
I really have no idea why, but I love these stupid mustaches on sticks.  So I made some and a bunch of other accessories-on-sticks.  This is a small sampling of what will be at the photobooth.

One of my bigger projects for the wedding was to make Shaun's Han Solo vest.  I think it turned out pretty well!  Note that the original vest has a lot of pockets and things and Shaun elected to leave those off initially and I'll add them later when he reuses the vest for cosplay.

"event","Shaun and I officially are licensed to wed in the State of Iowa.  That's pretty cool, but it wasn't an entirely happy day because I had a minor identity crisis and emotional breakdown over changing my name.

I thought I had it all planned out.  I'd just keep my name as is, tacking Shaun's surname on the end of it, so I'd have two last names.  No hyphen, as I don't really care for how that looks aesthetically.  But then, about an hour before we needed to leave to get our license (I'd have to make my name decision when we applied) I started worrying about how complicated that might be to change with various offices that can't deal with someone having two last names.  About how people would just call me by Shaun's name anyway since as a culture we're not really used to people having two last names.

Enter crisis.  I don't like any of my choices - two last names is too complicated, a hyphenated name is too long and unwieldy, I don't want to lose my maiden name, I don't want to lose my middle name by replacing it with my maiden name, and I don't want to <i>not</i> share Shaun's name.  I really had no freaking idea what to do, short of having both of us change our names to something different (Shaun Solo has a nice ring to it).  Unfortunately in this instance, Shaun was no help whatsoever.  His chief concern was largely the ease of the name change process, making the logical choice be to just keep my name the same.  After all, he reasoned, we'd still be just as married.  True, but part of me really wanted that personal connection that sharing a name offers, not to mention it makes a lot of life situations easier.  Really who wants to have to show your marriage certificate just to qualify for a couples' membership at the gym?  Or to get visitation rights at the hospital?

In the end, and at the last minute, I decided that the way to get closest to what I wanted was to add my maiden name as a second middle name and take Shaun's last name as my surname.  It's not exactly the same, but at least I get to keep both my maiden and middle names.  I will miss being addressed by my maiden name, but I'm excited to share a name with Shaun.

The funny thing is, I didn't even really think I <i>liked</i> my maiden name that much until it came time to lose it.  But it's been a part of me for a long time, and I'd be sad to see it go.  Same with my middle name, which I've always been fond of.  This way I get to keep both, at least in a small way.  Most people won't ever see them, but I know they're there."

"event","Shaun and I have been trying to take a dance class for a little while now, so we can be not so inept at real dancing, rather than the ""just move yo self to the beat"" kind.  It would be especially nice to have this done before our wedding next month (also, wedding next month holy cow).  It hasn't worked out at all for various reasons, so we finally bit the bullet and signed ourselves up for a few private lessons.

The first was last night and it wasn't too bad!  We brought our first dance music in so he could hear what kind of style we're interested in, but I think we'll be learning more than just one style.  He started off by showing us some swing steps.  I took a few swing lessons in college, but that was a long time ago.  Shaun's never done any kind of formal dancing, but he picked it up really fast.  I was very proud of him!  We learned the basic step and underarm turn, cross behind and a couple of closed position things.  I don't really know the official names for things, but it was probably about 6 things which is pretty good for half an hour.

For the rest of the hour, he tried to teach us some introductory ballroom stuff and that was kind of a disaster.  He actually said that we picked up the swing so fast he thought that we'd get this too, but I don't know what was different - it felt much more awkward.  He kept telling us to just ""walk normally and put your feet where you feel like they should go.""  Well my feet wanted to go where Shaun's were and that doesn't work so well!  We practiced the dancing-walking when we got home and I think we got better at it by the end.  We'll have to practice more before next week, that's for sure.

We don't really have any good practice music though, especially for the swing.  I found some online recommendations and I'm going to see what I can find at the library today."

"event","And, we're back!  Back from GenCon that is.  And it was awesome.  The hotel situation was a little cramped, but we managed to have a good time anyway.

Event highlights included:
<b>- Orc Stomp 5K-</b> A fun run on Thursday morning to start the con off right.  This was a really enjoyable 5K.  The people were cool and friendly, and they even got a squad of orcs to start the race, which was fun.  The really great part was at the end, when a girl who finished just after me told me that Shaun and I were her inspiration to finish, since she was following us the whole way.  That's never happened to me before, and it's a good feeling!

<b>- True Dungeon-</b> Oh man, I wanted to do this last year so badly but we didn't decide we were going to the con until after it was well past sold out.  This year we made getting True Dungeon tickets a priority and it was so worth it.  (True Dungeon is basically life-sized D&D but without the role-playing characters part.  You're just yourself going on a dungeon crawl.  With real puzzles and huge animatronic dragons.  It is awesome.) Our group all had fun and we are all excited to play again next year.  We even got some good gear to save and use again!

<b>- D&D Next playtest-</b> New version of D&D coming out at some point and we got to do a playtest.  The DM was super fun and we enjoyed antagonizing him with awful puns.

<b>- Glitter Guild Burlesque-</b> This is turning into a tradition.  The dances were a little more niche-nerdy than last year but still fun.  And the hostess is a riot.

<b>- Chainmaille class-</b> I made a chainmaille bra for my monkey!  It's supposed to be a full chain shirt, but I didn't have time to finish and what I did get done looks suspiciously like a bra or a bikini top, lol.

<b>- Pole dancing class-</b> This was cool.  We learned a couple of different spins and a stand-up-from-sitting that can be used in between to make a mini-routine.  It was both harder and easier than I thought it would be.  The spins are much easier if you just stop thinking and let gravity work for you.  But wow it uses a lot of muscle strength too!


Of course, doing all these things with good friends and just spending time hanging out and going out for delicious dinners was excellent as well.  We are already making grand plans for next year's con!

My costumes went over <i>very</i> well this year.  I had fun last year and got some nice comments, but the response this year was much better.  I got a lot of compliments on my pirate costume, but not a ton of pictures.  But my Edwina Scissorhands (that's what people kept calling me) was a real crowd pleaser. It's kind of weird to walk by a group of people and hear them talking about you - ""Hey look, it's Edward Scissorhands!"", ""Oh cool, look at her!"" etc.  I also got told several times how original it was, which was nice too.  Tons of people asked for pictures, which was nice after putting a lot of effort into assembling the outfit.  This one will definitely be recycled next year and I'm hoping to do even better with the scissorhands gloves and some of the other decorative details.  

Those of you keeping score might notice there's no Jedi costume.  That's because my pirate and Edward Scissorhands outfits both require wearing the same pair of boots and my feet <i>really</i> needed a day off in between.  I didn't want to ruin a good costume with bad shoes, so I just decided to wear comfy clothes on Friday.  No regrets here!

"event","Ugh, we leave for GenCon tomorrow and I'm so bouncy I feel like I might accidentally leap out a window.

My pirate costume looks great.  I tried everything on together yesterday and my new belt and leather accessories plus the pistol I bought last year REALLY make the outfit.  I am looking forward to continuing to add pieces and making it better!

The Jedi costume is also looking pretty good.  We bought Jedi-style belts this year, which add a lot.  I think this one's not as awesome as the other two, but it's a solid costume, especially now that we have shiny painted lightsaber hilts to hang from the belts.  I really need to get better boots for it though.  I bought a fabulous brown leather trench coat for $2 at a thrift sale that will make a killer pair of boot covers but I haven't had the time to do that yet this year.

I'm ridiculously excited to wear my last costume though.  It's my new one for this year - Lady Edward Scissorhands!! I said I was going to wait until I had pictures, but that's not going to happen til after the con I guess, so time to share now.  I made a black ""leather"" skirt and top and wear fishnets and strappy leather boots with it.  For accessories, I bought 6 punk belts from Walmart, covered in rivets and metal studs.  Four of them are stacked around my stomach/waist in a corset style and the other two are slung across my chest like a bandolier.  I've got an Edward-style wig and I also made some chokers out of extra material.  

The scissorhands are foam board cut into blades sprayed with shiny metal effect paint, hot-glued to black stretchy gloves. I've looked at some tutorials for the makeup and I think I can do it.  I probably should practice today, but I'm not sure I'll have time.  I'll post pictures if I do. :)  I haven't seen this one all put together yet but I am SO EXCITED.  The only problem is that I can't really do much for myself with the gloves on.  Good thing my Saturday schedule is mostly just wandering the exhibition hall and watching the costume contest.  We are playing <a href=""http://truedungeon.com/"">True Dungeon</a> that day though, so I might have to take the gloves off for that unless I end up playing a spellcaster and don't need to use my hands.  We'll see!

Apparently I only like GenCon because it's three solid days of NERD HALLOWEEN.  I guess the games are fun too..."

"event","I did my first free weight lift of over 100 pounds yesterday.  Deadlifted 105!  So barely over 100, but still, it counts.  I plan to get it much higher than that, but everyone's gotta start somewhere and I only officially began <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-New-Rules-Lifting-Women/dp/1583333398/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1335407886&sr=8-1"">New Rules of Lifting for Women</a> last week, so I should cut myself some slack I guess.

I wish I had gotten over my free weight fears a bit sooner because my gym has been holding mini weightlifting championships for the in-house leader board.  I don't think any women have entered for any of them yet, so if I did I would win by default no matter what I lifted.  But I'm  not going to enter just to have my name put up at a measly 105 pounds.  So I wish I was higher than that, but oh well.  Maybe next year, after I've been at it a while.  Hopefully they'll have the contest again!

I also surprised myself by accidentally setting the weight for my lat pulldowns 15 pounds higher than last week and still being able to do it.  I barely finished the first set and was wondering why it seemed so hard and when I checked my sheet I discovered it was because I was doing 75 pounds when last week I only did 60.  Whoops, but I guess now I know I can do better!  Kind of makes me wonder what other lifts I could add 15 pounds to and still do..."

"event","Add a couple more wedding milestones to the list:

1)  We mailed our save the dates!  That really makes it feel like this wedding thing is actually happening, rather than just being a very elaborate figment of my imagination.  I don't feel like we really need Save the Dates, but apparently my family has all been wondering if they're invited (even though the thing is still 7 months away) so I figured it best to let people know so they can start planning.  We're hanging on to Shaun's family's cards until after Easter, when we'll be having a ""big reveal"" with those family members that attend.  Should be fun!

2) We got harassed by an awkward Bed Bath & Beyond registry consultant.  The first time we went in to register, it was a Saturday and there was a line of several couples waiting to set up registries so we just skipped it, went home and did it online.  But I wanted to have the experience of wandering around the store with the little scan gun thingy, so when we were there for an unrelated reason this morning, I asked Shaun if we could add a few things that we had skipped last time, like artwork and bedding.  So we got all set up and were just hoping that we could go off on our own when the person called over their registry consultant and he introduced himself and said he would be ""checking in on us a lot""...oh boy.  I guess that's the trouble with going early when the store is empty - they are bored and have nothing better to do than follow you around!   He kept sneaking up on us at awkward times and just standing there like we should be asking lots of questions for his expert opinions.  Then in an effort to make conversation, he'd ask us questions about our wedding and then make awkward comments.  For example, he asked where our honeymoon was going to be.  We answered Hawaii and he said ""Oh, Hawaii!  I just got a ukulele!""  And on bedding: ""I'd love to upgrade my bedding.  But then I'd need to work on spending more time there.""  Uhm.  Okay then.  You do that."

"event","Oh and I forgot the other exciting news!  Shaun and I *finally* signed up for a beginner's dance class.  I've been wanting to for months, but the classes are on a rotation and the times never seemed to work for us.  We're signed up for a 3-session East Coast Swing intro class, which isn't exactly what I wanted but it'll do to start with.  What I really want to take is a longer class they offer called Social Dance 1 which covers beginning Swing, Waltz and Nightclub 2-Step which I think would better cover the dancing situations we'll find ourselves in (ie weddings).  But we'll start with just the swing and see how it goes and Shaun said if we like the instructor we can see about a few private lessons that will better fit our schedule than the classes."

We have settled on our date, venue, caterer (and the menu!), baker (and along the dessert line - Whitey's Ice Cream!), photographer, florist (I decided in the end that the bridal party having real flowers would probably be good, though we are still using my paper ones as decorations), and save the dates (should be mailed this week!).  We have plans for our outfits (one of my coworkers asks me <i>every week</i> if I've ordered my dress yet...I think she's more worried than I am), invitations, table decorations, registry (we started but it's not really finished) and honeymoon (we have outlined plans but no reservations).  

The only major thing that's not really dealt with is the officiant.  It's been a sticky area for us, given our lack of religious affiliation and specific wishes for the ceremony.  We have asked one of my former professors and he is taking some time to consider the request.  If he decides no, my Dad has a friend who does weddings that we will ask and I'm pretty sure he'll agree.  Once we've got that squared away, I feel like there really is nothing left to worry about.  Yeah sure I have a lot of little projects I want to do, but nothing that I should be <i>worrying</i> about.  We have a date, a place and (will hopefully soon have) a person to marry us.  What more do we need?  We'll even have bonuses like guests, food, cake and flowers!  Sounds like a pretty good wedding to me!

In other life news, Shaun and I are finally adopting a pet!  We've been back and forth on the issue for months, sometimes saying yes other times saying no and never managing to settle on a kind of animal-friend.  Well I did some more research (naturally) and I found a particular species of gecko that is pretty easy to keep (doesn't eat a lot of bugs!) and is pretty tolerant of handling.  So we got our terrarium all set up and on Easter weekend, we'll be bringing our <a href=""http://jbscresties.com/jimmies.jpg"">new friend</a> home!  Isn't he cute? We haven't decided on a name yet, but Shaun pointed out that he had to be ours because out of all the geckos this breeder had for sale, this was the only one that hatched on our wedding date (10/20).  So it was meant to be! :)"

Amen to that.  My last update was, what, a month and a half ago?  Wow.  Much is the same, but I still feel like life is rocketing along and I am barely holding on.  We just got back from an awesome weekend in Chicago visiting Brad and Jenna.  Their apartment is cool and has a sweet view of the city.  We spent quite a bit of time walking around, seeing some of the sights, which was great for me because I actually haven't really been to Chicago despite living within 3 hours of it my whole life.  So I'm looking forward to the opportunity to visit friends AND see new fun things.  

The weekend totally exhausted me though.  Shaun and I went to bed at 8:30 last night and I slept until about 7:00.  I think we'll need to tweak our expectations for future weekends.  Not so much running around next time.  And we'll also have to do better prior planning.  Shaun and I wanted to take Amtrak, but apparently you have to buy tickets a month in advance to get the cheap ($13 per person each way) tickets.  I guess they go up as you get closer to the travel day, kind of like airline tickets.  So by the time we went to buy them, it was way cheaper to drive.  Driving downtown ended up being not too bad and we didn't have to do very much of it.  But it was an excellent trip and it made me realize just how much I miss having my friends nearby. :(

The other thing of note since my last update is that I've switched up my gym routine.  I was getting tired of the low weight/high rep strength training class I've been taking for a few months now, so I got myself a personal trainer to help me plan a new weight program emphasizing heavier weights and fewer lifts.  I'm just working with her once or twice every 6 weeks or so I think, so not too much.  Just enough to get a new program and learn it.  I'm not too well versed with the weight room, so it makes me much more comfortable to have a guide.  Tomorrow I will be trying the new routine on my own, and then Thursday I'll be with the trainer again to make sure I've got it right and can ask questions and such.  So far so good - I was sore for a solid 3 days after my first session, which was simultaneously awesome and annoying.  Soreness equals progress but man does it make life hard, especially when you have planned poorly and need to spend the weekend out walking around - ouch!"

"event","Wow, it's 2012 already.

The end of 2011 was a blur.  Between visiting Shaun's family for early Christmas, going home for a friends' holiday party and seeing other long-moved-away friends, visiting Kansas City for Christmas weekend, Shaun's and my 2 year anniversary, and hosting a 3-day long New Years' party, December went by fast.  And now I'm sitting here, on the other side of all that, feeling exhausted and a little bit empty.  I guess I got used to constantly planning for or getting ready for something and now that I don't have that pressure (or anything special to look forward to in the near future) I don't know what to feel anymore.  I'm sure I'll be grateful to have life back to normal in a few days, but for now I am kind of wishing I still had something coming up to work on.

And while somewhat blurry, the end of 2011 was definitely a success.  I really enjoyed spending time with Shaun's family and getting to know their Christmas traditions.  His mother gave me some very lovely gifts, mostly houseware things (including a fancy cupcake carrier!) and I'm glad to have them.  My family Christmas was also excellent.  I loved having Shaun there with me, and it was interesting to finally be there as my own ""family unit,"" separate from my parents for the first time.  I'm going to have a hard time next year missing my family Christmas (we're going to Shaun's family next year) but I am excited to start a new tradition - for the first time in years, my family will come together for Thanksgiving!  My aunt and uncle already spend every other Thanksgiving with my Great Aunt in Ohio, so next year Shaun and I will join them and hopefully my parents will too.  It won't replace Christmas, but it will be good to get my family time in.

New Years was pretty nuts.  We had about 15 people, mostly Shaun's college friends, join us for the long weekend.  It was 3 days full of good music, food, and games.  I didn't get as much gaming in as I wanted - just one game of Ticket to Ride (which I loved and think Shaun and I now need to get), some Halo with Jack, and a few hours of D2 LAN.  But hosting is pretty much a full-time job.  By the end of the first full day, I was told I was so tired it looked like I had a pair of black eyes.  But it was definitely worth it.  I miss my friends a lot, and I don't see them nearly as much as I would like.  My resolution for 2012 should be to stay in better contact with friends and family.  It's way too easy to let time just get away.

Between all of the other craziness, Shaun and I decided to keep our anniversary plans simple.  Shaun planned a recreation of our first date, which was very sweet.  For our first date, we had stir fry at Flat Top and then went to see the first Sherlock Holmes movie.  Two years later, he made me a candlelit homemade stir fry dinner, served chocolate wine cake for dessert, and then took me to see the new Sherlock Holmes movie.  It was a very nice, quiet evening in the midst of lots of holiday chaos - just what I needed."

"event","During my holiday visit to my Aunt's house, I was able to get another thing checked off the Wedding List - I was finally able to pick up a few mementos from my Grandparents wedding in September 1952.  My Aunt has had my grandmother's dress, veil, garter and wedding album in storage since my grandparents died about 15 years ago (Side note: Wow I can't believe it's been that long).  Though Shaun and I aren't exactly being traditional, I feel blessed to have access to these things in preparation for my own wedding.  I will probably wear her garter as my something old, and I'm planning a little display of family wedding albums for the reception.  I already have my parents and my Dad's parents albums.  I still need to ask my other Grandma for hers and I've already talked to Shaun's mom about getting albums from her and Shaun's grandparents.

Anyway, we didn't have time to look at the dress while at my Aunt's house but when we got home, Shaun and I took it out of the box to look at it.  It's in very good shape (the material looks almost new excepting a couple small stains on the back of the skirt) considering it will be 60 years old this year.  Even more surprising was the fact that it looked like I just might be able to fit into it (I never thought that would be possible given how tiny women were in the 50's.).  But my Grandmother was on the taller side, so her dress was a little bit bigger than average.  I did manage to get it on, though the sleeves were tight and only about half of the buttons in the back could be done.  So I guess that tells you something - my Grandmother and I might have the same chest and hip measurement but her waist was WAY smaller than mine!

The dress also has a ridiculous Cathedral train.  That actually bodes well for me if I wanted to have the dress altered to fit- the train could be cut off and used to make a back or side panels.  Part of me is tempted by the idea but the dress isn't really my style, though quite classic, and it doesn't really go with our plan for the wedding.  So instead I think I will wear her garter and maybe use a bit of the dress fabric (the scraps from my grandmother's own fittings were in the box as well) for a bouquet wrap.

<lj-cut text=""Pictures!""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/lilbellule/pic/000d411b/s640x480"">
You totally can't tell that half the buttons aren't done!  You can, however, tell that I didn't inherit her height.

I don't usually get sick with flu-like symptoms so it was a surprise to me when all of a sudden at work yesterday I felt like I was going to throw up.  Abdominal pain, nausea, the whole 9 yards.  Blech.  I toughed it out for a couple hours, hoping it would go away, but finally caved and asked if I could leave early.  I'll spare you the details of my evening, but suffice it to say, it wasn't very much fun.  Luckily my stomach feels much better today, I'm just exhausted, probably from being totally dehydrated yesterday.

Unfortunately I'm going to have to drag myself off the couch and get dressed this afternoon because we have the Critter Control people coming to look at our attic/roof.  Long story short (I've been meaning to write about it, I swear!): We thought we had a roof leak but it turns out that something has taken up residence in our attic.  Better than a roof leak, but still an annoying problem.  So today we're having someone come out to better assess the situation for us.  It costs money just for them to come out so I really hope they can do something for us."

I got things for my parents and brother from Amazon, little gifts for my Aunt, Uncle, their dog and my Great Aunt plus a general charity donation for my family from <a href=""http://www.theanimalrescuesite.com/clickToGive/home.faces?siteId=3"">The Animal Rescue Site</a>, the ingredients for my Bacon-Everything Zombie Apocalypse Survival Kit (my idea for the Nerd Christmas white elephant exchange) from ThinkGeek, and Shaun's gift from an unspecified location (I know you read my blog!).  I even got our Christmas cards ordered so we can pick them up tomorrow!  This year for the charity donation Shaun and I decided to go with Pets for Vets, which is an organization that matches shelter animals with U.S. veterans who are in need of a companion.  My family all likes animals quite a bit so I hope they will appreciate that.

The only shopping I have left is for our Angel Tree kid for this year.  I had been meaning to pick one out for quite some time but kept forgetting and thought I had missed my chance.  But last night I decided to see if there were any left and I'm glad I did - out of the few that were still available was an 8 year old boy whose top wish list item was Star Wars Lego sets!!  I'm really looking forward to picking out a couple for him.  I suppose I'll be practical and get him clothes too, but nobody says the t-shirts can't have Darth Vader on them!

Sunday we are having early Christmas with Shaun's parents and brother.  His mom wants it to be just like their regular Christmas, so we are having Cinnabon brunch (yum!) with presents in the morning, family games in the afternoon, and finishing up with a nice dinner.  Usually I think they have a turkey or ham or something, but for the sake of ease, we are going out to a nice restaurant instead.  Hopefully it will be a nice time spent with his family.  We've got a couple things still to do for it, namely make fudge and candied orange peels for his Mom.  It's been years since I've attempted orange peels, so hopefully I can make them turn out okay!"

"event","Well we successfully had our pictures taken today.  No idea how they turned out, but Shuva seemed to be happy with them, so I'm hoping I will be.  She said she took something like 250, so the law of averages (Or is that the law of large numbers?  Whatever.) says that there should be at least one or two good ones. ;-)

As I suspected, there was much giggling and silliness going on.  We started off doing a short session in my parents' kitchen, frosting some cupcakes.  Baking is something that we really like to do together and we figured it would make for some fun pictures since the weather outside was...interesting.  I bought a <a href=""http://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/product.asp?SKU=17372564"">totally adorable apron</a> for the pictures and now I'm wishing I had more occasion to actually use an apron.  I suppose I should just wear it whenever I bake now!

We did go outside for a more traditional engagement session after the baking.  It was pretty windy, but it didn't rain, so I guess that's okay.  My hair was definitely a rats' nest by the time we got back to the house.  Luckily I was wearing a sweater dress so it wasn't very blowy.  That would have been pretty awkward!  She asked us some fun questions, so it was a pretty good-natured session, except when Shaun and I argued about which one of us would be more likely to star in a Disney movie (neither of us wanted to, haha!).  And I was insulted when Shaun actually had to think about which one of us was the better driver - me of course!  Though he later defended himself by saying that he had been equating ""better"" with ""faster""...not sure what I think about that!  

Anyway, I'm really anxious to see the images and Shuva said that we might possibly get to see them by Thanksgiving, which would be awesome but definitely by Christmas.  So I guess that means our families are all getting pictures of us as gifts, woohoo."

Why?  Shaun and I are taking our engagement photos tomorrow!  I'm excited to spend this time with Shaun, but a little nervous about being in front of a camera, doing the ""right"" things, etc.  I am a little reassured because Shuva doesn't pose people and Shaun and I are awkward when we try to do things like that.  Instead, she gives you a cue and lets you do it however feels natural.  So if she says, ""Hug each other,"" we just do it how we would, rather than having her tell us where to put our arms.  Shaun gets kind of giggly when he's uncomfortable or nervous though, so I'm a little afraid our session will just degenerate into a lot of silliness.  Not that silliness is bad - I like silliness (and we are by nature pretty silly with one another so it will definitely be in some photos), but I hope we can get a little more substance in there as well.

I'm also a little nervous about the weather.  It's going to be cloudy-ish, which is apparently better for photography, but there is also a decent chance of rain.  And the interesting part is that it is supposed to be very windy.  Light rain we could handle, but lots of wind will not be fun.  So we'll see how it goes.  I will report back!"

I was a little embarrassed to be seen shopping in the Christmas section at Target (one of my absolute hugest pet peeves is when retailers put out Christmas crap before Halloween), but in my defense it's because we have a new house to decorate this year and no decorations at all.  Shaun has a small tree that he had in his apartment (just a tree, no ornaments) and that's it.  My Aunt was kind enough to let us have my late Grandparents' gorgeous 7 foot tree, but we had absolutely nothing to put on it.  Hobby Lobby was having a pre-season 50% off sale and I figured it would be better to get what I wanted from there and Target early rather than waiting for Stupid Crazy Shopping Weekend.  This way we can be at home decorating while everyone else is out running over each other with shopping carts.

Anyway, so I picked out the glass balls that I wanted and was mulling over ornament hooks.  I picked up a package of those pretty decorative ones - $4 for 24 hooks.  I needed 100+, so I got 5 packages.  I then realized just how ludicrous it was that I was seriously considering spending $20 on what basically amounts to fancy shaped paper clips.  So I promptly put them all back to get the package of 200 plain old ugly ones for $1, and donated the rest of that money that I almost spent on them to the holiday food drive at the grocery store.  Even if my ornament hooks are ugly, I think that was the better choice."

We also had a fairly big group of trick or treaters stop and watch us for a bit.

1) I got the job!  The ""interview"" was more of a ""Here's what we want you to do, sound good?"" meeting.  I'll be doing a lot of random tasks in Technical Services including processing new A/V materials, some copy cataloging, re-organization projects, teaching computer classes for seniors, and being one of a couple staff experts on the library's brand new downloadable audiobook and ebook services.  It's exactly the number of hours a week I wanted, with the potential to move internally when something more suited to my experience and education comes around.  I'll start in a couple of weeks and I'm so excited!

2)I joined a health club!  I've sorely missed the gym since I quit the Y right before moving.  My home workouts just aren't cutting it and now that I've finally had some success with modifying my diet, I really want to get back on the regular exercise wagon.  I went for a fancy private club this time, even though it costs more than the Y or the quick fitness places.  Mostly because it's a really gorgeous facility with a lot of amenities that I am super excited about using - lots of group ex classes, two pools, huge weight room (one of these days!), and SIX of my very favorite AMT machines in the cardio area.  And when Shaun and I get married next year, I'll be eligible for the corporate member discount (Yay State Farm!) so it will be comparable to the other gyms in the area.  I'm actually heading over there for my first workout in a little bit!

Also, today is Halloween!  I bought some green halogen bulbs to put in our front room light fixtures so all our windows will glow green, to go with our radioactive spider lights hanging from the front porch.  And I'll put up some of that fake spider webby stuff on our porch railings too.  After I get back from the gym, I'll be prepping our two pumpkins for Shaun and me to carve before Trick or Treating starts.  We're cutting it close this year on the pumpkins, but I really haven't had time the last week or so because I was so busy finishing our costumes. I think they turned out really great.  We'll take a few pictures tonight and I'll post them!  And of course, the annual watching of It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown will be tonight. :)"

"event","I finally got up the nerve to call the library back.  And, best case scenario happened:  they might have a job for me!

Apparently they are in the market for an assistant cataloger.  I took a cataloging class in school and really enjoyed it so cataloging and technical services work is something I have been interested in possibly pursuing, but all of my work history is in public service positions so those are the kind of jobs I'm more likely to get.  So this is really exciting!  It's part time, which is actually what I want right now.  And I'm really hoping that part-time tech services means M-F day shift.  It'd be super awesome to not get stuck with nights or weekends which is what I was assuming a part time circulation or reference job would entail.  But I'll find out more details later I guess.

I've got a meeting to go in and talk to the adult services manager and the library's cataloger on Friday.  So excited!"

"event","It's been a weird day.

To start with, I've only had 3 hours of sleep in the last 39 hours.  That is a first for me ever (I was a weenie and never did all-nighters in college or grad school).  To make a long story short, Shaun and I were staying at his parents' house last night and I had kind of an asthma attack in the middle of the night.  I lay awake for an hour, unable to sleep because I could barely breathe and finally woke Shaun up to tell him we had to do something about it.  We finally ended up calling his brother (who conveniently now works 3rd shift and was awake at 2:30 am) and went over there for the rest of the night.  Shaun went right to sleep when we got there but it took about 2 hours for the wheezing to subside so I got about an hour of sleep from 4:30-5:30 when it was time to get up for breakfast with his brother (well, it was more like dinner for his brother, but breakfast for us).

I have no idea why his parents' house affects me like that.  Yes, they have a dog, but my dog allergy symptoms do not usually include asthma.  They include sneezing eleventy billion times, disgusting runny nose and itchy eyes (fun, huh?).  The only  other place that triggers the asthma for me is my grandma's house.  But my grandma's house is filled with 50 years' worth of dust and dog hair so I figured that that was what caused the wheezing.  Shaun's mom, on the other hand, is ridiculously tidy.   I think she vacuums and dusts the house about 5 times before we visit.  So I suspect it is something other than the dog, but I have no idea what.  

But anyway, so it wasn't a very fun night.  But oddly enough, I haven't been that tired.  I kind of forced myself to take a 2 hour nap this afternoon, but other than that, I've been awake.  Awake and pretty active.  I can tell that my brain is fatigued because I'm having a lot of trouble putting sentences together and spelling words right, but I'm not really sleepy.  Hopefully a good 9 or 10 hours tonight will fix me.

Yesterday (even though it still feels like today since I didn't really sleep in between) was good, but long.  We did a lot of shopping.  Got all my materials for our Halloween costumes - I am going to attempt to make us both Star Wars robes.  Jedi for me and Sith for Shaun (to go with our super awesome new lightsabers!).  So I've got 2 weeks before Halloween weekend, gotta get cracking tomorrow.  Let the sewing marathon begin!!

I also got a killer pair of new black boots that I am super excited about.  My old ones have had a broken heel since a week after I bought them (I was unable to return them and was so pissed about it that I just wore them around with the broken heel.  Wore the heck out of them too).  I want to wear them for our engagement photos, which are scheduled for the second weekend in November.  Now I just need to order <a href=""http://www.loft.com/loft/product/product%3A271775/LOFT-Color-Pop/Crepe-Ruffle-Trim-Sleeveless-Dress/271775?colorExplode=false&amp;skuId=10030738&amp;catid=catl000013&amp;productPageType=fullPriceProducts&amp;defaultColor=5762"">this dress</a> that I have my eye on and hope it looks good on me.   Then I'll just need some sort of jacket to wear over it.  Sleeveless in November is probably not a genius idea.

We also spent some time with Shaun's friends in the evening.  It was his high school best friend's fiancee's birthday.  So we had dinner at a make your own stir fry place and then went to an arcade.  The arcade was way fun.  I came out better than everyone else, but that was only because I started scouring the floor for lost treasure!  By the end of the night, I had found a total of $10.21 in cash, about 250 prize tickets, 2 game tokens, and a slinky.  So Shaun and I made back the $10 we spent on game tokens and then some, haha.  I should really just start wandering around arcades picking up money that people drop.  I could probably be rich! And have a very large collection of slinkys."

At least one of the babies is, I haven't seen the other two yet.  I'm afraid they might be living under our deck.  I wish I could bring them inside but I can't because A) they are probably feral (they seem terrified of me) B) I am very allergic.

Me - ""That movie was depressing.  Now I need to go cheer myself up...""
Shaun - ""Read some wedding blogs?""
Me - ""How did you know I was thinking that?!""
Shaun - ""Just a hunch.""

*sigh* What has become of me?!

Unrelated, Shaun and I finally decided that it's time to add to our family.  We're going to get an animal-type friend of some sort, probably avian!  We both really like lizards, but we both also have a very strong aversion to having to keep bugs in the house/garage to feed a lizard and the only vegetarian lizards, iguanas, are very hard work to keep and very temperamental.  We were thinking maybe in a few years, when our lives have settled down somewhat (and other people are busy having babies) that we'll get that iguana, but not now.  For now we're thinking a lovebird, because I've read they make fabulous cuddly pets if you socialize them enough, and since I'm at home so much, that won't be a problem! 

 I'm probably allergic to birds like I'm allergic to everything else, damn crazy histamines.  But lovebirds are a small species that doesn't produce much dander and we're going to run an air filter in the room where we keep it 24/7.  It's not 100% decided that we're going to do this, but I'm going kind of crazy being alone so much while Shaun is at work, so we both agree that I need some company.  (Real friends would be good too, but that's a slow process.)  We're going to go to some bird fair in Peoria next weekend to ask some questions, find breeders and test my allergies to see how I react to being in a huge room full of birds.  If I die, we probably will give up on the idea.  But I'm hoping that won't happen!"

"event","Well, we picked our caterer!

After getting some helpful advice from friends and thinking on it a bit more, we decided to go with Biaggi's.  We're both frugal people but we decided for several reasons that it would be worth spending the extra money (not tons extra, but still enough to count) for an occasion as important as our wedding.

We had our second meeting with the catering manager to get all the info for her to put together a contract for us.  I still don't like her that much, but she's growing on me a bit.  I decided that the elements of her personality that I don't care for probably contribute to her reputation for being an excellent catering manager (I guess I just don't like aggressive type-As that much).  And Shaun seems to get along with her just fine, so I told her that Shaun is going to be the primary contact.

So even though I still feel kind of awkward around her, the meeting was very good.  We gave her a firm budget that has to include everything including taxes, service charges, gratuities, etc. and we were very excited about what she had to show us.  The menu looks great, and we're getting a lot of stuff that I didn't really think we'd be able to get.  She is also handling all of the food-related venue setup for us - the buffet tables, cake table, and guest dining tables.  They're even going to do the setup of the cupcakes for us with a nice tiered stand thing that they have <i>and</i> going to provide someone to scoop ice cream for us (Yay Whitey's!!!).   The last part that I'm excited about is that she is handling all the necessary rentals for us including tableware, coffee urn, and napkins.  Anything that lessens the amount of work I have to do day of sounds great to me (and probably to the friends I most likely would have roped into helping!).  So all in all, I'm quite pleased.

The big things that still need to be done are: find an officiant (we have some possibilities in mind but haven't made inquiries yet), cake (tastings are seriously the best part of wedding planning), and invitations.  I've got a design in mind for the invitations (it's drawn out in crayon in my sketchbook lol), but need to start playing around with Photoshop to see if I can make it happen digitally.  I also need to talk to our photographer about when we can schedule the engagement shoot as well.  And I need to get Shaun to start working on the website!"

"event","This week I got to try out an exciting new career - booth babe!  Not really, but it was fun to call myself one anyway.  The story is that Shaun's employer is having an IT Symposium this week and different teams set up tables to promote their tools and projects to other employees.  Shaun had mentioned to his mangager before that I like doing creative stuff, so his manager asked if I might like to design their booth.  The tagline for their project is ""Search, Ask & Share"" and somebody came up with the idea of changing it to ""Search, Ask & Scare"" so they wanted to go with a Halloween theme.

So they gave me a budget and  I got to go buy decorations!  I set up a haunted table with Jack O'Lantern, cauldron full of candy,  wine glasses with fake blood/wine, candles (not lit, unfortunately), moldy fruit bowl, and lots of webs and spiders.  I got a bunch of the stuff really cheap at Goodwill and then painted it to make it more  Halloweeny.  We got fabric to drape the table and pin to the wall behind, and I also let them use one of my creepy Halloween lenticular portraits (picture changes based on the angle you look at it from) that I am so very fond of.  And one of Shaun's team members even brought us a strobe light and light pattern projector!   The table turned out really great and we've gotten zillions of compliments.  Most of the other tables are just kind of boring (two computer monitors and a poster hung up behind), so ours stands out like a pink-striped zebra dancing in a tutu.

This is the super creepy lenticular portrait I bought this year.  These things are creepy and bizarre and yet, I love them. 


The blood/wine on the glasses is actually homemade hard candy.  We got the idea from <a href=""http://www.hostessblog.com/2008/10/halloween-martini-vampire-style/"">this site</a>.  It was pretty easy to do, and makes a really great effect.  I definitely would do it again for a future Halloween party.  It's kind of funny to see people poke it with their fingers or even put their whole hand down on it, get sticky and then look at us with a sheepish smile like they couldn't help but touch it.

The booth design is a little outlandish, but it's really been working to get people to come up and ask about the projects we're featuring.  I haven't been keeping a formal count, but we definitely got a lot more walkups than the booths next to us.  (The free candy probably helps too!)</lj-cut>

Initially I was just designing the table, then I got asked to come in and set it up, and then they asked if I could come in costume and stay all day for both days (Lol I can't get over the fact that I am a booth babe now!).  So Wednesday I wore a gothic vampiress sort of outfit - reused my Nefertiti dress from Halloween two years ago and changed the accessories and wore pretty intense makeup (apparently so intense that someone who saw me on Wednesday didn't recognize me Thursday!).  Thursday I was rocking my pirate outfit.  Not particularly scary, but it is attention-grabbing.  Shaun was even more attention-grabby than me, since he decided to wear his fairy wings!  So tons of people gave him grief about it, which is funny.

It's been fun to go to work with Shaun the last couple of days, plus I love Halloween so any excuse to do more decorating is fine by me!  And I love getting to wear some of my costumes that I've done a lot of work on.  I especially love wearing costumes unexpected places, though it takes me a bit at the beginning to get used to the attention since I'm usually a blend-in sort of person.  Shaun's workplace is a particularly good place for that because people are usually pretty straight laced, so seeing a pirate and a fairy walk down the hall gets quite a range of reactions, from outright amusement to barely concealed amusement to confusion.

And today I get to wear yet another costume as Shaun and I are going to the roller derby and they are having a Hogwarts House Cup themed bout, which is super awesome.  So I get to bust out my Hufflepuff uniform!  Hufflepuff for the Cup!

So that's three costumes in one week and it's not even October yet!  Not sure what I'm doing costume-wise for Halloween yet.  Depends whether or not we're having a party.  For trick or treating (sooo excited for trick or treating this year - we live in a pretty good family neighborhood so I'm hoping we'll get lots of kids), I'll probably re-wear the gothic vampiress outfit since we're decorating our house scary-like, but if we have/go to a party, I'll wear something else I think.  I have a costume in mind, but I need a few more accessories."

"event","Well the wedding was quite fun.  Shaun's cousin was absolutely gorgeous and I'm sure some of their pictures will look like they walked right out of a wedding dress magazine.  The reception was held in the upper floor of a train station that has been converted into a ballroom.  It was a very pretty space on its own and needed only minimal decoration to look really nice.  The only bad thing was that the huge, domed ceiling reflected the sound right back down so I could never hear anything that the MC was saying when he introduced dances or songs.  It just sounded like a football stadium on game day.  

And it was nice to spend some time with his family.  We got a lot of congratulations from people, as well as some good natured ribbing about the secrecy of our wedding.  Apparently Shaun's Mom has been talking our wedding up as being really different so it's created a bit of a buzz.  I'm not sure that's a good thing, but so far people are excited.  We'll see what happens when they learn what the theme actually is!  Shaun and I had fun imagining various reactions when they get our Save the Dates and we were wishing that we could put a spy cam in them to catch people's facial expressions.

We also had a fun time dancing together and I am really excited because I think I <i>finally</i> convinced Shaun that taking a couple of dance classes could be really fun.  He likes to dance but has had no formal instruction ever, so he's pretty good at just doing his own thing but not very good at couples dancing.  But he's always admired couples who can dance together gracefully and he actually asked me to teach him what I could remember from the few swing lessons I went to in college (which is the basic step and two turns).  So I told him that if we just took a few lessons, it would help a lot and he finally agreed!

The sad thing is that there are only a couple of places to take dance lessons in Bloomington and they all started their fall sessions <b>last</b> week.  That's a bummer, but I guess I'll start looking for the next sessions and sign up early.  I have two main options and I'm not sure which to do.  Option 1 is a 10 week course at a private dance studio that covers intro to a lot of different styles: Swing, Waltz, Foxtrot, Rumba, Cha Cha and Polka (I'm trying really hard not to giggle at the idea of us learning to Polka!).  Option 2 is a 4 session course taught by an independent instructor through the city parks and recreation department.  They introduce Swing, Waltz and Nightclub 2-Step.

I like option 1 because it is such a long program with lots more instruction, but I like the dances in option 2 better.  I don't think Shaun and I really need to learn 6 styles and we looked up Nightclub 2-Step, which neither of us had ever heard of, and it looks really cool.  The other thing we both want to learn is Swing.  So I think maybe the second option works better, though we'll have to wait until January for the next session!  Boo."

"event","Going to Shaun's cousin's wedding this afternoon.  I'm kind of excited, which is weird.  I've never really been ""excited"" to go to a wedding unless it was for someone close to me and I was just really happy to see them so happy.  But this time I'm excited to see how it has been planned and all the little details and stuff.  I guess it's because now that I am planning a wedding of my own, I appreciate all the work that some people put into theirs a lot more now.  

I guess before I never really realized that absolutely every element, from the salt and pepper shakers to the basket that holds the ceremony programs is usually painstakingly chosen to reflect a certain look or mood.  I must admit, I still don't quite understand that level of detail-orientation (I don't care what my salt & pepper shakers look like, or my napkins, or my ceremony program basket, or even the flatware as long as it's clean and has all the necessary pieces) but now that I know that a lot of brides (and grooms) put so much care into their weddings, I appreciate it a little more.  Plus Shaun tells me that this wedding is likely to be extremely detail-oriented, so there'll be a lot to look at.

Though I am a bit nervous for my first ""public family event"" with Shaun's extended family, especially with us relatively newly engaged and next up to get married.  We made the decision to not tell anybody the details we have planned other than date and location, because the more people know early, the longer they have to sit and come up with reasons why we shouldn't do it.  His family is traditional and our wedding will be different, and I don't really want anybody telling me that I should do it another way.  So we decided it's best to just spring things on people - we'd rather listen to them complain about not knowing than nitpick with us about things we've already decided."

"event","I watched a couple episodes of Hoarders yesterday while I was stuck on the couch feeling sick.  This was probably a bad decision because the show just ended up making me uncomfortable (the food hoarders are the worst, ugh).  I think because clutter freaks me out to a certain degree and I just can't imagine ever living like they do.  I'm definitely not a hoarder, though I do tend to save silly things for no reason sometimes (usually small cute things that I can put on my desk - my desk has the problem, not me I swear!), but I balance that by going on binges where I throw/give away lots of stuff.  And as an adult I've gotten really good at saying no to the clutter before it even gets in my possession.  So on the whole, I am quite tidy and maintain (what I think at least) is a happy medium of stuff.

I probably learned that from my mother, who is on a crazy mission to get rid of absolutely all of the ""stuff"" in her life.  Sure it's annoying to discover that I have to replace something else (ahem, my cool Halloween pumpkin cough cough) because she gave it away, but this show made me realize that it sure beats the other end of the spectrum! 

Note to self: Now that you have a house, move all of your holiday decor ASAP, lest more of it mysteriously wind up at Goodwill."

"event","so i went to see bright eyes and the faint last night, here's my story.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v19/addisonsbaby/sign.jpg"">
<lj-cut text=""i could love the world a lot harder if i was in tune"">

it all began with a drive to atlanta with sierra, cameron, and sierra's dad as our chauffer.  Halfway there, i jokingly asked sierra if she had our tickets and her mouth dropped.  She had never printed them out..!  So we drove to her aunt's house in little five points to print them from her email.
(end conundrum number one).

Our friends Caroline and Jessica had gotten at the venue at 5, so we jumped in line with them.  this allowed for us to be very close to the front.  So when we went in, i headed straight for the front of the stage, where i saved myself a spot in 1st/2nd row depending on who was pushing me later.  Surprisingly, no one in my group wanted to stand up with me and they all went and sat down in the seats in the back.  But I toughed it out and stood up for 6 hours during the show.  There were a lot of people smoking and i almost died. (end conundrum 2).

The opening act was a rapper that had his bass up too loud.  I felt like my eardrum was going to pop and that my ear was bleeding.  I was very glad when he finished his set. (end conundrum number 3.)

But then the Faint came on.  I like the Faint but I have never been a ridiculously huge fan, but their live show was great.  The lights made it awesome.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v19/addisonsbaby/faint.jpg"">
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v19/addisonsbaby/faint2.jpg"">
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v19/addisonsbaby/faint3.jpg"">
The guitarist was hott..
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v19/addisonsbaby/faintguitarist.jpg"">
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v19/addisonsbaby/faintguitarist2.jpg"">
...And they even had a violinist!
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v19/addisonsbaby/faintviolin.jpg"">


But then Bright Eyes came on.  I must say I'm quite a fan, but i became a huge obnoxious fan x25894354895 when conor finally started playing.  i guess seeing things live just kind of brings the music closer to you or something.  It also helped that I was uber close to the stage.  Conor is a lovely keyboardist...
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v19/addisonsbaby/conor19.jpg"">

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v19/addisonsbaby/conor5.jpg"">
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v19/addisonsbaby/conor1.jpg"">
...but he also rocks at guitar as well.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v19/addisonsbaby/conor2.jpg"">
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v19/addisonsbaby/conor8.jpg"">
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v19/addisonsbaby/conor15.jpg"">
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v19/addisonsbaby/conor12.jpg"">
But he does well without an instrument.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v19/addisonsbaby/conor13.jpg"">
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v19/addisonsbaby/conor17.jpg""> (what an alcoholic.)

The best part of it though was how conor jumped on top of everything.  i failed to get a picture of him standing on top of his keyboard, but i did catch him dancing on the bass drum.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v19/addisonsbaby/conordrumset.jpg"">

Another super surprise was how Nick, the guitarist for the yeah yeah yeahs, played guitar for conor during the tour. mmmm.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v19/addisonsbaby/nick2.jpg"">

aaaaand i managed to walk home with a setlist from the stage.  Good souvenir.  Yes sir.

on a happier note, i am almost 5/6 of the way through <i>Jane Eyre</i> for ap lit.  it is the longest novel we have to read this summer so hopefully i can get all the lit readings out of the way quickly.

<lj-cut text=""i like your sleeves.  they're real big."">
well the day got off to a somewhat slow start.  getting ready and things while my mother took pictures.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v19/addisonsbaby/sarahtwo.jpg"">

ben arrived at my house soon after however, and we began to work on making our fake flower corsage/boutonneires.  they were lovely by the way.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v19/addisonsbaby/hotglue.jpg"">

naturally the mother had to take that priceless outdoor picture of the couple dressed in prom attire...though she wasn't too thrilled about our foot gear.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v19/addisonsbaby/chucks.jpg"">

then we were off to mcdonalds!
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v19/addisonsbaby/goldenarches.jpg"">

ben was thrilled to meet mister ronald mcdonald himself.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v19/addisonsbaby/benronald.jpg"">

after enjoying a nice mcchicken sandwich, we headed over to abbis for a nice cup of coffee and a relaxing game of scrabble.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v19/addisonsbaby/scrabblecoffee.jpg"">

mmm, vanilla lattes.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v19/addisonsbaby/sarahcoffee.jpg"">

after i beat him at scrabble, we had fun with letters.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v19/addisonsbaby/scrabble.jpg"">
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v19/addisonsbaby/benscrabble.jpg"">

however it was getting kind of late and we had to meet our friends alex and emily at serendipity.  so off we went with the sunset behind us.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v19/addisonsbaby/sunset3.jpg"">

once we arrived at serendipity, alex and ben had to stake out the place to make sure it was safe.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v19/addisonsbaby/serendipity.jpg"">

naturally it was so we enjoyed our milkshakes and took our group footwear photo.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v19/addisonsbaby/chucks2.jpg"">

""it's getting late!"" the men stated.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v19/addisonsbaby/benalex.jpg"">

prom had just begun downtown so we followed alex and emily to sacred heart.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v19/addisonsbaby/alexemily.jpg"">

it was a beautiful view on the ride there.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v19/addisonsbaby/sunset2.jpg"">
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v19/addisonsbaby/sunset.jpg"">

once we arrived at sacred heart, i met up with my girls outside and the men discussed men things.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v19/addisonsbaby/themen.jpg"">

but it was getting boring so we headed inside for our prom.  and boy was there a party inside.  people were getting crunk right and left.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v19/addisonsbaby/neil.jpg"">
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v19/addisonsbaby/sierra.jpg"">
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v19/addisonsbaby/thegirls.jpg"">

but one can only do so much dancing so a few hours later, the posse headed over to d.timms for some late night entertainment.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v19/addisonsbaby/dtimmsband.jpg"">

we were so enthused by the king of swing and rick james himself.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v19/addisonsbaby/dtimmshomies.jpg"">

then we got kind of hungry and decided to eat some cake.
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v19/addisonsbaby/cakeplate.jpg"">

with full bellies and $11.77 less money in our wallets, we all parted ways.  amy and jessica went home while alex and emily went somewhere and me and ben went off in the opposite direction.  

no pictures of what happened then.

but it was an eventful evening from singing ""time after time"" with the jazz band at d.timms to eating chocolate covered strawberries at prom to reading all the reasons why you should say NO to sex while holding up a condom.

and everything in between.

so the removing of my wisdom/biscuspid teeth went well i guess, i'm not dead..but the process of healing hasn't been much fun.  i have bruises on my cheeks and it looks like i walked by someone with a highlighter in their hands and got a faceful of it.  well not really.  but kind of.

i still can't really eat solid foods well, i'm at the process where i can smoosh things up with my tongue and roof of my mouth and swallow though.  :)   and i lost 10 pounds in 4 days.  i would be shocked to realize this until i factor in water weight and all that junk.  

schools a bitch

i want a chick fila salad so bad

and i dont have a prom date.

i'm painting this random picture in art class right now while other people finish up their collages and im going to call it ""i could have given you light"".  i don't know why.  it just came to my head. and i like it.

then saturday me, frankie and eric went to center stage and serendipity and me and eric beat frank really bad at chess, he deserved it though (black power!) and yeah.  then we went and packed up equipment and unloaded it all at molly's party because they were the entertainment for the evening.  the music was grand and i took a lot of pictures. then we went back to erics house with molly's leftover birthday cake and had an afterparty and watched saturday night live.

then i went home and talked online like i always do and went to bed, yay

and now sunday is dedicated to homework, ive already done all of it except for my stupid lit essay, sigh.

hope everyone is doing swell.

"event","yeah so the state audition for ghp was today in atlanta...i got all dressed up in my business suit and matching accessories and uncomfortable shoes and did my interview.

i was really rambly though because the interviewers came up to me a little bit earlier than expected, so they caught me off guard.  ever since i shook their hands i was like iorjbg;sohtijtosniuj and i just kept talking, i'm not sure if it made sense or not.  i hope i didn't sound like an idiot.  and i messed with my hair a lot more than i probably should have.

i think they liked my stuff but i dont know if they think im GHP material or not, like the more i think about it the more i don't think i got in.  just because i forgot to say so much stuff i was going to say, like the interview went by so fast and it all just went over my head and i completely forgot all my main points until like 3 hours later.

but then i took the test which was uber easy so that was good, then i went and did some Atlanta shopping with my dad to get my mind off it. which was nice.

they're only taking 45 people out of 200, why must i have to wait till april to see who got in??

it's really neat though, having short straight hair that doesn't frizz much and it not being all curly and stupid.  and erin razor cutted it too so it's got neat edge :)

yeah i don't have any pictures.  i don't really know how i'm going to fix it in the morning, i'm no good with hair.  hopefully it works out.

"event","I've been laying in bed for the last hour unable to fall back asleep.  I hate it.  And I've been singing that damn Alanis Morisette song ""You Oughta Know"" in my head the whole time.

I hate how life is a struggle.  Once you get past one thing, you get faced with another.  It never ends.  Sometimes it's too hard to make the good times outweigh the bad.

January 3rd, 2005--I've got to start a new life without <i>you</i> and I'm really scared.  For the past two years I've been able to talk to <i>you</i> about anything and now I've got to pretend <i>you</i> don't even exist.  All for what?  I don't know.  I can already see it coming back to haunt me.  But at the same time, this has <b>got</b> to end.  This jealousy of something that has nothing to do with anything has got to end.  But is it really possible to get rid of something so prevalent in human nature?  I've got so many doubts.  And I think they outweigh the possible positive outcomes right now.  Yet I've never needed something so bad for me.  

I think I'm being dramatic.  But I also think that a friendship that has grown into an unconditional love gone out of control can't just be thrown away either.  I even begin to think that this is just one of those larger bumps in that unpaved road of life and there are more even larger than this up ahead.  But that doesn't change the fact that this bump is large to begin with.

I know most won't read this entire entry.  It won't make sense to them.  But it makes sense to me.  Yet somehow I feel like the most confused person on the face of the earth.  

<i>So please back away and let me go
I can't my darling, I love you so...</i>

i left on friday to come to my dad's house then saturday we drove to florida to visit the family.  my grandma is really sick.  i don't really know how much longer she has left and i can tell she is really wearing out my grandpa.  i didn't really know how to act so i just sat there quiet most of the trip.

we got back yesterday and i am still at my dad's house...whenever i come here i always feel so antisocial and lonely.  i hate it.  i wish he lived closer to augusta so i could still hang out with people i love...yet i hate saying that because this is supposed to be a time when i hang out with my dad.

but this is the time in my life where i don't want to hang out with my parents.

"event","<b>Who:</b> Light and Ginny
<b>What:</b> Light finally agrees to have sex with Ginny, and later proposes to her.
<b>Where:</b> Light's flat
<b>When:</b> July 1st
<b>Why:</b> Light's still feeling the aftereffects of having spent time in Delirium's Realm and no longer has any reason <i>not</i> to sleep with her. And he wants an excuse to sing Elvis to her in bed.
<b>Rated:</b> PG-13. We started logging the smut part but ended up in a corner. So we backed up a bit and just went on to the next scene. We are teh suxx0rs. &hearts;



<lj-cut text=""Honestly, if Ginny needed him to say, 'yes, I finally want to sleep with you,' he would facepalm."">Ginny lay stretched out on the couch half on top of Light, kissing along the edge of his jaw. She was extremely glad he'd finally decided to let her actually touch him again -- she was a very physical person and she liked being able to <i>show</i> him that she loved him.

Light's breath caught and his eyes fluttered shut. Silently he begged for no more flashbacks. When anyone so much as touched him it would send acidic, spoiled images through his mind. His sensory perception would be temporarily warped. It seemed he had to concentrate hard to keep them at bay, even when he was trying to be intimate. No, especially when. Light let out a groan. It was Ginny, it was Ginny kissing him, so why wouldn't his mind stop telling him it was otherwise?

Ginny felt him tense and paused, pressing her nose into the side of his neck. ""What's the matter, love?"" she asked him softly.

His eyes snapped open. He swallowed, and glanced at her body sprawled across him. ""Just... just seeing and feeling things.""

""Oh."" So he hadn't recovered as much as she'd thought he had. ""I'm sorry, love."" She pressed her lips lightly against his neck. ""Can I help at all?""

After thinking for a good long while, Light sighed. Flashbacks or not, her lips felt sensual against his skin. A hand threaded through her hair and gave it a playful tug. ""Would you prefer the bed, or will the couch do?"" It was the same couch Light had bought with his sister after the old one had been ruined. His memories of that day with Envy, the second time he'd come over for sex, rang far too clear in his mind. 

She blinked at him for a moment, startled. Was he <i>really</i> saying...? A slow grin spread across her face. ""Anything you want, my love,"" she purred.

""Name it."" Light rubbed the back of her leg with a foot.

The grin faded to a gentle smile and she reached up to brush his bangs aside. ""All <i>I</i> want is you,"" she said softly.

""You need to be more specific,"" he stated with a hint of snark, eyes lidded.

Ginny gave him a slightly ironic look. ""You're going to make me say it, aren't you. I want you, Light... <i>all</i> of you."" She dropped her head to his chest, suddenly and inexplicably finding herself unable to look at him. ""...Am I ever going to be able to get you to sleep with me?"" she said finally, not able to think of a better way to put it without sounding ridiculous. ""I mean, if you don't <i>want</i> to, that's okay, I just want to know,"" she added, a bit more quietly.

Light was silent in thought for a moment. The way she'd worded it had disturbingly reminded him of the way Misa used to ask about the same topic. Eventually he murmured, ""Yes, you will.""
 
""...Oh."" She tucked her head up under his chin. ""...When--"" She cut herself off. ""Sorry,"" she whispered, feeling bad for asking. ""I shouldn't have said anything.""

Light huffed and let his gaze drift off somewhere. ""It's all right. But I just asked you, here or in the bedroom."" Honestly, if Ginny needed him to say, 'yes, I finally want to sleep with you,' he would facepalm.

""...Oh. Er. Bedroom?"" she said, feeling slightly ridiculous.

He gave a small chuckle at that. ""Then you'll have to peel yourself up off of me, no matter how comfortable you are right now."" He glanced at her and smiled, then nudged her with his foot again.

She smiled back and stretched catlike across his chest before sitting up and climbing off him, waiting.

He got up and took hold of her shoulders from behind, urging her forward as they both headed to his room.

She giggled at him and let him propel her, turning around inside the door of the bedroom to tilt her chin up and brush her lips across his. ""Mmm... love you,"" she murmured.

Light murmured back but whatever he said was unintelligible. With a foot he closed the door behind him. His arms went around her waist then, pulling her flush against him. Before Ginny could say another word, his lips pressed against hers in a fervent kiss.

She inhaled sharply and kissed him back hard, her hands fisting in his shirt as sudden heat rushed through her.

His hands slipped under the back of her t-shirt. As the kissing progressed, his hands rubbed along her back, slipping upward before using nails on the downward stroke.

She shivered and hummed contentedly against his lips, letting go of his shirt and sliding her own hands under it. She splayed her fingers out across his chest as she nipped lightly at his lower lip.

A small sound lodged itself in his throat as Light suppressed a reaction to her hands, and he slowly urged her backwards without breaking their heated kiss. When her knees hit the edge of the bed he stopped. His hands unhooked her bra.

She made a squeaking sound as she felt him undo the clasp of her bra, holding onto her balance only a moment before she tipped backwards onto the bed, pulling Light down with her. Smiling slightly, she let her lips drop to his neck.

Light quickly pulled himself into a position where he was straddling her waist. For a moment he was blinded as a piercing image flashed through his head - things he never wanted to remember and may have only semi-happened, if at all - but in the heat of the moment it didn't prove as difficult to ignore as it had for the others. As long as he could keep it straight that this was Ginny, then he'd be fine.







Later Ginny lay snuggled against Light's side, her head on his chest. She yawned widely, mostly asleep, enjoying the feel of his bare skin against hers.

Light allowed his fingers to brush softly against her shoulder. After a while he began to sing, in a hushed tone, the opening lines to one of his favorite Elvis songs. ""You know I can be found, Sitting home all alone, If you can't come around, At least please telephone. Don't be cruel to a heart that's true."" He was amused to see Ginny crack a small smile at that.

She opened one eye and looked up at him, her smile spreading. ""Are you singing?""

Instead of answering her question, Light simply continued with the lyrics, not missing a beat.

She giggled softly and tucked her head up under his chin, letting her eyes flutter shut again as she listened to him -- he really did have a nice voice, she thought idly.

As Light reached a certain stanza in the lyrics, the main reason he has chosen this song over others, he sang with a little more gusto. ""Let's walk up to the preacher And let us say I do, Then you'll know you'll have me, And I'll know that I'll have you."" He was looking at her now, as he sang, waiting for her reaction.

It took her a minute to process his words before she lifted her head and blinked at him. ""Wait. What?""

Light stopped singing and grinned. ""I could repeat that stanza for you if necessary.""

Ginny opened and closed her mouth a couple of times. ""Light..."" she finally whispered.

""I mean it.""

""Oh, my god."" She gave him a wavering smile. ""Really? <i>Really?</i>""

Light shut his eyes and with a sigh, hugged Ginny closer. His big grin remained, however. The pillow felt really comfy. ""Of course.""

She snuggled close to him, her mind racing. Her first impulse was to say yes, and any consequences be damned, but she made herself stop. ""I... I should think about it,"" she said after a moment. ""Not that I don't want to,"" she added quickly, lifting her head to look at him. ""I do, badly, I just... I should talk to my mum first... and... oh my god, Light...""

Light was quiet as he processed Ginny's response, not entirely expecting it. ""Oh my god what?"" he asked slowly.

""I'm just... surprised, is all,"" she said, smiling at him. ""Happy, but surprised.""

He frowned. ""It shouldn't be that surprising. I'd have asked long ago if it hadn't been for certain... <i>obstacles</i> in my way."" He was referring to the likes of Misa and Zuko. Finally in May he had a good opportunity to rid himself of her, and after that it was only a matter of time before Zuko was out of the picture, though the firebender regretfully remained alive.

She blinked hard several times and lifted a hand to his face, smoothing out the frown lines on his forehead. ""Don't look like that,"" she said softly.

His only reply was a childish pout.

She tilted her head down to kiss him softly, smiling against his lips.

""Your mother likes me,"" he said after the kiss. ""She'll say yes to you marrying me.""

""I'm sure she will,"" Ginny agreed, resting her forehead against his, still smiling at him. ""I just feel like I should talk to her first.""

""How long will you need?""

She shrugged. ""A couple of days.""

""Don't take too long,"" he replied, pouting again.

""I won't."" She smiled again, dropping her head to rest next to his on the pillow and pressing her lips against the corner of his jaw. ""I love you so much,"" she whispered.

""I know you do,"" he whispered back, shutting his eyes as he did.

She didn't respond, instead smiling against his neck and shifting to curl up against him.

Light hoped it would be a very short two days, and that the flashbacks, which had subsided finally, would remain under the radar."

"event","Sirius, I apologise, but seeing it take you <i>that</i> long to figure out it was <i>I</i> who will be marrying Ginny next month proved far too amusing for me to interfere with corrections. Matter of circumstance only. I'm certain Ginny will agree. We were both laughing and grinning through it all.

Ah. Speaking of our engagement, Ginny dragged me to The Burrow again yesterday to meet more of the Weasleys. Previously I only knew her mother and the twins. Her father was especially intrigued by my er... how should I put it... It's not often a Muggle develops magic powers only once in his early twenties. But he did like the wand Ginny and I had picked out for me together. And of course, all of us guys had a right old fun game of Quidditch. 

My first ever.

Wouldn't you know it was also the first time I ever rode a broom. Usually I've taken to Apparition.

I won't claim to have picked things up like an impossible genius, but considering how adept at spellwork I've become since I became aware of my powers, even I should be allowed to gloat to an extent. 

Ginny and I returned quite late last night, and were both so tired that we went to bed immediately. Thus, here is my championship entry slightly late, but still there. Looks like I've nothing to worry about. Kaidoh-san has yet to  post his. ^_^

Consider this a double whammer.

First, <a href=""http://googlefight.com/index.php?lang=en_GB&word1=Kaoru+Kaidoh&word2=Light+Yagami"">GoogleFight</a>. :D

Second, a fic of a drabble nature:




<lj-cut text=""Light vs. Kaidoh, how else? Tennis!"">Light had been looking forward to his rematch with Kaidoh. It had been months since the last time they played each other, when Light had been in shape enough to keep up with the teen's unimaginable stamina and win by a hair. Such a close game could have gone either way. Light was now standing by the courts, waiting for his opponent to show up. As he glanced around, though, he noted absolutely no sign of him. 

That may have been due to the droves of fangirls clogging the other side of the fence. (Thank goodness for the fence, he thought with a shudder.) Even so, Light was patient. He began tapping his racket against his leg and drank from a water bottle. It was very hot and humid out. 

Somewhere miles away, Kaidoh was jogging when he came across a lost kitten in the middle of a park. It was mewling in such a somber tone that he stopped and bent to pet it. There was a sad look in its eyes. Kaidoh thought to himself, maybe it was hungry? A tennis match could wait.

Two hours later Light was still at the courts, pinching the bridge of his nose. The fangirls were still there, the heat had become unbearable, and there had yet to be any sign of Kaidoh. The umpire had declared Light the winner due to Kaidoh' no-show. Light shut his eyes and snorted in recollection. Light enjoyed winning, but not by default.</lj-cut>





Now if only the fangirls mobbing my apartment building would <i>go</i> the <i>hell</i> away.


ETA: It appears that <a href=""http://pjsofjustice.livejournal.com/19511.html"">Near</a> has gone insane. I honestly wish I could laugh at him at a time like this but I'm finding it more creepy than humorous. Could someone put him out of his misery or something?"

Ginny, what are you doing sneaking my peanut butter back to your flat, then back here? *raised brow*

Reno, Ginny... I love you both but there's no leverage hefty enough to sway me. I will not be your goddamn Batman.

Fuji-san, congratulations. The pink sparkles are a bit much though.

Envy... thank you for stopping by on Wednesday. It was appreciated.

<b>What:</b> Sayu stops by her brother's flat; thus, Ginny finally gets to meet her
<b>Where:</b> Light's flat
<b>When:</b> June 29th, sometime in the late afternoon
<b>Why:</b> le duh.



<lj-cut text=""You've had enough peanut butter for the day."">Light hadn't left the apartment since Wednesday. It felt safe here, with the Shikon barrier in place and Ginny staying for the time being. The only connection to the outside world was the internet, which at present Light was ignoring. He felt like he was about to crack. This had been the month from hell. Light was in his living room, lounging on the couch with a bored look on his face. Maybe if he stopped thinking about things they would go away.

Having recovered from her upset of the night before, Ginny was just glad she was able to be around Light, even if he was still acting kind of standoffish. 
  
She wandered into the living room, eating peanut butter out of a jar she had snagged when she had gone back to her flat to get Cassie. ""Hi,"" she said to Light, tucking herself into a corner of the couch.

Moving an arm to cover his forehead, Light let out a sigh and nudged a foot at her to acknowledge her presence.

She smiled at him and poked his foot with her spoon. ""Love you,"" she said randomly.

""I do hope what touched my foot isn't the part you eat with,"" he groaned out.
 
She grinned at him. ""Afraid of getting my cooties?""

""Hardly. Wash it first before you use it again, is more what I was going for,"" he answered contritely. At that moment the doorbell rang.

""Ding-dong,"" Ginny whispered, and stuck the spoon back in her mouth.

Light got up reluctantly and headed for the door, but not before snatching the spoon from right out of Ginny's mouth, much to her pouting displeasure. A quick glance through the peephole, and Light was frozen. It was Sayu, his younger sister. He opened the door immediately, mood lifted somewhat from the cheery look on her face. 

""Hi, Nii-chan,"" said Sayu. ""You got my text message earlier, right?"" 

Light frowned. He hadn't touched any of his phones all day. ""No, sorry. My phone was on the charger."" All of this was in Japanese. They could be talking about pink elephants and Ginny would never know. Which reminded him... 

Ginny, meanwhile, was trying to figure out a way to look into the hall to see who was at the door without actually leaving the living room. Finally she gave up and crept out into the front hall, still holding her jar of peanut butter in one hand.

Sayu was in the midst of friendly chit chat with her brother when she saw a redheaded Caucasian woman show up far behind Light. ""Eh? Nii-chan,"" she said in Japanese. ""Who is your guest?""

Light paused, blinking. He had wondered how quickly the two most important people, both coincidentally women, in his life would notice each other, or if he would need to do or say something to initiate that. Without glancing behind he said, still in Japanese, ""She's my new girlfriend. Please come in and meet her. She doesn't understand Japanese, but she is British. English should be fine.""

""Ah!"" Sayu beamed. She gave the redhead a wave. ""Hello, I'm Light's sister.""

""Oh!"" Ginny beamed at her. She thought the woman had looked sort of familiar. ""Well, it's good to finally meet you.""

""Ginny, Sayu. Sayu, Ginny,"" Light said, motioning between the two, sounding less enthusiastic than he'd envisioned. His murky mood was still getting to him.

""Nii-chan hardly sounds excited."" Sayu pouted as she closed the door behind her, poking her brother in the shoulder in passing.

""He's sulking,"" Ginny said wisely.

""I am not,"" he retorted blandly.

Sayu, on the other hand, seemed to agree. ""He can be sore sometimes.""

Light snorted.

Ginny grinned at him. ""She's right, you know, love. It's okay though, we still love you."" She was really far too amused by this.

Sayu laughed heartily. ""Nii-chan has always been uptight. So."" As the three of them headed for the kitchen, she turned her attention to Ginny. ""Nii-chan said you are British?""

""Mm-hmm. I'm living in London right now, actually. My family's from this little town in the middle of absolute nowhere called Ottery St Catchpole, though.""

It was at this moment that Light took away the jar of peanut butter and found its requisite lid, screwing it on and placing the jar back in the right cabinet. ""We've been friends since last summer,"" he broke in, faced away from them. ""After... what happened to Misa, she was there for me, and one thing led to another..."" His hand stilled on a cupboard door.

Ginny's eyes flicked over to him and she smiled softly. ""And I already loved him, anyway,"" she said. ""I just wasn't clever enough to figure it out till recently.""

""That's so sweet. Our whole family had been so sad about what happened, but I'm glad to see Nii-chan is coping well enough to see someone else this soon."" Light made a sound in his throat at his sister's comment but made no move to negate her words.

""I'm just glad I'm the one who can make him happy,"" Ginny agreed, still smiling at Light.

Without turning around, Light shut his eyes, huffed and headed for the refrigerator. ""Sayu, would you like something to drink?""

""Eh? No, I won't be staying long."" Sayu took an item from her purse and handed it to him. It was in a bag. ""I said in my text message I was bringing this over.""

Light held the bag up, but did not take out whatever it was. ""Okay,"" he said, glancing from the bag to his sister.

Ginny raised an eyebrow at him and after a moment crossed the kitchen to dig back out her peanut butter.

""You've had enough peanut butter for the day,"" he scolded, pointing at her. 

She stuck her tongue out at him. ""It's my peanut butter.""

""I paid for it.""

""Already arguing like you're married,"" Sayu broke in, laughing.

Ginny had no response for this and flushed, sticking her head back into the cabinet and pretending to look for something.

Light also froze, looking mildly horrified.

""...And you didn't, either,"" Ginny said after a long pause. ""It came from my flat.""

Ginny's words seemed to snap Light out of his stupor, for he turned and said, ""That's a Japanese brand of peanut butter, Ginny."" Then to Sayu he gave a sheepish laugh. ""Ahm, Sayu, that is...""

But before Light could spin things away, Sayu beamed and gave her brother a pat on the shoulder. ""You're always so serious, Nii-chan. You need to lighten up a little sometimes."" 

""Yes, do,"" Ginny agreed, grinning again. She stuck a finger into the peanut butter, not feeling like digging out a spoon.

Retaining a put-out look, Light scoffed and reached for Ginny's hand. ""I'll think about it. And use a spoon, young lady."" 

Light had slightly fibbed, though. He was already thinking about it. The other it."

<lj-cut text=""If she wanted succinct, then she got it. Light had destroyed the Portkey the moment he returned. Vanished it right into oblivion. It was only to avoid utter cruelty that he left the settings on his Shikon barrier unaltered, should she wish to Apparate in to his flat. There was a difference between giving someone a sign and bashing their head in with it."">A week had passed since that fateful day Light stopped by Ginny's flat to find out why she'd been avoiding him. Why she hadn't gone to him the moment things had turned bad with Zuko once more. 

Light was an emotional wreck. For Light, that was saying a lot. While he hid it well from everyone, from Reno and Ginny and Sayu and <i>everyone</i>, that didn't negate things. It was there. 

And Kyouya wouldn't shut up about his disposal of Misa. He wouldn't shut up about his nightmares, the ones where he <i>failed</i>, where his father <i>had</i> shot him with real bullets, where his sister was unresponsive and locked away and his father was <i>dead</i> and he hadn't kept them from their fates...

Kyouya wouldn't shut up about <i>anything</i>.

Damn Death Note didn't seem to work on devils like Kyouya. Some amount of good <i>it</i> was. It was never good these days for the figures that needed to be <i>disposed</i> of. Damn rotten world.

And Ginny kept acting like all she had to do was apologise and everything would be <i>okay</i>, they could go back to before she had called him out as The Problem. <i>It's you, Light</i>, her voice kept echoing in his mind now and then. She may as well have said that he was responsible for ruining her life, but it was so much more <i>succinct</i> this way.

If she wanted succinct, then she got it. Light had destroyed the Portkey the moment he returned. Vanished it right into oblivion. It was only to avoid utter cruelty that he left the settings on his Shikon barrier unaltered, should she wish to Apparate in to his flat. There was a difference between giving someone a sign and bashing their head in with it.

At the moment Light was at his computer desk writing. The sun was spilling golden hues into the room, warming his back as his fingers clacked away at one of the many keyboards.

It had been a week since Ginny had spoken to Light, and she knew she was in bad condition. Since she'd broken up with Zuko, and moreso since Light had left her flat, she hadn't been sleeping - every time she tried to rest for more than a couple of hours, the Nightmare would plague her, and she would wake up screaming and crying and utterly alone. <i>That</i> hurt more than anything. Add to her exhaustion the fact that the stress had driven her back to going through a pack of cigarettes a day and she knew she was just hurting herself.

And she was tired of it. She'd rationalised it to herself as best she could -- if nothing else, she could try to explain to Light. Tell him how she felt, and explain why none of it was his fault. She was fairly certain that she'd lost any chance she might have had to be with him, but if she could just make him understand...

Ginny gathered her thoughts and did her best to focus, Apparating into the hall outside of Light's flat. She didn't want to press her luck. She stood there staring at his door for several minutes before she lifted a hand and knocked.

Light paused at the sound of the knock. It was faint, the computer room wasn't exactly close to the doorway into the building corridor, but he had heard it. He glanced in its general direction before focusing his attention once more at the computer screen, sighing. He didn't even bother flipping the switch to the security camera monitor. If it was important the person would do more than just knock at the door. Light wasn't in the mood to bother with anything trivial at the moment.

Ginny waited, chewing nervously on her lip. When there was no response after nearly a minute, she sighed and Apparated to the other side of the door. She was startled when she stumbled a bit -- she'd not had any problems Apparating in a long time; she must have been more tired than she realised. ""...Light?"" she called softly.

Light went rigid in the shoulders. His hands froze at the keyboard. ""I'm in the computer room,"" he said blankly after a moment, keeping his voice even and his eyes on the screen. So, she had come.

<i>Good job, Gin. He sounds</i> real <i>excited you're here</i>, she thought, but after a moment's hesitation she left the front hall and went into the back of the flat to the computer room. She stopped in the doorway, one hand resting on the frame. ""...Hi,"" she said quietly. God, it felt good just to see him again.

""...hi,"" he repeated without turning around, trying to keep <i>most</i> of the grumpiness out of his tone. He scanned the screen for any signs of a reflection, eyes flitting back and forth, up and down. In the far corner there was just enough glare if he tilted his head to the side just so, and panned the monitor a little to the right. He didn't want to look at her in person just yet.

He wouldn't even <i>look</i> at her. God, she'd <i>really</i> hurt him, hadn't she? Still, she had to at least try. ""I need to talk to you,"" she said after a moment.

""Do you."" Light's fingers continued to clack away, while Light watched her tiny reflection carefully. ""Sounds a good week late and then some, to me.""

Ginny had started to step into the room, but paused when he spoke. ""Light, <i>please</i> don't be like this,"" she said. ""I didn't mean that it was your fault. I'm <i>sorry</i>.""

The chair swiveled abruptly as Light finally turned to look at her, frustration written all over his face. His hands were clenching the plastic armrests. ""There's not much else I can take 'It's <i>you</i>, Light' to mean,"" he ground out. ""I have been there every single time he's upset you intentionally or otherwise with his idiocy and rashness. I have made myself available <i>every single time</i> you've had your damn heart shattered and in need of someone to pick the pieces back up for you. I've had a knife nearly slice my throat open, and I've fought for my <i>life</i> against your vengeful ex-boyfriend, who would have been written into my godddamn Death Note months ago if he didn't mean so damn much to you.""

All his words were coming out sharp as a sword, despite the dangerous, enviable calm in which they were spoken. Light's eyes were an inch from lacking emotion. He took a breath, and continued. ""What in the blazing <i>hell</i> am I supposed to think when the moment you break up with him you <i>ignore me</i> for days, then <i>hide</i> from me?"" He wanted to punch something.

Ginny stared at him in shock. He'd never been so <i>harsh</i> with her before. ""I didn't know what else to do,"" she said, blinking furiously against the tears she felt welling up in her eyes. ""I couldn't--"" She stopped. Why was it so hard to say?

""This is why I don't bother with relationships,"" he retorted, voice carefully controlled. ""Too much bullshit. It was almost pleasant having Misa as an excuse for so many years."" He averted his eyes for a second; seeing Ginny like this, trying not to cry because of <i>him</i>, was <i>killing</i> him, but this was the closest to flinching he'd come. When he returned his gaze he asked, ""Why should I continue to bother? What's in it for me? I-"" His voice cracked, but he plodded on. ""I don't even qualify as your rebound anymore.""

Ginny shook her head. ""You don't understand,"" she whispered. ""You don't--"" She swallowed hard, crossing the room quickly to kneel down in front of his desk chair, looking up at him. ""The reason I broke up with Zuko, the reason I couldn't come straight to you when I did..."" She made a helpless gesture. ""I'm in love with <i>you</i>.""

""That's... <i>what</i>?!"" This had to be a joke. It had to. It didn't make sense. She didn't want him. This was to lessen the blow, wasn't it? Light narrowed his eyes, although there was less of an edge to his gaze now. He swallowed. ""If that were true, that should have been all the more reason to come straight to me. Your actions don't match your claim.""

He didn't believe her. She'd fully expected him not to feel the same way, but to not <i>believe</i> her... ""I couldn't,"" she said, trying to find a way to explain. ""I... I had to think, and I knew if I came here and saw you..."" She opened and closed her mouth a couple of times, trying to find the words. Eventually she gave up and continued, ""And. I was scared..."" she trailed off, one hand lifting as though to cup his cheek but hesitating. ""You have to believe me,"" she said finally. ""Even if you don't feel the same way... you have to believe me.""

Swallowing again, Light rolled his chair back against the edge of his desk so he could stare. The girl was denser than mercury if that's what she'd been scared about. His face fell. ""What do you mean, 'if', Ginny...?"" he stated quietly, gathering his thoughts while computations ran through his head, putting all the pieces together. ""I tolerated him for you. I <i>let</i> it develop. I didn't interfere because I couldn't get rid of Misa, and it wasn't as if you'd shown any sign of wanting me that way. Not after I gave you that plushie of me. Not after all the times I was there for you. Not after Cupid made me post- post <i>that</i>, on Valentine's Day. Not after..."" Light shut his eyes. God, he was <i>babbling</i>, but he couldn't shut himself up. ""Not after I said I'd <i>get rid of Misa</i> if I could.""

""...Oh,"" Ginny said softly after a moment, staring at him. ""Light..."" A slow, shaky smile spread across her face. Was he saying that... ""Really?""

""Why else would I have been so devastated I destroyed the Portkey?"" he struggled to say straight, eyes lidded. ""Zuko was finally out of the way, <i>Misa</i> was too... and you ran away from me. You'd- made yourself- clear.""

""I didn't mean to run away from you,"" she said. She climbed back to her feet and stepped forward to stand in front of him, reaching down to lift his chin so he was looking at her. ""I love you,"" she told him, smiling. ""I've loved you for a long time.""

Light just gave her an incredulous look for a while as he processed things. Then he took her hand from his chin and pulled her down into his lap, arms wrapping around to hold her close, chin upon her shoulder and eyes shut tight, breath warm against her neck. Just a wordless embrace while he gathered the rest of himself together before he completely unraveled.

Gods, it felt good to have his arms around her again. Ginny closed her eyes and snuggled up against his chest, still smiling as she clung to him. ""I love you,"" she whispered again.

Light only hugged her tighter, the familiar scent of lavender enveloping them both. It seemed to calm him as much as the feel of her in his arms. He pressed a kiss against her neck. ""I love you,"" he breathed.

Ginny sat upright, reaching up to cup his cheeks in both hands so she could look at him for a moment before tilting her chin up to kiss him softly. She tasted salt and was startled to realise she was crying. She hadn't been this happy in <i>ages</i>.

""Heh, so I get tears either way,"" Light muttered against her lips, though it was apparent his comment was meant in jest. He reached a hand up to wipe the moisture from her face, keeping his lips in contact with hers and kissing her slowly.

She giggled against his lips, reveling in the feel of them against hers. She sighed contentedly and wrapped her arms around his neck, pressing herself closer to him.

After a long kiss Light pulled back and just <i>looked</i> at her. ""I hate to ruin the mood but perhaps we could relocate somewhere more comfortable than this chair?"" he asked, brow raised.

She blinked at him, still recovering from the kiss. ""...Okay,"" she agreed after a moment, and climbed backwards off of his lap, reaching down to weave her fingers through his and pull him up with her.

Light allowed her to pull him to his feet, and once on them, he spun his chair around and pushed it in, telling her he'd just be a moment. He had to save his work and put his computer into stand-by mode. Once that was done he led her out of the room. Headed straight for the bedroom, of course. It wasn't that he was in the mood for sex or anything of that nature right at that moment. All he wanted to do was hold her, be with her, and the bed was more comfortable for snuggling than the couch.

Ginny followed Light into his room and kicked off her jeans while Light flipped the covers down - she hated sleeping in jeans. She climbed into the bed and yawned up at him, having remembered suddenly how tired she was.

Light sat on the edge of the bed, eyes straying from Ginny's face down to her panties, then back up. She looked adorable yawning like that. He bent down to shrug off and remove his slacks. They weren't uncomfortable but it seemed to fit the mood.

She smiled at him and crawled over to wrap her arms around him from behind, pressing a kiss to the corner of his jaw before leaning her head against his shoulder and closing her eyes.

""Can't hold yourself back, can you,"" Light commented, smirking as he tugged off his slacks and kicked them into the corner. Before she could retort, he added, ""Be my girlfriend. You owe me.""

""...Okay,"" she said, beaming at him. She liked the sound of that.

Light's grin widened. He resisted the urge to laugh. Wait till Brawl found out."

<lj-cut text=""Not your average Light vs Hinamori 'battle'"""">Light was happy to return from the Pokemon universe relatively unscathed. Sure, he wasn't thrilled that his Pikachu decided to follow him back, and he still found it almost blasphemous that he couldn't defeat Near in a <i>Pokemon battle</i>, but Light was a versatile man. It would take more than his Spiritomb coming to a draw with Near's Mewtwo to get his spirits down.

The Pikachu made for a nice birthday present for Sayu, too. She was turning twenty on the 18th.

Not everyone was as lucky as Light though.

Far away in Hueco Mundo, the shinigami Hinamori was distraught. Her dear lover Aizen was beginning to scare her in ways she never imagined. Ways that did not involve him running a Zanpakutou into her gut.

""Lalalalaaaaa lalaalaaa~"" said Tinky Winky, waving forward row after row of small colored figures. They were marching together in imperfect rows, chanting and singing in harmony. The sun above them giggled as it looked down on them, its face as bubbly and adorable as a baby's. 

""There you are, Mommy!"" cried little Po, running up to Hinamori and tugging at the sleeve of her outfit. Hinamori tried to ignore the sun, which was <i>looking</i> at her with smiling eyes. Po pointed toward the horizon, where all the Teletubbies were assembled or headed. She looked. Atop a large cliff, upon a ledge, stood her dear Aizen. He was smiling and his arms were upraised in welcoming. 

""Thank you for joining my army,"" he began.

Hinamori stared, falling to her knees in shock.</lj-cut>




In other news, it's officially June 18th. Happy twentieth birthday to my dear sister Sayu. I'm taking her out to eat at her favorite restaurant."

<b>What:</b> Light goes to see Ginny.
<b>Where:</b> Ginny's flat
<b>When:</b> June 17th, afternoon, right after <a href=""http://hex-you-up.livejournal.com/29849.html"">this log</a>!
<b>Why:</b> because unlike usual she hasn't gone to him for emotional comfort, which worries him.



<lj-cut text=""Lie to him. That was all she'd been doing lately, wasn't it? To him and to Zuko."">Later, Ginny had fallen asleep on the couch. Reno had stayed long enough to make sure she was all right before leaving to let her get some rest.

After careful consideration, Light decided that he could not continue waiting to hear from Ginny. Perhaps he hadn't needed to, and should have gone over there immediately, due to the delicacy of the situation, but that was precisely why he hadn't. The situation was too delicate and best friends aside, it was common courtesy for Light to announce his visits beforehand. He was done waiting. She'd had plenty of alone time. He held up his Portkey and said, ""Windfall."" A few moments later Light appeared in the main room of Ginny's flat. He glanced around and quickly found her on the couch. She was asleep. Frowning, Light headed over. Almost by instinct he reached a hand out to move some stray hairs out of her face. Ginny was beautiful even when asleep.

She frowned in her sleep, shifting slightly -- she wasn't very deeply asleep and had felt Light's fingers brush her skin.

Light pulled his hand back. ""Ginny?""

She inhaled sharply, eyes flying open. She stared at him for a moment. ""Light.""

Light took a moment before answering. Something about her behavior was bothering him but he figured it was no cause for concern. She hadn't been expecting him, and was freshly awake. But why was she staring at him? ""Hey, are you all right? I was waiting all weekend to hear from you.""

She continued to stare at him, mouth falling open to speak though no sound came out. ""...I'm fine,"" she finally whispered.

Light closed his eyes, then opened them again, a hint of annoyance crossing his face. Fine his ass. In the past whenever something had gone wrong between her and Zuko, she had always come to him. Why this time should be any different was beyond him. Taking a deep breath, Light said softly, ""I know you better than that. You don't have to lie to me.""

Lie to him. That was all she'd been doing lately, wasn't it? To him and to Zuko. Her face crumpled. ""I can't--"" she began. <i>I can't deal with this right now.</i> She Disapparated.

Light heaved a sigh as she Disapparated. Looked like time to exercise his patience. He spent several minutes searching the flat for her, knowing full well that she might have Apparated to somewhere outside but taking his chances anyway. All the rooms were empty. When he tried the door for the bathroom he found it locked. He jiggled the handle, twisting it both directions. No go. He could easily Apparate in there but that didn't seem a wise choice. Instead, he knocked several times. ""I promise I won't come in, but please talk to me.""

Ginny was sitting on the floor, leaning up against the door, the heels of her hands pressed into her eyes. She was <i>not</i> going to let herself get all weepy again. ""I'm sorry,"" she said after a long minute, not having any more rational statement she could offer him.

""It's all right, you were upset and I must have... caught you off-guard,"" Light said in a guarded tone. ""But I'm worried about you."" Now was probably not the time to delve into an explanation of his mindset over the course of the weekend, but certain matters did need to be brought to her attention. He glanced around some before returning his gaze to the door, as if he could see Ginny through it looking back at him.

""...Zuko came after me yesterday.""

Inside the bathroom, Ginny kicked the cabinet under her sink and cursed. Of course he had. 

""I'll spare you the details,"" he continued, ""but I did make it unscathed, and Katara-san has once more jumped in as mediator."" The mention of the previous day's events brought a surge of images flashing through his head, and Light shut his eyes and rested his forehead against the door, one hand pressing against the barrier separating them.

""...Thank her for me,"" she said after a moment, speaking just loud enough to be heard through the door.

""I will."" Light went quiet then. He was thinking. The silence stretched between them, until Light broke it once more. When he spoke his voice was shaky, almost unstable, emotions getting the better of him. ""I need to thank you. For helping me learn magic. I'd be dead now if it weren't for you."" Light's hand on the door made a fist. Why was this so hard to say?

Ginny pressed her lips together, struggling again not to cry as she thanked every deity she could think of that she had. If he hadn't been able to defend himself... She didn't even want to <i>think</i> about it. The idea of losing him right as she'd finally figured out how she felt about him... it was too awful to dwell on.

""It's the last thing you need to hear right now,"" he added, ignorant of the true impact of that statement and the truth behind it. The tension between them was making him feel compelled to say <i>something</i>, and this seemed appropriate. ""Ahm."" He paused before continuing. ""Sayu's birthday is tomorrow. I wanted you to come with me to meet her, thought you two would get along, but I suppose this was poor timing and you... need more time to yourself. Whatever's troubling you must be severe if you feel you can't talk to me about it."" He paused again, listening.  

""I don't know how,"" she replied softly, dropping her head into her hands. ""It's <i>you,</i> Light."" It was the closest she knew how to come to an explanation. Add to that the guilt she felt over obviously disappointing him about meeting his sister, and she couldn't possibly tell him <i>now.</i>

Of all the responses Ginny could have given him, the one provided was far from his expectations. It struck him with undue clarity, like a white-hot ball of searing, but unwanted truth. Things fell into place in his mental puzzle. He froze, feeling a chill run through him, prickling at his shoulders and eyes and needling him in the stomach. It took a moment before he realised he'd been holding his breath.

On the other side of the door, Ginny sighed and pushed her hands through her hair, waiting for a response. The silence stretched out and finally she stood again, turning to rest her forehead against the door. ""...Light?""

The last thing he wanted was to worsen the situation with the same evasion Ginny had been doing with him, but there wasn't a whole lot one could say in response to this. Closing his eyes and focusing himself, he took several calming breaths. ""...I see,"" he replied cryptically.

""Don't be angry with me,"" she said pleadingly. She laid one hand flat against the door, wishing it was him she was touching instead. ""I'm... I'm all right, I promise."" She was, too, at least compared to the last time.

Light didn't respond, instead turning from the door the moment she spoke (don't be angry at her when she'd just named him the problem? angry? how could he be angry? numb with realisation was more like it) and rifling his fingers through his hair. His gaze was unfocused. His throat was closing up. Ginny's words were ringing in his head, as were Zuko's. The words had a numbing effect on him, such that Light had barely even heard her promise that she was okay.

""Light?"" she said after a minute when she didn't hear a reply. Her hand dropped to the doorknob and she hesitated. She <i>really</i> shouldn't open the door, she didn't think she could handle seeing him right now, looking him in the eye and <i>knowing</i> she loved him.

Light paused, sliding his gaze toward Ginny's voice through the door. ""I'm still here.""

She sighed with relief, her forehead thumping back against the door. ""Don't... ...I'm sorry,"" she finished after a moment. 

Light chewed his lip. ""I think I should be going,"" he whispered, only loud enough for her to hear. There was no point in staying. It would only make things worse.

<i>Dammit.</i> She <i>had</i> hurt him. Well, that was bloody brilliant. Break one man's heart, push the other away. She wanted nothing more than to run out and throw her arms around him and <i>refuse</i> to let him leave, but she stayed where she was, one hand still clenched around the doorknob. ""I'm sorry,"" she said again.

""Don't apologise,"" he retorted halfheartedly. Reaching into his pocket, he pulled out his Portkey, the one Ginny had made for him. ""I'm the intruder here. But I'll leave now."" After a pause he added, ""And I'm destroying the Portkey.""

Ginny's eyes went wide. ""Light, <i>no,</i>"" she gasped, hesitating only a moment before she flung the door open.

Light called out, ""Windfall,"" at the very moment she opened the door. He looked her straight in the face, wondering why he had been so blind in his beliefs that she would come running to him. But the Portkey was already doing its job. The room was blurring, Ginny was blurring, and then he was gone.

Ginny stood staring into empty space for several minutes, feeling like she had just ruined the last sure thing she had to cling to. She wrapped her arms around herself, feeling tears well unbidden in her eyes. ""No..."""

"event","Before anyone gets any funny ideas in their head I will make one thing <i>straight</i>: 

Yes, I gave my sister that <a href=""http://i177.photobucket.com/albums/w233/taijiyacest/pics/pikahamster.jpg"">Pikachu</a> I acquired while in the Pokemon universe. 

Yes, I said I never want to see another Pokemon again.

No, I'm not being hypocritical.

Sayu asked for it, Sayu's birthday is later this month, and Sayu's been a bit down the past couple weeks. It all works itself out in the end.


In other news, someone linked me to <a href=""http://meritjubet.livejournal.com/234113.html"">this</a>. I can't decide whether or not I'm surprised that Artemis+Light fic exists."

"event","You know how people 
have these little habits 
That get you down. Like Bernie. 
Bernie like to chew gum. 
No, not chew. POP. So I came home this one day, 
And I am really irritated, and 
looking for a little sympathy 
and there's Bernie layin' 
on the couch, drinkin' a beer 
and chewin'. No, not chewin'. 
Poppin'. So, I said to him, 
I said, ""You pop that 
gum one more time..."" 
and he did. 
So I took the shotgun off the wall 
and I fired two warning shots... 
...into his head. 


[ANNIE (Spoken)] 
I met Ezekiel Young from 
Salt Lake city about two years ago 
and he told me he was single 
and we hit it off right away. 
So, we started living together. 
He'd go to work, he'd come home, I'd 
fix him a drink, We'd have dinner. 
And then I found out, 
""Single"" he told me? 
Single, my ass. Not only 
was he married 
...oh, no, he had six wives. 
One of those Mormons, you know. So that 
night, when he came home, I fixed him 
his drink as usual. 
You know, some guys just can't hold 
their arsenic. 

 JUNE (Spoken)] 
Now, I'm standing in the kitchen 
carvin' up the chicken for dinner, 
minding my own business, 
and in storms my husband Wilbur, 
in a jealous rage. 
""You been screwin' the milkman,"" 
he says. He was crazy 
and he kept screamin', 
""you been screwin the milkman."" 
And then he ran into my knife. 
He ran into my knife ten times! 

[ALL] 
If you'd have been there 
If you'd have seen it 
I betcha you would have done the same! 

VELMA] 
My sister, Veronica and 
I did this double act 
and my husband, Charlie, 
used to travel round with us. 
Now, for the last number in our act, 
we did these 20 acrobatic tricks in a row 
One,two,three,four,five...splits, spread eagles, 
back flips,flip flops, one right after the other. 
So this one night before the show we're down at the hotel Cicero,the three of us,boozin', havin' a few laughs and 
we ran out of ice, so I go out to get some. 
I come back, open the door, and there's Veronica and 
Charlie doing Number Seventeen the spread eagle. 
Well, I was in such a state of shock, 
I completely blacked out. I can't remember a thing. 
It wasn't until later, 
when I was washing the blood off my hands 
I even knew they were dead. 

[MONA(Spoken)] 
I loved Al Lipschitz 
more than I can possibly say. 
He was a real artistic guy... 
sensitive... a painter. 
But he was always trying 
to find himself. 
He'd go out every night 
looking for himself 
and on the way 
he found Ruth, 
Gladys, 
Rosemary and Irving. 
I guess you can say we broke 
up because of artistic differences. 
He saw himself as alive 
and I saw him dead. 


Yes...so tonight I get to go out with my fav. girl...REANNA!!! Yah, i can't wait to go out and have a few drinks...I really need it...and I miss her so much, i wish she lived up here!! But at least i get to see her tonight. ;-)  Well thats it for now...update more later... ;-)"

<P><BR>So if anyone gets the chance to go and eat at the Texas Roadhouse do it. Just make sure you call ahead and get your name on the wait list... We (mom, dad, me, shawn, his parents, les, diane, matt and chris) all went last night and it was so cool. The servers do line dances for you, and Amie...you are going to love this...we told them it was les's b-day so they brought out a sadle and made him sit on it as they announced to the whole place that it was his 42nd birthday. It was so funny....too bad noone brought a camera. But besides the fact that it is a fun place, the food and drinks are awesome. </P>
<P>So now the crappy news..starting monday I am going to a new room at work. YUCK...it was bad enough when it was one day, now it is for good. It's the one room I absolutly hated when I had to go and help them. Now Its going to be EVERY day. I don't know anyone and I have to leave my friends and my little comfort zone. It sucks...the only good things are i get away from the bitch teresa and they are always behind in that room so there will be a lot of overtime. Blah...don't want to do it...so dreading monday. So now I am drowning my sorrows in Pepperment Schnapps..mmm..drinking it straight too...</P>
<P>So have you guys heard that new song my humps i think its called by the black eyed peas? I love that song, its so damn funny. And I so want that new tommy lee cd tommyland. I have two songs downloaded and they are really good...def. not like his music with motley crue..but really good. Plus tommy lee is sexy!! </P>
<P>Oh..does anyone remember the song ""cherry pie"" by warrant? Remember the video with the <FONT color=#ff6600>HOTTTTT</FONT> blonde singing...damn I wanted that...well my point is he was on celebrity fit club and damn...he went DOWNHILL...it doesn't even look like him. i couldn't believe it. <FONT color=#ff0000>""Swing it!

Lets see...So I have ringworm...how hot is that? Haha...but because of it I can't work in a mouse room...so  lost all my overtime I was going to get, then yesterday I was trying to go to work to get my leg looked at and my car was acting funny, I checked the oil and the transmission fluid, and all was well. So I decided to try driving it to the video store and later to the food mart and it was fine, so this morning I went to go to work and it wouldn't even start, and when I was turning the key the windshield wipers started going..even though they weren't on..weird. So there goes some more money..then I got a ride with Travis and get to work and they said my leg is not healed enough I have to go home...and of course I couldn't get shawns keys until 9:30, so I had to sit around, then I have to go pick him up and go with him to ellsworth. yuck. 

It wouldn't be so bad if we weren't trying to save up for an apartment. I got accepted at Northeast tech to go back to school, but because of traveling so far, we decided to get an apartment. We'll see when it finally happens...oh and I have to find a co-signer before I can go to school...ya..real nice..don't know anybody. It just seems like nothing can go right. It seems like there is always a wall in the way. 

Went out a few weekends ago for my friend Amanda's 21st B-day. That was fun, went to Margarita's then stayed at the Ramada and went down to Barnaby's. Had Jolly Rancher shooters...OMG...the best shit I have ever had. I had 4 in maybe an hour..whoa, I was drunk. I even got up and danced. and when I went to work the next week some guy asked if that was me there...it was so embarrassing, I figured noone from work would see me...o'well. 

Well for now I guess thats all that is really going on..hopfully I can get overtime this week, but because I used vaca. time to make up for today, i have a feeling any extra hours will either take over my vaca. hours, or just be straight overtime..which is a waste of my time..yah..can't ANYTHING just go right for once. Mom said it's the Carroll curse and I need to get married to Shawn so my luck will change. LOL...we'll see if that ever happens...."

"event","So, I have decided to take this weekend to relax and do NOTHING. Just sleep, get some sun, maybe read a book. Who knows...but I am hoping for a stress free relaxing weekend...we'll see if it happens. I've just been so tired and down and need a little break. Can't wait for my vacation August 22-26...yah...
So I won't be seeing my parents this weekend...kinda bummed about that. Miss them..and now all I do is worry that if I don't make it down then dad will have another heart attack and maybe he wont make it this time. I feel so guilty bout everything and everyone all the time and it just stresses me out. I need this weekend before I make myself sick. I think Sunday I am going to the beach with Travis, Amie, and Shawn. I hope so, that would be fun..yet still relaxing. 

So last Friday Shawn, Travis and I went out. We went to the Dry Dock to eat supper, then to Cyclones for drinks. I had Blue Hawaiians...OMG..so good, and I got really drunk. I ended up calling Reanna at like midnight or so...oops..she didn't answer though ;-( probably a good thing. Hahahaha. Then I called my parents and talked to my dad..haha..poor guy. I woke him up ;-(

A few weekends ago Shawn and I met mom and dad over to Les and Dianes, and Christy was there and we all were drinking, and everyone there go drunk. Les threw Christy in the pool in her clothes so she had to wear mine. Then he threw her in again, so I had to give her more clothes, that she spilt coffee brandy all over. Then her an mom were singing Karaoke (sp?) That was a sight to see. Dad was drunk and dancing, I was happy to see him happy, although I don't think he should be drinking..but ya know...at least he isn't smoking. 

Well I guess thats it. Gonna go do..someting...don't know...Shawn wants me to play Halo..and I did promise...but he's playing with a bunch of people I don't know which makes me uncomfortable. So we'll see...i am sure you all care..lol..."

I ache all over, my h ead, my body..and its been like that every morning for like 3 weeks. It sucks. I don't know why. Also my mood has been off the wall...pissed one second, sad and depressed the next minute, and then happy and horny...and i mean..like off the walls happy and horny..extremely..its weird. Even Ericka at work said I wasn't acting like myself the other day, when i was sad, then yesterday you couldn't get me to shut up and I was so giddy..the thing is, I really don't feel like myself. I don't know why. Me and Shawn are doing great. No problems there. So i don't know. well i guess thats it for now cause Shawn is getting up now and we are going to my parents for the night.

"event","So..a lot has gone on since my last update. Some life altering. Some just plain awesome. I start with all the good things first.

Went to that resort in New Hampshire. OMG. It was great. Fireplace, private balcony (we were the hightest up to so noone could see in) Jacuzzi..oh..grand.. And the adult onlt pool and hot tub was right outside close so we could go there, and there was barely anyone and no kids. So that was cool. And from our balcony there was a nice pretty field with trees, so it was private, and we looked to the right of our balcony and there was a fucking bear!! We saw it two nights in a row. That was cool too. We went shopping in North Conway which is a nice place, all kinds of neat shops, and then a bunch of outlet stores: Old Navy, Aeropostale, Nike, ADIDAS, Big Dogs, Nautica, Tommy Hilfiger...and the list goes on. So needless to say we came back broke. Shawn is so wonderful. He came up with going there, and paid for the room, and drove all the way there in back. I couldn't ask for a better man. God I love him.

Then on the fourth of July I got a call at 7 in the morning, dad was in the hospital having a heart attack. Talk about being scared shitless. We were at Shawns so it was an hour drive to the hospital. But Dad is doing good. It was a clogged artery and they put a stint into it. I am so scared. Even though its over and hes ok, i'm not completely ok. I am going to worry all the time now, I mean, I don't know how I could ever go on in my life if I lost my dad. He's only 41..he has a way to go and it could happen again..but he has quit smoking and drinking and is doing good with his diet..so thats good, but he is going back to work next week...I don't think he should be going back to were he is..its going to kill him..its Scary. 

Now back to a better note. This past weekend we went to Shawns Aunt and Uncles camp in Eastbrook. It was fun. Saw a parade and fireworks. And the best part of all was Amie and Travis finally met, and I believe they hit it off. They may just be a couple soon. Cross my fingers. They are both great people and they deserve to be happy like me and Shawn. Good luck to you two!!

I got a raise at work...51 cents so I am making $10.76 now. Definatly needed. I just made a budget and Shawn and I are starting a savings account to put money for his durango, and then out house into. money will be tight the next two weeks...but after that...we can save 500-1000 a month if we stick to this budget. 

Well I guess that is it for now. miss you guys..and leave me some damn comments, i get bored when shawns on Halo and need something to do..hehe.."

<P><FONT color=#cc33cc>So today is one year for me and Shawn....yah...I am so happy.. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc33cc>I wish I felt better though. Have had a bad tooth/earache, so I called in Monday, went to the dentist tuesday to get my tooth pulled...but they said they could save it, so the dug all the nasty decay out of it and put in a temporary filling. When he was drilling though...the novacain didn't work in the tooth...so i ended up feeling the intense pain and yelping out...ouch...then after the novacaine wore out it starting hurting worse than before I got it ""fixed"" and today I thought I was going to die..it wasn't even my toothache that hurt..its my ear...it has this intense sharp pain. So going to the docs today and hopfully get it all fixed before my big weekend. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc33cc>I can't wait for this weekend, its going to be awesome...shopping in N. Conway, jacuzzi, swimming and lounging by the pool, just me and shawn, alone, together...how awesome is that...and so romantic. It feels so good to be with Shawn. Now I want to pass on this wonderful feeling to another friend...hopfully it works out between them. I think they will go good together. We'll see though. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc33cc>Well off to the doctors now...I miss you all...leave me some comments!! Let me know whats going on with all of you!</FONT></P>

"event","So thought I'd write a little update. Work is going good. Just started my Animal Care 1 class today. 4 hour class for the next 6 fridays. WooHoo...but thats four hours I get paid to sit there and listen. Today I actually stayed awake even though I came in at 4:30 to work, then had to sit through that. So thats 6.5 hours of overtime so far this pay period. Hope I get more...need the $$. 

Ya so with the whole ""Slutface"" thing. Her name is Heather. And here is what happened. I got drunk, got pissed and told Shawn he couldn't e-mail her anymore and to tell her the same...finally after bawling forever Shawn did do this because he realized how bad it really hurt me. Then, the next day I felt bad, and so being the bigger person...just like Reanna knows me to be (damn..she knows me too well) I e-mailed Heather and told her she could talk/write to Shawn, that although I do feel a little uneasy, it wasn't fair to Shawn. So she told me that she did have feelings for Shawn but she loved her husband..ect..and then I guess she e-mailed Shawn and said that he was to not e-mail her anymore and that me and her were now ""buds"" LOL..how ironic...I guess I got what I wanted by being the bigger person. So take this as a lesson...that by being the bigger person it will pay off in the end. So ya, I think that is all my gossip for now...I LOVE SHAWN..he's a fucking god. How did I get so damn lucky..."

"event","OMG...I can't believe how hot it is..but I'm not complaining..better than that nasty wet cold rain.

So the other weekend I went to Cyclones, the bar in Southwest with Ericka and Reagan. It was fun. Got REALLY drunk...and got a free drink from this guy. I took it...drank it in like 5 minutes...if that...and got out of there. I am a taken woman you know. But it was fun. Then this weekend Shawn and I went to The Acadia Zoo. That was fun. Took all kinds of pics. The monkey's were adorable. I want a monkey so bad. Then Sunday went to see the fam. We all went to Les and Diane and went swimming in the pool and got a nice burn..that better turn into a nice tan. Hell Ya. 

Work is going great. Love it. Got 10 hours overtime comming in this weeks paycheck....Yes...I can't wait. Told Nick I'd take overtime anytime this week...or anyweek. 

So I need some opinions.... Here is the senerio. Say there is this couple..we will call them Jaycey and Jonathan. And Jonathan knows this Girl..we will call her Slutface. And Before Jaycey and Jonathan were a couple this slutface wanted Jonathan and would write him love letters...until her husband found out...(told you she was a slutface) Anyways...then While Jaycey and Jonathan were together she saw them together and knew they were together then slutface writes a text message to Jonathan saying how she still loves him. And know still knowing they are together is e-mailing him all the fucking time. Does Jaycey have a reason to be pissed? And doesn't she have the right to say that she doesn't want him to write to her and that he and needs to tell her to stop writing to him. I mean if it were just some friend that was a girl...Jaycey wouldn't mind..Actually he is still good friends and still talks and writes to his ex.g-friend. And I am fine with that...but this is different...she wants him and she IS going to try and get him...Out of pure respect for me he sould tell her to stop writing to him...and out of respect for her husband...whom use to be his friend...he shouldn't be writing to her either because I'm sure he wouldn't be ok with it since they aren't friends anymore because of this. So..what do you guys think...is Jaycey in the right?? God I wanna kill a bitch...

 please leave comments...I need some guidence.

So June 29th is Shawn and I's One Year Anniversary and he has booked us a Penthouse at a resort in the White mountains in New Hampshire. It has a jaccuzzi, a balcony, a fire place. Then there is a Indoor and outdoor pool with hottubs, nightly bondfires, and all kinds of activities...Sweet. If you want to see it the link is in Shawn's Profile: pochong81...check it out. 

So I guess that's it..."

"event","So I passed my test and am officially a ""Production Tech"" and Jackson Labs..woohoo. I was so nervous...but the test was easy. Tomorrow I will have no trainer....scary...although tomorrow wont be too bad because it's a day off for everyody...so just a few of us are going in for overtime on the holiday. I'll be making like $ 16 something an hour that day. Looking foward to that paycheck. I'm hoping I can get some more overtime this week too. We'll see. 

So this upcomming Friday I am finally going out to a bar. Ericka and Reagan from work are going out to the Cyclone in Southwest with me. It's suppose to be just the girl because they said the guys there will buy us free drinks...but I am hoping Shawn shows up...it would be fun...but we'll see if he does or not. 
Then Saturday I have Ericka's Bridal Shower. So a fun weekend ahead. Can't wait.

Well I guess thats really all for now. Just a quick update."

Fucking wonderful. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>So I am 21 and have been since the middle of March and I still haven't been to a bar. I have no life. I mean i do..me and Shawn hang out on the weekends, and its fun...but I just want to get out and have more fun. All of my friends that are 21 are too busy for me or live forever away ;-( And the one friend that would go out to the bars with me is only 20...21 in August. Crap. I just miss having my friends around and doing things like in highschool. At least I have Shawn though. He is always there for me...well unless he's playing Halo. Hehe. I love you baby. I just feel like getting really drunk tonight...but unfortunatly I must work in the a.m. Learning a new thing so I can't call in. Not that I would anyways. I guess I am just depressed. I don't know why..me and Shawn are as great as ever so it's not that. I think I'm lonely...but not..I have Shawn...so not that kind of lonely...just not having any other friends around lonely. Does anyone even know what the hell I am talking about? Haha. I don't even know if I do. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>Work is going good though. I really like my job and the weeks go by fast this week is 3 months that I have been there. I take my test on Friday then I am done training and officially on my own. Kind of scary yet exciting at the same time. I think I may be staying in the room I am in now...so that will be awesome if thats the case. </FONT></P>

It has a dragonfly in the middle with trible on both sides then a baby dragonfly on the two ends of the trible with Shawn above it. Its in pretty blue, magenta, and purple. Sometime I am going to get a photo albulm online if I can get Shawn to help me get my pics online, then I'll put a link in here so you guys can see it. 

A few weeks ago I got to see Reanna. Her, her boyfriend, me, and Shawn went out for drinks at Ruby Tuesdays. It wasn't that long of a visit ;-( but it was so worth being able to see her. She is suppose to come up sometime in June and we are going to have a ""slumber"" party and make a tent in the living room with blankets like when we were kids. I can't wait. It's going to be a blast. 

Work is going good. Two more weeks of training then I am on my own. Which is fine...if I get to stay in the same room. I hope so..I know everyone in there, I know where everything is, and I know how everything works in there. So Cross my fingers...

We had a suprise party for mom last weekend. We totally suprised her. She had no idea. We showed up with mom like 15 seconds before anyone got there so she thought that it was just us and Shawn getting together, so us getting there first helped throw her off. We had Over the hill stuff all over the place and I made her cake and wrote  ""6 feet under the hill""

Oh and i love Shawn. This friday was sooo lonely without him.  I went to mom and dads by myself. It pathetic that I live with him and I miss him sooo much just one night away. He won this basketball tournament yesterday and his picture should be in the bar harbor newspaper. He played 7 games back to back then got a little 15 minute break I guess...then played two more. Poor guy was sooo sore yesterday. God I love him....

Ya...so I think that is all that has really gone on with me. I'm craving french toast...and now after talking about moms cake...cake. Mmmm...I am so damn hungry..so i guess i will end this and go find some food."

2. I will respond by asking you five questions. I get to pick the questions.
3. You will update your LJ with the answers to the questions and leave the answers as comments on my LJ.
4. You will include this explanation and an offer to interview someone else in the same post.
5. When others comment asking to be interviewed, you will ask them five questions.

Reanna asked me:
1. Which is worse to experience: a tornado or a hurricaine?
2. Would you rather: eat your arms off to escape being trapped in a bear trap or cover yourself in skunk pee to avoid being harassed by animals in the woods?
3. Why are they called ""peanuts"" if they are neither peas, nor nuts?
4. If you could go back and re-live any moment of your life, cause it was a good experience, which one would you choose, and why? 
5. True or false: the rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain.

My answers:
1. A tornado...I think...If it were comming staight at me...
2.I'd rather cover myself in skunk pee...at least I would still have my arms..
3.peanuts aren't nuts??...haha..oh..well I thought they were just small nuts..haha
4.When Reanna came up last spring and we actually got to hang out for a few nights...went out to eat..watched Club Dread...haha..penalope...It was great..
5.True...i guess..never been there ;)

Lee got it all over him and Chris's girlfriend Colleen..haha.. All and all it was a good night. &nbsp;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6600cc>So Shawn and I am doing really good.&nbsp; I love him so much. Friday night we are going to his cousin Heather suprise B-day party..excited about that...that will be fun. We are going in this Saturday to get tattoo..he's getting a Philidelphia Eagles tattoo, and I am getting a dragonfly..well&nbsp; it looks like a butterfly...but they say its a dragonfly...either way it looks good. I am going to try and put the link to it on here...but we'll see. Then I am having Shawns name put under it...I got it pre-approved by mommy, and I am going to do it like the tribal around my butterfly so if something ever does happen I can get it coverd over. but I know Shawn is the one. EVERYONE in my family loves him right to death...both sets of grandparents who have never liked any other boyfriends...and my mom who has never really liked or knew it wasn't going to work out...but she says he's the one...and I know its true.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6600cc>So my car fucking sucks. Friday and Sunday to and From Kenduskeag - Soutwest Harbor my brakes were going...so I had to take it to the garage yesterday and we called today and they said my brakes are fucked up big time. Yah..its going to be like $200 to fix. Fun Fun. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6600cc>Yesterday was fun. I played HORSE with Shawn and his brother and I got further than Derek and got Shawn up to an S..but then he beat me. Then I played 1 on 1 with his little brother in football..we stayed tied until I was too tired so we went next point wins...and he won...but I think for me not knowing what the hell I'm doing and never really playing any sports I did damn good...although I thought I was going to die..I was beathing so hard and my heart was beating a thousand beats per minute. You'd think I was a smoker. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#6600cc>Well I guess thats really all thats gone on since my last entry...woohoo..hope you liked the little update...although noone ever leaves me a comment anymore....</FONT></P>"

"event","So ya...Saturday I was the drunkest I've ever been in my whole life. But it was fun. Mom, Dad, Shawn, Jimmy, Les, and Diane went to Family Fun lanes. I kicked ass the first game..then the alcohol started to fuck my game up. I had a Killer Kool-aid, 2 Sex on the Beach, 1 Cosmopolitian, and 2 melonball shooters. Ya...I was definaly drunk. I laid on the floor halfway in the bathroom, halfway in the all, then under shawns feet in the living room, then moms bed, then the couch. Then while I was on the couch Shawn called my cell phone and was asking for jimmy so I gave jimmy the phone...shawn was right there so I should have heard him asking...but I was too fucked up..then even though Shawn was right there I was asking jimmy to bring me to Shawn...and he brought me to the bedroom. And I kept saying over and over ""it's spinning"" But I must say for the amount of alcohol little ol' me had I did pretty good, I did get sick just before I went to bed, but the next day I was able to get out of bed, I felt shitty...but not stuck in bed sick as ever hung over. And the drinks I had were generous...They were big glasses filled right up...yah...I'm pretty proud of myself. 

This weekend is going to be fun...it the annual Kenduskeag Canoe Races and were are having a BBQ and getting drunk. Shawn just ordered a Keg. It's gonna be fun!! Les and Diane are comming, and Shawns cousin Christy and her boyfriend. So I'm pretty excited about that. 

I got a cell phone...got it off Jimmy 'cause he didn't have the money to keep it. So my number is 974-7449 if anyone wants to get ahold of me. I was going to change the number so that Jimmy's friends didn't call it all the time, but I've only gotten 2 calls since Saturday and I told them it wasn't his phone anymore...so I'm not too worried about it. 

April 28th I may be going to my first pit party...yes I am a loser and have never been to one. I'm hoping that maybe thats the week Reanna's going to be up and hse can go with me...if no us two have to go out to a bar or something now that I am finally legal. 

Well I guess thats really all...not much other going on in my life other than work..which is going good...I love my job and the days go by sooo fast. So I miss you all!! Hopfully I can get up to KFC sometime and see you all!!"

Ya, like anyone really cares...but o'well. So I am sitting here drinking Long Island Ice Teas..mmm...good...although Shawn has dumped two all over the desk and me tonight. I am so sticky. And I am definaly buzzing. I just called my friend Amanda and her, I, shawn, and her boyfriend Timmy are going out for dinner and drinks at the 99 on Saturday. I can't wait. We went to Chili's last Friday for dinner and drinks and I was definatly drunk by the end of dinner. But it was so much fun. We were going to go to the 99 but I lost my license (left it at the bowling alley in ellsworth...ooops) so we went to chili's since they knew I was 21. But it was still a lot of fun. It was cool that I got to hang out with my friend from highschool and her boyfriend and mine got along really good. So thats cool. Then April 16th is the Kenduskeag Canoe Races. Thats always fun. I think we are having a BBQ and Shawn, Les, and Diane are comming down, and I invited Amanda and Timmy if they want to. It's nice to finally have somewhat of a life, actually doing stuff. Well I guess thats it for now. I love and miss you all!!"

Me and Shawn are wonderful. I love him so much. He is too good to me. This week is my last week of not working then I start at the lab on Monday. Me and Shawn have decided that instead of getting an apartment in a few months we are going to save for a year and buy a house. I am so happy. A house of my own, can you believe it? Life has just been getting really good lately. My luck is changing a little bit. Next Sunday is my 21st b-day. I think I am just going to come home and go out with Shawn and my family to eat and buy my first alcoholic drink. Yah. I figure no point and going out to the bars on a Sunday. Then if all goes well the next weekend I will be going out to a bar with Shawn and my friend Amanda and her boyfriend Timmy. I'm excited. My life just seems to be falling all together nicely. Monday I went to Amanda Thompsons and Nicholes to visit for a little while and then Wednesday I got together with Amanda T and F and we went to the Olive Garden for lunch and then to Dave's Movies to look at the XXX stuff...I know, we are dirty. But I got some new movies, and then I had a dream about me watching porn and it made me sick and I woke up feelin like I was going to puke, so right now the thought of it makes me sick. But Amanda got them for me for my b-day so I'll get over it so she didn't waste her money. Last week was Shawn's Vacation so I stayed the whole week with him. Saturday night we got drunk and were playing video games and we played under my name and Shawn played while I had the microphone so everyone thought it was a girl kicking there ass, but it was Shawn. It was fun talking shit. The next morning I wasn't hung over either, first time. Guess I am getting better at holding my liquor. But I guess thats really it for now. Nothing else really going on. Amie and Erin---Hope you are having fun in Florida, Reanna--Hope you like your new living arrangments...I miss you! Aleesha--Miss seeing you, have fun working the chicken..lol You too Serena..and you should get together with that Dan Fox...he is a foxx...hehe. Love and miss you all....especially love you shawn ;-)"

I had to get three viles of blood taken, urine test, eyes, color blindness, TB testing, all this reflex and exercise things, heart reate while doing exercises...man oh man, and the list goes on. But I passed, The most embaressing thing was when I the guy was sitting behind me and I had to bend over while he felt my back to check something and my ass was right in his face. HAHA. Yah, embaressing. They said I should be starting in about a week. Yah. Then me and Shawn are going to save up for an apartment in the area so that will be awesome. Not such a long drive to work and get to be with my baby. Things really seem to be turning around for me. I can't wait to start working. 

Thursday is my mans 24th b-day. I feel bad because I didn't have much money to get him anything. ;-( I know that he doesn't really care, but I feel like shit because he spends so much money on me ALL the time. But all of that will change when I start working at the lab. 

Guess thats it, not really a lot other than that going on. Oh, and I love Shawn... ;-) <3"

Monday morning as I was leaving Shawns to go to work Jackson Labs called me and did an interview over the phone. I was so excited. She said she was going to call my last three jobs and then get back to me at the end of the week. Well I was a little worried about that because I know Diane at Mr. Paperback doesn't like me and Charles at Chili's is an ass most of the time and hasn't known me that long. Well Mel told them how I was such a great and went on and on, and Dana said that Charles gave me an excellent recomendation. So Tuesday the lab called me at work and set up a second interview tomorrow. I am so estatic. It is 7:30-3:30 Monday through Friday making $10.25 an hour with benifits, sick time, vacation time, etc. It's awesome. I hope I get it. I'll still be doing school Tuesday and Thrusday nights, Starting Feb. 28th I start Pharmacology. So hopefully if I get this I wont feel like such a loser and I will have money to get caught up on all my bills, and even ahead, get my credit cards paid off, and start on my doctors bills over the last 3 years. I owe St. Joesephs like $500 and something from 2002 on. Then I can save up and get some money saved for a place of my own. Yah. Guess thats all thats really gone on. Get to spens 5 days in a row with my man. Got down here at 10:30 last night, wanted to beat the snow. Going to go read my book now and wait for the soaps to come on."

Played Scattergories with Shawn today and lost...CRAPPY. It was funny though..we had to come up with a girls name that started with B...so I but Beatrice beacuse who in the hell would end up putting that....well Shawn did...It was funny..what are the chances. 

Then Shawn...thinking he was funny spit a finger nail IN MY EYE!!! When I was trying to get it out it ended up getting stuck in my eye lashes. Wonderful..it was hot...yah.

So I guess thats really all that has happend this weekend..Thats pathetic.. SUPERBOWL TOMORROW!!! Fun Fun...New England is going to kick ass...Between the two teams they need to score 69 points for me to win the pool and get $160...woohoo..I could really use the money...I have Shawns b-day, V-day, car insurance, school books, etc..all due this month on top of my regular bills. Yah.

I go back to school Feb. 28th. Can't wait. Kind of excited. Wont feel like such a bum. Then if all goes well will be done in 4 MODS and can get a real job...actually a career. Rake in the big bucks ;-) I can't even comprehend it. Doesn't seem possible, me graduating and getting a good job. My luck sucks. But if I work hard...maybe. I am taking Pharmacology and Elementary Keyboarding. Maybe I can finally learn how to type. ;-) 

Well guess thats is for now...Gonna go take shots of Peppermint Schnapps...How exciting huh.."

"event","So tonight I had a 3-sum...It is this new alcoholic drink. It was really good. Then I had Rum and Wild Cherry Pepsi..yum..I am definalty buzzed. Shawn convinced me to play Halo 2 with him tonight and I actually had a lot of fun. I played for 4 and 1/2 hours. I can see why it is addicting. I actually killed people too...haha...before when I played here and there I never killed anyone so I never played...but nope..tongiht I killed people and had the time of my life. I probably shouldn't put that because I don't want Shawn knowing I loved it...haha...I'm never going to hear the end of it now. 

Tonight we went to watch MDI play Bucksport. MDI Kicked ass. Shawns cousin Wes is on that team. I saw Mel there, her son plays for Bucksport. She didn't see me though. It was fun. Nice to get out and do something. 

I watched that movie Sky Captian...it was ok...not something I would normally watch..but wasn't too bad. Plus it had Angelina Jolie...and I love her..so that rocked. 

Shawn's dad said they were looking for my application for Jackson Labs...so hopefully I will hear something soon and get a job. Need the money so bad...and it is REALLY good money...I guess pretty much everything you do there starts off at at least with 10 something an hour. Cross your fingers. 

Next week is Super Bowl...can't wait...Pats are going to kick ass. At least they are playing Philidelphia so if they do lose, it's by another team I like. 

Last night I slept in a chair. I told Shawn to change out of his jeans, I didn't want to sleep with him with his jeans on. And he wouldn't, so I told him I was going to sleep in the chair...well we both fell asleep, and even when I woke up and realized, I refused to get up and get into bed unless he told me to...well he never did...he didn't even wake up and realize that I wasn't there until 5:30 a.m. I finally got up and got into bed at 8:30a.m. LOL. It wasn't oo bad either. The chair was pretty comfy. 

Well I guess I will stop rambiling now. Off to bed."

"event","I can't wait for this deep freeze shit to go away. I hate that it is so cold. I don't even want to get gas for my car. 

So I went to my interview, she is going to look if there are any jobs available and call me. She is going to try and see about getting me into a medical office. Yah..that would be awesome. 

We got a new computer today...Finally, this one is pretty old and is so slow. We are also getting Verizon DSL so everything will run faster and I don't have to worry about getting offline so that people can use the phone or calls can get through. Good Good Good. I love it when Dad gets his safety bonus. ;-) 

Chili's called today yelling at me because the girl who took my shift didn't come in because she got in a car accident. Not my fault. Damn Chili's. Another girl came in for me thought. Dana was still pissed off though and said that next time I will be written up. BITCH. I can't wait to be done that place. 

Well I guess thats it for now. Gonna go set up the new computer."

"event","I feel like shit....

I hope I don't have that flu thing going around. 

So tomorrow I have that job interview with Work Source..so hopfully they can find a nice full time job for me...if not I am calling that Holly's Professional Cleaning. So hopfully some money. Today I found out that Chili's doesn't even mail out there W-2's until January 31st...UHG...I want it now so I can get my return back quick...errr. And Charles the manager was a total ass when I asked if he knew when we would get them. He's such a jerk sometimes. I hate that place more and more every day. I don't hate the job...I just don't like the managers and some of the employee's there..not like KFC..I loved everyone..sometimes the managers would get on my nerves...but other than that it's all good. 

So Friday I am getting TiVo...Yah..It has to be the greatest invention ever made. My Daddy is getting it for me with his Safety Bonus. My 
B-day gift  ...a little early, but it's all good. 

Last night I got to work at KFC. I got to work with Serena...Yah...Emily was the other register person. I don't think she's as bad as everyone says. I have only worked with her twice since she's been back...but she doesn't get on my nerves and is really nice to me. Who knows. 

Well I guess thats it for now. Off to beddy...Sleep..Yes..."

"event","Been a little while since I last wrote. Not much really going on. I read Amies and Erins journals and they are always writing about fun stuff that they did...I feel like such a bum. I picked up a shift today at Chili's..so a few more hours than last week, and I work KFC tonight and Thursday day. So that'll be good. I have an appoitment Thrusday afternoon with work source to get a full time job...that's actually full time. So lets hope. I also found a job in the paper cleaning houses monday thru friday...no weekends...That would be good too...then I would have the whole weekend with Shawn...poor Shawn. 

So this weekend was good. I went down to Shawns Friday night. We watched the movie White Castle...Holy Shit..that was so funny. Definatly a must see. If you like American Pie or Super Troopers you'll love this movie. Then Saturday Night he bought The Forgotten...Kick ass movie as well. And of course Sunday was football...PATRIOTS VS THE EAGLES FOR THE SUPERBOWL. Hell Ya..The superbowl is going to be awesome. And Shawn barley played Halo all weekend. Friday night he did while I was reading this really awesome book. Then Saturday we played two games together..I suck...I didn't kill anyone...but I died the least amount of times..oh ya. So that was awesome. I wish I were better at it so we could play more. I am just a super nintendo chick. I told him if he had a wrestling one or some type of one where you just beat eachother up I could do that. 

SO I am getting all ready for my 21st birthday..I am slowly building up my alcohol tolerance (sp?) Three weeks ago I had 2 drinks, 2 weeks ago 3 drinks, and this weekend 4 without feeling buzzed or sick. I'm just so not use to drinking. The summer of 2003 I drank every weekend and had built up and the last weekend I drank before Dave left for Mass. was 9 shots soco, 2 magaritas, and 2 jello shots...little o'l me...and i was fine...no hangover... nothing...just really drunk. So hopfully by my b-day I'll be able to do it again... ;-) 

I guess thats really it. Off to work all day. $$$Money$$$ Not much...but you know, it'll have to do."

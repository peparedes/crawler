Today I walked over to Jon's house, to play D&D, and I was startled when I realized I had walked by two people on a crowded sidewalk without feeling any real sort of discomfort. I consider this a real achievement for me, for some reason, despite having done nothing to acquire this seemingly supernatural power. Most of my life, though, I have felt horribly uncomfortable when thrust into any situation where I had to deal on a personal level with any strangers. This is such a bad discomfort it has always included even passing people in hallways. I never know what to do. Do I look at them? Do I look down, pretending not to see them? Smile? Nod my head? Do both? Neither? Do I glance at them, acknowledging their existance, then quickly look away, as if to say ""I know you're there, but you mean nothing to me""? Should I keep my hands in my pockets? Walk purposefully? I just don't know. Sometimes my discomfort is so bad I do things like pretend to yawn or cough, just so that I'm sort of ""exempted"" from having to make any sort of acknowledgement, because I'm somehow busied by my body's functions. But anyway, today I walked past two people. And I'd passed the second man and then realized I'd really felt nothing. It was... ...well, nothing, really, and I was happy. It was like putting a neurosis in a box.

On another note, though... I hate when people talk over me. It drives me berserk. I hate being interrupted. I hate being spoken over. So much. And it happens to me more than I feel it does to many other people. Perhaps it's because I'm often very soft spoken. Or maybe I'm just not INTERESTING. I dunno. But even online, I feel that people are often much happier to be talking to just about anybody or anything else they can interact with than me. Sigh. Lose one neurosis, find another, perhaps."

Okay, not really. I just thought ""SEXUAL HEALING"" was more interesting and amusing than... ""I FEEL LESS INCLINED TO THROW UP NOW""! 

'cause, y'see, I've been curled up in bed for about four days (since Monday) sick as a dog, with severe stomach cramps among other things. Thankfully, today, I feel a lot healthier (although not exactly 100%) and am excited by this. That means I get to play D&D tonight!

Which leads me to another thing! I don't know what I'd do without D&D. Really. I am so BORED lately, I look forward to this one night all week. Last week, Andrew (who's integral to our current plotline) was sick, and couldn't play. I was devastated. I was so unhappy to lose our session, I even offered to DM a random, OTHER storyline with just Jon and Neil... oi vey.

Other than that, I don't have much to report, I guess. I simply felt suddenly inclined to make use of this thing. OKAY LADY BYEBYE I LOVE YOU! *toddles away*"

Like, at all. With everything. What am I doing? Where am I going? Just _how much_ value do I have? Besides the cents you'd get from boiling me into my individual elements, I mean... But am I just wasting my life? Am I just a _waste_ of life?

And why do I only post on my journal when I'm upset?

I just don't understand. I don't understand the world. I'm afraid of dying, but I don't do much with my life. It's all the same monotony every day, and I never make any headway into accomplishing anything. Just what am I doing for anybody? No matter how many compliments I hear, they roll off me like water. I'm unable to accept that I'm in any way a good thing. I feel like an anvil in the ocean, pulling down the people stubborn enough to cling to me. 

I don't understand people. I don't... get it. I can't take people for face value anymore. I can't figure out their thoughts and I get frustrated and distance myself. I'm too sensitive, and I don't like to be hurt, at all. I just... I can't cope, some days. And some days, I'm content to slide into this dull, dreary existence and just 'be'.

"event","I don't feel well. No matter how early I sleep, no matter how late I awaken, I always feel tired. I don't think I've been sleeping _deeply_ for a long time now. My eyes burn. And I always half remember things in the night, like my cat crawling over me or awakening to hear a verse of a song left on my computer. Hearing cars race by my window - four lanes of pavement less than a hundred feet from my window. Perhaps closer to fifty. Maybe less than that, even. I judge distance badly...

And then, strange dreams. Strange, strange dreams. The night before last, it was some mad priest's quest for power by telepathically controlling and mutating the royalty. Last night, I had a party with all my friends in some kind of void hallway, full of doors that lead to strange rooms. They all did things that made me upset or angry and it's probably the closest to a nightmare that I can possibly get. Besides the one where I thought I destroyed the universe. Even _I_ find that fairly scary.

Lately I've just had this surrounding feeling of discontent. Maybe it's a stressful time of year for people in general, and I'm picking up on that too heavily. But it begins to wear on me, I think. 

Yesterday I talked to Gary for the first time, I think. It felt unusual. I mean, usually when I see Gary, it's with Jordan and Bill, and we're all sort of having a free-for-all where we chatter about nonsense and insult each other whimsically. But Jordan had class. Bill went home with Cathy. So Gary and I were left to wander around campus and, of course, went right to our mutual love.

House of the Dead.

Oh yes. The crappy old shooting game from... what? 1997? Old, in video game standards. It was really odd how deep it went, though. It was like we were proving ourselves to one another on this field of battle. I went first. After tearing through most of the game on a single credit, the zombies eventually took me and I had to give up the gun, for lack of quarters. Though, with commentary like ""Whoa, like a sniper!"" and ""That was niiiiiice"" as I busted out the headshots, I nodded inwardly with satisfaction. Then, I watched Gary as he began, messed up a little, began again with new quarters. Once he got in his groove, I was impressed - he was the first person I've seen as good at HotD as I am, if not a little better for knowing all the tricks. So, with mutual respect forged, we went and sat in the food court, bitched about things of no consequence, the good old days of gaming, stuff people do, that kinda shit. It wasn't a big deal, really, but I do have a new respect for the guy.

Oh, what else? What else... I suppose my life is fairly dull. I've little to report. We went and saw Dreamcatcher over the weekend, that was fairly cool. ""We"" meaning Jon, Neil and I... scratch that, me, Jon and Neil (fuck you, proper grammar). Anyway. We went out for a dinner first (I call them 'fancy' dinners, because you have to sit down, order off a menu, and can't supersize it). Although considering we went to Jungle Jim's, found it full, went to My Brother's Place, full again, and eventually settled on Klondike Jake's... I suppose it wasn't fancy, per se. Heheh. Anyway, it was fun and funny, as usual, with Jon once again experimenting with drinks off the alcoholic beverage menu. You'd think he'd have learned after the martini last time (""Oh God, it tastes like perfume.""). Anyway. He had some kinda mudslide thing that was actually pretty tasty, but probably because it was full of chocolate and whipped cream. Regardless...

Then we saw Dreamcatcher, which was... fucked up. That's how I best describe it. It didn't make a lot of sense at times, but I don't feel obliged to read the book on the off hope it makes more sense. Overall, the evening cost me almost thirty dollars, but it was worth it to get out and have some fun with friends.

I'd like to see Spirited Away when it comes out, too, just 'cause I usually enjoy Miyazaki (even before he went all Disney on us, dammit). My friend Greg told me he wants in if we go to see it. Another story altogether, there.

Anyway. I don't want to divide my attention between this and IRC anymore (IRC looks like such a happy place suddenly). So, baibai."

"event","I'm not long awake. Dripping wet from a shower. Cold and sleepy. I wouldn't call it a good mood. But even flowers grow from dirt. Who's to say?

It's been a long time since I posted in my journal. I don't know why that is. If anything, lately I've been on the greatest emotional high I've had in a long time! But, as I've said before, it seems like my journal only gets hit up in the bad moods. 

Although I'm not in a _bad_ mood, per se. Annoyed, maybe. Annoyed at being tired. Heheh... Anyway. It wasn't even my idea to post. This one goes out to Wendy! Who asked me to do ANOTHER 100 things about me... So. ...here goes. I cannot promise some of them won't be the same, because I don't remember my last 100 very well, and don't have time to cross-reference. ;P

1. I have a horrible memory. If there's an important date, chances are I'll forget it. I don't remember much of my own life, and bomb badly at any sort of trivia game. I just have a nasty memory.
2. I know far too much, on the other hand, about fictional or irrelevant crap that'll probably never do me any good. Do you know the definition of 'psychometry'? I do!
3. I hate to be too hot. Hate hate hate it. I'd much rather be too cold. At least then I can changed into something heavier.
4. Once, I tried to write a novel, when I was about 14. I managed to do about 37 pages in MS Word before I got stuck and lost interest. 
5. On that note, I tend to skip around in my interests a lot, getting caught up in new projects practically every week, and then phasing them out. People rarely take my declarations seriously anymore.
6. I think ""Sluggy Freelance"" is one of the most hilarious things on this planet. ""No, YOU have no honour!"" Superb.
7. I really hate guns. I enjoy them almost as a fetish in video games, but despise the actual devices. Doesn't that screw up the ""Video games lead to violence"" thing? I don't mind 'toy' guns, though. Although I acknowledge they're potentially dangerous... but, so's a baseball bat, in the hands of a psycho.
8. I don't like being ganged up on. I can take some ribbing, some humour at my expense, but as soon as I realize practically everyone around me is making fun of me, I revert to my surly, angry, hateful persona - a la high school. It's a defense mechanism.
9. I don't like big breasts. I've been told that means I'm not a real man. I think it means I'm comfortable enough in my masculinity to enjoy quality over quantity. ^_~
10. ""Be veeeewy veeeeewy quiet. I'm hunting wabbits!"" Bugs Bunny cartoons fill me with glee.
11. I'm prone to headaches and a distressed stomach. I am almost perpetually suffering one or the other - likely because I don't sleep well enough.
12. I love dreams. I love hearing about other people's, and telling them mine. I think it's one of the greatest ways to really hear about someone, and know who they are.
13. I also like to talk about sex with people, in a frank fashion. For pretty much the same reason. Someone's opinions on sex seem to help me really understand and appreciate them. But maybe I'm a lech.
14. I don't get along with my dad very well. We are about as opposite as day and night. I'm night.
15. I love smacking a punching bag around. It's excellent stress relief, as well as good exercise.
16. HTML offends me. It really does! I hate the stuff! No wonder my webpage is on near permanent hiatus..
17. I tend to worry about my cat - particularly what will happen to her when I move away. My parents can't possibly care for her with the patience and understanding she needs. She's a nervous, crazy little thing. I worry.
18. In fact, that's a good one: I worry. I worry about things a lot. Usually, I worry about people.
19. I don't take very good care of myself. I go out in winter without a coat, or even boots. Don't always eat right, and I can be way too lazy. I'm getting better about it, though.
20. I like to draw women. But I don't think it has anything to do with lecherousness or perversion. o_o Women are just more pleasant to draw. Curvier than men. Even female artists tend to feel that way, in my  experience.
21. I would like to play drums. But they're so expensive, loud, and difficult to house that I've never had the opportunity.
22. Almost every teacher in my high school was strange. I could tell stories for hours. Strange, strange people.
23. To me, Masamune Shirow is a god. A little Japanese god, whose domain of power rests in manga and sci-fi. The amount of thought he can put into the simplest of things blows my mind.
24. Presently I can smell bacon. I like bacon. But not crispy. My dad cooks it until it's crunchy. I like bacon chewier. Mmm. Chewy bacon.
25. I tend to think... strangely. I think in associations, and imagery, with this droning hum of raw data in the background that doesn't always make sense, but tends to distract me. This makes me think slowly, as well, which causes me to type much more slowly than I can. Heaven forbid somebody ask me ""What are you thinking?"". If it's not total nonsense, it's probably nothing at all.

On that note, I have been typing much more slowly than I predicted. This list ends at 25, because I need to go to school. Maybe I'll do the other 75 layta. Baibai."

Had my first LAN party on the 30th. It was quite a night. I commented to my friend it was a night to remember, so it should be here, I guess. I'd say it was perfect, except for one horrible flaw - at least in my eyes:

The LAN party itself _sucked_.

But everything else? Funfunfun. My parents were good enough to let me have the jeep overnight. So I packed up my goods, computer and XBox, and we journeyed forth to Kris'. Jon followed us in his car, and there was something fun about that, too. Especially the little races - Jon's car doesn't stand a chance against the jeep, and it's quite fun. Regardless, we picked up Kris' stuff, and with two carloads full of electronics off we went to grab some dinner.

Jon and Kris and I went to Jungle Jim's, and ordered a kitchen sink and two pounds of insanity wings. We should have ordered one. We'd never had them before, but Jon and I swore we'd try them next time we were there. BIG MISTAKE. We should've known when they made us sign liability waivers these things were NAS-TY. But, stupid us, we ate 'em anyway! Well. About five of them. HO-LEE SHIT. Now, I can hold my own against spicy food. Which is why I managed to eat three before I called it quits. Jon ate half of one. And poor Kris, who had only bitten off a tiny bit of one before deciding it was way too hot for him, accidentally picked it up against in place of a normal buffalo wing and devoured the whole thing before he knew what was going on. When he suddenly shrieked ""I ATE THE WRONG ONE!"" and started going all teary eyed, it was all Jon and I could do not to crumple out of the booth laughing. The waitress serving us looking so genuinely concerned for him, and he kept making these funny noises and looking at us with such horror. It was cruel to laugh, but he knew it was funny, and we did too. We all laughed about it later. Since she was so nice, we left that waitress a big tip. I also ordered dessert from Jungle Jim's for the first time ever - we all decided after those wings, we needed some dairy on our ravaged tongues. Next time, we're sticking to the nice, tame, tasty suicide wings.

So then it was off to the LAN party. Which, like I said, sucked. I'm not doing that again for a long time. It was horribly planned. We all brought enough hardware, but nobody planned for software problems. As a result, it turned mostly into a Quake-fest, which was because most of the people there were ""l33t quakers"". I only went under the condition it WOULDN'T be all Quake. Ugh. Also, power supplies weren't considered, and the room we'd commandeered was discovered to be a single circuit room. Not enough for six computers, a hub, and an XBox with TV. Not nearly. We had to run all kinds of extension cords. And in the end, it wasn't exactly fun, I found. Blah. And at 8am, I hauled my sorry ass and my hardware back home, and collapsed into bed.

But prior to that, at about 1 am, we all went out for McDonald's. And that was fun. We were all tired and weird, by then. The drive-through was the only thing open, so we had to go through that. But everybody had debit cards, and thus it was going to be a big hassle to place the order. I refused to do it, as the driver, and told Gary (who was in the driver side rear) he had to. He wouldn't either. So with both people on that side refusing to do it, I came up with the only viable solution.

So we went through the drive through backwards, and Kris placed the order. To our merit, I did go through forward to the window, but when the girl saw us back around the building and turn around so we'd be going straight, she made the funniest face. After much typing of PIN numbers, we had our food and darted on back to the doomed party. I watched Transformers on my computer while I sucked on my milkshake, and was happy, for a time.

But, by 8 am, the thrill was gone. The LAN party sucked, otherwise, and I lost my monitor power cord. I took the one Jordan gave me, because he was the one who'd been nice enough to lose mine. When he finds it, I'll trade back. Anyway. It was a great night, excluding the party itself, which left me drained and grouchy by the time I crumpled into bed at 8:30 or so. I ended up sleeping all day yesterday, and missed any calls that came in (because my father was so nice as to not answer the phone at all). So for new years eve, I sat at home, alone, and did squat. Which was also nicely depressing. 

Basically, the party left me with one dire need - I've got to do something social, because I'm just lonely and depressed as a result of it. Next time we have a LAN party? I'm playing XBox."

"event","And I don't argue with Wendy. Not for very long, anyway. I learn quick like that.

1. I'm deathly afraid of heights.
2. I love cheesy 80s things, especially cartoons.
3. I'm a very messy person. My computer desk is a permanent disaster.
4. There are two Armored Core action figures on display in my room, because I love Armored Core. And action figures.
5. My favourite anime is Bubblegum Crisis. The original. Because it's cheesy, and from the 80s.
6. I draw a lot, but rarely finish anything. That's why I'm bad at feet.
7. Though I know enough to usually fake it, I've played very little Dungeons & Dragons.
8. I like cats. A lot. They're cute.
9. I own more video games than anyone I know, and take them very seriously.
10. I like dark hair better than blonde hair. I regret the 'bleaching' movement of the mid-to-late 90s profusely.
11. At almost any given time, I am suffering a mild to severe headache for some reason or another.
12. Though I have no idea who they are, I have a Children of Bodom wall scroll hung in my room.
13. I respect women profusely, and grow embittered when they trash males as a whole.
14. I am generally bitter anyway.
15. Though I range from dramatic highs to devastating lows, I am not clinically bipolar.
16. I dress all in black. All the time. Except for the occasional dark-grey pair of underwear.
17. I am very good at metaphors and analogies.
18. When I was a child, I almost pulled a fire alarm at a hospital because it read ""In case of fire, pull lever"", and I thought it meant do it as a prevenative measure. For the same reasoning, I would not ride elevators without coaxing.
19. Shallow people who think they're deep bug the piss out of me.
20. I swear. Sometimes a lot.
21. I have never done drugs, never smoked, and only intentionally consumed alcohol on one occasion - when I was six.
22. I have a half brother and a half sister, and we all get along wonderfully.
23. I am studying to be a graphic designer, but I have no solid plans for my future. I want to draw comics.
24. I read a lot of webcomics. Upwards of 25, at least.
25. I love the number 25. Also, the number 99, and the letters X, Z, and K.
26. Metal is my favourite music. But I also listen to anime and video game music on a regular basis.
27. Though I hate hypocrites, I often catch myself doing hypocritical things. Thus, I hate myself. Sometimes.
28. I was proficient in DOS when I was five years old.
29. Poetry, when it is good, can move me deeply. When it is bad, it can make me grouchy.
30. I took martial arts. I know elements of Jeet Kune Do, Tae Kwon Do, kickboxing, and Thai fighting - but not many.
31. 'Bright Eyes' by Blind Guardian is my favourite song.
32. I get mad at people who harass me to do things constantly. Nagging pisses me off.
33. I hate the number 33. Because it ruins 100.
34. Though it surprises many people, I'm very sexually minded - but know when to shut it off.
35. I'm largely unphasable, and can turn myself completely impartial on a whim.
36. My temper is very scary.
37. I once went to Texas to meet an online interest of two years. She dumped me a month after I got home, and was surprised when I was still upset three weeks later.
38. Though I can make myself unphasable, I'm inwardly very sensitive.
39. I've been RPing since I was twelve, and I'm still using the same character.
40. Ask anyone who knows me, and they'll assure you I'm a very, very sarcastic person. Oh yeah, 'cause they're SO smart. Heheh.
41. I giggle. I don't care who says it's not manly. I bloody giggle, and I do it all I want.
42. I know what this number means, even though I never read any of the literature.
43. I can quote any scene from Mel Brooks' Spaceballs almost perfectly. Ask me, I'll prove it.
44. I first 'saw' a girl when I was approximately four, and another girl in my neighbourhood decided to show me. She was caught before coaxing the opposite out of me.
45. My favourite video game in the world is Dead or Alive 3. I want to participate in a large-scale tournament revolving around this game. Just to gague my own skill. As a side note, I am also a big geek.
46. My eyes are light sensitive, and I have been known to wear sunglasses indoors, at night, just to be able to see.
47. Originally I grew my hair long to wear it over one eye, but ironically cannot stand having hair in my face.
48. I have only been in severe trouble at school once, suspended for fighting.
49. Churches make me sick. Not morally or intellectually, but being in them makes me physically ill. I suspect it's the incence.
50. Ice cream is one of my greatest weaknesses.
51. When I was a child, I dreamed of being a starving artist who lived in somebody's attic. Nobody in particular. Just a stranger's attic.
52. I swim like a fish, and love being underwater.
53. HTML and most other computer codes frustrate me. I just can't tolerate staring at them for extended periods.
54. I had epilepsy as a child, and know how scary seizures are.
55. My eyes change colour. Sometimes they're green, sometimes they're brown, sometimes they're both.
56. ICQ irritates the hell out of me, but I use it anyway.
57. Boiled potatoes are the bane of my existance.
58. I like online quizzes, for some reason I cannot isolate.
59. No, I won't draw you a naked chick, or a really cool car. Stop asking me.
60. Guilt trips make me angry. People who guilt me will likely enact the opposite of what they wanted.
61. Smurfs make me shudder.
62. I was infamously good at Killer Instinct Gold, and finished it blindfolded on more than one occasion. Only on the easier difficulties, but I'm only human.
63. Once I had delusions of becoming an engineer, until I realized I hated math too much to consider it.
64. I find bandages, black silk, scarves, chains, leather, and high boots fascinating. Artistically, not sexually.
65. I don't hear very well. I make up for it by translating what I mishear into humourous, often filthy commentary, and repeating it with feigned horror.
66. I get a lot of strange looks. Often going out of my way to get them.
67. Robots fascinate me. Both real and fictional ones.
68. I was a member of the provincial robotics team three years in a row. We won the Canadian nationals in 2000, after disabling two other robots and nearly being disqualified three times.
69. This number makes me giggle. And also wiggle my eyebrows.
70. I rarely sleep as much as my body requires.
71. Often, I have a natural knack for mechanics. I once repaired a VCR on the fly with no previous training whatsoever.
72. I often find myself associated with religious figures despite my lack of faith. I have been known as Moses, God of Video Games and the Technological Jesus. Also, others have termed the car I drive and my computer gods in their own right.
73. Though I find the occasional racist joke funny, I hate racism in its seriousness. Also homophobia and sexism - although I joke frequently about both.
74. I have a very broad sense of humour. Deal with it.
75. I love to make other people laugh. I have considered a career in comedy more than once, but only passingly.
76. I would rather be freezing cold than overheated.
77. My virginity was lost and presumed dead when I was 17 - I haven't decided yet if I regret it or not.
78. Often, I'm an impulse shopper. I frequently buy video games and DVDs spontaneously.
79. Frankly, I'm surprised I got this far, and am surprised you read this far. I really don't find myself that interesting.
80. In case it wasn't made obvious, I hate math passionately - but I'm not as bad at it as I often believe.
81. I worked in photo restoration for about a year. Never trust photographic evidence from me. Ever.
82. Though I can be thoroughly loud, crude, and obnoxious to my friends, I'm usually very shy around strangers - especially girls. And especially pretty ones.
83. By sheer coincidence alone, I have very rarely had interest in girls younger than me.
84. My cousin is a military sniper, but has never killed anybody.
85. Another of my distant cousins was framed for murder and spent about ten years in prison. DNA testing later cleared his name. My sister assures me we now have only two murderers in our family.
86. A personality quiz I took in school informed me my personality resembles that of Albert Einstein, and Adolf Hitler. It disturbs me massively that Hitler and Einstein had the same personality.
87. My high school literature teacher did a kickass T-Rex impression, and once woke me with a prehistoric growl.
88. I hold grudges. A bad trait I cannot shake off.
89. When I was younger, I had a bad case of whooping cough that left me with the bad habit of clearing my throat while I eat. Only one person has ever seemed to notice, however.
90. Once, during a blackout, my friend and I roasted peanuts over a candle.
91. I flirted with a girl once. I don't think she noticed. If she did, she didn't care.
92. When my maternal grandfather died, I was completely unmoved. I hadn't known he was even still alive, and had never met him or heard anything about him. I still feel bad I couldn't show my mother more emotion.
93. Similarly, my dad got mad at me for not crying when our dog died, and really wounded me. Emotionally, I mean.
94. My memory is very horrible most of the time, but I remember pre-school fairly vividly.
95. I can type almost 100wpm, if I don't need to think about what I'm typing - and I've had no formal training whatsoever. Blame IRC.
96. I hate the term 'Canuck' endlessly, and will growl at anyone who dares call me that.
97. Microsoft is okay by me.
98. Nostalgia makes me wildly happy.
99. I once created a company's website entirely in Flash - it took me almost 18 hours of work, because I simply wasn't as good at Flash as I'd been lead to believe.
100. I am morbid and cynical - but oh so fluffy chipper."

and her last kiss, it shall be release.
Oh I can't forget her, her face will not leave.
From the depths of my soul, I long for her.

Caught in the afterlife, I've gone too far.
When sorrow sang softly and sweet.
The air's filled with tears, full of sadness and grief.
When sorrow sang softly, and sweet.</i>

That about sums up my mood. I figured I'd start posting regularly on the journal, at least until I'm done my classes at school, since I probably won't be as frequent to IRC as usual. Alas, once again, it seems that my journal is done unto with my darkest side, as any time I am left along to my thoughts, this spew is what gushes forth. Bah.

This morning's class, pre-press with Ken and Paul (I'd have to say Paul is my favourite teacher), was great. We're done most of our work, and it was largely chatting and laughing with classmates. It was nice to forget about being me for a while, and just be part of the social unit. Drat, that it should end only too soon...

My infatuation is coming to a crippling end, I fear. And yet, I'm glad. But not. I wish I'd never had it to start. I hate it, especially circumstances fathomed. It's... just... not what I wanted. But... Sigh. I just never wanted to let it happen again. I hate my resolve. I never even mentioned anything along the lines to her. I'm sure we'll go on, friends and all - but it's the sort of thing that always sticks with you. Stains, if you will. Beh... Nail in my heart, the thing must be black.

I was so distraught after class ended, I went driving. I stopped by the university, but none of my friends were around. Oh how I wish they had been - how I wish. Chatting, joking, laughing, would've kept my mind silent and my thoughts white. But no.

I've mentioned to some people that I think largely in images and associations. I remember most things by relating it to something more basic, or more intense. But, it sometimes hurts, so much. Some perfectly minor, innocent things get related to the most painful thoughts, and I can no longer bear so much. I struggle, even now, to purify my thoughts, and enjoy some basic things without the agony.

I didn't have a destination when I was driving. I just drove. Eventually I found I was quite far from school, and didn't know for certain exactly where I was. God, what horrible thoughts I had. I broke my old speed record, and brought the Jeep in excess of 170 km/h. At some point, I wondered what excitement I would have by pulling a four-lane U turn at 115 km/h (about 70mph, for the Americans). I was so tempted. I could feel my hands moving. I'm sure I would've been killed. I was pulling all kinds of turns and whipping around corners and whatnot in that last hour... Sometimes, misery seems to overwhelm survival instincts. Surely death could silence the sullen dirge of my thoughts - but, of course, I am far too afraid of it to try. Far.

""Blessed are you. Blessed am I. Children of the night, children of the night."" - Iced Earth

That lyric really hit me, today. It made me feel sort of warm and welcome and comfortable - but not as a 'blessed', but as a child of night. I wonder why I feel such kinship to dark, sometimes. I wouldn't call myself gothy. But death, madness, horror, misery, rage - they excite me so. Sigh. I wonder how, exactly, you define human."

I don't know if that's what my mood kitty should be. It's probably better not to ask. I just am, okay? Just am... Blah. Human nature - why must ye spite me? If that is, in fact, the case. Something spites me. SIGH>

"event","Bahahaha. Techno remixes of old nintendo games? I'm there!

Speaking of remixes of old nintendo games, I bought Metroid Prime over the weekend. So yesterday was curl up in bed day, whilst I guided Samus through her adventures on Tallon IV! Yay!

Anyway. Today I feel kinda sick, but I'm so used to being sick by now, it's barely phasing my mood. I'm sure by the end of the day something will have me moping and feeling crappy, but I decided too many of my journal posts are done when I'm in the negative. All my mood kitties are so sad! I want a happy one once in a while.

Of course, the down side is I don't really have a lot to say. I'm pretty content right now, and when I'm content, I suppose all I want to do is be silly. I have no deep thoughts to share in my present mood. Oh well. Maybe my journal is destined to melancholy. But I'll fight it to the end! 

Sometimes, though, I wonder if I wasn't designed to be depressed. I seem to function more broadly in such a state. Or maybe being depressed releases some kinda hormones or chemicals or something. Damnable hormones, forever ruling my life! 

Or something. Bwaha!"

"event","Blah. Had fish for lunch. Not my favourite. At least I'm not hungry.

I'm full of sighs today. I feel like I'm back in high school. Back then, whenever I was alone, I would begin to _think_. I dread thinking. I always seem to question my worth and other such depressing things and make myself miserable. I don't think this will be a long post.

So. Today, I've made myself miserable. Days like this, I actually feel as gothy as people think I am. I just don't know what good I'm doing with my existence. I don't feel terribly content, sometimes. I have no REAL sense of direction in life. I hate so many things about me - my appearance, my habits, sometimes my hobbies. I hate the way some people just sort of 'look' at me. Sometimes I wonder if I just gave up all my 'geeky' pleasures, chopped off my 'tail and started wearing colour, would I be happier? Or would I just be a loser amongst new people?

I think my recent infatuation may have an impact on me, too. I mean, y'know? When you're excited by someone else, I guess you start to worry about your faults. I don't think I want to become another baseball-cap-wearing, beer-guzzling, womanizing sunuvabitch like so many guys I know. I do take some sort of odd pleasure in my uniqueness. But why does it seem to cause me so much ache? I hate, hate to ache.

Sigh. That's about all of reading my own thoughts I can tolerate right now. We'll call it a quickie. Done."

"event","I'm some kinda mental. Last night I decided, despite my bitching about it yesterday, that I was going to stay up until 2:00 am AGAIN. I'm so tired, and headachy. Ugh. Hate it.

Not a long post today. Just a few things to mutter about and a link. 

Now, what was I going to mutter about? Let's see. Well. I had some things I wanted to bitch about, but really, they just don't seem that important now. I'm in one of those hazy moods where my priorities all change. Heh. Oh well, uhm... in better news, my parents are going away for two weeks at the beginning of next month. That sounds mean, but I'm just looking forward to getting the house and the car largely to myself. Of course, my aunt will be there *grumble* but on the bright side, she'll handle things like feeding the dogs and so forth. And since she doesn't have a liscence and rarely goes anywhere, the car is mine! Mwaha. Except I have no money to pay for gas, so... yeah. I'll deal.

What else? Hm. Not a lot, I suppose. Yet far, this day has been most uneventful. Well then on to the link, I suppose.

I don't know how many people read this journal (I know at least one who reads it regularly, har), but since I've mentioned it to very few people, I'd guess not many. Oh well. Anyway, last week or so my friend sent me one of those 'quiz your friends' things. I suspect it was an attempt to make me seem like I didn't know how deep and multifaceted he was - I got eight out of ten questions. Jeez. ;P Anyway. I decided to make one about me. Because I didn't wanna go about e-mailing it to everybody as he had, I figure I'll post it here.

<a href=""http://www01.quizyourfriends.com/yourquiz.php?quizname=021108233433-Suffer~p20the~p20enigma~p20that~p20is~p20I."">Suffer the enigma that is I.</a>

Anyone who reads this journal is probably at least interested enough to do he first couple of questions. *grins* I don't expect many people to be able to score higher than five or six out of ten. I'm not exactly 'secretive', but I've got a lot of things that are more exposed to certain people than others. Maybe a couple of my closest friends could score well. Maybe. Har. Anyway. Have fun."

"event","Woot. I sat down at this computer and realized I didn't have any of my CDs with me. I was upset until I remembered my discman in my bag. It hasn't been used in months, because the batteries are dead and I keep forgettign to recharge them. But I popped it open and found, low and behold, my Abyss Angst Mix. It's basically a collection of angry or depressing songs I compiled on a CD to moderate my mood towards working on my comic, 'Abyss'. But right now, I'm happy just to have found it. Teehee.

Anyway. I haven't written in my journal for a while. Been very busy, and also very sick with flu. As a result, I'm sure I have a lot of things to write about here today. So if you don't like to read a lot, I'd advise you turn off your monitor now. That won't really help that much, but it amuses me to imagine people doing it. In any case. Long post: you've been warned.

So mostly I figure I'll go on about today, and some recent thoughts. Of course, to go on about today, I really need to start with yesterday. In particular, my art class.

On my way to my art class, I dropped into EB, because I'd heard Phantom Crash was out. So I grabbed a fistful of cash on my way out the door - nothing like a good mecha combat game to get the blood going! I wandered around the mall briefly, mostly looking for a friend of mine who works there. Oh well. Didn't find him, so socially unfulfilled, I went to reaffirm my geekiness at Electronic Boutique. 

While I was there I figured I may as well wander around and see what they had in for used games/the store's incoming releases. The sorts of things I CAN'T find from my computer, and thus must actually go into society for. Or call for. But I hate the phone intensely. Anyway, the point is, when I was there, these two girls came up by me (oh yeah, they say, here he goes). I spared a glance and went back to the games. But I had to do a double take. One of them was short. Long, brown hair. A frumpy grey shirt. And she was carrying a _sketchbook_. The same kind I use, in fact. I could tell by the tag on it that it was used, but not mistreated. And she was looking at video games. I could have swooned. Alas, I could only see her back (I'm sure she would've had glasses. Damn, I love girls in glasses). And rather than crane my neck trying to see her, I again returned to the games. But I wasn't thinking about them anymore. I was thinking of things like saying hi. Asking about the sketchbook. Waiting there dumbly until I could see this wonderful rarity. But, I was reminded of the belief that gamer guys are all morons who go crazy over any girl in a game store. Which, alas, is moderately true. I did not want to perpetuate it in this girl, however. And, of course, I'm so horribly shy, full of self doubt. Sure I would have only received rolled eyes or a brush off, I grabbed Phantom Crash, bantered briefly with the clerk (who I'm sure recognizes me at least vaguely by now) and left. Glancing back over my shoulder at the girl with the sketchbook. I never did see her face. Damn it. Damn me.

So I went to art class. This is where this entry gets really melodramatic. Our assignment for the evening was to wander around the building and draw sketches of things we saw, and then go back to the gallery and combine the elements into a single composition. He told us to gather up a piece of cardboard backing, some paper, clips and pencils, and go. Of course, I always carry around my clipboard and a pencil, so, I darted off and set to work. I was scribbling away, making faster and faster sketches as I darted around the building. I must've circled the place three or four times at least. I found I was beginning to find some artistic value in everything. Although I began by drawing the artistic displays about the building, as the teacher instructed, I soon was scribbling down whatever looked appealing. By the time I was done my composition had a megaphone, a wall clock, a chair, and a 'wet floor' sign, in addition to whatever else. I was a drawing fiend, I tell you. At one point the instructor, who had been observing me for a time, jested that I reminded him of a comedy skit. ""Awright you, 1... 2... 3... draw!"" *scribblescribble*. It was true. I wasn't even bothering to sit down anymore. Just running around with my board in one hand, scribbling down an image in no more than a minute before taking off to find something new.

Now, most people say humans (or at least, people) are the hardest thing to draw. I'm the opposite. I find them the easiest, and the most beautiful. So I couldn't resist when I saw one of my classmates sat on a ledge, drawing something. It was a definetely picture perfect scene. So I scribbled her down and off I went. I also got the instructor on my paper before I was done. But anyway. Later, I mentioned offhandedly I'd drawn her. She laughed and said ""really?"" and asked to see. She seemed delighted. It reminded me how nice people can be. Makes me wish I'd talked to the girl in EB. Oh well.

Anyway. Class taught me something last night I didn't expect. It taught me that I do, in fact, have at least the beginnings of an artist's soul. I've always worried that focusing on anime had stunted my ability to appreciate art as a whole. But looking at all the exhibits, analyzing the artistic worth of plain objects, and so forth, I found I really enjoyed it all. I was delighted.

So I went home. I ripped open Phantom Crash and played a while. Cool game. Very Jet Set Radio, but also Armored Core. With RPG elements. Very cool game. So I played that for an hour and a half, then hopped on my computer until a little after midnight. Realizing how late it was, I went to bed. Alas, my fatal mistake was then: ""It's not THAT late. I can afford fifteen minutes of Phantom Crash."" An hour and a half later I forced myself to save my game and turn off my XBox. Good god, it was 2 am! I went to sleep.

And woke up five hours later feeling like (pardon my French) total shit. I'm still fighting off a flu, after all. Five hours doesn't cut it. Especially since I was online until 2:00 the night before. Nope. Doesn't cut it. And to make matters worse, I overheard my mom screaming hysterically at my dad. While usually that would make me cheer inwardly, because I'm sure my dad did something to deserve it (he's not cruel or abusive, he just tends to rub people the wrong way sometimes. Scratch that, a lot of the times). But it also meant she was in a bad mood, and wasn't too receptive to chatter on the drive to school. I like to banter with Mom, especially about funny things on the radio. It surprised me to find how easily we get along. Oh well. Another day.

So the day begins. School was fine until math. Evil, evil math. We had to watch a boring video. Almost immediately after it was finished, the fire alarm goes off. And it's RAINING out. I don't own a jacket, dammit! I don't have time for fire drills! So we had to stand for fifteen minutes in the rain. That didn't help my flu either, I'm certain. Any-freakin-way. It turns out there was a small fire, so I suppose forgiveness is due. Somewhere. After that, I decided to skip the second half of math class to get some hot food in the cafeteria. The food sucked. Again. Blah.

In the cafeteria I saw this girl who's REALLY familiar. In fact, I'm almost certain I know exactly who she is. But we only met once, and I feel weird about her - should I say hi? She always looks at me with this look of vague familiarity. I wonder if she just can't remember me and is embarassed, or just doesn't like me? Though, thinking about it now, we got along splendidly when we did meet. She's the close friend of a friend of mine. I think next time I see her, I should ask. It would be cool to know somebody around the school besides nameless faces I remember from high school and people in the graphics department. 

So that brings me pretty much up to the present. But I had more things I wanted to blab about. Oh yes. This post isn't over. Sorry.

I'll get the big one off my chest. Despite my seemingly endless chatter about the girls around me, I think I'm developing a particular infatuation for a someone. Which sort of pisses me off, actually. >_< Just because I promised myself I wouldn't let myself do it anymore. Is it really worth all the angst in the end? Maybe. I don't know. But, geh. Oh well.

In brighter news, my previously top secret project, Aftershock, is going into 'beta testing'. A few people have expressed their interest in playing. Aftershock is, for the masses unfamiliar, a post apocalypse version of Earth - a world I created for use in FFRP (free form role play). I'm interested to see how it turns out.

Also, the colouring book I was hired to draw is complete, I think. Barring any additional changes from the clients. If they ask me to make any more BIG changes, they're dead. Dead, I tell you. Bah.

I think I had some more things. General speculations on people I don't like and things about people in general that I don't like. Oh well. Right now, I have to go and see about leaving school early - I have a project I want to work on and Photoshop doesn't run on this computer. Shitty. Oh well. Anyway. This is Brian, signing off. Or some crap.

Damn me."

"event","I woke up this morning so horribly confused and exhausted. My mom wanted to leave early, my dad wanted me to do all these chores, all whilst I got ready faster than usual to get out the door. Woke up late, too, and took forever to fall asleep. Gawd. What a shaft.

So I got to school. First class: page layout. Three hours of it. I slept through at least 30 minutes, in intermittant spurts. I'm fairly certain I'm the reason we got a break (specifically, a coffee break), when Ken saw me nodding off over and over. Not to mention facing the wrong way. I kept waking up to check my watch, try and figure out what was going on, and inevitably falling asleep again.

So then I decided to ram as much into me as I could to wake up. I marched to the cafeteria to stifle my needs: hunger, thirst, and fatigue. To remedy each, I purchased a danish, a milk, and a cappuchino. I felt like I was a glutton, because it looked like a lot of food, even though mostly it was just liquid. 'ehn. If I don't eat when I drink coffee, I get a stomach ache. And if I don't drink, I get thirstier. So it was the only viable solution. It didn't really wake me, though, so I bought a gatorade. That helped. I at least learned some things after the break. Ladeda.

My body still feels worn and tired. My eyes ache, and my blinks last extra long. But all the sugar has my mind racing. In particular, my class had me thinking about this journal. Which led me to think about why I used to despise these online journals to start with.

It actually has to do with a certain person, who would constantly tell us we should go, read his journal, and give him feedback on his problems. Then get mad and say we didn't care about him when we wouldn't. Bah. If someone wants to read your inner thoughts, they'll do it unprompted. It always just turned into a big argument anyway. A 'debate' as he put it. Bah. Argument.

One particular event that made me grind my teeth was the argument about his infamous 'list'. The qualities of his perfect girl. He always complained about girls not living up to his standards. Christ almighty, you should've seen this list. Things like she must be perfectly pure in every way. Her hair colour, general height and weight, her hobbies, personalities, her goddamn religion! And if she wasn't all of these things, he could not bear to accept her presence. Blah.

But it has got me thinking about my own 'list'. I've never really shared it in full detail. It makes me feel like a hypocrite, but I've got my own perfect girl in mind. Well, perfect isn't true. I have a lot of variables, actually.
So now, Hypocricy Productions presents... Pharris Tergor's (Approximately) Perfect Girl!

<i>Curtains open. Audience coughs, unimpressed.</i>

Yeah, well. Let's see. I feel like I should have this all scribbled down somewhere, if only to get it off my chest. Not to mention my memory is horrible. I might forget it all. *grin*

What do I want in a girl? I've only got three physical requirements. I don't think I could handle an 'extreme' weight. That's very mean of me, but it's true. And it's vain of me. I know I'm far from pretty, I confess! But it's true. I couldn't handle a girl who looked like a neckless beachball with legs. But nor could I handle a girl so scrawny she looks fragile - the sort whose figure is defined by bones rather than flesh. I don't think that's unreasonable, frankly. No Ally McBeal, no Rita McNeil. Ha, I'm funny. But not.
What else? Hum. She'd have to be no taller than me. In fact, the shorter the better. For some reason, I'm quietly bothered by people taller than me. I don't understand it. I hate feeling short. I'm six feet tall, so it's rarely an issue. And in some cases it doesn't apply - my father and brother, for example, are both taller than me. But I'm used to that. They've always been taller. Now that I'm nearly their height, I feel ecstatic. My friend Sean, however, is considerably taller than me. He can also be a jerk. So, I don't like the feeling he looks down on me. Makes me want to trip him. 
I guess really, I don't want to look down on my near-perfect girl, but rather, I want to have the feeling I can be strong and protective over her. That sounds chauvenistic. But I really, really like to feel that I can just curl around someone and protect them from all the harsh realities. I'm on a tangent. Maybe I just don't like lifting my head. Anyway. I like short girls. That's what I'm talking about.
I had three, right? Okay. She needs hair. That's all I ask there. I love hair. It's the first thing I look at on a girl. I'm not terribly picky on its length, its colour, anything like that. But I love hair. It can really define a person, I find. I might catch myself thinking about one particularly interesting hair style for days. Sinead O'Connor, in short, is not my dream girl.

So. An average figure'd short girl with hair. That's what I'd like to see every day. Well. I see those every day. But I mean... you know. Or something. *points to his groggy kitty in explanation* I should be typing this when I'm more alert. God I ramble.

What else? Hm. More important to me is her personality and mind and habits and hobbies. I'll admit, I'm kind of picky there. Let's see...
I don't care if she drinks and smokes (though I'd really prefer not, especially the smoking). That's her business, you know? Though I hate the taste of alcohol and the smell of ash. So. That'd make intimacy revolve on an inverse schedule with such things. As for the more, shall we say, ILLEGAL indulgances, well... I don't know how well I'd deal with it. Hopefully won't have to. Ever.

Humour. Humour is vastly important to me. If I can't whip off a few zingers, crack jokes, be sarcastic, tease, jest, and so forth with someone, I can't be comfortable with them. I've always considered that one huge obstacle between my father and I. He doesn't really laugh a lot. When he does, it means a lot to me. I've always found my mother and I a lot closer on that front. She even likes the Holy Grail! My mom is cool. Bah, I'm on a tangent again. In closing, humour = good.

I don't like... girly girls. That doesn't mean I want some belching, harley riding butch who smashes beer cans on her forehead. But I don't like... ""Ohmigawd, did you see what he's WEARING? I would just DIE."" Y'know? Pink and frilly? I don't know how to describe it, really. I'm inclined to say 'average'. Someone who can sit down with a bunch of guys and get along perfectly fine, but retain the undeniable truth she is, in fact, feminine. The occasional belch is hardly a crime, mind you. I'm nineteen and my friends and I still burp crudely at each other. *grin* So, what am I saying? I'm not sure. A girl who's... sort of... guyish. But feminine. Does that exist? I think so. A girl who can watch Dead or Alive 3 and say ""Jeez, how does she WALK with those knockers?"" rather than ""I can't believe you play this, guys are pigs."" Heh. Maybe I'm just insane.

But that leads me to something really, really important to me. I have a really bad ego, in most respects. I have all the self esteem of a shoe. So in trying to define a perfect woman, I think more about her ability to accept what I consider my 'faults'. Or rather, accept me for me. I don't want someone who's out to change me from a social reject geek into Joe Average or Mr. Cool. I like being a social reject geek. I like to play video games. Watch cartoons. Role play, MUD, draw anime. Act stupid with my friends WITHOUT alcohol. Listen to obscure music, from power metal to bouncy dancy techno. Wear black and baby talk to my cat. I don't expect a girl to sit down and PLAY those games, to role play with me, or dance to my music (though if she did that would be awesome! ^_^). But just accept that's the things I do. Some of my friends often go out with girls who go on about how stupid video games are, how geeky RP is, how much this music or that music sucks, and so forth. I wouldn't be able to bear it. Those things define me. 

So, let's do a tally so I can keep this all straight.
Short, average girl with hair.
Must like to laugh, not be frustratingly girly, and like me for me. What else was there? Oh, yes.

I like someone deep. Deep and intelligent. Someone I can sit down and have a long, fulfilling conversation with. Someone who can listen to some obscure ballad I've got tucked away on my drive and be moved by it. Who can voice emotions and explore feelings powerfully. Someone who can experience the world in such an array of sentiments, a vast spectrum of awarenesses, that they can see the darks and lights and their complicated interplay, and inquire as to if it is beautiful or hideous. 

Someone who is both strong to reality, and quietly vulnerable. I find that... vastly alluring. Because it is much like myself. Why, exactly? I do not know. A person with quiet pain captures my heart more powerfully than anything else I've mentioned here. That's not to say I want someone depressed and hurt - but rather, I want someone who can take that hurt and reach out to me with it. I ache, always, to feel important and useful and needed to other people. The person who had the greatest fraction of my affection would, simply put, have to need me. As much as I would need them. Because... when two people _need_ each other to be happy, it makes them two parts of the same whole. Two puzzle pieces that, while perhaps not fitting <i>perfectly</i>, nonetheless fill the holes in one another. 

So... I don't know why I've typed all this. But it feels good to have it all down. So it's not just bouncing around aimlessly in my mind. Reading over it all, I do feel hypocritical, and selfish. But I suppose it's just another one of those reasons I'm single. That and being so anti-social. Not that I hate people. I just don't go out of my way to be around them, usually. Maybe I'm just lazy or something. Oh well...

What do I have to offer anybody, exactly? I don't know. Not a lot, I guess. I don't imagine there's a lot of women who both fit this profile, and find me befitting their own glorious desires. It's all hormones anyway. Fuck you, hormones! Gleh. Heh. Anyway. I've little else to ramble on about, now, I suppose.

Beautiful. I'm in the computer lab at school. Drinking that apple juice yesterday is really haunting me now (for those who don't know me, apple juice makes me really sick). Alas, not enough that it warrants me staying home. So I have to sit at school with stomach cramps and nausea. Hence my crappy kitty. Also, I was promised a snow storm overnight. Which was not delivered! Damnable... I hope Friday is a holiday.

I'm not entirely sure what I had intended to say here. I just feel rather obliged to prattle away in this journal ever since a certain someone showed me their value. Yesterday I delivered a present both in thanks and in literary awe. Heh. Good deeds done.

Another road to the House of Nevermore.
I still remember the curse and the sting of your kiss.
Don't cry for mercy, you know that's one thing I'll never give...
I'll never give.

Sweet angel of deceit, come dance with me.
With your heart as black as the moonless night.
Sweet angel of deceit, come dance with me.
Nail me to your cross and let me cry.</i>

What a fantastic song. It does improve my mood just to sit and listen to it. I love Cornerstone.

<i>Always remember, some love leads to the House of Nevermore...
...so close the door!</i>

It really inspires me to draw. And to write. Maybe I should listen to this song while I struggle to come up with comics. It seems so bleak, but full of quiet, real, human hopes.

<i>Sweet angel of the streets come and rescue me,
from a night as black as a moonless night.
Sweet angel of the streets come and rescue me.
You carried my cross and I let you down...
I let you down,
I let you down...

If I take the road to the House of Nevermore,
who will be waiting to open up the door?
I fall asleep, in the House of Nevermore.
If I should wake, will I find...
Will I find the door?</i>

Swoon. Another song begins. 

Yesterday, in my art class, we were to draw a still life. But first, we had to create thumbnails and decide what perspective, what objects, what size, blahblahblah, we were going to use. I had the usual thumbs, until my last one. Which was angled slightly oddly, with two opposing corners shaded with a curved gradient, and the shadows all very intense with details minimal. So, my teacher, all professional artist, comes over and asks ""and what's going on here?"" in that quiet, artist-to-student sort of way.

""I was looking at it with my head tilted and only one eye half open,"" I replied, without looking up. Then I glanced at him when he jerked back, and his face screwed up with surprise. I was embarassed for a second, because obviously I was being weird. Then he laughed and said ""Well, go for it."" After that, he kept coming back and talking to me. We had a chat about where I wanted to go with art, traditional animation versus computer, and how his father was into Batman and Spiderman. It was really cool. I like to speak to other artists, especially one so well established, with all pretensions aside. 

Last night, I had this really weird dream. I was in a hallway, and I think it was my old high school. It was only lit by the light coming from this room up ahead, but I wasn't walking. I was just standing. And there was this girl in front of me. She was short, and had long, red-brown hair. But no face. I guess I'm typical guy, because she was also 'disrobed', as you would. But her body was in my peripheral vision, which was large and blurry. Tunnel visioned. I kept peering at her face, trying to see details, but there was none. Her face was just completely smooth. And I loved her. It was so strange. Usually my dreams I'm aware of as dreams. Constant nagging sense of ""it's not real"", leaving me somewhat detached from everything. But it was this earnest welling up in my chest. I could still feel it when I woke up, which was resultant of my cat biting me. Pesky critter. I think she kept me up all night with her snuggling and nipping. Oh well. She's so cute.

Huhm. I guess I don't have a lot more to report. I think the next class must be coming in anyway, so I should probably abandon my computer to someone else. I thought we were in here, though. So maybe I'll just end up on java IRC. I'm such a sneak."

"event","All I wanted for lunch was soup. Really. But as I walked away I noticed they had (O Glory, Gloriosa!) mozza sticks! MOZZA STICKS! Cheeeese on the inside, horribly friiiied on the outside. One of my greatest culinary weaknesses. But, alas, all they would allow me to do was order the sticks in a basket with other food. I ended up spending four times what I'd intended for three times as much food! More even! At least it had shrimp and chicken in it, but gawd. No supper for me today. In fact, I even had to throw out most of the fries. Which, really, was okay, I guess. The fries in our school cafeteria kind of suck. Plus, I get a sort of guilty pleasure when I throw out food. Why? Good question!

I never used to have any problem with food going to waste. I'd yell at people who'd throw out their sandwich and complain they were hungry, of course, but otherwise, big deal. So you're full and half a sandwich goes to waste. My ex was in fact the one who put this notion of using all food in my head. And despite the fact we've been broken up well over a year now, it's always stuck with me.

In fact, I find myself lately thinking a lot about that defunct relationship. It's not like I count on getting back together with her, and I'm sure I'm over it. But it's sort of like... you know when you'd make those little play-doh men (was that just me?) by making a ball of dough, and then sticking a body on it? The sphere was as perfect as little hands can make it. And then, you stuck on the body. Which more often than not, fell off. But it always left that spot on the sphere were something should be. And short of remolding the ball, there was no way to get it back to perfect.

Sort of the same deal. I think I just miss having someone 'significant', as they put it. Someone you can tell all your secrets to. Who you can curl up to in front of a TV - laughing at stupid things, like cartoons and 70s sitcoms. Someone warm who's just there for you. I know a part of me largely misses the close _physical_ interactions, but more than that, it's just... like this void, where a best friend belongs.

I know I've got a handful of really, truly close good friends. And I thank my luck I have them just about every day. But it's not the same. I think any one of them would understand that. It's nice to just curl up close to someone, and share private things in quiet murmurs, to tease and chide and know in the end you'll be as close or closer for it. 

What I really miss most of all, I think, is someone who accepted me for all the faults that make me cringe from myself. I'm a big video game addict, I confess. I'm not athletic by any means, and even less now that my friends and I see each other so rarely (note to self: buy basketball!). I watch cartoons (not just anime, but cartoons of all flavour!). And I draw busty anime women all the time. Yes, I admit it! I LIKE to draw big chested women. Also small chested women. And short women, tall women, cute ones, angry ones, all sorts. I just think women are pretty. Can you blame me? They are.

What was I going on about, anyway? Ah, I lament, endlessly. I had something to end that on, but it's gone. Oh well.

<Edit!> With added time to think about it, there was one thing I was thinking of...
Sometimes, I really wish I could be like so many of the other guys I know. I know plenty of people who go through girlfriends like sneakers. Even one or two who do it not out of affection but the simple need to have a girlfriend. Some days, I really wish I was like that. To view it all as something so simply necessary as milk in the fridge. Bah. But no, that's not how I am, is it? I feel relationships are important, and should really mean something deep and powerful. Not something you dash into. And I don't believe in beginning a relationship with a stranger. This ""I have a new girlfriend I just met"" crap doesn't fly with me. If you can't be a friend with your potential partner, then how can you ever love them? </edit!>

Though that little tirade really did remind me of something else. Sometimes, I feel really stupid for how important I feel video games are to me. I have more games than anyone I know. But I love it. Like role play, it's a chance for me to roam a world far more interesting than my own. What's wrong with that, anyway? Meh.

There's a girl in my school (I just saw her walk by, which reminds me of this), that did something really nice for me. She didn't realize it. Let me explain. My sketchbook has a cover. A very bland cover - or it was, until I drew on it. It now sports the profile of some random anime woman (it was to be Lotus, but didn't turn out), and then along the bottom has super-deformed (or chibi, or kawaii, or baby-style, what have you) renditions of a number of my other characters. Lotus, Shikei, Zayken, Deroth, Synna, and most importantly to this story, Pharris. So, yeah. This girl sees my book and is chittering gleefully over the cute little people at the bottom. She picks out Pharris in particular and dubs him ""shady little dude"" and goes on about how cute he is. Cute and shady. It made me laugh.

More importantly, later on, when I saw her again, she pointed to my book and went ""shady little dude! So cute!"" and continues to make references to shady little dude. It just reminds me that I can make an impression that lasts in someone else's mind, which in a lot of ways really means a lot to me. I'd rather be known than wealthy. The fact that people can set aside a part of their memory for me makes me feel gushy. Any time someone recognizes me, especially if I barely know them, I feel this little spark of importance that keeps me going. I revel in it, really. Some day I'd like to be known for something - hopefully my talents, and not some gargantuan fuck up on my part.

Class time now."

"event","No, not that sort of quickie, you perverse sickos! Or... yah. I donno why I'm pluralizing. At this point I only know one person who's even aware of this journal and I wouldn't dare call her a perverse sicko. Not like me. I'm so wrong in the head. *grin*

I just got out of my post production class. For those unfamiliar with the wonders of post production, it's the class where we learn to glue, staple, and otherwise bind the products we put to press (books and notepads and so forth). I spent an hour or so stapling exercise books, and it was boooooring. It IS fun to chatter with my classmates, though. When I'm making people laugh I feel great.

My little mood kitty, as some may see, depicts me as excited. My next class is math, which I hate, so obviously, that's not why I'm excited. For my dad's birthday, my present for him was a novel. Of course, as soon as he picked it up the cover fell off. There was this moment of quiet before I suddenly realized, hey, I'm in post press. ""I'll fix it!"" I said, with no idea how to go about it.

Thankfully, Paul to the rescue, and he made the book good as new. I even shrink wrapped it for added effect. I can't wait to show it to my dad. I don't consider he and I close by any means, but I know he appreciates little things. Maybe it'll make him smile.

I've been doing a lot of thought lately about relationships. I don't know why, exactly. Mostly, reviewing my failed one. I jsut keep going over it in my head thinking ""she was so great, why did I ever let her get away?"" Really makes you feel stupid. But maybe I should save it for a later journal post. 

And just thinkign about it now, makes me feel like I should change my mood kitty."

"event","Okay, so I'm a big hypocrite. I always talked about how much I hated these online journals because they're... oh, how to say it? They regurgitate inner sentiments all over a page in efforts to either seem deep or fish for sympathy. I hate people who run around saying ""Look at my life journal! Go see how much I hate the world today! LOLOLOL, I really hate everyone today! Go see!"" Like... die. Ahem.

But, a certain someone (who will remain nameless, and is aware of their own identity) had a particularly interesting journal that made me sit, read it all, and go ""wow"", without any request to do so. And, I suppose they could be theraputic, and a good place to say what needs saying. All that, uh, said (redundancy ho!), I suppose I should... say something.

So. I'm Brian. I prefer Bri. Everyone cool calls me Bri. Well, that's not to say calling me Bri makes you cool. Pardon me, I fly into tangents. Most of the time I'm Pharris. I like that better again. 

Because, and I feel it's important to get this defined right up front, I'm something of a dual personality. Sometimes I think it's amazing I haven't developed a complex. It really depends a lot on my surroundings, my situation, and my company. Sometimes I'm quiet, polite, sheepish, and fidgety. I'd rather sit and draw and avoid eye contact than say a word.

And then, when I'm comfortable, I'm chatty, full of jokes, and overall fairly social. 

You know, I have more 'personalities' than that, even. Because when I'm with my close, real life friends, I can get loud and wild, sarcastic and crude and just off the wall. Just because, usually, that's how we are when we all get together. We're good people, we're just a bit insane.

And, I must confess, when presented with someone who can contest with myself, I can be a real pervert too. I've got more lewd jokes in my filthy mind than I dare consider - but, of course, this is another aspect of me that appears purely based on the audience. I've had people sincerely surprised by how filthy minded I can be. It usually surprises me they didn't expect it. Oh well. I guess my mind is sort of like that. Nice to visit, strange to live in. Too many windows painted black.

Once, my dad called me a vampire. And I thought that was the greatest compliment he'd ever paid me. Just because it meant he'd noticed who I was. I think I'm weird."

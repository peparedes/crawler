He wanted me to go with him to some cemeteries and take pictures.  So we went to the Norton Cemetery and took some pics.  Then we went to Food City so I could see Jane then by Dad's CDs and then to UVA-Wise.  He took me on a little tour of the campus.  That place is huge.  They have a lake put in there and shit and it's just huge.  I was surprised at it's size. 

Then we went to Cavalier Comics where Steve spent a little money then we went back to Cam's house and played Grand Theft Auto 3 ... for about five hours.  I love that game.  It was quite fun.  I can't wait to get a Playstation 2 so I can play it and stuff.  Yeah.

I got home around 11 last night.  I left yesterday around 1 or 1:30.  So, yeah, it was a fun day off spent not in the house.

You think it's hard to live with me,
But how easy do you think I have it?
You can't believe all I have done,
But how easy do you think I have it?
You don't understand why I am this way,
But I cannot justify it either.
You cry because of all the things I've done.
How easy do you think it is for me to sleep
When I see the faces of the ones I have hurt
And I know that I did it; that it's all my fault?!

I don't like being singled out and ridiculed.
I don't like all the pain that I have put you through.
And I know I am sick of being ashamed!

<i>I am the one that has to live with the choices.
I am the one that must repay every misdeed.
I am the one that has to fight to sleep at night.
I am the one who has to deal with all the tears.
I am the one who will not run away from what he's done.
I have hurt; I am hurting. I won't not be ashamed!</i>

""I'm sick of being ashamed. I don't mind being dejected and rejected, but I'm not going to be ashamed about it. At least pain is real. I mean, you look around and you see nothing is real, but at least the pain is real.""

I'm sick of being ashamed
I'm sick of hanging my head
I'm sick of living in fear
I'm sick of finding tears
I'm tired of being dejected
I'm tired of being rejected
I'm tired of being sad
I'm tired of being ashamed
Nothing is real
Nothing is real
Nothing is real
But all the pain ...

At least the pain is real!

<i>I am the one that has to live with the choices.
I am the one that must repay every misdeed.
I am the one that has to fight to sleep at night.
I am the one who has to deal with all the tears.
I am the one who will not run away from what he's done.
I have hurt; I am hurting. I won't not be ashamed!</i>

I am not asking for any pity
Nor am I asking for understanding.
I realize that I've caused others pain
And I don't expect your empathy.
But I do expect you to realize
That I do understand what I have done
And that I am sorry, sorry for it all.
That I am sorry, sorry for everything,
Because, if it's the last thing that I do,
I swear to God that I will clear my name!

I don't like being singled out and ridiculed.
I don't like all the pain that I have been put through.
And I know I am sick of being ashamed!

I will no longer be ashamed!
I will not falter in this life!
I've got to repay you for my faults
And fix all of my flaws!
I may stumble in this face of adversity
But I will not be ashamed because of it
I'm sick of being ashamed
I'm sick of everything
I'm sick of nothing but shame
I will no longer be ashamed!"

I want to lay next to you in the morning

We'd lay together and talk about nothing,

I'll supply the bed and the house.
You bring your body and problems
And we'll lay in bed together
Watching the sun come up at five.

<i>So many things so many people take for granted.
So many times we've spent not cherishing what we have.

We spend so much time worrying about nothing,
We don't realize that heaven is the place where our eyes wish we could be.
We have spent so much time bickering and fighting
That we have yet to realize that our time together is so precious.
We spent our days stressed to the point of argument,
We didn't realize that no matter how far the other is, we're there.

We're there!
In spirit, we're there.
We're there!
In love, we're there.
We're there!
In spirit, we're there.

Close your eyes and you will see the darkness around you.
I close my eyes and I see my life laid before me.
It's passing before me in memories
Clips from a life I once had and once lived
Scenes from a life I'll never have again
And there aren't many things I don't regret.
Not many things I wouldn't take back
Except telling you how much I felt for you.
There aren't many things I wouldn't want to do over,
Except the first time we met, kissed, and made love.
Nothing would I change about all those,
because they were points in my life that will always matter.
And nothing in my life from now on will change that I miss you
And nothing in my life with change that I am not the same without you

It's not your fault that you feel this way.
It's not my fault that I can't change you.
It's no one's fault, but just a falter in judgement.
And I wish that I could change all of your decisions.
I wish I could fix it so that we'd be together again.
So that, when I open my eyes,
I see the same thing when I close them:
You here with me, you in my arms,
So wrapped up in our lives.
And I wish you were here ...

Watched my life flicker away,
I stood at a distance so I wouldn't burn.
How is it possible that a life so untouched
Could be engulfed by flames because of one mistake?
I try to wipe away the burns, but they rise and blister;
Nothing can heal the charred memories left in my mind.
I lived through the fire,
But I can't make it through the night.
I have a hard time dealing with the man I see in the mirror;
I can't distinguish where I end and the scars begin,
So, I often wonder if there is even a difference anymore.
Have the scars taken over my life?
Have I allowed them to rule my mind too long?
How can I fight back against something that's no longer there?
What do I do now that my life has become a third degree ruin?

Watch the shadows dance across the walls,
I stand, submerged in the darkness, now that the candle has burnt out.
The fires have subsided, the flames have extinguished,
Still the pain sieges my days and my mind;
I pick at the wounds, skin tough and rigid, the scars will remain.
I can't heal them, I can't change what is in the past;
The past causes me to dred the future.
Fear of what will come, fear of history repeating;
Fear of all that has been will be again.
I lived through the fire,
But I can't make it through the night
I want nothing more than to be what I was,
I feel so far away from where I was;
I can't wipe the scars away.
No amount of vinegar or vasoline will heal me.

But I can't figure out how get Adobe Photoshop 6 and Microsoft Frontpage XP to carbon-copy what I have in my head.  Oh well.

I've pretty much learned how to play my first all the way through:  Metallica's <i>Seek & Destroy</i> off of their <u>Kill'Em All</u> album.  Yeah, it was the first song I tried to do in guitar lessons when I took them a year or two ago, and it was also the reason why I quit taking guitar lessons:  too damned hard.  But I've gotten down the weird-ass intro and the pre-verse and verse riffs.  I have most of the chorus down except for little variations in riffs.  The solo fill is what's killing me.  I don't know what it is behind the solo.  Maybe I'll get Chris Rose to help me.  He's the guy that used to give me guitar lessons.

I went by Dad's CDs, too.  I picked up a CD I ordered.  Lacuna Coil's <u>Unleashed Memories</u>.  I first heard their single <i>To Live is to Hide</i> on a sampler and really dug their atmospheric metallic sound with male and female melodic vocals.  They're really neat.  I think they're Italian.

Last week I bought Nothingface's <u>Violence</u> cassette.  The first time I have <b>ever</b> bought a cassette before.  It's OK, though.  It was only $6.00. 

I believe this evening, before Jamie comes up to spend the night, I shall work on my latest web-idea:  Emotional Creations.  I know the name is somewhat boring and easy to come by, but it's exactly what it's going to be.  It'll be a full site to showcase everything I've ever written.  All poems, lyrics, plays, and short stories.  I wonder if anyone will be interested?  *shrug*
 
Another thing I plan on doing, but probably won't do, is work on music.  Corey Taylor's song ""Bother"" and this new CD of mine have inspired me.  But I won't probably do it.  Cuz I'm a loser.

You really should listen to this song ... <i>Distant Memories</i> is the name I believe.  Here are the lyrics, of course ...

""We're never been apart
The day has come
I'm feeling that your sun
Shines away from me

Tease me
Holding my hands you smile again
I couldn't see you away from me
I do realize it now

Living in me
You are living in me
You are living in me

I feel you by my side
Your living soul wants to run away with me
Inside of me

And now
Will something happen to me ?
How did I lose my guide ?
You left me all alone

But now it is to late
I know it is natural but now
What can I do without your presence here ?
A never-ending pain

Living in me

You are living in me

I feel you by my side
Your living soul wants to run away with me
Inside of me

I feel you by my side
And I'm sure that I can't forget you
You are inside of me

<b>BOTHER</b>

I wish I was too dead to cry.
Self-affliction fades.
Stones to throw at my creator;
Masochist to which I cater.

You don't need to bother.
I don't need to be.
I'll keep slipping farther,
but, once I hold on, I won't let go till it bleeds.

I wish I was too dead to care,
If indeed I cared at all.
Never had a voice to protest,
So you fed me shit to digest.
I wish I had a reason,
My flaws are open season.
For this I gave up trying,
One good turn deserves my dying.

You don't need to bother.
I don't need to be.
I'll keep slipping farther,
but, once I hold on, I won't let go till it bleeds.

I wish I died instead of lived 
The zombie adds my face
Shell forgotten with it's memories
Tires left with cryptic entries.

You don't need to bother.
I don't need to be.
I'll keep slipping farther,
but, once I hold on, I won't let go till it bleeds.

You don't need to bother.
I don't need to be.
I'll keep slipping farther,

Lived through this sick pattern we call adolescence,
I pray that my brethren will make it through, too.
So many lost in the fight for identity,
I now stand where I never thought that I would stand.
When you are young, your sights are always set so short
When you grow up, you can't understand it either
You never can grasp what you have went through
And the one question that continues to rise is ""Why?""

<i>Why were we subjected to ten years of loss and confusion?
Why did we have to fight everyone and everything to live?
There were always those times that I thought that I would lose my sight
And with each year that has passed, those times have grown more consistent
But if I rely on myself and my friends, I will make it
Through everything, even through the sick pattern that we call life</i>

Now I stand atop a mountain of experience
I hope that my brethren will listen to me, now.
So many nights I thought I was alone in this world,
I let the ones who brought me down bring me lower.
When you are young, your loving heart is so fragile
When you grow up, you will never forget the pain
You can't push past what you have went through
But the life you have lived will answer the question ""Why?""

<i>Why were we subjected to ten years of loss and confusion?
So that we could learn exactly what our parents did not know.
Why did we have to fight everyone and everything to live?
Because everything we have fought for we will love that much more.
I relied on myself and on my friends and I made it through
I did not let those who lied about love bring me to my knees!</i>

And I have lived through this life,
Conceived by the torn
In the womb of love and loss,
Where vengeance is born!

Vengeance against those who have brought me down
Is to stand on my feet where they can't.
Vengeance against those who tried to break me
Is to stand without regret or shame.
Vengeance against those who have brought me torn
Is to stand on my feet above them all.
Vengeance against who caused it to be born
Is to never again let myself fall.

Vengeance is born in a broken heart and lost pride
And conceived by a life torn apart and broken insides
Vengeance is born in the eyes of those who were lost
And conceived by always going against the odds.

I have made it through.
I stand here avenged.
I live with the pain,
But I no longer hurt.

I am vengeance.
I am avenged."

There was a plot that I had to get to Texas (where she must've lived) to see her because there was a chance that we could've been together again.  In the dream, I tried every way in the world to sneak onto a plane.  It was like one of those romantic-comedy skits without any comedy.  It was all too serious.  A woman that I work with, Sherry Barnett, was like the woman in charge of whether I would be able to sneak onto the plane or not and she said no and I cried.  Even when I explained to her the situation of how much I loved Jessica and would do anything for her (Jessica), she wouldn't let me.  So, I left the airport.

The next day, I went to school at John I. Burton (from which I am a graduate) and then I left school (there was no school in between, I guess I skipped that part in the dream). and I was leaving, and Jessica was at the school.  I was just going to leave then I realized that this could've been a chance.  She was getting into an SUV with Tim Boardwine (a local sheriff's deputy) and I guess he was taking her to the Sheriff's Office for some reason.  She yelled out the window at me and said ""I guess I'd rather learn the lesson!"" while she was grinning.  I don't know why.  *shrug*  I guess the lesson has to do with her not being with me.  Anyway, I started crying, like the bitch that I am, and she got all sad because she made me cry (which she does) and told me to wait for her.  I did and she never showed up.  Her car ended up disappearing from the dream, but she never showed up again.

Because I'm too special
I'll always be alone
Because I'm not normal!

Why?
Why am I this way?
Why did I choose this path?
Why did I choose this life?
Why?!

All I ever wanted was something beautiful!
All I ever needed was a love of my own!
All I ever wanted was to be called special,
Now all I need is to be the same old, same old!
All the boring people, they all seem so happy!
I wonder why, I wonder why, that can't be me!

<i>All the boring people
They all seem so happy
And I wonder why that can't be me
And I wonder why that can't be me ...</i>

And I wonder why that can't be me ..."

Big brown eyes, tattooed on my heart,
I can't believe that I let you tear me apart.
I can't believe myself, I was so full of fear,
I let one person ruin my life for three years.
I lost so many because you let me get away
Big brown eyes, crying to get me to stay.

Crying to get me to stay!

Big brown eyes, you had me believe
That I was the one that you would always be with
I can't believe I let myself let you guide me
I can't believe I pushed them all away for you
I lost so many because you let me get away
Big brown eyes, crying to get me to stay.

Crying to get me to stay!

Big brown eyes, I thought it was love,
I can't believe I let me become just like you.
I can't believe I lost her because of you
Three years difference, roles reversed, the same result;
I lost so many because you let me get away
Big brown eyes, crying to get me to stay.

I thought that it was for love!

Should've stayed, never should've strayed,
Never should've let the memories get to me.
Should've learned, never should've lost,
Never should've let the memories get to me.

I have learned my lesson well!

Big brown eyes, lost it all again,
I can't believe that I hurt because of you again
And it has been years since I have even heard you
But everyday the marks you have left can be seen
I lost so many because you let me get away
Big brown eyes, crying to get me to stay!

I know that I have cried because you had let me get away
But I cry harder because I let you let me let her go ..."

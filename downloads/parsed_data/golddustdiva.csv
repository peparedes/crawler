"event","I'm still going between shock and grief after hearing yesterday that Steve is gone.  He was such a HUGE presence; it's amazing to think that so MUCH energy and life force just blipped off the screen in no time at all.  

On WGN Radio today, there was talk about ""wouldn't you stop doing a career that could leave your small children fatherless?"" and the topic grew to include soldiers, sailors, etc., and firefighters, law enforcement, etc., and the decision was sort of reached that, no, the families of these individuals know that any given day at the office could cost that loved one his or her life, and that when you do what you have to do, your family has to deal with potentially tragic outcomes.  Then the radio guy (I love ya, John Williams, but not always because I agree with you) basically said, ""But we NEED firefighters and law enforcement personnel..."" indicating that Steve, as an entertainer, was less entitled to risk his life because he had children, or because his cause was less ""important"" than those of other heroes who put their lives on the line constantly.  I didn't call in, though I wanted to, and decided to put my answer here (and maybe email it to Williams, should the humor come upon me to do so).

John:
There are heroes and there are heroes.  A hero who makes a rescue you do not value is no less a hero than the guy who pulls your child out of a burning building.  Of course I want there to be firefighters and paramedics and law enforcement folks out there to save my bacon, and that of those I love.  Of course I want them to carry out the little old lady who was overcome by smoke when her cat knocked over a candle.  

BUT - I also want someone to save the cat.  The soldiers who feed their MREs to starving alley dogs in Baghdad are as much heroes as those who carry babies out of bombed out buildings.  

Steve Irwin did that, and leagues upon leagues more.  

Maybe you do not know that he purchased extensive pieces of land in the Outback to create wildlife refuges.  Maybe you do not know that he actively campaigned against the purchase and sale of wildlife products (making crocs into ""boots, bags and belts"" turned his stomach), and that he and his staff have done countless hands-on rescues of no less than thousands of individual animals who would otherwise have perished through conflict with humans and their footprints on the environment.  Not only crocodiles and venomous snakes, whom most people find  hard to love or respect, but also endangered animals like koalas and rock wallabies.. and that's only what he's done in Australia.  He has traveled the world to support and participate in active and existing conservation efforts, often providing material and financial support where it does incalculable good. 

The environment needs heroes; it is diminishing and suffering daily at the hands of man.  I don't remember the exact number, but we as humans lose something like FIFTEEN SPECIES PER DAY on this planet!  This is unconscionable and abhorrent in the extreme, and Steve is one of many out there doing incredible work in the effort to cease this abomination.  

Yes, John Williams, the world needs firefighters.  But the world needs its Steve Irwins, too.  Frankly, I would rather have my house burn down and lose everything in it than realize that there will never be another rock wallaby in the bush.  If a family of six dies in a bomb blast, it's horrible, but there will NEVER be another Barbary Tiger, and there will always be more people.  Which emergency is really more important?   

It has long been known among environmentalists that people will only know what they have been taught... that they will love only what they know, and that they will protect only what they love.  Thanks to Steve Irwin, millions of people now LOVE crocodiles, wolves, and other apex predators.  Without those species, the cute and cuddly fauna of our planet are also doomed.  Steve's work in conservation went even further than the rescues, even further than the creation of wildlife refuges, even further than the hands-on efforts.  Steve's work with the public, and in particular, children, has given rise to tremendous waves of respect and affection for defenseless wildlife who are otherwise sentenced to the misery of irresponsible planetary management.  He has given the world a forum to love and protect animals.  Even those un-cuddly, dangerous and unappealing creatures that scare or repel us as people have our respect and our concern, thanks to Steve Irwin, above and beyond the efforts of his peers and confederates in conservation.  

Beyond a doubt, Steve's entertainment was gimmicky.  He was not always serious, but he was always educating.  He never made a secret of his methods: ""If I can get you to watch me (and LOOK at the competition he has been up against), I can get you to care about this animal, these species, these unappealing, monstrous and deadly animals as well as these darling, furry, cuddly ones.  If I can get you to care about them, you will do what you can to protect them.  If you do what you can to protect them, I have done my job.""  I don't really NEED to hear another ""Crikey!  Have a look at this little beauty!"" but I do need to remember why that catch-phrase needed to exist, and what it has managed to accomplish on my planet.  And so do you.  Yes, he stuck his head in the lion's mouth in myriad ways for a number of years.  He didn't start out doing it for the public; he began tossing crocodiles to save their lives, as well as to protect the humans with whom they were clashing.  The idea of turning that bravery and passion into an entire pro-wildlife movement was not only brilliant but an imperative that our planet may depend upon.  

What would the world be like if we had had no Steve Irwin?  Would anyone else try and teach us to love the apex predators?  The ones who would cheerfully rip off our heads as soon as look at us?  I doubt it.  And without them, we eventually would lose every one of the wildlife species that DO make us purr and smile and go ""awww.""  

Even in light of the tremendous efforts made by conservation groups and individuals all over the world, not to mention the bright lights like Steve, there may yet come a day when future generations ask us, ""Why aren't there any more crocodiles?  Why aren't there any more deer?  What happened to the Tasmanian Devil, the wolverine, the squirrel?""  When only humans remain, no explanation will be good enough for why those creatures are gone.  Our descendants will not accept any answer.  Maybe, though, we can point to Steve Irwin and say, ""this is one of many of us who gave his all to try and keep them here.""  At least that is SOMETHING.  

So yes, Steve took huge chances every day.  But I admire him at least as much as those others who do so for the safety of my home and family.  Irwin's goal was about the entire planet, and making rescues on a scale that we cannot comprehend.  

Around my house, we are just gutted.  we have lost a personal hero, a very bright spark who gave us hope for the continuation of the other species of the Earth.  We honor our veterans around here too, and all the others who have risked their lives for the safety and security of human beings.  Steve Irwin, however, gave his life as willingly and as freely as they, for a cause that simply exists on a different plane.  

My heart breaks for his beautiful wife, Terri, his wonderful father, Bob, and his precious children, Bindi and Robert.  It is horribly sad and unfair that little Bob won't have the chance to know him as Bindi does, but unlike so many children who have such losses, Steve's existence will go on forever in video.  My heart breaks, too, for his extended family, the animal kingdom, who have lost perhaps their greatest champion.  I share the grief of the millions who have been pouring out their sympathies in tributes to him all over the world; we have lost a friend that most of us have never met.  

The challenge is upon us now to keep sight of what was always primary in Steve's life: the urgent need to protect the world's wildlife.  Whether it's brown bears or brown snakes, we must not lose sight of their importance to the planet, to and our legacy.  Now that Steve Irwin's life upon this planet has been completed, how can ANY of us just shrug our shoulders and tell our children, ""Well, there just aren't any more animals out there?"" 

That's pretty darn important.

"event","Just a quick plug for the whole concept of Sending Matter Through the Universe.  I've done this informally with friends for a great many years, but it's always good to increase your options.  My good friend and coworker, Linda, has more clutter than anyone could need for three lifetimes, but it's an everchanging mass of clutter.  She will periodically go through her clothes, her daughters' clothes, home decorating accessories and supplies, craft supplies, gardening things, even furniture, and thin out all the things she knows she has no further use for.  Then she fires up the network... she fills up her van, comes to work and does the leprechaun thing.. leaves bags of clothing next to the desks of those who are the size of the clothing.  We then take them home, try them on, and either return or donate them if we don't want to keep them.  Then she'll pull over one of us and say, ""I've got some more craft stuff/a little bookcase/a couple of pictures for that wall in your apartment"" and we load up on whatever she's brought in the van, and take it home.  Consequently, the Friends of Linda have often utilized this network she created and given each other stuff as well - for example, I'm typing this right now while sitting at a desk I was given, free, from a member of the Friends of Linda network.  

I also belong to the Friends of Patsy and Kelly network, which is a bit less populated but also quite active.  Patsy, may she rest in peace, was the Inner City Queen of Stuff, while Linda is her suburban contemporary.  Kelly, Patsy's daughter, inherited all of Patsy's clutter when she passed and is now clomping merrily along in her mother's footsteps.  

While Patsy and Linda never met, they shared a very important genetic or social value mandate... ""If I can't use it, I bet someone else can.""  Recently, I discovered there's a whole online movement with a similar philosophy, but with a delicious environmentally-motivated twist.  It seems to have begun with Freecycle, where the priority is to keep this stuff out of landfills.  I love that.  The basic idea is to use the Internet to tell the group, ""I've got this doohickey I don't need.  If you can use it, you can have it.""  Or, in the alternative, ""Does anyone have a flexnard they don't use anymore?  Mine broke and I'd be happy to take yours off your hands.""  This is a fantastic idea, in my opinion.  When I joined up, the group was called Freecycle, which is a copyrighted organization name.  It then became Curbcycle, and included ""curb sightings"" messages from members like, ""They're throwing away a nice looking computer desk at 123 Sesame Street in Gotham.  If you want it, come and grab it before the trash collectors get it.""  They also post things like, ""I""m having a garage sale this weekend.  Come by Sunday night or Monday and pick up any leftovers you like.  There will be books, baby clothes......"" The key was, everything is given freely, no selling or bartering, just come get it and you can have it.  (No pets, but pet supplies are fair game).  Some posters do allow resellers to get their stuff, to be sent on via Ebay, thrift shops or whatever.  Some are very adamant about that NOT being done.  In general, that's been mostly respected, but everyone who offers something up realizes they really cannot control what's done with it.  Our Curbcycle group has now become Freesources, but the values have stayed the same.  

I've given away an old computer monitor, four rugs, a thingy to stand your patio umbrella in, and I still have some old stereo components, dayplanners, and Fedex envelopes on offer at the moment.  It's fantastic.  I get more space in my house, I don't have the guilt of throwing away things that could have a life in someone else's home/yard/workshop, and the landfills don't have to cope with my inability to say no to the Friends of Linda network or whatever.  

Additionally, I am contacted regularly by groups I refer to as the PU's.. the Poor Unfortunates.  The Purple Heart, Vietnam Vets, Salvation Army, and Amvets all have my phone number.  They call me when they're making a pickup in my area and ask if I'll have stuff for them.  Then they send out a reminder card and even call me the night before to make sure I remember to put stuff out on my front porch for the morning.  I just tape their postcard to the bag or box and they come and poof it out of my life.  I send matter out into the universe about every three or four weeks this way.  Unlike the Freesources deal, you can also take tax deductions when they pick up your stuff.  Most people can find their nearest chapter of these groups in the white or yellow pages.

You would THINK this would make an appreciable difference in how crammed-full my house is.  Actually, I'm probably the only one who actually SEES the empty space left behind when the stuff is gone, but the longer I keep at it, the more satisfying it is, and the more likely I am to keep it up.  There will never be a day when my home has the streamlined, uncluttered, Oriental sort of look that so many crave, but at least I'll have room for more crap!

I encourage everyone reading this to search yahoogroups.com or groups.msn.com or whoever they're with and hunt up a Freecycle, Curbcycle or Freesources group in your area.  Or even a barter and trade group, they're good, too.  Reading the WANTED messages might inspire you to pass along things you didn't realize you didn't need.... Posting OFFER messages  and having people come and get your unneeded stuff is also a great way to feel that you're doing something for others.  Sometimes we hear of folks burned out of their homes, new marrieds, single moms in trouble, etc., and we get to actually make a small change in their lives by sharing stuff with them.  So, if you're a cluttermonger like myself, get in there and mong with us.  It's a fine thing.  

Stop thinking about it and do it."

This is one of those entries that a woman needs three balls to write.  Fortunately, I'm just the woman to do it.  

I hate to man-bash, but not so much as to prevent me from writing a potentially venomous rant here.  Just because I'm feeling like a good guy here, I'm going to refer to the individuals I need to mention with numbers, not to mention the odd epithet here and there.  

The chat room I consider my online ""home"" is being held hostage by terrorists.  Not your usual Osama kind who physically bomb your house, but the same sort of emotional violence is being employed and I've had absolutely enough.  To say I'm blind with rage would concede the event too much importance, but I am torqued and getting more so on a daily basis.

Two so-called ""regulars"" of the chat room (who have a long association with the room, but also have real lives and aren't there as much as I am, nor many of our friends) have decided that it's time to battle each other.  Unfortunately, the room they're using as a battleground is full (and I mean FULL) of folks who don't give a damn that they're mad at each other and want them to take it somewhere else.  It's all about booters... one guy (whom I shall VERY appropriately label ""Number 2"") feels that his ball size has been called into question because he was (apparently) unjustly accused of booting by Number 3.  Number 2 feels that Number 3 has been running his mouth and talking big long enough, and should be put in his place/destroyed/slain/punished/whatever other scary participles he can think of.  He wants the rest of us to make no mistake, he's a ""baaaaaaad man"" and not to be fucked with.  Number 3, on the other hand, did make a lot of noises initially about coming to visit Number 2 and physically make him into goo.  Then, somewhere along the line, he decided he wasn't going to use booters anymore, he was going to rise above this whole mess, but still come into the room and launch a lot of taunts while expecting Number 2 to create his own demise/hang himself/lose face/whatever.  He's been in the room offering the rest of us ""anti-hacking"" resources as well, given that he's quit booting/hacking and Number 2 has not.  

Rather than take this battle private, both are using the chat room as their bully pulpit, or their court of public opinion, or whatever other irresistible oasis they want to consider it.  THAT is the part I'm most incensed about.  Number 2 has been sitting in residence like Saddam in his palace and either threatening or booting outright anyone who says things that upset him.  Um, scuse me.. that's Fascism.  He's also been airing his ass to the adoring licks of a squadron of grinning lackeys who think he's just the coolest thing since menthol.  He claims, ""ya either love me or ya hate me,"" and declares anyone who gets in his face a member of the opposing ""camp.""  In his delirium, he's unable to recognize that most of us pretty much don't give a shit who wins this third grade ""see you after school"" rumble.  Number 3 has taken his turns as well, but does more of a commando-raid kind of thing - swoop in, say hi to those who greet him, fling a few insults, sit back and watch the flap, then find something better to do.  Since they're not talking to each other, they talk ABOUT each other in the room and wait to see what others say.

The problem with this bullshit going on (Yes, I've used ignore and enjoyed it very much) is that others who would ordinarily come in to Ask A Witch (since that is the name of the room) observe this nonsense and leave before the rest of the room can be of service.  In addition, those same people depart from the room with a hugely uncomplimentary image of Pagans and the way they treat each other, and surely make a point to tell people in other rooms.  I see dozens of people arrive and leave after thirty seconds without saying a word.  Half of those, surely, are the people I'm concerned about. 

I've already ranted about why the room has value.  It is there to help contribute to better understanding about witches and pagans and hopefully be part of the rational voice that will lead to religious equality for those who do not yet enjoy it.  The room has a PURPOSE.  The battle is making this impossible to carry out.  That is unfair to the public.  In addition, those of us who wish to enjoy the room as we always do must now carefully watch what we say, or the Lord God High King BooFoo Booter will either boot us, fry out our ports, or otherwise fuck us over.  That means everyone who would normally ""live"" in ""our"" room has been reduced to the life of a victim of the Taliban.  We scurry for shelter in case the beatings resume or the shelling starts again.  We tippy toe around lest we be accused of being in the other camp.  We chat in a climate of either fear, disgust or both.  I'm sorry, but that's fucking unfair to those of us who put in those endless hours trying to contribute to the greater good. 

And why?  Because of what George Carlin called the Bigger Dick Theory.  ""What? His dick's bigger than mine?  We'll have to KILL HIM!""  How fucking ridiculous can you get?  In a CHAT ROOM of all places?  In a bar, either of the combatants would have asked the other to step outside, caused whatever carnage they saw fit, gotten on their Harleys and driven off before the cops came.  Everyone would then perpetuate the reputation of said winner as the Lord High Mystic Badass of the Twenty-Inch Dick.  Where is this victory in a CHAT ROOM?  Whoever gets their name/account locked can simply return under a new one.  It's a free fucking service, as well, so it's not even like there's a financial hit to take.  Getting booted is simply being knocked offline and having to log back on to return to the room.  Where, o death, is thy sting?  Now, the issue of committing actual harm to someone else's computer over paltry bullshit like this is absolutely untenable.. and though I have not heard of it happening in this battle, the potential and capability exists on each side. 

Now, let's move on to the aforementioned asslicking Taliban underlings.  All of a sudden, Number 2 tells the funniest jokes, makes all the best decisions, and is right no matter whom he insults.  Lick, lick, lick.  Numbers 4 and 5 seem to be the Prime Ministers of the Kingdom of Number 2.  One of them is drunk pretty much every possible second that he can be, and freely admits this.  He also has booters that he will use to defend the weak or himself when attacked.  He hacked the account of a much beloved regular not too long ago.  The regular who was hacked refused to doubt some highly heinous IRL  accusations made against Number 4, and after a lot of battling, wound up losing his account.  Number 4's popularity dropped significantly at that point, but he hurriedly linked up with Number 2 to save face.  Number 5 is also a booter, and has appointed himself some sort of psychotic sergeant-at-arms to Number 2.  Lick, lick, lick.  Since Number 3 (the opponent, remember?) is largely on his own in terms of armaments but not popularity, Number 2 feels that he has assumed a throne that doesn't exist and grown balls on top of his regular ones.  Number 4 has mostly spent time creating alternate screen names that involve a variety of vulgarisms and sat around drinking and watching the room, waiting for a chance to join in a team boot.  I have had him on Ignore a lot, since I have this massive impatience with babysitting online drunkards.  I just click every new name that comes in with ""pussy,"" ""cock,"" ""dangdang,"" ""fvk_yer_momma,"" etc., in it.  

There are also the Posse Emeritus, the non-boot-capable folks who make SURE they talk nice to Number 2... very Saddam-era-Iraq sounding nice talk...so that Number 2 won't suddenly turn on them as disloyal and kick their cyber asses.  They laugh uproariously at his insults of others and grin with their tails between their legs.  Remember, you either LOVE Number 2 or you hate him... these dopes would EAT number 2 to save their asses.  Goddess help them if Number 2 thought they were secretly supporting Number 3!!  Lickety-lickety-lick, lick, lick.

Then there are the loudmouths.  Thank the GODS for the one who finally started snapping at them first.  Being a Pisces, I was sitting back and just letting it run its course, but yesterday, Number 6 finally decided she (gosh, the first SHE we've talked about, all the assrods I've mentioned so far have been males, amazingly enough) had had enough of personal vendettas being splashed all over the room and started demanding that they use IMs to do their battling.  What happened? They threatened to boot her, of course!  Why they didn't actually do it, I don't know.  As she raged, I cheered, but didn't add a great deal to the discourse.  Number 7, another very strongly worded woman, took Number 2 to task last night and engaged me in a discussion of pissing contests and dick-length comparison battles and their corroborate idiocy.  Having finished third grade a full 35 years ago, I made a point to draw the comparison and also campaign for the bullshit to move out of the room.

Today, my cork blew off and I had at Number 2 directly.  I pointed out that the rest of the room was tired of living in a war zone and that the appropriate place for this nonsense was in a room called ""Pissing Contests.""  Of course my friendship with Number 3 was brought up - though I SPECIFICALLY did not defend him in the least - and I was summarily dismissed with ""Do I look like I give a fuck what you think?""

Next event..later that same day... Number 2 enters the room while I'm chatting and commences talking about me to one of his asslicker friends.  ""Oh, you missed it.  Diva flipped out today.  I almost nailed her but I didn't.  She was lucky.""  I was then told directly that I'm ""not worth"" nailing (does that mean booting or port frying?  Chickenshit did not say). and I'm a two faced bitch who shouldn't ""feel safe"" in the room. I asked if he was taking Fascism classes on the weekends these days.  No response.  And of course, he mentioned Number 3, and considered that my reason for opposing him. 

My personal view on that.... I enjoy an excellent reputation in the room.  Not to put too fine a point on it, but a lot of members of the room will tell you they love me, look up to me, consider me wise, consider me learned, or whatever other complimentary phrase hits them as significant.  A LOT.  Yes, I do enjoy something akin to the ""patronage"" of Number 3, but I don't really need it to have a very strong standing in that room.  What I actually think happened was that, either alone, or in consultation with one of his flunkies, Number 2 gave serious thought to the decision of whether or not to nuke this loudmouthed infidel who DARED to speak out against his juvenile bullshit.  And he chose not to do so.  Why?  I think the loss of face might have been a bigger chip than he could have put on the table.  I really don't think he wants to be seen abusing Diva.  He knows I don't care if he insults me.  Vulgarity is his regular vocabulary, so how could one tell when he's particularly vulgar about someone?  But to do me actual harm?  When everyone KNOWS I neither have a booter nor could use one with a geek on my lap?  That would be like kicking a kindergartener out of a wheelchair.  A much-beloved kindergartener, as well.  

The crux of the issue, in my opinion, is that it MUST leave the room.  Number 2 insists on keeping this fight in the room so that everyone can see him defame Number 3. And more importantly, to solidify his imagined position of power.  In the same way the Taliban did their executions in fully-packed public arenas... SEE THIS INFIDEL?  SHE SAID I SMELL BAD!  STONE HER!!  NOW COWER IN FEAR LEST YOU BE NEXT! Hello, Stalin?  I've got your understudy on line 2.  Number 3 does his insulting in the room in front of everyone, too.  The reason I've levelled off against Number 2 instead of 3 is quite simple.  Number 2 counters all protest with A: threats or actual retaliation and B: the repeated statement that he doesn't give a FUCK what anyone thinks of him.  Let's look at that again.  He won't go off and have this battle OUTSIDE the court of public opinion.. yet he doesn't give a fuck about what anyone thinks of him?  He doesn't care what anyone thinks of him, but is on a tear to ""punish"" Number 3 IN FRONT OF EVERYONE so that we all can see how big his genitals are!  But remember, he doesn't give a FUCK what people think of him.  He doesn't give a fuck what I think of him, but he wants me to know I should not feel safe, and he was ""about to nail"" me. BECAUSE OF WHAT I THINK OF HIM!! If he didn't give a fuck, why would he threaten me?  As far as I'm concerned, that's LYING.  That is DECEIT.  That is like standing up and telling the room that he is a LIAR.  The part that's funny is how STUPID a person must be NOT TO SEE THAT EVERYONE CAN TELL HE IS LYING!!!   I think I could tolerate an HONEST Fascist more easily than one who's lying... particularly one who's too stupid to see that he's lying and that those around him DO see it.  


If there is any defense of Number 3, it's that he is USING public opinion (or trying to), to allow Number 2 to paint himself the shallow and immature bully that he actually is.  He's not walking in pretending that public opinion isn't the primary bargaining chip.  He's attempting to WORK public opinion's natural processes to allow Number 2 to hang himself.  And frankly, if Number 2 DOES decide to ""nail"" the Diva, that's exactly what will happen.  He's power-hungry (though what this ""power"" consists of in actual fact is a mystery nobody's solved yet), and he may forget that nailing me is a bad idea.  So far, he or his posse have kept that plan put aside.  I've backed up my family photos and important files, just in case, but I'm still just as likely NOT to be hit as to be hit, since his judgement may or may not fail him the next time I happen along.  I MIGHT be the Shot Heard Round The Chatroom.  I might be the last nasty thing he ever does. Maybe I overestimate my own reputation, but it seems to me that ""nailing"" Diva would bury him socially in that room to a significant degree.  Especially since I've gone on record as saying that what was important to me was ONLY the room not being a war zone anymore.  However, I'd really rather not be a war victim.  Booting, who gives a shit, but I don't want to just ""give"" this asshole my computer.  I worked for it, not him.  And again, it's JUST a chat room, and I'm not throwing out $500 worth of hardware just to end a chat room war.  

For now, I've left the chat room, so that he can stroke his pud and tell everyone how he threatened me, drove me out terrified and how big his balls are since he threatened the Diva.  He couldn't WAIT to tell people when he arrived in the room earlier, in my presence, so that I was aware of his big-balledness, so I'm sure MANY others will be hearing about it tonight.  It makes his penis feel longer, his balls bigger, his general manliness more inflated.  Over software, mind you.  I think he's going to have a hard time pulling off a real character assassination of me, since many others know that my goal is to restore the room, not to root for one rival over another.  He really cannot use the ""She's Number 3's friend"" card too far, since I was careful NOT to defend him.  Of course, that level of sound reasoning has long escaped this whackjob. Beyond that, as I said, my reputation has come about via three years of honorable behavior.  I've always been exactly who I say I am, and almost nobody would buy that I've suddenly become ""a two faced bitch.""  But the longer his lackeys encourage him to rip on me, the more face he will lose among the rest of the regulars.  Best way to let that happen is to not show up. Saves me getting nuked and lets the job be done with no effort on my part.  I'll let him have the rest of this evening and probably tomorrow to dig his grave.  Why not fall into your casket with a big erection, after all?  

If this computer isn't blown to bits in the next few days, I'll be updating this saga.... if, of course, it's actually at all interesting by then.  Seeya."

"event","Ok, time to vent. I have been noticing a theme lately: SOLVE IT FOR ME.
What is WITH people lately? They won't do anything for themselves if
they can crawl up onto a tit (most specifically MINE lately) and get
their needs met passively. In just the past four hours, I've been asked
to THINK for people, do RESEARCH for people, REMEMBER for people, HAND
them entire rituals, FIND a chatter they're looking for, and probably
six other things I can't remember. This is madness. Well, it's giving
ME a taste of what madness feels like. <br>
<br>
Who the HELL has offered ME a nipple lately? Well, come to think of it,
I haven't OFFERED mine to anyone either! They just somehow assume that
since I'm present, and breathing, I'd LOVE to pop them onto my lap and
meet their needs for them. What puts that belief INTO people!?!?
<br>
<br>
I have a student who is just now.. in March (and I met him in August)
figuring out that quizzes require him to THINK. I've been pestered by a
guest to the Ask A Witch room that would love for me to type an ENTIRE
RITUAL to the Sun God into a PM box for him. Then another one comes in
asking in sixteen different ways where ""Moongoth"" or something is. What
is it that tells people that if the first TEN times you ask for
something, it doesn't happen, that the ELEVENTH and FOLLOWING times
will bring the desired result? <br>
<br>
And you know what, dammit? It's my BIRTHDAY today. People should be
handing ME stuff. No, I'm not dismissing that I got some nice gifts and
cards from very nice people today. And no, I'm not pretending that the
whole world should KNOW it's my birthday. But DAMN... Who was it that
stuck a sign on my head reading SERVICE DESK? When I find them, I'm
kicking their ass!!&nbsp; And I'm NOT taking them to the ER afterward.<br>
<br>
I've worked pretty hard over the years establishing boundaries.&nbsp;
This is my job; that is your job.&nbsp; This is my space; that is your
space.&nbsp; I'm responsible for this; you're responsible for
that.&nbsp; I guess people need to learn the hard way how to do that; I
certainly did.&nbsp; Maybe I'm just running into people who haven't
gotten that message yet.&nbsp; I wish I could just reprint the
explanations of those who have taught me over the years.. HEY DOOF....
If YOU gave birth to it, it's your problem.&nbsp; If YOU studied it,
YOU get tested on it.&nbsp; If YOU did it wrong, YOU fix it.&nbsp; If
YOU wanna learn it, YOU go to the library (you don't WHINE that the
internet hasn't got material on it).&nbsp; If you don't see it on the
shelf, it's not for sale.&nbsp; If your buddy is not in the chat room,
we cannot find her.&nbsp; If she's that good a buddy, LIST her and
chase her down your own self, asshat!<br>
<br>
I'm in just the right mood to be this mad, and I am.&nbsp; I'm sure
there are lots of people who don't feel ""right"" unless they're actively
helping someone.&nbsp; I am POSITIVE I haven't given birth to anyone,
so why am I suddenly expected to MOM the whole world?&nbsp; Not
""mother"" them... but MOM them.. as in, ""hey Mom, where are my green
socks?""&nbsp; and ""hey, Mom, what's for dinner?""&nbsp; The kinds of
""hey, Moms"" that reflect their true inner meaning: I AM TOO SODDING
LAZY TO TEND TO MYSELF.&nbsp; The socks are where you left them and
dinner will be comprised of what you cook for yourself.&nbsp;
THERE!&nbsp; HAPPY NOW?&nbsp; <br>
<br>
I think I'm much more likely to do a friend a favor if they ADMIT
they're too lazy or too rushed right now to do it.&nbsp; But to sit
still and whine and yammer about the same nonsense more than once is
preposterous.&nbsp; Are we ALL four years old all of a sudden,
kiddies?&nbsp; Duck, Duck, Goose!&nbsp; Your turn now!<br>
<br>
It's almost enough to turn me Republi.... no, shh... that's not
happening.&nbsp; But I AM getting really into who's responsible for
what... Like the issue with the bus driver for the Dave Matthews
band.&nbsp; This dork dumped eight HUNDRED pounds of
bus-toilet-contents onto an open tour bus on the Chicago River last
year.&nbsp; It's not even in his defense to say he was AIMING for the
river itself and the bus got in the way.&nbsp; I'm glad he got socked
with a fine, probation and community service. &nbsp; Not to mention
lost his job and cost the band a mess of money, too.&nbsp; Community
service?&nbsp; Hey... I think everyone should contact HIM and get on
HIS tit for a while.&nbsp; I'm not on probation for anything!&nbsp; I
haven't committed an environmental crime.&nbsp; Why is everyone lining
up at MY window for stupid shit they can't be bothered to resolve for
themselves?&nbsp; Who ya gonna call?&nbsp; POOP DUMPERS!<br>
<br>
Ok, I feel better now.&nbsp; Gonna put my Nipple Caps on and go face the world again.&nbsp; Bye for now. <br>
<br>

"event","Wow, it's been a while.  I hadn't realized how long it's been since I last prattled here.  Time for a little more ragging about behaviors in Ask A Witch that torque me. 

In the days before Pictures on your Profile, the regulars in chat rooms had to go to some effort to email each other pictures so they could know what their chat friends looked like.  Now, a lot of people freely post their pictures on their profiles for (as the Irish might say) the whole world and his wife to see.  That scares the crap out of me, personally, since people DO forget and unleash other identifying information about themselves in the chat room, or on email, and the right person, assembling the right information, could go all stalker on their asses and yet another Sad Tale about the Internet makes the news.  I am SO not into getting stalked; my to-do list does not include Live in Terror and Paranoia.  

Another reason I don't post my picture is that I am employed in a public school and only hang out in a Witches' room.  Well, duh.  Yes, I am proud of both my career and my spiritual path, but I am NOT out at work, and would not COME out at work.  I know for a fact we've had gay teachers working there.  We also have a lovely Celtophile/Liberal/Outspoken teacher there who's very possibly Pagan, and if not, highly Pagan-Friendly.  Some of my coworkers know I'm a pagan/witch, and they're fine with it.  I would not think most of them would give a shaggy rat's tail if the whole faculty knew.  Unfortunately (for the purposes of this rant, specifically), my work day is filled with far fewer teachers than students.  We have about 3000 of 'em.  And they all have parents or parent-facsimiles.  

During about my second or third year of teaching, I heard from a parent who objected to the activity our class was doing at the time of Day of the Dead, which is a huge holiday celebrated by the cultures I teach about.  She told me that her SON is a Jehovah's Witness (didn't say whether or not SHE was, but I took the hint), and that HE ""felt uncomfortable"" having to decorate a skull according to custom, and write a ""calavera"" poem about someone he knows.  She stated, very politely, that he was more than willing to do an alternate assignment rather than participate in a pagan ritual.  Of course, I provided him with an alternative and he got the lesson's objectives met, but I could not resist pointing out a few booboos in Mom's letter when I replied.  Once the letter was completed, I cut it down about fifty percent and then mailed the edited copy.  In a spasm of lucidity, it dawned on me that this is the LAST parent I need to take on toe-to-toe about THIS subject.  First off, it is not my field of professional/educational expertise.  Secondly, there was nothing to be gained on the Right vs. Wrong front.  Third, and most importantly to my untenured future, I was not about to throw myself on the mat over my own religion and risk losing my job.  I had a house, I had a mortgage, I had dependents (even though they were four legged and furry), and it just did not make sense to place all that on the block, cause my furballs and my husband to become potentially homeless, and waste seven or more years flopping Whoppers waiting for my rights to be restored in Civil Rights Litigation.  

Hence, I am STILL not out to my students, except on rare individual occasions (I'm talking TWO in fourteen years) where there was no risk of them turning on me.  It is not fair to expect kids NOT to get extremely fired up over something as novel as ""my teacher is a witch,"" spread it all over the district, and catch a few parents up in the breeze as well.  And, by ""breeze,"" I mean WILDFIRE.   The longer I work there, the faster information travels among the student body.  They're not only phoning and IMing each other all night at home, they're text-messaging each other BETWEEN CAMPUSES all day!  

I LOVE my students.  Not only do I not want to engage in a miserable and painful process that could eventually cost me my job, I don't want ""my kids"" to have to see that happen to me.  As a teenager, I looked up immensely to most of my teachers.  To have played a part, even accidentally, in costing one of them their jobs or even careers, would have been DEVASTATING to me.  

My school district also has Administrators.  We have more principals and assistant principals than any school I'd ever heard of before I came here.  AND we have a school board that is often amazingly aware of what actually does go on in our building from day to day.  I never imagined that they did, really, but they actually do.  It's still unclear whether or not that's a good thing, but that's a different article.

The scenario that keeps me from posting my picture on my profile is the following.  One of the aforementioned teenagers (see previous rant) from my school district happens to visit Ask A Witch.  He or she talks to me in the room.  Whether or not he/she gets what he/she came for,  he/she also is struck by sufficient curiosity to take a look at my profile (or, I refer them to my home page via the URL on my profile).  Great Googly Mooglies!  That's my TEACHER!  The aforementioned rumor wildfire goes into action, and all hell (you should pardon the expression) breaks loose.  

The same thing could happen if the visitor's not a teenager.  I talk to many parents during Conferences, I occasionally meet them at school events, too.  They MIGHT remember my face.. a lot more easily than I'd remember theirs, even.  I'm photographed every year for the school yearbook.  If I were stupid enough to post a photo, I'd probably post one of those.  Worse yet, the visitor could be a school board member!  Or a building principal!  Any of them could look up yearbook photos and peg me in an instant, no matter what photo I used.  

However it got out, it'd go far.  I remember when a fellow faculty member was arrested and tried in three local counties for engaging in a sexual relationship (the law and I called it sexual abuse) with a minor (not one of our students).  The multi-suburban newspaper (one of those big but small newspapers, ya know) ate it up like peanuts at the ball park.  Of course, the big-city papers and the radio stations, etc, also gave it more than a casual nod.  

YES, I'm proud to be Pagan.  NO, I'm not ashamed to be a witch.  YES, I do believe the more of us that turn up as the productive, kindly, wonderful participants in society, the better for us all.  But.. and this is a big but... I do NOT believe that being ""out"" to my school district any time before my retirement speech is an option for me.  I have responsibilities up to my eyeballs that REQUIRE me to keep this job.  I would not presume to unilaterally choose a course of action that would render my husband homeless, his family (who are local and would also find out what they really don't wanna know) to reject him as well as myself, and get my big fat Irish mug into the local papers and into the public eye.  Of COURSE I would fight tooth and nail against dismissal; fortunately I've never been a bad enough employee to have anything else on my record that could endanger my tenure.  They'd HAVE to present the dismissal as a matter of religious prejudice, which I could take to Federal court.  My civil rights (assuming Bush hasn't shredded them in the interim) would hopefully be restored eventually, but for the seven or eight years it would take to get that to happen, I'd be hard pressed to find a replacement career.  No other school district in the state would touch me, and I'm certain that my sparkling personality and huge ass would NOT get me a career as a celebrity.  Nor would I count on the opportunity to be excoriated in the Public Eye as a means to effectively teach the public that discrimination against us is just stupid.  A witch does NOT get the same airtime on the evening news as the board members would.  

So.. that's the second reason I don't post my photo on my profile.  The third reason, which is actually the one that was on my mind when I began this rant (good Gods, how can I ever teach school with this Digression Problem?) is the Relative Hotness Discussion Phenomenon.  

I'm officially sick and tired of this part of the Chatroom World.  Regardless of gender, person 1 takes a look at the profile of person 2 and says, ""Wow, Moondripper, you never told me you're SO HOT!""  Person 2 then replies, ""I am not, I'm as ugly dog crap and don't you try and tell me different, Wolfbreath.  But YOU, on the other hand, are a mega hottie.""  ""Oh, no I'm not.  I'm ugly and always have been.""   And so it goes.  Then other fools jump in and view the profiles and air their opinions that one or the other (or both) of the combatants are indeed hotter than they say they are.  They expound on the danger to one's self-image occasioned by putting oneself down.  They argue and deny and squabble over compliments offered and rejected.  The number of exclamation points after ""I tell you, I'm UGLY!!!!!!!!"" becomes obscene.  I've watched these inane arguments go on for literally hours.  I'm serious.  TWO HOURS or more on whether or not Wolfbreath is a hottie.  What POSSIBLE benefit is occasioned by sucking up so much bandwidth for so long?  Personally, I don't log on to chat with your LOOKS.  I find it offensive to assume that anyone does.  The great thing about chat rooms is that people who look ALL SORTS of different ways can seek and find common ground together... or have marvelously satisfying discussions when they disagree.  NOT so they spend hours fighting for the possibility of bolstering each other's vanity.  That's just useless.

Well, that was my whole main idea for starting tonight's rant.. Maybe I'd have gone further with it if I'd gone right to that topic, but I'm all ranted out now.  Till next time.  Namaste."

"event","Hi, and welcome to my journal.  One day, I'll figure out how to make it a little more visually appealing, but for now, I get a break due to being a beginner.

I've mainly gotten this journal started to collect my thoughts about participation in ""Ask a Witch"" chat rooms.  I've been doing it since at least 1996, and I've learned a great deal about people as a result. 

Recently, and rather amazingly, I caught some crap from someone online, who doesn't even know me, regarding what I consider ""timesavers"" in my online profile.  They include the basic messages that A: I'm not open to requests from people in other paths that I read their religion's main book (Bible, Koran, whatever), B: I don't offer online readings, C: I don't give out spells, D: I'm not online to be chatted up, cybersexed, hooked up romantically, or connected by phone, voice or webcam with drooling internet masturbators.  It's not that I have any violent opposition against those who DO use the internet for those purposes.. it's a big internet, after all, with room for everyone... but it's not what I'm there for, nor do I plan for that to change.  This really bothered this guy.. he didn't like that I was projecting ""so much negativity"" and clearly it indicated I was NOT all that interested in ""gentle education of open minds"" as my profile states.  I thanked him for his recommendations on how I should run my life, then politely told him, in essence, to piss off.  

I have good reason for the ""don't waste your time"" provisos in my profile.  Since 1996, I have found that the largest wastes of my online time, and presumably (though it's not a concern to me personally) that of others, have been running off people whose goals where I am concerned involve A, B or C above.  Yes, there will always be those who don't bother with reading profiles, but those who do are given ample warning that I'm not disposed to those particular uses of my time.  The ones who pursue that stuff with me anyway, since I have POSTED a warning, are wide open to whatever barrage it may or may not suit me to issue at the time.  Compare it to the idiot who tries to push open the door to the store without reading the ""Sorry, we're closed"" sign.  Not the store's fault if their security camera picks them up and they are questioned for attempted robbery.  

I'm rather liking this format.  I get to do my most eloquent grousing without any nits being picked.  OK, to continue:

Maybe this isn't at all politically correct of me, but I'm going to start an anti-ethnic diatribe here.  If you're reading this and find such things objectionable, be ready to scroll down a ways.  I've decided that I am going to provide a joyous and cheerful kick in the kneecaps to WHOEVER it was that showed the Internet Cafes in the Middle East how much fun Yahoo! is.  What on earth is driving these Arab guys - from Egypt to Iran to Libya to wherever else they are - to get online and pester American and English and Australian women?  First and foremost, THEY DO NOT KNOW ENOUGH ENGLISH TO IMPRESS A LITERATE FEMALE WHO DOES.  Shit, they don't even know enough English to differentiate between masculine and feminine SCREEN NAMES.  They pester men, too!  Now, as a foreign language teacher, I'm the first person to appreciate the diversity of language, and to feel like smacking the ""Goddamnit, this is 'Merica, learn English!"" crowd.  I totally get that English is a bloody hard language to master, and that in face to face life, you don't discriminate about limited-English-proficiency.  But REALISTICALLY, how much can someone REALLY fascinate an American (or Aussie or UK) woman with their style, suavitude or whatever if they cannot say much beyond ""Hiiiiiiiiiii... i whant chat u.....we b fiends.""  That is NOT intriguing.  It is NOT enticing.  It would not make Rapunzel cream her jeans if she got the Internet hooked up to her tower.  The format is NOT conducive to impressing women by any means other than EXPRESSION VIA WORDS AND LANGUAGE.  In other words, if you don't speak some English, you're dead in the water, Mahmoud.  

Secondly, and this is the part I'm ashamed of.. I truly do suspect that some/many/most/all of them COULD seriously be seeking to wangle a free trip to the States, impregnate some stupid female (do they think any of us are NOT stupid?) and take a dual-citizen baby (or two, or more) back to their home country.  In this day and age when all Arabs fall under so much suspicion by the West, how can they possibly think they're so slick that we'll not catch on?  Goes back to my wondering if they really do think we're stupid.  Many Arab cultures oppose or limit the education of women, so perhaps they do think we haven't figured out that things like this do happen.  Or has ONE Arab guy managed to actually pull this off, and tell all his friends?  I can't help but think, if I were an Arab man, that I would at least try and peddle my wares where I could both be understood and welcomed.  Asking an American woman to get interested in an Arab guy, in this day and age, is about like asking a survivor of Auschwitz to date a Palestinian militant.  In short, HELLO?

Don't get me wrong.  I'm not a pro-Bush patriot.  I'm not a Homeland Security/Suck Up Everyone's Civil Rights person.  Totally the contrary.  I don't even like MYSELF for getting so peeved at this Arab Pestering trend.  But the real live picture in this country is that Arab folk are really suffering from mistrust and outright animosity due to the political situation over there, and the pervading anti-Western sentiment there.  I cannot see what sense it makes for Arab men to think that US women will be entranced by their ten words of English and (in some cases, I'm told) a webcam view of their genitalia.  They're not even exploiting the myth (or is it?) that all Saudis are rich and starting with ""Hi, I'm a Saudi oil heir, wanna talk?""  Even THAT would get them further than they're getting nowadays.  

I'm still seething about the Taliban's oppression of women in Afghanistan.  I know, despite the paucity of news coming from that battleground, that it's not entirely gone, and it's still using Osama's money to attack and kill OUR boys in hopes of regaining the control they once had over so many shattered souls.  In fairness, I don't see Afghan men coming online to schmooze us, but I'm aware that national boundaries are less important in that part of the world than religious groupings are.  I've no confidence in the odds that the schmoe who messages me is NOT sending donations to Al-Qaeda every week.  Yes, that's a sweeping generalization/prejudice, but there's no way to know whether or not such support is beaten out of them, willingly handed over, or what.  I do oppose the war in Iraq, and consider it a costly and horrible misuse of American resources for reasons that are STILL not honestly explained.  That, however, is not enough for me to consider sitting through twenty agonizing minutes with an Arab man online, watching him say, ""Hello, hi, hiiii, hello, you like visit egypt?"" and very little more.  I do believe in diversity and world brotherhood, but shit.. log on from Chile or somewhere, and I'll sit and talk to you.  

Ok, end of anti-ethnic diatribe.  Are you back?  Good.

Let's see, what else is showing up online that makes me want to kick people?  Oh, how about the teenagers?  Yes, some of them are absolutely fine.  They're doing nothing that their parents oppose, they're seriously seeking to learn the Craft, their questions are intelligent, they show the capacity to learn from their elders, they're fine.  But there are SO many others.  Obviously, I see many members of the LFOMP club (Let's Freak Out My Parents).  They are the children of parents they portray as devout, rabid or otherwise very strict Christians.  Somehow these kids think the ideal teen rebellion is to ""take up devil worship"" or what their parents consider satanism, in the form of witchcraft.  That'll fix em.  If not, I can use spells to MAKE them let me out on Friday nights.  Now, you warn these kids.  You tell them that, no matter what Silver Ravenwolf says, pursuing a change of religion, particularly one that your parents do not understand or support, is highly likely to bring about MOUNTAINS of preventable interpersonal anguish in the family.  It WILL be discovered, because teens are careless.. or they actually WANT the blowup on some unconscious level.  A pentagram falls out of a shirt front, and suddenly everyone is in tears.  Hell, that happens when a kid merely takes up with the wrong sort of boy/girlfriend.  Imagine finding out that your kid has been, for all you know, sleeping with Satan.  That's just mean.  Most parents, even if they suck at the art of parenting.. have at least fed you and housed you and dressed you in your Tommy Holesucker sweatshirts for more than a dozen years.. and for that alone, they deserve better than to be kicked in the spiritual shins.  Teen rebellion should be limited to crappy looking clothing and odd hair and rock band posters on the walls.  That's my view anyhow LOL... it's not necessary to gut your parents with something like this, just for the sake of premature individuation.  


Even more interesting are the kids who KNOW that their parents oppose such a course of study and they pester us to provide it anyway.  ""Why would you do this when you know how much it will upset your family?"" ""Well, because I really WANT to.""  Fuck you, spoiled tart... wait till you pay your OWN bills and break someone's heart.  Don't put your parents in the position of having to decide whether or not to ship you off to Aunt Gertrude's for the rest of your minor years.  Or military school, or psychiatric hospitalization, or convent school, or whatever other ideas come to them in desperation.  But no, I really want this, so you should ignore my parents as I am doing and give me clandestine religious instruction.  Hell no, kiddo.  If MY kids were doing that, not only would their computer go right out the bedroom window, they'd have to watch me sue whoever was legally responsible for this instruction being provided.  

Is this hypocritical? Perhaps.  But at their age, I didn't know any better either.  I learned about sex and contraception behind my parents' backs.  Saw no sense in telling them my cherry was gone.  I did have the good sense to lose it to another minor, though, which saved him from a misery had we been caught.  Fortunately, I did learn about contraception before things all went utterly to shit (thank you Lisa, the counselor, for lending me that copy of OUR BODIES, OURSELVES).  As far as today's kids go, could I possibly even consider that they'd have enough judgement to avoid things utterly going to shit as they diddle around with witchcraft?  No way.  There's a reason you don't drive till you're sixteen or drink till you're 21.  Common sense and judgement are not installed during prepubescence. And impulsivity and selfishness can create havoc when combined with spellcraft.  Intent is powerful. While one teen pregnancy could screw up several lives for a while... the right spell in the hands of the wrong impulsive, selfish teenager could create real harm.  AND Karmic rebound.  Of course, this assumes they actually DO pull together sufficient mental resources to actually do spellwork successfully.. but I couldn't really say whether or not the passion and singlemindedness of a misguided teen is more or less powerful than that of a ""mature"" adult with decent self control.  For all I know, they might be nitroglycerine to our gasoline. 

Let's see.. who else is out there? Oh, yes, the folks who cannot handle being told No.  Usually these are also teenagers.  Often the same wannabes who are determined to disobey parents and get what they want, without care or concern of anyone else's needs.  It usually goes like this:

*I want a love spell
**Not a chance, sorry.  Bad idea.  
*Y?  (they cannot even trouble themselves to spell out a 3-letter word, mind!)
** (relates Reasons 1, 2 and 3, which will likely be enumerated in a later entry)
* So u wont give me 1?
** That's right.
*U are not a real witch anyways 
*wannabe witches thats all you are
*your goin to hell. (Insert profanity and the rest of the Insult List)

Never mind the horrible language skills (which completely curdle my giblets).  The absolute pissers in those interchanges are that they A: can't handle No, even for really good reasons, which we don't REALLY have to give anyhow;  B: think that THEIR conclusion on our authenticity actually MEANS something (If they said, ""You're not a high school teacher,"" would I burst into tears? Stop going to work?) and C: they really have NOT been taught how a kid speaks to an adult (or they think that everyone online is their age).   WHO is parenting these children, and how do they TOLERATE that in their own homes?

Of course, there are also the Thumpers.  I don't really appreciate the way many of my peers insult and disrespect their Christian religion when we're witnessed at... I mean, they really, really go out of their way to disgrace themselves in that effort.  I simply don't find that necessary when we have the option to put them on Ignore.  However, my beefs against these ""soul savers"" are clear and definite.  First off, there are the abusive ones, who insult us and use all manner of vulgarity and references to bestiality to set up a combat zone.  How are we really supposed to believe that these folks came into an Ask A Witch chat room out of loving, genuine, Christian compassion and worry about our souls' fates in the afterlife?  They don't care where our souls go after we die; they're just taking advantage of their misbegotten belief that we are the last group of people (short of the Arabs) against whom abuse is socially permissible.  I don't respect that behavior in the least.  If you really want to make sure my individual, personal soul gets a cloud next to yours in Heaven, why be insulting and alienating and judgemental and rejecting toward me?  Hello?  If you run a restaurant and want me to come back again, you don't let me see you spit in my food.  

There are other thumpers who have the decency to at least pretend they don't want us to go to Hell.  They're so motivated by either today's sermon in church or their own abiding and devout love for their god that they will copy great, whacking Bible excerpts into the room, hoping we'll suddenly say, ""Hey!  We're barking up the wrong spiritual tree, here, Bill!"" and follow them back to a Christian room.  Or they'll tell us how worried they are about us ""doing the devil's work"" or ""living a life that rejects god and deals in sin.""  That is usually when the room bursts into flames and Jesus is suddenly portrayed as Hitler's soul brother or something.  These are the folks who wouldn't shut up even if they KNEW we had no devil and we're NOT living a godless, malicious life.  That's why they elicit so much abuse from the room.  I am always irritated by their assumptions that we're such awful people, but I understand that their pastors, their tv shows, their periodicals, all peddle this judgement of us, and they do, naturally, trust their own sources before ours.  That's human nature.  I trust the Defenders of Wildlife to tell me what's really going on in the Dept. of the Interior before I'll trust the President's explanation of their actions, after all.  So it doesn't do a whole lot to gently point out that they're operating off incorrect assumptions.  They won't hear it... it is contradictory to their teachings.  So they yammer on and on until they're insulted beyond all reasonable tolerance and/or ignored.  That's why my profile says ""gentle education of OPEN minds;"" there's so little point in trying to wedge any new information into a brain that's all full of Biblical Righteousness.  There's another aspect to this group that frosts my chaps, though.  Their own Bible.. and in fact the same apostle who COMMANDS Christians to do this tedious witnessing, writes that if their message is not received in a village they visit, they are to wipe the dust of that village from their feet and MOVE ON.  WHY, oh WHY, won't they DO that?  They seem to like the part where Paul tells them to be obnoxious, ubiquitous and never shut up; they don't like the part that says, ""If it's not working, it's not working.  Give up and shuffle off somewhere else where you might have better success.""  Oh, no.. they gotta keep carping.  God says so.  But I don't remember anywhere in the Bible where God said, ""Be thou rude and advertise Me in ways that make Me look desperate for new followers.  Be thou an embarrassment to Me in all things.""  I don't think I ever saw that. 

There are occasionally those Christians who really want to know why we left Christianity and became Pagans.  Maybe on some personal and unacknowledged level in their private heart of hearts, they're not entirely sure they LIKE living in the shadow of Needing Redemption to Be Okay.  Maybe they're not entirely happy being told how to believe about politics, gays, sex, abortion, or whatever.  Maybe they secretly suspect they'd ENJOY dancing nude in the woods around a bonfire under a full moon.  They're always relieved on a personal level that we're not devil worshippers/satanists/bad guys.  They seldom actually believe that we eat babies or sacrifice animals, but when we confirm that no, we do not, they're definitely pleased to be certain.  Some of them actually leave the room realizing that ""witch"" doesn't mean ""bad person.""  Those are the ones I really hope will tell two friends (or one pastor) that there is more to learn about us, and that we're not the evil and dangerous hags of lore.  Through them, we actually have a chance as Pagans to grow old NOT dodging torches and pitchforks wielded by angry villagers.  


Okay, it's 3:00 am here, on the last full day of 2004.  I think this is enough of a christening.. no, wait, wiccaning, for this new journal, so I'm going to shove off.  I'm looking forward to more spouting very soon.  Namaste."

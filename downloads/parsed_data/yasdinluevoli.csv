*Father, i'v got so much anger in me right now... i dont know why... please help me be a nice person and a happy person Lord.. help me be more like you... also Lord today i got this job and i know you wanted me to because it was so easy and i dident even have to do nothing... it was all you... tahnk you for that... i pray though Lord you forgive me for wasteing time... time it says in you'r word is something you will never get back and you need to use it for the good of you'r glory not the things of this world... but i thank you again father for being so mercyful.. help me father to be a servant for you and to dwell in you'r gloy all day long... tomorrow lord give me the strenth to go to school and help me not complane... please let me be an answer to somebodys prayer.. i love you so much God... thank you for listening... i love you pappa, Amen*

ah... i love God so much... i feel so much better writeing that.. see i dont understand how people say Gods not real... i just felt like 10000 things get off my back... it hurts me to see that people dont know him... i wish all my friends would be saved... i mean most my friends dont even belive in God... Mikey doesnt Billy doesnt.. lindsay says she doesnt but i know she does deep down.. but i pray for all my friends every night... and ill let God do what he does best... anyways.. thank you God for letting me feel better... and thank you journal for listening..."

"event","Well hello there journal... hah.. i havent talk to you months... i'v been back from camp now for quite some time... man.. camp was so great.. part of me not writeing to you is because of camp... i know if i write im also gunna read lindsay's journal... and i Feel that God is telling me that it is in a way of Gosip.... So im going to try not to read alot of her entries... i just scimed threw them.. man.. i seen were she said ""i wish i never had the baby aborted"".. i almost just started crying right then... thats so sad... i guess it's sad forme because i dont know why she doesnt think but i know there was a 50/50 chance that it was mine.. so it's just sad that i'll never know if i could of been a dad or anything.... I havent wrote in my journal in a while though theres so much stuff that has happen... i was just reading part of my entries were it says something like ""i cant wait for camp it's going to be such a great experiance.. i hope i get closer to God"".. and i just started crying.. because i live for God now and he changed my life so much since camp... i dont even cuss anymore... drink? forget about it... smoke? yeah right... all i want to do is tell my friends about God... the first day i got back i went to church and threw out the whole camp.. i felt like God tought me how to pray right? so i get home and im like mom bring me to church... it was sunday night church.. but i went there wanting to sing and worship and stuff... but i get there and it's still early people really arent there and i ask this girl whos standing there.. is there going to be music tonight.. and she said ""umm.. no i dont think so.. the singer is out of town or something"".. and i said to my self ""man that stinks..."" then she said ""yeah.. umm tonight going to be a prayer service... i felt so undecribeable.. because i knew it was God... after church i came home.. 2 of my best friends my band members came over and i was telling them about God.. me bryan baldanza was telling someone about God... telling them that i wasent going to cuss anymore... someone who cussed everyday.. i mean just look at my entries i cussed in everysingle one... i was telling them about God and stuff.. and after they left.. i fell on my nee's out side on my steps and started weaping... and i threw my hands in the air and said ""God use me.. Let me suffer for you please.. like you did for me"" with tears running down my face... God has changed my life so much i cant even explane it.. i dont remember the last time after camp that i listend to rap or anything but christian music on my own will... i live totally for God now.. it's unbeliveable.... Camp it self was great... we had this awsome speaker named Andrian he was the best.. so funny and just made you want to listen to him.. made you think to.... we'd go listen to him 2 times a day for like 2 hours and i wanted more.. i would some times not eat dinner or fast dinner and go to the prayer thing befor the  main church started at night.. we would pray for the service befor it started that God will touch peoples lives.. and open there eyes and hearts to let them see what they are doing and to follow him... but doing that it just made you feel so much closer to God.. and that you could just sit there talking to God you'r self... you can do that anywere.. but at that moment it was great... everyone would just pray and then theyd stop and someone else would go.. i wanted to go like 100 times.. i prayed outloud twice though... One night at night service.. andrain took this big like bush thing and told everyone in the church to take a twig off it and walk up to the frunt and just pray and crush the twig or something like that.. but allen katies boyfriend.. like jumped out of his seat and was like the first one to get up... i got up behind him and went down and took a peice and went to a bench on the side and nelt down... and i seen allen in the bench above me like crying. and i wanted to go up there and like put my arm around him and stuff but i dident.. so i got up and went over to him and just nelt down next to him.. and hes the one who put his arms around me and started praying so i put my arms around him and we both started to cry asking God to forgive us of all our crap in our life.... so it was really cool that he wasent scared of what i would of thought if he put his arms around me... we bonded after that like we knew each other forever... we got bunks together.. befor all this.. but it just seemed like we were ment to be friends.. we would just lay in bed.. him on top of the bunk and me on the bottom and there was this little crack.. because the bunk was on the wall.. and he would face his head torwd the crack and i'd be looking up and we talked about everything.. for so long.. like 2 hours... and at the end.. he would stick his hand down the crack and i'd grab his hand and we would pray... i grew so closer to God because of allen.. he was like my only and ever christian friend.. who i could talk to about God and not be like worried that he might say something or something in the sort... me and allen grew so close together that by the end of the trip we had inside jokes, hand shakes hah.. kaite was actually mad at both of us.. like seriously mad because she said we were leaveing her out... because i told her we talked every night and i wouldent tell her what about.. and most of it was about her.. but i just dident feel like i had to tell her.. it was mine and allen's bonding... but yeah hah she was mad at us.. on the ride home from camp because we were laughing and stuff and shes like what you guys laughing at and we just looked at her and started laughing again.. funny stuff... but i'd say we all grew closer to gether at camp and most of all closer to God.. i have a relation ship with Jesus now... i can talk to him anytime of the day and he listens.. i know he does because i feel him.. all the time... when im at church singing and stuff.. i just want to jump up and down screaming at the top of my lungs for God......... gosh.. so much since i had last writin...... oh yeah yesterday i went to the movies with lindsay and her friend kim, tina, her boyfriend, and some kid that smelt haha.. it was weird hanging out with lindsay.. it dident feel weird.. that was the weird part.. i felt like everything was coo... i mean why wouldent it be.. we sat next to each other in the movies it was cool i just wish she wasnt scared to like lean on me.. i wasent going to try anything... i just.. i dunno i guess i need effction.. not like kiss, hump effection.. but just like cuddle effection.. from anyone... i mean by the end of the movie we were kinda snuggeld.. heh.. anyways... she has a boyfriend.. but she says she doesnt like him really.. but thats weird because why would she go out with him.. i dunno i wanted to talk to her about it when she was driveing me home from the movies but i dident feel like interveining on her life... i just feel that maby they shouldent be bf/gf but like friends or something.... i dunno... i hope things go well for her.... well journal.. i'v been going to bed the past few nights around 4.. so im going to try and go to bed earlyer toinght... because tomorrow im going to a interview at publix... maby be a cashier or something.. get some doh... well im going to end this journal and everyother journal with a prayer to God for now on...

""And it all falls downnn"" :`(0   ... it was good while it lasted, i dont regret anything, and if you're still mad at me, fine.. but i wasent leaveing upset... you're life is ahead of you.. but i will always remember you, probly till the day i die,................ no hard feelings on my part, cya around....."

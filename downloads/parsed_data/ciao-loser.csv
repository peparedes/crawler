"event","The story of man
Makes me sick
Inside, outside,
I don't know why
Something so conditional
And all talk
Should hurt me so.

I am hurt
I am scared
I want to live
I want to die
I don't know
Where to turn
In the Void
And when
To cut
Out

For no Church told me
No Guru holds me
No advice
Just stone
Of New York
And on the cafeteria
We hear
The saxophone
O dead Ruby
Died of Shot
In Thirty Two,
Sounding like old times
And de bombed
Empty decapitated
Murder by the clock.

And I see Shadows
Dancing into Doom
In love, holding
Tight the lovely asses
Of the little girls
In love with sex
Showing themselves
In white undergarments
At elevated windows
Hoping for the Worst.

I can't take it
Anymore
If I can't hold
My little behind
To me in my room

Then it's goodbye
Sangsara
For me
Besides
Girls aren't as good
As they look
And Samadhi
Is better
Than you think
When it starts in
Hitting your head
In with Buzz
Of glittergold
Heaven's Angels
Wailing

Saying

We've been waiting for you
Since Morning, Jack
Why were you so long
Dallying in the sooty room?
This transcendental Brilliance
Is the better part
(of Nothingness 
I sing)

Okay.
Quit.
Mad.
Stop."

Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?
Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy.
Why lovest thou that which thou receivest not gladly,
Or else receivest with pleasure thine annoy?
If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,
By unions married, do offend thine ear,
They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds
In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear.
Mark how one string, sweet husband to another,
Strikes each in each by mutual ordering,
Resembling sire and child and happy mother
Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing:
Whose speechless song, being many, seeming one,
Sings this to thee: 'thou single wilt prove none.'

"event","Top Ten Reasons Why Sex Is Better Than School
10.... Everbody likes sex and nobody likes school,except for virgins and only because they havent had sex yet. 
9.... Sex sucks, moans, licks, pumps, throbs etc... School just sucks. 
8.... After sex you feel like smoking a cigarette. After school you feel like smoking something a whole hell of a lot stronger. 
7.... You only get disciplined during sex if you want to. 
6.... Drinking drives people to sex, where as school drives people to drink. 
5....Sex relieves stress. School is the cause of stress. 
4.... Nothing beats the hands on experience you get with sex. 
3.... After sex you feel like you have accomplished something. 
2.... Sex is cheaper. Even if you have to pay for a hooker, it is still cheaper than paying thousands of dollars in tuition.
And the Number 1 reason why sex is better than school is........ 
1.... At least you have a choice whether or not you want to have sex. At school your teachers screw you regardless."

She will be missed, it will be sad, but never forever

She walked away, she had no choice, but just for a little bit

She weeps for the one she loves, it gnaws at them both, but that is love

Always will she have someone, wither it is the one she loves truely or the one that draws a friendlier love

She sings her sad song for now, but only for a fleeting moment in the spectrum of eternity.

Why am I letting this affect me so in the first place? It's because she basically accused me of lieing to my mom... I don't/can't lie to her. My mom is like a good friend to me. We're so close, so when she asked how the field trip was, I told her what I thought of it. The good and the bad. True it was mostly bad but that's because of how I saw it. For an optimist to go and find something like that bad and what not... I mean, it really was a sad trip. She kept wanting me to apologize basically for what my mom said. The only thing I said sorry for was that my mom had said it like that. That it might have been a miscommunication or something like that. I can't believe my mom would write her an email though and not tell me so that I can atleast be prepared... i mean sure I found out yesterday, but when I had tried talking to my mom, she would blow me off... Arg, sorry, I'm going to go vent out some how... Eh, maybe working on cars will help. I doubt, but oh well.

Read this CAREFULLY!!

Step One
- Make a post (public, friends locked, filtered...whatever you're comfortable with) to your LJ. The post should contain your list of 10 holiday wishes. The wishes can be anything at all, from simple and fandom-related (""I'd love a Snape/Hermione icon that's just for me"") to medium (""I wish for _____ on DVD"") to really big (""All I want for Christmas is a new car/computer/house/TV."") The important thing is, make sure these wishes are things you really, truly want.

- If you wish for real life things, make sure you include some sort of contact info in your post, whether it's your address or just your email address where Santa (or one of his elves) could get in touch with you.

- Also, make sure you post some version of these guidelines in your LJ, or link to this post so that the holiday joy will spread.
&nbsp;
<BR>Step Two
-Surf around for your friends list (or friends' friends, or just random journals) to see who has posted their list. And now here's the important part:

- If you see a wish you can grant, and it's in your heart to do so, make someone's wish come true. Sometimes someone's trash is another's treasure, and if you have a leather jacket you don't want or a gift certificate you won't use

-You needn't spend money on these wishes unless you want to. The point isn't to put people out, it's to provide everyone a chance to be someone else's holiday elf--to spread the joy.

-There are no rules with this project, no guarantees, and no strings attached. Just...wish, and it might come true. Give, and you might receive. And you'll have the joy of knowing you made someone's holiday special.

<STRONG><U>My Boring Wishes</U></STRONG>

1. To finally be myself
2. To see an old friend
3.&nbsp;A hug, a REALLY good&nbsp; meaningful hug
4. To go to another concert
5. A good book
6. Some weird band CD, don't really care what type of music
7. A kangaroo stuffed animal
8. Any seasons of Zim
9. A postcard
10. To figure everything out with Monique

World Peace would be up there but everyone should know that already

"event","Alrighty, I'm having a dilema... The Slipknot/Slayer concert is coming up, it's on the 29th. it's pretty close too. see but there is one BIG BIG BIG problem... the tickets are 45.30 euros... :( I don't mind paying it, hell to go see them I'd probably pay more. See, Slayer has been my alltime favorite band since... I don't even know when. and then Slipknot, is like right next to them. So for them to be playing together is like a dream come true for me. that and as sad it is to hear, it would be my first REAL concert. and well... i can't think of anything better! josh says no cas it's too ""violent"" but i don't care!!! i WANT to get all bruised and sore and just Ahhh... :( oh well. see so here's the problem transportation!! See i was hoping that someone would be going, but see, since it's so expensive i don't think that many people will, and so it makes things alot more difficult. :( I don't wanna push it, cas when i do things don't usually work out, but i really really really wanna go... so please tell me what you think... is this a lost cause, me trying to go, or should i keep working at it?? well thanks bye bye"

"event","Alrighty, I need to update. It's been a while, umm, i guess i should say whats been happening lately. Umm... school started, it's been interesting, met some new kids. and some hip kids moved into my town but i'm too lazy to even try and figure out where they live, plus they'd probably end up moving by the time i did find them! wee? or not. but their names are alex (moniques friend from alabama) and Rob. Meh. AcDc is a grand band. well my weekend was kinda fun, i gotta go see my bestesetestestest friend Sam, saturday, and watch her play volleyball, bought some movies, then came home. sunday didn't really do anything, just went to mikes and finished my halloween costume (I thought it was gonna take longer than it did) oh here's a pic! http://www.amybrownart.com/images2_c02/originals/divas/naughty.jpg Weee. It looks pretty much just like that. Eek. Hmmm, Homecomings soon, I was gonna go with Whitney but i don't know if she's still gonna go. oh well. I can just stay home like always if not. Umm... I lost my mind yesterday, either that or i've just been hanging out with jenna WAY too much, cas i was bored and listening to launch, and some country came on and i actually knew some of the words and what not! i felt so ashamed! :( there's nothing wrong with country, it's just... I can't believed i listened to it. ahh oh well, i promise i won't do that again! twas kinda scary. Anyways. I think i'm gonna go to the park or something... Soooooo bored!!!! have any suggestion?? i'd be much obliged, if ya did. Meh

Frankie!

Seems like in my anxiousness to get the new show started I've missed a lot.

Including Miss O's birthday!  How could she not have mentioned it I'll never know, but I'm upset with her.  My very best friend and she doesn't even let me do something nice for her on her birthday!

Now I have to think of something to make it special.  Late, but still.


I've heard Kost is not doing well.  I want to do something, but I don't know what.  *sigh*

*picks up a present sitting on the bed*  I open the card- love Giselle.

A tie.  For the act.

*grins*

Sweet.

Well I heard some whispers about <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/freudenmadchen/"">Kost</a>'s parents.  I can't imagine <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/freudenmadchen/28370.html?#cutid1"">losing</a> both of them so close together.  Well if it were me, I probably wouldn't care, but I hear she cared for <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/freudenmadchen/28808.html"">her mother</a>.

Poor thing.  Maybe I'll take her some chocolates since I have a little extra money laying around.

Oh?  You don't know about the extra money?

Well I got in an argument with that utter brute Eric.  It's not my fault he couldn't get it up!  I did try, so I figure he at least owes me ten marks for effort right?  Does he give it to me?  Oh he gave me something alright, <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/community/kit_kat_klub/61965.html"">a shove down the stairs, a black eye and a sore throat</a>.

That bastard.

And who <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/community/kit_kat_klub/61965.html?thread=1024269#t1024269"">comes to my rescue</a>?  <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/ever_fuckable/"">Adam</a>!  Adam of all people; I'm still amazed.  He paid Eric 75 marks for me and I ... took care of any needs he needed satisfying.

Well when I got home Giselle told me she hated seeing me like this and that she knew a man who would give us money if <a href=""http://momentsintime.0catch.com/amnorda246.jpg"">we posed</a> for some pictures for him.

So I'm rich!  Rich I tell you!  Ok not rich, but comfortable.  And I'm paying Adam back, don't ask me why, but I am.

So I'm off to Ophilia's to see if he's there, check on O and then I'm on my way to the club.

Maybe I'll run into Leon or Danny, but probably not, haven't seen much of them lately.

Oh me and Dolores have come to a <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/spanish_rose/19574.html"">truce</a> of sorts.  She explained to me about Kost and I understand.

I mean hey we all have demons right?

I haven't seen Danny in awhile, I even went to the club thinking maybe I'd run into him but I <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/community/kit_kat_klub/59418.html?thread=985114#t985114"">did see Ophilia</a>.  I'm so glad I saw her that night.  I may not be much to anybody but I can be her friend.  And I will be no matter what.  Anybody ever says anything about O and I'll ... I'll knock their block right off!

Anyway after I skipped a show and spent some time with O we headed downstairs and that damn Danny still hadn't shown.  Eh, so I went on and I saw O talking to some guy.  Well he turns out to be Danny's uncle Leon.  Oh I like this man.  I really do.  Charming as a snake and free with the whiskey and his money.  He can come by anytime he likes.

Oh and the maestra is pregnant!  By our Herman!  *gasp*  I was so surprised!  But I'm happy for him.

There's this crazy rumour going 'round that Kost and Adam got stuck in an elevator- naked!  *laughs* I'll have to ask Danny as he seems to be the hero in all of this.

Or maybe I'll simply ask Leon.  But then again you can never be to sure whether he's telling the truth or not.

He's kinda sweet though.

After that disasterous attempt of seduction with Dolores I suppose I've been feeling old and well ... unattractive.

Maybe it's Herr Groo, telling me what a good wife I'd be, putting all these thoughts of a normal life in my head.

Hmmph, what's normal anyway?

Herr Groo isn't old, he isn't young, but he's nice.  I mean just a nice man.  With a wretched wife who married him simply to get out of her house.  Many times he stays and talks to me.  He's lonely, but not like most of the men I meet.  It's like his soul is haunted by what could have been.

And now he's got me thinking what could have been if my father hadn't ...  no I will not think about it.

Now Danny with his quick smile and kind words, he's another matter. It seems all the girls have it for him and I'm starting to see why.  He came off as a jerk when I first met him, well and that whole Giselle thing ... but he's actually pretty nice.

And he did get me nearly triple with George the other night. *smiles at the memory*  Yes, he's definately a good way to keep certain customers jealous.

I try to do the same for her.  I buy her perfume or a scarf but I don't know what she thinks of it.

I've been seeing this new man, name is Herr Groo and he likes to do things for me.  He's a giver.  He wants to brush my hair, bath me, or just take care of me like I'm a child or doll or something.

But it's different when Zell does it.

I want to know if she feels like I buy her things because she's here; because it's my job to make her happy or because I care?  Because I do care.

I'm getting in one of those moods.  Those dark, I want to drink too much kind of moods and I don't want that to happen.

I hate him.

I see these men, like Herr Groo, and he has a wife at home but she won't do somethings for him and I can't believe it.  here is this wonderful man willing to do anything for her and she doesn't realize how lucky she is.

So we found a couple nice boys and danced and played with them but in the end I went home to Giselle.

So I was telling him about my and O's problem and he offered to assist us!  Wheeeeeeeeeeee.

So the next night I brought O upstairs with me.  I think at first she was a little put off by the host, but really, how can you not love him?

Some more than others.

Oh hell.  I care.  A <i>little</i> bit.

So I went shopping.  Had to put on a nice dress, so as not to get tossed out of some of the family establishments.  Which was hilarious as I had serviced many of the owners of these stores.  Eh, it's ok.  When wifey wasn't looking I got a discount.

Oh when I went to leave presents at the club I discovered ... those bastards left me gifts.

Damnit.

Herman- <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/community/kit_kat_klub/44803.html?#cutid3"">a poem</a>.  And ... and he didn't mention my breasts once in it. 

Ophilia- that bitch got me and Zell beautiful lockets.  Damn her...

Lulu- left food.  Good food ... As stunning as she is, I'm glad she's not my woman, I'd be fat in no time.

Helga gave out perfume that doesn't make me smell like a German whore!  Love it! Damned little brat.

Sally, Sally Sally ... always thinking of the Klub got us stockings.  Personally I think they look best on the floor, but that's probably because that's where Zell likes them ...

After all of that, I had to go to my dressing room so they wouldn't see my tears.  Damn them.

Oh but the presents I bought ...

I got <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=spanish_rose"">Dolores</a> a corset!  I did.  It's black with a red rose that sits right between her perfect breasts.  I <i>had</i> to get it! 
For <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/on_the_side/"">Frenchie</a> and <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=lulu_mein_herr"">Lulu</a> I bought naughty postcards and some perfume. I saw the most darling suspenders (men's over the shoulders) and got them for <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=call_me_frankie"">Frankie</a>.  I hope she likes them. For <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=kleptotart"">Fritzie</a> (what to get for the girl who can get whatever she wants?)  I found a skirt with hidden pockets in it.  To protect your valuables from thieves.  *laughs*   Sharing a love of books with <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=little_helga"">Helga</a> I got her selected poems of the American- Robert Frost.   I wasn't sure what to get <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=funny_herman"">Herman</a>.  It seems as though whenever someone needs him, he's there... so I got him a record.  It's called <i>Me and My Shadow</i> by Al Jolson. <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=mayfair_sally"">Sally</a> ... shopping for Sally was interesting.  Went in a shop and said, ""Give me all the offbeat nail polish colors you have.""  Our dear <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=your_host"">Emcee</a> ... if he were here I know what I'd give him, but of course he's not here.  So he has some cigarettes and a glass jar of Vaseline; since he's so fond of self love.  My male friends tell me it's quite handy when they are alone and in need of ... release.  Hope he understands ... eh, if not he can use it to soften his skin or make things a little <i>easier</i> next time he has a male overnight guest. For <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=_o_philia"">O</a>, I got an Oriental jade pendant- well it looks jade. I left little trinkets for the others.

And then there's <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=sweet_giselle"">Giselle</a>.  I didn't know what to get for her.  How to express how much she ... I talked this darling man into buying me a mink ... it's gorgeous.  It will look wonderful around Zellie's shoulders.

After my lovely evening with O, I come home to a very drunk and pissed off <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=sweet_giselle"">Giselle</a>.  She likes her new life.  Well good for her.  I didn't ask her for the extra money, or presents or anything!  She acts like I owe her something.  Well I don't.

She moved out that day.

I have seen her since then, we had a wonderful <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/sweet_giselle/9626.html"">row</a> at the club.

If it weren't for <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/funny_herman/"">Herman</a> <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/sweet_giselle/9626.html?thread=65690#t65690"">intervening</a>... I don't know what would have happened.

I did go on that night and perform, and I've stayed away from the bottle lately.  I'm going to be ok.

I am.

I think.

Giselle is now on me about my drinking.  Fuck her.  I'm sure she understands that.  So I told her she's a little whore.  Or something to that effect.  I'm not really sure, that night is a bit fuzzy in my brain.

My dear friend, <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=_o_philia"">O</a> is nowhere to be found.  Probably slumming with that Kost and Dolores.

Helga... I'm too tired to get involved.  Why bother?  She doesn't care.

Oh I'm feeling so sorry for myself.  *takes another drink*

Lula- I thought we were going somewhere, instead she picks up and goes to Paris.

Giselle and her, 'Oh the host isn't going to be pleased with this... he won't be pleased with that.' Well you know what? Fuck him!
Fuck them all.

I don't care about them.

None of them.

Bunch of sewer rats the lot of them.

It was a mistake to get involved with her.  I knew she would end up hurt.  So here I am, in hiding.

It's not love.  Not like what Giselle is feeling, or what Herman feels for the Maestra.  It's a connection though.  A bond.  I'll never forget her.  

When these days are gone and I'm old and wrinkly and I've forgotten the rest of them. There will be Ophilia.

Oh now I've gone poetic.  *sits my glass down*

No more drinking.

These people; all of them have shown me so much kindness.
A strange sort of love unlike any I've ever known.

Emcee taking me in, Herman, Helga, Lulu, Frenchie, Sally, Danny, Giselle- all of them.  Maybe I should go.  I don't like caring!

Wondering about Frankie.
Worrying abou Giselle.
Tiptoeing around the Emcee.
Interfering trying to get Herman and the Maestra together.

When did I start caring!?

Why can't I stop?

Everyone has a crush on him!  How could they not?  He's smart and shy but charming and sexy...

The <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/funny_herman/11752.html"">other night</a> I found him stumbling around and helped him to bed.  No not in that fun way either.  

Eh, love's not in the cards for me anyway.  <i>Although sometimes I wonder what it's like...</i>

There's another <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=freudenmadchen"">working girl</a> hanging about the club now.  I haven't met her yet... I don't know how I feel about having to share.

<lj user=""little_helga""> has been eating these eisstocks all week... everytime a drop runs down her delicate arm I want to lap it up...  *sigh*  

What's wrong with me!?  First I'm corrupting <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=sweet_giselle"">Giselle</a> and now I'm thinking about <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=little_helga"">Helga</a>!

I would go visit <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=miss_kisa"">Kisa</a> for some fun but she has her sister with her.

At least <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/your_host/"">the Emcee</a> is always up for a little fun.

Back in my room I think the churning in my stomach is worry over Giselle, how I don't want her to be like me.  But no, it wasn't worry.

I've caught whatever was going around.

My body aches, my head is spinning and I just don't want to be bothered.

Oh Helga is feeling better and I was looking forward to maybe taking her out to dinner (as friends) but her friend Mary came to visit.  It seemed as though I saw even less of her then.

Poor <lj user=""klaviermusik""> has been locked away in her room saddened from the recent loss of a dear friend of hers.  She wouldn't come out for anything, I hoped she was eating.  Herman has been so worried.  I caught him playing a melecholy song last night.  I was about to offer some <i>comfort</i> when <lj user=""klaviermusik""> showed up.  I hope things are better for them, even if it's only for a little while.

I'm afraid that if it does work out for them that poor <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/sweet_giselle/"">Giselle</a> will be heartbroken.  She's quite taken with our <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/funny_herman/"">Herman</a>

Since she's been gone I've had some time to do some thinking, <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=your_host"">the Emcee</a> is right, she will find out soon enough.  I don't have anything to be ashamed of.  I only did what I've had to do to survive.  
*exhale*
When she returns we're going to have a talk.  I'd rather she hear it from me.

<lj user=""miss_kisa""> and <lj user=""miss_marie""> have been kind enough to keep her busy while I thought things through.

I certainly hope not- sweet <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=funny_herman"">Herman</a> will be so sad without her around.  <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/on_the_side"">Frenchie</a>'s mother was in some sort of accident and she's been away caring for her.  And poor <lj user=""little_helga""> is sick.  I hear her coughing all day long.  I tried to purchase some chicken soup from an old man in the market, but he looked at me and tried to triple the cost.  

In happier news...

<a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=funny_herman"">Herman</a> <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/funny_herman/8974.html"">had an erotic dream about me...</a> Since Helga is sick (as if I need that excuse) I was thinking I would stop over and visit his room tonight, see what comes up.  Ahh and I mustn't forget <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=your_host"">Emcee</a>, he's likely to also want to try to <i>decipher</i> Herman's dream, since he was in it as well.

She was so kind as to take me in.  So in a way it was a blessing because I have friends. Real friends.

And we have all moved to a bigger flat, you should have seen us carrying things, pushing shoving conjoling... begging.  Begging furniture to get thru the door!  How sad is that?

Ooh <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/~your_host"">the emcee</a> paid us, which was wonderful, but to be honest- just between you and me and the post... I wonder how he got the money, he was so distant when he returned.  I've seen that look before.  I've seen it in the mirror.


Lots of new arrivals!  So many, too many to mention.  *waves at Kisa and Frankie (adorable... simply adorable!) and all the others.

Poor <lj user=""little_helga""> has been feeling useless- I have some uses for her, but I don't think she fancies me.  Good news- she can cook!  We'll have to get together for a tasty meal after the money starts pouring in...
She's a sweet kid.

Ooh and we have a new girl!  <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=lulu_mein_herr"">Lulu</a>. I haven't met her yet.

Ahh today I decided to <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/community/kit_kat_klub/1945.html"">test out a couple little ditties on stage.</a>  

That's me a busy little bee...

"event","A conversation with Steve from Vellocet Drive has me thinking more about amps.

I went to Kosmic Sound and played through a Mesa Boogie Rectifier. The sales assistant, named Alex (guitarist from Pathogen) explained how a Triple Rectifier isn't necessary because it only has the wattage boost on the Dual Rectifier, and unless you're going to run like four 4x12"" cabs off of the one head, then that wattage isn't necessary, especially when power from a Valve Amp is much more than from a solidstate despite what the wattage says. A 50w valve amp has the same guts as a 150w solidstate amp. So the Dual rectifier which is 120w would be more than enough. Thats $4200 brand new. Although the Mesa Boogie Dual Rectifier Road King caught my attention. Holycrap that is -the- amp. You can adjust everything. You can even select which valves go to which channels (of the 4 channels) and can then put different valves in to get different sounds on each channel. And you can select how the valve is dealt with (silicon or... I forget the other setting) and get it to send a different sound to each speaker on the cabinet. That would give so much grunt, having slightly varied distortion coming through each speaker. That would blast your face off.

So, as much as Mesas have my attention, Steve mentioned a few different things. He mentioned how Mesa's don't 'cut' through in a mix. What he means is that Mesas may sound freakin awesome on their own, but put it in with another guitar, and a bass guitar, and drumming, and vocals, and that guts isn't anywhere near as prominent. He referred to Marshall's being very underrated because although they don't sound spectacular on their own, they're made in the right frequency range to fill the frequencies they need to, between bass and vocals kind of thing. Except, I really don't want a Marshall. There's something about them... yeh.

So, Steve almost mentioned choosing your priority and searching for it, ie: clean, or distortion, and what kind of that. Because you can't get an amp that does everything right. I was thinking of my priority, and I think its distortion, because I could imagine that for the ideal set up I'd one day get a Vox AC30, or a Fender Twin to cover the clean, coz they do it so well. So then, its possible that Mesas aren't right for my distortion taste. There's also the Peavey 5150, Diezel (which I know I can't afford), and others. I want to research the badcats amp that Steve does, but no-one in perth can you play one in a store. Cog uses Mesas, and they come through well. Dark Tranquillity which has a sensational distortion sound uses Rocktron preamps, but I'd rather a head alone than a rack amp (except that you can get rack amps for cheap off Ebay... hmm... I should check that out), and they also use Peavey 5150s. The disadvantage with Peaveys is that they have 2 channels, and don't have a solo boost. Mesa's have 3 and a solo boost (a switch which increases the volume when you need the guitar to stand right out).

He also spoke of choosing an amp to suit the band, with questions like: How much of the bass frequency is loaded with the bass, ie - do you need a bassy sounding guitar amp or not. And then its different if you're playing with 2 guitars or just one, because with 2, you need to vary to compliment each other, and with 1 you need to fill up as much as you can on your own. With that said, I know I'll probably need to prepare for one guitar, because I have yet to find a second guitarist to pair up with. Distortion would be my priority, and I would want to get an amp that would do that really well, and load up those necessary frequencies. As I don't know what bassist I would work with, I'd need to get an amp that would work well with or without good bass frequencies. Of course, I'd want it to be great with awesome bass frequencies, so that I wouldn't need to get a different amp once I find the ideal bassist and they invest in an awesome amp, but I wouldn't want to rely on their bass to support my amp if my amp is lacking in the bass area. Its hard to explain.

So, I'm still thinking of Mesa Boogies dual rectifier, but need to scan through some other amps. Biggest thing I noticed with the Mesa, apart from the raw grunt of that distortion, was how good the treble pickup sounded! On my Gibson Les Paul, through my crappy marshall stack, I stay on rhythm all the time coz the treble is thin and feeble, but on the Mesa, that Gibson's treble pickup was piercing. It was lovely.

The end for now."

"event","Thankyou. Thankyou. Thankyou.

Out of the blue, my soundcard is working once more. I can record again. Recently, I've bought closed ear headphones for $70 and 10 metres worth of extension on them. Basically, I can listen to the prerecording on the computer through the headphones, whilst recording drums, and the drum mics won't pick up the sound. I was worried, that with 10 metres extension, I'd lose so much volume, that I'd need a headphone amplifier. But whoa! It gets so loud!! This sound card puts out a LOT of volume. I'm wondering if the headphones socket is already amplifier hugely. 

So now with Cubase LE working well again, I've discovered some new functions. On my search to fixing the problem, I came across some of the features of Cubase. Its SO WELL MADE! It can do everything! I'm totally impressed with all the functions it has. TOTALLY impressed. Its unreal. It even supports video input! That means that you can display video whilst working on the audio line so that you can time the music or sound effects with the video. Thats what you need to create music scores for full length movies, or even sound effects and catchy songs that go in time with tv adverts. Thats what I want to do, one day. Put out an advert for anyone who wants to create a TV advert, where I'll write and record them a little musical jingle to go with the ad. This equipment I have has got the appropriate quality to do that.

I've moved my drum kit into a different corner of my room, coz in the far corner, the 8m planet waves XLR mic extensions weren't able to reach the computer. Now they do. I've cabled tied all 7 cables and gaffer-taped them to the ground so I can close the doors to both my bedroom, and my music room, and still have the cords connected. This makes me happy!

But something that makes me even happier is this: I got the mic!! A rode NT-2A studio condensor. DAMN its heavy. It looks great though. Its got 3 switches on it, that allow me to adjust the polar pattern to omni, cardoid, or figure 8, lets me adjust the bass frequency response cut (no response, 3dB reduction below 40hz, or 3dB reduction below 80hz), and a pad which can damped the input from nothing, 5dB or 10dB, which prevents mic-gain distortion troubles before the signal even gets to the mic preamp. The mic itself is so heavy, and looks so professional. I got it through Ebay for $450 and its worth $850 brand new. And it is brand new!! Seeing as its a Rode mic, I thought I'd call it Rocky (get the pun? hehe!). This is what it looks like.

"event","So, while I'm in the posting mood:

I've been discovering the Major Scale recently. I've never been fond of it before. It always felt as though happiness was a simple, and straight forward emotion, lacking in intensity. Well, I'm more referring to the musical side. The extent of the happiest music you could get was fast and poppy and almost cheesy. It seemed to me as though it was severely lacking in... yeh, as I said - intensity.

But I've always loved the minor scale. It just feels deeper, and could be expressed so many ways, with so many different presentations of the appropriated energy. I'm discovering new things about the minor scale every day, of course - relationships between notes, and chord progressions that lend to a certain feel. Lately, though - I've been exploring the major scale. The scale itself really doesn't excite me, when playing notes from it as a lead. But chord progressions following those notes.... my goodness! It opened up a whole new zone. The 4th and 5th of a note are the same for a major or minor scale, and are used ALL THE TIME in poppy-ish happy songs. But, I found that if you avoid them and use the other notes that are from the major scale only, playing chords rooted on that note, and occasionally blend in those chords that are in both, then - you can get an unbelievably heart-wrenching sound. Jeff Buckley uses it often.

I've noticed that this is the key to what is often known as 'worship'. Yes, it can be a terribly indescript title for a genre, but its the best we've got to describe it. There is something soaring that can be found in the major scale, if used in this fashion. Its really quite beautiful - something I hadn't noticed until recently. And then there's the option of taking a song that uses the major scale and makes something quite dark out of it. Take Placebo for example. Many of their songs are in a prominent punk-rock major scale, but Brian Molko isn't singing about happy things. It lends these songs a strange feeling of, well... i can't explain it.

Bah, I'm losing the juice to write this post. I think I'll go now and write some more stuff in this so-called 'major scale'"

"event","Why does headbanging feel so good?! Got the new Karnivool Album: Themata, and i'm loving it. I've seen them live 4 times, and am thoroughly impressed. Duck introduced me to Drew, who I've been watching closely all 4 times. He's an excellent musician. I think (but aren't sure) he played drums on the album aswell. Coz the drummer of the band isn't in the booklet at all, and I know Drew got into Waapa on his first try at percussion, or something.

Their Album is great. It catches a lot of life, though it has a little too much compression on the vocals, it seems. I've noticed that is something that is done a lot of the time in recordings. It catches the vocal energy, and really throws it out there, but at the same time it drains the human feel from the vocals slightly. Everything is almost too clear, and at times, vocals need to be messy. Thats what makes it real. Love Outisde Andromeder has FAR too much compression. The vocalists voice, although very nice, stands out a little too silkily above everything else - too clearly. Compression is also very, very common in pop.

I remember talking to Owen (Hopwood) who was telling me about Matchbox 20, and how during recording they had to modify and E.Q. the guitar sounds to take the 'edge' off of it, so it was only subtle. That is... well... disgusting, I believe. Their motives were to press forward Rob Thomas, the vocalist, as he is the highlight of the band, and also to produce music that could be well received as background music that could be played at parties, gathering, office parties, any situation: perhaps a stretch for money at heart. Now I can understand a musicians need for money, respectively. Without money, it can be very hard to devote much time to music, and to spend whats necessary to get the perfect sound (then again, what IS the perfect sound?). But, Matchbox have totally made it. Rob Thomas could just sit back for the rest of his life and bathe in royalties. He doesn't even need to continue making music to survive, I bet. Still, I just find it irritating that money can be such a motive for music.

I swear, if I won 30 billion dollars, I'd not be satisfied to conclude my life at that. No freakin way. I've got a God to serve, firstly - and its ""harder for a rich man to get into heaven than it is for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle"" (note this is a reference to a small crack in the walls of a city, not a real needle. Still, Camel's can't get through). Plus, I love music for the sake of music. Not the sake of money. It would be wonderful to be a professional musician, where your job IS your music. But yeh. That doesn't change the fact that: PASSION IS VITAL IN MUSIC.

(excuse me now whilst I get fired up): I'm sick to freakin' death of so many bands, or 'artists' (can we call them that?) who have no care for passion. Its the heart of music! Yes, I realise that music was originally built upon story-telling, as rhyme allows lyrics to be remembered and was used well before written language existed. But in a time where the written levels of communication are so advanced, and so too are the methods of producing music - I think its appropriate to pour passion into music. Its horrible to hear of people who want to be musicians for the money. Music is like drama. You'll probably go through a stage, as a professional musician or actor, where 2 minute noodles are your only food, because you can't afford otherwise. I would call that the 'weeding out' phase. I'm looking forward to a time where I can be in that phase, and it will then become clear to me if I am cut out for music - or if God wants me there. Except firstly, I better get some of my own bloody music.

"event","Its my birthday soon! 24th May. And It was just after my birthday last year, that I bought a new guitar amplifier, a much needed upgrade. Previously I had been playing with a $150 solidstate Drive amp, borrowed from my brother. But this was a different story. I found it in the quokka, and had to drive ages to find it, and the jerk selling it didn't tell me until I had driven all that way that he didn't have the footswitch. What a rip off! So I bought that for an extra $200, even though he was saying I should be able to pick one up from Cash Converters. That was a blatant lie. I knew it, but I didn't want to tell him.

So, all up, I payed $1600, and got me a Marshall AVT150 Head and Cab.
<img src=""http://www.marshallamps.com/images/avt2000/images/Avt150hdetail1large.jpg"">
<img src=""http://www.musiccenter-magdeburg.de/images/big/avt150head.jpg"">

It was a huge step up, particularly in volume. It has 4 channels, OD1, OD2, Clean, and Acoustic Simulation. The Acoustic simulation is ok, but not professional enough to really use. The clean is crisp, and I like it alot. OD1 (overdrive 1) is great, and I use that most of the distortion, as its got a bell like ring in it, and its not too overdone. It sounds rich. OD2 is dissappointing - Metal heads would love it, but, even though I am a metal head, I find it too weak. Metal heads love to crank the bass and treble, and drop the mids. Thats what this channel is made for, with an actual mid-scoop switch. The metal sound is ok, but in general, it hollows out a song when all guitars dodge the mids.
<img src=""http://www.marshallamps.com/images/avt2000/images/Avt150hpanellarge.jpg"">

<img src=""http://www.marshallamps.com/images/avt2000/images/avt150detail2large.jpg"">

AVT stands for... oh damn... i forget. Something like All Valvestate Technology. It is a valvestate amp. So, its better then, than a solidstate amp, but hasn't got the richness of tone that an all valve amp has. It houses only one ECC83 dual triode valve, in the preamp stage (i'll explain valves at the bottom of this post). It gives it some richness. But, as its got a lot of solidstate technology, I have the added bonus of built in digital effects! It has 16 effects, and I can set one effect for the 2 clean channels, and one for the dirty, and can flick them on or off with the footswitch, hence the 6 buttons (4 channels, 2 effects).
<img src=""http://www.marshallamps.com/images/avt2000/images/avt150detail3large.jpg"">

The biggest problem with the effects is that... they don't work!!! Something is wrong with my amp. Its broken. Fortunately my Boss GT-6 comes in to help (i'll explain that in a different post). Still, overall, its a nice amp. Not professional enough for my liking though, but good none-the-less. It really boasts the sound of the guitar, which is great, as the other amp sounded crap no matter how good the guitar was. Eventually, I would like to upgrade to an all valve amp, with separate analogue effects units. I'll go into that, also, in a different post.

<b>Valves:</b> <i>a short summary</i>
Valves are like a light globe for an audio signal. They were made a long time ago, and it was used in transitor radios, etc. It basically works to boost a signal. It actually looks like a globe, made of glass, etc, and it actually glows. But not shines. Essentially, you run the audio signal through some kind of wiring circuit thing housed in a glass ball filled with a special gas. After a long time, people managed to produce solidstate technology, which is like solid circuitry that electronically boosted a signal. In recent years, people have turned back to valves for their rich and full sound. Its a preference. Its like, we still use analogue clocks, even though digital ones are more practical, because analogue ones are more pleasing to the eye. You'd use the clunkier, older valve technology, coz its nicer to the ear. Here's a picture of an ECC83 valve.

"event","So, eventually I want to list all my equipment I have on this journal, and the aproximate dates that I got it, and what it does, etc.

Last year, Sean got a Korg 16XD 16 track digital recorder for his 18th Birthday. NOTE: This is <i>not</i> mine, it is his.
<img src=""http://www.instrumentpro.com/Merchant2/graphics/00000001/info_d16xd.jpg"">
We've done a fair bit of recording with this machine, which is absolutely wonderful. Basically, the sound card I've gotten recently does similar things to what this 16 track does, except its not a dedicated or a particularly portable machine. The 16 track has a touch screen, and you can edit, mix, master songs on it, even zooming in and cropping a recorded sound wave. He got this just over 12 months ago. I had just gotten a 2 week contract working in the cake department at the Tip Top bread bakeries. With the money I made, I bought a 7 peice Samson Drum Mic set, for about $750
<img src=""http://www.samash.com/images/items/s7%20Kit.jpg"">
The kit consists of enough mics to record an entire average drum kit: 3 tom mics, one snare mic, and a kick mic (all passive), with 2 overhead pencil condensers (active, requiring phantom power). The tom mics all have clips so they can clip to the rim of the drum, but i bought 2 normal mic stands and a kick drum mic stand for the overhead condensers and the kick mic. The kick mic has, of course, a large diaphram to gather those bass freqencies. I also got 8 x 8m Planet Waves XLR mic cables. If you've heard of planet waves, you know they're good. 24 Carat Gold plated pins, insulated cables - so well insulated that you can run the mic cables over power cords and you won't get interference
<img src=""http://www.pro-music-news.com/html/02/10425pla.jpg"">
They're still the mics we use now for recording. Haven't had any updates, 'cept for a vocal mic (in another post). If recording a whole jam, we'd clip a tom mic to a guitar stand, and put the mic infront of the speaker cone on my amp, and just use one less on the drum kit. Sean would usually go DI (direct Input)"

"event","So, recently, I got myself a new computer. $2000 wholesale price. That'd be a LOT more if I got it RRP. I'm happy with it. But, of course, I try to make any decent purchase somehow related to music. So, in addition to the computer, I splurged $850 on a soundcard, and $800 on monitors (monitors being audio monitors, a professional term for speakers). So after coughing up the dough (and some of my lung) I set up the computer, and here I am, sitting at it, in my bedroom, with these freakin huge speakers next to it, and an external sound card the size of an old school VCR. 

So, why did I do it? It's all in the value. Lets start with the soundcard, a Tascam FW-1804:
<img src=""http://www.tascam.com/Press/Images/FW1804/FW-1804Left.jpg"">
<img src=""http://www.tascam.com/Press/Images/FW1804/FW-1804Rear.jpg"">

Its basically a recording soundcard, with a decent mic preamp, and 8 mic inputs. Unfortunately, only 4 of the inputs are XLR Mic inputs, the special kind that also take 1/4"" jack. The last 4 only take the 1/4"" jack. That shouldn't be a problem, as I'll just put passive mics through the last first, and keep the first 4 for any condenser mics. The thing is, its got phantom power that can go out to all 8 channels. I didn't think you could get phantom power on a standard 1/4"" jack. I thought it could only go through an XLR cable, seeing as that has 3 pins, and a 1/4"" jack has only 2 sections (unless its stereo - rare in recording, thats only really used in audio listening). I'll have to figure this one out. Oh! Its got 2 optical outs, aswell, which is great, coz I ever have a pary, and want to use my MP3 list, I can plug the soundcard optical output into my parents home theatre sound systemy thingo. The sound card connects to the computer through fire wire, a necessity so it can accept 8 or more signals individually, without having to combine them like you would for a standard mic input on the computer's built in sound card. The guy from Mega Music was also telling me that you can buy an add on, for about $400, that connects another 8 XLR mic inputs, with phantom power, to the Tascam, thus taking up to 16 mics inputs at once.

So what about software? Well, I gotta get used to this. It came with Cubase LE (Limited Edition). I'm not familiar with it, only really with Cool Edit pro. But from the sounds of things, its far greater than cool-edit. I can tell it'll be really complex, coz when you start the program, its just a blank screen, with your ""file, edit, toolbars"" etc dropdowns at the top. For some reason, any program that starts blank scares me. I prefer to see pretty pictures, at first. I'll have to read the whole manual though, to figure it all out. I need to know all the ins and outs. Also, both the Hardware (the Tascam) and software (Cubase LE) support Midi inputs, up to 4 of them! I don't really know much about midi, but really wanna know more. It looks so... intriguing. Apparently, the way it works is like... you can record a peice of music, with midi, then once you've recorded it, you can alter parts of the performance. For example, if it was on piano, and you hit a wrong note, you can delete JUST that one note, without affecting any other notes ringing at the same time. If you played out of time, it can place every note you played in perfect time without altering the pitch. Of course, you can alter the pitch, move something to a different note if it wasn't right, and you can extent the time of a single note. Say you didn't hold it long enough, or you came into the next part too soon. With Midi, you can just stretch how long one note sounded for. I think they call it 'clocking'. Sounds interesting! Except, I'd need to understand it (and I will one day), and get a midi instrument, like a small basic Midi board keyboard. Then you can assign drum hits to each key on the keyboard, and essentially play a drum beat slowly, and the computer will play it back in normal speed, flawlessly.

The thing is... nothing digitally created sounds right. Those gentle ruffles you may do on the snare, without thinking about it. The authentic sound of a microphone on a drum, or bass cabinet. The accent on this note, then this one. The ever so small mistakes that give a real recording its life. All that is gone when you record with midi, right? Well... I guess so. But. The tascam came with another peice of software. Its called GigaStudio. Its like a digital instrument producer. Its the latest technology in digital sound production. Basically, if you electronically operate a snare through this software, it will sound precisely like a snare thats been perfectly recorded. None of this fake fruity-loops crap. Its the real deal. With a variety of snare hits too. Snare clicks, ruffles, etc. You can even alter the pitch of the drum, essentially virtually tightening or loosening the skin. Same with all other toms. And cymbals, although i haven't experimented with cymbals yet. But its not limited to drums. Bass, sax, violin... you name it. Any instrument really. And it sounds like the real deal. I think you can choose how far from the bridge on a bass guitar you want to pick, or strike with a finger. The sound files are HUGE too. Like, massively huge. There is SO much information in just a simple bass sound. I was playing around with the bass sounds. I chose a rickenbacker bass, chose which pickups would be operating the most, and chose what effects it was going to go through. Then when i clicked a note with the mouse, the speakers just... boom! Exploded with a rich real bass sound. It was JUST like i had perfectly recorded that exact bass guitar. It sounded authentic, and scratchy. And as is rang, the sound grew quieter, and the tonal qualities changed too, like they do with strings that aren't vibrating as violently. The sound was amazing.

But, of course, thats partly to do with the monitors: Alesis M1 Active Mk2 speakers
<img src=""http://www.alesis.com/images/products/M1Mk2.jpg"">

Most typical speaker set ups consist of your sub woofer and tweeters or mid range speakers. Most of those (though usually not the sub) have speaker cones made of paper. Thats why these ones are so costly. This is one of the paragraphs on the website: <i>The M1 Active's woofer and tweeter were specifically designed for the most linear, low distortion response in powered monitoring applications. Its 6.5"" woofer cone is formulated from non-woven carbon fiber. It's a material that has been used for the skins of combat aircraft wings, since it offers high tensile strength and low weight. In fact, carbon fiber is 25% lighter than polypropylene (the most common driver material) and hence provides quicker transient response in the low frequency range for superb bass response as well as a vast improvement in the detail of critical upper-mid frequencies. The M1 Active's 1"" tweeter dome is made of pure silk, which offers a natural response that aids in preventing ear fatigue during long mix sessions. It also features an internal pole piece mounted phasing plug and is ferrofluid cooled to maintain the best balance of transient response to power handling</i>

Thats insane! Combat speakers! The crossover circuitry means you'll hear all frequencies at the EXACT same time - no speaker delay from tweeters and subs. Ferrofluid cooled! Even the magnets are sheltered so as not to interfere with a nearbye computer monitor, or anything. Its just so crazy. So, have I heard the difference? Yes, but in a different way to expected. When listening to a song, they sound a little different, in fact - not quite as good. But thats the point. They've got no tone control, so you can't make the bass or treble different to each other in volumes, and it hasn't got a standard volume control. Well, it has, like it changes volume when you turn it, but its got a lock so that you know the standard volume. Whats the point? Well, if you create a song that sounds good on these speakers, it'll sound good everywhere. In tiny headphones, car speakers, over a massive arena PA... anywhere. Actually, it should sound slightly harsher on these speakers, because of their extreme sensitivity. I heard the quality altering in a normal MP3 - not a particularly low quality one. Just at one part of a song, a tom hit seemed to shimmer so vaguely, a tiny bit like the extreme shimmering you hear on a super low quality MP3. Another thing i noticed, was how sensitive the speakers were to software adjustments. I changed the treble on the software of the computer and the speakers responded superbly. It made a HUGE difference, bigger than it does with normal speakers. Another thing too, I noticed, that when playing music quietly or loudly, the frequencies stay in perfect proportion. You know how most sound systems sound good at a certain volume? Well, at a low volume, these speakers sounded like a normal system a long way away, and at high, they sounded like a real system up close. The volume of the bass reduced at exactly the same rate as the volume of the treble. This means that mixing at any volume, you'll get a perfect sound.

What else? Oh yeh! When I first got the speakers, i tapped the speaker cone with my finger, and was surprised at how bassy it sounded - like a kickdrum, without even plugging them in. I'm very happy. Best thing is (and i remember me and Sean ran into some trouble with this) is the volume setting stuff. I remember Sean mixed a song and it turned out really quite in comparison to the average volume on a CD. But you never really know this until its on a CD and you play it just after another CD. These speakers should normalise the volume (when at that middle setting) so that you increase the volume of the track on the software file, not on the hardware speakers.

*le-sigh* So yeh. I'm a very happy boy. With a LOT of figuring out to do, and instruction manual reading ahead. Sorry this was such a long first post."

Oh yeeeeaah! My two-page Minnie is in there, along with a two-page Ratz and a Johnny Bean. Never again will I pwn teh b34n0 in such a manner, so get it while it's hot!"

"event","Not the current issue, at any rate. For, yes, this is the week that the mystery strip I've been working on since March finally makes its entrance. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you ""Johnny Bean from Happy Bunny Green"", charming tales of life in a cosy rural idyll and the little hoody bastard who ruins it on a weekly basis. It's a departure in format from normal Beano strips, but I think it has loads of potential - well, I would say that, wouldn't I? Plus, this week's Beano has a free Halloween kit with a glow-in-the-dark plastic skeleton, so there's really no excuse not to buy it (unless you're frightened of skeletons or things that glow in the dark).

A notable thing I've just finished, which I can't add yet but will when it's published, is a Les Pretend page for the Beano. Yes, my first crack at an established Beano character - quite an honour!

In other arty news, I spent a glorious day at a place called Compton Verney in Warwickshire on Sunday, in the company of my life drawing class. We drank wine, ate grapes and sandwiches, basked in the sun... and found a bit of time for painting and sketching too. A most civilised day out. The weekend before that, Tim and I went to Whitby (seaside town up North - we go there every couple of years). It was the beginning of Whitby Folk Week, which is basically an excuse for British people to get together and be even more eccentric than usual. Like doing folk dancing, for instance. Dr Who-themed folk dancing...

Marvellous.

Finally, famous Brit comic writer/artist Bryan Talbot has just released a book of crazy stories about famous figures from the comics industry (involving such hot topics as nudity/fist fights/skeletons/Finnish people/drunkenness/insane fans/drugs - oh, and a Klingon drinking coffee). It's a bloody funny read whether you know anything about comic creators or not, and it's illustrated throughout by my erstwhile boss Mr Emerson (who appears in two stories, one involving Russia, nudity and a carrier bag). What more incentive could you need to pick up a copy

I doubt anyone will be surprised to hear that I've been very busy with drawing various things, attending various seminars, and travelling to London to watch various Japanese Ska bands (well, no, just the one of those actually:)

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJZgUpzqAyY&mode=related&search=

We saw them in a MUCH smaller venue than this, only a few hundred people - but as you can see, in Japan they're popular enough to fill 10-15,000 capacity venues. w00t! Finally, a Japanese band that hasn't already disbanded by the time I find out about them (yes, I'm looking at you, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjRtXAXmHUU"">Modern Choki Chokies</a>).

This is only really a short entry to say I'm off to Austria next week to escape the miserable weather we're having in Britain right now, to eat pork, and to spot a wolpertinger. Ooh missus!

Actually, I'm busy busy busy right now - I've got eight Beano annual pages on the go (the 2009 annual - yes, they plan that far ahead!) and of course the weekly strips themselves. Also, an old animator friend has just been in contact expressing an interest in us working together on something.

"event","A busy weekend, but a good one - no, a great one, I think. Tim and I arrived at the convention hall at 9.45 on Saturday to set up the Midlands Comics Collective stall - next thing I knew it was about one in the afternoon and I was wandering back from the con hotel with a cup of tea and a Bounty in my hand, having just given up an increasingly futile quest to find Shelley Bond (an editor from Vertigo - more about that in a mo). 

Many stalls to visit, including an increased presence of indies and self-published titles - always good to see - and many interesting bods from the industry to meet, including the luvverly Jamie Smart (premiering ""Fat Chunk"", the excellent minicomic for which I did the ""Toy Parable"" story a couple of months back), who is much taller than you would think he is,   Mr Bryan Talbot (promoting his jaw-droppingly good ""Alice in Sunderland"" - buy it!), Glenn Fabry, and so on and so on. I held off on the inevitable spending on the Saturday, largely because I was too busy either manning the stall or wandering around chatting to people. Oh, I also picked up my comp copy of Accent UK's ""Zombies"" anthology, for which I did the ""House of the Dead"" story (you remember the one - it's on my site, anyway). Looks good. I'm undecided as to whether to put something in their next one, ""Robots"" - not a very inspiring subject for me...

So anyway, evening came and we found ourselves in a huge group of StripSearchers, MC2 members and the odd comic artist (well, Hunt and John McCrea, as usual) having a chinese meal and swapping rude jokes and anecdotes. Then, upon returning to the hotel bar with some members of the gang, I found myself conversing with the mentioned-several-posts-back Lew Stringer (yes! I met him, finally! He, too, is luvverly!), and a jolly nice Viz artist named Paul Palmer. We basically agreed that a)we have the best job in the world, and b)we'd been drinking a lot. The evening wrapped up for me at about 1.30 (following a long, very inebriated conversation with Hunt about mad aunties and...er...not sure), at which point the comic artists had already almost drunk the bar dry. It's very dangerous letting people who work alone from home out into a social setting...

Sunday. I was one of the few non-hungover people, which was lucky for me since I finally got to see Shelley - who looked at my portfolio and asked me to send her ideas and sketches for possible MINX titles. Ohhhh yeeeaaah! I also had interest from some publishers who might want me to do a 2-3 page illustrated biography of Edgar Allan Poe (sweet!), and a new inking/colouring gig lined up. So all in all - yeah! Woo! Comics rawk! Oh, if you'd like to see some piccies from the weekend, one of the Comics Collective guys out together a little slideshow - chekkiddout (under Convention Appearances):

"event","Is this the first update for April? I do believe it is. OK, since the last entry, I've spent Easter on the east coast (appropriately), been to Barcelona with Doctor Tim, and (yesterday, in fact) went to a cartooning event in Shrewsbury, a nice little market town not too far from Brum. There's not much to say about the first two, except we ate, drank, walked and shopped, all of which are far more interesting to do yourself rather than hear about other people doing them. The cartooning event was fun, though - saw loads of cartoonists whose work I was familiar with, including Steve Bright (drew Bananaman for the Dandy until very recently), Pete Dredge, Noel Ford, Clive Collins (brother of Phil Collins, or so I'm told - gawrsh!) and Steve Best. Steve Bell from the Guardian was there too, and I was rather chuffed to hear that he told Hunt he's a fan of Ratz... he he! Nice! Speaking of which, since Mr Emerson is very busy at the mo, I'm getting to do another page by myself this week. Expect to see that on my website shortly.

In the evening, as is customary for comic artists, we all piled into a pub and started drawing each other (well, piling into a pub and drinking is MORE customary, but we did that too). Now I'm not much good at drawing real people in real surroundings, but I'm told that it's important to learn how, 'cos then you might get hired to do caricatures at events, like weddings and such. Here's my current skill level - room for improvement, but not entirely piss-poor for two-minute drawings with no pencil roughs underneath.

Then, when I'd drawn all the people nearby whose faces I could see clearly, I progressed to something a little more typical of my ouvre:

And a good time was had by all (also, Hunt draw a great pic of Tim that makes him look like some kind of evil pixie. I'll scan that sometime). Now, I've got a chocka few weeks coming up - I want to set up a Cafe Press store linked to my site, and I've foolishly volunteered to put together a mini-comic for the Midlands Comics Collective in time for the big Comics Con in Bristol (which is a scant three weeks away). Plus, I have new Beano art(aside from Ratz), and new Gilbert and Sullivan, to do ASAP. So why am I still here? I'm off to make a start on some of this stuff!

 - Putting together my mini-comic
 - Finding a printer and getting said comic printed
 - Having a birthday
 - Preparing for the NY Comic Con
 - Doing new portfolio pages for the NY Comic Con
 - Going to the NY Comic Con

And the usual stuff besides that, you know, the Beano work, life in general...

So, those of you whose addresses I know will naturally get copies of Comic Pie (so the mini is named - don't ask me why, pies are just funny), and the rest of you will have to settle for seeing the cover on the front page of my website. It's been up there for a couple of weeks actually, I really should've got round to announcing that fact on my journal. But I didn't. Oh well.

The Con was grrrreat, as was dear old NYC itself - although a complete contrast temperature-wise to when I went last summer, since it snowed some of the time. I showed my portfolio to people from Vertigo (actually went out to dinner with a Vertigo editor and his writer and artist cronies - sweet), MAD magazine, Archie Comics, Slave Labor and TokyoPop. All of them liked my work (or, let me put it this way, none of them said they didn't), although of course in this business in order to get a gig you have to be prepared to play the waiting game as to when the right project comes along for you. Still, I have sown the seeds, so I'll keep sending all these people updated sets of artwork on a semi-regular basis (as all good little comic artists are advised to do by their sensei), and see what fruits they bear. 

Speaking of bear (tenuous link here), I'll have a page in ""Fat Chunk"", the new comic being put out by the lovely Mr Jamie Smart of ""Bear"" fame. For those of you who've never read Bear, it's a comic about a teddy and a cat, and features lots of blood, faeces and cake. It's VERY VERY funny. Expect to see Fat Chunk premiering at Bristol in May. Also, I'm most likely going to have a new strip starting in the Beano before too long - a kind of spin on the ""rotten tales for little kids"" genre of entertainment, inspired (so sayeth the ed) by my Strawberry Shortcake piss-take from early January. I won't be writing it, but I will be drawing it all by myself. Yay me! I've also been allowed to draw and ink a Ratz page on my own for the first time too, so I'll alert you Brits to the week when that appears. 

Gosh, I think that'll do for the moment. I am happy - things are progressing well in Meats Land^_^ I'll be putting up some photos from the Comic Con very soon on Flickr, so keep your eye on either my website or this here journal to find out when that happens. In the meantime, this should give you a good idea as to the general tone of the thing.

"event","Look, 30 comics on and I'm still alive! It's been a funny old month, but looking back on all the strips I'd say it's been a worthwhile activity - I've got some good new characters and ideas to play with from that lot and, more importantly, I have enough material to compile into a mini-comic. Yes! (Hopefully) in time for my trip to the New York Comics Con on February 22, I'm going to put the best strips into dead tree form to give out to unsuspecting editors. Question is, which strips are in and which are out? Obviously I need to concentrate on good artwork, but I don't want to miss out some  sketchier favourites. So, these are the definites so far (remember, I don't need 22 strips, just 22 pages to fill - so obviously, say, yesterday's would count as two pages).

 - The Happy Land of Fruitopia
 - Cat & M.O. mouse
 - Capybara (split over two pages)
 - Stupid things I believed
 - Fun with herpetology
 - Entertaining five year olds
 - Poe
 - Christmas with the horsemen
 - Jonathan Science
 - Justice Lunch

And on the ""probably but not 100% sure"" list:

 - Occam's razor
 - Pope Squad
 - Duck & Plover
 - X-13's Shaggy Rat Story
 - Fight Crab
 - Cupid

Any thoughts? Anyone got favourites not on the lists? I would include Forbidden Fruits, but the punchline sadly won't carry overseas and I don't want to change it. Remember, I need to fill 22 pages in total. Cheerz m'dears! And thanks to everyone who has supported this little endeavour in various ways, you've done a lot to keep me motivated in my weary moments^_^"

I've decided, I'm going to collect most or all of them into a mini-comic to give away at Bristol this year - should make a nifty promotional tool. I've not run out of ideas yet, but I must say I haven't left the house as much as I would have liked to in the last week - oh well! On the plus side, I got an entry in the Forbidden Planet International blog, and an email from a comic artist beloved to me named Lew Stringer, complimenting me on how great he thought my site and the strips were. Again - woo!

Weak screenplay and what looked like a real rush job on the animation front (although I acknowledge there were some very funny bits here and there - kudos in particular to the frogs).

The week after the ceremony, I pretty much had brain-freeze the whole time and didn't get a thing done except a Ratz page, but since then I've been doing other stuff... drawing a six-page zombie story... more Ratz... you know. Tim has returned from Korea in one piece, with tales of nasty food. The media's also taken a bit of an interest in the IMAF thing - even as I type this, there is an interview on local BBC radio with yours truly, that I recorded on Thursday. TOOOOOOO weird!! Tim's downstairs listening to it, but I can't bear to. I probably sound like a total retard, since I was running on pure nerves the whole time we were recording it. And I know my voice sounds appalling when recorded. So yeah. Weird. I'm going to spin this entry out until the interview is over and I can return downstairs. La la la la la la la...... ah yes, I'm actually going to be working in an office for a while up until the end of the year, doing illustrations in-house for a CD-Rom at Hi8us Midlands (the StripSearch people). That's pretty cool - I'd almost forgotten the heady thrill of fancying a cup of tea during the day and having SOMEONE ELSE make it. I really must get those cats trained better.

Now, with the cynicism of adulthood, I see it as a time to avoid being in my front room, so the light doesn't give away my presence when trick-or-treaters come. Ah, I kid, I kid. I actually bought myself a proper costume this year to wear to my friend Sarah's party (her birthday is October 27th, so she usually throws a Halloween-themed bash). It's an awesome purple and black witch's garb, with spiderweb lace and everything. If I had a photo, I'd put it up, but I don't. Aaaaanyway, since Tim's in Korea and I'm in the house by meself tonight, I'm probably going to watch horror DVDs while getting quietly drunk.

I've also been feeling a little nostalgic lately, and it's all to do with buildings. My old primary school was torn down this year (having been disused for quite some time), to make way for new housing. Plus, the hall of residence where I spent two of my years at uni, and in fact where I met Tim, is also in the process of being turned into rubble. Of course, neither place has had any part of my life for years and years, but even so... I guess it's the thought that no-one else will ever again have the experience of being there. Yep, a year of change all round."

I actually got an email from the Editor-in-chief herself informing me that their records stated they sent a rejection letter on May 25th, but it seems to have been lost in the post. What's really galling is she said she remembered sending it because she wrote an accompanying letter herself rather than just a form rejection. Now I wasn't really expecting to get anywhere with this submission - I mean, let's face it, you have to be super-uber-lucky to get your own comic series commissioned from your first ever submission to a publisher - but I was at least hoping to get some useful feedback from it, which it sounds like I've been denied by cruel fate.

Ah me, what's to be said (apart from it's too hot in this country right now to sit in front of a computer all day, and yet the alternative is doing the ironing this evening BLAAAAH). Since my last post, the following things have happened:

1) My parents had to have our pet dog of the last 13 and a half years put to sleep. This has been a very sad event for all of us, even though we knew it was coming (she was diagnosed with cancer of the liver back in May). On the plus side, for all but the last week of her life, Shula was as happy and lively as she's ever been, so her suffering wasn't prolonged. On the minus side - apart from the fact that she's dead - I was actually with her when she was euthanised, which was a horrible, horrible experience. Feeling down about this is part of the reason I haven't bothered posting for a while.

2) Another reason is that I just haven't done much art lately. I've been in communication with the editor of MAD magazine, who liked an idea I sent in (although it was too similar to something they'd already done), and asked me to send more. But only rough scribbles have come from that so far.

3) I saw Tokyo Godfathers. It's a brilliant, uplifting anime about three homeless people who find a baby on Christmas eve and go searching for its parents. It's by the same guy who did the equally good, but much more disturbing Paranoia Agent, Satoshi Kon.

4) I have been suffering from a condition called episcleritis, which basically makes your eye look like a red snooker ball. It's pretty harmless in itself, but it looks terrifying. And probably indicates I'll develop rheumatoid arthritis when I get older. Yay!

5) I went to a picnic at Hunt Emerson's house, and met his three cats: Moonlight, Mrs. Cat, and Ali-oom-bai-ay. Best. Cat. Name. Ever.

6) I have written a seven-page story about zombies, but I need to cut it to six. Then, I will post the roughs on my website. Watch this space.

And... it's my last week at Usborne this week, which feels VERY weird. Will I cry on Friday? Place bets now! 

End. Art at some point."

The sky is brown and the water is brown!
The cabs don't stop, they don't even slow down!
New York, New York!
It's a terrible town!

 - Jay and Alice, <i>The Critic</i>

No, that's not true at all! Well, maybe the bit about the cabs. Indeedy, I have just returned from my very first trip to the States, and have found no part of it whatsoever to be terrible, except perhaps for the very exhausting flight back. We spent five nights in NYC, with two nights in Boston sandwiched in the middle. We were staying in Greenwich Village, which is a great area packed with high-quality delis and cafes, and also provided much amusement for me and Tim on the last day when my slightly shocked Dad got to witness the immense Pride parade. ""Lesbians kissing in the street! Men holding hands eveywhere you look! I've never seen anything like it!"" Bless. We did the stereotypical tourist sights - Staten Island ferry, Macy's, Times Square, Central Park, Ground Zero, Empire State etc - whilst finding enough time for shopping and EATING. Photo time I think.

<img src=""http://www.itsamouse.com/gas/images/NYC muffin.jpg"">
This was my breakfast on day one - DOOM MUFFIN. I soon learned to have something more sensible first thing in the morning.

<img src=""http://www.itsamouse.com/gas/images/NYC cityscape.jpg"">
Typical NY scenery. One of the strangest things I found about being back in Birmingham was that I could see things near the horizon again.

<img src=""http://www.itsamouse.com/gas/images/NYC horsey.jpg"">
Tim and I went on the famous carousel in Central Park. Of course, I made him pose for this picture on the most demented-looking horse we could find. Did you know all American carousels turn anti-clockwise but all British ones turn clockwise? True, apparently.

<img src=""http://www.itsamouse.com/gas/images/NYC spankys.jpg"">
Yes, we ate at Spanky's. As well as having both a hilarious name and a hilarious poster, their meats are to die for. Or more likely, of.

Much as I loved New York, Boston was my favourite. A lovely, verdant place, with super-friendly people, great shopping, lots of interesting history and - lucky for us - Cow Parade!

<img src=""http://www.itsamouse.com/gas/images/BMA cow.jpg"">
It says ""Cowtucket"" on the side. Oh dear...

<img src=""http://www.itsamouse.com/gas/images/BMA buildings.jpg"">
Boston mixes the old and the new in a big way.

We had, as the locals would say, a wicked good time in Boston. I'm very keen to return to the area and tour more of New England (ideally in the Autumn, but probably too expensive.) Still, since we took the Chinese Lucky Star bus there and back from New York, it didn't cost us much to visit this time round - $15 each way, bargain!

Overall, what surprised me most was the number of cliches that the East Coast effortlessly exploded. Example:

 - Fat Americans. Nope. Well over 90% of the people I saw were slim, tanned and generally beautiful. Really does make us Brits look like pasty-faced oiks by comparison.
 - Unfriendly New Yorkers. Dad claimed he met a rude barman, but everyone me and Tim encountered was quite charming.
 - Dangerous New York. Frankly, I've felt less safe in Birmingham City Centre than riding the subway at midnight.

And some of the cliches that were spot-on:
 - American portion control. It doesn't exist. Come on, what other country could offer you a three-pint soda for $1.79?
 - National obsession with peanut butter. I have never seen so many ways of mixing chocolate, peanut butter and caramel in my entire life. Hallelujah!! I only regret that I couldn't bring back any of the multitude of dreamy-sounding ice cream flavours that you can't buy in the UK. Still, I managed to stuff a carrier bag of candy bars, some biscuits and some cookie-dough Pop Tarts in my suitcase. And Dad got addicted to Gatorade.

So yes, I would go again for sure. I think the South's next on the agenda, if we can just work out a decent itinerary. Once you've tried chicken-fried steak, there's no looking back. Thanks, Spanky's^_^"

I made this charming standee to decorate the lower bit of my gallery wall (which is essentially dead space, since no-one hangs pictures below waist level unless they're weird).

The other word on the street is that I might have interesting new arty projects coming in. Dear Hunt Emerson, professional cartoonist of many a year and one of our mentors from StripSearch, is planning on trying me out as his inker for a new strip he's doing in The Beano - yes, The Beano, Britain's oldest and most famous comic. Eh? Eh?? He's going to send me a penciled page to see how I do, so I'd better make a good job of it. The pay's pretty paltry, but who cares? That's going to look bloody impressive on my CV. 

Secondly, a chap named Kevin Sutherland (also famous on the British comics scene) is putting together a dummy comic - ""The Street Comic"" - to pitch to prospective publishers at the Bristol Comics Con next month. I've been asked to contribute a page, so I'm going to finally give a home to ""The Sinisters"" (see my newly-updated <a href=""http://www.laurahowell.co.uk"">Website</a> for a reminder of who they are). There's no pay in this one, but if someone decides to publish the comic, I might well get a contract. AND I have this week off work. AND it was sunny today. AND our exhibition starts next week. Woo! And also, yay!"

So anyway, since my last entry I've been told that the Arts Council is going to fund the Midland Comics Collective's anthology, which is obviously very cool, but right now I'm more preoccupied with readying myself for our exhibition after Easter. I've ordered myself some business cards, and have been working on new pictures just for the occasion. Number one is this:

<img src=""http://www.itsamouse.com/gas/images/cute_clover.jpg"">

Cute, no? I'm trying hard to get my head around PhotoShop, and I must say I'm quite satisfied with the results so far. Number two might well involve zombie cheerleaders, stay tuned.

I'm also revamping my website for the occasion, if I have time. I added another page of The Sweet Life last week, with a few new sketches and whatnot on the way shortly. Also, stay tuned for a photo of something very silly within the next week or so.

I've been sat in front of this monitor virtually all weekend, and my eyes are <i>killing</i> me. I have to go. Oh, but in the time I wasn't on the computer, I watched the best film ever ""The Calamari Wrestler"". Just - watch it. That's all I can say."

"event","I'm in a Gilbert and Sullivan mood, can you tell? Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that we went to the big G&S gala thing in Cambridge on Saturday. The champage buffet beforehand was very elegant (duck and orange rolls anyone?), and the first half, Sullivan's arrangement of the popular Biblical tale ""The Prodigal Son"" was rather dull (Sullivan always had misguided aspirations above light opera, bless him), but the second half, comprised of many famous G&S songs, was roaring good fun. We then spent most of yesterday exploring Cambridge, a place neither me nor Tim had been before, and found it to be quite delightful - not least because it contained the most frickin' awesome chocolate shop I've ever seen. So much for that diet I've been thinking quite hard about now and then for the last few months.

In honour of this weekend of frivolity, I've updated my website again. So there.

Also, it's like the bloody Tundra in this country at the moment. If anyone has some spare sunshine they could send my way, please do."

"event","Since I've had the last couple of days off work, it's given me a chance to do a bit of site updating (and a metric shedload of work on Dai Hard - how can lettering take so <i>long</i>?? Phase one is complete, phase two will probably happen in the next few days. I've added new artwork, put in some new Links, reorganised the Gallery a little, and finally addressed the ""I don't like seeing a blank screen before I click on a thumbnail"" issue that people often complain about. The moral of that particular story is, ""Be careful what you wish for"";)

<p>PS. Be sure to check out the new Artists' sites on the Links page, their work is simply gorgeous."

The Pirates! In an Adventure with Scientists

A small but perfectly-formed tome, which can be read in about two hours but will leave a happy glow that lasts many months. Some outrageously stupid pirates go to Victorian London with Charles Darwin, who is attempting to prove that a monkey in a nice suit can be passed off as a human. Lots of ham is eaten (in fact, the Pirate Captain's personal motto is ""I like ham"".)

Film:

Fear and Trembling

<a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0007TFJ46/qid=1141046184/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_10_1/203-4782995-0231947"">www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0007TFJ46/qid=1141046184/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_10_1/203-4782995-0231947</a>

Based on the semi-autobiographical novel of the same name, this follows a Belgian girl called Amelie as she struggles to fit into the incomprehensible world of Japanese office life as a misfit foreigner. Not only is it painfully funny (and often just painful), the two female leads are endlessly amazing to look at. The title of the film, if you're wondering, refers to the demeanour one was traditionally supposed to adopt when approaching the Emperor.

Finally: more art arriving on my Website very soon."

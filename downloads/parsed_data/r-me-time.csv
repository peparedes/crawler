<lj-cut text=""Let&#39;s take a vacation to the land of Storybook"">

<img src=""http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6116/6387976611_c102ac45d9_o.png"">
There's no mini challenge this week, so we start off week two in the Storybook house with Max doing what he loves best: trying to get into girls' pants.

<img src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7018/6387976703_49041223af_o.png"">
<img src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7009/6387976793_af6bd3dd90_o.png"">
This townie doesn't mind being charmed, but definitely doesn't want to be sweet talked.  She quickly tells Max what she thinks of him.

<img src=""http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6117/6387976897_ee71c7ba4a_o.png"">
Poor Max.  He's not used to being rejected.

<img src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7033/6387977017_c7f044a1e3_o.png"">
Max doesn't handle rejection well.  He tells that bitch where to shove it.

<img src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7175/6387977141_f0d024a78f_o.png"">
Oh, don't act so shocked, Max.  You experienced Arva in nympho mode.  You know what she's capable of.

<img src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7013/6387977193_6d8b8ed594_o.png"">
Arva isn't impressed with the spying and immediately comes over to give Max what for.  While he's in the shower.

<img src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7162/6387977291_af402e1702_o.png"">
I don't know what Max did to this girl, but she constantly comes over to knock over the trash can.  Guess he's not so much the ladies' man as he thinks he is.

<img src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7008/6387977425_aef466f93f_o.png"">
Dany came back to the house, so Max re-starts operation Adopt Kitty.  

<img src=""http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6052/6387977471_1e76878f9e_o.png"">
It worked.  And, of course, the first thing Dany does is attack the garbage can.  Sigh.  Effing pets.

<img src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7015/6387977549_aa949cf1e8_o.png"">
Numair Knight (<lj user=""simsforaranya"">) does not like Max's aggressive approach to sales.

<img src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6387977617_466f2b51c8_o.png"">
Mary-Lynette Ouroboros (<lj user=""lauriethemuppet"">) isn't a happy customer either.  Max sucks at sales.

<img src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7144/6387977709_5b182a137e_o.png"">
Finally, Numair throws his bags down on the ground and storms out.  And he'd bought a LOT of stuff.  :(

<img src=""http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6221/6387977795_6b235087e3_o.png"">
And to top it all off, Max wets himself on the way out of the store.  Today is definitely not Max's day.

<img src=""http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6110/6387977843_96515ce614_o.png"">
The next day at the store, Numair comes back with a job offer.  First of all, it really, really sucks that Max can't take it, since the career isn't opened yet.  Secondly, I have no idea what changed since the day before, when Numair stormed out of the store.  Apparently he's forgotten how incompetent he thinks Max is.  Thirdly, what the hell is the correlation between selling junk and oceanography?  I know I spent years working in the deli of my local grocery store just waiting for someone in an oceanography career to offer me a job.  Some people have all the luck.

<img src=""http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6232/6387977923_5ea025e37c_o.png"">
<img src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7016/6387978011_56193f1d58_o.png"">
Stay classy, Max.  Stay classy.

<img src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7161/6387978091_7ec3a3199d_o.png"">
After the epic fail that Max has experienced all week, he decides to call Thea over.  She'd never turn him down.

<img src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7034/6387978173_fb8e5bf7de_o.png"">
See?

<img src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7170/6387978263_a98b69871c_o.png"">
After a little woohoo, Max asks Thea to move in.  Of course, she agrees, and she brings $16000 with her.  Hello, store upgrade!  As soon as she moves in, she calls work to quit her job.

<img src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7019/6387978329_a25d8af818_o.png"">
And then she gets a makeover!  And after giving her glasses, I immediately want to give her black hair and make her an evil witch, because she looks SO much like Elphaba.  Holy crap, she's gorgeous.  I downloaded her a long while ago and could remember he stats, so I re-rolled them for her.  Now she's a knowledge/Popularity sim with an LTW to become chief of staff.  She loves guys who like to work out in their underwear, and they've got to be fit.  No beer bellies for her men.

<img src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7153/6387978413_b4c67da223_o.png"">
<img src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7013/6387978527_303775001c_o.png"">

<img src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7161/6387978955_ea9c0fbdf2_o.png"">
Although I really want to just go with what my sims want and not force them into anything, Max's kids need to have his last name, which means he and Thea need to get married if she's going to be the one to carry those kids.  So I waited until getting engaged wasn't a fear of his anymore, and then I had him pop the question.  She's so happy!  How could anyone not want to marry her?

<img src=""http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6047/6387979059_d3df0d7eaa_o.png"">
Oh shut up, Max.

<img src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7024/6387979147_4ecf044759_o.png"">
Thea helps convince Max that getting engaged isn't such a bad thing.

<img src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7147/6387979221_76de16a580_o.png"">
Thea and Dany get acquainted with each other.  So far so good!

<img src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7163/6387979319_6488a8c193_o.png"">
Ooh, someone's pregnant!

<img src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7007/6387979417_080628a349_o.png"">
Oh Max, I'm sorry that you can't get in to go to the bathroom right this second because your fiance is busy cleaning the puke filled toilet, because you knocked her up.  How inconsiderate of her.

<img src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7165/6387979513_cebfa852b5_o.png"">
Max had a want to sleep with three different women, and since neither he nor Thea have jobs, he couldn't do it at home since she would immediately catch him.  So, he went to his shop.  Almost right away, he met this townie whose name I can't remember and got his flirt on.  And unlike just about every other townie this week, she fell for his considerable charms.  As she should.  

<img src=""http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6120/6387979607_d835393a74_o.png"">
I tried to make them woohoo in the photo booth, but they wouldn't have it.  It's all good though, because before long, ACR took care of everything, and thus, Max fulfilled his want for three woohoos and one for public woohoo.  And Thea is none the wiser.

<img src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7171/6387979715_d5605fa2d5_o.png"">
Um...not sure what exactly Numair is looking to buy right now.  Either he wants to buy the wall, or he's suddenly developed x-ray vision.  <lj comm=""fightocrime"">'s Kermes Kohler-Wielle, Max's newest sales boy, wings it and tries to get the sale.  What a challenge for his first day on the job!

<img src=""http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6038/6387979761_7bace40cbe_o.png"">
Yay, gold sales badge!  Getting this place up to level 10 and getting a business district will be a piece of cake after this!  Only 6 more ranks to achieve. 

<img src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7165/6387979883_b7951b87d4_o.png"">
Meanwhile, back at home, Thea pops!  Second generation of the Storybooks is on its way!

<img src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7014/6387979979_b920a29306_o.png"">
He may be a cheating man-whore, but he does love Thea.  I have trouble holding a grudge against him when he looks so cute, holding her like that.  D'awww.

<img src=""http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6219/6387980091_d1a84b8a24_o.png"">
Speaking of his cheating ways, look who's decided to show up on their doorstep.  Max just ignored the doorbell until she went away.

<img src=""http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6216/6387980185_809289ac6b_o.png"">
<img src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7147/6387980271_b239349998_o.png"">
<img src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7144/6387980343_d628783161_o.png"">
<img src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7161/6387980417_94b04c72b8_o.png"">
And after that near miss, Max decides to marry Thea before she can find out about any of the other women he's slept with.  It'll make it that much harder for her to leave him if she does find out.

<img src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7162/6387980497_b6c60c70c3_o.png"">
And not a moment too soon.  Pop #2!

<img src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6387980561_92a6bc3a74_o.png"">
<img src=""http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6107/6387980657_651f252026_o.png"">
<img src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7029/6387980725_7ddcbbd1cd_o.png"">
Max and the TV don't get along.  Also, who knew that all it takes to fix a TV is to stab it repeatedly with a screwdriver.  You learn something new every day.

<img src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7018/6387980825_15a99f59e0_o.png"">
Thea trains Dany the last skill she needs to get a job in the showbiz career.  She's been the one teaching the cat her commands, since she's got nothing else to do while Max has been <s>getting it on with other women</s> making a living at the store.

<img src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7161/6387980923_57f3d0b331_o.png"">
And as soon as the skill is learned, Max hops on the computer and gets Dany her job.  She starts the next day!  Yay!

<img src=""http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6095/6387981015_463cdc991f_o.png"">
Max and Thea share a romantic meal of catfish served fresh from the pond in the back yard.  XD

<img src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7007/6387981113_c5d50e60b8_o.png"">
...Not sure who you're talking to, Max.  Thea's...already left the table.  O.o

<img src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7168/6387981191_a2dcec6210_o.png"">
Well, this pregnancy has been pretty easy on Thea, all things considered.  My sims usually don't have that kind of luck, but thankfully, she hasn't had any close calls or anything.

<img src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7005/6387981303_6aefffb89c_o.png"">
Time for the baby!
<b>Max:</b><i>Oh God, why did I sign up for this?!</i>

<img src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7158/6387981361_6c017abb3e_o.png"">
And daughter Lorelei is born, with Max's hair and Thea's eyes and skin.  She is named after a character in Thomas E. Sniegoski's <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fallen_%28series%29"">Fallen series</a>.  

<img src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7158/6387981469_8e65b5c1ff_o.png"">
Ohai dere, Leonid!  How nice of you to take Port Dover for a walk past the Storybook household. 

And that's the end of week two for the Storybooks!  Stay tuned to see what happens next!

<lj-cut text=""Into the void we go"">

Welcome to week two of the Maplecliffe BaCC!  Last time, Arva and Max both moved into the area to build up the new town.  Arva became a farmer, and after many problems with bugs, was turned into a plant sim because of all the spraying she had to do to get rid of them.  Then she was pretty much a crabby bitch from low moods after that.  Let's see if she does any better this week!

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6217/6340599338_af83e50898.jpg"">
Okay, so she's not so bad in the daytime, when she's out in the sun.  Though you would think that, being a plant sim, she wouldn't want to rip the petals off of her fellow flora.  But hey, if it raises her mood, I'm all for it.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6233/6339849987_d2be67d90b.jpg"">
She'll paint during the day, but after dark, it's like pulling teeth, trying to get her to do anything.  She's so effing miserable.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6235/6339850073_329c6ea47c.jpg"">
Port Dover doesn't look terribly impressed either.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6096/6340599526_2dcfc49492.jpg"">
Even a good bubble bath doesn't seem to make her happy, though she's getting water from it.  Also, is it just me, or does she look a little cross-eyed?

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6019/6339850209_20c000cc0c.jpg"">
Oh yeah.  And this week Arva rolled yes to a challenge.  This is the one she got.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6222/6340599680_3db7322930.jpg"">
Sweet.  We can do that.  First male walk-by is Joshua.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6117/6339850423_811929d43a.jpg"">
And this is Leonid.  Now, I had no idea how to force them to woohoo, so I figured I'd cheat them into being in love, and then, after they'd done the deed, I'd cheat them back out of love again.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6106/6340599856_1fdbb7cd89.jpg"">
<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6222/6339850639_f21e3efc29.jpg"">
...completely forgetting that I'd cheated both guys into love at the same time and thus, made Leonid jealous when she slept with Joshua.  Whoops.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6033/6340600052_5daf122b9e.jpg"">
<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6110/6340600150_656f918865.jpg"">
<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6216/6339850877_e41b668454.jpg"">
<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6211/6340600296_c397a70369.jpg"">
Well, at least things aren't boring.  She stands for what she believes in...though, considering the cheating on my part, I'm not sure what exactly it is that she actually believes in.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6052/6340600384_11c61787f3.jpg"">
Meh, she still beds him in the end.  Good little nympho.

Somehow I get the feeling that with those binoculars, she can see right into my soul.  *shudder*

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6108/6340600662_79c3bfd766.jpg"">
Ooh, Numair Knight!  She tries to get it on with him, which would've been awesome, because I love him, but he left the lot before I could cheat them into love to woohoo.  8(

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6037/6340600762_2b1f83382d.jpg"">
I don't know what it is about this lot, but the guys Arva brings home all seem to love catching butterflies and fireflies.  That one on the counter behind Leonid is the one that he'd just put there, and though you can't see it, on the counter to the left of the picture is one that Joshua left.  Weird.

Arva actually spends time teaching Port Dover to play dead.  At night and everything.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6109/6339851697_9b017dd30d.jpg"">
And then she passes out from lack of sunlight.  Not gonna lie, I cheated her to 25% sunlight so that she'd be able to live through the couple of hours until it got light out.  I couldn't let her die!

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6058/6339851809_d52124d252.jpg"">
......And then she decided to make a snow angel.  *shrugs*  Again, if it brings her mood up, I'm all for it.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6095/6340601406_687e0ff1ce.jpg"">
Whoa, so I guess she's pregnant.  I thought, when she started feeling sick, that maybe she'd lost the baby, but she's okay.  Just frozen.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6109/6339852105_4d3e5a9eff.jpg"">
This is Stephen.  He walked by the house in his underwear, so clearly he knew what he was getting into when he got into her bed.  XD

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6117/6339852187_1f6829329f.jpg"">
<b>Stephen:</b><i> Ooh, baby, you're so hot, cleaning out your puke-filled toilet like that.</i> 
.....Yeah, he's not in the running for husband.  Liiiiiiiiiittle too creepy.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6215/6340601686_5f332dd235.jpg"">
Arva finally had enough money to buy a tiny grocery store!  Yay!

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6036/6340601786_6b8a4d8123.jpg"">
And this was all she was able to buy for the store.  8(  So she can sell tomatoes!  Aaaaaaand that's it.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6031/6339852423_1aa086a43a.jpg"">
Arva's first two customers!  One of them is Freya Knight.  Yay!  She didn't sell much though.  Probably $50 worth at most.  But once the sun went down, she was in no mood to do anything, so she had to close up shop.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6094/6339852455_5ec4653af0.jpg"">
.....Great.  Thanks Leonid.  Because she wasn't already poor enough. 

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6060/6340602000_ce7ff28228.jpg"">
Baby time!  Boo on the bathroom birth though.  It's so tiny that no pictures can be taken from inside, except at awkward angles like these.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6049/6340602136_e7469d79a3.jpg"">
She had twins!  I don't know which one this is.  Meh, they're identical at this point.  She had two boys, Bryanston and Lobo, both with Arva's skin and Joshua's hair and eyes.  And now I start to worry about the possibility that somehow, the alien skin is overpowering all other skin.  I'm not sure if it's because, after putting her in a new hood, it's not technically alien skin anymore, and somehow, it's having an effect on everything, because the same thing happened in her last hood, where she and her siblings were born.  Dammit, I think I'm going to have to test this out a bit.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6116/6340602232_c02e3fe2a7.jpg"">
In the meantime though, Arva proves that she's a good mother, though she does play favourites.  Bryanston seems to get all of her attention, while Lobo goes ignored.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6099/6339852797_523710f433.jpg"">
This dog (whose name I can't remember) walked by the lot, and I decided that Port Dover could use a mate, so I sent Arva to play with him.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6101/6339852855_da9fb922a3.jpg"">
.....And of course he immediately goes into the house afterward and starts tearing <s>my heart</s> the couch.  Sigh.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6232/6339852959_46009326c8.jpg"">
Ooh, hello Max!  Fancy you coming by when Arva's in nympho mode!

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6031/6340602602_4283af1fe3.jpg"">
<b>Max:</b><i> You want to do WHAT to me?</i>

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6059/6339853161_0b18d066c8.jpg"">
I guess he liked what she promised.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6221/6339853207_09c7060f2b.jpg"">
Port Dover is not impressed.  I think she's the only one in the world who hasn't fallen under his charm.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6098/6339853273_b8fda14ef9.jpg"">
Leonid comes by every day to kick over the garbage can.  Guess he's still pissed off at her for sleeping with Joshua while he was in the house.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6117/6339853361_9e1d941092.jpg"">
Though apparently not enough that he won't jump into bed with her again.  XD

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6113/6340602964_f456d65c54_o.png"">
O rly?  Engaged, you say?

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6118/6339853619_7d300ee544_o.png"">
Aww, he said yes!

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6042/6340603288_0b6b0ceb99_o.png"">
Meh, it's not much, but it's about 3000 times the amount she currently has, so we'll take it!  He is a Family/Grilled Cheese sim with a LTW to become a rock god.  But since that job isn't happening, he'll have to settle for Arva being his only groupie.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6038/6339853757_b2f6603473_o.png"">
He had a job in the slacker career, so immediately after moving in, he quits.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6047/6340603452_0dd964eccc_o.png"">
Methinks there might still be a little bit of resentment towards Arva.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6114/6339853935_5cc801e189_o.png"">
Time for the babies to grow up!

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6110/6339854005_076ab516c2_o.png"">
This is Bryanston.  He's a whiny little bitch.  

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6097/6340603696_b28b7eb75d_o.png"">
And his not-evil twin, Lobo.  Can you tell which one I like better?

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6219/6340603800_dfc7d0804c_o.png"">
Proof that Brianston is a whiny little bitch.  He was almost red in energy when Arva put him to bed, yet he screamed and cried until Leonid let him out.  Then he immediately crawled out to the doghouse and slept there.  Let's throw 'weird' into the description of this kid.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6107/6340603874_b75c36479e_o.png"">
Uh, Arva?  I don't think that talking about the fact that you love more than one guy is going to help the resentment he clearly already feels for you.
<b>Arva:</b><i> What?  I'm just saying that if he doesn't let it go, he can totally be replaced. *cheeky grin*</i>
*facepalm*

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6034/6340603964_3d40a0f4da_o.png"">
<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6095/6340604050_919f2bd8bf_o.png"">
And we'll end with Arva and Leonid being great parents, even though Leonid isn't actually their father.  Actually, I have the feeling he'll turn into an even better parent than her.  We'll see.  With two family sims, it can't be that bad, right?

Next up, Max Storybook continues his story!

<lj-cut text=""Let&#39;s get started!"">

Welcome to week one of my new Build-a-City Challenge!  I blame <lj user=""simsforaranya"">, because her BaCC is so awesome.  lol.  I got most of my rules from her at <lj comm=""crystal_ridge"">, as well as over at <a href=""http://sims2challenges.blogspot.com/2009/03/episode-64-sims-2-challenges-build-city.html"">this place over here.</a>  I also checked <a href=""http://redmond-flats.weebly.com/original-challenge-rules.html"">this</a> site out, though I haven't read this one all the way through. 

So this is the first part.  I decided to roll a random number between 1 and 4 to see how many families I'd start out with, and I came up with two.  And, since I completely sucked at taking pictures at first, this first update is going to encompass both families.  

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6230/6331743566_085b4a9c45.jpg"">
First up, the Ontarios!  Some of you might remember the first two generations of Ontarios from the regular legacy I started awhile back.  After a few issues with different hoods, I've finally put the gen 3 heir here in Maplecliffe.  Hopefully this will be the last move for the Ontario family.  So, everyone, say hi to Arva!  She's fresh out of college and ready to make a new life in a new place.  Of course, her schooling won't have any meaning here, since there are no jobs or anything to speak of.  She'll just have to make her own way in the world.  She starts out with $24,000, but I forgot to take a picture of her house.  Oh, and I also decided to roll every family every week for the possibility of doing <a href=""http://fightocrime.livejournal.com/52461.html"">mini challenges,</a> but this week, Arva didn't have to do one.

Oh yeah, and her stats:  Arva is a Family/Fortune sim who wants to marry off six kids.  *cries*  Well, I guess this town is going to grow REALLY quickly.  She likes dudes with brown hair and who aren't afraid to wear a little makeup.  No nerds though.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6045/6330991553_92bd7f98aa.jpg"">
And this is her trusty, rainbow-eared dog, of course.  Meet Port Dover!

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6238/6330991595_9419b62a6d.jpg"">
She's adorable, but oh, such a bitch.  Two minutes into arriving at their new house, and she's already eaten Arva's expensive bed, forcing her to buy a cheap one, since she no longer has enough money for a good one.  Stupid dog.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6038/6330991683_2ab9846db6.jpg"">
So, since Arva can't get a job, and those groceries in the fridge won't last forever, she starts to plant a garden.  It takes up most of her days.  And this would be why there are hardly any pictures in week one--because she pretty much did nothing but garden.  My goal is for her to get her gold gardening badge so that she can open a grocery store.  That way, not EVERYONE has to garden to get food.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6036/6331743800_872eb66f15.jpg"">
And she's well on her way!  After the first day, she gets her bronze badge.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6037/6330991753_7e3dcf9e96.jpg"">
And after that, she's too tired and hungry to cook a meal for herself, so she gets the instant meal.  I wouldn't trust her with a stove anyway.  The last thing we need is for the very first resident to DIAF, on her very first day.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6215/6331743894_b8bba3719c.jpg"">
Aaaaaaaand this is what happens when she cooks!  No fire yet, though, thank God.  Give it time.  I'm sure she'll cause one eventually.  She's kind of a hot mess.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6045/6331743974_353a6fb4af.jpg"">
Port Dover is not a pig pen, but she is constantly filthy and digging holes and stuff.  I've never had to deal with a dog that's needed so many baths.  Arva does not have time to give you baths every day!

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6049/6331744024_1a38624ecc.jpg"">
<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6102/6331744074_0ea5670796.jpg"">
Arva scolds her for being filthy, but she's a good owner.  She gives Port Dover love afterwards...right in the pee.  Yeah, PD has a tendency to pee on the sidewalk.  An entire yard to pee in, yet she always pees on the sidewalk.  Still, I suppose it's better than peeing in the house.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6036/6331744166_ec15c9bd82.jpg"">
..........I'd rather she pee in the house than this.  This is at least the second time she's tried to destroy the second bed.  And both times, Arva had to wake up to scold her, so that she wouldn't completely ruin the second bed.  She can't afford another bed!  She could barely even afford this one?

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6096/6331744318_64d319558c.jpg"">
Fucking dog.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6111/6331744380_f747efe63f.jpg"">
Serves you right.  I do not feel sorry for you.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6234/6330992345_315e31bd4d.jpg"">
Arva's not doing much better.  She needs money, but the only thing she seems able to dig up are water pipes.  And then it takes her forever to fill them back in.  This one here took probably about ten 'fill in's.  Apparently it's because she has no body skill, so she doesn't have the strength to fill them in.  At least that's what I was told when I googled it.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6044/6330992405_0af912da32.jpg"">
See?  Still spraying.  Also, apparently Port Dover reeks so much, they can smell her from across the yard.  Now that's impressive.   Stupid dog.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6120/6330992443_6003ba78d8.jpg"">
Onto happier times.  Hello hot mail lady!

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6046/6331744692_16e7b86f49.jpg"">
And hello even hotter paper girl!  You two will make great additions to the families in Maplecliffe.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6054/6331744760_732b57aeda.jpg"">
So cute.  XD

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6053/6331744802_b14c2ca545.jpg"">
Aaaaaaaaand then she turned into a plant sim.  This is what happens when you spend all day tending your garden but can't afford the ladybug houses and thus have to spray everything.  She's my first plant sim, and I effing hate it already.  But, because phone options aren't available until the population reaches 500, there's no cure for her.  D8

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6096/6331744866_99d131653b.jpg"">
At least I can give her normal skin.  That's something, I guess.  I love that she doesn't need to sleep, but nights are rough without the sun, and I can't find the damn heat lamp.  I've been looking.  And, even when all three bars are full, at night she gets into terrible moods that seems to have no cure at all.  

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6054/6330992769_5c5c74b55d.jpg"">
She is adorable when she gives off spores of happiness though.  Now she just needs someone to live with, so that they can benefit from them.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6238/6330992789_d1ae233cd4.jpg"">
And, by the time her first week is up, Arva's earned her gold gardening badge!  Yay!

And, so after that very disappointing first week with Arva, we move onto our second household in Maplecliffe!  

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6231/6330992845_de7ae9f424.jpg"">
Meet Max Storybook.  He's a Romance/Knowledge sim who wants to be a celebrity chef.  Unfortunately, since there are no restaurants in the area, so he's just going to have to be master chef of the household.  :(  He likes logical girls who like to pretty themselves up.  No bearded ladies.

Also, he's really hot.  XD

Oh, and the thing with his name:  I've decided that the naming scheme for the Storybook's is that each generation will have names based on different characters from books.  Max's namesake is Max, from Where the Wild Things Are.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6223/6331745020_3e07b6ccbb.jpg"">
He gets a pre-made starter house, which I already hate because there are no flat surfaces outside, but he can't afford to flatten the land.  He only got $16,000 to start with.  He'll just have to deal with lumpy ground for now.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6096/6330992989_625e29fdf9.jpg"">
Arva is Max's first visitor!  But apparently they can't speak to each other because the ground is uneven.  >:(  Stupid pre-made lot.  They hit it off when they finally are able to talk though!

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6055/6331745120_72cedbd51a.jpg"">
And Max rolled yes to a mini-challenge, and this is the one he got.  Easy enough for a first challenge.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6101/6331745172_f94f524e5b.jpg"">
<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6110/6331745220_fdbd577562.jpg"">
I love him so much.  Max is so adorable.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6239/6331745248_12c74aba80.jpg"">
<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6053/6331745310_a5c2373ebb.jpg"">
One of Max's wants is to woohoo, and who should he meet, but <lj user=""lauriethemuppet"">'s Thea Ouroboros.  Immediately, they hit it off and spend most of the night getting to know each other. 

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6097/6331745326_14fe9e4040.jpg"">
This is a good sign!

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6240/6330993241_7dfc541d1f.jpg"">
He also hits it off with the hot mail lady.  Also a good sign!

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6044/6330993289_9537fab652.jpg"">
Yay, treasure chest!  Now Max can buy his store!

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6110/6331745458_e0774db8f7.jpg"">
Here it is!  It's just tiny for now, and he just sells miscellaneous sculpture decorations for now, until he's skilled enough to sell something else.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6106/6331745502_c896afb7c3.jpg"">
Max's first customer!  Yay!

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6098/6330993437_30e5471e8e.jpg"">
Max has no employees because he can't afford any, so as soon as the first person goes to cash, he shuts the place down so that he can ring everyone up. 

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6211/6330993481_39417b6b94.jpg"">
Once the customers are gone, Max restocks the almost empty shelves.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6235/6331745642_97ba60e600.jpg"">
<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6214/6330993605_4c8e9b4b28.jpg"">
Max decides to try to make friends with Alabama, but Alabama doesn't seem to want to get to know Max.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6114/6330993663_719b6f3e9e.jpg"">
Aww, poor Max.  He tries so hard.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6093/6330993699_9bb38bbd2d.jpg"">
Effing dog.  All Max wanted was to be your friend.  :(

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6119/6331745844_989d6b9212.jpg"">
Max has a bronze badge in fishing, yet apparently he still isn't able to stay on his feet.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6230/6331745898_fec75c4fdd.jpg"">
But finally, after several hours, he finally catches a fish!  This is going to be a long, long process.  Thankfully, once Arva gets enough money together, she'll be able to open a grocery store, so he won't have to fish to be able to eat.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6237/6330993865_bc99b8f68b.jpg"">
<b>Max:</b><i>You want ME to flirt with her?  *whines*</i>
Dude, you're a romance sim, and you've been gushing over her since you first met her.  Just flirt with her already!

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6103/6330993907_0ff57fd083.jpg"">
<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6111/6330993959_62ec3396f3.jpg"">
See, that wasn't so hard, was it?   Thea clearly loves the gesture.  And with that, Max is that much closer to getting his big want.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6034/6330993991_f6edb346ff.jpg"">

After that, it's pretty much smooth sailing from there.  Nothing but kissing and flirting and dancing.  I love dates, mostly because as long as they like each other at all, it's a great way to get aspiration and mood up.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6215/6331746246_4d15536477.jpg"">
Um, Max, you do realize that if you DO fertilize her eggs, you're going to have to marry her so that the kid(s) will have your last name, right?  Just saying.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6049/6330994135_bb431ac755.jpg"">
He didn't care.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6230/6330994171_3d3514916c.jpg"">
Look at you, struttin' that ass after the date's over.  Yeah, you know you got it.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6096/6331746368_735a9e6ac4.jpg"">
She knows you've got it too.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6224/6331746454_e5bb30c08d.jpg"">
She likes what she sees.  Now if only he would get rid of his fear of a relationship.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6091/6330994343_d8a3affe1d.jpg"">
I don't know who keeps kicking the can over, but she even autonomously cleans up his garbage for him.  If that isn't a sign of true love, I don't know what is.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6237/6331746542_e5f6a69c9f.jpg"">
Meanwhile, Max meets Dany, one of the neighbourhood strays.  She has cool eyes, so immediately, he starts trying to make friends.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6109/6331746608_3606245b4f.jpg"">
Finally, once the week is almost up, the repo man comes for compensation for the unpaid bills.  Well, at least he isn't taking body parts.  I wonder if there's a genetic opera repoman default replacement.  I've got to look.  That would be awesome.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6019/6330994511_8693d07714.jpg"">
The repoman takes a little vase sculpture thing, an outdoor light, Max's mirror, and this fish thing.  Could be worse.  At least he mostly took stuff that doesn't matter.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6218/6331746690_5c335bea31.jpg"">
Ooh, sparkly fish.  It's pretty much the only thing left in his fridge, so he's going to have to fish more pretty soon, else he'll go hungry.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6038/6331746706_5d23099a25.jpg"">
And we'll finish off the week with Thea visiting Max at the store for a little pick-me-up.  Yeah, they're soulmates, even though he denies it with every fibre of his being.

<hr>

Shy and Share are sisters AND best friends!  XD

Well, at least their first interaction after becoming a teen wasn't a noogie!  Yay for something different!

Shy's a good bowler!  And she looks so cute while doing it too!  You'd never know from looking at this picture that she's got no nice points at all to her name.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6102/6304433675_fb86832542.jpg"">
Shy and the good witch aren't getting off to a great start.  And NOW the 0 nice points come out.  Apparently she was saving them for him.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6058/6304433789_df0e5cec9a.jpg"">
Gee, I wonder why he won't let you hug him, Shy.  Maybe because you practically took his head off about a minute ago.  

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6237/6304433861_ef40522418.jpg"">

So cute!  Take a good last look at adult Sapph...

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6111/6304959092_c23a34f04b.jpg"">
And say hello to Elder!Sapph!  She's still gorgeous!  

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6045/6304434059_3df543fb4e.jpg"">
Jan still wants her, granny panties and all!

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6239/6304959268_5cd4bd91a3.jpg"">
Lotus got fired from her job and then ran away, so Shy hops on the phone to report it.  Poor Lotus.  I don't think I've ever had a pet run away before.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6237/6304434201_0d2b3506cd.jpg"">
While Lotus is gone, her baby grows up!  Welcome, Adult!Polite!

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6059/6304959426_683890468f.jpg"">
Jan is old now, but she's still gorgeous!  I was really lucky this time.  I never have TWO great-looking elders at the same time. 8)

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6234/6304434393_bbf36c092e.jpg"">
Shy invites the good warlock over, and after just a few massages and friendly hugs, he agrees to turn her into a witch!

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6051/6304434469_8a21a60363.jpg"">
Ooh, pretty.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6103/6304434625_26d0c74c72.jpg"">
Shy invites Gretchen here home from school, and immediately, they start heartfarting all over each other.  She's pretty enough, and we'll be switching hoods after this generation, so she'll do for now.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6216/6304434743_33b93bd252.jpg"">
As soon as they started flirting with each other, Shy got a want to buy a love potion, and since she's generation purple, I had to oblige!

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6094/6304959894_9247c9d6d1.jpg"">
<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6047/6304434937_f5106cea87.jpg"">
<b>Shy:</b><i> Whew!  Ready to get my flirt on!  She'll never be able to resist me now!</i>
Uh, Shy, she couldn't resist you before.  The potion might be going a bit overboard.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6114/6304960164_03b7133bbd.jpg"">
They actually got along <i>worse</i> after she took the potion.  It took a few tries to get to this point, even though they both wanted it.  Stupid faulty love potion.  That matchmaker's a fraud!

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6051/6304960408_80814711c3.jpg"">
Finally though, Gretchen gives Shy her first kiss!  And from there on out, it's pretty much a piece of cake.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6046/6304435453_579e57e675.jpg"">
*has a feeling Gretchen may be a succubus*  *shudder*
<b>Shy:</b><i> Meh, She's still doable.</i>

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6119/6304960570_a560a580d0.jpg"">
Lotus came back!  Yay!  She looks so enthused about it.
<b>Lotus:</b><i> Damn neighbours, bringing me home. *grumble*</i>

When any of my sims go on a date, when they reach Dream Date status, I usually just leave them alone for the rest of the date, cause it gets boring once they hit the top mark anyway.  So after Shy and Gretchen hit Dream Date status, I left them alone and checked on every one else in the family.  A little while later, this girl showed up on the lot, and, forgetting that Shy and Gretchen were still on a date, had Shy try to flirt with her.  I remembered as Shy was flirting, so it was too late to stop her.  Thankfully, it didn't go over so well, and everything went downhill really quickly, so no harm done!  Except maybe with the relationship between these two, but meh, we'll never see this girl again anyway, so who cares?  lol.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6046/6304435943_56a7d6bd4b.jpg"">
Gretchen is none the wiser!  They're really cute together.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6228/6304436025_459915ea76.jpg"">
Ooh, Sapph!  Get down with your bad self!

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6091/6304961104_efe75d2f78.jpg"">
Yay, two plaques down!  Games and Literature.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6216/6304436153_4aaa2b6eea.jpg"">
Aubergine, you little fucker!  That's the second couch you've ruined!  This is gen 1!  The Prides aren't made of money!

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6220/6304436247_46b470e4f2.jpg"">
So, when Rhys Rowan happens by, Jan invites him in and offers to give him Aubergine.  He readily accepts.  Poor bastard.  Luckily, he doesn't actually have a couch for Aubergine to ruin, or at least, not that we know of.  XD

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6051/6304961390_692c684b34.jpg"">
Sorry, Rhys, Jan is so not into that shit.  Maybe in another generation, if there are ever any boys born.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6051/6304436433_0bdbee79df.jpg"">
Ooh, glowey.  Preeeeeeetty.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6115/6304961578_14c6c9c671.jpg"">
vadljva;lvjha, she's so goddamn cute.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6213/6304961702_d0076235d1.jpg"">
Who needs bowling when you can suck each other's faces off?  In front of everyone else.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6050/6304436723_336e232dc7.jpg"">
Wow, Gretchen must've really loved that date.  I wonder if there's a hack that makes Sims give gifts that are more appropriate to their financial situation.  I love when townies give gifts like these, but it kind of feels like cheating a little bit.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6213/6304961824_6ca7c3f10e.jpg"">
Man, I really wish this guy was coming with them to the new hood.  He's so pretty, and he's got giant elf ears!  So cool.  If I can find him, maybe I'll clone him over.  He's adorable.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6046/6304961928_f3392da113.jpg"">
Aww, poor LED died, and I missed the death.  Bye LED!  You were a great founding cat.  8(

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6216/6304962002_706218dca5.jpg"">
Shy wanted to make out with two sims or wanted two lovers or something, and I had to give her what she wanted!  So she used the crystal ball to find this girl, whose name slips my mind.  They hit it off quickly.  Shy really loves grabbing girls' asses.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6019/6304437115_7647316ced.jpg"">
And then...the girl gets a little obsessed with her.  Apparently she's content to just stand around and watch as Shy learns her magics.
<b>Shy:</b><i>Fine, you can stay.  Just don't block the candle light.</i>

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6042/6304962142_f50fa327c9.jpg"">
Finally, it's time for Shy to head off to college.  Share went at some point too, but I have no idea when.  She was boring, and Shy's amazing, so there were hardly any pictures of her once Shy turned into a teen.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6035/6304962212_1158ce9ac0.jpg"">
She's still absolutely beautiful though!  This is YA!Share.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6116/6304437331_abaae77383.jpg"">
And YA!Shy, who, obviously, is our heir.  I'm not sold on the hair and will probably go back to her teen hair or something, but she's still gorgeous.

Now, I played all the way through college, but it was super boring, and as soon as I started, all I wanted to do was quit, so there aren't many pictures, and they're not that interesting.  Plus, all I want to do is start the BaCC challenge!  You'll see these guys again at some point soon, just not right away, since they're not going to be my first family.  I want to add all four of them to the hood at the same time, so I'm going to have to wait till I have enough CAS sims saved up.  So this is it for now!  Stay tuned to see what happens in the future!

Yeah, I hate the older kids who don't dress up.  They deserve no candy!  I gave some out to them anyway, but really?  You can't even put on a mask or some make up or something?  Ridiculous.  The kids who did dress up, though, were adorable.  I love Halloween!

Well, after another very long absence, I'm back with another update of the Pride Awesomesauce legacy!  In previous updates, Sapphic Sapphire Pride met and fell in love with policewoman Jan.  They got married and had two daughters together--Share and Shy.  And uh....well, that's all that's really important, I think.  Or, that's all I can remember, and I don't feel like going back to see what else has happened.  I'm sure it won't be too difficult to jump right in.  Lol.  Let's go!

<lj-cut text=""Follow the path of evil.  Muahahaha!"">

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6034/6249165484_a7f105e2cf.jpg"">
We'll start off with an adorable picture of Shy looking adorable.  *snuggles*

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6215/6248638879_8b7923e258.jpg"">
And one of Share potty training her little sister.  I can never get enough of this expression.  It's so cute.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6056/6249165602_6846885d39.jpg"">
Aaand one of Sapph and Jan getting it on on the couch.  These two never stop.  Seriously.  Luckily, they're adorable together, so I don't mind.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6097/6249165664_5fed7f1ab6.jpg"">
No.  I'm trying to keep the number of kids down a little bit.  Too many kids are hard to handle.  I feel like I'm not able to play everyone properly when there are so many kids.  So no.  Two is enough.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6109/6248639097_d67ebebaed.jpg"">
Share heads to the community lot to buy some clothes, and on the way, proves how much she fails at the dance sphere.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6221/6249165854_ee1812370c.jpg"">
And then she picks a fight with this hot chick.  Her 4 nice points are coming out to play!

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6057/6248639215_91422e7f5a.jpg"">
But she did meet and bring home Frances Bear, the evil witch.  I love her just for her name.  It's epic.  Plus, she's hot.  Maybe not as hot as Jan, but that's pretty difficult to do.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6045/6249166002_6f20c71d73.jpg"">
<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6221/6249166078_4502e6d824.jpg"">
And lo, a witch is made!

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6171/6249166130_a4faf62288.jpg"">
Her first spell!  I think she looks awesome as an evil witch, but ugh, I hate the cockroaches the spell creates.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6221/6248639445_f15358601d.jpg"">
Adorable Shy is adorable!

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6178/6248639523_e59833f333.jpg"">
Even when she's eating cat food.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6216/6249166352_d9bbddd5eb.jpg"">
Or sleeping in the cat bed.  I love that they can do this.  I think it's such an adorable action.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6168/6249166408_3a46f0088f.jpg"">
But soon it's birthday time!  I'm glad.  As cute as toddlers are, I get bored with them.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6156/6248639691_9940b3cd4f.jpg"">
Spitting image of Sapph!  She looks a little awkward at this age though.  Such strong features look weird on kids.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6179/6248639733_6cbd8df0ce.jpg"">

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6038/6248639845_2ec439566f.jpg"">
She definitely has her moments though.  I love this little girl.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6235/6249166680_59770c6af0.jpg"">
Share's so evil.  I wonder if good witches have expressions that are as cute as this.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6092/6249166742_6e105fdd6f.jpg"">
I hate Maxis make up.  It looks so gross and whorish.  It boggles my mind how Maxis could think it looks good.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6228/6249166790_772ff72fea.jpg"">
She doesn't live up to her image, as she turns Share down.  C'mon, the slutty make up, the short skirt and school girl uniform?  What was Share supposed to think?

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6169/6249166858_4e3b9c5548.jpg"">
Whatever.  She's not hot enough for Share anyway.  She'll find someone else.  In the meantime, she uses her skills to successfully get herself and Shy into private school!  After dealing with a glitch with the headmaster in my Ontario Legacy, I was afraid that the same thing would happen here, but thankfully, there weren't any real problems.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6117/6248640197_b8710b319e.jpg"">
I love her so fucking much.

Sapph makes one hot game designer.  Yum.

Hello hot maid!  I can't wait for a male heir.  This guy is definitely spouse material.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6108/6248640347_d5e00f6679.jpg"">
So is this guy.  The games guy just came by to give Sapph the gaming plaque.  I say, any reason to have him over is fine by me.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6113/6248640373_4fb4a8222e.jpg"">
Yay, first plaque!

This is Aubergine.  The family got him as a companion for Lotus.  He's so cute!

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6211/6249167302_e978991b2b.jpg"">
Aubergine and Lotus's first meeting.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6092/6249167364_7768819864.jpg"">
That didn't take long!  First meeting, and they're already getting it on.  Lotus appears to be a bit of a slut.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6175/6248640639_1f78a45157.jpg"">
He looks pretty satisfied.  Aubergine is one smug fat cat.  And so fat that his collar doesn't even show through.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6159/6249167442_cb873faf43.jpg"">
Shy tries her hand at cooking.  It doesn't go well.  I wonder what dictates the outcome of food from the kiddie stove.  It almost always turns out burnt, no matter how quickly they take it out of the oven.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6036/6248640745_aff27bb320.jpg"">
Share invites Frances on a date on the community lot, and they get off to a great start!  And I just realized that if they were to get married, and she took Frances's last name, she'd be Share Bear.  lmao!  It was meant to be!

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6098/6248640817_2f5a466a72.jpg"">
They're so into each other that even a fight can't grab their attention.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6219/6249167676_60e09bfa1e.jpg"">
Share gives her v-card to Frances in the most romantic of settings--the photo booth.  And then they just go back to making out again. But then, what do you expect from two people who very obviously belong together?

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6154/6249167748_68a8e700e3.jpg"">
Though, just because she and Frances are meant to be, it doesn't mean she can't <i>look</i> at other women now and again.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6171/6249167810_1af5714066.jpg"">
They're so in love.  ^.^

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6103/6249167882_9e0340e900.jpg"">
Frances loved the date so much, she gave Share a statue!  Hope that means she's loaded!

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6228/6249167936_4a4d784c55.jpg"">
In other news, Shy has gotten a sunburn, and she's not happy.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6178/6249167982_67e3db3d79.jpg"">
And then, once that's cleared up, Share becomes a typical big sister and torments her.  Poor kid.  She's got such a hard life.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6049/6249168038_358a1d8d12.jpg"">
But that's okay, because pretty soon, it's her birthday!  Now she'll be able to torment Share just as much!  

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6114/6249168082_40f864804f.jpg"">
But first, we interrupt this birthday for a special appearance by Aubergine, who's somehow, despite his, uh, girth, has managed to get up onto the counter and into the soup!

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6097/6249168158_ca43446bb2.jpg"">
Oh yeah, and the birth of his and Lotus's offspring!  I suppose this is the first born of the black generation, so we've named him/her (I can't remember which) Polite, after one of the long lost care bears who watched over Paradise in one episode.  I really, really wish that Lotus had given birth to two kittens so that I could name the other one Perfect, but meh, maybe she'll have another litter at some point.

<img src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6161/6249168210_64a9882d35.jpg"">
And finally, Shy as a teen!  She's effing gorgeous.  I don't know how I'm going to be able to choose between them.  She rolled Romance/Family, with a LTW to become chief of staff.

That's it for now!  I'm almost caught up to where I'm actually at in the game now, but hopefully I'll get a little more playing in tomorrow so that I can get another update out soon, for reals this time.  Hope you enjoyed!

No.  For one thing, there will always be power hungry people in the world with the means and the lack of conscience to take what they want without regard to others.  There will always be people willing to kill to get what they want.  Also, there will also always be prejudice in the world, and people willing to do everything they can for their cause because they believe so vehemently in it.

Secondly, there's no money in peace.  Look at the billions of dollars a year that go into the war effort, money spent on weapons and tanks and the latest technology all in the name of ""peace.""  If there was world peace, then these powerful companies wouldn't make any money, so no, I don't think there will ever be world peace."

<lj-cut text=""Wake up and pay attention!"">

We're back!  Last time on The Pride Awesomesauce Legacy, we met Sapphic Sapphire Pride, our new founder!  She and her cat, LED, moved into a little blue house on the edge of town to start her new life in Fabuland.  After meeting and striking out with a few of the ladies in town, she adopted a kitten named Denim.  Enter Jan, the cop who brought Denim to her new owner.  Immediately, there was a connection, and after a couple of dates, Jan moved in, and they got married.  We left off with Sapph just about to give birth to their first baby.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3100/5872157142_7135f9fe33.jpg"">
And here she is!  Her name is Share, as in the Care Bear.  While reading other people's awesomesauce and rainbow legacies, I was able to come up with a lot of names, but now that I've started my own?  Not a one.  So there are going to be a lot of names based on characters from tv and movies and cartoons and the like.  

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5038/5871599029_f31393097d.jpg"">
Aww, Jan is a good mommy.  Their romantic first night back from their honeymoon will have to be cut short, but it's okay.  They'll have some time alone once they put Share to bed.

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5068/5872157268_658731db6a.jpg"">
I really, really like the paper girl, though apparently not enough to remember her name.  I really want her in the legacy.  And she's really good with Denim too!  Too bad she's got black hair.  She'll just have to wait a few generations.

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5271/5872157330_3fb19cb291.jpg"">
Babies are boring, so yay birthday time!

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3070/5871599203_bb36d56a78.jpg"">
Which is interrupted for more baby making, this time of the feline variety.

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5227/5872157428_a2d0d1e81a.jpg"">
Cuuuuuuuuuute.  I love that she's got Sapph's eyes.  Not sure I like the skin tone, but she's so adorable.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3143/5872157490_c54d9a2e58.jpg"">
See?  Cuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuute.  And I realize she's not in purple.  At this point, they didn't have enough money to buy purple clothes, but they went out and got some as soon as they did.  Also, you can't see them, but she's got elf ears.  Large elf ears.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3080/5872157510_cf37b60f09.jpg"">
Even when she's on the potty, she's cute.  Aww, she's learning!  She's so smart.  With the help of smart milk, she learned all four skills in one go, which couldn't have taken more than 12 hours.  She is so made of win.

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5148/5872157582_7f5d7a536c.jpg"">
Jan's adorable too.  She taught Share all of her toddler skills while Sapph worked.

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5149/5872157628_d49d93171a.jpg"">
I love watching the cats play with the toy mouse, especially when they go all crazy.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3072/5871599445_72b6821474.jpg"">
At some point almost every single day, Freya Knight steals their paper.  I have no idea why.  As far as I know, neither Sapph nor Jan have ever even met her, yet every day, there she is, stealing it.  One morning, she stole it before the papergirl had even left the lot. 

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5154/5872157718_b23663ff71.jpg"">
Ooh, hot games guy!  We'll join your club any day!  Or well, maybe a male descendant will.  

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5022/5872157772_4ee512e81f.jpg"">
The film and lit chick can join the legacy anytime too.  Rawr.

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5068/5872157818_d8cf46bf68.jpg"">
Let's try for baby #2!

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5265/5871599645_741f5c812a.jpg"">
See?  I'm sure that Sapph scolding Freya will improve the situation tenfold.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3264/5872157908_f4760b6648.jpg"">
*ASPLODEY FROM THE CUTE*

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5196/5871599779_2c7fba878f.jpg"">
Holy crap, FOUR kittens.  Three females--Amethyst, Lilac and Lotus--and one male named I.Q., after the purple sprite from Rainbow Brite.  XD

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5276/5871599817_ca790ded35.jpg"">
Finally got around to buying blue undies and pj's for Jan and blue clothes for Share.  We could only afford toddler purple clothes though, so they'll have to go back out once she becomes a kid.

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5316/5871599877_d89878f055.jpg"">
Which is pretty much right now.

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5065/5872158110_9ce8e4b7b6.jpg"">
Still really cute!  I think she's got a skin tone from the same set as <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/14600962@N05/5611793023/in/photostream"">London Ontario</a>, from my other legacy.  Both have the same beaver teeth.  As long as she doesn't open her mouth, she'll be fine.

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5111/5871599955_8e30e28f68.jpg"">
I love watching kittens play.  They're so tiny and cute!  This is Amethyst and Lilac.

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5147/5871600031_78520914a9.jpg"">Share's such a good kid!  I didn't even have to tell her to clean!

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3035/5872158294_0a701a710b.jpg"">
This is part of the reason why I never bother with pets: I always forget to have my sims teach them tricks.  So they stay in the bottom level of their careers their whole life.  I'm trying though!  At least Denim will get to level 2.  

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3251/5872158364_fc0378381f.jpg"">
<b>Sapphire:</b> Pssh.  I got this game.  Piece of cake.

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5262/5871600199_f901f77000.jpg"">
Preeeeeeeeeeeeetty.

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5306/5871600257_a01990aebc.jpg"">
Ooh, also pretty!  He could make some interesting kidlets.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3203/5871600325_58512733da.jpg"">
Aww, it's Numair Knight, property of <lj user=""simsforaranya"">!  Hi Numair!
<b>Share:</b> My lemonade is very good!  A perfect blend of lemons, sugar and water, plus a touch of my special ingredient.  You'll love it.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3090/5871600375_ba249bd1ef.jpg"">
<b>Share:</b> Now pay up!

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3164/5871600433_c99f91d5f9.jpg"">
Effing chance cards.  It took DAYS to finally get Jan a job in journalism.  Finally, she gets to go, and gets a chance card on the very first day.  Guess who got fired.  Poor Jan.  Effing chance cards.

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5271/5872158694_fd0d191770.jpg"">
And it just gets worse from there.  Jan had a want to woohoo in public, and since Share needed purple clothes anyway, I decided to send them all to the community lot.  Sapph had a want to take a picture in a photo booth, so I figured, hey, great, I can boost both of their moods.  Not so.  I decided to get them to take the picture first, not realizing that Jan had a fear of taking a picture.  Well, that plus low aspiration from losing her job just sent her over the edge.  Whoops. 

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5228/5872158746_fa090879a7.jpg"">
Such a caring and considerate wife you are, Sapph.  I'm sure she's feeling so lucky to have you right now.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3224/5872158810_801f0f29e5.jpg"">
Nothing a little visit from the shrink won't cure.

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5038/5871600657_e9eafd1bbd.jpg"">
And a round in the photo booth does even better!  Though maybe they could've avoided doing it in front of Share?

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5160/5872158898_6953eaae9a.jpg"">
Jan's pregnant, and it doesn't seem to be going that well.  I have the feeling I've got another <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/14600962@N05/5547333810/in/photostream"">Belleville Ontario</a> on our hands.  *facepalm*

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5034/5872158944_3f0186b00c.jpg"">
And that night, my fears are proved right.  Even though she was sleeping, her hunger and energy were both below 50%.  She got up in the middle of the night and miscarried.  Sometimes I really hate that I've got that hack.

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5034/5872159002_1927b98880.jpg"">
Poor thing.  She's just devastated.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3294/5871600805_aab9b0f8d8.jpg"">
<b>Sapph:</b> Ugh, I have to <i>comfort</i> her?  Why do you do this to me?
She's your wife, Sapph, and she's hurting.  And might I remind you that this was your child too.  Be there for her.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3293/5872159114_17de695dcf.jpg"">
<b>Sapph:</b> There there.  It's hard now, but it'll get easier.  You'll see.  We'll try again.
That's better.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3013/5871600917_bf8ab27de3.jpg"">
The kittens are all growed up!  This is Amethyst.

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5235/5872159206_b8e41dfc90.jpg"">
This is I.Q.

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5107/5871600997_6c1d08aea4.jpg"">
Lilac.

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5039/5871601065_4ce05a2f24.jpg"">
And our kitty heir, Lotus!  I love her colouring.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3265/5872159386_0b637bee11.jpg"">
First day of school, and Share already has an A+.  She is awesome.  That is all.

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5231/5871601223_5eb83a0300.jpg"">
Sapphire was out tending the tree when suddenly lightning struck her.  Thankfully her motives weren't low, so it didn't kill her.  Made her pretty nasty though.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3296/5871601279_d08d2a58de.jpg"">
And just to make things worse....

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5154/5871601323_b58da8aa6e.jpg"">
So much fail in such a short amount of time. 

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3251/5872159656_7c71b9066d.jpg"">
Dammit...kitty!  I can't tell if that's I.Q. or LED.  There are way too many cats in this house.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3217/5871601411_548603f722.jpg"">
So Jan gives Amethyst to Lavender Rowen.  Fitting, I think, both owner and pet with purple names.  I.Q. and Lilac went to random townies.

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5199/5872159766_feeb141bac.jpg"">
Second try at pregnancy!  Hopefully this time she'll be able to carry the baby to term.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3181/5871601521_162fd6a524.jpg"">
I don't remember this kid's name, but Share brought him home from school.  He's cute!  Maybe he'll get to grow up with her.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3288/5872159882_0974ff56d7.jpg"">
She's made a friend!  Yay!  Which is good.  I noticed after her first day of school that no one has brought anyone home from work, so I spent two days trying to figure out which hack was the problem.  Things seem to be fixed now!  Yay!

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3254/5872159950_edf239ecac.jpg"">
Thank God she made it through the pregnancy this time.  I don't think I could've taken it if she lost the baby again.  Seeing her cry like that broke my heart.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3279/5872160016_893599a9bb.jpg"">
Another baby girl!  This is Shy, as in Shy Violet, the purple colour kid from Rainbow Brite.  Now I wish I hadn't given away I.Q. to a neighbour.  It would've been cool to have Shy and her sprite/cat.

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5111/5872160080_4f8a5b63b5.jpg"">
I love these shots.  They're so cute.  Just so sweet and loving, even if I do have to actually prompt her to cuddle her own daughter.

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5157/5872160164_3fdd91945c.jpg"">
Well, I guess she can't win all the time.  I almost didn't want to give her a stove in the first place, cause I hate all the burnt muffins laying around when they cook, but she wanted a toy, so I got it for her.  Hopefully I won't regret it.

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5111/5872160216_476e2138ee.jpg"">
She's got five mechanical points.  Please don't electrocute her, computer!

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5230/5872160278_87d3b2fc9c.jpg"">
Birthdays for both girls!

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3158/5871601999_d2ffc5ef5a.jpg"">
Aww, Jan and Shy are so cute!  And she already wins.  She grew up into that purple hair and those purple clothes.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3229/5872160388_c26f201184.jpg"">
Toddler!Shy!  Omg, the cute, it burns!  She looks so much like Sapph.  And both she and Share have Sapph's elf ears too.  Love.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3180/5872160464_73ac4f639d.jpg"">
Holy crap, gorgeous.  I don't know how I'm going to be able to decide between the two of them.  Little Jan or little Sapph?  It might just have to go to a poll.  Anyway, Share rolled Fortune/Pleasure with a LTW to become the Law.

That's it for now!  Next time...I'm not sure, cause I haven't gotten that far.  There'll be a witch or two though!

Hello!  After reading <lj user=""simsforaranya"">'s Pie Awesomesauce Legacy, I just had to try one for myself.  So here it is!  The Pride Legacy.  I'm going to try to follow all the rules, though I might send some of the kids to college.  I haven't decided yet.  And I'm going to try to follow the two kids rule, but I'm terrible with that kind of rule.  My legacy families tend to have more kids than I know what to do with, but I'm going to try to tone it down.  Fingers crossed! 

Oh, and since this is the Pride legacy, every heir is going to be gay or lesbian.

I think that's it for now.  Enjoy!

This is Sapphic Sapphire Pride.  She's a total hottie.  She's a Pleasure/Popularity Sim who wants nothing more than to be a Game Designer.  She loves logical blondes but isn't into hats.  And, fittingly enough, her favourite hobby is playing games.  

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3229/5810677615_092260991b.jpg"">
And this is her cat, LED.  I realize now that I should've made his eyes blue rather than green, but meh, he's already here.  LED loves counters.  Apparently they're more comfortable than the floor.  Sapph doesn't have enough money for a cat bed yet.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2664/5810677677_bfbe386a3a.jpg"">
And this is their little house!  I think this is the first legacy I've done where there are actual walls and everything.  Except maybe when I started the Apocalypse Challenge.  But Julien Veilleux only had walls because he'd freeze his little pixelated ass off if I hadn't put walls up.  Either way, Sapph should feel lucky.  And who's that guy enjoying the nice spring day?

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2281/5811242274_a449e81710.jpg"">
Why it's the local garden club president!  I don't remember his name because Sapph never actually interacted with him, but he's....alright-looking.  A possibility for later generations.  Maybe.  

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3608/5811242362_b7ca375c28.jpg"">
The paper girl can join the legacy too, whenever she wants to.  She's so weird-looking, but beautiful.  Hopefully there'll be some pretty descendants when I get away from black hair and decide to come back to it.  

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5277/5811242428_29fe075a37.jpg"">
Apparently this is how sims greet each other in Fabuland.  The welcome wagon consisted of two other women and this one.  Her name is Bim Platz.  I want to add her to the legacy just because of her name.  lol. 

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3455/5810677995_f958ed5406.jpg"">
Nice!  This happened after only about an hour or two of talking.  If you're trying to get into the legacy, Bim, you're on the right track!

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2436/5811242566_5be5ced2cf.jpg"">
LED is fierce.  And not in a good way.  D:<

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3135/5811242618_d128a074c5.jpg"">
What a little asshole.  So much for the bed.  And Sapph can't afford another one, not even the cheapest one, and she doesn't own a couch yet.  Who needs sleep anyway?

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3366/5810678167_313f8a18ac.jpg"">
Oh sure.  Rub it in that you can sleep.  Stupid cat.  You're lucky you're cute.

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5077/5810678227_2465231710.jpg"">
And Sapph forgives him too, before long.  She'll be cursing him that night when she has nowhere to sleep.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3086/5811242756_615dc65fa8.jpg"">
Bim invited Sapph on an outing downtown, and this is apparently the only picture I got of the trip.  That's probably why she's so pissed off.  I suck.  The whole trip was a failure anyway.  Her entire outing party was filled with hot women (plus one dude), and yet she couldn't hit it off with any of them.  So she headed home again.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3415/5811242814_3eed76182d.jpg"">
At which point, one of said hot chicks and the dude started fighting, while another of the hot chicks watched.  Well, at least the outing wasn't a complete failure.  At least we got some fighting out of it.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3490/5810678365_9006d3c49e.jpg"">
And she also got a picture taken.  I wish there were more possibilities for poses in these pictures.  They're cute, but they're all the same.

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5151/5811242898_0fdae3e528.jpg"">
I really suck when it comes to pets.  I think they're cute, but I always end up forgetting about them or getting bored with them, plus it takes too long to teach them tricks for promotions.  And I hate that, when everyone is asleep, the game doesn't automatically go into 3x speed if one pet is awake, even though you can't control them anyway.  BUT.  I really want to give the pet thing a try.  So, in order to try to make babies, Sapph adopts a little brown kitten!  Her name is Denim.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3273/5810678503_c7de90f087.jpg"">
Sapphire really hits it off with Jan, the cop who brought Denim to the house.  Which is awesome, since, as you can see in the relationship panel, she has negative chemistry with EVERY OTHER WOMAN SHE'S MET.  One problem--after Jan left, Sapph was unable to call her.  Her picture just didn't show up in the list, even though they were friends.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3242/5811243016_4956dda509.jpg"">
So she decided to call in an emergency, hoping that Jan would come to her rescue.  Um, yeah, she got this cop instead.  She's good-looking too, but she and Sapphire are furious with each other.  Plus, I just really like Jan.  

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2489/5811243054_103755c1e9.jpg"">
So I had to cheat her back onto the lot.  I used the teleporter shrub to summon her.  Took awhile to find her, but I managed. 

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5038/5811243112_efa7ccdc6f.jpg"">
And one of the first things they do together?  Gossip about that bitch of a cop. 

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2720/5811243174_6b70c3dbeb.jpg"">
They hit it off right away!  And, Jan's already wearing blue.  There's no denying it--they're a perfect match!

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3069/5811243208_68808c444e.jpg"">
Sigh.  Damn chance cards.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3572/5811243254_5fd7daab80.jpg"">
I'm sorry, bb!  I didn't mean to!

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2484/5811243304_2f34927d12.jpg"">
But a date should cheer her up!  Jan called up and invited her out.  How could she say no?  Though crushing on the taxi driver?  Not a good way to win our founder over, Jan.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3279/5811243358_8398c780ec.jpg"">
These two sound like two cats in heat, but they really wanted to sing together, so I let them.  For about five seconds, just long enough for them to both fulfill the want, and then that was in.  No more karaoke until you've both built up your creativity skill!

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2067/5811243404_7fbcf251ed.jpg"">
They spent the rest of the night making out on the couch.  There was no option for woohoo though, for some reason.  Usually the casual option comes up, but not this time.  So, they just get to make out instead.

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5277/5810678939_3af56a6e0f.jpg"">
I guess she didn't mind!  Actually, they woohooed a couple of times when they got back to the house.  So I guess this is Sapphire's prize for putting out.  I like this hood!  Expensive TVs from two different hot women, and she's only been around for a few days.  I wonder if she'd dig up a chest on the first go if she tried.

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5265/5810678979_c2972bf02e.jpg"">
Denim grows up!  I love the way she looks.  Hopefully she and LED will have cool-looking babies.  If Sapph can get them together.  LED is quite aggressive.

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5189/5811243526_6692116db4.jpg"">
Looks like it'll be up to Denim to get the ball rolling.  At least she's somewhat trainable.  LED's kind of an asshole.

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5112/5811243582_86eac9f6e0.jpg"">
Muahaha!  We have...well, I guess whatever the lesbian version of spermination would be.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3169/5811243690_8c96164dca.jpg"">
<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2306/5810679103_c79da3ac50.jpg"">
So, we might as well move Jan in!  I had to summon her again, but here she is!  Gorgeous.  I think I might actually like her more than Sapph in some ways.  She brought $8000 with her.  

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3522/5811243760_f9674cdd93.jpg"">
Though, Sapphire is absolutely gorgeous too.  She's different-looking.

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5274/5810679261_29f1dca049.jpg"">
<b>Sapphire:</b> Will you marry me?
<b>Jan:</b><i> Yess!  Now I can watch the tv I gave her as a gift.  The plan is working!  Quick, act surprised!</i>

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3460/5811243836_79232687cf.jpg"">
<b>Jan:</b> Oh wow, I had no idea!

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2205/5810679349_bb7fd9f2ec.jpg"">
<b>Jan:</b> Of course I'll marry you!
<i>Look at the size of this rock!  Score!</i>
Uh, Jan?  You brought in about 8000 times as much money as Sapph had in her bank account.  There is no way that's real.

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5186/5810679411_27763207ee.jpg"">
Second pop!  Cause I missed the first one.  lol.

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5225/5811243964_dafc22524c.jpg"">
Who the hell are you, and why are you in the girls' house, eating all their food?  Didn't you hear the part about how they're dirt poor?

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2785/5810679503_d280d875f6.jpg"">
The only thing that would make her hotter would be if she had elf ears.  I guess you can't have everything.

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5075/5811244076_ca5fef03eb.jpg"">
Wedding time!  We start off with some fireworks, just to get it off the ground.  I want a roof-raiser, people!

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3109/5810679633_0d79a279e6.jpg"">
<b>Sapphire:</b> I'm so happy!  I love you so much!
<b>Jan:</b> It's fucking freezing out here.  Let's get this shit over with.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2595/5810679717_007783de0a.jpg"">
Wait, I think someone is missing.  And who is that dude near the back?  Sapph only invited women--all the women she tried to hit up before she met Jan, to be specific.  She's got negative chemistry with just about every one of them.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2608/5811244304_990a06b30c.jpg"">
There she is.  Nice of you to join us, Sapph reject whose name I can't remember.  I think the witch is missing too.  We'll need her later on.  Gotta keep up the relationship with her.

Alright, now that almost everyone is here, let's get this party started!

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2304/5811244388_59f06b0e1d.jpg"">
<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2172/5811244460_b59da01631.jpg"">
<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2588/5810679967_0b0a34275b.jpg"">
So adorable.  These two are meant to be together.  Even if Jan only married Sapph so that she could watch the tv she got for her on their second date.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2762/5810680037_0bf0c65ac0.jpg"">
You know you're all crying on the inside.  It could've been one of you up there with Sapphire if she hadn't met Jan.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2186/5810680119_df7eaf9a72.jpg"">
Cake time!  I somehow didn't get a picture of Sapphire stuffing Jan's face with the sticky dessert, but it happened.  My picture-taking skills were terrible this session.  I promise to try to be better next time I play.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2759/5810680181_19b8303415.jpg"">
I'll have to make up for the lack of face-stuffing pictures with this adorable one of Sapphire feeding Jan cake.  Does that make up for things?  A little bit?

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5151/5810680249_a2af573ee9.jpg"">
And then they went off on their honeymoon, and what do they come back to?  One of the guests having broke the sink, now Sapphire has to fix it.
<b>Sapphire:</b> This is cutting into my sexy tiems!  >:(  

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2203/5810680323_d02518c36f.jpg"">
Also cutting into sexy tiems?  Baby tiems!  It is coming!

...Aaand that's where we'll leave it for now.  >:D  You'll just have to wait till next time to see the next generation of Prides!  Until next time, see you later!  Feedback is muchly appreciated!

<lj-cut text=""More nookie inside!  And yes, I just said &#39;nookie&#39;"">

I'm going to apologize in advance for this crappy update.  I'm tired of this generation, and I hate this neighbourhood, plus, it's college, which always gets old about halfway through.  Lol.  Not to mention the fact that there doesn't seem to be a way of randomly generating young adults for college and almost every single dormie, male and female was hideous.  I'm just looking forward to putting them into a new, clean neighbourhood now that I've got the templates right.  Hopefully it'll rejuvenate my love for the Ontarios.  So yes, I apologize for the severely disjointed update.  Apparently in my haste to get through college, I forgot to take lots of pictures. Lol.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3643/5757534378_97d9ab1617.jpg"">
We'll start off this update with Arva looking adorable while rocking out on the base and the drums.  She flocks to the instruments at the first chance she gets, even though her OTH is games.  And she looks so cute, I couldn't resist taking two pictures of her.  XD

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3031/5757534472_a2f2ae2bd9.jpg"">
Wawa's still gorgeous too.  And Osgoode is....around somewhere.  Not hot enough to take a picture of, apparently.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2194/5756989549_cb5dcdd87d.jpg"">
NO.

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5181/5757534688_0d5d58c053.jpg"">
The girls wanted to go shopping, so I sent them to the community lot I made for them.  Osgoode went too, but he's boring, so there are no pictures of him.  Arva immediately rolled a want to win a dance contest.  It only took her two tries to win.  The dude beside her looks kind of like <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/media/rm3427374848/tt0411477"">Prince Nuada</a> from Hellboy II, except with darker skin.  Also, that's Cimorene Ouroboros behind him.  XD

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3199/5757534828_233805492f.jpg"">
Wawa's got next to no body skills and yet she doesn't fail at the dance sphere!  And she looks pretty while winning.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3116/5756990023_f80d4e6137.jpg"">
And when they get back, Daryl morphs into a geezer.  :(  He's not hot anymore.  Also, I know they're not visible in this picture, but I hate that elders have slightly yellowed teeth.  Gross.

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5267/5757535132_3694a18d62.jpg"">
And Caledon and Mackenzie spend their last few adult days sexing it up at every chance they get.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2686/5756990303_e7786ba605.jpg"">
Ah, here's Osgoode, being boring as ever.  I didn't know what to do with him, so I mostly just made him study.  Also, wow, if Wawa had a hoo-haw, you'd definitely be able to see it right there.  Close your legs, woman!

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3056/5756990431_48ec0a440c.jpg"">
This is Angel.  She's Wawa's girlfriend.  And she's pretty.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3060/5757535540_1356dc8a5e.jpg"">
<b>Wawa:</b> You know my brother, Rockwood?  He's a little...well, you know.
Says the girl chatting up her girlfriend.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3478/5756990703_ee29109b0c.jpg"">
<b>Angel:</b> *swoon* I love a woman who can burn the house down with her cooking.  That's what I look for in a woman.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3562/5757535788_f8d2505346.jpg"">
Ugh, Thanks, Angel.  You're a real big help there.

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5224/5757536002_55510dbe5f.jpg"">
They got through it alright though, I think.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2415/5757536106_ebb33ed3c8.jpg"">
So I decided to do the <a href=""http://fightocrime.livejournal.com/52461.html"">Mega List of mini challenges,</a> and the first one I got? 
<b>The Internet Scam Challenge: your household loses all of their money. All their money.</b>
Sigh.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2758/5756991253_4bbabf2bd6.jpg"">
Mack doesn't seem to mind.  She's got her <s>drugs</s> drums to dull the pain.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3257/5757536334_72f234c446.jpg"">
Man, why can't this happen to me?  Then maybe I'd actually use my gym membership instead of sitting here in front of the computer, day in, day out.  lol.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2043/5757536514_85567543f4.jpg"">
*snicker*  Nice outfit, Rock.  You know what?  You can keep it.  You wear your colours proudly.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3088/5757536580_703cd87530.jpg"">
Rockwood first, since there are 9 kids, and only 8 can fit on a uni lot, and he's probably my least favourite of the bunch.  I definitely cheated with him.  I already had to go through the whole thing with the other 8 kids, so I didn't care so much about doing everything for him.  But he did do his first term paper!

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5186/5757536682_4361a0c90a.jpg"">
My main focus for Rockwood was to find him a husband to satisfy Daryl's LTW.  Which wasn't easy, given that almost every single uni student is ridiculously ugly.  This guy, whose name I can't remember, was one of the better ones.  We'll call him Henry for now, since I don't feel like loading up the game to grab his name.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3459/5757536872_1b3e742595.jpg"">
I think they're going to get along just fine.

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5306/5756992021_c796fd7601.jpg"">
More than fine.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3522/5757537120_588b5f9b1a.jpg"">
I let him play with some of the other kids too.

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5303/5756992229_7d16feac9e.jpg"">
And I let him get into a fight or two.  Which, he won, btw.  You know, just for the college experience.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2184/5756992345_7dd81e9454.jpg"">
And then it was time to head back to Canada.  But not before a pop!  A new Ontario is on its way!

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3321/5757537444_cc91250ce0.jpg"">
Back in Canada, Henry moves in.

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5308/5757537562_fb40d1e91e.jpg"">
And a few days later, it's baby time!

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2448/5756992649_f635b21613.jpg"">
<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5149/5756992725_08ae0b9919.jpg"">
And then they get married.  And actually, seeing them together made me like Rockwood a little more.  Not enough to put him in the running for heir though.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3048/5757537790_de5d67a4b9.jpg"">
Oh, and this is their kid.  Her name is Waterdown.  She's actually a lot cuter than I'd thought she'd be.  I think she'll turn out to look like Henry though.  That's not necessarily a good thing.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2492/5756992971_08ba051eac.jpg"">
Now uni time for the rest of the kids!  Nice outfit, Mitchell.  That's two boys in that shirt.  I wonder if he likes boys too.  More on his makeover in a sec.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2254/5757538158_ee406bd126.jpg"">
Here's Osgoode!  His nose is still humongous, I see.  lol.  He's gotten decent-looking though.  Better than he was when he was a teen.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2536/5757538282_8acf093c84.jpg"">
And Grafton!  He's still cute, but I don't know about hot.  And I don't think I like this skin tone either.  I used to love it, back before I got actual good ones, and now this one kind of sucks.  Meh.  Either way, he's not hot enough for heir, but maybe I'll give him a different skin tone when I move them into a new hood.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2622/5756993529_38937a56b0.jpg"">
\Here's Mitchell.  Actually, he's pretty good-looking.  Maybe I'll put him back into the running for heir.  Man, there are too many beautiful possibilities.  I don't know how I'm going to be able to choose.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3017/5756993689_1636fecd30.jpg"">
Dorian has actually lost some of his lustre for me.  Maybe it's the hair.  I can't find one that's great on him.  He's still gorgeous, so he'll still be in the running for heir, but I don't know, I'm don't love him as much as I used to.  We grew apart, I suppose.  lol.

And now onto the girls!

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5224/5757538728_609c51df73.jpg"">
Wawa is still beautiful.  And she does have Angel too, and I do love her.  I'll be moving her over to the new hood too, with everyone else.

<img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1418/5757538852_4a17322e74.jpg"">
Here's London!  She's not quite as beautiful as the others, but there's something about her that I really like.  I don't know what it is.  I worry about what her kids might look like though.  I have the feeling they might look a bit ape-ish.  I think they might have that unfortunate potential.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2091/5756994239_02ed483964.jpg"">
I still love Selby, more than Wawa, I think.  They're so similar, but I think Selby is slightly prettier.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2792/5757539196_261dbaee8d.jpg"">
And finally, Arva.  Absolutely gorgeous.  She's slightly boring, but man, she's so freaking hot.  I think she's probably the prettiest of the four girls.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2112/5756994537_476f9179a6.jpg"">
Selby immediately starts her search for fresh meat.  But she goes back to Canada to get it, because just about every single person in uni is hideous.  This guy's no catch, but he's slightly better than the others.  The problem is, after he leaves, she's unable to call him.  Apparently he doesn't have a phone.  :(

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5265/5757539538_a47fd94a41.jpg"">
Dorion gives it a go too, since this is pretty much the one pretty sim at Sim State.  She loves the flower, but other than that, they didn't get along, unfortunately.  They just had no chemistry, and I didn't feel like making him spend the time trying to increase their relationship.  Not when I had 8 sims to take care of here.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2234/5756994821_22cafa7192.jpg"">
Wawa entertains a visitor of her own, and she has more luck than the others.  

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5188/5756995015_1d1d9bed5c.jpg"">
<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2283/5756995175_f644811bd6.jpg"">
Underwear engagement!  Actually, the first time Wawa asked Angel, she said no, but I was looking at one of the other kids and missed taking pictures.  After a little more wooing, she said yes.  Wawa wasn't going to take no for an answer!

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3081/5756995355_59951d3237.jpg"">
Ew, really, London?  You can do so much better than that dude.  I promise you.

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5142/5757540314_6816a3165c.jpg"">
Yeah, she doesn't care.  Round two!  I put her on birth control though, so that there would be no accidents.  We don't need any bird children around.  This is all ACR, btw.  No way in hell I'd put her with him.  *shudder*  That nose could put out her eye!

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5261/5756995661_e57cb4df6e.jpg"">
And Grafton snagged the only other decent looking dormie in the place.  I can't remember her name though either.  Man, I should've written it down.  We'll call her....Violet. 

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3128/5756995857_c2d64c2036.jpg"">
Violet's all for getting down in the hot tub. 

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3148/5757540802_75958ce2b6.jpg"">
But get engaged?  Hell no!
<b>Violet:</b> Snicker!  You're joking, right?

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2402/5756996193_8fe66fd97f.jpg"">
You're a heartless bitch, Violet.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2474/5757541144_a3ea58422e.jpg"">
<b>Violet:</b> Jeez, what's his problem?  Hey, I know what'll make you feel better...

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5027/5757541314_e7d09e74b9.jpg"">
<b>Violet:</b> More sex!
<b>Grafton:</b> Sounds good to me!  *forgets about broken heart and sexes up*

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5186/5757541482_f8997ec481.jpg"">
I guess she's a little easier after sex.  Yay engagement!

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5269/5756996725_6b1843530a.jpg"">
Osgoode's getting engaged too!  After sex, of course.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2577/5757541760_b29f92d81a.jpg"">
Mitchell and Dorion get a little something of their own.  Hmm, I guess Mitchell really is into girls.  And ew, Dorion.  She's pretty, but she looks exactly like your grandmother.  That's pretty effed up.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2316/5756997029_74f892372b.jpg"">
This is Tyson.  I decided that London was just way too good for bird boy, so the crystal ball gave her this guy.  Much hotter.  I think she agrees.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3504/5757542098_62b4cf2c18.jpg"">
Or, maybe she's just into threesomes.

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5022/5757542258_69aa6420c6.jpg"">
But Tyson's the one she's going to settle down with, whether she likes it or not.  He's coming with her to the new hood too, so if she gets heir, he'll be the spouse.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2358/5757542356_56defab58d.jpg"">
LIAR.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2218/5757542522_f3c27d9c36.jpg"">
<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5021/5756997771_b48633c593.jpg"">
But hey, they did do a little bit of studying.  That is, until about the end of second year.  That's when I was like, eff this, I'm done.  8 sims going through college?  Especially in a hood I hate?  Uh uh.  So I cheated them through the rest of their junior and senior years.  I'll play by the rules next gen.

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5146/5756997941_74d477ac7a.jpg"">
Plus, that's when the dorm started glitching out on me.  Sometimes everything in the kitchen area just disappeared, as if it was part of a dormie's room or something.  Sometimes, when one of the family was in the room, everything would show up again, but then it would disappear as soon as they left again, so that just added to my haste to get them through uni.

So this is the end of uni!  Thank God.  I can't wait to move them into the new hood.  Adult pictures!

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3373/5756998067_e71b71c57a.jpg"">
Grafton!  A very stoned Grafton.  Probably still getting over the heartbreak of Violet's initial rejection.  I can't wait to change his skin tone.  I wonder what he'll look like after the little makeover.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3295/5757543140_54bc9eefb2.jpg"">
Osgoode!  Actually, he doesn't look too bad, though his nose is still too big.  But he's grown on me a little bit.  Not enough to be heir, but still.  lol.

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5301/5756998351_5978e01177.jpg"">
Dorion!  Still don't have quite the right hair, but he's still pretty.  He's still in the running.

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5106/5757543434_a25be0dfbe.jpg"">
Bwahahaha!  Ok, Mitchell has aged into that shirt twice now.  That's got to mean something.  Someone's in denial!

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5104/5756998599_427b2f161d.jpg"">
Wawa's still gorgeous.  And still in the running.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2131/5756998759_27fac7baee.jpg"">
As is London.  She'll be marrying Tyson if she wins. 

And now, the two front-runners:

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2093/5757543874_18fe55a729.jpg"">
Selby.  Eternally beautiful, but maybe too much like Daryl and not enough like Belle.  I don't really see any Ontario in her.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3039/5756999051_95806591b2.jpg"">
And Arva.  Not gonna lie, I'm leaning toward her.  She's just beautiful.  Plus, she's blonde, and there's still a lot of Ontario in her.  But we'll see what you guys have to say.

Let me know who you want for heir!  I tried to make a poll, but it didn't work, so you'll just have to let me know through comments.  Hope you liked, and sorry for the crappy update.  I promise I'll try to be better in the new hood.

Here are the pictures/stats of everyone (except Rockwood, because I forgot to take one of him.  Lol), in case it makes a difference when voting.  The LTWs don't really matter, since they'll be getting new ones in the new hood.

<lj-cut text=""The crazy is equal opportunity in this house!"">

Last time, Toronto died, Belle and Daryl had 4 kids--Selby, Rockwood, London and Grafton--and Cal and Mackenzie had 3 kids--Mitchell, Dorion and Arva.  And a lot of random shit happened.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3474/5711917689_0fbcb8c759.jpg"">
So, directly after giving birth to Arva, Mackenzie had a little meltdown.  Apparently her romance sim tendencies weren't completely buried under the mountain of familial responsibility.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2567/5712478920_eae1b7c9d5.jpg"">
A quick visit from the invisible shrink should do the trick.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2475/5712479028_52b338c38b.jpg"">
Man, she's pretty.  Even when she's batshit.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3606/5711918023_0c274778b5.jpg"">
<b>Caledon:</b> You ain't kidding.  Bitch is crazy.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3499/5712479272_0114da69ee.jpg"">
Apparently not crazy enough not to immediately take her to bed.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2686/5712479398_7eca3a646a.jpg"">
And I do mean immediately after.  Arva spent her first night of existence on the computer/exercise/game room floor.  Welcome to the family, Arva!  I'm sure there's much more to come.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3583/5711918369_0b82fae229.jpg"">
Well, at least someone cares enough to actually put her to bed.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3022/5711918519_7c3f65e3f2.jpg"">
<b>Grafton:</b> Haha, I love it when you hit me so hard, my eye almost pops out!

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3574/5711918647_6b9fe83d03.jpg"">
Birthdays for Arva and Mitchell!

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2082/5711918795_2912de3e1c.jpg"">
<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2122/5712480022_2086f30443.jpg"">
But we interrupt the celebration to allow Mackenzie to go crazy.  Twice in a row!  For both her aspirations!  Now that's impressive.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3296/5711919019_4835aa952a.jpg"">
Teen!Mitchell!  Liiiiitle bit ape-looking, but kind of cute, all the same.  Meh.  I'm not super thrilled.  He rolled Family with a sub-aspiration of Popularity and a LTW to become Mayor.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3225/5711919089_8e6401c11d.jpg"">
And toddler!Arva!  Cuuuuuuuuuuuute!  Someone's in the running for heir!

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3334/5712480332_00ef6b747d.jpg"">
It's weird--two of the hobbies guys lost their hair not long after this.  Literally.  They weren't even bald.  everywhere the hair covered was completely gone.  It was like it was there, but just invisible.  I'm sure that's not a good sign.  Though it was only the hobbies guys, not any of the hobbies women.  Weird.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2158/5712480440_860a1b5419.jpg"">
I swear, she's actually cuter than this.  Still strange looking, but cuter than this.  But I do hate her teeth.  They're a little bit beaver-y for me.  And hey!  A not-burned muffin!  Points for that.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2651/5711919415_3af4b8fd55.jpg"">
Last babies of the generation!  Yep, babies.  The last two needed for Daryl's LTW.  And no, I didn't cheat.  lol.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2215/5712480652_21e457f96b.jpg"">
A girl, Wawa, who looks distressingly similar to Selby.  She's not a complete clone, but just about.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2500/5711919653_b366ba584b.jpg"">
And a boy, Osgoode.  

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3243/5712480894_682591f0bb.jpg"">
So cute.  He's definitely in the running still too.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2750/5711919849_7b2d1267a8.jpg"">
Aww, and he loves his daddy too.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3129/5712481080_e8dfe61b8a.jpg"">
Um, alright, you can strip down and dance in a stranger's house.  No biggie.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3576/5711919981_60fb9a9dc9.jpg"">
Time for the triplets' birthdays!

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3120/5712481296_242f03cc94.jpg"">
Bwahaha.  Nice outfit, Rock. 

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3144/5712481412_09940d91f6.jpg"">
Teen!Rockwood!  Yeah.....definitely not in the running for heir.  I don't want that nose/mouth combination in the next generation.  He's Knowledge/Romance with a LTW to become a criminal mastermind.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3075/5711920373_e5594e0c68.jpg"">
Teen!London!  Preeeeeeeetty.  And no more beaver teeth!  She's Popularity/Romance with a LTW to become a visionary.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2285/5712481662_a561a0aa23.jpg"">
And last, but definitely not least, teen!Selby!  She's so gorgeous, and definitely in the running for heir, though her LTW of 20 lovers may count against her.  We'll see what we can do.  She's Romance/Knowledge, btw.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2084/5711920601_5f97415cd5.jpg"">
Let the noogies begin!  Rockwood is terrible for it.  It's like he knows that he's never going to be heir, so he tortures those in the running.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3041/5711920727_44b123d8a7.jpg"">
Uh, yeah...I don't think that's the way it works, London. 

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2178/5712482056_17838a00a0.jpg"">
Trying to get into my good graces for heir--Ur doin' it right!

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2375/5712482190_6b09f57721.jpg"">
Aww, no one loves Arva.  She's adorable, though, even with her teeth hanging out like that.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2351/5711921075_8086a9163a.jpg"">
Mitchell's been wanting his first kiss, and this girl's pretty, so I decided to let him flirt with her.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3646/5712482384_9ca734181b.jpg"">
Sigh...Kind of difficult when he's being a bitch.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3370/5711921333_9e4cc2aeb0.jpg"">
O rly?  I can work with that!  You two would be cute together!

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2629/5712482640_3fc5fe787b.jpg"">
...Or not.  Wow, I'm 0/2.  Clearly I suck at romance in game as much as I do in real life.  Lmao.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3618/5712482760_df5ce774bf.jpg"">
Whatever.  That guy doesn't know what he's missing.  She's gorgeous.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3655/5712482842_4a074f7d41.jpg"">
And so is Selby.  I don't think it'll take much for her to get her 20 lovers, even considering how much I suck at the romance thing.  Haha. 

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3327/5711921745_ec5a4b0b40.jpg"">
Uh...not sure why the exterminator is paying respects to Toronto and Kari, but...  *shrugs*  It's sweet, anyway.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3045/5712483062_ccb6edaf8f.jpg"">
Selby's first attempt at romance comes via the matchmaker, but it doesn't go well.  Meh.  He's hideous anyway.  You can do much better than that, S.  I can't wait until I can move these guys into another neighbourhood again, now that I've successfully put in clean templates.  After college, I'm definitely doing it.

Osgoode's a relatively cute toddler, though his nose takes up half his face.  Hopefully he'll grow into it a little bit more.  I love this kind of nose (obviously, since my last two founders had them), but I'm starting to get a little bit tired of it.  But I don't want to breed it out completely.  I think I'll start to miss it when it's gone.

And here's Wawa.  She's adorable, but yeah, she's very similar to Selby.  They're not identical, but they're extremely close, in looks and personality.  :(

Look, it's the almost clones!  Selby's a great big sister.

And a great cousin too!  Time for Arva to grow up!

Cuuuuuuuuuuuute.  I love the big eyes, and the nose works for her.  She's still in the running to be <s>America's Next Top Model</s> heir.

Selby gets ready for her date!  Man, she's gorgeous.

I think it's going well.

Hey, Daryl.  Why the face?

London still sucks at romance.  I'm starting to think that maybe it isn't me.  Maybe it's her.  She does only have 1 nice point, after all.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2266/5711923203_8528ecec85.jpg"">
Selby has more luck with her boy of the day.  He doesn't seem to mind having her hands on his ass.

She won him over in the end.

Ooh, hot headmaster!  Unfortunately, that visit sucked.  The tour went alright, but everyone sucked at schmoozing, and then he wouldn't come to dinner.  Needless to say, they didn't get in.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3257/5712484864_ac351a65d3.jpg"">
Meh, it's alright that they didn't get in.  Now the twins will be able to go to private school too when they do get in.  Birthday time!

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3471/5711923765_efebfb839e.jpg"">
Osgoode's a pretty cute kid!  His nose is still ginormous though.  Hopefully he'll grow into it.  I've played that far, but I can't remember.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2294/5711923913_c17cc303d1.jpg"">
She looks like she's got a slight lazy eye in this picture, but she's super cute!  Still almost a clone of Selby though.

And then the game crashed, and for some reason, I forgot to take pictures of Grafton and Dorion after their make overs.  And I don't have a close up of Grafton at all through his teen years for some reason, but here's one of Dorion!  He's so hot.  Definitely in the running for heir.  Btw, He's Romance/Fortune with a LTW to become an icon, and Grafton is Pleasure/Romance with a LTW to become a celebrity chef.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2138/5711924103_f1f9b98464.jpg"">
And here's another picture of him.  So cute.  I love him so much.

We invite the headmaster over again, and this time, Mackenzie pulls out all the stops.

I think it's working.  XD

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3170/5711924557_8a5490d304.jpg"">
Um...ok.  But they got in anyway.  Which I only found out after trying to call the headmaster for another visit and finding out I was unable to.  Then I checked memories and found out they got in.  Yay glitches!

Wawa maxes cooking skill!  After a couple of days being a kid.  She is awesome.  That is all.

Selby's been with more than a few guys already.  I'm just not showing all of them, because it's boring.  She might get her 20 lovers after all!

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2251/5711925109_c9ef99b3d4.jpg"">
Time for Mitchell to go to college!

London and Rockwood too.  Selby gets to stay for now, so that she can seduce more mens.

Ooh!  I do have a picture of Grafton as a teen!  See?  He's cute!

Selby spent ages working in the garden and won the wishing well on her first try with the garden club!  And now to reap the real fruits of her labour!

Facemash!

And then she immediately sends him home and then gets to work on this guy that someone brought home from school.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2222/5711925921_c3a838faba.jpg"">
And now she's a teen!  And a gorgeous one at that.  She rolled Knowledge/Popularity with a LTW to max out all 7 skills.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3489/5712487096_e387278abb.jpg"">
Just because she's adorable.

Ooh, I can work with that.  Apartment chic is decent-looking.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3412/5712487264_8b617e3682.jpg"">
Or...not.  My poor teenies.  The only one with any luck so far has been Selby.

Arva and Dorion are so beautiful, and they're both still in the running for heir.  The choice is gonna be so tough, guys.  I think I'm going to need help.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3230/5711926351_9d6f8ab0bc.jpg"">
Belleville is still gorgeous.  And that is definitely a very flattering uniform on her.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3553/5711927075_812da2ac01.jpg"">
Rawr.  He may be a bit boring, but damn, he's hot.  I'm going to miss his hotness when he gets old.  Also, I have no idea who's just lost their crush on the other side of the room.  I didn't take a picture of it, so it must not be important.  haha.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2703/5711927205_92eb9a35fa.jpg"">
Not the smartest sim in the house though.  So close, man.  If you hadn't spent two minutes complaining about having to go to the bathroom, you might've made it to the toilet.  *sigh*

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3163/5711927333_31ce3fe6cd.jpg"">
Ew, no. 

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3024/5711927413_340f7ca44a.jpg"">
Ooh, she likes him!  This is promising.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3103/5712488624_ddab0e0b78.jpg"">
And then she immediately went to Dorion afterwards and started flirting it up with him.  That bitch!  You're not hot enough to play both guys like that.  

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2367/5711927623_ce03c28361.jpg"">
Selby's got a lot more luck with her conquests.  Then again, she's got help from the rose and the wishing well.  Plus, she's ridiculously hot.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3124/5711927761_774464639e.jpg"">
The twins finally become teens!  Osgoode is....out of the running for heir.  He's weird-looking.  He's right up there with Rockwood.   He rolled Fortune/Romance with a LTW to earn $100 000.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2646/5711927895_868752cfab.jpg"">
And Wawa.  She's absolutely gorgeous, but she looks too much like Selby, I think.  Not exactly alike, but they're close enough that Wawa will probably be out of the running.  We'll see how she turns out when she gets to college.  She rolled Family/Pleasure, with a LTW for 50 dream dates, which is another strike against her.  That's a freaking hard LTW.

<hr>

And that's it for now.  I was hoping to be able to finish with Osgoode and Wawa's teen years this update because I'm getting really tired of this generation, and I just want it to be over, but there are just too many pictures.  And I haven't finished playing them out yet.  One more should do it.  I can't wait for next generation.  There's no way there'll be that many kids next gen.  Also, since I finally successfully put clean neighbourhood templates in again, I'm going to have to start a new hood for them again once they're through college.  Frustrating, but oh well.  Hopefully this will be the last time.  Anyway, I hope you liked it!  Next up, Osgoode/Arva/Wawa's teen years and then college!

<lj-cut text=""Just follow the crazy."">

Last time on the Ontarios, Caledon and Mackenzie, and Belleville and Daryl got married.  Mackenzie gave birth to a son, Mitchell, and right before he became a toddler, Kari died.  Belleville had triplets, two girls, London and Selby, and a boy, Rockwood, who also became toddlers.  It was hell, and their dumbass butler just made things worse.  Lastly, Mackenzie realized she was pregnant again.  What'll happen next?  Read on!


<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5302/5611790585_3aec5088a4.jpg"">
Seriously, this is all they do.  Sex, sex, sex, all the time.  And when they're not jumping into the sack together, they're flirting up a storm.  If they weren't so cute together, it'd be nauseating.

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5061/5611790721_c33716393a.jpg"">
Meanwhile, Toronto tries to teach Selby how to use the potty.  She isn't having any of it.  Poor Toronto.  Seems he's forgotten how to take care of toddlers in his old age.

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5187/5612372820_21f4f243d0.jpg"">
Double pop!  Apparently they're both pregnant.  You know what this means!  Synchronized births!  Yay!

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5102/5611790975_a7aae98509.jpg"">
Hi Kari!  Aww, we miss you!

Toronto died, and I missed it.  D8  RIP Toronto.  You were a great founder.

And it sends Cal to rock bottom.  Poor Caledon.  He didn't just lose his father.  He lost his bff.  

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5066/5612373422_b97d5175ca.jpg"">
He's still gorgeous, even when he thinks he's a monkey.

So compassionate, that Mackenzie.  So attentive to her husband's needs.

<b>Caledon:</b>Ugh!  What is that nasty smell?
Poor Cal.  His luck just continues, though this one was my fault.  He needed to learn....something for his next promotion, but I forgot to check to make sure he was gold aspiration.  He wasn't.  I'm sorry bb!

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5068/5612373808_ba0892380b.jpg"">
Mitchell had a birthday!  Still a bit weird-looking, I think, but he's not too bad.  We'll see how things go as he gets older.

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5025/5611791891_8470d856ff.jpg"">
<b>Cal:</b>You'll be my friend, won't you, Mr.Cup?
Yep, still crazy.

<b>Cal:</b> Okay, okay, I've had my little meltdown.  And now I'm better.  Really.
Suuuuuuuuuure you are, Cal.  Sure you are. 

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5106/5612374264_f47f7917c6.jpg"">
Synchronized birth!  Of course they're in different rooms, which kind of takes away from it, but still.  And, I'm lame and forgot to take pictures of the babies, but they each had a boy, Grafton for Belle and Dorion for Mackenzie.

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5066/5611792363_d8aa82379c.jpg"">
I was scrolling through the house and heard fireworks coming from Cal and Mackenzie's bed, but Mackenzie was at work, so I decided to take a look to see who was doing the nasty...

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5103/5612374616_23e8640de5.jpg"">
<font size=""5""><b>CALEDON!!</b></font>
Yeah, immediately after that, I took her whole family and put them in a lot and then killed them all off.  I did it with the Ottomas's too.  I'm tired of seeing them in my hood, blocking the way of better-looking sims.  If Cal's going to mess around with another woman, she at least needs to be hotter than Priya whatsherface.  >:(

Time for the triplets birthdays!  Thank God.  Three toddlers at a time is ridiculous.

Here's Rockwood.  Eh, there's something about him that I just don't like.  I don't know, maybe his features are too sharp or something.

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5147/5611793023_38960319f0.jpg"">
London.  She's pretty cute.  She's unique looking, I think.

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5109/5611793157_b89c45f359.jpg"">
And my favourite so far, Selby!  So cute!  Though she doesn't seem to have a lot of Belle in her.  She looks so much like Daryl.  Which is definitely not a bad thing.

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5266/5611793285_3f52f32a63.jpg"">
London and Rockwood are friends!  Even now, with four kids and four adults in the room, it's very difficult to keep up with relationships.  And even though the official guide (which I just bought for $5 at a second-hand store) says that LTR increases over time to match STR, I don't really believe it.  Their long-term relationship never seems to go up that much.  Even now that the kids are ready for college, in-game.  It's frustrating.

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5029/5612375400_75ca78e439.jpg"">
This happens a lot.  Michell seems to forget that he's only got 1 nice point and tries to hug the kids he brings home from school, and they're always like, ""FU, man, I barely know you!""  Poor, confused Mitchell.

<img src=""http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5065/5611793509_076b8e8300.jpg"">
Birthdays for Dorion and Grafton!  Clearly nothing important happened with them while they were babies.

Grafton is adorable!  He looks so sweet.

I love this table.  If it wasn't for this thing, none of the kids would be friends at all.  They'd all have 0 relationships.

I didn't want to get this for them, but the bubble blower is really the only thing that raises the kids' fun fast enough for them to be able to do their homework before they pass out at like, 8pm.

Further proof that the butler fails.  Not only does he suck with babies and toddlers, but he can't fix sinks either, apparently.  At least not without screaming and beating at it first.  I swear, if he didn't constantly make food for the family, he'd be gone.

*Insert lewd comment about boners here*  No wonder Belle married you.

Not only is he virile enough to probably satisfy every woman in Canada, he also has the ability to levitate babies.  That is one powerful penis.

Rockwood has been hiding his homework, so his grades are crap.  I even got a warning from the social worker about him.  I promptly cheated him back to a C so that all six kids wouldn't be taken away.  Also, I don't know who does it or why, but that garbage can is always knocked over, and they constantly have roaches.  I don't know who keeps knocking it over.  They're still new to the hood, so they haven't pissed anyone off.  But the exterminator could retire off of the money that the family gives her.

Hopefully this'll be the last time she needs to get pregnant.  I love it when my sims have kids because I love to watch genetics at work, but this is ridiculous.  Too many people in this house.  Plus, how am I ever going to be able to choose heir?

At least these two have a relationship.  And then Selby and Mitchell have somewhat of a relationship too, though the two groups don't really mingle all that much.  And Dorion and Grafton are already best friends, thanks to the table.

Daryl is such a good daddy.  And I love the peek-a-boo action.  Grafton is so adorable when they play.

And Belle loves playing games with the kids.  She takes no prisoners! 
<b>Belle:</b> Hey, kids've got to learn sometime that sometimes they're going to lose.
Harsh, but fair, I think.

<b>Rockwood:</b> OMG, dad.  Mila Kunis just walked into the house and is totally checking you out!
<b>Daryl:</b> Seriously?  Me?
<b>Rockwood:</b> Yeah yeah, quick, look, before she leaves again.

I love mean sims.  It's too bad Rockwood isn't cuter.  He could be a fun heir.  But alas, he just can't compare with his better-looking siblings and cousins.

Child!Grafton!  He's cute, but damn, he's got a massive nose.  I'm not sure if I like it with that skin tone.

And Child!Dorion!  Still effing adorable, even with the Victorian dressing gown.  Plus, he's got the Ontario nose AND elf ears.  Definite plus in the heir race!

"event","A new year, a new list!  I made it just under the wire last year, but this year, I'm going to try my hardest to get my 100 in before December 30th. lol.  Also, this year, I plan on writing short reviews on each one.  Let's see if I can keep this up.  lmao.

<lj-cut text=""The movies!"">
1.  January 1st - Hamlet (2009)
Let's see....Patrick Stewart as Claudius and the king's ghost and David Tennant as Hamlet?  Um, yes.  Hamlet is already one of my favourite of Shakespeare's plays, but with these two as the leads?  I was very impressed.  David did a great job as Hamlet.  There were only a few brief moments when I was like, ""Doctor!""  Haha.  It was really good.  About three hours long, but good.

2.  January 6th - 12 Men of Christmas (2009)
I know, it's a little bit late for Christmas, but Kristin Chenoweth was the star, so I had to download.  I love her.  It was a Lifetime movie, so it ended up being your typical Harlequin romance type of story, and not a very good one, at that.  Plot holes aplenty.  But it was Kristin!  So I can't say it was completely horrible.  She has to bring in a couple of bonus points, though those points are pretty much the only ones it gets.  I definitely don't recommend this one.

3. January 17th - Vicky Cristina Barcelona
Meh.  I'm not a Woody Allen fan at all, but I decided to give this a shot because someone thought I would like it.  And insisted that it was unlike any other Woody Allen movie out there.  It was...okay.  It did give me a new appreciation for Scarlett Johansson and Penelope Cruz, but I actually thought the movie was a little bit boring.  There were moments when I thought it was alright, but for the most part, I was a little bit bored.  I ended up playing Facebook games while I watched.  So um...sorry, Dominik.  It just wasn't for me.

4. January 29th - Small Town Gay Bar
I really liked this.  It was a documentary from Malcolm Ingram about gay bars in small mid-western towns.  It was sad and funny and frustrating, seeing the kind of things people have had to go through just because they're gay.  Makes me so glad I live in Ontario.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone.

5. January 30th - (500) Days of Summer
This was a pretty good movie.  It wasn't my absolute favourite, but I like the way it was laid out.  The fact that the scenes weren't in chronological order was great.  I think that if it had been, the movie wouldn't have turned out as well.  I found Joseph endearing and Zooey maddening, but cute at the same time.  Overall, I liked it.  I don't know if I'd watch it again, but it was good.

6. February 23rd - Dark City
It was okay.  Sort of Matrix-y, with a hint of Neverending Story, kind of.  I did love Richard O'Brien as Mr.Hand.  He was creepy and awesome.  And Jennifer Connelly was beautiful as always.  The effects were pretty good too, but the story itself was just okay, I thought.  A little bit confusing.  I don't know.  Maybe I'd have to watch it again to get everything.

7. February 28th - Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief
Loved it.  It's quite Harry Potter-esque in some aspects, which, of course, I love.  I loved all the mythology.  It made the movie somewhat educational (ok, maybe only a little bit educational, but still) and entertaining at the same time.  Now I want to read the books.  They're on my list.

8. March 3rd - The Princess and the Frog
I really liked it.  I liked that it was a little bit more modern than most Disney movies.  I just liked the setting in general.  The music was good, and I loved the voodoo stuff.  I can see why it was nominated for an Oscar.  It was just really enjoyable.

9. March 10th - Cocoon
It was alright.  I can't believe I'd never seen it before, considering how old the movie is, but yeah, somehow I'd just never seen it until now.  I think, for some reason, I'd thought it was a horror movie, like a body-snatchers kind of movie.  Haha.  But now I've watched it, and it was okay.  A little slow, but cute.  And seeing Barret Oliver really made me want to watch Neverending Story again.  And Seeing Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy made me want to watch Batteries Not Included again, both of which I own, so maybe I will do that this weekend.

10. March 10th - Astro Boy
I really liked this movie.  I used to watch the cartoon when I was a kid, and I loved it, but I hadn't seen it in years.  But after watching the movie, little bits and pieces of the original have started to come back to me.  I think it's a shame that the movie didn't do better.  I never even knew it was out at all.  Did it even go to theatres?  No clue.  But I thought it was cute.  I could've done without Nicholas Cage, but overall, it was a good movie.

11. March 11 - Possession
This movie was okay.  Honestly, the only reason I watched the movie at all is because Sarah Michelle Gellar is in it.  I found at least half the movie to be slow and pretty boring.  It wasn't until the end that it started getting good.  The flashbacks shown also seemed out of place and abrupt, which didn't appeal to me.  In that respect, it felt like they were trying too hard to make it cool and interesting, but the plot itself was just bland, most of the way through.  And then there were things here and there that didn't make sense at all, clearly only put in to try to raise suspense.  Overall, kind of a lame movie.

12. March 12 - The Blind Side
This was a pretty good movie.  I don't think I cried at all, but I think I came close.  It was touching, and Sandra Bullock did do a really good job, though I'm not sure it was good enough for a Best Actress Oscar.  It was pretty good though.  I enjoyed it.

13. March 17 - The Cutting Edge: Fire & Ice
The only reason I downloaded this movie was because Brendan Fehr is in it, and I love him.  Well, and because I liked the first movie.  I didn't even know that there was a second movie, let alone a fourth!  Now I might have to download the second and third in the series, just because....well, I don't really know why.  Just because I loved the first one, I guess.  This one was just as predictable as the first one, but I liked it just because it was a simple romantic comedy, and sometimes that's just what I'm in the mood for.

14. March 18 - The Secret of Kells
It was alright.  It was nominated for an Oscar, and it was okay, but it didn't blow my mind.  The animation was kind of cool, and different from what I thought it would be, and the story was interesting, but I don't know, it just wasn't as good as I'd thought it would be.

15. March 26 - Alice in Wonderland
The movie was definitely colourful.  I thought it was good, but I'd expected more out of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp.  I've pretty much loved every movie that they've made together, but this one didn't quite hit the bar for me.  It was close, but not quite.  My friend claimed that there wasn't a story, and I disagree with that, but the story that was there wasn't strong enough, in my opinion.  What bothered me was that it's clear that she's an odd girl, different from everyone else in her life and everyone else knows it too, but then all through Wonderland, she fights against that differentness in her, and I think it makes her a little bit bland and boring.  I think that if Burton had written the script himself, it would've turned out better.

16. March 27 - Nick and Nora's Infinite Playlist
I really liked this movie.  I love movies that are basically just about one day or night in a person's life, and how that night changes them.  Similar movies?  Dazed and Confused, Mallrats, Empire Records and Can't Hardly Wait.  I just love all the crazy things that happen and the situations the characters get themselves into.  Plus, I'm a romantic, so I loved seeing the two main characters getting closer to each other throughout the night.

17. March 27 - Foxfire
Pretty good movie.  I like Angelina in this kind of movie, especially from this era.  This character is a lot like her character in Hackers, and I loved that movie too.  I just like her as the indpendent, tough chick.  And I realize that most of her characters are like this anyway, but back then, it just seemed so much more authentic.  Plus, it's just cool to see something so female-oriented.  It was a decent movie.

18. March 27 - Boy I Am
So good!  It's a documentary about Female to Male transgendered people, and I loved it.  Obviously this kind of movie holds a special place in my heart--I love to watch just about anything having to do with the LGBT commmunity--but even besides, that, it was still a really great film.  It was informative, and it really gave insight into what these people were feeling.  I loved it.

19. April 5 - Ink
Not such a good movie.  It was hailed as a great movie along the lines of the Matrix and Donnie Darko and Dark City, but it really wasn't that great.  I just found it confusing and kind of boring.  I definitely won't be watching it again.

20. April 11 - The Living End
Alright, when I said that I pretty much like anything LGBT-related, that doesn't really extend to this movie.  It's about a gay hustler and a gay journalist who are both HIV positive and go on a bender together.  I thought it sounded interesting, but it's not.  It's a little bit too indie, even for me.  The writing was bad, the acting was awful, and while the journalist seemed like a decent person, I didn't really see any redeeming qualities in the hustler at all.  Just...not a good movie.

21. April 15 - Big Gay Musical
Loved it.  The singing was amazing, and the story was sweet, if a little disjointed.  The one thing that bothered me was the--<b>spoiler alert!</b>--one character's reaction to finding out he was positive.  He's upset when he finds out, but the next day, he's perfectly okay again.  That was the only thing that really bugged me.  The music is awesome though, the singing, really great.  It makes me really want to see the show that they characters put on.  If it doesn't exist, it needs to.  They've already got most of the songs for it.  It needs to happen.

22. April 17 - Kick As$
This was really good.  Better than I thought it would be, though more violent too, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  Just surprising.  Hit Girl was awesome.  I still love McLovin.  It was highly entertaining all the way through.  Great heroes, great villians.  I cna't wait for the next one.  Also, now I want to read the comics.

23. April 17 - The Bounty Hunter
Um, no.  This was a horrible movie.  Jennifer Anniston and Gerard Butler do have chemistry together (which makes sense, since they're together in real life), but the story itself just sucked.  With most romantic comedies, especially when the two main characters are former lovers of some kind, something in the plot usually makes the realize that they were stupid for breaking up in the first place, and that now they can't live without each other again.  First of all, I can't even remember what it was that broke them up to begin with, and the thing that brings them back together?  Lame.  With the storyline this couple is given, I would expect them to hook up again, but that's about it.  It's definitely not enough to bring them back together for good.  If I was Jennifer's character in that situation, some hot, steamy sex might be something I'd want to experience with the guy, but there's no way I'd be deluded into thinking that we could actually make it work as a couple this time around.  So, that's why this movie sucks.  Jen and Garard's chemistry is not even close to being enough to carry the weak storyline.  FAIL.

24. April 18 - Clash of the Titans
First of all, let me just specify that this is the 80's version of the movie.  Wow, talk about B-rated.  I found it a little bit boring, mostly because I didn't think that Harry Hamlin seemed all that heroic.  He seemed bewildered throughout the whole movie.  But I can see why it's a cult classic.  I'm sure that back then, the stop motion scorpions and Medusa were pretty cool-looking.  Medusa, especially, reminded me of the Nome King from Return to Oz, and I love that movie, so it was kind of cool to watch.  And I loved seeing Maggie Smith as Thetis.  I love just about everything I've seen her in.  She is awesome, and so pretty!  Even now, she still looks really good for her age.  Also, I don't care what anyone says--I loved that mechanical owl.  It was so cute!  And I'm sad that it only gets a fifteen second cameo in the new one.  Stupid Sam Worthington, wanting to cut him out completely.  Overall though, the movie was alright, but I wasn't as blown away as I thought I would be.  I am eager to see the new one now though.  

25. April 23 -  Signs
I can't believe I've never seen this movie until now.  I've heard mixed reviews about it--some people love it, some people hate it--but I liked it.  It was a little bit slow at times, but that's just the way that most of M.Night Shyamalamadingdong's movies work.  It's usually a slow build up, and then a twist at the end that makes you go, 'wtf?!'  But I liked it.  I loved seeing little Abigail Breslin.  She's so cute, and such a good actor.  And Joaquin was cool.  Too bad he's crazy now.  Mel Gibson was even pretty good too, and I'm not usually a huge fan of his.  I don't know if I'll watch it again, but it was a good once-through for me.  

26. April 28 - Say Anything
Once again, I can't believe I'd never seen this movie until now.  How old is it?  Pretty freaking old.  Eh, it was alright, but I definitely wouldn't say it was anything great.  Definitely not as good as people make it out to be.  Everyone always talks about the scene with John Cusack and the boom box outside her window and how romantic it is, but I didn't think it was all that great.  I mean, okay, if some guy did that for me to try to win me back, I would be impressed, but after hearing about it for so long, hearing how romantic a gesture it was, I guess I was just a little bit disappointed by it.  And then the end of the movie wasn't great either.  I just felt like the plot unraveled a little bit by the end.  It seemed a little bit disjointed.  It wasn't really for me.

27. April 29 - The Lake House
This movie was alright.  It was sweet, and kind of exciting toward the end, when you don't know if he's going to make it or not.  And I love Sandra, so that's a plus too.  She and Keanu work well together.  They've got chemistry.  So yeah, it was kind of sweet and somewhat enjoyable.  I wouldn't say it was my favourite movie ever, but I might watch it again sometime down the line.

28. May 1 - I love You Phillip Morris
I got a crappy R5 version of this movie, so that kind of sucked, but the movie itself was awesome.  It was so off the wall and quirky.  Jim Carrey was so weird and flawed in the funniest way, and Ewan McGreggor was adorable.  I love his smile.  I really hope a better version of this will come out eventually so that I can watch it again.  It was definitely one of my favourites of the year so far.

29. May 9 - Iron Man 2
This wasn't as good as the first movie, and the fight scene at the end was kind of short and lame, but the movie itself was alright, if a little forgetable.  Mickey Rourke was good, in a dirty, creepy way, and Robert Downey Jr. was awesome as ever.  I love him.  And I'm not usually a fan of Scarlet Johansson, but this movie made me like her more.  She kicked some major ass and looked hot while doing it.  Overall, it was alright.

30. May 12 - The Time Traveler's Wife
This was good, but sad.  You knew there was just not going to be a real good ending to it.  But it was beautifully done. Eric Bana and Rachael McAdams were both good.  They've got really good chemistry together.  Maybe not as good as she and Ryan Gosling have together, but still, they work well together.  

31. May 16 - Across the Universe
Loved it.  The music was awesome.  The second half of the movie sort of fell apart a little bit though.  The music was solid all the way through, but the storyline itself wasn't as good past the halfway mark.  It felt like they'd tried to mold the second half of the movie around the songs, so it wasn't as cohesive.  The first half was solid, but the second half felt patchy to me.  Jim Sturgess was hot though, and Evan Rachel Wood was beautiful.  Their voices were perfect.

<lj-cut text=""The pressure!  It's...!  It's...! *head explodes*"">

Back again!  Sorry it's been so long since my last post.  It took me forever to get through uni, because it's boring as hell, but I'm finally done.  I don't know if I'm going to be able to do it every generation, but I'll try.  Anyway, YA Ontarios!

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4087/5006936090_91b49b466b.jpg"">
YA Ajax!  Love him.  So hot.  Actually, he turned out hotter than I thought he would be.  He makes me want to rethink my choices for who's in the running for heir.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4092/5006324101_44d8d88630.jpg"">
YA Ottawa!  She's alright.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4104/5006324413_fda30770b8.jpg"">
YA Caledon!  Kind of weird-looking, but hot at the same time.  He's got really strong features, which I kind of like.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4104/5006324623_b92aeac7e0.jpg"">
YA Elmira!  So pretty.  She has the softest features out of all the kids.  

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4091/5006324853_361e13bb97.jpg"">
YA Belleville!  Omg, absolutely gorgeous.  There are no other words for her.  Just gorgeous.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4104/5006325075_213d95d7d2.jpg"">
Aaaaaaand Daryl, Belleville's boyfriend, also gets to go to college, because he's pretty hot.  If she becomes heir, he's gonna be the baby daddy.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4083/5006937328_b5787ff063.jpg"">
And the very first thing that Belle and Daryl do, even before their makeovers?  Why, they jump into the sack of course!  Obviously, they were just waiting to get to uni to finally get down and dirty.  As soon as there are no parents around, into bed they hop!

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4089/5006937550_f6db71ea9c.jpg"">
I hate the big grin on all the streakers.  Like their teeth are just floating in the black hole of their mouths.  It looks horrible.  And some of them could be relatively good-looking if it wasn't for their weird mouths.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4113/5006937868_7399ff57a5.jpg"">
Oh...that can't be good.  He's got at least a bolt or two with both Elmira and Ottawa, as well as with Belleville.  Thank God, he's not a romance sim.  He's knowledge.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4148/5006326129_10bdbef006.jpg"">
<b>Belleville:</b> What's that you say?  Justin Bieber's behind me?!  OMG!
The dormies know what the cow is up to, even if poor Belleville doesn't.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4124/5006326321_02d57e79c1.jpg"">
They're over it now.  Meanwhile, that must've been one really powerful water balloon, to smash her through the wall like that.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4103/5006938536_d6b096577a.jpg"">
She gets her back though.  It took her a few tries to actually get the cow to do it, but no one ever gets the last laugh on Belleville.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4113/5006326785_ec6cfa0637.jpg"">
Lots of stuff going on here.  Ottawa resists the cow's advancements, and Caledon's....on drugs.  And I haven't even bought them a bubble blower yet.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4107/5006327161_0c1dcd4bff.jpg"">
Just about everyone in this dorm goes around in their underwear.  And most of the guys have teeny, tiny briefs on. 

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4144/5006939382_c6d9c1304e.jpg"">
This is a custom dorm that they live in, and for some reason, the cafeteria cook never showed up, and I didn't know of any way to summon him or her, so rather than force my guys to spend precious time cooking for everyone in the dorm, they just got a banquet table instead.  Little pricier, maybe, but much easier.  I didn't feel like moving them to a new dorm, but future generations won't be coming back here again.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4090/5006327687_c43b19b3a5.jpg"">
Ugh...definitely not good.  Ottawa wants him too.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4147/5006327975_589e5546fc.jpg"">
O rly?  I figured since Daryl wanted Ottawa and Ottawa wanted Daryl, maybe I could get someone better for Belleville.  Too bad Stuart's ugly.  Sorry, Belle.  You're sticking with Daryl.  You'll just have to hope that he won't cheat on you with your sister.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4107/5006940064_26d903898e.jpg"">
Sigh.  Thankfully, as far as I know, this was the only time this happened.  As far as I know.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4151/5006940274_7b11044841.jpg"">
Thankfully, there's much more of this going on.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4112/5006940534_1366861035.jpg"">
Hmm, and here I've been trying to set him up with girls.  Should've known you were too pretty to be straight.  :X

Unfortunately, green guy doesn't want him back.  Poor Ajax.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4106/5006329371_60e8879b6e.jpg"">
Fortunately, Darren does seem to like Ajax's advances.  He's not quite as good-looking as green guy, but he'll do for now.  If Ajax is happy, then so am I.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4154/5006941516_85d5840427.jpg"">
Obligatory term paper shots.  Elmira and Belleville seem to be having a little trouble with theirs, but Cal's so confident in what he's writing that he probably thinks he could teach the class.  Must be his alien DNA.  He's just inherently intelligent.  Lucky bastard.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4145/5006329823_e89c9bd6b3.jpg"">
There's plenty of time for romance though, and Cal's found Mackenzie.  They hit it off immediately, and then ACR took over like crazy, just as it does with every couple.  They were inseparable whenever she was around.  She's beautiful though, so I approve.  It definitely helps his chances in the heir race.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4128/5006330059_85480aab09.jpg"">
Eee, first kiss!

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4153/5006942284_11ea18b513.jpg"">
Let the sexing begin!  Belle and Daryl are the first ones to christen the elevator, of course.  It seems like all they do is have sex.  Destry here, is a little concerned for them.  He doesn't want them plummeting to their deaths or anything.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4107/5006330563_8965799b30.jpg"">

The hot tub probably needs to be sanitized, it sees so much sex.  Their beds too.  The only one who doesn't spend half their time having sex is Elmira.  She's still pure.  As far as I know.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4084/5006331349_c42b4b69c7.jpg"">
Ottawa knows she's just rocked Destry's world.  She's got skillz.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4128/5006943368_5db55e4701.jpg"">
I'm actually surprised that Ottawa's the one wearing clothes and Elmira's the one in her undies, since Ottawa and Destry are ALWAYS having sex, and Elmira's never had it.  Although...if she's never had sex....why is she in her undies!  I usually make her sleep in her pjs.  Totally going to check her memories the next time I play.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4084/5006331799_394c280f86.jpg"">
*shudder*  I am scarred for life.  She is so creepy.  She's just here dropping off a lamp.  I still don't know what merits a lamp drop.  No one is super high in any hobby.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4150/5006943828_52e027fb69.jpg"">
But we're not going to turn it down!  Cal wanted to wish for something, so he wished for beauty.  It's kind of wasted on him since he's not a romance sim and he's got a pretty steady bed buddy, but meh.  They didn't need money that they wouldn't be able to keep, and I didn't want to go the easy way out and give him peace of mind, in case he is heir, so beauty, it was.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4109/5006944078_9c71e4cdfc.jpg"">
Elmira rolled the want to get a bronze hairdressing badge, so it's her job to make over the dormies.  Most of the time, she gets it right the first time, but once or twice, she makes a mistake.  She made Mackenzie bald on her first time around, and Stuart here, doesn't seem to appreciate his pretty, colourful face.  But he wouldn't let her re-do him immediately after.  It took a couple of days before she could get him in the chair again.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4087/5006944464_1ed881ae9e.jpg"">
And then I decided he wasn't pretty enough for any of my sims, so he gets a satellite to the face.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4149/5006944770_c74f27d556.jpg"">
Lots of mourners.  Everyone was crying at some point or another.  But no one tried to save him because he was ugly with tiny eyes.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4145/5006333189_2c42305eef.jpg"">
Stuart's replacement!  I can't remember his name, but he's kind of hot, so he can stay!

Ah, nothing like declaring your love for your girlfriend right next to the gravestone of your recently departed dormmate. You stay classy, Cal.

You bastard!  Can I go through one uni experience without someone getting pregnant?!  Also, how is it that Belleville and Daryl screw like bunnies, as do Ottawa and Destry, and they never get pregnant, yet just a couple romps in the sack for you gets you knocked up?!  Effing bastard.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4124/5006945694_31c96a4561.jpg"">
Yeah, you'd better worry!  You are so not heir.

TWO cow mascots?  Ohh, that can't be good.  One is annoying enough.  I think I hate the llama mascot and the cheerleader more than the cow though.  At least she never does the stupid cheer.  That thing kills me.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4112/5006334543_941dd0700b.jpg"">
Aww, Kari, you've made your daughter cry!  She just wanted to see what was happening back at home.  Is that such a crime?

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4089/5006946620_49bc3a3990.jpg"">
Okay, okay, I'm sorry I asked.  Jeez, anger management problems much?

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4154/5006946858_55a5aa7326.jpg"">
Ajax's pregnancy isn't going easy on him.  I'd feel sorry for him, but he's an idiot for getting himself knocked up in the first place.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4083/5006947258_49edf060f3.jpg"">
But thankfully, he doesn't have to go through it much longer.  Just one baby, a boy named Sunderland.  He's got both parents' hair, Darren's eyes and random skin.  Hopefully he'll look more like Ajax than Darren, cause Darren's a little weird-looking.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4149/5006947466_73ac3a0e3a.jpg"">
You guys had better not be going to try for more babies, or I will end both of you.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4132/5006335833_a4bbf46f96.jpg"">
WTF?!  Darren!  You slut!  Poor Ajax.  He'd better not find out!  

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4133/5006336359_008f913175.jpg"">
Sparkling baby!  Birthday time for Sunderland!

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4151/5006336647_71153efb99.jpg"">
Eh, he's okay.  He's got Darren's weird mouth, which I don't really like.  And his eyes look weird with his skintone.  Meh.  Oh well.  Ajax isn't heir anyway, so whatev.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4084/5006336885_fba8a6d894.jpg"">
Mackenzie's so pretty.  Sigh.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4128/5006948744_f7f4994b82.jpg"">
*Shakes head disgustedly*  YOUR SON AND YOUR BOYFRIEND ARE IN THE OTHER ROOM.  WTF. 
I have to say though, that green guy is pretty hot.  I've got to save him for any possible future gay heir.  Mmm.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4110/5006948948_15980e6890.jpg"">
Aww, Daryl's going to be such a good daddy.  He played with Sunderland autonomously.  So cute.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4092/5006949186_a3d341b8f0.jpg"">
Cal wanted to be BMOC, and he needed two more friends.  It took a few days to get there though.  Usually, when people hang out, they'll keep doing it until you tell them to stop.  Everything else is ignored, including food and sleep and bathroom breaks.  But everyone that Cal hung out with kept getting up and leaving after a few minutes.  And he couldn't get anywhere with this dormie. Andrea wanted nothing to do with him.  Poor Cal.  He's not used to being rejected.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4145/5006337703_2b9b38a40a.jpg"">
I love watching toddlers dancing.  It's so cute, and they always look so happy.  Even though he's weird-looking, he's still cute when he dances.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4085/5006949668_545393eb5d.jpg"">
Ajax didn't have a whole lot to do with his son (everyone helped toddler train him), but this was of his own free will.  Finally, just before Sunderland aged.  Darren never did anything with him either, I don't think.  Poor kid.  At least he had aunts and uncles around to play with him and give him attention.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4092/5006949876_f6054dc5e1.jpg"">
Kid!Sunderland!  Still weird-looking.  His mouth is weird, and I still think the skin tone/eye combination aren't good.  Oh well.  He won't be in the main house anyway, so I won't have to look at him.  Haha.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4085/5006338455_da20406c6a.jpg"">
In their junior year, I realized that though four out of five siblings were in relationships, none of them had proposed to the other, so Belleville got down on one knee and proposed to Daryl.  I was going to have her do it in some romantic way, but it was late, and uni was already taking so long, so I couldn't be bothered.  Daryl didn't seem to mind, thankfully.  He accepted, of course.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4132/5006338677_1e4eb61656.jpg"">
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaand then I got too bored of uni to continue on anymore.  They had one semester left to go, and it was super late on Friday night, and I just wanted to be done with it.  So I cheated them through that last semester, fixed their grades, set their exams for two hours, and then it was over.  And I'm so glad.  So anyway, Adult!Ajax!  Not heir.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4089/5006950580_cfb2491a75.jpg"">
Adult!Ottawa!  Also not heir.  Although she is beautiful.  Her features are just a little too harsh.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4089/5006339167_dc31873a05.jpg"">
Adult!Elmira!  Also not heir.  She's absolutely beautiful, but she's boring as hell.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4144/5006339531_f301d19c6d.jpg"">
Adult!Caledon!  Heir!  I hope, hope, hope his and Mackenzie's babies turn out pretty.  His features are so weird, I just don't know.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4106/5006339813_1c6c3d5d72.jpg"">
<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4087/5006340083_4d0cdcc10b.jpg"">
But it's okay if they don't, because Belleville is also heir!  I was going to make it a vote between them, but I just couldn't leave either of them behind.  Plus, Daryl is also hot.  So, double heirs!  I'm going to want to kill myself when the house is riddled with children, but for now, yay!  I can't wait to see how things play out! 

And that's it for this update!  Not sure what's going to happen next, because this is as far as I've played!  I hope you've enjoyed!

We'll start off with a WTF moment.  Caledon....in a bikini?!  The toddler nightgown I could maybe see, since I did download some old fashioned stuff, so I figured it must've been part of that set.  But I'm pretty sure I haven't downloaded any UNISEX BIKINIS!  After this, I actually sent him to the mirror to change his appearance to make absolutely sure that he was a boy.  Lol.  No lie.  I don't get it.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4100/4949669507_2634f4ba8d.jpg"">
Ajax thinks he's the shit.  He's the hottest gas station attendant you've ever seen!

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4132/4950262978_0c972f10e0.jpg"">
*shudder*  Even as a toddler, Belleville is scary when she's angry.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4142/4949669745_b4d65ec5c5.jpg"">
Elmira, on the other hand, couldn't be anything but cute even if she tried.  I sense a favourite in our midst!

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4151/4949669885_113616c9d4.jpg"">
Where's Ajax, Elmira?  Where's Ajax?

She is so freaking cute.  I can't get over it.

And now we'll bring it back to Caledon, who just aged into a teen!  Mmm, yummy.

I can definitely handle that LTW, and his turn ons are alright too.  So far, he's coming out ahead of his older siblings.

The twins are kids now!  Belleville still looks a bit odd to me.  A little bit mannish, just like Ottawa.  I don't know, hopefully she'll get better with age.  Everything about her just looks huge, and I can't decide yet whether or not it's pretty.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4091/4949670495_c27a85680f.jpg"">
Elmira is cuuuuuuuute!  I think I like her and Bellville's eyes better than the older kids'.  I think that has something to do wit it too.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4111/4949670627_e8c10afefc.jpg"">
Caledon is trying his hardest to get into the heir race, and it's working!  He's such a good older brother.  I love this interaction.  It's so cute.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4128/4949670749_87ae486a3e.jpg"">
Ottawa's getting her flirt on.  Finally.  It was around this point that I realized that no one was bringing friends home from work or school.  I had to have her greet him just so that she could finally meet someone.  Poor girl.  For awhile while I played, I tried to tell myself that I could handle them not bringing friends home.  I so didn't want to deal with trying to find the problem file.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4152/4950264286_5419208bc7.jpg"">
Cal gets his flirt on too. There are plenty of hot townies in this hood.  It's just that no one can bring them home with them.  So I decided to just bite the bullet and try to flush out the problem hack.  I'm guessing something must've glitched when I moved stuff from my old computer to the new one.  I got a few helpful suggestions from a few fellow simmers of what the problem hacks could be--which actually really helped, because one person mentioned ACR, and it turned out to be one of the problems.  I deleted and redownloaded and got rid of a few other problem files, and though it took me several hours of testing, now everything seems to work!  XD

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4142/4949670995_b20e33167d.jpg"">
So I saved the game at midnight and had to run it through the day until everyone started coming home from work/school to see if they'd bring anyone home.  I seriously must've played that day at least fifteen to twenty times.  It was like Groundhog Day, only Bill Murray was infinitely more entertaining.  On one pass through, this skunk seriously spent at least five or six sim hours just running back and forth across the lot.  And not just walking.  Running.  The thing was crazy.  But, alright, I guess it was almost as entertaining as Bill Murray.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4125/4950264600_dd310e1ee5.jpg"">
I also had to watch Moncton age into an adult over and over again.  Definitely not as entertaining as Bill Murray.  Finally, after several hours, it was done.  I can't remember if I've seen anyone bring friends home from work, but they bring them home from school at least.  Good enough.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4109/4950264768_e90e71b8b4.jpg"">
Freaky.  Of course it wasn't until the last update that I even realized that babies of one big dog and one little dog resulted in a clone of the mother.  Thanks, <lj user=""hidden_kitten"">, for letting me know!  Lesson learned.  But he's still cute, so I'll keep him.

Yay for bringing friends home from school!

LTW for Kari!  New one is 50 First Dates.  Um, no.  Not gonna happen.  I will not have you stepping out on my Toronto, thanks.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4091/4949671749_03844e50fe.jpg"">
Toronto was getting to the end of his adult years, and I couldn't bear to let him age yet, so he asked for long life.  Ah, a few more precious days as a beautiful adult.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4150/4950265262_0ec09f4260.jpg"">
FAIL!  Poor Toronto.  But, he even looks cute when he's failing.  I don't want him to grow old!

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4122/4950265370_1db8f025e1.jpg"">
Mmmm, yum.  And thankfully, no more girl clothes.  lol.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4125/4949672195_972c2be2f3.jpg"">
The first teen anyone brings home, and Ajax has to zap him.  Nice, Ajax.  That's not exactly going to win you any friends.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4120/4949672279_8d4e638b42.jpg"">
Guess he doesn't care.  Ottawa's really enjoying herself too.  I'm not sure if it's an outgoing thing or a mean thing.  Maybe a bit of both?

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4124/4949672381_2eeca3971b.jpg"">
Clearly, he's crazy.  Look at those eyes.  As if he seriously enjoyed beating the crap out of that guy.  Well, that's his 0 nice points at work.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4107/4950265858_e9dee204a4.jpg"">
Whoa, Kari, those are some pretty strong negative vibes there.  Let's see how ugly this guy really is.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4145/4950265968_8c89b680e4.jpg"">
Really?!  Kari, I realize you married Toronto, so your taste in guys can't totally suck, but holy crap, your taste in guys sucks!  He must be in my legacy!

I love the matching athletic outfits.  But Elmira's a little more hardcore, so I think I like hers better.  Biker-ballerina chic. I wish they had something like that for teens.

I thought for sure that Caledon was gay, based on some of his interactions with other guys, but when I checked his sexuality, it said he was straight.  Mmmkay.  Methinks someone is in denial.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4113/4950266940_8914532dab.jpg"">
Yeah, I couldn't let him age yet.  Wish #3 was for long life again.  8X

Even with the fast metabolism perk, Cal still got fat, so he's working off those extra pounds, and clearly loving every minute of it.

Yes, Toronto is STILL working toward his LTW.  I'm a bad Sim goddess.  I haven't been forceful enough in making him skill every free second he has.  Also, hi, Thunder Bay!  Heh, I almost wrote Thunder Gay.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4129/4950267470_3fe5bcb4ee.jpg"">
Aww, she's such a good mom!  This whole family is very loving, although hardly any of them are best friends with each other.  I find it so hard for my sims to raise their long-term relationship score.  It should just automatically rise as they spend time together.  In order to make anyone best friends, I basically have to do family kiss and friendly hug over and over again, just to raise the score.  It's too much work.  I don't remember it always being this much work.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4083/4950267606_02da564ab8.jpg"">
Moncton sings!  Or howls.  W/e.  He's cute.  I do wonder why I even bother with pets though.  I forget about them 95% of the time.  It took almost all of Thunder Bay and Saugeen Shores's full adult lives before they were finally taught one skill so that they could get their first promotions.  I doubt I'll be able to keep up pet breeding forever.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4124/4950267756_5110d94074.jpg"">
Prime example showing that my sims are not close enough: Cal tried to dance with Bellville, and she wasn't having any of it.  Poor Caledon.

The kids go to the community lot I made, and Belleville heads straight for pirate ship.  She's not exactly the scariest sea captain, but I don't think anyone could resist her!  

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4073/4949675097_ee1db5cbd3.jpg"">

Oh, that's a great way to get into her pants, Cal.  Just scare the crap out of her and the whip her in the face with a balloon. 
Not that I would've minded if it backfired on him.  She's kind of weird looking, and I don't want him with another blonde-haired sim.  But, he got his way.  He developed a crush on her without my help.  Damn him.  I think I ended up giving in to him and let them go steady, so if he makes it as heir, it'll be fun making him break her little heart when I ultimately pair him with someone else.  Poor girl.  I can already hear her heart shattering.  Sniffle.

The headmaster is one of those guys who tries to show his students that he's cool and hip, when in reality, everything he does just shows how lame he really is.  I apparently suck at taking pictures, since there are no more of Mr. Cool, but all three kids got into private school.  And just in time for Cal to graduate (with inteen.)  Pooey.  He would've looked hot in that uniform too.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4106/4950269718_8beff7663c.jpg"">
This was a random walk-by, but he's really hot, so I immediately had Elmira (I keep wanting to call her Etoile for some reason!) go out and greet him and flirt with him.  Just in case she doesn't find someone worth her attention in college.  And just in case she becomes heir.  I still can't decide.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4111/4949676407_d2e4598ce8.jpg"">
Meanwhile, Belle is outside, playing in the leaves.  I thought she was just raking them up at first, but then she jumped right in.  So cute.  She looks so happy!

Mackenzie Rowan!  Hiiiiiiii!  I've put her in a house with five other Rowan women.  I downloaded two of the guys too, but for some reason, I couldn't find them when I opened CAS.  Oh well.  At least I got the women.

I love shy sims when they flirt with others.  They're so cute.  Belle flirts it up with Daryl, the guy she brought home from school.  He is one hot sim, so I couldn't let her pass up the chance.  They have two bolts together.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4081/4949676835_9fc9fce47c.jpg"">
And Belle becomes the first kid to get her first kiss!  I feel bad for her older siblings.  Stupid hack problem.  They'll get their chance in college.

Uh....that's not so good.  College may end up being an issue for these guys.  I can't wait to find out what happens.  *evil laugh*

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4097/4950270410_4bea95206f.jpg"">
And Belle is completely oblivious to everything.  Let's hope, for her sake, that it stays that way.

Smustle time again!  I don't usually pay attention to sims smustling, because it annoys me that it makes them so tired and so dirty so quickly, but I couldn't look away when Cal started doing it.  He's so freaking cute, even with that giant zit on his chin.  Oh, and I sent him to college almost directly after this.  I just want to get to the next gen!  I don't want Kari and Toronto to be dead before the next gen comes!

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4083/4950270690_ec63743e76.jpg"">
Snazzy uniform, Elmira!  This uniform was made for her.  Maxis clearly had Elmira in mind when they created these uniforms.  lmao.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4153/4949677493_0afc98b327.jpg"">
The next morning before school, she teaches one of the dogs how to shake.  I can't remember if it was Moncton or Saugeen.  I think it's so cute, when the dog looks down and watches her take his paw and shake it.  Adorable.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4113/4949677647_46936d8941.jpg"">
I decided I'd have to wait forever just to make the dogs age up, and I didn't want to have a million dogs for the next gen, so Belle gave Saugeen Shores to Ochre Kohler-Wielle.  I forgot to take a picture of the actual transaction, so this is them giving each other that tough hug.  I felt kind of bad about it, but three dogs were too many.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4120/4949677875_54acf2df61.jpg"">
Immediately after, she tried to admire, but he shut her down immediately.  Which is probably a good thing, because Daryl was right there on the couch beside them. I'd completely forgotten about him.  Thankfully, she hadn't done anything too incriminating.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4086/4949678015_b7e4efd2f9.jpg"">
Toronto grew old!  :(  He's still a hottie, though.  I don't think anything could really make him ugly.  The pretty will always shine through.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4110/4950271510_ff85deb580.jpg"">
And we'll leave off with a shot of Toronto and Kari kissing.  They're both old, but they've still got it.  They're more together now than they were before.  In fact, right after he aged, all of his wants were centred around Kari.  You'd think they were on a date, he's so absorbed with entertaining her and hugging her and flirting with her. 

Next time, college!  Not sure what else, because I haven't started playing it yet, but hopefully it'll be pretty epic.  *fingers crossed*

Kristen Stewart with just about any other actress, in any movie she's in, but especially Twilight.  I'm not saying the movies would've been Oscar-worthy with someone else as Bella, but they'd at least be watchable.  I don't understand why Hollywood thinks she can act."

Let's start off with something cute!  Caledon looks so happy, cuddling with Thunder Bay.  So adorable.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4078/4915579532_a2a52b4fe7.jpg"">
Uh....I don't think you two are supposed to impale each other like that.  Actually, Thunder Bay looks like one of those plushie backpacks, just hanging there like that.  lol.

INVISIBLE BIKE!

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4123/4915579660_361c315b24.jpg"">
This is the first muffin that either of them have burnt, a few days into their childhood.  Poor Ajax.  He looks so devastated.  I think it's a pretty good record though!  The majority of their muffins come out perfectly baked.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4076/4914975127_2694b039a8.jpg"">
WTF is it with the boys wearing nightgowns?  I know I downloaded a few old fashioned pieces of clothing, but holy crap, what are the odds?  I wonder if they're unisex pj's.  That might explain things a little bit better.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4080/4915579824_6375dbbeaa.jpg"">
D'awwwww.  She's actually a somewhat decent nanny, actually.  But I think I screwed something up when I aged her down.  She shows up at the house every day, whether they need her there or not.  Which, I guess isn't bad.  She sometimes cooks for them and cleans for them, so at least she's useful.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4136/4915579896_1b308f160d.jpg"">
So cute!  They're best friends, thanks in part to the activity table.  I love that thing.  It's too bad that it can't help them become best friends with Toronto and Kari.  Most of my kids don't end up being best friends with their parents because it's just too hard to increase their long-term relationship.  But, last look at Ottawa and Ajax as kids!

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4123/4914975371_6e18f72c39.jpg"">
Teen!Ajax!  Cuuuuuute.  I definitely think he's grown into his looks.  Hopefully he'll keep those looks.  I've had a few boys who were cute as teens but then beyond creepy looking when they grew up.  Anyway, stats!

<u>Ajax Ontario</u>
Aries
9,8,5,6,0
Pleasure/Grilled Cheese
LTW: 50 1st dates
Ons: Unemployed/Artistic
Off: Make up
OTH: Games

Boo on the LTW, and boo on the turn off!  Well, that's a point against him.  Well, we'll see.  Maybe I'll end up changing his personality in college.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4081/4914975453_242e64280f.jpg"">
And Teen!Ottawa!  Eh, she's still looking a little draggy to me.  I don't know.  Maybe it's the make up.  I'm still not decided on her.  Stats for Ottawa!

<u>Ottawa Ontario</u>
Gemini
5,9,9,6,1
Romance/Popularity
LTW: 20 simultaneous lovers
Ons: Formal wear/hats
Off: Make up
OTH: Sports

I'm not liking her LTW or Turn ons and off either!  The turn ons and the turn off will most likely hamper her ability to acquire lovers.  She might need a change in uni too.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4141/4915580176_85957b5973.jpg"">
Almost immediately after their makeovers, which are immediately after they age, Ottawa initiates Ajax into teendom with a noogie.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4096/4914975593_f7cbde5d3c.jpg"">
This is one of my favourite expressions in the game.  I think it's hilarious, so much shock from a noogie, as if he's saying, ""I thought we were friends!""  Lol.  Awesome.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4101/4914975655_059c92fe85.jpg"">
But he gives it right back to her a moment later.  He's not going to take her shit!

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4123/4915580418_76e79429d5.jpg"">
Ottawa looks like some sort of Glamazon on the bike like this.  She looks like she should be in the WWE is one of the Divas.  She's weird, sometimes she looks hot, like this, and other times, she looks awful.  I still can't decide about her.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4100/4915580502_ffd019a7db.jpg"">
....This is one of the latter moments.  Of course, it's not surprising, considering all the steroids she's obviously taking.  This looks like a triple dose.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4082/4915580588_0224de6dc4.jpg"">
Meanwhile Ajax is busy failing to teach Caledon how to talk.  Hmm, maybe she's onto something with the drugs....

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4100/4914975975_fe29e0c39e.jpg"">
Then again, maybe he has sampled a little something from her stash...

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4115/4915580758_88bf9e3584.jpg"">
Even after three kids and several years together, these two still go at it all the time.  It's actually kind of annoying, because it takes away from Toronto's skilling, but I can't say no to them.  They just love each other so much! 

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4096/4914976147_e343c95d58.jpg"">
Caledon grew up!  And he's cute too!  He reminds me a tiny bit of Cosmo Broke.  So far, I think he might be my favourite.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4094/4914976259_9d6e2d5267.jpg"">
Ottawa isn't too happy about this.  Sorry, chickie!  You're going to have to do something special to impress me now!

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4077/4915581064_e055b8804d.jpg"">
And Ajax is looking a little nervous too.  Aww, poor Ajax.  I want to hug him when he looks like this.  But I don't play favourites or anything.  Nooo, not at all.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4099/4914976465_78641529d3.jpg"">
Saugeen Shores grew up!  Aww, she's so cute.  

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4142/4914976581_6e2bb2b111.jpg"">
For some reason, even though I got Thunder Bay first, and even though they were supposed to grow up at the same time, it took several more hours for Thunder Bay to grow up.  Weird.  His motives were all fine, and it wasn't as if he had lots of stuff in his queue.  He just wouldn't grow up.  I was a little worried for awhile.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4115/4915581352_16444162a9.jpg"">
Finally, though, he did grow up.  I'm normally a cat person, but in game, I like having one little dog and one big dog.  I think it's fun to see how the puppies will turn out.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4136/4915581428_8a33f0f74b.jpg"">
YOU BITCH.  I only wanted three kids!  Fucking ACR.  Ajax isn't very happy either. 
<b>Ajax:</b> Goddammit!  Like I needed any more competition! 
<b>Me:</b> *pets Ajax*  Poor boy.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4119/4914976859_9e3ebbbcdf.jpg"">
Guess who's been spying again!  Actually, this time I think he was using the Intelligence career reward.  I've never had a sim who's had this reward before, so I wanted to know what it could do.  Can they actually get anything good from this reward, or does it just summon angry neighbours?  Cause the telescope does that job just as well.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4094/4914976925_be7fd32409.jpg"">
HOW IS THIS OKAY?!?!?!?  I'm pretty sure that Toronto and nanny have next to no relationship score at all.  I really should turn on my special event camera again though.  It's alerted me in the past to secret and completely wrong bedroom shenanigans.  But I'm pretty sure these two haven't done any of that shit.  I hope.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4115/4914976989_8ab6065099.jpg"">
Somehow Ajax looks a lot less intimidating on the bike than Ottawa does.  But then, he's not all hopped up on the roids, and therefore, isn't full of rage like his sister is.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4078/4915581764_5f0904d994.jpg"">
O.o  Wait....Are you pissed at him, or do you think he's hot?
<b>Toronto:</b> Little of column A, little of column B.
......Okay then.  As long as Kari never finds out, I'm sure all will be well.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4081/4914977155_0f2a30d087.jpg"">
I waited a good long time before I let anyone use the genie.  I really wanted them to work for their money and lifetime platinum status, and the other wishes just don't really mean too much when they're all that young, but eventually, I caved.  With another kid on the way, the house needed to be bigger.  *mutters* Stupid Kari getting pregnant again.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4120/4915581976_956a6d289b.jpg"">
Ooh, sparklies!  And then sacks of money started falling.  Hello, house renovations!

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4114/4914977327_483ec4a5ae.jpg"">
Um...Caledon, sweetie, I would suggest that maybe you don't eat the blocks, kthx.  They're not that great for digestion.

Puppy making time!  Toronto and Ottawa are VERY fascinated.  I'm not sure if that means they should watch <i>more</i> or <i>less</i> Discovery Channel.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4094/4915582374_e086c155f8.jpg"">
The twins gossip about Kari all the time.  Maybe it's a mean sim thing.  I'm not sure.  I don't usually have mean sims.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4099/4915582440_f773f3e369.jpg"">
This seems to happen a lot too.  This girl doesn't seem to be having any luck today.

Baby time!

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4081/4914977837_2e4b0b9913.jpg"">
...And Modena Kohler-Wielle decides to show up for the birth.  I'm not sure that any of them have actually met her, but hey, the more the merrier!

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4140/4915582752_aef949aae8.jpg"">
Sigh...and another girl, Belleville, also with black hair and Kari's eyes.  Five kids!  I was hoping to stay away from this many kids this legacy!  Stupid ACR.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4101/4914978167_9c5fa76373.jpg"">
At least this time, Toronto and Kari have help.  Ajax is an excellent big brother.  He loves taking care of the babies.  It's so cute, watching him with them.  Cute enough that I think it puts him in the race for heirdom!

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4075/4914978213_27b65d6cc3.jpg"">
I decided to give Ottawa a makeover to make her look a little less like a hooker, and I decided that a few piercings was what she needed. I wanted her to have just a nose ring, but apparently all I have are combo sets, so a nose ring and an eyebrow ring it is.  I think she looks better now.  That blue eyeshadow was really turning me off.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4079/4915583040_b9ce527c88.jpg"">
Random people just keep stopping by to get high.  Again, no one in the family has ever met them.  They just drift in, get high all night and then leave sometime in the morning.  With this guy, I even got the warning in the morning about him missing work.  Slackers, the lot of them, and I'm getting the blame for it!

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4136/4914978401_5a4d0a1d09.jpg"">
Oh, that's classy guys.  She's a day old, and you're gossiping about her.  What could Belleville have possibly done that was so embarrassing and hilarious that it merits gossip like this?

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4140/4914978615_4055e938ac.jpg"">
What?!  Toronto, I told you to go to bed hours ago!  Why the hell are you passed out in your food?

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4075/4914978665_01c2ec68cc.jpg"">
Ohh, that's why.  Thunder Bay, get down from there!  You have a perfectly good bed outside.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4080/4914978739_f128713b92.jpg"">
Ohh, and again, I understand.  Didn't want to have a run in with Bailey, did you?  Sorry, buddy.  Just try to steer clear of him since he obviously doesn't like you.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4100/4914978849_e98efa58c6.jpg"">
Saugeen Shores had a puppy!  I wasn't even sure if she was pregnant to begin with.  I'd had to have her and Thunder Bay do it several times just for good measure.  This was a surprise though.  Anyway, it's a boy named Moncton.  I love puppies and kittens!  They're so cute!  

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4139/4914978481_d1a1ec1290.jpg"">
The twins have grown up!  Belleville looks quite a bit like Ottawa, which is unfortunate.  Something about them is just weird, though Ottawa has gotten better since the makeover.  Hopefully Belleville will grow into her looks a little bit more too.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4078/4915583322_31942fe8f1.jpg"">
Elmira, on the other hand, is freaking adorable!  Already, she's a great contender.  So. Freaking.  Cute.

That's it for now!  I'll try to have the next part out soon, but I've still got a bunch to play.  There will be lots of aging and possibly some college though, and hopefully no deaths.  We'll see!

Sigh, Flickr has changed their site, and I don't understand how to get to the bigger sized pictures anymore.  It wasn't until I had everything all written out and had hit the preview button that I realized that all the pictures are smaller than they usually are.  Does anyone know how to get to the bigger pictures?  Or do you guys like the smaller ones better?  Let me know what you think!  Until next time!

Back for a second installment!  Sorry it took so long.  I had some issues with my game.  I didn't realize until at least two or three sim weeks into the new legacy that no one was bringing friends home from school or work.  So, after getting some good advice from a few very nice simmers, I was able to narrow down my search and got rid of the hacks that were the problems.  It still took me all day to figure out which hacks they were though, and after that, I just didn't feel like playing for a few days.  Or updating about them.  

But now I'm feeling better about the whole thing, so I'm ready to go!  <lj-cut text=""Allons-y!"">

To recap, Toronto started life on a beach lot with a few meager possessions.  He met Kari when she invited him downtown, and he decided he wanted her to be his bride.  But although they had a bolt together, and then two bolts when he upped his logic skill, it took them FOREVER to get together because she's so shy.  Finally though, she moved in with $1000 (seriously?  She was an astrunaut.  WTF).  He knocked her up, so they had a quickie wedding, and we left off with her giving birth.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4077/4829274571_63c02c8f70_b.jpg"">
She was only supposed to have one kid, but I hit the randomizer on the trips and quads pop up and ended up with twins.  This is Ottawa, a baby girl with mom's hair, dad's eyes and a skintone in between the two. 

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4137/4829885540_332245c625_b.jpg"">
And this is Ajax, a boy with mom's hair, dad's eyes and a light skintone.  I've got all my skins geneticized, so it's never really just a matter of blending skintones.  These two seem relatively normal, though, so far. 

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4096/4829885618_04977b3d8a_b.jpg"">
<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4098/4829885702_574e2ab77d_b.jpg"">
Aww, Kari's a good mommy.  Well, sort of.  She's always taking the kids out of their cribs and feeding them, but if I didn't instruct her to put them back in their cribs, I'm sure they'd end up on the floor.  And is it even possible for parents or nannies to actually use the changing table autonomously?  I've seen them change the diaper without the table, and I've seen the nanny put toddlers on the potty, even before they've actually learned the skill, but that's it.  And that potty thing, I've never seen before this legacy.  Maybe it's a hack that I've got.  lol. 

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4121/4829275013_da83887883_b.jpg"">
Toronto's a good daddy too, though most of the time, I have to actually tell him to interact with the kids.  Kari's more autonomously into the kids than he is.  But he's pretty, so we forgive him.  Haha. 

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4134/4829275121_e29a08fb0e_b.jpg"">
Ooh, pretty nanny.  I don't think I've ever had a pretty nanny before.  They've always been hideous.  

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4095/4829886052_511244bce8_b.jpg"">
So I had to age her down. Preeeeeeeeeeeetty.  Of course, I didn't realize that once you age them down, they're not technically the nanny anymore?  Or something?  Anyway, Toronto wouldn't go to work even though she was still in the house.  But when he called the nanny service, he had to cancel the service and then start it again, and he still got her anyway.  Weird.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4138/4829886138_22e7cd7f59_b.jpg"">
Well, it's nice to know that she still fails like any other nanny.

Ajax as a toddler!  Cuuuuuuuuuuuuute!

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4140/4829886402_f3b0710c9f_b.jpg"">
And Ottawa....Eh.  She looks kind of boyish.  And not in a cute, androgynous kind of way.

Uh...whoops.  I guess buying those extra toddler toys meant nanny couldn't get paid.  That was a nice mirror too!  And she wouldn't come back for a few days after that.  WTF?  Yeah, that makes sense.  Make Toronto miss work so that when you do come back, they <i>still</i> won't be able to pay you.  Stupid hot nanny.

I love this hack.  I don't care if it's cheating.  It was either this or get toddler mats, and they couldn't afford both the cribs and the mats.  Plus, she looks so happy, climbing out of the crib!

Neither of the parents had any wants that had anything to do with the kids, so Toronto gets the awesome job of teaching the kids to talk, and Kari gets to potty train.  She's so cute.  Even when she's bored, she's got an adorable smile on her face.  She`s got to be one of my favourite spouses.  She looks like a chipmunk!

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4098/4829276207_e03978d662_b.jpg"">
She's even cute when she's all focused on her exercising.  So determined.  *pounces*

So cute in his My Little Pony pj's!  

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4137/4829276337_622df1ab34_b.jpg"">
They're both cute.  I think this is one of my favourite actions in the whole game.  It's impossible to escape the cute!

So weird.  This is the third time something like this has happened.  First he got off the bus at the house a couple of times.  This time, he was walking by the house when the bus showed up, and he just got on.  Weird.  I hope it's not a sign that something's wrong with my hood or my game.  I still am tempted to marry him into the family though.  Probably not this generation though, since the kids were almost all the way through their teens before I realized no one was bringing anyone home from work and school.  Maybe next gen.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4117/4829887470_cbf09bdc95_b.jpg"">
Uh, Ottawa, I don't think that's a great idea....

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4080/4829887604_755e3dda66_b.jpg"">
I think it's just dawned on her.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4123/4829276795_19be46e67b_b.jpg"">
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand here it comes.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4079/4829276939_8178f402f3_b.jpg"">
And then it's like nothing happened at all!

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4073/4829277123_e3e1be82d5_b.jpg"">
Why, yes I did!

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4077/4829888152_4b86835593_b.jpg"">
They both grew up well!  But um....I think you guys might have your pjs reversed...

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4136/4829888264_423299c2fa_b.jpg"">
Anyway, Ajax is cute!  I think he's got a bit of both of his parents in him.  

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4120/4829277497_6ef6c0d661_b.jpg"">
Well, she's a little bit cuter now.  *shrugs*  I don't know if it's the specific skin tone or what, but there's something about her that's unappealing.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4101/4829888554_6380b4be58_b.jpg"">
It took three nights of summoning aliens before they finally bit and dragged him off.  Sigh.  The things I do for alien spawn.  Poor Toronto.  Don't worry, bb.  It'll all be over in a few (excruciating) hours.  :)

><img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4121/4829888676_6656f2507c_b.jpg"">
Of course, no one's worried about Toronto's disappearance last night and what might be happening to him on that ship.  No one came out to freak out when he got abducted, and now, the only reason they're outside is to complain about how loud the space ship is.  Kari couldn't even be bothered to come out of the house at all.  Worthless family.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4098/4829888830_24f78c67bf_b.jpg"">
Poor T.O.  Actually, I don't get it.  Knowledge sims get a good memory from being abducted, but they all have the freak out when they get dropped from the ship.  Which I understand, anyone would be freaked out after being poked and prodded by aliens for several hours.  But then immediately after they're like, ""That was awesome!  Let's do it again!""  Weird.  I don't get it.

Mini pre-work/school study party!  I don't know why, but it's taking so long for T-Dot to get his LTW.  He's already halfway through adulthood, and he's nowhere near maxing all his skills.  :(  I think I've lost some of my skill at playing the game over the several weeks that I wasn't able to play.  

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4093/4829278093_3a1f3110ef_b.jpg"">
One thing about these kids...they're freaking geniuses.  This is her first time baking, and the muffin comes out perfectly.  And that was after she left it in the oven for half a sim hour.  Any other kid could take it out the moment after they put it in, and it'd come out burnt.  Almost all the muffins these two make come out perfectly.  Why can't all my kids be this awesome!

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4081/4829278201_9c353359c7_b.jpg"">
Muahahahaha!  Someone's preggers!  Alien spawn coming soon!

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4117/4829278345_c4086943a8_b.jpg"">
Hey, it's Daystar Ouroboros, made by <lj user=""bondchick_nett"">!  He does not appreciate being spied on by Toronto and comes over to express his ire about the invasion of privacy.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4074/4829278489_d2fdb5cb47_b.jpg"">
Toronto's not having any of it though.  He's not going to take being pushed around in his own house!  He pushes right back!

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4134/4829889586_42e9c75f94_b.jpg"">
And...Daystar likes it?  Maybe he's a masochist.  Maybe he likes it rough?

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4122/4829278819_9843b0a59c_b.jpg"">
Almost immediately afterward, Toronto goes right back outside to spy on Daystar again.  Did you get a glimpse into his dungeon, bb?
<b>Toronto:</b> I'm scarred for life!

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4119/4829278913_65e1c29955_b.jpg"">
Daystar's learned a few things in his dungeon, only this time, when he goes in for the strangle hold, it's not for any kind of sexual gratification.  I think.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4138/4829279015_467d0bc86f_b.jpg"">
Aww, so cute and dorktastic!

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4115/4829890002_919355f10f_b.jpg"">
That doesn't stop them though.  They're so cute together.  But they're not really overly affectionate, so it's not annoying.  

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4076/4829279143_d25464fec6_b.jpg"">
Baby time!  Muahahaha.  

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4079/4829279301_e8278e7f8c_b.jpg"">
A boy, Caledon.  It was the most alien name I could think of that was also a place in Ontario.  He's got blond hair and Toronto's eyes.  Now, this was about the time that I realized that when I downloaded this set of eyes, I mustn't have geneticized them in SimPE.  After this, I went right out to do just that.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4140/4829279405_db8aa46e58_b.jpg"">
I think Ajax is a little excited to have a little brother.  Haha.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4073/4829279523_0df6ec5b30_b.jpg"">
Aww, he's such a good daddy.  And he actually had a couple of wants for this baby, unlike the older kids.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4076/4829279657_00945e0f5b_b.jpg"">
Insert question about anal probing here.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4143/4829279797_706babd934_b.jpg"">
The kids wanted a pet, so they got a puppy!  His name is Thunder Bay.  He's so tiny!  He makes the lamp look ginormous.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4116/4829890744_990d4a9f23_b.jpg"">
And, because I want to breed some puppies, they got another dog.  This is Saugeen Shores.  She's gonna be a big dog, and he'll be a small dog, so what comes out will be interesting!

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4120/4829890874_8d98ea7838_b.jpg"">
Uh....why are there two nannies?  I hope we're not paying double, cause these guys can't afford it.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4120/4829890964_1a9ba672a6_b.jpg"">
And we'll leave off with Caledon's first toddler shot!  So cute.  I think we've got some potential here!

New Legacy!  My old computer died on me, and while I had backed up my Sims folder a little while ago, it wasn't completely backed up when the computer went down.  I've still got much of the Veilleux legacy (my apocalypse challenge) in the Sims folder that I moved from my external drive to my new computer, but some of the stuff that I'd played on the old computer is lost forever.  That sort of depressed me, and I didn't feel like replaying that stuff (at least not right now, anyway), so I decided to make a new legacy until I feel like continuing the other one.

So here it is!  It's just a regular legacy, because after working on the apocalypse challenge for so long, I just want something simpler to do for now.  And since I'm proudly Canadian--proudly Ontarian--I've decided that my founder and all children will be named after cities and towns in Ontario.  

<lj-cut text=""Let's get started!"">

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4075/4804094650_581a7a0b8d_b.jpg"">
First off, here is our fearless new founder, Toronto Ontario!  I rolled all his stats rather than choosing them myself, because I wanted to leave something to chance.  Here they are!

<u>Toronto Ontario</u>
Leo
5,9,5,6,0
Knowledge/Fortune
LTW: Max all 7 skills
Turn Ons: Custom hair, Logical
Turn Off: Stink
OTH: Games

I rolled Leo for him and then I just tweaked his stats a little bit so that they wouldn't be just the default leo stats.  For the turn ons and off, I rolled first to determine which page to choose from (since there are 6 pages), and then I rolled again to choose the stat.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4119/4804094762_5856e3c11d_b.jpg"">
These are his digs.  Since it's summer, he can afford to live without walls for now.  lol.  I had to spend a good deal of the leftover money to flatten the land.  That's the crappy thing about beach lots--a lot of flattening is needed.  :(

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4081/4804094874_f73b6a5abc_b.jpg"">
He wanted a career in intelligence, and he got it right away, so he was at work when the welcoming party showed up.  Two of them left before he got home, but ugly red-headed dude stuck around, and we flagged down cute blond teen so that he could start making friends.  Yeah, he never talked to either of them after greeting them.  Well, except once.  URHD was all about the fake out.  He did it to CBT, and then immediately afterward, did it to Toronto.  I guess Toronto wrote him off right there.  Fine by me.  This guy will not be joining the legacy anytime soon.  *shudders to think what his kids would look like*

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4116/4804094942_fb51263fee_b.jpg"">
I guess CBT wasn't too impressed with URHD's fake out either.  Directly afterward, he headed down to the beach and just sat for hours, staring out at the horizon.  Awesome.  And emo kid.  Maybe I don't want him in this legacy either.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4093/4803463825_834f911980_b.jpg"">
<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4114/4804095134_10ef4d2cf8_b.jpg"">
Later on, Toronto was invited downtown, and since the welcoming party was obviously a bust for potential mates, Toronto went.  The pickings weren't bad!  Five chicks, and a dude.  And at least a couple of those chicks looked like they were out looking for man meat too, so I'd say it was a pretty good match.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4140/4803464029_24b1ee6743_b.jpg"">
They went to play poker, and Toronto immediately bee-lined for the booze to tank up on liquid courage.  Not that he needs it, with nine outgoing points, but who was I to stop him.  Kari, the one who invited him out, followed him out just to stare at him.  

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4142/4804095324_551e46a99a_b.jpg"">
Toronto took that as a good sign and decided to admire her a little.  She's so shy, but so cute!  And she didn't turn him down!  Yay for good signs!  

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4101/4803464233_9c848231d5_b.jpg"">
So, encouraged, we tried a little flirting next, but uh uh, she wasn't having it.  Liiiittle bit hot and cold, are we, Kari?
<b>Kari:</b> Listen, bitch, I like what I like, and I don't appreciate lame-ass pick up lines!  He's gonna have to do better than that!
oooooookay, moving on.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4081/4803464351_97cd37ec1b_b.jpg"">
So I had Toronto scope the room, hoping we'd be able to find someone a little more sane to hit on.  Well, he doesn't seem too picky...

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4097/4804095704_c561551d2c_b.jpg"">
But no, it has to be Kari.  Sigh.  *grumbles* Can't believe boy's gonna make me work to get him a women.  Grumble, grumble.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4135/4804095824_6a5cc1071e_b.jpg"">
She definitely seems to like it when he flirts with her this time.  It only took about an sim hour or so of asking about her interests before she could appreciate any kind of flirting.  Stubborn ass woman.  Grumble, grumble.  How could anyone turn away someone as hot and obviously suave as Toronto?  Look at him, he's gorgeous!  And he's into you!  Be thankful!  Especially since I was sorely tempted to make him gay.  He's almost too beautiful to be straight.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4077/4804095892_b0294c72eb_b.jpg"">
Finally, they went home and shared a dinner of hot dogs and conversation about the merits of socializing and meeting new people.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4117/4803464721_8555d22002_b.jpg"">
He's beautiful, but this is a little bit creepy.  I don't think it's possible for him to completely close his eyes.  Maybe because they're too big?  Or because they're kind of weirdly shaped?  His eyes are always slightly open when he sleeps.  Creepy.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4143/4804096084_a35f6da276_b.jpg"">
Creeeeeeeeepy.  Although, I'll bet her image helps her business.  Those kind of eyes must clearly be able to see into the future, or other dimensions or something.  *shudder*

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4117/4804096192_a2a8cb3caa_b.jpg"">
Toronto invited Kari over the next day, and they hugged hello.  Even though their relationship is high enough for hugs yet.  Weird.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4099/4804096284_067d63feab_b.jpg"">
She also brought her friend Viola over.  Creepy.  I think Viola is more into Toronto than Kari is, and she's decent-looking.  Good enough to be a potential mate for Toronto, but he doesn't want her.  He's all about Kari the Complicated.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4120/4804096398_6e4a01569c_b.jpg"">
They have to spend a long while talking and engaging in simple flirting before she'll allow anything heavier than that.  It's taken two days just to become friends.  It's way too much work, but he wants her, so he must have her.  Apparently Shane, here, must have her too.  
<b>Shane:</b>She likes blond hair?  Sweet, I'm in!
Uh, sorry kid, she may be complicated and not let Toronto get anywhere with her, but she wants him.  Maybe you'll get your chance next gen or something.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4094/4803465363_5e3db50c8c_b.jpg"">
Yeah, he tried to hug her, and she was having none of it.  You guys are friends!  WTF!  God, she's so freaking bi-polar.  She makes me want to slap her, and I swear I'm not a violent person.  Look what you did to poor Toronto!  He's so upset!  *pets and huggles Toronto*

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4116/4804096656_c428cbaaa8_b.jpg"">
And in the next second, she's following him around like a groupie.  Um, I realize he's beautiful, and you should be grateful that he's giving you any attention at all, but impaling his torso with your BODY?  Probably not the best way to get to his heart, mmkay?

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4142/4804096778_fac412ece3_b.jpg"">
The next day, I spot hot mail lady Marylena, and I figured, maybe Toronto would have an easier time getting into her pants than into Kari's, since they'd known each other for like, four days now, and she still wouldn't even let him kiss her, even though they share one bolt.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4099/4804096880_4ee9c581fa_b.jpg"">
Well, she seems to like what she sees.  But nothing came of this.  I couldn't get her to do more than talk to her, and when I tried to use casual flirting, she so wasn't into it.  Alright, Kari it is then.  Dammit.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4117/4803465837_f2083be550_b.jpg"">
He's just so freaking cute.  God, I love Toronto.  

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4074/4804097118_d5463c18d1_b.jpg"">
Ugh, this is why I should've splurged on some sort of flooring for him.  Stupid weeds.  Stupid sink.  What kind of sink breaks in four days?  He should get a full refund for this POS.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4141/4804097236_62fe2ae929_b.jpg"">
This is how he deals with fixing the stupid thing.  Screaming at it and whacking it with the wrench.  For some reason, watching him reminded me of <a HREF=""http://antm05.multiply.com/photos/album/9/EPISODE_8_MAD_WITH_THE_WILD_BOYS#photo=11"">ANTM, cycle 5's Jayla</a>, in her photo shoot with the wild boys.  Only, less blow-up doll-like.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4078/4803466157_a58830b735_b.jpg"">
Toronto invited Kari over again, and they greeted each other by sucking face.  Progress?

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4122/4803466271_e372b0de79_b.jpg"">
Nope. He tried to kiss her again, and she was all, 'back off, bitch.'  At least this time, he was like, 'WTF, man?'  Maybe he's finally starting to see the crazy in her too.  ABOUT DAMN TIME.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4093/4804097592_0aab544307_b.jpg"">
Apparently he doesn't mind the crazy though, cause he kept at her.  Finally, she agreed to cuddle with him.  Keep in mind, this is close to a week after having met him AND seeing him every day.  AND they've got two bolts now, somehow.  WTF.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4137/4804097672_d88dd96680_b.jpg"">
FINALLY.  Finally they slept together.  They're not even close to being in love yet.  I think they might be barely best friends.  The first time he asked her for a committed relationship, she turned him down, the bitch.  At least she agreed to spend the night with him.  Although, at like, 3am, she climbed out of bed and snuck out!  Commitment-phobic bitch.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4142/4804097776_ca2e84c8cb_b.jpg"">
She doesn't mind being goosed by him, though she's still all like, *gaspgiggle* Toronto!  Bitch please, you've been stringing him along this whole time.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4078/4804097902_c5cdfea61f_b.jpg"">
Finally, on like, Saturday or Sunday of the first week, she agreed to move in, bringing $1000 and this assortment of stuff.  And then I found out that she was an astronaut!  WTF?!  An astronaut, and you only brought $1000?!  Bullshit.  You've got a secret account somewhere, don't you?  *grumbles* Stupid bitch, holding out on my baby.

><img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4095/4803466767_dea842834a_b.jpg"">
Not only that, but she makes over $1100 a day, and she's wearing a ratty, old, stained t-shirt and slippers?  Now I'm convinced.  But she is pretty after a makeover, so I'll have to forgive her.  Stats:

<u>Kari Charvat</u>
Virgo
9,2,6,3,5
Knowledge/Pleasure
LTW: Become Media Magnate
Ons: Blond hair, Logical
Off: Undies
OTH: Science

Ah, which explains why, at one point at the beginning of their relationship, they went from having one bolt to negative chemistry when he slept in his undies.  Someone's a little bit superficial!

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4099/4803466827_40d16b7088_b.jpg"">
But he loves her anyway, so he proposed to her.

And finally, showing the first bit of sense since she came into Toronto's life, she accepted.

After more than a week of grilling shit, Toronto finally starts the first fire of the legacy!  I'm pretty proud that it took that long.  Yay for not being a complete moron!  Just half of one for starting a fire on the grill in the first place.  But I can't stay angry at him for long when he looks so scared, dancing around in his undies.  Sigh.

Hot firelady!  Please to be joining the family at some point?

Aww muffin!  My Toronto is a sad panda.
<b>Toronto:</b> But I worked so hard on these.
Don't worry, bb.  You'll do better next time.

WTF, man?!  You've never even met Toronto, and you're kicking over his trash can?  Just for that, no legacy for you!

Ahaha, is someone preggo?  
<b>Kari:</b> Oh shit.  But we used a condom!
Yeah, but I poked holes in every last one of them.  Muhahaha!  You're gonna have kids whether  you like it or not!  I need future heirs!

Shotgun wedding!  Can't have the kid come out with the last name Charvat.  Oh and yeah, she popped.  I had a picture of it, but it was shit.  You've seen'em all anyway.

So cute.  I can't wait to see how good a daddy he'll be.

Um...okay?  And why is he getting off the bus here?  At one point, he got on the bus in the morning too.  He was just walking by and the bus showed up, and he got on.  Toronto and Kari have never even met him.  Weird.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4136/4803468277_87ed272899_b.jpg"">
Even weirder.  Shane, I know you want to get into Kari's pants, pretending you're part of the family isn't going to get the job done.  Neither is bribing her.  She kept the money though.  Serves the kid right.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4121/4804099600_862b8d4c8d_b.jpg"">
And we'll leave off with a labour shot!

<hr>

Hope you like it so far!  I'm obsessed with playing ever since I got the new computer, and I'm so excited that it actually works without lagging, and that it doesn't take half an hour to load up each time I play, so I'll hopefully have another update in a few days.  I think I've got enough pictures for another update.  

Also, now that I've got the new computer, I've been downloading other people's Sims too, so some of them might show up in further updates as well.  I can say that Toronto has already met Daystar Ouroboros, but more on that later!  Until next time!

Summary: The fallout after Noah's surgery.  Reid's POV
Disclaimer: I wish they were mine, but alas, they are not.

<lj-cut text=""Aftermath"">

""What have you done?"" Luke spat at me.

I was stunned, for once in my life.  Luke didn't give me a chance to respond though.  He paused for a beat, and then he turned on his heel and stormed away, ignoring his parents.  Snapping out of it, I followed the younger man, refusing to let him just walk away from me.  I never let anyone get the last word on me, not even this snivelling, self-important trust fund brat.  Especially not him.  He may have found a way to worm his way into my heart, but hell if I was going to let the kid scream at me like this.  I would not let Luke Snyder beat me down.

""What I've done is stabilized Noah,"" I said loudly as I followed Luke down the hall of the hospital.  ""And hopefully he'll make it through the night.  Hopefully he'll wake up tomorrow and be okay.""  Who cared if anyone heard what was being said.  Who cared what these small-town hicks thought anyway.  It wasn't as if their opinions meant anything to me.  Luke, on the other hand....Luke's opinion mattered to me more than I cared to admit.

Luke stopped at the sound of my voice, pausing a second before he turned around to face me.  His expression was a mixture of anger, frustration, fear and maybe just a hint of guilt.  I had the feeling that the guilt was what stopped him and forced him to listen to me.  He wouldn't have let me ruin a perfect exit scene, otherwise.  

I gestured for him to move into the floor's staff room and then followed him in.  I stepped a bit closer to him, and I lowered my voice a little as I started to speak again.  ""It may come as a surprise to you, but even brilliant minds like mine don't know all the answers.  Even I can't control the entire universe, though I'm not going to stop trying until I reach perfection.  I take calculated risks, Mr.Snyder.  Every surgeon does, when it comes to operating on people.  I'm just better than most at the calculations.  Today, I didn't get the exact answer I'd hoped I would.  Something went wrong, and yeah, it's bad, but it could be worse.  It could be a lot worse.  Noah could be laying in the morgue right now instead of in the recovery room.""  Luke winced as I said this, but it needed to be said.  I've always had the best results in arguments when I can shock my opponent into seeing things my way.  Anyway, Luke seemed to be letting go of some of his anger.  I could practically see the balloon deflating a little bit.  Good.  

""I did everything I could in there, not only to save Noah, but to cure him and bring back his sight, so I don't appreciate being screamed at by someone as clueless as you clearly are.  What, do you think I was aiming to kill Noah so that I could have you all to myself?  Please.  All I would have to do would be to wait for him to dump you for the next ridiculous reason he comes up with, and boom, I'd be in again.  I wouldn't risk my medical license--again--just for you, even if I thought it could work.  You're not that important.""  There went his anger, rising up again.  I could see it in his stance, his expression.  On a normal day, I liked it like this.  Things were always more interesting when we were verbally sparring.  But this wasn't a normal day.  This wasn't a regular playful sparring match.  This argument could determine the future of our relationship, or lack thereof.  And more importantly, I knew he was scared out of his mind about his ex, and any jealousy I might have felt about the whole situation would have to be put aside for now.  I softened my voice and stepped a little bit closer.  ""You know that I would never do anything to intentionally harm a patient, especially Noah, despite my feelings for you.  Because of my feelings for you.  You know that I always do everything I can for my patients, to cure them of whatever ailments they have or at least to make life better for them.  You should know that, especially after what we just went through in Dallas.  At the very least, I want to keep my medical license.  But you should know by now, after what I told you about Annie Chapman, that I do care about my patients, and that I always do absolutely everything I can for them.  I realize this is hard for you, considering he's the love of your life, but you don't have to worry, Luke, because I will do everything in my power to make sure that you two have a long and happy life together.""

I looked away then, unable to look him in the eye any longer.  Defense mechanisms had always worked well for me , but now I suddenly felt awkward and unsure of myself.  Well, I supposed there was a first time for everything.  Maybe the whole ordeal was getting to me more than I'd thought.

""I'm sorry I screamed at you, Reid,"" he said grudgingly, and I looked up at him again to see if he actually meant it.  I couldn't help but feel a little thrill at hearing my name on his lips.  Now he was the one not looking at me.  He was looking off to the side, one hand up, rubbing at the back of his neck.  That was guilt, with a bit of embarrassment and a generous dose of fear, still mixed in.  ""I'm just...I'm so worried about him.  If he doesn't...If he can't....""  

He looked so helpless, I couldn't help but go to him.  I placed one hand on his hip and gently caressed his cheek with the other, trying to soothe him.  It was awkward at best.  Maybe there was something I wasn't good at after all.  ""We'll make sure he gets better.  I'll make sure he gets better.  We'll find out where we stand when he wakes up, but I promise you, Luke, he will come out of this better than new if I have anything to say about it.  I will do everything I can to make sure he gets better.""

Luke looked at me with eyes full of pain but with a little bit of hope too.  They were glassy with unshed tears, and I had to bite my lip to keep from getting emotional myself.  I didn't do emotional, and it wouldn't help Luke right now anyway.  He, on the other hand, looked like he was going to fall apart right here.  I wrapped my arms around him and gently pulled him close, and he came without a fight.  I just hugged him tightly and rubbed his back a little, and he clung to me as if he would collapse without my support.  ""It's okay,"" I told him softly, still rubbig his back.  ""We'll get him through this.""

He was the one who pulled away first, but only a little bit, just enough so that he was looking at me.  I looked back at him, into his eyes for a moment.  He leaned forward, and I met him halfway.  It was a gentle kiss, just barely a brush of lips against lips at first, but then he increased the pressure a little bit, and I closed my eyes as I kissed him back, trying to pour all the comfort I could into it.  I could feel him relaxing a little in my arms, so I tightened them around him, holding him closer.  This wasn't how I'd pictured our first real kiss to come about, but I couldn't deny that it felt good.  I tried to savour the feeling of him in my arms, his lips against mine.  Who knew if I would ever get the chance again.  I hoped I would, under better circumstances and for the right reasons, but for now I just had to take what I could get.  He pulled away a few moments later and rested his head on my shoulder once again, and I just held him and hoped that it would be enough.

<lj-cut text=""In which Etoile joins Edward in college."">

I think I'm going forego storybook form for another couple of entries, at least until college is done, because I don't know who my heirs are going to be.  Hope no one minds.

We start of with Finn getting a little bit happy while 'stargazing.'  Either he's looking in through a girl's window and watching her undress, or he's just that excited about watching the stars.  Either way, it makes him seem pretty geeky and creepy.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4059/4524898600_793a8870c8_o.png"">
But, no matter how geeky he is, he thinks he's all that.  So that makes one person who thinks that.  He is decent-looking though.  Maybe he's actually geek-chic, but no one else realizes it but him.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4059/4524269571_28463709dc_o.png"">
And while Finn spends his time admiring himself in the mirror, Faith spends her time tucking her little sisters in. Aww.  She's such a good sister.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4062/4524899028_f6514ce403_o.png"">
Maybe Finn isn't as much of a geek as I thought.  He does this to her all the time.  The nerdy bully?  I....can't wrap my head around it.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4019/4524269495_06432fb6f7_o.png"">
Um...wha?  Really?  I didn't know ghosts could take out the garbage!  And I've been playing this game for years!  Wow, I need to pay closer attention to the ghosts.  I love you, Adarose!

Deme and Starla are still around.  Now that the kids are mostly grown, and the ones that aren't are taken care of by the teenagers, this is pretty much all that these two do.  Feed each other and flirt and make out and woohoo.  It's sweet, but it's pretty boring after awhile.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4018/4524899140_b1f8802199_o.png"">
Hallie grew up into a really pretty teen!  And suddenly, I don't mind her skin tone anymore.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4007/4524899214_5bff12fa24_o.png"">
OMG Gracelyn is absolutely gorgeous!  I think she might possibly be the most beautiful sim I've ever had.  Holy crap.  Um, favourite?

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4023/4524899310_b9690431d2_o.png"">
Aww, look at her struggling with her homework and flashing everyone at the same time.  So cute.  I'm pretty much convinced that she can do no wrong.  

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4063/4524899510_4b9ed05ea5_o.png"">
Look at her, all gorgeous-like in the moonlight.  Beautiful.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4068/4524270905_cf54bedbf1_o.png"">
<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4001/4524899784_1d5f3cbffa_o.png"">
I decided I had to give Faith and Hallie each a makeover to see if they could even try to compete with Gracie.  And yeah, they do both clean up very well, especially Faith.  She's still in the running for co-heir.  Sorry Hallie, you're out.  Though I wouldn't mind keeping you in a spares house like Chester and Deandra, maybe with the other loser of the heir race, and seeing how you guys fare.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4029/4524899584_de83fbd514_o.png"">
Um...Finn?  Liiiiiiiiiiiittle creepy, buddy.  I realize that you and Faith shared a womb, but I'm pretty sure that doesn't make it okay for you to watch her while she pees.  

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4037/4524899384_fe34e64240_o.png"">
I think he's scarred her for life too.  Please don't try to poison yourself with rancid KD, Faith!  We can get through this!  We can get you help!  This is not the way to go!
Also, Gracie looks adorable in the background.  She's so excited to eat chips!

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4062/4524899870_60ce706bdc_o.png"">
This generation is full of homosexuality and slight incest.  Solaris can't get Hallie off her mind...

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4038/4524271199_a29658b3cf_o.png"">
Well, at least until she starts making out with Cassiopeia.  Cassie's a liiiiiiiiiittle bit crazy, it seems.  Look at those eyes.  *Shudder*  There's something I wish I could un-see.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4005/4524271297_c20a3d216e_o.png"">
Ford's a teen!

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4013/4524900186_a869bb14ff_o.png"">
And so is Bentley!

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4068/4524900454_a1dc9061c9_o.png"">
And I guess that means they can take their relationship to the next level?  They're second cousins, so....I guess they're legal.  Weird, but...oh, I can't deny them their happiness.  They can keep their forbidden love.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4026/4524900324_39af765b2a_o.png"">
Not that I could really stop them, I don't think.  They'd find ways to sneak around behind my back.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4035/4524271677_c85ddccc8f_o.png"">
You know what?  Let's head off to college and see how Etoile and Edward are doing.  Etoile is looking very pretty and grown up these days.  And really cute!  These girls make it so hard to decide on heirs!  Damn them!

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4062/4524900652_fe9476e81a_o.png"">
Orlando's looking pretty good too!

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4017/4524900722_6354fb55e0_o.png"">
<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4026/4524900844_23959d3671_o.png"">
And of course, like every other couple who goes to college together, the moment they get there, they're all over each other.  Now that they don't have to hide their sexing from parents, they can do whatever they want!

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4010/4524272015_6a65a8645e_o.png"">
And as soon as they're done, she calls up Faith and gives her aaaaaaaaaaall the dirty details.  Poor Faith.  All her siblings are trying to kill her.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4028/4524272103_dc1753cfe0_o.png"">
Etoile and Orlando spend their after sex time doing different things.  Etoile stuffs her face with food...

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4006/4524272209_83d1c5d2cd_o.png"">
While Orlando stuffs his face with the bowl.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4032/4524272273_966a9ff038_o.png"">
<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4062/4524272361_d529a5f79b_o.png"">
Well, after all the sexing/eating/face smashing, it's finally time to get to schooling.  Etoile does a bit of studying before moving onto her assignment.  Suddenly college isn't as much fun as you thought it would be, is it, Etoile?

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4010/4524901368_709185e51c_o.png"">
Christina's not having much luck with her assignment either.  Senior papers are hard, k?

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4022/4524901452_91cdb83d02_o.png"">
Edward doesn't seem to be having too much trouble with his term paper.  He knows that he's the smart one in this relationship, and that fills him with a great sense of masculine pride.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4011/4524272639_35ace9687c_o.png"">
Um, NO.  You two are both madly in love with your respective Veilleuxes.  There is no reason for you to get it on with each other!  No reason!

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4025/4524272705_568109657d_o.png"">
Although...I might be able to see why Christina is into Orlando, cause he's clearly a lot cooler than beat box homey here.  Even Etoile wants nothing to do with her brother when he goes all gangsta.  

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4058/4524901704_070cec1e95_o.png"">
<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4005/4524272887_5e1e38dd9d_o.png"">
Thankfully, all is well in the world of coupledom.  As far as I know, Orlando and Christina didn't get it on, but who the hell knows with those two AND ACR kicking about.  I prefer to just think that they were both true to their loves.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4029/4524272947_856fc8647e_o.png"">
Oh, she's not studying.  She's still trying to find a believable, original way to bring Ianto back from the dead in her latest fanfic.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4059/4524273003_4a28f76a7e_o.png"">
Finally, it's time for Edward and Christina to graduate!  

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4038/4524902096_ec5cc249f6_o.png"">
Here he is as an adult!  <s>Be gone, Christina, temptress of Orlando!</s>  Good luck in the real world, you two!

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4007/4524273229_bf608d9b1d_o.png"">
Which just leaves Etoile and Orlando!  She spends her first moments in the empty house...catching fireflies.  Hmm, maybe she and Orlie aren't so constantly horny for each other after all.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4028/4524273363_98d8088d96_o.png"">
Well, if she'd been in the mood for sex earlier, now she definitely isn't.  She's too depressed about not catching fireflies to be able to perform.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4051/4524902500_5d6bb4a4ae_o.png"">
But that's okay.  By the next day, she's back to her usual self again.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4027/4524902584_ce117f5eae_o.png"">
And they proceeded to get in on directly after that.  And THIS is the main reason I hate college.  I hate that stupid mascot and the cheerleader and their annoying chants.  The cow is alright, just because she brings a little bit extra drama with her, but the llama and the cheerleader need to go.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4065/4524902672_403bbf3c57_o.png"">
You know what this means!  Orlando finally pops the question.  Aww, Etoile just looks so cute with her pointy ears and her big, excited smile.  I just want to pinch her cheeks and then snuggle her.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4004/4524273755_1da484feec_o.png"">
Of course she said yes.  He's really cute too!  These two are so disgustingly in love.  I can feel my teeth rotting, they're so cute.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4069/4524273839_e17ab1a86f_o.png"">
Then tragedy strikes.  One morning, she wakes up and starts getting sick, just out of the blue.

I didn't even know she was pregnant, but she's just devastated about it.  She wouldn't stop crying, and I couldn't get her to do anything.  She was just so upset.  I felt so bad for her!

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4048/4524903012_2f02bf25c5_o.png"">
Orlando was great to her though.  He comforted her and hugged her and kissed her, and made her feel a little bit better.  I wish there were more interactions like this.  They were so cute together, and I love when he takes care of her.  

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4037/4524903104_278be5d957_o.png"">
She also got a womrat to help her take her mind off of things.  I think his name is Peanut, but I""m not sure.  They got a bird too, and that seemed to ease her pain a little bit.  I basically gave her everything she wanted to bring her spirits back up because I couldn't bear to see her upset.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4050/4524274187_4df59da4de_o.png"">
She did have some issues with the mascot.  What a cow, picking fights with our girl in mourning.  Haha.  Cow.  ....yeah, I know, I'm lame.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4068/4524903350_422bbf3b67_o.png"">
Orlie's having none of that.  No one messes with his girl.  So he fights back with the cow...

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4037/4524274365_169e31af9b_o.png"">
...which leads to an all out brawl with the thing.  Aww, look at Etoile, so worried about her man.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4032/4524903526_fc6f405d20_o.png"">
Which I suppose she was right to do, because he lost.  Not only did he get beat up by a girl.  Not only did he get beat up by someone dressed up as a cow, but he got his ass kicked by a girl dressed up as a cow.  Poor Orlie.  How is he going to establish his manhood now?

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4009/4524274507_62c74b6b01_o.png"">
Well, that's one way.  And not in bed, like pussy, either.  Nice.  

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4025/4524903666_619e593c9c_o.png"">
Though, all that rough, spontaneous sex has its consequences.  Etoile's pregnant!

And that's it for this week!  I need to play a little bit more, but I don't know who to choose as my heirs.  I'm doing double heirs, because I'm already having trouble choosing two out of three, let alone one out of three.  The running is between Etoile, Faith, and Gracelyn.  Votes as to who should be heir?

Oh, stats for the youngest girls!

Alright, let me know who you like!  And we'll see you next time!

<lj-cut text=""And away we go!"">

Now, I'm having trouble with the storybook narrative that I've been using, so this time, I've decided to just caption the pics in a regular, commentary style.  As <lj user=""simsforaranya""> said, it'd be better to switch the style than to not update at all.  I might end up switching back next time, but for now, we're going with regular captions.  Hope that's okay with everyone!

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4007/4488477784_94075a1601_o.png"">
First off, we send Edward to off college, and we send his girlfriend, Christina, with him.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4025/4487829113_8d9005d302_o.png"">
In case you've forgotten her, here she is.  She's kind of pretty.  She'll do for him. Haha.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4002/4488478004_808913d2db_o.png"">
And now we get down to work.  I immediately sit him down to do his term paper, which he finishes in one go, because he hasn't had time to lose any fun yet.  Christina had to wait until he was done, so it took her a couple of tries.  Also, I played this part AGES ago, so I can't remember what either of them chose for their major.  :(  Sorry.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4056/4488478394_97042bdb39_o.png"">
And I made him do his assignments too.  I know it's cheating, but he's not my heir anyway, so I don't care--as soon as they've both filled their education meters, I send them off to their exam.   I hate college.  It takes way too long, and it's annoying as hell, and I do what I have to do for them, but for non-heirs?  They get the absolute minimum.  Sorry, Eddie.  I just don't love you as much as the others. :X

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4003/4488478300_74b923a7e4_o.png"">
I think that, out of all the skills Sims have to learn, charisma is my least favourite, but he needed it for whatever major he picked, so I put him to work here too, after doing the term paper and the homework and going to class.  This boy is going to be prepared, dammit.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2708/4487829261_6ea61bd40e_o.png"">
And after all that is done, Coach comes around to scream at him for not doing enough work.  Poor thing.  He can't catch a break!

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4050/4487829389_fa51b2ebfa_o.png"">
So I decided, why the hell not?  A little more work won't kill him!  Give'em fifty, Eddie!

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2720/4487830465_f2ab71712b_o.png"">
Coach came back for Christina next, but as soon as she saw him, she burst into tears, and got the hell out of there as quickly as humanly possible.  That's the way to do it, Chrissie!  When in the presence of one of the most macho types of men in the world, just do the girliest thing you can think of to make him uncomfortable--cry.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4007/4487829633_6d54f0c7de_o.png"">
But it isn't all work in this household.  These two can't do anything without farting hearts over each other every five seconds.  But they do look really cute when they're feeding each other.  

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4037/4488478596_e1bbc7eba7_o.png"">
I hate autonomous pillow fighting, but Edward just looks so happy, I couldn't make them stop.  

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2776/4487829837_8577552d3f_o.png"">
They're all about making out.  Every spare second they have, they're making out or flirting with each other.  ACR is running overtime with these two.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2768/4488478776_b4424987e4_o.png"">
They get a little couch time...

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4035/4488478910_068cc3016a_o.png"">
Some time in bed...

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4029/4488479014_92445cf6f5_o.png"">
And a little more time on the couch.  It's incredible that she didn't get pregnant.  I checked after every time they woohooed.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4038/4488479110_8c08e4f28e_o.png"">
He even paints pictures of her when she's not around.  He's a liiiiiiiiittle bit obsessed.  

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2739/4488479236_62a7120ca2_o.png"">
For some reason, I thought this was an engagement picture.  I don't know why.  But it was already uploaded, so....bonus pic of Ed and Christina!

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4063/4487830565_502130a52d_o.png"">
And, before we leave college for now, we part with a shot of the dancing professor.  The hot dancing professor, I might add.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4027/4487830687_4911714db7_o.png"">
Now we head over to Deandra and Chester's place to see what's up with everyone here. And we find Dee and Tyler swapping sex stories.  Or cursing their respective husbands for getting them pregnant.  You decide.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2752/4487830805_06335f0ef2_o.png"">
Since Tyler and Deandra are both on maternity leave, they both get babysitting duties.  Tyler spends more of his time playing with the girls when they're off.  He's such a good daddy/uncle.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4070/4487831111_fbcf816b4d_o.png"">
I don't have any baby pictures, because all baby pictures are the same.  Toddler pictures are a lot more interesting.  This is Ford, Tyler and Chester's son.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2692/4487830945_bc86a77b3a_o.png"">
And this is Bentley, Dee and Aaron's son.  Look at these two, so cute!  And look how dominant the Veilleux genes are!  You can still see a bit of Julien in Ford, and Kathleen's genes are still really strong in Bentley.  

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4067/4487831243_7d0b7537f0_o.png"">
Aww, poor Bentley.  He doesn't have confidence in his own artwork.  Do I sense future emo-nesss in our little cutie?

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4051/4487831323_fa511371b5_o.png"">
Maybe not.  He certainly looks happy now.  He and Abby are so cute together.  If they were the same age, I'd think they were twins.  They do have different stats though, so at least I know that they're not clones.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4021/4487831441_4ee1059e07_o.png"">
He and Ford are super close too.  Awwww, so cute!  They look so happy together.  Barely out of the womb, and they're already best friends.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2713/4487831577_2a185ea9ab_o.png"">
Bree grew up!  She is a beautiful teen.  I absolutely love her.  Makes me wish she wasn't adopted...or part of the non-heir family, because yeah, gorgeous.  

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4050/4488480578_2a31c75df8_o.png"">
Her first day out in teendom, and she's already macking on her classmates.  Interesting choice of prey.  I must say, I approve.  

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2754/4488480866_cd53afd73b_o.png"">
She likes the older ladies too.  She's a romance sim, so this doesn't surprise me at all.  She's trying to sink her claws into as many ladies as she possibly can.  And doing a pretty good job of it so far.  No woman can resist her.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4023/4487831895_b0456dc2b2_o.png"">
Hot maid alert!  Just thought I'd throw that in.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4008/4488480976_dcd2924448_o.png"">
Abigail is a teenager!  And like I said, the dominant genes are crazy awesome.  Part of me does wish I'd chosen Deandra as my heir, because I love that Kathleen's genes are still so strong, three generations later.  I don't think I've ever had that before.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2789/4488481094_2dcaeafc73_o.png"">
Solaris is beautiful too!  Of course she looks a lot like Etoile, so of course she is. 

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2721/4488481214_fa8a8783cf_o.png"">
Ford grew into a child!

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4057/4488481376_86b35d7267_o.png"">
And so did Bentley!  It's a horrible picture of him.  I've since learned not to do makovers at mirrors above sinks, at least for kids, because they turn out like this.  But he's still really cute.  They both are.  

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2685/4487832633_b9321532b5_o.png"">
Even as kids, they're still the best of friends.  They do everything together.  It's so cute how inseparable they are.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4028/4488481584_89d6cec568_o.png"">
And we leave the household with a parting shot of Bree being adorable while playing with leaves.  I love her so much.  

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2740/4487827255_8f1cc8c723_o.png"">
We finally move back to the main house, and join Etoile, who's flirting it up with a new guy.  I don't remember what happened to the other dude.  Gordon, I think his name was?  Meh, doesn't matter.  The only guy she wants now is this one.  This is Orlando, apparently her one true love.  He is a cutie, I have to admit.  He can stay for now.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4002/4488476152_cb93eee242_o.png"">
We have toddlers!  This is Gracelyn....

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4014/4488476236_5d347a1573_o.png"">
And this is Hallie.  I love that Gracelyn's still got Julien's eyes.  She's already a front-runner for heir because of that.  Let's hope she'll have the personality to match those beautiful eyes.  Hallie's cute too.  Her skintone is a little weird though.  Not sure I like it.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4043/4488476342_114b2fda90_o.png"">
Almost immediately after transitioning, Hallie crawls into Whisker's old bed and falls asleep.  So cute!  I didn't even know that this was possible, but I love it.  Oh, the cute things toddlers can do.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4006/4488477498_ea1d01bf7f_o.png"">
Speaking of, I love when they do this too.  Apparently Deme and Starla and Etoile are all too busy to feed the girls, so they've got to find their own source of nourishment.  I wonder how long that cat food's been there.  Does dry cat food go bad?  Who knows?  Either way, she seems to like it.  Gracelyn's just waiting for her turn.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2801/4487828101_7249df5f58_o.png"">
More birthdays!  Finn, the preppy geek...

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4039/4488476786_6028a196de_o.png"">
and Faith, who turned out to be gorgeous.  She's a front-runner too, for heir.  So far, it's between her, Etoile and Gracelyn.  I still don't know who's going to win.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4003/4487827661_13608d4241_o.png"">
Here we have a rare moment where Etoile is actually by herself, and not all over Orlando.  Cherish it.  You won't see another moment like this for a long time.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4014/4488476538_a24d10b363_o.png"">
The second they get off the school bus, they're making out.  Orlando is there every day.  If he doesn't come home with her from school, she rolls a want to invite him over.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4064/4488476684_4152921ca9_o.png"">
She lets him cop a feel too, and definitely seems to love it.  She's certainly no angel, our Etoile.  And that's just the way we like her.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2732/4487828207_2263b8d7b5_o.png"">
Awww, look at them; they're so cute, all going-steady-like.  They're so in love.  

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2753/4488477234_64be19e158_o.png"">
WTF?!  I did not authorize this!  Damn ACR!  Or Inteen, whichever it was.  And where the hell are Deme and Starla?  Letting their daughter's boyfriend not only sleep over, but in her bed?!  With her?!

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4069/4487828539_53ffcac183_o.png"">
Well...isn't this awkward.  Eating breakfast with your boyfriend and your little sister and brother, who'd probably heard every moment of the sex they'd had the night before, probably isn't the most comfortable morning after for her.  Maybe...maybe next time don't bring your boyfriend to breakfast.  Might make it a little bit easier on you.  

><img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2725/4488481730_8e07b6f55a_o.png"">
And on said little brother.  He clearly was not happy about having to hear them woohoo all night.  Poor Finn.  He's been scarred for life now.  Not that Etoile cares.  She's still flying high on her last orgasm to be affected by his anger.  All she can think about is the next time they're going to do it.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4009/4488477678_96e02dc643_o.png"">
One more set of birthdays!  Hallie grew up into a cute child, though the skin tone is still bugging me.  Maybe it'll get better with age.  If I knew which one it was, I'd probably delete it, so that she'd go back to a default skin, but I don't know which one it is.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2800/4488477588_4d503c832c_o.png"">
And Gracelyn.  Yep, still a frontrunner.  She's so freaking cute!

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4012/4488481872_a10cc66c37_o.png"">
We interrupt our Etoile coverage to bring you a small disaster.  This is what happens when you start cooking and then forget about the food because you're too busy getting it on with your spouse.  These two are ridiculous.  Definitely made for each other, that's for sure.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4045/4488482000_2589dee917_o.png"">
Even in the middle of a crisis, Starla can't help but stop to swoon over Demetrius.  Um, Starla?  Your husband definitely will be hot if the fire fighter can't take care of things.  As in, he'll be on fire.  So rather than swoon all over him, why don't you, you know, try to get him to safety?  No?  Alright, carry on then.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2707/4488482166_c11dc9681f_o.png"">
And now back to Etoile.  That's....cute.  Nice, Etoile.  What would Orlando think if he saw you eating from the garbage can?

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4061/4487833505_3fd9a574e7_o.png"">
Well....let's just hope he didn't see it.  If he did, and he wants to kiss her like this?  Well, at least we can definitely say that they're a perfect match.  There wouldn't be any doubt then.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4064/4488482494_bde4258162_o.png"">
And we close out this update with Etoile getting in the cab to head off to college!  Orlando's going with her, so I'm sure they'll spend more time sexing than studying, but that's a story for another time.

And that's it for this update!  Sorry it's been so long since the last update.  It took me about a week to write this.  Hopefully I'll get better at this updating thing in the future.  

Oh!  And one more thing: stats!

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4035/4487833863_b76aa7d446_o.png"">
<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4067/4487833787_cdfc872a5c_o.png"">

And <i>now</i> that's it.  See you next time!

This year, as in, since January 1st?  I haven't seen very many movies this year, so I guess I'm going to have to say...maybe the Princess and the Frog?  I've always loved Disney, and this one didn't disappoint me.  I liked the music and the animation, and the story was pretty cute.  I don't think it was as good as The Little Mermaid or Aladdin or Beauty and the Beast back in the day, but it was good.  I'm glad I watched it.

The best song is a little bit harder to choose, because I don't listen to the radio, so I don't know if I've heard any actually knew songs since January.  I've been too caught up in listening to my SModcasts.  But um...I guess Telephone by Lady Gaga?  That's the only song that really comes to mind as a new song.  So...yeah, there's my pick.

Most of the books I've read this year so far have been really good.  I really like the Fablehaven series.  The last book comes out next week!  I can't wait to get it.  I love stories about fairies and mythical creatures and stuff.  Awesome.  The book I'm reading right now though, is really good too, so it's definitely a contender.  I'm reading Ash by Malinda Lo, and it's basically a lesbian Cinderella story, but instead of her falling for the prince, she falls for the king's huntress.  I'm about two-thirds through it, and I love it."

No, I'm not celebrating this year.  Actually, I almost never do.  I think I went out once when I was in college, but I didn't stay out long because the bars were so ridiculously full that it just wasn't fun. 

I'm not a drinker, so St.Patrick's Day doesn't really appeal to me the way it would to people who like to celebrate the holiday.  Though actually,part of me does like the excitement of all things green. I do wish I'd worn green today, but I just hadn't remembered.  I would also like to go the kiddie route and buy shamrock and leprochaun stickers and stuff to put on my stock checks.  Haha.  But again, I forgot, so whatever.  It doesn't bother me that much.  

I don't really associate many memories with this holiday.  In public school and high school, we were always off this week for March Break, and then once I got older, I never went out anyway.  So it's pretty much just another day for me.  Well, that's not exactly true.  My friend's birthday is today.  So it's not so much St.Patrick's day for me.  It's Krystal's birthday.  That's always been much more important to me.

Happy birthday Krystal!"

I am so bad at updating this thing.  Haha.  Since the last update, I've bought a PS3 and started catching up on Desperate Housewives, along with all the other weekly shows I watch, but that's not a good excuse for not updating.  Sorry, guys.  I'm just a ridiculous procrastinator.  lol.  But here I am with another update, and hopefully after this, I'll update more often.  For real this time.  Lol.  I can't really play until I update at least once more after this, because I still don't know who to pick to be my heirs.  But we'll get there when we get there.  For now, on with the show!

My family was doing quite well, my kids growing much too quickly for my tastes, but we were happy.  Meanwhile, across town...

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4054/4239409233_0e0ae9673b_o.png"">
My cousin Chester and his boyfriend Tyler moved into a place together, along with my sister, Deandra.  Chester and Tyler were still just as much in love as they'd always been.  It was something I'd missed seeing around the house since Chester had moved out, seeing the two of them together.  They were so cute.  I was glad they'd decided to build a life together.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2535/4240182820_4d82b80f1d_o.png"">
Deandra, too, was seeing someone.  Aaron was a nice guy, and Deandra really seemed to like him.  She'd had a few boyfriends in high school, but she'd always been the sort of girl more interested in having fun than in finding love. 

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2522/4239409439_4ca80dfca2_o.png"">
And, well, clearly she was still interested in having fun.  But I think she'd met her match in Aaron.  I don't think I'd ever seen her fall more quickly or deeply in love with a man as she did with Aaron, and he'd seemed just as smitten.  I was so happy for them. 

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2504/4240183532_9f56c0a03a_o.png"">
<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4065/4239410209_b9844bb8a2_o.png"">
It wasn't long after that, that they got married.  It'd been a quick courtship, but everyone knew how happy they were together and how good they were together.  So we were all happy when they got married.  

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2669/4239409803_4bfde177c4_o.png"">
<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4014/4239409949_06f937d976_o.png"">
And actually, it was a double wedding!  Chester and Tyler got married that day too, so there was double the cause for celebration.  This was back before Mom and Aunt Ronnie passed away.  Just looking back on these pictures and remembering these happy times brings a smile to my face whenever I find myself missing my parents and aunt and uncle.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2697/4240183774_aa9f0167a1_o.png"">
<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4042/4240183886_29be52880b_o.png"">
Two wedding cakes, two very happy couples, and lots of champagne and other alcohol made for a very awesome wedding reception.  It was a great time.  It'd been much more extravagant than the tiny little ceremony that Starla and I had had, but we were happy for my sister and my cousin.  It was a great party, and we were all very happy to celebrate them.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2510/4240183988_a2e4eae652_o.png"">
Soon two limos had shown up, and it was time for both pairs of love birds to be off on their respective honeymoons.  The rest of us partied late into the evening and then cleaned up the next day, among killer hangovers.  Champagne is not the kindest form of alcohol when it comes to hangovers the next day, let me tell you.  Haha.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2715/4239409581_30da557771_o.png"">
Chester has always been a knowledgeable guy, so he'd always been curious about the stars and space beyond our planet.  And, just like me, our far-away friends really took a liking to him.  They tend to 'borrow' the smarter of Earth's inhabitants, and Chester apparently made the list.  Ever since I'd been 'borrowed' a couple of years earlier, Chester had been looking to get abducted, himself.  Finally, he'd gotten his wish.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4007/4240183098_0a77242bb4_o.png"">
But, despite apparently wanting the abduction to happen, he was still pretty freaked out about the whole thing when they'd dropped him off several hours later, though he'd never admit it to anyone.  I think only I could truly understand what it was he was going through in that moment, so it was I who helped him through the ordeal.  It was I who helped him deal with the knowledge that a little green baby was growing inside of him.  

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2618/4239410827_6326b517ae_o.png"">
In time, he learned to accept and love this miracle child as I loved my own Etoile.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2520/4239410687_f9d603cb55_o.png"">
Before long, Deandra started showing too.  I was going to be an uncle!

In what seemed like no time, Solaris and Abigail were not only born, but they were growing so big!  Abigail was a beautiful little girl, and Solaris looked so much like my Etoile, I wondered if there was some other connection between them besides the fact that they were second cousins.  Maybe their 'fathers' were one and the same.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4035/4240184572_41858a1e50_o.png"">
Abigail and Solaris were second cousins, but they grew up more like sisters, like twins.  They were best friends.  They did everything together.  It was so cute.  They were just as close to each other as Faith and Finn were.  

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4038/4239411331_af0e679310_o.png"">
Their Chester and Tyler were great parents, as were Dee and Aaron, though there were definitely times when they got frustrated with things.  I understood those feelings completely.  Still, it was great to see the love shared between parents and children.  

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4001/4239411421_fd3843f537_o.png"">
<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2539/4240184940_cab4a4171c_o.png"">
But everyone did need their time to themselves.  Chester played with his ant farm.  Aaron fiddled around with the computer.  Dee and Tyler had their hobbies too.  They all loved the kids, but sometimes they'd needed to just get away from their responsibilities.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2798/4239411553_c7fdc63197_o.png"">
Still, all four of them loved the kids dearly, and for Chester, one daughter wasn't enough.  Although Tyler loved Solaris like she was his own, the two of them wanted a child that was theirs together.  So Chester called up the adoption agency...

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4031/4239411687_b4d7e3852e_o.png"">
<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4072/4239411781_a20eb5e95e_o.png"">
And little Bree came into their lives.  She was an adorable little girl.  Her parents had been killed in a car accident a few years earlier, and she'd spent the time since then in an orphanage.  Most couples looking to adopt wanted a baby, but Tyler and Chester just wanted to give a child a home, and Bree was perfect for them.  She was a bright child, full of life, and Chester and Tyler and everyone else in the house loved her completely.  She and Tyler were especially close.  They'd spent a lot of time together.  She'd made life in the family that much happier.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2794/4240185306_d6a1dab303_o.png"">
<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2506/4240185412_803f7f4d7d_o.png"">
And that family was about to grow even more.  Both Tyler and Dee were pregnant!  Dee and Aaron were so excited for another child, and Tyler and Chester were ecstatic.  This would be their first child that would be biologically a part of both of them.  It was definitely cause for celebration.  We'd heard rumours over the years that men were able to get pregnant with other men, and women with women, but none of us had ever seen it in our community, so this was big news, and word spread quickly.  It was incredible.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4040/4240185710_c28967fc77_o.png"">
Soon Solaris had grown into beautiful little girls.  Solaris looked so much like Etoile, it was clear that they shared DNA, and Abby looked so much like Dee.  Looking at her was like looking at my memories of Dee when we were kids.  I knew she'd grow up to be a beautiful young lady.  I was a very proud uncle.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2787/4396980979_43baa7cc5f_o.png"">
<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2785/4396981117_c7c07c2699_o.png"">
Things here at home weren't so great.  One of Edward's friends was scared to death by one of the many ghosts roaming the property.  It was such a tragedy, someone so young, dying right in front of Edward's eyes.  I couldn't imagine what the boy's family must've been going through.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4054/4396981227_3e14ac7dba_o.png"">
But Edward was my chief concern.  He was devastated, not only mourning the loss of one of his friends but also because he'd felt so guilty about what had happened.  It'd happened right in our house, by a ghost roaming our property.  He'd felt like it was his fault that his friend had died.  It'd taken a lot of talking, a lot of comforting, and a lot of therapy to get him through that ordeal.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4065/4396981965_e8cb2baf81_o.png"">
The younger kids really helped him get through it all too.  He loved his siblings, and they provided lot of distraction for him when they played together.  They never failed to bring a smile to his face.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4056/4396981301_6cd44804ec_o.png"">
Which was understandable, because they were so cute.  They brought a smile to everyone's face, whenever anyone looked at them.  My babies were adorable, and so full of happiness.  All of my kids had been happy babies.  I was definitely a lucky dad.  

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4024/4397747926_a1b33f3186_o.png"">
<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2793/4397747996_7e27a5016b_o.png"">
Of course, when they were crying and screaming, sometimes it was a little bit more difficult to remember how lucky I was.  They were generally happy babies, but man, did they each have a set of pipes.  When they were upset, they didn't have any trouble letting everyone in the house know about it.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2756/4396981613_d90d39f4b2_o.png"">
Sometimes when they were upset, all it took to make them feel better was a hug and some comfort.  I always felt so good when I was able to make them feel better.  It made me feel like a better dad.

Etoile was getting older now too, old enough to be able to help take care of the toddlers, and she was a natural at it.  And she loved taking care of them.  I was so proud that my kids were so close to each other.  I mean, it wasn't like I didn't get along with Bastian, but he was so much older than me, so we never really got the chance to get as close as I'd have wanted.  And the same went with my older cousins too.  It looked, so far, like my kids would be really close, and that made me happy.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2573/4396982281_9975287a55_o.png"">
Etoile was good to everyone in the family, and everyone loved her.  I was so proud of my baby girl.  As a child, she'd gone through a lot, being teased by the kids at school because of her background and the way she was conceived, but growing up, she'd never let any of that bother her too much.  She'd grown up one of the kindest, most thoughtful teenagers I'd ever known.  She was definitely a daughter any father would be lucky to have.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4058/4397748710_49154874c5_o.png"">
<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2754/4396982655_a15a20c6a3_o.png"">
Finn and Faith were growing up so quickly too!  I couldn't believe it when their first day of school rolled around.  I'd still remembered the day they were born as if it were yesterday.  And now they were old enough to go to school.  My kids were growing up so fast!  

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4010/4396982783_5cfac712db_o.png"">
<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2529/4396982905_d53c81b1fb_o.png"">
They'd started hanging out with Bree and Solaris and Abigail too, now that they were all in school together.  Bree was a little bit older than the rest of them, but the five of them all got along so well together.  The three of them often came home from school with Finn and Faith, and they would all play together until it got dark.  It was a really good thing for them, plus, it gave me a chance to see Chester and Dee when they came to pick the kids up, or when I went to drop them off.  It was the perfect situation.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4064/4397749176_8b87bfcaed_o.png"">
Etoile met someone at school too, a boy named Gordon.  They hit it off instantly, and after that, they were nearly inseparable.  

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2702/4396983129_a74ecb8921_o.png"">
And after that, it didn't take long for their relationship to go to the next level.  Actually, Etoile got her first kiss before Edward did, something that she didn't let him forget when they were fighting.  

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2749/4397749398_f97b0a1a70_o.png"">
But that didn't mean that he didn't get attention of his own from the girls from school.  Cassiopeia, who lived a couple of blocks away from us, had a bit of a crush on Edward.  She was a sweet girl, and one of Etoile's friends.   I don't think Etoile liked that her friend liked her brother.  

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4060/4396983373_3656348c45_o.png"">
But she had nothing to worry about, because Edward only had eyes for Christina.  And she liked him too.  She was a sweet girl, and Edward was completely head over heels for her.  Of course, Etoile didn't want to picture her brother with anyone, but if he was going to have a girlfriend, at least it wasn't one of her friends.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2715/4396983485_46e5243240_o.png"">
And pretty soon she was his girlfriend!  Now Etoile had nothing to tease her brother about.  

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2739/4397749782_361aa16082_o.png"">
Meanwhile, Starla had started feeling sick in the mornings, and after two births for her and one for me, we both knew the signs pretty well.  She was pregnant again!  Apparently four kids weren't enough for us.  Haha.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4014/4396983795_6d124901ce_o.png"">
It was probably a good thing that we were going to have another baby, because Uncle Adder and some of the other ghosts seemed determined to claim our other kids.  Thankfully, there were no tragedies, although Faith had nightmares couldn't sleep by herself for quite awhile after that scare.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2705/4397750204_91cba05039_o.png"">
Death did come to claim one of the family though.  Whiskers was getting quite old when Grim came to take him away.  It was difficult, losing him.  The kids were all devastated.  They'd all grown up with him.

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4052/4397750284_beae01b3f6_o.png"">
No one took it worse than Edward though.  Whiskers' death had made Edward very angry.  He seemed to be full of rage all the time.

<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2779/4397750402_09383e78d6_o.png"">
<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2725/4396984311_4afb81f1bc_o.png"">
There were times when he was downright mean.  He ruined the girls' dollhouse, seemingly on purpose.  We were very worried about him.  

<img src=""http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4057/4396984453_9d931f3835_o.png"">
<img src=""http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2698/4397750726_08954d999b_o.png"">
Eventually, that rage went away, thankfully, probably partially due to the birth of two more siblings: Gracelyn, who had my green eyes and my black hair, and Hallie, who had her mother's blue eyes and red hair.  Two more babies!  I had six kids!  How the hell was I going to be able to handle six kids?!

Notes:
--I'm sorry this update was so shittastic.  One of the reasons why it was so crappy and why it's been so long since the last update is because I'm having trouble with the narrative.  I had even more trouble with it this time than before.  I just couldn't fit anything together properly.  Part of me wants to just abandon it and switch to caption style, but I know that some of you like it the way it is, and I don't want to give up on it too easily, so I'll try to stick it out.  So I'm sorry it's all over the place.  I'll try to do better next time.

--There is a reason why I put Chester and Deandra and their families in the update!  I know it was kind of out of left field, but there is a reason, I swear!  You'll see later on.

"event","Seriously.  Dr. Oliver doesn't want to see them together at the hospital, so that means that they can't be together at all?  Even outside of the hospital, where the doctor can't even see them?  WTF?  Hello.  And he's threatening to quit giving Noah the therapy because they're living together, and because Luke just sometimes happens to be at the hospital?  

OMG, I hate this guy, and I hate the writing right now.  Ridiculous.  

It just drives me crazy that one second, Noah's like, ""I need space.  I can't see you at all.""  And then the next second he's like, ""Tell me what's wrong, Luke.  You know you can tell me anything.""  Mixed signals much?  Just once, I'd love to see a storyline where Noah is fighting for Luke, not the other way around.  Noah is always the one pushing Luke away, and Luke is always fighting for Noah and screwing things up. 

Maybe once Noah has his eyesight back, there will finally be some sort of storyline where the tables are turned.  We can always hope.  Then maybe we can see that Noah actually loves Luke as much as Luke loves Noah.  We so rarely get to see that, and I think it is so frustrating."

Though it seemed like she had come into this world just a short time ago, Etoile grew quickly into a beautiful little toddler.  

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3543/3472247937_ac30cd46cb_o.png"">
And not only was she the cutest thing I'd ever seen, but she was good-tempered and smart and loved to play and learn new things.  She was my little genius!

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3003/3473055728_b56ebf701c_o.png"">
When I'd first been released from alien captivity with the knowledge that I was going to bear alien spawn, I had been so afraid of the outcome.  What would happen when I finally gave birth?  Would I even make it through the delivery?  And what would it mean to raise an alien baby, assuming I did make it past the birthing process.  But it didn't take me long to realize that I'd had nothing to worry about.  She was just like any other baby, except that she looked a little bit different.  That didn't matter though.  Etoile was my unique little angel, and I loved her very, very much.  

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3562/3472248203_8b188814a9_o.png"">
Everyone loved her.  Everyone was still upset over the loss of my mom and Uncle Adder, but Etoile made life a little bit easier to bear for everyone.  Not only that, but I'd learned a few things during my time with the aliens too, and I used that knowledge to try to make life a little bit easier for the family.  

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3628/3473056028_402a4a59fb_o.png"">
For instance, a baby formula that enabled Etoile (and, I'm assuming, any other toddler) to concentrate better on some tasks.  She learned how to walk in no time.  And potty training?  Barely took any time at all.  

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3647/3472248449_532696e034_o.png"">
Aunt Ronnie absolutely loved that formula, since she'd been the one to teach Eoile most of her skills.  Starla and I were away at work for much of the day, so Ronnie spent most of the time with Etoile.  She often mentioned that she'd wished that she'd had that formula when my cousins and siblings and I were kids.  Maybe we'd all be smarter for it today, if she had had it back then.  Haha.  

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3601/3473056300_80860525aa_o.png"">
Ronnie wasn't the only one finding success.  Starla was making her way up the political ladder quickly.  I was so proud of her.  She was really proud of herself too.  She was getting more and more sway in the office too.  Pretty soon she'd be able to make real changes in the way life was lived in the city.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3370/3472248805_784bc701ce_o.png"">
Edward, however, wasn't doing as well in school.  He was trying, but he just didn't seem able to grasp some of the concepts he was taught.  In fact, it got so bad for awhile there, that he was put into some special classes where he could get the attention he needed, to help him with his studies.  Everyone at home helped him too, thinking up creative ways to teach concepts he'd need throughout his life.  And slowly, gradually, his grades started to get better.  We were all so proud of him when he brought home his first A.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3605/3473056606_98d6220602_o.png"">
Tragedy struck soon again though, when Dad passed away.  It just seemed to come out of nowhere!  It took us all by surprise.  We were all so shocked at first.  No one could believe that he was really gone.  I can't tell you how many times I turned around, expecting him to be sitting on the couch or at the table or coming into the room and being faced with nothing but the realization that none of that would happen anymore.  My dad was gone, and he wasn't coming back.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3414/3473056732_5875e61322_o.png"">
<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3324/3472249243_3c094d93e6_o.png"">
We were all devastated.  My dad, who had been such a force of life, such a positive influence on everyone, was gone.  For weeks, there was barely a smile in the house.  I think we all lost a part of ourselves when we lost my father.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3656/3473057036_16cc0907c6_o.png"">
<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3304/3472249531_51ec927f01_o.png"">
The kids were the ones who'd ultimately helped us through the grief we all felt.  They were just so alive and filled with love and passion for life.  So full of smiles.  When we looked at them, we were able to...not forget what we had lost, but remember what we all still had to live for.  There were still good things in the world, despite the loss of my father.  My children showed me that.  They really were the greatest gift I could have asked for.  

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3396/3473057338_61777bf723_o.png"">
And Aunt Ronnie still had some fire in her.  Even though Uncle Adder had been gone for some time, Aunt Ronnie didn't let her grudges fade away.  Even though Uncle Adder had been gone for awhile, she still got angry every time one of his old conquests came around.  I felt a little bit bad for those women, actually.  Sometimes Ronnie just liked picking fights.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3543/3472249911_302fe01708_o.png"">
It was great to watch the kids together.  Despite the fact that there were so many years between them, they loved each other very much.  Etoile loved singing with Edward.  He taught her how to sing a nursery rhyme, and after that, she was always singing it and asking him to sing with her.   It was really cute.  Edward was a really great big brother to her.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3570/3472250051_e74ff16af1_o.png"">
<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3358/3472250243_f6ff7d825e_o.png"">
It wasn't long later though, that we had a fourth tragedy in the house.  One peaceful spring weekend, Grim snuck up on us and took Aunt Ronnie away from us.  

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3572/3472250411_62e0d96341_o.png"">
<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3407/3472250567_38a89ebab2_o.png"">
Once again, we were all devastated.  We were all just growing accustomed to living live without Dad, and now we had to live without Aunt Ronnie too.  It was extremely hard on all of us.  Even Etoile, one of the happiest toddlers I'd ever known, was inconsolable.  Aunt Ronnie had been like a grandmother to her.  She was young, but she knew what was going on.  She'd known that Aunt Ronnie wasn't coming back.  It was difficult for her to get over the loss.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3642/3473058496_49b12cba11_o.png"">
Life went on though, and before long, Etoile was old enough to attend school.  She was so excited.  She'd always wanted to go to school with Edward when she was younger, and now she was finally able to.  Her first report card hadn't been the greatest, but she turned it around quickly after that.  My Etoile was one smart cookie.  I was so proud of her.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3664/3472250907_3c0ab3c26e_o.png"">
I was proud of both of my kids.  Edward was growing up into a respectable young man.  He was doing well in school too now, and the fact that he worked hard for his grades made him a favourite with all of his teachers.  Who wouldn't be proud to have a son like my Edward?

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3617/3472251065_d77bd29955_o.png"">
There was other happy news too.  Starla was pregnant again!  It was a difficult pregnancy for her, with a lot of morning sickness, but we were both very happy and very excited at the thought of a new baby.  Edward and Etoile were excited too.  We couldn't wait for the baby to be born.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3301/3472251223_bb865fcf09_o.png"">
This picture really doesn't have much of a point.  I just wanted to show off my beautiful wife.  How lucky am I, that I get to be married to someone as beautiful as her?  

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3377/3473059096_8ec0d5e2a4_o.png"">
And there was more happy news as well.  After a long, grueling campaign, Starla was elected mayor of the town.  This was her dream come true!  Or well, one of them, anyway.  She'd always hoped to be able to make a difference in the community, and now she was able to.  Up until now, the town had had very strict building codes, restricting the size of permanent residences.  With a bill that she proposed though, she was able to eliminate that restriction.  That really changed things in the Veilleux house.  Up until now, we'd always lived a very, very cramped lifestyle because of these restrictions, but now we were able to build onto our house and spread out more.  It was wonderful.  My wife really did change things for the better.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3351/3472251535_891ec785ac_o.png"">
<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3366/3473059384_c1bf503c04_o.png"">
Things weren't all great in the Veilleux household though.  The ghosts around the house were getting restless, and they spent all night every night haunting us.  It was frightening.  Edward was the one affected the most by all the hauntings.  I think he was a little bit traumatized by it all.  He lost a lot of sleep because of those damn ghosts.  But try as we might, we just didn't know how to get rid of them.  

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3608/3472251803_798408da5c_o.png"">
But we just dealt with them as best we could, and eventually they quieted down again.  Things grew more peaceful for us as a family.  Family dinners were common place for us.  It was really nice to sit down with everyone and talk and share with each other the goings on of the day.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3583/3473059786_1864953917_o.png"">
Starla and Edward spent the most time together.  Now that she was the mayor, she didn't have to spend quite so much time at the office, so she was able to spend a lot more time at home, which was good, since this pregnancy had been very hard on her.  Edward helped out a lot around the house, doing little every day tasks here and there so that his mother wouldn't have to, and I knew that she appreciated it.  I just loved to watch the two of them together.  They really had a close bond with each other.  It's not often you see that kind of bond between a mother and her teenage son, so I thought it made their relationship even more special.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3357/3472251951_6307e6659f_o.png"">
Etoile wasn't left out though.  She was still one of the happiest children in the world.  She and Whiskers were best friends.  Etoile spent a lot of time with him, giving him lots of love and teaching him tricks.  She was definitely his favourite in the household.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3596/3472252225_f95cce8e14_o.png"">
Soon the happy day arrived!  Starla gave birth to a beautiful baby boy named Finn.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3414/3473060012_0dffaeaf27_o.png"">
And a baby girl, we named Faith.  Twins!  Being a twin myself, I knew that these two would probably grow up the best of friends, just like Deandra and I were when we were growing up.  

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3393/3473060100_1f90b12a29_o.png"">
I was so happy with the newest additions to the family.  Our babies were so beautiful, so precious.  I knew that I would do anything for them, give my life for them, just as I would for Starla and for Edward and Etoile.  

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3587/3472252599_43d04db954_o.png"">
<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3340/3472252775_1dedfac0ae_o.png"">
I spent every day at work unable to wait to get home so that I could spend time with the babies.  I didn't even mind changing their diapers, which I'm sure made Starla happy, since it definitely wasn't her favourite chore.  I didn't mind though.  Every second I got to spend with them was precious.  I didn't want to miss a moment of their lives.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3363/3472253049_29f51e4d24_o.png"">
Edward and Etoile weren't ignored.  They had a lot of fun themselves.  Edward was a great older brother to Etoile, always showering her with attention and making her feel loved.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3348/3473061046_7b9c89bc08_o.png"">
Though sometimes he went a little overboard with the games.  

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3336/3472252917_86d2cb1180_o.png"">
Now that our family was growing, and Starla's hard work in changing building codes had been successful, we expanded the house a little bit.  It was nice to be able to spread out a little bit more.  My family and I loved each other, but we all needed space from time to time.  Now we've got it!

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3617/3473061174_410a4c3d5a_o.png"">
<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3633/3473061282_90ac7cd8ac_o.png"">
And of course, we really needed that space.  The babies were growing up so quickly!  Before we knew it, Faith and Finn were crawling around all over the place, getting into all sorts of trouble.  But we could never stay frustrated for long, not when they flashed their adorable little smiles.  I fully admit, they had be wrapped around their little fingers.  And I don't think there's anything wrong with that.

Notes:

--Once again, I'm really sorry that it's taken me so long to write another update.  I just got behind,and then I'd thought that I wouldn't continue because I'd be playing Sims 3 instead.  And then my computer died for probably about four or five months, so I had nothing until I got it fixed.  I've decided that you don't like Sims 3 though, because I think they're fugly as hell.  I can't get past it.  I wish I could, but I can't.  So I'm starting this back up again.  Hopefully this time I won't fade away again.

--Sorry for the crappy update.  I didn't know what to say for any of the pictures because I took them so long ago, and because it's been such a long while since I've posted anything like this.  I'll try harder next time.  I promise.

--I still have a ton more pictures to touch up and post, so hopefully that'll prompt me to post more often.  

--I hope everything makes sense.  I'm currently half asleep, so who knows if anything I've written actually makes any sense at all.  You tell me!

I really can't decide.  Gracelyn has the founder's eyes and I'd like to keep that going, but she'll be marrying a black-haired person, so there won't be too much diversity.  With Faith, she's got the red hair going for her.  I can't decide!  I really like Gracelyn.  I think she's one of the most beautiful sims I've ever had, but again with the diversity.  Help me!

<lj-cut text=""Remember these guys?  No?  'Kay, just checking.  Check them out anyway."">

Alright, so I realize it's been like, eight months since I've updated, but....I'm back!  Hehe.  The reason for my being gone is an eclectic mix of ridiculous computer troubles, losing my AL cd (thank God I'm able to use the Mansion and Garden SP), buying and being obsessed with all things Wii, borrowing my sister's Xbox 360 and being obsessed with Fable II, the fact that I watch WAY too many tv shows, which all started again, and just plain being lazy.  But I'm back!  And hopefully, I'll be able to crank things out with more regularity in the future.  Fingers crossed.  Anyway though, I....don't really remember much about what's happened in the past besides the fact that Demetrius was named heir and he's god an adorable girlfriend named Starla, who he's been dating since he was a teenager.  The other five kids have all either become townies, or, if I liked them enough, as in the case with Deandra and Chester, moved into a house across town.  

Now, shall we get started?  Alright!

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3584/3318994716_3b59abba73_o.png"">
Life was moving on.  My siblings and cousins had all moved out to start their own families, and I was all that was left of the ""kids"" in the house.  Well, that's not exactly true.  I asked Starla to move in, and she said yes!  She didn't have many possessions, but that was okay.  My family had possessions enough, and the money to buy more or less anything she wanted.  My parents and my aunt and uncle were just glad to have the addition to the family.  And I was so happy that my love wanted to be with me!

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3340/3318168665_f649340ee4_o.png"">
Life continued on.  Uncle Adder and Aunt Ronnie were getting along great again after Uncle Adder's little....tryst with his college ""friend.""  It'd taken a long time, but she'd finally forgiven him.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3652/3318169019_6148c3393d_o.png"">
<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3647/3318168873_0bc9a082a4_o.png"">
Mom and dad were both doing really well too.  Mom was still really into reading and learning everything she could, just like she'd always been, and Dad, well, he's always been a big kid.  I don't think that that'll ever change.  I hoped it wouldn't.  His playful and carefree attitude made him the man he is, and it was what had drawn serious Mom to him in the first place.  I hoped that Starla and I would have a relationship as loving and long-lasting as that of my parents.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3569/3318169143_9a444ce943_o.png"">
But first, I had to ask her to marry me!  I'd wanted to make it a special occasion, but one night, as we were getting ready for bed, I looked at her, and she was so beautiful, that I just couldn't wait a second longer.  So I got down one knee, right there by the bed, and asked her to be my wife.  She was so surprised.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3546/3318995498_9f31a59346_o.png"">
But she'd said yes!  I couldn't believe it.  I was so happy.  I immediately hugged her and spun her around in my arms, laughing joyously.  She was just as happy and excited.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3389/3318995668_555be35714_o.png"">
That night, we, uh, celebrated until the sun came up.  What a night!

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3121/3318995788_4f21b38fe3_o.png"">
Not too long after that, Starla began to feel sick, and she had no energy at all.  There were numerous times when I'd find her asleep on the couch in the middle of the day, and sometimes she even fell asleep standing up!  At first we'd thought she'd picked up a bug or that her job as a campaign manager was putting too much stress on her, but being a nurse and studying to become a doctor, it quickly became clear to me that she was pregnant.  Mom and Aunt Ronnie both agreed.  They remembered what it was like to be pregnant.  We were going to have a baby!

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3615/3318169787_57d655a238_o.png"">
<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3516/3318169995_9b7944c21e_o.png"">
So, as quickly as possible, Starla and I got married.  Starla had wanted the big day to come before she started to show, so that any pictures taken would show her before she ""packed on the pounds,"" as she'd said.  I told her that I would find her beautiful no matter how pregnant she was, but I wanted to give her what she wanted.  It was a beautiful little ceremony with just my parents and Aunt Ronnie and Uncle Adder.  And even though it was just a small, informal event, it was the happiest day of my life, and I knew that Starla felt the same way.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3442/3318996316_b38c845c02_o.png"">
<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3401/3318170301_9bda39d6fe_o.png"">
Her pregnancy was very difficult for her.  She just never had any energy for anything.  She wasn't able to take time off of work--none of us were--so by the time she got home, she was out.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3663/3318996638_9296082d8b_o.png"">
Aunt Ronnie thought that this was just hilarious.  I thought it was pretty rude of her to laugh at Starla like that, but Starla just shrugged it off with a little chuckle of her own.  ""She knows what it's like to be pregnant,"" she reasoned.  

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3406/3318170627_86c3a319cc_o.png"">
<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3325/3318996972_a08d749042_o.png"">
Life went on again, pretty much as normal, except that Starla was getting bigger, and more and more beautiful to me.  Dad and Uncle Adder were spending a lot of time together lately.  Joel was quite a bit older than Adder, so for a long time, they just didn't see eye to eye on a lot of things.  Now that they were both older though, they seemed to have a lot more in common.  They talked a lot about their youths, comparing stories and reminiscing about the days when their kids were small and growing up.  It was nice to see them spending so much time together.  

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3639/3318997106_7be3d02949_o.png"">
Aunt Ronnie insisted on painting a portrait of me since I was the heir of the family.  How could I say now?  And mom still spent a lot of time reading.  Everyone in the house was happy.  It was a very peaceful place, which was great for Starla, and just what she needed when she came home from a stressful day at work.  My parents and my aunt and uncle were always ready to get her anything she needed or to do anything for her.  I tried my best too, though I had to spend long hours at work.  Studying to be a doctor was hard work!

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3639/3318997256_50718263aa_o.png"">
We did spend lots of time together, as much as we could between both of our jobs and her waning energy.  When she did have enough energy, we'd play a game of catch or something active.  She was determined to stay somewhat active, or else she'd never get rid of the baby weight afterward, she said.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3355/3318997456_c63030537c_o.png"">
It was a very happy day in the household when Edward came into the world.  He was a beautiful baby, and he had Starla's eyes and her bright red hair.  He took my breath away, every time I looked at him.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3582/3318997654_e26aa16591_o.png"">
Starla was a wonderful mother, just as I'd known she'd be.  Everyone was great with him.  And with six adults in the house, Edward was very loved and never left wanting.  I have to admit, we all spoiled him quite a bit those first few months.  Mom and dad were thrilled to have a baby in the house, and so were Uncle Adder and Aunt Ronnie.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3452/3318998480_7f5722a38b_o.png"">
<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3362/3318172637_1732f5ae4f_o.png"">
Everyone loved Edward and just showered him with love and affection.  And he was growing so fast!  Deandra and I had been the youngest of our generation, but I definitely don't remember any of us kids growing as fast as Edward did.  One moment, he was a newborn, and the next, he was a toddler, effortlessly garnering attention wherever he went.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3257/3318998972_e22e69b54c_o.png"">
<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3629/3318172949_53286d589d_o.png"">
He was really smart too!  Mom and Aunt Ronnie both agreed that none of my siblings and cousins or I had ever learned to use the potty as quickly as Edward did.  And almost as soon as he was able to walk, Edward managed to find a way to get out of his crib.  This was sometimes hazardous, as he'd often wander off somewhere once he was out of his crib, and it'd take us awhile to find him.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3353/3318998676_7ab6219e54_o.png"">
He could almost always be found with Jack though.  He loved that doll.  Wherever Jack was, Edward was never far, and vice versa.  It was adorable, watching him with that doll.  

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3405/3318173055_3df88ecf08_o.png"">
<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3312/3318173229_e086c71df3_o.png"">
He definitely had some pipes though.  Edward was more or less a happy toddler, but when he was cranky, he was <i>loud</i>, and it was difficult to soothe him, especially if he was tired.  And if Jack got lost?  He wouldn't stop crying until we found him.  We made sure Jack was always in sight whenever we could.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3504/3318173417_335d84d7c7_o.png"">
My cousin Calla came over often for dinner and just to visit with us and mostly Uncle Adder and Aunt Ronnie, and Edward loved her.  She was his favourite person to play with, and she always played with him.  She could keep him occupied and happy for hours.  And she loved spending time with him too.  There were numerous times when she baby-sat when Starla and I needed to get away for some time to ourselves.  

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3432/3318999804_91d4e6cbf1_o.png"">
<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3302/3318173759_f3be4a84f8_o.png"">
Uncle Adder and Aunt Ronnie's relationship was definitely back to normal.  He was always doing romantic things for her, like bringing her flowers and chocolates and things like that.  And even though I thought that watching my aunt and uncle make out on the couch was pretty gross, Starla thought it was so romantic and sweet, and I guess she was right.  I just didn't want to see it.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3384/3319000178_2134535553_o.png"">
One day though, it all came to an end for them.  I don't think any of us saw it coming, but especially not Uncle Adder.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3636/3318174117_a469fa0fc1_o.png"">
Even though he was the youngest of everyone from their generation, he'd had a really good life, a long and happy and healthy one, so he didn't fight Grim when he came to take him away.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3633/3319000608_0014f18fb4_o.png"">
We were all very sad, but Aunt Ronnie was heartbroken.  She'd loved him so much, for most of her life.  She'd felt guilty too.  The two of them had been...well, they'd been having some ""fun"" on the couch just before Grim came, and she blamed herself for his death.  She'd thought that maybe they were too rough or something.  Although all of us tried our hardest to keep those images out of our heads, we all comforted her and tried to reassure her that none of it had been her fault.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3497/3318174479_e2062a80aa_o.png"">
We weren't the only one's affected by Uncle Adder's death.  Edward was extremely upset by it and went through a really tough period then.  He was cranky all the time for what felt like ages after Uncle Adder died, and nothing we did could soothe him.  Nothing but comfort from Aunt Ronnie.  She was still hurting terribly from losing the love of her life, but she soothed Edward when he cried.  They got each other through it all, I think.  They had a really close bond after that.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3315/3319000930_f957358733_o.png"">
Meanwhile, I'd been hearing reports at the hospital about men and women being abducted and then let go several hours later.  But the even weirder part about these stories was that the men who were abducted were apparently left pregnant, and nine months later, gave birth to a human/alien hybrid.  I couldn't believe it!  As far as I knew there had been no actual studies done, so I thought I'd run a little study myself.  First, try to lure the aliens to me.  I wasn't at all sure that they even existed yet, so my first task was to prove that they did.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3521/3318174871_c8d34edbe5_o.png"">
I had no luck for several weeks.  I was growing tired of going out every night, trying to lure aliens that I had no proof even existed.  I was beginning to think it was just a big hoax, like Big Foot or the Loch Ness Monster, and I was just about to give up, but one night, something happened to prove me wrong.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3617/3318175183_956981676f_o.png"">
I think I screamed when the spaceship beamed me up, because I vaguely remember Starla rushing out to see what had happened.  She was worried beyond belief when she saw me being eaten by the spaceship, she'd told me later.  Mom had run out a little bit later.  She didn't believe Starla at all when she'd told her what had happened.  She laughed hard, thinking it was all some practical joke.  When I didn't come back for several hours, then she realized that Star must've been telling the truth.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3371/3318175013_408f2617a0_o.png"">
I was more than a little bit freaked out when they finally let me go.  I don't remember much of what happened.  I just vaguely remember feeling different sensations of every kind, from the most excruciating pain to the most intense pleasure I've ever felt, and everything in between.  I couldn't believe I'd just been abducted my aliens!  

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3481/3319001582_6c7c49c3f6_o.png"">
As soon as I calmed down enough, I ran inside and wrote down everything I remembered.  I would need to include all of this in my study.  And every day, I took all sorts of measurements of my body and lots of observations, keeping track of my pregnancy--which I quickly confirmed it was.  As the weeks passed, I quickly found out that I had many of the same symptoms that pregnant women often experienced, including morning sickness.  I think that that was the worst part of it in those first few months.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3618/3318175479_011259aa99_o.png"">
<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3443/3318175657_d2f2ec0f6e_o.png"">
Through all of this Edward was still a very energetic toddler, always getting into trouble, keeping everyone on our toes.  And since I found myself dealing with work, my studies <i>and</i> this pregnancy, Starla was the one who gave Edward the most attention, playing with him, reading bedtime stories to him, comforting him when he fell.  She was a great mother.  I felt incredibly lucky to be able to call her my wife.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3368/3318175813_ce9599d73d_o.png"">
Time passed, and I kept getting bigger and bigger.  How bizarre!  It was fascinating and scary at the same time.  But as I continued through my pregnancy, the study I was conducting became less and less important as the bond between me and my unborn child grew.  How could I do a study on an innocent child?  I still recorded any changes in my body, but ultimately, I decided that I wasn't going to continue on with the study.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3587/3319002304_6eeb8f7e78_o.png"">
Meanwhile, Edward was still growing up way too quickly.  Before we all knew it, he was five years old, all ready to start school.  He was so excited.  On his first day of school, he got up very early, before dawn even, to get ready.  He would be tired that night, but there was just no going back to sleep again.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3646/3318176335_57f7481b59_o.png"">
<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3330/3319002702_0865021fb5_o.png"">
He was still a very good child.  He always had a hug for everyone in the family before he left to catch the bus, and again when he got home from school, and again right before bed.  And he was still smart as anything.  Starla and I had taught him that studying was important, and we showed him that too.  We had a deal that when he studied and did his homework, so did we.  Since it was a family affair, and since he could see that even grown ups had to hit the books, it made him more agreeable towards homework, even when he'd rather play with his toys instead.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3386/3318176005_d6eb0f2d12_o.png"">
It'd been a few years since Uncle Adder had passed away, but Aunt Ronnie still missed him terribly.  I don't think she ever really got over his death, no matter how much time passed, no matter how many times we told her it hadn't been her fault.  She didn't blame herself anymore, at least.  She'd made peace with herself there, but it didn't stop her from missing him.  She always would.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3526/3319002844_9b233d60c2_o.png"">
I, meanwhile, was having a terrible time with my pregnancy, at least as terrible a time as Starla had had when she'd been pregnant with Edward.  Of course this felt so much worse than what I remembered her feeling.  I never had any energy and often fell asleep in my food, too hungry to go to bed and too sleepy to eat.  I also had to go to the bathroom all the time.  I swore that baby purposely stomped on my bladder, just to make me even more uncomfortable.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3334/3318176783_746d5b3129_o.png"">
All of this really began to freak me out.  What if I couldn't do this?  What if alien/human hybrid babies ate different things, required nutrients that didn't exist on this planet?  And assuming it was able to thrive here, what would happen when it entered school?  Would it be teased by everyone?  But no, there were all sorts of different-looking people, many side effects from the explosion.  Uncle Adder was a perfect example, and so was Starla.  But even telling myself these things, I was still very worried about having this baby.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3626/3318176949_932bd1f08b_o.png"">
<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3350/3319003290_b135e6d955_o.png"">
Mom and Dad were both really great though.  Both of them rubbed my stomach often and talked to my baby and gave it lots of love.  Starla and Edward and Aunt Ronnie were great too.  Just by loving me and my unborn baby, they soothed my fears and helped me to understand that no matter what happened, our family would be alright, including the baby.  All together, we could work through anything.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3600/3319003408_389a41d351_o.png"">
One night Dad was just getting ready for bed when Uncle Adder visited him.  He couldn't say much, of course, but he seemed to be telling Dad to say goodbye.  He kept saying the words over and over again.  Dad had said, later on, that he'd felt a chill run down his spine then, and that he'd known that his life was coming to an end.  He didn't tell anyone about it though, not wanting his last days to be spent in sadness.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3553/3318177427_5fac67be44_o.png"">
<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3365/3318177693_813bdda491_o.png"">
He was extremely surprised then, when Grim didn't come for him, but for Mom instead.  Uncle Adder hadn't been telling him to say goodbye to all of us because he was going to die, but to say goodbye to Mom, because it was her time to go.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3523/3319004154_199dd11f3f_o.png"">
Dad was very angry with everything for a long time after that.  How dare death take his wife instead of him?  He was the one who was supposed to die, he thought, not my mom.  He missed her so much.  She'd been the love of his life, the woman he'd loved for almost fifty years.  It was extremely hard for him to live without her.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3460/3319003992_f305fd1c6b_o.png"">
Edward was very upset about it too.  He and his grandma had been very close, and since he'd been so young when Uncle Adder had died, my mom's death had more or less been the first one he'd ever experienced.  He'd taken it very hard, but with time, and with lots of love from Starla and I and the rest of the family, he slowly began to move on.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3319/3318178151_c75c85e9ed_o.png"">
Dad was finding it much more difficult to move on.  Aunt Ronnie understood.  They began to spend a lot of time together, talking about my mom and Uncle Adder, remembering them.  They'd even begun to sleep in the same bed.  I'm pretty sure nothing sexual ever came of it--I really hope not.  I think it was just a comfort thing.  Neither one of them felt like they could sleep alone.  They helped each other out.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3469/3318178275_c1e72e3717_o.png"">
Finally, the day came when my pregnancy would finally come to an end.  It <i>hurt</i>.  A lot.  And it seemed to take forever.  How did women do this?  The pain had been excruciating.  As much as I loved kids, it was nothing that I ever wanted to do ever again.  Starla could have the next one.

<img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3359/3319004536_897c6d8fb7_o.png"">
In the end, though, it was all worth it.  All the pain, the discomfort, the fatigue, the morning sickness....it was all worth it because I held a miracle in my hands: my new baby girl.  My daughter...my Etoile.

Notes:

--Again, I'm really sorry this took so long to come out!  I'm really hoping that I'll be able to get these out with more regularity from now on.  

--I can't believe that both Ada and Adder died before Ronnie and Joel!  They were pretty significantly younger than them.  Joel's the oldest, and I'm pretty sure he was at least 5 days older than Ada, and Ronnie was at least 4 days older than her.  I don't get it.  It pissed me off when they died.  I loved Adder.

--Adder bit it just before he and Ronnie were supposed to do the nasty on the couch.  They both got naked, and cuddled together, and then he got up and got dressed again to die.  She obviously was still naked as she bawled her eyes out for him.  :(  Poor Ronnie.  She didn't even get any last sex.

I actually think that that's it for now.  Hopefully I'll be back soon!  I've got a ton of pictures to fix up and post.  In game, Etoile is in college and Edward has already graduated.  Lol.

Of course, they kind of compared it to two trains crashing into each other, but still."

"event","Ugh, it pisses me off when I read magazines and I see contests.  I get all excited, thinking about entering, and then I read the small print and realize it's only open on U.S. citizens.  WTF?!  Especially for smaller things like iPods or even smaller things like clothes or whatever.  But even for bigger things like trips to such-and-such a place in the U.S.  Hello, I'm right next door!  It's not like I live on the other side of the world and they'd have to ship whatever the prize was all that way.  It's not as if they have to fly my halfway across the world to get to whatever destination they've chosen as a prize.  Hell, depending on destination, I might actually be closer than the actual winner.  So dumb.  

And I don't care if it's a legal issue.  If my old teen magazines I used to buy had contests open to me, then dammit, so can In Touch and Us, and all those other shitty magazines out there."

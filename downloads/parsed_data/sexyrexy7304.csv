>>>so im supposing i should update- this weekend was GREAT for the most part. i love my friends, im one damn lucky girl!

doug, robert, and alessandro came to visit erika this weekend from melbourne, and it was really nice seeing ppl from back home. i slept at her place both nights and fun was had by all- we went to a party on friday and got to see erika and ferrah looking beautiful as always, then on sat we went to lunch, dinner at isha's resturant, and to the hooka bar for the night. the boys loved te hooka(who doesnt) and they got to meet britt, my roommate, and the other crazy wonderful ppl that work at the meridian.like RYAN and lil ryan- so many husbands, so little time hah

robert was annoying as hell im sorry but he was.... doug wasnt half as bad as erika made him out to be, i still love im even if he can be immature- pms has that effect on her...
and alessandro is always amazing

still, i cant wait to go home next tusday for my birthday and see everyone and hang out and dance at county line and see harry potter(yes im a dork like that) and see all the friends and family i've been missing for so long.... 

but in the mean time, wednesday, me and alaska are going with my sister and kristen and my mom and jim to see U2 in concert.... should be exciting!

in closing, i love erika and erika, michi and alaska, mags, mollz, britt, rach, alysha, julianna, and bren and jo, and many many many many many other ppl who are very good to me! thank you!

 

hah oh yah i love alex too, we soooooo getting married. well either me or erika, whichever works best. oh, yah, and if you read this, erika(the new one you just met) said you were cute. so you have a chance. be happy!"

"event","i've also decided that boys are overrated. and that im going ot stop waiting for that magical combination of me likeing them AND them likeing me cause that never seems to work out. therefore, i'll just wait till someone not half bad wants me and just work with that. at least they'll like me then. who cares what i think??"

"event","so lots of shitty things have been happening lately but oh well, its not the end of the world.
i've had to replace my phone 4 times but i think this time it might actually work. had to fix my computer (at best buy- did i mention the 30 minute drive) whereupon they ripped out my hard drive and lost everything i own.. all my quotes, all my music, all my pictures, all my word documents and half written papers. ALWAYS fun stuff. and then it was still acting up (after 7 trips out there that kinda pissed me off!) oh, plus my radio in my car works some days.. but then some days it doesn't- its all kind of random and annoying. 

coupled with class stress i've been having a bad couple of days.

oh yah im changing my major. to what you may ask?? dont know. either advertising or public relations (both mass comm degress) but its all confusing and i have to figure out what i wanna do for the rest of my life. heady stuff, this. what if im wrong? whta if i hate what i do?

who knows. right now im leaning towards working in a publishing company as some sort of pr person/spokesperson. any ideas? anyone? tell me what to do, and save me the trouble.

my birthday is coming up though(NOVEMBER 22), and i cant wait to go home. i want my mommy dammit. and some turkey
>>>(i love thanksgiving). i want my glasses replaced and a haircut. thats all i want for christmas, santa. im kinda easy this year."

"event","drama drama drama 
Current mood:  tired 


soooo. yah. there was some drama last night. some in my head (cause im an idiot) and some with others who i work with.

to start off with, other than last night (which was still fun but the drama pulled it down a notch) i had a DAMN good weekend for various reasons .. ..  ...... thats right i got some

but last night, i dunno, my head was fucked up. maybe i was just pmsing or something, whatever. almost everyone was pissing me off, hell, i was pissing myself off but i got over that. was supposed to have a kegger at mine but crap happened as usual and it didnt come till late(after i left) 

fortunatly i was with alaska and she kept me sane and not biting anyones head off. we first went to the mclain brothers house which is always fun cause they are CRAZY and they sing alot- erika you missed it!! but after awhile we left (did i mention that im a dumbass? haha not for leaving thats another story.) and we went to dans place and michi, randy, nikki, and julianna were there and we hung out for a bit (god i love julianna i havent seen her in forever) but dan was an ass to nikki so all the females left and on the way out, my boss (suraj who showed up a bit later) told us that we were acting like 12 year olds (which we pretty much were but dan was an ass and deserved it) oh plus, the part where he noticed i had a hickie was GREAT cause i love it when my boss knows what im doing in my spare time! (no incriminating comments please, anyone) 

so we went back to michis and hung for a bit. in the mist of hysterical laughing and dan and suraj calling julianna trying to get us to come back i gave michi a lap dance- she loved it lol- and finally we went back only to be yelled at somemore for leaving but whatever we played asshole(dan's game!) and hung out some more

plus nikki got her revenge hhahaha i didnt think she'd really do it! me and alaska went back to mine and apparently the party was horrible and everyones car got towed so i was glad we didnt stay. 

but tonight is michis bday celebration so im looking forward to it.. will have some good pics too which should last me for awhile

and no school tomarrow SWEET im sleeping in and doing nothing all day. gotta love four day weekends!

i heart college life! despite the drama my friends are amazing and life is good...."

in other news i finished my paper on time but instead of studying for my psych midterm like i should be in writing this (and talking to a cute boy on myspace. its wrong, and i know it, but he doesnt seem like a perv and hes funny. did i mention hes really cute? 

i got another test thursday and another on next tues so can someone please shoot me??? school really sucks sometimes. 2 papers to write too! i need to get away. i wanna go to UF or emory for the weekend just to get away from tampa. most of the times i love it but sometimes there's so much damn drama i wanna scream. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHh.   hhhhh.

blah. maybe i should just go home. or hiberate all day when im not in class with a locked door and blankets over my head and the tv blarring crap i dont wanna watch. or sad girly movies that meke me wanna cry till i remember its just a movie then i really wanna shoot myself for being stupid. wow im being angry for no reason im gonna go to bed now."

this weekend was fun too, even though half the roommates were in miami for part of the weekend. fri we all went ot tias to see joe's band and they did amazing, as usual. i was VERY drunk so of course that improved things, and i was sooooooo happy cause alaksa, my new favorite person came to and she had fun on  her first night out on the town in tampa. then e went to the campus lodge pool and jumped off the jelly bean (i know your jealose lol). sat i slept all damn day and did some hw hhen ogt ready for the 8 partys me and rach were gonna hit. but we got to drunk at the first one that didnt happen- suprise suprise. HOT boy there named nick, but his booty call was present for the evening so that sucked...lol. sun was lots more hw but i did see insomniac and DANE COOK my lover, plus isha came over to entertain me..

i was SUPPOSED to see erika for hr bday after she drove in from melbourne but hse was too hung over, i i think we're going to applebee's after i get out of work tonight o celebrate...

"event","so im tired and had a long ass day which, thankfully, included a 3 hour nap. 

how come some friends are so self centered and never think of anyone but themselves/ the boy their seeing? and yet some are so amazing and give so much on so many levels, never once thinking about whats in it for them. 

i just hope im the second type of friend, cause the other kind are really pissing me off right now and i NEVER want any of my friends to feel like that around me... like the only reason im graced with their presence is so they can vent, or otherwise to tell excited stories about how great the guy is, how wonderful it is, how happy they are, blah blah blah. some bitch about everything else in their life while others ignore the rest altogether because all the think about is the guy. 

now i understand boys can have that effect on a girl, and im happy for them, but when i havent seen that person for 3 weeks, or when i see them everyday (it doesnt matter), would it be alot to ask to hear just one ""how are you"", even maybe just out of politeness??? is that alot? most ppl say it and dont even mean it. or like when they call you out of the blue and say nothing about you, but do update you on the boy situation and how happy they are. BYE! no, hey, i miss you, how is school, nope. nothing. just shit. shit. SHIT!!i think its just a courtousy to inquire and CARE about whats happening in someone that you love's life. funny thing is, its not like id talk forever, id let them have the time to tell everything, cause i want them to be happy and im glad they found someone and that everythings working out. but WE have a relationship, too, so it might be nice to keep that intact.

i guess maybe thats the problem, the love between friends that you thought was there really isnt and the only reason your there is because you are. proximity does not a friendship make! anyways im tired of venting im out"

what more can i say.

soo many things have happened, both good and bad.

last night, i worked. did see the hot boss, nothing esp interesting happened other than me checking out his ass the entire night. no suprises there.

afterwards i went to meal plan with erika and nikki and it was good to see my girls.i called michi but she neglected to answer her phone...

then i got home and promptly started drinking wine and white russians. we were all VERY happy(other than brit who drove my car- DD baby!) and then the keg was begun. needless to say, the night was CRAZY and WONDERFUL and many things cannot be mentioned(or maybe i just have a foggy memory. your call).slept n joey's bed (thanks! i love you joey!) and woke up 9ish cause rach had to be at work at 12 plus we needed to go home and get her ready for it. so britt was hungry and we decided to go to bagel world. (not really bagel world but one of those bagel places we know and love) we get our food and attempt to leave. only my car wont start. tried to jump it but she just wasn't having it. long story short my daddy is coming to town to help me after he picks up his car which just got fixed. and my momma is the best momma in the world she fixes everything.

matt was good enough to pick us up and bring us home, and all the while in a damn good mood. then me and britt sit down to eat and watch realworld austin and it was the episode where that one kid's mom dies. which kind of put things in perspective so im gonna go call my mom now and thank her for being alive and all. then im goin to bed till papa cito gets here. should i hide all the liquer bottles? eh well, wouldnt know where to put them anyways. night all. or good morning. actually, have a damn good afternoon. im going to bed."

 every day since i've been back has had something CRAZY, lots of parties and all that shit that i love so much. last night me and the roomies went to the boy's new place in campus walk which, of course, was great cause i got to see everyone and talk to lots of random ppl- we also went to the hooka for a bit and i actually got to talk to aly 

    (P.S.>>>> i fucking found you, arent you immpressed???)

not for the skinny ""fat"" girl who beats other, lesser, females over the head with sharp pointy- heeled shoes...

or the girl who runs the causeway in a bathrobe for kicks while playing air guitar and singing ""twinkle, twinkle, little FUCKING star (i wonder where the FUCK you are!?!)""

"event","so summers pretty good, actually, working alot but thats the price you pay for life i guess... its not bad, though, i may be tired, but the girls i babysit for are easy and fun to hang with... think im gonna take them to the beach next week, maybe lunch at fridays or something fun like that. and at the movies, ive meet lots of fun ppl, and hey, free movies are a wonderful thing.

other than that, as most of you know, ive been at county line tons this summer, trying my best and actually learning some. hopefully in tampa the dances i know arent TOO different, though unfortunatly ive heard that my favorite one is completly different. but i hold hopes that it'll be fun as well!! 

moving in with brittanie in her apartment so next year will be soooooo freakin crazy, i cant wait to decorate my room and get all my crap together and make everything look great! brit, rachel and who ever the other girl is should be great(hell, i know they will be) so hopefully i as well in school as im planning on doin OUTSIDE if it. being in tampa again will be such a strange thing, esp after leaving melbourne from the first time i've actually had fun in this damn town, but with such good things to look forward to i cant regret it. and i know everyone will come visit me to party in tampa and thats what counts... hopefully i see them alot, or i jus dont knwo what im going to do! lol...

and now michis living in monticello (hopefully) so she'll be closer to me. yay!! and i knwo i'll still see erika lots, cause between her and nikki, i'll be over there all the time, and they better visit me DAMN aften


in other news, my mom wants me to try and emancipate myself, so that'll be hard, and i dont knwo if it'll be possible cause of my scholarships... my brunswick one only works cause im a dependant of one of their employees, my dad... thats $2000 less a year, so i dunno, i really dont know. whatever, i'll figure it out, and i wont think about i now or i'll freak. out of sight, out of mind...

but lifes pretty good right now so im goin to concentrate on that, with good things to look forward to!"

"event","ok so m not bi-polar i swear but i havent writen in this thing in ages and many things have changed... mostly the status of my relationship with bret... which now does not exist.

by my choice, dont let me mislead you. it was right to do i just hope i didnt hurt him, and that we can still be good friends. no, no other guys were involoved in the situation and im not likely to start up anything again soon. so hopefully i'll just work alot make loads of money and hang with my friends... summer could still hold lots of fun, so im gonna wish for it...

but i know the school year will be... living with brit and rachel will be kick-ass, and im sure the girl i dont know will be great too. go we're gonna party sooo much next year, it'll be crazy. damn all i can think about (when its not about the breakup) is how to decorate my room... it better be good. suggestions, anyone??"

"event","haha ok, happy journal entry after miles and miles of ones which was all the shit goin through my head and my angry points. so im good now, and i gotta tell you its better- this relates back to the whole depressed comments and me not wanting to be it- not that i was depresses, pissed off would be a beter description. and, as i am easily transparent, ill let it out now- yes i have met someone, and no, their name is not chris or dave or any of the damn repeating names in this damn journal- which i might point out, seems bipolar cause i only write in the damn thing in extremes of emotion, sorry bout that lol.

>>> so the shpeall, for everyone. a the redsocks game and a little happy from some red wine, britt wants to go to the bathroom,so we walk up the stairs and i see a tall, tan, thin(but not too thin) boy with dark hair and he was yummy. i kinda smiled at him cause i was curiose but i thought nothing of it. then brit saw her friend matt, who she ran up to and hugged, who, low and behold, was with random attractive boy and friend and brits cousin, justin(really swet guy, btw!). so, hum, we went and all sat together and both of the boys i didnt know started to be really flirty with me, ie puttng stuff in the hood of my jacket and ice down the back of my shirt. you know, random, cute, third grade activities. and i, not being the typical girl, through it straight back at them(i was told later this was a plus cause apparently other girls dont do that). So one of them, trey, was extremely and obviously slutty, inthe best sort of way. you know, the fun ""whore"" of a boy you'd never touch but make great friends with. In this, i assumed, b/c they were best friends and do look and act similarly, that they were both the same.

>>gotta tell you, was i ever wrong. not about trey, of course, cause he really is hilarious and slutty. Bret (random attractive boy) is hilarious, but not slutty at all. so me and britt went to matts house that night for party-esque activities and fun, and i saw them again and they were fun as ever but i realized what Bret was really like- realy nice and honest and upfront about what he wanted- ie, ME!! yes, thats right, ladies and gentlemen, he wants me and not just for one night. he tells me continually that im beautiful and fun and overall great, and how sad he is that im leavign in two weeks for summer. (this is where i melt). i mean, i know exactly what he wants and its what i want and, damn, he's a nice boy. the next day, me, Bret, trey, bret's sister tara,amd her son(bout 8 yrs old) all went to the beach. i saw what his sister thought of him when he wasnt their and how he treated his nephew and all was adorable and whatnot. he called me that night, just like he said he would and just wanted to talk, and invited me to a picnic/ bar-be-que at his and his sisters house on sun...(the beach was sat). so bout 1.30 i was there and we had tons of fun and erika was there too, and she met his friend Jamie, and she might have something with him, so fun and goodness all round.

as for a run down on the boy himself, besides tall and cute and dark haired (already you know im for it), he has his eyebrow pierced (his nipples too, fabulousness, i gotta tell you) and tattoos on both his arms and his back and with plans to get more. he listens to country mostly, believe it or not, so when he comes to visit me in melb (Molly, did i mention he wants to come visit??? ahah i know you'll like that) i wanna take him to county line, and he'll know all the songs (he sings to me!)he also likes punk and alternative, my great loves in life. he's a bit smaller than me, skinney wise, but not by much and he has plans to gain 50 pounds of muscle ( i cant imagine it, and he looks great w/o it, but hell, i'm all for it). and trey has a girl he really likes that i got to meet, shes sweet as hell too. 

did i mention that they are both freakishly strong and that they kick my ass? in the best way, you know, no harm done, but they could wrestle me and pin me with no effort, and im a strong girl. damn, its kinda like the brothers i never had (lol even though bren had no problems, literally, beating me up!! jordana, too for that matter. damn, but paybacks a bitch). anyways i had fabulous amounts of fun and will continue to, i KNOW this for sure cause he told me so, and also cause Jamie wants to hang out with us and erika to get to know her better. damn that girls a stud. fortuanatly i think she's actually interested, so more power to her. anyways this is a freakin long entry and i know that last few were long rants as well, so i'll go for now. if i thnk of more details later ill fill you in. 
thanks to all my friends,you all are fabulous! <3 MUAH!!"

"event","dispondent. nothing i do is ever right, i always do something wrong or say the the wrong words or GODDAMN IT! nothing is right. i dotn even know the words, its just that it figures and its my fault anyways, i put too much in it and in other ppl. somehow other ppl can depend on others and be ok, but not me, not that way. so now im angry and cynical and, suprise, suprise, its my fault. seems like this is a pattern. 

btw, happy 4.20 everyone. mine sucks ass. 

random boy from HS aims me today is asks funny Qs, see, the last time i talked to him, he was all like ""hey, you still stubborn with guys?"". and im like 'what the hell does that mean???"". seriously. and his answer didnt much help, cause he was like uh, i dunno, like you dont need a boyfriend or something. of course i said NO i dont NEED a boyfriend, jesus chris, i am capable of being on my own, for god sakes ive dont it forever, but that doesn't mean i dont want one, or im not open to one. he got all wierd and started talkin about how other girls were, which, apparently, is ""you know. kind of like, they can be manipulated"". and is this a good thing, a girl who cant stand up for herself? ""well, yah, kind of"". WHAT AN ASS!!! jeez, it may be in your unconscious but the least you could do is refrain from mentioning it to me! i explained that for me, the guy has to make the first move. not the girl doesnt have to help, of course, but if a boy likes a girl enough, bottomline, he'll go for her. he'll call her, and ask her out, and blah blah blah. plus i got this weird underlyign vibe that he was hitting on me, which was VERY wierd, but i figured if he was he wouldnt be sayign some of that crap. plus he's one of those ""christians"" who doesnt approve of drinking or sex or gays or whatever, which isnt the point, only that i told him that i do drink, that i enjoy it for the most part, yes, im safe and i dont drive and dont put myself in bad situations etc, but i still enjoy it. and if i had someone, i dont think there's anything wrong with sex. and i LOVE gay ppl, their fabulous, so i really dont see what this kid would ever see in me, whatever whatever whatever.

>>.feed to today, aims me starts talkin bout his ex, a girl i knew who was on my v-ball team, nice enough btu i never knew her very well. how she wants him back but he's not thinkin bout her at all ""b/c her values changed at college adn she wasn't the same person"". ookkkkaaayyy. thats nice. so u gonna get back with her? eh, i dunno, blah, crap spewing out of his mouth. then he starts saying crap about the perfect boy, aka a boy who cooks and plays v-ball. aka, him(not that he spelled it out) but it was freakin weird and i didnt liek it. then another random boy from hs aims me (am i just popular today or what??) is all like, hey, hows it goin? hows school? okay..whatever. random, wierd conversation but i have no idea what the hell he wanted. .. ???? .. no clue.then carlos randomly sends me a metal cd, um thanks, buddie, but then he has to go. 

somethings up with britt, i can tell, but who knows when or if i'll get it out of her. 

i wanted to go home this sat for the art festival in melb, my fav part of melb OF ALL TIME, but i think its gonna rain, and i have a 10-15 pg paper due on wed, and i five page one due thursday. 

and im tired. and irritated, as you can tell. and i had high hopes of fun today, which has sucked ass.and im goin to go to the greenery in a fit of self- punishment. all i wanna do is get so drunk i puke. not sure how thats gonna help, but it sounds good bout now.only i dont have an id, so cigg it is, the ones you bum off ppl. eewwww. i hate them they smell gross adn taste bad, btut they work. bastards.

and molly, hun, i swear that guy is scummy, stay away, he gives me the creeps. hahah ok, we just talked, so stay safe, i love you.

michi, good luck on ur hw, i love you. 

all else, im sorry for venting so much, but its better here in 10 min of bitching than to load it on all my friends, boys and girls, who dont deserve it. so deep breaths, all is well. its out, im through. i love you all. <3 thanks molly, i was just in it too much. im goin to go out and have a good time and i REALLY DO LOVE YOU!! and cant wait to see you... <3<3<3<3<3"

"event","ok, just read over a few of my entries and i gotta say, i sound really shallow. damn. im not really, i do care but i talk in that flippant sarcastic voice and make everything sound so meaningless. and ive mentioned a million and a half boys and, damn that made me feel like a whore. and hell, we all know i dont get much ass. i just mention everyday one of them in this journal.so that'd be al of two, since i started this damn thing. both named chris as well, interesting. (side note- i knw too damn many chris's!!)(oh, and too many daves as well, cause damn, i was confusing myself while reding thsi crap, as to who i was talkin bout). so i just wanna say most of the boys mentioned in here are friends ive never thought about in a ""like"" sort of way, dont get me wrong i love them to death but i dont want them at all) and even some of the confusion (ie carlos) was kind of a two day, passing ""humm? i wonder"" kind of thing. and both of the chris's i actually kind of liked,(one i still do, recent one, im sure ur glad to know), the first we didnt have enough chemistry and current one, whatever, who cares anymore hes not half as nice as i thought he was.

side note, a q for teh girls, what the hell is is bout getting some, even if its only kissing, tht makes you need more of it. like i'll go for months with no contact of that nature of anykind and be fine, then after one night of making out or whatever and i cant stop thinkin about it and wanting it again, i swear to god my body physically aches and im not even having sex. i cant imagine how much harder it will be after i do(one day, yea,i know, itll happen). now i understand what nikki was talkin bout when she and matty broke up.... how its hard to stop things with a boy b/c your used to the prgression, the natural progression, even though its not with someone you actually like or want to be with. now dont get me wrong, im having no problems stopin it when its not serious(damn, v card again) but i do know part of where your coming from. 

anyways im tired and the roommate is in bed and i feel bad, sometimes im a shit roommate i think, i dont wanna bother her, but damn its only 11.20. well,i shall bother her no longer tonight, love everyone and ill have an actual update bout the going on's of my life soon. night"

classes r fine, and my last day of work (w/ the hot boss and everyone else) is wednesday. school will be over soon, and summer will be fun, i know it. but im really gonna miss everyone here, dont know what im goin to do.it'll be weird to be around my mom and sister constantly, btu not around the ppl ive been round constantly for how many months? i hope this time away makes me appriciate them even more..... though its true i do that now!

"event","first off, less than jake was fabulous(!!!) live and so were the other bands (though they could never quite reach that LTJ talent level). fun was had by all and i met some famous ppl, aka chris and jr of the band. well, i met jr, not chris so much. but he was there, so no worries. talked to mags, too, that was great and im gonna see her at the show on the 16th for fallout boy and the academy... good stuff all around.

>> Gainesville was great, i gotta say. the boys are HOT with some emphasis on that HOT and it was nice cause while tampa does have quite a few, they dont exist in those numbers. it was amazing, i still think im in shock. we went out and met some of katys new friends who were nice despite the drama, saw some kids from hs, still depressed as they ever were. i love them all, but im glad im not always around them cause, damn, i wanna be happy so screw that.

>> my job is now offically on, thanks jordana! this summer oughta be good, and im wishing i'll met some one nice, cute, and happy that holds some interest for me. im actually rather optimistic about this, i still dont want serious but as i said before, a summer romance is in order. anything beyond that, we'll just c when or if it happens.

hope everyone elses weekend was as great as mine!"

"event","life is... slow. mostly enjoyable. occational moments of distress, but mostly a nice status quo above water. 

truefully, its more of an absence of feeling. i'm sort of numb for no particular reason. i was home this weekend and did a whole lotta nothing. i wanted to go to a concert to see the sleeping, but that didnt work out (DAMN YOU, WHITLOW!!!!!) and i mostly just hung out and watched tv and amc and tmc. classics- oldies but goodies. but mostly, just oldies. all i hae to say is, tammy falls in love way to much, esp considering i've never been in love and i dont think ill happen anytime soon... more like never.... no this is not fishing, michi, consoling words are unwanted. im not sad about it, as i said earlier. numb, remember. which is much easier, i guess. 

the highlight of my day is twofold- i have a job that pays decently for summer(im all for tips) at dos amigos with jordana, my cousin. so that'l be fun. also, im listening to a really good cd which mags gave to me (thanx hunny). sort of bob dylan-esque for modern concerns. 
also, on the good front, schools almost over. summers almost here- i want the sun and surf and money and the parties back home and no curfew and no school work and free time with nothing to do. i want bordom, and maybe a summer romance if there's time to spare. 

also, some random person is asking q's bout chris on this damn thing which is weird cause not many ppl read it and i never mentioned him in a context of ""us"" in here- so it has to be someone i know, and told, and knows my live journal. everyone i know that fits that description, i've asked and its not them. so very odd i suppose. plus, they wont respond to questions of who they are... and they only ask about chris. what the hell??? well, i suppose that ill just write so they know, everyone else as well. so here it is... i dont think anything is happening. no, we havent had that conversation, but im not as slow as i might seem. generally, im guessing, when u like someone you want to be with them... and i havent seen him. we dont talk as much, yes, mostly from school and stress, btu whatever, bottom line, if he liked me he would try or at least make damn sure i knew he was tryin. so at this point im over it, whatever, its not a big deal. just another thing that wont happen. i hope i dont lose him as a friend, though, cause he was damn funny and fun to be around, and i dont wanna miss out on that cause he feels wierd around me.hopefully he'll get over it and cabin four will be what it used to. so heres to that...

schools goin okay, as is work. boss is still hot. nikki thinks he is interested, but i dont see it. i might go to a concert for less than jake, but we'll see if i talk to dave(not highschool emo dave, this ones in the band with joe, second start) or see what the deal is, cause i dont know anyone else goin. 

the one bad part about summer(besides goin home) is takin apart my room. all the pictures on my walls, the post cards, the spoon, the schedules, the memories.packing all my clothes and my whole new life to fit into my car and my dads bigass truck, for 3 months in melbourne. even the tv and the shot glasses and books and movies, my printer and picture frames, pillows and sheets, makeup and all the random nonsense ive collected over these past few months. it seems like its over, this new life of mine, and i cant decide if thats a good thing or not. of course, ill miss my girls (i love u all) but it already seems like we're drifting apart, now, when we're a couple hundred ft apart. i'm becoming the loner again, just like i used to be. the anti-socialness is returning, the hardening of the heart (not from cholestoral or how ever u spell it), and the feelings of numbness. 

   somehow, ive been here before. when was it? so many times i cant even remember them anymore."

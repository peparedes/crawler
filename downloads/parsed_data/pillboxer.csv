"event","I don't think it's a secret that I'm not exactly completely happy with my job.  Sure, it pays great, the benefits keep me from going deep into debt when I wind up in the ER, and also give me opportunities to work in other states (wheeeeee, I'm south of the Mason-Dixon Line!).

However, there's just something missing.  I don't wake up in the morning and go, ""Sweet, another day of work, I can't wait.""  It's more of a, ""Well, I gotta pay some bills, let's hope I don't radically fuck something up today.""  I know that most people don't LOVE their jobs so much that they put in a good 8-hour turnaround (time spent between going home at the end of the day and arriving at work the next day) but that's some place I DO want to be.  We spend most of our lives at work, why shouldn't it be something we at least enjoy or take pride in?

I came upon an insight about why I feel the way I do towards my work as a result of some life style changes that needed to be made.  In short, I need to learn how to cook.  Let me explain what my idea of cooking is: boiling water.  Ta-da.  Now I have to do things a little bit more complicated than that.  Get creative, buy fresh veggies and fruits and meats and somehow make them all tasty.

Like the other night I cooked up an omlette for the first time.  I think I had cracked open maybe four eggs in my life before that night.  Since then, I've gone through twice that many.  But when I decided to add some feta cheese, black olives, and fresh ground pepper I was stoked.  Here was something I had built from bits and pieces.  I enjoyed my spoils as they were delicious.

It used to be that cooking was a chore.  I always wanted something quick.  Mini bag of muffins?  Couple Doubl-Stuf Oreos?  Yogurt cup?  Apple sauce cup?  How about a box of Cheez-Its?  I didn't want to spend any time preparing food to eat.  Sometimes I'd take some time and make a decent sandwich but not too often.

It was then I realized that I wasn't really creating anything at work.  All I do is create reports or SQL scripts or exhibits.  So I guess I do create things, but I don't feel like I'm creating them.  It feels like it's all in the ether.  I can't go home and point to all the things I've created, I can only assume they're stashed away on a hard drive somewhere.  But I can come home, throw some stuff together over a flame, and see what I've made and enjoy it as well.

Guess I just have to get used to creating differently."

"event","I recently added <b>The Animaniacs</b> to my Netflix Queue.  I remember watching it daily, promptly following <b>Tiny Toons</b> at it's 4:30 PM EST time slot.  To a kid, the show was funny.  You had all the imitations you never quite understood, the catch-phrases, the puns (so maybe <i>that's</i> where I got my pun-love at), and the sheer variety  of skits.  You had the Animaniacs themselves but also Rita and Runt, The Goodfeathers, and of course, Pinky and the Brain.

Below I've managed to caputure a frame from the opening sequence of the show.  I haven't really gone back and checked out beginnings to other episodes to see if other things are written on the board, but I thought this was interesting.

<img src=""http://shnozwanger.org/pictures/misc/pinky_thx1138.png"">

Besides it looking like Brain is giving head to Pinky you should see <i>THX = 1138</i>.  This is, of course, a reference to George Lucas' first feature-length film <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/THX_1138"">THX 1138</a>.  This film is surely one worth watching if you have not done so yet.  Just like watching the combination of <a href=""http://www.netflix.com/Movie/American_Beauty/60000407?trkid=222336"">American Beauty</a> and <a href=""http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Fight_Club/26004747?trkid=222336"">Fight Club</a> over the same weekend will skew your view of middle-class life, watching THX 1138 in combination of <a href=""http://www.netflix.com/Movie/2001_A_Space_Odyssey/207856?trkid=813688"">2001: A Space Odyssey</a> will make you understand about a quarter of all the slightly obscure sci-fi references you've heard over the years.  Toss in a reading of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Giver"">The Giver</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_new_world"">Brave New World</a> (which has one of the best dialogs in the ending I've read), and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four"">Nineteen Eighty-Four</a> in between spurts of playing <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_runner"">Blade Runner</a> and you'll want to lock yourself in from the future for a week or two.

So why is there a George Lucas reference in The Animaniacs?  Well, Steven Spielberg, who is good friends with George Lucas, produced and was quite involved with The Animaniacs.  Not only that, but both The Animaniacs and THX 1138 came from the Warner Brothers studios."

"event","So when I came home from work the other day, I found my Windows box was not responding to my efforts to get it to come out of sleep mode.  I manually turned on the monitor and noticed it was not getting any signal from the DVI port.  Also, the hard drive activity light was solid.  Something odd was happening.  So I flicked the reset button and was greeted with a harsh beep from the motherboard telling me something was seriously wrong.  Looking up the beep error code in the motherboard's manual tells me that it cannot detect any memory.  Awesome.

So until I get around to ordering a new set of RAM and plopping it in my Windows box, I'm going to use Linux.

Not only will I use Linux but will put my (hopefully specific) complaints with it here.  Starting... now.

1) Can't use my browser.  On my Windows box I use Opera, as I have been for the past four years or so.  However, with the distribution I run, there is no easy way to install Opera.  So I'm stuck with Firefox.  It's open source and it's not Internet Explorer, so it's got two things going for it, but it's just slow as hell.  Rendering as well as doing simple things like, say, scrolling.  I'm sure part of that is to blame for the onboard video I'm using but part of it also stems to Linux's crappy way of handling the video layer.  Well, not Linux, but rather the drivers that one should use."

"event","I'm not sure how to really start this posting, so I'll just jump right in: we could be missing out on some of the better music of our short life-times.  Assuming that anyone who is reading this is my age, that means anywhere from the early 1980s up until now.  But the era in which I am specifically pointing out is the mid 1990s.

I remember getting my first radio sometime around 1991 or 1992.  It was a dual-tape deck that had a headphone jack, stereo or mono selector, and was made by Craig.  It gave me my first taste of freedom: I could listen to whatever was on the radio whenever I wanted.  Of course I was completely unaware of how many genres there were or all of the politics and big money behind the industry.  All that mattered was that I could have a double-sided tape full of music for as much as pack of blank casettes cost.

A few years later - in 1995 or so - a friend let me borrow Weezer's blue album for a week or two.  From the first time I listened to it, I thought it was the greatest album I've ever heard.  It still ranks as one of my top 10 albums  despite hearing hundreds of other albums since.  The point here is that this sparked my interest in a specific genre.  Local rock stations became what I frequently tuned to (101.1, 88.7, and a short-lived 105.7).

There were two other events which were probably critical to my music taste (or lack thereof), both of which happened right about the same time.  Our family finally got the Internet in late 2000.  Know what else was also peaking at that time?  The original Napster.  This meant I could just search up something I heard on the radio and - hopefully - have access to many other of that artist's titles.

This is what I did somewhat frequently when I was driving somewhere listening to the other big breakthrough: college radio.  WHFR (Henry Ford Community College) and CJAM (University of Winsdor) were two stations that I could only pick up in whatever car I was driving, but had no luck listening to when I was at home.  From here I found out about such bands as Starflyer 59, Built to Spill, Death Cab for Cutie, Braid and Hey Mercedes, Sunny Day Real Estate, and others.

When meeting new people in college or online one of the first questions usually asked was, what music do you like?  People started rattling off not just the bands that I had but also stuff from the 1980s.  Bands like The Smiths, The Cure, and KMFDM started popping up due to older siblings pushing it on them or due to listening flashback blocks of programming on local rock stations.

I think that once you learned that there was more stuff out there, you immediately went back and tried to find stuff you had heard at one point and get more of it.  You basically keep going further and further back to get stuff you might've missed.  Except for when you first came of age, in the early to mid 1990s.  You lived through this period and actually thought yourself as being cognitive during it.  I mean, you had stacks of blank casettes filled with miscellaneous songs with DJs talking over the first five and last five seconds.  So why would you go back and listen to this stuff again?

Such it is as I have discovered.  I've liked a few bands that probably peaked during this time but I haven't put all of them together until a recent posting on craigslist where some chick mentioned her favorite Archers of Loaf song.

"event","I'm here today to bitch.  Well, that's actually what I do every day but this a particular bitch-fest because it's centered on bitchyness (bitchiness?  bitchy-ness?) and hatin'.  I see you jockin' me.  Like you.. know.. me.

See, in the <a href=""http://www.lemonparty.org/"">blogosphere</a> it's very popular for people to offer their viewpoint on a plethora of issues: the government, global warming, why the Red Wings suck, and how Lindsay Lohan's new movie is totally awesome.

Amongst all this verbal diarrhea there are occasionally opinions about various purposeful attention-getters (see, <b>Tia Tequila</b>).  Usually, these opinions are condemning dissents saying that it shouldn't be on the air, it has no technical or worthwhile content, it's all that is wrong and unholy with the TV/Internet/Radio today, etc.  That's fine, everyone is entitled to their opinion but..

..TALKING ABOUT IT MAKES IT WORSE.

If you talk about something that was obviously made to get news or publicity, it's doing it's job.  You're pretty much just as bad as the people fawning over the object of your hatred.  So don't talk about it!  That's part of the reason why you don't see me post much in regards to what's going on in real life: it's been parroted so much that you don't need some 2-bit opinion about it.  That is the explanation I give before I commit some <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance"">cognitive</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXUlGnqUF4k"">dissonance</a>.

Ahem.

To all you complaining about Toyota's <i>Saved by Zero</i> ads: <b>STFU</b>.  I present to you an ordered list as to why you should <b>STFU</b>.
<ul>
<li> One, do you live in metro Detroit?  Okay, do you watch Red Wings games or Tigers games all the way through?  No?  Let me tell you how a Wings game goes: 8 minutes of play, 2 minute commercial break.  One of those commercials during that break is a Ford commercial.  The same commercial.  Over and over and over.  That means if you watch the whole game you'll probably see the same stupid commercial about five to six times.  And it doesn't even have good music like Toyota's!
<li> Two, if you're watching enough TV to get sick of a 30 second ad did it ever occur to you that you're watching too much TV?  Holy shit, go read a book!  Volunteer!  Have sex!  I mean, I sit on the Internet instead of watching TV but at least with the Internet <a href=""http://everythingisnt.com/faq.html"">I can block 95% of the ads</a> that I'm supposed to see.  The ones I do, I just filter out because I'm used to them.
<li> Three, you're not old enough to complain about the song.  The song was released in 1983, making it 25 years old.  Unless you're over 30, you probably have no recollection of hearing the song on the air.  And as we all know, anyone who blabs about endlessly on a blog is probably under 25 simply because they believe they know everything and that the whole world wants to know about it.  So, in essense, you're a pretentious dick-bag, go put on your mix tape of The Church and The Cure.
<li> Four, know what you're doing by simply blogging about it?  Not a Goddamn thing.  Probably promoting it, actually.  See my above rant.  If you want to cause some ruckus, write to Toyota's marketing department, write to your local cable provider, go light some Prii on fire, or fightclub it (aka, YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT IT) as it was meant to be talked about.  Do something useful.
</ul>

"event","Yesterday I went with a coworker out to the <a href=""http://www.brmconservancy.org/trail_map.html"">Bull Run Mountains</a> to go on a hike.  I was supposed to go duckpin bowling that day up in Maryland but considering that it was 70 F and sunny all day, I figured it would be one of the last warm days of the year and it would be better spent getting fresh air.

It ended up being a great hike.  Got to ride in a convertible out there and back, got to try out my new pair of Timberlands I practically stole for $30 from Macys, and to get some use out of my camera.  The shots you see (with the exception of #13, which was taken on the <b>foliage</b> setting) were taken with no flash, <b>vibrant</b> color setting, and the <b>cloudy</b> setting just to let more light in through a slightly slower shutter speed.

Notes about the shots:<ul><li><b>Shot 0</b>: the Chapman Family Cemetary.  There are more headstones there that I didn't take shots of.
<li><b>Shot 8</b>: a Canadian Maple.  How in the hell did it get down here?
<li><b>Shot 29</b>: is of one branch spiraling around another branch of a sappling.  I'm not sure if that occured naturally or if someone somehow guided it around over a long period of time.
<li><b>Shot 30</b>: the Dawson Family Cemetary.  There's maybe 3 headstones in that walled-off area.  However, further behind it, there's at least a dozen other smaller slate/limestone markers of some sort.  None of them are marked.
<li><b>Shot 32</b>: find the doe!</ul>

"event","I've been browsing craigslist for many years.  I was there before Rants'n'Raves was even launched.  Back when the w4m posts used to be all actual women.  I've bought many things from CL ads, I found a place to live in Detroit from a CL ad, and I've gone on plenty of dates through craigslist as well.

So seeing as how familiar I am with craigslist, I'm apt to notice the subtle changes in the ads, especially in the w4m or sales section (yeah, I'm a troll, deal with it).  Things like pictures of white chicks claiming to live in ""Detroit, MI"" were suspicious and rightfully marked as spam.  Or how some w4m ads would always list the measurements of a chick.  Or how in the cars for sale section, you have model year 2004 Nissans selling for $4,000 but listing an actual e-mail address in the body.  Just lots of little things, y'know?

In moving to Virginia, I've turned once again to CL to try and get some dates.  That means trolling the w4m section and seeing what is availible.  One cannot help but notice down here that there are TONS more educated and articulate black women than Detroit.  In addition, many of them are actually looking for white males.  This was surprising to me as metro Detroit is pretty damn segregated.  Hell, I've even seen a new abbreviation pop up in these ads: AA.  No, it doesn't mean they're a drunk, it means they're <i>African American</i>.

Here begins my rant.

You are not African American.  The whole reason that term was created - in my opinion - was so that we (white folks) could be more politically correct when talking about issues of color without actually having to mention color.  Sure, you're black because one of your ancestors came from Africa, cool.  But discrimination wasn't based on where you came from, it was based on your skin being a different color.  I mean, you don't see the few white Southern Africaners getting discriminated against, do you?

And what about all the white people running around?  Why aren't we called European Americans?  If you care to go by American-born generations, I'm actually closer to being considered a European than a lot of black people are to being considered African.

Okay, there is a bit of a disconnect when talking about other races.  For instance, Korean or Mexican.  Why aren't they called yellow or brown rather than their respective race?  Beats the hell out of me.  Maybe because it has to do something with their culture, ie, they still retain some of it.  One or two generations down the line, they are still speaking the native tongue at home, although not as well.  Maybe they still eat cuisine that is common in their culture at home, who knows.

The point is, why are going out of our way to single out a different race when there isn't one?  ""African Americans"" are just ""Americans"" same as us ""European Americans"".  Sure, there's different classes of both white folks and black folks but deep down inside, we're all Americans.  There is no need to pigeon-hole us further."

"event","I want you to think back to an early childhood memory: your fourth birthday.  I still remember mine despite all the booze and caffeine in years since.  It was a sunny June day in my backyard.  The sun beat down on the grass, mingling with shade provided by the two 30 foot tall Ash trees and their leaves.  Enjoying being the center of attention and just waiting for my presents.

I open most of them but am not prepared for my large present: a bike.  And for whatever, once I saw it, I decided to start crying.  I still don't know why I did.  Perhaps it was because I didn't know how to properly react.  Maybe it was that I realized I was finally growing up and would be required to conquer the unknown.  The world is scary to a four year old when you're taught to be frightened of everything.

So why the story?  Well, put yourself back in the shoes of a young child.  Didn't everything seem like something new?  The first day of school every year.  The halloween and Christmas parties.  The last day of school.  The seemingly short summer vacations.  Your first trip to the dentist or orthodontist.  First car rides up north.  First little league game.  First time in middle school.  First co-ed dance.  First time in high school.  First time behind the wheel of a car.  First dates, first kisses, first sexual advances.  Getting that acceptance letter to the college you wanted.  Cashing your first paycheck.  The first cruise in your new car.  The first time you tried alcohol or smoked weed or legally bought alcohol.

It seems to me that your first 21 years or so are pretty interesting.  It's always one new event after the other.  Compiling life's lessons and information in your own data bank, trying to educate others while making sure not to make the same mistakes twice.

But now?  What's left?  Marriage, I suppose.  Perhaps home ownership.  Maybe jury duty and raises and promotions and decreased car insurance rates and AARP letters and handicap stickers and penchants for yelling at kids to get off your lawn.

Is it just me or is life a whole lot more of the same shit different pile?  Maybe it's the fact that I'm lazy and that all the ""firsts"" I mentioned above are just kinda handed to you; you don't usually have to work for them.  Because of that, I'm having trouble finding meaning and purpose now.  Wandering around in a fog just looking for a landmark to tell me what to do.

Perhaps I'm asking a loaded question.  Well, maybe not loaded but the fact that I'm asking it should make you take a look at my general attitude toward life itself."

My first initial reaction to this was, ""Hm, that's easy.  Find out what their technical definition of 'sex' is and skirt around it nicely.  Once you're married, split the money 50/50 and donate to more worthwhile causes - like animal shelters, actual sex education (not the ridiculous abstinence bullshit), or single mother programs.""

Then I googled it up online to get more details.  Turns out there's a few more stipulations.  Like not being able to serve alcohol at the reception.  What the fuck?  Forget it, $10,000 is not worth all the stories that come from weddings where alcohol is involved."

"event","<i>Finally</i> got my Linux box up and running and in a somewhat stable state.  All that has been accomplished so far:
<ul>
<li><b>FTP</b> - I never knew setting up FTPs on Linux were such a pain in the ass, but they are.  And considering the protocol itself is just as outdated on any other operating system, it probably doesn't matter what OS you use if you want to run one.  I remember when I ran a Win2k box out of my parents basement with BulletProof FTP Server on it.  Had the thing up and running in less than an hour.  Linux?  It takes you a week or so.</li>
<li><b>Trac</b> - This is basically a wikipedia platform that ties into a repository of some sort (like a folder that contains a bunch of source code for a program that isn't finished.)</li>
<li><b>SVN</b> - A piece of software that controls versioning.  Think of it as a utility that manages who writes what and when in a file.</li>
<li><b>Backup</b> - I took a day and organized all the backups I had stored on an external drive and have sorted them neatly into their own directories on this machine.  I know there's plenty of bits there, not all of it generated by me, but that they have some sort of importance to be kept there.</li>
</ul>

Upcoming tasks I'd like to accomplish with it include installing a SQL database on it, install one of those productive screen savers like I used to have waaaaaaaaaay back in the day for SETI@home, perhaps start using it to serve up some pictures via my home pipe, and installing a webcam that allows me to check on my cats while I'm at work.  Yeah, that would be awesomes.

"event","One of the best smells to me is the smell of new and warmed plastic when using a PC you just put together for the first few times.

It takes me back to when I was still living in Allen Park with my parents.  I put my first full rig together probably in late 2001 or early 2002.  Parts strewn all over my room, boxes, bubble wrap, anti-static bags, foam peanuts, twist-ties, spare screws, user manuals; all there in a tiny ten by nine room.  It was a Windows box with a 1 GHz Duron processor, probably about 256 MB of RAM and an IBM DeskStar hard drive (aka, DeathStar for the abnormally high failure rate on the drives) which failed on me after my trip around the country in summer of 2002.

Since that time I've put together about three or four other full machines and done a few upgrades or amalgations with existing - but old - parts.  Not to mention the numerous shit-boxes that have been used to experiment with Linux but with failure results everytime.

Point is, smell is one of the stronger senses for me."

The annoying thing about doing lists like this is that most of the sites that have a location finder restrict you to only the locations they're in.  For instance, Jimmy Johns' website lets you enter in a city and state combo or just a five-digit ZIP.  If there's no store within 15 miles, they tell you to try again.  What the fuck?  Listen morons (not just JJs), whatever shitbox you guys are hosting has already done the calculation to the nearest store.  Otherwise, you wouldn't be able to tell me that there isn't one close enough.  So why not just return the five closest results?  Sonic's does but it's not like they need anymore reasons to visit one."

"event","<b>TL;DR version:</b> Don't buy it.  If you want to give <strike>Maxis</strike> EA some money, pirate the game and then buy a Spore shirt from them.

<lj-cut text=""Longer version"">
I've known about this game for years and the way that it was originally talked about made it seem that yes, the way you build your character in the earlier stages will affect how it performs or behaves in the later stages.  This is plain wrong.  Rather, it's the <i>choices</i> you make that affect what traits or skills you get later on.  For example you get different goodies for winning over all your enemy tribes by dancing and schmoozing them compared to out-right wiping them off the face of your tiny planet.

Then you get to the controls.  I will NEVER, EVER understand why a computer game will not let you change the key configs.  This alone is maddening.  It's not so horrible in that they try to minimize the use of the keyboard and force you to use the mouse to a degree, but it will be for the people out there that like keyboard shortcuts (read: leet micro'ers and power users).

And the micro'ing does come into play as the third and fourth stage (tribal and civilization) a bit as it tends to play like a Duplo-blocks World of Warcraft crossed with a Duplo-blocks Civ4 (ie, they're both dumbed-down and noobed-out).  It's a simple point-and-click type of game at this point that would be made much easier if we could assign our own keys to any damn function that Maxis had planned, but no, you're stuck using WASD (I'm an ESDF guy) and the carpal-tunnel-inducing mouse gestures instead.

But the space stage is even more intensive on your wrist.  Not only that, but it's not a ""sandbox"" type of game like everyone thought it would be.  If it was, enemy civilizations and pirates wouldn't be attacking my god-damned planets every 5 minutes thus keeping me tied down to a small circle of planets.  It's fucking furiating when you try and terraform, scan organisms, or complete quests but three different alerts go off telling you that Glorbo is attacking planet Medvedum in the Logicen starsystem.

Just google up ""spore space sucks"" and see everyone bitching about the space stage.  The problem isn't that it's too hard, the problem is that it's too hard in relation to the rest of the game.  I'm sure that the hxc RTS players will have no problem managing and solving the problems in their universe.  However, Spore is not geared toward that crowd based on the gameplay in previous stages.  The other stages are done with relatively quickly and there aren't really many secrets to them.  But then you get to the space stage and it's a fucking bitch?  It's like being on a toll-road where you have the EZ-Pass system where you just zoom through four sets of toll booths in the designated lane at 70 MPH but before the very last one EVERYONE has to stop and pay $1.00 in nickels and dimes.  Does not make any sense.

The final straw is the DRM.  Supposedly it's in there and yet it's not blah blah blah.  Either way, I'm in the far-left camp that believes there is no reason for DRM.  Why?  Take a look out there at the torrents and cracks for Spore.  Know what DRM does?  It only makes it harder for the legit customer to get something to work compared to the pirate who will pay nothing.  In addition, it's almost like a root-kit.

So, I'm selling my copy of Spore for a you-name-it-price.  Bartering is gladly accepted in various forms of sexual favors, porn, alcohol, various Japanese tchotchke, shot glasses, cuff links, used video games, and sterling silver.

"event","Among the many differences between Michigan and Northern Virginia there's one that I personally find refreshing: free parking garages.

In the want-to-be-urban planned-corporate-community called Reston, there are <a href=""http://www.restontowncenter.com/parkingmap.html"">SIX free parking areas</a>.  Six.  How comparable is that?  Think of <a href=""http://www.ci.royal-oak.mi.us/treas/prkng.html"">Royal Joke</a> or Ann Arbor's Main Street district pretty much openning up their garages for free.

It's just simply unheard of to me.  Mainly for the reason of ""how the fuck do they make their money""?  Someone had to have paid for that land and all that concrete, electrical wiring, piping, and painting, right?  Maybe the city gave them some sort of deal: erect a new office building and we'll pay you to build your garage?  Whatever.

The other reason would be how much of a current demand is there.  Right now, anytime I go down there, I never have a hard time finding a spot on the first level on the larger of the northern garages.  Sure, you might have to traverse up a few levels to find a spot in the smaller areas but that's still no big deal.  But all this means nothing without maths, right?

Hokay, so.. Reston's downtown (or <i>Town Center</i> as these folks like to call it) is an area comparable to downtown Ann Arbor in size and it contains 5,600 spots to <a href=""http://www.a2dda.org/parking__transportation/available_parking_spots/"">A2's (estimated) 2,100 spots</a>.  It also contains high-rise business developments, something which the bat-shit-crazy-NIMBY-hippies hate and will not allow in their city.  Reston's population is estimated at 60,000 whereas A2's is estimated at 100,000.  Doing some very simple math results in the fact that Reston's parking spots-per-person (0.09) is four times higher than A2's (0.02).  With this, I start to wonder, <i>where is the ratio at which municipalities or businesses start charging for parking</i>?

Another example of free parking is a hospital.  Those of who you have visited Dearborn's Oakwood hospital are aware that there is a parking deck to the rear of the hospital.  To my surprise, they charge for parking.  Doesn't seem totally right to me, but whatever.  Down here went I went to the ER at Reston's hospital, I noticed that their five-level parking deck doesn't charge at all.  A refreshing thought.

So what's up with this?  We know that southeast Michigan is car-centric but is there really that much demand that medium-sized cities and sururban hospitals need to charge for parking?"

"event","I decided to get my Wii back up and running (please check my <a href=""http://pillboxer.livejournal.com/79358.html"">earlier post for Wii codes of myself and LJ friends</a>) after it being out of commission for the past eight months.  What would cause me to give it such neglect?  It got dropped at my company's Christmas party and immediately started spitting out disc read errors.

Anyways, since I had moved and am using a new router and ISP, I thought I should update the wireless settings.  I do so but notice that it's abysmally slow.  I hop on the Internet via the Wii and the WiFi connection and do a quick speed test through Speakeasy's website.  I then do the same through my computer via an ethernet connection.  The pictures are below.

Un-freaking-believable.  My ethernet speed is pretty accurate (I should have 10Mb/2Mb) but the WiFi speeds?  My download is 17x faster and 5x faster via ethernet than WiFi!  I honestly have no idea why the WiFi would be that much slower but I have a good idea it's probably Verizon's modem-router combination.  Enabling WPA2 AES encryption wouldn't slow it down that much, would it?

Either way, I'm buying an ethernet adapter and running some CAT5 from the router to the Wii so I can start attaining somewhat expected speeds.  Now to buy some games that I can play online and I'll be all set."

"event","While probably slightly doped up on some pain killers last week, or maybe just the fatigue associated with being on a near-liquid diet, I believe I had a break-through as to what kind of game World of Warcraft (WoW) is.  Abstracting the thought which I had lead me to begin to categorize various types of video games.  I'm sure most of you would believe this has little to no practical employment, but I'm still going to go through and explain the different types and then tie them all together at the end.  Critism is appreciated.

There are a few different variances on what a game could be.  When I talk about <i>traditional</i> I would mean a game like <b>Super Mario Brothers</b>.  It's pretty obvious when you beat it and there's only one real ending sequence (besides the one that ends up with you starting all over because you died too much).

One step from this would be a game similar to <b>Kirby's Dreamland Adventure</b>.  You still have multiple levels to beat, there are multiple level-bosses to crush, you have a limited number of lives (to a point), you still have to defeat the end-boss to win the game, and there is one ending sequence.  However, this one also has a side objective: reach 100% complete on the game.  See, throughout the game there are little switches and hidden doors that unlock a special power or 1ups or secret sections of the level that you otherwise would not get.  So while the primary objective of the game is to beat the end-boss, there is a secondary objective of gaining 100% complete for the game.

Parallel to Kirby runs the type of game which contains multiple endings.  This is where you play through the game, making a series of choices (sometimes purposefully, others which are not fully realized until a later moment), which will affect events on the way to the end-boss or end-game sequence.  There are many examples of this such as <b>Deus Ex</b>, <b>Half-Life</b>, <b>Resident Evil</b>, and many many others.

The next three types are difficult for me to place in terms of levels (this one is 1.5 Mario Bros while that is 2.3 Kirbys) as I have not yet strictly set out the spectrum from which they are judged and placed.  So let's start out with one of the all-time classics that has been ported to countless platforms: <b>Tetris</b>.

I should clarify something before I get in too deep.  When I talk about Tetris, I am talking about the free-play gametype in which you try to achieve the highest score possible.  I'm not talking about heads-up play, or Type B in which you select a level and a speed and try to reach 20 lines.  Those obviously fall under the traditional type of a game.  The end-goal isn't always firmly defined in free-play.  At any given time you can go for most points, most lines, highest level, most time played, or most Tetris'.  The freedom of being able to choose your own end-game when coupled with the actual <i>management</i> of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetromino"">tetrominoes</a> turns this into a game that is indeed one step beyond the others discussed so far but are tied to the following types of games.

The next one I would like to discuss is sports games.  Again, clarification is needed here.  When talking about sports games I'm talking about an all-encompassing season within the game.  That would include a draft, trades, free agency, injuries, creating players, playing schedules, and things of that sort in addition to the actual games themselves.  Here you have the traditional scope of a game which would be to win whatever type of sport is being played.  In addition, you also have the management (there's that word again) aspect that surrounds the season and it's games.

Finally, we come to MMORPGs such as WoW.  These games, as I see them, have no truly end-game to them.  When you beat some incredibly tough dungeon or boss the game still continues.  When you max out your level you can still keep playing but you won't get bumped up any higher.  You can be one of the best players in PvP but guess what, more and more players are going to be gunning for you with their newly found levels and gear.  The point is that this type of game rewards management over skill whereas other games reward your skill in completing a task or goal.

I played WoW on a few friends' accounts for maybe a total of a year.  During that time, I never got a toon above level 45 (this was when the level cap was 60).  Even still, there were plenty of tasks to accomplish dependent on what I felt like doing.  Did I want to grind XP?  Okay, where should I do that?  What about an instance run?  I would get loot in addition to XP.  With the loot I sell, I could make money to buy items I need for whatever craft I was doing.  I only need items x and y to make 10 more of this really high-profit item.  Or I could get those by accomplishing quests.  Maybe I just want to explore and see what the game has to offer.  These were things that I had to struggle with and prioritize based on what I felt like doing that day.

Which brings me to my point about tying these all together.  In the working world, proper management of your time becomes an important factor in getting things done right and on time.  Is there a link between how successful a person is in WoW and what kind of work they do in real life?  Maybe it's not even their work, but how efficient they are able to function in day-to-day tasks."

"event","So I'm sure some of you have heard about the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider"">Large Hadron Collider</a> getting ready to fire up later this week.  The reason you've probably heard about is because of the supposed doomsday scenario that might play out.  Once it gets going it might supposedly create strangelets or black holes.  Because everyone is familiar with black holes (familiar in the sense that people are aware nothing escapes from a black hole), that seems to be what everyone is freaking out about.

Just doing some poking around online, I doubt that a black hole will be the end of us.  But what if it was?  Imagine that this machine gets going and a year or two somehow generates a huge black hole.  But imagine that it's not us, it's another civilization out in the deep reaches of space.

Think about all the black holes out in deep space.  Now imagine that yes little Suzy, there is (or was) intelligent life out there.  Suppose that they evolved just like us over thousands and thousands of years except they somehow did it sooner than we here in the Milky Way did.  Then they came to the same point in time: we need to smash together some particles to see if we can discover these theoretical sub-particles that might give us more insight to <a href=""http://www.superstringtheory.com/"">String Theory</a> (One Theory to rule them all and in the darkness bind them..).  So they fire up the machine and the last thing before it happens was probably some scientist going ""What could possibly go wrong?""  A black hole consumes their planet and starts it's process of doing whatever they do.

So what I'm saying is what if all those black holes that have been detected thus far are all that's left of a civilization that destroyed itself trying to become all knowing?  Yeah, far fetched but it's always fun to think about the what ifs..

EDIT: Apparently I was beaten to the punch about this theory, by no less than Arthur C. Clarke.  I was <a href=""http://www.kressworks.com/Science/A_black_hole_ate_my_planet.htm"">reading an article on Kress Works</a> found by clicking through many links on Wikipedia when I came across his idea.

But once I moved downtown, I changed my address.  I also became employed at a job that resembled something I went to school for.  As such, I had money (and a new credit card) to buy things.  This meant using NewEgg to build myself a much-deserved new rig.  I also became a fiend on this police auction website, snagging any watches that caught my eye.

It was while living downtown that I realized there is no standard way to deliver a package.  The USPS differs from FedEx which differs from UPS which differs from DHL.  Not only that, but it differs on the driver and the complex, as I'm finding out.  Sometimes I'd have packages waiting in front of my apartment door, occasionally I'd have a note stuck on either the lobby door or my mail door saying they delivered the package at the apartment office.  What the worst was, however, just delivering it to the office.

When they deliver to the office, they don't tell you.  They just update the order, mark it as delivered and head off.  This wouldn't be so bad except the office doesn't tell me they've received a package for me.  They'd receive it and just let it sit there until I'd come and pick it up.  Think about this: how hard is it to look up a residents file and place a simple 40 second phone call letting them know a package has arrived?  It's not!  You're already signing for the damn thing so that means you've already interrupted whatever you were doing, so you might as well follow it through.

Now the burden falls on you to actually get the package.  Which if you have a ""normal"" office job that means you won't be home when they're open.  So you either have to take time during lunch or leave early-early one day just to get your package.  Fucking frustrating.

What brought this on?  Well I took the second half of Tuesday off to get FIOS installed, which it is.  Showed up on time, had to rig a few things, but now it works.  I was also scheduled to receive a new computer desk as I gave away my old one before I moved out of Detroit.  I sat around waiting for it.  I checked the Staples order status site a few times but still no update.  It was not until I got home today at 6:30p that I checked the site and see it had been delivered at 4pm the previous day to (hopefully) someone in the office.  What the fuck.  So not only did I not receive it Tuesday but because this leasing office carries short hours (10a - 6p) I don't have it tonight either.

"event","For those who may not know, I currently have two tattoos.  One on each forearm.  These were inked at separate times.  So when people say that they are addicting, I agree.  Despite the pain associated with them (it's like a cat scratch over and over and over) I find myself looking for new ideas and new places to put them.

One such idea was having my paternal grandfather's name tattooed across my shoulders.  The font that I would use would essentially be scaled up from one of his many blueprints that we have from his drafting days.  The explanation behind this would be more of a personal ""We stand on the shoulders of giants"" kind of saying.  Without him and his love and sacrifice for my family, I would not be where I am today.

But why would I get this?  The guy has been dead for over a decade and I still think of him whenever I see my grandmother so why do I need a tattoo of his name?  Applying this to other people, why do they get tattoo's of peoples birth dates and expiration dates?  Or put the decals on their pickup truck (it's rarely a sedan or coupe, trust me) of some dead relative - or worse - Dale Earnhardt (that's a whole other post in itself).

I think it gives us some sort of meaning or some sort of baseline to try and follow.  In my case, he would be a person I want to strive to be: funny, knowledgable (""Never say your car is broke""), outgoing, a provider, stoic, etc.  I think those are all traits I wouldn't mind having.  But what about the stillborn babies or the hooligans?  Are you just going to pull their good traits and forget their bad ones?

But why do we need this sort of guidance?  Are we that much lacking in faith as a society that we need to pin our guidance on dead persons?  Oh wait, we already do.

EDIT:  Reading through <a href=""http://postsecret.blogspot.com/"">Post Secret</a> this week I found this secret.  Guess I'm not the only one who has noticed this trend:

Anyways, pair one.  Rubber soles on the old pair started to wear down, the black leather (maybe, it's kinda fuzzy) was turning white from running around in the snow for a couple winters, and I felt I needed a new pair.  These Cons run a little big too.

Then, I saw a pair of Penguins.  Hadn't really heard of them but then I realized that I probably would had I been in a fraternity at some point in my life.  So why did I get them?  Simple.
1) They look like bowling shoes (at least the Plum/Dark Blue ones did)
2) They have plaid on them
3) They have Penguins on them

"event","I'm heading to Milwaukee this weekend.  The reason for this trip is to do a kitteh swap.

See, I have two cats, Murray (spazoid) and Tucker (chillax-o-tronic).  Murray annoys me to no end.  He has recently decided that those little receipts you get after using your debit card are fun to play with.  So he jumps up on my desk or counter looking for them.  Or how he likes to pull down maps, which are about 4+ feet off the ground.  Or how, when Tucker is on my lap, will swat and nibble at Tucker's tail until he jumps down at which point Murray will jump in my lap.  Or how he seems to attack Tucker at random.

My friend Lynea has a similar situation with Wobbls (a litter-mate of Tuckers) and Scott (a cat they picked up to keep Wobbl company after another litter-mate of Tucker, Weebl, had to be put down).  Wobbls needs attention 24/7 and that includes from other cats.  Scott, on the other hand, does not want to play at all with Wobbls and will smack Wobbls a few times if he tries.

So I proposed a trade.  My rambunctious, but adorably cute, Murray for Scott.  We both end up keeping the cats we have emotional ties to (we've had Tucker and Wobbls since they were born in August of 2004), Wobbls gets another piss-and-vinegar playmate, and I get another cat which will allow me to COMPLETELY cover my new apartment in kitteh fur.

I hope to be back Sunday.  Wisconsin beer will be purchased and passed around.  I will post pictures of Scott when I get them.  <a href=""http://shnozwanger.org/pictures/murray/"">Here are some pictures of Murray</a>.  You can tell that most of them were taken awhile ago as he looks tiny compared to Tucker.  The last picture is only a few days old and you can see how big he's gotten."

"event","Those of you who have known me for longer than four years should remember times when I was meek and timid.  When I just went with the flow of whatever was happening and didn't voice any opinion.  When all I wanted to do was just make people happy.

And think of me now.  I might've grown a pair of testicles.  I'm not quite so shy, I might make demands once in awhile, and I might just tell you what the fuck to do.  But how does this make me a bad person?

When I was younger and growing up, all I wanted to do was to make people happy.  I always went with whatever plan would inconvenience everyone the least, even if it meant putting my own well-being or best interests in the backseat.  So long as everyone was happy and I wasn't stepping on toes, so be it.  I was quiet because I was unsure of what to talk about.  What do others want to talk about?  Is this alright?  God, I'm a horrible listener and do not really notice the small things.  I'm socially inept.  Crap.

Now?  All I talk about is me.  Me me me me me me.  Ever since I graduated college - something that I thought I'd never do - and got a job-job that allows me to live downtown in a rennovated building, I feel like I've been slightly empowered.  <b>Fuck everyone else, it's my turn, dammit.</b>  Maybe some of my mindless drivel will inject some conjectures or insight from others in the group.  I want others to know how well I'm doing despite coming from a one-parent, food-stamp home (if you know of any one that uses this as an excuse, fuck 'em).

But in honesty, I think that I talk more about myself simply because I have more confidence in me and my actions.  I'm still socially and conversationally awkward: I'm never sure how to start a proper or casual conversation nor how to keep it going.  So instead of me just being quiet, I tell about things that I am comfortable and familiar with: my interests, my future happenings, what I heard about lately on Slashdot, what I just bought and so forth.

So if I ever get carried away, please tell me so that I know to correct myself.  But be fore-warned that I will let you know when your ass gets out of line yourself."

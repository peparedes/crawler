"event","Ok, lets see where I should go with this post. After starting school I've finished Med Admin as you knew from before. I passed A&P with a 4.0!!!! I did it, and showed them who's boss. The whole class was a bunch of whiners, with a few serious people in the class. Only 3 other people got A's in the class. And a lot of the younger people seem to be clicking, but I'm finally clicking with a few of the people from wal-mart. I got invited to a halloween party, by Mike n John, the csm's at work, and I think I will go. I've been hanging out with Jen from work as well. On Saturdays mainly that is, and we've been joking around at work a lot more too. 

Now for the better part of this post. I've finally met a guy I think I might be able to call 'The One' someday. I didn't want to give him a chance in the beginning because I was talking to a guy I clicked with, online from Alabama, Sam was his name. Yea there was a lot of things we had in common, but he lied to me about being single, and then from that I decided to give a new Matt a chance. He had been very sweet online, asked a lot of questions, seemed to be really into me and really wanted to get to know me. So I decided to meet him and I had a great time. He took me to friendly's, and I beat him in Mario Kart, the big topic of debate between us. We even kissed briefly, it was awesome, but I still wasn't sure I was really into him. At the end of the night he asked when he could see me again. And everyday after that, he said he really missed me, and I was taken back by how much he seemed into me, it was a bit scary. But I went out on a second date, and he still didn't seem to be the one for me, but I really enjoyed his presence, and I still liked him more than just a friend. 

So anyway, I told him I needed a guy that even though I need someone soft and sweet on the outside, I need someone a bit more aggressive in the sexual field. And I found out that he likes being aggressive in bed and said he'll try to be a bit more expressive. So when we got together the next time, sparks were flying, we really clicked, and the time after that even better. I just saw him today and it was the best day of my life, despite the fact that my little brother broke his arm and is in the hospital. He needs surgery in the morning, he'll be ok though. So I can't wait to see Matt on thursday, hopefully he'll ask me our then, he wants to make it special, so I'm willing to wait, we're basically together anyway. He says he can see us being together for a long time, possibly marriage and kids. So that really appeals to me and I'm hoping it does happen. Well I'll get back with an update soon."

"event","Ok well. Lets see, I did end up joining the service as and Advanced Electronics Field (AEF) Surface Sonar Technician (STG) with an 8,000 sign up bonus. I think I might change to nuke if the corpsman job doesn't open up in time. I've decided to end things with Matt simply because he doesn't know where he wants to take things with us, and I don't really want to be strung along as his personal entertainment. I really did like him, mainly cause of how much time I was spending with him, things are getting a bit easier now that I haven't been seeing him as much. I went upstate to visit my friends and got two tickets, one for speeding 70 in 55 and one for window tinting. Then to top it off, I backed out on getting laid and Shaun wants to do things with me, and I'm very nervous about doing anything with anyone. I've been trying to be pretty void of all types of feeling and just trying to get through A&P + med term in one piece. Oh yea since last post I started school and I passed my first course, med admin. and it was boring as hell, I got 100's on all but one test. The other I got a 98 so it was a joke. This A&P seems to be a bit tougher and I'm loving it already. I can't wait to prove I can get a 4.0 GPA no matter what. They'll see, I'm not just a fucking failure. I can and will do it. Well that's it for now."

"event","Ok well, hrm how do I begin. Ok a lot has happened in the past few weeks. What has it been? Two? Ha well seems like much more. Lets start out with whats been built upon the last post.  Mat. Well he went to court and got it rescheduled so that he can prove he paid off his tickets and get a lesser fine, but that also pushes back his enlistment date because they can't take him until he's clean with the law. Which gives me another month to see how things are working between him n I. He keeps saying how I'll leave him with in a month. We'll he'll be right if he keeps saying things like that, I think he doesn't believe that a good girl could and does like him. Or just thinks he'll end up pushing me away with his so called 'evil' ways. But so far he's been a complete sweetheart, and sure he may have some faults but I do too. And unfortunately I'm going to quote a movie, that which is rent, because I feel it is a great quote to live by in relationships. ""I need baggage that goes with mine"" which I think is a very wise thing to think about considering no one's perfect. See I feel his bad boy ways helps me feel more comfortable in the way I act, with my anger, and I can tolerate anger so long as I'm not struck or my possessions are not broken. I asked him to give me a month to see whether I would leave him or not, and thats what I'll at least give him, cause this is now two weeks in and I don't have that plan at all.

Now for some partly related updates, since his talk of joining the service, I've thought more about it again, and found out that if I get my medical assistant certification, they can get me an E3 pay grade, and I can go in as a medical corpsman. After serving my 4 years or what ever it is, and I drop out, I can become the physician assistant that I planned on getting, but with no debt. I like the sound of that. I gotta go see the recruiter sometime soon to talk to his superior and see what else can be done. Well guess there'll be another update soon."

"event","Ok well.... to start off me and rob broke up. It was the distance it was killing us, plus I lost the sexual attraction to him. So I've been single for a few weeks and yea its now 3 days shy of our 4 month marker. Oh well, but I've been working at wal-mart and it's been ok. It could be better, I got asked out by a customer, that didn't go so well, he wanted a bit more than I was willing to give the first day, so I kinda let him go. 

Now here's the interesting part, one of my co-workers from another department began talking with me in the past two weeks. And he even followed me out to my car two nights straight. We just kept talking n talking. Well we exchanged s/n's and spoke the next day online. The next night we went out to a friend of his' party and out to the diner. We also went to Lake Ronkonkoma and I got over 30 bites between my legs and arms (20 on one leg). That's where we first kissed, and finally there was something that light inside me when I kissed him... but it had to stop or I would have been sucked dry of my own blood.

So anyway here's the scoop on him, he's 24, 5'11 and 160lbs. He lives with just his dad and works full time as a stock person for wal-mart. He used to drink heavily and do drugs but recently came off the drugs and cut back on the drinking. He also smokes pot on occasion but that's not a big deal. And just yesterday, on Sunrise, his car broke down and now has a lot of repairs to pay for but can't afford it due to traffic tickets and court dues he needs to pay. For a while he's been thinking of joining the service, and has decided on the Navy as the best choice. He's using the Navy for a job, and an education. 

This is what worries me, the enlisting part. Meaning I will hardly be able to see him, especially in the first month n a half... boot camp. And I really do like him and want to see where this goes, he calls me a worrisome one. That he thinks I might be the type of girl to tie him down. He's more of a free spirit and it scares him to settle down.  But he says he feels something with me and I'm the only thing giving him a lil hesitation about joining. He failed the drug test a few days ago, I think he'll fail tomorrow too, but if it does show improvement from the other day they might still take him I think. Then the question becomes when. When will he leave, for how long. And when will he be back and can I wait? He wants to go in for 4 years, I want to be married in 4 years. So I don't know if I should waste my time on someone that seems to be going in a different direction as I am in life. Then again it would be hot to have a guy in uniform, it would just make me want to join all over again though, and I really don't want to go through that again. I guess only time will help for now,... Update coming soon."

"event","Wow, today makes it an official 2 months, with an unofficial month behind it. I wasn't sure things would last this long and I'm very nervous about what will happen in the coming months. So let me fill you in on why. Two to three weeks ago Rob came downstate to visit me and mom and I fixed up the upstairs a bit so we could sleep up there. After my parents got to meet him for a bit I asked their opinion, and mom said she really likes him but not me. And I both knew and didn't know what she was talking about. Apparently I was almost using him and being very bossy and taking advantage of his kind heart. So the next day I tried to change that and mom said I was a lil better. So yesterday when the family went to the beach for the 4th of July, I asked her what she saw in the future for me and Rob, and she said she'd rather not say..... So I asked why, and she said she doesn't think it would matter who the boy is right now, but that the way I am now no one could or would want a lasting relationship with me. And we got into a long talk  about me and I really wanna change how I am. I want to be happier, not get upset at the little things, have fun, and be kinder to everyone and everything. She says, 'that's the first step, 'recognizing it''. So now I gotta try and maybe even seek professional help. But Rob cheered me up last night saying he loves me unconditionally, and there's nothing I'm doing that's upsetting him.  But I told him I'm going to get better regardless. He really is so sweet I want this to last a long long time. Everytime someone at Walmart is pregnant or has baby items, I think of him and what could be and I'm so very happy. I just hope things really do work out. Right now my plans to go white water kyaking were ruined, and I got really upset about it the other night, but now I might just go see him a week earlier since he gets an extra day off that week, and well I have off anyway so it might just work out better that way in the long run any way. Well I think I've said everything I needed to for now, be back in 2-4 weeks"

"event","OK so we made it one month and I have to say things are going better than expected. He gave me a scare in the beginning, with the talk of being lonely and acting all weirdish on me, but things went back to normal after a couple of days. I was very nervous about seeing him for our anniversary, not because of the day it was, but just because I was afraid I  might have lost some feelings for him because when we spoke over the phone I was never really in the mood for dirty talk but he seemed to get pretty aroused ;) lol. Also, I was due to get my period any day but I went up anyway. When I finally saw him, I was like damn, he looks goooooood!! I'm with a hot one hehe. But all that aside, he was at work so he pretended I was a customer and showed me around the store for the last few mins of his break. After that we went back to his house and he got me a bunch of small gifts with a pirates theme. It was adorable, I loved it so much, and he had a whole skit planned out, my heart melted. I gave him his card and little wallet card with words about how much I cared about him, I have a part two of his gift at my house and I saved it for another day. The next morning, I slept in while he worked at the bakery, and I heard him get home so when he came up I surprised him by grabbing him from under the covers. That day we found out about an amazing camping spot that his boss has out in the woods behind the shop, it sounded a lil sketchy to me but when I saw it I was amazed. It had a fire pit, and dry wood on the ground and a perfect spot for a tent, plus a ravine nearby with waterfalls. We set up the tent and explored and saw a baby fawn sleeping in the grass. Then we left for Cameos, a small cute restaurant with good food, for Rob to play at. He looked so cute all dressed up and even though it was a lil dull I still enjoyed it. So after that we packed up, went and got the rest of our stuff and began the hike back to the campsite. We made a small fire and got changed, got a lil hot but I wasn't really into it. I felt bad when I didn't finish him but I was very tired and we went to bed. The next morning after warming up with more blankets, he made a fire and we made popcorn and then went a got some food from the bakery, he paid for me too. I started to think I could see us together in the long run. After chatting a bit, we went back and got a lil hot and I was into it that time, and I was able to finish him and I felt proud and content and happy. Everything was perfect, but the funniest thing was before we got started I found a tick on his balls lol. The we went hiking a few miles through all the brush just exploring and it was amazing all the things we saw. Anywho, Jean-Marie, and Kevin came by after that and we took them to the ravine to go swimming, the water was cold but we stood in it for a bit. Then we built a big fire and made smores. I had to get going but it was just so much fun plus, they were taking for ever to clean up haha. So after getting something to eat for dinner, (we got pizza) I finally headed home at 9pm already dark. The parting wasn't as hard as it was the first time. I'm hoping thats just because we're used to it, but we also know I'll be seeing him in under 2 weeks when we comes down to visit me. That's gonna be fun, I'm really looking forward to that. I'm getting the upstairs all clean for it and gonna be moving up there. Well enough of the rant, I probably would want this to end by now, when I re read it back haha, so um year next update will be at the two month or after he visits in two weeks"

"event","Ok, so I met this guy Rob from upstate in late march/early april and there was a small connection between us over the internet. Well I went home for Easter Break and there was this other guy I was  flirting with since mid february. So while home we hooked up and had a pretty fun time. But physically he wasn't my type, and on top of that he hadn't had a job in a while, but he did have a pretty good reason. 
    When I got back to the college with my car I continued to talk to the guy from upstate. One night while at work I jokingly said, why don't you come an visit... well he did just that. And well he was deffinately more my type, shorter, fit, dark hair great teeth, better smile and eyes that were always radiating light. Because I was so confused I didn't flirt as much as I normally would, but things were going pretty well, he slept over nothing happend but we enjoyed the weekend together. He went home and didn't really think I liked him, which wasn't the case I was just confused.
    After much thought, and a couple of dates later (time laspe about a month), Rob asked me to be his girl friend and I accepted. I was falling for him fast and was kind of scared as to how this was going to go. I was very nervous about starting a distance relationship since when I am home, we're 3 1/2 hours apart. Every waking moment, and even some of my dreaming moments I think about him. I've fallen in love with him and plan to go see him once a  month and he's sopposed to come visit me as well. I can't say that I'm not worried he won't visit like my last distant relationship, but  I have a good feeling about this relationship. And I feel confindent it can and will work. 
    So I'm writing this blog because no one sees it and it can serve as my guideline to see how things are progressing over time and I can look back and see exactly what I was feeling. I really care for him but I am afraid to get hurt. I saw Brian yesterday and he tried to kiss me and I turned away. I felt bad but I really care for Rob and I really am going to try and make this work. I just hope I don't mess up again."

"event","Well each day is getting better with dealing with the pain of losing someone I had feelings for. I do realize he had things to figure out for himself and I'm leaving it up to him to contact me again if he ever so chooses. My heart will always be open for him be it friendship or still possible relationship at this time. But on a lighter note I get to register early, and get the first pick at my classes and I have a co-signer again so I'll be staying at siena! Whoop Whoop"

"event","Well this shall be my frist post ever one lj, even though I've had it since what was it now April? Well that doesn't really help me now but I'm back at Siena and have recently becomed very confused. After watching the Disney movie Mulan, and contemplating my relationship with Keith, I have realized that though I still do like him, I cannot bear to be alone away from his for so long. And recently, my fancy has been struck by a few people, though one a little more than the others. I hope to begin seeing more of him soon, but we shall only see what happens in time considering I have a feeling he knows that I have a boy friend but I don't think he realizes that it probably won't last too much longer.... cause I'm making it into an open relationship and if that doesn't work it'll be a complete break up. I guess I'm tired of being alone and depressed unless.... well we'll save that for another time. I guess I'm done ranting for a while, I'll talk about later if I ever write another post."

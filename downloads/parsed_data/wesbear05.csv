Replacing this pain with something numb
It's so much easier to go
Than face all this pain here all alone

Something has been taken
From deep inside of me
A secret I've kept locked away
No one can ever see
Wounds so deep they never show
They never go away
Like moving pictures in my head
For years and years they've played

If I could change I would
Take back the pain I would
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would
If I could
Stand up and take the blame I would
If I could take all the shame to the grave I
Would

Sometimes I remember
The darkness of my past
Bringing back these memories
I wish I didn't have
Sometimes I think of letting go
And never looking back
And never moving forward so
There would never be a past

Just washing it aside
All of the helplessness inside
Pretending I don't feel misplaced
Is so much simpler than change

It's easier to run
Replacing this pain with something numb
It's so much easier to go
Than face all this pain here all alone"

"event","Life... Something that never fails to amaze me... it's when you begin to realize, how people see you, and what they think of you when they hear your name, when they see you, when they talk about you... For that 99% who just sees the wes, it hurts now to know what they think... and for that 1% of those who love me (as a true friend or more) and knows me for me - that's.. like ... the only thing that motivates me... Though fighting against that 99% really is hard... to sum it all up, i feel like, everyone sees me as an Asshole... I feel so unwanted now... I feel like i'm constantly out of place unless i'm with certain people... I feel hurt... But it's my own fault... So i appologize to all and to my-self...
   I guess i still have a lot of figuring out to do ... I still need to apply for college... i'm so late... I'm afraid i'm not going to be accepted to where i want to go ... I'm afraid thing are going to work out... I really, really wish i could leave HS right now... Things are falling apart and i hate it.. I want things back together for me... I really wish they would just fall into place... But life is definitely a HUGE obstacle for me... I'm trying my hardest... Then again for some things i need to tr a little more... 
   Anyway... I just got back from Allie's, and we had a good time... Too bad the fire wasn't lit... ;-) ...

He said he had a professional grade recording studio right there in the building... So we said yeah we'll definately do that... We were syked about that... Our CD / Demo will be out early october... We'll be in the studio September 25th... It's something i've been wanting to do forever... And now it's happening... Finally...

"event","it's about 2:30 AM . currently... and yeah ... Justin and I just finished running from what we thought was the police... We were setting off Fireworks, and Firecrackers on the golf course... Aw man it's GREAT ... But yeah anyway ...

So we've been working our asses off all night to get new song ideas and what not... We decided to bring back an old song called ""Life's Story Board"" ... Some people may remember this.. Such people as Nadine, Allie, and Bethany... I think those were the only people who heard it... It's a good song we realized ... So we are bringing it back and it'll be up on the net ASA we're done tonight... Then we're re-writing the lyrics to our newest (actually our first) song... Lyrics weren't quite right.. So we are working hard on this stuff... We're headin' out next week to buy some new mics, for better quality... 

Yesterday was my dad's b-day ... I bought him Red Neons for our boat to give it some life... Looks pretty good... the interior is all red now.. hehe... Then he took us out and we went wakeboarding... YES.. WAKEBOARDING... Don't know what it is? go to myspace off my profile and go to other pictures... there's a picture ... SO yeah... I was doing pretty good... Jumping some waves, havin' fun ... Wypin' out... OH yeah ... Until..... I Jumped a wave, and i landed but the boat dipped forward and caught a tiny wave and flipped me... It also SPUN me like hell.. As i flipped over, i popped my Knee out of the socket, (it went right back in) and i'm sure i tore something or broke somethin'... It's hard a HELL to walk... But i can, and It HURTS ... Heh. Specially when running from Cops on the Golf Course.. LoL ... But yeah that was fun till i killed my knee.....

So the past week, and 1/2 ... Kinda hektic ... <b>Allie</b> WAS in Florida for Fricken <b>TWO AND 1/2 WEEKS</b> I missed her like hell. .  ... I dealt with it... Besides some certain incidents that happen... I don't wanna talk about that, but it upset me pretty much ... I'm ok now though ... I guess... 

THEN .... Me Mike, Matt, Krista, Dave, Josh, Lauren, Bethany, and... Kristen, went to West Chester University for 'Band Camp' ...  It was pretty cool actually... Seom Really good musicians, then those of who, who want to be good... The marching band played the mask of zoro arranged by jay Bocook... Which he himself was there teaching us... It was great, he's so amazingly talented... Then i met this AMAZING trumpet player... One of the teachers at WCU.. He was wailing notes higher then i've heard before... he was an AMAZING player... Incredible...  I think the Marching Band was the only group that had fun... bethany and them were whining the whole time... LOOK AT MY TAN LINE, I WANNA GO HOME... Hehe it was funny... ;-) Matt and Krista i THINK had fun ... I dunno didn't talk to them much.. Whenever we were  leaving the Cafe. they were coming in haha... Josh and Dave had fun i think ... We met these two 14 yr old guys, who were pretty fun... they were nuts hah... Cool guys though...  

Then the day we got back i dropped off Bethany, then left a little later to go to the RiverSharks game to see/hear Bethany and 2 other girl from her church, sing the national Anthem... I JUST made it hehe your lucky bethany! i heard them, but didn't see them... Atleast i heard them .. :-P Heh that was pretty fun until a foul ball almost nailed us i nthe head over on the eating/sitting area where we were chattin bout stuff... She Randomly Screamed and i'm like What? and then a look behind me and a ball falls like 5 ft behind me, and flies on the edge... the security guard wouldn't let me get it.. Grrrrr. 

The day allie got back, she came over that night... We had Lots of fun... Tackling her in a quilt, strolling the golf course... watching movies... Yeah.. good ol' times... It's nice being with her... I love talking to her... She really understands me with everything... well there is ONE thing she doesn't understand... which i actually don't either but... anyway... MUAH !!

So now i'm jsut chillin'... actually kinda gettin' tired.. But i wanna record this song.. so i'm gonna... C~yah"

Allie's been in Florida for 2.5 weeks now... and i hate it... I miss her so much... But i'm making it ok i guess... 

WCU (West Chester University) Band Camp was from monday till thursday... It was fun... I met some cool people... Lisa, the other lead trumpet player was cool. She was a good musician as well... Better than me i must say... She was fun to be around... Though we didn't really talk THAT much since we were working the whole time with the band and all... then there's a cool person Alison... She plays clarinet.. We starting talking after i poured water on her head at the little water break area.. Hah, that was comedy... Then there's Evan and Brian... Cool kids, both 14 but fun i must say... They were in our dorm hall. and we all just went nuts the whole time... we had 'story time' one night, that was great.. pure comedy a lot of the time... Then we just messed around the other times... SO yeah the dorms were NOT air conditioned, so it was hot as hell, so we went around looking for the rooms with air conditioners, and we were going to rip one out of the window and put it the hallway for the floor air haha... Then we were also going to get a soda machine and wheel it up to our floor by the elevator... hah.. That WOULD have been great.. but we never got around to it... So anyway... Jay Bocook (A Professional and workd known arranger) worked with us most of the time... he's AMAZING at what he does... Incredible... then just all of the staff that worked with us... it was GREAT !!! I learn a little, more so towards the breathing aspect... I played so well why i was there... so i'm hoping i got better from that experience... Then thursday i got home and went right over to the Riversharks Stadium to hear bethany and 2 other ladies sing the national Anthem... They did good... I barely made it to hear them sing. but i DID make it... That was fun until beth and I almost got hit by a ball while we were sitting over at a bench chattin' ... Yeah next thing we know a baseball flies from the feild to about 5 Ft. from us and flew over the edge into the parking lot... I was like.. Whoa WTF... Haha. Bethany we almost died !!! hehe.

But i'm home now and yeah... bored again.. just kinda chillin' every day trying to figure stuff out to do... October Falling - my acoustic band in case you didn't know - is doing really well.. we're getting a lot of hits ... It's great... 3 more songs are recorded right now... but i just need to record the lyrics now in my studio... So we'll see what happens this week... i guess that's all for now...

"event","Last week or 2 i've been in Florida... I'm home now... Really don't want to be...
   SO about <b>Florida</b>... we were there for 10 days, and i was just... Great... I can't wait to move... IF i move... The first few days Justin and I just chilled around the island a bit then we rented Motorcycles for the week... MAD fun, doing burnouts, skidding to a stop, and doing wheelies for people walking around downtown... That what we did also, is walk around downtown... Bought a few things, like sunglasses, and small stuff... We went to the beach (downtown mainly) pretty much everyday... There were also a few storms throughout the week, which in fact were awesome... The house we stay in each  time we go down is right on the bay (Check it out - Two sided house. Justin and I had the 2 story to ourselves www.henrysunfun.com ) and the sunrise comes up over the bay and looks awesome... Most of the storms that hit Ft Myers Beach come from main land and comes across the bay to the island... So imagine seeing a wall of water from rain coming towards you... Looks SO awesome... So we had a lot of fun riding the motorcycles around, except when we almost slammed into TWO different cars hah... Damn FL drivers... or maybe it was us NJ drivers... HAH... i dunno... so we spent most of our time on the beach or at the pool... Then finaly we rented Waverunners for an hour... I Love Waverunners so much... They're so much fun... Atleast one huge ass boat drove by, and i jumped a wave that sent me soaring about 10 Ft. into the air... When i hit it i was just laying on the gas so when i flew off of the wave, i started to tilt backwards... I almost landed Vertically, straight up, in the water... It wasn't scary but it was Fun as hell... Then we were just foolin' around o nthe Runners and were doin' 360's and such, and we did race (i won)... but i fell off twice cause i'm crazy...  I would pretty much just do 360's at full speed, and broadside a larger wave, and it would throw me across the water like 25 ft away from the runner.. Heh, the second time i hurt my elbow pretty bad... But i didn't really realize it until we were done on the runners... Cause then it hurt like a mother... So yeah that's pretty much it... We had a lot of fun though... Oh yeah we wrote 3/4 songs while we were down there too... One is almost done, and should be upon the website ASA tomorrow... So keep lookin' and checkin' up... 
   While we were down there, we looked at two colleges rght in Ft Myers.  Florida Gulf Coast university and Edison Community College... I'll be going to one of them...  They're both NICE... 

<b>Allie's</b> leaving tomorrow for FL for 2 1/2 weeks... Should be interestingly lonely and strange not having her here... I guess i'll manage.. I hope.. <3
<b>Bethany</b> Came home from NC the day i left for Florida, and i saw her yesterday which was nice... I missed her... :-P  I hope we hang out alot the rest of the summer... She's lots of fun
<b>Ashley C.</b> I miss too... i wanna see her cause she's one of my closest friends and i never see her... Miss yah Ash! 

I guess that's it... Check out October Falling's PureVolume site and just look around... Some pictures are going up... See everyone later

So everything is going pretty well i guess you could say... I'm making it pretty good... I must say... that, my past life which was thse 2 years, i do look back on sometimes... No i'm living from the past, or the present... I'm living for the future, BUT... The past is what builds you up to prepare FOR the future... My past has defiantely built me up to be posibly the strongest person i never thought anyone could be... And it's almost been a year now since everything diminished... From the whole Wes Bear Cotastrophy... My family built up SO much Stronger... But i feel like we're breaking apart again... Which, i don't really like... Considering i <u>might</u> be moving to FL next year (A year from this or next month) and being away from it all here... Yeah i DON'T like this town mainly because of the Gossip and the over-all Atmosphere of things, but it is my current home which is why i try to make the best out of it... I jsut hope the losers who tend to say stupid things to try and make themselves look good, will stop eventually... There's no accomplishments in gossip... Live from experince, and love and ""don't dig up the past cause all you get is dirty"" (Minority Report) ...SO there you have it... ME... What's on my mind... Thank you to all of those who are in my life... All of us individuals, are Teachers... Whether it be just showing up and being there and occupying space? or it be a best friend whose been there and whose vented and whose always make a difference... EVERYONE is a teacher... So be yourself... Don't let others' standards effect <b>your</b> standards and <b>your</b> life... Set a goal and reach for it... That goal will pull you in faster then you think it will... <If you make life touch, then everyhting with you will be easy.. BUT if you make everything on YOU tough, LIFE will be easy>  Choose which one you want.. I haven't decided yet.. I've been in-between... Set that logical goal and go for it... If you don't reach it, look back and look at the experience and accomplishments you HAVE done and past...  If you think about it, it's Amazing isn't it? I guess that's all i wanted to say ... Thanks For Taking the Time to Read...

"event","Well. . . Everything with MY life is getting better. . . Although it seems as if it has transfered to my sisters life... Details NOT included. . . But i'm here for her, just like she was for me when my life was a shithole. Hah. . School is ok. . . Me being the music-type freak i am, i tried out for Chamber Choir, and next year's schedule should be so easy ... only 2 major classes, Math and English and of course GYM, which is.. just stupid and Easy and Boring. . . Yyyyeah. . . Marching band already started for next year. . . This show will turn out awesome  (i'm hoping) .  .  . 
 Friends. . .
   Well <b>Allie</b> is still my closest best friend... We talk constantly, and yeah we do fight occaisionaly, but ou know WHO doesn't ? and we always work things out. . (Even if fuckin' rumors are spread about me and Bethany)
   <b>Ashley Cheesemen</b>... Wow, you know i didn't think we'd talk so much, but we do talk alot moslty online and more and more in person everyday. . . It's always nice to have someone to vent to and have her understand a lot of it... Which is odd considering i'm like 4 years older the her. . Hah, but she vents to me ALOT, and i just love helping people with their problems (as i've been noticing, i actually DO like helping people out) and i like being there for her... Ash? DOn't forget i'm always here for you... ! k ?
    <b>Bethany</b> and I are really close too... We spent a whole weekend together at Lauren S.'s Shore house... It was fun.. We talked SO much just walking on the board walk or beach and just lounging around. . . We came home early on sunday, had breakfast, and then she fell asleep at my house. . LoL. . and i was on the computer waiting for people to sign on. then I took her home.  Cause her mommy wanted her home. 

<b><u><font color=""#ff0000"">PROM </font></u></b>
    yeah, it was fun over-all. . . Danced with ALlie 95% of the time, and the other 5% was with Bethany. . . Pictures were at my house, on my front lawn cause the golf course is a good backround. . . Then we got in the <u><b>PORSCHE CEYENNA</b></u> . . HELL yeah... this SUV is the NICEST SUV i have ever seen. . . i won't get into it right now... hehe... Justin and Amelia came over  for pictures too. . . (If you want to see pictures just tell me) THen off to Prom we went... The food was OK . . and the Hotel, was NICE. . . the DJ sucked though. . . Not enough dancing songs. . . but ok.. i'll deal. . .

I guess that's it for now. . . Enjoy.

"event","Thoughts of me. . .

   What to do. . . With just. everything. You know? Where to start where to end how to do this and that. . My Grades are finally skyrocketting. . I brought my enlish grade up from  an F to a  B . . and on this report card i only have one C . . all rest A's and B's. . That's considerably good for me . . . 
   So what's running through my head. . . I really don't know. . But what i DO know is that stress is leaving me. and I'm changing. . Dara C. noticed today . Direct Quote ""Wes what's wrong with you. . You're really nice today and you are usually a dick, haha"" (in the jokingly manner) . . And i finaly put the mental vision in my head of how i want to be. . . I'm not going to change my-self anymore to fit in with people like in MB. . If they don't like me for who i am then that's their problem . . Yes indeed i am a very outgoing person . . But i'm going to not be mean anymore to people. . . Like in my previous journal. . I don't hate anyone. . AT ALL. . Yes that does go for some certain people. . (Those of you who are my friends know who i'm talking about) . . 
   For those of you (mostly everyone i talk to) who are wondering about me and Allie. . Here i go. .

   We're not going out right now. . I broke up with her because there was a huge stress factor coming into my life again. . I will straight out say i will NOT deal with any stress. . Stress and Anxiety already played a huge factor in my life and i will not let it mess me up again. . . Why do you all think i'm so skinny? (Remember: I'm trying to gain weight) It was just begining to be too much. and i began not to care but then i realized if i did that i would be telling my-self i don't care for her and we tried working things out while we were going out but. it didn't work. . . So i didn't know what else to do. . . . And in fact. I do care for her A WHOLE HELL of a LOT . . . She knows this. . And if we wind up not going back out, i'm never leaving her side. . She's my best friend now, and will forever be one. . I'm sorry Allie. .

   I don't know if you have seen, but recently i put up an away message ""Dreaming of a Dream"" . . Merely meaning that i'm dreaming of getting away from this place. . to Florida . . Where i will be living in a year from this June. . 
   I brought that up because,
  Do you know how it feels when you go out somewhere in your town, and feel like people are staring at you and saying ""There's that bad kid every one has been telling us about"" or SOMETHING along the lines of that?. . Well. Welcome to my life. I feel like i can't go anywhere, but Allie's, Bethany's, Justin's and Ashley's House Without me feeling like i am not wanted. . . I feel so un-comfortable sometimes that i don't even go to someone's house for a party with people i know. Or i can't go places with anyone because i'm that bad person everyone sees me as. . (And i feel like they look at me even worse NOW because of the car i drive too)(it's LOUD) (All of this comes from certain people who are trying to ruin my life . . Which is about to backfire in their face. . ) I'm putting up with it though. . I just hate how i feel like this all the time. . People have been saying i'll be running away from my problems by leaving and moving to FL. . . That's where those of YOU, are wrong. . I won't be running away from anything. . I don't have a problem with anyone here. It's everyone here who has the problem with me. . So you could put it as taking their problems away from them. . And yet again i say, i want to start a new life . . I want to live my dreams. . The ONLY way to live. . But mostly i'm moving for ME. . First of all i LOVE Florida. I travel there 1-2 times a year for a week or 2 at a time ever since i was little. . and everytime so far? I've LOVED it. . Soon enough. . But for now? I'll live here in NJ. . With my friends who i DO have. . I guess that's all that's on my mind right now. . Thanks for taking YOUR time to read my thoughts. .

"event","Where to start. . 
  Things with me have been hell, then heaven then Hell again. . I know i'm hurting someone, and i hate the feeling. . I can just imagine how others feel about it, let alone her. . . Sometimes I wish i could start over in life, and be a quiet person . No worries, no friends, Straight A's, And then grow up and get that dream job i've always wanted. . . But then i think of people like, Justin, Ashley E. , Allie, Bethany, Colleen, and Nadine (Gettin' better). . They're always there for me. Troubles, and no trouble they're my best friends. . . But Things have still been running swiftly through my head, and i don't know which thought to catch with my net . . It's all confusion and Pain and Worry and Anxiety. . . I was at a party on Sat night, with the Cast of ""Pirates of Penzance!"" and i was having a blast, until people started coming up to me and asking me about Allie, or Bethany, and asking me what is going on and that just, makes me drop all emotions and makes me want to cry. . . (Kind of like what i'm doing right now . . Tears slowly rolling down the cheek) It's Cinnaminson that makes me cringe. . No one in the right mind can keep within' their own lives. . Everything is about someone else. . One major person being me. . . I'm one of the major gossips around town. . . Sometimes i can't handle it. . Specially if it's about my past life with my X. . . Those 2 years were a waste of time, because now it's just a memory, and Sometimes i just wish it would fade away. . . It still hurts inside when i think of certain things. . But the pain is normal to me now, like an addiction. . Pain never leaves me. . 
  I wish sometimes an answer could just jump right up into my ear and whisper what to do. . I'm sure we all wish that could happen at times. . But it doesn't. . The most logical answer for me? Is Moving to Florida. . 
  I'll being moving no matter what now. . It was blindly in front of me but i realized even if i DON'T make it into FGCU right away ? I can still go to a community college for a year then Transfer into FGCU. . .  Get a goo job, buy that condo with my Bro - Justin, and Live the new life i've been looking forward to. . The Sunny beaches, awesome sunrises and sunsets on the Gulf Coast. . . and Not Knowing Anyone. . . Maybe i'll change the way i am when i leave too. . No matter what happens, i will never ever forget those of you who WERE my real friends here in NJ . . But listen. . One year left, lets make it the best. . . 
   Speaking of Florida. . 10 days. . Spring break is almost here. . I can't wait to leave this town for a whole 8 days, and feel free again with no worries. . I will definately Miss My Real friends, Allie, Bethany, Colleen, Nadine. . 
   I can't say Ashley, because i'm Staying with her. . Which i'm very thankful for, saves me a lot of money, and less hassel. . (Thank Ashley and the Enyarts !!!) I went up to NY City last Weekend to see Ashley. . man. . . Did memories Fly by my eyes when i first saw her. . The Cruise where we met. . Never ever forgetting that, i met the most amazing people on that cruise. . Ashley, Amy, Dan, Josh . . The good Times. . I'm so glad Ashley became my best friend. . she knows more about me then MY-SELF. Heh. . Weird aint it ? So yeah Me and my Father had Dinner with her family, and Ashley ? Your dad was definately more open this time i saw him Haha, he's funny and Fun. And GENEROUS - you rich brat. . haha . Can't wait to see the rest of the family again and get on those Sunny beaches and Hit miami beach for a day - Me and You justin !! You know how we're gonna do it ! Haha, Hell YEAH . . . 
   The Drama Show was this past weekend. . . Hence the word Drama. . . I hate it. . Within' the music / Drama Department there is way tooooo much drama going on , on the inside of things. . . Mostly Me. . Obviously since i'm the gossip topic of the lifetime. . 

   To Allie. . . I'm sorry. . I know you tell me not to appologize. . But i have to for what i'm doing. . lately i've been thinking of everything i'm dealing with, Stress and Anxiety can not be a factor in my life. . It makes me unhealthy physically and Mentally. . Why do you think i'm so skinny, and i have those attitudes where i flip out over nothing. . Then it leave because i realize i'm being the asshole everyone sees me as. . . I do Love You. . I just need time to . re-coupe my-self into life and make me decide what i really want. . Don't hold anything that i'm doing against yourself. . It's me . Me being the stupid person i am. . You know what i'm talking about. . Jealous etc. . I'm sorry for everything right now. . Just give me time. . That's ALL i ask from you. .

  One year + 3 months. . . and the countdown begins. . . To when i'm leaving for good. . . For now i will deal with everyone's Shit comming to me. . . Maybe i should change. . I guess i should take my own advice. . Don't let one to 100 people make you sad because Trillions of others don't know who you really are. . And i know i'm a good person . I'm not a bad person at all. . The only people who see me as a bad person are those of who see false errors and rumors from those of who can't run their own lives so they run their lives off others so they have a basis in living. . . But i'm going to try and stop letting those types of people get to me while i'm here in NJ. . . 
 
   I guess the last thing(s) i want to say is. . .
        I'm sorry to all of those who i am mean to, etc. . From my heart i don't hate anyone. . Everyone is a great person in their own individual way, and i think i fail to see that sometimes. . . Please jsut know i have noting against anyone at all. . . i DO mean that . NO ONE. . . 

   I guess that's all i would like to say right now. . . If i think of more. . I'll write. .  Goodnight to all. .

You just don't realize how much you hurt someone, until regrets hit you in the face. Love is something that shouldn't be taken lightly. It has its ups and down. Im sorry for everyone I've hurt or had to deal with blaming myself. I never meant to hurt anyone and now that I did, my life has changed. I find myself alone, wondering what im goin to do with my life. If only I had someone to actually care about in a loving way, my life would be a whole lot better. Until then I need to deal with the hurt inside and the blame on myself for causing all that has happened.

I wasted two years with someone who didn't care. But now i'm with someone who i don't have to make that distinction. . I Love You Allie!!!

So Yes. Everything is Great !!!"

"event","Well where to start. . Christmas Eve.

I was at allie's all Christmas Eve. It was a great night. . (yes i'm overlapping Entries). . I loved it. . Allie's family was down in the Basement watching a movie, while me and allie sat in their family room, in front of the fireplace. . it was HOTT but just wonderful because i love spending time with her. . We just snuggled a while and talked a bit. . i almost fell asleep next to her, which is rare (sleep) but since i was with allie, i felt warm and loved and i'm just so comfortable around her. . .  i love lookin' into her eyes. specially to see the fire reflecting back at me, and then seeing 'i love you' fly bye through her head. . and.. i'm gonna stop now. . . heh don't want to get TOO mushy. . though i DO love her to death

Christmas Was good. . Digital Camera. . Clothes, Games, CD's, DVD player for da car,. . it's all there.

next few days were good. . EXCEPT ALLIE NOT BEING HOME !?!? I missed her to death. . I only really got to se her twice over the WHOLE break. . . 

New Years Eve. . Oh man. . . we made some drinks with this mix someone brought over. . Then i just had some SoCo and a Hurricane mix. . It's pretty Good. . Allie wasn't aloud to come over which kind of pissed me off. . . She kept hinting to her dad that she didn't want to go. . . But her dad just pretty much said NO YOU'RE GOING WITH US. . . SO i called her at 11:58 (heh) and i couldn't even hear what was going on cause where she was it was loud. . So i said happy new Years and I Love YOu and then we hung up and she called me back later. . . I really wish she could have come. . I wanted to spend more time with her, and i wouldn't of been drinking until she left. . But oh well. . Still Love You Allie !! And of course EVERYONE i asked to come over bummed out on me. . Allie, Nadine, Matt, Mike, Andrew, Tom, Bethany, Mark, and whomever else. . Britt A. came over for most of the time. . THen left at 1:30. . Then Colleen stopped by for a bit then my dad kicked her out ... so yeah...

New years day. . I went to bed at 4:00 AM or so, then woke up at like 9:00 to go to Lancaster PA to my cousin's. . From there i drove me him and his gal 3 and half hours away to her parents house i nthe poconos. . Yeah . . . . So we went skiing Thursday Night. . It was empty. . No one was on the slopes. AT ALL. . Jeramie's (my cousin) g/f Bridgid's Nephew went with us too. . He's 16. . He was snowboarding for the first time. He did pretty good. Until he broke his Collar Bone. . yeah. . that sucked. we all had fun though. it was great. Friday we chilled then left back to Jarmie's house. . We wound up staying at Bridgid's house. . so yeah ..(The whole entire Trip i couldn't get my mind off Allie. . i don't know why. . Just, everywhere i looked, SOMETHING reminded me of her. . I just couldn't keep my mind off her. . ) then we slept then i left around 1:00 or so. .  I put over 620 miles on my car. . Heh. Pretty good huh ? YEAH. . Then i saw Allie :-) :-) :-) I was wanting to leave Lancaster so bad just so i could see her. . I missed her like anything. . I love you allie !!

Sunday, allie called and woke me up to go to Drama at noon. . i was like ok. but of course i fell right b ack asleep. lol showed of a half hour late. hehe. then left cause i didn't need to be there. then i realized i wish i would have stayed cause i couldn't spent more time with her and saved her from the scary people. (you know who allie). . and that leads to today. First day back to school. HELL and BORING. . ugh. I hate english and my english teacher... what a fricken bitch. .

Ok i'm done

Allie's in NY right now with family. . The day she left i started to miss her like hell . . i hope to see you as soon as she gets back. . it's just hard to be without her. .

Christmas Eve - I loved it. . Allie's family was down in the Basement watching a movie, while me and allie sat in their family room, in front of the fireplace. . it was HOTT. We just snuggled a while and talked a little bit. . i almost fell asleep next to her, which is rare (sleep) but since i was with allie, i felt warm and loved. . (less the warmth from the fire) - i love lookin' into her eyes. . and.. i'm gonna stop now. . . heh don't want to get TOO mushy. . though i DO love her to death

Christmas Day was good. . I got a mini - DVD player for my car, bunch of CD's, clothes, Digital Camera, DVD burner, and other small stuff. . That evening we went to my aunts house for dinner, then i met m parents at allie's house. . Our parents chatted for a few hours, and me and allie played darts, and talked, and she was helping matt burn an MP3 CD. . 

Allie just called :-D  - She sounded like she was falling asleep, so we hung up. . One of the first things she said was ""I miss you"" - i love it when she says stuff like that. . Causes me to kill off the worry more and more. I Love you allie !

i'm pretty tired considering i was up till 6:30 last night (this morning) - i'll write more later

.:Wes:.

P.S.
Allie. . . .   MUAH love you sweetheart. . I'm so glad you're in my life. When i'm with you , you make everything else dissappear but us. . I feel at home with you. Which is why i hate being away from you. . Thank You. . For Everything. . Don't forget that i'm always here for you. . . I will never leave your side. ."

I'm so blind to see,

Paranoia that kills it silently,

What have I turned you into?
Into hating my heart as it feels,
Silently it turns dark blue,
I'm hoping that it soon heals.

My heart is in the shallows,
Looking for you, in the deep,
Which could take this lifetime,

Thursday was Turkey day and the football game with our last MB performance.. I went over to Nays for a little while i met her cousins and otehr fam. members. . then went home and chilled as usual . Saturday i was at Allie's for a while helping polish silver kitchen stuff for her christmas decorating. heh. I wanted to see her so i went to help out. Then we wound up just chillin' round her house and talkin' and what not. I love being with her. . That night was the Y100  FEASTival. Damn it ROCKED . . From what i remember. :-D THe pit was crazy. I got into a mosh pit the second i was in it. i just jumped in and then i randomly got punched in the face.. haha. but it was good. Cause during 311 the last band that was on, me, justin, andrew, and erin pushed our ways to the railing! It was awsome. (Ask me for pictures if you wanna see.) so yeah that was awsome.. Sunday was just another boring day... I wanted to see allie.. but noooo she wasn't aloud. So now it's been 2 days without any allie time !? NOOOO !!! I'm so used to seeing her in school. i started heading to her locker after 7th per. and got half way there then realized she isn't in school cause she's out with a fever. and headache and what not. . Also these 2 Army guys came to me today talking to me about the army. My fircken parents forgot to hand in the form to tell them not to recruit me cause i'm 18 and still in h.s. UH OH. . but ok. i'm supposed to meet up with them on Thursday. . Oh wait. i can't . College. DARN what a shame. :-D aight well i'm gone. LateR

Yet i'm feeling put back together, by yet another individual. Allie. . She's always there for me. I'm glad she is, and I get mad at her for the stupid things, like flirting with other guys. . . I do get very Jealous, i admit... But don't i have that right?Just the Fear creeping into my head saying ""she's going to leave you so she can date other guys"" . . But NO. . I can't believe that. . She looks me in the eye, and i want to start crying because i feel guilty for putting her down internally. I wish i could make her 100% happy. . . But now we're ok. I spent a lot of time with her and her family today. . Helped her mother with her laptop and network(LAN Router) and I ate dinner over there. . Her mom likes me! hah. . It's a good thing. right? eheh I don't know what i want to do with my summers now... I was planning on moving.. but we'll see. . I'm sorry to you Allie for getting so jealous and making you upset. I didn't cry today I swear. . And Sorry to Matt. i know you're uncomfortable about me and Nadine. . You know i don't look at her more then a friend. . I can't. i don't know it's just.. Imposible. She loves you. TRUST ME. . She never shuts up about you. . . Don't ever let her go. . Once you stuck your foot out and tripped her, MAN, did she fall fast and hard. . She loves you. . I'm sorry for any pain and confusion Matt. . I don't want to ruin anything at all !>period<!

That's really the only problem right now. But it's alright. It's on both out parts. We both know not worry but about eachother and our opposite sex friends. But it's still there you know? But it's ok. I'll get over it all adventually. Just give me time. I'm glad we're together. We have lots of fun together. :-) muah

As for the Nadine issue. Those of you who think we're more then friends need to grow up. I know who some of you are and since Allie and Pete are such good best friends, shouldn't you suspect they're more then friends too? NO. WE ARE GOOD FRIENDS. GET OVER IT! fuckers.... Wait what am i saying? I'm Wes Bear. I'm the guy who plays all the girls right? I'm the one who fucks peoples lives up and i'm  a bad person! Of course what am i thinking! and now everything revolves around me being best friends with Nadine. NO. You people don't get it. You don't know anything about me. NOTHING. I never screwed anyone's life up. They make their own choices. Maybe they change FOR me. but i don't change them. I'm not a bad person. You just have to get to know me. Which no one does. You're all from Cinnaminson. The gossip town of the world. Go ahead talk i know how i am, my parents know how i am. Allie and Nadine know how I am. I'm not a bad person at all. But what am i saying, i'm posibly moving schools next year. My mom brought it up after i said how much all of you C-Town people talk about me behind my back. And the same with all of your parents. You know maybe you don't know it, but it fucking HURTS to know you AND your parents talk about me behind my back. YOUR PARENTS. Give me a fuckin' break.  NONE of your parents know me. NONE of them. Allie's and Nay's Parents know me. and guess what!? THEY LIKE ME. They are better then you and your fuckin' parents. . They don't judge me by rumors. I respect them for that, and i get respect in return. I know it's not (for some of you) boith you AND your parents. But A LOT of it <i>is</i> your parents. And you know maybe if you all would take time to get to know me, you'd know how i realy am. Oh well THAT'S never going to happen. Because i'm such a bad person. Try putting yourselves in my position. That's all.

School... Grades are finaly increasing because most of the dilema's are over... But i still wish i could get away from all this. But i can't leave... Allie. Nadine. and... Justin - (Though Justin is probably going to move with me.. so we can start our business... Yes. I'm talking to him a bit more now... It's still uncomforting that all that happened... It's all just the matter of trust... It's coming back. slowly but it is) - So yes. If i left i wouldn't just be starting a brand new life. i'd be leaving the most important people in my life. Plus my family. But i don't knwo what they're doing.. So whatever. I'd leave now if i could and i didn't have those people in my life... I'm so afraid of hurting anyone.. I hate it. Yes, mostly everyone knows that. And now after this everyone will know that. I hate myself when i hurt anyone.. I hope for the better as always... I hope everything will turn out for the better now as it is.. Things are happening over-top one another and it's building up not only in me but my family as well.. It's all going to disappear.. I know it. Things are feeling better.. I'm so afraid for Allie too. and Nadine.. Allie because IF i wind up moving next summer, i'll hurt her... and posibly her family. and Nadine because her surgery(s) are soon. and i want to be here for her. She's my sis.  I Love Her like my sis... Soo the word of the week is Hope. Hope is a good thing in most cases. So always hope for the better. Ok, I'm done.

Me and Justin recorded a bit more and advanced the song right along. adding parts, like harmony, and guitar 2. That morning i woke at 10:00 AM... Then that night, justin came over at about 10:30, and we stayed up all night, just listening to music, and i was working on my program for my College Computer class. once 4:30 hit, we drove out to the new Chick-Fil-A in Delran. It was the Grand Opening and the first 100 people there got tickets for one FREEEE meal a week for the next year. HELL YEAH... and of course me and justin were # 54 and # 55... So we waited there till 8:30 to finally get our passes.. We got free food and dirnks while waiting... but the waiting killed us. and my car battery. haha we played PS2 while waiting... i had to call my mom to come jump my engine cause it was dead. hehe.. but we finally got our tickets... The rest of thursday was tiring... i went right from Chick-fil-A to the H.S. to help with Drama. worked there for a while.. Then i had my college class. i had my midterm test. All i had to do is DeBug a program. It was so easy. there were pretty much only 3 mistakes, though the last one was hard because the equation for the calculation this program makes, was getting an OverFlow error. took a little bit, but i figured it out adventually... Then i finally went to bed at 2:00 AM the night(morning) which made it a total of 40 hours with no sleep... yes i know i told some of you i slept for 2-3 hours before my class, but believe it or not i couldn't sleep... I was just on the net surfing e-bay forever. and ate more food. then dinner... so yeah... 40 hours, a new record... i'm gonna go to 48 = 2 days... Maybe over thanksgiving break. we'll see... Friday, i woke up, went to band, then to Pete's soccer game cause Allie wanted me to go. And Francis was there and so was Brit. H.. then i came home. went out to dinner with dad and then watched Matrix Reloaded (only not in my car this time)(haha)... So yeh. Now it's 11:42:34 at night, and i have championships tomarrow.. Hershey, PA. gotta be at the school at 6 fricken :30 ... I'll be sleeping (as long as SOMEONE doesn't tickle me... ALLIE... NAY... MIKE - LoL Aight. well this is a nice long update. i'm done.

Some things are NEVER expected from those like Justin. heh heh. You da man. and Nadine acualy danced a lot. DESPITE all her pain, she still held through. And she was barely able to talk as she told me today. It went really fast to. It's like i was taking pictures with all my friends, then the next thing i know, i'm driving home from Mikes at 2:30(1:30 really).. But yeah it was fun. It wasn't like it used to be though.. it felt like just another dance. NOTHING like Prom. . But yah it was fun... 

Hey Nay-Kid. When are you gettin' your 'bone-r-emoved'. Haha. Yeah the good times with my sis sis. you awsome sis i luv yah ! So yeah sunday i didn't do ANYTHING... It was boring. I woke up tooo early after gettin' home late (well.. not that late acually.) and yeah.. then i went out to some chinese restaraunt.  It was pretty good. Then stopped at Nays for a few to show her my pictures and then went home and Chilled the rest of the night and SLEPT... And of course like always i woke up at 4:00 AM... I don't sleep anymore... I don't know why, i just don't... I wish i could, i need it badly. but it's just imposible now. Some one help me! Ok so yeah now i'm running out of words to say. I'll update in other couple of days.

"event","Relaxing is probably the best thing for me right now. I love being calm and in a the relaxation mood. You know? Nothing to wrry about but someone walking in and bothering you, and you being extremely nice, and scaring that person because you're not normaly that nice. But hey. I wish i was nicer sometimes. I've lightened up on some people lately. I really don't like being mean, and i HATE hurting people. It's not right, and i hate myself for ever hurting anyone. But life moves on. I'll be leaving next year for good. Yeah i'll be back once in a while to visit. But that's it. I feel like it's a good time to start a new life. But i guess i should stop talking about it. Back to Cinnaminson life. I feel like i'm making new friends, and i don't know why I am. I love it yes, but where is it coming from? Marching band i guess. it kind of pushes people together. 
Well i know my topics here are a bit sparatic, so sorry. If you want to know more about some of , any of these topics tell me. i'll tell more. For those of you who ARE my friends. Thank you. For being there, and i'll be here for you in exchange. have a good night to all. LateR

"event","Well.... lets see. Weekend. Friday? I chilled all night and just hung out and did whatever... OH yeah, i was at Nadines for a while just chillin' and playin' her Geetar and shtuff. Saturday was a football game in which we acually won! It's really amazing cause we really suck.. but that's another story for another day.. Then on Saturday Night!? OH MAN. <div style=""text-align: center;"">THE STARTING LINE CONCERT</div>

Yeah. It was Crazy Fun. Senses Fail, the first band, was awsome! I was crammed in this little area (as usual - it was at the Electric factory) and i see a mosh pit formed to my right. I was just thinkin'   'fuck this shit' and pushed everyone outa my way and jumped right in.. I was flyin' around and goin' crazy till this kid kicked me in my schin and my leg lew out from under me and i fell flat. it still hurts now like when people (or my CAT) sit on me and when i walk up stairs and down stairs and when i just regularly walk.. OUCH. THEN. I started to get dizzy after the second band (so i left and went to the back to get some water and chill for a minute or two... Then justin came back too after the next band. Then we went back up. and we pushed our way through to the front left again. THen like 4 more circle pits formed and we jumped into those and just hittin' people and people punching us and it was nuts.. During the Starting line, justin gave me all the shit in his pockets, and i boosted him up and he crowd surfed a few times, and flipped over the security guard. Haha it was great, and the first time i lifted him up, he knocked my phone out of my pocket and i walked back through the crowd o find Heidi, and i realized i was gone.!? I ran back through shoving people outa my way and found my phone in like 3 parts, the main screen and keypad, in front of me... then the battery all the way over to my right... then the clip way over to my left...i was FLIPPIN' out. hah. people were yelling at me and were sayin "" what the fuck are you doing"" and so ijust told them to shut the !#@$ up. :-D ...My leg and shoulders still hurt. So yeah that's Sat Night. 

Sunday !?. HOMESHOW ! we did ok. could've done better as i always say. My section needs a lot of work. i need to teach my first trumpet players to projecta little more.. The judges always tend to say ""good job trumpet"" or ""good trumpet solo"" when it's NOT supposed to be a solo. Yeah now i have TWO solos right? My regular one and the rest of the show. :-D Heh. so yeah. we did ok . 

My B-day is in 24 days !? !? !? can't wait. BIG 18 HERE I COME !!!"

"event","Well. My busy scheduled Business day week has ended. Fridays are my free days now. Acually Tuesdays are too since i dropped GEB (Golden Eagle Band). But hey Friday is Great. 
My day was pretty simple. School, with my usual 3 periods in the band room. I was just chillin' around and doing nothing. Except 7th Period. Which i need to explain.
 <div style=""text-align: center;""><b><font size=""+1"">Y100 FEASTIVAL</font></b> !!!
<b><font size=""+1"">November 29th</font></b> 
<b><font size=""+1"">Tweeter Centre !</font></b>
<b>I bought tickets during my 7th period study hall. i think i have one left to sell. so tell me ASAP if you want it. $48</b></div>

So yeah...  after school i just, went home. worked on my car stereo a bit. See if i could reduce the rattling from my subs. i had a little success. I have to tweek my sound parameters a bit to get the correct sound out of the correct speakers.. I need to buy sony 6x9  3-way speakers for the rear of my car. The stock ones are 6 inches diameter speakers and DO work pretty well... but i'm afraid of blowing them. so i need to upgrade. but i dunno. that can wait. I need a job. I need a new beggining too but first i need a job for a while. (OK... I'M SORRY{non-obnoxiously} . But i really can't stop thinking about leaving this town / state...  I wouldn't wanna leave several of you. i could just pack you up in a suit case and carry you along. ) ALSO

<div style=""text-align: center;""><b><font size=""+1"">Clarion DXZ535 FOR SALE</font></b>
The CD player doesn't take in the CD. All you'd need is a CD changer . Not that expensive. i'm looking to get 100 for this unit because it is top quality.
So IM me or something.</div>"

"event","Hey well yeah... SOOO much has happend in the past week i don't knwo where to begin... Besides Life acceling at it's own rate and having me unable to control it, everything is... hm, peachy. Confusion plays a role, not as much as tears and sorrow. Being scared to death is not fun... Breaking down and falling to our knees and crying your eyes out while covering your face isn't a good thing. The next thought is ""I have to get out of here."" and that doens't go over to well either. But it's all life. Everything turns out ok as always. Well Nadine is now officially one of my new best friends. AKA 'sis' . :-D We hang out sometimes when she isn't smoking .. i mean taking her nebulizer treatment(spelling correct? i dunno? scary sounding though) or looking for her ankle/foot braces. And HOPEFULLY she'll get me a parking spot at school cause of her surgery soon. I'll praise her. Heh. Other then the new best friend, everything seems to rise and fall. A LOT of falling lately, but hey. i'm dealing with it.. Band is ok. You know?

It's not great. But good. mostly ok. Some people say it's like their other family...But, i'm sorry to say i can't say the same and agree. I don't belong here. I don't feel comfortable here anymore. I did. When people acually liked me. Now it's like people are turning against me and trying to get people against me... I don't feel right here anymore... My home is with my heart, and my heart belongs where i've always wanted to be. Florida. i've been down there once or twice every year since i was, oh... Little. I've never stopped liking it. But College is a good posibility there as well. The college i'm really looking at requires 12 transfer credits which is odd, but hey i should have 15 or so credits coming out of HS. I would like to start a new life. Start over, meet new people, but yet, bring a few of the people here. (Mike, Nadine [OK - matt can come]) (heh) Because we just want to get away. but hey. One more year yah know ? It'll be a breeze. Nothing stands in my way. Well maybe a couple of things. But back to being a family. I would like to thank those of you who ARE there for me and support me through everything. Justin, Heidi, Nadine, Colleen, Mike, Allie, Bethany, Ashley E., and a few more, (if i forgot you tell me)... Thank you all for being great people to me. mostly Justin. Thanks for being my bro. (breh) You always seem to tell me to shut up and stop worrying WHEN I AM worrying about something. but hey it works you know? You da man. Thanks man. And Heidi, we've been through everything. You'll always be here and i'm very very grateful for (you) that fact .As for everyone else. Thank you. So much. I wouldn't be in Cinnaminson still if it wasn't for you.. 

P.S. - Those of you who don't like me? You shouldn't be reading my journal LET alone this last line.. So Leave me alone. I don't waste my time with losers who have nothing better to do then talk behind my back. LateR  :-P

P.S.S. - My B-day is in Exactly one Month. :- )  18 here i come"

"event","Why does everything go wrong with me? I really, really don't get it. I always tend to screw things up. It's just my nature i guess. My appologiez don't seem to work anymore... I guess because my obnoxious ""I'm SORRY"" REALLY kills my in all seriousness ""I'm sorry for what i've done. And I regret it."" But hey. I guess this is my life. Mistakes happen. and quite often at that. I've thought about just emptying my bank account and leaving forever to my future home.Ft. Myers Beach, FL. But, then again what would that accomplish? More and more sadness not only in myself, but in a few others. I've also been thinking about changing schools for my senior year and posibly the rest of my junior year. mainly because people constantly talk behind my back. and some things i hear, and it hurts. a lot at that. So what now? Where do i go? What can i do? i guess I and everyone knows the answer to that. NOTHING!. Of course that's me being blinded by the obvious.(<~~hint hint) So whatever. I""m just a screwed up person. Or you COULD call me - Normal."

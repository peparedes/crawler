"event","yeah so my girlfriend came to my house fri. and we were really in the mood to have sex. so we did it in my room with my door open and my parents in the living room watching tv. They didn't walk in on us, thank god. but when we finished i threw the condom on the side of my bed b/c i did not feel like getting up. i planed to throw it away once i got up, but i forgot. so the next day my dad was vacuuming and i went to take a shower. when i went in my room i remembered about the condom. i went to pick it up and it was not there:o|. my dad did not say anything until tonight. he wasn't upset with me. he just told me ""i am glad you are using protection"", and ""you are lucky i found it and not your mom"", and ""yall must have did it while we were home"", and ""be careful, you are almost 18 and it will be illegal"", and ""Be more careful with what you do with your stuff. pick up your mess."" I didn't say anything. didn't know what to say. I just got red in the face and was waiting for this conversation to be over with. no more forgetting condoms on my floor ever again."

"event","well i've been pretty happy lately. i'm back together with my girlfriend and she is all that i can think about. i've been driving to her house in houma on the weekends now. it really sucks that she lives so far away, but i can tell she is alot happier. she is in a much safer place now. she's still a little uncomfortable though, because she hasn't talked to her dad like her whole life, and she just called him up and moved in with him. so she really doesn't know him that well. he seems like a pretty nice guy though. he is a lot more layed back. i can do more stuff with her now than when she was living here. she makes me so happy seeing her happy. something happened today that bothered me just a lil bit though. my friend at school was basically giving away somas to certain people b/c he has a script. and he offered me. well the only thing that stoped me was thinking about Shea. and i promised her i wouldn't do it again. i just don't want things to go wrong again. and end up alone. i would prolly start using again. maybe i'm worrying too much. i don't know, what ever. we are so open now about everything. we can talk about our fantasies or ""fetishes"" that some people would be too embarrassed to mention to anyone. some people would think that we were very sick individuals, but i don't think so. we aren't like all about messing around and stuff. we haven't had sex yet. she is a virgin. i've only done it 2 times and didn't like it at all either time, b/c i didn't really like the person and i was very uncomfortable around her. Shea wanted me to take her last time we were together, but i said no because it wasn't exactlt the best place to lose your virginity. i want to make it special for her. it will happen one day. and it will be beautiful."

"event","Ever since me and my girlfriend broke up 6 months ago i started using drugs on a daily basis again. i was doing so good too. it's amazing how the only time i could stay sober for a long period of time since i was 12 was with my girlfriend. it's so pathetic that i can't do it on my own and for myself. everything is so messed up right now. this is how everthing fell threw.....
It was the last week of school before the holidays and i left class and bought a coke and walked out to my car to put some wiskey in it. well i was already messed up on a couple of zanex and somas and i guess i wasn't thinking and i locked my keys in the trunk after making my drink. so i went to the office and called my dad and asked him to bring the extra key to the office. well, instead of doing that, he goes to my car and gets it open himself. so he found the wiskey. he waited till i came home that night from work to confront me. when i came home he could still smell whiskey on my breath and he knew i was drinking in school. he talked/yelled at me and then i got tested the next day. they found x, alcohol, thc, and a variety of pills like soma, zanex, and L10's. the only thing they could not find was lsd b/c it doesn't show up in piss tests. so they decided i need help and admitted me, for the fifth time, to depaul. when i got there, the doctor decided that i need to detox from everything including my medication for bipolar. and the type of medicine i was taking isn't the type you can just stop all at once. you need to slowly be weened off of it. especially the amount i was taking and i've been taking it most of my life. i was taking depakote(mood stabalizer), wellbutrin(antideppressant), geodon(antipsychotic), buspar(antianxiety), and serequil(antipsychotic). so the first week i was there i went threw some withdrawl and i couldn't eat or sleep. the plus side about it is that i lost ten pounds.  during this period i was on vps. i don't know what that stands for but it means you need to be watched 24-7. so i had to sleep in the hallway for a while. my blood pressure became really high and i was really shaky and paranoid for a few days. but the worst part about it was my thinking and feelings. they were out of control. i couldn't help but to cry every few minutes and i couldn't figure out why. it eventually got better and my doctor put me back on some of my meds. he said the drugs i was taking was counteracting with my meds so i just needed to clean my system out. i was there for about 3 weeks. and the doctor told my parents that i need to go to rehab. so he put me on a waiting list at a place in baton rouge. i'll probably be leaving for there in a week. i'll be doing the 12 step program. my ex girlfried called me a few days ago. we both miss each other and want to try to get back together, but i told her i can't right now b/c i need to learn how to be strong and stay sober for myself. my parents are keeping a tight hold on me till i leave for that place, but at least they are allowing me to smoke cigarettes now. just not in the house. so i guess i need to start over again. it just sucks b/c i missed my exams and i need to make them up. and am going to miss another 2 months of school before i can do that. i'm trying not to worry about that though."

"event","hey,
        i need to tell you about halloween. what a weird night. i think it is the begining of another break down for me. fist of all i took 4 microdots. if you dont know what those are, then i'll tell you. 1 microdot is like three hits of good acid. man am i dumb. the whole night was so emotional it was unhealthy. so many flashbacks. not so much visual flashbacks, but feelings i used to have. i forgot how fucked up i can think when i wasn't medicated. i was literally skitzophrenic the whole night. i spend a majority of the night on the couch of some girl's house balling my eyes out about this obsession i used to have. a few years ago i used to pray all the time that i would fall in love and me and my lover would kill each other. depression hurts so much, but it is so romantic. i can't stand it. i duno. i think i just need to stop before it gets to me. i've been to rehab 3 times and thats enough. i would have never thought i would touch x again. but look at me. its pathetic. and my mood is really fucked up. its like everything is perfect and all of a sudden fuck everyone. ok, i'm stopping now. enough complaining. there are worse things to feel bad about."

You don't need to tell me
I hope you're with someone who makes you

I won't kill myself, trying to stay in your life
I got no distance left to run

When you see me
Please turn your back and walk away
I don't want to see you 
Cos i know the dreams that you keep is wearing me
When your coming down, think of me here
I got no distance left to run

It's over, I knew it would end this way
I hope you're with someone who makes you feel
That this life is the night
And it settles down, stays around

i had two beers and a shot of tequila(on the house!) in red onion, at 4 in the after noon, and let me say that the combination of alcy and sun is effective. cus i was hyper and kicking. yay!

england lost the game, they have been sent home (weep) and portugal took over the show. yes i have a new hobbie and its watching footie. i really really enjoy it, and took an amazing dose of it while in saudi. so now i watch cus its fun and theres a lot of hotties with extremely well defined legs running on a green field. yum.
i s'pose whn you have a passion for the team that are playing you really get into it(a bit too much) and every goal they get is intense and good, every one scored against them, is really ""ouch""!!! you know, i cant describe the feeling. its cool.

osman has left to germany, i didnt get to say good bye, but i really wish him all the best, and its really cool what he's done, i hope it all works out well.

<b>Sallie has arrived at the freak show</b>

i was expecting to find a busy journal, but not much written here, guess leelo really did take it to heart and wont blabber.
i say sod that girlie. EXPRESS YOURSELF.
mumble, talk shit, exaggurate, ponder, let others ponder, create and entertain etc. 

okay. back to me now.

as most of you should know i was in SAUDI ARABIA. not a very exciting place to be. but, it was chilled out and i needed to chill out. proper two week detox this time round.
my flight back was totally shit. i mean it. i despise arabs. they are an absoloutly crude race. all the fucking way.

its worth mentioning that i was being sized up by a male lebeneese whom decided that stalking me is going to make me fall for him. serious to life, this 23 year old was sleazy and sticky, the types you buy in pickeled jars. invitation after invitation, calling my mum's house!! he was a son of our nieghbour who is an adorable laydee, bless her, but unfortunately managed to give birth to a perverted creature. i feel bad. i am being to cruel here, i mean after all it was a silly crush, yeah?? no!! he STALKED me. he even asked me to visit him in bahrain.he told his mum i was on the list of eligable women to marry. then he claimed he was seriously considering this.can you believe the nerve?now before you assumptuate (?) i met him briefly whence i was dragged to meet AUNTIE hoda, and he apparently thought that when a woman says ""hi,nice to meet you"" and shakes your hand, it means you scored. because i hardly talked to this male thing and he was following me places for a week. then my step dad stepped in and turned into my body guard. which was very neat. i wish i could tell you something exciting happened, like he hung him from a tree by his boxers (although this guy probably uses thongs) or he gave him a black eye, but it wasnt like that. he went up to him, the very tall man that he is, looked down on him and had a one to one talk. basically he told him to fuck off, and that even if i was to marry, which is against our belief system, it was never gonna be to one of ""you bloody arab bastards, alright mate?""
how diplomatic.

another thing.i am not an arab, i speak arabic but am not an arab. i refuse to be. i have denounced myself from that seriously fucked clan.okay. now its out there and everyone knows. blech."

ah, i've come to the conclusion that the problem is the ""to do with"" ""i shall do with"" ""i will settle for""

to settle: to land, to become peaceful with, to sink, to lay

hey hello,i am a settler. settlers are'nt very cool. because settling for something comes from the most inner and hidden belief in that you dont deserve better, that you cant do better, that you wont reach better. so you might tell me its laziness, i think its more. its a bargain that one will not bother with, cuz one thinks one shall lose.
and indeed you will not, if youre to alter your belief.

my sister posed the question today:
""you guys, what exactly is a labwa?""

:) god bless her

this month, has been for many, quiet harsh, tense, and over emotional.
i believe there is reason. 
first of all, needless to say, i decided that many people, or all of us, have been seriously affected by something in nature's offerings, due to the fact that <b>I</b> have been rather out-of-it, and i personally decided that everyone will feel just as i did. because, afterall, i am the centre of the universe.
secondly, according to moon phases, we have been late. yes, just like i am now, the moon phases have been kicking in hours late. not many. but there is interfernce.this causes irregular mood changes in majority of people, and in the chi energy of things. in my case, that would be severe two week PMS and i'm still waiting.fucking touchme and i'll cry.
thirdly, fi nafsana bint kalb.<b>cleanse your auras people</b>
fourthly, fi gam3at.imti7anat.afsha7'anat.
fifthly, there is only one person i can name out of everyone i know that has been getting some every single night. one person. 
sixly, the weather has become hotter, hotter, and much hotter.
seventhly, may is obviously no' cool, i mean, its the only three letter month in the calender,its the time for transitions, and its damn right unlucky.
eighthly, the time is slow, but fast...u know?
ninethly, there's been too many accidents.
tenthly, oh my god i need a vacation!!!!!!!!!!!!!i mean, summer pop tunes, tanning oil, flip flops and glasses out. lets dance drink and love each other!preferably at the sea side, away from egyptians.

ITEMS NEEDED FOR MY HOUSE BATHROOM
*Scale
*Less mirrors(how kinky is my dad?)

couldnt be the right girl for you
wasnt in your book of l-l-l-love

and innocent kisses in the park
like that tuesday in front of the world
or the wall the wall with our names

lillies i carried for you
so long before you came
and you knew just how to say the right thing
at the wrongtime
and get away with it, oh, so sweet

i said, boy how much do you love me?
i said, tell me, how much do love me?
this much....this much....this much...

still not real to me
did you want dark pixie girls
coffee shop girls?

i guess you made your mind up already
but i dont deserve to be lonely
just because you say i do.

there are a few other people in there though.
well, most of them are people, apart from Lucinda who's got four pink legs, and white white hair, and marshel a.k.a mellow who doesnt have a head aslan.
i would like to get rid of the arabic language and lock my self up in a dungeon for 3 months and 14 days.
after that i would like to have <b>sex with jim morrison</b> and travel high on <b>7 acid tabs</b> and after that i could go to fucking hell.
i think hell is cooler than heaven anyway.
i mean, its such a cliche.
everyone wants heaven and eternal hapiness and all that bull.
well you know what, i dont want heaven.fuck heaven.
i like skin burns.
there's some sort of peculiar satisfaction in that feeling of being hurt. burn. burn. burn.


today i went to my bathroom to brush my teeth. i dont spend a lot of time there because everything seems to be under supervision around here. i stay in my room all the time. hididng underneath my covers.grrrr...pssssss...meeeeeoooow :)
anyway, i went there to brush my teeth, and as i was staring at the reflection i no longer relate to in the mirror, i realised there was a post-it with a brief and odd note in big red threatening letters.

""put the cap back on the toothpaste when your done. thankyou for your BLOODY help""

anonymously written, but its not me, or my sisters so unless the maid writes good sarcastic notes, its my dad or his wife.

i have managed to end up in an eventful unplanned day.nutmeg for breakfast,a wild shopping spree, i talked to a lot of random ppl,the energy about me was amazing, my glow was at its peak....went for lunch,squeezed some money out of the father machine, met up with the guys, smoked up and went to the movies with ahmed,all the while feeling very great, alert and hyper.....it was tres good. most productive day in ages. i am buzzing.

yes, apparently it really does work....nutmeg....who knew that those wierd nuts in that little jar in my kitchen spice cabinet was a little jar of miracles?not very practical, but hey...

it has this amazing ability tp make you see things and hear things....its perfect if you like lucidity and dream related activities.

2 spoons of yucky tasting ground nutmeg can give you the effect of a joint and psychoactive, hallucinations start from hour nine...it lasts for ages, and you feel good, giggly, tripped out...

dont believe me?
do your research and try it. 
go on. type NUTMEG and see what comes up. try NUTMEG EXPERIENCE. go on. EAT NUTMEG.its good for you, and has no calories...hehehehe...
oh, and if you will secretly try it(cus ofcourse only dumb people like us go round bragging that they ate nutmeg for a high) dont take too much, 15 grams at the most, 2 tablespoons no more....

i will not be held responsible for anyone's severe stomach pain, vomitting, feeling icky, or seriously getting tripped out and muddled up between whats real and what isnt. 

excuse me, i just got hit, i'm gonna dim my lights, sink in bed, and move from dream to dream to reaity to dream....i was there and it was so reallllllll

i missed satushi, apparently it was  good, but hey they do say that bout every event we dont go to....but i mean, they were selling herbal weed there, and at the enrique concert they were selling DUREX, so there's minor improvement.not that all this measures improvement or goodness...u know, its just a change...
i reckon that suddenly, out of the blue, things will dramatically change, like a cold slap in the face...who knows...who cares

i got the whole concert vibe going, wish there was something decent to go to, imagine deftones, or tool. oh my god, just the thought of it makes me sweetly shiver.

i need an adranaline rush, i need more exitement. i do some interesting things, but still unfullfilling, i want something where the risk is HUGE so the consequences seem petty.something to get me going.......

its so nice to wake up with someone beside you.....

i got an interesting phonecall the other day..someone ive known for years, but never REALLY talk...and i wondered, why not?

AUC talent show, and the wierdest things happened...here we come back to ""coincidence"" as people have termed it. 
gosh what a small world!

ahmed is on a hunt for this guy who apparently looks just like him!he has managed to get this annonymus person's number and is on a mad high to meet him...
i mean, really, i find this hilarious.must admit i admire his outgoing character,up 4 anything, very persistant too. (funniest thing,just the day before this amusing ""hunt"",i was watchin sienfeld,and exactly the same thing was happenin with George,he was trackin down a lookie likie...all this is rather entertaining.) and guess what?i've been asked to go meet him too. apparently so that i never get mixed up. LOL. imagine that. hahahahahahaha.ahmed yer a laugh.mwah mwah.  

so youssef was the best drummer around (obviously)
shout out to zizo who was great
KAZ sang his lungs out, and seriously i liked ""machine head"" even tho they'd just done it that morning
thumbs up to ""la mort par la toilette"" (i'm not sure whats goin on there) but i dug the theme thing,unexpected on my part,and done rather well
i want IDLEMIND to go live, i so respect the band and enjoy the musick so much.

"event","<c>time takes its crazy toll
and how does your mirror grow
you better watch yourself when you jump into it
'cause the mirror's gonna steal your soul

I wonder how it came to be my friend
that someone just like you has come again
you'll never, never know how close you came
until you fall in love with the diamond rain

throw all his trash away
look out he's here to stay
your mirror's gonna crack when he breaks into it
and you'll never never be the same

look into his eyes and you can see
why all the little kids are dressed in dreams
I wonder how he's gonna make it back
when he sees that you just know it's make-belief
blood crystalized as sand
and now I hope you'll understand
you reflected into his looking glass soul
and now the mirror is your only friend

look into his eyes and you will see
that men are not alone on the diamond sea
sail into the heart of the lonely storm
and tell her that you'll love her eternally

time takes its crazy toll
mirror fallin' off the wall
you better look out for the looking glass girl
'cause she's gonna take you for a fall

look into his eyes and you shall see
why everything is quiet and nothing's free
I wonder how he's gonna make her smile
when love is running wild on the diamond sea</c>

i cant sleep...or i did n i woke up n been up since...
its so confusing...when u drink so much n not remember half the shit that happened the night before.......
why cant it be easier ya3ni.....like i can install a memory chip.....or somethin in my head...n review it the next day to make sure i didnt fuck up...n if i did..then i could go fix what i did.
its not like i DID fuck up...nope ..not this time.(or maybe?)
but some1 did....n it pissed me.... n it made me even more sad than i was before.
its pathetic how life is....its like...its got no meaning....just a rhyme.
umm.....GOD GOD GOD GOD.............
im sure it all adds up......fits somehow.....
that what we do in our past has an effect on what we do now....fuck hell no it shouldnt....!im so selfish seriously....i shouldnt be like that....im gettin kicks outta being in this.
nice.......walahi im happy.....in a twisted n very sick self abusing way.......
well...since Kareem came back from england we've all been pretty much wasted 24/7......yesterday @ incogs....wasnt bad at all....we were all there....maz wasnt tho..he went to sharm with my cousin....
he called me up like 3 times...sounded very happy...im happy for him..he needs a change...bigtime.
ummmm......something that is really bothering me these days is that i really think bout ali alot....i dunno why.i really just wanna get my guitar from him n then cut with him forever.
dont wanna know him.....he has these vibes..that i can feel all the time...really bothers me.i really hate what he made be become.
ummm....i might be goin tomorrow to Dahab with sallie, ramez, kareem n omar z.
i wonder....hehe....unlikely bunch...not really....i just wanna GOOOoooOOOooO! close my mobile.....forget everything....
i wont even bother takin much clothes with me.....i wanna feel FREE n SIMPLE n just plain.

its funny that you could hurt someone so much without even knowing what ur doing.
it always come back to bite u in the butt tho...
just when u thought u paid ur dues.
maybe ill go take a shower....n call up some1...anyone....sallie( she wont answer) or any1 n go for coffee.
or should i go back to sleep?
i only slept for 3 hours....n feels ive been sleepin for days.
cheer up girl.....
i am i am.
:):)
walaaaaahi i just need this SNAP! n all will be good.

<b>what have become of me?</b>
i decided that i dunno where i belong.
i decided that im surfacing.
i decided that i hate so many ppl.
i decided that im so much better than the shit im puttin my self in.
i decided that i dont wanna be in a relation""Shit"" for a very looooong time.
i decided that i wont be <b>WHAT I THOUGHT THAT I SHOULD BE</b>.
i decided that i should lstn to myself more.
i decided that this is gonna be my last summer of aimlessness.
i decided that i miss so many ppl that i pushed away from me.
i decided that I being as empty as i am.....will look for that thing that will fill me up again.
i decided that i wanna be ""ALIVE"". i wanna be breathing....i wanna be breathing...i wanna be breathing....i wanna be ok.
i am ok....i am just not in my right sense lately....NO NO NO NO
i dont wanna see a single comment on how ""i should be bla bla bla bla""
NOOO no no no....I need to just fuckin let it out.....be it to cyber space or whatever...
OKAY....all ive been feelin is...as if im some1 else...i am..im SURFACING. n its scaring me...God how i wish no one would get judgemental over this....

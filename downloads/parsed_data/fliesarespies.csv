"event","if today was any other school day, i'd be waking up at 7:15 not standing outside of the old gym wearing a cap 346 sizes too small for my collosal noggin. it seems like i've spent the last school week hacking with jeff. john, tim, robby, teddy, and brett. good times. i just took a small break from typing to move the Aenima cd and make the guy suck his own weenie to the ryhtym of the music.  baccalaureate is dumb. the spelling is dumb. i probably spelled it wrong. free cake, chips, pretzels, and juice. the youth pastor looked like ryan reeves. i want an overwhelming amount of naked pictures sent to me. so if you read this, take a naked picture of yourself and send it to me. naked pictures and subway stamps. that's all i want in life."

"event","my throat hurts. doc says it's probably mono.
i spent like an hour looking at 66 and 67 GTOs. 
i've played the spoons non-stop since yesterday. what a great instrument.

french vanilla tea = mmm

productive days make me happy.
...so do lazy days.

Very Sexy for him by Victoria's Secret just may be the very best smelling cologne.

"event","Brett Woodring, you are my favorite mother fucker.
he gave me 10 free crunchy taco coupons.
im falling asleep.
as far as i know, tomorrow Nick and I are riding our bikes trough Rolling Acres mall. should be kind of fun.
Amanda is picking me up from school tomorrow.

just a few reasons why today didnt suck:
- over sleeping, but still getting to school on time
- 10 taco coupons
- 70% butter, 28% mashed potatoes, 2% unknown
- mr. smith's head almost exploded
- stolen butterscotch cake from John
- ho-ho from John
- 1.5 free tacos with John
- free steak&cheese sub from SubWay
- oreos with Amanda
- getting my lovely electrical tape ring from Amanda

this list proves my fatness.

this has been a boring entry.
sorry."

"event","today : summer :: 10 second porn clips : expensive site memberships

i made it up four flights of stairs in 12 steps. this weekend was pretty good. thursday i took the written portion of my driving test, i kicked its ass. i knew i did pretty well on it. there's this douche bag named marco in the class, he's from Green and he thinks he's better than me because i'm poor and from Kenmore - well i scored 4% higer than that cock sucker. i got the higest grade in the class, so they can all lick my fucking nuts. 98%

for the past 25 minutes i've been eating M&Ms non-stop.

i have the worst memory in the world.

today Amanda bought me 30 China Rain insense sticks.
im a big hippy loser.

the long and painful silence between andrew and i was broken today. im very very happy. 11 years isn't just something you let go to shit because i dont like one girl.

working at Guy's isn't all that bad. Jeff and i played music on the water glasses and we threw food at eachother and i tea bagged Josh and i ate 6 pieces of pie and drank 93 cups of room temperature pepsi and and and run on sentences are nifty.

i talked to my dad today about Amanda and I moving out pretty soon. we both thought our parent's were oing to shit, but they've actually bombarded us with stuff. all we need is a vacuuuum and some sort of couch. we'll probably get a fouton.

John Kerry looks like my grandpa Werner.
i wish i could be president.
i wish everyone was a Liberal.
why can't Tommy Chong be our Dictator?"

"event","Time is up. Its over in a blink of an eye. Guys i have only been with u for 2 yrs, but it seems like eternity. And i wish it would be. I love you guys so much...even though we will probably not stay friends forever, ill never forget you. Think about it...im not giving up on us, but we are all separate. and what is there to talk about separated? we arent all in the same school so why would we really care cause it doesnt affect us. Its sad knowing that we will fade out. But you guys will always be a part of me. Love you guys forever."

"event","Hi guys! Well I kno some people are getting tired of writing in their journal about stuff people already kno, and no one commenting. So why dont we have this journal for other people, and then have our own personal journal, that only us can read, so we can help eachother with issues. That way we would get comments. Just us. Like the people who have it now, but make it friends only, so only we can read it, no one else. Si? Lemme kno what yall think...

Last night was the concert. It was kinda dumb. Not as bad as last years though. Our eggheads thing went really well. Except for when amidon knocked over a mic. Fool. It was the highlight for the crowd. When the video came down I didnt bawl until they showed pictures of me with them. Cause it wont be like that next year. Waaa! I kept myself under control for the song after but when i walked up on stage to see them I just broke down. We were all hugging and crying. LoL! It was rather funny. Then afterwards we went out to goodnoes and me, bryn, chris, kelsi, ciaran, ryan, grace, and kim all sat at a table. LoL BOY DID I PIG OUT. I had a burger, fries, and a split a sundae with kelsi. LoL. We had some halarious conversations. And water fights. LoL kim and ry. Im so shocked he did that kim! Lets just say the whole entire table was soaked. It was all going great until Mrs harpine came in. UGH. She was like walking aorund and then people started to clap. And mr gessner and my dad just sat there. Gotta love them. And then ryan started to talk about ehr massive size and we think she heard us. HAHAHA! Go ry! Anyway some funny stuff...I had the most fun in my life. Meg you missed out bigtime! And u too karrie! And joey! hahaha! It was so much fun. Thats what im gonna miss the most. Just hanging out talking about stupid stuff. LoL. *sniff sniff* ok gtg byebye

And its a big joke in our class with the payne brothers and house that like they are savages, u would understand if u saw allen eat chicken, and so i said, ""mrs shinn what do u expect, its allen, he lives in the payne house, he has no manners. and mrs shettig got all snobby and said, that was even more rude than what he did. And i was taken back cause its a joke, and i was like what? *casually not snobby"" and she said, dont say what to me! I was like ok then. Then later dominic was sitting there with a lolly pop in his hand and mrs shettig came over and says, ""put it away or its mine!"" so he put it away casually and sat there. Then she waddles away and then turned around and said, ""u guys think u can do whatever u want and not follow and rules. Well im here to tell u u cant!"" so we didnt say anything and she waddled back and said, AND U BETTER LOSE THE ATTITUDE MISSY! and i didnt give her any attitude at all.

Thursday: race for education! ugh! Well we  were supposed to go to the national day of prayer thinger in doylestown but they didnt have enough drivers so they took the ppl singing and the kids who werent had to do community service! LoL! PRISON! Well first me and the rest of the 7th grade ppl that didnt go (which was the guys and sunny!) had to go help with the lil kids race for education. OMG there were billions of gnats! it was so annoying. nd me being stupid put on gel AND hairspray! LoL! Then miss shettig was in a bad mood and was yelling at us. Then the guys decided they wanted to get me with 8 bottles of water. LoL! and they did! i was dripping. Then mr d got p.o at us cause of it and we got sent in! HAHAH! Mrs reckeweg only made us to hw. It wasnt to bad.Dan kept getting me with water. LoL! Scandelous. Im really glad i dont like him anymore. Cause he is so much nicer to me as a friend.  Then we had to go upstiars and work in the 2nd grade room.It was like a trip down memory lane for me and ryan cause the closet we had was filled with the stuff we used in 2nd grade. yup yup yup. Then it was our turn to do the race. LoL i started out running but got tired fast. Im outta shape. I havent done anything strenuous for 8 mnths when i quit gymnastics.  Wow. I ran with karrie but she was in better shape so she could run more so i let her run ahead. Then i started talking to andrew but he started to run so i eventually ended up with dan and amidon. I mostly talked to dan cause i dont like amidon even as a friend. LoL he irritates me and is not funny. We ended up doing 16 laps. Not bad. 4 miles. Less than last year though. I did 17 last year. Oh well w.e. Then youth group.I was so tired but went anyway.It was boring. Like no one was there. Well the plastics were lol bryn. (INSIDE JOKE *lol kim*) I got a burger but it was gross adn undercooked so i got another which was decent. I fell right to sleep that night.

Nothing really today. We had a half day. I was so tired and my legs killed. Then my parents wouldnt let me go over Mary's to work on my project and instead made me go to some stupid nursery to get plants which tok 2 hours just to decide 6 feet of the area thing. The guy was rude. worse than me. But he eventaully calmed down. Anyway i gtg make up something for my mom. She is braindead with computers. Tata!

No little kid ever came up to me! But of course mrs shinn didnt believe me...ohhh ill finish this when i get home today! i gtg find my shoes! tata!"

"event","Hey guys! Whats up?! Today was okay. I think i finally developed allergies! I have been sneezing and sniffling all day! Maybe im just getting sick! :( oh well... anyway, today i got in trouble at gym! He was all pissy today anyway. OmG i now realize what iuts like not being the center of attention! I feel so bad for Kelsi and KArrie! Guys ill try to include u next time! Yay? Well what im talking about is at lunch i usually sit at a table with my 8th grade ""posse"" lol i love that word, and there are 2 tables next to eachother. I usually sit on the one on the right with meg bryn kim and grace, and we usually have some interesting conversations. Yall kno what i mean by interesting! And sometimes we kinda forget Kelsi and Karrie are at the table on the left with joey and his side kick miller! LoL kelsi! Well today i was late and they all sat down with out me and i had to sit on the end. I still enjoyed my lunch with Kelsi though. Its kinda irritating how i usually save seats for people and hold their spots and kelsi does too and they just sit right on down with out even concidering the rest of us. Erg...that kinda got me in a bad mood. LoL but on a brighter note we really got mipsy today! tee hee hee! she cried like 4 times! During gym she was being a brat and we were playing with these ball things, u kno the heavy ones? what are they called again? well e were making holes in the ground *productive gym class* and she was like i wanna try and getting all whiny about it. So we all kept grabbing it so she couldnt get it...then she was like ur a meany tessa! tess didnt care and was like YES!!! behind her back! tee hee! so then we kept making orders so she couldnt get in. lol she was like ur so mean tessa! sdhe was getting all bratty and like squealing...so i was like mocking her in a high voice saying, omg u called her a meany! she got the ball shes mean! get over it! so i shall be getting a call from her mother tongiht. her mom calls everyones mom making them be nice to her!lol i dont listen! tee hee hee! Then later kim locked all the bathroom stalls and by the way *way to go kimmy!!* and she was like omg meg and kim are so stupid they locked all the bathroom stalls. this got meg and kim pissed so da dun da dun...better watch out...steamy meggie coming down the halls! lol so that made her cry. Oh and haley made her bleed in stat which made her cry! Hahahha! this girl cannot take a hint that tess doesnt like her! hahhaa! its pathetic. Anyway im going to a phillies game tomorrow and of course its supposed to rain when im there! ughhhhhhhhhhh! this sucks! Pray it doesnt rain guys! my poor butt *3rd world country* will be cold! wa wa wa! But since i got a game tomorrow i have to do my project now so tata!

I need to study for Science. Andrew did a really bad job teaching and i didnt learn anything so i have to teach myself the lesson. and i have a ch 14 quiz tomorrow. I read the chapter but ill read it again. WE are reading the hiding place. Its pretty good. ITs sad too when Betsie dies. Its kinda irritating how amidon always reads everytime, and he puts the most unrealistic annoying accents on the dialogue int he book. Its not funny either. Nothing amidon ever says is funny. He has is own level of jokes. Same with other ppl


aMidon jokes
Ciaran jokes
Mr. Beggs Jokes
and Mrs Reckeweg jokes

NONE are FUNNY!  oh no we have chapel tomorrow!Mrs harpine is a dictator through teh whole thing. She picks where u sit! Its dumb! And once she made me move cause i told danae what the song we were singing was called. She like shoves u to a seat to. If she touches me 1 more time ill...ok i wont do anything lol im a 
""goody two shoes"" as ppl call it. I cannot stand mrs harpine. Anyway im excited cause next year it will be a totally different me! In some good ways and some bad. Good: im going under the knife this summer and getting some moles removes so i will have flawless skin, and im growing my hair out long again, and hopefully ill grow some, and meg is taking me shopping for a whole new style! Bad: i will have braces! ugh~ But im getting them b4 this year is over so they will be used to them by next year. But luckily i will get them off hopefulyl b4 9th starts! My teeth are straight i just have an over bite and i need to widen my jaw. That wont take too long. Hopefully i get more into shape the too. Slim down *not that im fat but im not as tone as i used to be!* Hopefully there will be a nice hot guy there so i have someone to show off too! LoL! hehehehe! Anyway im done blabbing i have to go soon anyway! You kno what is funny? We posted 25 messages all day for joey adn he ahsnt read a single one! LoL! Ok tata!

"event","Hey! Omg Last night was sooooooooo much fun! I went to Kelsi's youth group for their annual Gillette games. Basically its games u have to play with shaving cream! The first game was when ur team had to cross over to the other teams corner, but there was like 3 gallons of shaving cream in the middle! And of course I got stuck in the middle of a mass of kids and of course ciaran was next to me, he kept getting it in my face and in my eyes! Erg! Then he sent his lil friend to get it on me to! Then the next game was tug of war with a lot of shaving cream and it was hard to pull cause tos slippery! LoL! Kelsi kept falling! it was funny! And Ry actually came so and he didnt get dirty at all in his hair so kelsi and i ran over and nailed him!  It was fun! LoL! Ohhh and meg, grace and bryn u will love this one. For the next game someone had to sit in a chair and there team could use 2 bottles of shaving cream to shape ur hair or make something on top! And of course there were guys in my teams o they enjoyed hearing me scream when they put all of it in! LoL! I had so much fun! Then later when it was settling down i hung out with Ryan and Kelsi and we talked about him and danae and how its pointless to go back and how he just wants to be friends. I mean it isnt fair to him to have to chase around this girl who runs away or sends other ppl to talk to him. She improved but i think Ryan is just too outgoing for her. But Ryan is a softie and i kno he feels bad about it. I can tell. But it isnt fair to him, and it isnt fair to danae if he grows tired of it! I think they are just opposites. We also talked about how tibbito was flirting with all teh girls! He is sucha player! he put shaving cream on Sams chest and he was hugging this one girl who he randomly made out with and said it meant nothing. Kelsi is moving on. She deserves better. i dont think he is dependable! WE shall find her a nice new hott one! LoL! What i love about Kelsi's church is that the guys there just wanna be friends. Everyone is friends! Guys with girls can just hang out! They are so nice there! Like Vinny and Curt were really nice. Ohh i saw one of my old friends from Bucks there to. Francesca! Yup! She has grown alot! LoL! Fran and I are shorties! hehehe! Anyway, OMG i am mad Jennifer went home! Its a travesty! The divas were the bottom 3! thats insane! They are the best ones! They were inly the bottom 3 cause Jasmine has all of hawaii voting for her, jon stevens has his whole high school and same with diana! the divas are adults so they just have regular fans! I think people are forgetting to vote for vocal ability! Ok i gtg!! C ya later!!

Philippians 2: 5-11

Your Attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus. Who being in the very nature of God, did not consider equality with God something to be grasped, but made himself nothing, taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness. And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himelf and being came obiedient to death, even death on a cross. Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above all names, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth and every tongue confess Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.

I dont think he has the patience. And he lies to her. He tells me one thing and her another.

Personally i dont think its going anywhere, and its dumb and im sick of being the mediator so i want it to end. Like i want her to be happy but its annoying and she cant expect him to move at her pace...slower than a turtle! She can hardly talk to him, she sends people like me and tess and britt to talk to him. Its dumb. and i think he is sick of it. Today he was like, ""Im back on the market baby!"" LoL! Oh well... Maybe next year she wont be as shy and then will get back together. Yup yup yup...she like mournign now...not that she lost anything of importance! LoL! Heheheheheh! okay dokay gtg!

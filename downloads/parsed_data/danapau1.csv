"event","Yesterday was great. :happy:

Went to school the usual time.

Had an AP eng lit six weeks test, yay =\. Actually I did good on it so no worries there
Also had a Pre Calc test. I was the firstYAYone done and wasn't stuck on any question...I'm a tad confused on my grade for that class...I've changed teachers 3 times this six weeks, so I don't know. 

Called James and asked him to rescue me from the monotony. 

He shows up w/ chris =] We run errands, eat, run by his house, run by my house, he leaves to go talk to Aaron about his RAM, I do chores, he comes back, we go eat at Braums...then ON TO MITCH HEDBERG AND STEPEHN LYNCH.

YAY!

Saw Chad and Shawn there...well...saw Chad jumped on Shawn haven't seen them in forever, it was cool. Kept running into them through intermission and so on and was going to hang after the show but James was irritable. He had to go to work in the morning and was tired...I guess, I don't know. We were celebrating his birthday so it was whatever he wanted. I don't know I'll probably get his something else, something he can actually hold onto instead of a good memory.

Anyway the show...<3!!!!
GREATNESS. 
Mitch...so drunk. He did about 15 minutes of his show on the floor. Oh and this is funny too...:
[23:48:59] danapau1: god mitch is so cute!
[23:49:06] danapau1: and they were having speaker problems
[23:49:11] danapau1: and he got pissed off
[23:49:17] danapau1: omg funny!
[23:49:20] danapau1: this one chick....
[23:49:28] danapau1: she yelled while he was doing a joke
[23:49:32] danapau1: WE CANT HEAR YOU
[23:49:37] danapau1: and he was like WHAT
[23:49:43] danapau1: and she repeated
[23:49:49] danapau1: and he asked her why
[23:49:53] danapau1: and she was like a speaker went out
[23:50:02] danapau1: and he goes whatchor name
[23:50:06] danapau1: and she goes to answer
[23:50:18] danapau1: and before she even can he goes ""you can hear me bitch""

And my favorite from Stephen Lynch:
I came down to the breakfast table
felt like I could die
Tried so hard but wasn't able 
to look you in the eye

For i'm feeling so much shame
yes i have brought disgrace
i can tell i've soiled my good name
by the look upon your face

Well it seems last night you caught me spankin it
No use denyin it I was really crankin it
Well Dry your eyes don't be so sad
If you could just forgive me and talk to me, dad
talk to me dad

I didn't hear ya enter, no I didn't hear the door
with my hand upon my member and my pants upon the floor
Now burnt into your brain is an image you dispise
like blood and guts and starvin kids and Stevie Wonder's eyes

Man it was great. Had a lot of fun and wish I could have done more. Couldn't have imagined a better person to spend it with either. 

Oh yea...heehee:
I got Stephen Lynch's autograph, w00t. =]"

"event","I don't know what to say. But I know this will be one of those. Those entries that make you wonder if the insanity plee would work for me. Complex itinerary, heh. Save your sanity for later Douglas Adams says, good man he was. Save some face too, you know, you've only got one. And while you're at it change your ways while you're young because one day you'll be a man. Don't take advantage of your dreams, they aren't what they used to be, just some things that sat by so feeble.

Smile like you mean it.

You don't have anything I've never had. Promise that it won't get bad, I do. We could be friends but hopefully that story ends because someone must have loved you. That's fantastic, tell me it is, and promise <i>me</i> you'll always sigh when you look into my beautiful eyes and lose control. I swear i told you the truth. Jealousy: turning saints into the sea, swimming through sick lullabies and choking on your alibis. But that's just the price I pay and now I've found the velvet sun that shines on me and you.

I'm just down to one thing and I'm starting to scare myself. You're  going to cause the system to fall but be glad to be chained to that wall. It's where you belong. And when you bound to the rigged concrete don't open you eyes, you won't like what you see. The blind are blessed with redemption. I have found you can find happiness in slavery.

Happiness. Yay.

I still don't know what I am. More than likely human junk, just words and so much reptilian skin. Just some flesh caught in this big broken machine.

Happiness in slavery. The mechanisms rotate. Hard labor. Always a price to pay, never a salary of reward.

My heart colides with the extraneous casing, pinched and wrapped in soiled twine. Pray to my Christ, to my God for all my sins hooked upon the sky and pray the heathen lie with diappear. My prayers: they hide in the saddest view. Believing the strangest things.

There are times when I think I'm scared and sometimes when I know. I feel like making love, sometimes I don't and never do. I feel like letting go, maybe not.I feel like giving up, it's a definate shot. Sometimes is all the time and never means maybe 

It's just the little things that you used to see that make the man who makes you who you want to be.

<i>""I never noticed 
How lovely were the aliens 
Reclusive and fleeing""</i>

It's all coming apart like a ten cent toy.

And then I look at you and smile because I am fine.

I wouldn't be worried if I were you."

"event","True Story:
(not mine, got this out of Seventeen Mag)

Tim sat behnd me freshman yea in health class. He was from a different town so I'd never seen him before. That first day of high school I thought he was just another immature guy, he kept tapping his pen on my chair and making my desk shake. But then I heard him speak. He was staring out the window, oblivious to the class around him, when he whispered to no one in particular: ""Don't you wish you could just reach out and touch a cloud?"" 
I was immediately taken by Tim's sensitvity and inquisitiveness. But that was only the beginning. Tim was in a few of my other classes and I soon found out he always posed thoughtful questions that everyone else was too shy to ask. In Bio class he once asked if he could save a dying plant by breathing carbon dioxide on it. I loved how Tim didn't care what other kids thought. And not only did I start to expect his rondom questions, I couldnt wait to hear them.
By six weeks into school I had a full blown crush on Tim and I was sure he liked me too, bc every time he made a joke in class he'd look over to make sure I was laughing. We'd walk together from bio, to geo, to choir and whenever hed talk to me hed look deep into my eyes and barely blink. It was impossible for me to look away.
But then about five months into our flirty friendship, I learned I wasnt the only girl tim had been paying a lot of attention to. One monday morning I was standing by my locker when I overheard some of Tims friends teasing him about a freshman girl I didnt know who he had hooked up with over the weekend. I couldnt beleive it. I mean yea I was devastated but I was also really mad at myself for having gotten so carried away over him so I pretended not to hear. Still its not like I could get angry at Tim when all we'd really done was hang out in shcool. He kept treating me the same talking and joking in class so I didnt say anything and tried to convince myself being friends was good enough. Over the next three years we were in all the spring musicals together and both sang in our schools a cappella group so Tim and I actually became pretty close albeit not in the same way I had hoped. Even though Tim and I never became 'more than just friends' as I now look back over my four years of high school some of my best memories are from afternoons just spent at play and chorus practice hanging out with him. But its like theres always one butterfly lingering in my stomach that refuses to go away. 
How different would high school have been if I had just told Tim...?"

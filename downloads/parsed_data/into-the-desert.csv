"event","Josh was allowed just three days of dinosaur prospecting, because Bahariya wasn't where Jen's research was taking place.  Using Stromer's notes, the three scientists searched the desert floor for fossilized bone as they drove to where Stromer had indicated he'd been successful in his own hunt.  But the lattitude and longitude he'd written down didn't match the physical description of the landscape.

The team did find fossil, however - bits and chunks of what looked like burnt firewood lying across the sand.  They took GPS readings of these locations, leaving their finds where they lay.  This was a prospecting mission only - no permits had been given that would allow them to collect any fossils on this trip.  Egypt is proud of its heritage - much of which has been stolen away over the years -  and anything aged over 100 years <b><i>(Note: double-check that)</I></b> isn't allowed to leave the country without permission.
<lj-cut>
On the third day of exploration, Stromer's original dig site was found.  Again, GPS readings were scribbled down and the site reluctantly left behind.

A month later, back in Philadelphia, Josh started focusing on finding a way to return to Bahariya with a full dig team.  Acting on the suggestion of a fellow grad student, he looked to Hollywood for funding..and got the attention of a fairly new production company called MPH Enterprises.

They liked the human interest angle of the story and agreed to not only film the project, but to also provide seed money for the dig - an agreement that would lead to the producer remortgaging his house so that the funding could be provided.

Through Dr. Giegengack's political connections in Cairo, an amazingly generous arrangement was made with EGSMA (the Egyptian Geological Survey and Mining Authority).  US scientists would be allowed to not only dig in Egypt, but also to take their finds back to America to study them.  Anything new to science would be returned to Cairo. 

With permits and funding taken care of, Josh (as Project Leader) could now focus on assembling the dig team that would make up the core of the Bahariya Dinosaur Project.  Jen agreed to take a position as a team geologist.  Matt's encyclopedic knowledge of dinosaurs and experience in the field made him an obvious choice.  Ken, a professor of geology at Drexel University, was invited to work with Jen.  His knowledge and understanding of sedimentology would help the team to understand what the area of the world that is now Bahariya was like millions of years ago.  And finally, Ferret, whose fossil preparation skills had proven indispensible to University of Penn's digs in the past, was invited to join the team as lead fossil preparator and pit crew manager."

"event","The Bahariya Dinosaur Project was, as the news was happy to focus on, inspired by beer.

Josh and Matt, two graduate students at the University of Pennsylvania, were comparing dream expeditions one night, and both agreed that Egypt was a place they very much wanted to investigate.

In the early 1900's, while Roy Chapman Andrews was igniting the American imagination with his escapades in China, German paleontologist Ernst Stromer quietly ventured into Cairo, making his way to the Bahariya Oasis and discovering dinosaurs and evidence of ancient life that were new and alien-looking.  Spinosaurus is the most famous - a meat-eating dinosaur with a huge sail-like fin decorating its back and a long, thin, tooth-filled mouth.

His finds were taken back to Germany, mounted in the Munich museum, and subsequently destroyed during World War II.

No paleontologist had ever returned to Egypt.  Science had turned its eye to the American west, the Gobi desert, Moracco, even Antartica, leaving a great deal of Africa unexplored, geologically speaking.
<lj-cut>
Some scientists had attempted to get permission to prospect in North Africa, but had run into political roadblocks and red tape.  Josh, however, was in the right place at the right time.

His girlfriend's advisor, Dr. Giegengack, had good connections in Cairo and a strong love for Egypt.  Gieg helped Jen start research in the country's western desert, and, in turn, was convinced by Josh's research that a prospecting visit to Bahariya might be worthwhile.

Jen agreed, and so Josh became a part of her geological team in 1999."

"event","Part of the deal agreed upon between the BDP and the Cairo Geological Survey and Mining Authority was that American and Egyptian scientists would work together on the dig in Bahariya.  This would include training Egyptian scientists in modern paleontological techniques, and would involve sending selected people to the US in the summer, when there would be more time for the American team members to focus on this education.

Most of the interest in Egyptian history, of course, centers around their pharaonic legacy.  It's what the tourists want to see, and it's what we all think of when we dream of this exotic place.  So while some paleontology has been done here, it's so far centered on mammals, not dinosaurs.  Geology is studied, but more as a tool for the quest of oil.  The only reason dinosaurs had ever been discovered in Egypt in the first place was because a German scientist, Ernst Strohmer, decided to explore these deserts in the 1920's.  

The simple fact is that, up until 1999, Egyptians were pretty much uninvolved in the exploration of their prehistoric past.
<lj-cut>
In 2000, the first few Egyptians arrived in Philadelphia.  Khyrate Soliman, then-head of the Cairo museum, traveled with Yousry Attia, lead Egyptian scientist on the team.  Both men are geologists; both were sent first as a matter of prestige. 

They worked with Ferret in his prep lab a good deal of their time here, and so this is where I saw them the most.  Yousry is a quiet, sweet man, warm and considerate.  Khyrate is more reserved.  He carries himself proudly, always looking vaguely amused at the world. Neither speak English well - though they understand and speak the language passably, I often had to have Ferret help translate what was being said because of their thick accents.

There are three exchanges that stick in my memory the strongest from these few weeks.

While talking to Khyrate, he commented that I didn't speak like other Americans.  I blushed, assuming he meant the speed at which I talk.  Ferret jumped into the conversation.  ""She's a writer,"" he explained.  ""She likes to use words that most people don't use every day.""  Khyrate nodded his understanding, and I turned away, wondering how true this was...

Another day, Khyrate showed me a picture of his beautiful teenage daughter and, smiling, said, ""You must come to my country!""

""I would love to - but it's expensive,"" I demurred.

""But you're American!  Americans are wealthy!""

""Not *this* American..""

Again, Ferret interrupted, and started to explain to Khyrate about the class system in America...how we are considered middle-class, but that there are levels to this, and so we are not as well-off as others who are in the same category....and how the size of where you live doesn't necessarily reflect your level of wealth.  I don't know that Khyrate was convinced, but I'm sure it was an unexpected insight into American culture.

And educational for me, as well.  We're always told that the rest of the world sees us as all being wealthy.  But actually facing that assuption is a very different thing.

I don't mean to make it sound like Khyrate and I talked a lot.  We really didn't.  But Yousry is indeed a quiet, humble man, deferring to Khyrate in most (if not all) things.  And so while I have a great deal of respect for Yousry, I can't say I know him very well at all.

Before the Egyptians left Philadelphia, Khyrate decided to have a dinner party that he would prepare himself.  He told Ferret, ""Please tell Dusti she is very invited.""  As I was the only woman he was inviting, Ferret was understandably intrigued.  

""You seem to like Dusti a lot.  Why is that?""

""She is like an American woman.  She has her own interests and work.  But she is also like a muslim woman.  She supports what you do, and she takes care of your needs, she asks if you need anything.""

And I wonder if that reflects another foreign misconception of Americans.  Do people in other countries see American women as all being aggressive ultra-feminists?

The thought troubles me a lot.  How have we done such damage to our international identity?  How do we convince the world that we are not our stereotypes?"

"event","The ""glamourous"" part of paleontology is definitely the field work.  A band of intrepid explorers, venturing out into the wilderness to pry giant pristine bones out of the ground...it's very Indiana Jones (and indeed, many believe that the character of Indy was based on one of America's most dynamic paleontologists, Roy Chapman Andrews).

But it's in the fossil preparation lab where discoveries made in the field are fully revealed and start to be understood.

<lj-cut text=""this entry needs work"">
It's very often volunteers that do much of the fossil prep work scientists rely on.  Their qualifications are their time, interest, dedication and skill.  They sit in labs that can be as simple as a table, chair, lamp, and dental pick, for the tools of the trade are generally not that impressive.  Chisels, brushes, picks, glue - these are universal.  If they're lucky, they have the use of an air scribe (a tiny handheld air-powered jackhammer) or an air abrasive device (a small sealed chamber that uses abrasive material to polish and clean fossils).  If the work is on very delicate fossils, diluted acid baths may be called for.

It's here in the lab that bones are accurately identified and discoveries are made.  Tooth marks may indicate scavenging.  Gnarled bumps may hint at arthritis or old battle wounds.  Bits of fossilized plant found around the animal's bones give clues as to the world these ancient animals lived in.

It's all important.  And the work is very underrated.

When the first BDP field season ended, tons (literally) of fossils were delivered to Ferret's prep lab in Philadelphia.  As one of his volunteer prep people, I was allowed to work on some of these one-of-a-kind finds.  

I thought I was up to the challenge.

I was wrong.

You see, the fossils of Bahariya came to the US covered in gypsum - an evaporite crystal that looks like salt and grows like ice.  Meaning, once it's active, it gets into cracks within stones, expands and grows along those lines, and works to break the stone apart.

Wonderful for geology.  Bad for us.

Ferret assigned me a fossil to work on, instructing me to remove all the gypsum I could see.  <i>'Right,'</i> I said to myself, and set to work, diligently doing my best to follow his instructions to the letter.

A short time later, he came over to see how the work was progressing.  ""Stop!  What are you doing??""

I glanced up, confused.  ""I'm doing what you said to do.  I'm removing all the gypsum.""

It was then that we started to realize how invasive this mineral was.  It was literally between very thin layers of bone.  To remove all the gypsum was to leave crumbling gaps.  There was just no way to safely do it without completely destabilizing the fossils.  Added to this problem was the fact that it was often next to impossible to tell what was fossil and what was gypsum, because the white mineral would pick up color from the brown bones, and the two were so intermingled at times that the constant back-and-forth between fossil and gypsum made me a nervous wreck, reluctant to work unless it was absolutely necessary and the differentiation was absolutely obvious.

Phone calls were made to fossil preparators across the country.  No one had ever heard of fossils being this chewed up by gypsum; nor had anyone seen crystals so large before.  Eventually, Ferret figured out that using heat would break up the crystalline structure on the surface of the bone without hurting the precious fossils.  And with that discovery, the prep work went much more quickly.

Another problem arose as the Philadelphia summer took hold of the city. With the rise in humidity, the dormant gypsum started to reactivate.  Oily water seeped from the bones - not a lot, mind you, but enough to worry about.  Again, Ferret got on the phone; and again, his professional colleagues were baffled.  But as the weather leveled off, the ""water"" stopped forming and the fossils were sealed in glue.

Lots and lots of glue.

On the other hand, some fossil was found in ironstone - a bloodred rock that is, indeed, like iron to work through.  But the fossil it protected was beautiful, detailed stuff..very worth the effort required to uncover it.  Gill plates from a coelocanth that dwarfs its modern relative and lived in shallow waters were the primary find in these stones.

And this was to be part of the personality of Bahariya:  The best discoveries would be found where they were always least expected."

"event","""No!  She is <i>not</i> going!""

It wasn't quite the reaction I'd expected.  From the look on Ferret's face, he was a little surprised, too.

Josh pointed at me with a french fry, eyebrows raised.  ""I've seen how you get about animals.  There's no way we're taking you to Egypt.""

Now, granted.  Animals are very important to me.  And I tend to rant about exotic pet ownership a good deal more than I should.  But I'm not a rabid animal rights activist.  I've never thrown paint on a fur coat.  I don't belong to PETA.  I fight my battles through educating people.

So Josh's vehemence on that cold afternoon in 2000 was, indeed, a shock.

""Look, I have no idea how I'd react to a third world country.  I know that.  I know you guys saw a lot of animal abuse.  You've said as much.  All I know for sure is that I'd have to go in knowing this is a different world with different rules.""

Josh was far from convinced.  He started describing to me how he had passed by a child in the oasis town.  The child, no more than nine years old, was viciously beating a donkey, trying to get it to move.  And as Josh talked, I realized that he was protesting my anticipated reaction because there was something inside him that hadn't allowed him to work through his own horror.

Sometimes, I wish I knew what other reactions to Life he's hiding.  

Most of the time, I'm sorta glad I don't know."

"event","Ferret called earlier today to talk to me about the possibility of Egypt.

It's a vague chance still, and it may mean doing tasks like cooking and data entry/record keeping.

I replied that it really didn't matter - I would do anything. I understand this is a job, and the positions are few. This not about a vacation; this is about work.

He warned me that he thought I'd hate it after a month, because it was ""very Groundhog's Day"" meaning that the days would become repetitious very quickly. And they're going to be camping for 5 days, followed by 2 days at the Beshmo (the local hotel). 

Could I handle that? 

The answer is that it sounds hard; I'm concerned about my eyes; I need to get into shape; but no, I'm not scared off or daunted. Give me this chance.

The talk turned to Montana/Wyoming. A six-week dig is planned for these areas in June/July of 2002. Would I be interested?

Six weeks. I'm not sure I can take six weeks off from work. Not with the other things I've already planned for. Not with him planning to drive out. I'd have to fly back early, and that means money we don't have.

However...I need to be in the field before I can even think about going to Egypt. 
I need to see if I can handle the field. 
I need to prove myself."

"event","In 1999, a team of scientists left Philadelphia to explore the Bahariya Oasis in Egypt.  Hoping to find new specimens of dinosaurs destroyed in World War II bombings, they had more success discovering evidence of unknown flora and fauna.  Many of the results of their discoveries has been covered in the cable movie <i>The Lost Dinosaurs of Egypt</i>, as well as the book by that name.

My husband was on that team.  We were married less than three months before he departed for Egypt.  He traveled without the support of his employers, using all of his vacation time for 2000 as well as going a few weeks without pay, giving up the chance for a timely honeymoon so he could be involved on this journey.

For those left behind, it was a difficult trip to not be a part of.  

It's easy to say, ""Egypt is a third world country.""  It's harder to understand what that really means, and impossible to truly imagine what it's like to walk in such a world.  Even the simple convenience of a phone call becomes an issue.  The connections are tinny and delayed; the differing time zones make it difficult to be available at the same time; the cost is extravagant.  My first call to Bahariya was mostly made up of my laughing at our attempts to talk over the noise and the long long pauses between messages.

When Ferret came home, he was a stranger, his eyes haunted not as much by the primitive world he left behind, but more by the far-too-busy world he was re-entering.  And all the stories I wanted to hear aren't fully told.  

I would like to prevent that from happening, if I get to join the BDP 2004 team.

The chance isn't good that I'll go, of course.  I'm untried; I'm a bunny hugger; I've been told repeatedly that my tender heart will make it too hard for me to go to Egypt and feel any sort of peace about it.

And so I have to prove myself.  

I have many reasons for wanting to go.  I've been told I'm an unofficial member of the team.  Will (the book's author) dubbed me ""the group's memory"" while he was researching the story of the BDP.  I worked on some of the fossils from the first season.  I found, researched, and purchased sand goggles for the 2001 field season, after hearing the horror stories of sand storms and grit-filled eyes.  

Now, I want to go the next step.

I long to have the opportunity to go into the desert."

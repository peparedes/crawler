I saw Lynn a few days ago. Apparently she's been in a crappy mood because she had to watch a bunch of kids all weekend. That really sucks. Anyway, My uncle got all kinds of pissed at me and gave me back all my stuff. Apparently, he's given up on me. Fuck him. Anyways, I've just found an awesome band. I am soooo gonna find a way to see these guys live!!! Here's their website: http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewProfile&friendID=6637564&a=1 These guys are awesome. Just listen to Flame of Dismay!


Anyways, I finally got my insurance back. But now I've got a shitload more bills to pay. I also just got hired by Cranmore, so Bye bye Dunkin Donuts. MUAHAHAHAHA!!!

I love this music. It's positively evil!

I'm thinking I might have to go to the hospital again soon. (Don't ask). THis is going to totally fuck things up. But I've gotta do what I've gotta do.

ANyways, Gotta go to works (blah)

"event","It's been quite a while. Well, where to start? I was talking to Brandon's sister, Lynn, and we started kinda flirting. Gettin' nasty with it (surprised? I was!). I had to go back to work and she had to go, but just before she had to leave, she called me over to her and slipped me her phone number. She said ""call me sometime."" A few days later, I called her, and a couple of days in a row. I took her home once, where we watched Guess Who? with her mother. (we cuddled a little). We left with a firtive kiss goodbye. I came back a few days later as a surprise. But she had a headache. I haven't talked to her since, though I stopped at her work a few times. She didn't seem all that enthused, so I figured it was a bad time, and she might be feeling pressured. I've backed off for now. Don't want to be too aggressive. My Uncle doesn't approve of this, but what he doesn't know won't get me in trouble. She's a sweet girl, and (while she bears a strong resemblance) she is nothing like Brandon (Thank You GOD!!!!). So, I'm going to work out, a lot!!! I figure, since she's on the fence as to us being ""Official"" right now, If I make myself into the ""Sexy Beast,"" she'll come over to my side of the fence. I've even got the clothes to take her breath away. My uncle gave me an AWESOME!!! leather jacket for my birthday. (THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU). I've also got a light paisley shirt (yes, paisley) which, while it reminds me a lot of Night on the Rocksbury, supposedly looks really good on me.

Anyways, so I've got that in the works. The next big event, is I can't get a hold of Alex. (Alex! Where are you?!!) I did get a hold of Teddy, and he seems to be working on The Toad Project. Wicked cool. Really excited to see how that turns out.

I just found out yesterday that I'm not eligible for Chapter 31 (BOOO!!!!)....Yet. I also found out that I've been filling for the wrong disease and that I was misdiagnosed and then rediagnosed. So, if I can build a case and force them to give me a rating, I will be eligible. (Yesssss!!) The reason I haven't written in a while is because of my lack of computer. My uncle took all my computer and gaming away, to force me to concentrate on my life. So.....anyways. 


I also went to an Audition, and picked up a part in the play Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. It's a play by Tennessee Williams. (he's a sick bastard). It's a comedy, though a black one. I play the part of a Reverend Tooker. Kinda a coward and a self-righteous church man (for me, that's more than just a stretch. Kinda ironic really). Anyways, that's my life as of late.


Well.....sooo long, and good luck people."

"event","Holy SHIT!!! Yesterday was alright. I mean, I had a little fun, at least. Around the end of the night, Brittany told me to eat her, so that was funny. Today however.....


Today was a Hell Day. Everyone was in a pissy mood. My Folks were being obstanant and wanted me to let them help me take care of the whole vehicle. However, My Uncle wanted me to do it myself. Both wanted me to chose between the two of them. And my folks thought Uncle Brian was being abusive and too harsh. And my Uncle thinks I'm an immature little shit. And now, my Uncle thinks I'm playing My folks against My uncle, because I felt like shit because of how I'm living off of two 60 year old Disabled people, who are now dieing. I didn't hide it, and I didn't tell my folks off, because I was afraid of pissing anyone off. So in turn, I've pissed everyone off. I fucking hate my life. Well, my truck will be up and running, so soon this whole mess will be behind me. I have sooooo got to get out of here.

Well, I've got to wake up early to call Midas and schedule a muffler hang, and possibly a shock job. Gotta go, Laters."

Can't say much, not much time. Well, I went to the party....oh wait, you guys know about that. hmmm....Well, Afterwords I was starting to have car trouble. THe car died and I had to Junk it. I brought the truck in to be inspected, but there's some stuff wrong with it (go figure). It seems that now, my rear brakes suck, so I have to replace everything on them. I also have to replace a body mount (one of those important things that keeps the cab attached to the rest of the truck). I also have to replace my shocks. AAAAAANNNNNDDDDD, it seems that Northern Tire and Alignment wants to charge me $1.5k to do it (screw that!!!). SO I'm going to be doing it all. (oh yeah and I also have to replace my exhaust from the Catalytic converter back). GooddY!!!! In the meantime, we've had some bad flooding and stuff, so that kinda sucked. Oh well......ANyways, I gota go, so laters.

I saw Lords of War today. I would not suggest seeing that movie unless you want to be depressed as hell. If you do decide to see it, make sure you see another movie that is a guaranteed feel good....or you won't, I promise you that. 

I put my Voc-Rehab papers through. Should be getting a call any day now. That's right! Mikey's going to School!!! Yeah, baby! Yeah! Oh, Behave!

I also cleaned out both garages, the bathroom, and my bedroom, in the same day. Damn I'm good!....O.k. Maybe not, but it was still better than usual. >:O

;)  Anyways, My uncle is going to cut the bolts off of my truck for me (very cool) and help me fix the exhaust. I bought Meagan smokes (I know I shouldn't have, but....to hell with it). I hope everything is going good with everyone else out there. I'm starting to get a headache. Damn it!

I saw Lisa today. Apparently, she is around for the rest of the year (possibilities...hmmm....) :)) Anyways, she still hasn't heard back from Maria. I hope she's alright. She went to Boston and then New York. Bad places to go if you don't know the area (not that I do, mind you). I hope she gets back alright. And I hope she remembers to give me details if there IS going to be a party tommorrow (please, oh please!!!, I need this!!!) Anyways, if there is, it is going to be fun!!

Well they're kicking me out, so I've got to go.

"event","Well....(I need to find a new opening word <heh>) Today was a remarkable day (it would have to be, or why would I be writing?). To start off the day, I woke up, asked my uncle Brian what to do with my hair. He made me wait, and told me to work the bangs.Then he asked about the garage. FYI he had asked me to clean up the folks garage so that he could park his truck. If I did that, he'd buy me a battery. Anyways, he came over and showed me the mountain of shit I had to do for the garage. I had only an hour to do that and pick up Chaz (impossible). I told my family how impossible it was going to be, with the situation. They got all pissed off at me. I did some work and left. My folks understood after explaination, but my uncle didn't give a shit. He just wanted me to do what he asked me to. I didn't know yesterday what he wanted, or I'd have done it then!

Anyways, I left, picked up Chaz, and took him to his interview. He was pretty much hired. We were Stoked!!! He'll be working with me from now on! all of my shifts!!! Yesssss!!!!! ""Score one for the good guys!!!"" Anyways, we went back (because I forgot my computer) and got cigarettes, cashed my check, got my computer and his cd's. We stopped, got beer and celebrated. We also saw a movie. He now knows how shitty the Transporter 2 was. Anyways, we had a blast. We came to the Met, Got drunk out in the dark, and came inside.

This is gonna be good. I have a club thang with the Romainians tommorrow. Today has been a good day (after I left the house that is.) I also got the car battery. (Ha!! In your Face Uncle Brian!!!) I'll finish the garage when I'm damn good and ready!!! He probably thinks I won't do it either. Damn, won't he be surprised, when I have it done friday night.

Gotta go

So, of course, I'm going to be deep cleaning my bedroom and bathroom after work. Damn. Anyways, not much happening now. 

Saw Transporter 2. Fight scenes awesome, stunts, were absurd.
I also say A Place Like Heaven. I know, it's a chick flick, but I loved it.
I went to the club again and didn't get drunk. We i did drink though. Meg begged me to take them to Up Country. There was this psycho cop going around and checking people out. I swear he was out to arrest everyone. I swear he was going to get us. I just played cool. I doubt he suspected a thing. That's alright, there were TWO police cars at Up Country. It sucked too. The DJ was playing shit from the 80's I swear. GRRRRR..... 

Anyways, Meg want's me to go with them again on Friday so, I suppose I'll go again. They also want me to go with them on their last day in the U.S. and take them ALL to the Club. It'll be nice. Of course, I said yes. It'll be a good time (I hope).

"event","Well....Yesterday sucked. Meagan never showed up to our little meeting. I talked to her later and she has decided to break up with me.....forever. Ouch. Went drinking that night. Partied with Pam, Meg, Leo, and her friend. We had fun. I got blitzed. I had.....let us say, plenty. Stopped at Dunkin Donuts for an hour. Talked with people. Sobered up a little. Drove home (stupid, stupid, FUCKING STUPID!). Cops arrested everyone else by that point, so there was no one on the road. LUCKY. Not doing THAT again. Stomache wants to claw its way out of my chest....I'm dealing with it, though. John made fun of my being a wuss about my stomach ache/hangover (I guess an increadible stomach ache counts as a hangover). Going back to bar tonight.

Might meet someone new. Probably not though. THough THIS time I'm going to remain SOBER. (for the most part) Hopefully tonight isn't going to be another of those ""your gonna feel that in the morning"" situations. Maybe a, ""last night was fucking awesome"" situation. Don't know how that is going to work.

Meagan is probably going to be happier without me. It's the best thing for her really. I can't help her anymore. I don't know if I ever HELPED her. She knows how to reach me. If, in three years, she still wants to date, she can look me up. Online, my address/number will never change. Don't want to think about that anymore. I'll end up in another self-pity fueled haze. I don't need sympathy. I don't really need pity. I need.....a new outlet. Somewhere I belong. Something to do. A place to focus what energy I have left. And to build more. Maybe then I'll be able to start living, instead of merely existing.

God, feel like I'm gonna barf again. Can't believe I'm doing this again. Ah fuck it. Gotta be done.

Well, Tonight, I'd like to give a shout out to Teddy. I'd also like a reply to my question: How did you make such a huge network? How did you make that many friends? I mean, shit, there are so many people who are interested in your life. How did you do that? I'd like to know. TELL ME!!!!! Anyways. I'll give a Shout Out to Alex. Hey Alex, when I'm hanging out with you, I swear, it's one of the few times in the last 3 years that I've felt alive. I mean, truly alive. Thanks man. Just in case I die before tommorrow, Alex, Teddy, You guys are my Best Friends. I'd do anything I could to help you guys. I've got your back, and I know you've got mine. That is a real comfort. Meagan, I'm sorry things didn't work out. Please regard me kindly. (you'll probably end up racking your brain trying to figure out what that means, heh!). I told you I love you. I meant what I said. And even though I must be seperated from you, I still Love you. My spirit will be with you, always.

Mike was scared that I'd pass out and piss on something (happens when I black out). Instead, Chaz blacked out, fell off Mike's couch, banged his neck on the little table and got up and pissed on mikes fucked up chair. Yeah....Shit was funny. Gave him a lift home, and promised to take him up to Dunkin Donuts to get an application. We did...on the way, I found out how much Rogaine costs....$30! Holy unorthodox shit, batman! WTF! Anywhoo.....I hope Chaz can work with me....I'll be his ride, so if he does get the job, he'll be working my shifts....Shit'll be cool.

Up at the met now. He had to get the headphones out of the car, because he can't stand the fucking music in this place....Can't say as I blame him....shit's driving me nuts too.


Anyways, I got a message from Meagan.

I wonder if she knows how much this shit fucks with my head?

Anyways.....Well....Damn it. 

I think I'll just concentrate on getting Chaz the job, for now.

Still don't know if meagan wants me to see her tommorrow, or even if she does....where to go.

"event","I can't stand feeling like this....I don't know what's wrong with me. I mean, My head's all scrambled. When I think about her, I can't concentrate on what's around me. And when I start to worry about her, I get a sharp pain around where my heart is. Like a knife. I can't help worrying. I mean, I was talking to her about how wonderful I was feeling (first time in a long time) and I mentioned the bright horizons ahead of us. I told her that my new purpose is: Love. To experience love in all it's myriad forms. (save for a few....not going there). I want to gain more experience, I know that I will eventually reach one of my treasured goals. You see, One thing I want, before I die, is to meet The One. I mean, the person who completes me. A person who will love me because I am me, and whom I will love because she is her. I want to marry her, maybe have children with her. Grow old together. And when I mentioned that there have been and possibly will be many in between the here and that fateful time. 

She started talking in very small print, got all depressed. And logged out after saying that she hopes I find her. I know she was holding back tears on her end. Damn it Meagan! Don't you know that I love you! There is little that can be done to change that. And that probably will never change. Please, Please, be safe. I don't know where you are now, or what you are doing. But if I pray for anything ever again, it will be that you are happy. I want you to be happy, no matter what that takes, Even if it means that we won't be together again. I bend all of my thought and love upon you Meagan. 

Remember, from now into eternity, When you are feeling sad, depressed. When it seems the world is turned against you. Close your eyes, and look into your heart. I will be there, waiting to hold you, kiss you and whisper into your ear, ""Meagan, sweetheart, don't worry. Everything will be alright in the end. You'll see. ::wink:: )

"event","Wow....I absolutely Love Vandread. That is, by far, my favorite obscure Anime movie of all time. At this point, it even beats out (dare I say it) Dragon Ball (Z) (GT)! It reminds me of why I am still alive. It reminds me of the things that keep me in this world. The feelings, and emotions that come with being in love, and in sharing your heart with another...and finding reciprocation in that....It is truly something to be treasured. I think I have rediscovered my purpose in life, base though it be. 

I may have goals, dreams, and aspirations, but those will come second to that one thing: My one true desire and the one thing I have my heart set on. It is the one thing that I will seek, until I find it, in this life or the next. It is the nectar of my existance. It is to find true love and happiness, with someone special. Someone who will experience things both like my and unlike me. A person who will love me because I am me, and whom I can love because she is her. And all the ones that will I will know between here and the day I meet my one true love.....I will share my heart with them, and pour my own love into them, until they can feel it as I do: At times, Bursting at the seams, ready to move out and take charge. 

I know it may be silly for me to feel that way after watching one anime series...But that does not change the fact that I do. Its moments like this, and the feelings I have, right now, at this very moment, that make life worth living. It is my ability to feel like this that makes me glad to be alive. Even when it is dark outside, and my twilight seems just around the corner, if I can remember this feeling, and all of the feelings like this, then I know I can pull through. It almost seems funny, how I can be sooooo down one moment, and so increadibly miserable, so wretched that I would desire nothing more than to be erased from time and space, from eternity and memory. And then, all it takes is one small thing, and I start seeing things in a different light, and I am filled with this emotion.....It nears Joy or bliss......The only thing that would bring me closer to it would be to have my one true love, next to me, right now. 

I know the future isn't set, and I don't know how this is all going to play out. It would be boring if we knew what was going to happen next, wouldn't it? But that is the great thing, because even though we know that there are going to be hard times, bad times, sad times, we also know that there are going to be good times, great times, and perfect moments. Even if we have to be a little shallow to experience the true joy of the moment, if but for that moment, then I would gladly bring myself closer to the surface. I don't think I have ever met someone who was truly happy and not a little shallow.....then again I have never met anyone who truly met either of those descriptions, so....who knows.......Wow. I think I have probably driven away any audience I would have had at this point............................................................................Oh well....La De DA.......

And, before I forget to mention it, I noticed several weeks ago, that someone wearing lipstick had kissed my driver side window......I am not quite sure who did that. I rarely think on it long enough to ask anyone. I mean, sure, I have plenty of suspects......Though, if I was there when this happened, please don't take offense, I just don't remember anyone doing it when I was there. As far as I know, it could have been Meagan, Britney or my Niece.....Though it probably wasn't my niece, since she's too short to reach that high, and, at 5 years old, probably isn't going to be wearing make up (if she is.....oh, boy...I am going to be seriously cross). The only reason she is even included is because she might do something like that. 

God, I am so happy......I better take a shower and bask in my happiness....before it fades into mediocrity.

"event","Well.......(I know, I start talking the same way each time ;P ) Today was.....interesting. It seemed yesterday was going to be the icing on the cake so to speak. I was getting all depressed over Meagan, so I wasn't eating much and sleeping less..... So, at 3 am, I took a shower and when I went in my room to go to sleep, my grandfather sat me down and asked me if I was doing drugs. It really sucked having to convince him that I'm not doing drugs (they know nothing of what's been happening).....It's sweet that they were worried but sickening to realize that that was the first thing they thought. 

Then today, I go to work. Sometimes, Irony CAN be funny (it helps when you are not the one involved). Meagan wanted to work with Eric, and she was making today her last day.........Yeah....anyways, the Irony came to me when I realized that Eric was leaving at 1:00 and Meagan was coming in at 1:00. And then there was the part about today being her last day.....That sucks....I kinda felt the bottom of my stomach fall out on that one. THEN to top it all off, she leaves early. WTF!!! It really really sucked.

Another thing of note today was that I discovered that I actually made Meagan jealous....Wow....Didn't think 'I could actually do that.....hmm....It is curious though....and sweet. She can be soooooo sweet. I swear to GOD! It's like a line out of a movie, ""Just when I think I'm out, They Pull Me Back In!"".....Though kinder and far gentler. I could swear that it's just at the moment when I think I am healing, all of a sudden, she does something sooooo sweet, or makes me think of something, or says something, or thinks something, and it changes how I'm feeling about it. I mean, usually, I'm trying to back off, give her room, so that I can let go when she finds someone new, leaving little more than a pleasant memory, but.........it's times like this that make trying to do that hard.


I hate here dial-up connection....I swear the lag is killing me. I have absolutely no Idea what she is doing at this point....I can't even confirm her status at this point.

She even thinks that it's because I'm a slow typer that she can't communicate with me fast enough. I'm sorry sweetheart, but technology is on my side here. Let's see here: you are running off of a connection that can only transfer data at 56 kilobytes per second...that can be disconnected by someone else at any time.......whilest I am on a connection that can transfer....basically 54000 kilobytes per second, and cannot be disconnected by the service provider, so.....

;P

Anyways................God Damn It....She was disconnected, or something....I can't communicate with her...What the Fuck!!!


I hope to God she is all right.......O.K. I'm going to wait long enough to tell her I love her and post this on my Journal and Myspace.....

"event","Greetings. Unfortunately this is going to be a rather quick posting, much to do not much time to do it in. Anyways...wow. Today was interesting, to say the least. Eric was alright, though......some old lady came by and told him she wanted to go out (she, as in someone else, not the old lady....[""Things that make you sit up and go..........buwuwuwuwuwu""-Ron White]) Curious. John and Rhod were out having some sort of secret meeting on the picnic tables....unsure about what that was about. I'm almost certain it had to do with work (If it was a friendly conversation, they could do that anywhere. Even a private conversation could be done outside of work....this was definitely something to do with work....why does this worry me?....We'll see. 

Eric used John's headset (you know, the one no one else is allowed to use) so that there was four of us with headsets. I think he did it to avoid Brandon, though he flirted with Britney too.....tough call.

John sent Eric home (no, John had the uber-secret meeting a while after that), so that left me, Jeremy, Brandon, and Britney. Now, I don't mind so much that he sent Eric home, though I would have rather it had been Brandon....However, that put Britney on headset with me and Jeremy. We had some fun....Oh YEAH! It was great, I created the Jersey story and Britney's new Nickname (this time, John might not interfere, since he doesn't know what it means) You see, Britney told me she was all proud that she got to wear a Jersey at school, even though she (being a girl) doesn't play football. At first I made cracks at how she got the uniform then a new tale wove itself in my mind.

Combining the Exotic dancer, bumped up to call-girl, and the Jersey, I came up with this.: I asked Britney what number her Jersey was. She said #80....I said, ""That's some advertisement!"" She looked at me funny, then I said, ""That Jersey was #80 right?"" She said, ""Yeah"" ""You know that sign that's outside of a lot of McDonalds."" ""No, which one?"" ""The one that says 1 million served."" She turned red. ""Yeah?"" ""Well, that's 80 satisfied customers."" She got all embaressed and laughed. I said, ""By the way was Eric #80, or is he #81?"" She gott a little.....snippy for a few minutes. I continued to tease her about it, remarking that at the rate she was going, two weeks and she'll be in triple digits, one year, quadruple, and so on. She started her bumping up against me thing. So I started the whip my foot like Chun Li (from Street Fighter) and kick her ass (literally) The first hour or so of that she was pissy. When I wasn't as hard with it, she was saying she liked it....(kinky ;) ) Anyways, we were like this for the rest of the night. I swear, by the end of the night, we were swimming in pheromones (hormones released into the air, which, if properly applied, attracts the opposite sex. It's proven! It exists, both in animals [obviously] and in humans.) My heart was starting to go into my throat. I remember we got an order for A large Mocha Iced Latte, and she started to make it, she gave it to me and said, in her coy manner, almost giggling, 'Wanna do it?' I kinda off hand said sure, then, when I pieced it together 2 seconds later I kinda blushed. She was already blushing. Damn girl......wow.  We do get each other going, don't we? 

Another interesting happening, is that Rhod and Tonya called me into the office and told me that the girl they thought might be good for me (Ann) was interested in meeting me......O.K. Kinda apprehensive. I'm going to basically be going on a blind double date (never done that before. Hell, I've never been on a blind date before). They say I know her, but I'm not sure. They say she's a heavy-set girl, kinda like Heather was, but with much bigger breasts (would be awesome if I really liked huge breasts) She's apparantely not a super-model, but she isn't a fucking gorilla like Amanda. And She isn't as heavy as Pam, so I might be in for a treat. They say she has a great personality [if they have to tell you that, watch out. Though, they might be on the ball here. We'll just have to wait and see.]. I swear to God, if she's Fugly, I am soooooo gonna kick Rhod's ass!!! Then again, If she isn't as ugly as Amanda, she can't be Fugly, [I mean, look at Amanda's Sister.....if she didn't look so much like Amanda, she'd by fucking Hot] or maybe she is, just not to Rhod or Tonya. I hope this works out....pleeeeaaaaassseeeee let this be a good thing.)"

"event","Well....Things are looking up, a bit. To start off with, I ended up cleaning the basement for the folks....without them asking. They freaked out. My grandmother thought I was on drugs. She wouldn't believe me at first at all. Then after I swore up and down that I wasn't on drugs, she tried to bribe me $300. I turned her down. Felt good.

Also, now when I get jealous or I worry that Meagan is....anyways, When I feel like crap and start worrying the crap out of myself, I can now just sing Hunter by Dido to myself. I mean, it's what she want's right? She wants to be single again, and she doesn't want me to feel bad about it. So, this is the cure. Force myself to accept that she does not want to be stuck with me, and that she wants to go out into the world herself. After that, I force myself to accept that I'm alone now....by singing I stand Alone by Godsmack.....If I need to psyche myself up to do whatever I want, I sing I'll do anything by Damizza and N.U.N.E.

So, it sort of works. My heart still hurts. But it is starting to get better. It's going to be hard, but maybe this will make it easier. I know Godsmack will make me angry....but I suppose I need to do that. Sear a little bit of myself to close the wounds, I also listen to Poem by Taproot now whenever I get suicidally depressed. It seems to work a bit. I don't feel so crappy afterwards (still crappy, but just not as bad). To keep moving, Blank Earth by Chevelle and Getting Away With Murder by Papa Roach. Force myself to keep walking. I may be hurt, but I have two good legs. I have these arms that still work. I am battered, beaten, but I am still together. Most of me is still here, and that's what counts. I must take what I have, and keep what I've learned close to my heart. The lessons I have learned this time and every time are what will keep me alive. I must keep going, if not for me, then for those who have come before and those who will come after me. I can not, must not, give up again.

Though I must drag myself through the dusty road paved by my own transgressions, I will not surrender any more of myself. I will not give any more than I can afford to lose. I am not going to fail. This is not the end of me, the is the end of what I once was. I will survive. I am more than a match for this progressive anti-climatic tragedy. This will strengthen the core of my being, for what does not kill me, shall scar me, thus making me more impervious to harm. With my scars, I will be armed, and with what heart I have, I will love with discretion, but my anger shall prove my own pillar.

No longer will I subject my heart to the battering of the random whims of those I love. A shield for myself will I create. I shall hide in myself and be safe. Within my own sanctuary will I retreat, until this storm subsides, and I can see the sun again. I shall not be swept up into the vast ocean of my own sadness. So I will shore up the doors and resist the coming tide. I will wait out the storm, for as all things, this too shall pass.

Wow....I ranted for quite some time....I think I'll use that in a song at some point.....Anyways.  Starting to feel down.....Not good. Must feel better. Well, Time to post for today.


Music for today:
Hunter-Dido
Blank Earth-Chevelle
Getting Away With Murder-Papa Roach
I Stand Alone-Godsmack
Poem-Taproot
I'll Do anything-Damizza and N.U.N.E.




No matter what I do to my heart, what was said still stands. I love you Meagan.

I just....Need to create some space....

Sweet Dreams Sweetheart (no pun intended....no really!)

"event","Well......Today....I almost got into it again with my folks. I sooooo need to move out. This shit is getting really, really old. I was just told that if I get a bike, I'm going to be thrown out. WTF? There's no need for this shit. I have got to get myself in a better position. Whatever I need to do, that's what I'm going to do. I cleaned the room, and the bathroom, but I didn't fix the car yet.....I wish I had, so that it would be out of the way, finally. 

I tried calling Meagan, but I got an answering machine. I left a message, but she'll probably not get it. She's probably lost her phone by now, or.......she just is too busy....with other things. Oh well......This sucks. I tried to write Open Heartache, but (no pun intended) my heart wasn't in it. I'll have to do it some other time. I think i'm going to try to write something else though.

o.k.......not feeling the magic today.....damn it. Oh well........Some other time then. It's wicked late. I'm going to do some stuff, then go to sleep, so I can deal with the stupid bullshit tommorrow...then, thursday, I get to leave the house and do something else.....(yay!!!)........I soooo need a life. :(  I want a life different from my own. I'm tired of doing the same stupid bullshit day in and day out. I'm tired of not doing anything cool or interesting. I know I'm meant to do something else. Something better than this shit. Why? Why did I end up in this fucked up place, in these fucked up situations, living, and being raised, by these enormously fucked up people?

This sucks.......This is another one of those days that require a quote from JTHM (Johnny The Homicidal Maniac) (i'm paraphrasing, so bear with me): 'It's been another one of those days. I was looking in the Mirror, and I saw someone on the other side, not unlike myself. I started wondering, and imagined that over there, life was different. That people were not the fucked up little shits that they are here. I tried to go there, but, as usual, that barrier stopped me. I know that if I had waited just a few more seconds..........Ahhh Fuck.........I think I'm going to go kill a party clown.'

Yeah, that was fucked up, but he is fucked up......even though I can almost kinda get what he is saying, about how fucked up everything is......though, thank God, I don't have nearly the same reaction. (not into the whole homicidal thing. I like people too much. I care about human life too much. Wouldn't mind killing myself though......hmmmm......No, not today. Not Today.) 

Well as usual......anyways......well I can't say much.

Good night peoples. Sweet dreams Meagan.

"event","Well, I hate this computer. I just lost everything I wrote for the past Half Hour......(IT IS NOT FUNNY!!!!!).

Time to start fresh.

Today wasn't all that bad, really. We weren't busy, and I didn't viciously beat Brandon (probably because we weren't busy). John put me in charge of him, and told me to tell him if Brandon gets out of line at all! Pretty harsh. Brandon straightened up though. I think it might of been the way John had said it that finally tipped Brandon off that he was on the verge of lossing his job. I'll give John a good report today though. He did everything I asked him to do with minimal fuss. Everything was done by the time I was ready to go.

Interestingly enough, it seems that Katie believes that Britney has a Major crush on me and Eric (I soooo agree with that last one) and that Meagan has a huge crush on Scott (WTF?). I don't know why she would think that......I suppose it's possible. But I doubt Scott would go out with her. Openly, he hates Meagan, and Britney, so......I don't know. Anyways. Today was alright until John sent Britney home and gave Brandon a headset. I was having fun DAMN YOU! You fucking Tiajuana SHIT TACO!!! I love how she denies everything anyone would imply as to how she really feels when she is around me. I have no idea what is the truth (yes, if you do get it, I Can be that dense at times. The only time she doesn't deny anything is when I start talking about some made up naughty thing she did. (example. Now this is a product of a few days of mixing shit around in my head to get this fucked up conclusion [fake conclusion, btw.......I'm.....o.k. I'm almost sure she would do this]. Now when Eric was getting ready to leave, he came up to her and gave her a penny and told her that it was for a 'job well done last night.' Of course, I teased her about it. So the next day, Pam complains about there being a sticky spot out in the dining area, where gnats have congregated. I told Britney that that was probably from her 'job well done last night.' Obviously the penny was for her ""good job,"" [why yes, I am a serious pervert.....and I'll probably never change]. He couldn't come up with the rest of the required money. I said she was like one of those cellular phone companies, with long distance charges ::wink, wink:: and 50 cents to connect, and a rate of 10 cents a minute. Pam agreed. We all teased Britney about it. She turned a little red and giggled. It was funny.) 

Anyways. I really, Really, REALLY miss Meagan.........I hate this Open Heartache. Maybe I'll write a song about that (unless, of course, I discover that it has already been written, which would suck seeing as it would probably be better than anything I would write anyways.) I'm thinking about calling her. Except that I'm Afraid. No not just afraid. I'm TERRIFIED. I'm scared that I'll call her while she in the middle of something I don't really want to know about. It would be the end of me. I don't know what would happen. The only thing I know for certain is that it would break me. So, I think I'll email her.....except that even if I email her or I'm her, I won't find out that she does want me to call her until Thursday. (this sucks. I have three days off and I don't even have anything fun to do. I don't have any money, because of that whole thing with Alex, and I won't be able to come to the Met, until thursday, cause I won't have enough gas otherwise). I think tommorow, I'll change my oil filter, flush and replace the oil in my car, and, provided my family has the proper tools, change the remaining two spark plugs. If I have time, I'll clean my bathroom and Bedroom. Then Tommorrow I'll call her. 8:00ish. If I'm going to be destroyed, well, I might as well get it over with. If it is going to happen it's going to happen. But I'm going crazy not knowing how she is doing, or what she is doing, or how she feels, or anything at all from her. The worst part is, I know the moment she is back in school, she'll be dating some other dude. I'll probably never hear from her after that.....That would really, really, Really, REALLY suck ludicrously large donkey nuts. 

I hate feeling like this. But I can't tear myself away from it. This feels just like 40 days and 40 nights. The movie with Josh Hartnett ( That dude is awesome. I can totally get why women would totally want that guy, he kicks ass!). The only difference is I don't have that other really cool chick to fall in love with, and Meagan isn't a complete sociopathic cunt from a hellish region, previously undisclosed due to it's horrendous nature, like that other chick was. And (o.k. this might sound gay, because guys aren't supposed to know how hot guys are, but with this dude it is so obvious) i'm also not nearly as scorchingly hot as that dude was. Nor nearly within the same ecosphere of cool. Or as unbelievable lucky. Damn....If he wasn't totally awesome, I'd hate that dude. O.k. If you haven't seen that movie, I seriously suggest seeing that movie. It is totally wicked. Anyways, I have probably written up pages of stuff by this point, so I shall sign off now, and probably search for stuff. I'll Email Meagan and ask her if she wants me to call her, or if she wants to talk at all. And IM her goodnight.


Today's music list was........pretty much the same as yesterdays, except I replaced I Stand Alone, with Here With Me-Dido

"event","Well.......(isn't it funny how I start everything off the same way?) Today....To start off with, Brandon Sucks! I absolutely cannot stand that kid anymore. By the end of the day, I wanted to hand him upside down outside of the store from a lightpole by his balls, suspended over a tank of starving piranhas, so that a. he would die the moment he stopped being a man physically, and b. so that they could never reattach his nuts. I think Britney wanted to carve out his heart with a spork. Scott was, in all likelihood, looking for some way to 'accidentally' set the asshole on fire. I mean, he has been here all of, what...4 months, and he still can not: a. keep his hot coffee brewed, b. keep his ice coffee filled, c. take care of the majority of his customers, d. satisfactorily complete any assignment he is given, and the list goes on, and on, and on, like a guest list for ozzfest. I swear, if that kid thinks he is getting into my drivethru tommorrow........I'll just say that......he'll be in serious need of a plastic surgeon.

According to Scott, me and britney were at each others throats for the majority of the day. In reality, I was just casually flirting, and she was getting bitchy because of our situation. I mean, Katie had to work at Shaws from about 5 on, so it was 4 of us for an hour. (could have been longer. I wasn't paying attention. I was trying not to get arrested for brutal assault) Either way, we could not hold it together, things were going all sorts of wrong yesterday. Whats worse, is we have to, not only go through it again, BUT....AS IF Brandon wasn't enough....We have to DEAL WITH PAM TOO! What THE FUCK!!!!! Jesus christ, Mary Mother of GOD, TIJUANA SHIT TACO! Does John hate me?!

Anyways, I noticed that Meagan hasn't posted anything within the last few days, except to reply to my email (thanx sweetheart, I love you too. ;) ) Anyways, I hope she's alright and not doing anything I wouldn't do >:|.......or anything I might do ;). I simply pray that Brandon survives tommorrow, because if he pulls the same crap today as he has apparently every other day for the past 3 months......I am going to be in need of a really, really, really good attorney....and Brian is going to be in need of a really, really, really good janitor. I am going to be sooooooo happy when HE goes back to school ( I hope you get the crap beaten out of you by gorrila women, for the next 3 years, you prick!) Either way, I will, damn near, die laughing if I found out that Britney and Scott joined forces and double-teamed his ass, and ended up burying his pathetic ass in some nasty medical waste dumpster in a run down hospital.......::maniacal, scary, evil laugh::.....sometimes, a good laugh is all you need. Now if I could find one of those, I'd be all set.
Maybe it's like Ron White said, ""If life gives you lemons, make lemonade.....and then.......find someone who's life has given them vodka....and have yourself a party!""




Music selection today (much like yesterday) is:

O.K. Now that that is done with....Where are you Meagan????? I miss you.......Damn it.

Well...you know what they say....'another day, another dollar.' I just hope tommorrow isn't the 'Same Shit, Different Day.'

Well, goodnight peoples....Sweet dreams everyone(especially you.......yeah, you know who you are.......................O.k......Meagan!) Whatever brings you peace and happiness in the dark hours of the night, may it find you there, and bring you into the deepest dreams of peace, happiness, and pleasure.
I love you. Goodnight.

"event","I'm writing this at the end ( no surprise) and now I'm trying to remember what I wanted to say(once again, no surprise). I think that my whole thing with Eric is just that....well....I remember being that age...and I never got the attention he gets...hell, I don't get nearly what he got just by appearing on the scene. It's not like I hate him, he's cool, but...well....I wish I knew how he did that. And how to do that. Damn it. It sucks being my age. I have no where to meet people now (not that I did well in High school, mind you....though there was that one time....but I moved away...Damn it.) I swear I have the worst luck with that anyways.

I sooooo need to get back in shape. (kill the flab....Die motherfucker Die! [for those not of the military, it's something we were supposed to say when we were practicing our MCMAP, things like bashing peoples faces into our knees, and stabbing them with knives attached to the end of an unloaded M-16 <I think it's called a Berret?>]). I'm thin again, but I'm weak. I just need to build my muscle back up again. Anyways......I want to go back south again.....damn it! With Alex as my Wingman....I'd have absolutely nothing to worry about. Come to think about it, even with Tony as my wing man, I did really well. (a story best saved for some other time.....or maybe not. Depends on who you are as to whether you even want to know [or should know])...Don't you love how I do the thoughts within thoughts within thoughts? anyways. 

I don't think Britney has any Idea...I swear to god, when she....anyways. I don't think either of them know...O.K. Meagan would know, but Britney is probably oblivious. She tries though. Poor kid. She lost her contact lens in the sink while I was lost (I told her she shouldn't have let Eric give her that money shot) She was freaking out about how she lost it, then...magically, just before she leaves, she finds it in the sink....Go figure. I don't know why the bouncy step is so weird? I mean, I listen to something that makes me happy, or whatever, and I kind of get a bounce in my step, a groove if you will. I like it, damn it. Like.....O.k. Don't laugh....I was listening to Milkshake by Kelis and it put this bouncy groove in me, and Britney was like, why are you acting so weird? Whatever.

O.K.....that was odd. The waitress at the met dropped off a post it with me (i suppose) in bed dreaming of smoothies  and the words Bed Time Almost underneath it. I guess this is the nice way of kicking me out. ;)

Today was sort of productive, I posted like crazy. WHy hasn't Meagan updated? Either she's too busy, or everything going on with her would hurt and she doesn't want me to find out. ( I suppose)

My dreams, hopes and wishes will come true...some day. I will wait as patiently as I can for that day. In the meantime, I must deal with the peace and the misery, as it comes.

Now for the Music Selection of the period:
Here With Me-Dido

"event","I think I did it again..........I pissed off Meagan.......Letting my mouth (figuratively speaking) run off with me....I said I wanted to Kill the dude who got her on Heroin..........Until I found out it was her ex fiance............Fuck. What can I say? Nothing..............Nothing for me to say. I hate drugs. I hate them because of what they do to people, and what they'd do to me. I know if I ever went to the hard drugs.......I would be over.......I was thinking about acid......Going to try that some day......but not today.......Maybe in college. But I'll never do barbituates again...That shit fucks you up.

Well. I hate this. I always feel like crap. I always end up saying something stupid, or something bad (stupid)which ends up freaking people out (the people I don't want to freak out). It sucks.

Oh well.........Gotta lot of damage control in the near future. Figures. Anyways I absolutely love this music.....Not the stuff at the met mind you....I'm all set with this middle-eastern, coffee house, latino, wanna-disembowl-myself-with-a-soup-spoon music. I'm talking Metallica. Disturbed. Kick ASS! Rock on.

Anyways.

Much Love to all you peoples. Even the wierd dude kicking nothing off his shoes outside. And most especially to Meagan, whom I've pissed off and freaked out countless times, and still loves me.

"event","Well......it seems I'm the only one keeping a journal at this point. I suppose it doesn't matter. Oh well. I don't know what to say. I saw Meagan at work, and managed to keep myself together. I found out Eric's Bi (who told her anyways, sam?....and if she did, how does sam know?) Anyways......This is the last time I help out a friend....I gave alex a shitload of money to keep his sorry ass out of Jail, and now i'm 240 dollars in debt. Folks can't know though. THey'd kill me out right. Anyways. God I feel like shit. I can't even get a hair cut now. Damn it! Oh well. Wow.....This music is really, really depressing the shit out of me......sucks. 

I really need to get moving again. I had a song this morning, but I didn't write it down. (damn spontaneous creativity, why can't you work when it's convenient? ;)  ) Anyways, Things are not going to be easy......but are they ever? I'll still see her on sundays, but.....the thing is......argh to hell with it. The only way to not be jealous is to give up all care, and I can't do that. Shit blows. I wish I could do this: ""Like a snake, shed my skin. Leave my past where I've been. can you feel what I feel? Hold on, must be killed. Don't cry over what's been spilled. Can you feel what I feel? Can you? Can you? Can you? Can you? Can you feel what I feel? Can you feel what I feel? Can you? Can you? Can you? Can you? Can you feel what I feel?""

There's so much I have to do, and yet I don't even know where to begin. There's still so much left undone. Things left unsaid, and moments unshared. I wonder when I will. I don't have time to stop and think anymore. I must plunge headfirst. I must struggle and go quickly, because I have lost too much time from indecision. Shits going to happen. And I don't know how everything is going to come out. I might do well, or I might fail. and if failure means I die, inside and out......then I will do everything I must to succeed. 

Time to take what has been drilled into me, the training, and the discipline, and put them to use.

And this overwhelming numbness attaches itself to the base of my cerebelum. My heart is doing jumping jacks and all I want to do is die. Why am I letting this get to me? I don't know. I think this has been a long time coming. I am going to go away for a while. I don't know If i'm going to bring mike back. 

Well. Everything happens for a reason right? Guess I'll figure out soon enough.

Well. I went on my get away from it all vacation, only to come back with more of what I wanted to leave behind in the first place. sigh.........

I got a new hairstyle, a new tattoo, a new phone and a new computer. Cool.

More worries, and still depressed. Not good.

this goes out to someone out there (you know who you are):

What the hell can I say? Congratulations? Have a happy life. Of course I love you. Of course I'll miss you. Here's an amendment to what I said earlier: ""Sometimes to protect the ones you love, and to do what's right, you have to give up the people and things that you love the most, Even your dreams."" Now I must carve new dreams. Even though this will hurt. Even though I will be as a lame gazelle, waiting to be picked off by the next able predator. I must do what Is right. I love you. And because of this and despite myself I am letting you go.


All of my love and wishes go out to you, my tortured rose, sharp as always, yet always in bloom. I will remember you.

here's the 411.

Meagan went on vacation for a week, and I didn't realize that she really wanted me to call her. (after that whole thing with John, I wasn't sure).

I ordered a new computer, so in all likelyhood, the next update will be from my laptop. (cool beans!)

My aunt and uncle want to take me somewhere with them tommorrow, so I've got to go with them. (they won't tell me what we're doing, so it's still up in the air as to whether or not I actually want to go.

I'm gonna go and hang with alex after that (god knows I really, really need it by now). I'm so tired. the drugs the shrink put me on have lost their effect. Anyways,

Whatever.

Anyways, Today is another sordid day. I'm still tired as hell, my whole right side is tense and is giving me shit.....Goody! Not in the best of Happy, happy, spank you later moods. Feeling kinda BLAH! Had some interesting insights which I will not share with a single soul save one, so don't expect me to tell you because I won't.....You don't want to know them anyways. Trust me.

Played Ninja Gaiden last couple of days. Awesome game.....Until the fifth level, where you face these evil ninja that throw fucking exploding shirukens, which are almost impossible to avoid. Did I mention that they appear in large groups, and are almost impossible to kill? Oh, yeah, and they're nearly impossible to hit and appear almost constantly. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!


Fucking Ninjas!

Oh well, I'll probably go back and get my ass kicked again and again. Like I said, except for the ninjas it's rather fun.

""If I were an evil version of myself, where would I be?"" ""He's probably hiding in his massive fortress."" ""I have a fortress? NICE!........Ergh, Uh, I mean...hehe....Let's go get him."" ""With what?! without my army, we don't have anything to fight him with!"" ""Oh yeah! We have two things, Megas, and the element of surprise!"" [Megas springs huge oil leak, alarms going off] ""well, at least we still have the element of surprise.""

Good times. 

Anyways, where are those tick tacks I demanded?! Why don't I have my tick tacks!? You shall suffer for this transgression!

Oh......My.......GOD! I almost don't have anything to write!

Oh well.

Laters!"

"event","I have returned. Last few days have been hecktick. What should I do? What should I say? ARGH! Teddy tells me not to force my will. Need to quit with the Pygmalion Project. Very bad. If she wants what she wants then I can't stop her. Isn't that what Ghandi proved?!

I can say this:
7. The End Of Heartache

Seek me, call me
I'll be waiting

This distance, this dissolution
I cling to memories while falling
Sleep brings release, and the hope of a new day
Waking the misery of being without you

Surrender, I give in
Another moment is another eternity

(Seek me) For comfort, (Call me) For solace
(I'll be waiting) For the end of my broken heart
(Seek me) Completion, (Call me) I'll be waiting
(I'll be waiting) For the end of my broken heart

You know me, you know me all too well
My only desire - to bridge our division

In sorrow I speak your name
And my voice mirrors my torment

(Seek me) For comfort, (Call me) For solace
(I'll be waiting) For the end of my broken heart
(Seek me) Completion, (Call me) I'll be waiting
(I'll be waiting) For the end of my broken heart

Am I breathing?
My strength fails me
Your picture, a bitter memory

For comfort, for solace
(Seek me) For comfort, (Call me) For solace
(I'll be waiting) For the end of my broken heart
(Seek me) Completion, (Call me) I'll be waiting
(I'll be waiting) For the end of my broken heart

4. Rose Of Sharyn

Numb and broken, here I stand alone
Wondering what were the last words I said to you
Hoping, praying that I'll find a way to turn back time
Can I turn back time?

What would I give to behold
The smile, the face of love?
You never left me
The rising sun will always speak your name

Numb and broken, here I stand alone
Wondering what were the last words I said to you
It won't be long, we'll meet again

What would I give to behold
The smile, the face of love?
You never left me
The rising sun will always speak your name

It won't be long, we'll meet again
Your memory is never passing
It won't be long, we'll meet again
My love for you is everlasting

I mourn for those who never knew you

It won't be long, we'll meet again
Your memory is never passing
It won't be long, we'll meet again
My love for you is everlastin


Can't think of more to say......very tired. Physically, Physiologically, emotionally exhausted. Want to sleep forever.

Farewell....For Now."

Lost what I'd just entered 10 minutes ago. Bastard Computer!


Oh, well. 

I'll just have to say it again.

Anyways, Thursday was the big day. I went to a bar called Up Country. Rhod and Tonya were supposed to meet me. But they didn't. I left and went to see the Wedding Crashers. It sucked. I got so disgusted, I didn't even finish it. I went, got in my car, drove 15 ft and got pulled over. They didn't arrest me, they gave me a verbal warning for not turning my head lights on in the middle of the night. (whoops)

So I went back to the Bar and started drinking again. Many, many peoples were there. I had a kick ass time! Met somebody who reminded me of someone I served with, but it wasn't him (unfortunately) But I also met Paul. He comes in sometimes and gets a medium hot coffee, hazelnut, extra extra. It was cool. I met a friend of his, Allison. And fifteen minutes later, I felt her up (at her request). She wanted a third opinion, as to which breast was bigger. When she went to go dance, Paul called me a bastard, as it had taken them 3 months to get to that point, when it took me all of 15 minutes. I smiled, and we laughed over it. Drank some more, Mike got me to attempt to dance.

I was liquered up enough to almost have rythym. Definitly going back next week. I'm giddy with anticipation. Went to work yesterday, with a splitting headache (hangover?) BUt I ate some food and it went away (total hangover time: 30 minutes AWESOME!). I was convinced to stay at Dunkin Donuts for good reasons. So I won't be leaving quite yet. AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!

Got High Hopes for today. Working with good fun peoples today. Only had 5 hours sleep. I'll deal. Not as tired as expected. See! The sun shines even on a dog's ass sometimes! (New York Proverb-from Jersey Girl) Who got the Hooch, Baby!? Who got the only sweetest thing in the world? Who got the Love? Who got the Freshy-Freshy? Who got the only sweetest thing in the world? Let's get real! Let's get Heavy.....Till the water breaks the Levy. Let's get loose. Loose, who got the hooch?


All right time to finish this bad boy.

Damn computer accessibility keys. Bill Gates, you BASTARD!


Oh well, Be Well! Turn the frown upside down.

Don't be sad, be glad! Think of Happy things! Like Chocolate, Teddy bears, and sex!-Shelly"

"event","With a sigh, I look forward to the next day, praying it brings something new, interesting. I find myself surrounded by the ones I love. Alex, Teddy, and Meagan. We are taking one brief respite before the coming battle. We have trained for this. We know we are ready. I just wish we had more time. I find myself staring far into the sunset. We can see the ruins of some ancient city, long forgotten by time and man. It was destroyed by the evil we now face. The sun glistens off of the top of the ruined towers in the center. You can still see where the children used to play. Where mothers would take their strollers, joggers passing on the left. Bikes on the right. Lovers, and the occasional, casual fisherman, would play in the lake. But their all gone now, swept aside in the violent malice of what we face.

The sun has set, and the moon, in all her glory hangs softly in the sky. The silver beams glisten across Alex's swords. It lights upon Meagan's face, the beams of light wrapping her face in it's gentle embrace, playing across the gloss on her lips, like so many angels of times long past.

The sun has risen and a new day has dawned. Our ancient enemies loom on the horizon. We rise and prepare to meet them. A battle awaits, and we might not live to see the next day. But if we should fail, at least we were able to do this together. And if today is the day we fall, then It was a good day to die.




Well, I saw Meagan yesterday. She was GORGEOUS. Ouch. Well. Figures. So much for things of the past. I still look forward to our coming battle. I hope I'm strong enough by then to stand by them, the people in my life. To weather the storm, beat down the tide, and face our enemies, with Valour, and Honor. And to defeat them. I pray that I have enough strength to beat them, that I might protect the ones I love, those who can not defend themselves.

By the way, congrat's Meagan. Hope it works out.

Well, nothing much left to say. I'm creating my own Myspace, but I'm gonna have to finish it at home, where all my files are. Oh well.

Bad Headache. Hate those. They suck. Well....i take it your much happier now. I can't help getting depressed. Things happen, disturbing things, and I feel powerless to do anything about it. I can't get angry, really, because it's a good thing.

Yes, I got pissed when I heard what had happened. I thought you might be pulling a fast one. But when I got more details, the angry went away, leaving only the negative.

This is going to be a whole hell of a lot harder than I ever thought it would be. Teddy, thanx for the advice....and sorry I haven't followed it up yet.....I might tommorrow (if I remember to bring the scrape of paper with the addresses). 

I didn't want what I said to come out as a 'pity me'. Everyone's right, I'll survive. I always have. I probably always will. No matter how frequently. This right here, is why I am not very mature. Yes, I'll admit it. I've some growing up to do. Some responsibility to accept and uphold. I really do need to take my head out of my ass.....it doesn't smell to nice in here/there/whatever. I suppose I could blame someone or something on my situation.....except the truth is is that I did it to myself.

There's nothing left to do, but to glue the pieces back together, strap the axester to my back, and move ahead. No stagnation. No chance to fester. It really, really, sucks that shit doesn't work out....God this sucks. I hope in passing, I've left some piece of me with each of you. And I'm hoping it's the best piece. 

I prepared to move out. I might have to accept that whatever is in the cards for me, destiny has decided that I play alone. If my bloodline ends here, so be it.....damn it, no pity. I just have to become better. A better person, a stronger person. Maybe there is a solution. Whatever's out there, I suppose I'm just going to have to create my own sanctuary. My own Angel Island. (not that i'm angelic, by any means)

I'm sorry for being such a downtrodden sort. I wish I had a better attitude. A better perspective. I'm going to try my best, do whatever it takes, to shift my perspective. Even if it costs me my own self, my own Identity.

I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired. 

Here's to being a grumpy old man, sitting on my porch with my JD, hollering at the top of my lungs at the young street punks, because I'm old, and I forgot my hearing aid. I was told once that I'll make a good old man. I hope so....Can't imagine becoming a bad old man.






Why have I given up? Why do I do it so easily? Maybe things will make sense in the morning. Right now, my head hurts, and I'm tired.

Farewell, for now."

"event","Figures. I could swear that this damn thing is Jinxed. It seems as though when I proclaim my love for someone on this thing, my next entry always is about how fucked up I feel because they just ended it in some way or other.

      Why can't anything ever work out? Why?! Why must I always go through this shit!? I hate this. Maybe Mr. Smith was right.(from the Matrix) He talked about how their first Matrix was a perfect place, a place where everyone could be happy. But they didn't accept it. They lost whole crops. The reason he said was 'Human beings very existence is defined by pain and suffering.' Hence the way the world is. Hemingway once wrote that all mankind lives lives of ""quiet desperation.""

      Guess what!? He's right. Nothing stops the pain. Not drugs, nor alcohol. Love nor pretending to be happy, when you know you're not. What's the point of all of this? I want to fucking die. I think I'll see if the Lord Marshall (from Chronicles of Riddick) Was right. Could one pain lessen another? If so then I'll hurt. Tonight I won't just feel the pain. I'll embrace it. I'll give myself enough pain so I can finally....but that won't work either, will it? Maybe if I pray hard enough, my heart will stop. But of course not, because that selfish prick cares about none other than himself. If my Bar tattoo (Bar means Bear) is correct, then I draw strength from others. Is that why I feel so fucking weak? No I don't want the fucking shift to stick you fucking computer. I fucking hate that handicap feature. If they can't hold the shift down with one finger and press a key, then they probably shouldn't use a fucking computer. Did you know suicide is illegal? It's the one crime on this planet for which you can be punished for attempting but can't if successful. Isn't that a fucking riot?

      What the fuck is up with that all powerful, self-righteous prick? Who fucked with him to turn him into a fucking sadist. And why me? I know I'm not just the only one he fucks with, so why does it feel like it? I swear he gets off seeing me hurt. It's what he's good at anyways. One more time, and I swear, I'll build a tower just high enough to reach heaven, just so I can gouge out his fucking eyes. I hate God.

    Here I am ranting like a fucking psycho. I thought I might be able to figure out some great fucking secret if I just wrote down my thoughts, and yet here I am. There probably is no secret to happiness. Because happy is a fucking myth. It's like a unicorn. Or Meagan R's ""Hot Cop."" Except I've seen the ""Hot Cop"". Maybe it existed centuries ago. I'm pretty fucking sure it's gone now though. I don't think I've met a single person who was ever happy. At least not long enough to ride it's waves out of life.

      Knowing how that Holy Prick works, I'll probably have a shit-load of girlfriends who I think might be the one, becoming just happy enough for me to reach a new low in the letdown. Until I die, old, hated, miserable, alone. I think it would have been better if I had never existed. No one would have been hurt, I wouldn't have minded it. If God was benevolent enough, just for a moment (yeah good luck on that one) to give me a choice, live my life, or don't exist, you know which one I'd choose. Unless your some weird freak who likes to read this shit backwards. It doesn't tell you anything though. You can try if you want. Done? Now repeat to yourself ""I am Sofa King Reta Dead."" Do it again three times fast. There, now what did you learn from reading backwards? Repeat the line you just repeated three times fast. Very good, Moron.

      Well, I think that gets rid of anyone who gave a shit about me, or themselves. Aren't I fucking great?! Deliver the Cyanide capsules to me at work. I won't need water, just the pills. Or syringe, whatever is easier to get. Fifteen seconds and no antidote? Give me one and make mine a double. I don't think I was ever meant to survive. God do I want to drink. Better yet, dear God, Deliver unto me a Desert Eagle .50 caliber hand rifle with one hollow point round. Mike, Party of one, Going down, down, down.

      Since I moved here, and started my job, I think I've Isolated myself completely from humanity. Which works out, since I don't want the ambulance, just a coroner. By the way, Mr. Forensic Scientist, Don't bother with the autopsy. I'm dead. And Mr. Ambulance driver, Don't bother with the Defibrillator. I'm probably happy this way. Catholicism is so wrong. God really would have to be a prick to make a suicide die horribly and be revived endlessly throughout eternity. Why bother with that shit? What could you learn from being made to suffer forever. When all that should be done is wipe you from existence. Just one....poof your soul, gone forever. Much better. It's not like anyone will visit you in hell. ""Yeah hi, this is Mike to see Hitler?"" ""Yeah, he's getting raped by Cerberus and used as Satan's fuck doll for eternity."" ""You have five minutes. Fucking Hitler's taken it's toll on poor little Cerberus.""

    Now what would be the point of that, when all God would have to do is go, poof, you don't exist anymore. Isn't that much easier, much simpler? Probably not as gratifying as torturing someone in completely unwholesome and almost unimaginable ways for all eternity....but much nicer. If God was a nice God, then that would be the way of it. But, it probably isn't since God's a mean sadistic prick, so, here's to getting sodomized by a huge three-headed, hell-hound, guardian of hell, and used as satan's inflatable sex toy for eternity.

       Maybe mankind was an accident? Maybe got was whacking off during the big bang and accidentally hit this planet, seeding it with life. Would we be the best of his seed, or the worst? If that were the case, then God's obviously some overly sadistic, bum father, who never pays us child support, and only pops his head in now and again to deliver us some pain. If there is a Messiah, He'll probably be show up as a hippie with a beeping, light up clown nose, and one of those ridiculous dresses with the ""This way to happy land"" neon signs pointing down. 

       Maybe we were actually created to be some form of amusement. Which would explain all the pain, misery and suffering, since God is an all-seeing, all powerful, malicious, sadistic prick. Why is it when shit goes wrong, we only think of how God is really fucked up, but whenever anything, in a golden moment, a day when (metaphorically speaking, course) we get a blue moon, planetary alignment, shooting stars, and comet all at the same time, goes right, we really aren't thinking of God. Which isn't exactly true. I was starting to think maybe he wasn't such a bad guy after all. But then he decides hear's that and goes, ""Hate me, fear me, you stupid bastard. You are my unwanted spawn, so return to the dust from which I accidentally raised you."" And with that He steps in and fucks it all up again. What is the point of living when all I want to do is die?

        And when they die, why do people still want to live? I think I might be because God, in his inexplicably irreverant and cruel humor, makes some people happy. So happy that they near ecstacy, and then, he just goes ""psyche"" and makes you die. He had no intention of allowing you to be happy, he just wanted to see the look on your life when you lost everything you held dear in the instance you got pinned in half by a drunken moron, driving a Dodge Ram on a dusty back-road. Knowing how he works, he'd keep me alive just until whoever gave a shit about me was just about to arrive, then finally let me die. Just to send me to hell with the dog and doll thing. I don't think I'll ever be happy. Or whole, or complete.

         Why can't I have a ""happy, sun-shining day"" without it turning into a fierce thunderstorm, complete with icy rain, insane humidity, and hail just large enough and moving with the just the right velocity and trajectory, to slowly castrate me as I freeze to death in It's Icy embrace. GOD DAMN FILTER KEYS, GO BACK TO HELL YOU FAMILY FORNICATING ASSHOLES! Bill Gates is probably God in disguise. Laughing at all of us because he has all the money he wants, and any woman he desires. Tonight is a night to bleed. If nothing else, If I can't cry tears of saline, I'll cry tears of blood. Don't know were to do it though. Not the face, or the wrists (to obvious). I need somewhere where such a cut won't show easily. Somewhere just for me. I'll have to ponder on this. I've got nothing to do, and nowhere to go but even farther down for me. Maybe A little alcohol tonight. Some 'Liquid Courage' for the coming abyss. Whatever it takes. I won't forget this either. Figured it out. Well, Teddy, If your reading this, no worries, because I will die in time, but that prick isn't getting my soul today. Not today. Probably not today. He might decide to make a house call this time. If that's the case, I'll shove his mystical stethoscope and bag of ""make you better"", stuff right up his ass, just before I Gouge out his eyes. Unless he'll make a deal of course. The book explaining the mysteries of the Universe, time to read it, leave it for someone I love and then disappear into the void of non-existence is definitly appealing."

"event","Well greetings,
 
     Well, I suppose it's been awhile, since neoatticus. For those of you just tuning in, I lost my password and was unable to recover the account. Oh well. Well, what can I say? I'm back! It's good to be here again. I was getting bored without outlets.
     What's happened in the meantime. Hmm.....Well I dated Heather for three days, then she wigged out and filed a stalking report. Crazy bitch. I found out that someone I had asked out many months ago just died of a heroin overdose. Wicked sad. I started dating Meagan. I had to break up with here because she's underage, she works with me, and the bosses didn't abide that. Go figure! Well, we're kinda, sorta, going out again (I think?) Except it is much more on the D & L. (for those of you who never went to high school that's the down and low)She is awesome. I love her 'more than I can possible describe at this particular time'- Jim from American Wedding. 
     Being with here is like having been hungry so long that you've forgotten your stomach, and out of no where, someone drops grade A, tender, juicy salisbury steak with a bowls so of broccoli soup, those little crackers, awesome appetizers and two pints each of Vanilla Pepsi, Mountain Dew, 7-up, Dr. Pepper, and Barqs. It's like having been lost in the desert so blood has turned to powder, when you suddenly find yourself in a beautiful oasis with crystal clear, strawberry flavored spring water as far as the eye can see. And so much more. Being in her presence is like walking down Huntington beach on a Midsummer's Eve, with the emerald green water lapping warmly over your feet. Phosphorescent sand crabs are lighting up the soft sandy beach at the waters edge, and the sun has become a beautiful mural of orange, ruby red, and sapphire. All the while dancing to the rythmic melody of a combination of wandering musicians and their guitars, and distant parties, all melding together to form something new, and at the same time, wonderful. You become rested, whole and at peace.
     It sucks not to be around her. Sometimes I wish I could just hold her, and wrap her in a warm embrace. To kiss her, oh so gently, and walk with her by my side.
     Also, Anna (Ick) is trying to hook the other Meagan (19 yo) with her brother, Bubba (obese, at ~ 40 something). I was going to go yell at Anna, but some sense was talked into me, so I'll just support Meagan and try to get her to talk to John. He'll stop this. And if it won't stop there, If it gets out of hand. If all else fails, she's my friend and I will not allow her to come to harm, or be harrassed. It will end, one way, or another. Grrr....

     Alex is fairly busy lately. Getting ahold of him is like trying to play russian roulette. Except with out the part about getting your head blow off if you lose."

"event","woah its been about 32 years since i last wrote in this jank. i ahve been gone for a while at the beach, getting all tan and shit, you know how it is. i went to nadias last night in which we talked all night about PUNCh. no not all night. we were talking at 1000 miles per hour, which can get crazy when ALL OF US (BRI NADIA AND MYSELF) are talking at one time. we stayed up pretty much all night. and talking about the extent of everything. and then i couldnt sleep at 7 so i took a shower all up in nadia's lame ass bathroom. and then half-slept in the ARTIC CIRLE FOR ABOUT AN HOUR. But for some reason the AC was on and the wind chill was about -33 degrees CELSIUS. celsus. what everr. anyways . my uncles at my house. which is not odd because he's about 33 and still comes over to do his laundry. and he fantasizes about kelly clarkson and his new ROAD BIKE>>. nothing really new is happening except for the fact that our wiffle ball team dominated yesterday. well not for real. just once. and boy oh boy, was it hot as hell. Yes it was hot as hell. 99 degrees. !!! oh shit.

""PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH""
""SAY OH QUILT""
""BRI CLAP NOW""
""HEY KIDS, how you doin?""

just some things i remember.. oh and the fact that i peed about 16 times last night because i drank five gallons of water. MORE OR LESS>"

"event","<p>let me tell you. this week has simply been probably one of the most aggrevating week of my life. so pretty much girls have such DISADVANTAGES! like fo real. WE GET PERIODS, guys dont have to worry about aunt flow coming into town. anyways so fuck you boys. so anyways, i totally make horrible decisions when its that time of the month i mean, just dumb shit. (OH MY EYES ARE BLURRRY FUCK I NEED GLASSES) like boys, lying uncontrollable boys that make me so mad. sorry boy if you are reading this. but on top of that my dog is has congested heart disease and a brain tumor and is having seizures regularly. so my house is so depressing. including everyone in it. so on friday my mom comes to school with some horrible fuckin news. we couldnt let our dog live with these seizures, her last while of her life would be full of hard moments and we didnt want that for her. we have to put daisy to sleep and at this point i'm just so fucking PISSED THE FUCK OFF. i just cried. i cried in school, that shit was bad. and people were like what is your problem and i just wanted to punch them in their little concerned faces. me and my sister leave school early from school and go to be with my sick dog. gosh it just kills me thinking about it. i have licved 15 god damn years with that dog. the first pet i have ever had. not one of my memories doesn;t have her in it. it just sucks so royally. so the rest is just too sad, if i talk about it i will cry for forever. 

to make me feel better after we buried my now peaceful dog, julia and nadia came over with munchies (FRICKIN HOT MUNCHIES!!! JALOPENOS CHIPS AND THOSE FLAMIN HOT CHEETOS WHICH KILLED MY MOUTH! &amp; made my stomach quite weezy). they brought me a cute picture of ......... cant tell you. we walked to walsingham to swing but we were too stuffed from the damn HOT THINGS that we just decided to wakl. and we smelt some pretty nasty smells. i have to go under a fence on the shortcut home and i got dirty. dirty girl. anyways we watched the paris hilton induced HOUSE OF WAX where hilton dies on her knees, where she belongs. NOT ONLY DOES SHE SUCK TERRIBLEY AT ACTING BUTTHE DAMN BITCH IS dumb. her boyfriend had huge lips that ate her face when they kissed. AH! and that brother was hot, on account of him being CHAD MICHAEL MURRAY. hottie. anyways. we decided to try to watch goosebumps. no good. SO ME AND JULIA FELL ASLEEP after nadia put in igbbyy bOY goES TO COLLEGE. (igby goes down). 

blahblahblah. we wake up at like 10. WHICH I HAVENT DONE FOR AT LEAST 3226 years. we played sudoku at breakfast and then hit the road to target n such where we PICKED UP TIEDYE, might i add that tiedye isnt cheap mannn. its like friggen expensible. we had to decide on weather we wanted ""cherry red"" or ""vagina pink"" we picked the first one. and the ""mystic blue"" it kind of turned out more of a PURP/ THEY SHOULD PUT IT ON THE BOX/PACKAGE. 

anyways so we died LOADS AND LOADS OF RANDOM SHIT!. like socks (which julia sucks at dying). anyways.. on and on. ON TO THE NEXT ACTIVITY. julia had to leave thank god! i threw away those socks. what a waste of good socks. fuck you. anyways. me and nadia watched IGBY GETS A JOB (igby goes down). how sweet. BUT THE ENDING, terrible. where does igby go? what does he do? does he get there? or does he stop on the way? what about the curly haired girl who liked igby but then ditched him for his brother who supposively is her same age! BULLSHIT MUTHER FUCKER! you just liked him because hes ryan phillipe. and who doenst want to have sexual relations with him!? I DO. actually i'd rather get it on with digby. 

ON SUNDAY (today) was the longest day of my life. i had to wake up to go to chapel and stay for all 3 services !! AH&gt; 7:30-12:15 (4hr and 45 minutes in church!) AHHH! then i went to cheese shop got some good shit. went to julias and walked to MOUNTS BAY POOL which was nice. even though all the boys didnt want to let us join their game of sharks and minos. what is up with guys and always not wanting to let girls join in. GREEDY AND SELFISH IF YOU ASK ME. anyways and we went down the slides with kelsey. 

target was next &amp; dollar tree. then we walked over to coldstone spermery. which i didnt eat. BRI SKYE BRITTANY SEAN BUSH AND GABBY were there. we demolished my gummy turtles and left. and i came home and i have been on the computer ever since. EXCITING LIFE I KNOW!.  b

but i have learned some things this week which doesnt make everything so horrible.


BUT I CANT TELL YOU!

(ps, julia i love you)
(pss. WE ARE GETTING GLASS THINGS FROM TJMAXX ON TUESDAY, me julz bri and nadia which wil be funn!!!)</p>"

"event","fuck, so all of a sudden everyone is just screwed over. this weekend was a bust even though i did have some really good japanese food, i make something really awesome out of an apple, and i went to college creek. it was all just a hooplah of pandamonium. quite a disappointment when the man didnt come this friday. i was so sad.&nbsp;<br />but nevertheless, i had <u>sno to go</u>. and that always makes me happy.<br /><br />plus another thing, i think <strong>people should stop getting up other people's asses</strong> about shit. just shit like drugs &amp; relationships and whatnot. i think, me personally speaking, that you should just let it go if it has nothing to do with you! each and every day this town upsets me more and more. just the damn people in it. the ones who think they're so fucking superior over others. fuck you.&nbsp;<br /><br />+ + + + + ++ohbye"

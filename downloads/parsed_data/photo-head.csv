I know i said on my other journal (new one : abadbreed) that I would be updating my photo journal, but honestly, I'm way too lazy to post individually a bunch of my pictures. so here's the link to my photobucket album. check all of those out if you wish, and then, once I start getting pictures taken in school, I'll post those and you can compare them to see which is better.

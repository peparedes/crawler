"event","boots is at this awards show thing today (i was supposed to go with him, but a friend of mine broke her foot and needs me to watch her kids) and i was on the phone with him while he was walking into his dressing room. sharon stones comes up to him and starts yammering about ""i LOVE your tv show! i tivo it and have never missed it once!"" and then she starts going into ""look at you! how often do you work out? you look great!"" and you know what boots says? ""i'm on the phone with my girlfriend, so i gotta go. but thanks!""

then later on, she goes up to him again (although i wasn't on the line to hear this one) and she asked him to come to a get together she was having later on tonight. and...he told her he already had plans.

"event","so, tonight i'm going out with boots. it's official - it's a date. if you couldn't tell from my previous posts, it's crazy going anywhere with him, anytime. so...can you imagine, a saturday night out at hollywood hot spots? tonight is going to be ri-fucking-diculous. he can get in anywhere, no waiting in line, no money exchanged - he's golden. i'm sure i'll have some crazy shit to post about tomorrow.

we're still playing little games because we're sort of unsure of what we're doing (even though nothing has happened) and how we feel about each other. i still think we're doomed and, for once, i actually (sort of) hope i'm right. he's wrong for me and if i don't get enough grief being his friend, imagine what it would be like if i were going out with him. i can't even comprehend.

in a nutshell, here are my fears:

1. if he ends up reconciling with his wife and not getting divoced and we do anything, he and i (and his wife) will be horrified.

2. he's an impulsive person and if he does something on impulse and regrets it, i'll be horrified.

3. he's a lot older than me. (which, to be quite honest, is nothing new to me, but it's still something to consider.)

4. he's high-profile. i'm going to have to deal with media speculation, gossip, pictures in tabloids, etc.

5. i'm impulsive. i could end up really fucking over this poor sap.

6. i don't want to be his rebound. he's been married for 17 fucking years and maybe he's making up for lost times and it has nothing to do with me. well, if he wants me, it'd better be because of ME, not because he's dying to be with someone else. it had better be because i'm cute, smart, have a good personality, whatever...but it had better be about <I>me</I>.

7. if he is making up for lost times and ends up going out and hooking up with every chick in hollywood, i might be devasted (or i might not care -- only time would tell). 


sorry my entries are so emo. i'm honestly a very funny, light-hearted person. i think what it is is that on here i write about things i don't talk about ever, so i allow myself to really think and feel via LJ what i'm embarrassed or am too guarded to feel in my real life...  so, bear with me...


by the way, feel free to tell me i'm being an idiot, paranoid, whatever..."

"event","i was supposed to hang out with boots but he's busy dying eggs with his kids. i really wanted to see him. i even had an outfit picked out. (you know i'm not the only one who does this; don't lie!)

i went to downtown with o today. we went to <a href=""http://www.olvera-street.com/html/olvera_street.html"">olvera street</a> because i wanted to eat real mexican food and drink alcohol in the middle of the day and also because i wanted to buy this adorable piggy bank for my mom (her birthday is later this month):
<img src=""http://i49.photobucket.com/albums/f287/amyrails/P1010038-1.jpg"">
6 bucks, y'all and it's ceramic and hand painted.

o ended up buying this ridiculous marienette of this scary mexican dude with a huge gun. she decided his home is hanging from the rear view mirror of her mini cooper.

then we went to the fashion district where all we ended up buying were color contacts. she got bright green and i got violet. i wanted to put them on, i'm sure they'd look hot with my red hair, but i'm fucking scared. i opened up the package and these suckers are huge! clearly i don't know jackshit about contact lenses. i'm afraid they're going to end up floating around in my brain and i'll have to go to the ER to get them out. (give me some tips?)

anyway, now i'm home and don't know what to do with myself for the rest of the day. it's 4:45pm and i'm drinking beer and feeling lonely..."

"event","tonight was semi-boring and it really shouldn't have been. i used to go out like 5 nights a week and stay out until at least 2am every time. nowadays, i go out once or twice a week and am usually home by 12 or 1. i just don't seem to have as much fun anymore. in a lot of ways, it's a good thing because it's not good to party your ass of that often (even though when i was partying my ass of on an almost nightly basis, i was still able to hold my job and graduate college and maintain the usual responsibilities) and i used to snort coke and get drunk regularly. i still get drunk sometimes, just not really out in public so much anymore. and in june it'll be a year since i used coke. so even though it's not good to be a party animal, it is good and very important to have fun.

it was me, t, c, and o. so, 4 chicks. we talked a lot of shit, mostly about guys and sex. we went to <a href=""http://losangeles.citysearch.com/profile/44685267/west_hollywood_ca/winston_s.html"">winston's</a>, <a href=""http://losangeles.citysearch.com/profile/41883674/west_hollywood_ca/bar_lubitsch.html"">bar lubitsch</a>, and <a href=""http://losangeles.citysearch.com/profile/11283003/west_hollywood_ca/bar_marmont.html"">bar marmont</a>. it was just all so boring to me. i felt bored of the conversations we were having, bored of being out, bored of the people that were out, just all together bored. and i feel like i've felt that the last several times going out with friends. so, what's wrong with me? maybe i'm growing up and this stuff doesn't appeal to me anymore? i'll be 25 in a few months and of course that's still young, supposedly, and a lot of people a hell of a lot older than me are still out there and appear to be having the time of their life. is the time of my life over? or is this just a phase i'm going through? 

lately my favorite thing to do is hang out with boots and that's been where i've been having my fun, but it's fucking with my head (see previous entries). o said she saw him yesterday afternoon at the movies with his wife and kid. and i saw boots yesterday evening and he was telling me about his day, but definitely didn't say he was at the movies with the wife he's divorcing. yeah, so he didn't want to tell me, i can't say i blame the guy and, really, it's none of my business anyway. so, why does that bother me? i'm not going to say anything to him about it, of course, but still. i got so pissed at o tonight because she was talking all this shit about boots...but she doesn't know him and has never met him. she's judging the dude strictly from how he comes off in the media. and i think it's totally okay to judge a celebrity like that to a certain extent, but in this case i fucking know the guy. so, judge his tv image as you will, but know that you don't <i>really</i> know him until you actually fucking know him. and i do. she didn't know i was pissed, but i was and probably if t and c weren't there watching her talking massive shit while i defended him, i probably would have completely gone off on her. she can get really belligerent when she's drunk. she turns into a know-it-all, which she kind of is anyway but it comes out a lot more when she's crocked. it was really annoying me. in fact, almost everything and everyone was annoying me tonight. t playfully slapped me on the ass, which is retarded but girl friends do that kind of shit all the time and usually it's funny for some reason, but tonight when she did it i wanted to kick her ass...again, she didn't know i was pissed. 

i don't know what it was. i'm just bored.

i'm boring myself writing this.

goodnight."

"event","had coffee with boots. i have a love/hate relationship with how amused i am with people recognizing him. everyone is soooo nice to him too; they always come up to him and say (or, you know, yell from car windows) the nicest things. it was hilarious today especially because we were standing out in front of the coffee place and, i shit you not, one of these drove by:
<img src=""http://www.starlinetours.com/images/SL/doubledecker34.jpg"" />
of course, these buses are full of tourists and they drive around seeing the sunset strip and famous peoples' houses and stuff like that. so, the passengers went fucking nuts. i also love/hate how i'm in the their videos and pictures. anyway it's all highly entertaining. 

and, no, it wasn't awkward hanging out with boots. he's so fun. he tells the best stories and is probably one of the funniest people alive. it surprises me what a complete and total gentleman he is; i guess that's something i'm not used to. i mean, most guys don't open doors and i usually don't give them the chance anyway (i open my own doors, damnit), but he goes the extra mile, pulling out chairs, going out of his way to pick me up instead of just telling me to meet him somewhere, and he constantly has my comfort in mind. he just really knows how to make a person feel like they're the center of the universe. and he was so busy today, he's always busy... he gets up at 4am, works out, has to be at the studio by 6am for his show, and then after that's wrapped, he's filming other stuff and going to meetings, and doing all kinds of important stuff throughout the rest of the day. anyway, he sounded sooo busy and we had talked about meeting for coffee this morning, but i didn't want to make him feel like he had to come hang out with me (even if he were waaaay too busy) just because he told me he would. so, i'd sent him a text saying ""it's okay if you're too busy"" and he just responded saying ""ok""...so i was like, what the fuck, so i texted ""does that mean you are too busy?"" and he said ""no. it means i don't appreciate being uninvited."" hahaha. it's funny, but he was serious. i just would never in a million years have expected someone like him to be more sensitive than like 99% of people i know. 

long story short, he's great. 

are you tired of hearing about him yet?"

"event","on thursday afternoon, i happened to come in contact with a mini-marc bolan. i wanted to take a picture of him, but he was only about 7 years old and, you know, it's probably wrong to take pictures of some random child. anyway, he goes to this jewish school on hollywood blvd. he had the same fair complexion, the soft flat curls that marc had when he was younger, dark brown hair and everything and also the same thick, defined eyebrows. not to mention, of course, he was jewish. so yeah, he looked like him, but, the thing that really set it off was the way he was dressed. he was wearing maroon velvet bell-bottom fitted pants, and, i kid you not, a flamboyant button up shirt that was lime green, maroon, pink, and white with a big ruffley thing right down the middle where the buttons were. he was also wearing one of those trendy flat, fat leather belts. his shoes were slightly platformed and they were lime green. it was a huge contrast to what the other kids were wearing (typical jeans and t-shirt, clothes from the gap, etc) and it was so effing cute.

i couldn't stop watching this boy. he fascinated me and completely broke my heart at the same time. this woman was standing next to me and i said ""look at him, his outfit and everything. so cute!"" and she nodded and said ""oh, him. yes, he's <i>fancy.</i>"" she knew the kid. 

i wish you could have seen him."

"event","boots just called me and goes ""can i ask you a question?"" and when someone asks you permission to ask you a question, you know it's something delicate/serious/awkward...you know? and i'm a smart ass and said ""you just did."" the real question though was ""do you and i seem friendly?"" i don't know what the fuck kind of question that is...i just said ""friendly??? yeah, of course. but i guess i don't entirely understand the question."" (i mean, do you?) and he said ""well, did you enjoy my company last night?"" and that question confused me more because i'd thought i'd made it clear that i did, but he said he knew i'd had a good time last night, but wasn't sure whether or not that had to do with him being there (and of course it did). he asked other questions that baffled me, like whether or not i see a future in our friendship, which sounds like a very cut and dry question, but if you read my entry i wrote last night, it's complicated and honestly i don't see a future with it, but i wasn't going to tell him that of course and also the fact that i don't see a future with it doesn't mean (at all) that i don't want one. i mean, at the very least i know he's the type to talk about shit, which catapults him far beyond 99% of people. unfortunately i think i probably gave some verbose diplomatic answer (because i didn't know what to say or how to explain), so i'm sure his question (whatever it means) remains unanswered.

"event","so this tonight, i went to the tv appearance with boots. god, i was so nervous for him before he went on, which is funny because he didn't give a shit. and he did an excellent job. he was funny, charismatic, and confident and the cast and crew of the show he was on treated me like royalty. he actually called my mom beforehand (a straight-laced, conservative, suburban mom who lives far outside the realm, regarding both distance and mentality, that is hollywood) to tell her what a lovely daughter she has and to let her know the details of the show that her daughter was attending. you know my mom was shocked as hell when she answered the phone and he's like ""hi, it's [insert celebrity name here]."" it was pretty adorable, really. 

it's funny though, hanging out with him, because people recognize him (he's very recognizable; see previous post.) and then they see me and think ""that's not his wife!!!"" some people actually look me up and down and then ask him ""hey, so...you're...not married anymore...i guess?"" to which he responds ""yes, i am. very happily. this is my good friend, ruby"" with such confidence you'd never know that he's been sleeping in a hotel every night and is most likely getting a divorce. let's not fail to mention i'm quite a bit younger than both he and his wife.

he's so amazing, he really is. and now i'm going to make it sound like i'm all in love with him or something and i'm not, but i do adore him. completely. and i absolutely adore the way he treats his fans. he's so sweet to them, always. and he always has time for questions, autographs, pictures, etc. you can't not admire that. the funny thing is, and this is just my vanity talking, i want him to want me...but that doesn't mean that i want him though. he sends me mixed signals, so i never freaking know what the fuck is up. like, he says things that seem to make it very, very clear that we're just friends... and then things happen, like, 20 minutes or so before he went on tv he grabs me and tells me that he's probably going to end up showing off for me on tv because that what he does to impress women and that if he does it, just let him know he's being an idiot. so, it's kind of that back and forth thing all the time...he'll say one thing and contradict it with another. so, fuck if i know.

he took me to dinner after the show and that proved to be highly entertaining and simultaneously delightful. we were sitting outside at this restaurant and the tables were all very, very close together; so close that you end up sitting uncomfortably close to people you don't know. and of course, the couple sitting uncomfortably close to us recognized him immediately and starting talking to him about his career within minutes of us sitting down. the female of the couple was really fuckin wasted...and really fuckin dumb. but it was awesome because it was so goddamn funny. she felt soooo cool that she happened to have the same phone as boots and was trying to get him to teach her how to use it. he didn't want to, but happened to mention that he doesn't even know how to set the alarm on it (implying that he's not capable of teaching her even if he'd wanted to). i grabbed the phone from his hand and told him i'd figure the alarm out. the drunk chick goes ""how would it make you feel if your lady knows more about your phone than you do? wouldn't you feel stupid???"" and he's so awesome, he goes ""it would make me feel proud of the superior company i keep."" (i did figure it out and also set the correct time in his car.) she kept leaning over periodically and saying stupid things to him, like, ""can i ask you something?"" and he'd say ""by all means"" and she said ""you should dye your hair the same color as her's"" [mine] to which i said ""is that a question or a statement?"" boots cracked up. she wanted to take pictures with him and everything, which he graciously agreed to and was very sweet about, while she continued to make an ass out of herself and embarrass her date. at one point she leaned over to him and said ""you know...we were just talking and she [about me] is so beautiful! and so pleasant! isn't she pleasant? she's just so pleasant!"" hahaha. you know of course boots is like ""yes. yes, i know."" they asked him a lot of questions about his career and all that stuff and she wanted us to come to her hotel room (she was some idiotic tourist). by the way, they'd finished eating before we even got there and continued ordering drinks the entire time we were there so that they could stay sitting next to boots. 

when we got out of there, i was like ""oh my god, i couldn't wait to get away from them because i wanted to talk about them sooo badly!!!"" boots and i were just cracking up about it all. we talked a lot about what a pathetic chick she was and quoted a lot of things she said, but ultimately we agreed that we were so glad that happened because it was so awesomely, unintentionally hilarious. boots and i have the same type of sense of humor and we just get along so well. it was a perfect night. it really was. i'm leaving out so many glorious details, but this post is too long as it is.

tomorrow i'm going with him to look at a condo...you know, since he's not exactly going to live with his wife anymore (and nor is he now). like i said, i adore him...but... i'm a smart cookie and i know this can't end well. especially since i have this issue where it pisses me off if a guy acts like he doesn't like me...and then, when he does act like it, i often find that i never wanted him in the first place. that rarely ends well because either i've gotten myself in too deep and the dude is pissed when he finds i'm not into it...or...i shock the fuck out of myself and find that i actually do have feelings for the guy while i just thought i was playing games and i end up hurt. 

i sent him a text message a minute ago saying ""again, thank you soooo much"" and he responded (and i quote) ""fag. if we go out again tomorrow, are you going to invite me in or come and watch an early movie?"" (early because he has to get up at 5am for the show he's doing...i mean, even tonight i was home by 10pm.) see!! mixed signals galore. what the fuck do i respond to that shit? i'm not going to fuck him. or even kiss him. but i do want him to want me. and i do want to hang out with him. and it's possible he doesn't want me anyway and is playing the same game i think i'm playing...or that he's bored...or just doesn't phrase things correctly...? i dont know, but i have the feeling this is all going to crash and burn unbelievably quick. i bet within two week's time we won't even be speaking anymore.

but anyway, tonight was amazing."

"event","today was fun. i went to the dentist (not the fun part) and then spent the rest of the day with boots, a very famous, or should i say infamous celebrity. i'm not going to say his real name, but it's totally not a secret we're friends and my real life friends know (and think it's weird), but the reason i'm not posting his name is that i'm the only one who knows that his marriage is falling apart. i helped him look for apartments, which he seemed surprisingly upbeat about. and actually the apartments are all within a mile from where i live, which is kind of funny considering how fucking big LA is. anyway, he's decided i'm his best friend (he's certainly not mine) and spills his guts to me about the kind of stuff that tabloids would go NUTS over. it's fine, i'm okay with secrets, but it's weird being the only person who knows this coveted info. he's a funny guy, talks a ridiculous amount, and gets recognized every 2.5 seconds, which never ceases to amuse me....we were stopped at a red light and he had his window rolled down (smoking, of course) and someone crossing the street yells out at him, people in the cars in front of us recognize him just looking at their rearview mirror, at starbucks people were walking up to him repeatedly, but most people just stare or take pictures without even asking. a lot of people said really stoooopid shit to him too, which i liked because then we could laugh at them when they walked away. but he was like ""you think this is funny??? come with me to hollywood and highland or citywalk [2 very touristy places] and it'll be mobs of people and flashing cameras everywhere. or, just for fun, we could go to a strip club and end up in the tabloids"" and, yes, he was serious. he wanted me to come with him to some tv appearances tomorrow afternoon, but i have to work. i only hung out with the dude for a few hours today, but it wore me out. he wanted to buy me dinner, but i was like ""dude, i gotta go home. call me tomorrow."" i hope he doesn't think i blew him off.  

i'm supposed to go see a friend's band play tonight, but i'm wondering if i have the energy/can find a friend to go with me...probably not.

oh, by the way, boots just called saying that one of the tv appearances is at night and could i go to that with him, to which i replied ""totally"" and he goes ""totally is so much better than just yes."" it's some NBC thing, i'm not sure what. i hope it's fun."

"event","so, lately i've been partying with my neighbors a lot...which is weird/cool because i've lived in this building for nearly 3 years now and really don't know any neighbors (aside from the dude i hooked up with that one night, who of course, has/had a girlfriend -- such is my life). anyway, they're really cool...mostly tv people, some writers, photographers, stylists, etc and mostly in their late 20s and 30s. 

so, tonight j on the 2nd floor had a little hooka party. i didn't drink at all because i got lit last night drinking with the same neighbors out on the stoop and have had a massive headache all day. i smoked the hooka though which was fun. anyway, the girl, e, who lives directly below me was telling me that she can hear my music (which i play really loud usually), but that she doesn't mind at all because i listen to really good stuff (no duh). it's a weird building because you can't really hear the neighbors around you that much, but apparently you can hear the people above you really well (which i wouldn't know about since i'm on the top floor). so, then e says, ""are you the one who plays t. rex songs on the guitar?"" and i said no because i was embarrassed...but then she goes ""oh, well, she's really good. can you hear her too? she sounds just like jewel, but she sings t. rex!"" and then of course i wanted be like ""oh, then yes it is me"" but i was still sort of embarrassed because i really didn't think anyone could hear me. then my gay neighbor f suddenly goes ""you're soooo pretty."" and, god, that's not something i hear often. all of the sudden the other neighbors are discussing this in detail. e decides she wants to dress me up in a corsett and k wants to dress me up all pin up, while f can't stop talking about my ""classic figure"" (which to me just means ""not skinny""). anyway, funny. but very flattering, especially since these aren't bullshit people, they're very, very real.

j wants to take me to dinner though and i think he's freaking awesome, but i wouldn't be interested in dating him (which totally might not be his intention anyway), so situtations like that can be weird...especially since he's my neighbor. 

i still have my headache, but it was a fun night.

"event","sometimes i really miss using cocaine. it's been about 9 months since i last used it. i haven't relapsed or anything...well, not really (there was one incident where i gummed a trace amount, but it didn't do anything). i was never addicted anyway. but i mean, it's one of those things that either you quit or your use escalates...there's no ""just doing it occasionally,"" even though it seems a lot of people think that and i used to be one of them. 

anyway, i'm glad i don't do it anymore...mostly. usually i don't crave it, but today it's been crossing my mind here and there. i used to have so much fun with it. when i was on it, i felt like the coolest person on earth. and i really don't think that i was just a drugged idiot who lost all perception...i really do think it really magnified my personality, which i probably didn't need because i have an eccentric personality and i'm very talkative and friendly but i'm just as insecure and self-conscious as the next person. cocaine gave me confidence. cocaine made me happy (while i was high). cocaine helped me let loose, pepped me up, etc. a lot of what i miss about it was the ""wooo! time to party!"" energy boosts it gave me. god knows alcohol doesn't do the same - on the contrary, it just makes me want to go to sleep. pot too. i'd been hoping i could find some kind of upper to replace that feeling, but i've been long since convinced i'll never have that again -- which is okay and i've accepted that i probably just have to let that go. 

i think too i got a cheap thrill out of being a little deviant and living a sort of double life...but i guess these things really haven't changed. i'm still a little deviant and lead somewhat of a double life, i just do it without coke. 

but i mean, i'm thankful for that hell-on-earth come down when, in my drugged haze, i promised god that i'd never do it again if he just got me through it. even though i was fuuuuucked up when i made that promise, it didn't matter, i meant it. and i still mean it now. i don't take promises to god lightly. i never have. and i don't even hold a resentment against the guy who got me started. we're all responsible and accountable for our own actions, no matter who might have helped them along. it was actually the first drug i ever tried. no pot, no nothing...just straight to blow. me and him used to have these crazy nights on it...which, at first, was sort of surreal because this guy was in a movie i was obsessed with when i was a teenager and i knew all the words to one of his songs and fantasized about singing a duet with him when i was like 14. i'm actually still good friends with him; we dated for about a year (NOT monogamously or seriously). supposedly he's off it now too...

but anyway, damn i miss that stuff."

the doors got a star on the hollywood walk of fame on feb 28 and i was invited to the after party (and also the ceremony, but that's open to the public anyway). jim morrison's cousin was there. i think his name was freddy...? he couldn't have been older than like 35, so there's no way he actually knew jim, but he did look like him in a weird way. honestly, he looked like a cross between mr. mojo risin' and bullwinkle (of rocky and bullwinkle). i wish i had a picture. he was a funny guy, very cool. robby and ray were awesome too...very personable and sweet. john desmore wasn't there. he had to be in court or something.

anyway, it was a cool day."

"event","It's an easy function. Right-click on the song, go to the menu and ""Delete From Playlist."" Why won't I do it?

1. ""Clap For The Wolfman"" -- The Guess Who. Unsure whether this occurred before or after the traumatic formation of the Bachman-Turner Overdrive splinter group. I think it's about Wolfman Jack, who does annoying voice-overs through the entire song.

2. ""Dreamtime"" -- Daryl Hall. I'm racking my brain to come up with a rationale for this one, and I think it has something to do with the video involving a hot chick running through a topiary maze. Because the song itself is overwrought, corny, overproduced, and possesses none of the magical warmth that John Oates brought to the equation.

3. ""One Night Stand"" -- The Partridge Family. The PF are always good for a laugh due to the lyrics and instrumental solos (featuring the ever-present harpsichord). The song includes lyrics such as ""chocolate bar / there you are"" and an interesting bridge where David Cassidy passionately sings about wishing that he could be two people so that he'd never be alone. A PF runner up would, of course, be ""I Woke Up In Love This Morning"" for the line ""this is you / this pillow that i'm huggin' and i'm kissin'""...

4. ""I Fought The Law"" -- The Clash. A pretty boring, tepid remake of a classic song I already have on the jukebox. What's the point? (see also: Stray Cats, Dead Kennedies, and probably 28374512983 other bands.)

5. ""Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da"" -- The Beatles. It's a little blasphemous to say anything bad about the Beatles, but man, this song blows. Supposedly every Beatle hated this song except Paul and actually this song was on a list recently compiled by the BBC titled ""Worst Songs Ever."" Anyway, it just makes me think of My So Called Life.

6. ""Celebrate Summer"" -- T. Rex. Marc Bolan's 1977 shout-out to feel-good anthems of the 60s against a rising tide of punk rock. I LOVE Marc Bolan...but this song, man...it's not good. Includes the classic line ""Summer's not a bummer / it's a stunner / and it's now"" repeated several times, as well as the lines ""Hey little chick / where'd you learn that trick / hey don't be low / you've got rock and roll / hey little punk / forget all that junk."" The phrase ""Summer is heaven in 77!"" is shouted periodically throughout.

7. ""Sing"" -- The Carpenters. I won't even bother explaining the rationale for having this on my digital jukebox, nor attempt to reveal its multi-layered awfulness.

8. ""Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting"" -- The Who. Unlike #4, a shitty remake of a shitty original. I think I inadvertently left it on from copying the entire Who boxed set, which included this as a bonus track. If by bonus they mean punishment.

9. ""Wild Thing"" -- The Troggs. I can't explain. I think it's crap.

10. ""Afternoon Delight"" -- Starland Vocal Band. Even the name of the band is bad. Sometimes I turn this one up really loud just to punish myself (and my neighbors).

11. Wig Wam Bam -- The Sweet. Probably the worst song ever written. Ah, the guilty pleasure of trashy glam. The song reminds me of Cillian Murphy in a squaw costume, but that's not a bad thing, really.

12. ""Me and You and A Dog Named Boo (dance remix)"" -- Lobo. Dead people can write better songs than this. This song provokes so many ""what the hell?""s it's not even funny. Like, why someone decided to make a dance remix is beyond me. I just realized that I can't dance to this at all.

last night we both realized we were both completely bluffing. all talk, no action. and perhaps no real intention of action. it's all really funny because there are absolutely no hard feelings and, in fact, i like him better (in a non-threatening way) knowing that he won't cheat...

i have to call him at 2pm my time (los angeles) because that's 10pm his time (london) and that's the time of the scheduled interview. i hope that's right. i've never been good with numbers. 

wish me luck!

update: it went okay. i got drunk and stoned first.

"event","Maybe it's pathetic, but I sometimes cry over musicians who died long before I was born.

Jim Morrison breaks my weak little heart. I love the sound of his soft, genuine speaking voice and the innocence it seemed to possess, his soulful eyes, his deep soul, his trusting heart. It hurts me thinking about how sad the world must have felt when the news broke of his death. If he were still around, I know we'd really get along. It hurts me that that can never happen. 

A certain nameless glam rock singer, on the other hand, might hate me...but, well, maybe that's because I screwed around with his son and didn't necessarily have the best intentions. It's so fucking shallow, but I guess I just felt like he was the next best thing to his dad. Speaking of spirits (my previous entry), I often wonder if, in fact, people in heaven are watching us down here. Most of the time, I really hope they're not. Can you imagine? I don't want them (or most of them anyway) watching me masterbate! Seriously. So, I can't help but feel like this certain glam rocker looks down on me with hatred. Hatred for wanting his son because I want him. (How come, more often than not, my adoration manifests itself via sexual desires?) Aren't I selfish to think he even gives a rat's ass about me! I just love his music so much. So much I can hardly even talk about it. It hurts my heart thinking about what great shit we may be missing out on because he died too soon. 

More so than sad, I'm grateful that we get to share this planet (although not necessarily simulateously) with such talented people, whose music we can all enjoy.

RIP, boys."

"event","Okay, so I fucking love the Doors. More than most people can understand. (In fact, I love music more than most people can understand.) When I was 19, I visited Jim's grave in Paris. Here, I took this:

<img src=""http://i49.photobucket.com/albums/f287/amyrails/Picture063.jpg"">

God, I love that man. I've never been good with poetry, but I've always been good with words. Let me tell you, that boy knew his shit. His lyrics...his poetry...so beautiful.

I recently met a random guy who currently lives in the apartment where Jim's girl, Pamela Courson, died (heroin overdose). He says the lights flicker and he constantly senses her spirit, as well as Jim's. He wants to smoke a lot of pot and then fuck like wild animals, while he channels Jim and I channel Pam. Crazy, right?

Here's the thing...I don't like the whole ""channeling"" thing, or seances, ouija boards or any of that stuff. It's not because I don't believe in it, necessarily, but it's more so because I'm scared. I feel like if that stuff is real, you just shouldn't mess with it. I've told friends about this guy who lives in Pam's apartment and we all laughed about what an idiot that guy is. The truth of the matter, is that I kinda want to do it. Is that bad? I mean, who wouldn't want to fuck Jim Morrison, right? 

Last night I had a dream that I was seeing the Doors in concert. They were so into their music, just like they always were. There was no one in the audience but me. I slowly approached the stage...but as soon as I got close to Jim Morrison, I freaked out. It felt so real. It was like I was really seeing him right before my eyes, in his prime. The second I approached him, I woke up very suddenly. I've never been one to analyze dreams (I suppose I have the same views as that as I do on the whole spirits thing), but I can't help but wonder what that means."

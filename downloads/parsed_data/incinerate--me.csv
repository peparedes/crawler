"event","WOW. Melody's still alive, guys. 

I talked to Steph and Ryan last night and Steph told me she talked to Alex and basically, yeah. I keep picking the wrong guys to like. =\ It's bad that I saw it coming, isn't it? Sigh. 
I talked to Ryan after that and he told me that guys like Alex aren't worth it and maybe I should just focus on being friends with him and it'l make things easier. And he's right.

Yeah if you want the long story, just IM me. Too lazy to type it all out right now. 

Seeing the Early November today =]"

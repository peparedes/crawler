had been hurled down this unsure path,
and who knows where u will end up 
but i hope u guys will stay friends and
maybe more than that but i say
im sorry if u didnt make it together
i hope ur life will turn around so u
can see the sun before it sents down on u,
pray to god and ask him wut to do
and if its not what u wanted 
remember its good for u.....
im back frommy trip and im as tired as can be
im prayin that u and him will be better and youll see
that this path that ur on will brighten up
and lighten up..so dont worry..everything is in
Gods hands.

"event","Leo was being very cute today , he has this little stuffed bear which he has decided to cart around with him as he crawls/attempts to walk around the house. Dom tried to take it away from him and it led to a massive baby fight, which was some how so adorable. I never thought I'd enjoy having babies in the house. But having more brothers wasn't as bad as I thought. 

Ethan has decided he's going to teach the babies how to speak Greek. (Greek is his thing, he's a nerd). Poor confused babies.

My mother is out to drive me crazy. My mother is always out to drive me crazy. She decided we weren't getting into the catholic spirit of things, so now we have to have family rosary time. Can I roll my eyes now or what?

Sadly, it's cold and rainy here. I miss sunshine and warm weather. I miss being able to swim in the ocean, the ocean here is so cold it can kill you. V. sucky."

"event","An introduction: My name is Em, tho Loki's Coyote or Coyote will work just fine. I'm the oldest of four kids. We just moved from Florida to Washington State. Now we homeschool, but I used to go to public school. I miss my friends there, and I think I actually miss real school too. I like to watch tv, listen to music and read. I like my family minus my mom, and I wish we could go back to what we were like before my mom went crazy religious. I love my Grandma, I miss living four doors down from her. I have 3 aunts and 8 uncles, and 13 cousins. When I grow up I want to be a Ship's Captain either on the water, or in space. I'm also interested in trickster myths. I love both Loki and Coyote and I want to learn more about them. I think when I move out of the house for college I'll become a pagan, but right now I'm a Catholic-by-force. That's about it for me, come introduce yourselves if you'd like!"

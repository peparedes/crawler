"event","Unfortunately for you this is not Alix its her good friend and collegue Renee =O) Presently Alix is reading the 6th Harry Potter book that we are fighting over since this morning when she woke up i had already forged 224 pages ahead of her. I plan to finish it tomorrow morning before she even realizes it mwhahahahahaha!

So anyway the reason why i'm here updating her journal is because i just did the layout for her since she wanted me to and because i found her original layout to be boring. everything is done to her standards since she didn't understand all the variables and constants that come into play while making and modifying layouts here on Livejournal and any other journal for that matter....

well now that i've made myself to sound like a complete fool heres a picture of the geek thats writing to you:

"event","My Grandpy bought me a car today!!! Of course ill be paying for some of it and the insurance, but i am so siked! It's an 03' Chevy Cavalier! 33,000 miles, automatic, moonroof, air conditioner, CD player, and more! I got to test drive it and it was amazing! My mom is going to kill him when she finds out, we were only suppose to be lookingfor a car, not buying! The best part about my new car...ITS YELLOW!!! It had a few minor things it needed fixed, (Drivers side window, and remote trunk opener), but after those booboo's are better, the dealer man will drive it to my house where i can look at it and pamper it for 4 months until i get my license!

P.S. OMG!!! I forgot!!! They decided what the musical is going to be next year!!! (Well...sorta) It's gonna be either-

1. 42nd Street or
2. Beauty and the Beast

I dont know which one i want more!!! Either way i have to go out and buy both of the soundtracks to learn the music over the summer!!! FUN! FUN! FUN!

Here's the page with my car if you go quick you might be able to see it before they take it off the site!

"event","Wow i really want to die right now...i can't believe i let myself get screwed over like i did. I don't really know what happened, and i don't care to know. I cried all day today and now that im done i can see how stupid i have been. I was told in the beginning that it all meant nothing, but i still went along with it. I thought i could control my emotions, but apparently i can't. 

I can't compete with her...so i give up on everything.

And stop trying to talk to me about it, because im done.

"event","So i went to starburst last night...by myself, but i met up with some really cool people. Marybeth and her bf Kevin, Kat and her bf Nick, and Katie (and i am assuming from all the making out), her bf Tom. lol. So i guess that makes me like the 7th wheel. It def was no fun sitting by myself and watching all of them make out:(...but the fireworks were good. ""Sigh"". 

Now i would like to congratulate a whole bunch of people who have better lives than me...-

Katie and Tom- Congratulations on the relationship. You guys are so cute togeather and i am so happy for you both.

Kat and Nick- Despite all the drama you guys are really into each other and that is soo cool! I hope you guys last forever!

Marybeth and Kevin- You guys have only been going out for like 3 weeks, but thats great! Have you two kissed yet?

Jen and Robby- Wow how long has it been, like a year! Thats nuts! Stupid freshman!!!

Camille and Alex- You two have been going out for a while and i cant believe he has been able to keep it in his pants! lol. God knows if i was dating you Camille we would be all over eachother all the time!

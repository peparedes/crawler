Oh wow...I actually /finished/ it!! *__*  I can't believe I got to The End! It's amazing. I've never gotten to the end of something so big before! A whole book...wow...Now someone practical would tell me my next step is to go back and revise it all. Let me insert a careless, amused laugh here...

Hahahahaha!!

Now I'll move on to why I won't revise. The entire thing's trash. I was just having fun with it, not actually attempting at doing anything with it if I ever finished the stupid thing. This was purely for my own enjoyment and benefit - part therapy and mainly my own desire to see if I really could do it. I'm past the therapy part and now I know I /can/ do it so I can move on to a serious attempt at writing a book.

My next move will be horror again. I feel more at home, more in my element with that genre than with any other so far, despite absolutely adoring fantasy. What exactly I'll write about, however, is still up for debate."

Now my main predicate is an off-story question. Should I smite the FLOWER or shouldn't I. I'm totally not feeling the love here. I worked my butt off (and downed some nasty-ass whiskey as well) to get ahead in the word count and what do I get for my troubles? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Well, not the credit I deserve anyway. I should be in the lead with a little over 11k while the others are still in the 9k range. Does this show on the progress meter though? Nope.

So now I'm very not happy. I'm probably just PMSing (which I have no doubts on considering I really should be dying right about now), but this kind of double negligence on the FLOWER's part (it's happened before...but only with my count) hits me right in the gut. I feel personally insulted here and I <b>do not</b> like it.

Ya know, I think I will smite the FLOWER. If the ulmighty FLOWER is upset about the smite, then they'll know how I'm feeling.

I have half a mind not to help out with anything in GEM or even try to write for myself for GEM after I'm done with ToT."

Life is kind of busy right now and emotions are running high a little too often so my progress here is kinda poopy. However, I've hit a spot that I've been rarin' to do since I started this whole thing. It's really the reason I started this story. The only reason I didn't do it last night when I realized a good transition into (practically heaven-sent it was!) was because I had to do some personal life stuff first and that took me until bed time. At least I'll have plenty of time this afternoon. =D"

Today's word count was around 2500 I think. Not wonderful, but definitely not bad. And I'm happier with the progress I made in the story rather than the progress with the word count. I'm nearing the end after all. Things are moving faster. There has to be a build-up of tension...which there is actually. But I really need to move things along to either kill the next victim or make it back to the front of the house so I can deal with my main prey. Not sure who will die first - regular victim or main prey. =T  Probably the main prey I think. And the regular victim will see it, react, blah blah blah, die.

Sounds good to me! =D  My Muse looks content with it too and that's /really/ what matters."

Now for the question of ""Why.""
You have three choices.

- I was abducted by aliens and got an anal probe...but afterwards my memory was erased so I can't remember the details of what happened. However, I do remember the fact that they did an anal probe because they're memory erasure technology was faulty. I'm guessing their erasing technique is much like downloading something on Windows and halfway through, their computer froze so they didn't get the entire erasure done.

- My brain was kidnapped and held hostage for an exorbitant amount of money. I was never able to pay the kidnappers so they killed my brain. ;_;  Now I need to find the Wizard of Oz to ask him for a new one. But I don't know how to get there and I think there's a rumor going around that he's moved to a new world. In any case, his address is unlisted.

- My body miraculously changed form to house two neverending waterfalls. They effect was beautiful at first, and had a very sweet appearance, but it wreaked havoc on my body. The amount of water that went into the creation of these waterfalls left me horribly and irrevocably dehydrated so I was reduced to a twitching, dried husk of a human. Hydration is on hold as the water maintenance people are busy eating ice cream and staring at walls."

However, I was so tired and bogged from the day's work and the scene 3 thought process that I couldn't really do much with the actual writing in scene 2. =T

Then I went to a party around 8:30p and got home around 5:30a. I /really/ needed to relax and just have fun with people like that. Made a few new friends too! =D  That's the best part I think.  ^_^

Oush! The RPG-like story is starting soon!! *_____*  I'm so excited! The FLOWER has set it up in such an awesome way. Damn! Is she creative or what! XD  Can't wait for everything to start! *_________*"

"event","What a blast!! I didn't truly know Trin's role in the whole scheme of things but it suddenly hit me while I was writing tonight. It was like a surve of electricity went through me and the hair on my arms stood on end! I even got goosebumps!! *______*  I was just typing away, Marma was talking to Trina. I had to figure out what she was going to tell Trina to do and it just suddenly hit me like a professional baseball player swung a bat at my head!! Wooooow. It was totally awesome. Like a mental orgasm or something. *_________*  ::hugs herself and squirms around, reveling in the ultimate writing pleasure one gets when things just click into place::  I toooootally rock! XD

My characters are so stupid. One guy whom I meant to be good has turned traitor! And nobody knows it but me! @_@  I was writing up a more detailed version of the second scene and, toward the end, a fabu idea hit me that I should make this one guy a bad guy instead of a good guy. Nobody will figure out who it is until sometime later though. So now almost my entire synopsis has to be changed. =T  Totally sucks. But I like this idea more. Stupid guy though. How dare he take power from my hands and decide his own destiny! ::fake huffiness::"

So it's a low count. At least it's a count. I had only meant to write our a general synopsis and the first two scene summaries so I figure I did all right on my first day. I have a feeling progress will be slow for a bit. I'm not used to writing at all really and I have to completely rewrite stuff I've already written. Can't do it any other way though because I don't have the future stuff mapped out enough to do. Hell, I don't even have the present stuff mapped out enough to let me skip to the future stuff.

Whatever though. Going in order like this (even if it's slow) should keep me on track with my brain on everything that's happening."

"event","I bought a writer's journal today. I guess I don't really need it and it's not really going to help me write or anything but...yeah. I still wanted to buy it. So I did. Hopefully this'll help inspire me to write more often now. Doubt it but hopefully.

Anyway, I've decided to start over on Darkness Mine and try to follow <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/veilofgrace/"">veilofgrace</a>'s example. My goal is to start today. Simple goal, huh. I figure to start completely over and write out a synopsis and do a brief overview of the first couple scenes. I'm keeping with small goals because I'll hopefully be able to meet them instead of missing the mark and getting depressed over it. Let's see how this works out. =)"

ah well. I can't think of anything I want to seriously write and keep writing on. Except Darkness Mine...of which I'll probably have to start almost completely over. I should print that out and try for it. Maybe.

In other news, I made excellent progress on my videogame. ^__^;;"

I figure it's good that I did something at least, even if it's not a lot. =T  I was interrupted during the writing process and then lost the forward momentum. Not like I cried about it though. ^_~"

Now how often will I use it?

............... >__>

Yeah. Anyway...

I've created this to just doodle stuff in at first and keep a progress count of words...much like what veilofgrace is doing. But after the next project at FLOWE starts up, this'll be used mainly as a journal for Sora. After she gets introduced into the story that is. It'll be as if she's keeping a journal during the story. ^__^  Sounded like a fun idea to me. ^_~

Like my little kitsune (fox) at the bottom? I thought it was cute but I'm not so sure I'll keep it around. May change it later on just because it doesn't seem to have many expressions. But...maybe that'll work later on."

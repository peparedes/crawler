"event","wow, haven't updated in a very long time, and i don't really feel like writing everything that has happened since last update so ill just start from a couple days ago.

well we are on fall break. very happy about that. although no i am hearing that we aren't going to get out of school til june?!! very upset about that. but on mon. night i went to bri's house. we hung out with Halston, that was fun, i hadn't seen him in forever. then we watched saved, the movie with mandy moore, it was good...weird, but good. the next day, my mom picked us up and we went to some places. it was so weird, i saw my last year english teacher at target. and then today i saw my english teacher that i have this year at the store. how freaky is that? 

i think i might be going to wet n wild tomorrow. not sure though. i know my sister and my  mom are but bri can't go, and i called morg and she can't go so i don't kno how fun it would be if my sister has like 2 friends going and im all by myself. and i really don't want to miss practice, i don't think i would but my mom isn't giving me a definate answer of if we would be back in time or not.

so yea tomorrow is our last club practice before highschool. so sad. it should be fun though. but i have been playing like crap since i have been able to play cause of my knee. but my knee wasn't bothering me so thats not why i have been playing bad. idk why and its really making me mad. but actually today my knee started to hurt me really bad. i iced it tonight but when i am just walking around it is hurting. i hope it goes away. high school tryouts start on mon. very nervous. i better start playing better.

I can't wait til friday. HALLOWEEN HORROR NIGHTS!!! i am so excited!! i am going to get sooo scared. but i love being scared. its fun. especially when you have a big group. and my soccer team is going so thats a pretty big group. so thats what i am looking forward to this week. ok well there is lots more i could write about but i don't feel like it cause i am going to get ready for bed and read my book. yes thats right READ. yes on fall break, i got a new book at barnes n noble and i love it. sarah dessen is a great author. ok bye"

"event","Yes well today was excellent. In first period Bri gave me a note and it just made my day!! it was the best note ever. and then at lunch, i got to finish my lunch. usually i don't cause i get it like right before the bell rings, but today i got it with still like 15 minutes left. so that made me happy. and then after school i went to the doctors so they could read my MRI and the only bad part of my day was that i had wait in the doctors room for like 1 1/2 hours. but it was well worth it cause i found that my knee just has a really deep bone bruise. he said that i could play but it will probably be painful and that if it was too painful i would have to sit out. and he said that it would probably take  a long time for it to be totally better, and that it may never be totally better, butt then i made it to like the last 10 mintues of practice and i tried running and sprinting and every thing, and it didn't hurt at all. yep thats right....at all. well except for when i was i done it kinda ached but not bad. so i was happy about that. 

so now i just got home from practice and Bri had called me to see if i wanted to go the football game tonight, which i totally wish i could but i have soo  much freakin homework. and its not really like written homework, its just a bunch of studying. which normally i would blow off but the end of the 9 weeks is coming up so i need to crack down. 

and i think Patti is coming over later so this should be fun. i think we are gonna make pizzas or somethin. oh and tomorrow i get to go to GEORGIA....not really looking forward to the driving part cause 8 hours is really gonna suck. but i can't wait to get there. its gonna be soo much fun.  and i found out that the team is going to go to halloween horror nights together on th 15 so i can't wait for that either. omg sooo looking forward to it.  ok well that about it, my day was greeat and actually i didn't really realize that it was such a great day until i started to write down all of this stuff. so im glad i did. ok well byee"

"event","well this weekend was fun but boring. on sat our games got canceled cause of the hurricane and i was supposed to go up there anyways cause i had an orthodontis appt. but we didn't want to go cuase we didn't want to get stuck up there. So on sat my mom and i went and got pedicures and i got my hair high lited. i love it!!

We rented 2 movies. Mystic River and Devils pond. so sat night we watched Mystic river and then we borrowed 13 going on 30 from kt. Mystic river was sooo good. i thought it was supposed to be scary but it wasn't really. it was more suspenseful, but i would def. recommend that movie. and then we had to lighten up the mood, so we watched 13 going 30. that is such a cute movie. and the music in it is very good too. today i downloaded a bunch of songs from the movie and made a cd of them. i have listened to the whole cd like 4 times today. i love it. its full of older songs, but oldies are like my second favorite type of music, after country of course. 

today has been incredibly boring cause we had to stay inside. well ur supposed to but me, my mom and scott went to go see if scott's house had any damage and then we went to visit patti. i was scared we were gonna get pulled over cause we saw some cars that had been. its like a ghost town. but i don't think their is as much damage as there was with charley but i don't kno. we watched devils pond today too. it was an ok movie. 

oh and on friday kathryn(my cousin) called me, and she was on the bus on the way to a weekend trip at camp. i was supposed to go but then i didn't, obviously. so she called me and she was with matt who i met from alaska, and anna her friend that i have known for like ever. so yea i got to talk to all of them. i was so happy to talk to them. kathryn and i are planning to get together with matt when i go up there next weekend. i really hope we get together. i miss him so much.

and not much else is going on. no school tomorrow so very happy about that. i hope we don't have to make it up, or hopefully they don't take away wed. as short day. does anyone know what they're gonna do?"

"event","I had so much fun this past weekend. well except for a couple things but ill get to that in a little  bit. On friday i rode with katie, morgan, and rachael down to Boca. It was a fun car ride, but when we got down there we were starving and we searched for a place to eat for like 20 minutes, there was nowhere to eat, so we ended up just going back to the hotel and eating there. Then my food didn't come til like an hour later and i was the only one still eating so i took it back up to the room and starting eating it, but then i didn't want it anymore. so i wasted like 10 bucks on nothing. 

It was so much fun cause Fiona had her own room, so I stayed with her cause my mom didn't come down til Saturday. So that was fun. then we had to get up at 6:45 the next day cause we had an early game. We so should have tied the game, but the ref was stupid so we lost 2-1 which kinda sucked cause i hate that team so much. 

Then we killed a little bit of time after the game, then went to our 2nd game. We won 2-0. After that we went back to the hotel and me and Fi did laundry to wash our uniform. it was fi's first time EVER doing laundry! i was like WHAT?? but yea, doing laundry was very expensive. then we got dinner delivered from a pizza place. And Coach Kim brought CArly out. She is the cutest baby ever. I got to hold her and she is so adorable. 

Then we had the suprise 16 birthday party for Rachael. It was great fun. And Morgan plucked my eyebrows, they look really good. and everyone hung out. i love just hanging out with my team, everyone is so awesome!

the next day we didn't have a game til 3 so we slept in, and then at the game, i hurt my knee really badly. I heard it pop like 3 different times and hurt so i went out. and i hated sitting out, and it looks like i am going to be sitting out for atleast a couple more weeks cause i just got back from steves and they said that it doesn't look like anythin too too serious but its still 2-3 weeks which really sucks cause then i won't be playing in the norcross tournament(in georgia). i am so mad but i guess thats better than hearing that i need surgery.  So i was walking on crutches all day and it was so hard. the crutches are too tall for me and my armpits hurt really bad. 

well that was my weekend...soccer soccer and more soccer..I love it!"

"event","I haven't written in like 2 days. thats a first. I guess i have just been really busy will the usual stuff, school and soccer.Tuesday i had school then conditioning then practice. Wednesday i had school then soccer practice. Amelia is on our team now! thats exciting. So school still sux. i hate it so much. I got my progress report and i did good, 5 As and 1 B. I guess thats good, i thought i had an A in algebra 2 but oh well. 

I'm so glad we have today off, even though i am going to be spending like all of it doing homework. I have to finish reading all quiet on the western front by tomorrow and im only like half way through. My english teacher is so unfair. I have friends in her 1st period class and they are pre ap just like my class, but they don't have to finish there book til next week, and we have an essay due tomorrow but they have til next week to finsh that too!! ughhh that makes me mad. 

So i can't wait til this weekend. Im going to Plantation(i think) for 3 soccer games. so we are going down friday and staying in a hotel. Its so much fun staying with everyone in a hotel. and we are going to kick some butt! 

Last night i went out to dinner with my dad. we went to soccer locker i got some knew cleats. then we went to Roadhouse, it was so good. I came home and went to bed at 9, even though we didn't have school today. How lame is that? But i was tired. I am excited cause my mom left me and my sister money to go to panera for lunch. Ya i do get really excited over food. 

I haven't been feeling that great over the past couple of days. I had like a really bad headache on tues and then on wed i just felt like weird. and im sooo mad,i don't even know at what or for what reason.  I just feel like crying. Is that weird? ya i think so. The only place i can go and forget about everything is practice, so im so glad i play soccer. I love my team so much. They help me more than anyone else and they don't even know that. i don't know what i would without them. I have practice tonight at 4:30. can't wait!"

"event","Yesterday was good. I saw Cellular. omg that was a great movie, it was awesome. the guy in it is soo cute. Then i went to practice, it was fun but i totally sucked, idk what was wrong with me. Then we did fitness and i thought it was kinda hard no too bad, but afterward i didn't feel good at all, i was like all dizzy and i was shaking. maybe i was dehydrated, but i thought i drank a lot of water during the day.

After practice i went to Applebees and katie, quinn, jenn and amanda were there. It was much fun, even though i still wasn't feeling well. Then i had to come home and to a lot of history  homework, i didn't even finish all of it, i did one of the 3 paragraph essays at lunch. it sucked but oh well i got it done. but i got a 100 on the pop quiz! that was awesome thank you erin for telling me about it! if it weren't for u i wouldn't have gotten that grade. is that called cheating? lol idk. 

So after school i had conditioning. it wasn't hard at all. Coach kim was there with Carly (the cutest little baby ever!!) and it figures that the day i don't have practice i have like no homework, which is a good thing except for then on the days i do have practice, i have a ton. oh well i guess thats just my luck. i don't do very good with luck. 

Now i am starving and i probably have like nothing to eat in my house, but im gonna go look."

"event","Today i woke up at 8:30 to go to my sisters soccer game. It kinda sucked to have to wake up that early but i got to eat breakfast out which was a plus. We dropped my sister off then me and my dad went to burger king...mmm it was so good. i got out of the car and there was a cell phone on the ground in the parking lot, so my dad and i called a person on it and they told us just to leave it with burger king. then we saw this guy like looking in the trashcan and like franticing(is that a word?) so we thought it was probably his so we gave it back to him. ya great story i kno, it was so worth telling it. 

So we went to my sisters game and they played very well, they won one nothing. so after that we went to wendys and got some lunch. Then we went to beckys and i watched tv. I was watching this thing on Tim McGraw. omg i love him so much. He is like my favorite country singer now, since the concert and watching that. He is so hott too. Now he is, he didn't used to be, he used to be pretty ugly. 

So i watched tv for a long time then me leanna and victoria went to moes. gosh i think all i did today was eat. It was very good. i love there queso dip. My sister got a kids drink, and the straw on it is rubber. I love it. it is so fun to drink out of and just to chew on. Then we came back and went on the computer and watched tv. We just got finished watching ""the most outraging game show moments"" or something like that. It was the funniest thing ever. I was cracking up. Now we are watching whose line is it anyway. this show is so funny too.

i feel so weird. like im feeling really different things right now and i don't really know why, well i kinda do. but i feel happy, sad, pissed off, and angry. those last 2 probably mean about the same thing but thats how i feel. i think the happy is just what i show on the outside but thats not really how i feel. i don't know its weird."

I had  practice at 5 at sylvan. and we played 5v5 and we didn't have to do that many sprints. I thought we were going to have to do a lot. After practice, me, morgan, rachael, sammie, and jordyn all got together at the pool and ate pizza. Then morgan left and jordyn and i wanted to go to the big pool, but no one else did, but we went anyway. Jordyn and i had a bonding experience. I love her, she is so funny. we talked about a lot of people around the neighborhood and it was so funny. i was laughing like the whole tim.  i saw jason too, cause he was around the complex skateboarding. 

Now I am at katies with sammie, and rachael. We are watching the breakfast club, actually they are cause im doing this and they had already been watching it for awhile when i came in so i don't know exactly what is going on. katies going to make me a cd with all the songs i want on it. im excited.

Jason took us in his car to wendys which is only like 2 seconds up the road but we were so breaking a bunch of rules. It was great. I was kinda scared that someone was gonna find out but so far no one did. ::knock on wood:: Then Johnny came over and we just hung out at the clubhouse and at my house. Me bri and erin finished our history homework which took freakin forever! and erin has vibrating panties!! haha that was funny. Then bri and johnny got picked up and my dad picked me up for dinner and we took erin home. 

For dinner i went to Olive Garden. mmm soo good. I ate so many breadsticks. thats my favorite part. When i got home i should have done a bunch of homework, but i didn't so i didn't study for english or history and i probably did bad on english and i know i did bad on history...73% ughh that sux. 

Now im over at katies getting ready to go to practice. katie told me it was at 4 so i came over ar 3:30 and its not til 4:30. gosh katie! j/k i love u! But im so mad cause i just found out that the disney tournament was canceled again!! i was so looking forward to that. especially about playing Kumba. We better have a scrimmage this weekend. Im hoping we are even going to get to practice tonight cause it doesn't look too good outside. but we seriously need to practice. its been like a whole week! Goodness this weather sux. but i hope ivan comes. I would love it if we didn't have school for a couple days. we already have thurs off next week, but a couple more would be nice. Since we have so many days off, its really going to suck when we get back into the regular schedule, school for 5 days for a couple weeks in a row. Im not gonna be used to that."

First we went to mcdonalads, then we went to subway and then burger king. then we went to johnnys and hung out there for a little while, then we went back to bri's and watched Ghost ship. That was a scary movie. In the middle of the movie erin and lynsey came over.  Then we started to watch The ring and we ate pizza. and johnny kept falling asleep and we were going to put bri's dog on his head cause johnny was freaked out by him and we did and it wasn't as funny as we thought it was gonna be but oh well. during the movies we noticed that movies sometimes make no since. Like ghost ship their own little boat blew up, so they were on the ghost ship and they had all of their eguipment, like where did that come from? we decided we analyse movies too much.  after the movie we just hung out in bris room for awhile. it was soo much fun!

Now bri is over at my house and we were at the pool for like 20 minutes and now back at my house doing nothing. i had fun such a great day!!"

Seriously, why do we need history? i mean i can kinda understand why we need to know recent history, but the very beginning? when will we ever need it? actually i do find it kinda interesting but i still don't think we'll ever use it.

the electricity went off for like 1 second then it came back on. it was scary. right now nothing is going on outside at all. Im kinda disappointed. But i guess in a couple of ours it will be really bad. we'll see. 

I am such a pig. I almost ate the WHOLE bag of chips. and its a big bag not like a little one.

"event","ok. so this is the third time today i have written in this. i am so bored. its not even raining right now and i really want something exciting to happen so it will unbore me. unbore? i don't think thats a word but i can't think of the right word.

so today i have read a whole book. that might sound a little keeky but i don't care cause i like to read. It was a very good book. Gossip Girl books, great series. if you are ever looking for a good book to read those are good ones. and i could probably give you a pretty long list of other ones too. 

so i have been reading, then i watched part of a lifetime movie where a teacher hired 3 boyd to kill her husband. It was very freaky, well freaky for me. i get freaked out very easily. wow that was a lot of freakies. Anyways, then my mom me and my sister played one game of dominoes. i came in last. It was very boring. I have been on the computer a lot talking to people and looking at peoples websites and journals. Right now im eating baked cheddar and sour cream chips...mmm they are soo good, not when u think about the name though. sour cream?? do they really have sour cream in them? idk.

my mom and my sister have gone to bed. they are such party poopers. I wish my mom stayed up late, cause now i feel tired but i don't want to go to sleep. and there is no one online that i really want to talk to, so idk what im gonna do."

"event","Last night I went to the movies w/ erin, johnny, bri, kaily and shane, we went to see Wicker Park, but I only saw a little bit of it cause then we went on an adventure to kmart, burger king, steak n shake and target. It was an interesting night.

Then Bri came over and we made brownies, actually my sister and her friend did but we ate the batter. yummy. Then we, well we didn't really do anything just hung out, oh and we called jason to see if he was at his dads but he wasn't so that ruined our plans of hanging out with him last night. So thats pretty much all we did, we just talked. it was fun. 

At first i was afraid, i was petrified...of the hurricane, then i wasn't, now i am kinda scared again. ((haha-that was supposed to be like the song but whatever)) i hate it cause its going so slow so its going to take forever to get here. i just want it to be here. My mom bought so much junk food so i can't wait to eat all of it.
Ok well thats all."

"event","No school today and I still wake up at 8:00, I can never sleep late. Yesterday my practice was canceled so the team didn't get together to do something so I went over to Jason's. Bri, Erin, Kaily, and Johnny were there. It was fun. Jason's mom made fries from scratch, like right from the potato, it was so cool and they were very good too. I think last night we watched 4 movies and never finished one of them. Johnny me and kaily were about to fall asleep, then at the end i got hyper and was not tired at all. It was really weird. Then my mom came and we took Erin home and it was a fun night. 

Now im watchin the news and i don't know whats goin on, i guess frances is losing power but it might gain it back just before it hits us? idk,all i know is that im a little scared, i don't want to lose all my stuff, like irreplaceable stuff i don't care about the other things. Im going to get all my pictures and put them in a safe place.

Well thats pretty much all that is going on... i kno pretty boring but when something interesting does happen ill be sure to write it."

"event","Yay! i finally got myself a journal. I love reading other peoples journals so i decided to make my own, but my life is pretty boring so i doubt my entries are going to be much fun to read but i guess if your're bored it will give you something to do.

So yea this hurricane is scaring me. We haven't done like anything to prepare for it...my mom never believes the weather people until like the last minute so right now she is running errands trying to get stuff. I was mad cause we could have gone to Georgia to see all of my family, but my mom thinks it will ""be fun to watch"" so we are staying here...i don't think it will be that much fun to watch when the roof of our house is gone and the power goes out, although my mom said if the power goes out we are headed to Georgia...which i kinda want to do cause a lot of my family is going to the lake house which is soo much fun so i want to go. 

Tonight i have soccer practice. im excited cause i love practice. Im mad this stupid hurricane is coming cause our tournament at disney was cancelled. But anyways, last  night at practice me and ellen decided we were gonna do something after practice,like have a team bonding thing even though a lot of people probably won't go cause its such short notice, but we wanted to like go to a movie or somethin but i haven't talked to her yet so i don't know we if we are going to do that or not. It would be fun though."

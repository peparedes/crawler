It's definitely been different this year.

The workload is harder than we've ever been faced with. Right now, I'm having problems just keeping up with two college-level classes, I have no idea how the kids in four are doing it. AP English III has really been an uphill struggle for me, but yesterday I talked to the teacher and I really feel a lot better about it. I'm really trying to stick with those classes because if I keep at it, I'll graduate with six hours of college english, three hours of math, and six hours of history. Woohoo. Cosmetology, is more of a challenge than I thought it would be.. but I enjoy the challenge. 

I'm learning a lot about my friends.
Especially Chris.
Like, I don't think we've ever been..
Real best friends.
Well, we have but we haven't.
He's always been the kind of person that if I needed to talk to someone about something,
I knew I could talk to him and he wouldn't judge or go blab it to the world.
But here lately,
It's not that I can talk to him, it's that, there's no one else I'd rather talk to.
If that makes sense.

Love that kid.

So I'm deff gonna go get some much needed sleep.

"event","Tonight was the first night after all the first week drama, that I've really just had time to sit down, chill out, and think for a while. What I have come to realize, is that, in the past five to six weeks life really has changed a lot. I don't know if it is for the better or for the worst, all I know is that right now life is in a very volatile state. The slightest happening might change the course of life as I know it. I both relish and resent that fact for the control freak I am. 

In a period of a few weeks, I've made new friends. I've gone from having two parents home all the time, to being here with just me and David most of the time. I've been more attentive to school in this one week, than I ever was before. I've felt regret for things I've never felt regret for before. I've essentially quit marching band, something which has been the predominant feature of my life from August to November for the last two years. I've made life and death decisions. I've found myself falling even further for someone when I promised myself I would not. And all of that has culminated in me living a life right now, that has very little resemblance with the life I was living at this point last year. I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing, only that it is what it is. I really want to know what changes are to come now, but then, don't we all?

I think I'm going to go try to get some sleep, it is twelve forty-five.

"event","So earlier, I was talking to one of my friends and I was like ""Man, I'm so glad I don't have a class with so-and-so this year."" and she looked puzzled and asked me why I resented this person so much. As I tried to think about why, I couldn't. I think we started hating each other sometime near the beginning of freshman year; honestly, I don't remember why. So I came home and opened up Trillian and it has a feature called ""Contact History"" where every instant message you ever send to someone, gets saved in a Notepad file. I opened up the Notepad file for me and aforementioned person. I was looking for evidence of why I held them in such high contempt, and what I found instead, astonished me. There were times, when we talked for hours. And I mean, hours. About the oddest things. I realized, that person was never anything but nice to me as far as I can remember. Yet, I've hated them for the past two years. I've yet to apologize. I intend on doing so at some point.

It just astonishes me how hate grows so quickly. It starts as a little seedling and soon it takes over, and we don't even need to remember why it grows, we know only that it grows. I wonder, how many friends I've lost by holding people in contempt over dumb things.

"event","So I'm done with the first week of junior year. One down, thirty-nine to go. 

My workload, is going to chew me up and spit me out.
AP English, makes me study. I've NEVER studied. Ever.
AP US History.. makes me cry. xD I don't know the capital of Vermont, dammit! 
What was funny is, I knew all the capitals of the states of the people I talk to on ZI.
So it was like ""New Jersey"", and I was all ""I totally know this. Tok and Byd totally live not that far from Trenton.""
""Lansing? That's so in Michigan with Unz and GR.""
""California? Sacramento. Sheesh. How can you NOT know that? Blue lives in California!"" XD

And so on and so forth.

So thanks ZI, for being geographically nifty.

Starting on Tuesday, I have physics instead of prep for college algebra.
This makes me happy, much.
I hate math. O_&lt;

Sooo. Not a whole lot of a 'social life' this year, I fear. I can see it coming.

I mean, it's only the first week and I've spent more time studying than I ever spent studying for sophomore year.

Luckily, senior year will be like one giant blow off class. Except cosmetology, but that's a fun class anyways.

"event","So today was bad.
Don't feel like restating why.
It just, was bad.

Tonight with Chris was kinda fun.

But it's nights like this, when I really notice my daddy is gone.

When I want a parent to talk to, and my mom just can't be that parent.
I've always been closer to him. Always.
He's always been here for me to talk to, no matter what.
He's been gone for ten days now.

And up until tonight, it hasn't really hit me how much I miss him.

For the first time, it bothered me to set a table for three for dinner.
For the first time, it bothered me that there's two cars instead of our driveway instead of three.
For the first time, it bothered me that there's a chair in our living room that has no one to claim it.

And I guess it's just..
Tonight I realized that this is pretty much how it's going to be from now until the time I'm 'grown', whatever that means.

I miss when I was 12, when he was my hosptial buddy.
My best friend in the world.

And I guess..

I dunno. =(

I just want that back, is all.

I hope they happen again. I hope new things happen too though. I know that I'll get to meet some new people in cosmetology and with the sophomores coming up. Maybe new friends, new happenings. That'd be great too.

"event","The Door is a medium sized, teen based club in Fort Worth, Texas. It's target audience is rather slim, in a nutshell: Scene kids. Last night, Kirsten and I had the bright idea to go there to commemorate the start of our junior year of high school. <br /><br />This experience began as we drove up to north Fort Worth with Kirsten's mom and we weren't quite sure where it was at. We got in the general area, and then we started seeing cars pulling up and emo kids were getting out so we decided it was a safe bet to follow the four or five we had seen. We got out of the car, and as we rounded the corner to find The Door, there were about a hundred people already in line. And the first thing we both happened to notice, is that they all looked <b>exactly</b> the same. The girls all had a haircut with sideswept bangs, long and straight under layers, and a messed up short layered top. Most likely all done at Tony and Guy. &gt;.&lt;; They all had entirely too much eyeliner, and entirely not enough clothing on. They mostly all wore the EXACT same pair of checkered Converse shoes. The guys, all had the ""I used to have 20-20 vision, now I have 20-nothing because my eyes are covered by my emo bangs"" haircut. They all wore pants that were so ridiculously tight that it's not even feasible that it could be even remotely comfortable for a guy. And they all had some sort of obscure piercing.<br /><br />And it made me just wonder. When you go to most public places, you see diversity. You see all kinds of people so that when the occasional scene kid or prep or goth or whatever the hell you want to label people these days, you hardly notice. But when you see between four hundred and five hundred kids all conforming to the same exact standard of behavior, like clones. It makes you just gawk at what society has become.<br /><br />But on with my story.<br /><br />We waited almost an hour, and we finally got in at about eight thirty. The first band we saw was not good at all. It was hot and people were so standing so close you weren't sure if it was your sweat that was on you or theirs. We jumped up and down, we screamed, we skanked. X)<br /><br />Finally, we went outside for a while cause the heat was just awful. We walked to the Italian food place across the street and got some black forest cheesecake. That stuff.. &lt;33 Yeah. When we saw we had an hour and a half left we went back over to The Door, and to our surprise, the last band we saw, was actually really good. And of course, luck being what it was, about the time we were listening to a good band, Kirsten's dad texted us and said it was time to go. &gt;.&lt;; Sheesh.<br /><br />All in all,<br />A fun night.<br />I wouldn't have spent it with anyone but Kirsten.<br />I wish Chris could have gone. <br /><br />Pictures:<br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img212.imageshack.us/img212/1737/thedoor1kt8.jpg"" /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img253.imageshack.us/img253/1346/thedoor2ml4.jpg"" /><br /><img alt="""" style=""width: 499px; height: 662px;"" src=""http://img53.imageshack.us/img53/3302/kmadanddawnatdoorsd7.jpg"" /><br /><img alt="""" style=""width: 505px; height: 388px;"" src=""http://img410.imageshack.us/img410/6816/kmadandmeatthedoorwc1.jpg"" /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img253.imageshack.us/img253/7664/kmadatdoorzx8.jpg"" /><br /><br />=D<br />"

"event","So a quick Google Search reveals this bit of information<span class=""minusOne"">.<br /><br />""</span>A ventriculoperitoneal shunt is a surgery performed to relieve intracranial (inside the skull) pressure caused by hydrocephalus (water on the brain). The fluid is shunted from the ventricles of the brain into the abdominal cavity or in rare instances, intothe pleural space in the chest.""<br /><br />That sounds so.. medical, no?<br /><br />Well, my ventriculoperitoneal shunt was put in five years ago, as of October 1. The same day I found out I had a tumor. They told me that had I not had it put in when I had, I would have been dead within 24 hours from the increased cerebrospinal fluid in my brain. So it effectively saved my life. And since then, it's done nothing but cause me problems. Between October 1, 2002 and April 1, 2003 I had a total of seven brain surgeries. Five of those were either on this shunt, or the last shunt I had put in to drain the blood on the outside of my brain. So needless to say, I don't so much like it. <br /><br />Here lately, I have found myself unable to do the most mundane things. Me and my mom used to go run half a mile every night. I can't. By the time we get done, the muscles in my neck around my shunt are hurting so bad I have literally just thrown up from the pain. As most of you probably know, I had to quit marching band this year. I've tried. I've stood in my driveway and tried to stand at attention, just to try to work through it, and I wound up just laying on the pavement because I couldn't stand up. And I mean you can laugh and call me a pussy and all that, but you wouldn't understand unless you've ever hurt that bad.<br /><br />And it's frustrating as hell.<br /><br />I beat the brain tumor, no problem.<br />Twelve and a half hour brain surgery? <br />Psh.<br /><br />I am getting beaten by a piece of plastic an eighth of an inch in diameter.<br />And they can't figure out why.<br /><br />So I am very very very frustrated.<br />I'm sixteen years old, but I can't just BE sixteen.<br />I've always considered all the stuff with my brain to be past tense, and here lately it has been frighteningly put in the present.<br /><br />=/<br /><br />I guess God didn't bring me this far to have me quit now.<br /><br />Dawn Michelle"

"event","I don't even feel like writing it all down.
But between band.
My mom.
My friends.
My dad being gone for the next eight days.
School starting in two weeks.

And the fact that I'm sixteen,
but I can't really just be sixteen like everyone else..
The fact that because of nothing more than a mere piece of plastic,
I'm incapable of doing things that mean the world to me.

Cause honestly, I'd give anything to be on that marching field in November, playing my saxophone.
Anything.
But no. God just can't deal with that. He can't let me have that one piece of happiness.

I feel like I'm going to implode."

So, today I'm going to go talk to D about pit with Kirsten.
Tomorrow, we get our old uniforms back. &lt;33

"event","Too often do we as human beings dwell on the what might have been, the wanderings such as ""What if I had taken that job?"" or ""What if I had dated that person?"" or ""What if I had done this differently?"" and any number of similar ""What if"" scenarios which constantly plague our lives. What people fail to realize, quite frankly, is that the ""What if"", does not matter. As of this point, we've yet to discover time travel. We've yet to find a human being capable of erasing his own mistakes. And thus, the what if, is too far gone. It is futile to ponder upon it. What we need to learn to do, is rather than spend our time wondering about the ""what if"" of the past, is to focus on the future and wonder, ""what if"". Because, while we can't change the past, the future has yet to happen. So rather than wondering ""What if I had dated this person?"" ask yourself, ""What can I do to make the person that I am with happy today?"" Learn to make the best of life you do have rather than dreaming of a life you never will. 

The reason why I chose to write that little snippet, is because today, I found myself constantly wondering about what my life would be like, if I had not had cancer. I wondered if I would be the same person. If I would have the same friends. And then I came to a startling conclusion: It doesn't matter. The fact of life is, I DO have cancer.. I AM who I am.. and I DO have and LOVE the friends that I have. So it really doesn't matter if in some alternate universe I'd be some crazy goth girl or some stuck up prep. 

I think more of the world should come to the terms that they are who they are rather than questioning who they might have been."

"event","Today was the first day of summer band camp. It went, horribly. The heat index was like a hundred and four degrees. So to start out the day me and a couple of other people; Leanna, Sean, Mark, and Chris, went to go register. I got my schedule.

It's looking about like this:

A Days

1. AP US History
2. AP English III
3. Cosmetology
4. Cosmetology

B Days

1. Band III
2. Physics Pre-AP
3. Cosmetology
4. Cosmetology

I went and talked to the counselors, I don't have to take a math credit this year. That makes me muchos happy. ^_^ Cosmetology is going to be hard. x_x But I'm going to work at it, because there's a lot of good money in that business.

So after registration, we went back to camp and they had already gone outside. We had only been marching for about thirty minutes when my shunt, the tube that runs from my brain to my abdomen, started hurting like crazy. I thought maybe I was just dehyrdrated or it was the heat so I went and sat down. When I tried to get back up, it started hurting even worse. So I went and chilled, and finally Mr. Iyescas came and got me and I called my grandmother to come pick me up.

When I got home, my daddy called the neurosurgeon and let him know what was up, and basically here's what we got told.

My shunt, is necessary for my survival. Without it, my brain will get too much spinal fluid on it, and I will get hydrocephalus and die. So they can't take it out. I have one of two options. I can either learn to deal with immense amounts of pain, or I can quit band. One or the other.

Well, seeing as how I'm not exactly willing to just hurt for four months out of the year, the latter seems more possible than the former.

After talking to my dad about it, he agreed that I can't just go on doing what I've been doing and expecting things to be any different.

So, in the morning, I'm going to go talk to Mr. Salazar and then Mr. Danforth and see what my options are. I'm hoping maybe D will give me a chance at being in the pit or something.. because I love band. I do. It's my favorite thing in the world to do. I love it more than debate, more than school.. heck, it's probably what keeps me going in school. I really hope something can be worked out.

"event","So last week I got a new book, ""Jesus Freaks"" by DC Talk. The following is one of the many stories of martyrs in said book.<br /><b><br />""More Love to Thee""<br /><br />Pastor Kim and his congregation<br />North Korea<br />1950s<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For years, Pastor Kim and 27 of his flock of Korean saints had lived in hand-dug tunnels beneath the earth. Then, as the communists were building a road, they discovered the Christians living underground.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The officials brought them out before a crowd of 30,000 in the village of Gok San for a public trial and execution. They were told, ""Deny Christ, or you will die."" But they refused.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point the head Communist officer ordered four children from the group seized and had them prepared for hanging. With ropes tied around their small necks, the officer again commanded the parents to deny Christ.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not one of the believers would deny their faith. They told the children, ""We will see you soon in Heaven."" The children died quietly.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The officer then called for a steamroller to be brought in. He forced the Christians to lie on the ground in its path. As its engine revved, they were given one last chance to recant their faith in Jesus. Again they refused.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the steam roller began to inch forward, the Christians began to sing a song they had often sung together. As their bones and bodies were crushed under the pressure of the massive rollers, their lips uttered these words:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  ""More love to Thee, O Christ, more love to Thee<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  Thee alone I seek, more love to Thee<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  Let sorrow do its work, more love to Thee<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  Then shall my latest breath whisper Thy praise<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  This be the parting cry my heart shall raise;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  More love, O Christ, to Thee.""<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The execution was reported in the North Korean press as an act of suppressing superstition. </b><br /><br />Now, that's powerful. To believe in something so much, you'll die while still singing praises.. that is a truly powerful thing. But that is not the first thing that struck me about this story though.<br /><br />Tonight, I went to church with a good friend of mine, and while he is really well behaved, his youth group makes me wonder. While their Youth Pastor was talking, and at points, even while he was praying some of the girls of the group found it fit to talk, giggle, and some had the audacity to text message. And it just flabbergasted me. People <u><b>DIE</b></u> because they want to worship Christ. People willingly give their lives as a sacrifice for Him because they refuse to be silent. They refuse to denounce His name. Yet, in America, the country with supposedly more Christians than anywhere in the world, we see church as an obligation. We wake up on Sunday morning and groan because we have to get out of bed early on our weekend. In parts of the world, people would die for that freedom, yet we take it so freely for granted. We abuse it, by going to church and not worshiping Christ to the fullest. We degrade it, by holding it against Christ that we have to get up early.<br /><br />Just generally, this feeling of sadness overcame me. We live in supposedly the most Christian nation in the world, yet.. we have some of the least God driven people.<br /><br />The quote that came after that story was ""Many of us have never asked ourselves if we would die for Christ, because we haven't even been living for Him.""<br /><br />Something needs to change in this country.<br /><br />Dawn Michelle &lt;/3"

"event","So a lot of people tend to think of OCD as something that's comical or even nonexistent. Most stereotypically they think of a television show called Monk about a detective who uses his disorder to solve crimes in a funny way. I chose to write about sometimes the darker side of this disease in order to show people that perhaps it is not as much of a joking matter as they may think.

So yesterday, I woke up. The first thing I noticed was how incredibly dirty my mouth felt. Of course, we all get that funk in our teeth in the morning. I tried to go back to sleep for about five minutes, but I found all I could think about was how many germs are in your mouth at any given time. I thought about it so hard that I swear I could feel the germs multiplying in my mouth. This is the obsession. Finally, I gave up on any thoughts of going back to sleep and I got up to brush my teeth. The compulsion. But not only did I have to brush my teeth, but I had to floss them until I made my gums bleed, assuring that there were no germs between my teeth. Then, I brushed them for about ten minutes, leaving my mouth pretty much a bloody mess. And after all that, I used mouthwash. Which, the alcohol in makes cuts burn ten times worse than they already do. After feeling satisfied that my mouth was clean, I went and got on the computer. My mouth was still bleeding about thirty minutes later.

This is the average morning for me. 

It may seem silly, it may seem made up.. but it is the way I am forced to live. Often my parents tell me just to stop it, but they don't understand. I think many do not understand. I can't help it. If I think about, I have to go solve the problem otherwise I will sit and think about it until I am unable to think about anything else. I have to brush my teeth in the morning before breakfast, any time after I eat or drink something, even if it's only water, and before I go to bed I have to full out scour my mouth or I won't be able to go to sleep. If I wake up in the middle of the night, I have to get up and brush my teeth. It is something that impairs my ability to function at times, not a laughing matter on a television show.

My OCD started about two months ago, and already I have worn down the soft tissue in my gums to the point I risk gum disease and tooth loss. Many people don't know what OCD is or understand the seriousness of it, but I think if more did then perhaps there could be more help.

"event","This is going to sound completely crazy, but since when does Dawn not?

Basically, about a year ago, on 7/7/06, I met this kid online, Tyler. I talked to him for a while, then we maybe not so much talked for a long time. I thought he was cool and and that was great and all that razz, but I didn't think anything would come of it and that was that.

So then this summer, right before debate camp I started talking to him again. Since I knew I was going to be at debate camp, we swapped phone numbers. Honestly, at first I was afraid to do it because I was like ""Great, now some random internet kid is going to have my phone number. &gt;.&lt;;"" But debate camp, being as unpleasant as it was.. talking to him proved a nice escape. I'm not gonna lie, knowing I was going to get to talk to him at night was at times what got me through the days when my lab was being stupid and no one was working. I think that's when I started to like the kid, honestly. I told myself that I was just deprived of human contact, or something like that.. I tried to tell myself that I couldn't really like him because you can't like people you met on the internets, cause that is creepy, right?

However, on Monday, we were talking and he said the next day, he was going to go to Ridgemar Mall with his mama.. and I was like ""Ridgemar Mall! *gasp* That's not that far from me.."" so I practically begged Chris to help me get a ride out there, and being the amazing friend he is, he did. =) His grandma took us out there. And thus, I met this crazy kid. I was scared out of my mind, not even kidding. I really just wanted to sit there and stare at my shoes the whole time because I was so intimidated. He's too cute. &gt;.&lt; Even that being the case, it was a pretty fun day. =)

So, I unno. I really like the kid. I think he's funny and just awkward enough to be cute. At the same time I'm like ramming my head against the computer trying to tell myself that he lives pretty far away and it couldn't work and I just just go back to being like ""Lah, boys, who needs em?"" I'm not real sure which side is winning. We'll see, I guess. I do know this much, the other two guys I thought maybe I liked.. they pale in comparison to him. =)

"event","For the past two and a half months, I have been happily single. And I say that with the sincerest meaning. I enjoy being single, I really do. I like being able to not have to work my plans around anyone else. I like being able to like multiple people at once without worrying about hurting someone's feelings. No commitments, no getting hurt, and no clingy-ness. I know that sounds very much like a stereotypical guy mentality, but I really do think it works out better in high school just to have lighthearted fun rather than trying to complicate stuff by having a 'relationship' and being tied to a 'boyfriend'. Way I see it, I'm sixteen years old, I don't need to be tied down to anyone yet. 

Yet.. There's someone I like, to the mutual exclusivity of all others.

And it scares me. It scares the living daylights out of me. 

And tomorrow..

Well, we shall find out tomorrow..

but I think all of that fear, is going to come down to this.

"event","The other day I accidentally started some drama on a forum I go to, Zelda Infinite. I was more or less accused of being a conceited bitch who likes to flaunt my friendships. One would think, that this would offend me, right? But honestly, I busted out laughing. That to me, illustrates most completely why the Internet holds so much allure; you can be who you want to be and no one knows the difference. So today, I decided to write about the differences between the 'real' me and the persona I use when talking online just because I think who we are online is who we would be in real life if we had the courage to be.

So when I'm talking online, who am I? 

I am ArmCandy, an extremely sarcastic Texan who ""XD""'s too much and spell check's too little. I am outgoing. I am random. I am dare I say it, witty. I am not going to lie, I think I'm pretty. I think if people only saw me at my best, they'd think so too. It's really easy to be pretty with your hair done and your make up on and your plastered on smile. And I love it. I love being able to play that roll. I love being able to escape from being the ditzy Dawn that everyone knows me as. I love being able to talk to people with few reservations. To talk about anything and not fear being judged. 

In real life,

I am Dawn Michelle. I am not very eloquent with words and I tend to fill the void with my annoying giggling. I am shy except for around my friends. I am ditzy. I am not very self-confident and I think I look stupid being sixteen years old with braces. I think I am pretty at moments, but generally, I find myself repulsive. I tend to nitpick at the smallest details. I like this persona too, I have my moments where I'd rather let loose and be the ditz rather than be 'deep'.. but admittedly, I really don't like my personality all that much. I find it much too dull and run-of-the-mill. 

So you can definitely see the differences between the two. This is why to hear someone call me a conceited bitch amused me so much. I makes me realize just how little some of the people I talk to online know the real me. If I had to choose, I'd be a kind of mix of the two. I'd be the person that people like Chris, Kirsten, and Jake know. I talk to them both online and in real life and they tend to get a really strange combination of the two and I rather much like that. It's a happy medium.

So this was a rather random post, but I felt like writing it down.

"event","I hate starting a new diary because I'm never quite sure where to begin.<br /><br />I guess since my purpose in keeping a diary is so that I can look back and see how life has changed over time, I should start by explaining where I am at in life right now. It could take a few minutes. =) <br /><br />Well, three weeks ago, my dad lost his job. Which was a pretty devastating blow to my entire family. Immediately following that, I went to Mean Green Debate Camp at the University of North Texas, which turned out to be both a blessing and a curse. Last week, Kirsten's boyfriend from New Jersey flew to Texas and I spent most of the week with Kirsten, Chris, and Robin which was fun. This week, I've applied for jobs at pretty much every place imaginable and have yet to be called back. Rather disheartening. <br /><br />My family -- I'm not sure what to think of them. I love my dad and my brother more than any two people in the world. At the same time, I <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">really</span> dislike my mother. It's not just the petty teenage girl dislike, either. It's like, this woman has effectively tried to make my life as miserable as she possibly can in the last two years. I don't think I can ever get over the resentment I felt for her my freshman year. She left my brother, my dad, and I for a period of about three months and the first week she was gone we got not so much as a phone call to check and see if we were alive and well. Come to find out, the reason we didn't get a phone call is because her cell phone didn't work in <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Shreveport, Louisiana</span>. That's right. She went and gambled away all of her savings the first week she left her kids and was so busy pissing off money she couldn't pick up the phone and even call. Pathetic. If I'm ever that kind of a mother, I demand that someone just shoot me and do my kids a favor. My brother, I love him second only to my dad. As much as I feel a protective instinct towards him just because he's younger, he's probably protected me as much, if not more, than I've protected him. He's been there with me through life. Through my parents fights, through cancer, through everything. I don't think anyone has quite as big a heart as that kid, and I love him to death for it. My daddy, is my hero. Like, he couldn't be any more my hero if he had a big red ""S"" on his chest. When I was little, my mom would make me feel like crap for something that wasn't even my fault and she would yell at me and just make me get upset.. and my dad would come in and make her stop and make my world right. Then in sixth grade when I got diagnosed with my tumor, my dad quit his job the day after so he knew he could come stay with me in the hospital. Not my mom, my dad. He stayed with me for those six long, agonizing months. He slept on a hard hospital couch and held my hand through many an IV being put in my arm, and I don't think I could get any closer to any human being than I got with my dad in those six months. Then, afterwards, after my mom left.. he could have easily just moved and got away from her, but no. He stayed, as painful as it was for him, he stayed so that I could graduate from the school I have gone to since Kindergarten. For as crazy as he is, for as redneck as he is, I wouldn't trade him for anything in the world and I'm honored to be his 'little girl'. <br /><br />As for my friends, I'm not quite sure what to make of the lot of them right now.<br /><br />Sara Hernandez, who was my best friend for my freshman and sophomore years, I've talked to maybe twice this summer and I have not seen her at all. I get the feeling that the last year put a pretty big rift between the two of us. I'm honestly not sure if that is a good thing or a bad thing. I know there has definitely been times when she was a 'bad influence' on me but at the same time, she's one of the few that I can honestly say have been there for me through thick and thin. One of the last times I was majorly upset over a guy, I didn't call Brooke, I didn't call Kirsten, I called Sara because I knew she could make it better. I knew that even for all the crap that happened between us this year, she would listen and be my shoulder to cry on. So I'm not sure exactly what our friendship shall be in the next year. I'm not even sure what I want it to be.<br /><br />Kirsten Madsen, who I currently would call my 'best friend' insofar as girls go, is pretty awesome. We haven't had the moments that some of my other friends and I have had, but it's simply because we haven't known each other as long. I know there's no one I'd rather be lost in San Antonio with, no one more trustworthy, and no one that I'd rather be friends with right now. She's got a lot of the same personality as I and I think that even after high school we shall be great friends. =)<br /><br />Chris Rogers, has been, and always will be one of my best friends. We've known each other since second grade, but I'd say probably eighth grade maybe even freshman year is when we first started to actually be the friends that we are today. I used to like him, although that thought seems almost laughable now, not in its ridiculousness but in that dating him would be more or less like dating an older version of David. We're that close that I can honestly make the comparison of him to my brother. If there's a problem, he's always more than willing to listen and always got advice that might actually be in your best interest, which isn't always so much the case in my other friends. There's no one I'd rather jam with at band competitions and no one I'd rather stay up until three o' clock in the morning talking about the most random things in the world with. This is the kid that honestly right now I intend to be the godfather of my children. =D<br /><br />Jake Muncy, our friendship started way back when in Mrs. Montes' Spanish I class. It is the result of an extremely failed attempt at a romantic relationship, but I honestly wouldn't have it any other way. We haven't been as good of friends lately as we were perhaps my freshman year, but i still consider him to be a great friend in that he's always willing to talk, always willing to listen and just generally a good Christian guy that I can't see myself not being friends with.<br /><br />Matt Moyer, this one is kind of a shocker to be included in my list of friends seeing as how I've only known him for a little over a month. He's one of the few underclassmen that I can actually see myself as being sad to leave when I graduate. He's got a lot of spunk and I think he's a good kid.<br /><br />Justin Jerrach(?), this kid right here.. is probably the coolest human being alive. I can't spell his last name for nothing, but our now frequent excursions to Borders have made my summer considerably more fun. He's one of those kids that you can barely know but still have the most fun in your life with. Between jamming to ""Thnks fr th mmries"" and triangular marker pens and getting a damn giraffe, I can't imagine that I'll ever forget this kid.<br /><br />Brooke Beck, my only real 'diaper buddy'. I've known this girl for sixteen years, and I'm sixteen years old. We can literally say  we go way back. We were friends in elementary school, and then we didn't really talk in middle school, but now we're closer than ever entering into our Junior year of high school. She's done everything with me. Like, I can't remember a time in life when Brooke wasn't there. I love her to death, and it amazes me that she still puts up with me after all this time. <br /><br />Joy Han, is probably the nicest person you will ever meet in your life. I swear that the girl doesn't have a mean bone in her body and there's something so undeniably awesome about that that you can't help but love her. I hope junior year, I see her more than I did in the previous two.<br /><br />Meagan Reid, is another shocker to be put on this list.. I vaguely knew her my sophomore year as 'the freshmen who kicks ass at debate', going to debate camp, I realized that she is a sophomore who does happen to kick ass at debate, but she's also a pretty cool person. She's really outgoing and I love that she's not afraid of what anyone thinks of her. Yet another underclassmen that I might actually be sad to leave. <br /><br />Those guys, are pretty much my 'best friends'. Other shall be added as I meet them. :)<br /><br />As for my currently non-existent love life.. <br /><br />I like three people.<br /><br />One of them, likes me back, but he lives thirty miles away which is currently looking to be a problem.<br />One of them, has a girlfriend.<br />And one of them, could not feel an emotion farther from liking in relationship to me.<br /><br />=/ Go figure.<br /><br />I'm thinking I should just stay away from boys this year. It's not so much the drama and stuff that has previously made me want to swear off guys, it's just junior year is hard enough as it is between being a state year for band, AP Classes out the butt, and Kenny and I trying to qualify for state at debate without adding a guy into that mix. I say that, and then watch like the first three weeks of school I'll get an uber crush on someone. Bwhaha. I hope not, it seems like high school relationships just aren't my forte.<br /><br />So, basically that's my life at the moment.<br /><br />My expectations for junior year are pretty simple.<br /><br />+ Make high enough grades to be in the top 10% of my class.<br />+ Have hella' fun.<br />+ Qualify for State with Kenny.<br />+ Don't suck in band.<br />+ Make some new friends.<br />+ Fear nothing.<br /><br />Wow, that was a long first entry. But it does pretty much sum up what has been going on lately.<br /><br />Dawn Michelle"

You feel strangely comfortable when you sit on plastic-covered furniture 

You know all the words to ""That's Amore""

You are offended when the wedding you attend serves less than 9 courses despite the fact that you don't eat half of it.

You ask ""How much for cash?"" when buying but will accept 'gifts' in exchange for cash when selling.

You are not materialistic but insist a $500 wedding present is nothing.

You think have a concrete backyard is nice.

You think having swans in a big fountain in the front yard next to the veggie patch is tasteful.

You actually believe everyone eats those sugared almonds in the bonboniere at your wedding.

You always have a friend who 'owes you a favor'.

You're proud to be Italian - and you pass these jokes on to all your Italian friends!"

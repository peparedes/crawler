It was embarrassing cuz I went to Albertson's with FrenchFry6, and on the way back to her house there were these skateboarders&nbsp; that passed us. As they passed they said something along the lines of ""lookin good"". Well, that wouldv'e made my day right there but then it was the fun part. We went to Petra's house ate the bread (of course)&nbsp;and went online and stuff... which was ok. Then we played basketball which was better. Then we played this one dinosaur game and Taboo. Even though I lost horribly in both games IT WAS HILARIOUS!! heh heh so much fun! yeah we go online again and my dad comes and he's all like talking to her parents so we start playing the hand games and stuff. Ya know ""miss mary had a steam boat..."" thing which was way old school and stuff. heh ehh. The furthest we got was to the ""...and the steamboat had a bell *ding ding*..."" heh heh. </FONT><FONT color=#ff0000>My day was&nbsp;also&nbsp;really sad&nbsp;cuz even though I had loads of fun&nbsp;I'm still thinking&nbsp;about&nbsp;what happened to Matt Thrasher the other day.&nbsp;How can you have three different, almost opposite feelings?</FONT></FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ff0000 size=4>Matt died in a freak boating accident. He was tubing, fell off, then got hit by the boat when it came to pick him up. He&nbsp;was in my&nbsp;Science and French classes in 8th&nbsp;grade.&nbsp;I didn't talk to him&nbsp;much cuz i didn't&nbsp;know him that well,&nbsp;but&nbsp;I&nbsp;signed his&nbsp;yearbook and&nbsp;I, his.&nbsp;Even though we weren't close, I still feel the impact of his death. I feel sorry that I never got&nbsp;to know him. It makes me want to be friends with everyone, because you never know when they'll be gone. He probably been in some of my classes this year but I had to move. If I knew him any better I probably wouldn't been able to handle it. Like a month ago my youth group leaders husband died, which hit me pretty hard because I knew him quite well. Then on Thursday we had to put my Cactapuss (a cat that I've had for several years) to sleep. Now this. I guess the lesson is appreciate life, not just yours, while its there because you dont know when it will disappear.<BR>&nbsp;Until next time, with love,</FONT></STRONG></P>

Up until a few days ago I was dumb and couldn't figure out how to open my comments. I have since then figured that out. I failed to see 2 particular comments on my pencil sharpening journal entry. One of which does not have to do with anything (LOL frenchfry 6 :)) but the second sent by a certain Miko Momo(not frenchfry6)does indeed. I'm annoyed at her and if she would like to know why please ask me (later plz, i do not want to get in a fight) I'm not going to publicly humiliate her. She knows I can. I really do not care for the way she treats me as her friend. I prefer to not make a big deal out of it because it is immature and i dont believe i should stoop to that level. I forgive you for what you said but I would still prefer if you do not talk to me because i might say something that should not be said.

"event","I once asked a very close friend of mine what something is that everyone in the whole-wide world cares about. The answer: lemon scent simple green all-purpose cleaner. For the people that have not had the privilage to encounter this water-like substance it is a yellow liquid that although claims to smell like fresh-picked lemons indeed smells like windex. It cleans like windex. It may very well be the exact chemical compound as windex minus the blue coloring, and in its place yellow coloring added. What is in a name? A cleaner by any other name would clean as well. Although, it would probably look different. So let me ask you this one question which do you prefer, blue or yellow? A cleaner that claims to have a scent of fresh lemons but lies or one that doesn't? Personally I prefer blue and honest salesmen to false ones. Therefore my dear friend of mine is wrong. Windex is clearly superior to lemon scent simple green all-purpose cleaner except for the undeniable fact that ""simple green"" has a better name. Windex is superior in the ways of quality, but in price? My answer to that is you cannot put a price on honesty. Another thing, the cleaners name is ""simple green"". Why is it yellow? if anything it should be green. If not that it should be blue because blue is much better than yellow. However, green is the best choice because the product would coincide with the name, ""simple green"", if the name changed to ""simple blue"" or ""simple green"" that would make sense. Who wants a blue cleaner named ""simple green"" it is clearly unethical. So kids the moral is of the story is no matter how well your lemon scent simple green all-purpose cleaner cleans NEVER lie to your customers and just the leave the lemon scent out of it, and green is better than blue which is better than yellow."

Plus, she's grounded for sneaking out. yeah i dont think i would ever sneak out. It would be fun though. I should! not go anywhere...maybe to the seven eleven down the street for a slushie. My parents would be so mad if they read this HAHAHA oh well. so yeah. Melissa's here right now. we haven't done much but it's been fun...i guess. we went to go see the village which was  good up until the last 30 min of the movie. but yeah. On the airplane home our plane crashed but everyone was ok.  We had to walk like 300000000 miles to the airport...that was kinda long but it was fun cuz we sang the 99 bottles of beer on the wall song...like 20 times. we sang it really REALLLY slow. ok i'm going to just leave it at that...oh yeah people give me comments!!!!

They have been there through thick and thin, whenever i needed them, where ever i went. They were there, with me, when i was just a child playing, having water balloon fights. While the other children playing had to resort to tiny plastic balloons that only held a cup and a half of water, I could whip out my big guns, literally. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had ""super-soakers"" of all sizes. When i was five I got a ""super-soaker 60"", that was the squirt gun that you had to pump 60 times to squirt it for 30 seconds, oh it was worth it though. To see children's faces as you drenched them from head to toe in water. It was bliss. Soon every kid on the block had one so i was forced to get a ""super-soaker 150"". It took me until i was 7 to afford this special model that you you had to pump it up twice as much, but on the other hand it held three times as much water. This meant less runs to the hose or nearby lake for fill-ups and more soakage. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When i was 8 my parents bought for me and my brother two ""Super-soaker 5000"" . This one was half as tall as myself, and although i could barely lift it when it was, I was ecstatic and couldn't wait to try out this exclusive gun. The next summer was trying is out. I saw a squirrel and thought i might scare it a little and work on my target practice at the same time. It was standing on an oak tree 10 yards away. I doubted my squirt gun could reach that far so i shot. Little did i know my evil brother had filled my innocent water gun with BB pellets turning it into a deadly weapon. When i shot at the squirrel my gun <FONT color=#ff0000>immediately</FONT> blew off its tiny head and it died. I remember that fateful day. I cried, my heart dying for the squirrel.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now 5 years later I am emotionally scarred. I remember that fateful day with such vividness that i believe i will remember it forever. On that day in mid-June i swore to myself that i would never pick up a squirt gun again.</FONT>&nbsp;&nbsp; </FONT>"

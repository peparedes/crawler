'It's <i>not</i> a word,' Morgan insisted, by now quite convinced of the inexistence of ""spefic"" merely because being on the opposing side of Gracie tended to always feel somewhat right.

Gracie turned his head so that his face was no longer directed toward his wrist which was held up at shoulder height. 'How would <i>you</i> know it's not?'

Morgan baulked. 'All right then, use it in a sentence.'

For a moment the suggestion seemed to stun Gracie to silence, and also - for a moment - he appeared to be doing some sort of strange dance, his left arm raised slightly and his head turned, a look of wide-eyed shock on his face.

Straightening himself up he sniffed (but not his coat sleeve). 'Fine then.'

'This'll be good,' Morgan murmured, and James and Alex, who had both remained silent up to that point - Alex because his head still hurt and James because he really didn't care that much - rolled their eyes at each other.

It probably couldn't get any more stupid.

Gracie started pacing across the floor with his arms crossed and tapping his right index finger to his lips as though in serious thought, the fact he kept trying to grab a sniff of coat sleeve every few seconds didn't do much to enrouage the feeling of belief towards him.

'Spefic, spefic, spefic,' he repeated and then stopped, either looking directly at or staring right past the Morgan, James and Alex against the cave wall.

Automatically they leant forwards, as though they expected him to whisper the answer.

'Spefic,' he said imperiously, breaking his pacing into a small strut, his chest puffed out somewhat. 'A keen feeling of-' he paused and glanced at Morgan from the corner of his eyes -'annoyance, characterized by the appearance of mad people who claim to be from another planet.'

'Grace,' Alex said lightly.

'To spefic,' he continued with a bright smile. '""A strange other-worldly girl speficked me to <i>death</i>. I nearly had to give up one of my five lives just to have the will to speak to her!""'

'Five lives?' James echoed.

'Spefically speaking,' Grace ignored the two boys and stood directly in front of Morgan. Somehow when he stood there with his shoulders perfectly straight and his arms crossed and he wasn't sniffing his coat sleeves he was rather impressive indeed. '""There was a big emergency and I was trying to help someone but an off-worlder was spefically speaking to me and it didn't help the situation at <i>all</i>.""'

Gracie stopped speaking but continued to glance pointedly at Morgan; to her credit, she didn't flinch at all in the face of a very thorough explanation that sounded somewhat plausible.

Alex thought it might have been time for an intervention from either himself or James, but Morgan spoke up.

'You're making it up.'

Gracie glared - a real hard and everlasting glare, the kind of glare that your worst enemy gave you whenever you bested them in a menial competition to see who was better at Tetris or Connect Four.

An impressive glare, even; for the first time since he'd met Grace, Alex felt a little threatened.

He looked ready to open his mouth and argue loudly and vehemently that she was wrong. But instead -

'Oh all right,' he shrugged and then went and sat back down in the dark corner of the cave, happily sniffing his coat."

'Did it ever occur to you that bears don't like to be treated that way?'

Sennet was mortified. 'You make it sound like they're used to being treated some <i>other</i> way!'

'They're going to kill you,' Gracie added for good measure; he hoped it sounded sufficiently far out as to convince Sennet otherwise, though he really was quite sure that the bears would kill any one of them.

'That's rubbish,' Sennet shook his head and a patch of his dark hair turned green.

Brennlen smiled, only slightly, but still a small yet noticeable smile. 'You believe it to be true.'

'What I believe to be true and what actually is are two entirely different things!' Sennet screeched, grabbing a nearby wide-brimmed hat with pink flowers attached to it and squashing it onto his head. 'Don't try me with fear, I don't care! I'll have green hair all day if I have to!'

It was at this point Gracie toppled onto the floor laughing. He was doing it in such a manner as to have convinced everyone in the room that he was stark raving mad and that the Earth villagers had stolen the very small part of his sanity when they ran away.

'What's so funny?' Sennet snarled and crossed his arms, looking quite ridiculous in his black work clothes and cheerful pink hat.

Gracie stopped laughing and Brennlen took a step back; he really <i>was</i> quite a bizarre fellow.

'We're all going to die.'

There was silence - that uncomfortable silence that seemed to go through Fire City every time the Sartha were spotted.

'Oh <i>really</i>,' Sennet rolled his eyes and even poked his tongue out. 'That's so ridiculous.'"

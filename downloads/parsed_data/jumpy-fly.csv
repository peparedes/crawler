"event","haha this is the greatest thing i have ever seen okay i got this from my cousins facebook.
it goes something like this.
The concept of Emo is actually a vicious cycle that never ends, to the utter failing of humanity, and it goes something like this: 

1. Girls say they like ""sensitive guys"" (lie) 
2. Guy finds out, so he listens to faggy emo music and dresses like a dork so chicks will see that he is sensitive and not afraid to express himself (lie). He dyes his hair black, wraps himself in a stupid looking scarf, develops an eating disorder, and rants about how ""nobody understands"". 
3. Now an emo guy, he meets Emo chick and they start dating, talking about how their well-off suburban lifestyles are terrible and depressing (lie) 
4. Emo guy is just too much of a pussy. His penis is too small, he's too depressed to bathe, and has more mood swings than emo chick, and he doesn't even have a menstrual cycle. Emo chick dumps him, saying ""It's not you, it's me."" (lie) as she drives off with Wayne, the school jock and captain of the football team. 
5. Emo guy goes home and cries, proceeds to write a weak song and strum a single string on his acoustic guitar. Another emo chick sees how he is so in touch with his feelings, and the cycle continues. 

This is the sad truth of the emo lifestyle/music, and now that I look at how pathetic it really is, maybe the emos DO have something to cry about! 

if there is anything more close to the truth than i wouldn't mind hearing it.
latez."

anyway so when i last left off i was going to my class and the bad thing is that i just came back and it sucks because now i have to write a 10 page essay about stories that i havn't even read. well i guess that sums up college for you. well anyway colin finally got to the concert after the first band finished playing and it turns out that i know the drummer. who knew. well any way yes after that another band came up i didn't really like them. well yeh the next band wasn't even ska they were punk/rap well anyway they were alright even though i didn't see them cuz i was waiting to get a t shirt but the streetlight guy took forever. bye the time i got the shirt the band whole wheat bread already started and finished. well thaths not it cuz i the middle of a streetlight song some guy went up to this other guy and clocked him in the face. oh well that usually happens at least once in a concert. the crazy thing is that the guy that got punched, his friend came up to me and started saying crap eventhough i didn't do anything. well that was the whole story. now i am going to get some lunch because i am starving. beebee to all."

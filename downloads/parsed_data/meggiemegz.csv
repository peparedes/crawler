You are sexy, powerful, and bold.
You're full of passion and energy...
Sometimes this passion has a dark side.

You feel most alive when you're seducing someone.
You never fail to get someone's attention.
Quick minded, you're also quick to lose your temper!</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/worldsshortestpersonalitytest/"">The World's Shortest Personality Test</a></div>"

You are elegant, withdrawn, and brilliant.
Your mind is a weapon, able to solve any puzzle.
You are also great at poking holes in arguments and common beliefs.

For you, comfort and calm are very important.
You tend to thrive on your own and shrug off most affection.
You prefer to protect your emotions and stay strong.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/worldsshortestpersonalitytest/"">The World's Shortest Personality Test</a></div>"

"event","I am so sick and tired of being at home. I'm tired of Dad and Mom arguing. I'm tired of still being treated like I'm 12.  I'm 21--I've lived on my own, I pay my own bills and I don't need my daddy and mommy telling me what to do, what to eat or when to get shit done. I'm responsbile and hard working and I'm tired of all of it.

I'm so stressed out about this wedding. I'm not even sure if I want to go through with it. I've been thinking so much lately about all that I still want to do with my life, and somehow, I have a feeling I'm gonna be giving it all up.  I know that Josh is worth it; he's great and I don't want to hurt him (Lord knows I definitely don't deserve him).  But I'm scared I might resent him if I don't get to do all the things I have my heart set on doing.

And you.  I miss you and that makes all this that much harder. You're far away from me right now and all I want is to hold you and kiss you, and tell you I love you and that I've missed you so much. I want you to wrap your arms around me, like you did at the playground, and tell me that you've missed me too and then never let me go.

"event","I should be working on one of the five papers I have due in less than a week.  But I'm not.  Instead, I'm wondering what might've been for about the hundredth time this week.
For some reason that talk really got to me. Since I've struggled to exponge every memory, thrown away every picture or letter, I found my self online, searching through various photos, mainly of your family.

And I wonder...



Staring at the evening sky
A pink haze as the clouds roll by
Mindful of memories from before
Are you happy now?

Gazing at a shooting star
backyard dreaming -- wondering where you are
Can't escape the dream I long for
Do you miss me  yet?"

"event","Life has been getting increasingly crazier lately.  (Sorry for the double modifier, but it's the best way to describe things as of late.)  

Where to start?  Ok. First, I'm feeling crappy.  I hate my wedding dress. I tried it on the other day, and for some reason, it just looked all wrong.  It's not what I want -- not at all. Not the color, not the make, nothing.  I'm feeling like nothing is going right.   

One of my bridesmaids is pregnant.  I took Jillian to the doctor Friday, and a blood test confirmed our suspicions.  And now, she and Adam are getting married before me and Josh. I know it's selfish -- but I'm just kinda bummed.  I'm happy for them, but I know if I was in the same situation, my parents wouldn't be helping me out; they wouldn't be paying for a wedding; they might not even be talking to me....   And I dunno, maybe it's just insult to injury, but I'm not in the wedding.  I understand they have to keep it small, but still... I dunno.
Britt's getting married too. She asked me to play the piano at her wedding.  ......... Also hard to handle.  She knows I hate to play in front of people.  
Jenner is moving away.

Krysten will be in North Carolina all summer and I'm seriously bummed. I feel like I need her here -- it's selfish and whiny and stupid, but I do. There's so much to do and think about and without her I just want to call the whole damn thing off..... 
Things are going so well for her right now. It really does make me happy.  Kevin, the guy she's been seeing, is really good for her, and he says he loves her.... Which is great -- she deserves to be happy, especially after all the crap she's put up with, and I'm glad that he can do that for her....


But, with all that's going on, I just feel left out.  Everyone, it seems, has bigger, better, more important or more exciting things going on.  I feel like an afterthought.  Unfortunately, Josh had to bear the brunt of all my tensions last night-- I think we just laid in bed for like two hours while I cried about everything and he listened and held me till I fell asleep.  

This is supposed to be one of the happiest times of my life... But it's not."

"event","Ahhhh... another week is over and my latest creation tastes damn good (and it's a cool blue color, so it looks pretty sweet too).  Anyway; it's Thursday night and my weekend is officially here! I've actually got nothing to do this weekend and I'm so ready to relax and have fun.  Tonight, I'm goin out with the girls. Tomorrow, I'm goin tanning, hangin with Nicky and Mighty and watching a movie with Josh-man and hopefully seein roomie, and Saturday is Palmer!!!! :)  I think we're gonna spend the afternoon playin' cornhole in the courtyard and then head over to P-fest around 6:00ish. I can't wait.
It's so weird to be almost finished with school -- I seriously cannot wait to just be through with it and not have to come back to Athens.  Anyhow...
So Krysten got a pretty sweet internship. I'm so happy and proud and sad. It's great for her, but I'm gonna miss my bestest buddy so much this summer. Way to go though -- it's incredible!  Part of me really wishes I was doing something like that, but the other part of me is so burned out on writing right now that I'm actually looking forward to 8 weeks of mindless drone work at Honda....
............ok. I'm gonna be done with this now. See ya later."

"event","Whatta weekend. I got nothing productive done and it was great.

Thursday...
I got home from class, went on a brisk walk, watched The OC and went to bed. I promised myself I'd get up bright and early to finish my paper.

Friday...
Got up bright and early, but it was insanely beautiful outside, so I decided it'd be better to hang out with Nicky.  After hanging out with Nicola, Josh and I grabbed some dinner and then indulged in a night of fun with Lowell, Sober, Olivia, Jenny, Amy and the strange foriegn boys that live below the girls.  

Saturday...
The sun was shining, the air was warm and Bruner was passed out on my couch when I walked into the kitchen to get some water...  After a quickie shower, I wound up in my bikini and spent the day reading, laying out and playing bochee ball. The evening was spent grilling out at Stroud's Run with Ry, Joshy, Annie-bell and Krysten. The ducks were crazy and ugly, but roomie liked 'em, so it was cool.  I'm domesticated n shit now-- I cooked burgers on the gril... OH... We had problems withe feet. It started with Annie. She scraped the skin off the top of her foot when we first got there... Then Joshy, who was being chased by Krysten, stepped in some 'bramles' and got one stuck all the way through his flip-flop and into his foot. Finally, a piece of hot charcoal fell on my foot whilst I was in the midst of fixing us some dinner. Weird.

Sunday...
Josh and I got up, played some frisbee and bochee ball.  Soon, Olivia and Jenny joined us. We played a raucous game of corn hole (Jenny, we were gooooooooooood) and then some hard-core soccer, which resulted in Olivia and me both getting screwed up ankles and bruises.  (Olivia wins the contest for most injured though--She had to go to the hospital this morning.)   Later, after we were all, in one form or another, baked, we decided to have a courtyard cookoiut.  It was a huge success.  Go us.


Presently, I'm at work, listening to a girl talking to herself and while she smells her fingers constantly. I'm not really sure how I feel about it -- should I like leave the room and give her some privacy or what? 
Anyhow..... :-D
Ciao."

"event","This was undoubtedly one of the best weekends ever. Sure, my original plans kinda got screwed up, but it wound up working out. Josh and I finally spent some much needed time just relaxing outside and having fun together. I've missed that so much.
This weekend made realize just how lucky I am, all over again. I think I fell in love with you five different times this weekend.... You're just that incredible. Sunburns and all, I wouldn't change any part of this weekend.

I love you."

"event","The end of my second week of my final spring quarter here at OU is nearly finished and I'm beat.  Most people I know take nice, easy schedules spring quarter, alotting adequate time in their schedules for sunbathing, frisbee throwing, jogging and relaxing in the the wonderful warm spring air. Me, I'm in class or working from 10-9:30. I know I can't really bitch about it; I made my schedule, not anyone else... but geeeeez man. This blows.
I keep wondering if pushing through and getting done a quarter early is a good thing. Will it really benefit me to save a couple thousand dollars by graduating early, or will it hurt me because I'll have to start paying back those damn loans? I just don't know.

Anyhow. Forget a nice seguay into my next topic, cause I'm fresh outta eloquence today.

I don't want to be a journalist anymore. I thought maybe it was just a phase, that I was simply experiencing the inevitable senior burn-out, but no... I really truly hate this. I hate Scripps, I have writing, I hate it all!!!!!!!!! I shoulda been an interior design major. ... or just not gone to college and found some other way to be filthy rich so I didn't have to have a structured, boring-ass  job.
I lied. I do like writing... I just don't want to have to write about politics... or people dying... or war... or celebrities... I think I want to write books, but I'm not sure. How would I even go about getting one published? Is it like writing a magazine article? Do I just have to query the publisher or something? Be like, ""So, I've got this idea. It could be a book. Ya want?"" or what?

I digress.

I'm sleepy now. I'm at work and I'm supposed to be studying for two quizzes I have in my next class, but I'm sitting here thinking bitterly about how I was stuck in the lab while everyone else was out frolicking (that is a weird looking word) in the sun. I do mean everyone else, cause there wasn't a soul in the lab 'cept for me.  I'm also bitter cause I'm trying to fnish my final paper from  last quarter when I was deathly ill and it's haaaaarrrd.
I want my mommy and a big chocolate chip cookie. With moosetracks icecream and a diet cherry vanilla dr.pepper. (I swear they chose the longest, most pretencious name on purpose.)  And Uno's pizza.... Yummy. And dammit! I want my engagement ring back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I sound PMS-y, but I'm not. At least I dont' think so. I supposed I could be, but I was on period over spring break and Easter, so I doubt it. Maybe I'm just hungry.

Hmmm.... Other news... Oh, my english teacher is amusing. (That seems to be the trend.) On our first day of class, she walked into the room, handed out notecards to everyone and theatrically shouted, ""I want each of you to draw me a puuuuusssssssssy.""  (After seeing looks of horror on our faces, she explained she her affinity for all things feline.)  My english prof is pushing 55, short and squat (prettier than Dr.Drew but built the same), always wears all black and has gigantic-ass emeralds attached to her ears, fingers and neck.  She's also like to swear. On our second day of class we did an exercise to demonstrate how insults nearly always have a sexual connotation, even in Shakespeare's day.  We had  to shout curse words at her and she wrote them on the board. (Slut, bitch, cunt, twat, dickhead, cocksucker, shitfucker & asshole are just some of the words I had to stare at on the blackboard for 2 hours.)  I'm glad she's amusing cause the class, Shakespearean Comedies, ain't my favorite.

Anyhow... Somebody should buy me some icecream or pringles. Or a new diamond ringy till I get mine back. Meggie is bummed."

From Krysten's first shot (3 wisemen) to the free buttery nipples that I got from the hot-body bartender, it was amazing. Even more amazing was that we all (Annie, Roomie, Me, Joshy, Ry-ry, Sunny, Nicola, Jase) had fun. I'm so glad. I'll write more later, but right now, I'm feelin' a bit sleepy. MUAH!"

"event","Yay for me and Josh (Moss, my partner). We nailed our Rolling Stone presentation and got an A from Brady. We even got him to muster up a couple compliments. Apparently, we know our shit and our presentation set ""new standards.""  Tizzzzight, right Kep?<br>

Roomie. You're still allowed to be mad at Josh. He hasn't done anything nice for V-day yet. He apologized like crazy Saturday and Sunday, but I think he still needs to suffer some. I'll let you know when we're finished being mad. I hope that you and Annie had a great time this weekend; I'm so bummed that I missed out on the fun. Sacrifices are a part of life I guess. I'm feeling prematurely old today...<br>

And Nicky. Don't fret. We're all cool. Josh and you and me. We'll talk later.<br>


Annie.I had a dream about your hair.  I was like purpley red and you were famous and you enlisted me to be your hair stylist. Then you married Jack White (from the White Stripes, omg, ewww and I'm sorry) and he wanted me to cut his hair too. But he had lice, so I told him hell no. You were grossed out by his head-bugs and divorced him. Then, you and me wound up on TV together and Krysten was some badass reporter with hair to her butt. I cut it on national TV and all this glitter fell from the sky and she looked like a supermodel (clothes and all) when her hair was finished.  Then I woke up and I had my hair all twisted around my fingers. Neat huh?"

I'm having trouble trying to sleep
I'm counting sheep but running out
As time ticks by
And still I try
No rest for crosstops in my mind

On my own... here we go

My eyes feel like they're gonna bleed
Dried up and bulging out my skull
My mouth is dry
My face is numb
freaked up and spun out in my room

On my own... here we go

My mind is set on overdrive
The clock is laughing in my face
A crooked spine
My sense dulled
Passed the point of delerium

On my own... here we go

My eyes feel like they're gonna bleed
Dried up and bulging out my skull
My mouth is dry
My face is numb

Stupid damn technological difficulties. I apologize for this error; it's a problem that I don't know how to fix and that Josh doesn't have time to deal with.
On a lighter note... I'm sick. (Sarcasm, yes.) Like super sick. I think this is what dying must feel like. I have a headache, my tummy is in knots and my throat is raw. I'm fairly certain I have TB or cancer or something... Ok, I'm being a bit of a hypochodriac, but stiiiiiiiiiiiill.  :(

"event","Yesterday I went to pick up my dars from my favorite professor. You're laughing. I'm being serious though. When I first met Reader, I absolutely hated him. I thought he was cocky, rude, self-righteous and way too damn liberal. And now, I realize all those presumtions I made the first time I met him are true. But he's also funny, kind, wise, witty, and inspiring. I'm certain that he's the best professor I've ever had. I'm gonna miss him when I'm finished here.
We have the classic love-hate relationship, ever since he instructed my news ed. class. He was ranting and raving about how maybe a headline came off as biased because it said something about dogs. I shot back something mouthy,about how it shouldn't matter because dogs can't be libeled, slandered or even form the thought that they're being insulted. Reader looked at me like horns had just sported out of my head, a wicked tail out my ass. My gleaming pitchfork, it seems, had stabbed him. ""You're such a blackhearted, wicked person Meg,"" he told me in front of our entire class.
Then, yesterday, after praising me for my grades and course load, he inquired if I'd be in his spring ethics class with my friend Lindsay. ""Of course,"" I informed him. Muttering under his breath, Reader listed off a 60 second spiel of profanities. ""God dammit. Fuck! Now i'm gonna have to deal with the two of you scrutinzing me and blowing raspberries any time I make a comment about George Bush. Shit!""  It made my day, because right after, he smiled, told me to get outta his office and have a great spring break. ""Oh I will. You too.""   
""Goodbye blackheart.""  It could be my hero's name. Megan... Blackheart. Almost as good as braveheart. ;)"

<P>I shouldn't complain. My life is picture perfect.

One who dropped his entire savings on a ring that's so beautiful I couldn't ever ask for more... A fiance that loves me enough to put up with my spoiled selfishness....<BR>And I have a wonderful best friend who's always there for me, in good time and bad. One who takes my side even when I'm wrong and balances me out. ...a friend that I've never deserved, but that I'll never give up.<BR>And finally, I have a good relationship with my mom.

The baby came out looking like Jude Law, but then the doctor handed the baby to ME, and was like, here's your baby... And Krysten was all like, dude, lemme see your kid.. Weird.
Then I had a dream about Nick. I killed him... in a very pleasant way... Very weird. Nicky, I'm promise I don't wanna kill you... I just over exterted you a lil and your heart got tired. Ooopsie...

So, now, it's time for another nocturnal adventure. Wahoo! :-D Maybe I'll get it on with Brad Pitt or something... That'd be sweet.

Randomness -- again.

Josh's mommy wanted to whore me out for money. I forget how the conversation got started but, here's how it went.

     Josh:  I'm so broke, it's not even funny.
     Greg (Joshy's daddy):  Well, you could sell that rock on Megan's finger and you'd have no more financial worries.
     Josh: Yeah, I know.. I need to make money quick.
     Greg: Well, you could get another job.
     Cindy (Joshy's mommy): Or, you could drop Meg off on a corner somewhere...
               Suddenly, my jaw drops... The room grows silent, and then all erupt into laughter.
     Cindy:  I guess that's normally the kinda thing Greg would say.

"event","<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not feeling so chipper right now...<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I haven't for the past couple days. For some reason, all those old feelings of insecurity are back and no matter how hard I try, I just can't shake them.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm feeling wretched and ugly and just down right horrible. I know what it was that set me off -- I know what I'm feeling so unsure of myself. I wish I hadn't let those horribel things get to me; but I did.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know that there are much worse things to feel than fat.&nbsp; I know that. And I know I'm not some obese of lard... but when someone pinches your sides and the skin under your chin, it really makes you step back and evaluate yourself.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know that I've gotten bigger; I know I don't look as good as I used to, but geeeeeeeeeeez. I've got about a million and a half things to do and plan and prepare for and I'm certain that very few other people my age understand the stress I'm feeling right now. <EM>I'm getting married. </EM>It's great and all, I love the planning, the excitement, but really... it's a lot to do, especially with school. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm a girl so I'm insecure anyhow. There are days when, even if I was 20 pounds lighter, I'd still feel awful...&nbsp; </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *sigh*</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Really, I don't mean to complain, but could ya please be a little nicer? I may not be built like your version of perfect, you might notice that I'm not skin and bone since you share an apartment with me. But seriously; it really hurts that you have to point out my imperfection.</P>"

take this as my apology
because ""i'm sorry"" 
just isn't in my vocabulary

tonight, take this
all of me
remember that you're my truest love
that i'm your wife-to-be

watch me move
and work my ways
follow my eyes
and hear me say

that i love you
and i'll never leave
just hold me close
feel me breathe

kiss my neck
i'll steal your breath
lean back 
feel for yourself

take this as my apology
because ""i'm sorry""
just isn't in my vocabulary

for the rest of your life
remember this
you're not the first
but my greatest kiss

the one i want
that i love the best
forsaking you
for no one else

so catch your breath
and watch me move
feel me apologizing
for every wound

for every word
and every glance
every time i took the chance
every time i knew i could hurt you 
and you simply would

forgive me before
i even asked
before i ever moved
or even cast
a second thought 
in your direction

take this as my apology
because ""i'm sorry""
isn't in my vocabulary

breathe in me
close your eyes
have no worries
please don't cry

tonight i'm yours
i've always been
it just takes me awhile
to let myself give in"

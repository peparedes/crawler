"event","So, it's about 11:00.  I'm sitting in my parent's kitchen on the computer.  My brain is fried.  My brain is also sad.  Today was not a bad day, but it's a day that I do not like very much.  Firstly, I had to get up to go do my C.S. final.  That wasn't too bad.  I actually felt kinda badass.  I got done a full half-hour early, and all the test cases worked as expected.  I got done that early despite the fact that I spent forever defining a procedure that I thought I desperately needed, but as soon as I got it working, realized that I didn't need at all.

After that, I went back to Collins for a light lunch and some goodbyes, including one to my sweet Kara.  I will be seeing her on Tuesday, though, as I start my new ""career"" in Indianapolis.  It was fun to talk with my friends and bittersweet to know that we were soon to part ways for a good while.

After that fuzzy stuff, I got to head over to good 'ol Jordan Hall A100 for the L112 final.  My brain still hurts six hours later.  I wrote...so....much....including the structure of a motor neuron, the structure and functions of the female reproductive system (worst sketch ever.  It was a blob with tentacle eyes), immune response, hormonal response and deficiency, GI tract stuff, function of the kidneys (which I wrote a frickin' book on, I almost kid you not), and a bunch of other random facts that took six days of studying to cram in.  After I poured my brains out on the page with the free-response, and mind you that was gross, it was on to the 50 multiple-choice questions.  By the end of it, my brain hurt so bad, as I may or may not have emphasized before.  

And even when I got through that unfavorable part of the day, then I had to go pack.  Note, I hate packing.  On top of that, I had to leave my friends behind, and I'm not likely to see any of them (save Kara and possibly Logan) until August.  We're all parting ways for a while.  Even though I know that I have so much to look forward to next year, because my floor is going to <i>rock</i>, it still is really hard to thing about going over three months without them.  I know that this is abrupt, but with that thought, I must leave you."

"event","Also within the last couple of months, I've been training with the university's Writing Tutorial Services.  It's a really great job that pays about as well as anything here, but is a lot more rewarding than working in the cafeteria.  I just got back from my second hour of tutoring for the week a little while ago.  It was a really great session.  The guy brought in a pretty lengthy outline for a paper on how The Cosby Show ignored the plight of the African-American community, and instead showed a really wealthy, perfect middle-class black family.  He wanted help developing a thesis, and I think I did really well for him.  It was a lot of fun, and I think we both walked away happy.

I think I have something to fall back on in case this whole C.S./Biology thing doesn't work out.  Which I know it will, but still...if I go crazy and can't handle real life anymore, I can just stay on in the English department here at IU and carve out a living of some sort.  For now, I've got one more week of work, and then next year, I'm a full-on tutor at about $7.50 an hour with ten hours a week.  Plus this looks great on pretty much any application ever.  So yeah, life is still awesome."

"event","*dusts off LiveJournal*  What the hell is this thing?  I feel like I'm in unfamiliar territory or something.  Anywho, I had the uncontrollable urge to write.  And it feels good.

So life is awesome right now.  Busy as all get out, but stupendous.  Kara and I have been dating for two months today.  Two months...I can't believe that it's only been that long.  In any other time in my life, I'd feel foolish for getting in as far as I have, but not this time.  She and I have made long-term plans already, and I have no doubt that we're going to follow through on them.  

Kara is simply the most wonderful person I've ever met.  She's my exact complement.  She's intelligent, confident, and beautiful.  The girl is going places, and I'm glad that I can be along for the ride.  She's absolutely sure of herself, and doesn't anything from the likes of me to feel good about herself.  I like that.  I like that a lot.  At the same time, she completely respects me, and is so madly in love with me, I can't imagine her doing me any harm physically or psychologically.  It's nice to be that secure.

Speaking of Kara, I might be living at her parent's house this summer.  I've applied for four internships in Indianaplis, three of which are at Beckman-Coulter, a bio-tech firm whose booth I was very interested in at the IT fair in the Fall.  One is for a job in their lab, which I probably wouldn't meet the requirements, as I don't have any lab experience.  The other two are a software engineer and software developer, both asking for a love of programming and good communication skills.  I think my C.S. work indicates the former, and I think my position as a writing tutor as listed on my resume indicates the latter.  I'm really excited about this.  Plus, I'm going to try to get some of my chemistry out of the way at IUPUI while I'm in Indy.  

On top of that, if all the internships fall through, I'll probably have a job at a men's formal-wear store.  I got a couple suits from the S&K in Greenwood, and when I picking them out, the assistant manager basically threw a job at me.  He's apparently pretty desperate for people, and really liked me, so I'm turning in my application this weekend when I pick up my second suit.  Just an aside, I have one of my new suits, and tailored pants are soooo awesome.

Classes are going pretty well.  I finished my Intro to Speech class on Monday with an <i>awesome</i> ten-minute speech on why embryonic stem cell research is really good and cool.  I know I've got a solid A in there.  Computer Science is fun.  I actually feel like I'm doing some decent developing now, rather than just crappy little programs.  Biology is really fun and interesting.  I'm not entirely sure how my grade will go in there, as I have the hardest professor in the entire department, and since he's an old-timer, he won't apply the curve until the end of the course.  I've learned a lot, though, and I'm loving bio more and more.  Finite is really easy, and has been no source of...interest most of this semester, although, as my title indicates, I have some work I should be doing for it right now.  My piano class is kind of lame, as my teacher is a little hardcore for this being a beginner's class.  Oh well, only two credits.

My final class is really cool.  I got into a rock climbing class for the second eight weeks.  By enrolling, I got a membership to the gym.  I've started going twice a week, and I'm getting pretty good now.  On top of that, it's really building muscle and burning what little fat I had around my midsection.  I never really thought I looked that good before, but I'm actually getting there now.  I've also started to eat really healthily.  I feel more fit and awesome than I have at any other point in my life.  

With that, I think I've covered most of the basics from the last few months.  So...yeah.  Life is really cool.  I'm super happy, and now that you've read all this, you must be happy, too.  So enjoy your happy life, reader, and I'll catch you on the flip-side."

"event","Man, that was weird.  Kara and I were talking about school and how the University has treated both of us very well for coming here, and one thing led to another, and I told her about my former dream of majoring in Music Business.  It's crazy to think that just a little over a year ago, I was drifting in a sea of doubt of what I wanted to do.  It was probably about a year ago exactly, I put it together and got excited about coming here to IU.

It's odd to look back on such a longstanding dream as going to Butler to eventually own a music shop of my own.  Looking back now, I would have never enjoyed that life.  I would have regretted it.  Now I'm doing exactly what I could always hope to do.  Every once in a while, especially as much as I've turned to music lately, I wonder if I should go back to considering music as a major.  I love playing and singing so much, but I think it would drain all my desire to have to do it so formally.  

This is the first time in a long time that I've told anyone that story.  I'm not even fully sure that I've told anybody the full story before.  It's such an odd sensation to have that 20/20 hindsight.  I wouldn't do anything else in the world besides what I'm doing now.  I've got a bright future, and a career ahead of me that has me excited more than I thought non-music could.  Probably even more than music.  On top of that, I've got people who care about me, an I've probably never felt so much belonging and care.  Just an interesting thought.  I don't know if it was really waxing philosophical over, but it triggered something in me."

"event","So I went to visit Kara tonight, after something was up last night.  I don't know what was going on, but when I went up, I was met in the stairwell going up to Kara and MB's room by none other than MB and her friend Quinn.  They said that Kara was upset, and it was probably not a good idea to go in there, so I talked to them for a while.  I didn't feel it my place to pry, and Kara didn't seem any need to talk about it tonight.

That's neither here nor there, however.  She was happy tonight.  Very happy, indeed.  We played Super Smash Bros. again, and we had about an equal win count.  We did that for about an hour until I think we were both completely played out.  Then we watched some internet vids, like we do, and then finished it off with some Monty Python with the Henry IV subtitles.

That was about an hour ago.  It was time for all to go to bed.  We turned off the movie, I put on my jacket, and then Kara did the sweetest thing.  She put her arms inside my jacket and held herself close to me.  She giggled when my unshaven cheek touched her neck.  I promised I'd shave as soon as I could get my hands on some shave gel.  She got out her raspberry...whatever gel, and offered it to me.  We decided I'd waft the scent proudly all day tomorrow.  Then she hugged me again.  

It's so hard to describe...just how intoxicating Kara is.  I can't put my finger on another time in my life I've felt quite like this.  Even tempered by my past experiences, and cautioning myself to be careful can't stop the fact that something...different is going on here.  I'm definitely happy with it, but I don't understand what's going on.  I'm fine with it, though."

My stuff is sitting on the bed, there is one more person besides my RA on the floor who has returned, and I think that he's asleep.  I've just turned on my podcast of This American Life, and it's one of my favorite episodes.  I'm getting ready to unpack my stuff and go to bed...

I have found joy.  The joy of walking onto Cravens 2, finding that Kara and Mary Beth are home, and having Kara over-joyously tackle me in the one the best hugs I've ever received.  Then we played Super Smash Bros.  Against my better judgment, I beat her in 1-on-1, but it was almost on luck.  She nearly had me.  At least she knows I was trying.  

You know, some people need an amazing night of romantic occurrence after romantic occurrence to glow, but a simple night like tonight...more than enough for me.  I can truly say, ""I'm happy."""

"event","Life's gonna be so much easier after today.  Last night I gave my group presentation for Gender in Fascist Fantasies, which had my nerves at their ends for a while.  Besides the three pieces of documentation for the project and the final two-page ""feelings"" journal, I'm pretty much done with that class.  Praise be...

Now I have to worry about my final meeting for guitar today.  I have to perform the theme to ""Autumn Leaves,"" my least favorite thing to play the entire semester, as well as parts of the melody line, and then one of the other pieces from the semester.  I also have to hand in the write-ups of the four concerts I went to this semester, of which I just finished the second.  Since, knowing how slowly I write, I got those two done in the last forty-five minutes, I'm not too worried about having those ready before class.  Plus, I've done excellently throughout the semester, and I'm not <i>too</i> worried about the performance final.

After this, I'm pretty well set.  I know that sounds premature, as finals week doesn't start for five days.  The only thing with that is that I have my Calc II final on Monday night, which I've stopped worrying about.  I just found out yesterday that we're taking the department Calc II final instead of one written by Dr. Peters.  Looking over last year's test which he gave us as review, this is going to be about a third as hard as the other exams we've taken.  After that, I don't have another final until Informatics Thursday night, which given my grades thus far and the simplicity of the last exam, I'm not too worried.  Finally, I have a Biology final Friday afternoon, after this place turns into a ghost town.  I figured up my grade yesterday, and I've got about a 96%...so I think I'm going to have to really botch it to drop my grade drastically.

So...today is the last day I really have to worry about.  I can stop freaking out about school, and have some fun.  I know I'm planning fun movie watchings with friends, and maybe Kara and I will finally have enough time to actualy go out again instead of just hanging around here.  Anyway, I'm excited and stuff.  I've now got to go grab a shower and get to Calc, so until next time, this is Chris Frisz, about to be a clean boy."

It really makes me want to quit school, buy a pair of leather pants, and just be a frickin' rock star.  There's a silly dream, but I'll always love it.

After I got back and had lunch, I went to Informatics today, and as always, Dr. D had a bunch of candy that he had passed through the lecture.  He let us out early, and the candy hadn't passed very quickly, so there was a lot left.  Dr. D never wants the remnants, so he tried to pawn it off on Flobee, but Flobee convinced me to take it.  That's funny, though, because I had no intention of eating any of it.  Instead, I came back to Collins, dropped my stuff off, and then roamed every floor of the main quad.  I got through Smith pretty quickly, because nobody had their doors open, so I went over to Cravens and knocked on every door of every person who seemed to be in and gave them candy.  It took me about forty-five minutes, but I went through every floor and met a whole bunch of people that I didn't know were here.  It was really entertaining to see that every person I propositioned took free candy.  I just made a lot of people disobey their mothers.  It was fun, though.  I'm kind of tempted to buy some candy with my own money and do it again.  And now it's off to do Informatics.  Until next time, this is Chris Frisz, the candy man."

We started out at about 8:00 and headed toward Cafe Django, which the internet told me was on Fourth Street, but it turns out it was Grant.  We were lost for a short bit, and it was momentarily awkward while I tried to figure out how to get there, but we made it.  Neither of us were very hungry, so we ordered food, but only pecked at it a bit and talked for a long time.  We crack each other up like nobody's business.  We both love Homestar Runner references, Simpsons...it's fun.

After dinner, I lured her back to my room with the promise of Sonic the Hedgehog.  She's a huge fan, and I let her play for a while.  For some reason, and I know this is weird, that was when the real bonding happened.  Dinner was fun and all, but sitting there, playing video games was the connection.  She stayed longer than she should have, and then I walked her back to her room after she got her fill.  I don't know how many times she told me that she had a lot of fun, and even better, I don't know how many times she hugged me.  You know what that means: date next weekend.  I'm hoping for dinner and <i>The Prestige</i>.  Like tonight's date, this has already garnered praise for the choices I've made.  I'm hoping we get to hang out more this week, though.  We'll see what the week brings.  I'm optimistic.  I really like this girl.  She makes me feel...comfortable.  She makes me feel happy.  I still don't know where this is going, but I'm not going to mind any direction at this point.  Now, however, is a time for sleep.  This is Chris Frisz, sleeping a happy man."

Thursday's concert let me know something very important: I love Ben Folds.  The concert was amazing.  I thought he was a talented musician, a spectacular performer, and even really funny on top of it.  I've been downloading some of his stuff, and I'm blown away with each song.

With that, I've discovered one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard.  ""The Luckiest"" is simply amazing.  It's not often that a song brings a tear to my eye.  It is so beautiful.  I want to write songs like that.  If I could write songs like that, and I knew there were people out there who would listen to me play them, I don't care how much money I make or where I live.

"event","Do you guys remember the endless hours that I spend in the Writing Lab during my senior year of high school?  All the time, the kids, the horrible papers, the grammatical errors, and the bad arguments?  Something useful came of that this week.

I got an email early in the week from a Dr. Laura Plummer, telling me that my Biology professor, Dr. Leonie Moyle, had recommended me for a position at WTS (pronounced ""wits""), the Writing Tutorial Services.  First, I was weirded out because I have done no writing for Biology, so there's no way that Dr Moyle knew my writing abilities.  As I read further in the email, it became apparent that I was being offered to apply for a position very much similar to my unpaid job in high school.  It then became apparent that if I applied, I might be chosen to go through training next semester, which would include getting paid, and then in the 2007-08 school year, I would become a full employee, pulling in $7.00 an hour, untaxed, while working hours at Ballantine, and $8.00 an hour working at the other three WTS centers.

The only requirements were that I write a letter outlining my experience and interest in the job, I give a resume if I had one, and present a piece of writing I've done for an IU class.  I don't have a resume, but I wrote up a letter informing Dr. Plummer of my 100+ hours (which I think was still quite conservative) as a peer editor for my high school, plus my high marks in writing courses.  I also informed her of how much I enjoyed the job and would be willing to put the work in for WTS.  After that, I printed off a copy of my first position paper for Gender in Fascist Fantasies, and hand-delivered my application packet to Dr. Plummer's secretary.

Fast forward to about an hour ago.  I checked my email, and there was a message in my inbox from Dr. Plummer saying that her assistant had handed her my application packet, and that she wanted me to call to schedule an interview with her in about a week and a half.  I checked the time on the email, and it was sent at 5:02 PM.  I had delivered the packet at about 4:45 PM.  I about crapped myself.  Beside working in a music or video game shop, this is pretty much my dream job, and it pays a lot better than either of those others do.  This is friggin awesome.  So, yeah, there was even more awesomeness to my week.  Until next time, this is Chris Frisz, an editing junkie."

"event","I can't even describe to you all.  It basically breaks down into two parts: Kara and Ben Folds.  So, there's this girl who lives in Cravens that I met a couple of weeks ago.  She had just gotten back from watching some of her friends so they didn't get alcohol poisoning/raped.  For some odd reason, we both went to the piano at the same time and sat next to each other.  As it turns out, she actually plays piano and I don't so much.  So she played stuff for me to my great pleasure.  Did I mention this whole time that she was in a really good Lara Croft costume, and it didn't hurt a thing that she looked really good in it?  Anyhow, we had a lot of fun, and I was attracted, and I got the feeling maybe she was, too.  But the hour got late, and she had to go.  I finally got a name to face: Kara.  Yes, it has caught me off guard more than once thus far, but it's fine.

So, that was a couple weeks ago.  Last week, we had no idea of each other's schedule, so we didn't even get to see each other at all last week.  This week was different, though.  I assaulted their room on Monday night, when I should have been working on stuff, and she and I got to hang out.  I also got to meet her roommate, Mary Beth, who is a cool character.  Which reminds me...::adds Mary Beth on Facebook::.  Ok, done.  But we hung out, figured out that the same kind of humor tickles our fancies, and showed off our favorite flash videos to each other.  Needless to say, I was pretty much glowing for the rest of the night.  I tell you, I don't think I've had an irrational crush like this since I was in middle school.  I did not, however, intend to spend an hour and a half with her.  Damn my busy life...

The next couple of days didn't see as much interaction, as I was really busy with class.  I had a Gender in Fascist Fantasies position paper due this week, and I basically locked myself off from the world on Thursday to get it done.  After it was turned in, though, I was a happy and ready to hang out with people.  I was deciding what to do on IUB's campus on a Thursday night without getting hammered.  It was tough.  Tough until most of my friends had left from dinner, and I was still sitting at the table when Kara came and sat with me.  I explained the situation to her about how I wanted something to do that night.  She told me that she was going to the Ben Folds concert, and that she bet there would still be seats.  So we went up to her room and tried to get me tickets, but ticketmaster had the event closed, and we instead entertained each other with flash videos.  I'm starting to see a theme in this relationship...

But we headed over to the Auditorium (it's a proper noun), and I tried to get tickets.  Turns out that everyone in the 11th row had returned their tickets, and I got better seats than most people who bought tickets minutes after Ticketmaster opened it.  Kara and Mary Beth were upset with me, so I urged them to take the obvious course of action and break the rules.  Since the tickets had been returned, and the seats held until noon the day of the show, the 11th row wasn't going to fill up, so they came and sat with me.  And I got to sit with Kara.  

There's so much I could say about the concert.  It was amazing.  It was hilarious.  It was fun.  I've never had such a great time at a concert.  I was dying laughing the whole time, from the opening act, Corn Mo (who played frickin Freebird on an accordion!), to Ben Folds trying out the infamous ""brown note"" on the crowd, it was great.  And I got to spend it with Kara.  I'd wager to say that it made the experience better for both of us.

If you imagined how much I was glowing after first getting to spend time with her, you can just imagine how much more I was glowing today.  I came to a realization, though.  I couldn't put off asking this girl on a date or something.  Now, as I mentioned, I'm madly ""crushed"" like a schoolboy at this point, but also scared to death like one.  To make matters worse, this is the weekend for me to come home.  Thus, I went to Emily, my guide to girls, the universe, and everything, and asked her what to do.  She told me to go grow some balls and ask the girl on a date.  Eventually her urging worked, and I went and asked Kara to go to Cafe Django with me on Sunday night.  A weird night, I know, but it was the best I could do.  She pulled out her planner, and even though she's a tad busy Sunday night, she agreed without hesitation.  I'm just...blown away.  I'm about as happy as I get right now.  So, one of my rougher weeks out of the way, and the return?  A concert, and a date with a pretty girl.  Good, good stuff.  Also, there are other awesome things that I'll have to put in another entry, because this one is kind of annoyingly long.  Anywho, now you can feel more up to date with my life.  Take care, children."

"event","Wow, I've just realized how much change has gone on in my life over the last few months and especially the last few weeks.  I've done things that I never thought I would do.  I've met people that I would have never had a great amount of interaction with before.  The thing most amazing is that I don't regret a one of them.  I can look in the mirror and like the person I'm becoming.  Life is in my hands, and I like it that way."

"event","Let's just get this out there: tonight was my blind date.  For those who are not aware, the other day Isaac set me up with a girl that he went to high school with named Aimee.  She was sitting with him at lunch in the Ed dining hall on Monday.  He called me over to talk to him for no reason.  I noticed that he was with his girlfriend, Jackie, and some girl that I didn't get a good look but was aware of her presence across from him.

Later, I came up to my room to put my things up, and I saw that Nathan and Isaac's door was open.  Because I'm wont to do so, I wandered in.  Lo and behold, there's this random girl that I don't recognize talking on her cell phone.  It was even weirder because Nathan wasn't in the room, and I didn't immediately see Isaac.  Despite the fact that she had up to this point seen me once for about a minute, this random girl greeted me rather warmly, and I returned the favor.

After she left, I asked Isaac who that was and whatnot.  He claimed that I should have recognized her from lunch with him.  I said that I didn't notice her.  His response was, ""Oh, she noticed you.""  The problem was that he left it at that.  He wouldn't say another word, and wouldn't say anything more for a number of hours.  All the while, I was just wondering if she thought that I was cute, and that was it.  I came to find out a few hours later that she didn't just think I was cute.  She told Isaac to give her number to me.  He kept talking about doing it, but he kept not doing so.

Fast forward to Tuesday.  I was in Nathan and Isaac's room, and Isaac remembered about Aimee's number, wrote it down on a notecard, and gave it to me.  Not only that, but he told me that I had to call her that day and set up a date.  I protested, saying that I was too busy that day to call her, and that I was probably going to be too busy for the rest of the week to go on a date.  He proceeded to pull out his cell phone, call Aimee up, and tell her that he just gave me her number, and that I would be calling soon.

So I did.  I invited her to coffee with me at Soma, a local hippy-owned coffee shop on Bloomington's famous Kirkwood Avenue, at 7:30 on Thursday.  She gladly agreed, and the date was set.  Ok, so it was actually changed to 6:30 because of open mic tonight that I really wanted to make.  That, too, was agreed upon, and the date was on.

So today I had a pretty stressful day with things to get done, and to get ready for a basically blind date.  It all got done, though.  I then walked out to the courtyard and there she was.  We walked off to Soma, talked about school, interests, and whatever the hell you talk about with someone you've never spoken with before, but are now on a date with.  I was pretty worried about how it would go, not being a blind date kind of guy, but it actually went really well.  We had our coffee, talked for a while, and had fun.  We then went back to Collins in time for me to grab my guitar and get on the signup list for the open mic.  Aimee had originally told me that she wouldn't probably be able to stay for it, but she did.  My turn eventually came up, and I played ""Tiny Dancer"", like I've been wanting to do for days.  People seemed to enjoy me, so I played ""You Belong To Me.""  They still weren't sick of me, so I finished it off with ""Hands Down.""  Everybody was very complimentary about it.  Aimee was, too.  Around 10:00, she said that she should be getting home, so I walked her to the door, and saw her off.

As I said, the date went really well.  The only problem is that I'm not that interested in Aimee.  She's a sweetheart, definitely, but she's just not my type.  She'd be a great friend, but who likes laying that line on somebody?  As she left (with a big grin on her face), she told me to call her again sometime.  Unfortunately, I agreed.  I'm too much of a nice guy.  I don't know what to do now.  I've determined and been told by several girls that ""call me sometime"" means that I've got some time to figure out what to do.  Also, I've got Isaac, who is a good friend of Aimee's, to consult with on what I should do.

It was definitely a nice evening, though.  I hate to be such a downer by worrying about how well it went, but it was good for me.  I know now that people, particularly girls, still like me.  I can be loved.  That I know.  With that, dear friends, I'm going to bed.  Goodnight, all."

"event","I know things are good when I turn on my iPod, walk outside, realize it's a beautiful Fall day, and grin all the way to class.  Something about life has gotten very, very good.  There's a tinge of sadness every once in a while, but life has gotten easier over the last few weeks.  I've found myself as a singular entity again.  I started singing for the first time in forever.  I think over a dozen songs have come back to me, and there's a quality to my voice that I don't remember having before.

In a word, I feel ready to take on the world.  There's an open mic night here at Collins on Thursday, and I'm dead set on playing Tiny Dancer.  I just can't wait to get out there again and play for everyone.  I'm just imagining a huge crowd of people screaming the lyrics to Elton John's classic at the top of their lungs.  All of a sudden, I feel like I can't live without it.  For the first time in a long while, I feel like quitting school and becoming a rock star.  It would work, I promise.  

I just don't know how to describe it.  I know these seem like unrelated concepts and aren't as coherent as I tend to be (no comments on that), but they make sense in my mind.  I feel...free. It doesn't feel like anything could ever be wrong again.  Anyway, that's my two bits for the night.  Take care, all."

"event","I learned something tonight: Halloween is not October 31, it's the Saturday night closest that everybody can get crazy.  I, unfortunately, took a big part of those festivities tonight.  First, there was the Immortal Ball in the Edmondson dining hall.  I was dressed as a female gypsy for a while.  Everybody loved it.  I think I was the favorite straight guy in drag.  I tell you what, those gay guys, whom I'm good friends with, can put together some awesome drag.  The skirt was killing me, though, so a guy named Dylan on the third floor who I've had some recent good times with did me up with <i>awesome</i> zombie makeup.  Latex flesh and blood and everything.  It was amazing.

After that, we headed to the Buskirk-Chapman Theater for the midnight showing of <i>Rocky Horror Picture Show</i>.  That was definitely the way that movie was to be shown.  It was such debauchery and so entertaining...words can't even describe.  There was a din of people yelling at the screen the whole time, and what seemed to be a cult that knew a whole bunch of hidden lines not included in the movie to yell in unison at various points.  I really don't know what to think about it overall, but I do know that I got to squirt the audience with a squirt gun, throw toilet paper, and was ordered to hump some girl that I kind of know from the first floor for dear life as to get rid of my Rocky Horror virginity.  

Once that was over, I wasn't sure what to do.  I came back to Collins and showered.  Getting rid of all that makeup and latex was fun stuff.  I still have eyeliner.  Once that was done, I was going to go with Kaleb and Flobey to a house party, but they left before I was ready, even though they said they would wait.  So instead, I headed over to Cravens and checked in with Emily Kuhn and Erica.  Their door was wide open, so I peeked my head in.  Erica was dead asleep in her bed, and a person who I thought was Emily was passed out half naked on the other bed, so for their sakes, I pulled the door mostly closed.  Just then, Emily comes out of the bathroom carrying water, and informed me that the other person was her little sister who had come to visit.  Emily invited me in, as both sleeping occupants of the room were not going to wake up anytime soon, and we talked about girls and guys.  She's a good friend to have around.  Better than I had guessed before.  

After she decided that Erica and her sister weren't going to die from alcohol poisoning, Emily wanted to go to bed, so I headed back to Smith.  Once there, I learned that Flobey was taking another group of people over to the party, so I agreed to join.  I thought there would be people there for me to hang out with.  Turns out I was wrong; it was dead, and people were just doing shots.  Despite said unexcitement, I did find my drink of choice.  I paid a dollar for a shot of spice rum mixed in with Dr. Pepper.  That was <i>soooo</i> good.  I finally found a manly drink that I enjoy drinking.  After that, there was a little bit of my shot left, so I downed it, and it turns out that I just like spiced rum.  

That said, I don't know if I'm still into this party/light drinking thing.  Parties are going to have to get a lot more fun, and I think I'm going to give up on any drinking.  The ""no more drinking"" is for two reasons.  One, it seems that everybody, with the exception of Emily Kuhn, who gets drunk around here is really depressed, and I realize that I probably won't be a fun drunk anytime too soon.  Second, after that shot of spice rum, my shoulder hurts really bad for the first time in a long time.  I think it's a sign.  ::sigh:: It's time for me to go to bed, children.  Tomorrow is a busy day, so I might as well hit it head on.  Take care, all, and keep talking to me."

"event","So last night was fun.  There was a comedy group here called ""Boy in the Bubble,"" and they're apparently not that good, which is why I didn't go to the show, but then a lot of people were heading to the afterparty.  My group that came in and watched <i>Fight Club</i> with me decided to go, so I figured, ""why not?""  So I went to my first house party.  Got a cup for $3 with unlimited refills.  Don't worry guys, I didn't get drunk.  I had half a cup of Killian's.  

I actually really enjoyed it.  There weren't that many people who were totally wasted, and it wasn't total debauchery.  Lots of happy people who were a little drunk (and some smoking weed, unfortunately) and fun was had.  It was a nice way to relax after a week like this.  I guess I'm a little more ""normal"" now.  It feels a little weird, but a little better somehow.  So...yeah. My first party.  My first unsupervised underage drinking.  I don't know if I'll make it a habit at all, but I don't regret it.  Oh, and Jessica was right, a cold beer after a stressful day (or week) is like the best thing ever.  I'm totally taking Dad up on his offer to have a little beer and watch a little TV while I'm home.  Anywho, that's all I had to say.  Have fun, kids, but not too much."

"event","This week has been such a stark contrast to last week.  Follow an amazing week in a warm, happy place with one in a cold, wet place, trying to fight unhappiness at every turn.  I don't even know what to say except that I know it's going to be alright, but it's not right now.  I've gotten by how I've always gotten by: stay busy.  With a week like this, it's been more than possible.  Three midterms in as many days.  Yesterday: guitar.  Today: Informatics.  Tomorrow: Calculus.  What better way to bury my sorrows?  Well...there's alcohol, but I haven't gotten that low yet.  

It's all just so weird.  I've never had an experience in my life like this where I still loved someone, but I needed to stop for both our sakes.  It's so hard.  I still miss Cara.  Last time this happened, all the memories immediately went in a heap and got burned.  That's what I cared for them, and that's what I needed of them.  Now...I'm having trouble actively taking things down.  I just today got my Facebook relationship status changed.  I still need to take the pictures off my desk.  Who knows what else I need to do.  So many symbols of us that I just don't care to get rid of.  I just don't know.  On average throughout the day, I'm pretty happy, but there's this cold place deep down that wells up when I'm alone.  It'll be ok, though.  Until then, I'll leave with the lyrics of Breaking Benjamin:

<i>Sing it for me
I can't erase the stupid things I say
You're better than me
I struggle just to find a better way

So here we are, 
fighting and trying to hide the scars
I'll be home tonight,
take a breath and softly say goodbye
The lonely road,
the one that I should try to walk alone
I'll be home tonight,
take a breath and softly say goodbye.</i>"

"event","This week has been strange, right?  Nothing has been more actively weird to me than Tuesday after I101.  I had a question for Dr. D regarding Entropy in a network (not free energy.  I was confused at first, too).  He answered another person's questions, and then told me to follow him, because we were going to Panera Bread.  I told him that I didn't have any cash and that my debit card had been frozen.  He told me that it was his intention to pay.  He said that I'm an undergrad and I'm poor, and that I can pay him back when I have a real job.

On the way, we started talking about religion, and he tried to illustrate to me the difficulty of holding religious beliefs like I have in the field I hope to go into. He questioned me about my beliefs and listened and laughed a bit.  He seemed genuinely interested, though, because as he said, people who have religious beliefs like mine are usually very hard to get along with, but that he finds me easygoing even compared to most people.  

It was funny, because the purpose of our outing was for Informatics, but he spent most of it trying to keep me on my toes about my religious beliefs.  I think he's very interested to have me explore more of what is out there and be sure that I should stick with what I believe.  Of course he's right.  What's faith without knowledge?  What's the point of calling my belief faith unless I look at many opposing views, and yet hold to this.  Although, I think he would really like to see me give up religious observance altogether.  He enjoyed telling me about how Gilgamesh was much older than the Bible, and contained many of the same elements.  He also tried to tell me about how the flood wasn't such a big deal after all.  At the same time, though, I think what I told him piqued his interest.  He told me that whatever lies after this life, if it doesn't put him in the same place as his parents, he doesn't want any part of it.  The way that I told him I believe is one of the only things he's heard that would for sure lead him to staying with his parents.

There was a part of our outing about Informatics, though.  We discussed class stuff, which I got pretty quickly.  We then started to discuss Bioinformatics.  He told me about some classes I need to look into, such as intro to Bioinformatics, a 400 level class (in my freshman year...::shudders::).  He explained some problems he's exploring with his partner who just moved to town with his wife so he and Dr. D could get to work on their own company.  He then told me that I need to change my focus minutely to Informatics with a cognate in CS (basically a BS in Computer Science) and my current Biology major.  He told me that would write my ticket to any grad school I wanted.

The next part was the most exciting and the most frightening, though.  He told me that every semester of I101, he notices one or two students that ""sparkle,"" and that I was one of those.  He said that when he sees those students, he takes them under his wing and gives them special opportunities.  He said that he's going to start looking for internships in wet labs for me.  The next thing he told me was, ""I'm going to be honest with you.  Most every student that I've taken under my wing has found fame and/or wealth.  You've definitely got the potential, if you're willing to take the opportunities I give you.""

It's a very, very strange feeling to have a man, out of the blue, take you aside and say that he'll give you fame and fortune if you follow him.  I don't know what this means, but it affirms my hypothesis that Dr. D is the man most important to my success in Informatics.  He took me back to campus after a while, and we talked about some other stuff.  He told me the secret to being an academic success, such as buying math practice books for each course and just doing all the problems.  He said the most important part is to not let the professor know how much you know, so they think you're a genius.  He also told me to go way out of my comfort zone and study abroad in a place that I don't understand the language, such as an Asian country.  Now there's a weird idea, me spending a semester in Singapore.  Anyway, it was a weird afternoon, and I'm not soon to forget it."

"event","This was a fun weekend.  I actually went home on Friday, although I wasn't planning on it.  When I got near Scottsburg, I could see just how welcome I was by how the weather was acting.  The rain was coming down harder than I've ever seen it in this area.  Dad later told me it was coming down at four inches per hour.  Anywho, I drove very slowly and carefully, refusing to pick up the cell phone call from Dad telling me I should pull off for safety's sake (there's an incredible amount of irony in that).  When I got home, the parents were overjoyed to see me, as were all the pets.  They showed me all the stuff that they had procured in the last month, including a new ceiling fan in the living room, which is really nice despite the fact that it nearly hits me in the head if I walk directly underneath it.  They also got a new vacuum, finally, and they're really happy with it.  They even took the time to show me its features, and luckily I'm enough of a techno-enthusiast to appreciate it.  

Nothing else very exciting happened until the next day.  We managed to get on the road on time, and arrived at the Hilton Indianapolis North with time to spare, while I managed to sleep most of the way there.  Once we arrived, choir practice went smoothly, despite my lack of brain function.  As time for services approached, Mom and Dad seemed to be at a big church reunion.  I can't even tell you how many people they met for the first time in twenty-odd years.  Amusingly enough, I've been going to church with most of them for a few weeks now, and neither me nor said people knew.  

The first service was good.  ""God Is There"" went off without much trouble, minus my singing during one of the women's parts of ""God is watching,"" but it was minor, and nobody could have heard it.  Following that, Mr. McNeely spoke.  Mr. McNeely is the first minister in a long time that I've experienced who can give a full, deep, well-developed, well-delivered sermon that makes me feel good every time.  He spoke about our job with an analogy with the Coast Watchers in the Pacific Islands during WWII.  They sacrificed themselves to help inform the American soldiers about incoming Japanese attacks.  I won't go into heavy detail, but it was right down my alley.  Copious notes were taken.  After the morning service, we went to Golden Corral, and grabbed Roy Sutherland on the way out.  He enjoyed eating with us, and informed me about his crazy plans for pimping out his '92 Chevy Astro van that's currently not what one would call a ""pimp wagon.""

Following lunch, we had the second service.  The choir sang ""Behold the Lamb"" for that service.  I love that song.  It's really amazing.  I've found that I like contemporary choral pieces like ""God Is There,"" but I <i>love</i> traditional-style pieces like ""Behold the Lamb.""  It was amazing, and I loved performing it.  After that, we had a sermon by Mr. Kubic.  It wasn't necessarily a bad sermon.  It was just not terribly interesting, and it was a bit unfocused.  Also, I noticed Mr. Kubic is more Russian than I ever noticed before.

After services, I learned that Mitch Moss and his family were there in Indy.  He came and found me, and we talked for a long time about various things.  He didn't know that I was in the Indy area now, and going to church there, so he said that he would start visiting me every once in a while.  He also said he's going to try to see me at IU, as he's going to a Ben Folds concert here at the Auditorium.  That made me really happy.  

Other than the trip to Indy, everything else was pretty standard.  Being home made me kind of sad.  It made me miss home, but it also made me edgy to be back here in Bloomington.  It was an odd dichotomy that made me feel weird a lot of the time I was home.  It was as though I had something I really needed to do after Sabbath, but there wasn't really anything for me <i>to</i> do.  Except my Informatics homework, which I was three minutes early for turning in, having used some of Cruz's answers, and later finding some were wrong.  Oh well.  I had a good time at home.  I was glad to see my parents and the pets.  I'm pretty disheartened with the way the animals are roaming the house, but I started to get used to it toward the end of my visit.  

To make up for it, though, Mom did buy me a lot of useful things, and I'm doing well on my budget, anyway, so I think that I can get myself a new game or two.  Or three.  I'll admit, I was bargain shopping, and I managed to find three games that I've wanted for quite a long time, and I could procure them all for about $26, shipping and all.  I'm still trying to decide whether I should spend that, <i>and</i> if I'll ever have time to play three video games on top of all the ones I have now.  

So, there you have my weekend.  I know, lots of detail with little interest.  At least nothing bad happened.  I'll leave you with a funny story, though.  Nothing has been too interesting here since I got back up until I heard Kaleb yelling about something in the hall.  I went out there to see him fondling a hair on his nipple, proclaiming how long it was.  He kept yelling down the hall (at about 11:30, mind you) that he had the longest nipple hair in the world.  We soon found that wasn't true, as the longest nipple hair is three and a half inches long, and his is only three inches long.  We're rooting for it to grow, though, and in the meantime, we're making a YouTube documentary about its progress, and we're probably going to make Kaleb's Longest Nipple Hair our official Smith 2 mascot.

I wanted to be good and waked up for my exam this morning, as well as look at some stuff before I actually go take it.  Side effect of this is that I might be a grumpy boy today.  I apologize in advance if I'm a jerk to you today.  Second, which I've been noticing because of poor Cara, my laptop isn't doing what I expect it to do.  When I run out of the room and forget to put on an away message, I'm used to it logging me out before anybody cares to talk to me.  If you have tried to talk to me and I haven't answered, I'm sorry.

"event","Oh, wow.  My head is about to pop.  Curse you, beloved Calculus.  But I digress.  Most of my day was standard.  Went to Calc, which was review for our exam tomorrow.  Came back, had lunch with Nathan and Alex.  That was fun.  It's always an entertaining time to hang out with them and eat.  It beats sitting in my room and having Fast Mac (Marsh's take on Easy Mac). To think, if I hadn't eaten with them, I wouldn't have heard Alex's genius grammatical observation of ""Capitalization is the difference between, 'I helped my Uncle Jack off a horse,' and 'I helped my uncle jack off a horse.'""  

Anywho, I then went to Bio, which was an interesting lecture on Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium.  I really find Biology fascinating.  When I got back, I started playing ""The Hidden"" for a while, while Alex whispered creepy things in my ear, as I was mercilessly slaughtered by the Hidden.  Cool, cool game.

6:00 rolled around eventually, which meant I needed to leave for guitar soon.  It was about this point that I realized I had to write out all seven major and all seven minor scales along with their respective triads before class.  I freaked out, but guess what?  I got it done.  Then I had some McDonald's with Alex and Justin.  That was fun.  We entertained each other with the line ""Shampoo for my real friends, real poo for my sham friends,"" which spawned from the line ""Champagne for my real friends, real pain for my sham friends.""  We also discussed Alex's continuation of the Shampoo line, ""Shampoo for my real friends, poo poo poo poopy poo!""  Just say it out loud.  You'll giggle a lot.  I promise.

Once I got home from that funness, I started studying for Calc.  And I didn't stop until about a half hour ago.  It was ridiculous.  I feel like I'll explode during the exam tomorrow.  Oh well...anyway, I thought I'd let you all know, as if anyone was interested in my day.  Until next time, this is Chris Frisz, developing an aneurysm."

"event","You know, as much as I play them, I'm surprised that I don't write about video games more often.  So now, I will.  Just yesterday, I installed Sid Meier's <i>Pirates!</i> onto my laptop, and just began playing this morning.  I am so addicted to it now.  I find it very rare that a game can come out that has such an engaging premise, yet has such little storyline or structure.  They start you off with this bit about how your family was kidnapped by one Baron Raymondo, but you escaped their fate, and now you've come of age to begin adventuring and get them back.

Despite the aforementioned premise, you can completely ignore it if you like.  Didn't like your family in the first place?  Great!  You've got plenty of opportunity to go join up with the British, Dutch, French, or Spanish navys, and work with them to fight their enemies.  Or you can be a complete rogue, playing each countries hostilities off the others, or just screw any semblence of honor and attack everyone.  Oh, but say you do want to be a loyal subject?  You have the choice to merely attack ships of enemy nations in amazingly fun action-oriented sea battles, impede the transport of their goods and soldiers, attack enemy settlements in turn-based land wars, and even install a new governor from the country of your choosing.

War and battle not your thing?  There's a plethora of other things to do.  Various shady dealers in the taverns across the Caribbean will sell you bits of treasure maps, so that you can search them out and steal the wealth of others.  You can also turn the game into a micro-economy simulator, trading the various items between settlements based on supply and demand.  Among my favorite pastimes is wooing governors' daughters by taking part in ballroom dancing, which equates to a rhythm-based game of Simon Says.  Said governors' daughters will then give you helpful information regarding the evil Baron Raymondo, tell you the whereabouts of criminals of the crown that can garner you a hefty reward, or give you invaluable gifts for use on your travels.

I know, I know.  I've basically just spent two to two-and-a-half paragraphs hyping the game as though I was getting paid to do it (::thanks Firaxis as they hand over one of those novelty bags of money with the '$' symbol on the side::).  It's really, super fun though.  Right now, I'm playing as the pirate Christopher, a Count in the British Navy, devoting my time and efforts to amassing pirate armies in order to weed out the evil Spanish empire from the islands.  It's a great time.  So...yeah, if I'm hard to talk to for a while, you know what I'm doing.  Until next time, this is Chris Frisz, a walking, talking advertisement."

"event","Ok, I'm going to do this on here, because I don't think there's a forum here at IU that I can do it on.  I can barely stand my roommate anymore.  I'm definitely the saint of this relationship.  The first problem came in that he <i>loves</i> tv.  He has it on <i>all the time</i>.  I haven't watched more than an hour and a half of tv in one sitting since I got here, and those times have been very social events with Nate and Alex.  He even has to have it on when we're going to sleep, which I've come to deal with, but it's definitely been a sacrifice.

Second (which he's doing right now), he plays his music on his laptop really loud.  Not only that, but he sings.  Now, I'm fine with singing, because as many of you may know, I do it as well.  The thing is that he continues singing the same song after it's been over for quite some time.  It's uncomfortably weird, and I'm not usually a person who is made uncomfortable by weird things.

Thirdly, he's a hermit.  If he's not in class, which seems like all the damn time, even though he claims to have seventeen credit hours, he's sitting in the room, door closed, blinds shut, and he's on his bed IMing and playing texas hold 'em.  Most of that doesn't bother me, except that I like to have light in the room, so I would like the blinds open.  Also, I'm a creature of the people, so it <i>really</i> bothers me that he wants the door shut all the time.  I love to have people just randomly come in and visit me.  It totally makes the college experience.  The problem is that now we have an air conditioner, and he's even worse about having the door closed now that he wants to keep the air in here.  It's maddening.

Lastly, it smells like straight shit in here.  Ryan claims he was never a party-er in high school, but since I've been here, he's gone and gotten drunk twice.  The <i>first</i> week of classes isn't even over yet!  Last night he went to visit his friends at a frat, and didn't come back (even though he said he was going to be back by midnight).  He finally wandered in around noon today, shut off the lights, and sat in bed all day.  Oh, and apparently he vomited all over his clothes, and he has failed to take care of it.  This room smells <i>awful</i>.  

Now, I know that many of you reading this are probably saying, ""Oh, you just need to actually talk to him about these things, instead of just letting things build up and hold stuff against him.""  Normally, you'd be right.  The problem is, I have talked to him about it.  At least the more immediate things, such as the door issue and the frickin smell.  He's kind of belligerent about me saying something, which is dumb.  Anywho, I just thought that you guys might like to know.  Until next time, this is Chris Frisz, weathering the roommate life."

This residence hall (not dorm, mind you) is meant for me.  This major is meant for me.  And even though I was worried about meeting people, surprise, surprise, when I try, I meet people.  Like just last night, I came in at about 12:30 from jamming with Justin Cruz on some Fall Out Boy (which I'm really excited about), and I was about to walk into my room, when the two guys across the hall, Nate (a sophomore) and Isaac (I'm not sure which year), started talking to me.  I talked to the both of them for about an hour.  They really genuinely seemed to have fun just talking to me.  They're both really fun guys, and Nate has friends around that engage in the same kind of weird humor that my friends in high school did.

I think this is so cool, because as of Tuesday I hadn't thought out how the ""living on campus"" part of college was going to be.  I was really worried that I wouldn't make friends and be a loser or something, but it definitely hasn't worked out that way. I just love this place already.

Then someone with similar computing needs informed me that I would need much more computer than I had expected, and that was just for school/major needs.  Great.  That means approximately $300-$450 more for my laptop.  Don't worry, kids, I'm not going to burden my parents like that; I plan on footing the cost for the additional upgrades.

On top of that, I'm anxiously awaiting the Worldwide Developers' Conference, at which Steve Jobs will make announcements about updates and new Apple products.  I just read an article saying that as of ::looks at watch:: today, Intel is shipping their new Core 2 Duo ""Merom"" chips, which are 20% faster at the same clock speeds as the current generation Core Due ""Yonah"" processors.  Since Intel and Apple are now bosom buddies like none other, our favorite line of professional laptops is almost definitely getting some Merom packed in soon.  I don't know about you, but that gets my motor running.  

For those of you who didn't follow or didn't care about that last bit, that means that Apple will be making an update to the MacBook Pro line.  So for the same price as right now, there will be a considerable performance increase.  Hot dog.  Without even trying, I might still be able to play games on this bad boy.

I actually got to stay home for two days after I got home from that, but then came Cara's and my trip to Cincy to see the Goo Goo Dolls on Wednesday and then go to Kings Island on Thursday.  That was an amazing trip.  I don't think I'll stop raving about the Goo Goo Dolls for, oh, years because of it.  Kings Island was also amazing, except I'm still mad that I didn't get my discount.

I have returned from the confusing land of the northwest with a buttload of materials, 17 credit hours scheduled, and a new card in my wallet with a stupid picture of me on the front.  It has that wonderful ""deer in the headlights"" look going on because I had just come from registration and about a million instruction thrown at me in like...6 seconds.  But I digress...

Exciting happenings include the fact that I already found jam buddies for when fall comes.  Secondly, the practice Calc questions finally clicked and I was able to solve them all.  As a result of my studying, I got 21 out of 24 questions correct on the placement exam.  That automatically exempted me from Calc I, so I get to take honors Calc II with a professor that everybody says is amazing.  

I also officially declared a double major in Informatics and Biology, so I'm in entry level courses for both.  Oh, and with information provided by a representative from the Honors College about a possible new major, I might change that Biology to Human Biology.  So in addition to my introductory courses and Monday-Friday Calculus (yes!!), I also have an eight-week seminar and an intermediate guitar class, bringing me to seventeen credit hours for the semester.

I've also come to a number of decisions since I left for orientation.  One is that I'm going to plan to study abroad, probably either in England or Israel.  Another is that I believe I'm going to begin studying modern Hebrew.  I only tested out the introductory French course, and while I had some fun in French as well as frustration while I was in high school, I don't think it's for me.  I also want to join at least a couple of clubs, and I want to take part in the student government in my residence hall.  I never felt like I did enough to be involved while I was in high school, and I'm not as likely to bash SHS as number of people, but I think I'm going to be much more proud of the places I'm going to be while I'm at IU, so I want to get involved early and feel like I'm doing something.

On a kind of random note, just because I wanted to include this, I'm not really impressed with a lot of the incoming freshmen that I met during the last few days.  I'm not saying that I think I'm better than most or all of them, but the whole time I was there I felt a completely high school mentality.  I did, however, notice how well I connected with the orientation leaders (who were almost all sophomores/juniors) and my advisor, Dr. Gubar.  I know a lot of people have told me that college is a changing experience for everybody who does it right, and I can definitely see that now.  I'm excited to go through it and see others go through it, too.

So, in closing (and the audience releases a sigh of relief), I'm really excited for when Fall finally comes.  I know that Mr. Wright and Mr. Bagwell told me a number of times that I was going to love Bloomington, and now I really know what they were talking about.  I really think I've found the place I'm supposed to go, and it's a good feeling.  Until next time, this is Chris Frisz, much closer to being a real college kid."

I need to take placement exams tonight, which gives me the option of beginning at 6:45 or 7:45, of which I'm opting for the latter.  That means I should leave Scottsburg by 5:00 to give myself two hours to get there plus some change for getting lost (On the IU campus, not really on the way).

I'm also kind of nervous about meeting people tonight.  I'm afraid they'll be a lot cooler and a  lot smarter than me.

It's an episode where an 18-year-old girl comes aboard the Enterprise as an intern, and it is soon found that she has Q powers.  With such a situation, the Q that we have all come to know and love shows up on the ship to test the girl.  The episode is still on, and at the part that I got up to write this, Q was explaining the nature of the Q.  He describes them as omnipotent, all-powerful beings that use their powers for whatever purpose they desire.

It was right about this time that I realized that the Q are Gene Roddenberry's commentary on the idea of God.  I might be a little behind schedule figuring it out just now, but I'm not going to lie, it makes me a little upset.  I feel somewhat insulted when I realize that one can believe that for my God to exist, He would have to be a spoiled, uncaring entity who cared for only His own pleasure and took joy in toying with the lives of humankind.

As my graduation money grows, I get more and more careful about spending any cash at all.

The only solution is for me to get an additional income.  

Therein lies my current frustration.  I've tried ask around and apply at the places where the work wouldn't absolutely drive me to suicide.  I'm not even being picky about wages at this point.  I just want <i>something</i> that will pay me, but nobody is answering.  The deli in town seemed to be a sure-fire thing, since they know my sister, who has spoken of me, and there being someone cutting their hours way back.  Then there was Circle K that had their ""now hiring"" sign out forever until very soon after I put in my application.  But no, I haven't heard back from either place.  I guess today I'll apply at Wal-Mart, even though I just saw one of the guys from my class who works there, and he had the end of a digit cut off while pushing carts.  ::shudders:: I heart my digits.

So...until someone hires me, I'm going to sit here and be useless.  It's not as exciting as it used to be, somehow.  Until next time, this is Chris Frisz, vegetating to death."

"event","I realized about twenty minutes ago that I haven't been on LJ for a while when I intended on starting this entry, but decided to catch up on everyone else's entries.  Oh, and I could swear that you hid some of those entries from me, Cara, there were like a jillion!  But anywho...

I originally got the idea to make this entry from a performance by JT Tunstall I saw on VH1.  The song was called ""Black Horse and the Cherry Tree,"" and the performance can be seen approximately <A HREF=""javascript:launchVspot('id=1524234');"">here</A>.  If you actually watch the performance, it is just <i>her</i> performing, but she's got the full sound of the song.  As it begins, she starts hitting the body of the guitar to a kind of bass ""thunk"" sound.  Then she mutes the strings and strums them for a different percussive sound.  When I first watched it, this was the point that I realized she was recording these sounds into a loop with the equipment she had.  Next, she recorded the tambourine into the loop.  The coolest part came next when she sang one set of background vocals, then the next for the loop.  After that, she started playing the singing.  It struck me how amazing that bit of one woman band-manship worked so well.  I rather enjoyed the song as well, but I was highly impressed with her performance ingenuity.  I've tried to do a good job in describing it, but all reading should really watch it and not just take my word for it.

So JT Tunstall was the reason that sparked this entry, but as I searched for the video on VH1.com, I ran across a live performance by the Goos somewhere in the vicinity of <A HREF=""http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/goo_goo_dolls/artist.jhtml?extPop=popVspot(1531822,86990)"">here.</A>  This again makes me excited to see them come July 12.  I will say, though, that this performance isn't the greatest.  I say this because I think there was something wrong with John's mouth/voice.  At times it sounded like his voice had been strained, and other times like he had a little novocaine or a few marbles in his mouth.  In other performances I've seen him do, he sings with much more pitch accuracy and with much more clarity.  Even with said problems, the songs they performed were really cool.  It demonstrated to me how even with the plethora of nuances that the Goos added to the songs on the new album, five guys on stage could reproduce the quality of the album recordings just as well live.  On top of that, their performace of ""Broadway"" was really cool, because they have a really awesome stage guitarist, and I enjoyed the full force of the John Rzeznik/Robby Takak duo.  It makes my heart happy to see a band that has been in the business for twenty years now that still obviously love to play like that.  It kinda makes me wanna skip college.  We'll see when I get there, though.  Until next time, this is Chris Frisz, a raving Goo Goo Dolls lunatic."

"event","As of 2:55 PM, I was done with all my high school classes.  All I have left is graduation practice and commencement on Friday, and then pick up my diploma on Tuesday, and then I'm no longer a student of Scottsburg High School.

First thing this morning, I took my French final.  I felt pretty confident with the whole thing.  Turns out I got a 100% on it.  I then took a Calculus final that I felt a little rushed on, but I was later informed that I, along with two other people, made the highest score of 36 out of 40.  The rest of the day wasn't very eventful, and I spent it signing Senior books and doing the little bit I had to finish my scrapbook for French.  All said and done, I had a 91% in French before the score for my final was put in, some kind of mid- to upper-90% score for Calculus, a 96% for PoliSci, and a 93.56% for Comp 2.  Nice to know I got straight 'A's for my final trimester.

It's such a weird feeling to know that I'm done.  My public school education is over now.  It's exciting and scary at the same time.  Now to see if I get a job this summer before I skip town.  I'm not sure how I feel right now.  I'm sure I'll post more as update warrants.  Until next time, this is Chris Frisz, a near-alumnus of SHS."

"event","Looking over my idea for this essay due tomorrow, I probably won't let anyone besides Routt read it.  It's such bullcrap that I'm sure that if anyone believed I thought this way, they would stop being my friends.  Also, it might attract an element that I'm not so keen on hanging out with.  Just thought I'd say that in case anyone is offended that I don't let them read the essay."

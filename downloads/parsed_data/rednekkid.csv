""These books are my friends.""

Reading Paul Theroux's <i>The Pillars of Hercules</i> for the first time (really enjoying all his travel books, but for some reason haven't read any of his fiction, somehow worried I won't like them and that'd tarnish my image of his travel books, great curmudgeon) and part of his Sicily story:

<hr />

He sat, surrounded by books, looking harassed, as though inspiration had just deserted him, or he had momentarily mislaid his lyric gift. He kept his hat on, as though it was his badge of authorship if not part of his uniform and he amazed me with his pedantry.

I said, ""So many books, doctor.""

""This is not many, "" he said, dismissing my question. ""I own lots more than these.""

""What sort of books are they?""

""They are not books."" He smiled at my ignorance.

""What are they?""

""They are my friends.""

To him this sort of excruciating exchange was sheer poetry.

Because I had to be Elizabeth in Chicago last night, I out Elizabethed every Elizabeth since and including the Elizabethan era, including her, and the concert was late getting out and there was Boxee to trash and... well I never made it to bed and left Chicago at 3AM to head towards Gary... What?

Anyways got to EFRC at 7AM eastern, parked, slid my seat flat, grabbed a blanket, put my hat over my face and listened to the quiet Indiana countryside, few birds.

And just as I was actually falling asleep, the lions all ROARED. 

ROARED to sleep by lions!

There are literally no words in the English language to describe how cool this is.

More on today later it was awesome, falling asleep. But I started the day by being ROARED to sleep by lions."

"event","1998: The 3 wins The Daytona 500 after 20 years of trying.

2001: In the most improbable event in the history of the universe, The 3 is killed in the last turn of the last lap of The Daytona 500 while running third behind two cars he owns (one is his son).

2004: The 3's son wins The Daytona 500 for the first time.

2007: By less than a foot Harvick! wins The Daytona 500 for the first time in The 3's (renumbered) car on a last lap pass while the field wrecks behind him, his teammate crosses the line upside down and on fire.

2010: 2 laps to go, final restart: Harvick! leads in The 3's (renumbered) car, McMurray is second in The 3's company car, The 3's son is 10th. In one lap Jr. moves from 10th to second behind McMurray who holds off Jr. at the line for his first Daytona 500 win while Jeffy Gordon wrecks the field behind them.

No idea what crazy-ass thing will happen in 2013, but I can't wait.

Hell, I can't wait for 2011."

And the still less than half of the most: Earnhardt (34).

Fun, awesome, wild race. Cannot wait for tomorrow."

"event","And (one of) today's story is him back in a full courtroom (he had been in a series of empty courtrooms with no other cases than his just so the transcripts could be censored more easily (his ex-common law wife was friends with all of the clerks, so this was easy for them to do) and every time he would start his testimony he would state that the courtroom was empty and thus the transcript was not to be relied on without witnesses, that showed them and he got moved back in with other cases).

State's Attorney: I don't think Mr. Zombie believes in the law.

Mr. Zombie: Aren't you supposed to be asking me questions?

SA: [pause] Mr. Zombie, do you believe in the law?

Mr. Zombie: Absolutely. For example, I believe in Murphy's Law which states that anything that can be screwed will be. As you are currently demonstrating.

Other than the prosecutor and the judge he said everyone including all the other attorneys burst out laughing, but that that was what cost him that case since the judge lost control of his courtroom. But it didn't matter, they were all out to get him and they would've found a some other way."

"event","...a female has deliberately hit me.

#1: A first grader at TOCKITEW's school Christmas party. I was running the dreidel game (not too bad after I implemented my own rake, and since the house = me, the entire cut was MINE) and while asking each player's name I got to the girl who normally sits next to TOCKITEW and thus I had seen her name plate.

jrh: And your name is Ralph, right?

Ralph: No. Why ever would you say that?

jrh: Aren't you named after Ralph Lauren?

Lauren: [hits jrh]

They were playing for M&Ms, though they were to return all of them at the end of the game. Unsurprisingly there were complaints over this so I always told them they could have one or two but they /had/ to keep that quiet. And for the (if non-annoying) bigger complainers even allowed THREE, but they really had to be /silent/ about THAT. Ralph held her take (about 10 or so) out in her outstretched hand then stuffed them all in her mouth at once and smiled an M&M-eating grin until finished. Then walked off to the next table.

#2: Even though I was working from home I had to run into town this afternoon after The Counter-Culture Intransigent was claiming far more ignorance on the phone than I thought she had and in the process of fixing her machine she hit me! Out of the blue. But, she gave me festively-boxed home-baked holiday cookies, which was the real reason for the seeming ignorance. But that doesn't make up for the extreme physical workplace violence."

"event","So, the just-shows-up-out-of-the-blue-when-he-needs-money-as-he-has-no-regular-job-and-does-a-great-job-on-absolute-shit-work-or-whatever worker that I really like just 'cause and he gets annoying things done and he seems to like me, I'm guessing largely because I overpay him (on the scale of what others pay, he'll literally take any amount I suggest... he always wears a t-shirt that says I'VE DONE WITH SO LITTLE FOR SO LONG I NO LONGER NEED ANYTHING), showed up this morning and it was wonderful. He's a Constitutional Scholar! So he sets the judge on edge every time he's in court because he immediately warns the judge he knows about the ""legal canyons"" the judge is bound by and that really sets them off because now the court can't just push him around. Also, the legal system is as illegal as the post office, both private institutions setup solely to rob money from everyone since the country has been in Chapter 11 since Eisenhower was in his wheelchair. ""Roosevelt?"" ""Yeah, that one.""

Oh, and all city ordinances are unconstitutional, just never plead guilty or you'll set a legal precedent screwing all your neighbors as it is now LAW. Watch those precedents! Your driver's licenses are also unconstitutional but you signed your rights away getting your learner's permit in driver's ed because you're too young to know better. That's how they get you.

And legal marriage licenses were only created to prevent interracial marriages. Before that, they were only an ""in the eyes of God thing"".

He is self-admittedly ""too smart for [his] own good"" but an unexpectedly fun hour long conversation in the driveway when I really needed some absurd fun."

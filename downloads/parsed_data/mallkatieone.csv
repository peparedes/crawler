"event","Hey, so I didn't get paid this week like I was planning on... My dad's coming up though and that should be excitig I guess... Maybe I'll start shopping for my room here pretty soon or I'm just going to splurge. I hope your having fun at camp Aubrey! Actually you're probably back already. I hope you had fun. So I went to the eye doctors because I got an allergic reaction to something in my eye. It turned yellow and orange and my eye looked like it was going to pop out of my head and then my face started to swell up like a balloon. I thought my mom was going to barf when she saw it! It was hilarious. Well, I went and he said that it was normal for eyes to do that and the swelling would go down soon. Then a few hours later it was fine... So, yeah. I hope everyone has a nice holiday weekend...

New thing to learn about me...

I HATE fireworks.

I had fun at your house Aubrey and I hope to see you again."

"event","So I got my first paycheck.... it's pretty exciting!!!!!! I get paid $6.00 an hour... my first paycheck only covered my first week (involving only two days) and I got $100. My Mom is letting me get a checking account, a debit card, and a credit card.... She wants me to learn how to use them before I get old and broke like my brothers.... So for my job I trade off and on between working two days and three days... It's nice. this old lady is paying me to clean her house... She just got her kitchen remodeled and she needs someone to ""spice it up a bit with some cleaning""... I feel like this is portraying my future of becoming a maid, suck. Who thinks I'm going to become a stay at home mom and if you do think that, why? Also, will I ever get married or divorced?

I'm sorry that you leave in two days Aubrey, Katy Po we'll have to get together soon! Marybeth, I'll call you???"

Katy Po why did you call me today? Is there an emergency? I'll call you when I get home...

Aubrey, when does your camp start and when does it end? You know what I need... mocha frappachino with an extra shot of expresso and extra chocolate syrup! YUMMMMM.... But I can't. 
Call me and we'll do brunch!

Good luck at your game marybeth!"

"event","It's been a long day, and I mean A LONG DAY! Anyways, Marybeth, I don't believe it's only up to me now... I can't mend something that's broken alone... Honestly, I know you called and I know we tried to do things and they never seem to work out, but is it really honestly all my fault? Just because I have a life and don't sit at home to wait on the phone doesn't mean I don't want to talk to you... I'm busy. No, I don't sit at home all day and watch movies, I have a job, I have plans, I have something going on that I can't tell you... ect. Do you understand? You're busy too... Maybe, just maybe this is how it's supposed to be. I don't want to fight with you like this, although I don't really consider this fighting because I don't have anything mean to say to you but... tension...the tension is growing... TENSION! That was stupid... Well, Marybeth, what to say to you... I don't know. I read your live journal and noticed little things with my name written all over them (figuratively, not literally) and then I realized you were ticked at me and I wasn't going to just ignore you all summer to be mad or upset with you in the fall... Do you understand why I started this at all? Well, I didn't really start this I am trying to kind of end this little fight... It had to happen sooner or later right? I don't know... I'll talk to you all later I suppose...

Aubrey- next weekend?"

"event","Mission complete, we made it out without being caught... we're so good at this. Anyway I'm sorry Marybeth but it is true as much as I still want to be your best friend we're starting to realize it isn't going too well and I am not exactly sure how to fix it at this point.. You know? I want to be your friend and I want to be there for you and everything but how? We've dug ourselves holes and now we can't seem to escape... Is that a bad analogy? It seems worn and overused... oh well. Anyway I'm so excited! I finally got a job and I'm happy! I need the money right now, I'm in over my head... Thanks Becca I appreciate you saying all of that stuff...You're kind."

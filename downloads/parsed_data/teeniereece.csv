"event","Andrew got off work today at 4:30 as usual.  And being Wednesday, I went with him to pick up his paycheck and then cash it - as usual.  So right after that we go to McDonald's with my family (well, mom, ericka, kara, cousin amanda).  I'm thinkin', okay... this could be a good thing right?  Wrong.  We get there, not 2 minutes after everyone is sitting down, kara starts it again.  She blows a straw wrapper at Andrew, and then dares him to throw a fry at her.  Well duh, he will.  She knew this.  So he does and they end up being themselves and doing their thing.  Well eventually Andrew is just like Kara, shut up and knock it off, this is getting old.  She doesn't - she just stares at him and is super snotty and so he gets up and walks away.  I am thoroughly pissed off by then.  Kara yells at me saying I only yell at her and tell her to stop when even mom said ""Carisa told him to stop too!"".  Well then kara just brings up all this crap from the past and yeah.  UGH I was pissed.  But anyways, I ended up driving home...  Andrew has to leave right away so he gets into his car and I ask him if I can have a hug or something, and he's like but I have to go.  And then I'm like fine, whatever... so then Miss Thing comes up to the car (Kara by the way) and tells him something which I can't hear and he rolls up the window so I can't hear them talking.... and he's sitting there and they're talking for like a minute... and yet I can't even get a hug.... UGH... I am in SUCH a bad mood right now.

"event","I've been working on a ""wizard robe"" looking thing for Andrew... he bought all the fabric and everything, but I get to make it. lol, he spent over $55 on the stuff. lol. But I like doing stuff for him.  Makes me feel good.  Plus he likes it too. lol.

We went to dinner with his parents tonight. It went okay.  She's one of those types of people who ... if the do something for you like make dinner and spend time on something, they almost need you to want to eat it and love it or they feel bad type of thing.  So I always try her desserts and dinners and stuff when she invites me over. lol.  Andrew doesn't always have the dessert, but I do.  I want her to like me!  Her food is awesome too! lol  After dinner, Andrew's little brother, Noah, and I jumped on the trampoline while Andrew talked to his parents.  It was pretty fun.  he's 6 years old. lol, he's a pretty cool little kid though - who is obviously Andrew's little brother. lol. it's written all over him.  :)

But I'm finally starting to get sleepy, and it's 2 in the morning.  Everyone else went to bed at 12. lol.  I haven't been able to sleep for about a month though.  It sucks. Cuz I hate sleeping in past 11.  Hate it.  But church is tomorrow morning, so I'll be up around 8 or 8:30. lol.  I'll be tired.  Oh well.

night everyone!

"event","I had my meeting with Mrs. Beilen this morning.  I won't be able to go PSEO until second semester, in the spring.  Which isn't too bad, I'm fine with that.  It's probably better anyway, because by then I will for sure have my license and mom and dad won't have to drive me there and back every day.  So it's a good thing.

As for the college thing... thanks to my GPA (3.590 as of now)and my ACT score (24), I will get this presidental scholarship or whatever ($1,750 to $5,000) and since dad is a pastor I will also get 10% off my tuition.  It isn't much, especially for how much it costs per year there, but it helps a lot. It's pretty cool.  I haven't applied for any other scholarships yet either... those two things are automatic.  So there's a chance for more..

Andrew and I will probably go out tonight.  We didn't go on our anniversary for certain reasons so we were planning on maybe going tonight.  Since it's payday!  lol.  I'm not sure what we'll do though.

Well I'm going to check up on my MySpace.com thingy.  TTYL.

"event","So yeah, it's been forever and a weekend since I updated this thing.  But I'm going to try to get back to doing this.  If anyone reads this...?  But anyways.

So I am scared now.  I have been planning on going post secondary this year... but now I don't know if this will work.  Because I didn't realize I had to take the placement test.  Well I knew, but no one told me when I had to take it.  And I guess it was supposed to be by June... two months ago.  Yeah... my mom is friends with a lady who works at RCTC doing that stuff that I'm wondering about, so mom is going to talk to her tomorrow and see what she can do about it. And then tomorrow morning I have a meeting with my guidance counselor about the whole thing and about my schedules and everything.  Hopefully everything works out.  I am praying so hard that it does.

This morning I was so sick... it sucked.  And Andrew called me and he was all worried and stuff.  It was so cute. :)  I felt better later so I changed and everything before he came over after work.  It's weird, I feel totally grungy and like crap when I'm wearing a tee-shirt and no socks or make-up even. lol. So I changed completely, brushed my hair... again..., brushed my teeth again, put on make up and put on socks. lol, then I felt much better. 

Yesterday was Andrew and my 10th anniversary. :) That's a long time!  But it's been awesome.  I love him.  So much.  

But I'm going to go.  I'll try to update this soon.  Instead of 5 months later.  lol.  Laters

Time to drink my cappucino!  :)

"event","I am SO happy that 3rd quarter is finally over!  But next quarter is going to suck more.  oh well - it's the last quarter and then it's SUMMER!  I hope I can have as many parties as I did last summer, it was so awesome, I just hope it's awesome this year too.

This weekend has the potential of being pretty boring.  The Arivett's are here for the weekend, but the kids are all boys who are all younger and Andrew is gone Friday, Saturday, and part of Sunday.. :(  So we'll see how this goes.

As short as this is... I think I'm done for the night. lol.  Night all!

"event","Wow.  This like whole month I have not stopped cleaning!  It has always been something I do when I'm stressed or upset or just pissed, but now it's like all I ever do and I still can't keep up with it!  I clean before I do my homework or anything anymore - it's insane.  My siblings never do their ""chore"" so I always have to do it for them or it won't get done... it's so annoying, and then I come back later and it's messy again.  GRR!  Mom is even paying me to do kara's chore (laundry).  She's paying me a dollar a load... so far I'm up to $15.  lol.

Mom and Dad let me stay home from school on Friday.  I was so happy.  I'm like never sick so I'm always at school.  When I'm overwhelmed or super stressed, mom lets me stay home sometimes.  Not all the time, but every great once in a while.  I needed that too, I was in a good mood for the whole day... well, until we were coming home from Brick and Amp around 11:30.  Then I cried.  But anyways, enough of that story.

Andrew and I have been great lately too, he's the one I can actually count on.  All the time.  

Mom and Dad left Friday morning (around 7:30 after taking my siblings to school) for Madison, Wisconson.  They went to this Canoecopia thing...? lol  I don't know.  But they get back tomorrow after church sometime.  It is pretty cool, because I can pretty much do whatever without plans, I am ""in charge"", and Kara is at Lori's all weekend.  Don't get me wrong... I love Kara.  But I can't do anything right by her - no matter how hard I try - so when she isn't around, I can't be wrong... so then I'm not the horrible big sister.  

*sigh*  well I have to finish cleaning... maybe I'll sleep tonight.  Who knows.  Night

I get to present my bipolar disorder project today.  joy!  lol.  i came home with no homework last night... didn't bring my bag with  me either and then I get home and I realize... I have a worksheet to do... so i get to do that before school... if Andrew comes.  lol.  He always comes later though.  It's alright.  Lately I don't mind.  Nothing to do before school anyway except pretend like I'm doing something in my locker.  So ya know.  yesterday was a pretty productive day for me.  At least at home.  I did three people's chore's... in an hour and a half - plus some.  lol, so yeah.. i was bored.  Well I'm going to go... I don't have anything to say.  See ya!

"event","So these past couple weeks have NOT been enjoyable.  In some ways they have been, but overall they haven't.  Okay... I take that back.  In just about one way.  I won't get into that though, I don't need to.  

I got my room painted and so I had to take EVERYTHING out of my room... which was really annoying to have to sleep in a room with nothing in it but a bed.  lol.  I got it painted while I was at school Thursday and it's awesome, I love it!  But it was a day or two before I moved stuff in, and I'm still not fully unpacked yet and it's grr-worthy.  Daddy has to put my TV in and stuff so I have to wait for that before most things will get done.

Most things, I will say... are really good in my life.  It's just that the bad things seem to balance with the more and better good things.  If that makes sense.  I'm so happy for the people who are here with me right now... even if some of them won't be later, I'm glad I have them right now.  I need all my friends all the time lately.  

One of the hardest things to deal with right now is the fact that Andrew is going to enlist for the Navy.  Even though he isn't 100% sure, it's very hard.  I want him to follow his dreams though, I love him too much to keep him from doing that.  God has been giving me peace though.  Thank you!

Guys, keep thinking of me and praying for me.  I need you guys all the time... to talk or just to hang out with and do nothing.  I greatly appreciate you all so much.  Don't give up on me over little things... okay?

"event","Hey.  I love early outs.  I came home and slept.  That was a good thing.  I slept in a weird position too - completely curled up on my side with one arm covering my head.  Strange... yet comfortable and secluded.  I wanted to sleep the week away but that didn't work.  

Yeah, my day basically sucked though, other than the early out part.  Like really sucked.  I feel totally and completely betrayed.  I don't know what I did or why people are doing this to me.  I am utterly confused about this.  I don't know what to do and I'm scared.  I almost lost something very close to me, and I feel that I have lost another.  I feel completely helpless.  I hate these feelings.  Andrew and Erik stopped over earlier, right after I had waken up - I was still in bed though.  (Don't worry, I slept in my clothes, fully dressed, lol)  We talked about some stuff which was pretty cool... and I needed it.  Then I went over to Andrew's a while later and we talked and stuff.  It was one of those up and down moments - but it was needed and overall ""good"" too.  I can tell that there are going to be some hard struggles to work through with certain circumstances around us.  It's going to be really difficult... but we'll make it.  I thank God that I'm still alive and that I have that someone to help me through it.  Many people don't realize how supportive and everything he is.  

I am kind of emotionally drained right now, so I'm going to go... I am really going to need this Brick and Amp tonight.  I'll have to talk to some people - don't worry certain people, I won't let anything ""leak"" okay?  Later  God please help me!

Sorry to those of you who I may be sounding too uppity.  :(  I don't mean too.  But yeah, I had a good yesterday.  And I also had an awesome today - it's my 4 month anniversary.  Pretty sweet! heehee aaahhh lol, nvm.  Ignore that if you'd like.

You know what I need to do right now?  I need to go work out or something.  ;) no I'm kidding, but I do... like crunches and push-ups kind of thing.  I did last night and Sunday night.  I should tonight too.  I guess it's not good for you to work out right before you go to bed, but that's like the only time I ever feel like it.  lol, oh well.  Bummer for me.  Especially since I've had chocolate and stuff in the past couple days, lol.  Can't be good.

Yesterday was so cool, starting the day with a school delay is always good.  My tests went very, very well.  Homework wasn't too heavy, and it was just a good day!  It was cool, I had nothing to complain about.  lol, maybe school isn't so bad, I mean I do get to talk to my friends and everything, when I usually don't get to any other time.  Except for instant messaging, I rarely talk to most people outside of school.  Like Tani, Marianne, Zach, or Andy... or just about anyone.  Plus, I talk to most people in my grade, not all, but a lot, at least a little bit, and school's the only time I get to.  So it's not a bad thing I guess.  You know... after high school is starting to scare me.  There are some things i want to do, but I don't know if I'm ready.  I mean college for one thing, marriage... I mean wow.  I'm only 16 right now and I'm trying to plan my whole life.  What if I mess up?  What if I make the wrong decisions?  What would that do to me?  I mean... would that ruin my whole life or would it just change it a little bit but still be good?  And that kind of depends on what decision it is...  ugh... I'm scared.  And who will I still talk to after high school?  I'll probably lose the friends I have...  And... even though I still feel like my friendships are conditional instead of unconditional, I don't want to lose what I finally have.  I NEED to stop thinking.  Oh, I know what I need!  I need a party.  I want to invite like EVERYONE!  I would this weekend but I don't know if it's too late of notice.  Maybe not.  Who knows.  I don't know what we'd do, but I just want to have people here, around me, and just hang out, not necessarily doing anything in particular... just... ""chill"".  I'll think about it.  I just don't want fights to erupt like they usually do - I'm cursed with that.  grr.

I'm going to go though - e-mail needs to be checked.  See ya!

"event","It's been interesting.  I went over to Andrew's yesterday for a little bit after school, until he had to pick up Noah.  Then he called me later and we talked a little bit.  He and I were both upset about what my dad had said the other night (which I won't get into) so we were kind of half talking about that.  He stopped over later, when he got home from eating out with his family and stuff and we had just pulled in the driveway.  So we talked outside for a little bit and he apologized for a couple things and everything, and I must say - he was being very understanding and mature about the whole thing, just everything.  The situation itself I won't explain. but yeah, then he came inside to use the phone and ended up talking to mom.  After he left, mom, dad, and I talked for a little while.  That wasn't too bad.  So overall, even though it was a tough night, it was a good thing too.  

Andy came over a little bit later and we talked about a lot, for a long time.  That was pretty cool.  Before he left, we were talking about some things that I can totally understand and relate too, more than I think he thinks I can.  That was a confusing sentence, lol.

But yesterday, while I was over at Andrew's, I about started crying so hard.  It wasn't cool.  Someone very close to me isn't doing too well, health wise I guess, and I'm scared to death.  I was bawling Thursday night, and then Andrew called while I was still crying so I talked to him about it and he can relate 100%, so that helped.  And I talked to him about it again yesterday too.  He's just awesome to talk to - especially when I know he'll always be there for me.  I love you Andrew.

But I better go, I might even do some homework... before 10:00 Sunday night. lol.  See ya.  Pray for me please!

I left after 3rd hour with Kami and went into Rochester to take my permit test (finally!).  I PASSED!  Oh man, I was ecstatic!  It isn't in my possession yet though, because I went with Kami so mom or dad weren't able to sign it.  They kept all my paper work though and then we can come in soon and mom or dad can sign it, and THEN I get it.  :) I am so happy. After I took it (I got 5 wrong lol but they were stupid reasons, I just didn't read it right or I didn't read all the answers or something), I went up to the desk thing and Kami was in the lobby area and I looked at her and I'm like ""Kami!"" and gave her a thumbs up and she's like ""You passed!  YAY!"" But I had to go fill stuff out.  

Then we left and we ran to the Christian book store - Kami had to get a thing or two.  And then we went to Target and picked up my mom's prescription receit... then to Walmart to return my pants that I hated. lol.  And oh, I got a Caribou Coffee!  :)  To celebrate. lol. 

I wanted to go over to Andrew's, but he had to go somewhere so he wasn't home when I got home.  Hopefully I get to see him tonight.

Brandy talked to me online today.  That was kind of weird.  Not bad, but weird.  I haven't talked to Brett since like May and her since April or something, IF I even talked to her.  That was weird.  But yeah.  I guess Brett's changed a lot.  I guess whatever works for him.  lol.  But I have my guy now, so I'm not like ""oh man"" or anything, LOL.  Don't worry Andrew.  Brett and I are barely friends anymore... we never talk... weirdness.

Andrew - I love you and hope to see you tonight!  *muah* xoxox

The most interesting, for me at least, was seeing Andrew's ex Kelly there.  That was crazy.  Andrew wasn't feeling good and by the time he got home, around 10:30, he had a fever... poor guy.  I went over there to see him today, his whole family is like worried about me getting sick, but I could really care less. I can't even remember the last time I was sick so whatever.  Kami stayed the night last night.  Amanda was going to but... she changed her mind I guess.  Which sucked.  That's why I went to the movie, I came home and Kara told me that Amanda called to say she wasn't going to come over anymore so I just went to the movie.  *sigh* Doesn't surprise me though...

Today was church, obviously, and that was okay.  I had nursery but there weren't any kids ... but I stayed down there anyway cuz I would have fallen asleep during the sermon. lol.  Aaron stayed down tehre with me too.  

Mom is thinking I should take med's now... for depression.  We'll see how that goes.  Great.

I have laundry to do but Kara never got the stuff out of the dryer so that stuff isn't done yet and it's already 10:00, so I'll be up waiting for that.  I haven't been able to sleep all week, it's really pissing me off cuz I've been dead tired for so long.  And I just want to SCREAM!!!  I NEED my girls day out tomorrow - thank you Amanda.  Wow, i need it.  

I still don't feel like I belong to anything... or really anywhere.  I know I belong to someone, just not to something.  Since I quit karate and I have no job... I feel like... unproductive and stuff.  I don't like it.  I need to be busy, I feel more needed and more important.  I should ask Ericka and Kara if I can clean the church occassionally.  I feel important when I'm doing something like that.  I don't know.  I'm weird that way.  Plus it's $32 for four hours.  Not too bad.  Plus it's cool, cuz I can act like a total dork, and no one is there to see me!  lol.

Andrew - you're so awesome.  I love you so much, and I'm glad I'm yours forever.  Thank you for loving me for me.  I won't let you go.  I love you!  Unconditionally!

"event","I am so ecstatic about the whole no school thing.  Like wow.  Nobody called me this morning though... usually Amanda calls me... or Andrew.  But nobody did... :(.  Yeah, I've been like depressed lately.  Maybe not so much depressed as just down.  But I don't know why.  It's really frustrating, because if I don't know what's causing it, I feel totally helpless.  It sucks.  I think school is a major factor, with so many tests and make up and everything.  Oh, and I'm currently not in karate anymore.  It's just stressing me out so much and it's really frustrating me cuz I can't remember it very well.  I always have too much on my mind to concentrate that much - I lose track of what I'm doing.  I think I'll join again next session (in the fall), but that's still a decision I have to make.

I am also unemployed.  Most of you know that, but it's been a while since I've updated and so I'm putting it in here.  It really pissed me off too - mainly just because I had to work New Years Eve and I find out THAT NIGHT that it was the last night I'd be working.  And then they let me off at 7:00.  So I made like what?  Ten bucks?  Woo flippin hoo.  And it isn't just the fact that I was laid off (yes, I was laid off, not fired), but it was the fact that they quit on me, I wanted to be the one to quit.  But I guess ""store went out of business"" will look better on my next applications to who knows where.  Jeff just really pisses me off though.  Wow.  So I'm glad I'm done working there, but I'm mad cuz I have no source of income now.  He wasn't that nice to me - he was constantly picking at me, and even my dad.  I mean, picking at me is fine once in a while, although he went overboard many times... but why did he pick at my dad?  I mean seriously...  That's just too far.  So my dad's a pastor!  That doesn't mean I don't do certain things just because of my daddy.  I do things/don't do things for ME.  I don't do drugs or smoke or drink because I don't want to.  I have had many chances to do either one of those - it's me that says no, not my dad.  I know some people don't believe that, like I've been brainwashed or something.  Sorry people, I'm different.  Grr.

And now I'm done whining.  Later all.

Anyways.  So it's been a good month and 3 weeks.  :)  Yeah, it's Andrew and my two month next Wednesday!  How awesome!?  Wayness.  

Right now I am chillin... just drinking some caffeine free mt. dew and eating a little bit of mom's sugar free, fat free eclair type stuff. lol.  It's yummy.  I would normally, as every other day, be at Andrew's or he would be here, buuuuuttttt... he and Matt (Schimek) went into Rochester to buy my present! :)  As of right now I know what I'm getting him, but I don't know.  I have this idea but I don't know if it will work, or if I can find the store-bought portion of it.  So I don't know.  Ooh!  I just thought of something else.  Don't know if it will work either though. lol.  oh well.  So yeah, I can't wait until Friday.  Should be fuuuunnnn!  :)  

I have karate tonight... I'm kind of scared to go.  We didn't go last week because testing was going on and I wasn't going to test, either was Aaron or Andrew.  And the week before that we had to skip because we left early Wed. morning for Illinois so we had stuff to do.  *sigh*  oh well.  Crap!  I gotta study that stuff.  Gotta go!  Byes!

"event","Hey.  Happy Thanksgiving to you all!  I hope everyone had a great one.  I had a double holiday today, lol, Thanksgiving and Christmas with my mom's side of the family.  It was pretty cool.  I really do have a lot to be thankful for.  I wish my grandparents still did the ""go around the table and say a few things you're thankful for"" thing, but they don't.  I've always liked to do that for some reason.  I have a great family, even though I sometimes just need to get away from them;  awesome friends who are always there for me; the bestest boyfriend - I love you!!;  my needs are met, even though I don't always get the luxuries some people get, I feel blessed;  a pretty good school, better than some I guess, lol, at least I'm getting an education, and I have that right, unlike many people outside the U.S.;  good health;  freedoms; wow, I could go on and on.  But I won't.  :)  

Yeah, we left Wednesday (around 12:30) afternoon to go to Illinois to spend Thanksgiving and early Christmas with the Ledbetter fam.  We stopped at Andrew's house so I could say goodbye and get my letter :) and dad talked to Jamie for a little bit.  We then stopped by the church so Ericka could get her CD's.  After that we went to Burger King for lunch and coincidentally (honestly) Andrew and his family came in for lunch too.  After lunch we left for the wonderful 5 hour drive.  Yay!  Well that was loads of fun if you could imagine being in a van with my siblings for that long. lol.  I read with my headphones on the whole time.  Hopefully my batteries in my CD player don't die before we leave Saturday morning or I will go insane.  

Today's Christmas thingy was pretty cool.  I gave Gramma and Grampa the calligraphy scroll I made, they seemed to like it.  I got 3 CD's, a couple candles (one of the scents is CHERRY!!!!), a gift card for Target, and some other littler stuff.  It was cool.

I called Andrew around 9:10, cuz Grampa has free minutes on his cell phone after 9:00, and we talked for one hour and 22 minutes. lol.  Kerry and I beat up on each other for a while too.  that was interesting.  I could totally kick his, and Tim's, butt if I wanted too, and if he didn't beat me while I was on the phone. lol, cheater.  Grampa and Andrew talked on the phone for a couple minutes too, LOL.  Hopefully I didn't have a reason to be embarrased or anything.

And now I'm in the hotel room in Illinois on my daddy's laptop.  :)  And it's 1:00 in the morning and I'm getting sleepy so I am going to go now!  See you laters!

I like all my other classes too, except World Cultures... Hegerle's teaching format sucks.  Grr.  Oh well.  It won't kill me.  :)  You know what's pretty cool?  It's crazy, but I realized... why waste your life being upset about everything... especially things you cannot control.  Just go with the flow, or, in some cases, go against the flow.  Cuz if you can't help something... you can't help it, no matter what you do.  Deal!  lol.  My life right now, is going really well.  And I'm scared that it's just going too well, and that something bad is going to happen... but I'm not going to worry about it.  

Andrew and I have been together for one month and five days so far.  :)  I love you Andrew!  And we've been with each other every day.  Literally.  It's pretty cool.  And the weird thing - he's the one person that I can be around for that long and not get annoyed or get sick of him.  At least that I've experienced.  ;) (That's a winky face...)  Yeah, so it's a good thing.  It's also cool how my parents like him a lot.  And, as far as I know, he likes them.  So it's cool that they get along pretty well.  so yeah, as you can see, I'm pretty happy.  Thanks babe!  :)

I want to have a ""party"" soon.  But I can't.  lol.  Not super soon anyways.  Cuz next week I'm in Illinois for Thanksgiving/Christmas.  Wow am I glad it's only a two day week of school!!!  I have a feeling I'll get a crap load of homework.  yay.  Oh well!  Sometimes homework isn't too satanic.  lol.  I'm gonna miss a special someone while I'm in IL though.  I'll have to use Granpa's cell phone while I'm down there, since he has the free night/weekend minutes.  I'll have to use some of them!  :)  And I'm sure I'll bring a notebook to write notes and stuff in. lol.  I'm sure I'll be interrogated by my family once I'm down there.

"event","I haven't updated in a long time Wow. Lets catch up here. A lot has happened since my last entry but at the same time, not a whole lot. I don't really remember a whole lot of last week though. I haven't been able to think much lately. 

A certain someone and I aren't talking anymore though, I'm supposedly a racist who makes everyone else feel inferior to me, just because I am a Christian. Whatever. And I guess I'm the one who ""ended the friendship"". Tough luck. I'm sorry, but I'm sick of putting up with crap like that, friendships aren't 90/10, they're 50/50. Deal with it - that's how it is: I won't be the only one who makes the effort to talk or anything. So yeah, we aren't talking anymore. Technically, he's the one not talking anymore, because I've tried to talk to him and say hi and stuff but he'll like turn around and totally ignore me. Oh, and my FAVORITE diss: coming over to MY house and talking to my younger sister for two hours and then going dead silent when I get closer to them. And both my sister and he look at me, look at each other and wait for me to leave before they continue their little conversation. Another thing I loved was the fact that he flippin' calls my house asking my other sister if he can borrow something, which happened to be mine, she says ""you'll have to ask Carisa"" so he says ""well forget it then, I'm not talking to her"". Yeah, that's mature. 

Another thing that happened on... Friday... is I officially have a boyfriend now - Andrew Iverson. :) He's over at my house like every day too. I don't hate it. We talked on the phone last night for like two and a half hours. And then Friday night, he walked to Country to walk home with me after work and then he hung out at my house until two in the morning. That was fun, we watched um... School Of Rock. Good movie. I fell asleep on him too, lol. We did the same thing Saturday night, lol. And I've had his sweatshirt since Friday I think. Too bad for him. lol, jk. Oh, and I think it was Saturday night, we did the pencil test. It tells you how many kids you're going to have and if they're boy or girl and in what order. It's cool and really creepy. But anyways, so we did that on Andrew and I and it was SOOOO creepy - we had the same thing. And it works in a way, because it was right with my mom and it was right with Heather (friend of my mom's), lol. It's so weird. So yeah, that was kind of embarrassing in a way I guess. Especially since at church, my mom was introducing him to people as her son in law. lol. It was pretty funny. 

I so can't wait until Wednesday, oh my goodness. It's going to kick butt. I wish my sister wasn't so selfish though... If she would just ride with her friend, then it would work out, but noooooo. But yeah, it's going to be fun though, even if I end up riding with people I don't want to ride with, which will probably happen, unless Amanda drives. We're going to a Sanctus Real concert in Rochester. It's going to be awesome!!!!! And then Thursday I'm FINALLY going to go see Napolean Dynamite. YAY! And then Friday morning I leave for Chicago until Sunday afternoon. So my MEA weekend is full of fun. lol I can't wait. And I don't work at all this week, so that's cool too, except for the no money part of it. And I'm thinking of pulling a late, late, late nighter/all nighter on Tuesday night. I might invite some people over to watch movies and hang out and stuff. Maybe. I don't know. It's so crazy, I have had a really good past couple weeks, and I don't really know why. Nothing too bad has gone wrong, and if it did, I must not have let it get to me too much or something. I've just been overall happy lately. It's awesome. Even though I'm having friend issues and sister issues. ugh. Okay, off the bad. lol, well yeah, I need to find a CD to listen too, I've listened to Stronger Than Dirt like 10 times already.  So yeah - see ya!!  I love all of yas, no matter what you think!  :)

Well... last night was homecoming, guess what I got to go to?  Hint:  it's the subject. lol, I got to go to the dance.  I have never been to a school dance before, and I have never danced before in my life.  It was pretty interesting.  lol.  I didn't dance the fast dances much, but I danced all but one slow dance.  It was fun.  Andrew's way taller than me so it was kind of funny.  But still awesome.  The dance was so much fun... some people thought it was really lame and boring but I guess if you want to have fun - you'll have fun.  And I did.  The football game was awesome too, I hadn't been to one all year and it was awesome.  Andrew and I walked around a lot and stuff - it was fun.  I was so surprised that my parents let me go to the dance.  VERY surprised.  It was awesome though.  And then after the dance I called my dad to ask him if I could go to Perkins with Amanda, Kami, and Andrew and he let me!  He's like ""that's fine, just try and be home by 2:00"" lol.  That was crazy.  Amanda ended up not going and I really wish she would have cuz we had so much fun.  The three of us were SOOOOO tired and out of it... oh my goodness, it was hilarious.  So yeah, I had a lot of fun - can you tell?  And I was so worn out.  I got some weird looks from people... some ""go Carisa""'s and some winks and some stares and people talking crap about me behind my back TO my sisters and Kami... but I don't care... I mean I do but I don't at the same time.  It's kind of weird.  But some people still acted the same around me and I was glad.   I didn't get home last night until just after 2 am.  And I guess daddy had been in a bad mood that night or something.  He sounded like it too.

I told him I'd ask and I did - I can't GO with him, but I can go with him.  lol - whatever.  I can hang out with him and stuff but I can't go with him like as his date thing or something.  My parents were kind of confusing on that.  But I understand, to an extent, where they were coming from.  So last night he asked me if I asked my parents and I explained it to him, he seemed pretty cool about it, so that's good.  It felt good to get asked.  Really good.  Too bad I can't go with him though.  Will I never get asked by someone I CAN go with? lol, goodness... it's pathetic.  kinda.  Grrr.

It's so ... ugh, so annoying.  I hate it.  We won't have a sunday school teacher cuz he just doesn't want to anymore.  I love that reason.  So I have to teach it.  If I don't then we have to sit up with the adult class.  Yeah that's just a load of joy right there.  I love how people are just giving up.  Giving up on church, on Sunday school, and then it feels like people are giving up on me.  Not just the SS teacher either.  But yeah so I'm just happy about that.  And I'm teaching Childrens church this month.  I'm done with that after next week though.  

Last night while I was hanging out with a few people... I think someoen was talking to someone else about me and yeah so I kind of felt like crap.  I mean I don't know what it was about or even if that person was for sure or not but when they look at you and then put a flippin' pillow in front of their face to hide what they're whispering to someone... yeah... not obvious.

I'm so pissed about work.  I got screwed out of 5 hours that I worked, which is about $25 ish.  I forgot to punch out when I left on Saturday I guess so they didn't pay me.  And I know of like 4 or 5 people who could say ""yeah, she was here that long""... but whatever.

And... lets see.  Oh, my parents are leaving tomorrow morning until Wednesday sometime.  I think we'll be home alone that whole time but I'm not sure.  In a way I hope so because I don't want to have a ""babysitter"" deal cuz yeah, that sucks.  And in a way I hope we aren't because that's when the bratty side of some people come out:  when there are no parents.  So we'll see if I'm home much Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.

Well they broke the window of some kids sunday school room and went upstairs and broke the door to the secretary's office and broke into the treasury drawer (there wasn't any money in there - Larry doesn't leave it there during the week thank God) and then broke the window of my dad's office door, unlocked it and went in and stole my dad's laptop and router.  Yeah... NOT COOL.  Luckily daddy's insurance will cover his computer.  I have an idea of who it might of been.  We know it had to be someone young and stupid, because whatever it was they used to break the window to dad's door was still there on the floor.  They left it there.  I think it was that girl who lives across the street from there.  I think most of you know who I'm thinking about.  My mom thinks it's her and her gang too.  Cuz they all hate our family for some reason.  I'm sick of this crap.  So much has gone wrong lately, it's horrible.

This morning, well actually this afternoon, I woke up at 12:30 and felt dead. lol.  My stomache hurt and stuff so I didn't feel too great.  So I got ready for my day and mommy knocked on my door and I was just sitting on my bed staring at the wall (yeah, I have a million bajillion things on my mind today and last night) and she asked me what was wrong but I didn't tell her.  She asked if I wanted to go to Target with her, so I did.  We ate at BK before we went to Target and I had to pay for my own lunch.  Wonderful.  My mom's been pretty depressed lately because we have like no money.  I have been too.  It's getting so annoying.  I will probably have to pay for my year book.  Hopefully I can get it on Monday.  Someone payed for us all to get school pictures this year too.  So yeah, I kind of feel like a charity case.  I mean yeah, I'm really grateful that we have friends who will do that for us but still.  Not many people that I know have to deal with this.  I wouldn't ask my parents for anything the past couple weeks, even though I needed some of the stuff pretty badly.  I just went and bought it myself.  It's really stressful... for some reason.

Last night I worked from 5 to 9:30.  That was SO interesting.  I worked with all guys and all of them were like ... indirectly flirting with me in a way, and this one guy who creeps me out was hitting on me - again.  He tried to put something in my back pocket for me and I moved away and was like ""no, I don't think so, I'll put stuff in my pocket if I want to"".  He's like ""fine"".  Ugh.  I don't like him.  I work tonight at 5 too.  And he's working as well.  Yay, not.  So yeah.  I have to get ready to go actually - see ya.

This morning started off not that great, but I also didn't let anything dissapoint me too much somehow.  Last night though - BAD!
I have Writing with Mrs. Frarck or however you spell it First hour.  That went okay, not too much homework there. Then Second hour I have Family Living.  I hate my table.  it sucks - Andy Meek, Joel Hunn, and Emily Sonnabend (sp?)... great times there.  And then lunch - that's always peachy.  And Third hour I have Chemistry.  Oh my flippin' goodness... it was SOOO hilarious today.  Lucas and Hegna were being so funny... had to be there.  And finally, I have Graphic Arts last hour. Icky.  We did start Caligraphy today though, that's kind of fun... it takes forever and a week to get the hang of it though.  I'm already behind in that class... JOY!  I hate art... the only reason I hate it so much is because I'm really slow at it so I fall behind and get lates on almost all of my assignments.  If I wasn't such a perfectionist I wouldn't hate it so much but oh well.  Anyways... yeah. Well laters

"event","So today was a pretty good day.  It wasn't very eventful though.  I woke up around 9:30 this morning, which is sleeping in for me, lol, well, at least lately.  But yeah, I just kind of hung out in my room all day, cuz there wasn't anything else to do.  But around 4 I got ready for work.  But then I had to go to this lady's (from my church) 90th birthday party.  What a blast! LOL, jk.  SO then I left for work a little before 5.  It was so crazy.  I owe one of the drivers a buck because I forgot to charge the guy an extra dollar for delivery.  *rolls eyes* I kinda got chewed out for that.  Whatever.  Other than that I didn't screw anything major up.  Just a couple fixable mistakes, like abbreviations and stuff - no big deal.  I finished my night with washing a butt load of dishes and then I got to go home a little after 8.  Once I got home, no one was home... which doesn't surprise me too much.  Everyone's been gone after I get home from work lately.  I got into the shower and man am I tired. lol.  So yeah, that's my day.  Right now I""m watching Scamper the Penguin. LOL, It was my FAVORITE movie when I was little.  I found it the other day so I'm watching it, lol.  It's so awesome.  I don't work again until Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.  Yay. lol.  Oh well, at least the people I work with aren't too bad.  I'm the only one there who doesn't smoke though, so I'm the only one who doesn't take smoking breaks.  My break is dishes pretty much... oh well.  Well I'm going to go, later.

"event","Lets start at... Wednesday night, lol.

I had a ""gathering"" - as some call it, lol - that night and a lot of people showed up, not necessarily all at once though.  But yeah, that was pretty interesting.  My cousin, Amanda, was here (she stayed here all week).  There's a little more to that story but I won't get into it.  We were all just hanging out at the park and when we came back from the park we were just talking in the road, lol.  My mom called me inside saying I had a phone call and guess who!?  Jeff - the owner of country pizza.  He called to tell me I had the job!  Yay!  So I was pretty happy about that.  I was diffident about getting that job so getting it was awesome.  I hadn't been having a great evening but once I got that call I became excited and stuff so I pepped up a little bit.  Once we finally got the fire started we sat around it and talked for a long time and then my brother, Aaron, came outside and told us that Heidi (some of you may know her as Miss Sogge) and her fiance were home.  So Andy, Dean, Scott, and I ran over there and helped them unload.  After that we hung out at the fire some more.  Once just about everyone left, Andy and Dean stayed here and we watched movies for a while.  Frailty.  Pretty good movie!  (Kara and Dean were pretty cozy together that night... *rolls eyes* and so were a couple other people.....)

So Thursday... oh.  I had to babysit at like 12:30 so Amanda and I went to Subway for lunch and she dropped me off at the house (and their power was turned off... LOL, that was interesting) and then picked me up again to go get my work schedule.  And that was pretty much my day. lol.

Friday I babysat again and then I worked my first day at 5:00 to 10:00.  That was pretty cool.  I thought it wasn't going to be at all enjoyable but it was pretty fun.  The lady who was training me in was really nice and understanding... well... at least around me. lol, I heard her say something that showed her annoyance with me when she was in the other part of the kitchen talking to her husband. Whatever.  It wasn't like I wasn't trying or something.  And then later she screwed up an order too so hey.  I came home smelling like a pizza place and I was really tired.  My shower felt really good. lol

Yesterday we went to the Cities to meet my daddy and the other guys for supper at Outback - my favorite restaurant by the way, lol.  Then we went to Mall of America and walked around for a bit.  That was pretty much my day there too.

Today I went to church, then to lunch, then to Target and now home.  Amanda, as in my cousin, left today after sunday school.  And here I am.  Thinking.  Too much again. lol - Scott is right.  Thinking never ends well.  I work tomorrow... hopefully that goes well!  I'm off, later!

"event","Well yesterday was pretty okay.  Kind of.  My mom, Aunt Sheryl, and Gramma came home from their overnight in the cities.  (My parents left us overnight!! with no ""babysitter""!!)  My dad will be in the Boundary Waters for the rest of the week.  So Amanda, my cousin, is staying here for the week.  Yeah...  But anyways.  So yesterday we just hung out at home.  We decided to go to Burger King for supper and Josh had called me and so he gave us a ride there and back.  Before that, I got a call to come in for a job interview!  That was pretty cool. I was nervous all day yesterday, lol.  

Today I had to babysit at 12:30 until 2:00 and then I came home, changed for my interview, which was at 2:30, and walked down to Country Pizza.  The interview only took like 3 minutes and went pretty well... I think.  I don't think that I got the job though.  But whatever.  And here I am. 

The other night was a lot of fun... uh.. Sunday night.  It was awesome, Andy came over around 9:30, lol, and we (Andy, Ericka, Aaron, Amanda (my cuz), and I) watched movies.  Specifically Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Evil Dead II.  OH MY GOODNESS!!!  TCM is SOOO scary!  Oh my word!  I was screaming a lot and half the time I couldn't even look at the TV and I actually almost started crying.  Particularly almost started crying during the documentary of the true story of Ed Gein.  He is a truly sickening man.  I almost threw up.  I don't know how people can do stuff like that.  ugh.  But yeah, it is a good movie though.  Andy didn't leave until 4:00 am, cuz Jane called. lol.  That was fun.  He almost hit a kitty though when we ran back to his house and back.  (JK!!!)  lol, he wasn't going to hit it, I was just giving him a hard time about it.  That kitten was SOOO cute!  He was like a little puff ball, lol.  I did surprise myself though, I didn't have any nightmares that night. lol.  My brother didn't sleep too well though.  And all four of us slept upstairs in the living room, LOL.  None of us would sleep in our rooms.  Kara had spent the night at someone's house, otherwise she'd be creeped out.  But yeah, fun night.

Yesterday was ""kind of okay"" for a couple reasons.  But I don't wanna talk about it, lol.  And the 'current mood' thing is for a few reason also, lol.  But yeah, I am going to go, see ya!

"event","Well I woke up at 6:30 this morning and babysat at 7:00 until 10:00.  lol, barely worth waking up for, but it's an extra $10 I didn't have before.

I came home and the rest of my family was still sleeping so I did 3 loads of laundry and got online.  The rest of the day was dedicated to cleaning the entire house - thanks to many relatives coming up tomorrow.  That sounded like I was mad that they're coming, I'm not. lol.  It should be pretty cool, except for the fact that I can't have my traditional Sunday night get together this week, when I really needed to see my TRUE friends.

Around 7 we (as in my family and I) went to see Princess Diaries 2 in Kasson.  It's pretty cute.  And I ate way too much popcorn, lol.  And that's where now is.  My family went to BK - with my money - but I didn't want to go, I'm full from popcorn, plus I didn't feel like going with this mongo headache I have right now.

So now I'm thinking.  Probably too much.  Just about my whole summer has gone through my mind - mostly the bad crap that's happened.  It sucks!  I have less friends now... and yet, I also have better friends at the same time.  So I guess every cloud does have a silver lining.  The thing that sucks the most?  I wasn't directly involved in any argument or fight or whatever and yet I'm the one screwed over.  I mean I'm sure I'm not the only one screwed over but I am and I shouldn't be.  I've had someone tell me I shouldn't be in their life anymore, a few people not talking to me anymore over a very immature reason that I won't get into here, and other people not talking to me because of a new relationship that suddenly means I can't be the friend anymore.  Ugh.  I should probably just quit trying to help people, I seem to make things worse.  Or at least ""some people"" have made me feel that way, or that everything is my fault.  Whatever.  If I get screwed, I get screwed I guess.  I'll just do what I can, if it's helping or not helping when I know I should or shouldn't.  

I'm glad Valley Fair was so much fun!  It was awesome, I needed that.  I got a sweatshirt which is the total bomb, lol!  The lock in part of it was totally awesome.  It was spiritually lifting as well as just plain fun.  At Valley Fair I was hit on by a couple guys on a water ride... LOL oh goodness... great times there!  (Amanda... next time we'll have to go on that ride! LOL)  Good - I'm thinking of something GOOD for once today!  I'll leave on that note.

-Carisa

Thank you to all of you who are my True friends:  who have stuck by me through the good times and the bad - THAT'S true friendship and I love it!  Thank you so much, I love you all!  You know if you're a true friend of mine or not I think."

I woke up this morning at 8:45 to get ready for church, which was at 9:30.  I got to wear my new dress!  I got some compliments.. lol.  Sunday school was okay, Mark was talking about how we should think about going on a mission trip at some point in our life... that's all we really talked about.  Church was cool too.

After church, Amanda and I ran to my house quickly to change and then went to meet my parents at BK.  We ate, fast, and then we went to get ready for the parade.  There were a couple alterations we had to make to our float but it turned out great.  I was walking and/or running through the entire parade.  And because it was promoting VBS we were ""dancing"" to the VBS music - that was so fun!  I was exhausted afterwards.  But it was fun!

After the parade and everything I just chilled and stuff and around 7:30 I had a bunch of people over for a get together.  I was surprised at the people who came - took them forever but it was awesome - Amanda, Kase, Sarah, Dean, Fred, Marianne, Joanna, Kami (her friends Josh and Wyatt), Andy (I was honestly surprised he came!  I had never invited him before because I didn't think he'd want to, but he did and it was awesome.), and Beth. (I think that's everyone) We had a bonfire and stuff and then went to the park and hung out there for a while until we saw a cop drive by and some people got freaked so we ran back to my house and watched Hangman's Curse.  Dan stopped by the park to talk to me for a bit which was cool.

And here I am!  Notice nothing went wrong today!  I have a good idea why though but I won't say here.  I am so happy right now.

I am so excited for Tuesday!  So far we have about 18 or 20 people going and more coming to the lock in half of it!  YAY! I can't wait.  I'm going to go though, I don't know what else to talk about!  I love you all!

"event","Well today I was once again waken up by Aaron - saying I had a phone call (this was like 9:30 this morning) - it was Jeanne asking me to babysit in an hour and a half. lol.  It wasn't bad though - I had a productive day for the most part because of it - earning $10.  So that's always a good thing.

Once I came home though I had nothing to do, so I cleaned.  I cleaned under the deck (there was still stuff that was blown under there from the last thunderstorm or something, lol); unloaded, loaded, and unloaded (again) the dishwasher (Ericka not thanking me but watching me -it's her chore); I took all of my mom's and my shrunk out of clothes to the garage (a total of 8 garbage bags!!  way to go mommy!!!); cleaned the kitchen some more; and cleaned the hamster cage thingy.  I felt pretty accomplished. lol.

A while ago we played Skip-Bo (my parents, Ericka, Kara, Kami, and I) and mom asked me what I had done that day so I told her and she asked if Ericka had thanked me and I said no so Ericka (out of pressure) said thank you.  That was sincere - lol.  

I can't wait until Tuesday!!!  Valley Fair and a lock-in!! WITH FOOD! LOL (Some of you might not get that... lol)  It should be awesome.  I just really pray that we get more people to come.  My dad's been working his butt of for us (the ""youth group"") trying to plan things for us but whenever he does it either doesn't work out for some reason or it ends up being a downer or hardly anyone comes.  Like, for example, the Swift concert.  Out of pure bad luck there was a tornado warning and major storm that night so there weren't many people there - my dad lost a lot of money on that all because of the storm.  I just want something to go according to plan and be unforgettable... not to mention financially good.  (another issue I'm not gonig to get into).  

Tomorrow we decorate the church's float for the parade!  yay!  That is always awesome cuz it's a fun one - it's based on the VBS we just had.  I was soaked last year from a fountain thing Lori made that I had to walk under, lol - it was so fun.  Hopefully that isn't as stressful to make as last years was though!

AND it said it was 11:15 instead of 9:15.  Luckily my brother woke up really early since I had to babysit at 10.  That was pretty okay.  It's a pretty typical babysitting job though.  Except yesterday the guy came home an hour and a half later than he said he would so Amanda was waiting at my house for 2 and a half hours.  (We went into Rochester.)  Yeah, and then I came home after babysitting and got online.  I talked to Dan Schouweiler, Scott, and Amanda.  I love talking to people. lol.  And here I am.

Oh, last night in Rochester, I bought my dress!!!  I had tried it on before when it was more money than I had at the time so I couldn't get it and when we went there last night it was 75% off!!  I was literally jumping when I saw it.  ONE dress left and it was my size.  I was so happy!  It was too low for my comfort so I had to buy a spaghetti strap tank top to go underneath it.  It's SOOOO pretty though, I love it!  (No Dan it isn't Madonna low, lol)

Yeah, I went to get rid of porn bots in my profile about 5 minutes ago and I saw ""someone"" had been in my profile again...  Not that i have too much against the person but I don't know why they have to come to my profile multiple times.  Especially when another someone never told me about this someone and still hasn't mentioned this someone outside of profiles.  lol - sorry if that was majorlly confusing.  There are a select 2 or few people who might know what I'm talking about and you would understand why I'm upset about that.  I'm trying to tell myself I'm over it but I seriously don't think I am.  And I can't figure out why.

yeah, and last night as Amanda and I were driving home (after 5 hours of shopping) Fred called her cell phone and told her to turn around and go back to Taco Bell, because he and Josh were eating there.  So we did and hung out with them for like 5 minutes and they left.  Josh thinks I hate him now though.  Whatever, I can't be perfect and there are certain things he doesn't understand about me and never will so I just need to accept that.  

Now I'm listening to my headphones - quite loudly.  lol.  It's my way of calming down or whatever.  It's my new Muse CD so it's cool.  I'm gonna check my mail now - not that I'll have any, lol.   Later

Okay, so I had stayed the night at Amanda's Wednesday night so yesterday morning I was at her house until... 3:30?  (We watched Swim Fan and Ghost Ship the night before, lol)  Then we hung out at my house for a little while and left for Subway.  That was fun!  We ran into Dan Schouweiler and Joanna's brother (I don't remember his name) so they sat with us.  It was fun.  

Then Amanda and I went to the Kasson Theater's Bash thing.  That was awesome!  The band - Words of Grace - was really, really good.  Brick and Amp booked them, it was cool.  The Village is a good movie too.  But I screwed up there cuz I was supposedly mad at Kara?  And for no reason?  Yeah, whatever.  It wasn't a great time...  And I should have called Josh again but I didn't think of that.  I should've but I can't do anything about it now.  Too bad sorry isn't good enough...  So I kind of screwed up with at least two people there.  Not good.

After the Bash we went home and chilled for a while... kind of boring though.  Then Amanda went to bed and I did a couple hours later.  I could NOT fall asleep though, until like 5 I think.  And then at like 4, right as I was about to fall asleep, I like opened my eyes for some reason and I could have sworn I saw someone standing next to my bed.  It was so creepy.  And I just like stared for a little bit and after a while the ""person thing"" kind of shrunk into a ballish thing and went up and then it was gone.  That was SOOOO creepy, lol. So that didn't help me get to sleep either.  So since I couldn't sleep I didn't get up until like 1:45 today.  Which I feel bad about cuz Amanda stayed the night last night... oops.

So yeah, and so into today.  I woke up, took a shower, and came downstairs and Amanda's mom had called so she had to leave.  And here I am.  Hopefully today is a good day.  Yesterday, or last night ish, wasn't a good day emotionally so I hope it is today.  And I pray God is with my friends today, keep them safe and happy too.  But I'm going to go, laters.

I woke up around 1 and Amanda came over while I was taking a shower so when I was ready and stuff we left for Marianne's birthday party thing.  We went to see Bourne Supremacy (awesome movie) and then we came back, ate, and rented a movie (Wrong Turn) which was so icky but it was pretty good too.  That was a pretty fun day.  I came home like 45 minutes ago and dad tells me I have a message for a babysitting job.  I called the guy back and I'm babysitting tomorrow morning at either 7:30 or 8:00.  YAY!  not.  I have to be up at like 6:30.  LOL  Okay... um let's pray that happens.  I haven't been able to fall asleep like all summer until like 4 in the morning, it's horrible.  Even when I'm up at like 8 I cannot fall asleep that night even.  Tomorrow night I think I'm going to see The Village with Amanda and Beth.  I hope we go to the Kasson one, lol, it's cheaper and I'm kind of restricted on money.  OH!  While we were leaving the theater for Marianne's birthday party, it started pouring before we went outside and wow, I got so wet.  We all ran to Amanda's car and when we got there I had to wait for this stupid lady parking... she pulled in crooked and way close to the car so I couldn't get in since she was backing out again... so I had to wait for like 3 minutes in the pouring rain for her to get her flippin' car parked.  I was SO wet.  My mascara was running and everything, it wasn't pretty, lol.  But I didn't hate it that much because I love the rain, it's so awesome.  I want to just go outside and just run around in it, lol.  We were going to when we got back to Marianne's house but it wasn't raining in Kasson anymore.  Bummer.  But that was fun, I just had to talk about that.  Well I am going to go, laters.  I'm so... tired!  Not like sleepy tired but like... I don't know, exhausted I guess in multiple ways for multiple reasons, lol.

Sanctus Real - Things Like You

Loving things like you has wrecked my life, made me cry
Loving things like you has made me lose my mind
And I can't figure out why I've been hanging on
To all thesse things I've tried to leave behind me for so long

And I think it's time to find a better way to live my life
Than loving all those things that keep me wrapped so tight

Everyone wants everyone else's everything
Sometimes the more we have the less we really gain
I'm tired of loving all that money has to buy
Get out of my heart, out of my mind, I'm leaving you behind

Loving things like you has left me bruised, black and blue
Loving things like you has made me so confused
And I can't figure out what I've been waiting on
God I can't be living life for things I know are wrong

Now I think it's time to write a better chapter in my life
Leaving all those things that keep me wrapped so tight

Why are we obsessed with possessions here on earth?
Go and take a look at the flowers and the birds
God is always taking care of nature's every need
And how much more important in the Father's eyes are we?
I said, how much more important in the Father's eyes are we?
HE SEES EVERYTHING"

I'm kind of ...drained... at the moment. 

Say Goodbye - Sanctus Real

So say goodbye 'cause you'll
be leaving soon
I know it's hard, and I'll be
missing you
I know it's time to say goodbye

I know the road, has worn
you down
You never broke, you always
held your ground
But now it's time to say goodbye

And I know we'll meet again, but
I wish it'd never end
You don't mean to make me cry,
But it's so hard to say goodbye

Say goodbye
Say goodbye

And though you're gone I
remember now
The time we shared, your words
sill ring out
You're never far, you're in
my heart

Someday we'll meet again,
'cause that's how the 
story goes
It's so hard to say goodbye
Say goodbye"

"event","Well today was a very boring, uneventful day.  lol.  Well, until around 8:30 ish.  But I did absolutely nothing today and since it was Aaron's birthday today, well... now it's yesterday, but anyway, my mom took him out for lunch and shopping (to spend his birthday money) - which is a family tradition.  So while mom was gone my dad went to look for a present for her, it will be so awesome but I won't say just because I'm not sure if she'll read this.  Just to be safe, lol.  But yeah, she's going to like my present too.  So anyways, Ericka, Kami, and Kara all went rollerblading and stuff so I was home by myself.  Later they came home and Morgan came over for a little bit and then Kara went to Morgans house.  Ericka's friend Hailey came over around 8 also.  So it was quite interesting.  We had lots of people at our house, because around 3 Amanda came over and we did nothing together, lol.  And around 8:30 Josh came over.  We were going to do something like a movie or bowling or something but NO ONE would say what they wanted to do, so we ended up not doing anything which really bugged me for some reason.  Kara and Josh had their flirt session, well... they did the longest but really Ericka, Kara, and Hailey were all flirting with him, and he didn't hate it so yeah, I just kind of hung out on the couch staring at the TV - watching Aaron and my dad play Eighteen Wheeler on GameCube.  Amanda had left before all this happened.  So, again, I was feeling a little ... left out I guess and lonely.  Yay.  So that was great.  Later though, Josh and I talked and stuff, which was pretty cool I guess.

I hate this so much, I feel SO selfish, like I'm trying to get all the attention from everyone.  And like I hate when someone else gets it but I don't.  I hate that because then I feel immature and stuff, like I should have control over it and yet I don't.  It's crazy, I don't know what to do about it.  Plus I feel incredibly dependent on my parents and even Amanda.  I have no money that I earn myself, and I have no car, let alone a license.  I wish I had a job or something so I wouldn't be as dependent anymore, and I'd also feel a little more responsible and like I'm doing something for myself and I wouldn't feel bad for counting on other people.  I have a babysitting job on Thursday I think but I don't know how much I'll get from that, and I doubt it'll last long, cuz I need some stuff so it will probably be gone soon.  I guess I'll have to tell myself to put it in the bank - the only time I use that money is for birthday presents.  Which, after about $30 for mom and Aaron's present, I'll have $30 left.  I earn it, and it's gone.  I LOVE spending money on people but then I realize it's gone.  But I like giving to people so it doesn't bother me as much, if I spend it on myself then I get a little more upset at myself.  Anyways, sorry, that was kind of a dull topic for you to read about.  lol.  

Thanks for reading though - it means a lot, seriously.

"event","Wow... My siblings are so home.  I forgot how much they fight!  Oh, and also how much they piss me off.  It's weird how different I am from them sometimes, like seriously.  But yeah, so we went to Target last night to get some groceries and stuff and I was talking to mom about something and Kara comes up and is like ""what?"" and I said nothing and she got all mad at me and was like ""fine whatever"" and I said holy cow I didn't do anything ""it was how you said nothing"". LOL Oh my goodness.  And then when we got home she wouldn't tell me what was wrong or whatever (she was crying so I asked her what was wrong), she's like ""Nothing, if you don't have to tell me stuff then I don't have to tell you"" And holy crap, it's none of her flippin' business what I talk to mom about!  Man she pisses me off sometimes.

It's Aaron's birthday today!  Happy Birthday Aaron!  lol not that he's reading this but oh well.  He's 13 now.  Whoa... that is crazy.  I think he's 13... oh crap... he's 12.  LOL  Show's how much I know.  Mom's birthday is tomorrow, at least I know her age. I wrote down the wrong day on the fridge calender thing though, LOL, oops!  Oh well, her present should make up for it.  

Well, hopefully I do something with friends today... I'll update later tonight.

"event","My siblings are home now.  Oh joy.  They came home around like... 4 I think.  They showed me all their new stuff and so that was just a great time.  They brought the hamsters home too.  See, the original plan was I was going to get two.  Now, I get zero and sibs were going to get 2 each because there were 6 hamsters.  Then, there were 9 hamsters.  I still don't get any, now everyone else gets 3 each.  Yeah... okay?  Oh well, not important I guess.  So... now that they are home, I feel a little more lonely... go figure?  More people, more lonely... okay, that doesn't make sense.  I don't know, it's whacked.  I mean I feel lonely even when they aren't here but now it's worse.

I'm starting that carb diet thing, or Atkins or whatever it's called.  And I am so hungry.  We went to Olive Garden (Aaron's birthday is tomorrow so he got to pick where to eat) for supper and I had salad.  There wasn't even chicken or anything, it was just salad.  I was still hungry when we left and my stomach is growling again.  Mom and I found these ""Carb Smart"" fudge bar things that only have 3 crabs in them so yay, it's something!  I might have to eat one now, I'm hungry!

"event","Yay!  Internet works now!  So first I'll talk about yesterday...

I went to church and I was in the nursery watching Pheonix, he is SO cute.  I was so tired though I almost fell asleep on the nursery floor, lol.  After church we (my parents and I) when to TGI Friday's for lunch.  That's a yummy restaurant!  After lunch we went to WalMart to get some stuff and then we came home.  I fell asleep on the chair ... very much curled up, lol.  Amanda called and then she came over ... I had fallen back asleep too, lol, so yeah, that was kinda funny.  Then my parents left for the evening service at church (I don't go to it anymore) and dad said I could have a party so Amanda and I cleaned like mad people and we called some people and they came around 7 ish.  It was really fun, most of our time we were outside around our little in-town fire, lol.  We used up all the wood! lol  But we just all sat around the fire and talked and stuff, that was a lot of fun.  Just about everyone left around 11 or 11:30.  Josh and I stayed outside though for a while and talked.  When he left I went inside and watched TV with my parents and went to bed around 1:30... I couldn't fall asleep though again, until like 3 or 4. Which leads me to today!

Today I woke up, took a shower, put a load of laundry in... put my Falling Up CD in the DVD Player and got online to talk to people and here I am.  Dan helped me answer a couple questions I had about some stuff so that's good.  Really good.  I just hope I make the right decisions.  I have this fear that I will jump into something that isn't genuine or real or right... just because I feel I need it.  I was told last night that I seemed like a lonely person lately - which is kind of true.  I've felt really lonely for a while now and I hate it.  So I'm praying I won't jump into anything just because I think it'll cure that.  I know God has that person for me, I'm just having a hard time waiting.  I trust Him though and I'm working on trusting Him more and with everything in my life.  Things would be so much easier then.

"event","Today was pretty okay...  I woke up pretty early - 11:30!  lol, yay for me!  I was online for a while and then did nothing for the majority of the day.  

Around 5:30ish, Beth came over and she went with me over to Matt and Luke's house to get and return some stuff.  Then we went to Conoco to rent a movie and we rented Hellbreeder.  Oh my word... don't ever see that movie unless you're in a mood to seriously start to get mad at it. lol, It's a foreign horror movie and it's horrible and instead of being scared I laughed through the entire thing.  It's worse then Evil Dead II lol.  It was so bad.  It was entertaining though I guess - Beth fell asleep after a while though, lol.  When the clown thing died it squirted green blood... they must have used the wrong food coloring (just like it Evil Dead II) LOL.  The blood in that movie was bad - it was like water with food coloring or something, it was beyond fake and it was so gory so there was a lot of fakeness in the movie, lol.  What was hilarious was this guy was missing a lot of his like... skin, lol, where you could see his ribs (ironically the EXACT same wound as 3 other people in the movie... in exactly the same spot... LOL) and then an axe fell on his wrist so his wrist was slit... among other wounds and he was able to talk normally and walk... I was like uh... okay?  lol, it was a pretty good time... lol 
After the movie we decided to make some grilled chicken and fried potatoes... so we went to Erdmans - got some chicken, and then went to Beths to get the potatoes.  Oh goodness I'm never frying potatoes again, lol, I no longer like oil.  It was ""quite the ordeal"".  LOL  Fun times all night long.  I was talking to Josh on the phone while we were cooking and for a while after too.  Beth left around midnight and here I am, listening to Falling Up!  So yeah, that was my day... fun happy times.  Oh, and Brett talked to me... I don't know why he wasn't tlaking to me before but.. oh well...  And... I still don't really get why he hasn't mentioned his girlfriend to me - at all... it's kind of strange... but again.. oh well.  

But I'm in a pretty good mood today so I won't let it bug me.  And if I think of something negative then that good mood won't be so good, lol, so yeah.  I'll leave before I type other stuff out.

"event","Hey all!  Well, I woke up today and took a shower and uh... got online.  lol, nu-uh!  yeah, I did.  lol  I talked to some people as usual.  I also watched The Butterfly Effect!  I pretty much liked that movie mainly because of the psychological aspect - I love that kind of movie! I like it when I have to think and figure it out.  Later, Amanda came online and she came over and picked me up and we went shopping.  I bought the Falling Up CD that Andy told me about, it's really good.  It's cool cuz Andy and I like the same type of music so I'll pretty much know I'll like it if he tells me I should get it. yay. lol  So I'm listening to that right now!  And yeah, that was my day.  Joyous huh?  I was bored out of my mind today holy crud it was bad, lol.  I've been home all by myself the whole day!  Mom and Dad ... don't know where they are, lol, but it's okay cuz they left me money! :)  <-- Isn't he a cute little happy face? lol  Anyways, yeah, so now Amanda's at my house for a little while, and she's talking to Ryan, lol.  No stinkin' way!  LOL, Jk... it's cool.  Well I don't know what else to talk about cuz I don't have a whole lot on my mind that you haven't heard before, lol.  Night!

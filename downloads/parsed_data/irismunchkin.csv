and that holiday would be..
Passover :)
so to all the Jews, thank the man above that we are no longer slaves.. and eat that shitty matzah with pride! :)

I had a wonderful dinner tonight, complements of Hillel. The food was eh.. but I had a good time chatting with some kids.. and I had lots and lots of Manichevitz wine and lots of laughs. :) 

Now that I'm a bit tipsy, I must read for one of my classes tomorrow.

Have a sweet night!"

Wednesday, 31st March 2004

LIBRA 
(Sep 24 - Oct 23)  
   I have to write your forecast in a hurry today. So I left some of the sentences unfinished. I figured you wouldn't mind completing them for... Thank you. I know you are going through a challenging time, but don't worry because... Your biggest difficulty is relatively easy to resolve. All you have to do is... Oh, and here's what a certain person really thinks of you. They are under the impression that you... Those were fascinating conclusions you jumped to but they were not all correct. Be careful what you tell yourself today. 

It just.. strikes me as odd for a horoscope.

So, the roomies and I had a party this past Friday. For those who arrived, thank you much! I had a pretty good time. Could have been better, and dogone it, the next one will be! It was so nice to have Dan and his friend (and now my friend) Justin over. I love meeting such great people. And Megan! who I have hung out with almost never.. but we got to chat and will be hangin out more now (right?! ;).. and Eric, my love, who I haven't seen in too long. I've got some good shots of you. Dont' have time to figure out how to post them now. (somebody should just tell me how to do it.. anybody?) The new boy, ahem, man I was dating is out of the picture.. and I feel so FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!! WOOHOO! Being single has never felt so good. I'm soakin' up every minute. 

This weekend was so fab.. got to spend so much quality time with such quality people.. and quality pugs. I love you Macky! hehe. (Took Dan's dog Dante and roomate's dog Macky, my love, to the dog park yesterday. Got some great video footage too. I want my own pug :( but Macky fills the void for now :)

That's my Oracle music review, by the way. Check it out! My first published one ever. WHoop whoop! (Doesn't say my name, but the hard-copy does.)

New discovery: Publix's Homestyle Red Potato Salad is AMAZING. 

Had more to write.. but it has slipped the mind.
Kisses to all, and to all a pleasant evening. :)

p.s. I think Tampa might be a city deemed as having THE WORST DRIVERS EVER."

My life seems to be going a mile a minute.

So many opportunities have been popping up for me.
First, I am now part of this mentorship program.. and soon enough I will be meeting with 2 Tampa Tribune writers (one of which broke the Al-Arian case)! I believe I will be meeting up with them at the Tribune. How cool is that?! Luckily, there is another girl who is also into journalism (and education- like me!) who will be there with me so I don't have to meet these strangers alone. What are the odds :)

Also, there is a pro-Israel lobbying group named AIPAC (grassroots lobbying organization that works to strengthen and maintain the US-Israel relationship) who Hillel, i.e. my friend Leanne thinks I should be a part of. There will be a conference in D.C. with some great speakers in May, and I may just be going.. with Hillel paying for it ;) Not positive, but we shall see.

I also wrote my first music review for the school paper. Everyone must check it out! It comes out tomorrow.. it's of the new Incubus album. I feel truly proud of this effort.. so much more fun than writing news articles, I tell ya. If you can't get the paper yaself, I will be posting the site on here tomorrow so you can check it out on the web. The Oracle music editors loved it.. one of em said it's better than what some of the music writers turn in. HeeHee!! Also, there will be writing slots opening up in the Fall.. so guess who just may have an official spot in the school paper? ;) I'm so excited. This was what I THOUGHT I wanted to do.. and soon enough I may just be SURE.

There's actually more, but I must get ready for class.
Thanks for surfin' on over.."

Back again with some goodness to share.

Been hanging out with Momma a lot this break :)
We've been going out to lunch, going shopping, running errands.. it's so nice. If only my sister was around to hang out with us too. I miss her so!

You know, I love when I'm in the mood to spend money.
And thank you Riann for checking the mail and finding a beautiful fat check for me in it before I left for home! ;)

Went to an Asian Market today (it was huge!) and bought a whole bunch of goodies to cook with. 
I can't wait to use it all!
My mom will be making some spring/fresh rolls tonight with the new rice paper we got. How cool is that? 
Last night I went to the beach with some old friends.. it was a cold and beautiful night I tell ya.
Soon I will be off to visit a friend and her beautiful baby girl.

"event","Hey kids,

Long time no write! I have been busy up the wazoo.. and it feels pretty good. So much has gone on since I've last written. 

I'm home (in Hollywood) for spring break.. just relaxing, hanging out with my family, seeing old friends, going to the beach as much as possible.. and reading. My cousin from Israel is staying with us, so I've been brushing up on my Hebrew :) I'm learning more vocab. and she's learning words like ""cocky"" and [I'm not really] ""ga-ga"" [over him]. 
Did I mention I met a really great guy? ;) 

Last Saturday was the Langerado Festival in HOLLYWOOD! of all places :) Talk about Hippyville. Woo! So many gorgeous, dirty, free-loving people dancing the day away. I got to see The Wailers, G. Love and the Special Sauce (I love him.), Cake, The Spam Allstars, and this amazing techno/reggae group.. I think they're called RANA. Not one bad band, I tell ya. I spent the entire day (and night!) tokin' it up with my roomate Riann and my dearest brother Ronny. It was one of the best times ever. Riann spent the weekend down here and got to meet much of my family. We completely stuffed her with some home-made Israeli food. YUM! :)

I'm now waiting for the sun to fully emerge so I can bask myself in the midst of it. They say that today might be the last warm day of break. Um, hello? Where am I living again? 

I know I had much more to say.. but now is not the time. I must eat and go on with my beautiful day.

Hope everyone is taking complete advantage of the break.. (if they have one!)

Much love to all my friends..."

So much time has been spent on vigorous, un relentless negativity in my recent life that now silly average days feel so refreshing.

... maybe there is no such thing as an 'average' day.
... maybe there is no such thing as 'silly'.
... maybe every day is awful until you decide to let the sunshine in.
... maybe every day is wonderful unless your mind decides that it is not the time for happiness.
... maybe every day is whatever you allow it to be.

I tell ya, it's quite an ability to let yourself allow something to be good.. happy.. positive. 

... maybe people take that for granted.

Positivity- what a beautiful concept.

You know, every year I say I'm not going to celebrate the silly February 14th Hallmark Holiday.. and almost every year I do, in one fashion or another.

All the flashy red and pink merchandise is inescapable.. so much that it sucked me into buying a hot pink heart-shaped candle.. (it was on sale dammit! and Dan encouraged me to buy it) and Dan ended up buying a yummy huge heart-shaped Reeses peanut butter cup. So yummy.

Dan and I spent all day (and I mean the wwwwhoooooolllleee ddddaaaaayyyy) hanging out. We initially wanted to go canoeing but it was raining.. so we ended up running around town doing all sorts of things. I got treated to a wonderful dinner at Buca Di Beppo.. this amazing Italian restaurant. Such an abundance of food.. everything about it was amazing. The yummy salad came with yummy flat bread, the eggplant parmeasan wasn't too cheesey.. and the pastas were quite saucy.. just how I like it. We took half of the meal along with us and ate our brains out for the rest of the day. :)

We also bought a bunch of sugary treats (Sour Patch Fruit MAY JUST BE better than Sour Patch Kids my friends..) and rented a movie called American Splendor. Very creative.. and eccentric to say the least. I dug it. 

I also dug spending goofy, crazy, quality time with Mr. Bouvier. It just happened to be on Valentine's Day... what can I say.

Tonight is the second to last episode of Sex and the City.
Ya'll know it's gonna be good!

I am awaiting the arrival of my roomate Riann. She's been gone all weekend!

I suppose this is all for now folks..
Hope you all have had a nice weekend! :)"

"event","So here I am, in HollyHood for the weekend. I must say it's been a fabulous time. Hung out with my long lost friend Brian on Friday.. with of course Silvia.. and laughed it up for a while. Saw the movie Monster last night- that Charleze Theron is amazing. Sure, the movie made me want to gag as I cringed in my seat from the screen towering over me like some sort of.. I don't know what. Sitting in the second row is not something I recommend my friends. But the movie.. it's quite a ride. Hung out with my cousin, met up with my other cousin-for the movie- who is now a Miami cop (crazy!) and then...

I arrive at a friends place, thinking we're (Silvia and I) are just stopping by to say a little hello. To my surprise, about 10 of my friends from high school were there, drunk and happy as could be. The warm welcome was over-powering. I have truly missed my friends. I was just starting to think man, I am getting attached to Tampa.. but you know.. you can't forget where ya came from. As much as I make fun of the HOOD, I've got quite a few memories here. Sure I feel different from those days but you know, these people watched me grow, and I love them truly.

Must finish the Oracle article now.. I've got a deadline! For all of those in the area, pick up an oracle tomorrow (Monday) and check out my article! :) You know, it's just another step in becoming a writer. Yay! 

I will soon be on my way to my other home. It will be 4 hours (ok probably less) of wonderful absorption of the new Incubus album. I'm diggin' it. 

I'd like to post some pictures up.. so once I figure out how, I will!

Today was an interesting day. I got my third assignment from the Oracle (school paper) today! It's not the most interesting article in the world.. but it's something. I may also write a review for the new Incubus album that is coming out next week. We shall see...

"event","A lot has been said about how to prevent rape.
Women should learn self-defense. Women should lock themselves in their houses after dark. Women shouldn't have long hair and women shouldn't wear short skirts. Women shouldn't leave drinks unattended. Fuck, they shouldn't dare to get drunk at all.


instead of that bullshit, how about:

if a woman is drunk, don't rape her.
if a woman is walking alone at night, don't rape her.
if a women is drugged and unconscious, don't rape her.
if a woman is wearing a short skirt, don't rape her.
if a woman is jogging in a park at 5 am, don't rape her.
if a woman looks like your ex-girlfriend you're still hung up on, don't rape her.
if a woman is asleep in her bed, don't rape her.
if a woman is asleep in your bed, don't rape her.
if a woman is doing her laundry, don't rape her.
if a woman is in a coma, don't rape her.
if a woman changes her mind in the middle of or about a particular activity, don't rape her.
if a woman has repeatedly refused a certain activity, don't rape her.

if a woman is not yet a woman, but a child, don't rape her.
if your girlfriend or wife is not in the mood, don't rape her.
if your step-daughter is watching tv, don't rape her.
if you break into a house and find a woman there, don't rape her.
if your friend thinks it's okay to rape someone, tell him it's not, and that he's not your friend.

if your ""friend"" tells you he raped someone, report him to the police.
if your frat-brother or another guy at the party tells you there's an unconscious woman upstairs and it's your turn, don't rape her, call the police and tell the guy he's a rapist.

tell your sons, god-sons, nephews, grandsons, sons of friends it's not okay to rape someone.

don't tell your women friends how to be safe and avoid rape.
don't imply that she could have avoided it if she'd only done/not done x.
don't imply that it's in any way her fault.
don't let silence imply agreement when someone tells you he ""got some"" with the drunk girl.
don't perpetuate a culture that tells you that you have no control over or responsibility for your actions. You can, too, help yourself.



If you agree, repost it. It's that important."

"event","it has been so long since i have even attempted to write in here and there are so many reasons as to why, some im not sure that i am emotionally stable enough at this point to write about, even thinking makes it so hard...  i wish there was some sort of switch that you could flick to turn off certain feelings, but the ISNT.....  so much has happened lately and i am trying to catch up with it all but i feel like i am still a hundred miles behind and just getting further back instead of actually going forward...  we have moved out, and we are living with my bestest friend from toowoomba and her partner and her little baby boy, she turned up here one weekend about 3 weeks ago and 5 days later we had a house and we were in it and now we all live together..  a bit of a adjustment on my behalf, trying to cope with living with people is one thing but to live with a baby as well???  so i jsut have to learn to live with a little bit of mess (more like alot of mess) and the noise that comes when you have children near...  personally i dont think that i could ever have children, i am so not a paitent person, i would more than likely lock it away (lol) 

i feel that i have grown alot in the last 3 months, so much has happened and yet in a way i have lost alot of myself by all that has happened, maybe a little bit of identity but i have learned that i need to keep my mouth shut and not talk about certain things or certain people, and by doing so i have watch everything that comes out of my mouth...  

i want to feel the pain physically and not emotionally, i want to see bruises and scars, that would be so much more pleasurable then trying to hide things inside, just to feel the sting of someone else slapping me, disciplining me, loving me. i know that maybe this is the wrong place to be writing this but i need for someone to be able to read what im feeling, at least then i know that it is real...  i want PAIN physical PAIN, please someone give me what i need...  
this is one of the reasons why i dont know if i am emotionally stable to write about everything, there is so much that i have done that i never ever want to tell people about, what happens in your mind that makes everyone so different to the next person, what makes us actually feel like the way i feel, why do i need to be submissive, what happened to make me this way, why do i want for someone to dominate me in every way, i knew that i wouldnt be able to supress this part of me, i knew that i could try and hide it, but that it wouldnt work cause it is what i am and i cant change that...  if anyone has any advice at all please help me...

also i have lost 11.10kg and that makes me at least smile"

also i am 21 in less than 3 weeks (should i be scared or nervous about this fact) my main fear is that noone will come to my birthday, what do i do then, well i think that i have had enough ranting for one day..."

But i have just pushed this thought ot the back of my mind cause there is  just so much shit getting crammed into my brain that i think im about to have an overload very soon...  i had a really shitty day at tafe, i have been trying so hard to get all of my advanced word finished so i can do my exam tomorrow and then the teacher decides that she is not going to do any corrections until tonight so if i have any mistakes i have to try and fix them tomorrow morning before my exam, which goes for 2 1/2 hours and we are only there for 3 1/2 hours tomorrow...... aaaaarrrrrrrrgggggggghhhhhhh... i so wish that i hadnt given up smoking, cause i really really really want one now!!!!!!! But the good news is that i got put forward for this really awesome job today, it is for a Sales Manager Position with a store called World Bazaar which is opening here in july, i really want to get it cause it sounds so good, so i should hopefully hear back tomorrow about it! (fingers crossed)

more bad news is that when i go to toowoomba next week with john, john wont have a place to stay cause my friends mum has decided that she doesnt feel comfortable with having him stay in the house but i am more than welcome to stay as long as i want !!!! what the fuck!!!!! i just cant believe it, she has known about this for like 6 months and then less than 1 week before it happens she decides to change her fucking mind, what am i going to do!!!!!

hopefully tomorrow is a better day!!!!!"

i finish tafe so soon, but it isnt soon enough, ive been thinking lately that maybe it was a mistake going to tafe, maybe it was just the wrong move for me... i just wish it was easier... !!

im so glad that i started this lj, it feels great to be able to just write stuff without people judging me about it, and also just to be able to just write, instead of letting everything get to me and become too much!!!!"

I gave up smoking 6 days ago and so far so good, but it isnt making me feel any better, health wise!!!  I just want to feel normal again!  Why cant i be like other people, happy and healthy, and with a good life!  but i know that this will never happen, so maybe i should stop even thinking about it!  

i just wish that people would start liking me for me, and not for what i do, or who i talk to, and stupid stuff like that, i am begining to feel like it would be better to have no friends at all, so that way i want feel regection....

i have to stop talking like this.....  new subject

John gets back in australia on MONDAY!!!!! and then it is less than three weeks till i get to see him... OMG  it is going to feel so strange to see him again after all this time apart. but i guess that if we can survive and grow together more while being on different sides of the world than it wont be any different to see him....

Why do i keep on getting these thoughts, even though i have been on medication since december, i wish i could just start to feel like a normal person!  I feel like everything i do is wrong and that people are always judging me!! I hate feeling like this and i just want to stop it but i dont know how too!!

even the doctors dont know what is wrong with me!  i had to go for a blodd test yesterday, to test for like heaps of things and i dont even know what they are!  they took five vials of blood from me, and then the doctor prescribed me ZYBAN and i went to the chemist to get it and it comes with this pamphlet with all of these side effects that you can have like, faintness, dizziness, seizures, etc, etc and know i dont know if i want to take them...  some one please help me!! 

and then just before i spilt coffee all over the computer and modem and i had to unplug everything, and clean it up and i was so scared that i had fucked up the computer, everything bad always happens to me, i have such bad luck its unbelievable....

i just want to drink myself into oblivion,, i hate this...

im sick of being alone, i just wish that john was with me right now and would not be oversees.  im sick of it......  what if when he gets home, things arent the same, what if he doesnt like me anymore!!  what if we have both changed and we have grown apart, i dont think i could live the rest of my life without him!"

"event","today has been a boring day i havent done much at all apart from read, but i did read two books which is quite good i guess....&nbsp; and also i only just had my first smoke in almost 2 days which i am proud of 
i have to go to the optomitriest on tuesday and then to the doctors on thursday and i am not looking forward to it, cause i know that the doctor is going to tell me to go and get a blood test to see what is wrong with me, cause i am always feeling sick, which isnt good at all but i really hate needles... oh well you have to do what you have to do!!!!
i have a party to go to on saturday, yay.. and it is paid for, we are going out to a thai resturant, yum.... and then we are going out to some clubs, maybe i will go but i doubt it cause i really hate going out to clubs unless i am drunk, cause i am very selfconcious and i cant dance to save my life!!! well i will see how i feel on the night!

i get to speak to john on tuesday,, he has been in paris since friday so i hope that he has had fun, i wish i could of gone there with him, but there is always next time!!!!well i will update more tomorrow"

"event","Why am i so god damn cold... i live in mackay and it is not supposed to get cold and here i am freezing my tits off...  Anyway i did a speed and accuracy typing test today and i got 48.3 words per minute and 98% accuracy, i was very pleased with myself cause normally i suck.  

I saw on the news tonight that there is a terrorists website that is showing the execution of an american man, i was so horrified with it, the fact that they can show that on the internet, what is this world coming too... god i hate this stupid war....

This is one of the reasons that i never ever want to have children, how could anyone bring something into this world!!!!"

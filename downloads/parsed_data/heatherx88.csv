"event","Well today was pretty boring. I had practice at 11-1:30 we were in the weight room the whole time. I benched my body weight again today and did a bunch of leg stuff and shoulder presses. Pretty cool, Im going to be so sore tomorrow. Then i came home and i had to clean my room 'cause it was annoying me, so i cleaned that and it took me all day cause i cleaned it so good. I even washed the floors. Then after i put all my pictures into a picture frames and such, then went out to dinner with the Family. Came home and watched some of Along Came Polly, But i thought it was boring so i went upstairs and listened to music.. Modest mouse is awesome. And i colored woot. Kyle called, The wrestling team got home early so he wanted to do something but my dad is a losre and wouldnt let me. Oh well. So now i am sitting here watching the BirdCage and updating my journal. Tomorrow im going to Leahs house and my mom is taking me to HCC so i can learn how to drive cause im such a horrible driver. I've driven Twice in my whole entire life and i suck so bad. Maybe I'll see kyle tomorrow too which would be pretty cool. He is awesome. He came over last night and We watched King Aurther pretty cool movie i guess. He was over my house untill about 1045 and it was just.. awesome thats all i can say really.. i dont know any other words that can discribe. I'd have to say that i am so much happier then i have ever been before. I have the best friends in the entire world, Im With this guy that has to be the coolest person, i dont know.. Things just couldnt be any better.. :) 

I think im changing my mind about Acapulco, maybe im not too much of a hick, maybe I'll go.. only if i get to bring my rocking chair and my shot gun with me;) hehe awesome im out

I had double D in the library, Kind of sucked the bitch was in there but oh well i didnt have to look at her nasty face, due to the fact me, leah, liz and caitlin were taking pictures and Kyle was in there :) Lunch came and it was pretty gross. I had to talk to matt Sanders about The oc and the tape he made cause i need to see that show. Devon was in there though kind of sucked seeing her face and all... since when is she in our lunch? oh well. But We got cotillion pictures they didnt come out so well. The group picture is funny as hell. Kyle looks like hes going to eat me, Its just a great picture of us.. Dj and Billy looking like such pimps. The picture of just me and kyle i dont really like that much.. I like the key chain picture better. but oh well. Yeah then Math class was good we didnt do anything so i just got to sit with kyle and such, And mase's class was good too did nothing. So out of the 6 classes i had today i only had to work in 2 of them. Awesome. Practice tonight though:( oh well. We might get out early just because she feels bad about not letting us watch the oc last night and not having anymore days off.. ever. So we'll see. Then i think i may be doing something with kyle.. Awesome. Me and Leah need to do something!!! and im sorry i stole your sweatshirt and im still wearing it he he"

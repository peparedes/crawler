"event","Originally posted August 25, 2005:<br /><br /><em>You ever been out fishing, and you catch a fish that you really, really like, but you have to let it go?<br /><br />I caught me a fish I really like. I look at the water. I look at the fish. I look at my cooler. I look at the fish again. I sit down and stare into the fishs eyes...<br /><br />&quot;Im sorry, fishy.  I really like you, so Im not gonna let you go.  Im gonna keep ya.&quot;<br /><br />I placed the fish into my cooler. I was worried for that fish, though. If I spent too long out there on the lake, that fish might die in the cooler. I couldnt help but think about that poor fish every minute.<br />I stood up and grabbed the cooler.  I opened the lid to see the fish in my cooler.  I bit my lip in thought.<br /><br /><br />What should I do?<br />Should I let my fishy go?<br />Should I keep it in my cooler and hang on to it?<br /><br /><br />I sat down with the cooler and closed the lid.  I glared at down at it for a while.  I shook my head.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&quot;Fishy&quot; I said... &quot;I just dont want to let you go&quot;</em><br /><br />May 23, 2009<br /><br />The fisherman decided to hold onto his fish.&nbsp; In fact, they held eachothers company for about 3 long years.&nbsp; Then, one day, while the fisherman was relaxing in his boat, the fish opened the cooler and jumped into the sea.<br /><br />&quot;Fish!&nbsp; Fishy, come back!&quot; He begged.<br /><br /> He leaped up and and reached over the edge of his boat, desperately clawing at the water.&nbsp; But it was too late.&nbsp; Fishy was gone.&nbsp; He slumped over and started to cry.<br /><br /><strong>The fisherman went hungry.<br /></strong><br />It was many months before the fisherman could bring himself to fish once more.&nbsp; After his prized fishy left him, he lost all joy.&nbsp; Fisherman do not like to fish when they are unhappy.<br /><br />While fishing, he sometimes saw his first, dear fishy swimming in the sea.&nbsp; It brought great pain to see fishy.&nbsp; And the pain was even greater when he thought of fishy with another fisherman.&nbsp; He knew fishy was happy, and it filled his heart with agony.&nbsp; Some day, fishy will go far away, to another part of the sea, with her new fisherman.&nbsp; Fishy would be happy, and he would remain sad.&nbsp; It brought tears to his eyes every time he thought of this.<br /><br />Then... one day, purely by coincidence, he met another fish.<br />&quot;I have heard of you, you fish.&quot; said the fisherman.&nbsp; The fish smiled coyly at him.&nbsp; It was a vicious smile, but the fisherman liked it.&nbsp; It was a smile that almost seemed to say &quot;Go ahead, fisherman.&nbsp; You may want me, but you will not have me.&nbsp; I&nbsp;will fight you, fisherman.&nbsp; You are bruised and battered and hungry from your last fish.&quot;<br /><br />The fisherman cast out his line and the fish snagged on.&nbsp; The fisherman battled with the evasive fish.&nbsp; The water thrashed and the boat rocked as the fisherman grunted and wrestled his pole.&nbsp; The fish started to come towards to boat.&nbsp; The fisherman smiled and gritted his teeth.&nbsp; Almost there.&nbsp; The fish was no longer fighting hard.<br /><br />&quot;I&nbsp;have done it.&nbsp; I have captured this fish!&quot;&nbsp; A sharp grin came upon his face.<br /><br />Then... without warning... the line snapped!&nbsp; The fisherman tumbled backwards and landed on his back.&nbsp; The fish swam away, laughing at him.<br /><br />&quot;How can this be?!&quot; he thought.&nbsp; &quot;I was using my strongest fishing line, and I&nbsp;thought things were going so well.&quot;<br /><br />In a fit of despair and anger, the fisherman heaved his rod into the sea.&nbsp; He had found another fish, and lost it.&nbsp; And he had no idea what happened.&nbsp; He was really starting to like that fish.&nbsp; He was a wise fisherman, though, and knew he had been defeated.&nbsp; He would never have a chance with that fish ever again, but by Christ... he sure wanted one.<br /><br />&quot;I will just lay here and starve to death...&quot; woed the fisherman.&nbsp; He laid down in the boat and covered his face with his hat.<br /><br /><strong>And the fisherman went hungry.</strong><br />"

WARNING: LANGUAGE!
In this video, I explain the concept of braking and gassing a beer bong to my friend, Liz.
She has never taken a bong before, and if you notice, she actually stands on her tippy toes instead of bending her knees as the bong empties out.
My good buddy Profator is chillin in the shower with Liz for some unknown reason.

WARNING: LANGUAGE!
In this video, Liz is bonging Vladimir Vodka. (Its worse than drinking straight rubbing alcohol for those who are unfamiliar with it)
This video is the better of the two.



PS: I dunno why, but I go into ""gangsta"" mode when Im drunk. Youll see what I mean.

It may have just been the computer I was on, but the video seems to lag some. I dunno whats up with that, and if anyone knows how to fix it... let me know.</font></font>"

I have been hesitant to buy it because SCARLETS WALK and THE BEEKEEPER where supremely disappointing to me.
I didnt want to buy it, that is... until I heard &lt;a href=""http://www.sonybmgemail.com/arch/Hit?m=qcccom9qt&amp;u=mczmt3""&gt;this song clip.&lt;/a&gt; 
It is a clip from a song called Bouncing Off Clouds.&nbsp; You should give it a listen.
Shes taking a whole new direction with this album, and some of her songs sound flat-out like rock songs.

Anywho... Im excited for the next semester of my college career.&nbsp; I have changed my major to Human Services/Social Work.&nbsp; I think I am going to enjoy it a lot, and all of my teachers have gotten amazing reviews on www.ratemyprofessor.com.
I am not, however, looking forward to this summer.&nbsp; I dont want to go back to the hospital, especially since it is so shitty and going downhill.&nbsp; It probably wont be open in another 5 or so years.&nbsp; Im gonna try to get into Wal-Mart.&nbsp; I have high ambitions in life...

And despite what Laurel thought she heard, Blue October is NOT playing in Charlotte July. :C
Thats not to say Im not going down, though.&nbsp; I do, in fact, want to see my sister.&nbsp; And maybe Blaine and Lauren lol.
Maybe it will just be me, GG, and Gina going down.&nbsp; Who knows?



Anywho, Gina burnt her finger today and is looking for sympathy.&nbsp; And she has never seen Lord of the Rings, so we are gonna do that now.

I finally got around to seeing SIN CITY last night.&nbsp; Its so much like the novels, it blows my mind.&nbsp; I was reciting lines before they were even said onscreen.&nbsp; Crazy.

"event","Isnt it odd how you can get the best life lessons from the people you have never met before?

Im sure its common sense to you all that a physical is required for enterance into a college.  Well, I had the privelage of getting my physical with a local Sports Doctor by the name of Dr. Paxson.  The man has a bit of a reputation for being zany and kooky.  I was skeptical to see him, but he was the only physician available to give me a physical.  I can thank my mom for even getting HIM to give me a physical.  Anyway...

I had the privelage of listening to his entertaining anicdotes as he rolled me around, prodded at my body, examined my muscle structure, and he even put my back into place.  He told me about his misadventures as an intern, and he told me all the good things about Edinboro.  It was difficult to take him seriously as he belted out these stories.  And it didnt help that he dug the earwax from his ear with his golf pencil every so often.

After my thrilling and inciteful exam, he gave the chart one last look over.  He noticed all the checkmarks I had.

Vision:  CHECK
Lower Back Pain:  Check
Family History of Heart Problems: Check
Depression:  Check
Family History of Diabetes:  Check

He suddenly stopped reading.


""Whoa whoa whoa, wait... whats the deal with this depression?"" He asked while diggin in his ear with his golf pencil.
""Well, a couple of years ago, I was depressed over a girl.""
""Stop right there.  I am a doctor.  In my eyes, you were not clinically depressed.""
""I wasnt?""
""No.  You were heartbroken.  There is a difference"" he said. <b>""Never confuse depression with heartbreak.""</b>

I sat there.  It had never occured to me.  It was so simple.  For the past few years I had been telling people I was depressed.  I wasnt.  It may seem like no big deal to the majority of the people reading this... but for some reason, it was a big deal to me.

""Ive been down that road before.  I was heartbroken, too.  I didnt want to get out of bed, I didnt have an appetite, and I didnt have much motivation to do anything.  I gave my all for a girl in college, and she didnt give a crumb back to me.  But, I got over it, and Im sure you did, too.""  He gave me a wink.


Well, I did get over it, and it was a good lesson learned.  I now have a wonderful, beautiful girlfriend, and she gives me all I need and then some.  I really dont know what I would do without her.





Next time you see that guy in public... the balding one with the disheveled clothes and the unmatching socks.  Yeah... that one... ask him for a life lesson... he might be able to oblige."

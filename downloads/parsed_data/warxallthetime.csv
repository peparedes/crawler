heyheyhey. i keep forgetting i have a journal. and when i remember i get happy because i dont have to make one.

the last time i updated was when i went to see senses fail. a lot has happened since then. 

me and rob go out and he is the bestest, EVER. he left a little while ago. i miss him already.

i went to work today. it was boring and busy. i kind of want another job.

tomorrow is the last full day of school. thank god. i cant wait for the summer. everyone is leaving me this year. jeff, spencer, mike, mike, mark, alex, dana. this upsets me.

wowowowowow. friday night was the best night of my life. me and dana got to starland around 6. doors didnt open til 7. her friend saw us walk up to the end of the line and let us in. we got to watch some crappy band practice but it was awesome because senses fail + a lot of other people were just hanging out. then we got VIP passes. oh yeaaaaa VIP. i sware that band is the best. + they are fucking incredible live. alkaline trio played. they werent bad at all.

today me and carly hung out. we walked all the way to the cemetery because i have to do this project for history. i dont feel like explaining. we walked about 4 miles and ended up not finding what we needed. jess picked us up and drove us home becasue shes nice like that. then we saw mark and talked to him. we came home at 12ish and my mom was drunk off her ass. goodtimes."

once again, i haven't updated in a while. i've been kinda busy. wednesday i went to the mall with dave. we were there for a whole 10 minutes, if that. then we drove around while he serenaded me. then we parked in front of some house. about 30 minuets later some car is flashing their high beams..and we are like what the fuck..then the sirens go on. so the cop said someone called the cops on us for being parked outside for two hours and being suspicious. hmm...30 minutes..two hours..close. so dave had to give him his lisence, registration, all that stuff. and the cop came back and says his registration is 5 days expiered. to make a very very long story short..they ended up towing his car, he got a ticket, and we both got a ride in the back of a cop car to my house.

thursday i worked, after school. hung out with april and ended up sleeping over. we didnt have school friday so me april carly and paulina hung out. haha. friday, adrian drove me and carly to the mall. i bought clothes and wasted all my money. i also got stuff for my mom for mothers day.

saturday, today, i went out to eat with my rents, brother and jackie. we celebrated mothers day and my jackie's birthday. thats all. night <3"

i havent updated in a while. 

kris, jeff, louie, paul, john, dani, and stephanie came over last saturday. we were going to camp out in my backyard but it took about two fucking hours to get the tent up..and it only stayed up for about an hour. and only me and jeff went in it lol. so some of them were drunk/high/whatever, it was annoying.

anyway. i hung out with dave last night. it felt so good to be with him. i like him so fucking much. of course i had to ruin our chance of being together. if i get that chance again, im not going to let anything ruin it. that kid is perfect.

i had work today, it was boring.

i'm going to six flags saturday.

joey's dad died two nights ago. me and kris were suppose to go to the wake but someone fell asleep. nice kris..realllll cute. well thats all. night <3"

i went to new york yesterday. i saw my old apartment and went to the park where i use to be 24/7. everything changed; it was really depressing. we walked about 10 miles. i thought my feet were going to fall off. i got home at 8:30ish and assed out at 11. thats pretty early for me.

i guess im not going to skate and surf because its already wednesday and i still have no tickets. i'm pretty upset about that.

i might go back in the city with carly on saturday, depending if she can go or not and depending on if i have work or not. and monday im going back in.

that's all. night."

i went to six flags yesterday with jess kris and matt. i had a lot of fun. we decided to go on the ferris wheel and we all found out how scared of heights we were. but we were able to go in the front row of nitro and stuff; makes sense. we went on a water ride and got pretty fucking wet. it was cold concidering it was about 50 degrees outside.

i'm still sick. i already went threw 100 cough drops in the last 5 days. and my body aches; i guess from the rides, walking around, and being in the sun or something. atleast i didnt get sunburnt like matt and kris.

i'm going into the city tomorrow with kris. thats all."

i deleted all my old journal entrys. i felt like making a new journal but then decided to just keep this one.

my rents went to atlantic city for three days. they left on wednesday night and just got home today [saturday]. kris kept me company since they left.

anyway..jeff came over friday night. i guess you can say saturday morning because he didnt get here til two-ish. he came with four of his friends. him and his friends are awesome. but before they came over john was over and just watched T.V. it was pretty boring. then he left at eleven and april and paulina stopped by for a little at twelve.

i still have to buy my skate and surf tickets. thats all."

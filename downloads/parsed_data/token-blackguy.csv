I am enjoying osme weight loss, less stress at work, and i just made it through a decent break up.  Stupid but true.  the other thing that is true is that i am lonely.  sooooooooooooooo lonely.  I don't like being alone, makes me remember how much i am missing out on.  Am i missing out on anything really? probably not.  but i feel like i am.  I have been doing a lot lately, but i need to stop crushing on people.  there has to be more to it than this.  I am losing it.  I wish i was stronger. how do i get stronger?"

I have really stepped up my life.  Noting what i want to change and doing just that, losing weight, getting healthy, using the heater, i am just really dedicated to making myself better. tonight was great.  I danced like crazy and i had fun.  I didn't get intoxicated either.  I am really learning to let myself breathe and be.  It says a lot when you can allow yourself to be.

This has become my life these last couple of months, it has only intensified and gotten more concerning.  I know that this is tough for all parties involved but i dont enjoy it, i cant stand it, and i am ready to end everything that is hurting me.  i know these posts are almost always emo but after so long, so much trying, so much angst, so much failure, you cant help but feel what you feel.  and what i feel right now is the worst paine ver.  

Its not like a breakup from high school where you wash your hands of it, this one is different, having to find all of the things you used to do together throughout your living space, pictures, cards, love letters, it really is a painful bleed you must endure to move forward.. I have been a wreck for the laste 2 weeks and i know that i cant change anything.. I cant do shit to fix anything, everything is done, i must accept that which i do not want to accept and there is no other option. no one cares what you want you have to deal with it.  and you have to accept it.  I dont know if i can do that. i cant do that."

Its tough to say but i wish we werent freinds, this would be much easier.  Thats not to day i dont want to be your freind, just that it makes things so difficult.  I always knew we would be freinds, i watned so badly to be your everything and your only thing, the unfortunate reality is that that was never going to work.  I thought there were things that may cause little problems, not big ones.  These are big ones and i know that our reconciliation wont be possible for a very long time.  WHY!

I cant stop thinking about yuo.  I just think and think and think.  We have enjoyed the last couple of weeks so much more than the last two years of our time together.  WTF that is not how things should be.  That is nto the way people function.  I am starting to realize though that we are not normal people.  we have our differences from everyone else and we are suffering because of who we have chozen to be.  

If it is so easy, why cant we choose to be the people who will be happy.  why is it so impossible?  I have so much pain inside and i long for your company.  This is not how my life was supposed to play out.  I know everyone thinks you moved here to be with me and that may be true but what people don't think about is why i moved here.  I moved because i wanted to be able to support a family.  I knew i needed a job to do that and it wasn't working in GA.  I made the move to be with you as well.  I thought i knew what i needed to do.  I feel so guilty cause of how we ended up, i cant let it go.  I cant stop smoking, i cant stop eating, i cant motivate myself to get up and go out and be the person i know i can be.  I cant, i am so defeated.  I wonder how long it will take to get on the positive side again.  Will i ever be there?"

"event","Im sitting here with my late night snack.  Trying to think of what is going on in my life

first, I got out of the hospital a year ago. I had no lung capacity at all and i was in desperate need of constant help.  I am glad to be out but i have a huge part of me that wants to go back.  being in the hospital was one of the scariest and most exciting things i have ever had happen to me.  Is that weird or what?

second, i am selfish in my needs.  I cant force myself to be the good caring person i once was.  I look around and wonder what i will do with myself and how is it that people cannot realize my needs?  i dont know what has gotten into me but i dont like it.  I miss my innocent times.

I have lost a sense of caring about others that i once had.  i dont knwo that i truly lost it so much as it has just never been returned to so i have exhausted all that i have had.  I dont wnat to make any rash decisions but how much longer must i put my needs on hold? where do i find the patience to wait on others vs the balls to say fuck it and move on.  

Im just tired.  just plain fucking tired and i dont get to relieve any stress.  When a normal man comes home, he gets some kind of relief.  I dotn.  i just get more fucking stress and i am sick of it.  I cant do all of your work for you.  You have to get off of your ass and do something for yourself.   and that wont change.  There is a big difference between support and doing everything you want and need.  I will support you but i cant live your life for you and fix your problems for you.  its time to be a woman about things and figure it out.  if you dont want to get off of your ass to do so thats cool too but dont be surprised with the reprecussions becasue i am reaching a boiling point.  My patience ends and thats it, cut scene, its a wrap.  I dont get them back.  I have been fair to you and done all tha ti can.  I can no longer do for you.  I deserve something to be done for me.  Either return the things that i have done and show me some love or i gotta go.  Decision is so simple and so painfully hard but this decision must be made.  and Its not mine to make...."

"event","I wish most days i could decipher the code in my mind.  I cant seem to figure out why i am feeling the way i am feeling on most day.  I am emotional, unpredictable, and just not really all that much fun.  

What is grinding through my head is all the same cluttered bullshit it has been for months now.  first there are the thoughts of the hospital, then there is the pressure of turning into a married man, then there is the need to succeed at my job and make more money.  these things i feel like drive my life.  i got denied for the credit amount that i would need to achieve one of these things.  who knows why.  so many thing that i pride myself on spawn from failures in my life

example, I am very independent and i am a problem solver.  i think outside the box and people praise me for my ability to quickly analyze and solve even the most complicated problems.  the problem with that is that it comes from a need that has been forced into me at an age that was too early fro the maturity level that i was at.  there are more examples like that it just tends to suck after a while.

Beyond that i feel like i have grown up and turned into an old person inside.  not because i don't like to have fun but as of late it doesn't really exist for me.  I haven't made quality friends in DC but i am making progress.  people always say that i can be friends with anyone but there is a clarification that is needed.  it is easy for people to want to be friends with me and become my acquaintances but often times they are more friendly to me than i intend to return.  there is just a lot of fakeness inside me lately that i cant shake.  I don't really have desire to carry on relationships with people who i don't necessarily like.  I am just a basket case
right now i am just sitting vegging out and i cant for the life of me figure out why i am so down.  how do i get out of this funk? i fall into pretty regular and deep depressions when i am alone and i don't have a drive to do anything.  gemzer told me this had happened to him and i couldn't believe that it would ever happen.  How could a person lose their drive and need for excitement.  I feel like it has been sucked out of me.  Just when i thought i was going to be fine and get to my dreams my world was crushed and i cant recover.  I am tired of whining and being upset about being in the hospital, but i cant get over it and i want too.  I want my body to realize that none of it was significant just a hiccup but it feels like so much more.  I am always considering the past and thinking how much better off i used to be in some respects.  i cant see anything that is both current and positive in my life.  I am fading and i cant stop it.  i just feel hopeless, helpless, and sad. 

I don't know where this is headed or when it ends."

I WROTE THAT WHEN IW AS RECENTLY OU TOF THE HOSPITAL AND NEVER FINSIHED IT.  WOW THAT SEEMS LIKE A LONG TIME AGO BUT IT WILL NEVER SEEM FAR ENOUGH AWAY IN MY MIND.   SINCE THEN I HAVE BATTLED WSITH SOME PAIN   killer addiction and a psyciatrick meltdown.

It begins with the need to stop pain.. that need eventually turns into a need to stop all the pain.  which transforms you into a person craving medication that you dont need. if i didnt have any control, i know i would have been much worse off.  thankfully i was able to stop my constant hunger to quell pain especially because it didnt exist.  that was one of the tougher things that i had to deal with since i have been out

next is most likely my familya nd how horrible they treated my girlfriend.  mind you it wasnt the entire fam but some of the key players.  just absolutely showed me they had no respect for what i cared about. i still havent gotten over that.  WHen i say i bust my ass for my family i mean just that.  would do anything they needed and have done it over and over.  i would think i was due the same courtesy  but they would think otherwise.  this is sa time where i would normally enter a to their credit kind of thing but today i am all about blame
fuck em

i have this absolutely horrible person that i work with at school and she just gets under my skin. unbelievable how rude she is and how much lip she gives me adn treats me like shit.  today i called her on it and i am happy i did but i feel bad i hurt her.  she doesnt have thick enough skin to be as mean as she is.  I just dont know. i can hadnle alot and it takes a lot to break me but once i reach that spot its a wrap.  hope you werent the one who made me upset ya know?

Everyone says i am really EMO on this thing and i think that is true becasue whenever i write in here its cause my life is generrally in the toilet. AKA right now when things are kind of rough.  ill get through but i will have alot of issues.  i hope god is there to help me cope...."

Reading doesnt give you the genius you need for everyday situations.  sometimes you ahve to go out and experience it yourself before you begin to understand exactly what it is that you want.  for me, i have seemed to try and fix situations that have made my life extrememly complicated.  i have been through alot of different things that have shaped me and i dont think that i want to be in pain.  i am however in plenty of pain.  i lack the abilityy to clear my own head and decipher my own code.  this has begun to make me question my exisitence.  i wish there was a way to know."

i can say that i never gave up the fight and didnt ever want to but i will also say that this fight will not end with complete blame on anyone.  it is shared very much among all parties involved.  i wont ever stop caring so thats not an option.  i believe that no one will but maybe it will take more time before the situation pans out completely.

i know you are reading this and i just want to say i hope you are well.  i dont want you to think i hate you or anything like that.  just in case we never are freinds again i hope you have a great life.  you were a great friend to me and i will never forget that.  it has been a year since we have been freinds and i was reading my posts from that time and i think it is really crazy how everything happened.  again i hope you are well

Reflection:
2008 saw some major ups and downs.  mostly downs.  i was robbed of a good friend.  the reason why is selfishness, who was selfish? not I.  i am the most likely to try and make things right amongst people i know especially ones that i care about and that are close to me.  for this year however, i will say goodbye to you and though it truly breaks my heart, you have shown me that that is what you would like.  so long dear friend, you will be missed.

i lost my drive to succeed inlife, then i got it back.

i got to spend a wonderful amount of time with my fantastic girlfriend

i lack only from withina nd i know that now so i am addressing it

i could nto come to grips with irrational thinking people though i wanted them in my life.  what kidn fo sense does that make.

for the upcoming year however there will be significant change"

you cant chang what yyou have done and it is going to be whatever it is.  so you must accept it.  i need to take my own advice and i need to do it now."

there are those times you just sit and ponder the future.  what will happen to all of the positive times that you knew and love.  will there ever be a time in the future where you feel those same feelings or are there only new ones to be felt.  i have been thinking about this a lot lately and i feel like i am realizing that the way that i felt in the past or the way i feel now may be a part of something i will never tap into again.  i don't know if anyone else has these  same feelings but i mean think about it.  you know the feeling you get when you have an obsession and then the thing that you wanted so badly comes to you and it is yours.  that feeling of being obsessed with it will never come back to you.  i guess the point is that the way we feel now wont be the same in the future.  things that we know and love we may still know and love but it will never be the way that we are experiencing it now.  we don't get to go back and though we know this we still make some of the dumbest fucking mistakes without stopping to think twice about what we are doing.  i guess the fact that things are destined to keep moving forward gives us an excuse to act like idiots.  we cant all be perfect

I can say that I have been guilty of this in the past and I am making it top priority to make sure that I know just what I have. I am constantly worried that there is something that I am taking for granted and not giving earnest appreciation to. God I hope I haven't overlooked anything. Let me make sure....
1. I miss sugar. I haven't been able to freely consume that shut in so long it is redicilous.
2. I miss my easy life. Before college and diabetes I miss living without any serious maladies.
3. I miss days off from work and not have to work 90 hour weeks.
4. I miss you. You went far away only for a few days and I feel like it has been forever. I know you are coming back but I do miss you.
5. I miss you and the times we used to share many long talks to all hours of the morning. The gunshots were fun as well and I hope we can continue to be friends and build back up what we had.
6 I miss you and all that we used to talk about. The up side is that now I have you and I can still talk to you about everything. I do miss chasing you for all of those years it was fun, it had its ups and downs and there were skeptics but they were very wrong. I love you.
7. Last but now least I miss you. You and I shared so much and I miss that friendship that we had. I would have never traded that for the world and unfortunately I didn't get to make that decision. I can't go back however and that is painful."

Not because I didn't make a ton of mistakes along the way but because I have become an awesome testimony of a truly hard life. I have been through and done a lot and this last year will be my hardest. But no matter what, my world is not over. My life goes until my heart stops and I am thankful that i'm still ticking.

On a majority level I think that how the music affects us is the largest part of our enjoyment.  If I hear something and it has absolutely no effect on my mood of general demeanor, I donl,t think the music was good at all. When I went to loca Luna on Monday, there was a great charge in the air around the band. They were highly anticipatted by all of the people there and just that feeling let me know it was going to be a great show. As soon as they started I was out of my seat. Moving around and dancing to the best was just as natural as breathing. I noticed quite an array of instruments as wwll. The guitars were there just like in any other band but was really amazing was the appearance of two people in the percussion section. Not only was there someone on a drum set but there was also a person who was strictly on the percussion section. Just like Raphael showed us in class, the percussionist changed his instruments between each song. What was absolutely amazing about the experience was how everyone just juved with one another. There was absolute congruency all around and people who were in attendance could feel this. Even there it wasn't like a packed out night, everyone who was there was having a great time. I am very glad I had the chance to attend this concert"

People just getting up and leaving and I am sitting here so hungry and so tired that I can barely post this. The kid next to me just started snoring. Man life is weird.

       In other news I feel like there are people out there who lack the maturity level that they need to lead their lives. Not being nice to those that are nice to you creates a bad sense of feeling and will cost you later on in life. I feel lie a cause of this often comes from not getting the discipline needed when you are brought into this world.  I am not saying its horrible parenting but rather some of the stresses that we acquire as life goes forward. One of the largest and most devastating occurances, is divorce. When divorce comes into play, the children lose. The parents stop parenting and go into panic which allows a child to get freedom to early. I got it and lost control but I was old enough to catch myself. Though I did I feel like I still am out of control. I have a sense to do whatever the duck I want and though I am old enough, I still lack a sense of responsibility. I will find it and I will survive. I hope the same happens for everyone who needs it."

i'm scared shitless.  no one knows what i am afraid of. no one.  i have been scared for a long time since my mom told me about it in the beginning. it didnt hit me till i saw it this weekend though.  i have a limited amount of time to deal with it and i think that is what scares me the most.  i am not readyu for it to be a reality so its time to do something.  i am on my own on this one."

       i am not here to try and make everyone enjoy their time on this earth, i could give a fuck.  alli know is that i am going to do what i want to do that makes me happy and glad to be on the planet.  there is nothing else that you can do but give happiness an honest attempt.'  
       dont shit talk people. sure it feels good to get what you want to say off your chest but at the end of the day did you help someone with what you said or were you just bitching to hear yourself? a huge thing that i am currently learning is the beauty and neccessity of is not wasting time brooding over whats wrong instead of either fixing it or in the instance that is not possible, moving forward to find more positives.  you and i and everyone who reads this and everyone else in the world will eventually have to face the music.  its inevitable. are you doing what you want to right now? are you living for happiness or are you living to be better than others? look at what you have and cherish it.  think about what you would do if you didnt have it and whether or not that is what you really want.  
       before you react to what i am saying, i encourage you to take time to really think about what i am saying.  dont blame others until you have blamed yourself in every possible instance.  not saying you are wrong but have you acutally assessed the situation. 
      the biggest problem that everyone has is a lack of view.  we see through our own narrowed vision wihtout considering what others may see.  if you say you have you are probably lying to yourself becasue it takes a vast amount of time.  
    i currently am attempting to look from all angles at the situations within my own life.  the good the bad and the ugly, it all needs a fresh view in my eyes.  time it will take and that is exactly what i will grant it.  its much mroe important to understand my life and what i am doing than to make someone else temporarily happy. give me time and give me peace. i will do the same for you

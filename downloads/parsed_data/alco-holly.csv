"event","I'm sorry to say that graduation was not the happy reunion I had hoped for. Yes, I got to see everyone, but things didn't go as planned. My family planned to leave me at my cousin's for the evening and return to Ottawa the next day to pick me up while they stayed with my grandma in Almonte. Everyone had all these great plans to go out on the town and have fun, but once the ceremony was over, it was almost impossible to find anyone again. All the grads plus their families made for a LOT of people in the building's foyer. Thankfully I managed to get in a few pictures there and dragged some friends outside to get some more. Before I knew it, however, everyone was gone. It was all pretty disappointing really. I ddin't get any calls back until I had already returned to Almonte with Mom and Dad. They weren't about to leave me in Ottawa alone with no solid plans. So all and all, grad was not the day I had been expecting. The rest of the trip to Almonte went fine. I got to see cousin Rudy again and when we stopped in Westport for ice cream, Peter Milliken was in line behind us. 

Since teacher's college has let out, I returned to RH to do more volunteering in both Mrs. H's and Mrs. H's kindergarten classrooms. They were more than happy to have me back. I also returned to my yard duty position, but it was different from expected. Instead of working the primary yards as usual, I was asked to do intermediate. It broke my heart every day when my kindergartners would ask ""Are you on our yard today?"" and I would usually have to said no. There were the odd days where we were short staffed and I would fill in on the primary side (which were always my favourite days). Every afternoon I would stay in the classroom with them and things (usually) went smoothly. It was funny seeing all my kids again another year older. I was reunited with Towards the end of the school year, Jill asked if I were interested in volunteering at her school too. I agreed and most days I would be in a 2/3 split class or another kindergarten class (who were the most adorable, well-behaved children). There I was best friends with L. who was autistic. I would either help him with work, read with him or just play cars with him. He LOVED cars. It was a busy time getting myself from school to school, but the kids were always happy to see me. There were tough days (and irritating kids) for sure, but the school year was over before I knew it. This year I worked the community barbecue again, and (gasp) actually got to enjoy it too. I signed up to sell drinks outside, which would be cooler if nothing else. A student came to help me out and relief eventually came once Mom got there. We got to walk around the school and I finally got to point out a lot of the kids I worked with.

The only downfall of the end of the school year was the end of any pay checks. I didn't expect to have a teaching position right out of university, but I was hoping to a job. Any job. During May and June I must have applied to more than 15 jobs with absolutely no responses. As much as I loved the free time, I missed the money too."

"event","Officially we're not done our classes, but most of us have already handed in our final assignments and, therefore, are ""done"" teacher's college. Next week is all about goodbyes and such. We actually have a lecture for kindergarten, a potluck in art class and a presentations in exceptionalities. The good part is that nothing is really expected of us, all we have to do is go. 

This week was pretty busy. On Tuesday we wrote our entire social studies assignment in one go. It went pretty smoothly and I just reused some material from practicum to help me out. That night we had our Section H farewell at Mexicali Rosa's. I think more than half of us showed up so it was a good time. Some of us continued at the Blue Cactus, but they weren't happy that we were only there for beer. On Wednesday I was finally able to go to the physio about my sciatica. Long story short, the pain is coming from my back so I need to strengthen those muscles to prevent further pain. I'll be going back twice next week and I already feel much better. Thursday was a long day, it was the final presentation for out social action project. We had our resource pack bound at Ashley's work and I made the poster board. Once we were evaluated we found out that we had a 96 final. That is...pretty good. After finishing our last homeroom class (getting back our binders and letters to ourselves written at the beginning of the year) we finished our kindergarten assignment in the LRC. That night (being St. Patrick's Day) we went to Esther's for some drinks before heading down to the market. We didn't do too much though, as none of us wanted to stand in line to get in anywhere. We picked up a few some downtown and went back to Esther's for the rest of the night."

"event","I can't believe how quickly this semester is panning out. In a matter or weeks I'll be done classes, doing practicum and returning home to Kingston. I'm actually feeling pretty sad about this. I'm just very happy about the way things are right now and don't want them to change. I'm happy living in Ottawa, attending class and hanging out with my friends here. Sadly, I knew it had to come to an end.

The last few weeks have been exciting. During the family day weekend, Mom and Dad came to visit me at my apartment. It was the first time they actually got to see it when it was fully furnished. They dropped me off here in September and helped me set up a few things, but they finally got the tour that weekend. I made them some lunch and then convinced Mom to make a trip to Ikea (it was not very hard). After, Ryan and I followed them in their car to Almonte, where we had dinner at Nanny's with John and Jocelyn. 
The next day they joined us back in Ottawa for Winterlude. My skates managed to hold out for half the skate, but sadly were euchred by the end. We visited Jesse, Kevin and Stephanie while they were working a booth on the canal. Part of the booth was making flip books by dancing in front of a camera for six seconds with props. They turned out to be very funny. Afterward, met met up with Nanny, John and Kelly at Prescott for dinner. Ryan and I spent the rest of the long weekend cooped up in the apartment playing video games (and me working).

<lj-cut text=""Lots more updates about life..."">

This weekend Caroline came to visit me in Ottawa! It was so nice to make the plan and really follow through. The weekend started at Esther's, who had us over for the Sabbath dinner. She and her roommate made a delicious dinner and it was just so fun to be with each other. I left later in the evening to meet Ashley who was coming with me to pick up Caroline. When we returned to Esther's, it had turned into a full-blown party. Many of the Section H girls, more of Esther's friends and Phil showed up to join us. It was cool to finally introduce Ashley to the people I talk about constantly. We had a few beers and failed hard at beer pong before calling it a night. 
The next day Caroline and I hit the Rideau Centre for some shopping and vegged out for the afternoon. Ashley joined us and we ordered out for dinner, had some drinks and got ready for the evening ahead. We hit the town for some dancing and eventually wound up at the Cabin downtown. It was incredible dead when we got there, but thanks to our new friend Rob, we had a lot of fun. He got us up and dancing for the band playing in the lower portion of the bar. I especially liked when the band asked for requests and someone said ""Summer of '69"" and the guitarist replied, ""Fuck you."" Secondly, I liked when he said ""I think I heard someone request Brown Eyed Girl from a kilometre away..."" We later went upstairs for some good quality dancin' and we found a trend among the clubgoers there. You either had to wearing a plaid button-up shirt, very revealing clothing, dressed and make up like you're from Jersey Shore or a complete douchebag in sweats. It was quite a scene. Our friend Rob found us and bought the next round of drinks. His friend Sarah told us that he was ""rich."" I think they were also each other's wingman as they both did fairly well with the opposite sex. Later on, while we were exiting the bathroom, we were front row to a bar fight that happened. After witnessing many lude and completely inappropriate actions at the bar we decided to head home. Ashley stayed also that night for a total girly sleepover.   
We spent Sunday recovering and eating much junk food before taking Caroline back to the bus station. A very good weekend overall!

Time is just going by so quickly. In fact, Hamida is giving the office our two month's notice of moving out tomorrow. I just wish it could all stay this way a little longer..."

"event","School has been good so far this semester. I like (most) of my classes. Kindergarten class is adorable. Our teacher starts every class by teaching us a song and we sing it together. The information we get is actually useful too, unlike other classes. Tuesday's art class is obviously my favourite. Today we got to make wire figurines and I chose to pose mine in a swimming position, complete with snorkel and mask, swim trunks and seaweed. I am very pleased with him. Wednesdays is Exceptionalities class, which is pretty good. The teacher is cool and cracks jokes with us. Thursdays are pretty boring and are my least favourite day of the week. Schooling and Society is by far the most boring with lecture and tutorial in the same day. We also have homeroom again. Friday is gym class, and, is really fun. We get to run around the gym and play lots of games. We play more than being taught, but I think it's working out really well. I feel a lot more confident about gym than before. Anyway, good stuff.

Last weekend Ryan came up to celebrate our five (gasp) year anniversary. We didn't do anything special, I just failed miserably to cook him anything good for dinner. Saturday we visited his aunt to pass on Christmas presents from his family. Coincidentally, I'm being placed in the same school as his cousins this March so I asked about my mystery teacher. Apparently she doesn't have her own classroom since she is a subject-specific teacher. Subjects? English, French and Math...all the way up to grade eight. I'll have to wait until I actually contact my teacher to get the real story. All I know is that I do not look forward to grade eight math if I do have to teach it...%100. Erg.
Saturday night was also Jesse's birthday party and I guess Ryan and I arrived a little late. Most people were already liquored up when we got there, but we sang a round of Happy Birthday when I revealed my hockey rink cupcakes. We had fun that night and I'm really glad Ryan got to meet all the people I talk about. I feel it might have been a little overwhelming for him, and I'd like him to meet them when there is little to no alcohol involved. I also informed him not to be offended if I should be called ""hooker"" by anyone at the party.
Sunday was very relaxing. Ryan and I went out for breakfast and for some morning shopping...like an old couple. I got the art supplies I needed for my project and we walked around Toys R Us ""pretending"" to look for gifts for some relative we had. I need a young child to buy toys for. Or myself. Toys these days are pretty sweet. 

I've been sticking to my resolutions so far this year. I've done a lot of art (mostly because of art class) and keeping a sketchbook. I've been relatively healthy. I joined a yoga class at the university and have been going every Monday. (By the way I <i>cannot</i> stand on my head like my freakish other classmates). I enjoy the class. I feel like I get the exercise I need as well as keeping my sciatica under control. I do not want to relive that. I am also keeping up with my extracurricular reading. Comic books count, right? Shut up, they do so."

"event","This year I've made a few resolutions. First, like any other year, I plan to be more healthy. That includes being more conscious of what I'm eating and getting more exercise. When having an appointment about my sciatica, he recommended I do more stretching to increase my flexibility and help me to prevent it from happening again. So Ryan has shown me some stretches and I've also signed myself up for yoga classes at Ottawa U. Aside from health, I'd like to do more art and reading than last year. I really do love both, but my laziness has kept me from actually following through with either. Hopefully I keep all my resolutions this year.

New Year's eve was fabulous. Brant and Erica had a party at their new house and it was great to spend it with everyone. They had the Kinect there and we had a lot of fun playing with this dancing game. It was especially fun as the night went on and the drink kept pouring...We got to count down the New Year watching New Kids AND BSB singing together in Times Square. The girls got a kick out of that. Later on we turned the kitchen into a dance party and there I spent the majority of the night. I brought my entourage to the party (Ryan, Ashley, Danielle and Feeney) and I think everyone had a blast. That night I went home with Ryan and in the morning his Dad cooked us up blueberry pancakes and bacon. Fabulous end to the party.

New Year's day Dad and I went to the Fronts game as part of his Christmas present. The game was good and we headed over with Mom to Karen's after for a little visit. The rest of the break was pretty relaxing, just be lazy around the house. I left Monday night with Ashley and Feeney and we barely had room for the three of us and all our stuff. Thankfully Ashley was able to help me carry it all up to my room. I never would have been able to do it on my own. 

I felt sad to leave Kingston again, but easily adjusted back to Ottawa life. The first week of school went by pretty quickly (not because it started on Wednesday). This semester will be a little different and not all of us will have the same classes. On Mondays I have my elective, All Day Kindergarten, and everyone else's are all over the place. I've at least confirmed that others are in that class with me though. On Thursdays we're with our homeroom group all day and actually have a lecture-style class. It feels so strange to sit in an auditorium again and be a nobody. I prefer the smaller classroom with just our section. Friday was particularly interesting. I was expecting to go to social studies, but that class would also be phys. ed. What I didn't realize is how we'd actually be <i>participating</i> in gym class. We spent two hours playing games in the gym. It's so fun that everyone gets so into the games. It was a lot of fun and we get to do it every Friday."

"event","Can't believe I've kept this tradition alive as long as I have. It's been another hell of a year with the end of my undergrad at Queen's, working for R.H. and starting teacher's college and my new adult life in Ottawa. Once again, let's see who made the list of my most favourite and memorable quotes of the year. [drum roll] In no particular order...

10. ""David wipes at paintball!"" - Jed
Your wedding is supposed to be one of the most memorable days of your life. As David, the groom, was giving his speech during the reception, a rather intoxicated Jed yelled this out. (It has to do with a paintball game we played years ago, where David is caught on film cheating at paintball. He was wiping the paint off of his clothes after being hit). Thanks Jed for making that happen. 

9. ""She was like a baseball field and he kept throwing 'em into her."" - Ashley
During a nice night out at the club, we enjoy going dancing. That night we went to The Grizzly Grill and one particular couple were pretty much having sex in the corner. When we were explaining our night to Jill after, Ashley said that.

8. ""Did she just say ejaculate?"" - Michelle
It was another boring class on Spanish grammar and, as per usual, everyone was spacing out and not listening to the lesson. Now, in grammar, ejaculate is something completely different from...the other thing. According to Google, it is ""an abrupt emphatic exclamation expressing emotion,"" not...the other thing. Said to a room full of spaced out students...and the emphasis put in the wrong place, resulted in mass, utter confusion. 

7. ""Guys, skills is spelled with a ""z"", right?"" - Devaugnh
During a science class at school, we were doing our jigsaw project where each member of the group was collecting information to tell the rest. When reporting my share of the info, I mentioned the words ""skills."" This was also in the beginning of our ""talking like rappers"" phase. So Devaugnh paused and asked this in a perfectly calm and serious tone.

6. ""Do you know anything about 'comme'?"" ""Of course I do."" - Kiera and Michelle
In the winter semester at Queen's, Kiera took a french linguistics class. She had to write about the use of the word 'comme' in French. She was so frustrated with the project she openly asked us if we knew anything on the subject and if we could help her. The word, sounding the way it does, proved to be entertaining. 

5. ""Do I ever say anything stupid?"" ""You asked me how to spell 'job' yesterday."" - Danielle and Mike
I forget the exact context of this line, but while staying in Scarborough with Danielle, we were taking the public transit around Toronto. We may have overhead someone else say something dumb, but the conversation was definitely around that topic. 

4. ""One, two, three, all eyes on mah PUSSAAAAH!"" - Jesse
During our lessons at teacher's college, we learned lots of ways to get a class' attention. The actual line goes ""One, two, three, all eyes on me"" but Jesse changed it up to get our attention during a group project. [Note that this quote was repeated many, many times and the speaker must raise their eyes and shake their head when saying ""mah pussah""!]

3. ""I come early in the morning and stay late afterward! I prep, do the work and work my ass off. And after he just leaves and is like, <i>see you tomorrow</i>. See you tomorrow??? Screw you!!!"" - Jenny
I won't list the details, but Jenny did a lot of ranting this semester at school. And I loved her for it. 

2. ""Did he use MacBeth? Nope! Hamlet! No! Fucking Tremors!!!"" - Brant
During Brant and Erica's Jack and Jill party, a rather intoxicated Brant was explaining grade 9 English at QE. Apparently Fowler used to use the movie Tremors as a means to teach foreshadowing. The beginning of the movie? Kevin Bacon wrapped up in his sleeping bag and being shaken out the back of his truck. ""AND HOW DID THE LAST TREMOR DIE??? BY FALLING OFF A FUCKING CLIFF!"" I enjoyed my lesson on foreshadowing. 

1. ""What are you <i>doing</i>?"" ""I'm break dancing...BECAUSE I DON'T CARE!"" - Kiera and Selim. 
What a wonderful day of school that was. I think the Posse was waiting around outside and making plans about when and where we were going to meet up later. As Kiera was explaining the plan, she was distracted by Selim's dancing which told her that he...did not care for what she was saying. 

Another year down, another year full of memorable quotes. It upsets me that I know there are so many more, but I can't remember them! I must make the resolution to keep better records of my quotes for next year."

"event","It's been a while since I've done any updating. I just finished my first practicum experience and the whole thing was a great experience. I had an unusual situation first off, a 3/4 split class, but with two separate teachers. I was placed with Mrs. L. the grade 4 teacher along with Katie, another student teacher. I only learned about a week before placement that I would have a partner in my practicum experience. I liked the idea, about someone I could confide in, vent with and do the work together with. There was a meeting for all students in my situation before practicum, but believe me, they were not as accommodating as Katie and myself. We both got along from the start and were able to work well with each other. She's in another section of the program, but now that I'm back at school, I see her around the building. Anyway, we were both placed with Mrs. L. Jenny, also from my section was placed with Mr. N., the grade 3 teacher. Now that made 5 teachers in the classroom of 29 students (16 of which were grade 4s). It was an interesting start for sure.

Now the 4s were very well behaved. Mrs. L. told us she dealt with any behaviour problems first and settled them early. The 3s on the other hand had more behavioural students. Each morning they left for the library to do their lessons in math, language and social studies. During the afternoon, when we had art, drama or gym, both classes came together. 

It was easier settling in than I thought. I thought I would have trouble addressing the class since I've always been pretty nervous public speaking. I felt fine though, and teaching was a little nerve-racking at first, but I quickly got into it and taught every day. Katie and I started with language. The content was fairly easy and executing lessons was the same. It wasn't until the third week that I started teaching math. Other than familiarizing myself with the material again, I didn't find it as stressful as some professors stressed it would be. Katie took the math lessons during the final week. Jenny, Katie and myself made an art lesson making posters for the Remembrance Day assembly and we always shared the responsibility of gym class. <i>That</i> was what I found difficult. Gym doesn't have the same structure as the classroom, nor did I know the grade 3s as well, so running the gym classes was fairly stressful.

Altogether it was a good experience. I got along with the other staff in the school and even participated in an after school Spanish class run twice a week. The Spanish teacher, L., was very enthusiastic for having me there (even though my Spanish is not so great). Mrs. L. marked both my reports well, and I did pass the course in the end. The experience felt a little weird...paying the university to go and work for free? But it's all about getting the experience, I know.

<lj-cut text= ""And...more."">
During my last week of practicum, my leg started acting up again. I felt like it was only a matter of time since I was suddenly walking 50 minutes a day plus standing all day. This time, however, it hurt more than ever, sending sharp waves of pain up my leg whenever I moved it the wrong way. For the most part it was moving around in bed or trying to get into a car seat. Otherwise, I was limping everywhere I walked. Ibuprofen didn't seem to help much with the pain, but I assured myself that if I could last the week then I could finally relax and focus on getting better.

Finally the week ended and Ryan was coming to visit. He wouldn't mind if we had a lazy weekend anyway. But...that night my leg flared up more than ever and I decided to go to the after hours clinic on campus. All the could do is recommend I see a physiotherapist and tell me to take some Aleve. It seemed like a good idea...until about an hour an a half later. I had decided to change into my pyjamas and crawl into bed, until my leg got phenomenally more painful. Walking, standing, sitting, didn't matter. It was more painful than ever. ""Do you want to go to the hospital?"" asked Ryan. Yes. Yes I did. I managed to shuffle myself down to the lobby and into Ryan's car (BT Dubs, Ryan has a car now). We got into the hospital quickly and waited for the doctor. She was nice and offered me nice pills that made me feel much, MUCH better. I slept for a while there until we could be sure the medicine was working. Ryan and I didn't get to bed until fairly late, but it was well worth going.

For the rest of the weekend I felt much better. I could walk again (to a point) and even went out for dinner in celebration of Ryan's birthday which was the past Wednesday. We went with Ashley and Anthony to The Works, a burger place where you can get the most delicious or the most bizarre toppings (like peanut butter and cream cheese). We came home for the night and since then I think I played Xbox until Ryan left on Sunday.

Monday I got off since our teacher moved our class to Wednesday. It was well spent resting and working on some of the practicum things I had left right to the end. Tuesday was really nice seeing everyone again and we all got to tell our stories. We head good things, strange things and down right horrible things about each other's experiences. 

Wednesday DeS took us to the National Art Museum. It <i>would</i> have been fun if we were able to go off on our own. Instead we had a guide, which was fine, but we only looked at THREE paintings then had to leave. It was like...4 bucks a painting. I wish we had gone earlier so even when class was over we would have been able to actually see the place. Instead we went right at closing time so there was no time to explore. :( Museums are free Thursday evenings so I should go sometime.
</lj-cut>

Other than practicum, school has been cracking down on the assignment work, before and after practicum. It's right back to the grind again. My marks so far have all been fabulous, so I'm not worried about the following weeks. It's only another few until the Christmas break! And for the first time I have absolutely NO EXAMS! Yes!"

"event","It's closing in on a month since I left home and you know what? I've found it surprisingly easy. All summer I'd been exciting and dreading the thought of leaving home and all the homesickness I would feel. But...I don't feel it at all. Maybe I really was just ready to leave. I'm just really happy to come back to the apartment after a long day and just relax in my room. I love it so much. 

Though I do miss Mom and Dad of course. And my cats immensely. I came home a few weekends ago for Brant and Erica's wedding and spent almost all of Friday night playing with Lucy and Dinah. They looked at me if they were saying ""Finally! Where were you all this time???"" It was a very busy weekend though. Erica and I had arranged that I would make Katamari cupcakes for Brant to display at the reception. I spent the morning doing running around, afternoon baking and decorating then finally getting myself ready for the wedding. The wedding was held at the Little Cat Conservation Area (which was a really cool idea) and the ceremony was held outside of the main building. Everyone looked great and Erica's dress was really amazing. It even had pockets! After the ceremony was over Mom and I quickly got the cupcakes set up and Brant and Erica really enjoyed them. I spent the night mostly dancing with some of the girls (and Jason). Everything turned out very well.

School has been pretty cool. I have a lot of assignments to do, but a lot of them require group work. I've made a group of friends, six of us together, who do a lot of working and hanging out together. It makes school a lot less stressful when we work together (or rather, not work and start a rap battle instead). It started in the library as us being hilarious and escalated to a duel between myself and Jesse. There is no declared winner yet. As a result we have been speaking like gangsters for the last 24 hours. We tried reading kid's books in Language class, but we just read them like raps. It was a problem and I don't think the prof really liked it. 

Yesterday we had an excellent science class. We had a guest group working with us and they split us into groups for three activities. First we built balloon cars that we raced down the hallway (De-von and I won of course). Next we returned to the classroom to make a craft with our hands. We constructed the bones of our hands with straws and thread string through the bones that acted as the tendons. Finally we went outside where we made miniature rockets with film canisters, baking powder and water. I love when people walk by and are so jealous of what we're doing. We had a blast...no pun intended. 

Ashley and I hang out frequently and make dinner together. We've been getting in the habit of making dinner and watching Glee now. Ryan was able to come up for his firefighting test and he thinks he did well. It sucked that it was a day where we were both so busy and didn't result in much hanging out together. Not long after he got himself a brand new car, which I have yet to see. It's a black Kia Forte. No more waiting around for a car. He can leave whenever he wants to now (which will hopefully mean he comes to visit me).

In other news Dad informed me that it's less than two months until Christmas...like he even needed to say that. I'm so excited that I get to leave immediately when school is over. I don't have to stay, study or write any exams! Woohoo! (But I also don't get any reading weeks. Yeah, starting this year, Ottawa U gets <i>two</i> reading weeks. Not that it matters to me. It's only because there's so much to cover in one year). Anyway, I'm looking forward to the holidays! I should be more concerned with Thanksgiving, only in another week or so. I've got to get cracking on my new cupcake idea..."

"event","So I've already finished my first week of living in the big city and teacher's college. My orientation day started early Tuesday morning. I met a few people that day and even ran into some familiar faces. We started with a meeting of all the PJs and we were introduced to the teachers and staff. We were promised a pizza lunch and by noon we were all starving. I don't think I could have scarfed it down any faster. Then we had an afternoon meeting of our homeroom class to meet our prof and go over the course.

Living on my own has been fun. I like having my own space, eating when I want, when I want, not having to report everything I'm doing, not being nagged if I choose to spend an entire afternoon watching tv...it's been pretty good living. I've spent a lot of time with Ashley this week. We've had dinner, gone out to a comedy show and done some VV shopping. Even without a car, getting around hasn't been too hard with the bus. It is LEAGUES ahead of Kingston. I can leave whenever I want and there's almost always a bus available to take me.

My classes this week have been good. I've only had two but I seen to have already made a small group of friends (which is really, really nice). Everyone seems to be pretty nice, I can talk to anyone. I had my PJ math class yesterday <i>at 8 in the morning</i> but I had a lot of fun working with the other kids at my table. One girl was even in my math class last year at Queen's! It's just so funny how even at another school I know people.

Mom and Dad are not used to having an empty house, they say. It's so much bigger and quieter when I'm not there. And the cats seem to be confused about there being one less person. I miss my cats SO MUCH. When I go home next weekend I'll probably spend the entire Friday night petting them. I'll be going home for Brant and Erica's wedding (for which I have a special surprise...). This weekend I'm going to a potluck at Feeney's place and then going to the Stittsville flea market on Sunday. Apparently they have a wicked selection of kids books among other things. Should make for a good weekend!"

"event","Last night was Brant and Erica's Jack and Jill party out at Jason's place in Harrowsmith. The party had been named ""SHITFEST 2k10."" I snagged Ashley as my date again and we had a fabulous time. There were party games and a flip cup tournament. We also had a large campfire, bar and dinner. As the night went on most of us were pretty drunk, but I think Brant stood out a lot. He launched into an all out rant about how Fowler from QE used to use the movie ""Tremors"" as the perfect example of foreshadowing. ""Did he use MacBeth? Nope! Hamlet? No! Fucking Tremors!"" His rant came to a close when he made a plan of cooking up a ton of bacon in the morning and watching all three movies then Derek reminded him that he had borrowed the movies. I also did an impression of Tremors 2 that made Brant pee his pants a little. There were a few guest appearances from Josh and Johnny Woo who I hadn't seen in a lifetime. 

This morning was pretty rough on some of the boys. That's all I'll write about that. Jason made up some delicious breakfast for those who decided to stay. We had a ton of bacon, toast and a Kraft Dinner/Hamburger Helper concoction. It really hit the spot while we watched Jurassic Park. After a little hanging everyone slowly packed up and left. 

On Friday night we had a little throwback and Ashley, Sherrie and I went out for the night for a Rideau Heights reunion. We made our first stop at The Brass where we hung out with Shayna and her friend Melanie. Next we stumbled around until we got to the Toucan for some more drinks. I was feeling like dancing so we headed back up to the Grizzly Grill and met up with Jessica on the street. Then it really was a reunion. We danced later on until closing and hung out on the street with all the other people who weren't ready to go home. On the taxi ride home we also had a sing-along with the driver.

<lj-cut text=""And now to fill in some of the gaps...""/>
My birthday week did not go as planned. We got rained out for Picton and instead I made up my own birthday cat cupcakes and stayed in. Mom, Dad, Ryan and I did go to Picton on the Thursday when the weather was much nicer. They were perfect conditions for a beach day. Later on the weekend, our Water Safari trip didn't turn out. We put so much time into deciding whether or not we would go (the weather being nice enough and everyone having the time off) that no one actually booked a motel room in time to go. In the end, we had the insurance to go and instead took a day trip to Watertown where we visited the zoo, the fabric store for Mom and the grocery store for me. I think my birthday present was ten boxes of cereal. Such...good...cereal...Then we went to Alexandria bay for dinner which was really nice. We went to this Italian restaurant and sat out on the patio and left just in time for some biker gang that had just arrived. When we had stopped at the duty free to ask questions about our purchases, we had a minor heart attack. Mom had lost her passport. It wasn't anywhere in the car or her bags so she went back inside to check. She was very lucky to find it where she had dropped it on the floor. 

At the end of July, Ashley, Feeney and I traveled to Scarborough to finally visit Danielle and Mike in their apartment. Feeney stayed for the first night and we dropped her off in downtown Toroto for her to catch her train back home (she had the week off work and had come with us that far). After we took a bus to Carabana, a huge parade with tons and tons of people watching. It was really fun, but getting out was much harder than getting there. We took a couple of street cars and met up with Lisa downtown for dinner.

I was really happy that we had arranged plans for Lisa and I to meet up the next day to go to the Harry Potter exhibit at the Toronto Science Centre because holy crap it was fun. There was also no one better I could have gone with. Even though Lisa had been already she was still very excited to go. The exhibit was full of costumes and props that were featured in the movies. The only downer was that you weren't allowed to take any pictures while inside.  would have taken at least a hundred if we could have. The best I could do was the entrance and the gift shop (aka Diagon Alley). Lisa and I later took the bus downtown to meet up with Danielle and Ashley and we said goodbye. When the three of us got home we had a homemade dinner then went to the movies.

Our last day in Scarborough we actually got to go to the Pacific Mall! I was SO SO excited I couldn't stand it. I got a few things there but wanted absolutely everything. I want to go back one day and make a whole day out of it. I'd been wanting to go since the Japanese Studies trip which was...years ago! After lunch out Ashley and I said our goodbyes and hit the road. 

Kiera made an appearance in Kingston one weekend and we met up twice to go for dinner and to see a movie. It was really nice to see her, but it made us both sad that the rest of the posse could not be there.

I'll be looking forward to the wedding next month. By then I'll have to come home from Ottawa to go. Just a few more weeks until the big move..."

"event","In most recent news, aka this morning, I officially have a place in Ottawa! Yes, my cousin Kelly recommended me to a friend who was looking for a roommate for the school year. Her name is Hamida and we'll be living right across the street from Ryan's old apartment so I already know the area. She seems very nice and I'm sure we'll get along. The apartment sounds great, I have my own room complete with a walk-in closet and my own bathroom (minus the shower)! And another plus, her old roommate is leaving ALL her furniture so I don't need to get anything! I'll have all the necessities: (double) bed, desk and dresser! It's all too good to be true!

This weekend Danielle was here to go to her sister's wedding so we went out for dinner at Lone Star with Mike and Ryan. It's hard to believe I haven't seen her for an entire year! She hadn't changed at all. It was sad Ashley couldn`t be there too, but next weekend we`ll be going to Toronto with Feeney to visit! We`re going on a long weekend so we`ll be able to stay a day later. I`m hoping to go to the Harry Potter exhibit at the Science Centre and/or somewhere else equally cool. Also there's Lisa sex store I need to see. And her. Of course.

Tuesday is my birthday and things are looking good (knocks on wood). On Tuesday we're going to go to Picton again. The weather looks favourable and I'm very happy to go. On the weekend we're going to Enchanted Forest Water Safari (Where the fun never stops) as my present. Eff, I can't think of anything better. I CAN'T WAIT to go. I love it so much."

"event","Yesterday I got my wisdom teeth out. It had its ups and downs.

It started off with the worst sleep I'd ever had. It was so hot in the house I barely got any sleep at all, plus I was worried about the morning. When I did get up my stomach was in knots. I was happy at least that my appointment was first thing in the morning and I didn't have to worry about it long. 

After waiting a few minutes I was brought into the surgeon's office and I was prepped with the anesthestic. This was my first ever experience of it. When the surgeon asked me how I was feeling I think I mumbled ""I'd be lying if I said I was excited."" I heard a release of air and the nurse said I would feel sleepy soon. And that was it. Next thing I knew I was being walked across the hall to a recover room where I laid down with other people in the same situation. Mom and Dad met me in there and they said I was pretty entertaining since I was still loopy from the drugs. I'd never had my face frozen so I kept poking at myself and making funny noises. Only half my tongue was working and I just wanted to test my vocal abilities. On the ride home Mom laughed at me and said I was singing songs in the backseat like, ""La la la la la."" The nurse suggested I get a cold treat to help with the soreness and asked what was my favourite. ""Fwosty"" I said with a mouth full of gaz. So we did the drive-thru and I see Kerri at the window. I'm SO excited that I stick my face out the window and shout ""I got my wisdom teeth out!"" not knowing how bloody my mouth was. I just kept smiling and waving at everyone. I think I startled her pretty bad. 

I came home and relaxed the rest of the day. Before all the drugs wore off I watched Step Brothers and I was so out of it I laughed my head off. I don't think the freezing in my face completely wore off until 6 o'clock. The afternoon was rough from having an awful sleep and it still being really hot. Today I feel generally okay besides some soreness, which I expected. The blender has become a good friend lately as I make my recovery.

The end of school at RH ended well. I was both sad and happy to finish, but as much as I complained, it was the best job I ever had. Our class watched movies during the last day and much to my surprise they chose ""Dear John."" Even the tough boys were like ""Yeah, let's watch that!"" but left the second Avatar was being shown next door. It was weird. I helped Mrs. O. clean up the room and ate junk food that the kids brought in. During the afternoon Mom brought in my beach-themed cupcakes and we watched the Princess and the Frog. I was pretty happy (since I brought that movie in myself). The kids were pretty eager to get out at the end of the day (as were the staff) and some asked whether I would come back next year. I could, after my school is over. We'll have to see. 

The next day I scored an extra day of pay helping Mrs. O. clean up her classroom and doing odd jobs for other teachers. We had breakfast in the library and I even had lunch out with Mrs. O and Madame later that day. At the end of the day Mrs. O. thanked me for being in her classroom and I gave her my present: a hand-painted flower pot and a copy of The Golden Compass. She told me if I ever needed a recommendation for anything not to hesitate. And so ended my best job ever."

"event","Yesterday we went to David and Pam's wedding. The ceremony and the reception were held at the Renaissance Event Hall (which was very nice). The whole Johnson family was invited to the event and I also got a plus one. I was automatically going to take Ryan until I reminded about and he said, ""What wedding?"" He had already made plans since his grandparents from Nova Scotia were coming. I ended up taking Ashley instead and she was a fun date. After the nice ceremony we headed over to Karen and Ryan's (who lived just around the corner) for drinks and snacks. It was great having everyone together: Mitchell (who came from Oshawa), Karen, Ryan, Erica, Emily, Jason, Jed, Cheryl, Ashley and myself. We came back to the hall just in time for ""cocktail hour.""

Needless to say, by dinner we all had a buzz on and our table was pretty rowdy. The boys were frequently yelling things out during speeches or otherwise. A particularly drunk Jed yelled out ""David wipes at paintball!"" during his speech referring to David cheating once at paintball all caught on video. The dinner and dessert was all very good, I just couldn't eat it all! Once speeches and dinner was over we started the dance. I would be very disappointed if no one danced at my wedding so I was happy to see people, young and old, tearing it up (including Mom and Dad). We stayed and danced until the last song, not before dancing the Cha Cha Slide and screaming our lungs out to Journey's ""Don't Stop Believing."" There was discussion about continuing the night downtown, but ultimately we were tired (the ladies from standing in heels all night) from the long day. Before we called it a night though we got a group picture which we called Leadership 2010 since we were all sitting on the stairs, just like all the other pictures.

RH is quickly coming to a close as there is only a week and a half left of school. I weaseled my way into an extra day of pay for coming on the P.A. day to help out cleaning up the classroom. On Friday we had a primary play day where the grade 8s ran stations for the entire primary division. Our class helped by leading the groups around. Which left the teachers...to sit back and do nothing. It was such a great afternoon! For the last day of school I'm thinking up some cupcakes I could do for the kids. 

With the end of school comes end of the year barbecues and some things I'd rather not look forward to. On July 6th I'll be getting my wisdom teeth out. All four of 'em. Plus, I will jobless officially as of next week. I <i>will</i> enjoy the free time, but will miss the paycheck. Maybe one of the RH staff can refer me to something..."

"event","As of Monday morning I can officially say I have a degree after four long years. The ceremony went very well. The weather was nice and it wasn't scorchingly hot outside. The night before I had picked up Caroline from the bus station and we had a sleepover. We went to the ceremony together and Mom, Dad and Nanny came later. I got to see Kiera, Michelle and Casey, a small portion of Posse de Espanol. Emilie was graduating another day. The ceremony wasn't too long. The girl I sat next kept giggling whenever one of the men on the thrones spoke which automatically spread to me. He <i>was</i> pretty funny. I tried desperately not to laugh out loud because her giggling was so infectious. Thus the laughter made me tear up and some people must have thought I was really emotional. Other than that, the diplomas were given out fairly quickly and I couldn't get a good picture of anyone. When they handed out awards, Caroline got the one for Linguistics. When I found Mom, Dad and Nanny after, Mom got a picture with Charlotte and I together. So in my Queen's lifetime, my parents met only three of my professors, Charlotte, Ms. Reeve and Chamberlain. 

After many photos, I joined Kiera, Casey, Michelle, Jeremy and parents for lunch out. I must've looked like the one orphan child going alone. I explained that we lived in Kingston and we were celebrating later that night (not that they didn't love me). Caroline came with us to Take Sushi that night and then we hung out with Gretchen and company despite how incredibly tired I was. The next day I spent the day at home and Mom and I took Caroline to the airport that evening. 

RH school has been pretty lively lately. Last Friday I heard the words I would learn to dread as a classroom tutor: substitute teacher. It was as if all hell broke loose the second Mrs. O left the room. I don`t even want to re-live it by typing the whole story out. Long story short, I am surprised at how kids act these days. Because of grad I took two days off and started the week on Wednesday. Unfortunately those same two days were part of the grade 6 testing and I only returned to help on the last day. The kids didn`t seem too bummed out about the test, and some told me that they actually found it ""easy."" We've finished a lot of our current units and have started some pretty interesting ones. The grade 5s (and I) get to learn about ancient China and in health...we get to do sex ed. Should prove for an interesting last couple of weeks."

"event","This week was pretty exhausting towards the end. On Thursday R.H. was doing its community barbecue, the same kind I went to when I was a kid. Mom stressed that I should probably volunteer because ""people will notice"" my hard work. So I spoke to the person in charge and they gladly set me up in the Games Room. Now the ""games"" were exactly the same when I was a kid, the bean bag toss into the creepy clown face, the ring toss to the painting of Pinochio. Things were alright at first, my partner was really excited to be there and the kids were extra adorable, etc. But after he left for a break and my other aides left, I was there by myself for a long time. One of the games was this simple bowling game where the pins were cheap plastic...<i>every</i> time the pins were hit they scattered all over the place, under desks and other places I couldn't get to easily. And the kids all got two throws per ticket. They just kept lining up...knocking them down...setting them up...it was exhausting. When I was finally relieved I got a funny photo with Mom and Dad and they bought me cotton candy (which was just plain awesome). 

Unfortunately for me, the very next day was track and field day. I hate track and field day. I was hoping to maybe lead a group around with another teacher, but I ended up running the long jump/triple jump pit. Just for the record, I don't know a thing about track events so I got yelled at by students about being wrong. <i>Sorry</i>. It was extra hot and sunny too. And I <i>did</i> have water and sunscreen, but someone stole it. For my ""break"" I worked the kindergarten room for lunch where there was a substitute and the EA was away. Good. God. I had some problems while I did what I could to scarf down my lunch and return to the sand pit. The afternoon was better. The older kids knew the rules and volunteered to watch the line for faults. Then one teacher took over entirely and I took that time to die in the grass. I hate track and field day.

Despite my complaining, it's still the best job I ever had. Tiffany, the Queen's student, finished her three weeks of placement so come Monday, I'll be alone. Mrs. O said I can start teaching art on Fridays (which is pretty awesome). I've also been told that we'll be doing sex ed. soon. I'm sure that will go over well. Oh, and this week the class did a practice literacy test for EQAO and one of the girls wrote with something I taught her! Hooray! I'm teaching!

As for school, I've officially accepted Ottawa U so I'll have to move eventually. Yesterday I applied for residence and there was some confusion. I'm not the ""first year"" student they mean, but I'm not a PhD or Masters student. I selected first year anyway. I think I could live for eight months in res. I'd enjoy actually being on campus and close to everything I need (including the mall and the grocery store). Plus I'm fairly familiar with the area. Whether or not they accept me is another story. 

On June 5th (a Saturday), Creative Arts is holding its summer art show. This show is also an alumni reunion, giving anyone who took the class the opportunity to put things in the show. I'm kicking myself that I've been so lazy artistically, but I have done a lot of cupcake work. I also have a good idea come opening night cupcakes. I have two weeks to be artistic."

"event","I've just finished my second week at R.H. Everything is going very well, I haven't had any problems yet with students and they seem to be responding well to my tutoring. I have two identities in the school. In kindergarten I have always been Holly and am greeted by a swarm of hugs every time I walk in the door. In the intermediate wing I`m Ms. Johnson. It makes me feel a lot older, but professional. It`s the best job I`ve ever had.

Graduation is creeping up very quickly. It's likely to be a crazy day, trying to be with friends and family all day. Since it`s on a Monday I'll have to take a day off work to go. Typically of Queen's, you have to pay to rent your gown, as if you can't even leave the school without paying for it. I also got my grad photos back and I think they turned out very nicely. 

Yesterday Ryan and I had a yard sale. He got to keep all the money he made which went towards his firefighter's application. He was successful. My sales went towards me not being poor...or my fees for Ottawa. Either way I did very poorly, making sixteen dollars the entire day. The rest of the day we were so exhausted from sitting in the sun all day and not much else happened. It was also Tomas' birthday, but I think we'll celebrate later.

I've officially been accepted into Ottawa so I've canceled the acceptance to Trent. If I get into Queen's again I think I'll accept there. So far (after a whole month and a half) they won't tell me their answer. If I do go I`ll save a lot for residence and food and such and possibly stay in the same city as Ryan for longer than a few weeks/months. He still hasn't heard from anywhere. He's also still waiting to hear if he got a position from a physio clinic downtown. Fingers crossed."

"event","This week I started my new job at R.H. My official job description is a math and literacy tutor and I've been placed in Mrs. O's grade 5/6 class. So far it's gone very well, the students seem to like me and I get to work with smaller groups for literacy and for the grade 5 science. There are only five grade 5s, so I take them while Mrs. O teaches the grade 6s. There is also a teacher candidate in the class from Queen's for the next three weeks. She and I started on the same day. 

I'm still working the primary yard for recess so it's funny to jump back and forth between the age groups. The kindergartners were very huggy this week, hugging my legs when I enter the classroom. It's so cute!

This week was Dad's birthday so I made him some golf-themed cupcakes. They turned out well besides the ""golf balls"" which were Timbits that sat on toothpicks on top of the cupcakes. It was too hard to paint them over with icing. Yesterday I woke up and felt quite sick. I thought I might take the morning off and see where that went but there was no improvement. It was pretty much an awful day. 

Ryan is officially back as of Thursday night, but I haven't been able to see him. He's stuck sorting out all his things and with a number of chores to do. We were suddenly even going to have the garage sale today, but decided not to because of the crummy weather. That was good, I wasn't feeling up to it anyway. I wonder when I'll actually see him?"

"event","This week has been quite busy. It started on Sunday with a spontaneous ""Ultimate Frisbee"" party that Kiera posted on Facebook. According to the invitation, more than twenty-five people were expected to show up. When I got there, I met up with the five other people who had no frisbee. Kiera explained that the person who was bringing the frisbee did not show up. So instead, she, Casey and I decided to go to Red Lobster. Before we hung out by the courthouse where Jeremy, Casey's boyfriend, and his friend were chillin' playing in the illin' pipes and a fiddle. I think Casey and I ruined some tourist's photos...
After dinner we returned to Kiera's for TV, cheap DQ ice cream and a marathon of ""Who can find the funniest youtube video?"" Kiera won. ""Burrito, burrito, burrito...taco, taco, taco!""

The next morning I had a driving lesson with Joe's to prepare for my Thursday morning G road test. Things went okay, but there were some rules of the road that I didn't know existed. I spent the rest of the day studying and making my syntax cheat sheet. 

Tuesday was the syntax exam and I met up with Candice and Michelle before to compare cheat sheets and otherwise freak out about being so close to being done the class. I feel like it went okay and afterward I walked to Caroline's for our final goodbyes. :( At her house I met her Mom and they drove me home with all of Caroline's things I inherited. Caroline wasn't able to take everything back and she figured I could use it for September anyway. Our Moms got to meet, which was nice before they both set out. We said our goodbyes and agreed to visit each other in the future.

Wednesday I agreed to help Mrs. H's class for a field trip out to Amherst Island with the JKs. The overall day was not as strenuous as the Lemoine's Point trip last year. We visited a school where we became ""scientists"" and looked for bugs and plants outside. My group of boys stopped every time they saw a midge, which was about every five seconds. We had lunch at the school and had a scavenger hunt outside before taking the bus home. 

Thursday was the day I was dreading the most in years. My G road test. I was by far more stressed about the test than any exams I had to write. I felt that if I had failed, I would have lost my license since I wouldn't be able to reschedule by July. Thankfully, I got a ""ministry pass"" though the tester said I had a few problems. I can even explain how relieved I was. No more road tests for me (until I'm 80)! My geography exam was later that night and the entire exam was long answer. I think I may have gone off on too many tangents, but I finished...which meant I WAS DONE WITH MY UNDERGRAD! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

Today I renewed my license and had my new photo taken and spoke with Mrs. C at R.H. about my tutoring job. I said I was available Monday and she agreed I could start then. So...three whole days of freedom and then I'm a working woman. In the meantime, I sadly have to say goodbye to some more friends... :("

"event","Two more exams and I am done my undergrad entirely. Two more exams and I have sweet, sweet freedom. 

Ever since Christmas break was over I made a list of everything I had to do this semester. In addition, in the last couple of weeks I've been doing a mental countdown such as: last geography class ever, last Spanish test ever, last linguistic...class...(meltdown). My only (real) exams are at the end of the month so I've had a lot of time off to study, relax and see everyone. I'm excited to be done as always, but it still hasn't set in that it's for good and that everyone will be returning home soon.

So we had a spontaneous movie night. I headed over to Kiera's and we went to the store to purchase the pasta she made for us all that night. On the way back she told me, ""You know, Dairy Queen has 25 cent Blizzards..."" and I answered that it was the best thing I ever heard. We met up with Michelle and got a movie at Blockbuster and Casey, Meighen and some of Kiera's friends joined us. There was an awkward point where I knew I wouldn't be able to get home (since the buses would have stopped running) and I decided to go home early, get the car and come back. Little did I know the bus only came on the hour after 6 and I was stuck standing there like an asshole for a while. Just when the cold was setting in (and I realized I left my coat at Kiera's) I saw a familiar brown van and Brant and Erica pulled over to see me. ""Would you like a ride home?"" they asked. Scratch that. <i>That</i> was the best thing I heard all day. So it was nice to see them, get home earlier than I thought and return to the party. Meighen and Michelle had called it a night, but Kiera, Casey and I were still rearing to go. ""What is there even to do here?"" asked Kiera and I jokingly said we could go to Chuck E. Cheese. No, we didn't go, we instead made a spontaneous trip to my house (after getting Michelle again) so the girls could finally see it and meet the rents. We watched Alice in Wonderland, which is completely on crack, and faded pretty quickly after that. It was a pretty fun time as always. I think we have an afternoon of ultimate frisbee planned for Sunday.

In other news, yesterday I applied for a summer job at Shopper's, Dollarama and Bulk Barn. No one seemed very enthusiastic about it. I <i>really</i> don't want to go back to Wendy's.

Today Charlotte held her review session for syntax and I nearly got a parking ticket since she went much longer than I expected."

"event","Last weekend was Easter and it was fabulous. We got Good Friday off so I had no 8:30 syntax, no yard duty/R.H. and no gd geography in the afternoon. It was bliss. Ryan came home with Ashley the night before so I did my weekend duties before we went back to his house. He was supposed to have a relaxing weekend, but his family decided to put in hardwood floors and he was immediately put to work. I enjoyed the rest of the afternoon at home and saw Nanny when she arrived later.
Mitchell came the next night for another 24-hour visit and Lori came for dinner. Mom made a big turkey, potatoes and all the fixings and I swear we had at least seven different desserts to choose from. David, Pam and Kevin stopped by after dinner to sell tickets for their Jack and Jill/stay for dessert. I finally made my Easter cupcakes and they turned out very well. 
The <i>Easter Bunny</i> left me chocolate, rainboots and The Princess and the Frog movie. Mom said if were eight years old she would have gotten me the same present.
I took Ryan to school with me Monday to meet my friends (since he was still on vacation) and it was pretty fun. Kiera was explaining her project where she was looking at the French word ""comme"" (like) and asked, ""Do you know a lot about comme?"" and Michelle answers, ""Of course I do."" 
Ryan left again with Ashley last night on her way back to Ottawa. She'll be coming back for Kyle's birthday next weekend and I'll be returning with her because...I'll be done school.

The last couple of weeks have flown by. After spending every weekend of February in Ottawa I was happy to finally stay home and catch up on my laziness. I went with Kiera, Casey and Michelle to see How to Train Your Dragon and it was so good (especially with that crowd)! The others had decided to make it a double feature and were planning to see Clash of the Titans. I was a little tired to see two movies, but decided to stay with them until it started. After maybe half an hour we walking around the theatre to find where the movie was playing and...it wasn't. <i>Somebody</i> had gotten the idea that it was when, it wasn't even out yet. Hoo-hah. 

Today marks my third-last day of my undergrad...ever. I have one last assignment and it's due tomorrow. And we've only just been hearing from universities. I was happy to open my email and see that I was accepted to Trent University (hooray!) but am still ""pending"" with Ottawa and Queen's. I feel happy to know I have a solid future for now, but am still eager/stressed to hear from the other two. Michelle is pleased to hear I may be moving to Peterborough."

"event","Yesterday was a very long day. It started out by an 8:30 class, but it felt alright since the sun was up before me. That put me in a good enough mood to carry on. Charlotte ended with a few minutes to spare so I was able to get the early bus home. At RH later that day the kids were really funny. They just get into arguments about everything. ""No, <i>I</i> have the biggest head!"" I had a somewhat easy time getting them all outside and then I got to play a jumping game with V. outside. I even got to see C. and J. who were playing cops and robbers.
I said, ""C. what did J. do to go to jail?""
""Oh, he did <i>a very bad thing</i>.
I love this job. 
The rest of the schoolday went well and I played dolls with V. until two boys came to play too, O. and C. It was great playing with all of them and no one had any problem with the boys playing dolls. It was awesome.

So at that point I was exhausted, but still needed to go to school again. After driving and walking all the way to school I found out it was canceled which was good (because it was canceled) but bad (because I had just wasted all that time). I came home and relaxed and got the call from Ryan that they were almost there and had made a reservation at Greco's for us. Dinner was very good, we got the goat cheese that they set on fire at your table (so good)! Then we took Andrew and Matt to the Common Ground where they were doing a meet-and-greet for their med-school interviews. Ryan and I went back to his house where I promptly fell asleep and thought I wouldn't be making out to see the girls at the Merchant. So, after being blackmailed (""You'll be outta the group!"" and ""I'll hack into your Facebook account and kill all your fish!"") I met up with Kiera, Casey and Meighen and their friends. I was so sad Emilie, Selim and Michelle didn't show. They'll hear about it on Monday. Anyway the whole affair was outrageous: 
""Hey you! Dance for us!"", the man who ignored us and wouldn't take our picture, the bill, the ho-tel mo-tel hol-i-day inn and whole car ride up to My Bar and ""singing"" Supertramp was all too hilarious. Them girls is crazy."

As for getting home, I ended up navigating the city and getting a new ISIC card and booking the train home. I felt pretty proud of myself getting around the city alone and getting everything done. The train left at 6:15 just after Ryan, Anthony and I were watching the gold medal hockey game. I thought I could see the whole thing until it went into overtime. So during the intermission we raced to the station in time to crowd around the tiny tv and see the winning goal. Everyone in the station was cheering and yelling. It was a great moment. 

I'm now in the homestretch of university. It's only a matter or weeks now. This week has been pretty good so far, reuniting with the whole crew and such. Today we got our syntax midterms back. I felt pretty good about it after writing it, but those feelings have been proven wrong plenty of times. Karma may have rewarded me though since the last assignment was balls and I got a 91. Sweet effing deals. I never see those kind of marks anymore. It's made me feel good all day. And to top it off, as we were all heading over to the QP for lunch, Kiera said she couldn't come because she had to leave for some group meetings so Selim started ""breakdancing."" 
""What are you <i>doing</i>?"" Kiera asked.
And Selim just kept twisting his legs around and said, ""I'm breakdancing...BECAUSE I DON'T CARE!"" Oh Selim.

I've played a shameful amount of video games and haven't seen sunlight in a few days, but it's awesome. This break is exactly what I needed. School really hasn't been <i>that</i> stressful, but there's always something to do and...I just don't want to do...anything for a while. So for the meantime I've been staying with Ryan in Ottawa. Sort of a vacation. Ashley drove us both up and we were supposed to go back together. Ashley just got a new job with Xerox in Ottawa which started on Monday so now I have the mission of finding my way home. And my ISIC card is expired. Perfect. 

Since my last entry, I got the classroom tutor job and also applied again for the Camp Read-A-Lot position. I haven't heard from it, but they wanted to hold interviews during Reading Week. Since I haven't heard anything yet...I guess I'm not getting an interview. So I'm clear sailing for May and June jobwise, but still need to find something else to top off the summer. Just anything but Wendy's, please. 

It turns out that yes, I am getting my wisdom teeth out. <i>All</i> of them. I'm also given the option of being outcold, which is essential for me. I don't want to experience any of it. So knock me out!

Last weekend the Johnsons (minus Mitchell) went to Almonte and to Ottawa for Winterlude. Things were a little different this time. I stayed one night in Almonte, then the next in Ottawa with Ryan and then we came back with Kelly the next day. The canal was great this year! Usually we come when it's too warm and the ice it all warped, but it was great this time. (I went a few days ago and the ice wasn't as great).

I even have all my work done so it's not like ""Hey, I have all this free time to work on assignments!"" Well, there is that thing for geography, but, like I said before, geography is lame. And I don't wanna. I'm sitting here because SPAN 402 was canceled. At least it wasn't my first class of the day and I got up/came here two hours early. Now I'm already awake and just waiting. I don't even have gym clothes. This is so lame.

But yesterday I got a nice phone call from a lady whose hiring math/literacy tutors for the Limestone Board. Jill told me about it and I applied only on Friday. So this Friday afternoon I have an interview with them and this time I'll try to act a little more professionally (i.e. not spilling the entire contents on my purse upon meeting the interviewer). My told me to go get myself an ""interview outfit"" since all my clothes are ""atrocious."" I wasn't going to go in my sweats, Mom. Geez. 

I may have to get my wisdom teeth out. And when I say ""may"" I mean, yes, before my dental plan with my rents expires. It'll only be the bottom two. At least I've got that going for me. 

The weekend turned out pretty well. Ryan came down on Thursday to make the most of the weekend and Ashley, Feeney and her boyfriend Stu came too. We all had a homemade dinner at Ashley's and went out to a comedy show at Time to Laugh where we met up with Sarah. The show was really funny and after we went out to the Grizzly Grill for some dancin'. When Ryan was just pulling onto Terraceview at the end of the night, he said that we were being followed by a cop. After we pulled into the driveway, we saw the lights go on. So...we got pulled over...in the driveway. It was a little strange.

"event","I've already had a week and a half of school and have had my fair share of classes. Lit is the same as ever, but I seem to be enjoying it more than last semester. Grammar is a tad different with a new teacher. She thinks it's strange we want to write answers on the board. Geography is kinda boring and I can't tell at all what's important to learn. And finally syntax seems to drag on forever. I don't know if I'm still missing vacation or I'm just too used to being yelled at by Hitay, but time seems stop entirely in that room. I've continued to go to Rideau Heights on Fridays. Some of the kids remember/recognize me. Some call me by name and others only say ""Hey you!"" or ""I know <i>you</i>!

We've also started this new tradition on Wednesdays to go to QP after class. (Which is great since I have 4 and a 1/2 hours to kill between classes. It's mostly been our Spanish class, but it looks like others will be joining us next week. It's all pretty fun. I also have my regular caf lunch with Shayna and Jamie and this semester we'll also get another MacCorry day, which is good. With all this social time, I'm not sure when I'll get to the gym. As a resolution I said I'd be more active (and I have been so far), but have yet to go to the Queen's Centre. I feel like I should go though...(since it cost so much effing money).

There's a job opportunity with the Limestone about being a math and literacy tutor for kids in JK to grade 6. I'm applying, but need two referees with my resume. I used Mrs. H for one, obvs, and wanted to use Mrs. E from math, but she hasn't replied to me. The deadline is too close so I may have to use Mother Jill for a second source. Balls. She would have made the resume look pretty good.

As part of Ashley's birthday, I traveled up to Ottawa on the 10th with Jill and Keith to celebrate. Kyle, Tanya, Bailey, Paylin and Ryan joined us and we all went out for dinner and back to Ashley's apartment for cake and presents. The ride up was pretty funny, Keith got into many arguments with Curtis (the GPS) and we ended taking the most backwards root possible to get there. We <i>did</i> get there though.

Ashley, Feeney and Ryan are coming down this weekend. Ryan will be coming earlier since he would've only been in town for less than 20 hours. We're going to have dinner at Ashley's and go out to see a comedy show and go dancing. This is all a part of Ashley and Feeney's birthday plans. Should be a good time.  

I learned yesterday that Ottawa and Queen's have different reading weeks. WTF. Things may have worked out for the better though because technically I'll be seeing Ryan for two weeks instead of one. We plan on going to Ottawa for Winterlude on the long weekend then bringing Ryan back to Kingston with us. Then when he leaves on the train, I'll go with him for a week-long trip to Ottawa. Sounds like a good enough deal until I asked when I would see him while he was in Kingston since I have school all week. ""What about Wednesday? You have a huge break there."" ""But that's when I go drinking all afternoon."" ""Is that really important to you?""

Yes. It is."

"event","For some reason my body's built-in sleep-in mechanism has stopped working. I guess it must have broken after last semester because I was up so early all the time. During Christmas break though, despite whatever kind of schedule I had, I would sleep in. I can barely make it past 8 o'clock now, but there's lots to be excited about so I got up. 

First of all, tomorrow's Christmas!!!!111! Nanny arrived yesterday with a car load of presents and the house is completely decked out. Mitchell should be coming home today. The Johnson Annual we held went very well this year. We had good weather and everyone ended up coming. Mitchell even got here before majority of the guests! But as I thought, I played hostess and maid so...he owes me big time. He brought his roommate Mike with him and told everyone it was an ""overnight trip"" since he was returning to Oshawa for his work party. When he left the next day he gave Mom specific instructions that ""if he wasn't home by Wednesday night, call him."" So...he <i>should</i> be back sometime today.

Ryan also finally comes to Kingston today. I still can't believe his luck with exams. It's awful, but it's over and I'll be picking him up at the station this afternoon! Anthony will be on the same train so maybe we'll have some sorta hangout then. Mom, Nanny and I all have presents for Ryan and I'm especially excited to give mine. We had already agreed his birthday present funds carried over to Christmas since L4D2 was so much so he's not expecting a lot, but I still found him a really cheap (but good) game!

On Boxing Day Katie, Lisa and I will be doing our gift exchange and have lunch at my house. Lisa wasn't able to come to the Annual because of work so we agreed to do it later this year. She's also coming home today. I don't think she even able to stay much longer either and may be leaving as early as that night. I'm excited to see them.  

Also...Lucy is wearing a bell. I tied it around her neck as a joke, but she really doesn't seem to mind it so...I left it there. She's so cute! She jingles every time so goes up/down the stairs or shakes her head! I got the bell from Rideau Heights. The last day of school was pretty cute. I helped kids wrap presents (handmade ornaments) for their parents and took them to watch a movie in the gym. It was extra-hilarious getting them ready for home since they had snowpants, mittens and hats to wear now. It took extra long. When I took a girl to her bus I asked her what she had asked Santa for Christmas. She answered ""a new kitchen"" and I asked if she meant a play on and she said, ""No, a real one."" Okay. Mrs. H and I exchanged gifts and her son helped her open mine. I gave her a big stamp set and she was happy with it. Mrs. H gave me a Christmas chime decoration. That was a pretty sweet afternoon.

Well, it won't be long until the big man in red come and I'm really excited! Mitchell's supposed to be getting Dad a cell phone! We'll see how that turns out. Merry Christmas!

P.S. The Princess and the Frog has <i>totally</i> renewed my faith in Disney. It was absolutely amazing! It was animated! And the characters sang! And it was the best thing Disney has made in a long time! Thank you finally making this movie!!!"

"event","Today is my last day of exams and I currently have one exam left. I'm not studying now because...well, it's math and...I've stopped caring about things like that long ago. So in about 6 hours time I'll be pretty damn happy. Not to mention Disney finally got a clue and made a new animated movie, The Princess and the Frog, complete with musical numbers by the look of it. After...a long effing time I'll be satisfied with a new Disney movie.

Anyway I'm completely filled with glee right now (OMG I love Glee too) and can't wait to start my holidays. I'd decided long ago that I wasn't going to work and instead just do what I've wanted all along: nothing. I may go to Rideau Heights for a few extra days before the school holiday though. That would be fun too. The Johnson Annual will be in a few weeks, but is going to be different this year. It isn't going to be a neighbourhood party, but just for ""the kids."" Mitchell and I going to host, but we all know it'll be all me. He'll probably come home half-way through the party after I've cooked, cleaned and set-up everything myself. I'll have fun anyway. 

Wednesday was the dreaded 251 exam which...didn't go as badly as I had thought. Through the use of Wikipedia, Google translator and the other 251 girls, I crammed three months worth of knowledge into my brain in three days. Emilie, Kiera, Meighen and I had a cram session beforehand that turned out really well and after the exam we went out again for Spanish brunch at the Brass. I'm just so glad to finally have it all out of the way.

On Monday Siobhain, Crystal and I finished our last math lesson. Beforehand I made up treat bags with Rice Krispies and chocolates to hand out. I'm a little sad it's over, they were a good group. I know I wanted to teach younger kids, but I think I would also be happy to teach grade 7/8 (if the kids were as cool as that). 

During the last weekend of November I visited Ryan and we had a belated birthday party. I finally got to play my long-awaited Left 4 Dead 2 all weekend long. As if I were being congratulated, my schoolwork suddenly paused so I was allowed to slack off the entire weekend and not feel guilty. Thank you world. It was everything I'd imagined, but much harder than the original. The sad part is that Ryan's last exam is the night of the 23rd. Who decided that? So he won't be coming home until Christmas Eve...and neither will the XBox. :( Anyway, that weekend we did the Kelsey's dinner again with Anthony, Andrew, Pauline and Ashley then came back to Ryan's for cake and awesomeness. 

I find that exam-studying time I have the strangest urges to do things, like cleaning up my closet, finding the perfect winter/Christmas themed desktop wallpaper or writing LJ posts. But when I finally have the time for it all, the urge stops. How strange."

"event","Because Queen's and Western were playing in the Yates Cup on Saturday, Ryan and Tomas had made plans to meet up in Kingston and basically have a butt-buddy weekend. We went to the game on Saturday with Ryan's dad and sat on the student side (in front of some heavily intoxicated sports fans). Many chants of ""Fuck Western"" and ""Safety school!"" came up, but 10 or so Western students came to sit on our side. They were just asking for it. By the end of the game, Queen's had won 43-39 so everyone was pretty happy, except Tomas (but he doesn't count). We met up with Thomas and his Dad after for sushi and then went to see Tomas' Mom's new apartment...of awesomeness.

She had bought one of the new apartments in Block D and this place was...godly. It was HUGE, and had large windows and balconies overlooking the city. The best part is when Tomas' Mom lead us to the ""Party Room"" complete with grand piano, poker table, pool table and...a movie theatre. Holy shit, this place was complete with leather, reclinable armchairs, lights and a popcorn machine. Not to mention that the screen was the size of my room. When Ryan and Tomas came in, they couldn't take their eyes off the projector hanging from the ceiling. ""I bet I could hook up the XBox to that,"" Ryan said. And that he did. So there we were playing video games, having the movie theatre all to ourselves. The only problem was we couldn't connect the sound because the system was behind the screen. Ryan was kinda pissed about that. ""We were sooooo close!"" Anyway, we were also lead downstairs where there was a pool, hot tub and sauna. Needless to say, I lived like a rich asshole this weekend.

Mom, Dad and I also got free tickets to the Sunday Frontenacs game. I think the best part was the intermission with the ""Timbits,"" being a hockey team of small children. Mostly it consisted of the kids falling down a lot. One in particular had the puck and skated straight into the goal post. I think I nearly fell down laughing. 
When Ryan left that night, he explained to Mom and Dad that his birthday was coming up on the 24th. Dad says, ""Huh, I don't know any people who have their birthdays in November"" and Mom's like, ""Dennis! What about your only son?"" That may be a Top 10.

Last Thursday was the Middle School Dance Party and it was wickedly awesome, as per us. We screamed the lyrics to our favourites 90s songs, slow danced awkwardly and had so much fun (with absolutely no alcohol). It is sad to think that it was our last. :( I'll have to DJ my own dance party in the future.

last weekend was Karen/Carly/Amanda's Vegas Birthday Party which was pretty fun. The basement at Carly's was completely decked out Vegas-style and (some) people dressed up. The most eventful part of the evening was when Brant and I were trying to figure out a guy's name who went to QE. We asked one of his friends and after he answered, he asked me, ""Why? Did you want me to hook you up with him?"" to which I exclaimed, raising my hands up, ""No! No! No! I'm already hooked up!"" The guy replies, ""Oh? You've already hooked up with him?"" I think Brant was happy about that. 

I am fairly close to having my teacher's college application done. I have my two references, Ms. H and Aoki, and only need to do some more editing. After that it's just the waiting game...until April 1st. How cruel is that? Here, we're going to tell you the decision that makes or breaks your life, then you can go write your finals in order to graduate. Or how about, you got it! Nope, April Fools! It's going to be awful, I just know it."

"event","Because I have so much rage, I'll start with this. 
Today was my first day back at Rideau Heights. I'll be volunteering on Friday afternoons again with Ms. H's kindergarten class. Now I was particularly excited to come today because all the kids would be celebrating Halloween and be in costume and be oh-so-adorable. So after racing home from school and grabbing lunch, I added the finishing touches to my french toast costume (dressed like a french person with cardboard toast on my front and back). When I got to the school, NOT A SINGLE PERSON WAS IN COSTUME. So I stood there in the lobby, looking like a complete asshole in costume, complete with a painted-on mustache. Apparently there were some kids in the school that didn't celebrate Halloween, so no one in the entire school is ""allowed"" to dress up. OUTRAGE. What a complete load of crap. Not <i>allowed</i> to celebrate Halloween?! Do we really need to be <i>that</i> politically correct. I'm just really pissed off. 

And I'm glad that I didn't dress as a zombie and anything like that.

Otherwise, my first day was fun. I recognized a few kids in the class from JK, but the kids I didn't know instantly took to me. I worked with a little boy this afternoon and everything was just adorable. I know this is what I want to do.
When we were waiting for parents to pick up their kids, one little boy fell asleep against the radiator while kneeling on the floor. Then M. came by and, after noticing me and freaking out, sank down to the floor and got right in his face and said, ""Hello? What are you doing?""

When I got home I carved some pumpkins to regain my sense of Halloween spirit. Then I stabbed myself in the hand and Mom to bandage me. Fucjkhkdf.

<lj-cut>
So half the semester is already over. Morphology is just as scary and frustrating as I thought it would be. Hitay sat us down, telling us that she didn't bother marking our first take home because it was such crap. Spanish Lit terrifies me also. The professor, Chamberlain, called on me while I had just been staring at a wall for four minutes. I had no idea what he had asked me and just ended up embarrassing myself. Math is getting off to a rough start. We're finally starting to teach tomorrow and we've suddenly been stuck with a new partner who we're not even able to contact. But things are all bad.

Spanish grammar like a breath of fresh air. There's hardly any work. Participation is super easy and if you don't do your homework, it doesn't even matter. I feel like I'm learning so many little things that it adds up a lot in my writing. Hoo-ah. 
And...health. Well, it's a first year class so I feel weird for being there. I sit in lectures and never have to say anything, go to tutorials and say little, and half read the readings. It's very unstressful. 

A few weekends ago I went with Ashley and her family to the pumpkin festival in Battersea. I had to be a Goodwins to get a cut at the family rate. It was really fun. We entered a pumpkin carving contest, watched a pie-eating contest, took a wagon ride and went through a corn maze. Afterward we all went to Bonnie's house in the country where we drank the best hot chocolate I'd ever had. We also fed some of the animals, sheep, chickens and a goat and finished by picking our own pumpkins they grew themselves! 

Last weekend Shayna hosted a Star Wars marathon. I watched about three and a half movies and the crowd got pretty big towards the end. We got pizza and bribed others to bring chocolate cake...it was awesome!

Wednesday night was pretty awks. This year I joined the Japanese chat club again and there was this introductory banquet. So I decided to go. My Japanese was a little rusty, but I didn't think it was so bad. When I sat at the table, however, I was surrounded by fluent speakers and could barely follow what they were talking about. Dinner was two hours long. It got pretty awkward.

"event","It's the last day of summer vacation and the end of a full week of rest and relaxation before school starts. At least it should have been. Last Tuesday was my last day of work, but I offered to fill in for someone else for Friday. It was a short shift, so I didn't mind, but we think that's where I may have caught my cold. 

It. Is. Awful. It started with aches and chills, which led to a fever and a cough. The cough was nothing until about five days in and now I cough my brains out 24/7. So after having this a full week, yesterday Mom thought we should see a doctor. Now I have bronchitis. High five. The meds I got pretty much guarantee I'll have it at least another six days. What's worse is that Kingston actually hosted a concert I wanted to go to. For the first time in ten years, Our Lady Peace came and I got some great seats. Cold or no cold, I was going to that concert. The nice thing was that I had an actual seat and wouldn't have to stand that whole show in a rowdy mob. We were also high enough to actually <i>see</i> the show. So besides a lot of coughing and that bitch taking my water away it was awesome.

Ashley was down for the weekend and she and Jill stopped by (at a point where I was at my absolute worst) and dropped off a nice care package. Dad was also going to host a dinner party at our house after his golf game today, but no one was able to make it. Can't say I would have been much company anyway. 

I have to start school tomorrow...and face Hitay."

"event","Have I really been out of school for <i>five</i> months? Sheesh. What have I been doing all this time? Yesterday all the little childrens went back to school (I only know because half the staff at Wendy's just disappeared). This only warns me that school will start soon for myself. My final year. Time has just flown by. Eight more months and I can call myself a Queen's graduate. Sounds too odd to me. I'm excited to go back and see everyone, buy new books and such, but not to start schoolwork. Barf. This year there are some scary classes. 

Yesterday was also the beginning of something else for Ryan. Yesterday he got braces. He has to keep them for two years and also get implants. Youch. To make him feel better he bought an Xbox 360. Well, not entirely to make him feel better, we've both wanted one for a while now. It's kind of a slap in the face though since he'll be leaving in a few days, Xbox and all. So to tide me over I'm getting the Wii. (Hurray.)
Tomorrow Ryan's friend Andrew is coming from Ottawa to visit and they'll both go back together. We may do some sightseeing since we're all free, but where would we really want to go?

The family is gathering here for a visit on Saturday (right after Ryan and Andrew will be leaving). And this time they'll be bringing Zeus! I wonder how the cats will take it..."

"event","The last month has pretty much flown by. Last weekend Mom, Dad and I spent last weekend in Oshawa visiting Mitchell. Since I had been at work so much it was a nice change of pace. On the Saturday night we had dinner out and I got to see Mitchell's new house (and his new cat Squiggle!) We also visited his old house and met some of his old room mates. One just got a new bulldog puppy, named Rigby, who was only a few months old (and very, very adorable). On Saturday the four of us visited the Toronto Zoo which was very fun besides being horrifically hot outside. On Monday I finally got to see Mitchell's work and meet one of his bosses Rob Butler who is an ex-Blue jay player. 

This week Danielle was in town because her and Mike had a wedding to go to in Ottawa. Originally we were going to go to dinner which turned into quite a crowd. After a lot of confusion, there were 3, 4, 9 then 6 people coming to get sushi dinner. In the end though it was well worth it, Danielle, Shayna and I splitting a huge order (and eating every piece!). 

This weekend Mom and Dad went away to Bobcaygeon for a wine festival and left me all by myself. It felt pretty great. Maybe someday I'll have my own apartment. I just really enjoyed being by myself (besides coming home late at night to a dark, empty house) but all and all, it was pretty awesome. 
Yesterday was great. Another one of those completely-unplanned-but-completely-awesome days. While I was at work, Reid and Josh show up and tell me that Jason is having his birthday party out at Lobourough Lake that night. I was a little hesitant to drive all the way out there by myself, but in the end I went and had a <i>great</i> time. There were tons of fun things including playing in the park, some personal ""reflection"" time, sitting around the campfire and a certain something in the outhouse that we won't forget.
""Steve and Carol were totally busting a move and knew all the words to Boom Boom Pow!""
""And then they went home and Boom Boom Powed!"" - Reid ""Three and Easy"" Campbell
Matt also told me a hilarious story about Mitchell from last summer. He and Brant stayed up way longer than everyone else drinking and the next morning Matt and Laura got up to start the fire again. Since it was so damp from dew, they decided to go into town and get some fire starters and woke up Mitchell, who was sleeping in his car, to go do so. They could tell the moment they woke him, that he was still completely drunk, so Laura drove in, they did their shopping and came back. Later when they were using the firestarter, Mitchell had no recollection of ever going into town to buy it in the first place.

I went to Wendy's the other day to see if there was a job available to me...so it's just a matter of time before I'm flippin' burgers again. Won't be too bad though, it was nice seeing everyone again, and it'll only be for the rest of the summer. Plus I'll have spending money again...

Obviously I was not offered a job anywhere else. I <i>almost</i> had this awesome job lined up where I would help high school students from France to learn English by playing games with them. It would've been awesome and I would've made some mad bank. Of course though, before I went to meet with the supervisor, he asked on the phone if I had any ESL (English as a Second Language) training. ""Er...uh...no."" So that was that. 

Ryan and I are talking about getting an Xbox. It's funny because we talk about it like it's a dog or a baby. It's expensive...I'll have it at this time and then you...Is this the right time? Ha, it'll be fun to own a current system though. I may get to hold onto the Wii though at home if we actually go through with it.

For the last few days I've been reviewing everything I learned about the environment. My final exam is Monday and is <i>all</i> multiple choice. I hope that won't turn around to bite me. I'm pretty excited to be done though. I'll be school free for about...seven weeks. <i>Woo!</i>"

So Shayna and I will have adventures of mass proportions today and actually see the Fire Show this year. Ryan, Ashley and I went last night and saw some pretty sweet stuff, I was impressed. 

For my birthday we were going to have a barbecue/trailer party out at Loborough, but Jason isn't able to do it now. I didn't really have my breath held for that one, but now I have to think of something else. I don't know why I feel I need to go overboard every year, but I do. Maybe I'll try another party. I know I'd like to try (again) to go to Picton on my actual birthday and have a barbecue back at home with some pals. That'd be nice. 

On Monday I went out with the Goodwins' on their boat. We were all over and stopped in this nice place called Jones Falls for ice cream. We drove by their old campground and the same place Katie had hers. We even went under the bridge nearby and saw all these baby birds in nests! They were so cute!

I also recently helped Ashley dye her hair (but didn't end up so well). Anyway, while we waited for the dye, Ashley suggested we go for ice cream. Her head was all wrapped up in tin foil, but she said we'd only do drive-thru, so it didn't really matter. When we got to the speaker at DQ, they had a new blizzard called the Tin Roof. Ashley asked, ""What's in it?"" and I say ""Your head."" I am <i>so</i> hilarious! 

This week I had an interview at Denny's to be a hostess or server. The interview wasn't very long, but the woman liked that I had handled money already. Only the person who gets the job will be called in the end, so...I'm just playing the waiting game now. (In the meantime, I just LOVE have so much free time. I'm getting back to the things that really make me happy).

Besides the buskers and my birthday, I have a lot to be excited about:
- Harry Potter 6!
- Finally playing a new Monkey Island game!
- Finishing biology and <i>really</i> starting the summer!
- Hawksley Workman at the Grand Theatre!
- Ryan's week-long vacation!
- Visiting Mitchell in August and going to a Jays game/Toronto Zoo!

On the last day Mrs. H's class awarded me with a card signed by the entire class and a book called ""I like colours."" I'm really going to miss my class. I hope that I have the time to come back in September. 

Since then I've been enjoying my freedom. I've been kayaking, strawberry picking, writing and seeing old movies that are considered ""classic."" (I secretly enjoy doing nothing at all! I think that's why I like the Christmas holidays so much.)

I now have my final timetable for Queen's. I had to work out the kinks many times, but in the end, I will have all the credits I need to finish linguistics <i>and</i> have <i>all</i> the recommended courses I need for an extra year of education. Some of the courses are pretty balls and I still don't have a single day off, but at least I'll have all that I need. I think I'll also have more than one class with Caroline, which is always a bonus. 

On Canada Day Mom, Dad and I went to Grasscreek Park. The whole Goodwins clan was there too. It was nice but no one could go swimming because of all the e.coli in the water. That didn't stop others from doing it though. Later on Ryan, Ashley and I went to see the fireworks at Confederation park. I think the best park of the entire day was when Ashley walked into a tranny. I saw it happening but did nothing to prevent it. It was priceless.  

I`ve applied to a few jobs that I hope to hear from soon. I think my best leads were at the Reebok and Adidas outlet, because Reid works there, so I can be sure the manager will get my resume. It would be pretty fun to work with him again.

Today Ryan and I went to Wolfe Island so I could do some more research for my assignment about the wind turbines. I think it was pretty informative. I even ran into Jean, who I took Creative Arts with, at the Wolfe Island Bakery. I got a lot of information from them. Ryan and I walked around first, trying to get close enough to a turbine. We may or may not have wandered onto someone's property. Was it a bed and breakfast? We weren't sure. It was a fun little trip for the afternoon.

Not even a ""thanks for trying out"" kind of thing. My next option I think will be the new Adidas outlet near our house and the two Shopper's Drug Mart. At this point, Wendy's is only a last resort.

On Wednesday I was invited to a volunteer benefit thing and was given a ""Thanks a Bunch!"" card in the same style as the Father's Day cards and a Rideau Heights t-shirt. Score. I was going to ask if I could buy something like that. It happened to be Katie's birthday the same day so I came over afterward. We ate some (bad) cake and played a few rounds of Catch Phrase. Then when everyone had left we watched Step Brothers. It was a fun night. Next Wednesday is the end-of-the-year barbecue too. I might go on a date with Mother Jill there. It should be fun. 

Last Friday was the Lemoine's Point trip for all the primary classes and I came as a chaperon. I was responsible for only four kids. Pretty simple, I thought. Well, between keeping track of them, their actions and their bladders, it was pretty tiring. We ate lunch in a big field and when I got to my cookies, J. looked at me with his big eyes and asked,"" Can I have some?"" So I broke off a little and gave it to him. ""Can I have some more?"" That went on for a while. After lunch we walked a little further until we got to the park. I spent a lot of time there pushing kids on the swings. After a while I gave up, I needed to sit down. I found a bench with a few of the other parents who volunteered and they asked why I wanted to come. I explained that I was already there five days a week, hoping to do that as a career and they both gave me looks that read, ""Are you <i>crazy</i>?"" 

Later the same day, Ashley officially graduated from St. Lawrence and then had a big party at her house. One of her relatives gave her a thick envelope that had ten tickets to the Bif Naked concert later on at the Ale House. I went with Ashley, Tiffany and Ryan to the show, which was really good, but I was so, so tired by the end of the day.

This morning I went shopping with Ashley and Mother Jill. We hit up Old Navy for a sale and went for lunch. When we were stopped at the Dollarama, I ran into J. and he went absolutely nuts. ""Holly! Holly! Holly! Holly!"" 

The other week we went to the opening night of the new Creative Arts show and so did Mom (obviously) and Dad. I also ran into Erica there, and told her my <i>smokin'</i> Dad was here too. I also told her what she said about him at brunch. ""No wonder he's been looking at me strangely at night!""

We had a Holly/Katie/Lisa get together the next day. We went out for lunch and ice cream and visited the show while we were downtown. When we got home we played an excruciating game of Monopoly and Katie won once again. 

This weekend marks Mom and Dad's 27th wedding anniversary (which happens to be very close the Porters'. Tomorrow is also Father's Day and I plan on making homemade pizza again, just like I did for Mom. I also rented him some stand-up DVDs for the weekend. He should like all that. Nothing's too good for <i>smokin'</i> Dennis Johnson.

<lj-cut>
As usual I was with J. at recess who likes to hug and hold my hand. We have this game where he hides behind me and I pretend not to know where he is. We were playing that when the bell rang and I started to walk away and this upset him.
""J. we have to go inside now. The bell rang.""
He sat on the ground. ""But I want to be close to you"" he whimpered.
I crouched down beside him. ""But I'm right here"" I said and shook his foot.
""No,"" he said. ""I want to be close to your butt."" 

While working in L's class, we were all getting ready to go home and were cleaning up. As I'm making my way around the room I start C. starting to sing something...
""Mud on your face! Big disgrace!""
""C., wait till you're outside, then sing.""
""WE WILL, WE WILL ROCK YOU!""
That also went on for a while.

Last night I was explaining the things I was learning in ecology (renewable energy). I was saying how harnessing wind energy is the cheapest and most efficient energy out there when Dad farts and says, ""Harness that.""

"event","So first of all, I got this today from the girls in Mrs. A's class:
<img src=""http://pictureposter.allbrand.nu/pictures/corona/certificate.jpg"" alt=/>
I especially liked the way they spelled my name. How adorable. <3

I had quite the scare with Dinah on Sunday morning. Nowadays she howls a lot whenever she goes down into the basement (where her bathroom is). We don't know if there's something wrong, or she's just a cranky old kitty cat. So on Sunday, she's doing her usual howling downstairs and Mom tries calling her from upstairs. Dinah doesn't come so she gives up and leaves. It was only because I had the urge to clean that I went downstairs to get the supplies that I noticed that Dinah wasn't making her usual noises. She sounded hurt. After finding her under the staircase, I saw that one of our spare tables had fallen on top of her, trapping her there. It was quite a heavy table too, but I easily got her out. When I pet her to make sure she was okay, I found blood on her tail and freaked out. I gave her a more thorough examination and it looked like she was fine for the most part. She just really scared me. (She's okay now though :))

On Saturday Ashley, Ryan and I went to Picton! HURRAY! We finally went! We left on time and there were no problems, well, until we got there. It <i>was</i> a beautiful day, but the wind made things really cold on the beach. We hung out for a while, but headed into town for a while to sightsee and warm up. There I saw a big sign that read ""New Kittens!"" and I practically ran right over. The women running the store even let me hold them! They were soooo cute! Only six weeks old! So after two hours of doing that we went to a second hand shop and Ryan found a pretty hilarious book that I wish we had bought. After we ate our lunch we headed back to the beach where it had warmed up a lot and more people had shown up. On our way home we stopped at Scooperman's and took the ferry. I was pretty wiped out by the whole day and got a wicked sunburn on the backs on my legs. I'm very glad we got to Picton though! I hope we're able to go again when it's warm enough to swim!

This Friday I'll be going with Mrs. H's and Mrs. A's class to Lemoine's Point! (And I'm probably more excited about it than the kids!)"

"event","So last week I have a message for me on the answering machine. It's from the interviewer for Camp Read-A-Lot asking me to call back whenever possible. Great, I think, I got the job! When I call back the next morning she sounds cheerful when I say my name, but then she explains that I didn't actually get the job. So...poo. Back to the drawing board.

Last Sunday I actually made it to another Sunday Brunch at Jason's. I ate so much that I thought I might burst...ugh. For some reason it was a ""Bring your mom"" themed brunch. Jason's mom and both the Merritts were there, but everyone was disappointed when my rents didn't come with me. It came up after I mentioned that Dad had just turned 60. 
""60?"" said Erica. ""Your dad's pretty smokin' for 60!""
Well didn't that put a strut in his step when I told him that later. He liked that. We watched Hercules and again tried to arrange a live-action cast. Afterward, while Ryan was looking through the special features, he found another version of ""I Can Go the Distance"" sung by Ricky Martin! Go R2-D2 lightning! Since it's turning into summer, Jason is switching for Sunday Brunch to Saturday Barbecues at his campground at Lobourough so...more trailer parties hurray!

Other than that news, it looks like they're fun things on the horizon:
- Creative Arts show opens tomorrow night
- Trip to Picton on Saturday! (And maybe a Thornley concert?)
- The kindergarteners are going to Lemoine's Point next Friday (hopefully me too!)
- Jason got a campground at Loborough Lake and will be having monthly barbecue/trailer parties!
- We also may be working out a weekend to celebrate my birthday out there!
- Mom and Dad want to visit Mitchell in Oshawa (meaning mini-vacation and stopping at the Toronto Zoo on the way home)!
- After nine years there's a new Monkey Island game coming out! (And possibly a Left 4 Dead 2?)
So...things to look forward to! Hurray!

I don't know the legalities of this, so I'm not using real names for these:

So J. had been sent from class for some reason unknown to me. He came with me to Mrs. A's class for the afternoon. When we met up with his brother later, he asked J. what he had done to get into trouble in the first place.
""I kissed someone"" he said, as smugly as possibly for a five-year-old. I'm pretty sure it was a boy too.

The kids in Mrs. H's class made paintings and were instructed to write a sentence about it on the back. J. wrote: ""This is my belly full of meatballs.""

While getting ready for home yesterday, G. was excited because his dog was coming with his dad to pick him up. ""He has diarrhoea but he's getting better. Right now it's slimy.""

"event","I just woke up in a bad mood after having a bad dream. Not a scary dream, just bad. I was having a birthday at some club, the entire place was rented out for me. I even had my own live band there (the band wasn't identified, but they were fairly big time). I was pretty happy and excited that things were going so well until the band played one song and said they had to leave. Trying to stay positive, I whipped out my iPod and became the DJ. I started with 90s songs until this girl I didn't know approached me. 
""Are you going to play any recent stuff?"" she snarled.
""Yeah,"" I said scrolling through my playlists. ""I have some right here.""
""Like what?""
""Beyonce, Ciara..."" 
""Good"" she said and then the thought final occurred to me. Why should I care what she thought? So I continued to yell at her, asking her why she was even there and who the hell she was telling me what to play on my own birthday. In fact, I was pretty darn ruthless. I told her where to go.
So after waking up, I feel strange about my non-birthday working out (again). The last few years, I've had some rotten birthdays. Every year I just want to go to Picton and every year it rains. I've also been getting less and less turnouts. This year will be even worse since everyone hates each other. I won't be able to invite anyone! It'll also be a Monday. So I woke up thinking I'd be doomed to another crappy party.

Moving on! On a lighter note Hawksley Workman will be coming to Kingston in July! Hooray! On the downside, no one knows who he is and will come with me (which is understandable) so I got a ticket for myself and will be going alone. I'm sure it's not as bad as it sounds. I've got a pretty good seat too and once the show starts, it won't even matter who I'm with. These days, I feel, if you really want to do something you have to do it yourself. Or in this case, by yourself.

It's now the last Tuesday of May and I've yet to hear from the Limestone Board about my job. Not sure what I should think at this point...Rideau Heights is going well still, I wish I were getting paid for all my time though, it'd be a great job.

This week seems pretty eventful. Yesterday Ryan and Andy went paintballing with McDonald's and I came for picture-taking. Sarah is having her birthday party today which should be fun. Ashley and I are going after work. Sunday is Jason's brunch and will be awesome.

"event","The hooplah on the weekend went quite well, aside from one little mishap. We expected to see Mitchell sometime between 3 and 4 so it didn't really draw any attention when he was late. At first. It must've been after six before we got a phone call from him saying that he'd gotten a flat tire somewhere in a place called Tweed (a.k.a. middle of nowhere) and had to call a tow-truck. He finally arrived after eight. Mitchell also said he had some story that he wanted to share with all of us. When I told this to uncle John, I said maybe a girlfriend? Fiance? New house or car? And John said, ""Or maybe he's coming out of the closet."" So we laughed together. 
John bought himself a motorcycle that Jocelyn doesn't seem to be to pleased about. I'm sad that I didn't get a picture. It was pretty nice. I didn't get to see him drive it either.
Later on that night I watched the Survivor finale and, in the end, came out in second place, which means nothing. I don't get anything. Boo-urns. Had I just picked J.T. I would have owned face.

The next we visited a house that one of my Mom's friends used to live in. It had since been turned into a bed and breakfast. It was really pretty and I got lots of pictures for Mom. John and Jocelyn came for lunch with Zeus before we all went our separate ways.

Since we now have many more car opportunities, I'd like to make some trips in the summer. I'm thinking about a trip to Toronto to the zoo. I think I could convince the boys to do that. Andy has a car so I don't see why not...And I had better get to Picton this summer. I swear, these last two summers have been awful! Not the amount of beach and swimming that I need!

And then there are the little kid quotes that I don't want to forget. <lj-cut>

Kid #1: If I get a little sister they're going to name her Flash and if I get a little brother they're going to name him Storm.
Kid #2: You can't name a kid Storm!
Kid #3: I named <i>this</i> Storm! [points to bicep]

Me: So how long do you brush your teeth for everyday?
Boy: [silence]
Me: Well, what did the teacher just say is the right amount? 120...
Boy: Minutes!
Me: Minutes! That's two hours! 120...
Boy: Seconds...and thirty hours.

4 year-old girl: Do you have a baby in your belly?
Me: No.
4yog: Uh-huh.
Me: I don't.
4yog: Well I learned that when your belly is big like that, that means you got a baby in your belly.
[Self-esteem disintegrates] Well, maybe I do want to forget this one.

"event","Another day in the misadventures of Holly! So I've just returned from my job interview with the Limestone School Board and I feel iffy. I think that the actual interview went well, I answered the questions sufficiently while telling the interviewers the things they wanted to hear. Beforehand, however, while shaking my interviewer's hand in the lobby, I managed to spill the entire contents of my purse onto the floor. Great start. And while I waited in the lobby, the survey I filled out didn't make me look very good. Do you have first aid training? Can you manage to get as far as Napanee and Sydenham every day? Are you available every day from July to August? Well, the answer to all those were no, but there were no options of me writing: I plan on getting first aid training soon, I don't have a car and I will have to have a day off to write an exam for a spring-summer university course. So right now, I look like a slacker. Great. Well, we'll see by the end of the month if I have the job or not. Wheeeee!

Friday night I was with the boys: Ryan, Tomas and Andy. Our super plan was to make our own dinner so we headed over to Bennet's for supplies. We came out with sausages for a barbecue, but went also to Mike Mundell's ""to eat before we eat."" Anyway, the store sells something called ""Climax Candies"" that were...tempting? Also, when you place an order, they ask for your name. ""Optimus Prime,"" said Andy, completely straight-faced. What a kid.

On Saturday we have a pretty good posse for sushi. Enough for two large orders! It was great! I love having all that variety of sushi in front of me instead of sticking to only one or two kinds. Ryan explained that Alexia was buying Tomas' sushi for his birthday, or ""that day of abomination."" Then Tomas piped up ""No, nine months before that day was the day of abomination."" Later that night we all saw Star Trek. Yeah, for not knowing much about the whole thing, I found it pretty exciting. When Andy asked for his ticket, he asked Shatner style: ""One ticket for...the Star...Trek Movie....sir."" I had a good time (especially since Ashley and I could secretly poke fun at it). 

As Sunday was Mother's Day I gave Mom her gift and the card I hand-made for her (it was the same one that my kindergarten class made). I got Mom a nice crab-shaped serving dish that was really cute. I also took it upon myself to make dinner that night. I made my first ever homemade pizzas. And they turned out well too! They were really good (and fun to make) but they were really time-consuming. I'll probably start making them once in a while. Mom used to make them every Sunday so I asked what kind of time she had back then. ""More than now"" she answered. 

This weekend the Johnsons (including Mitchell) are going to Almonte for the super-birthday celebration!"

I get lots of hugs and excited faces when I enter the classroom and <i>""Hi Holly!""</i>s. It's very rewarding. Even on the playground the kids are very nice to me. Sometimes I'm even invited to play with them.

In other news, I <i>did</i> receive a call about an interview for Camp Read-A-Lot so that it a very good sign. I was also asked to come earlier in order to fill out paperwork. Possibility that they've already hired me? Fingers crossed.

Tuesday night we said our goodbyes to Danielle since she's is leaving for Calgary for good. We don't know the next time we will see her. Mike's parents live in Ottawa so it wouldn't be so hard to come visit Kingston too. I'm sure Danielle wants to see her family on important holidays. Ashley wants us to go visit her together someday.
Tuesday was also Dad's 60th birthday so we had a nice dinner with the family. Mom and Dad are going to the Brew Pub tomorrow night to see Karen perform. Apparently Karen can sing and play guitar. Maybe I will check this out myself. 

Last Friday, Dad, Ryan and I saw John Pinette at the Grand Theatre. It was great! I didn't think I could laugh so much! We were even in the second row, I didn't even need my glasses for it and I ended up with some pretty good pictures.
Saturday we had our annual garage sale on Barker street. Since I didn't count what money I had <i>before</i> the sale, I don't actually know how much I made. I did get rid of a lot of junk though.

Since the schoolyear is officially over (but not for me) Katie and Tomas have both come home and I'll most likely be seeing a lot of them. Katie got a job at Rideau Crest (and will be making some sweet, sweet moolah) and Tomas is...fat and unemployed. 
For the long weekend this month we're all supposed to visit Almonte for a big May birthday. Most of my family has their birthday in May so we're just going to have one big party."

I haven't officially been assigned to a classroom yet, but that should be sorted out after I get there. I hope my class goes on a field trip at least once. I'd like to go somewhere. Other than volunteering in a classroom, I'll be a supervisor on the school yard. I kinda wonder if I'm supposed to go through any training first. I'm not sure what I'm expected to do in case of a fight or anything else.

This June my Grandma is turning 80. Originally, my parents were going to take her to New York City for the week, but that proved to be too stressful and busy for Nanny. So then we decided that the whole family would visit Mitchell in Ajax, staying again at the Durham residence overnight and then go to Toronto to see a Broadway show. Again, this turned out to be too hard. So now I think we're all going to meet in Kingston (woo hoo) for something. We have to research what will be going on that weekend. Had we gone with the original plan, I would have had the house to myself for an entire week! I would have had a wicked awesome party...

This Friday Dad, Ryan and I are going to see John Pinette at the Grand Theatre. This will be <i>so</i> exciting. I've been excited since we got our tickets, in the <i>second</i> row! We're going to be so close one of us may be the audience member he asks something. I can't wait!

Steam came out with a new Left 4 Dead setting: survival. You just kill zombies, getting more points the longer you stay alive. Needless to say, Ryan, Andy and I have been playing it all weekend. It's that ridiculous."

Easter went by pretty quickly. Mitchell only came home for 24 hours but we had Easter dinner with him on Friday with Troy, Lori and Nate. We had a second Easter dinner on Sunday with Nanny and I invited Caroline too. It was a nice break during exams.
The next day I wrote my Japanese final but didn't see Aoki or Takahashi there. As soon as the exam was over everyone kinda went their separate ways. I expected we would do something, like go for lunch, but everyone split up too quickly. Boo. Now Japanese is over forever. :(
The day after that I wrote the Phonology midterm of hell. It was a take-home, which is by far worse than an actual exam. Instead of a few hours to figure things out, I had weeks which conflicted with my sanity. At some point I just didn't care anymore and handed something in. I hate you optimality theory. You don't make no sense. 
After I finished that traumatizing day I got to reap the rewards and they were well worth it. I've been reading (for entertainment), writing, drawing and scrapbooking, some things that I've put off for far too long. 

I've applied to a job within the Limestone School Board about a Literacy Camp in the summer. Not only would this look great on my application for Con Ed in September, but I'll get sweet, sweet moolah while I'm doing it. Double score! All I can do now is wait though...so fingers crossed.
In the meantime I'm going to volunteer in a classroom at Rideau Heights. Yesterday I met with Mrs. MacDonald, the principal and she asked, ""Are you interested in a paid position?"" And I'm thinking <i>'Is this a trick question?'</i> Apparently, all the university students who were working there are gone for the summer and they have a lack of supervisors during recess. So I'm going to get paid to watch kids during recess. It'll only be five hours a week but at least I'll be making some profit."

"event","It's Sunday morning in Ottawa and I'm having a pretty sweet time. I don't want to go home yet. Friday night was the usual just hangouts because I'm old and fall asleep too early. Yesterday though was effing epic. Ryan got me tickets to see Disney on Ice at the Scotiabank place and I was really excited. To get there we had to take a half-hour bus ride to Bayshore and then another twenty(ish) minute bus to the show. It was worth it though. Our bus was specifically going to the Scotiabank Place so it was full of families and little kids boucing around in their seats. Ryan and I were the only non-family (whatever). Even though we had seats in the nose bleed section, we still had a pretty good view of the ice. The show itself was just a bunch of musical numbers or really short tellings of the movies. I was impressed with the costumes though. I think Bruce from Finding Nemo was my favourite. He had two people skating as him because he was so big. I was definitely waiting for the Lion King specially to come on and the rest of the show had clues to what was about the come on, for example, Mickey and Minnie found a magic lamp (so then Aladdin came on). But the Lion King had no introduction. It was just like BAM! there's Rafiki and the Ciricle of Life song immediately started. I think I peed a little bit. The closing number had all the skaters on the ice at once and I kinda had a seizure because I wanted pictures of everyone. I think I ended up with some good one.

After we got home, Ryan and I met Ashley out at the bars with Feeney, Jenny and some other Algonquin friends. At the first place we were at, there was a old couple making out. That was fun. I drank a little more than I intended but it made everything more awesome. We went to this place called The Pour House and there was a live band. Since I was intoxicated and everything else was already awesome, it was even MORE awesome when this random man came to our table and was all ""It's my birthday, want some cake?"" and I'm like ""Free cake? Hell yeah!"" And it wasn't like all cheap, grocery cake. It was whipped creme, angelfood cake with fresh berries. I think I peed a little bit. So we danced a little to the band and drank some more but had to call it quits eventually. 

Today Ryan's hosting a pot-luck party but I won't be able to stay very long. I drunkenly invited Ashley last night but I don't think Ryan really minds. ""As long as she brings something"" he said. I already baked some cookies for the event so my job's done. It's just as well though. I had a hell of a week.

<lj-cut>
Anything and everything was due over the course of two days, Wednesday and Thursday. I spent the first half of the week studying for our Spanish midterm and my last kanji test (EVER). I did both tests Wednesday and then found out the same day that my Japanese presentation was due the next day. I had thought that it was actually the following Thursday. Surprise! So I spent Wednesday night figuring out something I could present. It thought it was really shitty, however, when people scheduled to present on Thursday didn't go because they simply ""forgot."" I didn't know we had the option. If we had gone Friday, I would have at least memorized it mostly or completely. I hope I get some bonus marks for at least going <i>when I was supposed to.</i> Thursday was also the protest for the cancellation of language classes. There was a big turn out and it was on the news later that day. I later handed in my final assignment for phonology but in turn missed the bus because <i>someone</i> didn't pass out our field methods sheet quickly enough. So I thought I deserved a little treat and went to Tim Horton's for some hot chocolate. I ran into Michelle on the way out and killed time with her until <i>I thought</i> the next bus would come. I ended up sprinting for it, spilling hot chocolate all down the front of my coat and barely catching the bus to begin with. The driver looked at me like I was an idiot but reluctantly let me on. What an effing two days that was.

I think I might figured out my life plan. Yesterday Caroline showed me this webpage of an elementary school teacher's dayplan. It just made me so happy and I could really picture myself doing it, teaching maybe the 2nd or 3rd grade. I looked into it and I could already be eligible to get into the one-year education school at Queen's. My marks aren't the greatest but I've also got a lot of the recommended courses like developmental psych and kid's lit. There's also these classes designed to teach reading and math to kids that I might end up taking in September. But I may be jumping the gun a little bit. I don't have to actually apply until September so I have a lot of time to think about it, if this is the path I actually want to take. I think if I feel this way still in a few months time, I'm going to go for it. 

And the kids will call me Mrs. Johnson. I like that.

Things have been fairly regular for March: lots of assignments and studying to do, with trips back and forth to Ottawa and the usual amount of hangouts. Ryan surprised me last week asking me to come up again at the end of the month. He said if I got my ticket, then he would treat me by taking me to see Disney on Ice! Hooray! This will be a lot of fun! It's even being held at the ScotiaBank Place so it will be extra exciting!
I've been meeting regularly now with my new friend Yusuke, my Japanese conversation buddy. I find that thinking up a new topic is harder than actually <i>speaking</i> now. Besides random grammar points and being stuck for vocabulary, I seem to be getting by fairly well.

I'm starting to count down the last of everything at school. I only have a few more tests, assignments and things to work on. I have only have one final in Japanese, an in-class midterm for Spanish and a take home for phonology. All of these a spaced fairly apart too. As of April 13th I'll be done third year.
As for the summer, I'm not sure what I should do. I have a lot of opportunities to volunteer but that still won't get me any money for the summer. I made a promise to get a new job this year and I really wanted to apply to the Queen's summer camp program, but I missed the deadline (typical). So as of right now, I'll be unemployed. I thought about Shopper's Drug Mart...I want something close to home that isn't a restaurant. Maybe I will apply to Take Sushi. It'd be awesome to work there, but then again, there aren't any caucasian people working there...we'll see."

I realize that I only have three classes, but after Christmas I was still busy like I had a full course load. I feel kind of guilty for not doing anything. I set up this month's calendar with all the things I have to do and it's surprisingly empty. I'm sure linguistics will keep me busy though. I'll just see how I feel in a few weeks time.

Before Reading Week, Ms. Aoki asked if Michelle and I could meet her after class. Since it was only the two of us, we began to wonder why it was only us going and whether or not the meeting was about something good. My marks have been steadily going upward and I wasn't asked to come alone so it wasn't like Aoki was going to tell me I was failing. Anyway, the night before Aoki tells us the mystery meeting is canceled. I thought we may never had figured it out. The Wednesday we came back to school, Aoki asks me to come again (this time by myself) and when I get there she hands me an envelope. Inside I pull out a check for $250. Aoki explains to me that because I am an Ontario-born student who has an enthusiasm for the Japanese language she and Ms. Reeve voted to give me this award. Michelle also got this award so hurray for us!
That same afternoon I finally met my Japanese conversation buddy. His name is Yusuke. We met at the Common Ground and talked for over an hour. I was very surprised at the amount I was able to understand and respond to! We're going to meet every week to practice my conversation skills. Aoki was very happy to hear I had a conversation buddy.
Also on Wednesday (it was a busy day) Mom and Dad informed me that they finally chose our new car. It's going to be a silver Nissan Versa (and I think I'll even be allowed to drive it!). Man, new computer, new car, the Johnsons are moving up!

This weekend I spent with Ashley and Danielle on Friday night. I had to hear the details about Ashley's date with Adam! Now she said that it <i>""Wasn't a date""</i> but when you go to dinner and a movie, that's a date. She already knows I approve if they actually do decide to start dating, plus I'll have one of my best guy friends back! Well, since Adam returned to Kingston, we'll be friends anyway, but that would just make it extra special. Jill's keeping her fingers crossed for her new son-in-law.
Saturday night Shayna, Caroline and I went to see ""He's Just Not That Into You."" I thought it was very cute. I still have a big crush on Justin Long. After we dropped off Shayna we'd barely driven a block away and I spotted a fox. A fox on Earl street! We got a really bad picture before it ran away. Later we returned to Caroline's and played with Monty!"

"event","This has most definitely not been the Reading Week I had been expecting. What I really wanted was to just get away from school and catch up with all the nothing I had to do: games, reading, tv watching (with no guilt) but now I'm getting a little antsy for something to do. The other night Tomas made some suggestion about taking a day trip somewhere (ideally the Hershey factory in Smith Falls) but we didn't have any ideas. Finally we decided on seeing a Senator's game, but in the end (and for some reason unbeknownst to me) we didn't go. 

What we did do was go to the new Sakura restaurant that features the Teppanyaki cooking (where they cook your meal right there in front of you). The chef was really funny and did all these cool tricks like flipping an egg around on his spatula, doing the onion volcano and actually tossing food directly into our mouths! It was so cool! And also the <i>best</i> chicken fried rice ever!

On the Friday night I went to Take Sushi again with Ryan, Andy and Caroline. Actually, Andy asked if I had any single friends and I said I had ""a few."" The meal was extra delicious since I'd learned how good the teriyaki chicken sushi was. The four of us took an exciting trip to Wal-Mart and back to my house. I was itching to watch Happy Campers again so I'd glad Caroline liked it. I also got to see Monty again when we picked her up! He is SO cute! I want a kitten.

On a happier note, the Johnson Family <i>FINALLY</i> has a new computer (which I'm typing on right now). Ryan helped pick it out and set it up himself. But if that weren't a tease, the internet decided to crap out on us around the same time. So I had this shiny new computer...with no internet. You can see the dilemma. We got a new modem from Cogeco, set it up and things seemed to run fine until this morning. I hadn't even reached the bathroom when Dad's shouting about me fixing the computer. I think the Johnsons are just not made out to handle any type of technology. I contacted Cogeco myself and managed to fix things (at least for the meantime). I'm just waiting for the next problem. 

I met up with Lisa for brunch the same day we got our computer while she was visiting. The visits, however short, are always still the same as ever. Lisa decided to tell me a certain joke while smothering her toast with some jelly. ""What's the difference between jam and jelly? [pause] I can't <i>jelly</i> my dick down your throat."" Gross.

A few more points: Since the new season of Survivor has started I got into a pool with the teachers at QE betting on which person will win. Each person gets to choose three people. After two rounds, all three of my picks have made it through! This weekend should be pretty cool. Mitchell will be coming to visit and we're going to go to the Trews concert at the Ale House. Tis been awhile since I've seen a concert. Then Sunday is Jason's next brunch party. Still haven't decided if I will see Ryan home or go to Jason's..."

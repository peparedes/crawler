"event","So yes, it's been FOREVER since I've updated. A lot has happened this summer... and a lot is still going to happen before it's all over. We are 4/5 done with soccer camps, a little under a month away from GS training, almost exactly a month away from RA training, I got to be 100% in charge of the building for two weeks, our manager and assistant manager have left and been replaced with two new people to the building, Tasha is leaving on Sunday to move to Washington, D.C. to work at Georgetown, the domino moving effect is going to start up on Friday, I ""nagged"" long enough and finally got the approval to paint my apartment for next year, lots of lazy Saturdays and Sundays at the lake with Tricia, leaving in a week and half to go to Grand Haven, Michigan with Tricia for four days, staying at a Bed and Breakfast right on the beach and then will spend the rest of the week at the lake.

Soccer camps: For the most part, have been great. I've convinced Renee (the head coaches' wife) that I do actually know what I'm doing and have proven myself to her several times by providing easy check ins... seriously, some of the easiest I've ever done and that's with 650 campers coming in. It's not like it's a small camp. She even bought us a cake the other day to thank us for all of our hard work. I had lunch with Sara today and she almost fell out of her chair when I told her about the cake. Apparently, that did not happen last year.

New Managers: Molly from McNutt is our new ARM and Tiana (formerly a GS at Foster, then worked at Iowa State and Ball State) is our new RM. I think things will be just fine with both of them. Molly has the HAs on board already... just from wanting to know all about them and interacting with them a lot. Also, her office is right there next to the desk, so she definitely sees them more. Tiana is a 180 from Sara... but I think in a good way. I think. She's very... um... in your face. If she doesn't agree with something, she'll let you know right away. I think she's going to be great for Briscoe and will really snap our staff into shape... but I can't wait to see the first time she and Ian have a disagreement. I'd love to be a fly on the wall... or even just in the room making commentary.

Being in charge: It was a lot of fun, and a whole ton of responsibility. Great experience, but I'm glad Molly and Tiana are here now to take back over so I can get back to relaxing a little this summer. I was doing everything from walkthoughs of all the buildings with Bob and Marge to show damages, to sending out the damage billing, to approving people for overtime, doing the time cards and attending the professional staff meetings to keep everyone informed of what was going on in Briscoe. 

Painting: This was a HUGE victory on my part. Back in April, I told Sara I wanted to paint the apartment next year and she said it would be fine. I got the samples, picked my color and thought it was all decided. Then I was told it might not happen over the summer because of other projects. I asked if I could just do it like Tasha did and two of the grads at Forest did and was told no. So, I decided to fight this. I found a document that said GSs could paint and presented it to Molly, who said she supported me and talked with Interior Design. They still said no. So I met with Marge, made my proposal, she loved it and supported it and talked to Interior Design on my behalf... and they still said no. So I actually e-mailed the head of Interior Design to set up an appointment to go talk with her. I figured, if other people had been allowed to do it, why shouldn't I? So I didn't hear back from her, but this morning, had an e-mail from <i>her</i> boss saying they had talked and decided that because I had such a ""unfortnuate living arrangement this past year"" and that they ""knew me and knew I'd do a good job"" that they would give me an exception and let me paint. The living room and hallway is going to be ""Relaxed Khacki"" and the kitchen is going to be ""Poinsettia"" (basically, tan and red). Painting starts next Tuesday. Anyone want to help? :-) I'll buy you food at Wright.

Moving: Slowly but surely packing up. My room looks like a tornado hit it right now, but it's coming along. I can't actually start moving until Monday, but I'm helping Jamila move to Chicago all afternoon on Friday and all day Saturday, then have a check in and the Softball Game on Sunday, so I won't have a lot of time over the weekend. I hope to have everything boxed up by tomorrow night and then move it all on Monday, which leaves the big stuff that the EO staff has already said they'd help me move. One thing I've learned... if you're good to the EO staff, they'll be very very good to you.

Michigan: Tricia and I decided that we both would need a vacation at the end of summer, before her job kicked in and before my training started, so we decided to go to Michigan. Not exactly sure why we picked Michigan, other than the fact that neither one of us had ever been there and wanted to experience it together. We are staying at a Bed and Breakfast right on the beach in Grand Haven. It's called the <a href=""http://www.bbonline.com/mi/lookingglass"">The Looking Glass Inn</a> and we're both really excited about the trip coming up soon. It will be the perfect way to relax before training starts up that next week.

There's been other events, but those are the highlights of my summer experiences. I'm kind of ready for the school year to start back up, but only to see everyone again. Not necessarily to take the classes or have the homework/papers. But, that's life.

Have a good one! Back to packing..."

Every once in a while, one of the birds will fly up to it and the other one will leave. And then the original bird comes back and the other one leaves. They're trading off shifts keeping the eggs warm. It's really fun to watch. Tasha and I sit up here most of the afternoon and watch all the birds. It will be really cool when the eggs hatch. One of the birds is up there now and is just looking around like he/she has nothing better to do than keep the eggs warm..."

"event","+ The first HESA Summer potluck was tonight. It was really good. Ate WAY too much food, though. 

+ Jorg asked me to drive with him to Oregon. He said he didn't want to do the drive alone and would fly me back from Oregon. It's right in the middle of our crazy camp time... so I don't know if I can go or not... but talk about an opportunity. Getting to hang out with someone who is pretty much my mentor for three days on a cross-country drive. 

+ The summer crew rocks... except for the one who locked himself out tonight... twice. ::rolls eyes::

- My radio and some other items were stolen out of the bathroom this afternoon. I'm annoyed beyond words right now. I know this is going to sound horrible, but it's just one more reminder that I'm the one who got screwed over with the ""apartment"" this summer and I'm still getting screwed over because I don't get to move until mid-July. Yes, I get to move. I get to share the big apartment with Britt and have a kitchen and bathroom... I know... I'm lucky... but I'm still pissed that my radio got stolen."

I'll have a roommate (Britt), but he and I get along great and I'll still have my own bedroom. We'll share the living room, the kitchen and the bathroom, but I don't care. I won't be sharing a bathroom with 25 freshmen <s>men</s> boys and it will be quiet. This apartment has a balcony as well which will be a very nice place for the hammock that I'm planning on getting. 

Needless to say, after a year of living up here on the 10th floor, I'm really excited. And I don't know the new person who's coming in which makes it even better because I won't feel as bad about where she'll be living (my room now)."

"event","Hi,

  So I'm being a witness at a hearing commission today (the stage of a judicial conference where you have appealed the first decision and are now moving on to a formal hearing) for a guy from the 11th floor of Briscoe. Basically, he was really drunk, really pissed off that he was getting busted and took a swing at one of my RAs. He met with a BQ Judicial Officer who gave him a Reprimand and Warning, sanctioned him to an Anger Management Seminar and asked him to write a letter of apology to the RA he tried to punch. I personally think that was light, but whatever. I went to the first conference as well as a witness and his reasoning was that he was too drunk to even remember that night. Class act, I tell you.

  His reason for wanting an appeal: ""The other guys on my floor who were more sober than I was told me that I didn't try to punch an RA.""

Okay, let's start with the ""<i>more sober</i>"" bit... um... hi, I was completely sober and saw the whole thing. Two, remember that these are probably some of the same guys who ratted you out for smoking pot. How much do you really want to trust them. And finally, do you have any idea how easy you were getting off with a reprimand and a warning? I wouldn't have thought twice about probation and probably would have considered expulsion from housing for trying to punch a staff member. 

While I don't really have a problem coming to the one today to make sure he doesn't get away with anything, I'm also severely annoyed because it's cutting into my day. Should be interesting, though.

Toodles."

"event","Hi,

 So we just had a staff meeting that could quite possibly trump any meeting I had at McNutt... that includes the one where we all went around and talked about our favorite memory of the year (at the end of second year) and my very last one last year.

We (the GSs) decided a few weeks ago that our staff needed a morale booster. So, we e-mailed our managers and told them that we wanted to be in charge of the last hour of large staff this week and that we were up to something and not telling them what we were doing.

We wrote letters home to all of our RAs (and our CUEs) parents and asked them to write us a letter telling us why we were lucky to have their son/daughter on our staff. Within about a week, we started getting letters back. Some were short and sweet and to the point and others were poems, or top 10 lists, etc.

So tonight, all the agenda said for the last hour was, ""Surprise from the GSs."" Earlier in the day, we made cupcakes for them and decorated the conference room with balloons and streamers. We set up the cupcakes, one at each chair and put one candle in them. Just before they got to the room, we lit the candles (shh... candles in residence halls...) and turned off the lights. When we opened the door, they all walked in and just by that, they were so surprised. At that point, they thought that we had just gotten them food, and honestly, they'd probably be happy with that.

But we weren't going for ""happy."" We wanted more than that.

So we started singing ""Happy Un-Birthday To You..."" and told them that this was an ""Un-Birthday"" party and, just like with any party, we had cards for them that we were going to read aloud. They seemed surprised, but I think expected that we had just written out a card for each of them. So, I start reading, ""Dear Supervisors, you are lucky to have our daughter, Nicole on your staff because..."" and they all did a double-take. It was amazing. ""Wait, did he say daughter?"" ""Who wrote that?"" ""These are from our parents?"" were just some of the questions going around. So each of the GSs read letters from their own staff member's parents so that every staff member got to hear what his or her parents wrote to us. Several people turned bright red. Some cried. Most just smiled and tried not to make eye contact with anyone else.

So we read through everyone's letters and caela goes, ""Wow, this was awesome! Let's thank the GSs for putting this all together for us..."" and starts to clap. And we respond, ""Wait a minute. We're not done yet.""

Elyssa opens another letter and starts to read, ""Dear Briscoe GSs, you are lucky to have my wife, caela as your assistant manager because..."" and the look on caela's face was priceless. I really don't think she had ever thought that we had called her husband to ask him to do the same. Then Tasha followed with Sara's letter from her husband and Sara had to take her glasses off and keep dabbing at her eyes the whole time. It was so great. There was just this real sense of happiness in the room that hasn't been there in the large staff setting for a few weeks.

Just the morale booster we needed and I have a feeling this event will be remembered for a long time."

 Nothing overly special today except that people seemed to be in overall good moods. It was a pretty good day...

First, I kept getting complimented by the secretaries at Ethics for my notification forms being so complete. It's nice to get complimented by Dean Freeman for these things... but when the secretaries compliment you, you know you've done a good job.

Then, no one argued with anyone else at LT. Probably for the first time. AND... Sara and caela gave us all Valentine's presents... I got a $10 gift card to La Charreada. Who wants to go?!? They talked with our staffs to find out what we really liked and I guess my staff told them I liked La Cha. Good call.

Then, my professor let us out 20 minutes early from class and the Un-Valentine's Day party, while scarcely attended, was a lot of fun. Shelley, Tim, Ruder, Britt made up the guest list, but a few RAs stopped in for a bit and a few residents who were actually waiting for their j-board hearing came in to see what was in Elyssa's apartment. 

So yeah, eventhough there were no real ""Valentine-ey"" plans, it was still a good day and my bank account isn't hurting."

Things are weird. I really need to be sleeping right now and trying to get myself back on some kind of normal sleep schedule, but I have way too much on my mind right now and I need to get this stuff out before I try to go to sleep or I'll just lay in bed and think about it. This really is a bunch of rambling, so if you don't have time, skip on to the next entry on your friends' page.

I've been wondering a lot recently what it would have been like to actually accept NC State over IU. And I wonder if I've screwed myself over in terms of not getting a lot of the holistic experience. Granted, I'd consider myself pretty much an expert on RPS and the GS model (and knowledgable on the RC model) but IU is all I know. It wasn't surprising (not to sound full of myself here) that I got ""exceeds expectations"" on three out of six parts of my evaluation. I know the job so well and I put so much effort into it that there's no way I couldn't know it so well. But IU's housing system is one of ""yesterday."" It's not the way that most colleges do things and I worry that I won't have a firm enough understanding of a coordinator position to actually convince someone to give me a job. This light turned on when I found out I wasn't given a position in housing at NC State (one of the reasons I turned them down) which has a very different system for housing but it's starting to flash a lot more frequently. 

I also feel like things are different in general. I don't know exactly what I expected either. I mean, I've made some great friends that I know I'll never forget, but with just a very few exceptions, most of my friends from undergrad have completely dropped off the face of the earth. And I wonder if the same thing will happen in a year and a half. There are lots of good things about me staying here... I really don't think Melissa and I would be friends right now if I had left. I wouldn't have met all these new people. I would have had to learn an all new city/culture (but I don't know that it's a good thing that I didn't...) and I would have been much further away from home. I just feel like things have changed. I'm not big on change. At all. (Yes, I realize that statement completely defeats my thoughts about going somewhere else). I see people who, last year, I told myself I knew I'd be friends with them forever no matter how far apart we are and now, we barely speak and when we do, there's all kinds of weird silences. I'm sure all of this will pass but at least for right now, for the first time in five and a half years, I'm not happy at IU. I don't want to transfer and I certainly don't want to just go start working because I'd consider that quitting and I didn't work my ass off last semester to get a 3.81 just to call it quits. But this is making me wonder if I should have taken some time off between undergrad and grad to try something new and meet new people and not be so reliant on my friends from undergrad to keep me going, just to get blown off at times. This has been a very eye opening experience for me.

Another reason I'm not as happy here is there are times I don't feel like anything has changed. I'm still getting woken up at 4am by stupid drunk residents and have to go tell them to shut up. I live in a glorified dorm room when the other supervisors have huge apartments (yes, I know how spoiled that sounds). I have to put on sandals and walk down the hallway to go to the bathroom and come across vomit in the stalls. I'm tired of that. I want my own bathroom. I want to be able to make cookies without having to use someone else's oven. I want my home to really feel like home. (And by home, I mean where I am now). All of these things were issues I had when I was an RA. I don't feel like I've moved on from that. I know I've said that I don't really care where I live next year because it's more about the job than where I live, but that's mainly me trying to not rock the boat. But maybe some boat rocking needs to happen. I haven't expressed hardly any of this frustration to my supervisors and maybe that needs to happen before I sign my contract for next year.

I think some of this stems from some not-so-good decision making over the past year and a half that keeps getting thrown right back into my face. There are so many things I'd do differently if I could go back to January 2005. Or even August 2004. Yes, all the way back to August. Things that no matter how hard I try, I can't ever seem to get over. And if I were somewhere else, not being constantly reminded of my mistakes, I might be happier. During the day, I'm fine. It's at night when my mind starts racing. Those ""what ifs"" pop into my head. There's this whole world out there that I haven't explored (except for Costa Rica) where no one knows who I am. If I could afford it, I'd spend the summer in my car going to all kinds of different places. Trying new things. Meeting new people. I don't think I can even afford to go somewhere fun for Spring Break and I'm certainly not asking my parents for money. There are enough issues there already.

I know I need to do something. Make some kind of change because this sure isn't working out like I had planned. And I'm not sure if simply rearranging my room will be enough this time. And now that I've listened to the Graham Colton CD twice through, I should probably go to bed.

"event","Finally updating a bit... 
Training went really well. The feedback I got from my staff was very positive. Hopefully the other staffs agreed. I really want them to be as critical as possible because I'll be planning fall training next year and will want their honest input. Obviously, things like, ""I want only an hour a day"" won't happen... but you never know.

New Years was amazing. Still haven't gotten the pictures back. I have 10 or so pictures left to take on my camera that I'm saving for Monday's festivities in Briscoe. I will post them when I get them back.

Classes...
I still haven't had my Law class because my prof cancelled the first class. I've heard this is a very typical of him so I'm a little nervous about that. It's only an 8-weeks class, so I'm worried about being able to be prepared for the midterm and final.
My ""C"" class is alright. I think my class (out of the two sections) is definitely the ""fun"" group. The other class has fun people in it too, but just not as many. For half of the class, it's the 20 of us and then the other half of the time, the other class comes down to our classroom for a ""tag-team"" approach. I don't like that at all. I've gotten used to the small classes, so to have 50 people crammed into the classroom in Forest is not fun. Overall, it sounds like it's going to be kind of boring, but I think I'm going to learn a lot.
My Diversity class is awesome. There are two sections for that one as well. Tasha is in the other section. I thought it'd be like the ""C"" class, but apparently we have different schedules. Also, our first paper is 10 pages where the other class' is 5. I don't mind, though. It's an interesting topic. Also, she let us out an hour and a half early on the first day. And it's not like she just didn't feel like teaching. We covered everything we needed to cover and she let us go. Apparently, the other class was going to end 5 minutes early and the prof made them stay for another 5 minutes and talk to each other.

Today was a very relaxing day... slept in, worked out, drove Courtney over to Collins for her RAAC meeting, went to dinner, went to Happy Hour at Jungle Room with some HESA peeps and now I'm going to be staying in the building to help Tasha tonight. An outside group is using Briscoe tonight to host a party and the last time this group was here, it was crazy. I was a little disappointed becuase I wanted to go out with Allie, Debbie and Nick, but, as I look out the window and see how nasty it is outside tonight, I'm probably better off right here.

Tomorrow, I'll probably start working on homework and I think I'm going out to Bears for a little bit. Not sure who all's coming, but it should still be fun. Then Sunday is Potluck Sunday Night TV at Abby and Lindsay's. Should be fun."

"event","Pictures coming in a bit... but it was a very fun/relaxing New Year's in Millbrook. Some of the highlights...

* Not getting lost
* Not getting slapped by Emma (Abi's 1 and a half year old German Shepherd)
* Sending one of the cats flying acros the room simply by throwing a pen in the air.
* Playing with a talking Deer
* Watching Pulp Fiction
* Playing Courtney's drinking game where everytime they dropped the ""F-bomb"" during Pulp Fiction, we had to take a drink.
* Getting <b>really</b> tipsy/kinda drunk from said drinking game
* Setting off fireworks in Abi's back yard
* Having ashes rain on us from the airial fireworks
* Watching I Love the 80s for 84, 87 and 88
* Watching the ball drop for New York.
* Watching the New Year's celebration for Chicago
* Not having the keys locked in the car on the way back.
* Not having the car break down on the way back
* Spending about 9-10 hours in the car with Wiese catching up/letting her get caught up on her insults :-D
* Fun (hopefully) pictures
* Games of Uno
* Lots of lounging around

Now, I'm back at Briscoe where my room is really hot... about to enjoy a pizza and a beer or two and hit the sack. Tomorrow's activities involve getting new printer ink, hanging up a few signs and seeing some friends. All in all, a very relaxing break and one of the best in a long time."

"event","I'm in a much better mood today. I got a lot of things that I ::gasps:: actually needed, like jeans and new shirts. No sense in going into all of that now, but I just wanted to post a quote that my mom said last night on the way to church...

""Humm... all I have is a ten. It's alright to put a ten in and take a five back out of the collection plate, right?""

The first thing that came to my mind was Jeff Foxworthy's ""You Might Be a Redneck If..."" where one of the things is if you've ever made change in the offering plate. It gave me a really good laugh."

"event","Yo.
 I find it very strange that it's raining right now. This time last year, we were being unindated with snow. Not that I mind being able to get my car (or, at least, a car) out of the driveway without almost spinning off down the ""mini-cliff"" on the side of the driveway and into the gutter. I'm definitely caught up on my sleep and now I need to work to get my sleep schedule back to normal. No more of this 3am-1pm thing. It will surely come back to haunt me right around January 3rd.

I didn't mean to stay up so late last night, but I got into an interesting debate with my mom about the fact that in New Hampshire, the Bishop of the Episcopal Church is openly gay. 

<a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/08/05/bishop/"">Story here</a>

I was definitely impressed with my skills to debate and not to resort to the ""one-line zingers"" that left no room for conversation. After an hour or so, we decided just to call it quits for the night and go to bed... and even though my mom's opinion on this issue differs from mine, I was still happy we had the chance to debate on the issue and she was at least open to what I had to say. I also think it's completely alright that we ended the discussion still disagreeing with each other, but now she knows my position on this issue which helps explain why I have becomed disillusioned with my church's response (my specific church here in Louisville... not the Episcopal Church as a whole) to this issue. 

As I was debating this issue with her, I realized that I will probably be debating a varient of the same issue for the rest of my professional career in Student Affairs. And, it was reinforcing that I was able to stay calm the whole time and counter her arguements in a way that showed that I still had respect for her, but just disagreed with her opinion.

Anyways, off I go to put the cards under the Christmas tree."

"event","Hi,

  Break has been very uneventful so far... and I'm just fine with that. The majority of the days have been spent either running a few errands or just sitting around the house. I think my mom is beginning to get a little worried because I'm not out doing things, but really, after this semester, I'm just fine sitting by myself in the quiet without 50 freshmen running all around of my phone ringing every 10 minutes. I enjoy quiet. Yes, I'll probably get tired of it, but by then, it'll be almost time to head up to Abi's for New Years. 

Side note: this new Facebook thing where you can say how you know people... I started doing a little bit of that yesterday and wondered if the people could actually see what I wrote about them. For example, if I, say, work with someone and had some kind of a ""relationship"" with them, would they be able to see that I said that? I thought probably no, but decided not to chance it just yet. And, it's a good thing because I had 9 ""more info"" requests today when I signed in where I could see what people had written about me. I found that interesting and thought I should warn others...

Louisville peeps, if you're around, give me a call. It'd be nice to see people I haven't seen in a while. Adios!"

<B>January</b>
Started the year off at Abi's in Millbrook... lots of beer and wine... some drunken madness and a cell phone call or two. Got back and survived all of my women on my floor being accepted into their sororities, submitted my applications to IU and NC State.

<b>February</b>
Many late nights, a non-date Valentine's date, finding out Puccini's isn't all that it's cracked up to be, went to IU's Outreach program, met a ton of people, back-to-back-to-back interviews all day.

<b>March</b>
Went to NC State's outreach program, found out I was accepted to both IU and NC State. Chose IU. Given position as Graduate Supervisor, went on Spring Break, got really really drunk in my room with Courtney as a result of how things on Spring Break went, cleaned up after a friend, found out that I got placed in Briscoe.

<b>April</b>
Kind of a blur.. met my new boss at Briscoe, found out I would <i>not</i> be living in the big apartment, Thunder and all the drama associated with that, Kentucky Kingdom trip #1, found out I could work in McNutt over the summer.

<b>May</b>
Graduated! Moved to my 5th room in McNutt, starting working as the Phone Room Supervisor at the Auditorium, went to Courtney's house for Mother's Day.

<b>June</b>
Went to Megan's for the weekend and we went to Holiday World (my first time) then came back and went to Kentucky Kingdom again with the Summer Crew. Had lots of game nights, cooked a lot, grilled out some, started practicing for the softball game, kept working at the Auditorium. Big Brother 6 nights

<b>July</b>
Got really really sick over 4th of July weekend, took a few days off work to get better, check ins/outs, went to my first Santana concert with Amy, went to my first Opera.

<b>August</b>
Moved to Briscoe, started GS training, got really really overwhelmed with it all, found out my cat was dying, helped lead RA training, took duty during Welcome Week (never again...), had a small breakdown after being on duty during Welcome Week, started classes, really met people in my cohort, started hanging out with new friends.

<b>September</b>
Surprised my mom for her birthday, wasn't on duty all month, gave my first Grad school presentation, got my apartment finally all put together how I wanted it, went to a few football games, got really sick again, more papers and presentations.

<b>October</b>
Went to Indy for Megan's 21st and stayed at her house that night, on duty between her birthday and mine, my 23rd birthday which included several individual celebrations (including having Bob have our entire class sing to me), birthday party at Tasha's, more papers, presentations, a mid-term, started a mini-relationship, took Allie out for her 23rd birthday.

<b>November</b>
Went to Indy for the night with Allie, Debbie, Melissa, Ryan, Carolynn, Tim and Lilly; closed a new building (for me) for the first time, went home for just two days for Thanksgiving, came back early to finish work, went to Light up Bloomington, got a whole lot of work done in 48 hours, turned in final projects.

<b>December</b>
RA evals, my own evaluation, final exams, closed Briscoe, continued to hang out with new friends, but also made a much better effort to see old friends (need to continue that), Tickles died, home for winter break, argued with my mom about the validity of the excuse, 'just wanting to see what it was like' for cigarette smoking, played Car bingo with the dealership, had thermostat wars with my dad, lots of good food.

<b>Still to come...</b>
Christmas, more relaxing, lots of sleeping, trip to UK, going back up to Abi's for New Year's.
</lj-cut>

So yeah, overall, not a bad year. Hopefully a <i>lot</i> less drama in 2006."

"event","- Our hourly desk worker did not show up (again) today so, since I was/am the GS on call, I had to come back and work her shift for her... for free. She apparently decided she was going to quit without telling anyone and said she wasn't coming in today when the previous hourly called to see where she was. All I'm going to say is that she had better not come to me for a recommendation.

+ Sara came in and said she would sit at the desk and do the ""administrative"" stuff if I would help the residents when they came up. I hapily accepted her offer.

++ (yes, this deserves two) Abi called me today! I almost didn't answer my phone because I didn't recognize the number from a pay phone in Missouri, but I'm so glad I decided to answer. It was so nice to hear her voice and talk, even if it was just for about 10 minutes. I'm so excited to be going to see her for New Years (not that I wasn't excited before) but now I just kind of miss her even more because I had gotten used to not talking with her and just writing back and forth. But that's alright. I'm going to see her in three weeks!

I'm working on the ""Create your own theory project"" for my Theory class and I actually have to design a research instrument and justify its use and go step by step, describing its design. So, because of what I've leraned in Y520, I know that a qualitative, transformitive survey is the best bet. And, to back it up, there's a whole 80 pages in my Y520 text book about how to create sound qualitative transformitive surveys! Granted, a third of my paper will be cited from Mertens, but I don't care. You can't argue with sound, documented research. Bam! ::slaps book on cover::"

I was there last night and thought she looked familiar and then I thanked her for swipping my card and she said, ""You're welcome"" just in the same tone that she always did when she'd wait on us at her restaurant. I didn't put it together until I had left the check-out line, but I wanted to ask what happened. That was a good place.

Just thought those who know what I'm talking about would like to know. I was always afraid that the place went out of business because she had died or something."

"event","Today has been a wonderful day full of sleeping in, Dad's breakfast (seriously, if you haven't tried this, you don't know what you're missing), lots and lots of football and movies, Performance Management Assessments (alright, not the highlight of the day, but at least I'm getting them done now), and bonding with the cat over lots of petting and hooking up the IV. I'll be heading back to B'town tomorrow to get a jump start on the tons of work that awaits me, but I'm not thinking about any of that tonight. The only thing I'm thinking of right now is how good the kitchen smells and how I can't wait to crash on the couch in a food coma. So, while I'm waiting for dinner...

I'm thankful for...
 - my family who has been so incredibly supportive of my career choice and just of me throughout my life.
 - my friends who have been so great. I am truly blessed (or lucky, for those of you who aren't into 'blessings') that I have so many good friends. To the ones I haven't seen recently, we need to work on that. :-)
 - my health. Yes, I've definitely had some strange illnesses over the past year, but all in all, it could have been so much worse.
 - my job. I mean, yeah, sometimes it kind of sucks when the floor is loud or when I get woken up at 4am to go sit in the hall for two hours waiting with my RAs while IUPD gets a search warrant, but all in all, I'm going to graduate school for (almost) free. I get to live and eat for free and I've made some amazing friends this year and, just knowing that I can make an impact on my staff members by supporting them, listening to them cry and vent at 2am, sitting in the hallway with them at 4am, etc. makes it all worth while
 - my co-workers at Briscoe. It amazes me how different we are and that we get along so well despite those differences. I think we all complement each other so well and I can only hope that the LT next year is this close.
 - my former co-workers at McNutt. Especially the other members of the ""Fab 5."" We're about to lose another one to another city, but I have no doubt we'll stay in touch. Who would have thought that when we started RA class in March of 2002 that we'd be so close now. I love it.
 - And there are so many other things I am thankful for this Thanksgiving. To those who know me best, I hope you know how important you all are to me.
 
Happy Thanksgiving! It's off to the dinner table for me!"

"event","I have so much to do that I really shouldn't be taking the time to write in this right now, but I'd go crazy if I didn't have some kind of a break. Here's a run down of what I have to do when I get back from break...

U544 - FAR project - 45 minute presentation and 10-15 page paper on the Office of Student Ethics
U548 - Create my own Theory Project - 10 minute presentation and 10 page paper
U548 - My Personal Development - No Presentation (!), but a 15-20 page paper.
Y520 - Research Project on Freshmen Roommate Surveys - 15-20 page paper and no presentation (!)
U559 - 5-7 minute presentation and 3-5 page paper on PTO presence (live in) on other campuses compared to IU.

So, overall... an hour's worth of presentations and up to 70 pages to write in two weeks. Nice.

I really shouldn't even be going home because we only have dial-up there which means there's no way I can do any research. I'm contemplating trying to come back here on Friday afternoon so I can have all day Saturday and Sunday to do work in peace, but I feel that would cause considerable drama. My car is scheduled to be repaired on Friday and it'll take all day and my mom doesn't want me to bring either of their cars back here (swap until Christmas) because they've both been having issues but they refuse to get them checked out. So yeah, I have no idea what I'm going to do or how I'm going to get all of this stuff done in time."

"event","So this song I'm listening to right now is one of the best covers I've ever heard. It's Ray J's cover of Clocks by Coldplay. First of all, that song is just awesome to begin with and the cover is amazing. I don't know if it's downloadable or not, but if not, if you go to <a href=""www.launch.com"">www.launch.com</a>, it's on the first page as one of the new music videos. There's just a whole lot at the end that describes my frame of mind right now. I think I'm just ready for the break.

It's so different when you're a GS. Yes, I have the two nights off per month and three nights off once a semester, but I have a really hard time actually taking the time off. I know that Elyssa, Tasha and Ian are perfectly capable of taking care of the building, but there have been so many times when my RA staff has really needed me and wouldn't feel comfortable calling anyone else. Yes, I know I've kind of set myself up for them to depend on me and it's going to be somewhat of a shock next semester when I'm working so much at the Office of Student Ethics (by the way, I got my practicum there!) but I my #1 priority of being a GS is being there to support my RAs. That's why I hated the RC Model so much last year at McNutt. I actually talked about tonight with Shelley, Mins and Britt... the RCs did a good job of supervising, but were absolutely horrible at supporting. When it came to making sure B-boards were done, weeklys were turned in, programming forms were turned in, it was fine. But I wouldn't dare call at 2am, especially if my RC wasn't on duty because I'd be setting myself up to get yelled at for waking him up when he wasn't on call. And, yes, there have been times when I have become frustrated (mainly from lack of sleep) but when I'd stop and sit down for a minute and realize <i>why</i> I lost sleep, and how my RAs come to my room crying and usually leave laughing and smiling, it's totally worth it.

Wow... I don't really know where all that came from. I guess I'm just really looking forward to being home and hopefully getting to hang out with friends from home. It's definitely a challenge to have so many different groups of friends who really don't have a whole lot in common with each other) and I'm looking forward to seeing the old familiar faces.

And there was the offer to ""help out now and then"" and I know I should be mature about this and take whatever I could get, but really, I'm going to be just fine in either Admissions or Student Ethics where I do 10 hours a week and not be insanely busy over next semester and the summer. I do feel like e-mailing back though and saying they can't use my idea for training that I gave them (that they both gasped and got really excited about and wrote down). But, that'd be immature.

+ I got an interview with the Office of Orientation for the summer!!! This doesn't mean I have the practicum, but it's the first step and interviews weren't granted to everyone, so I still see it as an accomplishment.

- My car got hit today. While I was in 801 (which is also the police station... how ironic...) and whoever did it took off. I've filed a police report and the insurance lady is coming out tomorrow to look at it. There's not too much damage... the passenger side light is cracked and won't work anymore and there's a decent scratch both on the rear bumper under the tail-light and the left pannel just around the side from the tail light."

Anyways, an update about the rest of the GLACUHO fun...

Like I said in the last entry about GLACUHO, I got in bed around 10:45 and fell right asleep. And then, of course... 2am fire alarm. So, Monday morning rolls around and I go to class like the good grad. student that I am, come back to Briscoe, keep working on my midterm, have a 1:1 with Laura and, since it was her last one, I told her we could do whatever she wanted so we walked around outside for a while and found a park kind of behind the Alumni center that neither of us had been to, so we went there.

Then it was back for dinner at Briscoe and office hours. I was determined to finish my midterm in office hours, but that didn't happen between a meeting with two residents who are fighting with each other about quiet hours and some hard-core roommate conflicts on Fiona's floor. I ended up staying in the office until around 12:15, but I got it done. :-)

The next morning, Elyssa and I went to pick up the Suburban at 801, then it was back to pick up Carolynn and Tasha and we were off to Indy (via Starbucks in Martinsville). We got there and I went to the first session which was about maintaining balance during grad school and I found all kinds of cool resources, including the Mission Statement thing that I talked about last night. After that first session, the four of us went to lunch at a restaurant in downtown Indy and then it was back for three more sessions. The first two weren't all that interesting, but the last one was all about being inclusive of transgendered students in the residence halls and how so many people just don't think about it.

For example, for those of you who work in any kind of customer service position... when someone comes up to you and asks, ""Where is the bathroom?"" do you point them in the general direction of the bathroom<b>s</b> or do you point them in the direction of the bathroom of the gender that you believe, based on their apperance that they identify as?

So yeah, that was a really enlightening session. Especially with Briscoe going through renovation soon and the fact that the GSs this year basically get to have the say in what we want Briscoe to look like. 

After that session was dinner (Steak and mashed potatos...mmm...) which was wonderful. During her speech, Sara even gave a shout-out to Briscoe, at which, of course Elyssa and I had to yell ""DISCO BRISCOE!!"" and clap. 

Then it was back to Bloomington with Elyssa and Carolynn where we all got a chance to bond over different issues in our centers and other issues.

Now, office hours are almost done, then it's over to 801 to pick up the projector for the presentation tonight during large staff, then to the bank to cash a few checks and then back here to clean my room for the ""Wacky Staff"" meeting after large staff. Tomorrow and Friday are days full of meetings and then it's up to Indy for the night with the HESA crew!! :-)"

I will - love unconditionally
I will - strive to do something at least once a day that makes me happy.
I will - encourage others to look past outer apperance to see the beauty that lies within.
I will - stay committed to myself and my values.
I will - take time to enjoy the good things in life, the things that make me happy.

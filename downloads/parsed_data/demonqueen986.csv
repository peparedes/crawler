"event","Okay, so it's been forever and a day again. Sorry. I've pretty much resigned myself to the notion that I'm never going to be updating this at any sort of regular rate. So, updates in life, the universe and everything.

CSI: broke my heart, and lost my viewership. Ditto Lost. Am currently a HUGE fan of the Office, still big into Bones, and hugely into the new CBS sitcom The Big Bang Theory. That's my TV watching in a nutshell.

Writing-wise, I'm working mostly on original novels. I've got a few ideas in the works, not sure which will manage to make it to fruition, and which won't, but that's a ton of fun.

Life-wise, I'm working at Safeway. I'm a checker. It's not much fun. In fact, I hate it. But, it's a paycheck, so that's a good thing. I'm looking for a replacement for that job, but so far, I'm pretty stuck. At least the people I work with are cool, for the most part.

So, yeah. I can't really think of what else to say at the moment. My attention's pretty consumed with my phone conversation. I'll write more later."

"event","Okay, so it's been more than a year since I updated this thing. Um... yeah. Not sure what else to say on that count. Let's see what's gone on in the last year and a few months, shall we?

Pirates of the Caribbean ended its trilogy with a super cute third film, totally confirming all my WAFFy beliefs about Will and Elizabeth.
Harry Potter finished with a seventh book that I absolutely loved, but hated the ending of (frankly, the death of Severus Snape will haunt me forever, and it was followed by a crappy epilogue. What the hell's up with that?).
Sarah ended a great season trapped under a car, possibly dying. (CSI)
I have quit going to college, and am going to join the military instead.
I've been going to the gym for about 16 hours a week, for the last six months.
I have finished precisely zero serious writing projects, and started five or six more.
I have found myself a new movie obsession: MirrorMask, the movie by Neil Gaiman and Dave something. It's great.
and...
I have gotten into this one-sentence challenge thing, where you get fifty one-word prompts that you have to write one sentence on each, all dealing with the same pairing. It's super fun.

So, that's my life, in a nutshell. Ridiculous amounts of time spent at the gym, a bit of schitzophrenia (writing-wise), and very little else. It's kinda funny when you think about it."

I was a bit excited, being the rampant shipper of all things Geek-Love-related that I am. (I mean, come on: my MSN handle is the Geek Love Goddess, for pity's sake!) So, yeah, I was a bit overly excited, and my MSN was on the fritz, meaning I had no friends to squeal to, and I had to vent somehow. So, that's the explanation for that. Just wanted to clear that up.

"event","To use my favorite Xander-expression. It has been a <i>long</i> time since I updated this thing! My goodness. Well, let's see what's been going on: I'm currently between quarters at school, taking my spring break; my writing has stalled, which is very frustrating; and I'm spending the weekend at my BFF Sarah's so we can go to Sakura-con, which is in Seattle tomorrow. As I type, she's playing DMC3, wandering around in this fronking huge tower heading towards Gigapede, which is this freakin' huge worm-like monster that she has to beat. So... yeah. Anyway, how great is it that it's only March and already I've broken nearly all of my New Year's Resolutions? This is fabulous. This way, I have nothing to live up to in the rest of the year: I can just kick back and relax.

I've been playing a lot of MapleStory the last few days, and this Kerning City Jump-quest is kicking my ass. It's not helped by the fact that every time I get into the freaking room my computer starts to act up and become all jerky, which really screws up your timing. But anyway, so yeah. I just wanted to get myself back in the habit of updating this thing, because even if I'm not sticking to my resolution, I should at least try to say something every so often."

To men that are bad for me. But not to the truly evil ones. My dream last night was proof of that, at least. The psychotic serial killers who mutilate their victims, torture them, psychologically manipulate them, those are the evil ones. And thank god I'm not truly attracted to those, but then, who would be? I think that's about as evil as you can get, and I'll be happy to forget the details of my little dream. Thank god it didn't feel like one of my prophetic ones. And, okay, that probably sounds stupid, but what else would you call it when you dream something that later comes true, in minute detail?

"event","Well, it's Severus' birthday today. As I seem to do on the birthday of pretty much everyone I feel like I know, it's time for introspection. So, here's the million dollar question, Regis: do I form unnatural attachments to fictional characters in order to compensate for my lack of connections to the people around me? And if I do, can that really be considered as a wholly bad thing? Especially when you consider the kind of characters I tend to become attached to? Or should I stop indulging my own short-comings by allowing myself to feel like I know these people better than I possibly can, and instead, take a chance on someone I meet out in the wide world, knowing that with my personal tastes, the chances are better than not that I'll end up forming affection for some serial killer, or general not-nice-person. It's a question I sure can't answer, but one that's been bothering me for a while now. And this morning it truly hit me: I have horrible taste in people. With the exception of Sarah, I cannot think of a single person I have ever been attached to who wasn't poisonous to me, in some form or another. I'm attracted to deadly men, to venomous women, and utterly repulsed by those who could be good for me. Given this fact, it seems logical that I keep my relationships in the fictional world. But is that really any healthier? Or am I killing myself softly, avoiding the world and just refusing to try; convincing myself that if I do, I'll end up regretting it.

I'm not really looking for any answers, I know there aren't really any to be given. It's just been bothering me. Anyway, happy 46th birthday, Severus. May your year be better than mine. Although with your history, I somehow doubt it. At any rate, try not to get killed."

<font size=""+1""><u>New Year's Resolutions for the Year of 2006:</u></font>

I resolve to...

1) ...finish writing ""Clean Hatred"", ""Gods Among Men"" and ""A Stitch in Time"".
2) ...fully plan my Final Fantasy VII trilogy and be writing on it smoothly.
3) ...write an original novel.
4) ...write daily, for a length not less than one hour.
5) ...organize and decorate my bedroom.
6) ...pass all my classes. To this end, I will study regularly and do my work when it is assigned.
7) ...actually learn and become proficient in HTML. At least begin learning CSS.
8) ...get my MapleStory characters through their second job advancement.
9) ...beat Final Fantasy VII.
10) ...update my LiveJournal every day.

Wow, that's a pretty ambitious list, if I do say so myself. Oh well, that's what they are, and there's no changing them now. I just hope there are enough hours in the days to come to allow me to complete them. Sarah resolved to socialize more. I wonder if I should try that? Nah, don't really feel like it. Besides, she's more outgoing than I am, anyway."

"event","I'm home!! I don't think I've ever been so glad to set foot in my bedroom before.

This was the trip from hell. Seriously. I'll give you the Cliff's Notes version.

It's normally a thirteen to fifteen-hour drive from my house to my grandparents' house in Cali, depending on the weather. Our trip down took twenty-seven hours, with only one three-hour nap in the car while waiting for the sun to come up. The trip was this long for several reasons: one, we were transporting a Volkswagen bug back to LA, so we were hauling a U-Haul trailer behind us. Now, I'm not sure if you know this, but the speed limit on one of those is 45 miles an hour. Instead of the 70 the road usually runs. Add a few hours. Then, we decided, on the (incredibly bad) advice of my aunt Ann (who, incidentally, owns the VW), that instead of taking I-5 through the Siskiyou Mountains (We were afraid there would be snow. Let me tell you, snow should have been the least of our worries.), we would take highway 299 or something like that, west across Oregon to Highway 101, which runs all up and down the West Coast. Big Mistake. The road across took nearly two hours, then another six or seven down 101 to another highway across to Redding. Another three hours. Back on I-5, having stopped for three hours to sleep on 101 and wait for sunrise, and we're exhausted, and so sick of being in the car.

The rest of the trip down ran smoothly, and 27 hours after we leave, we arrive in Modesto, at my Grandmother's house, just in time for dinner.

The visit was great. I got to see my family, with the exception of the LA crowd, since I stayed in Mod with my grandparents and sis. That was cool. Didn't end up getting to San Fran, for several reasons, none of which is particularly important.

Now, for the trip back up. We're not dragging a car and trailer this time, which means we can drive the full speed limit. Yay! Oops, there's this huge storm system that is covering Northern Cali and Southern Oregon. A rock slide has shut down I-5. The highway patrol is diverting traffic through Weed to Highway 97, as long as you have chains. We do, so no prob. Problem is, visibility is shit, we can't see anything, and it's snowing. So, we decide to turn back, see if we can hit highway 36 across to 101 again and take that up the coast past the problem. We run back down I-5 to Red Bluff (an hour and a half back the way we came, mind), and hit the highway. Sun's starting to set, but we can see the river's flooded its banks big time. We start worrying the road's going to be washed out. And around we go again, back to Red Bluff (the road almost was washed out, btw), for the third time in the last twelve hours. We rent a motel room to stay for the night. In the morning, we find out it was a good decision, because 101 is closed down everywhere because of floods, and slides, and what have you. We hit I-5 this morning, and run it all the way up, no more problems.

All in all, the trip from hell. But the visit was good. As long as we weren't traveling."

"event","Well, I have to say, that was odd. I don't think I've honestly thought about him in years, and now all of a sudden, I dream about him. 

Him, is Justin, a guy I went to Junior High with, and who I had a <i>huge</i>, as in massive, crush on. He was one of my circle of friends at school, and I guess you could say we were sorta tight. But I thought I had gotten over that, and now he shows up in my dreams?

Here was the sitch: I was enrolled in some sort of ballroom dance class, don't ask me why. My partner was Ivy, a friend of mine from High School, and the entire class was lined up sitting against one wall while the instructor lectured us. Well, the guy next to us had this set of DVDs with him that were supposedly an animated Phantom of the Opera, but turned out to be an animated Lord of the Rings instead. So, in my dream, I end up playing the role of Frodo, you know, going to school on a pony, the wizened wizard beside me, the whole shot. Anyway, after classes, I walk out to find my car, and I'm walking up and down the parking lots looking, and I pass a guy in a group of kids that kinda draws my eye. He looks straight at me, but doesn't say anything, still having his conversation, and I leave that parking lot, heading for a different one, closer to the school. I'm walking down the lot, when I hear a voice calling my name. I turn around, and there he is, the guy from earlier. He's all ""Katherine, is that you?"" and I look at him in confusion, and then simultaneously we say, ""Justin?"" and then, alone, I say, ""Justin, is that really you? What are you doing here, I haven't seen you in years.""

So, we get to talking, and we're lounging in the grass, talking about college (he was in a university, but he decided that wasn't the place for him and came here instead, and I mention my sister doing the same, which is ridiculous because my sister was never in college, but I know it's completely true when I say it), when he kind of absently says, ""I'm trying to ask you out, and I can't seem to do it."" So, I say, ""Well, if it makes you feel better, I'm going to say yes,"" which is kinda a paraphrase or adaptation from this fanfic or movie, or something, where the guy says something about how after a while, he's going to ask the girl to marry him, and she goes, well, I'm gonna say yes. But that's not the point. Anyway, that seems to break the tension, because we get up and I just notice that he's now wearing this bright yellow Member's Only jacket, you know, like from the eighties (this makes total sense if you know I've been watching that We series I Can't Believe I Wore That, and the other night was the 80s). I reach out and unzip the thing and he smiles and we walk away, back up the sidewalk toward the college.

So, his friend is waiting by Justin's car, and he yells ""Hey, are we gonna get going, or are you too busy for that?"" So Justin moves toward his car and unlocks the doors, they open them, and then stand there, while Justin turns to me and says something, I can't really remember what, but it involves something related to kissing, because I reply ""You haven't done anything yet,"" with a smile, and walk away to find my car. He and his friend get in his car and start it up, beginning to drive away, and I start to worry that I don't have a car, because I rode the pony to school, but I eventually find it, and start to drive away, for some reason taking a detour through a parking lot where I buy eggs and toast and there's this guy from one of the Denny's commercials saying something about wanting his eggs on top of hashed browns and bacon and sausage (yes, I realize this is weird, even for this dream, but it's taking care of the unnatural portion, which all dreams must have. Of course, the Frodo thing could have been my unnatural quota, but whatever). So, I'm driving away, putting yellow salt on my egg (don't ask me why the salt was yellow, it just was), when I encounter Justin in his car, and his friend says he's been trying to think of what pet to buy, so we go to the adoption center, where I know I don't want a pet that's a vegetarian, and I don't want a fish, and we decide to adopt this little puppy that's just been weaned (as in, while we were there, they pulled the mother out, and I know this is not the way they do it, probably, but this was just a dream), and we're walking out the door, puppy in arms, and then I woke up.

God, I have some weird ass dreams. But I think what confused me most about this one was, why Justin? God, I haven't thought about him in a long time, and now he pops up in my dreams? It's weird, I tell you."

I mean it, it was probably the best film I've seen in quite some time. Of course, that's not saying much considering the last film I saw in theatres was Star Wars: Episode III. And we all know what a bloody awful mess that was, don't we? Anyway, so I saw GoF, and it was great, despite the fact it left out nearly all my favorite parts from the books. I mean, we never even got to see Bill and Charlie, much less see them dueling with tables and Percy being a great poncy git. But that's neither here nor there. I don't want to say too much right now, considering it started just yesterday, and my BFF Sarah hasn't seen it yet (we'll be going to see it together in December), but suffice to say, it was brilliant. And my Severus had an absolutely fabulous scene. I'm sure, if you've seen the film, you know the one. The thing with the sleeves had the entire theatre howling with laughter. Anyway, again, besides the point. So, Sev was fantastic, Krum was perhaps a bit too pretty, but you can't have everything, and Lucius, my Lucius, was unbelievably deviously-sexy, as always.

I'm not too happy with the writers of LOST right now either, though. I mean, they're seriously going to kill Shannon off. Honestly, they're going to kill her. I knew I didn't like Ana Lucia. I knew there was a reason that from the minute we saw her in that flashback of Jack's I hated her. I knew it couldn't all be my rampant Jate fan-sensibilities going haywire. I mean, I admit that was some of it, but I knew it wasn't all. I just... God, why does this have to happen? First Boone, now Shannon? What are they going to do next, kill off Vincent and make it a clean sweep of that little family? Jesus.

Sorry, I know I'm probably more upset than is needed, but honestly, I don't see why they're doing this. Stupid fucking overly-paranoid Ana Lucia."

Jack. Jack can fix her. Get her back to Jack, Jack can fix her. Stop the bleeding and run, carry her back to Jack. I mean, he couldn't save Boone, but that's because he didn't know what was really wrong with him. A gunshot he can fix! Right? I mean, he has to fix her. He can't let Shannon die. Shannon can't die. If she dies, who's gonna make Sayid happy? Who's gonna be a bitch, and be funny, and make everything okay, and take care of Vincent? So see, she can't die. Cause if she dies, everything's gonna be wrong.

She can't die. Jack can fix her. Sayid will run her back to Jack, and Jack will fix her, and everything'll be okay, and they'll kill Ana Lucia instead, and everyone will be happy.

Which, in my house, means we get to loot our own stash of trick-or-treater candy, safe and secure in the knowledge that no child is going to come to our door seeking chocolate or whatever else we might be inclined to give because we live out in the middle of nowhere. Plus it's raining here. A pretty safe bet we're not going to receive more than two visitors this year, at most. At most!

"event","I've been having some really weird dreams lately. In last nights, I was back in Modesto, driving down McHenry, being chased by someone, I don't really know who, all I know is that it had to do with the guy I saved earlier near I-90 where I'm living now who wanted to marry me, and I was looking for the Taco Bell, trying desperately to get there. It was imperative that I get to that Taco Bell. The weird thing is, that Taco Bell isn't there anymore. Last I knew, it was an Enterprise Rent-A-Car. It was always my favorite Taco Bell, though, for all that it was difficult to get out of. It was right next to a Carl's Junior, and it always seemed to have the best food out of all the Taco Bells in Modesto. Not really sure why.

Anyway, that was last night. The night before, I was Hermione Granger. The whole of Hogwarts was living in this huge forest or jungle thing, fighting Voldemort. I was calling Professor McGonagall 'Aunt Minerva', living in this cave underground with a huge library dug straight into the rock. At one point, Harry and Ron were kidnapped so I ran away to look for them, because I thought I had nothing left in the camp. And here's why: Severus Snape had gone back to the Dark Lord. I read a book on it. I was in love with him, so I felt desperately lost, mourning for the love of my life. Anyway, I ran away and was found by this huge group of people, who included Anna-Lucia and the other three tail-end survivors from 'Lost', along with a bunch of other random people. Anyway, they also had Harry and Ron, and insisted that the three of us couldn't go back to our camp unless we competed in this weird relay thing. So, we did, but we kept being attacked by parts of the forest that had human heads. You know, tree roots that were detached from trees and had male heads, that sort of thing. Meanwhile, I wanted to get away from them, but Harry and Ron kept saying, ""Come on, 'Mione, you need to quit studying and get outside once in a while."" So, we eventually made it back, I broke away at the last trial and arrived at camp just ahead of the others to find that Voldemort and his Death Eaters had attacked while I was away and there was a battle going on. I joined in, fighting off Death Eaters and keeping other people safe. Then, I saw Severus Snape, and all that flew out the window. He grabbed my arm and dragged me down into the library, where we declared our love and decided to stay until we figured out where we wanted to go. Then I woke up.

I swear, sometimes I wonder about myself. These dreams cannot be normal."

But a girl can dream.).

Anyway, yeah, the Sox are in it, go Sox!

But I am so frustrated at how little has been resolved between Charlie and Amita! Arrgghh! I mean, I love that they're working on keeping the tension up, and I guess I wouldn't want them to just jump into everything being cool with their relationship, but still, it's kinda frustrating that he hasn't even talked to her yet. I can see where the writers might be into keeping up tensions, but aren't they playing the 'romantically-hapless mathematician card a bit to heavily? But never mind that. I'm just glad that a relationship isn't completely out of the realm of the possible yet. So, I guess I'm not exactly as frustrated as I thought. Huh. *shrug*"

"event","Wow, I just read that last entry, and could I have sounded more spastic? I fully feel I need to apologize to anyone who read that, because it was almost ridiculously obnoxious. So, sorry.

Anyway, moving on, the title to this entry is from one of my favorite movies, ""Erin Brockovich"", and is so totally true. The last few days have been absolutely wonderful. I mean, on Wednesday it was my birthday, I turned nineteen, and I got another of my favorite movies, ""Pride and Prejudice"", the version done by A&E, along with 45 dollars in gift cards to bookstores, and you know what that means: Shopping Spree! Anyway, then I totally updated <i>Clean Hatred</i>, even though it's, like, weeks late, but whatever, I still updated. Then there was the Numb3rs episode yesterday, plus a really good Lost on Wed. And then, today, I went and got a new video game (<i>Hunter: The Reckoning</i>, which is totally fun, and really violent, which is always cool), and while I was at Game Stop, I picked up the Strategy Guide for <i>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</i>, to use as a resource while I novelize the game (God, this is taking forever to do, too. I swear I would never have started this project if I had any idea how much of a Big-Bertha-sized clusterfuck it would turn into). 

Anyway, while I was there, I saw the box for <i>Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children</i>, the movie, and I was able to reserve a copy, which means that, in January, when it's released here, I will fully already have a copy waiting for me. I'm so excited. Oo, plus, on the KOTOR front, I had inspiration the other day, and actually started writing in it again. And yeah, it's the epilogue, but still, it's writing. I haven't honestly written anything in weeks, so I was pretty excited on that account.

Anyway, that's about it, for now. Oh, except that I totally got an 80% on my Precalc II quiz that I took on Thursday, which completely rocks. Can I just say how absolutely great my week has been? Now all I can do is hope that things continue in this wonderful vein."

I'm just so excited. I feel like running outside and screaming hysterically. Really, really loudly. Okay, since I'm sure you're confused right now, I'll let you in on a little secret: I'm a Geek Love Goddess. I'm not kidding, I endorse Geek Love wherever I can find it. Grissom/Sara, Hermione/Sev, if there are two geeks in a fandom, chances are, I'm gonna ship them. Of course, one of my favs for the past year or so has been Charlie/Amita, from Numb3rs. So, I was so excited last week when Navi Rawat was added to the credits as a full-fledged character, not just a recurring role, as Amita. And then, tonight, I almost screamed so loud I woke up the entire house when Charlie finally asked her out. But, I managed to restrain myself. Then, (if you don't want to know spoilers for tonights eppy, don't read the next sentence. Actually, you probably shouldn't have read the last one. But, moving on), when the date went so badly, I was literally yelling at my television, ""If you break those two up after only one date, I will kill you (the producers/writers, not the TV. I love my TV) After a full-on year of sexual tension so thick you couldn't cut it with a buzz-saw, we've gotta get more than one measly date out of it."" And then, at the end, what do they do, but have my dearest, darlingest Charlie actually use the phrase ""Geek Love""!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!! I swear, I almost had an aneurysm, I was so worked up. I just had to run upstairs and get this written. Cause, I mean, I've been idolizing those two as the pinnacle of Geek Love for like, more than a year now, and to finally have it confirmed, well.... And was his expression not the cutest in that last scene with Larry? I seriously was, like, melting into a little Katherine puddle on my couch. I was grinning so wide it felt like my face was going to split in two. I gave myself a headache, how odd is that? 
But, anyway, I've gotta sign off now, since I've now used way more exclamation points than should be allowed in this post, and I could rant for decades about how excited this episode made me, but I should move on. I should get to sleep anyway."

"event","Dreams are really strange things. Why is it that some of them you remember vividly, while others only a vague impression remains?

I fully remember everything about the dream I had a few nights ago, where a campus priest was trying to kill me with chain-saw wielding minions, but I can't remember anything about the dream I just had other than that it involved Taco Bell, sex and Alexis Bledel. That's weird, isn't it?

But I do remember they were both really weird dreams.

Sometimes, I question my sanity."

"event","OMG, isn't Sessh just the prettiest? I love it when Sar makes pretty things for me. They always seem to turn out so prettily. And we can clearly tell by how incoherent this entry is that it is absurdly late, can't we? I think I'm just gonna go to sleep, and not try to talk anymore, cause I'm clearly not capable of it at 12:30 in the morning."

"event","I cannot believe I'm doing this. What makes me think I can keep up this journal when my Xanga one fell to the wayside in less than a month? I am clearly quite insane.

Now, that being as it may, I shall strive to update this journal at least once a week with my ranting about whatever strikes my fancy, from my writing projects, to anger about the continued UST between my fav. CSI couple (GSR all the way, baby!) when the new season starts (*squeals* EEE! September 22!!), to politics, to anything that particularly happens to inspire me on any given day. But I will try not to forget about this thing's existence.

Oo, happy thought! Now I have somewhere to scream when one of my fanfic authors leaves me somewhere that pisses me off particularly hugely! Goody, then Sar won't have to hear about things that don't concern her in the least. That should make her happy, at least.

And, oh my God, could I have used more exclamation points in this entry? I sound like a crazed teeny-bopper fangirl. *shudders* I better leave before my punctuation becomes any more atrocious."

I guess I good update would be in order.  My husband and I are still living in our house.  My husband has switched jobs (to a much lower paying one, but I'm not bitter....OK maybe just a little) and has now decided that he hates it and would like to teach (teachers here don't make bad money and I am hoping this will be his last career move for awhile).  I am still slaving away at work with little to no appreciation for having a work ethic or busting major ass all the time (my raises aren't appreciation enough, a promotion and a good job from my boss once a month when I accomplish all of my goals would be nice).  My life has been pretty much one being boring mass of blah!
I work way too much and get aggravated way too easily.  This doesn't sit well with my husband as my aggravations about other things are usually taken out on him.

What else....my husband desperately wants children and I am still anti-children.  This has lead to many a fight but everything always gets resolved when I tell him I am sure I will eventually want children I just don't feel stable enough right now to bring a child into the world.

I someone see this journal becoming one big rant....I think I need that outlet."

I really miss home around this time of year and not just for the drunken stupor that everyone drinks themselves into but because of tons of people coming together to experience a different culture.  I miss my ""coonass"" friends and sitting on campus, starting the ""pit"" at 7 in the morning while keeping an eye on our Port-A-Potty just in case a stranger decides they want to use it without our permission (dammit we paid for it there will be no stranger stuff in there), and awaiting parades were beads will come down like rain.  So for those of you celebrating have some fun for me I'll be up here eating my king cake (see my in-laws aren't horrible people they send me king cake every year) and throwing beads to myself :)."

"event","I always knew that a day would come when I would have to say goodbye to someone so special in my life.  And while that day has not come yet, a certain turn of events has made me realize that it could come soon.  I found out last night that my grandmother who basically help raise me is in the hospital with pneumonia.  What makes it worse is that she has had Alzheimer's for about 8 years or so.  In that time I always hoped that it was just a phase and that my grandmother who always had ice cream with Hershey's chocolate syrup waiting for me when I got off the bus from school or the woman who let me pick out as much junk food as I wanted at the grocery store during the summer (much to the discontent of my mother) would never leave me and would remember me again.  I always imagined that I would bring my children to visit her and she would be at my wedding, but she wasn't able to come to my wedding and I now I have to come to understand that she will probably never see my children.  What makes it harder is I never knew my grandfather (her husband) because he died when my mom was really young, so that whole part of my family will be gone.  I often cry because I never knew my grandfather and wish I knew more about him.  My mom doesn't talk about it because she either doesn't remember much or it hurts her to do so.

But what makes it absolutely life shattering is the fact that I haven't seen her in 3 years.  How could I let myself choose to be so selfish and not try to visit the woman that taught me so much and always thought I was a perfect angel no matter what I did?  Instead I let my fear of breaking down when I saw her and getting upset that she wouldn't remember and that she was no in a nursing home that I absolutely hated (because the one she was in previously shut down) get in the way.  And no matter how much my mom tells me that she wouldn't want any of the grandchildren or her children for that matter to see her the way she is I still will always feel guilty.  From what I hear she doesn't talk much and just sits there with a blank stare, not at all like the woman I new that always had a smile on her face and carried herself with such grace and dignity.  She had everything to be proud of, she raised five children by herself and they all turned out to be wonderful, but she has no memory of that.  

It breaks my heart to know that I'll get a phone call one day saying I need to come back to Louisiana because my ""Maw Maw T"" left us.  I'm having a hard time keeping myself together knowing that she is  in the hospital I just don't know what it will do to me to know that is so much worse.

So for those of you who pray, please keep my grandmother in your prayers and for those of you who don't pray please keep her in your thoughts."

"event","So apparently last weekend my husband and I totally didn't get the memo that after a Virginia Tech game you are supposed to wear a V-Tech shirt the next day.  We went on our Sunday ""tradition"" breakfast to IHOP and we were swarmed by people in Tech shirts (Virginia Tech not Louisiana Tech ).  I think we got a few funny looks too because we were not sporting maroon or orange.  So tomorrow morning I'll make sure to wear at least a maroon shirt so I am ""hip and cool with it."" HA!  So anyway, I figured it was time for an update since I haven't done that in awhile.  Roanoke is great, we live a mile from the mall, Wal-Mart, Target, Best Buy, and several good eating establishments so I am happy about that.  My job is going great, it is more laid back than the Martinsville office for the company, but I still do miss my co-workers in Martinsville.  We really like our apartment and the cats love it too, they even think we have a second bedroom for them as that is where they hang out most often.  I think it helps that there is a big window in there right next to a tree with an abundance of squirrels.  My husband is leaving Sunday for a conference in Chicago, I am jealous because I haven't been to that city yet, but at least I'll have some quiet time to myself, watching whatever I want on TV with plenty of chick flicks involved.  Well that is about all the time I have for today I hope to update more often but I have made that promise before....."

I think I am somewhat in shock with periods of reality (when the crying starts). Thank you for everyone that has e-mailed and called me asking if my family is OK. They are fine nothing happened to them as they were fortunate enough to not be in the path of the storm. I do have some family members in New Orleans that have just recently been heard from. They got out before the storm hit and are now with family members in Lafayette. They are pretty sure they have nothing to go back to. My heart, thoughts, and prayers go out to everyone in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida. Also a big thanks go out to the volunteers who are giving up their time to help the now homeless of Louisiana, what are you are doing is a truly amazing thing and you should be admired by all and inspire others to volunteer as well.

"event","... so I contacted our human resources girl to find out if I was in fact going to be able to transfer to our Roanoke billing office.

Here is a little background since I just realized I may not have posted the whole story:

My husband was offered a position (the same as he has now) in Roanoke (Virginia for those of you who forgot I live here now) in July right before we left to go to Louisiana for a couple of weeks.  He gladly accepted (anything to get us out of boring as all get out Martinsville).  While I was excited about moving to a ""real"" city, I was also worried about my job situation, taking in to account that I had JUST gotten insurance in June (thus taking me off of Carl's extremely expensive insurance) and a raise, and I was getting promoted when I got back from Louisiana.  But wait!  maybe there was a way to keep it all!  You see the company I work for has offices all over Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, and other states in the area, and even better their main office is in Salem (next door neighboors with Roanoke for the geographically challenged) and a billing office in Roanoke.  So maybe I thought, just maybe I could transfer if there was a job opening.  When I got back from Louisiana I had to tell my boss that we may want to hold off on that promotion because I was leaving the office by the end of the month and moving to Roanoke because of my husband's transfer.  While she was upset (hey I guess so she has asked more than once if I could be cloned!  so i expected her to be shocked and upset) but was more than open to the idea of getting the corporate office to transfer me when I asked if it would be possible.  She made a phone call to human resources, human resources made a phone call to the Roanoke billing office, and boom yes there was indeed an opening at the Roanoke office doing what my promotion would have had me doing.  So Tuesday I had an informal interview (over the phone so i wouldn't have to miss work of course) with the manager at the Roanoke office.  In her exact words ""I have no problem with you tranfering here, I'll let human resources know and she should contact you soon.""

Ok so today comes and almost goes and I still haven't heard anything.  Now keep in mind the cost of living in Roanoke is WAY different than that in Martinsville so me having to find a job would need to start happening like NOW so I would possibly have a job once we moved there, because having only one source of income is not an option at the moment.  So as said above I contacted human resources to see what was going on reminding them that the move would be soon so I need to know something like now.  I was so scared that she was going to say ""well we reconsidered and even though the account manager liked you we just don't think it will be possible at this time.""  But she said ""I just finished talking to the account manager and the position is yours if you want it!""


WOOO HOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  No more stressing out about having to live like a homeless person for a month or so until I found a job.  And get this it comes with another raise since it is considered a promotion!!!  And even though I used all my vacation time when I went to Louisiana I will get a couple of days off (paid) to move.  I love the company I work for!"

I don't know what I was thinking when I scheduled a 5:30am flight because my cousin's wedding was last night and we didn't leave until after midnight.  So I got maybe an hour of sleep before having to catch my flight and was next to impossible to sleep on the plane with the damn kid that sat behind me.  I came home and slept for about three hours and am now cleaning the apartment so it doesn't look too horrible for my in-laws when they get there tomorrow.  Hopefully I can finish that soon and then go to bed so I will actually wake up tomorrow morning for work.  I really hate that I have to go in tomorrow at work and let them now I will no longer be able to work after mid-August but hopefully that won't hate me too much and find out if there is an opening at the corporate office taht I can be transfered to.  Ok back to cleaning...."

I had a really good time and finally got to do some heavy drinking in which everyone kept up with me.  My dress drank some wine too, need to go to the dry cleaners to fix that....  Now I am just waiting for my cousin to get married then I am going back home to Virginia where the moving process will begin.  Thankfully my husband's job give us $1,000 dollars to take care of our moving expenses.  We already figured out that we can get a U-Haul truck for under 200 so that leaves us with 800 to take care of our security deposits and first months rent!  I'm not looking forward to going into work and telling them I have to give them my two weeks notice.  Hopefully there is an opening at our corporate office so I can just transfer there and not look for another job and lose my insurance that I JUST got in June.  Well I have a dentist appointment this morning with my former employer and then lunch with the girls I used to work with there!  Hope everyone is having a great day!"

"event","I leave tomorrow morning to go to Louisiana for two weeks :).  I am excited to get to see everyone again.  After 6 months of not seeing family and friends I do start to miss them.  Also my husband got offered a relocation to the Roanoke/Salem area, and of course he is going to take it.  He wants to talk about it with me first (which will happen in about an hour) and then he has to call his boss by 2pm tomorrow to tell him his decision.  I am excited because I really need to move some place where there is something to do other than sit around while Carl is out of town, my boredom was really starting to cause problems between Carl and I.  But then again I have to quit the job I just got here that I just got a raise with and insurance.  BUT my company does have their corporate office in Salem so I am going to ask if there are any openings there. They always did say that the HR girl needs help and I have been told that if we ever did move to Roanoke (which I didn't think would happen for another year or so) that corporate would be stupid not to take me.  So let's hope everything goes well.  Oh yeah what is going to make it even worse at my job is that they just promoted me and when I get back I am going through the training for my new position.  I know I will be here in Martinsville until the end of August and the move will probably happen in September.  Ok I need to stop rambling and finish packing.

"event","Well Friday was my birthday, I turned 23 (yeah woo hoo how eventful!) and it started out like most of my birthdays lately. Waking up, alone, saying happy birthday to myself and going to work.  I will say I didn't expect to see my husband for my birthday and I was getting more and more upset about that as the day went on, even though for the past 2 birthdays he as been out of town so I didn't see him.  I guess you could say I was just tired to celebrating without him, and it was even worse this year because I don't have friends with me in Virginia to make up for him not being here.

Ok anways...about 10am I get a dozen roses from him delivered to my office.  I was happy until about lunch time and then I started to become upset and say things to my co-workers like ""I hope he doesn't think flowers will pacify me or make up for the fact that he isn't here.""  And as the day went on it got worse.  He called me from camp (where he is working all summer) and said there was no way he was coming home.  I got made and  hung up on him.  This had surely confirmed that I wasn't going to see him, because he called from camp which is two hours away and it was one hour before I was supposed to leave work.  Oh but wait, my wonderful husband had a little suprise for me.  When I left work two guys who are working for Carl where outside waiting to pick me and bring me to my husband :).  So long story short I had a wonderful birthday, even if I did spend it at work and Boy Scout camp.

Ok that is enough of an update for now.  I need to finish cleaning the apartment and do laundry."

"event","Well my husband left yesterday to spend three months running a summer Boy Scout camp.  It is about two hours away from here so he will be coming home every Wednesday (a new requirement by his boss because he still needs to do things for his district during the summer too) and probably a couple of Saturdays a month.  While I don't like the drive up there (once you get off the interstate it is LITTLE country mountain roads) I will try to go at least once a month on a Saturday.  Of course because he left yesterday it stormed like all hell had broke loose.  At least it only lasted for about 20 minutes.  Thankfully my husband took his friend that has been staying with us for the last week with him.  I thought MAYBE just MAYBE he had matured but I was soooo wrong.  He hasn't matured one bit, he is loud and has no volume control (and we live in a VERY quiet complex, which is the way I like it), and likes to argue just because.  And he is VERY ignorant so his fights are always pointless and end up with me going ""OK WHATEVER! Think what you want even if it is wrong"" and leaving the room because I can't stand ignorance.  I respect everyone's opinion but when you don't respect mine back and try to get me to change my opinion because it isn't your opinion then thats when we have problems.  THANK GOD HE IS GONE! 

In other news when I go back home (Louisiana) for two weeks in July for the weddings I am in we won't have to leave our cats at the vet for boarding.  Which means an extra 150 dollars in our pocket that we can get a rental car with and I won't have the guilt (and lots of crying that goes with that) knowing my cats are stuck in a cage all day for two weeks.  I am lucky enough to work with wonderful caring people and one of them loves cats and is always at our apartment complex feeding her friend's cat when she goes away for the weekend so she volunteered to feed ours while we are gone.  I am going to have to get her something really nice as a thank you for doing this for us.

Well that is about it.  Hope everyone is doing super terrific!"

"event","Once again my husband went out of town this weekend and won't be home for about another 4 hours.  Thankfully this was one of the rare times that we didn't have severe weather that made me freak out and feel like a two year old in a dark room.  I am really starting to hate that he is always gone.  Even during the week he has meetings almost every night.  Then to make it worse he will be gone from the second week of June until the beginning of August.  Which means this will be the THIRD year in a row that he isn't hear to celebrate my birthday.  At least years previously my friends were around to help me celebrate but not this time.  The rate of divorce for his profession is high and I am beginning to understand why.  Not that I am anywhere near wanting a divorce, I am just irritated with his job demands.  It's like his bosses and people that volunteer for him have no respect for the fact that he has a wife at home.  They are CONSTANTLY calling at all hours of the night and day to talk to him.  I made him send out an e-mail to all of his volunteers last week that said ""Now that my office phone has been transfered to my apartment, if any phone calls are received after 9:00pm, on weekends (especially Sundays), or on holidays the phone will be handed to my wife and you can explain to her why you are calling on said time/day.  I guarentee no excuse you give her will be good enough for her to give the phone to me or prevent you from being fussed at.""  Now I don't think my demands are asking too much.  I mean do they not have families ????  Do they also get neglected as much as I do because they absolutely must talk to my husband at 10 at night???  UGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Ok that felt good to get out.  

Hope everyone is having a better day than I am."

"event","I am taking a break from doing my Louisiana taxes.  All those numbers make my head hurt.  And the fact that I know we are going to have to pay them sucks even more.  I already did it on Turbo Tax just to make sure my numbers come out similar to theirs.  Anyways... Not much has been going on around here just work, sleep, and demon cats.  Oh except for today when I went to Wal-Mart.  I now know because of my experience I will never go to Wal-Mart without my husband or go in the middle of the night when no high school kids can attack me.  

So there is the Wal-Mart story:


First of all I hate going to Wal-Mart so I was not in a good mood and I just had got stuck behind some little girl who was paying for her beef jerky stick with pennies!  So yeah I wasn't happy.  I walk outside take off to my car (about a mile out because of all the people) at a near sprint because I am going downhill with a heavy basket and I just want to get the hell out of there.  I hear ""hey!"" so I turn around and this guy is running after me and asking me to hold up and so I ask him for what?  And he proceeds to tell me he has to do something for a communications class to get over his fear of public speaking and raise money to go to Europe at the same time.  Ok yeah whatever.  So he starts asking me questions and just to amuse him I answer.  Of course it comes up that I am married so I think he will get the hint that # 1 I am not available and # 2 I am probably to old for him (even though it is commonplace around here to get married young and I look like I am 16). But yet as he is giving me his whole ""buy a magazine and help me go to Europe"" spill he tries flirting with me.  So of course being the bitch I am I let him talk and then when he is finished filling out a form with fake info that I gave him thinking he is going to sell me a two year subscription to Stuff magazine for 48 dollars.  I stop him and say ""Look maybe yall are really going to Europe and that is great and maybe you are doing a communication class project which is even better but here is my problem.  First of all you tell me you go to a high school in Roanoke which is an hour away and a city I would probably pull out of my ass because it is the only big city near here besides Greensboro.  Second of all 48 dollars for a two year subscription? I can get that cheaper through the magazine company itself. So you aren't giving me a deal.  Thirdly I told you I was married and very happily married and yet you still flirted with me as if I was your high school girlfriend.  I am 22 years old and married so you totally don't have a shot in hell and it didn't help you sell magazines.  And if this is really for a communications class you would have failed.  Because you see you have picked the wrong person to tell that to.  I competed in public speaking at state and national levels in high school and won at all of them. So I suggest you practice a little more, slow down when you talk, speak clearly, maintain eye contact, and flirting wont' sell to a anyone older than you who is married."" And what is his reply? ""So I guess you don't want a magazine"" The only thing I could do is walk away laughing hysterically.  I mean he even tried lines like ""so how do you spell your name is G-O-R-G-E-O-U-S?"" and something about are you greek? and I tuned out the rest. Where do kids get this stuff?  So I really hope they try calling the police department (which is what he thinks my telephone number is) and get them to buy a subscription.

Ok I feel better now.  Stupid little boys!"

But I still didn't get a connection until just now because something happened with our wireless router that was causing it not to send signals right or some shit.  But it is all fixed now and everything is fine in Devon Land."

Thus the reason for this entry (internet being down).  I have always thought our cable company sucked but now they just suck hard and BAD!  So until further notice I will not be updating because I don't have internet at home and I won't be doing this at work again because well I would like to keep my job. We are calling the cable company tonight so hopefully things will get fixed sooner than I hope.  Until then leave lovin and call Adelphia Cable and tell them they suck."

I asked my husband ""Does that really say LA LAF v. Denver?""  ""I think so"" he replied.  So of course I freaked out.  It isn't everyday you get to see your college from back home play on TV up here.  I am usually forced to watch NC State, Duke, Wakeforst, UVA, or VTech.  Not that I don't mind watching those teams, it is just always more enjoyable to see the college you graduated from make it into the NCAA tournament again (I just hope we don't lose in the first round again).

It is a little boring (I am a data entry clerk so all I do is put information into a computer all day), but the people are so incredibley nice and helpful, the pay is good, the benefits are great, and you can really tell the company cares about their employee's well being.  I know I will stick with this one for awhile :).  

Not much going on here, just enjoying being a working woman again and not a housewife.  And I got to go on a shopping spree yesterday for work clothes since the dress there is business causual and I have been wearing scrubs to work for the past 4 years.  So I definitely needed dress pants and shirts since I only had a limited selection of those.  And I got a vanity set that was orginally $215.00 that I got for only 50.00.  I get all excited over big sales.  

I am the clearance queen!"

The pay is higher (and I am up for a raise after 90 days and at the end of the year) than the shit hole I worked at for two weeks and they offer MUCH better benefits.  From what I could tell from the interview I went on last Friday this office is going to be so much better to work at than the last one, and it is not even 5 minutes away from my apartment.  Keep your fingers crossed that this job will be better than the last one, even though I am pretty sure it will be. :)"

"event","so all i wanted to do is chill with friends and have a fun weekend. does that ever fucking happen anymore nope. For some fucking reason where the fuck i go i cause drama. Last night i hurt someone so bad. She is never going to talk to me again and idk how i am going to deal with that. I didn't mean to do it. It just happened. I think i am just going to not use my phone and not go on aim or facebook because they can see whats up there. All i want to do is gett away from here after last night i have no friends now. Everyone hates me. Chris fucking is wicked pissed. Diana i hurt so badly probly. she didn't show it there. I probly made her cry so fucking much when she left I hate knowing that she is crying and i hate myself even more for being the fucking asshole that made her cry. Jess is pissed becasuse i told she didn't even care about me anymore and didn't hug her. Mat fucking seemed like he didn't want me there last night. Walked from Beans house to chris where my car was. No one noticed till i was at my car and gone. Diana doesn't desever this and I don't desever her as a friend. It suck when you care about someone so much and you have no idea why. All i do is hurt her or fuck something up. I can't hang out with my ""friends"" because when they made fun of her in any way shape or form i get so pissed off because i know it hurts her. I am lost an a endless cycle. It feels like i am in that movie groundhog day and every week is replaying over and over again the same shit keeps happening. I keep tell her i care about her becuase i so she probly thinks i don't at all but i do and i think it that i care to much i get pissed off easily about anything. everyone at work lately says that i looked pissed off everyday and that i an asshole. customer just tell me i am stupid and retarted. everyone always puts me down. She is the only one that stands up for me and to me. it seems like this time of year for me sucks worse and worse. ever since 12 12 2003 things just done down hill"

"event","I haven't worte in this thing in like fucking forever and i know no who i talk to will even read this. So..... life just suck an every and any way it could. When ever i try so hard to fix one thing it feels like 2 more break. my ""friends"" I don't know who is and who isn't. Lately it seems as if the people who i fucked up the most are still here for me and everyone i just lost. I drive around alot with no where to go or not knowing where i can even hang out anymore. It feels like only like 4 people care and 3 of them idk even know why they do. I left my house like a week ago i am back now. I am so lucky to have good friends at school if it wasn't for one person i would be failing a class probly because she helped me so much on a final that i was no where in the mind to take or do. I feel so bad asking people for things but idk what to do anymore. i can't concreate on anything at all. i am pissed off all the time. I have so much trouble just trying to listen to people. Without throwikng my stuff out there. I know i am bitching but i just needed to vent somewhere so.... I miss the old days chillen with my friends i didn't have to wonder why they chilled with me. like marco fiddle greg calvin and all them those were the days and i miss chillen with them but i guess we all went our seprate ways. It sucks i just remember the days were i was so happy and chill. now it just seems as if i am just pissed off mad and want to get the furthest away from here. becuase no one would notice and no one would even care. The only thing i have to look forward is to my birhtday becuase it can't be any worse then last year. Trust it couldn't be lol. yea idk just needed somewhere to vent"

I hated it but i proved to so many people with in those 4 years that i would never give up. and now as i finsh watching firday night lights and start to miss football so much. going to the wieght lifting room to get equipment. getting up at 7 a.m. the next morning to the locker room and smelling the awful smell. find my same lock that i had for 3 years. place all my stuff in it. putting on my helmet and it hurting my head. untill the last 20 mins of practice where you know where your going and everyone pushs each other. having the one person you race up and down keep pushing it other. then people polling how many weeks until i died on the hill. which i never did but i think i should have gotten the money. taking my inhealer every 10 mins. kevin going you alright. then going back to the locker room to come back an hour later. also do this all over again. for the next three days. getting hosed down like a bunch of cattle. then doing hitting drills going with smith or crushing alex. lol. you figure u wouldn't miss something u  didn't play in that much, but i have memeories of the few times that i did. or the interception i got before a game that we filmed. (never got that tape) lol. or aponta coming over to e going malave even u can tackle this guys. idk. when i was in there i did things or made the tackle. idk. if coach was afraid of me with my asthma or what. see unlike derek i got respect from everyone becuase when u went against me it was had to do what u wanted. doing the shoots and i would be infront of someone and then trying to get someone else to get in front of them. every friday wearing my jersey to school. friday nights under that lights. you can never get a rush like this and i will never get that again. anyone who on the team knows i tried and i was good not great but good. i wish i went to all the senoir suppers becuase i knew thhey always had fun. but no matt had to work. idk what's with this post. i have been thinking about this for a while. i wish had one more shot at this. being broken mentillal and phyiscaly excuasted. also missing the peep rally right before the high game while the whole school is in the game and we tlak about that we are going to win and the whole school cheers u on the starting line for offense and defense then the rest of the senoirs. well........ yea since i got this off finally i feel alittle less depressed about somethings. oo yea someone i think wants to shoot me so yea........ things just get better."

"event","today was the sickest day in a long time. i woke up at 5 and then sean showed up we got to the train station. thenit took 3 hours on the train to get there which wasn't that bad. sean had to call in bigy was pissed becuase i already had called out (yea me who works everyday called lol) so it must have been wicked busy in there but for once i don't care. today i relized i need to start having some fun in my life instead of working. i have lost touch with alot of people becuase of work and i want to go catch up with alot of u and see how things are but... back to my day. we arrive in ny just me and sean and were like fuck. we had to but to my brother in-law fire house in order to pick up the tickets. good thing that i remember were it was from the last time i went. this is about where i stop listening to sean becuase he seemed to want to go the wrong way. we got the tickets. then we had to get on the right subways inorder to get to the game. (ps ny lotto sucks) i don't know why people have such a hard time getting around the first time they go we figured it out in like 2 sec. it took about 30 mins on the subway which only cost 2 bucks to ride and if u really want u can get rise it all day lol. we get to the gate we have to go in and for some reason our tickets weren't working ooo was i getting pissed. but then they did so we went. our seats weren't that bad were on the upper middle behide first base. we just had alittle trouble seeing complete down the right field line. omg the guys behide us were so cool. even thou sean was wearing his boston hat they were kidding around with us the whole game. i have come to relize it is no the yankee fans that start shit. it is the red sox fans. (even acouple red soxs fan admittied to it)Some dude had a sign that that said juice up giambi and start waving it in a yankees face so of course the yankee grabed the sign tore it up and then the red sox fan tried to punch the yankee fan and missed then i like a flash there were cops. no one was watching the game as all the people were turning around tino jacks a home run to tie it in the 4th. i much as a hate jeter he didn't deserve to get hit in the face. i think payback will happen on monday for that. yes i know the final score was 7-3 or 7-2. but i idc. it was the most amazing thing in the world to go to a yankee red sox game and just watch it in person. if u care to know more call my cell i will tell u about my day it was great. sry to all my friends that i have ingored or not talken to becuase i worked to much.



Hell yea i day no one would ever forget first time in ny with only u and one of your bestfriend. and knowing that u have to be complete responable for your self and cant depened on anyone."

Then today Timmy and Daryl decided to piss me off 4th peroid idk y but they did. Then i am pissed for most of the day. Then i have to do my resume and cover letter done so i can try to get that scholarship. I had to do that over like five times. After that i had pratice with my team i decided that me and sean should do everything they do so that we know how they fell. This depressed me alot becuase then i started to remember all the years i have played basketball and memories. Me Sean Amamda Kp and Amamda L went to pool which i drove up by myself and then some songs started to remind me of football. I really will miss that next year. Anything i did reminded me of soemthing else i am depressed not like anyone cares."

20-29: You are a twentysomething at heart. You feel excited about what's to come... love, work, and new experiences.

30-39: You are a thirtysomething at heart. You've had a taste of success and true love, but you want more!

"event","Well hhmmm my vac was ok. it started when we lost out game on thanksgiving 14-15. Alot of people said the 2 point conversion wasn't made but it doesn't matter now. we finshed 3-8 we were so close in almost every game that we played it could have went either way in all those games. It sucked becuase it never went your way. but it was sad when all of the senoir went into the endzone and broke it down one last time as senoir and last on the field. then friday went to a friends house. choose not to drink with everyone else. or chill with all my coworkers and playing games and getting wasted. then sat went bowling called jenny but she was at the mall so it ended up being me sean katie and ryan playing. we had fun. i was so tired i think i can't remember all that happened. sunday just chilled and worked. now it's back to work work work so... yea having fun."

Like right now I feel this annoying feeling which I cant identify. My life is good but somethings not right. or maybe I am just looking for bad. I dont know. I am having negitive thoughts about my self. and I am realizing why its so hard for me to have a realation ship with some one. and it comes down to I'm scared. cause I am fucked up in the head and have had many bad realationships. there are few people I trust in this world. are the ones I do I cherish and never want to loose. so dont ever leave ok?"

"event","so today I had a great day at school.
Everything just went good. and went by fast.
And then after i just decided to take a walk. 
And I went to the fair ground and found a bench and 
layed down and looked up to the sky. I think
I was listning to taking back sunday. And it was
really nice. Then I wrote some stuff. Tonight
I went to youth group and then blew up stuff
after it. And drove around a little.

this is what I wrote today.
Are you as strange as me?? (not finished)

Do you sometimes think theres a camera
watching you when you go into public bathrooms.

Do you do stuff to embarress yourself to make
some one else laugh.

do you just grab cloths and not care what you 
are grabing and ware it.

After school walk to a randome place where there 
is a big circle and then walk around it?

dosomething great or make something perfect
and tell your self its not good enough.
that your not goodenough?

Put your head up close your eyes and
take a deep breath and just keep walking
hoping you wont run into anything.

find peace with looking with looking
into the clouds.

have an oppurtinuties and not take them.

walk through the rain all alone when its dark
out.  find comfort in it.(its raining right now)

ruin a relationship because you are scared?

go somewhere not knowing where cause
you dont want to be home. Just start 
walking.

thats what I wrote today at my random bench."

"event","Hello...

I am sitting here...  And I dont have a clue what I am going to say.
Things are fucked up in my house right now. Its not a huge house.
And yet I hardly see my brother. He's like a ghost. And I havent talked
to him in two days. Except to say. ""give me my phone"". 
Its strange. I feel strange. Everything is strang.
When I was running down that road at 12 nothing felt
real. It was strange. 

I guess I will just talk about what I did today. I went to my moms friends
house. Teri and Joe. Their really cool people. Joe tought me a song on guitar
a while ago and I played it. Except I found a better way of playing it. 
It was just fun. It was a long drive out there. And my mom stoped at the
one gift store place for like half an hour! or longer. It started to get 
on my nerves. But it was allright I guess. I got to get out of the house with 
my mom. 

I am going to go... maybe go to bed. I dont know.
goodnight world if anyone is out there

"event","I have to say I've never been more ashamed of my co-workers than I am right now.  So we've been staying in India for 5 weeks now.  We're staying at the Park hotel.  While it's a little different than the hotels in the states, they are very accommodating.  The staff waits on us like it's their only concern.  Out of the 7 of us, Jaimee and I are the only ones who have remained in the same rooms since arriving.  The others have bitched and complained about their rooms.  They've been moved around and are never happy.  I believe they even complained to the front desk that the hot water doesn't come out hot at the beginning.  I have to say my hot water gets scolding hot in no time at all.  This morning, Jaime and I went to breakfast and the director of housekeeping and 2 other directors were there giving us their cards apologizing for the rooms, construction, etc.  We explained to them that we've had nothing but a good experience the whole 5 weeks.  They wanted to move our rooms because there might be construction in our wing.  I told them that we aren't really concerned with that because of the hours we work. I told them that we'd rather keep our rooms unless it's unbearable.  We told them that we like our rooms and our views.  I said we honestly didn't have anything to complain about and that I think or co-workers just want something to bitch about.  Now I feel sooo bad because the hotel staff is jumping through hoops when they shouldn't need to.  When we got back to our rooms it was like they cleaned it with a toothbrush.  Our rooms have always been cleaned and our laundry is always promptly returned.  I'm now trying to think of a way we can extend our apologies to the hotel staff (for our co-workers)."

"event","So I've been in <a href=""http://www.rrindia.com/andhrapradesh/visakhapatnam-india.html"">Visakhapatnam, India</a> for about a week now.  I'm working during the night and sleeping during the day so I can sorta keep inline with my east coast schedule.  The driving here is pretty crazy.  It's like going 65 on I-95 during rush hour.  Not only that, they don't stop.  They just beep their horns.  It's neat tho because, for the most part, they get where they need to go with no problem.  There's a bunch of wild dogs and cows that roam the steets.  My car drove past a bus stop and there were 2 people and 3 cows inside.  I have not been daring with food at all.  I call back to the states often.  I was off today so I have to stay awake for 2.5 hours, eat breakfast, sleep, shower and go to work.  All to keep on my normal schedule."

Or if I like what I've begun
But something told me to run
And honey you know me it's all or none

There were sounds in my head
Little voices whispering
That I should go and this should end
Oh and I found myself listening

'Cos I don't know who I am, who I am without you
All I know is that I should
And I don't know if I could stand another hand upon you
All I know is that I should
'Cos she will love you more than I could
She who dares to stand where I stood

See I thought love was black and white
That it was wrong or it was right
But you ain't leaving without a fight
And I think I am just as torn inside

'Cos I don't know who I am, who I am without you
All I know is that I should

'Cos she will love you more than I could
She who dares to stand where I stood

And I won't be far from where you are if ever you should call
You meant more to me than anyone I ever loved at all
But you taught me how to trust myself and so I say to you
This is what I have to do

"event","<B>The trip to the airport:</B>
The limo shows up to pick us up at the wrong entrance (at work), so we walked down to meet him.  Candy and I decide to get in while he's putting our stuff in the trunk.  We notice that the back of the driver's seat is on the floor HAHAHAHA.  I told Candy to let him know before we get started so we don't get blamed for it.  So she tells him and he says ""well it wasn't like that before"" and I said ""Well we haven't gotten in yet so we didn't do it, we're just making you aware.""  He can't put it together so he puts it in the trunk.  On the way to the airport we stop at WAWA (a convenience store for you out-of-towners) for cigarettes.  Candy decided to run in and I stayed in the car.  The limo driver kept talking non stop.

Him: Are you from around here?
Me: Yes
Him: Where abouts?
Me: Middletown
Him: Where in Middletown?
Me:  In the middle of town

and then Candy showed up to save me.  I wasn't trying to be rude but he just had this creepy way about him.  He was all over the road like he was trashed.  

<B>In the airport:</B>
We got through security pretty swiftly.  We saw a bunch of weird people.  There was a family trying to travel but they only had room for a few of them on the plane.  Since we didn't have any meetings until the next morning we volunteered to wait for the next flight.  

<B>On the plane:</B>
There was a girl behind me (and in front of Candy) who was pissed because they made her check her carryon bag.  She was so pissed in fact, that she felt she needed to call 10 of her friends and tell them the exact same story in this bitchy ass whiney voice.  So I get the lovely middle seat in my row.  To the left of me was a lady who had to sit sideways and to the right of me there was this girl sleeping.  The lady to the left sits down and pushes up the arm rest.  I really didn't think it was a big deal until we started flying.  Keep in mind I have space issues as is.  So we start taking off and she ends up sitting on my lap the whole flight.  My legs numb and she's elbowing me in the ribs but I didn't say anything because I didn't want to be rude.  I tried shifting in my seat so she was no longer sitting on my lap, while making sure not to disturb the girl to my right.  Yeah, didn't have anywhere to go HAHAHAHA.  So I figured I'd take my book out and read.  Yeah, that wasn't happening.  I COULDN'T EVEN OPEN THE BOOK ALL THE WAY.  I could open enough to read about 5 words.  That was just frustrating me even more and to top it off she says ""Oh, the Da Vinci code, do you like it?""  and I respond with ""Um, not really""  when I really wanted to say ""I'd like it a lot better if I could fucking read it.""  I put the book away.  Besides all of that it was a decent flight.

<B>In O'Hare:</B>
Baggage claim and all that fun stuff was actually pretty quick.  The dude called us a cab and we were on our way

<B>In the cab:</B>
The driver had some Spanish music playing and all I could make out was ""grandmother"" and ""money"".  I'm not sure if he was selling his grandmother or trying to get someone to sponsor her.  We're on the way to the hotel and he informs us ""it'll cost fare plus 50%"" and I ask ""why the 50% more?"" and he says ""because we're going to the suburbs"".  I knew it was bullshit but I just wanted to get to the hotel.  During the ride he busts ass in the car.  So I turn to Candy and yell ""God damn, was that you?"" hahahaha and she thought I was serious and yells back ""NOOOOOOOOO"".

<B>In the hotel:</B>
The hotel was nice but it reminded me of an old lady's room.  The training was being held in the hotel so all we had to do was walk downstairs in the morning.  We put our bags in our rooms and go down to the bar.  Pat was down there.  Pat likes the females but she's fun as hell.  She's crazy and that makes it fun being on the project.  I was glad I didn't get any stale people on this.

<B>Training:</B>
Training went well.  Except the fact that we found out the training was two weeks long and we were a week behind.  We had people sitting with us who weren't on the project (because their project fell through).  That kind of pissed me off because they were just fucking up our project.  There was this guy from India there and out of nowhere he yells ""IT'S BREAK TIME"" and gets up and walks out.  I laughed so hard.  There was this older man named Merle.  I liked him a lot.  He was a feisty old man.  I got a lot of job offers (for Chicago, Vegas and Jacksonville).  It was just nice going into a big meeting with a bunch of big, important people and impressing them.  Impressing them with my ideas, not my level.  I intimidated them.  I know it sounds weird but it was nice.  I also never knew how many people knew my name (in different sites and in different countries).  I'm considering transferring but I'm also thinking that I think it's cool because it's somewhere different.  I'm worried that I'll make the move and be bored with it in a few months.  There was a girl from the commercial group at the training.  Her name is Kelly.  I talk to Kelly on a daily basis so we were out front smoking and talking.  I look over at Pat and she's like in a trance.  I couldn't help it, I started laughing....so hard in fact, that I had to walk away.  Pat called me a bitch.  Kelly went back to her meeting and I turn to Pat and say ""Hey, want me to get her to go to dinner with us?""  And Pat responds with a friendly ""fuck off"" HAHAHAHAHAHA.  We return to the conference room and finish out the day.  After the daily training there was a cocktail hour.  So we're all out on the patio smoking and drinking and there's Pat....staring at Kelly.  I'm like ""Pat, I don't think she's into girls but I'll get her to come to dinner so you can stare at her more.""  Pat tells me where to go and we all start bagging up.  Kelly came over and started talking, I smirk at Pat and say ""Hey Kel, you should come out with my group for dinner.""  She says ""Dammit Jen, why didn't you ask before, now I'm stuck going out with my group.""  We talk for a bit more and everyone starts heading out for dinner.  I get scolded by Pat for not asking earlier.  I said ""I offered earlier so don't lash out"".  It was all in good fun, she wasn't really mad.   

<B>Uncle Socks:</B>
Candy, Jill, Pat and I were bullshitting in the bar one night after training.  This older guy walks past in short shorts, knee high black socks and sneakers.  At first we all thought he was only wearing a t-shirt (that's how short they were).  I was like ""look at that guy with the daisy dukes on"".  Candy started laughing and I took her camera to take a picture.  I made it look like I was taking a picture of her and Jill but I worked uncle socks into the photo.  He walks out and somehow a few mins later re-appears behind Jill.  I don't know how the fuck he did it because there's only one way in and one way out.  Anyway, he walks up to us and says ""My legs aren't as nice as that girl with the go-go boots."" I respond with ""What?  Look at you sporting those socks..."" and then we just sit there until he leaves.  I look at everyone with a confused look and say ""I think he just called us out"".  Pat just sat there girl watching while we all talked.  HAHAHAHA it was like hanging out with one of my brothers.  She kept getting our attention and nodding in the direction of girl (I assume girls she thought were hot).  Finally after a while I say ""Yes Pat, they are women and if any of us were interested in women I'm sure we'd be more appreciative but, we're not.""  She laughed and told me to fuck off again.  

<B>Muffy:</B>
During one of the meetings I'm staring out the door and see this woman dressed in a big fur coat, a muffler and huge fluffy ear muffs.  Let me point out that it was not that cold out (approx 65).  So I grab Candy's camera and run out in the middle of addressing the group, take a photo and walk back in picking up where I left off.  No one realized what I did besides Candy.  I sit down and she leans over and says ""I don't know how you pull that shit off all the time!!""


<B>Valerieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee:</B>
Val's funny as hell.  If you haven't already, you MUST hang out with her.  I'm commanding you.  Even though we wondered/drove around without destinations there wasn't a dull moment.  I have to mention we had no destinations because the hotel was in the middle of nowhere and someone kept getting lost getting to the hotel.  The first night we went to Bob Chinn's Crab House.  Candy came along because she had nothing else to do.  During dinner Candy got a bunch of stuff on her face and instead of doing the right thing and telling her....I couldn't stop laughing.  Val was no better because she did the same but I can't blame her, I mean she didn't know her.  I was just amazed that she could have all this stuff on her face and not feel it.  We were sooo pathetic that we started texting about it.  It ended up falling off on its own.  Dinner lasted pretty long and Val had to be home soon so we just went back to the hotel and smoked and talked.   

The next night we hung out Val met Pat HAHAHAHA.  I was taking her to the bar so she could see the pic of ""Uncle Socks"".  As we were walking down the hall, Pat was walking the other way.  She like yells ""Hi, I'm Pat"" and puts her hand out to Val.  Val looked scared as hell and was like ""Hi, I'm Val.""  I just laughed.  Pat turns to me and says ""YOU ARE IGNORANT"".  I was like ""what?  I was waiting until you got closer.""  It's not like they were near each other when this all began.  Dan asked if we were related and I said ""nope"".  Then when we were walking in the hall this lady asks ""are you twins?""  I look at her like she's on something and said ""Ummm, yeah NO"".  It was just retarded because we look absolutely nothing alike.  I turn to Val and say ""See that's the 'all white people look alike' comment"".  We drove for approx 2 hrs trying to find somewhere for dinner.  Yeah, not much in North Brook.  There was a Mexican restaurant and I asked Val what the name meant and she said she wasn't sure so I said ""Well if you don't know what it means we aren't eating there"".  So we continue to drive to a restaurant called Tuscany.  As we were walking in I said ""Hmm, I wonder if there's a dress code.  I mean it would suck to go in there and get kicked out because we're in jeans.""  Lucky for us there was no dress code.  I don't know if it's every place in Illinois or just the places we went...but the wait staff hovers.  There's a difference between being attentive and hovering.  I forget what the hell we were laughing at but yeah....  At the end of dinner the waiter asks if we want dessert and we say ""no thanks"".  Val goes to the ""washroom"" and the waiter comes back to the table with dessert menus and says ""you want dessert yes?"" and I say ""No, just a few more drinks.""  So we finished our drinks and a few cigarettes and leave.  I don't know what the hell happened but from the time we got there til the time we left it felt like it dropped 34543534534 degrees.  

<B>Departing:</B>
I really didn't want to leave Chicago.  HAHAHA probably because I don't want to go back to work on Monday.  The flight back was delayed about 30 minutes but it wasn't that bad.  We went to get something to eat and after waiting in line we were making our way to the table and these old people try to take our table.   HAHAHAH Candy yelled at them to go wait in line.  It was pretty funny.  The driver who picked us up was really cool.  


So that's the short (HAHAHAHA seriously) version of my trip......  I think this was the longest entry I've ever written."

PS.  I'm considering the job offers I got while I was out there.  Vegas, Chicago and Jacksonville all sound pretty good right about now.  I guess it's just because it's something different and like anwhere else, it would get old after a while.  Maybe I just need an actual vacation"

I know this is last minute, but I wanted to let you know that we are having a big promotion tonight at Bankshots..it is called the Pimpjuice party.  I know it is a funny name...but it is a new product.

We are having $2.00 Miller Lites too!!!! 

So, if you guys were interested in coming out tonight, stop by!

Beth 

<B>I respond:</B>
What exactly does a ""pimp juice"" party consist of?  Do you have to be a playa to attend?
Jen

<B>She responds:</B>
Yes, you have to be a player! :):)  It is a new product that we are selling..it is an energy drink but you mix it with certain alcohol and it makes some pretty good drinks!  Rumor is..I could be wrong..it is one of the drinks that Nellie sponsors or sells??  I am not sure..but that is what Johnny told me.

Beth


<B>I respond:</B>
Pimp juice - oooohoooooohhoooooooohhh
I think I need to let her loose (might think I need to let her loose)
Let her loose, let her loooooose
She only want me for my pimp juice (that's all she want me for f'real)
Not my pimp juice, I'm talkin her pimp juice
I think I need to cut her loose (it's time for homegirl to recognize)
Yes I do, yes I doooooo-hoooo

Sorry, I can't attend if it's something sponsored by Nelly.  Not only that, there's only one energy drink worthy of being mixed with alcohol.....the never

"event","<img src=""http://images.quizilla.com/K/Koshari/1072668555_tTheLovers.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""The Lovers Card""><br>You are the Lovers card. The Lovers card is about<br>union. Each of us carries in our DNA the<br>ability to be the opposite of what we think we<br>are. Often our romantic attachments grow out of<br>awe and respect as we see in another the<br>characteristics we repress in ourselves.<br>Society often presses us into molds of what it<br>thinks masculinity and femininity should be. As<br>a result, many of us associate with our gender<br>certain positive characteristics and call<br>others negative, when if these same qualities<br>were held by a person of the opposite sex, our<br>attitude towards them would be reversed.<br>Getting in touch with our inner animus and<br>anima, (Jung's terms for our inner male and<br>female), allows us to see the whole of our<br>personalities in a positive and constructive<br>light. When you draw The Lovers card in a<br>reading, you are working with balancing these<br>forces. Depending on where the card is, you<br>have either achieved balance or need to. The<br>Lovers could indicate a romantic or even a<br>platonic relationship. Ask yourself is this is<br>a positive relationship that contributes to<br>your growth as a complete human being, or if it<br>fills an emotional craving within you that is<br>actually detrimental to your personal growth.<br>Image from: The Iranian artist Riza.<br>http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/view1.asp?dep=14&item=50%2E164

My uncle doesnt want to talk to me right now cuz I guess I am rude and disrespectful, my brother hates me, his girlfriend hates me, nothing sister is pissed at me and i dont know. Beau is going to Iraq and who knows what the hell could happen to him, Grey is still in the hospital in a coma and nothing just wants to work. Chris is still getting chemo, who knows if everything is okay with Erin. People wonder though why I want to just be gone or to just runaway get away from here and stuff. I dont mean to complain either cuz i know people have it harder but i just hate this seriously everything i do is either not what they want not good enough or just who cares to them. I am just sick of being treated like im nothing to some people. I am a person who has feelings to and what you say does hurt me. Okay i will be done."

I had Kim come with me and Jessica had her friend Jessica come up so yeah it was kind of fun until the person i brought up kind of stopped talking to me and stuff so yeah that was nice. Janet and the kids came up for most of the day we spent 3 hours in the pool kind of fun but i got burnt cuz yeah i didnt think we would be there that thing and it didnt feel that long so yeah. havent gotten much sleep either but yeah. 

you know i really always wonder why people are my friends. like i always complain about everything and i whine and i just bitch and stuff. i mean honestly i mean i dont have a lot of friends anymore but like the ones i have i really wonder. i drive myself insane i cant imagine what i do to others. i probably like kill them or something. i dunno i guess.

well anyways if anyone reads this i am giving anyone the chance to say anything to me, like if you hate me just tell me and if you dont want to put your name thats fine but i wanna know what people think about me or whatever but if not its fine too just offering."

Do people not realize that what I do or say is because I care beacuse i worry about them because i love them? Someone please help me out... is it wrong that I am trying to care for you?... is it wrong that even if I do/say something and it mean or whatever all because i care?... i dont understand and maybe i never will but i guess i feel like i am the bad person for just trying to care. So dont go telling me that because i ask if something is wrong too many times or say im sorry to many times or worry too many times that im not caring or whatever because then you dont need my careness anymore."

I never use to get along with her the best but now i do and I love it. My mom is the best... she listens to me when i hav problems which is a lot haha anyways she is there when i cry she is just the best.. and some people know how well i get along with her cuz they see it. Now my dad he is a different story. We use to be pretty close or kind of close but I dunno i guess i have an attitude with him but its hard not to because he is one of the guys in the house and the other guy Eric who needs to move out majorly bad because one he is almost 21 two becuase im sick of him and his girlfriend and three he just needs to get out and have a life. I love him deeeeeep down inside but i dunno i guess its just weird. but anyways my dad i guess is my dad and i get along really good with jessica... me and jess are like sister bestfriends.. we talk about like everything... and yeah nicole is like a person i look up to.. i dunno who cares though about that yeah my mom said they people were telling her that they think im depressed and need to get me checked out. haha thats funny i dunno what to think about that though... if so who cares life goes on... yeah well i got burnt too and it hurts like a bitch... oh and yeah beau is leaving on tuesday and i know some people think or might think i dont care about him or whatever but thats so wrong... i care about him a lot.. i mean yeah he wants to do that thats cool.. im here for him all the way but its just scary knowing that he might not come back and he is only 16. and i dont know him the best but from what i know and hear about him he seems to be a great guy. some people may think that he is just a i dont know but he isnt he is a great brother to Chris and is lovely too cuz he LOVES Cloey awww how cute!! haha yeah anyways off of my boring life im gonna go.

But anyways it was Dad, Jessica and Me  and it was actaully pretty fun. There were these three guys that I saw but at first I didnt know if one of them was a girl a boy but we figured out it was guy and me and jess kept walking passed their camper and everytime we did they would get quiet and so would we and then we would all laugh and me and jess were gonna ask them if they wanted to go race like the cars in the game room but we got to scared so we didnt. but they werent that that cute. and trust me i know what cute is haha just kidding. yeah but then i dunno we just had fun up there. me jess and dad were all having fun with this like tree thing trying to balance on it and walk it and it was hard as crap but yeah anyways. now im home and it feels nice kind of but it keeps raining but i like the rain its just fun. and i sat out by fire and all the smoke was coming towards me and i kept like inhaling it so i have been coughing a lot lately and it just sucks. sometimes i feel like i have asthma or something cuz i cant breathe and stuff but i guess that has nothing to do will that yah and i just talk about nothing no wonder why no one ever really reads this cuz its boring as fuck. im happy cuz eric is moving out in august YAY!! that means we all get our own rooms. yeah well i dont want to get on the subject with him though. well im out for now. and im proud to say i am a virgin haha i dont know where that came from.

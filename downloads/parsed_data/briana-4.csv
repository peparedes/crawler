and ive also come to realize how happy i am that i have butla to talk to when EVER i need to. she never fails i swear. half the time i can tell she doesnt wanna hear what i have to say but because she is who she is she listens.

gawwwwwd. maybe my life wont ever be perfect and im ok with that. i can make it through the way it is. i just need to be myself and be who i want to be. i cant let anyone bring me down or make me feel stupid. i am who i am and im perfect. no one can tell me otherwise :)"

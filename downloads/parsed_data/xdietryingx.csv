you are still my brother forever and then some, but it's gonna be hard to look at you the same and think that something like this wouldnt happen again, what's next vegan too?



so with this marks the first kid dropping from 24, i guess its something that is kinda inevitable with a crew gettin bigger, but you always hope your crew never expriences it. especially when its one of the kids who starts it.


for everything you claimed to love, all this meant nothing.. all the times you said you'd never break meant nothing, all the times you laughed with me at the kids who were edge and then talked shit about it meant nothing.

as much as i love you.. you are just the same as the last kid who was all big about it and then dropped.




i love you to death, but forever was a lot shorter than i thought...

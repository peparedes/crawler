"event","So this week I bought and received my ticket to Japan.  It's been a long road to get here though, I've literally put many things on hold in the express interest of putting the money together to do this.  I've tried applying for English schools, none of those have worked out yet, but I think I don't really want to go over to Japan on that sort of ticket... it feels like... okay, I'll say it, the popular, easy route.  I've got work to go to, but I've got a lot more to post on this, I'll come back to it later.

Suffice it to say, I've got a lot of people jealous of me right now.  A lot of them for different reasons than I thought it would be for..."

"event","I've never run my own website... but that's evidently what I need to do.  In order to bring my radio plays for mp3 player concept to life, I need to open a place to organize it.. and one not owned by another group sounds like the best idea.. so there's no intellectual property arguments.  Then there's the matter of the domain name.. the one I want is taken, but I suppose a .org is sufficient.. 

I know I've got a couple people interested in helping out with this thing in various capacities... I guess I need to contact specific people about what they're willing to do.  And maybe reconsider domain names."

"event","I've mentioned already to a lot of people that I've recently been made a supervisor at work.  This is strange work...  I vaguely recall thinking that supervisors don't do a whole lot.  I also remember mocking supervisor motivation things...  Well, there's still funny things like that, but I think the greatest observation so far from this new job has to be about customers.  They seem to think that the solution to all problems is to demand a supervisor... a supervisor whose job it is to facilitate the jobs of their employees...  Pretty far away from the 'wiggle your fingers and make my unreasonable demands come true' that I've heard far too often.

I'll spare the specifics.  But when it comes down to job description, I'm helping agents remember how to do their job, and trying to help them do it better.  Customers demanding supervisors so we can tell them the same thing their tech just told them... *sigh* I think that covers my sentiment there.

By the by, PodPlays is on the move again.  I aim to actually get it moving this time."

"event","A coworker pointed out to me at the end of last week that I'm remarkably well adjusted, for an otaku.  I have to wonder who that's a slight towards, me or otaku.  I mean... I'm inside the otaku community, and self-depreciating jokes about hygiene and social prowess are numerous and.. not without reason, but is that thought common <i>outside</i>, in general society?"

"event","So, I'm in my last week of 'training' at this tech job I'm doing, taking calls and chats.. in exactly the same circumstance as the regular employees, no 'training' involved, no reviews.. pretty much being a regular employee with less pay.  Not too bad, $11.50's still decent.  $13/hr will be better next week.  And the job's not bad at all.  Rather good most of the time.

Anyhow, my trainer came up to me this week and told me 'graduation is on thursday, be here from 6am-2:30pm.'

My current shift is 3pm to 11:30.

There's a half hour commute between here and there

Also, not to be missed is time trying to fall asleep, and then time waking up.

Yeah, so when I get there.. sleep deprived..  I think to myself maybe I should pull a prank on this teacher and act *really* out of it and irritated.  Irritated is easy.. I sound irritated most of the time anyhow.. or so I think.  So, put on a face, twitch and widen the eyes, even remain slightly off balance.  Mission accomplished.. but he takes it way too seriously.. okay.. I just drove half an hour after waking up from about 4 hours or less of sleep to work.  I do not want to be told 'Go home!'  Especially when he's the one who demanded me there at 6am..

It's what he delivered though.. I believe he was honestly worried.. but then, i have him trained to do pretty well exactly what I want him to.  (so very easy to maneuver)

Meh, I guess I'm irritated over being told to sleep deprive myself, drive to work, then get told to 'go home'

I stayed all the same, and I've actually been up since.  Can't afford to be up for too long before my shift starts tomorrow.

Anyhow, this less than coherent post comes courtesy of.. nothing in particular.  I guess I just wanted to rant some

I finished with 2 others as the 'top 3' in my class, so that's an ego point, I received a notebook... with a hardback and print to resemble a notebook computer.  Looks like something that would be handed out at a career fair booth. *smirk*  Maybe I should carry it around and look smug.

Anyhow, there's an update

Nor should <a href=""http://thedarkknight.warnerbros.com/""><i>The Dark Knight</i></a>  a word about Batman... Heath Ledger's Joker is pure genius.  I lament that never will any more be seen of it.

Last week, actually a week ago Thursday, there was a super panic sale of sorts on Newegg, so I picked up a couple Crucial Gizmo Jr drives, 4gb capacity.  These things turned out to be <a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/javalamp/pic/000021bd""><i>slightly</i></a> <a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/manage/pic?id=3"">smaller</a> than I was expecting.  Seriously.. they're like trident gum.. but a bit thinner and wider.

Also old friends have come to town this weekend, dropping in on the way to a reunion.. one with whitewater and skeet shooting...  now why aren't <i>my</i> reunions like that?  Well, there hasn't been one in a while so I suppose I have no room to talk.. and we actually did go whitewater rafting during one too...  okay, maybe I just want to do something outdoors-y.

Had a games night at another friend's last night too, we played Munchkin, Before I Kill You Mr Bond, and The Great Brain Robbery.  Great fun.

"event","Just over 2 months ago, I was ecstatic to get the menial labor job I did then.  Reading water meters for the city at $10/hr, full time about 3 weeks in a month.  Menial labor, sweaty, hungry work fighting the sun all day long while sticking my hands in holes that are full of spiders, centipedes and ants.
  I completed a month and went on 'break'. Late in my off week I get a call from a friend.
<LJ-cut>

  He wants me to quit my job and come work where he's working.  They're desperate for people, pay more, and will pay to certify me in computer repair...  Add to this that they have a location in Tokyo that I potentially could transfer to.

  Hold on a sec.. I need to recover my arms, they've just fell limp behind my chair as I threw my head back to accommodate the gasp of surprise.

  This temporary job I've been working.. this tedious menial labor... The entire point is to save money so I can go to Japan.  Now you're telling me I can go work for this company.. at a $1.50/hr increase during training, a $3/hr increase when I've finished that and... perhaps even have a job waiting for me over there if I play my cards right?
  There are words for what I want to say right now that common, vulgar mouths would spew forth...  

  Let me express right now what happened.

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/javalamp/pic/000012aq/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/javalamp/pic/000012aq/s320x240"" width=""320"" height=""109"" border='0'/></a>

  That's right I took the job.  I grabbed my CompTIA A+ Remote Support Technician's Certification not only with passing marks, I took the highest essentials score in my 'class' and a near top rating on my remote support exam... not that it matters to the exam, they only care that you passed.  

  But surely that must be it, right?

  No.. not really.  Yesterday and today I went on two dates with a someone  a good friend of mine is trying to 'set' me 'up' with.  'Two' should indicate that the first one went well.  I hope it does.  She's fun, intelligent... a <i>published fantasy writer</i> which simply blows my mind... and to top it off.. she's quite the looker.  We'll see if I don't scare her off.

"event","<a href=""http://www.cospa.com/detail/id/0000020795"">This shirt</a> cracked me up today.  It fits the bill so well... $30 and then international shipping makes it less attractive for an immediate buy though.
So my guild has adopted a more rigid raiding setup, I'm glad for them, but it means I'll probably get myself out of raiding for now.  Can't make the posted start times.  
I went and talked with one of my former professors today, it was a relaxed talk mostly to do with work and what I'm doing.  I've got plans... but I can't help but think I'm hedging my bets *too* much and I should just dive headfirst into deep waters.  What I'm talking about here is going straight for full-time salaried employ at a Japanese Company.  Every other plan of mine feels like holdover until I decide what to do.  Some dedicated prayer on the subject should help.  I get the feeling I know the answer already...
Also.. my 'auxiliary plans' are still sitting idle.  I haven't done anything with them.  Seems like all my spare time (and then some) winds up in WoW and a scant few other pursuits.

Cloak - Have materials, need to start piecing it together
Book ideas.... would require a whole post to themselves.. mostly not even started.
Website and associated 'web radio play' creations - I've picked out a splash page prototype I'll adapt mine from.  I need to write scripts, gather a voice pool, do some serious web design (will suck a lot, as I'm no good at that stuff)... 
Boots - Pieces all cut out, have been for years, need to get some shoe goo and get in touch with Ian, set up and knock 'em out.

Sheesh.. and I've probably forgot a bunch

And I still haven't gotten official 'you've graduated' notice.. bleh

"event",".. If I were a swearing man, I'd have been running up a storm a few hours ago.  I went to a friend's place for fun and games on New Years.  That was all fun and good, but a single event 
threw the whole night in a jumble. I will purposefully not be specific, as I do usually.
<lj-cut text=""'Champloo' is a type of dish where lots of different things are thrown in together"">
It was, simply put, and argument.  I'm not wholly blame free, I admit that, I made comments, not directed at anyone in specific, that evidently set someone off.  That someone went for the figurative jugular, diving in with a directed, personal attack on my age and marital status, which is a social... oddity... for this area.  I very nearly flew off the handle.  I was yelling at her trying to get her to stop talking about the subject after not too much time.  It was about that time... that I realized she wasn't stopping and my adrenal levels were soon not going to bear being still any longer.

I walked out.. slamming the door behind me, didn't bother putting shoes on, and walked about 15 meters down the 'balcony walk' in front of this set of apartments.  I stood there, in the cold, not feeling particularly cold... each breath was clearly visible as I stood and twitched for a minute or so.. then started focusing chi in an attempt to disperse the high.  I remember hearing door activity while I was outside, I hadn't paid attention to it.. but I distinctly remember that I wanted to get back inside before someone came out to get me.  So I wasn't outside for very long that I know of.

The whole thing was.. aggravating.

It's not recollection, nor is it new thought entirely.. it's a crystallization of a previous idea.  I can't stand double standards.  'You'd hit a girl?'  'You can't tell a girl that.' these two specific comments were made tonight are within the core of what I now clearly know I hate.  There is a double standard here.  If I can acceptably be angry with and hit a guy for a directed insult, I should also be able to acceptably hit a girl for the same directed insult.  This is equality.  I don't hit anyone these days, but the concept is sound as far as I'm concerned.  Same thing goes for other folk... If you want equality, go for equality.. As far as I'm concerned these types want superiority, not equality.  

Respect requires respectability... I can't respect folk who lash out and hide from responsibility.  
</lj-cut>
*sigh* I'm still coming down off this adrenaline high.  Hopefully I can sleep tonight.

"event","I rolled over a pair of digits today to thunderous silence.  It's odd and anticlimactic, just how smoothly life moves on from one decade/year/month/week/day/hour/minute/second to the next.  And to answer something a friend said, I make little to no fuss about my birthday at least somewhat to see if others will recognize it *without* my pointing it out.  It's petty and selfish, but I do it.  Regardless, 30 years old.. and living in my parents basement... pa-thetic.  *chuckles*  At least graduation and moving out is in sight.  I have plans, and they are far from standing still.

As a final note, I saw some lightning today, it was very nice.  Made me wish it was raining where I was/am still."

"event","I woke up about 5:30am today, after falling asleep at 3:30pm yesterday.  I was awake at this hour two days ago when I stayed up all night for something that had to be done.  All-nighters are getting more and more difficult, at the same time, I find myself wishing I didn't have to sleep most of the rest of the time.  I don't really care for sleep all that much.  I'm an insomniac for one, so I spend an hour trying to fall asleep before actually getting there most nights (some nights are better, others can be far worse).  I don't mind the dreams part.. I get tons of crazy dreams, and some very simple ones mixed in. 
So really, I hate spending an hour trying to fall asleep, and I dislike waking up, and there's a pile of small reasons for both, I think I'll talk about one.
This reason has only been happening for the past couple months, and for some reason it has driven home a really ill-content feeling when I'm trying to sleep.  There should be someone there.  I'll be laying there, and for the barest moments I'm sure there's someone in the bed behind me, and it's a comfortable feeling... but then she's gone, and the hole left behind... it's lonely.  
So this wraps around to common topic I get on... girls and why the freak can't I trust enough to even <b><i>start</b></i> a relationship.  I can admit it, I'm afraid of relationships.  I've been hurt considerably in the past in them and I can't shake two of the last 3.. I know they're not bad people overall, but they were malicious in the breakups.  Yeah.. blah.  well, that's all.
Morning's not bad.. I think I'd rather not miss the evenings for it though."

<lj user=""shadrach_anki""> has posted something I can't say I wish I hadn't said something about.  Perhaps instead of a 'me too' moment I should've taken the opportunity to dig into the satirical look at 'american otaku culture' I've been kicking around in my head for the last year or so.
Am I a fanboy?  With no small trepidation I admit to somewhat being so, and somewhat being not.  Just like I'll admit to being a near shameless elitist.  All the social incompetence and discomfort, yet possessed of social drive, I'll excitedly talk with friends but when they're not there I'll sit quietly and wonder how in the world I can make <i>more</i>.  Feeling resentment and jealousy toward those who can easily talk with new people... seeing girls I wish I could approach and at the same time <i>knowing</i> it would end painfully under any circumstance.  Yet.. I deny fanboy status.  All I derive from 'fanservice' is a need for new, more powerful headache medicines.  Yuri, Yaoi, Hentai, I hate them fiercely.  To those who call them art, I less than respectfully disagree.  
<font color=gray>...And know for something completely different...</font>
Ran the second session of a new campaign of mine.  Using the Arcana Evolved ruleset, and borrowing piecemeal from the 'Diamond Throne' setting it promises to be.. interesting.  I started everyone out with a major dilemma facing their (everyone's) home village.  They must choose one of 3 masters, and successfully call them to their aid to defend against the other 2.  I've been punching the dire nature of the situation in, and I think they've taken to it pretty well, and I'm excited about every upcoming session.
Also went and saw <i>Ratatouille</i> with Nieces, Nephew, Sister and Mother today.  I laughed a considerable amount more than I expected.  Pixar really does impress."

"event","""The first thing I notice waking up, my body is still asleep.  I can't feel anything but 'numb' from all of me.  It feels as if my very form were dissociated from me.  I'm opening and closing my mouth, yawning, my eyes refuse to open.  Just as well, it's still dark out there anyhow.  I bring my arm up to wipe my eyes of tear-duct crust, There's a faint sound of skin and linen rubbing as I move, it's still too distant to be my arm.. isn't it?  I must be pressing hard.. somewhere through the curtain of static I feel the contact of arm rubbing across eyelid.  It still doesn't feel real yet.

"event","So, I did forget to mention yesterday that Dad saw me come home in my goth gear.  Just as I figured he would, he laughed about it.
My latest <a href=""http://sandisk.com/Products/Item(1946)-SDMX4-6144-Sansa_e270_MP3_Player_6GB.aspx"">purchase</a> I have discovered has some potential uses that could make it one of the most nifty gadgets I own.  The clock on it is just gravy.  All i need to do is start recording things... random thoughts, things I hear, it could potentially make this live journal more interesting when I go to Japan.  'This is my class' and such.  The small size = portability which is a direct increase in the likelihood of me carrying it around everywhere.
One of my long standing RPG buddies and I may be starting a one on one thing for all the times we get on and other folks can't make it.  Sengoku era Japan, it's got potential.  
I don't really like planning out events.  Coordinating schedules, divining interest, blah blah blah, it's all so boring.  I don't suppose *anyone* likes doing it.  Something that really annoys me is when someone else comes up with an idea, and then foists the planning off on you.  Yeah...
So anyhow..  what is it with married and engaged couples and the matchmaking thing?  
Non-sequitur aside, General conference sessions today were good, I've instituted a practice of concentrated watching and note taking to maximize my 'take' from it all.  I really can't pay attention to it if I'm trying to do something else at the time.. anything more than making up lunch or something.  Seems to be working.

"event","The only really important thing to say today is 'Goth Night was a blast'  Regrettably, the worst of the knee-jerk reactions we got was a few honks and a call of 'Sinner!' from a passing car.  I have no inclination to believe this person was anything but joking.   Anyhow, pictures were taken, all on film cameras, so they will make distribution when they come around.  
After last night's spat of insomnia and only sleeping from 6:30am abouts to just before 10am, just about 3 and a half hours, I'm feeling spent as I write this.  So I will go sleep on my crunchy hair.

Today I continued translating my latest project, there is a good reason people shouldn't learn japanese from anime and manga, and it is the same reason why people shouldn't learn English from Soap Operas or Gangster flicks.
Today I was also pleased to discover a new (to me) musician.  DJ Bouche.  I always love finding new techno, and trance specifically.  This is bonus in that he's done remixes of Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu tracks.  I'm liking his stuff.
Oh, I've also got <a href=""http://www.jinx.com/scripts/details.asp?productID=788"">Horde</a> and Nirvana patches, as well as a set of Pacman pins all for my bag.  Someone posed to me a question of what I would do if the bag broke.  Well.. it's Timbuk2, i hope it doesn't just break.. I suppose I'd have to snip off all the patches and send it in for replacement... then sew them all back on a new bag.  Well, it's a good idle time project, and so it will be then.
If anyone here knows of some cool patches, point me to them!

"event","So today I looked at a word, and the word isn't important itself, but it had an 'x' instead of a 'z' in it.  So what do I do? I start thinking ""Well, they're not that different, heck, x and z both have about the same total length overall... or do they?  If we're dealing with a square area then the diagonal of the 'x' takes more line than the horizontals of the 'z', but letters aren't square.. they're usually taller than they are wide...""  This quickly turned into a math question.  ""Wait... I don't have to guess at it, I can prove at what ratio of height to width they would be equal.""  This turned into the hypotenuse of a right triangle (one half of a rectangle) and a second equation defining 'c' (the hypotenuse) as '2a' (twice the width), and I'm breaking out the math equation editor in Open Office to write all of it out (also partially because I wanted to learn the program)-

<lj-cut text=""No, the following is not math proofs"">
I did go on to solve it, no the answer wasn't 42. If my kids wind up loving math because I've got a chalk/dry erase board in my home for random math studies... well, that's quite alright. 
 
<b>NEGATIVE CRAP</b>
This morning was also the source of a dire pondering.  There is a lot of meandering in the thoughts I have regarding what I'm about to write so they may waver, change directions or even abort whole-cod along the way.  Somewhere along the way I've become a person who can say things that are very rude.  A Family friend was by, helping with the basement, showing off his new puppy (cute thing).  At night the puppy was lonely in the basement and started barking, this probably continued for 5 or 10 minutes before I went upstairs to use the bathroom, I made a comment that I did not believe was rude, asking if the dog was going to keep barking like that.   I was mistaken on what I could say and who I could say it around, this is what I'm thinking as the rudeness of that phrase has been pushed at me 2 times now.  I've been cold on the phone to people I don't really know, that's come back at me too.  I've become someone who pushes others away.  I think a lot of this is a composite of:
 1. What i mean not being transmitted by what I say and how I say it
 2. I know this happens, so I talk (and want to talk) less
 3...  So I'm rude to people
That actually makes a twisted kind of sense, and like any similar problem it's self feeding, <i>because</i> I feel like no one 'gets' me, a big part of this is my first assumption about anyone lately, that they are actually out to harm me in some way.  Way to go paranoia.  I owe that somewhat to a couple of bad breakups, a generally bad history with 'friendships' that turned sour or just vanished.  Yup.. mode normal is 'that person hates me until proven otherwise'
*sigh*
So.. just like trying to learn how to accept compliments, I've got to learn how not to have trust issues and be less rude.  Wait.. those are connected.  *great* Such is life.

<b>POSITIVE SECTION START</b>
Tonight was Gaming!  <lj user=""shadrach_anki"">, another friend and I continued with our Lawful Good Campaign tonight.  That campaign always makes me feel warm inside.  The ideas are flying, and I really should write more down so I don't lose them before I get somewhere they can be used.
I have a new translation project!  Oh wait... NDA... heh heh.  Well, I can still be happy about work.  Income is nice.
I've been working on an American Heritage independent study class that I should finish fairly soon, hopefully before the summer starts and I'm back in school again.  Oh yeah, that's another piece of news.  I'm going back to school.  I'm accepted back, I just need to take care of paperwork, sign up for classes, and finish school.  Then I can leave!  *excited*  Hopefully go to Japan right then too.
See, here's my solution.  Having goals is nice, but the world doesn't work like 'once I get 'X' I'll be happy'  Oh no, happiness is a direction, not a destination.  I need to capture these good things.  Positivity, that is the anti-'trust issues'... heh heh.. anti-trust.  funny <b>just</b> for being itself.
<b>*RESOLVED*</b> I will end every livejournal entry with things that are positive or that I am grateful for.

He took care of the backstrap steaks and tenderloin, keeping them separate, I helped him with turning it over now and again while I got the rear quarters prepared to haul them out.  We couldn't see a horizon where we were, but the light was quickly fading, I think the sun was setting about then.  We started out with both of us on a rope.  It didn't take long before I was pulling it alone, Dad was handling the dog and the equipment. With the gentle decrease in light, it took me a while before I actually realized we were walking in night conditions.  I looked up several times and marveled at the beautiful skies.  Thanks to it being winter, there was little to no obstruction of the starry sky.  Constellations brightly lit the sky, and with the waning gibbous moon not yet risen, they were our only light.  Astounding it is, how much light the stars cast upon us.  The snow, of course, helps this a lot.  We had decided to try a different route than we had taken to get up, it seemed to be working well, but by now we were both anxious to get back.  The problem was knowing how much further it was..  The Oak may have afforded us a grand view of the sky, but it did not afford us a view of the road.  The answer, it seems, was much more harsh than we had thought.  We were hopelessly lost.  No artificial light, no cellphone signal, no compass, a grim formula.  Unfortunately, we never did make it out, I'm sure they'll find our corpses in the springtime. We should be well preserved at least.</p></div><p align=""right"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;"" />"

That's what I did.  I did some tweaking around here.  The previous color scheme seemed too much of 'teh sads'.  I was trying to put a picture across the top, but it wouldn't take for whatever reason.  The colors I'm using now are all derived from the image I was going to use.  After the effort of shuffling things around and extracting the colors, I didn't want it all to go to waste, so here we are, I made a background to tile all over the background likewise out of the colors in the picture.

Soon enough, before halfway was even here, I was feeling like I'd just had a volatile bad week.  Church helped a lot, a concentrated block of time where I can devote my efforts toward eliminating 'the negative', accentuating 'the positive' and not messing 'with Mr. In Between'.  By the time I headed home I was feeling well again.  We had a nice dinner of chicken in a creamy sauce with mushrooms and walnuts over mashed potatoes, and it was tasty.  About 7, the folks left for a New Years party and I invited the same guy from last night over to play some more RBO and watch some more anime.  More Jigoku Shoujo and Shakugan no Shana were on the docket, and rightly so, they're both very enjoyable.

I can't get over how nice that sounds.  <i>Humanity check, critically failed</i>.<br />This is how I was thinking until about halfway through church.  The 'Maelstrom' as I term it.  It's an unpleasant place to be, the only respite coming in absolute reclusion, and that not truly being 'pleasing' by any definition, but rather 'numbing'.  Bit by bit, nerves start forgetting what 'touch' is, circulation declines, extremities become stiff and cold.  To those sensitive to 'ki' energies, I'm told I look about like a black hole.<br />I couldn't even say why i fight to leave it, numb, to me, is a fairly natural state<br />It's an integral knowledge.  Something within that has tasted of higher states of being.  I could sit here and spit sophistry at you but that wouldn't help anyone.<br />It's easier to just say that I <b>have</b> to fight.  It's nothing so simple <b>or</b> complicated as that, but the statement holds.<br />And I'm not sure how much of all this is a mere hatred of mainstream crap like 'emo' or the so-called 'non-conformitism' But scraping and clawing I will rise.  Hand over hand, small victory at a time towards a type of 'real' manhood I typify by thinking of certain historic individuals.<br />Therefore:</p><div align=""right""> <div align=""right""> <p align=""right"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;""><b>I Resolve</b> to continue the fight I know to be good and right; to never give in and surrender to make things 'easier'; to learn how to hold my head higher, how to be a pillar of strength, mental, emotional, physical, spiritual all, in times of flagging strength.   </p><div align=""right""> </div><div align=""right""> </div><p align=""right"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;"">And this is the fight I will die fighting.</p></div></div></div><div align=""right""><div align=""right""><p align=""right"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;""><br /></p><i>Cum Integritas et Fidelis</i></div></div>"

A very nice charcoal grey suit with pinstripes, excellent quality, about the level of a $600 suit.  And if it fits, I'll be getting it for around $300.  A fine acquisition it looks to be.

The Ryugu Rena figure I ordered back in October being what I *really* want about now... but that can't be helped... sometimes orders just go... slow. *sigh*<div text=""Read on: Errands and Compy repairs"" class=""ljcut""><br />Today was productive. Shortly after I recieved my package I went in town to fix a friend's computer. First I dragged her off to a greek place near a korean market, we ate and bought import bowl ramen. Then I worked on her computer, after a short while digging it out of the storage area. I feel sorry for her.. some of her stuff she had to keep outside she found was in a heavily compromised plastic container, the lid had shattered on one side and snow had melted and fallen inside. A definite misfortune. The joy of the day was to come though. We set up her computer and turned it on, and unlike previous times for her, it came on.&nbsp; I was pleased to discover it wasn't a fried mobo, power supply or other vital component as I had feared when she'd talked about it.&nbsp; Just some pretty bad OS corruption, an incomplete partitioning and a host of other small things.&nbsp; All was fixed easily.&nbsp; I left her with a cleanly installed OS, lots of room to play with and a happy expression on her face.<br />Coming home after dark is especially odd at this time of year in this town. The roads are empty. Virtually devoid of traffic. It's really odd when you're used to too many idiots driving about. It's a pedestrian life. Something small town boys like myself can truly appreciate.</div></div>"

"event","Merry Christmas!<br /><br />Today was a very relaxed day.&nbsp; With myself being the youngest in the house... we all got up around 9-ish.&nbsp; Then it was a round of opening the presents.&nbsp; I'm pleased to report I'm getting myself a new suit.&nbsp; Hopefully I can find a nice double-breasted black suit with pinstripes.&nbsp; A few shirts, some random nonfiction books, a historical DVD, that about covers it.<br /><br />And a 'Yard 'o Beef'&nbsp; the yearly traditional gift from my Mother.&nbsp; *Grin*<br /><br />We finished up today by going to watch <i>The Pursuit of Happyness</i> starring Will Smith and his son.&nbsp; A well presented movie overall.&nbsp; Difficult to watch for hardships involved, but very well presented.&nbsp; Middle to Top of Average.<br /><br />So, seriously, Merry Christmas to all,<br />And to all a good night!"

"event","<div align=""right"">Well hello out there in e-land.&nbsp; <br /><br />Merry Christmas Eve to all as I kick this, my foray into LJ, off.&nbsp; I have no idea if I'm going to even write in this much at all, but in the hopes that I can turn it into something I can keep friends and family updated with, I'm giving this e-journal thing a go.<br />I consider myself a taciturn person, usually not given to monologuing, tirade, or even speaking for much longer than absolutely necessary.&nbsp; But enough introduction.<br /><br /><div text=""Read on:  Groundless Christmas Melancholy"" class=""ljcut"">Today I celebrate a continued lack of enthusiasm toward the Christmas holiday.&nbsp; I just can't help feeling... unexcited.&nbsp; Perhaps yet another outgrowth of general melancholy.&nbsp; Here it is, Christmas Eve, and I just spent 3 hours excitedly chatting about campaigns with a friend of mine, then parted with a 'Merry Christmas' and was on my way.&nbsp; *blinkblink*&nbsp; Business as usual with a specialty phrase tacked on the end.&nbsp; Doesn't sound much different to me.<br /><br />And yet, here I am, still wishing a Merry Christmas with all well-wishing intent.<br /><br />I actually do love Christmas.&nbsp; It's the sights, the smells... the <i>snow</i>... the giving and receiving of gifts, the excited children, Santa Claus on the street corners, Christmas music and caroling, <i>It's A Wonderful Life</i> and it shows, it's good to have a big ol' holiday.&nbsp; Makes winter all the more my favorite season.&nbsp; I'm just... unexcited.&nbsp; *shrug*<br /><br />Merry Christmas Eve.</div><br /></div>"

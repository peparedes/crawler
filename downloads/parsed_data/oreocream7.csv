It has been a bit overwhelming recently but i am starting to re-focus myself and get back on track.  Let's see...we had our annual women's conference a couple weeks ago.  That was FABULOUS!!  For the teen session we did a pajama party theme.  We had all the girls come in their pajamas and we set the room up like a teenage girls bedroom, it was HOTT!!  Oh and I got my nose pierced!!  HECK YES I DID!! and I LOVE IT!!!  I think it looks cute!  After the conference was over my friend Shuie who was in town for it stayed some extra days and I got to spend lots of time with her.  We had tons of fun!  Lots of shopping and eating out!  Ok I really should be studying and working on some papers for school tomorrow.

"event","I saw Napolean Dynamite for the second time last thursday.  Thursday I went to ACA to do praise and worship for the little kiddies, it was so much fun.  I did not realize how much I missed them!  After that I taught a few gym classes then met Poots for lunch.  I have been trying to get together with her since she has been home, and we finally coordinated a time!  It was good to sit down and talk and share and have some laughs.  After lunch she took me over to see the new Apt.  It is so cute!!!  Two bedrooms, nice hard wood floors, a big eat in kitchen, one bathroom and a living room.  It is a good apt for a newly married couple.  I can't believe they will be married in two weeks!!!  that is crazy, but so exciting.  I can't wait for the wedding, there will be a lot of old faces, it will be lots of fun.  I just gotta figure out what in the world I am going to wear to the wedding!  Decisions decisions!  The weekend was pretty low key for me...went to Jaime's new apt friday night with some ppls and worked saturday morning and slept the rest of the afternoon.  Today was low key, went to 2nd service and headed to the kirk's for lunch then headed home to watch the game.  Spent the afternoon with the family watching the game!  I asked the question in a previous entry why can't you make yourself fall in love with someone?  You would think maybe spending lots of time with them an attraction will grow out of it, NOT so much.  If it's not there it's not there!  and that my friend sucks!  Then you find out...ur feelings are actually going in the direction of another...someone you know is not interested AT ALL!  That sucks even more!  Who enjoys liking someone that has no interest in you...NOT ME!  But you can't help who you like I guess.  Wish you could...and then I wish you could like put a spell on them and they would like you back.  So....what do you do in a situation like that...continue liking the person and attempt to make it evident to him to see what he says?  or...let it be and let it go?  choices choices!  I don't know....ok well I am off to bed...early morning tomorrow!  Sleep well all!  much love!"

"event","Hey everyone!  I know it has been a while since I last updated.  Nothing really exciting has gone on, just working and church.  That is my life right about now.  I am trying to make some decisions too.  I am in a bit of a hole right now, but nothing I cant work out of.  I had a really great and well needed phone conversation last night.  I talked to a certain someone about our relationship or I guess I should say my feelings in regards to our relationship.  I just had a lot of fears and questions about some things.  I had them for a while and they would re-surface every so often, so I felt the need to kind of deal with them.  The door was open to talk about it, so...we did!  And it felt GREAT!  They really put me at ease and at peace with things.  I will admit I was very scared...I can be a tough cookie to crack sometimes, but when you do...you hold a piece of my heart and a piece of me.  I don't give myself away that easily.  It takes a lot of work earning my trust.  When I get wounds from whatever or whoever, its kind of like I build up a wall around the wounds and in essence block that person out from the inner paige!  So that's what I did, but I am ready to take down the walls, but was scared...very scared, bc pain is not something I like.  Well, noone likes pain really, but me especially..I close down.  Anways it was just comforting to know that they are just patiently waiting for whenever I want to open the door to my heart again to them...no rush, and they understand if it may take some work on their part and some time.  It may take a bit more time and work on their part, i just need to know they are gonna not just be there FOR me...but be there WITH me.  If that makes sense.  Any hoo!...it was a great convo and I went to bed at peace.  I did however realize or feel like I have been neglecting some other relationships in my life...i'm sorry!  It has not been my intent at all.  I am gonna try real hard working on that!  I promise!  I worked this morning at 5am...you read it right..FIVE AM!!!!  It's hard getting up that early, BUT I like it bc I was done with work at 12:45pm.  I had the rest of the day to do WHATEVER!  I do like my job a lot...I have a good time!  May as well...I am there 40 hrs a week!  PLUS there is talk about promotion coming my way, which would be GREAT!  The next step up is Shift Supervisor and I would get like $10/hour.  Set it off on the right and on the left!  So just pray for that to go through with the quickness!  Well I am like super beat..I am gonna go hit the pillow.  check you all out on the flip side of things!  Love you all!"

"event","I sure don't!  I have seriously been slacking in the sleep dept lately.  Thursday night I went up to see my most favorite person here on earth.  I chilled with her and sean for the evening ended up leaving about 1 am...drove home.  For those that are like what's the big deal...well they live in windham, NH and I live in Hingham, MA.  Huh?..ok that is about and hour and a half away from me.  So i drove home, struggled the whole way, made it home safely.  I heard Mama H was not so thrilled with me doing that...sorry!  Then I worked friday till 8 then headed up to peabody to chill with the peeps at ryans house.  Grabbed renee and karen on the way through beantown and we stayed there until about 1 ish I think.  They kicked me out bc I stupidly informed them of how I had to work at 6:30am.  So I eventually got home and slept probably about 2 hrs total.  Saturday I went to bed at a reasonable time but did not fall asleep until about 12:30.  Sunday I went back up north to NH and hung out with the coolest crew again and again drove home about 2am and got up to be at work by 7:30am.  It's all gravy though.  I would much rather spend time with friends than sleep.  I will get PLENTY of sleep when I am dead.  Ok that was totally boring..sorry to have bored you all with that crap!  ON a up and up note...I saw one of the funniest movies yesterday.  Napolean Dynamite!  It is hilarious!  I thought it was gonna be stupid..it is...and have no point...it doesnt!  But it has some of the best one-liners ever!  So if you are the kind of person that enjoys one-liners like me and most of my closest friends do...GO SEE IT!  Ok well this was a pretty useless entry but..OH WELL! I am gonna go though and do some studying.  I will chit chat with you all later about more serious things...I promise!

"event","Ok first of all I would like to yell at ALL of you...I have been gone for EIGHT days...YES EIGHT!  I come on LJ expecting to be updated a bit on the lives of my homies...and sadly see that only ONE, YES ONE! person has updated and that was thursday!  What is going on here!?  I am deeply offended!  You all are fired!.......and now re-hired, bc I have to share my last 8 days with you.  I am not going to go into GREAT detail bc that would be TOO long of an entry so this will be the abridged version of The Guat!!  The past eight days have been..to say the least, life changing...but in a practical way.  The country of Guatemala is beautiful!  The land is covered with mountains and hills and volcanoes..its breath-taking really!  The way of life is of course a lot different than what us Americans are spoiledly used to, but...they are a happy people.  Their hearts are so open to anyone and anything.  They are beautiful people too...the children are so welcoming and sweet and so adorable.  Once you get past the obvious poverty of those that reside in the country and really look at the people for who they are...a creation of God..then you begin to really relate with them.  They are people just like us...with problems, just like us...and families, just like us...and a feeling of incompleteness, just like us.  They are people in need of what EVERY HUMAN is in need of.....hope, love, faith.....God...a relationship they can depend on.  I saw it all really...from schools with kids who dressed as if they went to St. Mary's with uniforms and all...and then right down the street a little 4 year old girl carrying a shovel twice her size filling in pot holes on the street, trying to help her family get money to put food on their table.  I learned a lot on this trip.  I feel like I knew how Jesus felt when He would look out at the multitudes and be moved with compassion for them.  I knew what it felt like to see a mother sitting there with her probably few day old pre-mature baby while a 16 year old gringo prayed for her child.  I saw the desperation, pain and gratefulness in her soiled eyes.  I was at that moment like Christ, moved with compassion, so moved I could not contain it, so moved that it hurt my heart.  All you could do was cry...and pray...and cry some more.  Seeing sick old women just overwhelmed with thanks that they would just weep, see mothers over come with peace that their children would be ok.  I saw children over come with joy that us gringos cared so much about them that we came all the way from Los Estados Unidos, just simply to make them laugh and share with them someone who loves them so much.  Trust me it was not all heart moving and sweet and joyous.  There were times I wanted to just scream and get on the bus and go back to the hotel, or cop an attitude, but we all continued to encourage eachother by lifting up four fingers to remind us of 4 words...'Keep A Good Attitude'.  There were days you wanted to remove a finger and tell someone to read between the lines...but that is when self control comes into account.  ALL in ALL, it was an awesome trip, and though there are jokes and stories and not so much great times, I would go and do it again in a heartbeat!  Ok...I do need to get some sleep.  Until tomorrow!  Love you all!!"

John Mayer....was AWESOME!  I would totally go see him again.  I was a bit disappointed I must say bc he did not sing my absolute favorite song, 'My Stupid Mouth'.  That is ok though it was still as great concert.  He is just as good live as he is on his cd's.  His voice......ooooo.....it's so nice!  Ok I gotta go ger ready for work.  Ciao!!!  Love you all!"

"event","I know it has been a while since an update, but I have legitimate reason this time.  I have been at camp Wildfire all week.  That is a children's camp put on by IFC.  It was awesome, my body is in so much pain right now.  It hurts in places I never knew muscles existed, but it was WELL worth it all the pain.  We got up there monday and I then realized I had THE best cabin full of girls!  We did not get a whole lot of points over the week, but that does not matter, we all had fun and were able to grow close together.  This year my cabin or 'crew' was more like a family.  We all meshed real well together which was a lot better than last year when my cabin had cliche's and what not.  We had a lot of fun this year, I made the decision to just have a good time.  I love hanging out with kids bc you can act like the biggest fool and do crazy dumb things and they just think you are the coolest thing in the world.  Monday night at service I lost my voice which was GREAT!  especially when I was planning to sing praise and worship the remainder of the week.  So Paige drank nothing but hot tea and water the whole week.  It was ok though bc the rest of the p&w team lost their voices byt like wed night.  SO I did not feel too AKWARD!!  The services at camp were AWESOME...I absolutely love John Tasch (the speaker) and his object lessons.  They are awesome, he is so good with children and keeping their attention during service.  He explains such complex things in such a simplistic way.  I think I got as much out of the week as the kids did.  It was a great balanced week...between rolling down the HUGE hill and belly flopping in a big mud hole and phenomenal times of worship and having God's presence be so tangible in the place and great devotional times, it was a great week!  I almost bailed out of going to camp...well I shouldn't say that, but I wanted to.  I got home sunday night before and had a not so great convo with the rents. It was a hard conversation, involved a lot of tears.  Like you ever cry so much that your eyes are irritated for hours after?  Well I woke up the next morning and my eyes were STILL hurting.  It's been difficult knowing what I want to do but not feeling like there is a support system at home for me.  I was open with my parents and they were open with me...it was more like them yelling at me, but I am used to that.  Just came to the realization there is just A LOT of unforgiveness...unforgiveness from me to them and from them to IFC.  They are not going to be able to move on or really understand or support what I want to do and what I do now, until they get over that and forgive and forget.  I also realized that I just have a lot of unforgiveness in regards to them and the fact that I don't feel like I get the support I desire or require.  It was good though at camp...thursday night Pastor Tasch at one point talked about forgiving and that came to my mind and I just asked God to release me of that and I took a DEEP breathe and it felt like a weight was lifted.  Now I know I am not entirely redeemed of it, but it's still a big step and I am getting there.  I need to get to bed I think...I got a long day tomorrow..church then a John Mayer and Maroon 5 concert for Erin's bday.  I actually just called her, wanted to be the FIRST person to wish her a happy bday (shut up jen!).  Ok goodnight all.  I will be sure to update before I leave for Guatemala on saturday!  love you all!!"

"event","How do you honor, truly honor a man who has impacted the lives of so many people?  How do you show your true appreciation for the anointing on his life and the calling he has so willingly taken?  You dedicate an entire sunday morning service to celebrate him, that's what you do!  You get him 50 thoughtful gifts to celebrate 50 remarkable years of life and another 50 more to go!  Yesterday was Pastor's b-day and we had a church-wide party for him today.  It was great to hear the associate pastor's and partners go up and speak great words about Pastor and how his minstry has impacted them.  One thing I think was missing was a young adults perspective....I would have loved to go up there and share a lil bit of my love and apreciation for a man who has constantly stood in my corner cheering me on, even when I wanted to leave my own side of the ring.  It was said many times today by many ppl how the appreciate Pastor's ability to encourage.  I always knew he had that gift or anointing on my him for that, but it as they spoke it became more evident to me.  He truly is an encourager, and to me that is important....bc I dont have too many ppl in my corner (or at least it feels like that sometimes), but I always know i can turn around and find a handful of ppl there with signs and noisey things cheering me on and Pastor is one of them.  He always has been!  To me that is VERY comforting to know.  So church, as you can tell, was great.  After church and a horn honking match with Pastor as he left the parking lot I went over the azers to celebrate Bekah's bday...good times!!  Headed home around 6pm to finish packing for camp which will be from tomorrow until friday.  Before finish packing I had a WONDERFUL talk with my parents (that was sarcasm).  My eyes are burning right now from crying so much...like you ever cry so much that literally it is straining just to keep your eyes open and your pupils are like throbing and your head is pounding.  It started off as a talk about school then it turned into a whole like ""what are you doing wiht your life paige!!!?...."" but you know i am not gonna get into right now bc I am tryign to prepare for camp and I refuse to let that conversation ruin my week.  So I choose to not dwell on it another minute.  Ok I am off to bed...you won't hear from me for at least a week, so dont worry!  be praying for me and the kids!  Ok love you all, talk to you when I return!  ciao!!!"

"event","Why?...i have no idea, but its more feelings than I know what to do with.  You ever feel so emotional its overwhelming?  Like heavy?  I got up today about 11am, I had a late night, and was having my devotional.  I read my proverb and read a chapter of John's gospel then read ""The Purpose Driven Life"", yea I am reading it again.  I liked it that much and wanted to see what more I could get out of it.  I got about halfway through the day and lost it....tears just started flowing from my eyes.  The chapter talked about how you feel  distant from God sometimes, but to remain steadfast and know even though it may SEEM like he is far away...He really isnt.  I have been feeling that way for a bit now...I just have all these questions in my head and am so afraid I have chosen the wrong path.  Why does life have to be so hard sometimes?  why do friends change?  why can't you make your heart love someone?  why can't you make someone else's heart love you?  Why do I do the things that I do?......Anybody know the answers to any of those questions?  hehehe...I gotta find a way to release some of this...any suggestions?  I am pretty open.  OK I need to go to bed.  Ciao Bella!"

"event","I should really be in bed now, catching some zzz's, since I have been missing them for the past like week.  It has been late nights with early mornings.  I had a good weekend though.  Friday night I went to another youth group.  One of the gents I work with (i think I mentioned this before) is a youth pastor at an Assemblies of God church in Hull. They have services every wed night and he invited last friday but I had Give It Up! so he invited me again this week.  I decided to get out of my comfort zone (which was HARD)and do it!  It was a lot of fun!  The leaders were very nice, especially the female one's.  They are all in their early 20's. The group of kids are really young the oldest is 14.  So they are a bit immature, but GREAT kids!  I might go back and I am gonna pray about helping him out.  I kind of feel for him bc come like september he is going to loose like 3-4 workers...YIKES!  So I am gonna probably help him out as long as it does not interfere with Legacy bc we all know THAT is my priority.  I gotta just pray though and make sure my motives for helping are pure.  Ok I need to go to bed.  Got a long day tom...taking ma dukes to the grocery store then hopefully hop by MCC and get some loan stuff then possibly head to ACA to help them with a computer issue then head into town to chill with erin.

"event","Hey kids!  I know its been  while and al ot has actually gone on.  Not necessarily big things, but things.  WOrk has been great, I really do like it, for now.  Its not my DREAM job, but for a season it will pay some bills and will benefit me later in life I know!  Things are going really well as far as 'relationships' go.  I am growing closer to ppl.  I am just trying to make an effort to not have so many shallow friendships.  Just as simple as when I say hi to them and ask them how they are doing, just really meaning it.  Ppl use that phrase as such a 'courtesy' to ppl and that bothers the crap out of me.  Its not meant for simply courtesy purposes, when you ask it....mean it, wanting an honest answer back (whatever that may be).  So I have been attempting to work on that and just trying to not be so 'Paige' minded.  So that is going pretty well, drawing closer to certain ppl.  I have to give myself kudos bc I was confronted with a situation with certain gentleman....and it could have gone a certain way but I managed to remove myself from the situation and really seek and ask God to guide, direct and reveal stuff.  Came to the conclusion, being single is what I will be for some time now.  I have not found that man yet...but maybe I have!  Either way, now is not the time and I am at peace with that.  I must say though it made me feel special to be chased a lil bit.  I have never had the pleasure of being chased by a guy and when I first found out, I was caught off guard and the first thing that came to my mind was....'what the fa...me?  why me?'  But hey, why not me! I'm Paige and IM AWESOME!!! NOt to puff myself up, but I was proud of myself that I was able to step back and asess the situation and handle it, going with what's right not what my emotions were telling me.  Yeah so that's that my friend!  One week till came and like 3 weeks till Guatemala.  I am getting more excited about Guat.  Lots to do though, so that is not too comforting.  Oh yeah guess what?  I preached wed night at Legacy....can you say NERVOUS wreck.  It was ok, everyone said they liked it.  It was good to have a bunch of my peeps there supporting me.  Really you all you have no idea how much that meant to me for you to be there!  I appreciate you all and love you all SO MUCH!!  It's getting late, I need to get to bed. I just wanted to say hi to let you all know I am still alive and well!  I got lost more to update on so I will do it maybe tomorrow after work!  Ciao!!!"

"event","Hola!  Yeah I am trying to brush up on the spanish before the trip.  That's about as far as I have gotten..so i guess no translating for me!  Ok so yesterday I had my second day at the bux.  It was SO much fun.  They had to like kick me out, I didnt want to leave.  The time goes by super fast bc you are constantly going back and forth and there is always SOMETHING to do.  The drip coffees and teas were my domain yesterday.  I had full reign over them, and was pretty DARN good too!  I eventually progressed and learned to make frappucino's, so if any of you want one...I am a...well, SEMI-pro at making them.  OOOO but a drink you all gotta try, if you like fruity stuff...it's called a blended lemonade-strawberry.  I am not a HUGE fan of lemonade bc I don't like sour stuff, but bc the strawberry is in it, it balances out quite nicely and tastes SO SO SO good!  So I met some of my co-workers.  The ppl I worked with yesterday seem really nice.  Two of them are young, probably about 20, one of which whose father is the pastor of the baptist church in Hingham.  Another girl I did not get to talk to really, she is quiet, but she said she loved my laugh.  The like assistant manager is super sweet.  She is short and like talks a mile a minute, they call her J-Lo.  Reason being is her name is jen and the managers name is jen and bc she is short..'LO' to the ground they call her j-lo.  Corny!  Lastly the guy I worked with, his name is Owen...guess what?..he is a youth pastor at an assemblies of God church in Hull.  How cool is that!  We did not have the opportunity to really talk bc it's hard doing that there, running back and forth.  So hopefully we will have the opportunity to.  He is a student at ENC and almost done with his religion major and next he wants to do psychology bc he has run into so many 'family' issues dealing with his group of youth.  Anyways, I was intrigued by him and the fact that we are working together I personally do not think is just some kind of coincidence.  Right..so I am done talking about that.  Well I think my work here is done!  Hope everyone is having a blessed day.  What's plans for this weekend?  call a nigga!"

"event","Hey folks!  So today was my first day at the Bux.  It was...so....incredibly....BORING!!!  I was reading from 10 am until about 3 pm.  I think I dozed a couple of times though.  It was the normal don't do this...do this...these are your benefits...this is what you can't have..don't you wish you had this...wear this to work..don't wear this...ha ha ha!  No it was good though.  It was a lot of reading and my eyes were hurting afterwards, but it was still fun.  Got free coffee...met what seem to be cool people.  Manager told me not so much a comforting thing, some ppl there are just drama freaks...so that will be interesting.  I left parade to get out of the drama now I just get drama on a caffeine high.  I am excited though, it will be good times.  It seems like it is going to be a lot more involved than I anticipated, but involved is good!  Ok I just wanted to update you all on my first day!  Have a blessed night!  Love you all!"

"event","I was watching Dr. Creflo Dollar the other day and he said something that was like BAM in my heart.  He said ""My hurts and pains should not be important to me, but should be important to you.  Your hurts and pains should not be important to you, but should be important to me.""  That just really grabbed me and it is something I plan on implementing in my relationships.  We get so concerned and caught up in our own little worlds and agendas and miss the real point of life.  It's not about what you can take from other people, it's about what you can impart into this world and into people.  I am so talkign about myself here.  I know I have been so ridiculously selfish, especially recently and I apologize to all of my friends!  It's not my intent to put the attention on myself, or at least it should not be.  So, if you ever see me getting like that again...please please please someone say something to me.  Even if you think I am gonna throw a fit, I would rather you put me in check and me be like upset with you for like 2 hours than me going on actin like a jerk.  You know what I mean!? So im sorry for being selfish, and I am going to make a concious effort to take the attention off of myself and put it on others."

"event","Sup kiddies?  Hope you all had a good weekend.  Mine was really good actually.  Here is a quick rundown (sorry maggster I knwo you dont like these types of updates)  Friday I slept in then headed to the gym.  Dude, I ran 2 miles STRAIGHT!  without stopping at all, I was so proud of myself.  My legs were burning afterwards, but it sure felt good!  Friday night I headed up north to hang out with erica and lori and alex.  I picked up Jamie and Emmanuel on the way in.  Had to get Emmanuel bc there was NO WAY I was about to be a fifth wheel.  We had fun, we went to Richardson's and played mini golf.  Yeah guess who won?  The Honduran (Alex) who had NEVER played mini gold before in his LIFE!  what is up with that?  Either way it was fun, after that we went to friendly's to grab a bite to eat and then Emmanuel and I headed into boston.  I dropped him home then I headed over to renee's to crash for the night.  We went to bed finally about 2-ish, then she came in jumping on me at about 7am. Yeah, not too happy about having to be up by 8am to move her accross town, BUT that is the sacrifice you do for friends!  We got it done in like 3 hours.  Mrs. Laing, kirky, this guy named jezza (?), and emmanuel helped.  It was all good.  We then left renee alone to deal with organizing her new hole in the wall for a room (im sorry but it is small you have to admit).  Me, Emmanuel and Kirky headed up north to his place for chill time.  Took some showers and just relaxed.  We took Emmanuel over to K&G and he got some nice shoes and a HOTT outfit.  We then headed into boston to grab renee and headed up north (again) to a beach in the beverly area.  It was so much fun at the beach, aside from the sand fleas.  Emmanuel did some showing off for us (ha ha ha) and I had to take him down for the count (wimp, but don't tell him that).   We had some good talks and shared some good stuff together, and lots of laughs.  It was really good though, it was a start to developing some new healthy friendships and opening up for me.  Good times! Finally got home and in bed at 2 am.  Got up about 6:30 to get ready for church.  Picked up the crew on my way through town, got the libster.  Headed to church, was a bit late for my Guatemala meeting.  I will say though it REALLY hit me today in the meeting that I am going.  It was great!  I am getting more and more excited about it.  God's got something big for me.  Shuie thinks maybe it is a guy and that I will just end up staying there after the trip.  NOT SO MUCH!  But hey...who knows!  Ok well today was a low key chill day.  Went to church like I said, then some of us headed to chili's for lunch and then the mall.  After the mall i headed home and dropped the peeps off in town.  I talked to my chica shu-banga for a bit and now I am just chillin.  I think laundry is on the agenda for tonight.  Ok ppl I shall catch you on the flip side.  Ciao!  Love you all!"

Well this update is going to be a lot better than my last update.  I was just a tad tiny lil bit upset at someone so I needed to just vent!  So you all got the brunt of it!  hee hee!  Ok Ok good news!  I am no longer unemployed!  WOO HOO!  Can you say STARBUCKS ON PAIGE!  Yes I got the job.  Well actually I got both of the jobs, but I took the one closer to my house.  I went in for the interview and she was like 'did the manager at weymouth offer you the job?..bc if she did I am not gonna even ask you any questions, no point'  So needless to say I start Monday!  Set it off! ...you know it...on the left and on the right!  I got mixed feelings about it though.  I am excited, but you know how like you are called to something and you know it, but just the season is not right yet.  So anything you do just really does not feel right.  Yeah that is how I feel.  I was textin with renee and she was just saying how like its just preparation time, which I know, but sometimes preparation time SUCKS!  You lose friends..get new ones (sometimes)..take steps of faith, go out into the unknown.  It's scary and hard and lots of tears are shed.  But like I had said in a previous entry, those trials and stuff happen so that we may grow as ppl of godly character.  That's how you should at least look at it, bc if you don't then it just really sucks and nothing seems to make any sense.  Ok I am all sweaty and nasty so I am gonna go take a shower and relax.  I will chit chat with you all on the flip side!  Ciao!"

"event","ok the subject of my entry pretty much describes how I am feeling right now.  Usually i hide this type of emotion, bc I try not to be irrational with things.  Right now though..I have to say I am furious...so so so madd!  At the same time...so so so DONE!  It's over, and I am cool with that.  Hurts like a MOTHA, but...this is the last time, I can't keep doing this.  It's not healthy AT ALL!  I am throwing in the towel.  You know what, I am gonna stop now before I really say somethign that I will regret later.  I am not trying to piss anyone off...especially not myself (any more than I already am).  On a happier note...I had a GREAT interview at starbucks today.  It went really well and I pretty much have the job, she just needs to call my references.  I also have another interview at ANOTHER starbucks on thursday.  Its just a matter of which one 'feels' better to me.  So Just pray it all works out well, so far so good!  Ok I am outa here.  I will write more and have a better update once I have cooled off a bit.  Maybe tomorrow!  ciao!"

"event","Hey all!  What's crackin!?  Well the cliffs last night was actually fun.  It was only four of us but it was a great way to end a fourth of july weekend.  We got there about 2 am and tried to stay warm under the blankets.  Good thing I brought those!  It was good though, we had to use a lil body heat at one point, it was getting cold!  Unfortunately the sunrise was not as 'off the hook' as we thought it would be.  It was madd cloudy and muggy so we could not see it that well.  It was ok though we stayed till about 6ish then headed back, stopped off at a local place for breakfast.  Then we headed to Kirk's house for some crash time.  Took a short nap then headed home.  Today has been a low key day, I have just been takin naps here and there.  Good news!  Starbucks called today and wants me to come in tomorrow for an interview!  Set it off!  So just be praying for me tomorrow around 3 pm.  No worries here!  I walk in that FOG baby!  Blessed going in and blessed coming out!  Ok I think I am gonna head to bed.  Maybe I will come back and chit chat with you all later!  Ciao!"

"event","Happy 4th!  Hope you all had a blessed day!  I had a really good day.  Well it was good and bad at points but balancing out to be good, I guess.  I have been trying to keep my mind off of somethings so I can focus on spending time with my friends and not acting anti social.  This morning went to church then after church went to Eeks to change and then headed over to the DT's.  I had A LOT of fun hanging out wiht them.  It was good times.  I will add I was THE only single person there, but they didn't make me feel left out at all.  I had a lot of fun chilling with them, them being lori, alex, eeks, jamie, nicole, stephen, mo, amy, mo, david, kelly, jay, dana, and another couple...then of course the adults vodt, pastor D, mrs. D, grammy and papa D.  It was a lot of food and we had fun by the pool.  It was cool because I was able to get my mind off other stuff I (sort of) dealt with earlier in the afternoon.  I still feel like it is unresolved, but I guess all was said that maybe needed to be said, I don't know.  I then got a call from Shan that she was at Rachel's so I hoped in Stitch and headed over that way.  I came, I saw, I conquered!  lol...we had fun played some bball.  Met shan's new 'friend', He seems nice, a cutie.  They eventually left and the rest of us (nai nai, rach, emmanuel, renee, jspa, philip, libster) all chilled at the house and played some music, danced and just chilled.  Now we will be heading up to the cliffs for a LOONG night.  I will be honest I am not feeling it right now, BUT I will make the best of it!  I am sure it will be good times.  I kind of wish MORE ppl were coming, but its gravy.  Ok so I guess I should get going now.  The cliffs may be therapeutic for me, it's been an emotional week really, but especially today.  The day is almost over though, Thank God!  Ok ciao ppl! I love you!  don't drink and drive!"

"event","So I actually have time right now, so figured I may as well update.  Today was a pretty good day, I went with Kirky to the cape and hung out with the lil italians.  That would consist of VODT's like entire family.  It is always good times though.  Us young adults got togther and ""Held some Texas"" (poker) It was fun and I WON!  It must be in the blood or something.  I actually was able to spend time with lori, alex and dana which was fun.  I decided I am going to make it a point to start hanging out with them.  They are great ppl and focused and I want a bit of that to rub off on me.  It will be uncomfortable hanging out with the couples but, HEY maybe that will rub off on me too! :)  My week went pretty good, like I said before I hung out with jspa wed and we headed to church together.  Honestly was not looking forward to going to church, hadnt been like that in a LONG time.  Let's just say tuesday and wed were not THE best of days for paigey!  But I honestly think I am handling it well.  Normally I would burry my head in the ""sand"" and sulk about it for a week or two.  Not doing that this time, I screwed up, I take FULL responsibility for it.  What's done is done, I unfortunately can't change that, wish I could but can't.  So, I am not gonna sit here and feel all condemned and guilty and what not bc that is not what God wants.  He is a forgiving God.  I don't know why but I am not gonna ask Him why bc I would never want his mercy to have limits.  Mercy is somethign He gives when you just don't deserve it at all.  Well that is definitely me, I don't feel too deserving of His mercy, but it's there.  I know it's there, and am choosing to receive it instead of letting the devil just fill my mind with lies.  I am reading this book by Joyce Meyer called ""The Battlefield of the Mind"" good book so far.  It is gonna take me a while to get through it, only bc I don't just want to READ it and be done.  I want to be able to read it and apply it to my life and really break the mind-bondage I have in my life.  In doing that, and I mean SERIOUSLY doing it, will open so many doors for me to grow in God.  So this should be an interesting journey, a hard one, but worth it in the end.  I am so thankful that God is so forgiving.  Are ppl that forgiving?  I hesitate in saying yes, I wish they were...but i guess you can't put those types of expectations on ppl.  I personally don't see why not, we are told that we were created in His own image and that we are to be followers of Christ.  So if Christ is that forgiving then we as His ppl who are striving to be like Him should be as well.  Right?....I guess it is more complicating than that.  But then again...why complicate it?  WHy not just keep is simple, forgive!  Ok I am done with that subject.  I am also hoping that with this book I will be able to open myself up more to ppl.  My inability to communicate seems to be screwing me over every single time.  I understand why, to an extent, but then I don't understand.  I mean I am not trying to use it as an excuse, but...my family?..my childhood?  you didn't talk about your feelings or what was on your mind.  You held it in until just one day it went BAM!!!  I have adapted to that mentality and way of dealing with my emotions.  I have been like it for 20 something years, i think it is unrealistic expectation for someone to expect someone like that to change like THAT.  It takes time, but a word of advice to those that may be in this situation...acknowledge the process the 'closed' person is making, whether it is small or BIG.  Acknowledge it, bc if you don't that may just make it worse and cause them to close up again.  Well my peeps it is late and the bed is calling.  Hope you all have a wonderful fourth of july!  Ciao!  Love you all!!"

We got up and did absolutely NOTHING today! She was psyched bc she was actually getting paid for it, me...not so much.  I am unemployed at the momement.  That should all change soon, in Jesus Name!  I am really trying to get this starbucks job, I dont get why it is so hard though bc I was already hired by the bux in Winchester, but noone down by where I live seems to care about that.   It will all work out.  No worries!  My phone got turned off for a lil bit today (I will make a payment tomorrow).  I will say though, it feels really good to be a bit disconnected to the world.  Noone can get in contact with me at all!  I love it!  I figure if it is real important and they are THAT special, they can call my house.  Otherwise...oh well!  This past weekend was busy, but good.  Rubbed shoulders with some celebs on friday night and saturday.  Chilled at Jspa's with the crew.  The ladies prepared and cooked dinner on the grille, bc we ROCK!  But I gotta get goign to bed.  ciao!"

"event","Hey all!  Ok so what has been going on....Friday I had a TB meeting and supposedly BAILED on andrew and renee.  I wanted to go, but with this 'career' change finances are TIGHT!  So I went to my meeting then hopped home real quick.  VODT was in bed, just took some 'dryl so I was off to Eeks for a movie and fun time.  We rented 50 First Dates, GREAT movie!!  I forgot how funny it was and so sweet.  Oh to have a man love me that much!  ONE DAY I WILL!!  Then saturday was the Out of School Blast at Legacy.  It was fun, not as many kids as I had expected, but we still had a good time.  After that...guess what I did...but of course...Bailed on Andrew AGAIN!  He says he is getting used to it!  But this time I was just so tired and was thinking it was gonna be a bunch of us hanging out and was not in the mood.  So I went to DT's got my stuff then went to mo and amy's for some dinner and TV then headed home about 8ish.  Sunday I brought Gabbi to church then we went over my brother's in-laws for a cook out and to see the little ones.  I headed home about 6ish and just chilled at home, did some laundry.  Monday was a monday!  I have been talking to this guy via e-mail.  Not like 'talking' to him.  Well see I was dumb and put this ad up on craigslist.com for fun.  I was REALLY bored one night.  So I have been getting responses and stuff.  I actually realized how retarded guys can really be.  Well this one guy COMPLETELY offends me and asks me what my bra size is..JACK...!  Oh fart its 4!  I gotta go.  Ok I will write more later!.."

"event","The God I serve is so awesome!  I know it has been a while since I last updated but this week has been busy.  Tuesday was the last day of school and it was so fun!  Steb and Shan came to help their madukes with games and food and stuff for the kiddies.  The kids had a great time..getting dirty and wet.  We all know those are the two greatest things kids like doing.  After they soaked themselves to the bone and the caked themselves with dirt..we made a 40 foot sundae.  It was AWESOME!  Pastor Alan got this contraption that looked like almost a gutter from a house (but it was super clean).  About 5 of us just started going to town pouring in cut up bananas first then evenly distributing scoops of ice cream then TOPPINGS!  It was so yummy!  We are gonna do it again for camp.  I can't wait for camp!  That is gonna be so much fun.  Another reason why God is so good!  Wed night I was at church, after church I was pulled to the side where I found Pastor D, mrs. D, eeks, yo yo and amster chillin.  Then pastor D went on to tell me that someone felt pressed to bless me and pay ENTIRELY for me to go to Guatemala.  How awesome is that!  Funny thing is, maggster, amster, and a bunch others were JUST talking about that sunday.  Amster has been telling me how I NEED to go..I just explained to her it was not a matter of not wanting to go.  I just did not have that BURNING desire where I felt I needed to take that big step of faith and believe God for the money...BUT if God were to speak to someone and lead them to BLESS me..who am I to ruin their blessing!  So..someone blessed me!  I am all paid for...so I am going to guatemala Aug. 21-28, be praying for me.  I have not been on a missions trip since the summer between my sophmore and junior year.  The blessngs don't stop there...after church some of the crew (big mike, kirky, dana, renee and myself) went to D&D for some coffee.  Interesting conversation I must say!  It was good times though...dana and I sat there just taking rips at each other (they were all in good fun, no hurt feelings!)He is a funny guy...just needs to get his head on straight as far as tactful ways of saying things .  He tends to speak without thoroughly processing, but I can appreciate his honesty to an extent.  So it was between takin rips at dana and 'teasing' mike about his new 'interest'.  I admitted though..it was PURELY jealousy!  I am woman enough to admit it.  Kirky had a failed attempt of describing what mikes interest was like, and big mike was getting a bit defensive I must say...hhmm hhmm hmm....  We eventually got kicked out at 11 (closing time) so we continued the conversation out in the parking lot, not intentionally though.  Glad we did stay though bc we had the pleasure of meeting Nancy. We were chatting and noticing nancy who was just randomly pacing the huge parking lot.  She first stopped by us to see if we had any smokes..not so much.  She then continued pacing.  She eventually ended up right next to us, so renee initiated some chatting.  It was small talk at first, then she showed us the cover of her magazine which talked about all the churches that are closing down.  Then proceeded to ask 'Why does God want to close all the churches?' Kirk handled it so well!  Just explained to her God does not want that at all...that is not His desire.  The devil is the one who was sent here to '..steal, kill and destroy..'.  We chatted some more and just encouraged her and told her about IFC and about the food pantry and most importantly that God Loved Her so much!  Kirk then asked her if she would like us to pray for her..she said yes...she said for sanity.  That's big man...so I stepped up to the plate and said a simple prayer over her, nothing deep or long.  After that we gave her a hug, gave her a 'holy ghost' handshake adn we all departed and went our own ways.  I have never in my lifetime been so proud to call ppl my friends!  Renee and I were talking it is so refreshing to hang out with men and women who are sensitive to the spirit and not only that but act upon it too.  It was awesome!  I mean we very easily could have departed at 11 bc it was late and I had a long drive, but for whatever reason we just stayed. Well, no there was a reason and Nancy was her name.  SO...God bless nancy where ever she may be.  Thank you she is sane in Jesus name! the Spirit of the Lord quickens her mortal body and mind!  Man God is so good!! OK i think this entry is long enough..be blessed!  Ciao!"

"event","Ok this should be not too long, I am tired.  My weekend was pretty good.  Friday was work then I hung out with Eeks afterwards.  Went and picked up renee and T for ""Pursuing His Presence"" it's a womens prayer ministry type thing at IFC.  It only happens about 4 times a year.  It was SO GOOD!  VODT talked about His presence and what His presence does in your life.  Then we went into a time of prayer then she felt like women needed to go up and declare and decree some things concerning their lives.  It was good...I EVENTUALLY went up after toiling over it in my head and my stomach was doing flips and turns, plus a little point and look from VODT helped push me to do it.  It felt good though, I just declared some things over myself concerning stepping up in ministry.  I know I am called to minister and VODT has said it too, but...I just dont push myself to do it.  ANYWAYS...after prayer magalicious, renee and me went to kirks to meet up with the men.  Went and got some McD's and a movie..RAINDROPS!!  Went back to kirks and watched the movie.  Then parted our separate ways.  Saturday I went to the Linden outreach (an hour late I might add).  After that I headed up to E's for chill time and an old friend was coming over to the house for fun times at about 7pm.  So before that we went for a nice walk, contemplated for a long time about calling someone...she wimped out!  We colored our hair, then off to wal-mart to get snacks and went to rent a movie...?....RAINDROPS! yes again!  I am loving that movie!  for those that are like huh? and for renee bc she does not seem to remember that part...killin me...the movie is 'Along Came Polly'  hilarious movie!  So Mr. Goodner finally got there, we cooked some caesar salad..had some 'one sided' conversations..lol...then watched the movie.  After the movie he went home and we decided to watch it again...yea I fell asleep.  Crashed on the couch!  Sunday..went to second service then joined majority of the crew over at the A's for danny boys grad party.  Good times...i then departed to pick up sarah for babysitting duty, headed back to the A's for more fun times.  After baby duty was complete headed with eeks into Boston to drop the boys off then back to her place.  We were gonna watch a movie but we are all pretty tired...me especially..so I think it is bedtime for me.  Sweet dreams all!  Ciao!  love you all!"

"event","hey kids!  Sorry it has been a few days since my last update.  It has been a loooong week.  The days are becoming very limited at Agape.  I have mixed emotions.  One part of me is excited for the next step in my life and going after my dreams and goals.  The other part of me is gonna miss ACA like crazy.  I was a MESS at the K5 graduation...crying up a storm!  I am gonna miss my lil ones!  But I will be back to visit occassionally.  It has been a hectic week between graduations and award nights and church and prayer tonight, but its all good.  Keeping myself busy just keeps myself out of trouble!  Other than being busy life is SO SO SO good!  Inspite of this feeling of fear that I have every time I think about the end of the month, life is good.  I have an awesome family who loves me (has weird ways of expressing it, and sometimes I doubt that fact, but they do!)  I have unbelievable friends (near and far) who are always there for me...even if they go away (or I push them away for a season) they come back and love me for who I am.  I love you all, you ALL know who you are!  I have two beautiful nieces and one handsome nephew.  I serve a God who is absolutely phenomenal and continues to amaze me everyday.  I see His greatness the SECOND i go outside from the working ant to the monstrous ocean.  He is a God who loves me no matter what I do or say...He loved me even before I was born...He is the BESTEST friend I could ever have.  Loves me when I need to be loved and pampered but lays into me when I need a swift kick in my ""spicy butt"" (lol..some 4th grader said that to a classmate today..it was hilarious).  I serve a graceful, merciful, wonderful, loving, faithful, miracle-working God...I seriously could go on...I dont know I just feel like praising Him and giving credit where credit is due.  I seriosly have no idea where I would be if it were not for Him and His persistence in loving me.  It's a good day to be alive!  Ok I am done now.  I finish getting ready for prayer tonight and then chill time with the crew..who knows what we will do!  Ok ciao all!  Love you all...love you more!!"

"event","Monday morning...i am so tired!  I don't really know why, bc i did not stay out late at all this weekend.  You heard about the start of my weekend, the end was not so bad.  Sunday was church and Pastor called me out!..lol....he is funny!  It was not bad calling out...he was talking to the congregation on how he woke up in the middle of the night and felt really pressed to pray for all the partners.  So he pulled out his partner book (which has all our pictures) and prayed for everyone.  He randomly went through the list..said he prayed for Rach and stuff then was like..'You know Paige always needs prayer...' hhhmm he was wrong for that!  lol...it was all in good heart though.  So after service which probably got out about 1:00 or 1:30 Maggster, Jspa, Kirky, David, Renee, Rachel (new one) and myself went to Uno's for lunch.  Ate some cauliflower..had a bunch of laughs, roamed the mall a bit.  I went and saw my good ole parade buddies..well evelyn was the only one there, it was good to see her though!  Then went home and hung out with the fam.  Service was good yesterday, Pastor just ended up praying for ppl.  Those ppl that feel despair.  It's not really despair that I am feeling.  I will say though I am a bit scared.  Kind of scared of what the next few months entails.  I try not to think about it too much bc if I do I just get really fearful and question myself and decisions I have made.  My official last day at ACA is the 25th.  To answer ur question Matty...i have not heard back from them yet.  That is the current issue pressing my mind.  I applied to the bux in Winchester center...but if I am out of here come the 25th I dont think I want to have to drive up here anymore except for like church related events of course.  It will save me $$ in gas.  BUT then...I get a job on the south shore, I probably wont be seeing my friends too often, which bites.  So where do I make the sacrifice...time with my friends...or in my wallet bc of gas?  I am a social person and my friends mean the WORLD to me, but in this stage in my life, I think my priorities need to be altered.  It would only be for a season.  It would not be like NEVER seeing them, just not as much as I do now.  Decisions decisions....life was so much easier when I was young.  You grow up and like you gotta be responsible and accountable and stuff...it's hard! I really liked Maggsters entry about the pearl.  I totally feel you on that.  My whole thing is though..when the HECK does the pearl form and can be taken out!  lol!  Ok I need to get to work.  I am sure I will be writing more later...I got a lot on my mind!  Ciao!"

Great movie..if you like love stories, this is the movie you wanna see!  One part that I had to close my eyes on, but aside from that it was clean!  Last night I stayed at steb's house.  I had a SUPER hard time falling asleep, ended up going into the living room and watched Benny Hinn and the making of ""The Passion"".  Today was Seanie's graduation day!  I am so proud of him!  At the graduation we were the only negroes there!  Yea, welcome to NH! We also cheered the loudest!  Ppl were TRYING to show us up but they just looked like FOOLS!!! ha ha ha!  after that it was back to the house for some food and fun, but not before stopping at the mall to grab a lil something something!  Then I had to jet with the quickness bc it was sophia's bday party in Chelsie.  Capeverdian's!  No it was good, they got one of those bouncy castle things, so the kids and my brother (almost 30 yrs old) were having a blast!!  It was good times..had some food listened to some TUNES and then headed home about 7:30ish.  Tomorrow is church then steb time!  then steb and I are going to hang out with some of her old co-workers!  That should be fun!  Ok well I need to catch some zzzz's.  Catch up with you all later.  Ciao!  Love you...love YOU more!"

"event","Hey kiddies...just got back from church prayer.  It was good, had some difficulty focusing.  Not because I was too tired this time, my mind was focusing on something else.  So I got into the corner and dealt with it so I could focus on what corp prayer was all about.  You ever feel like you are holding onto something that just needs to be let go of?  Like when you were little and your mommy or daddy was leaving to go for work and you would just CLING onto their leg...hoping they would stay...but there came a time where you had to let go, bc they HAD to go to work.  Well I realized that is EXACTLY what I have been doing, well...no more.  Seriously, this time I am done, I have had enough.  I am just getting myself all frustrated and worked up, hoping and praying things will change or SOMETHING will happen.  Well, not to be a jerk about it, but..screw it!  I am so done praying ""foolish"" prayers (it seems like)  I see it like this...if there is someone in your life who is sick and you just pray so hard for their healing but they dont even believe in healing or at least for them..chances are, they are not going to be healed.  So why do it in my situation? They are pointless prayers...useless!  I dont understand it and frankly dont think I ever will...and now...dont so much care anymore.  There is like a wall now that has been built, let it be built...let it stay...i dont care anymore.  (ever feel like you need to get somethign out and go with your first feeling...whether it be angry or sad or whatever?...well this is my angry feeling that I have been hiding for SO long.)  Anyways, so..sometimes for me..drastic measures have to be made in order for me to 'get' things through to myself.  So, let the drastic measures begin....lol...God this sucks I really did not want to do this, never saw myself doing it EVER...Lord give me strength, wisdom, understanding and peace.  On a not so dreary note...I had my interview at the bux today.  It went SO WELL!  The manager is SUPER nice and she seemed to like me.  You know how you just walk away from and interview and you just feel good about it?  Yeah I felt good about it.  So be praying...she will get back to me around the 14th.  Ok well I am about to hit the sac!  talk to you all later..LOVE YOU!!!"

"event","Shu is gonna name her next fish princess sofia.  If you have ever seen ""How to Loose a Guy in 10 Days"" then you get it.  That was on cable last night, I forgot how funny that movie was.  Ok so my weekend...Friday was my first day with my 'patient' it was good.  The only thing not cool was the fact that she smokes..A LOT!  Other than that she is super easy going and nice.  Not bad at all.  After that I went and had a meeting with Mo and Amy, like I said before, just needed to get some things off my chest.  I wanted to take an extra step with them and our relationship.  It was good.  After talking we watched ""You God Served"".  The dancing in the movie is OFF THE HOOK!..that acting SUCKED! Those dance moves were awesome, I may have to take some of them.  Saturday was auntie and gabbi day.  It was cool, pretty low key.  Went and got my nails done, then we met todd, ilda, sophia and eldon at the movies to see Shrek 2.  Rene came along with us, she got the first hand Bonitto experience. We drove rene back into boston then went home and did some laundry, watched TV then went to bed.  Sunday was second service at church.  Went home and mom took us out for dinner at the Outback.  After thet I met up with the crew at Kirky's house for fun.  We were gonna go play mini golf but got there and the place smelt like cow poo..it was bad.  So we decided to NOT play mini golf and decided to go to the cliffs.  After a bunch of stops and jen tailgating us and driving like a drunk, we made it to the cliffs.  It was so peaceful out there.  We sang some p&w songs and it was just a time of worship and just relaxing.  Ppl broke off from the group and went down by the water and had some prayer time....although big mike was not too sure as to what james was doing.  I thought the whole hands raised in the air was a pretty good indication, maybe I am wrong.  LOL!  We decided, more like James decided it was time to depart and head home.  Renee, James and Jen went their way..and Big Mike, Kirk, Libster and myself went our way.  We decided to hit our HOTT spot...bickford's!  It was before 4 so they were still open..ok i will stop that.  We just got coffee and libster got a snack.  We talked for a good hour maybe two, it was good quality time.  Kirk was getting EXTREMELY anoyed and was ready to go so we left.  It was late anyways I had a long drive.  So we departed, my drive home was HARD...i was texting with shu in order to keep my attention focused on SOMETHING.  Finally made it home at 3..went right to bed.  Monday went to Chuck-E-Cheese for Sophia's bday.  oh yeah p.s. I despise CEC.  It is a well known fact that aunty does not like CEC, yet everyone plans bdays there.  WHY?...why must I be tortured!  It actually was not that bad, as bad as I thought it would be.  Worst part was being stuck in the parking lot for about 40 mins.  Supposedly there was a fire and the mall that CEC is in has only one entrance/exit.  So..noone was going anywhere.  Eventually got out, went home and it was a nice quiet night at home.  That was my weekend...not too eventful, but nice.  Didnt get to see steb aside from sunday morning, which was a bummer, but its gravy baby!  Ok this nigga needs to get to work. Talk to you cats latta..love you..love you more!"

"event","Do I truly know?....I think I will find out soon enough.  I had a meeting last night with Mo and Amy, I called it, needed to 'air some things out'.  I have been talking to Shu the past week about a certain issue in my life that I have been dealing with for the past few years.  I had a moment of weakness last weekend, like imperfect ppl do, but this time it was different.  In the past I have had my imperfect moments and have just brushed them off as just that...imperfect moments.  This time was different, it hit me deeper this time.  It was an imperfect moment, yes, but what was my reasoning?  what was I thinking? honestly, i dont know.  Normally i have a reason and a purpose...I RUN to it, bc I crave it to ease my pain to comfort me for the moment, but not this time.  Yes there has been pain the past month or so, so much at times I felt like I could not handle it.  Not once though was there a craving, not one single time, so why then?  why do it?  I have no idea, but I do know it was wrong.  How do I fix it, so it doesnt happen again?  I can't guarantee that the cravings wont come back, that would be an unrealistic thought.  I can guarantee though that the 'imperfect moment' wont happen again.  Why I can say that is bc I have decided to take the 'extra' step that I should have taken a LONG time ago...and that's...acountability.  I have not really had anyone in my life keeping me acountable for my every move.  not that they need to be looking over my shoulder bc I am 23 and can discipline myself.  But with certain things and in order for me to grow in the things I want to grow in, acountability is needed.  So....I opened that door.  Do I know what it entails?...NO CLUE!  That can be scary, but also exciting.  I see this as just another opportunity for growth, big growth!  It will be a hard road, this acountability thing, but well worth it.  Its opening a door, but also closing some doors that have been propped open for so long.  It's gonna be difficult standing my ground in some instances, my biggest fear is that I dont want to seem hypocritical.....one week im doing it....the next I am condemning it.  That's not my heart...i just want to change and live a holy life.  I don't care what others think about it, it's my life...my conviction.  I want a life where young ppl can look at me and see a righteous woman of God and be encouraged to seek that same thing.  I just want to follow Christ, that means sacrifice...there is a phrase my Pastor says...'if you want something you have never had, you are going to have to do something you have never done'...well this is my 'never done'.  I just want something I have never had...Here goes nothing...or I guess...here goes Everything!"

Lets see...that past few days have been pretty good.  Monday, well monday was a monday!  It was a ffnne day!  Steb substituted at the school so that was by far the hightlight of my day.  I Had a WONDERFUL conversation with Lee.  Those that do not know who lee is, he is a guy I dated in HS for about 3 years.  A great guy, just didnt have his head on all that straight.   He is getting it on straight though so that is awesome and I am so happy for him.  He has so much potential in him, the main reason I dated him for so long, he just has to see it himself.  He is getting there though, but it was just a great convo.  He is dealing and going through things that I have been going through the last 2 months so it was good to be able to tell him what I have learned and realized.  It was good!  I actually walked away from the convo feeling good..which normally I dont.  Monday after work, went to the gym then home had dinner and was in bed by like 8:30.  Tuesday, steb subbed again...good times!  I bugged her a few times...and mo joined in on the fun too.  Relatively uneventful day.  Talked to steb for a bit when she was done subbing.  After work went to the gym then off to get T and Renee for church prayer.  Prayer was good,  I will admit I was a bit distracted and found it hard to focus.  I was TIRED...kept dozing off.  It was good prayer though, for the parts I was focused on.  After that chit chatted with the girls in the lot for a bit then took T home, then I went I home!  These drives back and forth have been HARD!  I have been strugglin!  Ok..wed..late for work...one of the K5 boys got a big splinter in his hand so me, susan, and eeks held him down in order to take it out.  He was NOT feeling it!  screaming, kicking, throwing his body and limbs in every way!  Nurse susan got it out though!  He was gravy after...we gave him a lollipop so he would not be TOO traumatized.  After work, went to the gym, took a shower.  Ok those women at the gym are RIDICULOUS!  I am a modest person so like I bring all my stuff to the shower with me so I take my shower, dry off and change right there.  Now I dont mind seeing women walking around in their towels and i can deal with underwear (as long as it COVERS) but there were these chics walking around in the NUDE!  WAY too much for me!  I was like ""WHOA!"" when she walked by!  It was nasty!  I was traumatized!  After that I went to church to be cleansed!  lol!  church was good...Pastor Mo is on a series called 'Beyond Belief to Conviction' good stuff!  After church had a legacy meeting, then off to Applebee's for Maggster's bday!  Good times with the crew!  Left drove home...tried calling steb bc I was  STRUGGLING!!!  my eyes just wanted to close!  No answer...oh well...I just turned up my Warren Barfield and jammed!  This morning driving was even WORSE!  I need to find someone who will be up at 7am so I can talk to when i cant see the lines straight!  I was all over the place! lol!  Now I am here at work..so that was my last three days!  You feel better now?...I do!  OK now that you are updated and the world is now well...I gotta get to work!  Ciao!  love you all...love you more!"

Saturday got up came to good ole ACA for the walk-a-jog-athon, which was a BUST!  It amazes me how ppl don't get involved with their children's school.   It is very important!  After that, I dropped the rays back at home, then headed over to the Kirks for some chill time.  My daddy was there looking at a job they had for him.  My dad is the BEST carpenter EVER..almost as good as Jesus!  He can build anything and everythign and build it GOOD!  So yeah, I chilled there...steb and riguy and big mike eventually showed up.  We FINALLY decided to go and get somethign to eat.  This was of course AFTER kirky decided to go to his room and break out some old snow camp pics and show them to big mike.  Big mike is the only one really in the group who we have not known since little folks.  Yeah not cool!  I mean big mike is a cool guy, but, I dont know him THAT well and, definitely not well enough to go showing him my 'tom boy, fro days' But its all good, no harm done!  Ok so dinner at TN barbecue something or other...then off to liberty tree to see Shrek 2.  By then lster, jspa, magster, and danny boy caught up with us to see the movie.  The movie...HILARIOUS!  it was great!  I am gonna go see it again, I have to in order to get the one-liners.  My fav part was when they did the 'COPS' bit..but it was called 'Knights' lol...they went around with pepper mills grinding pepper in their faces..lol..just go see it!  Sunday was church, both services!  Hollers was there...WOO HOO!!!  after church went to a short TB meeting then swung by kirky's for a lil dinner.  Then kirky and I went to pick up nai nai then headed for the polonski's for food and fun with Hollers.  I didnt get much QT with her, but its gravy, I was just happy to have her in the same room!  I was kind of looking forward to talking to her, but another time I guess.  I would actually love to talk to someone...you ever have so much on your mind and inside of you that you just want to sit down with someone and talk about it.  Not necessarily to get like counseling or anything, but just to get it out in the open air.  Just to have that release?  Well that is me right about now...I have ppl I could talk to, but i choose not to.  Its not that I dont trust them or anything like that, I am just the type of person where I dont goopenly sharing my heart with ppl.  I dont open up too easily, so when someone gets to that point where I am opening up to them, that is a BIG deal.  A really big deal!  I mean I open up to my friends..but to an extent...not sure that all made sense.  But I need to do something for my country..or at least ACA. Ciao!  love you all...love you more!"

Yeah so day was gravy until I got home and found my bday card that steb had gotten me torn up into little pieces on my bed.  Gabbi, my 3yr old niece, took it off my night stand and decided to scribble all over it and tear it up.  I have NEVER been so heated at a 3 yr old than I am right now.  My mom is just like oh..its just a card...she is only 3.  Whatever..she knows not to take other ppls stuff and TEAR IT UP!  she knew she was wrong bc when I started heading to my room she says ""uh-oh i ripped aunties card""  Yeah she knew she was wrong!  They are just like whatever...no idea how important that card was to me, but can I really get madd at a 3 yr old...not so much! There will be more cards...I hope...I think so.

"event","Hey all. Wow, sorry it has been a few days. You must be going crazy wondering where I have been and what I have been doing...or not!  My weekend was good!  A bit too expensive, and that is going to change with the quickness!  Friday night we had a Give It Up! at the woburn Y.  Not too many kids came, but the step team got to step so that is always a plus!  and I would like to point out the fact that neither me nor shan messed up!  but seanie did, it was minor though.  After the GIU i met the crew (eeks, steb, multi, lster, shan, kirky) at the revere cinemas to see Troy.  Good movie!  saw a little bit too much of mr. pitt's backside..but it was still a really good movie!  After that it was off to hingham.  Saturday I worked from 9:45-4..my LAST day I might add!  It was good...I felt a little bit sad to say goodbye..no not really!  After that I went to the DT's for some fellowship time with vodt.  It was shorter than I expected, BUT it was good none the less.  We just chit chatted and I caught her up on my life.  Told her my plans for the next few months and what has been occuring in my life the last few months.  All the changes that have happened and that will happen.  It was good!  After that I made more plans with the crew (big mike, kirky, multi, lster, and daniel).  This time we went to richardson's did some batting cages then had some icecream.  As we were sitting there eating ice cream an old friend of ours popped up in the parking lot so we were out there talking to him and his brother for a good 2 hours.  The place closed and were were still wired.  Well, actually big mike was on this coffee fix and even though we had gotten BEFORE going to richardson's he wanted more!  He wanted to go into boston, but we were like...hhmm not so much!  So we decided to go to Bickfords.  Got some coffee and fellowshipped for a while I ordered what was supposed to be potato skins, it was more like potato nuggets.  it was nasty! Then we went home, took me a little longer to get home, bc I was so freakin tired. It was sweet though...big mike dropped us all off at multi's house and I got in my car and was like 2 minutes away and he called me.  Told me to be sure to call him back when I safely arrived at the DT's.  I thought that was sweet of him to care.  I want some more guy friends that care that much!  So I got home about 2am..the hall light was STILL on..lol! went RIGHT to bed.  I was beat.  Sunday was church, we had a guest speaker named Phil Driscoll.  One of the best trumpet players to ever live!  He was phenomenal!  It was amazing...getting the tape!  After church went out to lunch with david, jspa, and lster.  Then took lster on her last trip into peterborough adn then headed home.  Got home, went to the gym with nicole and then we headed over to my cousins house.  She graduated from College today, it was a normal good time family party.  Food...dessert then lots of dancing and acting like fools.  Its what me, jena and chandra do best!  Good times watching the older family members get their groove jiggy on..LOL!  It was fun though!  Finally got home at 1am then woke up this morning for work..LATE!  So, it was a good weekend, lack of sleep, but fun!  well worth it!  I am actually really enjoying mytie spent with different ppl than I am used to.  Trying to make an effort to get to know other ppl on a higher level, not just a 'we have fun hanging out' level.  That is important though I think that is honestly the foundation of a relationship.  if you don't even enjoy spending time with the person you are not going to have the opportunity to build the relationship anyways.  I think lots of other things could go out of wack and turn bad but if you have that to fall back on..its a good place to start rebuilding the relationship, as long as both are willing.  Jspa and i were talking a few weeks ago about how there is a restoration period in relationships that have gone bad.  I strongly believe that bc God is so into relationships and us having ppl in our lives.  We need Him more than anything yes, but we also need ppl more than anything too.  We can't fully depend on ppl for our self-worth, you will end up not having any, but we need ppl in our lives to survive.  I also strongly believe that some ppl are placed in our lives by God for a long time, like forever and you know who those ppl are.  Others are placed in our life obviously by God but maybe for only a short season.  You just have to recognize who those are purposed to be there forever and who is not.  Its hard to distinguish sometimes...and sometimes its SO right in your face!  Like I am starting to realize who I know will be here for a long time...like...jspa, we were close for a long time in HS then things kind of became distant but now that we are both getting things right I think God is bringing us back together for a reason.  Then there is multi, that is a given, she needs me, and I need her!  Eeks..lifer!  We have TOO much fun together.  Lets see who else...well, steb of course!  we have had sine speed bumps recently but, I have confidence and peace that they are just simply speed bumps.  Aside from a lot of history we have we are connected in a lot of other ways.  As many times in the last few weeks i have wanted to just throw in the towel and say forget it, im done! God was telling me NO! , its not gonna stay this way.  Just do what you gotta do and stay focused on ME and it will fall into place.  When it falls into place, not the place where it HAS been, but a better place, it will be so much better and hold more value.  The other day i was reading TPDL and for that day it talked about problems in our life and how they are there to help us grow.  Choosing to be better rather than bitter.  Taking what comes your way and using it for your growth process in becoming like Christ.  If for some reason it does not fall into place God will take care of it, as long as I am focused on Him and pleasing only Him.  So...unless otherwise told..she is a lifer too..a beyond lifer...like..we will have our mansions next to each other in heaven!  lol..I wonder if that happens!  Like I wonder if God places you and your friends near each other in heaven.  How much fun would we have if me and all my peeps lived next to each other?!  oh wow..Oh man that would be HOTT! good times had by all, Jesus would be wanting to crash our parties! HA HA!  So yeah, friends..got a bit side tracked.  I am starting to develop new friendships now, so I dont know whether they are lifers or not, but I dont care!  I like getting the chance to get closer to them and being let into their world and opening up mine to them, which is hard for me.  There are others in my life I consider lifers too, but I am not gonna list them all.  I am just SO popular! lol..no not really!  I am just blessed to have good group of friends surrounding me!  The lifers pretty much know who they are!  Ok well I think I have said enough, I could go on about this for a long time!  I need to get to work.  Write more later!"

"event","I love that movie!  Morning folks.  I must draw attention to the fact that I have been pretty consistent with this live journal thing!  Go me! Go me! I am sittin here at work listening to..guess?..Warren Barfield!  I absolutely love this cd!  My favorite tracks are 9 and 10.  #9 is called 'Looking for love' it talks about how you are always looking for love (God) and He is actually looking for you but you are just basically drowning out His voice so you cant even hear him calling you.  There is a line that says the 'the less there is of you, the more there is to grow' that went right along with what yoyo was talking about last night...emptying yourself out so God can fill you up.  Removing those things that you have desparately tried to fill yourself up with whether it be music, dancing, bf/gf, friends, drugs, alcohol ETC.!  the list goes on!  Ok done....So saturday is my last day at Parade!  Man it feels good to know that, its gonna feel even better to go in saturday morning and then leave my keys..NICE!  I am so tired!  As you well know i went to bed about 12:15 but did not actually go to sleep till about 1:30 bc I read for a bit.  I did find out some comforting information last night, that someone has been reading my journal, had no idea!  It just felt good to know that they still cared, still stinks that they find out about whats going on in my life via livejournal, but that's better than nothing!  I will take it!  Oh ok so bux!  Well I have been talking about applying to the bux for a while now.  Since I gave parade the 'peace im out!' I decided I was gonna do what I have been wanting to do!..apply to the bux!  I have alterior motives for working there though!  I would love to eventually one day open up my own coffee house/club.  Somewhere ppl can go late thursday, friday and saturday night and just CHILL!  Listen to some music and relax, play some games, dance! but in a healthy environment!  So yeah that is a dream of mine!  So that's why I wanna work at the bux..to get a feel of it see how its all done.  ANYWAYS...I went to the gym tues after work, was coming to church prayer and decided to stop at the bux to just get coffee...the usual..iced grande sugar free vanilla soy latte..mmmm!  So I walked in and ordered and the girls behind the counter were like ""YOU SAID THAT PERFECTLY!...you should get a job here!""  WELL ACTUALLY!..lol.  The manager was there but then she left so I was talking to the girls and they were like you need apply we would SO love working with you!  So I went back yesterday and dropped the app off.  SO be praying...I walk in favor!  Ok well I guess I should do somethign for my country...well for Agape at least! chat with you all later.  Love you all....love YOU more!"

"event","Its late so I am keeping this short and sweet!  Today was a great day!  I was just in a super good mood all day!  This whole new look on life I guess I am taking is SUPER!  Simplicity!  a great word!  Well my day started out with me ministering at chapel!  ooo I am not tryin to brag, but...it was good!  I am readin this book called ""Purpose Driven Life""  ooooo man! it is GOOD!  Its like broken up into a daily devotional type thing so the last two days have been on spiritual growth and character development.  How we are supposed to be Christlike...very timely for me!  So I actually like to preach on things that I am personally going through or have gone through, so I did that.  I was just spittin it out, i just totally lost 'myself' somewhere in there and like it felt like I was not even talking.  The words were just coming to me and flowin and I got lost just once I believe which I normally get all stumbled up in it VARIOUS times!  It was good.  I would say get the tape..BUT...there is none!  So tonight at youth Yoyo preached..OH MY GOSH!  She is a teenager that is so gifted in music and ministry and preaching.  She has a lot in her, she got some of it out today but..I strongly believe that is just the TIP of her iceburg.  You CAN get that tape!  I think I need one to get all those like one liners she would say..there was a bunch of them were like OOOO SAY IT AGAIN! it was so good, I am so proud of her and the woman she is becoming!  Its good to be in a church so long where you actually see those that seemed so MUCH younger than you just stepping up in ministry, and actually being there witnessing it is SUCH a blessing from God!  After service a bunch of us went to Soc's in Melrose I think.  IT was good times.  Some spaz of an old man yelled at Yoyo for leaning up against his 'show car'...riiiight!  Eeks, the big sis laid it down for him though, he was just a mean old man, wanted to pick a fight.  Those are times the other person better be grateful me and my friends are saved...I wanted to pull out my mazda key and just slide it down the side of his car.  Eeks handled it very well!   Plus if he called his show car homies we had a good slew of peeps backin her up.  It was Multi (hate that nickname!), Big Mike, Kirky, Steb, Eeks, Yoyo, Libster, Daniel (i think that is his name) and sheila.  Good times!  I think the wed night out after church needs to become a tradition!  EVERY WEEK!  Its fun!  Then I dropped libster off at her APT in beantown...yeah...never knew that was a game tonight!  took me about 40 mins to get home from boston...usually takes about 20.  I LOVE boston traffic!  Jewls called me, but it was during church so I did not get it.  I will call her back tomorrow I think, I miss her!  I miss a lot of ppl actually...I miss Laura, Krystle, Lecia, Brent!! (aaww GQ!), Steve (sometimes), Jason, Jad, Matt, Hollers, Stac, Shan, Andrew, Geno..all from Rhema..the list goes on though.  I am in a super like I dont know mood...like missing old relationships that I had mainly at rhema...but some here.  I miss sean and ryan and lee and danielle and E and jemica and Stephanie (she's not here but I still miss her and her blonde moments, like all the time blonde moments!)  Ok I am done with that....Oh fart it is 12:15..I need sleep!  I will share tomorrow about my 'Bux experience!  until then..ciao! love you all!!...love YOU more!"

"event","I was reading some old journal entries...not my own, but ones that matty did.  I came to the conclusion that...there needs to be some sort of 'reunion' story written for the EF crew!  Matt you are the creative one in the group so...get to it!  lol!  I miss my EF days, as much as I may not have like the JOB i loved the people, we had GOOD times!  Lots of memories!  sigh!  like....the demise of the black jelly bean..moment of silence...and bup bup bup...hilary...noodle....when I accidentally called noodle noodle....DOIG....lil megan....Mr. Hardsub....John T...grilled cheese sandwiches...oh and so much more! ...here's to the EF days!!  Now...abie's married (i think) and Matty is in cali (but moving back) and erin...is now an EF Benny (way too cool!).  I think once erin takes over the company bc we all know she is an EF lifer, she needs to hire us all back and put us in charge.   I want the office closest to the pool!  Ok I am done reminiscing I think....yea done.  It is so nice out today, a shame I am stuck in this office with these wonderful blessing from God children.  We are having a talent show next monday night and I get to be the judge for the auditions..LOL!  Dr. told me to not make them cry, I was gonna pull out some simon cowell ""go loose 35 lbs and try again another year KID!""  But I am not that mean!   I will be easy on the little ones.  I will be paula!  LOL...we did an American Idol skit at youth group at a Give It UP! night.  It was HILARIOUS!  Alex was randy.  Alex is this like tooth pick of a black boy (awesome kid!).  Towards the end he just stands up and was like ""yeah, well I lost 200lbs on the subway diet..Thanks Jarad!"" we all lost it!  Then Sean was simon, he was really good at the crude and degrading comments (making ppl feel like they are 2in tall.  E was paula..lol..she was good!  Had a positive thing to say about EVERYONE..even my circle of life interpretational dance...and shans little mermaid production.  It was great!  A lot of fun!  Ok I got work to do...I will do some more reminiscing later!  ciao everyone!  I love you all so much!  really I do!"

"event","Has anyone heard of Warren Barfield?  Yeah well if not, his cd is GREAT!  The lyrics are truly awesome.  There is one song called 'mistaken', and it just talks about being mistaken for Christ.  Not in a ""i wanna be a god"" sort of way but in the way we should.  Check out the lyrics.......... http://www.letssingit.com    I love this song bc it is how we are supposed to live our lives. When ppl look at us or I should say me i want them to not see simply just me, but see the greater one inside of me.  That does not mean I go around praying in tongues ALL the time or every other word is AMEN or GLORY TO GOD...I just live holy.  Walk in Love...be friendly.  It's so simple yet has such a dynamic to it.  I am also reading this book called ""The Purpose Driven Life"" yeah great book!  GET IT!  It is broken down into days and today was titled ""Created to Become like Christ""  The part that really impacted me was Rick Warren made the statement 'Christlikeness is all about transforming your character, not your personality'  For so long I thought I had to remove and change things about my personality in order to please Christ or in order to be like Him.  The reality of the situation is...I DON'T!  I dont have to try and stop being a jokester and being funny.  That was given to me by God, He likes that about me and my ability to make ppl laugh.  I dont have to get rid of that and be SERIOUS all the time in order to fulfill God's plan for my life.  That is part of His plan for my life...a simple revelation yet...its been hard for me to grasp it!  But I got it now!  not letting go of it!  Life is great!  Its been dificult the past couple of weeks bc of lots of changes, but...God is good!  He restores things, when the time is right.  He is re-adjusting my priorities and focus.  Not everything is making sense right now in some situations, but all I can do it trust Him that He has it all worked out.  It's been laid at His feet, I just gotta leave it there and stop going back and looking at it.  Simplicity!  that is my current life motto.  Keeping it simple!  Life is too short to complicate things, God did not intend for life to be so complicated...it gets complicated when we put our two sense into it and try and figure things out on our own.  I challenge you..try it..Keep it Simple!  As part of my 'Keeping it Simple' tactic I quit Parade!  lol...it felt good to write that note and leave it.  I know my manager will be heated, but...I cant keep making my decisions based on what will please someone.  Too much drama there, and I am just not enjoying the job anymore...it has been like that since december.  So I am done!  I got peace about it, gotta get another job, but i still have peace!  So life is gravy!  I will admit, there are some things missing that feel out of place and I am still not understanding why, but again all I can do is Trust God!  He has it all under control, as long as I keep walking with Him!  Keep it Simple!!"

"event","No I am not, but that was the first question asked by the woman who hit my car with her BMW sunday morning before church.  I went into boston to pick up the boys bc we were singing p&w for church.  So its 6:30 in the morning...noone in boston..so I was right in front of Berklee and decided to bang a U-turn.  I thought I checked good enough..so..I went for it.  There was no sign so it was not ilegal, I dont think.  But I obviously did not look good enough, was banging the U-turn and smack the BMW smacks into my back door, on the drivers side.  I pulled over in front of Berklee and got my stuff together to exchange info.  Yeah she walks across the street and says ""are you drunk""...'no maam im not'...""well you must be High then""...'not so much!'  Then she began to curse me out like a sailor...she took my info and wrote it down.  I went to call T to tell her I was running a bit late...told her what happened and that there was no damage to my vehicle..miss sailor mumbled something.  So I asked her what she said, she said 'your 'S' is not damaged but my 'S' is""  yeah so I was like ok listen...you need to just chill, I did not plan for this to happen, I am taking responsibility for it, there is no reason to swear, it is offensive to me.  She had some smart remark, but I was like whatever...so I asked her for her info..she was like ""why?""...'uuhh..procedure!...she was like it was your fault so I dont see why you need mine...she gave it to me eventually.  Then she went on her way to work and we went to church.  Church...was GREAT!  we did p&w and..man did I release some stuff!  I was a basket case first service.  But service was AWESOME...Pastor had an on point message about love...and finding your identity.  It was great!  It hit home for me and it was a message in due season.  Ok well I am at work so...better get something done!  Ciao!"

So today was a pretty good day in the life of Paige.  I celebrated my 23rd birthday last wed, so that was pretty exciting.  Nothing REALLY interesting happened...my most fav person in the world, i will refer to her as steb)...took me out for coffee and then arranged for me, her and some other peeps to go to chili's for dinner.  She blind folded me and everything, it was the best bday day I have ever had.  Easter was good day.  Pigged out on ham...roast beef...mashed potatoes...and bean caserole.  It was a great day though, well the start of it was.  Steb and I got into..well not really a spat or anything...i did something dumb and there was weirdness for like all of 12 hours.  Those were THE hardest 12 hours...but things are getting back  to normal.  That's why I love her so much, she is the best.  Well I gotta go...I will be sure to write more later!  promise!"

Well I am seriously bored today, I must say.  today was a half day for the kiddies and these days seem to go by A LOT slower than the others.  I am so tired though!  I have not been home ALL week!  Pastor's parents have been in town finishing up some things so they can move here next month, so I was at a friends house all week.  Busy weekend ahead, what else is new huh?  I am like a work-a-holic, between Parade of Shoes, Agape and IFC I never rest!  I get to sleep in tomorrow, of course before I go to a 5 hour class on managing your finances!  OH JOY!  35 More days unti lI will be in SUNNY FLORIDA, shaking hands with Mickey, aren't you jealous Shan!  I know I know, you will be moving there...BLAH!!!!  Just rub it in why don't you!  So today was a sad day...Brother Kenneth E. Hagin went home to be with the Lord.  He was 86 years old but he will be so missed!  those of you who do not know who he is, which I dont expect you to, he is called one of the ""fathers of our modern faith"" he was an outstanding man of God, his anointing was Healing.  Wanna know more about him visit the website...rhema.org  He is also the founder of the school I went to.  It was a bit stressfull because we kept hearing different things, one minute he is dead the next he is not and it is just a rumor...then he is...then he's not....AAAAHHH, but it is official he has passed away.  I can only imagine the crazy amount of ppl who will be at his ""home going"" service!  CRAZY!!!!  It is super cloudy here today!  Hopefully it will be nicer tomorrow.  Sunday is a looooong day, I have to work open to close at POS (10:30-7)  YIKES!!  Hey if any of you are in the area come by and say hi...I work at the burlington mall usually nights!  it's about time for me to go!  so i will catch you cats all on the FLIP SIDE!!!  peace word to the outie!"

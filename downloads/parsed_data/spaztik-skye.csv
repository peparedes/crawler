She said,Don't, 
Don't let it go to your head.
Boys like you are a dime a dozen.
Boys like you are a dime a dozen.
She said,
You're a touch overrated. 
You're a lush and I hate it.
But these grass stains on my knees
they won't mean a thing.
And all I 
Need to know 
Is that I'm something you'll be missing
Maybe I should hate you for this 
Never really did ever quite get that far 
Maybe I should hate you for this 
Never really did ever quite get that... 
I'd never lie to you 
Unless I had to 
I'll do what I got to 
Unless I had to 
I'll do what I got to
The truth 
Is you could slit my throat 
And with my one last gasping breath 
I'd apologize for bleeding on your shirt."

"event","Hiya! Mary here with a quick movie review, and you're listening to The Chart, on KCRW. <br /><br /><strong>The Da Vinci Code <br /></strong><br />Most of the other reviews I have been hearing or reading about this flick&nbsp;are claiming things such as ""unsatifying"" and ""puzzling"" or ""a miracle of underachievment""... <br /><br />As far as the acting reviews are concerned, that is sheer opinion, but I thought everyone in that movie was amazingly brilliant. Each and every actor emobodied their character as though they had walked straight out of the book. <br /><br />To adress the first claims of ""unsatisfying"" and ""puzzling"", I would first like to say that: they find The Grail. What more satisfying of an ending do you want? Also, I believe, if this movie is even the slightest bit ""unsatyifying"" it is because it leaves the viewer with an open ending. It simply says: believe what you will, that is your choice. <br />Now, ""puzzling""? Hmm, that's a head scratcher... My explanation for the claim of ""puzzling"" is that America is lazy (duh). This movie does not think for you. If you simply watch it, you will indeed be puzzled. This movie provokes thought, so if you do not pay attention, and do not think about what is going on, then you're SOL. Think and process... this is not another Scary Movie or your run-of-the-mill Disney flick. The Da Vinci Code is for the intellectual, so if you can't handle that, then STFU! <br /><br />Finally: ""a miracle of underachievment""... right... well... since when has any movie been a perfect mirror of the book? By saying it is an ""underachievment"" they're saying it was not any where near an equal to the book... um, duh: the book is always, ALWAYS better than the movie. <br />This book is over 500 pages long, and full of thought, back ground, and detail, all of which make the book brilliant. This would have made for a 6 hours, drawn out, OVERachievment of a movie. The screen writer did what he had to do, and I felt that he emodied the book as well as he could. You can't watch the movie like you're reading the book. <br />Think about when you saw Harry Potter and The Prisioner of Azkaban... after seeing that movie you finally realized that books and movies (although involving the same story) are 2 sepearte entities. <br />Watch this movie as it's own. <br /><br />My one and only complaint about this movie was that it seemed that when the writer adapted Sophie to the screen play, she lost some of her intellegence. Now don't get me wrong, Audrey Tautou was amazing and wonderful, I'll state that flat out, right now. It just seemed like Sophie didn't take on the same major roll of the strong, smart and sassy woman. I felt this was an odd choice of translation from book to movie... to move the only female character out of the spot light. The entire point of this story is that the sacred feminine was forgotten, and stripped of her glory. <br />So that being said, why take power and intrigue out of your only female character? <br />One thing is for sure about the movie's Sophie: you DO NOT mess with her. End of story. <br /><br />In closing (I swear this is the last of it) I would like to say that this beautiful movie picked me up at the opening credits, and didn't put me back down until I walked out of the theatre. As always, a brilliant story, brilliant acting, and a brilliant imagination, make for one hell of an intelligent movie. <br /><br />This has been a movie review by Mary, and you're&nbsp;tuned in&nbsp;to The Chart, on KCRW."

"event","Why hello there! This is Mary, and you're listening to The Chart, on KCRW.

Speculative fiction. What is this, you might ask? Well, we all know what fiction is:
Lets see... it's a noun, and from the dictonary it says that it's ""a literary work based on the imagination and not necessarily on fact"" 

Now we'll move on to the word speculative:
this is a notional term, and it means ""Of, characterized by, or based upon contemplative speculation""... 
and speculation is ""a message expressing an opinion based on incomplete evidence""

Put it all together and we get:
""an all-encompassing term which includes science fiction, alternative history (fiction), horror and fantasy.""

Now I'll say it... the most talked about subject over the past few weeks, months, and even years: The Da Vinci Code. This book and now movie is speculative fiction. Plain and simple. 

But if it truly is a fiction tale, then why all of the fuss about it? I think I can answer that question for you. Most of the fuss is coming from conservative Christian groups, who are mostly Catholic.
Let me tell you a little story. My good friend Andrew, whom you all know (but never hear from) has a little sister that goes to Catholic grade school (we know all about those). He told me that she was told, at school, not to go see this movie because it was full of false stories and lies... um... right... that's what fiction is: false stories. We've been through this already!

So why is this book so dangerous? Because it has been making people think. And thinking is a wonderful thing. When you think, you're going to learn more about yourself, and what you believe in... you're going to analyze why you believe it, and make up your own mind on your points of views, moral, and beliefs. Weather it be that you prefer Plain M&M's to Peanut M&M's or weather you believe that Jesus is divine or was simply mortal. Thinking can work wonders.
So here is the danger in thinking: people will loose faith, and trust logic instead. When people loose faith, they stop going to church, and if enough people stop going to church, it will no longer exist.
So are you still wondering why the Catholics told the youngins not to go see this movie? Because they don't want them to start thinking for themselves. I don't mean to sound like I'm pointing fingers or claiming brain washing or anything *ahem* but this is God's honest truth, no fiction involved. If these childen start thinking now, they will not develop the foundation of faith that is needed before they deviate into the secular world. These folks want a few more years to build this foundation, in hopes of keeping their church alive, because without this generation of believers and followers, the chruch has no future. 

Do you catch my drift?
Let me sumarize for you:
The Da Vinich Code--->thinking--->loosing faith/trusting logic--->the fall of the chruch

Sure this may be a rather radical point of view, but this is most likely why the chruch is all up in a tissy about this book and now movie. 

I personally believe that anything that makes anyone think is apsolutely wonderful. I think that everyone needs to decide for themselves what they believe, and above all, to understand what they believe... and after wards, if you still find yourself with faith, then wonderful! You know what you believe... if you find yourself with logic, then wonderful! You know what you don't believe.

God (if you belive) gave us free will. So why would He not want us use it?

This has been a segment on The Da Vinci Code by Mary. Thank you for tuning in, and as always, you're listening to The Chart, on KCRW."

"event","Good evening everyone! This is Mary, and you're listening to The Chart, on KCRW.

So... Wednsday night television, anyone? Actually, let me narrow that down for you... Lost, anyone?

If you're not watching this show, you should be. End of story.

This segment will be brief, because all I want to do is ask the questions:
What is the ""project"" that involves The Hatchs, observation, pushing buttons, etc.?
Where did The Others come from?
Who are The Others?
Why do The Others take the kids?
WHAT WAS THAT BLACK SMOKEY SHIT AT THE END OF SEASON 1?!
How did Locke become crippled?
When will Michael die slowly and painfully?
What was REALLY up with Libby at the Mental Institution?
Was Libby really a Psych Doc.?
How did Shannon die? (I haven't seen the beginning of Season 2 yet)

And I'm sure there are many, many more, but I think those will do for now. 
When will these questions be answered? Lord only knows! It might be next week's episode, it might be the season finale, it might be the series finale... I just don't know!
But one thing I do know... I'll be watching every step of the way, because this, ladys and gents, is some spectacular television.

This has been a quickie segment about Lost by Mary, be sure to tune into Lost on ABC every Wednsday at 8:00pm (central time). 
And, of course, you're listening to The Chart, on KCRW."

"event","Hello all, Andrew here and you're listening to The Chart on KCRW...

Okay, let me start by saying this...  Um, what the fuck is up with all this modern day technology?  It's like, if I want to know the barometric pressure in Abu-fucking-Dhabi, then <b>BAM!</b> I get on the internet and <i>voila!</i>  The barometric pressure in Abu-fucking-Dhabi!  If I get a whim on, say, a theory about LOST, then <b>BAM!</b>, I whip out my cell and call Mary (because that's just how I roll).

If I want to purchase and watch a DVD from England...  Sorry sport, you're shit out of luck.  Um, excuse me?  I am willing to pay <b>MY</b> <i>hard earned</i> money to purchase this damn DVD set and here to find out it's not even going to play in my damn DVD player?!  All together now... what.  the.  fuck?!

For those of you who are wondering, the DVD Set I am talking about is the ""Round the Twist: Completely Round the Twist"" boxed set, which is the complete series of ""Round the Twist"", which (for everyone except the three of you who remember this show) aired on FOX back in the day with Goosebumps and Eerie, Indiana.  I've been looking for it for awhile, and then I finally find a Region 0 DVD (Which is a whole nother story in itself) and then, oops- its a PAL format, not an NTSC.  Sorry sport, you are once again up the creek without a paddle.  Pardon me while I play the world's saddest song on the world's smallest violin for you.

What I'm saying is this- in this technological age, why all the technological division?  If I want to watch a DVD from England, then I should be able to buy it, put it in my American DVD player, push play and (here's the kicker) it should (get this...) <b>WORK</b>.  Damnit.

Alright, I'm off to Google some more DVD players to find out if its sensical for me to buy this DVD set.  By the way, 'sensical' is your made up word of the week.  I expect it to be used in a sentence at least once.

"event","Hello, this is Mary, and you're listening to The Chart, on KCRW.

Today, my segment will be about education. Randomn, I know, but that's whats on my mind today in the world of interconnectivity.

I'll start by saying: I blame the Catholics... yes, I am Catholic by birth, and mostly by nature, but not strictly by beliefs, so I blame the REAL Catholics.

Elementry school: do we recall having ONE teacher for 7 subjects? Is it really possible for one person to know enough about 7 different subjects to validly teach it to a group of 30 young-ins? Really... is it?

Middle School: Oh. My. Gosh. How cool is it that we get 3... yes THREE teachers?! Dude... like sweet! Yet the annoying amount of cliques and childish drama (that will stick with us for the rest of our lives, mind you) damage the kiddies for life... I really think that THAT is what creates the homosexuals of the world... hmm... anyway, then you are seperated into different groups for the same subjects: the smart kids, and the dumb kids. Agian, damage.

Highschool: some of you continue on to Catholic highschools, and then some of us broke free of the chains and went to PUBLIC HIGHSCHOOL, and oh, it was SO scadalous! We were shunned, scolded, and exercised (Hillary Faye style). Again, leaving the words ""you're dumb"" tattooed on our brains for life. And those habits you were of saposed to have gotten into in Middle School, you know, the ones where you do your homework? Yeah, they don't exisit. And you don't pay for this secular Satin school, so honestly, you can get in under the wire, pass every subject and graduate without ever doing any homework... and ya know, improove those study habits to prepare you for college, because that is what highschool is really for. 
Then you take the ACT, and all of those classes you've taken through out highschool have improoved your knowledge, so you can hope you will score high on this test *clears throat*. 
Ah, then it's time to apply to Colleges. You ask yourself this single question: which schools am I dumb enough to get into? And you think of one answer: Community. College. 
Then you graduate, and it's the most joyous moment in your parents lives. Of course, when they call your name, that's all they say. And, of course, that person in front of you is the one who was ""Valedictorian, 4.0 over-all average, recipiant of the $150,000,000 George Washinton scholarship, Stuco secratary, captian of the swim team, President of the drama club, and continuing on to Harvard University, and taking extra credit classes at Yale for a triple major in Bio-Physics, English, and Painting""... 
then it's your turn. They say your name.
There is an eruption of applause from where you know your family is sitting. Then they say:
""continuing on to Community. College.""

College: So you have some kick-ass study habbit from that high school you went to that ranks 4th in MAP Test results in the state, right? Well, you know you're gonna do just FABULOUS in college. 
You do your homework... sometimes... when you feel like it... when The L Word, Lost, ER, Gilmore Girls, Crossing Jordan, American Idol, Friends, Everybody Loves Raymond, Sex and the City or Will and Grace aren't on. And you get through your first semester, and only fail one class, and get through with a 2.7 GPA: SCORE! 
Then the second semster comes along, and honestly, you're feeling a little more motivated, and little more pumped, but then theres that boring ass class that you hate that you're taking for the second time, and you SWEAR you're gonna pass it this semester... yeah, not so much. You will have to take it for a third time. Next. Semster. But hey, you made it through with a 3.1 this time, and you only turned 3 papers in late... okay, maybe 4, and you only skipped class 4, maybe 5 times... actually it was 6 times. 
You feel like a complete loser, slacker, failure, freak, and you know that those will be the only initials behind your name when you graduate with your assoicates degree: Your Name Here, L.S.S.F.

Sometimes you ask yourself why... why am I like this? Why can't I study? Why am I dumb? 
And I say to you, you're wonderful just the way you are! You COULD have been able to study! You're not dumb! It's because you have bad study habits. Yes you do... yes you do... quit arguing with me! And you know why you have bad study habits? Because you went to Catholic school when you were young. I swear, that's why. But now it's time to quit being so passive about your education. Over come the Catholic curse! YOU CAN DO IT!

Now to sumarize: 
Catholic Middle School--Catholic Elementy School--Public Highschool--Community College--*feeling of complete failure*--Success

That concludes my segment for today. 
On my next segment: how did you become your friend's door mat? How are you such a great person when your friend/s is/are such (an) asshole/s? Tune in to find out.

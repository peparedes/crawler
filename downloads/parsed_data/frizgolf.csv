"event","Had a good weekend last week. The annual trip to Columbia, MO. Played disc golf in a division with six other guys (amateur grandmaster) and won it. Got a nice booty of stuff and another plaque to hang somewhere. Made some more friends.
Got home and checked Facebook. There was a message out of the blue from a friend of a friend. It seems she'd looked up my info after seeing a random reply I'd made in said friend's post the week before. The message was simply ""frisbee golf!""
Added her as a friend and bantered back and forth a bit. I asked the other day if she wanted to go throw a few today. We were due to meet up at 4:00, but I got a message earlier that she couldn't make it.
Last weekend I met the gf of one of the tournament directors and we hit it off pretty good. She said their first date was disc golf. She friended me on FB, and when I saw the other random message out of the blue from aforementioned friend of friend, I kinda thought ""deja vu.""
Didn't put a lot of hope into it or anything. I hope she's okay. But it was a kinda weird coincidence. It's kinda strange and cool at the same time- being able to meet one person online, then have a friend of hers contact me out of the blue online. The internet is a weird place.
Hope we can get together soon and fly some plastic.
Meantime, I at least got a couple new interesting internet friends."

"event","It's been a minute, eh LJ?
I've been wanting to post an update for eons, but nothing much has been happening. Just work, gym, sleep. ZZzzz.
Oh, that's a lie. :)
I don't think I've posted an entry yet this year. Nothing to say. I think I'm getting old or something. I haven't been to a show in ages, haven't played disc golf since last fall, and the weekly Beer Hero gatherings with the woxy board folks are getting fewer and farther between. What was a flurry of social activity for about five years has slowed down to just about nothing. Without the station around any more, the woxy message boards are slowly dying. No new music filter. The music's there; it just isn't the shared experience any more. I'm starting to find out I don't have as much in common with the woxy folks as I thought I did. We'd get together and we'd talk about message board memes or local gigs or music in general. With the station out of the picture, the glue holding everyone together seems, at least to me, to be losing its hold.
I kinda lost interest in disc golf. Still like playing, just not involved much more in the local scene. I don't play tournaments any more, and haven't been on the local club's message board since last fall. Haven't been to any of the club meetings since last summer.
I dunno, it feels like when woxy went under I lost my social mojo. That message board and the activity around and within it drove me to explore new stuff. Now it's gone, and I feel like I'm regressing.
Now this is where you tell me to get out there and make myself available. Except I've always been a little socially awkward, and fear makes me change my mind every time a Facebook invite makes me answer with a ""yes"" or ""maybe"", and I wind up making excuses to stay in. The comfy recliner beckons and I find myself asleep before midnight. I have trouble staying out late these days, even on weekends.
Work is going well. There are two people in my department who will retire within the next year, so there may be an opportunity for a supervisory position opening up. Trouble is, I don't want to manage people at all. If managing people was my thing, I'd have taken the parts department manager's position offered to me in 1988 and never have gone back to school in the first place. I wanted to learn a trade and be a production grunt. Gimme an inbox and turn me loose, and I'm happy.
There's one thing at work that's eating at me. I like her a lot, but the woman in our department who used to sit on the front desk is now in the cubicle next to me (presumably so she could help us with our drawing/editing work) but she still has her phone duties from her old front desk position. So she's on the phone ALL DAY. This brings two problems: one, she gets five times as many personal calls (friends and family) than work calls, and I know every detail about her personal life from overhearing every gossipy detail. Two, the type of editing work we do does not jibe well with being interrupted, and coupled with the fact she's retiring this fall, she really has no incentive (nor time) to learn what we need her to be doing to help. I think the office manager just wanted to keep her close under his nose so she would cut back on friends visiting. He certainly hasn't kept her from receiving personal phone calls overandover all day. Plus, my immediate supervisor (not the office manager) sits in the same cubicle with her, and when she's not on the phone, they talk endlessly about everything under the sun except work. I have taken to wearing headphones all day to drown them out just so I can get some work done. (The supervisor in the next cubicle is the other one retiring; he is set to retire next February.) So, two people who see the light at the end of the tunnel apparently have no problem bullshitting away their entire last year together. He often comments on her personal phone conversations when she hangs up, tacitly giving his approval for her time-wasting ways. As someone who spent most of my working life busting ass to make a buck, it drives me nuts to see two people who have no concept of ever having a chance of having their job be at risk for not working and making the company profit. Of course, working for the local government, profit is not a motive. Tenure speaks. It's the one thing I absolutely abhor about every entitled tenured employee in the whole government building. There is zero perspective as to the plight of the thousands of unemployed workers out there, since there is no chance they could be fired and replaced with someone willing to put their nose to the grindstone.
That right there is another reason I don't want to manage anyone in that office. I have a work ethic, and I would definitely step on people's toes by demanding results. No, I'd rather finish the project that was started years before I came on board by doing what I've learned these past seven+ years. To manage people, I would be subject to constant interruptions, and I'd have to train new people to do what I've been doing. I don't like training. I think I'd be good at it, but I'd rather do the work myself. That, coupled with learning any new software while training, would slow actual work done to a crawl.
So, yeah, since I found out their projected retirement dates, I've been spending my time worrying about what the work environment will be like a year from now. Not sleeping well, not socializing, not playing golf tournaments or staying involved with the local disc golf and music scenes. I've been obsessing with what is slowly becoming a toxic work environment (at least for me) rather than focusing on my life outside it. 
Oh, and my supervisor at work? He's a disc golfer, too. About a year and a half ago we were approached to help the county parks department on a redesign for an old local disc golf course. We worked together on some maps and walked the grounds at the old course, and submitted redesign ideas. We met with park personnel a few times and discussed our thoughts and ideas, submitted our designs, and waited for response. They went quiet for a long time (about nine months). Last September, the park people got in touch with my supervisor, and told him in an email they needed an updated design after they finally got tentative approval for the idea of a redesign. He didn't tell me a thing about the new contact for about a month, when he suddenly came to me for help for a course design. ""Oh, I'm sorry, I thought I had you CC'd on the email. Here, I'll send you a copy of our conversation."" It turned out he had submitted his design without my input, and they needed it to be redrawn. Only when he hit a wall did he come back to me for help. (This is a pattern the local disc golfers are familiar with- he had enlisted help in designing another course some years ago in Northern Kentucky and alienated some co-designers in much the same way.) He has a martyr complex, and loves to talk about all the problems he faced with that design, problems he could have avoided with better communication.
He kept bugging me for my ""design"". I have one, and if he asks the right way I'll give it to him. At this point, in my mind, he's on his own. He's gonna have to chew what he bit off.
So I guess that's it in a nutshell. Work itself couldn't be easier. But I'm having problems with an uncommunicative supervisor (the disc golf problems are a microcosm of work communication- we are supposed to be getting new software at work, but I get the distinct feeling he's kicking the whole idea of a new system down the road until he retires). He has good reason to be distracted: his wife is going through skin cancer treatments (yet another reason I so want to kick cancer's ass), and his hatred of all things Modern Medicine is scrambling his brain. He's somewhat of a snake-oil practitioner, always suggesting natural remedies for everything modern medicine has otherwise proven to work. That's an entry entirely unto itself, and this one is long enough, so I'll spare you.
So the work itself is a breeze. But I see tenure politics (and laziness) blocking progress there. My disc golf interest has reached a new low, and it's most probably due to this course redesign issue. And woxy is no more, sapping what was a high point in my life these last five years or so. The combination of a great music station, promise of new software at work, and the high of redesigning a much-loved albeit outdated disc golf course, all crashing to shit in the last year have brought out a severe case of ennui. Maybe that's why I haven't been sleeping well."

"event","It don't happen much any more, this here LiveJournal thingy. I guess I have a purpose for it. It seems all the other social media came and went and came again. But every once in a while I just gotta vent.
So it's taken about three weeks to completely cycle through that last cold. It wasn't even a bad one, just your garden-variety cough/sneeze/runny nose thing, but the after effects went on forever. In the past, a mild cold like that would have been done in a week. The worst part of it was done two weeks ago and I still have that cough thing fading away.
The best thing about that cold was that I slept like the dead. Now that I'm over it, it seems I'm back to normal. Light sleep again last night/this morning.
Last night I'd just dropped off to sleep when my roommate got on the phone. I guess he talks to his mom every night. What he talks about for an hour that he didn't just talk to her last night about for an hour, I don't know, but, hey, at least he talks to her. For whatever reason, though, he didn't sit out in the recliner two walls away like usual. He was blaring away into that phone (he sounds like a trombone when he talks- it's really kinda funny) right outside the bedroom door. I poked my head out and chased him off, but he came right back and sat at the dining room table. I had to go out and chase him away again, but by this time it was too late. Once the adrenaline flows, it takes a while to get back to sleep.
Normally I don't mind him getting home right as I go to sleep, because he's usually quiet as a mouse. But last night for whatever reason, he felt the need to, I dunno, be loud. He's an attention whore that way some times, but he usually doesn't wake me up. I think the old boy may be getting senile.
But then, maybe I am too. The older I get the lighter I sleep. It takes longer to get over colds or recover from hard workouts or injuries. And this increasing insomnia is making me crazy. I finally got back to sleep last night, only to be awakened again to the sound of dueling bedsprings at 3:30 A.M. from the apartment next door. I'm no friggin prude, but, c'mon, 3:30 in the morning? STFU! So now I'm wide awake with about 3 1/2 hours sleep under my belt. Dammit, I was gonna start going back to the gym tonight.
I'm looking for another apartment. Not that there's really any particular thing wrong with this place that I wouldn't find similarly wrong with any other place (it has its pluses and minuses), but I think it's just time for a change. I'd like a garage, I want to go it alone, and I want to get closer to work.
Gawd, I hate moving."

Some of those early LJ entries show just how scared I was back then. I had really no idea what to do to get a date. I somehow got a few.
Now that I've gotten over that fear, I find myself not even wanting to look any more.
What the heck happened? I thought once I'd primed the pump, so to speak, that it would flow more easily. Now I ain't even thirsty.
What the heck? The ladies get my attention just as much as always. There are plenty things to do. Lots of opportunities. I'm never lacking for chances. I just don't care to bother.
Have I become comfortable being single? Am I afraid to let someone invade my personal space? Am I lazy?
What do I need to do to get interested again?"

"event","Every once in a while I get this fear I'm gonna chase all my friends away. Not all of 'em, I guess, but mostly the new ones I've made here on the interwebs.
I was always moving and changing schools when growing up, so I guess I kinda got used to becoming detached from friends. It almost became a habit. You know how you have those friends you haven't seen for years, and you can pick right up and talk to 'em like the last time you saw 'em was yesterday? I have very few, maybe two or three like that.
Some times my irrational streak comes to the surface, and I'm afraid my bull-in-the-china-shop attitude comes out without me even knowing it. I'm a first child spoiled brat, and I guess I want things now, dammit, no matter whose feet I step on to get 'em. I'm kinda scared, especially with the way the internet works (what with not seeing facial expressions and hearing voice inflections) that I'll gradually snip away my new friends one-by-one with my brattitude and my old habit of being able to give up on friends who don't give me constant attention (or who simply fall by the wayside).
It's been a while since I've been here on LJ, and I feel like I'm neglecting new-found friendships. I'm sorry, it's an old habit. I'm becoming aware I really don't know how to make new friends that well. I guess I'm always scared they'll just up and disappear, so I often don't even make the initial effort to get to know people other than small talk.
It's kinda selfish, innit? I mean, since I guess I got used to friends disappearing when I was a kid, I kinda expect new friends to show a deeper immediate interest in me right off the bat, or I just don't take the time for 'em. It seems cold, but I kinda see myself doing that nowadays."

"event","The desire was there a couple years back. I got motivated to put myself back out there, but I got spooked back into my shell. I no longer feel the desire to go out on the hunt like all the other wolves do. Apparently the hunt is part of the game. A person has to feel wanted, and the silly dating game is all there is. I hate it.
I dunno. Maybe it was that one relationship from long ago. I gave up even wanting to chase women way back. Kinda thought we'd wind up married. Didn't expect to be forgotten so easily.
It ain't that I don't like women. It would be nice to have a friend, someone to talk to, and shit, some sex would be nice, too. But the longer I go without the easier it gets. I wonder whether I'd even put up with another person in my life all day every day at this age. I'm used to being a lazy slob and playing disc golf whenever I feel like it. Plus, I'm not sure anyone would put up with what it would take to make me think otherwise.
I kinda thought the right one would bump into me some day, like me for who I am, and that would be it. Now I doubt that will happen.
Now I just prefer to do without. It wasn't a conscious decision; it just played out that way."

"event","The one thing that has held value for me during this recession is my 1969 Malibu convertible. Last time I checked, its value had risen once again. It's never gone down the entire time I've owned it.
I keep it in a storage garage out in the suburbs. Costs $100 a month for rental. But that keeps it out of the weather. I once owned a '69 Camaro and let it sit outside all its years. It slowly deteriorated. When I got it in 1982, the interior was perfect. When I sold it in '03, every piece of plastic in the interior was faded or cracked from sitting in the sun. Plus, there was rust and faded paint. So, to me, the storage is worth it, even though I'll never recoup that cost.
I finally got the convertible out of mothballs this weekend. It hadn't been driven anywhere but around the block by the storage garage since '08. There were a couple nitpick items that kept me from driving it last year. I had the insurance downgraded late in '08 when I put it away for the fall, and it stayed in storage all last year. I finally decided to get after it this year. When it warmed up this January, I replaced the brakes and tried to fix the oil leak on the valve covers on the engine. The brake job went well, but the leak persisted. 
Last week I decided to order some new valve covers. After paying for the special order in advance, on a whim I went out to the garage to try something. There's a PCV valve in the valve cover, and I pulled it out to see if it was stuck. Sprayed a little solution in it and freed it up. Guess what? No more leak. I had spent much time and money on gaskets and sealer- every time to no avail. I don't know what made me think of the PCV... something from my memory banks from working in the auto business all those years kicked in. It's a simple little part. The PCV allows engine fumes to be recycled and used to burn off in the carburetor. If those fumes can't pass through the PCV, they force their way out somewhere else. Pressure was building up and escaping through the valve cover.
So I had to go back to the parts store and explain that I'd fixed it already and no longer needed the special-order valve covers. Too late. They already had them in. To their credit, they gave me a refund, but I had to pay for return shipping. I was okay with that. By eating $10 in shipping, I at least got the $110 back.
Now the car no longer leaks. The brakes work great. I got the chrome all shined up yesterday, and today I need to clean the windows and wax the paint job, plus fix a few lights that are burnt out.
Yes, folks, when times are down, invest in precious metal. Just need to keep after it.
That's okay, though. I like to tinker."

"event","Honestly, I wouldn't recognize an air raid siren if I heard it. In this county, I suppose it's the same as the one they use for bad weather warnings. It's changed in the recent past (recent being the last decade or so).
I can remember the tornado outbreak of 1974. The area was caught off-guard when a series of fast-moving storms devastated a large swath of the Midwest. Afterward sirens were upgraded, and tests were carried out once a month.
The tests have increased to twice a month and warnings are now more frequent. From the 70s up until about the turn of this century a siren that sounded for three minutes meant a tornado had been sighted. Early on, the sirens were sounded only in the projected path of the storm, but then they started sounding the warning for the entire county when one was sighted anywhere within the county. Nowadays, at least for the last decade or so, sirens are now sounded for severe thunderstorm warnings, that is, for storms that have a possibility of producing high winds and/or large hail. 
The trouble I have with this system is akin to the old fable The Boy Who Cried Wolf. The sirens now go off so often that no one pays them much attention any more. I can recall a spring storm a couple years ago where the warning sirens went off downtown while I was at work. They are routinely tested every 1st and 3rd Wednesday at noon (which would be an excellent time to stage a bombing run over the county, as no one would notice until it's too late), but this was neither Wednesday nor noon. This was my first experience hearing warning sirens in an office building while working on the 7th floor so far from a basement. What struck me was not so much the severity (or lack of, as it turned out) of the storm, but the complete silence with which office personnel reacted. Not one person in management position made any move nor said a word about this shrill intrusion upon our ears. One supervisor had headphones on listening to music. He acknowledged the warning with a shrug, and went right back to his music!

All that being said, I heard what I thought was a siren at about 2:30 this morning. I was either awake from my allergies when I heard it, or it had sounded once before and this second blast woke me up.
As it turns out, there was no siren. I live about a mile from the nearest weather/fire siren, and this noise was much closer. What I heard after I woke up went away after about a minute, so at first I thought it was a fire department call. Then it started again, and stayed on. Concerned, I called police dispatch and asked whether there was a weather alert (after I checked the sky and weather.com and found nothing but clear skies). The dispatcher asked where I was located, and after I told her she said she'd gotten several calls about it. She said it was a street sweeper. She seemed quite unmoved by my concern, and told me I could get in touch with the local township come Monday.
The trouble was, after the phone call the sound never moved away. If one is sweeping a street, wouldn't one also move along said street? This shrill, obtrusive noise which didn't waver was now an obsession. I had to know what it was. I got up, put on shoes, shorts, and a sweatshirt and drove off to track down this noise myself.
Upon my travels I noticed that yes, the main drag Colerain Avenue, had indeed been cleaned. But the street sweeper had moved on. Nowhere in sight. But the noise persisted.
Disclosure here: I live next door to a state highway. It's an expressway much like an interstate. The x-way interchanges with Colerain Avenue right out that way *points* about a thousand feet away. There are a couple large parking lots for shopping centers across the way, and they both slope down toward the north and east, effectively deflecting sound my way. 
While out investigating (you know when you hear a bump in the night- you can't get back to sleep until you know what it is) I saw yet another sweeper in the parking lot of the grocery store across the expressway. It is a vacuum with a huge attachment off the back, which is driven around the lot to pick up stray trash.
I'm sure I've heard this many times before and slept through it, but for some reason this morning was different. Perhaps the vacuum is in need of repair. Maybe my allergies are really acting up. Either way, for whatever reason, I was startled quite wide awake when I heard this shrill sound I thought was a weather warning siren. Once startled awake, I am up for good, so here I am at 5:00 A.M.
I plan to contact the grocery store about it and mention the similarity to the sound of the weather warning. I also plan to look into the township's noise ordinance. There is simply no way it's legal to put out that level of decibels at 2:30 in the morning."

I still don't know how short I'm gonna have it cut. I'd like to donate regularly, but there's that period where it hangs in my eyes that drives me nuts.

I made an appointment with an orthodontist later this month to look into getting my teeth straightened. They're in good shape, but they've been crooked since my wisdom teeth came in. (Those never gave me trouble. They came in painlessly, and also too late for my dad's insurance to cover removal.) I'm excited at the prospect of having straight teeth. I've been putting it off too long."

"event","Every ten days or so I have the type of mid-morning wake-up where I can't get back to sleep.
Oh, I wake up mid-morning all the time, but usually I just roll over and go back to sleep. Some times I don't wake. But I always roll over. I know. My covers are a mess.
The reason I roll over: breathing. I know I snore. I wake up with the tell-tale sore throat, but that goes away.
I'm mouth-breathing. When I roll over, I'm okay if I clear up and can breathe through the nose. I'm also fine if it clogs completely. It's when it only clears partway that I can't get back to sleep.
I once spent a week in Key West. Upon awakening the second day, I noticed something. I was breathing freely, like never before. It was as if I'd been reborn with a real breathing system.
Cincinnati sits in a huge basin. Moisture gathers and stays. Mold, mildew, and various pollens thrive. I suspect there are many areas like this in the country/world. Key West is an island. Flat. Sea-air wind-blown. Yes, it's surrounded by moisture, but it's not taking hold and staying in place in the form of mold. Pollen blows out to sea. I may well move there when I retire, if I live that long. I dunno, with my luck I'd probably develop allergies there.
I've been keeping an eye out for a new apartment. An ideal place would have radiant heat, wall unit air conditioners, and hardwood floors. I'd like to eliminate carpet and indoor duct work from my home life. But that still does nothing for all the non-native plants people like to put in their yards for show."

"event","There was a time a couple years back I'd post my every thought on LJ. I realize I've been silent of late. 
I used to lament my datelessness and wonder whether I'd ever find the one. Now that I've shaken that fear, having had a few meaningful friends, I find myself ambivalent. I'm not so anxious any more to find anyone, much less THE one. 
I reckon it's because I invested too much thought into the ones I dated, rather than just enjoying each other for company's sake. Now I either don't want to invest the time in something that won't be more than just friends or I just plain got used to being single and lazy, and don't want to let anyone else in.
The desire was there just a couple years ago. Now it's faded. I hardly go out. I rarely see shows. I hang with the same friends occasionally (terrific people, all). 
But I don't like bars.
Can't figure it out. I thought once I broke the ice I'd be ready to take on all comers, but now I just want to sit home or go to the gym. I kinda liked getting out for a while, but it always winds up the same: straight home alone after a show or leaving the bar early, that is if I even go out at all.
I'm thinking I've always hung out at the wrong places to meet people- bars or concerts. You can't talk at a concert, and I rarely go to bars unless there is music there, so that's kinda the same thing.
Any ideas on how to get out, keep busy, meet people, and avoid noisy venues?"

If I have one more itch, one more sniffle, one more fucking night tossing and turning trying to find just the right position to mouth-breathe so I can fall asleep, I'm abandoning the whole mess and moving the fuck out.
Something in this environment is slowly killing me. It seems I'm allergic to fucking air.
I hate Colerain Avenue. I hate this obviously mold/pollen-infested apartment. And tonight, just as I finally dropped off to sleep, my roommate decides to get on the phone with, I guess, his mom at 11:00 and talk, loudly I might add, just outside my bedroom door. I dunno, I guess that's the best place in the goddamn apartment he can get reception on the portable phone or something.
Don't get me wrong, it's not that I disapprove of him calling his mom every night after work, but one, he never sat anywhere but the living room out of hearing range before. Two, she's hard of hearing, and three, he has a speech impediment making him hard to understand, so the combination of the last two make for relative shouting when he speaks.
I like the guy. Helluva roommate. But the time has come. Goddammit, I feel imprisoned here. I almost feel like I'm supporting him. He pays his way, on time, but he's getting old faster than I am (always sick or injured), and he has a low-paying shit job he has zero aspiration for climbing above. I'm afraid what will become of him should he have to look for another roomie, but at this point I don't care. If he doesn't want to improve, he's not gonna drag me down.
Jesus, reading that makes me look selfish. But this arrangement, the apartment, the mold and/or the pollen that's been spewing from the tree five feet from the central air system's intake are slowly killing me. I can't breathe, physically and metaphorically."

"event","Why am I single?
Because I'm used to it. 
I've opined here before that I don't want to die alone. That's inevitable. We all die alone. I just don't want to die lonesome.
No, it occurs to me that I've been single so long because I got used to coming home whenever I pleased and cleaning only when the dirt physically threatened me. I went out every night for years and completely rejected all things female because of one stormy relationship. The bottle became my buddy.
Well, the bottle got kicked to the curb for 17 years. Yeah, now I drink again, but it ain't the pacifier I let it become once before. It was once a crutch, an excuse.
But what I'm finding out now is that any hint of trouble or drama sends me running, probably out of habit more than anything.
Yeah, I don't want to be lonesome, but I gotta learn to share a little more of myself. That cocoon was too comforting for too long. I've become good at listening, but I'm having trouble finding anyone who will listen. Maybe the problem is that I just don't recognize when someone is listening.
Have I rejected friendships subconsciously because I perceived listening as nosiness? Is this trouble or drama I perceive nothing more than interest I became habitually adept at rejecting?
Stay tuned. I'm < 4 years from coming out of my social isolation. Still just getting the hang of it.
I don't want that cocoon any more."

After last week became the third straight Monday morning of waking for seemingly no reason, I began to suspect outside forces. A noise. A car horn in the parking lot. An alarm in an adjoining apartment. All guesses. I have not been able to pinpoint it.
This morning I awoke. 1:30 A.M. I got up to use the rest room, and I could see that the lights from the living room/kitchen were still streaming in through the space under the door to my bedroom. In the minute I was in the rest room, the lights went out, and my roommate's bedroom was dark.
See, my roomie works second shift. He gets home after 10:00, and his cool-down time is afterward. I never have problems with this, as I usually go to bed around 9:30. I'm not always asleep when he gets home, but we usually respect each other by being quiet, I while getting up in the morning, and he when getting home at night. It works out well.
But now I've grown suspicious. The speed with which he turned out the lights and went quiet and dark is not like him. But then, maybe it was just coincidence. Maybe it was time to crash, and crash now, just at the precise moment I got up to use the rest room. Maybe I'm imagining he's up to no good and was afraid I'd catch him at it when he heard me get up.
But if he's the reason I'm waking every Monday morning, I'm gonna find that Frankenstein monster he's building and destroy it before it menaces mankind like it's already menacing me."

"event","Last night's fireworks show was awesome as usual.
I don't know how they do it, but Rozzi's Fireworks keep coming up with new stuff. Every year I think to myself ""how are they gonna change it up this year?""
Maybe it's the synchrony with the music track. Maybe it's the knowledge that it's the last big festival of the summer. I dunno how they do it, but last night they wowed me. They shot more stuff off the bridges this year than they ever have. At times, with a wall of fireworks on three sides in front of us, it felt like being in a room full of fireworks. Like the station or not, when they shoot off fireworks that spell out WEBN, it's cool as hell.
Speaking of WEBN, the riverfront fireworks started in 1977 as a 10-year birthday party for a station that, at the time, was a hip free-form station (albeit already in the throes of the beginnings of corporate ownership in the 70s) much like what WOXY is now. The station decided to tow a barge up the river and set off fireworks in front of the Serpentine Wall in Cincinnati. They supposedly were expecting a few thousand people, and were surprised to have upwards of 50K show up. It has grown to include both sides of the river, and estimates every year put the head count around 500K nowadays. When the bright flashes illuminate the riverbanks and surrounding hillsides, I tend to think that number could be low. It's just a sea of humanity.
The early years were something of a free-for-all in the crowds. I like to compare it to a mini-Woodstock (to read the reviews of that concert) in that a sea of people descended on the park to have fun, get stoned, and watch things get loud. Folks climbed the flagpoles. They jumped off the bridges into the river. There were jugs of electric kool-aid. There was a people-toss, where 20 or so folks took turns holding a canvas tarp, counting to three, and tossing the next turn-taker as high into the air as possible. There was a group who brought little red wagons carrying kegs, stereos, and car batteries. Everyone staked out their area on the lawn with a blanket. The first year, a train stopped on the tracks (now inactive) that line the riverfront park, and 50,000 people had to crawl under or through the train cars to get out. :D 
We got along well until the mid-80s when the redneck mullet contingent started wrecking things in alcoholic stupor, resulting in the banishment of alcohol from the fest. The crowds thinned a few years, but they're back to full strength, and everything seems relatively peaceful again. Of course, with crowds that size, there will be isolated incidents, but overall things run much more smoothly now.
What a great end to the summer festival season."

"event","The golf course can be a place to get away and walk off thoughts. Some times, like the last two times I played, the game itself can be thought-inducing.
The other night I played a course that's relatively wide open, at least for this area. Harbin Park's course in Fairfield is basically up, along, and back down a couple wide open hills with a smattering of trees. I started on the back nine, and six of my first nine holes had approach shots from beside, inside, or behind trees- the very few that are there.
I played Mt. Airy today, as a good tree-lined course will narrow my focus. Didn't help. Along about the fourth hole, my knee decided to buckle for no good reason. It gives no warning. It doesn't hurt nor is it injured. It just goes.
So I started to think about ballplayers and I realized why they suddenly decide to hang up the gloves, pads, or sneakers. One day you wake up and the body just refuses to work, at least consistently.
I know why golf is so popular. Every round is a microcosm of daily life. If something happens that undermines your confidence, you either learn to deal or things snowball. When the physical part starts to degrade, it means the mental part must pick up. I learned a lot about golf and life many years ago by reading a sports psychology book: Mental Toughness Training For Sports by Jim Lohr. You learn to keep track of your mental state as you play by tracking several statements on a written list immediately after playing, rating how you felt while playing on a scale of 1 to 5.
This checklist approach became second nature after a while, and helped me greatly when I went back to school. Golf as an analogy for life is not a stretch.
So I learned something the last two times out on the golf course. As I age and still want to play, I will have to work more on the mental game. Also, this aging thing affects life in general. I'm becoming forgetful. The hair's getting grayer, the teeth more crooked, and the belly bigger. The mental game has to be honed in life as well. I'm no spring chicken, and to stay ahead of the decline, the brain has to be exercised.
Dang it, now I want to play again."

"event","72 and sunny today. I had to go out and get some of this day all over me.
Played Mt. Airy and shot a 60. Rather respectable considering my knees and my elbow have been acting up. Caught up with a couple who were playing in front of me while they were looking for a lost disc. I found his after he found an orphan disc someone else had long ago given up on. I played along with them for the last seven holes after that. She had been throwing one of his discs up to that point (and doing quite well with it) and I suggested she try the one he found. She immediately started throwing straighter. I think I just introduced a casual golfer to the nuances of differing disc types."

"event","Where am I? Whoa, what a dream. Or was it, is it still...? Last thing I remember, let's see, uh, yeah. My bike. I was in 10th gear with my brother chasing me. <br />No, wait. The dream. Last thing I remember was...<br />Shit, I'm confused. I gotta meet friends for disc golf tomorrow. Disc golf? Why does it seem like I made that up?<br /><br />&quot;Mom, what happened?&quot;<br />&quot;Oh, Russ, you took a bad hit on the head. We thought you wouldn't make it.&quot;<br />&quot;Yeah, I remember waking up and passing out a bunch of times in the ambulance. But, wait, why was I riding my bike? And..., geesh, Mom, Ron is, was, is only like eight years old. What, where, how...&quot;<br />&quot;There, there, you probably had some hallucinations or something. You took a good hit. I'm so glad you woke up!&quot;<br />How could that be? I remember Ron chasing me like it was 20 minutes ago. Wait, it was 20 minutes ago, I guess. I mean, I'm in the hospital, on a stretcher, and I remember fuzzy bits and pieces of the ambulance ride. Let's see, I was in 10th gear. I cut through the corner lot. There was a paper drive truck parked there. Then what? Oh, the driveway; the cut-through to St. Ann's church. There was a, what..., a car? It had to be. I hit the car, didn't I? I couldn't see him. So, accounting for the time I had to be down, and waiting for the ambulance, yeah, 20 minutes. Ow! My head! Man, I never had such problems with numbers or simple calculations give me a headache like that. Okay, so time doesn't matter. But I was just riding my bike. Why didn't I drive? And why was I going back home to my house on Jackies? My parents moved out of there 20 years ago. And Ron, why is, was, is he only 8? And my mom. Geesh, she looks younger than me.<br /><br />&quot;Mom?&quot; <br />Why is my voice so high? Is it cracking? Yeah, that's right, it just started doing that last year with the whole puberty thing.<br />Puberty? Voice cracking? Bike?<br />&quot;Mom? What, who, how did you get so young?&quot;<br />&quot;That's a strange thing for you to say, Russ, but thanks! Maybe I'll like these side effects if I could just get the doctor... NURSE!&quot;<br />&quot;Mom! They're busy. Can't you see all these stretchers out here in the hall? I'm not bleeding or anything, so they'll get to me soon enough.&quot;<br />That sounded remarkably strange and mature to me for a kid of 14. I was calming my mom down.<br />But, the dream. Was it? I'm 52, I'm not 14, right? Was it a dream? Now wait, I just figured out how long I was out. I hit my head. I could imagine a lot with a proper hit, right? Why am I being so analytical? In 14 years all I've ever done is ace science and math tests, ride bikes, and build models. Now I'm using the other side of my brain? How is it a 14 year old knows all this left/right brain stuff? Am I really..., did I dream..., I mean, I'm 52, not 14. What the hell?<br />&quot;Mom, where is Ron's family? I mean, Denise, Rachel, Nick, Erik, you know, his wife and kids? Why, um, I mean, Mom, I'm confused. How is he 8? How am I 14? I celebrated every birthday for those kids. Now their father is younger than any of them? Mom, what happened?&quot;<br />&quot;Russ, You're scaring me. Try not to think about that.&quot; Now she was telling me to stay calm.<br /><br />Now, let's think. I have a disc golf get together tomorrow. I'm gonna drive down to Mt. Airy Forest and play with friends I know from the internet, friends from the message board of an online radio station.<br /><br />A station that doesn't exist. A game I've never heard of. The internet? Home computers more powerful than the ones running the NASA space program? And a car? Damn, I'm 14!<br /><br />&quot;Mom, can I go back to sleep?&quot;<br />&quot;No, the nurse gave you some stuff to keep you from passing out. They're afraid you may not come out of it. Try to stay awake, Russ.&quot;<br />&quot;But, Mom...&quot; I don't know what to say. Is this the dream? I mean, the 52 year old stuff, I remember all my experiences like I lived them all. Way more happened than what I remember in this 14 year old stuff. Yeah, I'm dreaming this hospital and the wreck again. I mean, the 52 year old me remembers the bike wreck 38 years ago. I had a concussion. They let me out of the hospital with just a headache and bruises. Dad had the bike fixed for only $13 and I was riding it the next week with its crooked front fork down the street with no hands. I remember the wreck scene. I was floating above it. I could see my brother racing up the street screaming. I remember Mr. Hagemann getting out of his blue '68 Corvair after I hit it. And Paul from the Tresler-Comet station was running over. I could see it all from above. Then I woke up in the ambulance the first time. <br />&quot;Mom?&quot; <br />&quot;I'm here.&quot; <br />Then out again. Then waking up again. And out. In and out for what seemed like 20 times during the three minute ride to the hospital.<br /><br />And then, the weirdness started happening. Was it just puberty? I started 10th grade shortly after that. My birthday is in July, so I'm always the smallest and youngest in class. Now, here I was in the Big School. Second year of high school, but in those days 7th through 9th grades were in another building. There were hundreds of kids in the Big School I didn't know. Half of us came from Colerain Junior High, and the other half from White Oak. And my voice was changing. And girls, well, they looked different. Made me feel funny. And my head was doing analytical things. I was thinking more about where I was in the world, what my purpose was. I didn't care as much for the science and math, although it still came to me like falling off a log.<br />The weirdness. The high school. Puberty. It was all in the past, right? But here I am in the hospital, 14 again. I just wrecked my bike. Again?<br /><br />&quot;Mom, I gotta tell you something. I think I had a dream. I mean, I know I had a dream, but it was so real. I lived 'til I was 52. Ron got married first, then Jan, then Ray, and then Mark. Jan got divorced and remarried. I never did. Dad died. You live in a condominium now.&quot;<br />&quot;Russ, just stay calm. The doctor's coming.&quot;<br />She wasn't listening. She was busy trying to convince herself the doctor was coming to me next. It doesn't matter, though, because this is the dream, right? I mean, I <em>did</em> live 52 years, didn't I? I've never dreamed anything like that. Dreams are spacey. They fade in and out and make no sense. My 52 years were real. Smells, sounds, feelings.<br />But this, this is real. I can feel this cold vinyl cot. I see the hallway full of stretchers. Why is this place so busy? I hear the sounds. They're not morphing and changing like dreams do. How did I get back to 14 again?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Continued...?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&copy;Frizgolf Press 2009 All rights reserved.<br />"

"event","It's no secret. It's been a while.
A long time ago, I made up my mind I wasn't gonna just Get Laid. I was gonna find the right girl and fall in love first.
I had a girlfriend. We were young. I thought it was love. Maybe my Catholic upbringing and the requisite guilt played a part during and after that relationship, but I vowed to not be the hound I saw my friends as being.
Trouble is, there was image. I played along. I always talked a good game. Can't look all ghey in front of my girl-hopping friends, right?
Oh, I used to take it as a compliment when folks would think I was just another wolf.
""You'd fuck that, right?""
""Oh, yeah, bend 'er over and horse-fuck her 'till my balls flapped off her stomach!""
""Hah, hah!""
""Hah, hah!""
*grabs beer in a manly way*
And so on for much too long.
I suppose I brought it upon myself by playing along out of fear of looking abnormal all these years as I hear it today. I'm 52 years old. I really don't give a fuck what people think of me any more, and when buddies give me that ol' familiar elbow and a wink when the voluptuous babe walks by, I know they expect ol' Russ to nod in approval. *wink* ""Yeah, buddy, I would, too"" is what they wanna hear.
Well, I'm sick of the facade. Maybe there's really something wrong with me, but, no I don't want to bend her over, ol' buddy. No, not just now. I really want to see her smile. I want to know what she's thinking. I like her shoes. Her hair. That dress. And if she smiles back at me and actually wants to talk to me, that gives me just as much of a thrill as any of those imaginary conquests of the past could ever muster in my mind.
Damn. Looking back, had I felt all along like I do now, I know I'd be ahead of the game and have no doubts. Young. Image-conscious. Afraid (homophobic?) of looking like less of a man should I admit I wanted to fall in love before ever having the audacity to show off my junk. Today, I don't care what people think. Fuck 'em.
And the next guy who elbows me in the ribs and says ""eh?"" when he catches me looking may well get a piece of my mind.
Blargh. I'm tired of being lumped in with all the cock hounds of the world. It makes me feel so... primitive."

"event","Yeah, hope. It's a strange wellspring of emotion, and it manifests weirdly.

So, yeah, a year and a half ago I gave up hope. Not once, but twice.
This year I found out that giving up on hope doesn't make it go away. Oh no. It comes back. With a vengeance.
So the hope built again from the ashes of the last time I'd trusted it. I wondered ""dare I trust it again?""

Well, like a fool I did. What kept it from crashing harder this time was the fact this cycle repeated. Yet another dashed hope from winter '07 reappeared. You'd think that right after re-trusting and re-losing an old dashed hope, that I'd resist it happening again, especially right on the heels of the last restored, previously-thought-to-be-forgotten hope.

See, that's the problem. I never had a chance to let go and curse away the previous restored hope when the next restored hope popped up.

Following this?
1. Met girl. Clicked amazingly. Too well.
2. Met another girl immediately after #1 left.
(I'll spare the rehash. Go back and read February & March '08 entries.)
3. Girl 2 contacted this spring. Date set. She cancels.
4. Girl 1 contacted after #2 cancels. Date set. She cancels.
Both times, last year and this spring, I barely had time to deal with hope bending me over and breaking it off when it was picked right back up and restored with the next opportunity.

Now the crash is gonna happen again, and I know what that felt like last year after the double whammy finally washed over me.

It's double again. Hope lost, picked right back up, and *crash* again.

This hope. What is it? Did I exorcise it last year, or is the fact it rekindled (twice) a precursor to a harder drop this time?"

"event","Disc golf today.
We were kinda afraid it would be too sloppy to play with all the rain we got yesterday, so we decided to head to Dayton and play Belmont today. On the way, we stopped at a drive-through joint to get a sandwich off the Route 73 exit of I-75. The road off 73 was called Sharts road. I giggled like a ninth grader. Heh, heh. Sharts. Who would put a restaurant on Sharts road?
The course was surprisingly dry. We chose Belmont because from past experience it's usually the easiest to play after rain. Good drainage and lots of grass. But the dirt was bone dry. Apparently Dayton was spared the wrath of the rain clouds.
Had a relatively good round. Gotta work on the putting. I threw my best shot of the day just screwing around. I'd already thrown a tee shot on the 18th hole, and with my bag on my shoulder I threw a second tee shot, a sidearm right to the pin. I should use that shot more often.
We topped it off by trying a Mexican place we'd never been to on 725 in Springboro called Las Piramides. Pretty good chow. Had chicken nachos and a Dos Equis dark lager. Mighty tasty finish to a good day. I sprung for the tab since my buddy always drives. He likes his air conditioner better than mine I guess.
Now I just gotta watch out for those sharts. :D"

"event","I'd heard it for years. ""Russ, when are you gonna buy something? You're throwing your money away renting!""
Well, I'm not so sure. The money I spend in rent would be easily covered in maintenance expenses on anything I may have bought. At the very least the taxes on a lot of homes come close to what I pay for rent. (I have a roommie.)
To paraphrase Mitch Hedberg, ""I went to Apartment Depot the other day. It's just an empty warehouse where we all stand around and say 'we ain't gotta fix shit!'""
So not only do I not have taxes or maintenance expenses to worry about, when something breaks I just call the landlord and have it done for me. I never shovel snow. Don't have to mow grass. Never clean leaves out of the gutters. Never have to paint, fix concrete steps, repair broken windows, etc... you get the idea.
It's worth it to me to pay monthly for peace of mind. The only thing I lack is a garage where I can park the convertible and do maintenance on the cars.
I'm spoiled now. I've been in apartments so long I don't know if I'd even want to have a house even if it was given to me. I've become too accustomed to lack of maintenance. I've only shoveled snow once in 30 years. Plus I'm too close to retirement now to open a long mortgage, not to mention too old to be climbing ladders and hauling bricks or tree branches around.
Nope. I'm gonna take that money I saved on house maintenance and taxes to buy a house boat and dock it in a canal somewhere in the Florida Keys when I retire. Maybe I can afford a Checkmate boat too, so I can get the hell outta Dodge when the hurricanes come."

"event","I've been having chills and fever the last couple days, and that was after some other initial symptoms that kinda scare me.
The doctor's appointment is for 9:30 today, so I'm off after I post this.
I googled the symptoms at work yesterday, and I immediately called the doctor to make the appointment. I took a sick day today. I guess I'll find out if he'll let me go back in to work this afternoon.
I'm also supposed to help out with the disc golf tournament here in town all weekend, and I've been reluctant to call the tournament director until after I see the doctor. I don't want to be out on one of the courses and experience fever and/or chills. I'm not sure whether it'll be good to be outdoors all day both days this weekend, either. I kinda feel bad because the planning has been going on for quite a while, and I promised the tournament director I'd be available all weekend for whatever he needs me to do. One less person helping him out would hurt.
Google UTI. That's the infection I think I have, and most of the symptoms are present.
Welp, off to the doc.
Wish me luck."

"event","I like golf because it reflects my present personal state of mind.
I'm all messed up. I don't think I've had two consecutive good nights of sleep in two months.
Can't think, can't type, can't walk, can't drink, etc...
Friggin allergies.
Tonight's round showed it. Schizophrenic. The round itself was two-in-one. The first 11 holes were terrible, and if I hadn't been putting like a possessed demon, the last 7 would have made the round completely wasted. As it stands, making about 5 impossible putts saved the last seven holes.
I haven't really had what I would consider two complete holes back-to-back all spring. There have been some desperate saves. This completely coincides with my allergy-laden, most sucky of any I can ever remember Spring. No relief. Not one night since the last frost. It. Never. Ends.
I'm falling behind on laundry, mail, cleaning, the convertible... everything. It's already goddamn June, and I haven't gotten April's worth of sleep yet.
I know I have a great job, good security (1st economic downturn that hasn't tossed me in the street since I've been of working age), a nice retirement, great co-workers, and I love working downtown, but I'm seriously starting to think of moving out of this climate. It seems like something has been spewing pollen since, like February or something. I'm so spacey some times, I feel almost like I'm having out-of-body experiences.
Plus, my disc golf game is out of whack. I can putt like a demon, so I can finish the deal. It's just getting hard to find my way to the first tee these days."

"event","The day was full of promise.
Friday. Start of the weekend.
Indie Summer series on Fountain Square.
Either a Pearlene show at Northside Tavern or Todd Snider at Southgate House to follow.
Since the Square show started at 7:00, and I get off work at 4:30, I had some time to kill. Went to the Rock Bottom Brewery on the Square to have a beer and finish up a book I was reading. The beer finished before the book, so I ambled out onto the square and found a great seat to watch the show. The book begged to be finished, and the last couple chapters ate up the first half of the opening band's set.
I don't know whether it was the beer, the book, or the band, but I got up before their set was done and decided to take the finished book back to the library a couple blocks away. Dropped the book in the deposit drawer and lit up a smoke. Suddenly I didn't feel like going back to the Square. The car was parked a couple blocks away. It beckoned.
I feel sapped. The book was about the 1975 Major League baseball season. It followed the major players and their teams throughout the season, including the advent of the free agency era.
The book, its symbolism and play-by-play accounting of the postseason, and its descriptions of the implications of the onset of free agency combined with a strong beer and a slow boring opening act to the summer concert series so as to drive me indoors this beautiful Friday night.
I feel like I should be out there soaking in the beginning of the summer season, but I have no energy whatsoever.
So I sit here, sapped of energy, wondering what happened to the promise of a great day. I could fall asleep right now.
Geesh. is this what it feels like to get old?"

I guess that didn't come about.
She got back in touch with me a couple weeks back. Wanted to hang out. Had a date for a Reds game last Saturday. Her dad had to go to the hospital. I went to the game alone, couldn't find anyone else to go on short notice.
Her dad's not doing too well. She said he might not make it to Christmas, and she's fixing up the house to move him in and care for him.
*sigh* 
I'd have bought twenty more tickets if it meant he didn't have to get sick. I feel bad for him, she's a nervous wreck, and I feel selfish for thinking we'll probably never get together."

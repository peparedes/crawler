"event","A poem:

For You 
by Me

Fighting the listlessness
Waging the war
Struggling to mend the tatters of my heart
Crying alone in deep dark places
Broken and bleeding, my soul has been torn away
Your light, your touch, your love and your life
Died bleeding in my arms
As darkness closes in I pray to see your light once more
To feel your touch
Its eternal sting
Longing fills my empty soul
My love for you my only hope
A sliver of light in deepest darkness
Keeping me from drowning
Holding me afloat
In seas of loss and sorrow
In dark despair, memories of your eyes
Twin slivers of light and hope
I drink them in like pure ambrosia
My love for you a spring eternal
Sweeter than the fountain of youth
Without your love, I wither and die
A rose in midsummer heat
I fall to my knees and beg forgiveness
For all your pain and hurt
For you I bleed, I give my life
I plead to feel your grace
Your love my holiest of lights
My religion and my path
My soul hungers for its touch
Like mana from Heaven
Without which I will starve
In deserts of endless despair"

"event","I cannot shake the unflappable feeling that some huge wave of change is about to swallow my life.  I cannot tell whether it is good or bad, but I have the very distinct impression that it is very much a lot of both.  You, dear reader, might think it odd that I feel this way.  The fact is, too many things have happened lately to feel any other way.  Things I cannot mention to anyone.  Things that indicate the hands of Fate have become far more than the subtle manipulators of the weave they once were.  There is almost an aggressiveness to everything that has been happening lately.  A very distinct aggression that seems to want to create some huge tsunami of epic proportions that will sweep away something that once was me and create something new.  Something different.  There are more people than me involved in the change.  Without my dreams lately, I would know that there are certain things that were about to occur anyway.  My drams make it absolutely certain that those things will.  Some people may scoff at the fact that I put so much portent into some dreams I have had, but the fact is that whenever I have those types of dreams...I KNOW what they are.  They are never exact, never literal, but they almost always have some sort of metaphorical context.  The ones I have had lately have been an example of the Fates saying ""Fuck it.  Fuck subtelty, fuck the fucking weave.  Hit him with it all at once.""  A Karmic wave that is not the usual Black Hole I am.  A wave of...something I cannot quite describe, but which I know is not all bad.  There is bad in it, though.  There has to be.  Then again, I am due some good karma for once.  I think I have more than paid my penance for everything that I have done (well, not everything, there is one thing recent that I very very much regret, but I will not go into that, there is one person who knows what I am referring to, and I will leave it at that)."

"event","The case of America's first real serial killer is a very very interesting one, though, and one that has fascinated me for quite some time now, especially when you take into account the things that happened afterward that one can really only attribute to the supernatural aspect of the case.  

Here is a link that will help understand the aspects of it.  I actually lived not very far from this site when I lived in Chicago (and we lived in lots of places in Chicago, but the area we lived in that was close to here was one of those areas where I saw many of the things that I had noticed there.  Chicago is a very weird, very haunted place.  There are a lot of things that I saw there that I can attribute to the way that I turned out.  Some day (maybe as the subject of a new book) I will detail the many things I have seen."

"event","Falling
by Me

In sickly sweet desperation
I am falling
Into you
For you
Your eyes a burning passionate fire
Your skin a searing touch untamed
Falling
Into you
Of you
For you
In worlds lit only in dark
The falling makes them brighter
Pulsing, beating, like your heart
I feel it beneath my hand as it lies upon your chest
In time with my own
Soft, perfect, your beauty never fades
Falling, forever, into you
Your breath falls hot against my cheek
A tornado rush of wind
Your touch lies hot against my skin
A jackhammer of pleasure
Your eyes burn deep into my soul
An eternity of longing
Your kiss never fails to steal away my breath
Ensuring every day that I am falling
Into you
My love lies in depths unplumbed
Stronger, harder, more than love has a right to be
I love you more than any have ever loved before
Nor ever will
Napoleon and Josephine, Romeo and Juliet
A bond stronger than theirs or any other
One that can never be severed
By time or tide, by circumstance
By the darkening of the light
Forever will I be falling
Into you"

ONe of those things is probably something I should not talk about, but some of the othet things...I think one of the biggest things is priest robes (and I found these awesome cardinal robes that I want to buy for someone).  Another thing is the fact that sometimes I think of things that are completely and totally worng, and they make sense inside my worldview.  Just what that worldview is, only one person really nows the full extent of, and it's kind of disjointed.  Wow, this post rambles.  I did not intend it to.  I am kind of depressed actually because I forgot my story and my German phrases with my writing partner (so she should not look at those German phrases and I will pick them up tomorrow).  I forgot them in her bag.  I forget lots of things when I'm around her, so I'm sure she is not surprised."

"event","""He thrusts his fists against the posts, and still insists he sees the ghosts.""  Over and over and over again.  Sometimes, things and people from a past situation in your life that you would rather not deal with or remember.  That happens to me more all the time.  Every single person that knew my ex-wife and the person that she was cheating on me with that was in San Antonio encouraged her to sleep with him.  They all knew she was married to me (though the majority of them probably did not know me and still don't they damned sure knew who he was and they knew her).  The fact that they did not know me just makes it worse.  And the fact that now they are involved in something else in my life makes it even worse for me in other ways.  The world around me gets so small that it feels like the walls of the trash compactor in Star Wars 4.  I try to breathe, I try to struggle, I try to pull it all out of my shrinking chest, and it all comes tumbling back in.  Still, I will not falter in my resolve.  I will do what needs to be done to get everything in order, and I will concentrate on all those things I need to concentrate on.  I just need assistance from time to time pushing me to not fall, to not slip."

"event","I have been thinking a lot about Harlan Ellison's infamous (to me at least) ""cake rant.""  I guess I should explain a little, although if you know me, you've already heard this story.  There used to be a half hour news show on the Sci Fi channel called ""Sci Fi Buzz.""  On that show, they had editorial commentary by Harlan Ellison.  On one particular show, HE was talking about the one phrase he hated above all others- ""have your cake and eat it too."" his argument, of course, was that you can indeed have your cake and eat it.  What you cannot do is eat your cake and have it.  So the phrase should then become ""Eat your cake and have it, too"" because that was actually the impossibility implied by the saying.  I have ever since been in awe of the man (not that I didn't think he was a literary genius before that, I just respected him much more afterwards).  Anyway, I'm not really sure what the point of this post is except to say that that particular rant has been in my mind A LOT the last few weeks."

And not just issues with the way I feel about people.  I worry.  I worry a lot.  I worry that certain people will forget how I feel about them (not just her though she is the last person I want to forget anything about the way I feel) but my daughters as well.  I worry that my daughter in Michigan will forget how I feel, I worry that my daughter here will forget how I feel or even worse, remember and not care.  I will persevere, though.  From time to time, I just need reassurance that they all remember.  That they won't forget.  And I always said other people had validation issues.  I will dedicate myself to making things better in everything that I do, in every part of my life, through the writing.  It is important that I get my computer back up and running because I need to make sure I am dedicating myself to those things I need to be working on.  That two month window I set for myself in terms of securing a publishing deal for War-Wolf is coming quick, and I will not let myself falter and will not let my computer being down hold me back."

"event","I'm trying not to drown in my likely irrational despair.  I seem to make all the wrong choices at all the times they can be the most wrong, and it bugs me to no end.  I am trying to remain stoic, though.  I will not falter right now.  I cannot.  Eyes on the goal.  Always.  Right now that goal has to be getting my various writing projects done and published despite the setbacks.  War-Wolf will get published, if not by Riptide, then by someone else.  Of that, I have no doubt.  And the Lebensborn Project (I'm not actually sure what we are going to call the anthology, but I think we will have to worry about that after we have everything else done).  That is extremely important (I tried to occupy my mind today by working on ""Liebend der Ubermenschen,"" the short story that I started writing that I think is probably going to turn into a novella at the least (and will be a springboard for the potential of an entire book or a series of books-I find the idea of a series of books based on an alternate history where everything is changed according to the Lebensborn Project to be appealing- I just have to be careful...I still need to finish Burden of Darkness and the Wars Without End series as well).  We will write more on Monday before I go to work and I have no doubt we will accomplish much work.  I look forward to it, and need to remember that my focus needs to be tight and kept straight.  I cannot let things bother me, and I will not let them, no matter who says them, no matter what the opinions of others might be, I will stay on focus.  The stories are my way out.  The stories are important, and I will resolutely stick to that because I firmly believe that, through the stories, I can make everything better.  Of course, I have been producing such an incredibly voluminous amount of work lately that if I were to be published and die the same day, they could probably milk out a good twenty years worth of stories.  I want to take the Harlan Ellison route, though.  If I die, I would like all of my unpublished and unfinished work to be burned.  I don't have anyone to do that for me, but one person.  And if she said she would, I would trust her to do it.  She would have to be quick, though, because I am certain that someone else would exploit it as much as they possibly could."

She doesn't want it to scare the guests.  So she said I shoudl ""tone it down.""  Of course, I don't think she quite realizes that this is toned down.  I am seriously thinking of ice blue eyeshadow as soon as I can find it.  Although, I think I will take my liebchen's advice and go with grey until I find the ice blue.  Grey would be nice.  I bought something for myself today and some things for someone else, and I feel guilty about buying the item for myself (sort of, I really only bought it because she said I should, and I like seeing her smile.  Her smile is beautiful).  We will work more on our story on Monday, and I think that we will get a lot more accomplished.  I have great things in mind for this story and great things in mind in general for this book- a compilation of stories done by the two of us that I think will be enough of a genre-breaking (some romance, some science fiction, some fantasy, some drama, some horror) work that we will have to fight people off if we submit it to more than one publisher or agent when it is done.  Buying her things and working with her makes me feel good.  I love being near her, and yes, I miss her so much it hurts sometimes, but yesterday and today made me feel very very good.  And not even Kit and her ""tone it down"" could change that."

"event","Today was the first step in what I am certain will be a wonderful writing partnership.  We complement each other very well in our writing and it is kind of scary to note that she trims my exceedingly wordy writing down to a more manageable level.  And how well she does it.  Our thoughts seem to run parallel on what the story should be, and I think that this particular story will be perhaps the one that makes a difference in our lives and the lives of others.  There is an inherent tragedy in not only the story, but in the background of the story historically.  Her writing style is wonderful and so much on the opposite end of the spectrum from mine that our two styles seem to fit together like pieces of a puzzle that had been waiting for the right hand to guide them into place.  And I honestly don;t think that either one of us could have written this story with anyone but each other.  That, in its own way, should say volumes.  I believe that we can accomplish the anthology of Lebensborn stories we are working on, and I think that it can be a very marketable thing to do as well.  I have confidence that the two of us will surpass our own not insubstantial talents (hers is amazing and she writes very well, with a very emotional, human edge that I often lack) and transcend what has gone before."

"event","The alignment of the planets, it was believed, has an influence in the way that people act and react.  The whole basis of astrology is such that the planetary sign you are born under dictates the events your life undergoes.  Sometimes, I tend to think that those invisible planetary tides have more of an effect on our lives than even those who believe in astrology think.  *sigh* I'm writing a story (the Lebensborn one with the German title) and I find myself becoming immersed in the world I create and I can feel that old familiar sting that comes with creating my own history from things I know.  World War Two has always been my era.  My fascination.  Ever since I was little, I devoured books on World War Two.  I read the Rise and Fall of the Third Reich when I was 7.  I owned a copy of ""Who's Who in Nazi Germany"" when I was in high school, and one of my favorite Stephen King stories, even to this day, is ""Apt Pupil.""  World War Two was a fascinating time and the catalyst for so many changes to the world that have made life what it is today that it is very easy to imagine all the things that could have happened during that critical point in history.  The key point of the story I am writing is a sort of revisionist superhero look at World War Two.  The Lebensborn Project is successful beyond the wildest dreams of its creators and Himmler is rewarded with a small but immensely powerful group of ubermenschen, beings of extraordinary power who have the ability to change the course of history as we know it.  I won't give anything else about the story away.  I started it as a short story and I can already see the characters becoming something far more than I had originally intended (as so often happens with my writing-I have always said that I do not write the characters, the characters guide me into telling the story that they have experienced).  I feel very good about this story, and I feel very good about the collaboration tomorrow.  I have a feeling that this is one of the things we were meant to do together.  That these tales of the Lebensborn are something that only the two of us together could have conceived.  It makes me feel good, and my trepidation will hold and melt itself away as long as I focus on the task at hand.  The task at hand and making everything successful.  I'm not exactly sure what we should call the book of stories, but I imagine we will come up with that tomorrow as well so that we can concentrate on everything being the way it should be."

"event","I have started writing a series of stories about the Lebensborn.  A subject that I had not thought of in 17 years until someone else told me they were writing stories on it.  Seventeen years.  I think I posted somewhere else that the story I wrote 17 years ago was a science fiction story.  I started writing one now based in the world of the War-Wolf, my series of novels that I had originally intended to be young adult, but which are definitely more and more mature as they progress.  The second one that I began to write is actually turning out to be the more interesting of the stories, and it follows the changing of the world through the Lebensborn project.  It is reality/horror/fantasy/science fiction/military all rolled into one with a little bit of comic book/superhero flavoring but with my definite penchant for dark storytelling intact.  I think if I were to write a short story that would garner any critical acclaim whatsoever that this might be it.  
On Thursday, I am going to be collaborating with someone.  I look forward to it, but I'm very nervous about it as well.  I am anal about my writing.  I have never actually collaborated with someone on a basis so intimate before (the only collaboration I ever did was writing the first chapter of a college science fiction class final exam and summarily having all of my characters wiped out by the person who wrote the second chapter).  I have never actually collaborated with someone before.  Ia m looking forward to it though.  She has a writing style that I think will work well with mine and I can see the book of individual and collaborative stories doing well and getting published relatively easily.  The subject I think is one that has not been explored much, especially in speculative fiction, and I had previously thought I was the only person even interested in the stories of eugenics and the spring of life project.  I was wrong.  As I usually am.  I think that this collaboration could mean a lot for both of us, and I think that doing it will be a big step for both of us as well."

"event","Dedicated to my  beautiful namesake of the Distant Shores:

Okay, so here is a story I have written (I will post what I have had a chance to type in so far-I always handwrite everything and then tyoe it in afterward (Neil Gaiman does the same thing) as it is a good way of creating a first and second draft.  My obvious Poe affliction has filled me: (the title of my post is the title of the story):



	Alas, I canot remember when last I felt my heart soar as it did that day.  If forced to find a time, I would have to admit that never was there such a time as the time I first kissed her lips.  Yet as high as the dizzying ascent, just as dark is the lonely silence that came after.  As above, so below.  
	The depths of my despair now hold no surcease.  There is no respite from my loss, for the pallid night has stolen from me that which I doth now firmly attest brought a bright and sacred balm to the wounded scar that is my soul.
	Her eyes.  Her eyes are forever burned into my heart, gripping that lonely organ in is arrythmic palpitations like the fist of a dead miser, clutching his last pence, hoping that he has squandered enough to pay his passage 'crost stygian waters.  Full of tears and lonely sadness, a quiet dark reflected there in my own soul, our kinship was immediate.  There was magic, a rightness, an exquisite beauty to what we shared.  Yet so broken, so wounded, was I that I could not see, could not embrace the truth in what should have, to me especially, been so obvious.  Now, I fear, it is far too late.  The fable hounds of Tyndalos hunger eagerly for the last scraps of my tattered and bloodied essence.
	I have traversed my own Golgotha, its hill steep and marred with stones thrown at my bleeding body as I carried the cross I made with my own carpenter's hands.  Lest I dash my hopes anew 'pon distant Plutonian shores, I crawled through the wreckage of my weariness and could not ascend from out those cavernous depths until the light I saw blazing at the end of that dore tunnel had rescinded from the doorway, leaving me sealed in a tomb of dark silence with walls I cannot break.
	I sat with pen in hand, writing desperately in the pages of my journal in an attempt to cleanse from my heart the weight of the sins I had drawnupon it as Pilate cleansed his hands to was from it the martyr's blood that stained them.  Yet no blood poured from my soul 'pon its pages could alleviate the endless night I had found myself entrapped within.
	I sought also to assuage the spirits that vexed me with soirits in turn, the latter leaving me only with a quickly drying palette and a slow dull ache in my head that was not filled with the warmth I had wished it to be.  And so those spirits of torment yet pervaded my dreams 'til I could sleep no more 'pon that empty bed we once had shared.  The absence of her presence hung over all aorund me like a darkening pall, my nights restless and unyielding to the realms of Hypnos.
	Neither pen nor alcoholic imbibement offered peace, for I deserved none.  There was no fault for what had transpired save my own, no blame to be cast save that cast in my direction.  The soft drumming of of rain on the roof suggested the melancholy sadness of the Fates at my defiance of their edicts, and their cruelty and much deserved punishment woul be meted out to the foolish heart of the one who had denied what had been in front of him to see for so long.  
	The steady rhythm of those raindrops provided a sharp counterpoint to the unsteadiness of my pulse and I soon found myself wracked with tears once more, the pen in my hand writing on endlessly in my journal, spilling word after word onto the page in the wake of the tears that fell from my eyes 'pon the paper just as the drops of rain surely fell upon the roof from the same weeping eyes of angels.
	My eyes began to glide into that half-nether-region 'twixt sleep and wakefulness the kingdom of which is ruled with iron hand by dark Phobos, whose ruby scepter strikes deep into the hearts of the unwary who venture therein.  Yet this night, unlike the others I had dwelled alone in the in the kingdom of Phobos, I felt myself slipping quietly past the ominous guardians of the domain of his brother, wherein I had not ventured for weeks.
	When I woke, I struggled to tear open my sleep-encrusted eyes, feeling a soft breeze  which carried upon it a light mist that tingled 'pon my skin.  I was lying on a beach, the darksome waves of the ocean lapping at the white sands of a place I at once recognized and had never dared to hope I would tread.  The waves were a deep, coppery red in color and where they crashed in foam-filled breakers 'gainst the sands, the beach ws left to appear as if a wound had been torn deep in the flesh of the world itself.
     From some great distance I heard a baying, as of hounds hungering for the sweet flesh of their prey.  I stumbled slightly, believingI was still held in the grip of Morpheus and walked toward those waters (the oceans of soulblood that had pervaded my dreams and left me sighing at the sheer beauty of their storm-tossed churnings).  The white sands were rough beneath my feet (which now were bare though I had surely been wearing shoes when first I awoke) and I could feel each grain poking and prodding at my skin.  I pinched myself to try to wake from what I was certain was the dream world and my fevered, grieving memories of those distant shores I had dreamed of since birth.
	A large welt arose on my skin and the pain that accompanied itindicated to me that I was,in fact, not the victim of the game of some playful dream king but had somehow been transported by Fate to the distant shores of Aidenn, from which I would never wish to leave.  I looked across the vast ocean of roiling waves that stretched before me and a similar tide of pure melancholy o'ertook me.  The peace and calm represented in the ocean was the peace I had dreamed of having as I walked along those very shores.

I have ruined them all.  It's what I do.  I am the darkest black utterance the world has ever spewed forth, and all aorund me crumbles because I can make it no better.  I would ask her forgiveness, but I know that I would never receive it.  I would ask for her life and mine together but if there is one thing in this world I do not deserve, it is her light.  I should enjoy the time we spend together, yet every moment without her is more and more painful.  i cut deep into myself because I long to be nearer her than I have the right to long for.  I want to touch her soft skin, feel the whisper of her breath.  Feel the soft sweet caress of her lips as they meet mine.  And I have destroyed my hopes of being with her.  I push without meaning to push because the edict of the Fates weighs more and more heavily upon my soul.  I love her.  Now and always. And I hope only that one day both she and my daughters forgive me."

"event","I want to preface all of this by saying Sin City is an awesome movie.  Very true to the comic and perfect in every way.  The perosn I went with is perfect, too, and I wish I could be with her all the time.  *sigh*  I know her so well, and she knows me, and I wish I could change the way things happened.  I wish I could make things right.  I can't, though.  Unless she gives me the chance to try.  I have always been fiercely loyal.  I was with my ex-wife for ten years, and never once during that time even dreamed of anyone else.  I know people think that I was bad, that I was wrong.  That I did things I should not have.  I am one of those people.  I am the BIGGEST one of those people.  ""Every day they yank my thread, and every day, they snip at the ends."" 
Yesterday, someone wrote a check for a purchase at my work.  The two names on the check were so close to my name and her name (my love) that it was unnatural.  Fate is not at all subtle with me.  But then, it just reinforces what I already know.  What I felt before and could not face.  What I feared.  What I will never fear again.  I know she doesn't want to hurt anyone else, but isn't it hurting the two of us more?  I want so badly to be with her, to have her at my side, to make everything better, to hold, to hear the soft sigh of her breath as she breathes next to me.  I want to spend my life with her, and I fear that I am making things worse by being near her.  I fought it.  I fought and fought and fought.  I was stupid, and railed against it, saying that I was not going to let my ex-wife happen again.  That I would not let myself feel about anyone the way I felt about her.  I was right.  I don't feel about anyone the way I felt about my ex-wife.  I feel more.  I love my soft sweet light more than I was in love with my ex-wife, and she truly knows things about me that my ex-wife NEVER knew.  Things I could never share with my ex-wife.  I want so much for the owner of the name of Poe's distant shores to be so much more a part of my life.  I need her.  I am empty without her, and I am so sorry for the things I did that drove her away.  She won't let herself hurt anyone else.  So settling into something where you ahve to hide parts of yourself from the person you are with is preferable to hurting someone again.  It shouldn't be.  If we care about those people and about ourselves at all, then the things we need to do are the things that make life hardest.  I swear to her that I will spend my life making up for what I did.  Making up for my fear and my inability to trust.  I want the chance.  I want a life with her and with her alone.  I want a family with her. I want all the things that I have always wanted and was so broken that I could not admit I wanted them with her.  I LOVE HER.  With all my heart and soul.  Every breath in my body is for her and her alone.  I miss her when I am away from her, and I want to spend eternity on the vast shores together with her.  If she will only give me that chance to prove it to her."

"event","Someone once told me that you should not settle.  That settling into things is bad.  That we should strive to enter into that perfect moment, always.  She was right.  Beyond doubt, settling is bad.  That which is worth living for is worth fighting for, dying for.  A truer movie statement has never been uttered.  I stand here, walking the distant shores, looking at night's Plutonian sky, and I wonder why I was ever so stupid.  Darth Vader (I'm full of movie quotes today...the anticipation of Sin City, I suppose) said ""Fear will keep them in line.""  That, also, is true.  Fear makes you walk a line that is both dangerous and deadly.  Fear is the mindkiller.  And the heartbreaker.  And the End of all things.  I don't want my previous fears to signal an End to what I should have had.  The one thing I feared was the one thing I should not have.  Anthrax have a song entitled ""In My Worldd"" which says ""Face the face of fear/Face the face of death.""  It's a song from the point of view of someone trapped in their own world by their fears.  Never taking chances.  I did that.  I won't do it again.  I will not settle."

"event","I am an atheist, as anyone who knows me knows.  However, that does not mean I do not believe in Fate or Destiny.  It means I don't believe that there is a God that we all answer to.  I believe that forces in the Multiverse are much greater than any G(g)od could ever be.  Just because I am an atheist does not mean I lack Faith.  Seventeen years ago, I wrote a story about the Lebensborn.  Seventeen years ago is also when I did that bad self-loathing/self-hurt thing last.  Recently I did that thing (as my prior entries attest to) and the person whom I cherish and love above all others in my life emailed me and is writing stories about the Lebensborn.  Perhaps I should point out the fact that one of my favorite sayings is that ""There is no such thing as coincidence.""  We all know, at the core, that that statement is truer than truth itself.  I believe that there are reasons things happen.  I believe there are reasons someone from my prior life was introduced into a life that I culd have shared with the person I fell in love with and that person was driven away by my fear of commitment and that person from my prior life.  I believe Fate was showing me that the past is put in our way and we need to move beyond the past and look to the future.  I believe that the reason for that other person being put between us is the same reason as the person there now (but not on my side).  To show me/us that things are not as easy or as ordained as we would always think.  There is no such thing as coincidence, but I believe that Fate is sometimes spiteful and hurtful, that it needs sometimes to smash us to the core of our beings to show us the way we should travel along its road.  I know whom I love.  I know now that I will never love another as much as I love her now.  ""I will not crumble"" is a statement for a wall.  She is not a wall.  She is grace and beauty and light and love and hope.  She is the distant shores, she is the balm.  There is no such thing as coincidence.  Two things that occurred seventeen years ago occurring again, both with her as catalysts at the core prove that to me more than ever.  She remembers.  And I will never forget.  I believe Fate is telling us both something.  I hope that it's not just me that hears it."

"event","For some reason, music warps around me.  It hits me hard.  I have always been a big music person (I played bass for a long time in a band in which I wrote all the lyrics and 90% of the music and even coined the term gothic death punk to describe the melding of my Sisters of Mercy/old Metallica/Candlemass/Slayer/Misfits breed of music) and so have always been very sensitive to both melody and lyric (being a writer, the lyric part is always more important to me and I used to have lots of arguments about why a certain song had to be worded a certain way).  The downside of this is that music tends to play around me in a reality warping way.  I am not kidding.  My playlist has an inherent evil built into it, it will play the songs that make me the most depressed.  It's inherently evil and it digs through 16 gigs worth of music to play the ones that hit me hardest.  Today at work, a song and a band that I thought I would never hear over the Toys R US PA system came on and broke me in pieces.  It was 10 AM, we had just opened for the day, and ""Love Song"" by the Cure came on.  I had to get someone to watch my area and then I did something very bad that I will not tell.  Something I had not done in 17 years until the other day, not even during the course of separation and divorce.  Music was not done with me for the day, however, it played ""In Your Eyes"" by Peter Gabriel, a song that makes me cry every single time I hear it, and then in my car talking, it skipped from George Thorogood on my CD to the very first song (it should have been playing them in order, but like I said, it warps around me) and went to Acid Bath's ""Pagan Love Song.""  A song whose opening lyric is ""Dying felt so goddamned good today/If I was ever alive, well, it's hard to say/It was burning my eyelids and melting my face away/Yeah, dying felt so goddamned good today.""  Considering what I had done earlier, that song was a perfect example of the reality warping music.  Then, standing there talking, ""Time After Time"" by Cyndi Lauper.  *sigh*   The day started with ""Love Song"" by the Cure in a toy store that I have worked in for almost two years and NEVER heard a Cure song in, much less THAT one.  I slipped, and I am sorry.  I slipped worse a few days ago, and I try not to, I really really try not to.  Work and writing are the only things that keep me from slipping.  I have to concentrate on other things, but the thing that made me slip so hard the other day was my daughter.  I cannot get away from the fact that I believe I wrecked her life by succumbing to my own insecurities and wrecking my own is one thing, wrecking others', especially hers, by my own actions, is something I hate myself for.  The self-loathing boiled up and the depressive (I won't say what I did or where I did it) old regime kicked in.  Seventeen years.  And it slipped away just like that.  All because of a single comment my daughter made.  Just one comment during a commercial for the Elektra DVD.  Okay, enough...I promised myself I would not get more depressed than usual writing this entry.  I am going to stick by that and pretend that I did not just write that.  I will not think about those things because thinking of those things will make me slip more, and I cannot afford to slip any more.  Especially not the way it makes me want to."

I swore that I would never subject myself to it because when I keep a journal, I have the idea that it is supposed to be intimate, private thoughts, and sharing those thoughts means you are definitely going to get hurt.  I'm nothing if not obsessively masochistic, though, so here I am.  Intimate thoughts. Please forgive me if these thoughts and the things I write in them are personal of a nature that one would not usually share.  If I am going to keep a journal online, then I will make it public because that is the nature of my disease.  I plan on getting my first novel published (or at least getting a contract for getting it published) within the next two months.  That is my hard goal.  I will succeed in it.  But I want one person at my side to do that with.  She is my best friend and always will be.  I love her dearly and would burn down the world and give to her the stars though their light pales in comparison to her beauty and glory.  I ask of her but two promises.  One that she does not ever forget how I feel, for I will feel that way always.  Two, that if things ever change, she will give me another chance.  I screwed up, and I know that, and I want another chance to make things right, to turn back the tides of time that washed away the dreams we shared because I could not admit that I shared them with her.  I will live in eternal regret because of it, especially if I never get another chance to prove to her that she is the only light in a world that is dark without her.  When she is near, when I hear her voice, when I see her smile, when I feel her touch, my world becomes one filled with light and joy and wonder.  Even being near her and knowing that we can only be friends makes me feel better because her presence warms me with untold joy and emotion.  She knows things I will never share with another soul.  She knows things that my ex-wife does not know.  She knows things in my heart and soul that will forever be hers and mine alone.  And I know things the same about her.  She can always be who she is around me.  She never has to hide anything from me and I want her to know that.  I would think that she does, but I want to reaffirm that.  I also want to reaffirm that I will always accept every part of her, I always have.  No matter what that part may be.  Never does she have to hide anything from me.  I never felt like I had to hide anything from her, even though I did.  I hid my feelings.  I don't want to do that any more.  I will, though, because she wants me to.  I will wait in silence forever if need be.  I accept every part of her, and there is no detail in her whether seen or unseen that I do not find fraught with wondrous beauty.  All I ask is that she remember that.  That she never forget that, and that she give me another chance if she ever finds it in her heart to do so.

I feel empty without her by my side, but as long as she is there, I will always be able to go on with the hope that one day we will be together again, even if it is somewhere past the vast shores of eternity. (I believe firmly that she was my destiny, sice her name is the same as the distant shores Poe spoke of often in his writing and Poe has always been one of my favorite authors since I was three and I often referenced those shores in my writing since the age of 8)."

I sometimes wonder whether or not I should be allowed access to things like pen and paper or a keyboard.  I suppose, though, if I were not, that I would go insane, driven mad by the voices that permeate my thoughts.  God...I know I often seem pretentious...I truly try not to be.  The problem stems from the fact that I began reading when I was two years old and started reading Poe, Lovecraft, Howard, Dunsany, and Hodgson when I was 3.  I was hooked on gothic fiction and big pretentious words of description.  I would read whole letters of the unabridged dictionary in order to increase my vocabulary at the age of four, before I was even attending school.  In kindergarten, I was reading Robert E. Howard Conan novels to my class. *sigh*  Forgive me for being pretentious...it's ingrained, and I try not to be...without further ado, here is the poem I wrote:

My Melancholy Demise

Fallen dark into dank pits of despair
Where rain falls forever with salt on my tongue
O bitter emptiness of my infinite void
Strains to break free from this world

Our souls intertwined by destiny's shadow
Rent asunder by my dark mistakes
With passionate cries,  the tolling of bells
Herald the fall of bright Acheron

Time drawing nearer when all things shall pass
And from Oblivion's chalice, I drink once more
Never again to know your touch, your scent, the warmth of your heart
My love lost forever on Plutonian shores

Heed the endless lapping of the soulblood oceans eroding away
The beaches of Aidenn, the fairest repsite
Nepenthe nor succor, no stay for my sorrow
Restless choirs of angels hold their songs

Repentant and bleeding, the blood of my soul
My sorrowful mourning, your passage of light, that no more will brighten my door
In infinite sadness, the loss of your love I grieve
Until the time of my melancholy demise"

Yes, indeed, Mike, yes, indeed."

"event","Sitting wrapped here alone in shadow's cloak
The cold comfort of darkness replaces your warm embrace
Wrapped in eternal solitude, pain of dark centuries breaking my resolute heart
Falling up means only a higher plateau from which to descend
And drifting back to the hungry maw of shadow's grip
The masticating ever present shadow tears my soul
Leaving me stripped and begging for release 
Kneeling like the priest at the altar of sacrifice
I offer my lonely soul
Ejected from the bosom of my saviour, the blood congeals at my feet
And still the shadow creeps in"

"event","Times like these are times that try the soul.  Times that twist the knife deeper and burn the already scarred landscape of what once was.  Scars are not healed by time, they are left by its passage.  The wounds are left, and time does not heal those wounds, it leaves the scars.  Battles are fought not on physical fields of battle, but in the hearts and souls of everyone who has ever thought if fighting for anything they believe in.  My thoughts run together and I know they are dripping cobalt blue, burning acid wisps of nothingness down my face disguised as tears.  ""Tomorrow is just an empty promise and tomorrow only another lie.""  When I first wrote that, it meant the same thing it means now.  Tomorrow never comes, it never will.  Forever is a myth.  Nothing is forever."

"event","I've always wanted a life that was complemented by the person who would be my wife.  I have always wanted marriage and love and family.  The things I never had with my parents.  I always wanted that gorgeous wedding dream, that beautiful bride in white, that lovely spectacle and all the people.  ""Till death do you part.""  It never works that way, though, does it?  Not any more.  People don't stay together, people don't care about each other as much, and when there are any problems, they bolt to the next available person without a hint of trying to work things out.  I was married once.  I hate not being married.  But the person who I would have given up everything else for, my reservations, my insecurities, the person I would have tried to start over with, is gone now.  It sounds like whining to say that ""no one understands"" but my life has been the same pattern of love and loss.  Only because I feel that the loss was when I admitted that love, when I took the chance.  Yesterday, I had said that she left (Jena really is a beautiful name, and so fitting for one whose beauty shines as brightly as hers, whether she realizes it or not) because I could not tell her I would commit.  Because I was scared.  I'm sure that was a large part of it.  Because she thought that there woudl be someone else there, that I would leave her.  Always leave before you're left.  It always works that way.  I hate it.  I hate life, I hate love, I hate me.  Whining?  Oh yes.  Truth?  More than you know."

"event","I was so scared to be in love with anyone ever again that I lost the person I was in love with.  I wanted all the things she wanted, I wanted more.  I just couldn't say it because I didn't want her to go away just like everyone else in my life has ever done.  So not saying it had the same effect.  Not committing has the same effect in my life as committing.  Odd how it works that way.  After being married for so long, I was scared (scared puts it mildly) and I know that I am still in love with my ex-wife.  Everyone knows it.  It's hard not to be.  She has done many many horrible things, and yet I can forgive every one of them because I still love her.  Then I have someone, a friend who is one of the best friends I have ever had, and she knows I am still in love with my ex-wife, but I am falling in love with her and I can just never tell her.  I can never say that word, because it means that saying it will make her go away.  It made the last person I was seeing go away.  Why should anyone else be any different?  So now she finds someone else.  Because I didn't tell her how I really felt, I didn't tell her that I love her.  I do.  I love her very much, but there's nothing I can do about it now.

Knit One, Pearl Two
by Me

Knit One, Pearl Two, the needle goes through and through
Into the loop and through the soul, the woven threads of life undone
Sitting with darkness' empty loom, spiral threads of loves once past
Coming together in patterns of despair, bleeding the ocean of loss
Knit One, Pearl Two, the needle goes through and through
Piercing the skin, soulblood spilling, in spiral step with death"

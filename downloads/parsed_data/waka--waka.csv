Yes, he is orange. I was so suprised no one had claimed him; he's so pretty <333

He's also got this double-tail thing going on, which may just be a slit in his tail OR
he could be a double-tail betta. Didn't notice it til I had him in the tank though lol.
SO OBSERVANT.

He's my new baby&hearts;"

"event","I got a few more fish for the cichlid tank, and all is well. My bottom feeder stands his ground and even chases a few of the cichlids around if they get too close. He's just your average pleco, only with yellow spots (original, no? :p) and light brownish body. I just call him Stan.

Then there's the beautiful jewel-spotted Jewel (I am so lame D:) who I'm not sure is male or female. Very quiet and not as energetic about eating as the others.(light brownish-yellow with green flourescent sparkly scales and big black ""jewel"" in the center of her side on both sides)

Sunstreaker is boss. He rules his fishy 25 gallon kingdom with ferocity and power. (like I said, I'm lame DX) He is huge.(and he's yellow) But not as huge as my newest one.
 
I also have a yellow (big surprise) and black striped fish called Tiger (srsly, put this kid in the insane asylum) who loves his food and annoying the other fish 8D

Bee (again, yellow and black) is adorable and I love him D: He gets picked on, but he totally asks for it. I mean, he's so cute, you just want to punch him in the liver or something 8D

And the new one WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO BE BLUE IS FREAKING YELLOW AND I WANT DIFFERENT COLOURED FISH IN MY TANK DAMMIT.

Yeah, he's big and he's yellow (shines blue in the light though, if you squint) but I still like him. srsly though, NEED DIFFERENT COLOURS. The rocks are even such a light green, they look yellow!! DDDDX I love the colour, but I'm sick of it in my fish tank DDX 

ALKSAHKDHAKHSKFI JUST REALIZED I BOUGHT A YELLOW SNAIL WITHOUT THINKING GOD EFFING DAMMIT SAKDSNKFSKF

At least the fighting fish is blue. And red. And green. And white. And purple... <b>NOT</b> yellow.

That is all.

<b>ETA:</b> OMFG I FORGOT ABOUT RODDY OMG WHY AM I SO SCATTERBRAINED. 

Roddy is my little brown dwarf frog, who likes to miss his food on purpose because he's a jerk like that 8D But he's cute, he even tries to croke.

Neighbor's son's wife is expecting a baby sometime around my birthday, so that would be cool if it were born on my birthday. I think they are having a girl.

Love this keyboard. Used to loathe flat keyboards but now I think they rule the world.

Finally saw Batman Begins; didn't really understand what was going on but it was cool none the less. makes me even more excited for Dark Knight.

Watched I Am Legend again and it didn't freak me out nearly as much as the first time, though thats granted as we were watching it Imax and I do not do well with scary movies.

Loving geography, hating portfolio(who doesn't? :/) and feeling mixed about art. Spare is love, especially when we have 'Language time with Maan"" and learn Araibic.

Hmm.... OH! I got a mouse for the laptop right? So everytime I use the laptop, I remember I have a mouse an hour later. Usually thats when I am done with the computer too >: it sucks.

But I did change everything on the laptop. The arrow mouse thing is now a dancing puppy dog 8D And transformer sounds are now the log on/off sounds.

"event","Yeah, Bre asked me to go up to Big White snowboarding and stuff, so I did. 

Turned out to be the worst weekend in the entire history of bad weekends.

<b>Thursday</b>
-Leave school, pack stuff into car, pick up Jen and Heather.
-Have fun in car and enjoy ourselves.
-Get to Hope, try to go up Highway, get stuck, have to spend night in Hope in a nice hotel owned by a sweet little Korean woman.
   -Watch Bre try to snowboard, but fall in wet slush XD
   -<i>Dustin</i>: Hey guys, lets jack the broccoli calendar! <i>Heather</i>: NO! MAMA KOREA WILL BE SAD!

<b>Friday</b>
-Head out bright and early (before dawn D:)
-Do a 360 on the road and almost hit a snow pile(was actually really thrilling and fun)
-drive a bunch of hours
-Arrive at Big White and get the car stuck <b><i>2 FEET</b></i> from the cabin
-Try snowboarding for the first time and almost get stuck on the chair lift

<b>Saturday</b>
-Explore, try snowboarding again but chicken out and fail
-Go tubing later in evening and fall off the lift that pulls you up on your tube and slide down a slope, almost hitting trees, and have to wade through waist-deep snow while pushing the tube for the better part of 20 minutes(and it was my first time tubing too DDDX)
-Watch fireworks that last 2 minutes and start up again as soon as we get back to the cabin
-Be super sore and watch part of All Dogs Go To Heaven

<b>Sunday</b>
-SEARCH FOR 3 FREAKING HOURS FOR CAR KEYS AND NOT FIND THEM
-Tow car back to Jeff's house and prepare for bus ride back to Langley( D8)
-Get on bus while annoying kid plays with annoying noisy things for 7 and a half hours
-Go to Bre's so we can unpack and I can pick up school stuff
-Get home at 10:30, have shower, get to bed at 11:30

Upon arrival home, I find out that my frog(Orion), that I had for a full week prior to trip, had died and been found headless in the tank. Cry my eyes out for 2 hours because he was just a baby and I'm pathetic. Fish are totally sick(from their tasty meal) and look like they won't make it til morning. 

-Blue died Monday
-Whitefish died today
-Optimus is turning black and has bulging eyes
-Sunstreaker has bleeding between his scales and scratches
-Twin is scared and hiding
-Bumblebee is totally fine(typical the shark is smart enough not to eat Orion)
-Shuugeki is perfect and happy and built a bubble nest for me to see when I came home. Wanted to hug that damn fish for trying to make me feel better.

I'm so sick of cichlids right now I could throw up. I knew they weren't going to be easy to take care of like Shuugeki, but I wasn't expecting one to bully all the others make one so stressed that he died. or that they would, possibly, gang up on Orion and eat him. As soon as they're gone, that tank is being cleaned and Shuugeki will have a warmer, bigger home that he can be king and rule.

And I'm realizing that if I had never gone to Big White, Orion would still be here and not floating in a bag in the fridge so mom can exchange him for a new one. I loved that silly frog,; he would sit in my hand and try to croak. he was even yellow, not the regular albino color. I don't want to replace him, I just want to move my fighting fish in that tank so he can at least live happily for the rest of his life.

Teekee is now 12 years old. Put a bow on her head and basically made her look retarded. Played the birthday candle for her and she looked like she wanted to bite me.

<b>ETA:</b> 
-Optimus died and when company wanted to see my lovely fish, they saw him floating across the tank. Seems he was eaten a bit, like Orion.
-Twin died and is now sitting in my fridge next to Orion so mom can go chew the fish place out.
-Sunny has no more red streaks but now he isn't even darting around to eat. I think he's catching what Twin had.
-Bee is still totally fine. I wonder if he can stay with the fighting fish..?"

Applying at Petsmart is at the top of my list right now, though. Sorry Pricemart, you got too boring and repetitive.

Halloween actually wasn't as fun as I thought it would be. Makes me feel better about being forbidden to go out next year. Still dress up, just no candy, which is perfectly fine by me.

Transformers is the best movie of 2007. I swear, I've watched it a million times already and it's awesomeness still gives me chills. Sequel coming out June 28, 2009 so that will be exciting. Hopefully it lives up to the first movie.

I learned how to knit :D Also learned that my grandpa really wasn't my grandpa. Don't 
know how that works or what happened though, just found out from my cousin.


While there, the storage lockers were broken into and some people's stuff had been taken, so a neighbor came at 9:30pm and told us grandma's locker had been broken into and that the police were down there. We didn't answer cause we didn't actually know if they were going to rob her or something, though. So we got scared and started talking about how burglars were gonna come in the middle of the night and eat us D: Turns out the lockers were broken into, but it wasn't granny's. They were mistaken cause granny didn't actually have anything in it, or even a lock on the door. Next day we went and put the lock on, but it took us a long time to actually find the storage room XD Apparently we had walked past it 4 times DX


Went shopping at Metrotown and Crystal Mall a lot. Spent wayyy too much D: It was fun though. We wittnessed someone's bike being stolen though, so that kinda ruined it. We also almost ran someone over cause they were cycling down the road with no helmet or reflectors,and it was dark out, so it was kinda scary D:


Other than that, I am so sick of my sister right now. She never seems to shut up  Apparently, when we were little she would do stuff and I would get blamed D:



Finally was able to play Twilight Princess. It's so awesome it hurts :D&hearts;"

Right after school me and my dad went to all the electronic stores around so that I could get the 30g video iPod I had  been wanting for a while. We went to EVERY store : Future Shop, Visions, Best Buy, EVERYWHERE. NONE of them had any. We didn't think we would find any anywhere else, but my dad wanted to go to A&B Sound, just for the heck of it. It turned out that they had 3 black ones left. So we got my iPod for $433. 

Wow. I think that was my longest post yet."

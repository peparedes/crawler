"event","It's late in the evening
She's wondering what clothes to wear
She puts on her make up
And brushes her long blonde hair
And then she asks me
Do i look alright
And i say yes, you look wonderful tonight

We go a party
And everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady
That's walking around with me
And then she asks me
Do you feel alright
And i say yes, i feel wonderful tonight

I feel wonderful
Because i see the love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all
Is that you just don't realize
How much i love you

It's time to go home now
And i've got an aching head
So i give her the car keys
She helps me to bed
And then i tell her
As i turn out the light
I say my darling, you were wonderful tonight
Oh my darling, you were wonderful tonight

This song makes me think of my kayla so much every time that i hear it. I just wanted her to know that i love her so much and that there is nothing that i wouldnt do for her. I think that i may have finally found the one girl that i have always been looking for."

"event","HELL YA!!! i finally got my god damn car back, but im still grounded from going places. though they have been letting me hang out with my girl freind a lot lately, maybe its because they know she is such a good influence on me. oh man i missed my baby so much(the car) and i miss all my freinds from c-ville too.i got it on a countdown till the 23 but i think ill get it back sooner because my g-parents are going on vacatioon and not taking me but i dont care i have been to las vegas too many times as it is(not a fun place unless you can drink, gamble, or go into one of the strip clubs).and this weekend i am having a super bowl party at my house with me, my girlfriend and some of our freinds(josh should come but ya know he is too cool to stay here but he has to go to muncie, but its ok i forgive you). well thats all i have for tonight. later yall!!!"

"event","Dancin' in the dark
Middle of the night
Takin' your heart
And holdin' it tight
Emotional touch
Touchin' my skin
And askin' you to do
What you've been doin' all over again
Oh, it's a beautiful thing
Don't think I can keep it all in
I just gotta let you know
What it is that won't let me go

It's your love
It just does somethin' to me
It sends a shock right through me
I can't get enough
And if you wonder
About the spell i'm under
Oh, it's your love

Better than I was
More than I am
And all of this happened
By takin' your hand
And who I am now
Is who I wanted to be
And now that we're together
I'm stronger than ever
I'm happy and free
Oh, it's a beautiful thing
Don't think I can keep it all in
And if you asked me why I've changed
All I gotta do is say your sweet name

Oh, it's a beautiful thing
Don't think i can keep it all in
I just gotta let you know
What it is that won't let me go

It's your love
It's your love

well i think i may have found someone worth spending my time with and i really like her a lot too. i dont know what it is about her she just gets me every time she smiles and i love it. i love being around her and when were together im always happy. i dont think anyone else has ever made me feel the way she makes me feel. well thats all i have for tonight!!!!!!!!!"

But be careful that your lover doesn't use you to their advantage, and be sure that they are not seeking too much control.

"event","wow my very first entry, so this is new to me but how can i get caught again, ya know. i thought i covered my tracks pretty well but i guess i didnt, wow invade my privacy a little more. for those of you that are wondering heres what happened: me and josh go to this party on new years eve right so ya know i drink a little nothing serious didnt get completely smashed if ya know what i mean, but the thing is for me to go anywhere i had to give my grandparents the phone # of the house i was staying at but i didnt want to give them the number of this house cause there wouldnt be anyone sober to answer the phone, so i call up my buddy cody and ask him to cover for me and i would owe him one so he was like ok man. but i came home the next day i wasnt hung over or anything and i had a  good day with  my family ya know shootin some guns with my grandpa and what not but i also talked to some friends on yahoo(brittany and caitlin...dont worry guys it was my dumbass fault for leaving it on duh) but anyway so this is the part i hate they went through my message archive and found my chats with the girls and called codys mom, who they are good freinds with, and ask her to aske him a bunch of questions about that night. and of course she got it out of him, cause for those of you that dont know codys mom she is a little intimidating, and so he leaked but i dont blame him they already knew anyway so what did it matter. so now im stuck on my ass till my b-day(feb 23) with no car and no cell phone and hardly anything else to do."

My girlfriend and I are doing much better now, my bills are getting caught back up, my family and I have talked and things are ok there again. Just so much stuff hit me at once that I was unsure as to how to handle it... I got to spend some time with Adam the other day, he always makes my heart smile..  yay for adam. I am still trying to get some stuff in my life straightened out right now, but I think things are going to be ok. I am really worried for a couple of my friends that are having some problems with coming back to high point and I really really hope that they both get back in, good luck guys I am here if you need to talk."

"event","So yeah this Christmas was wonderful..  Well, ok so yeah that was sarcasm to the extreme... My Christmas started out amazing thanks to by beautiful fiancee... then ended in me punching my brother in law in the face.. literally punching him in the face...  Rewind let's take a look at what happened... It started off with Erica giving me the most amazing Christmas gift ever.. which is private so I won't say ne thing else on that note, but then we went to her family's home and did Christmas there. It was really nice being in an environment that I felt wanted and loved. Then I went home.. yay... again with the sarcasm... Things were going ok until about an hour before I had to be at work. My sister, Mother, niece, and myself were playing a game of Mad Gab the dvd version and having a good time.. Then my sister started cheating because we were killing them, but it was all in good humor just a game no biggie..  My niece goofing off threw the remote at my sister, but she threw it a lil to hard and hit her in the mouth and busted her lip.. go sarah... Ne way at that time my brother in law and mother started yelling at each other he gets in an outrage and starts throwing shit around and my mother stands up in front of him at this time he knocks her to the ground... Big mistake..  I may not get a long with my mother at times, but don't ever lay a hand on her.. so I jump over top of my niece and punch the fucker in the face..  and start throwing more punches.. but someone pulled me off of him.. kinda blacked out at that moment not to sure who or how..  ne way so then there is a huge huge fight with everyone and I ended packing everything I could and left to go to work..  So yeah basically I am going to have to move in with a friend of mine now and I refuse to have anything to do with my family ever again.. Yay for the holidays.. merry fucking christmas everyone.."

"event","Ok so my steps towards working on me are still in progress. tonight was def. a good night for it though. I finally had a chance to sit down and talk to someone that I hold very close to my heart. I finally got to tell her how I felt about what had happened in the past and how much I really do care about them as a person and as a friend. It was really nice to be able to get some of the things I have wanted to say out in the open and it was time to finally get to apologize for the way I treated her last year. She is an amazing person and a really good friend and I am lucky to have her in my life. May our friendship grow and we get back the closeness we once shared a long time ago. I missed our friendship so much...   On another note, I went out with a big group of friends tonight to Jake's and had a marvelous time. I got dressed up a lil bit in a ridiculous outfit that ended up being a pretty big hit. I finally got to watch the L Word Season three and although many of you may laugh it kinda opened my eyes to a few things. Life is short and you never know what tom. will bring so we have to live for today and make it a day to remember. I love so many people in my life and I want them all to realize how much they truely mean to me. I am lucky to have so many people in my life that can make me happy and forget all the pain I am feeling inside. Thank you all for a great night.."

"event","so yeah..  it's getting harder and harder to not call her now... I was on campus the other day because I had to get some stuff and I dropped Andrew off at Finch which meant I drove past Millis...  Why do I keep tormenting myself over it all????  I have fought over calling her so much, I even have reasons to call her, but I thought I had deleted her number so I couldn't call.. Found out last night that I hadn't actually deleted it though when I was trying to get in touch with some people to hang out. It took everything in me, but I deleted it then. I know she is probably so much better off now that things are over between us. I don't want to call her and then just put us back in the same situation that we were before. That would be so selfish of me to do to her. I am really proud of myself for trying to stick with this. I mean it's hard to be single for me... I am not used to it. I have had girls flirt with me and want to hang out with me on that level, but I have held out. I am actually doing really well.... When I am finally ready to be in a relationship I want to take it slow. Unlike all of the times before. I am really working hard this time.. I just hope it pans out in the end..."

"event","So here I am 24 yo and pretty much doing nothing right now..  all I ever do is work, work, work and more work..  Things in my life are kinda fuzzy for me. As you all know I ended things with Lauren over fall break.. Can honestly say it was hard as hell and I have missed her like crazy, but I am so scared of getting hurt again. It has taken everything in me not to call her up and see how she is doing..  To be honest I still ask mutual friends how she is... I just really need time to work on me and I can't do that in a relationship..  Blah blah blah I know you are all saying I told you so, but yeah I got the hint..  I have been single for a lil while and I am not enjoying the not having someone there, but I am enjoying being able to work on me. It would be unfair for me to get in a relationship right now anyway because I work so damn much. I like my job, but here lately I am starting to get really pissed off. I wasn't suppose to work till 11 tonight, but I was here at 3 because the new girl is a useless biatch and just had to have this weekend off... Which caused me to completely miss caberet and I am soooo upset about that.. I really wanted to see all of my friends in it. I love live music and I am so proud of them all for doing it. Maybe I will get to spend more time with people once I get a few hours away from the job. Which would be nice, but who knows when that will be. I am suppose to be interviewing for the management position, but again who knows when that will be. anyway..just wanted to update since I never get to see anyone that often.. I love you guys and I am here if you need me .. just gotta call since I am not around campus anymore"

I really like this job and I can do my homework when I work third shift, so that is a plus. To bad I never go to classes to get the homework.. I have got to start doing something about that. I have tried so hard to not miss classes and to actually care about going to them, but all I want to do is stay in bed and sleep all day. Maybe it's because I have not been sleeping good lately, or maybe I am just at the point where I am so sick of being here I just don't want to go anymore. So me and Lauren got back together once again..  and like all the other times we have already broken back up. Fun times all around. I have got some major trust issues that I need to deal with before I try to be in a relationship anyway. I am always so damn paranoid. I have no clue what's going on with me lately, but I keep getting sucked further and further into a depression that I just can't handle anymore. I try so hard to make things ok, but it's not working anymore. I put on my lil smile and I go about my day trying to be the fun to be around Heather that everyone expects, but I am not sure how much longer I can take it. I have a meeting set up with Kim on Friday. Maybe if I talk to a professional it will help. Money issues are killing me too. I have got to stop wasting my money all of the time. I feel so out of touch with my friends now too. I mean I love the people to death, but I never really talk to anyone at all anymore. I have started hanging out with John a couple of times, and I had a great time with that, but what happened to all of my friends that I had this summer????  I never see any of them anymore. Anyway I have got to get back to work now..  yayness"

Then on Sunday night I had to be taken to ER for some stomach problems, fun times all around. I was in the hospital till 5am.

"event","So many things have been going on in my life. I am currently kinda in a relationship with someone that a lot of people have never heard of. Her name is Jennifer.. I know I know how many damn jennifers am I going to date already. Things are pretty good for the most part. We do argue a lot, which sux, but when not arguing things are amazing. We have so much fun together. We have both laughed so hard that we cried. I can show my goofy side to her and she loves it. We are not officially a couple yet though so we shall see how that goes. I am working full time for a factory now. It is really really hard. I have sweat so much that I have started to loose weight. Well, between sweating and not hardly eating anything I am loosing the weight. I can actually fit into some old jeans again. I haven't been drinking much either. Until last night, I got a lil wasted. I was hanging out with some really cool people though so it was a lot of fun. I did however have my ex hitting on me and trying to talk me into having sex with her. No biggie though, until I saw her livejournal and read that she had just gotten laid by someone she can't even remember the other night. That's her business don't get me wrong, but don't lie to me and say I was the last one you were with. I told her I would never talk to her again if I caught her in another lie and either she lied to me or she lied online. Ofcourse I am waiting to find out what elaborate story she can come up with to hide this one. Sorry lil bitter about that..  anyway I am going back to bed I have to get up here in a lil bit and go to my moms"

"event","Ok so me and Lauren last like a week maybe two that last go. I couldn't take anymore lies so I told her that it was over. I am so sick of dealing with all of the drama. So I started moving on with my life and she was trying to get me back, but I can't trust anything she says to me so I was pushed further and further away. In the mean time I started hanging out with Paige and Jennifer a lot. Well, one thing led to another and I started talking to Jennifer again. Things were going great between us, we worked out a lot of the stuff that stopped us from working out the first time around. We are not officially back together, one I know I still had a lot of unresolved issues with Lauren and it would not be far to Jennifer if I tried to be in a relationship until it was settled, two.. deep down I still love Lauren. I don't understand why she had such a hold on me. I guess because I have never been in love like that before. I just wish things could have went smoother between us. I hate that they ended the way that they did, but I do need to get her out of my life so I can move on. I care about Jennifer, that much is obvious. I still don't want to be in a relationship right now though. I know I have a lot to work on myself before trying to be with someone else. Some people think I am playing games with Jennifer, and that is so not the case. I love spending time with her and she really makes me happy when I am around her. I am not going out there looking for anyone else either. I joke around about going women hunting, but that is def. not my prerogative. ok so I have written once again a book. I will cut to the whole point of me feeling bad. I did something tonight that I feel completely ashamed about. I was holding Jennifer when lauren came out of the caf.(by holding I mean I was standing behind her with my arms around her) I know that many people that know the whole deal with Lauren would say that I did nothing wrong compared to what she has done to me, but I still feel like shit. I don't want her to hurt anymore than she already does. Regardless of how spiteful she is to me, that just was out of character and I wish I could apologize to her, but I do not want to have any contact so I guess I will just have to deal with it on my own. Any advice? Do you guys think I am a total ass because of it???"

Yes I know, I know... Be careful.. I have heard it a thousand times. I have told myself that a thousand times. Many of my friends think I am an idiot to give this another shot, and to be frank I don't really care. I know that from day one I have not been able to get her out of my head no matter how bad it got between us and I also know that she has been the only girl I have ever loved like this. I think Sarah is really the only one that has pushed me to give our love another shot. She has talked to Lauren and me through this little endeavor and she said that she knows Lauren loves me and wants to be with me more than anything else in this world. I see that in her eyes and know that it's true, but I have built this wall around my heart that is stopping me from throwing myself back into a situation that I did last time we were together. It got really really bad between us. As Lauren says, ""We did everything you could do to push eachother away and we are still right here."" That is so true, and they always say that the first year is the hardest you will ever go through and if you make it through that then you are meant to be. I hope that is the case, guess we will see how it all pans out."

"event","So this weekend ended up being a really good one. I got to see Mama T and Em. Love those girls. OH and I got kicked out of my first club. Yay for being so wasted that I decided that I should give my underage friend a drink of my smirnoff in the middle of the dance floor. It was a funny experience though. Other than that I have been doing a lot of thinking about me and my life in general. Things will start changing. I am going to bed now because I am exhausted.. gotta get up for class in 5 hours.."

"event","So I have been pretty busy lately. Just wanted to give an update on my life as of right now. Last night I did the hardest thing I have ever done. I told Lauren that I didn't want to talk to her for a while to give myself time to get over her. We have said that the relationship was over a month ago, but sometimes she says things that gives me mixed signals and all of those feelings come back, but I know we don't need to be together right now. I am still in love with her though and it is going to be hard to let her go, but I have to. On a brighter note, Matti and I have started going to the gym and started a diet, well not really a diet per say, but we are eating healthier. I loved working out. Oh and Matti and I have gotten a lot closer again, which is def. a great thing. I have also gotten a lot closer to Beth and Natacia as well. Not that I wasn't close to them before, but now I actually get to see them and spend time with them. Everything in my life is going pretty well, with the exception of my job, but I have learned to not let that get to me as much. I owe a lot to my friends for being there for me. I love you all and thank you so much for your support and letting me confide in you. OHHHH can't believe I almost forgot one of the most important people that has been there..  Sarah!!!!!  She is one of my best friends now and someone I know that will be a true friend no matter what. I love ya girl."

"event","So I am starting my 5 day vacation as of right now. I am so excited about that. Lot's of stuff has been going on this break. Last night me and Lauren decided to let go of each other and our relationship. We already broke up, but we still talked to each other and it was like we were dating, but not really. Last night we decided that we are just in completely different places in our lives and we want to remain friends, but nothing else. I love her, that is effident, but I know that I am really ready to settle down and be with someone that I know I can be with the rest of my life. Don't get me wrong, Lauren really is an amazing girl, and if things were different I could see myself with her, but she is not ready for that and we kept trying to make it happen regardless. It was nice tonight though. It wasn't like a fight or anything like that. We were just talking and we both agreed that she needed to deal with the things going on in her life and not have our relationship to put anymore stress on her. Same with me. I am def. ready to settle down with someone, but I need to focus on school right now. I have got to bring up my grades and if I get the job that I want then I will be working 2nd shift, which means I will be going straight to work right after school and no social life except for the weekends. I really do want the job though. It would be perfect for me. I know that most of my journal entries seem to be about me having some type of drama to deal with, but just so you all know that is not the case all of the time. I only right in my journal when something is on my mind or bothering me. Maybe I should include more of the good times so people don't get the wrong idea. Well, just to let everyone know..   despite the fact that I am going to miss Lauren, I am happy right now."

"event","Update on my life..   I ended up hurting two people over this last weekend and I am very very sorry about that. I never wanted to hurt anyone, but I can't change the events that took place. On a brighter note, Lauren and I are officially dating again. We worked through some stuff that was bothering us and are still working on things, but I think it is really going to be different with us now. My mom has gotten a lil discouraged about going back to school, but I am working on that and trying to help her out as much as possible. Things at my job are still going shitty. I hate my boss. I seriously just wish he would walk off the face of the Earth never to return again. I am going to go job hunting this Friday with my mom.. fun times.."

"event","ok so things in my life have been up and down lately. I have pretty much written off all of the people that have done me wrong in the past. I told you that I was going to be pushed to far.. and I was. Now I am working on friendships with people that I truely care about and have been great friends so far. Sarah and I had a rocky start, considering the situation, but we have put all of that behind us and ended up becoming really good friends. I usually talk to her a couple of times a day and I miss her now that is back in Texas for the week. I have started getting to know Katie in Charlotte as well. We talk everyday too. Things between Lauren and I are amazing. I still get scared sometimes, but that is natural after everything we went through. Oh and by the way to all of those that never got to hear the whole story, she wasn't the only one that made mistakes in our relationship. We both did and I think we are both trying to work through that. My family life is good. My niece is here visiting for Thanksgiving. I love that kid. OHHHH and big news!!!!!!!!!!   I finally got to see my son after a year and a half. I spent every moment I could with him for three days. He has grown up so much. He is 3 and a half now and talks up a storm. Jen is actually wanting to move home now. We settled a lot of things when she was here and it is nice being able to be friends with her. Oh and my mom is now unemployed, they finally shut down the plant she worked at, however good news is she is going back to school to get her certification in Medical assisting. I am so proud of her. My sister is loosing a lot of weight. She is looking really good and I am proud of her too. Well, that is the update..  later"

There are some things that I am working on to make my life better and to fully get back to the person I have been for so long. I don't know what happened, but I fell back into the old routine and feelings. It won't be long till I get to that point again. Matter of fact I am pretty much almost there. I took all of the things that was bothering me and I let it go.. I stopped hanging on to it all. I feel so much better. I am still really heart broken over Lauren, but to be honest I think if it is meant to be it is going to work itself out. It's not hard to tell that I am still in love with her or that I really want to be with her. However I am to the point now that I am just letting things happen, not pushing anything. I know that if she wants to be with me then it will happen. If not, well then hopefully we will be able to be friends. Aight I am going to get off here.."

"event","I went back to WV this weekend. I saw my Uncle for the first time in about 7 or 8 years. Growing up I usually spent a little bit of time with him and my Aunt over the summer. I used to love going to their home in the ""hollar"". There was no one around for miles and you had to take a four-wheel drive vehicle to get to the house. It was so beautiful and I have so many childhood memories there. I was worried about what they would say to me about the way I look now. The piercings and short hair, see my uncle has no clue that I am gay. I can't tell him either. I will be honest I don't want to tell him. What is the point? My uncle is dying. I don't think the doctors really expected him to live this long. He is twice his normal size and can barely get around. He's had 6-8 heart attacks, multiple triple bi-pass and double bi-pass surgeries, and open heart surgery.  He has been through a lot and it has made him so humble. I felt so out of place at first, but then the sweet side of my uncle came out and made me feel at home. I had forgotten how much he meant to me until this weekend. Now I regret not ever going to spend more time with him. I guess you can never take back time though..  This weekend was hard as hell and truly an eye opener for many things.."

"event","So I am doing pretty good considering what is going on..  Me and Lauren are completely through. Yeah yeah yeah I know..  it should have been done a month ago, but I was holding on to the fact that I loved her. Nothing has changed as far as that goes. I am still in love with her..  no matter how much I try to say I am not.. I am ..   I tried so hard to be mean to her last night.. I want to hate her .. I want to never want to be with her again, but it's a lot harder than it would seem..  I can't help my feelings.. I can't help the fact that no matter what I want things to go back to the way they were when we first got together. So moving on to other matters... I have not been spending time with my friends lately.. that is so about to change. I have to get out and stop letting myself be depressed all of the time. So I have chosen the ""things couldn't be better"" mask. I am getting along really well with some that I thought I would never like and I am actually getting very annoyed by others that I thought I was close too. I will say though.. I had a chance to talk to Joe a lot over break and I missed him so much. I love him to death. I am also getting closer to a few people that I have just started talking to gotta love making new friends and mending old friendships.."

I tried turning on the light to back away the darkness, but it only lit up a small area. 
I stood in that area and watched as the shadows danced around me. 
They look so much happier than I feel. 
Why is it so dark here?
Should I venture into the darkness and see where it takes me?
Or, should I stay here in the safe haven of my light.
Why am I so alone here?
I feel like I am going to be stuck here forever. 
I want out. 
I want out more than anything, but how can I do that?
I think I am loosing my mind. 
I am going crazy trapped in this world. 
I just sit here and let the memories of the good times play over and over in my head. 
Things used to so great.
Or, did they just seem like they were.
Maybe things were just as bad then, but we wore better masks. 
Is it sad to want those masks back?"

"event","So lately I have been going through a lot. I haven't really talked to anyone because it's not going to do me any good to talk about it so why bother other people right? I have not slept good since Sat. night. That night I only slept because I took medicine that made me drowsy. I can't sleep and it is killing me. lately I have been going through so much shit at work. I hate my job and the people I work for. I am miserable there, but it is the best paying job I have ever had and lord knows I need the money. I am so sick of having to work all of the time. I sit back and watch so many people that have someone paying for their college so all they have to do is go to class and have fun with their friends. Must be nice. Don't get me wrong I am happy that they can do that. I wish I could as well. I am so tired of trying to balance school, work, family, and friends. I can't take it anymore. I just wish I could make everything stop. Lately I have been feeling so useless. I can't seem to get anything right anymore or get myself to care. I am burnt out. I am so tired of all of the drama in my life. I have disassociated myself from my friends because of it. No I am not saying it's their fault. I just can't handle anything else right now. I am failing my Pre Cal class and I can't force myself to do better. I hate the class and the teacher, not to mention I don't even need the class anymore. I switched my major to accounting. Only problem with that is now two out of 4 classes I am taking are pointless and I can't drop them because I have to be full time. Things have been better with Lauren, I am just so scared of getting hurt again. I seriously just wish I could erase my existence altogether. Don't worry not in a suicidal way. I just wish there was a way to make it all go away..  if even for a simple week or two. I just want a vacation to get my shit together, is that to much to ask? I just want to sleep, a deep sleep."

I am sick of trying to make people happy

nothing
nothing but a broken soul

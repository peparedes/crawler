"event","Blogging seems to be getting popular, and I think I may have the hang of how this livejournal works.  I thought it may be fun to share some of my dating experiences with the world.  Actually, I plan on just sharing most of them with my friends.  

As some of you may know, my dating life seems to be fairly comical these days.  I began to think that it really is not fair to keep all of the laughs to myself.  Maybe some of you will laugh with me, some will laugh near me, some may even laugh at me.  Either way, at least we are all laughing!

How did I get inspired to be technologically inspired enough to create a blog?  I was thinking that my dating life could easily be a sitcom.  However, my friend Sarah B thought that it may be better as a best seller.  Alissa, on the other had, suggested a blog.  Thanks Alissa - great idea.  

Unfortunately, at this moment I have no dates this weekend, so not much to say about the future.  We can all however enjoy some of the past, some more recent than others....."

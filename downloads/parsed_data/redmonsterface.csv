"event","should we be so removed from this wanderlust. should we really need to be taken away and made to do this? how could a society created by its own people could make it so that you would need to work to be happy? or am i working to be unhappy. it seems that though time ticks by i find myself with less and less to say, because i feel like ive said it all. maybe its substance abuse, and my mother is correct in her ideas on smoking, for example. its curious that she would smoke for so long, and now that shes been clean shes kicked it into gear, or maybe its because shes on antidepressants. heh, suppresion of humanity i suppose, but whatever, she can be mad at me for being moody. whats the real source of this idea in my head, i feel like all those people whome i dont understand, and i dont like myself when im like this. i just had this episode not to long ago, is it already time to play this game again? why cant i do anything the RIGHT way. apprehensive ideas stuck in my head because of correctness, or courage. i find im not as brave as i used to be. i dont feel as indestructable as i used to, i feel like im not taking enough risks. risks like not difusing the situation, i feel like im some sort of bottled water, waiting to combust but unable to. i want to get into that situation and fight out of it, or get whooped, problem is im to smart to do that. i could have fought whatshis face last weekend, and i didnt because.... well it was just a bottle of sprite, why bother, besides im the new guy, the odd one out, ill just pass it by like i wish no one else would. ive been programed with practicality of this sort. if you think about it, getting into fights isnt really worth it, but i feel like i need to do something. this aggression has been building up inside me for a while, and i need some release. lets face it, i need a good fuck. sarcasm aside though, i cant wait to start working. im thinking that sort of physical activity will do me a lot of good. ive always felt better after doing something physical, like with martial arts (fucking lamest phrase ever. i prefer operation kick ass)

"event","while im on the ball, you know what i fucking hate? emphasized words in emo lyrics stolen from other people. now i know i quote other things, like the yeats poem in my away message, or the occasional rage quote, but i didnt take it and gang it to make it look like it means something. that poem i put there because i still have it fucking memorized, and ever now and then i sit there and look at my life and say, bitch youze be a stone, what was i thinking?.....



what was i talking about....


right, love crap, the kind of thing that makes you want to stick your head in some door and slam it a lot... something like

love is an armadillo
if you find it racing
catch it and then you will SEE
love at first sight, where were WE
this stuff gives me the shits
i think ill PEE

where is chris when i need him.... but you get the point, id quote someone else, but id hate to hurt their feelings and tell them that i want to eat my own foot, and its their fault. nevertheless, i think that i jsut saw the most rediculous thing ever on conan, a band that looked so happy and wonderfully hawaiigay that i think i want to murder a tellatubby, or just go up with them and help in the new rendition of the classic akuna muttatah or however the fuck the pig spells it. now why cant we go on random road trips and elave school? thats my new goal, im gonna go get a part time job, scrape together a couple hundred bucks and just dissapear for maybe about a week when it gets warm. sleep in my car and eat at dinners and such for a while... maybe pennsylvania? or ill just retreat into maine? too far away, maybe somewhere farther south on the coast, ive never been to maryland, well, the real maryland..... cause im jsut a SOUL whose intentions are GOOD, oh lord, please dont let ME be MISUNDERstood. i like this term ive been using in my away messages, Municipal Box Car Police, Newtown in a dishtray. have a GOOD night, and dont let the bed BUGS bite, bitch."

"event","okay this has been bothering me for some time... ever see the postman? biggest dick suck pretentious bullshit movie ever. Now ive seen the other costner mininotatimegoingonnow movie, waterworld, and i enjoyed it. it was a shitty movie but it had a sort of mad max appeal without it being made in the early 80's. but the postman takes the fallout wonderwork and sticks a big dick in its ear, stealing the brotherhood of steel (and putting an 8 on their shoulders and making them ride horses and suck dick) making the main hero some dude who sends mail. thats right, he sends mail in the post apocalypse, not take tom petty's power lines and make them run power that hes generating (yes tom petty is playing tom petty, but kevin costner is the postman, go figure... faggots....) or maybe finding a way to unite the new world, no he delivers santas letters to the north pole... thank you kevin costner, i hope you choke on a banana and slip on a dick...

the best part of this fucking 3 hour finasco is that they spent so much time on him reading the mail and sucking dick, that at the end when the good guys (gathered in a matter of 20 hours or so) equaling the number of highly trained brother hood of steel jerk off military monsters, that he ran out of time and decided to challenge the evil general to combat. good thing he believed in the united states, because i think if they had jsut blown themselves to fuck, i wouldnt be believin in it. i mean thats like saying you believe in your father, who sexually molested you and beat you with beer bottles.... 

want to see a better movie with equally bad acting, see The Warriors, it has some of the best fight seens ive ever seen. i was lying about the acting though, the postman is worse, cost more, and took longer to watch.... god i hate my life... im so glad we have progressed...."

meanwhile i suppose the best thing thats going on is that in the future i intend to start on that project which ive been tossing around inside my head for the past month or so. meanwhile it probably wont be for a while, but thats alright. i suppose the weekend of alchohol is helpful for forgetting the few things that do kick around and stop to say, wut up biotch. ah well, only a temporary fix for a permanent problem, so self development here i come again. the next thing would be sleep, also good for a delay on things i dont want to think about, but alas i cant escape school and the things i dislike there, sounds like a franz ferdinand song. maybe im more of the ferdinand the bull type than the franz. i got stung by a sort of bee, and jumped around and people said, hey look at that. now things are back to their low still, i suppose i should be used to that? is that how its supposed to be? should i be content with my situation and not be bothered by those around? or should i say something? ah well, to swing the bat? maybe later."

found in the unwritten word
stand and gaze at its magnificence
realize that this isnt what we wanted.

terrible decension
reverbarated concesion
anthems of what this means
singing to the old factory
hunting for the crowd
in search for unshroud

nonsensicle sence
masotarded flabergastion
distrust of leviathans desquise
read between what these worlds mean
and see only the real face of facade

corrupted discription of my face
discover these underlying graces
if they really exist i wonder why

crippled roses crush the stone tablets
throwing the world around as feathers
disclose these inner devils
strength in depression, still floundering in the dusk
a fish in deep water, sullen and sunken
drawn in eyes,
keeping these thought from escaping
nothing but inhibitions
this enebriation cant console
blocking the past events and still i want to go home

lost home cant find its way back to me
wandering the dark streets of his way
delayed rebuttal to the old saints

stare at these minds of the lost scorpion
fiery toungue of my black abyss cant be lost
ive corrupted this old mind with new ambitions
disclose this stream of conciousness 
judge the scripted spontinuity

again returning to this flabergastion
these things which weve created
of course they live in speculation
and of course there is nothing we can say
nothing we can say besides im sorry

looking through these clouds
cant discover what this should be
lost in the temporary happiness 
looking at this americana for whatever may be
turning this nothing into whatever we can
just to survive these feelings of MTV"

if only he knew
or
why does everyone hate me

the best thing about them is to make up what they are about. like the first one, if only he knew, could be about their pet orangutan who she has fallen madly in love with. 

but yeah, i decided im never having sex again. of course thats a bold faced lie because, well, i like sex. but nevertheless i think ive managed to mess things up pretty bad, with jackie that is. maybe its a guy syndrome, i can think of 2 others who waited too long before they settled on their final decision... i guess its all in the learning. eitherway i need to get my own life back on track... i need to do some things, like go to college (a novel idea) and make some sort of movie.... blah ive taken on the laziness of newtown. 

whatever, just stare, and live the nightmare. gotta love rage

there is one thing i did right though, i didnt lose my temper even in the face of frustration. hmmm, another topic now, alliteration... see a lot of people have the narrow minded misconception that alliteration is the procession of the same begining letter. dont worry sara, if your reading this, that wasnt directed to you, but rather to my favoite english teacher in the whole wide world, The Penguin bitch cunt she is. anyways, its really sad i cant think of a good example now though, because usually i end up using it in common speech, but whatever. alfie prolly could come up with some 25centers in a row that would make sence. sleep... roight, im out"

"event","heh, i was going to write stuff in my profile, then i realized i liked what i have quoted there better than any emo piece of shit i could possible write. realization? im being an asshole, blame it on school or on expectations, it really doesnt matter. was a dick to jackie, was a dick to my mother, both really do mean well... i suppose there was a reason to be upset, but maybe i feel stupid because i let myself be hurt by it.. whatever

i guess some things havnt changed like i thought they had, i am still insecure and let things, relationship things, get to me. i guess this is why i didnt want to get tied down, whats the point in worrying and second guessing. i guess part of it there are a few things i just dont like, one is being a second option. id rather just not be considered then have things be like, well i should invite him.. i guess i feel cheap. pretty stupid, in reflection, but it will go away eventually.

funny, same songs i listen to when i get in a funk keep coming around, such as life. im a moody mother fucker. sometimes i wonder why, why everything. why am i bothered with, why arent i better... at everything... like ben says, im a jack of all trades type. problem with that is im not really good at anything. what will people remember me for? i dont know what i would remember me for. like there is this shell and i just cant figure myself out of it. ah whatever, im going for a walk i think."

"event","""maybe i act on confused behavior.""

i havnt written in a while so i feel the need to write something. life is good, but the feeling of being tied down is something i dont really have a craving for. there is, however, the craving for sexual attention, like all teenagers. meanwhile those seem to come hand in hand, but whatever. no wonder the americans passed a ""peace pipe,"" seems like the best conversation is made in its precence, then again thats not really what i want to write about. i suppose what i want to write about is nothing at all, music rocks though.

my shell: its hard for me to get outside of myself and be myself. interesting paradox eh? meanwhile i have trouble being confident, the example i gave chris was with girls, i am the most uneasy motherfucker when it comes to girls, probably because i have trouble with conversation. ill talk your ear off but i cant talk about anything. so i guess im an emokidparadoxbitch? something like that. right now i wish i wasnt alone, i want to be with a girl. this is why highschool sucks, i think im ready to be on my own, i need a job though. i could see myself making a job, in fact personally i think the best job would be to make movies right from the get-go. if you think about it, farley is into audio, im into video, AE is made of genius. i have friends who are interested in writting, and into video, and i dont want to go to college, and i dont really need to in order to do what i want. if you think about it, i could get edmund to run my movies, i could play them over charter, even though charter doesnt pay it doesnt matter. i could sell the movies for a couple buck, couple that with music videos for AE, and some other videos of us just being us and i could make my own buisness. couple that with selling cars to teens id be all set.

""girls, all i really want is girls""
i was tied down for 3 years, i dont really have any desire to be a sleeze but i dont see the need to be in a relationship relationship. even with the one im in now, the reason i didnt say ""hey do you want to go out with me"" (the pop way of saying you want to be my girlfriend) is because i didnt want that. i wanted someone i could have a good time with. i did get that, dont get me wrong there, and im not really sure how things are recieved on the other side, but thats not the issue. the issue is me thinking too much, a trait i have in common with chris. in a lot of ways, im a bridge between chris and say nick. my thoughts are fucked, but im still chill and logical. my thoughts are good though, like chris', just out of order. 

""the ugly truth""
sometimes i wonder about people. today i made a comment, which was blown out of proportion, and it just made me think.. id rather be outside sitting around somewhere with nice eye candy than in a basement playing video games, i dont know why you would trash that. i dont see how a person who spend their time with such mundane habits can bash something like that... he didnt really understand, but i know hes not the only one.

""children of the earth!""
i suppose i got nothing else to say, other than im gonna crash and sleep. good to write my mind for a bit. i really like my friends, thats a perk eh?

i need a CB Handle, help me out people."

"event","so today! i got up and jumped out of bed and screamed, ""oh lord! DAMN IT FEELS GOOD TO BE ALIVE!"" then, i realized i had english first period, so i killed 3 kittens (2 with masturbation, 1 with mastication) and smashed my car into a grandma, all before first period. after this i suffered through my class of psychodrama, and the day went on as zombieish as possible, and i got to italian class, the teacher is crazy and i have friends in the class how bad can that be! so i go in, and guess who has assigned seats! THATS RIGHT! period 8 italian... so i sit in the very front, yay. i hate assigned seats, they make a class go from barable and mildly entertaining to something uneducational and worthy of much spite.... so after school, begining and ending on a bad note, i ran home, smashed my pet goffer's teeth in, stabbed a helpless pedestrian with a walker, and then went to the hospital to apply for a job, but they turned me down because i was holding a dead squirl and 4 more dead kittens.

the moral of the story is, dont have assigned seats because it makes people do things you dont want to think about."

english is still the bane of my existance. no matter how i try (yes, marcus schulz, trying!) i still get a 65. one would think that after 2 re-writes AND prewritting exercises would warant at least a 75. so i look at the papers, maybe they are THAT bad. of course they arent, so im lost. a friend of mine seems to think shes jealous of me, and there is much to envy when your an unhappy penguin, but thats no excuse. the woman accused me of using a thesaurus, not that it would have been a bad thing but the point was that she thought i was using words and didnt know how to use them. example the word exfoliate, usually used for soap, but with a definition like

   1.  To remove (a layer of bark or skin, for example) in flakes or scales; peel.
   2. To cast off in scales, flakes, or splinters.
v. intr.
    To come off or separate into flakes, scales, or layers.

i tend to think it could be used for ideas and the like. but NOOOOOOOOOOOO, cause ideas, a man made concept, cant be compared to flakes or layers! what a ho... and maybe im wrong, but i dont think so, and eitherway there were other things she could have payed attention to, or maybe actually told me HOW to make my paper better rather than underlining, circiling, and putting a question mark... What the fuck does that mean?!?!!?

going to a funeral today, not sure why id spend my day goig to a funeral for someone else's family if i didnt care about other people, and was only concerned with my own affairs. people piss me off sometimes. 

interesting discussion with nicole, gypsies? dunno, wandering around south eastern europe, by the mediteranean sounds like fun to me, then again im too logical and far to fearful for such activities. sometimes i wonder how long it will take me to grow up, or rather grow into being bolder? less blunt more bold. whatever, as is i think im doing ok, even if the ""worldy view"" doesnt warrant such an opinion."

"event","so in poured into this contemplative state. that withdrawl is gone, which is nice. things seems good, but i look to the future. this internship is going to take up my time before vacation, and i want to make some money so i can go on road trips and wander around.... but thats slowly getting pushed out of the way, and this is being thrown at me.... i dont want to not do these things, then again it would most likly be me, and me.... heaven forbid us lowly teens go out and explore... i suppose it was out of the question to even want such a thing, parents are too stuck on the idea of daddy's little girl to let her go and live. i dont really understand it.

THE SHOW, it was good? i dont know, i kinda sucked, and managed to hurt myself playing, which means im out of shape in relationion to my bassing. ill work on that. im sick of stupid insignificant questions, and heaven forbid i say anything about anything that bothers me because the drama duet will get on my case, not hear a word of my speel and just act hurt. i dont understand things sometimes, so again ill just tred water and let things go around again.

FRIENDS, they come in all shapes and sizes, some get neglected and others dont. i feel like i want to be there for all of them, but i think deep down i know that i cant, and probably shouldnt either. eitherway according to molly i give shitty advice half the time, which makes me wonder why people keep asking for it. whatever, billy jeans got my love.

ENGLISH CLASS. so the penguin got pissed at us for being insabordinant. then again she would get pissed at me for laughing in class, heaven forbide i enjoy my english experience. today, whats in store for today, well i dont know but those half days are definatly not for having fun, no sir. and we shouldnt slack off on that paper. as far as im concerned she can suck my cack. i dont even think i feel like clashing with this woman, shes beyond repair and personally for her own sake i hope she gets laid. as disgusting the notion of a monkey fucking a penguin is, in the long run maybe it would clean up the bug up her ass and she could go to being a decent human being instead of a raw fish eating monstrosity. then again, i cant write past college prep, so you probably have no idea what im saying. what a aggrivating blemish on the world."

"event","The main attraction - distraction
Got ya number than nnumber than numb
Empty ya pockets son; they got you thinkin that
What ya need is what they sellin
Make you think that buyin is rebellin
From the theaters to malls on every shore
Tha thin line between entertainment and war
The frontline is everywhere, there be no shelter here
Speilberg the nightmare works so push it far
Amistad was a whip, the truth was feathered and tarred
Memory erased, burned and scarred
Trade in ya history for a VCR

Cinema, simulated life, ill drama
Fourth Reich culture - Americana
Chained to the dream they got ya searchin for
Tha thin line between entertainment and war

There be no shelter here
Tha frontline is everywhere

Hospitals not profit full
Yet market bulls got pockets full
To advertise some hip disguise
View tha world from American eyes
Tha poor adore keep fiendin for more
Tha thin line between entertainment and war
They fix the need, develop the taste
Buy their products or get laid to waste
Coca - Cola is back in the veins of Saigon
And Rambo too, he got a dope pair of Nikes on
And Godzilla pure muthafuckin filler
To keep ya eyes off the real killer

Cinema, simulated life, ill drama
Fourth Reich culture - Americana
Chained to the dream they got ya searchin for
Tha thin line between entertainment and war

American eyes, American eyes...
View the world from American eyes
Bury the past, rob us blind
And leave nothin behind

Just stare
Relive the nightmare"

god

i suppose i believe in something more, or rather i think that some things can be left to faith and inexplicability. dunno, the reason for god is to keep people humane. we are humans after all, but we forget how to be human. whatever, if god keeps people in line, then im glad its there, i follow my own heart.

i dont understand myself. i need to find something to do so im not sitting here having a problem with something that i shouldnt have a problem with. its like im cheating on a girlfriend i dont have, or like i just cheated at monopoly, whats the point, its a game.... whatever, ill figure this out..."

NO!"") but i find myself standing to the side of it a lot more, rather than taking it head on. oh yes, and did you know i spred rumors of complete fact? me and rumors are like oil and water, i hate rumors and always go to the source. or at least thats what i try... whatever i cant really be mad at the person, in fact im not, and havnt been, its just silly.

"event","well, im home from greece. i must say, its probably one of the few countries which breaks the mold of hating americans. the people there were generally quite nice, and in addition you can drink the water, which is a good sign. no one got mugged, or robbed, but there were a few idiots, but thats ok, they will grow out of that. 7 in the morning for CT and for me its about 2 in the afternoon. eitherway, the arcitechture and food definatly blew my socks off, though i must say my favorite times were those spend sitting on a round rock on top of a mountain looking down at the ruins of an ancient fortress and graves. for some reason i felt particularly attracted too the grave of atraeus, and the nearby terrain. i was also quite attracted too posidons temple, but thats no big surprise. Apollo was the shit, and Athena Nike is totally sweet. 

Never the less i have learned a few lessons in greece which are worth sharing, they are as follows;

Lesson 1:
""I need too WC it,"" As we land in the Athens airport we realize there is no bathroom. it took roughly 5 minutes for people too chime in and realize, oh snap, WC is the bathroom. another note on bathrooms, i didnt know you could smoke IN the toilets, but according too air france its not allowd.

Lesson 2:
Mercedes is the Ford of Europe. All of the taxi's are mercedes, and thats not un common. and speaking of cars, make sure they dont hit you because they are trying, watch out.

Lesson 3:
If there is space, you can park there. There are basically no laws on parking in Greece, or europe for that matter. this means that you can park on the streets, sidewalks, allies, or large doorways.

Lesson 4:
Bathrooms..... Europe definatly wins the award for the wierdest fucking bathrooms, not too mention the widest assortment. Everthing from the ass sink and toilet, too the toilet with the flush being a chain, and jsut make sure you dont put your toilet paper in the toilet because you might get an old friend back a few days later. and a note on showers and toilet stalls, the first shower we had the had 2 curtains, and they didnt close, the second the shower curtain was too short, and the thirst had 2 layers in the ""bathtub,"" which was too small for any sane person. needless too say im glad they had floor drains. and on toilet stalls,  apparantly they dont think that anyone larger than 6 foot weighing 160 lbs needs too shit, i dont know how casey managed...

Lesson 5:
Sea Urchins. When its dark out, and you cant see whats in the water, if there are rocks there are probably sea urchins.... the next step in logic is too NOT STEP INTO THE WATER WITHOUT SHOES OR YOU WILL STEP ON ONE!!!! and picking out those spines is no fun... i still have some urchin in my foot, good thing US customs doesnt care.

Lesson 6:
Europe smells like smoke

Lesson 7:
whatever you do, do NOT butter your toast without cutting it first! poor april....

There are a few more but i found these too be the most important. oh, and makes sure you look at the cars, they are all standard and all really small, and i wouldnt recomend driving if you can avoid it on city roads, those mediteraneans are crazy."

its funny how i do pretty well going too a place without knowing anyone. then again, its no big surprise that i always seem too meet someone on the trip, and in addition im rarly totally alone. sometimes it feels like a companionship is missing, like i can stand on my own two feet, and am usually, and there is usually someone there too help me back up when im not doing so well. im babbling dont mind me. whatever, battle star, and a ScArY SpIdEr too you too"

Fret for your figure and
Fret for your latte and
Fret for your hairpiece and
Fret for your lawsuit and

One great big festering neon distraction,
I've a suggestion to keep you all occupied.

Learn to swim.

Fuck L Ron Hubbard and
Fuck all his clones.
Fuck all those gun - toting

Fuck retro anything.
Fuck your tattoos.
Fuck all you junkies and

Learn to swim.

Fuck smiley glad - hands
With hidden agendas.
Fuck these dysfunctional,
Insecure actresses.

Learn to swim.

Cuz I'm praying for rain
And I'm praying for tidal waves
I wanna see the ground give way.
I wanna watch it all go down.
Mom please flush it all away.
I wanna watch it go right in and down.
I wanna watch it go right in.
Watch you flush it all away.

Time to bring it down again.
Don't just call me pessimist.
Try and read between the lines.

I can't imagine why you wouldn't
Welcome any change, my friend.

I wanna see it all come down.
Suck it down.
Flush it down.

probably my favorite tool song."

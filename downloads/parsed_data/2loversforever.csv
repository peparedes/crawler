"event","Wow, so I'm finally fuckin doing it.. I'm living the sober life. And in a weird way it feels good. I'll tell ya one thing... it sure is nice to have money in your pocket. Although $60 isn't alot of money but to still have more then half of it with the weekend almost over is just amazing for me. My parents and I are getting along now. I have a interview at Fort Lauderdale Airport next Wed. I'm very excited about that. I should within a month have an apartment with my boyfriend. His family has money like mine.. But he's got a little more money then my family. His dad is the president of the Fort Lauderdale Yacht Club. Ed and I went to dinner there and between the 2 of us our check came out to $347.62. It's fun living the rich life. Ha. I love it. I'm currently in the halfway house so I can save my money for a month and get the place Ed and I wanna get. Something small for now til we start banking which won't be long from now. I plan on having a car by the end of this year.. I was hoping my b-day but I'm not too sure on that. All I need to do is show my parents that I'm doing the things I need to do and bam, I get a car and help towards an apartment. Life is finally starting to look good and I'm finally at the state of contentment and happiness with someone. Life is good. Anyone wanna chat... 954 735 5107. I should have a cell by next week sometime. Well, I hope everyone else is ok... especially you Julie. I really wish that you could move on from all the bullshit. Start to enjoy life. Its not so bad. If you ever need to talk, please don't hesitate to call. Bye. ~IRis~ <3"

"event","Wow, it's been quite some time for me as well being on livejournal. Anyways, I'm currently seeing someone and it's great not being broke. Let me tell you. I'm really happy right now. It's funny how Matt sits there and says he loves me and wants me back. Being with Stan pisses him off. Lol. I've been through alot in just a short amount of time. But things seem to be getting better now. I'm at FAU writing this. Stan's got a final and so I'm waiting for him to get out. I think we're going to go to South Beach this weekend and stay on the beach in a room. Hit up some clubs and shit. He treats me like I'm a fuckin queen. Better then anyone has ever treated me. He actually listens and understands me better then anyone. we've got like a $1000 right now but we're gonna save most of it because we're gonna get a place of our own. I'm going to be going to college soon and we're both gonna be working so things are definitely looking up for me; finally. :) I also hung out with Krystle. It was only for a couple hours but it was fun. I heard she chilled with Kevin and got in trouble. That sux. I won't go into details because it's not my business to tell. You know, sometimes it takes something really big to make you start over and better yourself. I'm starting over, from scratch. I don't have like anything to my name. I pretty much wear Stans' clothes for now until I can buy myself new ones. Well, I'm out guess I'm pretty tired of typing. Late ~Iris~ <3"

"event","I had the worst experience of my life yesterday. I was arrested for driving without a license, parofinelia, and having oc. My ankles were shackeled together like I was a rapist or something and my hands were handcuffed to a chain that wrapped around my body. Jail is the worst place in the world. I couldn't stop crying and I had no way of contacting anyone because everyone I tired to call had collect call blocked on their phones. It sucked. I got in a 2 a.m. and didn't get out until 3:30 p.m. They gave us gross bologna sandwhiches and the room was freezing cold. I never wanna go back. I have a court date coming up soon and since it's my first offence they might not be too hard on me. I have to have random drug tests and a bunch of other shit and if I fail to not do one thing told, I go str8 to jail. There was one toliet for about 10 girls in the cell with me and no privacy. Anyone and everyone could watch you. It was so horrible. I don't even wanna talk about it anymore. It just hurts too much.  ~Iris~<3"

And I'm supposed to chill with Michelle this weekend. I wonder what we'll wind up doing. Life has been ok I guess. Looking for a job and starting college in August. I might be moving to Davie in a few months with Matt. He gets out of the half way house May 1st. Yay! Man was he right about everyone I've dated. If only I would have listened. Anyways, I should be getting my license soon and I'll have pretty much my own car. Matt will let me drive. I think he's planning on getting a truck or something. Idk. I finally got my ring back thanks to Krystle. I figured Rachel didn't know it was my ring Julie gave to her. Tina's release on her apt. isn't getting renewed and she has nowhere to go. Her parents won't let her move in. That sux. I helped my friend Suzie move out of the hotel room the other day. It was so messy. Tina told me I'm such an awesome person because I always try to help people out as much as I can, which I guess is my major downfall as to why I get stepped on by people. Well, Steve and Krystle should be here soon so I'm out. Late!

Oh and then has the nerve to tell me she doesn't have it and wants to be friends but lies to me about it is also fucked up. You know, I tried being nice to u and ur girl and for u to give her my ring is so beyond fucked up just like u dedicated our song to Michelle. Just give me my ring back and I guess we can just go our own ways. I don't want problems, just the ring. Thanks!"

"event","Well, it's been quite some time since I last updated. Things were going good and then an unexpected turn events happened. Krystle and I made out a couple times and have been thinking of seriously dating. Last week Friday I was over my friends house when I started getting a severe pain in my back/side/stomach. So I went home and my parents thought it was food poisoning. So the next day I couldn't take the pain anymore so I went to the hospital and waiting for 5 and a half hours just to get into the back to be seen. Then waited 4 hours until I was all done. So together 9 and a half hours in a fuckin hospital. It fuckin sucked. So they x-rayed, hooked me up to an IV and gave me some pain medication. Then, the moment came where I found out what I had... A fuckin kidney stone... at 18. So, I can't drink anymore soda again... ALways water.. it sucks. They perscribed me oxycodone (perks 5) and it worked for a bit. Then yesterday my pain came back. My rents were at work so I had my nieghbor take me back to the hospital. My stone didn't pass. Again x-ray, IV, and morphine threw the IV. That shit was amazing. I had no pain within 10 minutes. It felt great. Then they gave me a cup to strain my piss in to catch the stone in and give it to my doctor. I can't go to work til next week which sucks because I need money. I'm losing so much weight because I've been throwing up because of the stone. I couldn't hold down water. My stomach is so weak that I can't eat alot. So this has been pretty much hell for me. And now one of my friends is moving back to Jersey. I'm gonna miss Kevin so much. He's a sweetheart. He said he's gonna miss his lesbian. Lol. Sometimes I think I should have stayed in Jersey. The people are so nice there and they actually care unlike here. I came back for someone I loved and for her to just leave me... so I played with her when I took her back the last time. Damn did she beg for me to go back to her.... lol. Anyways, I may not have alot of friends right now in my life but that's ok. It's better to make new ones and get rid of some of the old bad ones. I'll start college in August and hopefully have a car by then too. Well, that's it for now. Love ya! ~Iris~"

I'm starting to talk to a girl named Nicole in Miami and I'm going to spend the night at her house this Friday night. She's a sweetheart. She's coming all the way from real south Miami all the way up here to come get me. I can't wait. Julie called me today and I was actually very surprised to hear from her. I'm glad I did though. It was good to hear from her. I'm glad things are going good for the both of us. Hopefully we can be friends. In other events, I was supposed to see Matt today but his mom said his dad was going. I haven't seen him in 3 weeks and that really upsets me. I miss him so much. Hopefully next week I'll see him. I'm going back to work finally tomorrow. I need the money. Thankfully I get paid this Wed. so I'll have money this weekend to take Nicole out to dinner. That is if she'll let me pay. Lol. Beth and Tina are not on talking terms and Tina wants me to try to talk to Beth and find out shit. I don't want to get involved i their problems. I hate being in the middle of drama. Other than that, I just can't wait for this weekend. Also, Nicole wants to take me to the Keys. That'll be fun. Well, that's it for now. Love ya guys!!!"

They're still not too happy about the fact of me being a lesbian but in time I'm hoping they'll come around. Julie, if you do read this, please just give me the chance to talk to you and maybe you'll see that things in my life have changed. I'm not saying I wanna be with you or anything but I'm trying to let you know that I will always be here if you need someone to talk to anything about. Well, gonna go for now, got work tomorrow.

Then some crazy cab driver honked at us and cut us off, then slammed on his brakes and almost caused us to crash into him. So we took down the cab number and reported it to the police. Right as we did that a cop turned on his lights and went looking for him. It was so insane. Crazy mother fucker! Never trust yellow cabs, they suck. Anyways, other then that I had a really boring, depressing day. My parents don't want anything to do with me. I feel so unloved and hurt. I can't wait til Matt and I get this apartment so I can prove to them that I am resposible. Plus I have a job now too. And I'm going to school in August. I know college is going to be tough but I was told that if I try I can succeed. So, I know some people have faith in me and I thank them for still believing in me. I  love those of you who do. Happy Holidays for those of you who enjoyed it, and for those who didn't, just letting you know your not alone. I cried most all today so I'm very drained from all the tears... night."

I will always love you but you've hurt me for the last time. I won't EVER come back to you. I was there when she said you smell and have bad teeth or whatever... and I got kicked out of my house because of being a lesbian and not going with my family to Gainsville so I can see you because you were so hurt.

I sat here so long and tried to try.
Tired to make things work out
Was what it was all about.

It's crossed my mind she could not be the one,
Now everything has fallen, it's over, it's done.
But why do I still feel the way that I do?
It's just one of those things I haven't got a clue.

To love someone is to love and be loved back,
In this situation maybe it was all JACK!
My heart tells me what I feel and know,
But my mind is telling me fuck it, just go.

Go far away and never return,
A life lesson finally learned.
Deserted on the street like a strayed cat,
I actually, honestly, thank her for that.

Met a great girl at the club that night,
Slept over her house and never did fight.
She's sweet and fun to be with too,
Another sleepover on the way, we'll see what we do. *wink*

Everything is seeming ok now in life,
Hopefully one day I will find my special wife.
To love and hold in the right way,
And not just be some fucked up lay.

When I think of her sometimes tears come and go,
I wish the tears would go and not show.
I'm starting to mend this broken heart of mine,
All it took was some painful time.

These last couple months have been good and bad,
In the end I know you are glad.
You have what you want and I'm looking still,
Maybe in the wrong place so I'm just gonna chill.

Meet new people, go out and have fun,
For all I know my life has just begun.
I end this post with one thing to say,
Goodbye, farewell, FUCK THE SHIT THAT DAY!!!!

JUST TO LET YOU KNOW, I WOULD NEVER TAKE YOU BACK ONCE MICHELLE HURTS YOU! NEVER!! AND THE SONG SHE DEDICATED TO YOU...""SHAKE IT OFF"" THAT SONG IS FOR YOU FORM ME!"

I WAS TOLD YOU WILL LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU CAN TALK TO ME AGAIN BUT LIKE I SAID, I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER I CAN TAKE IT. SINCE MAY 21ST WE WERE TOGETHER LIKE ALMOST EVERYDAY AND TO JUST THROW THAT AWAY HURTS. I HONESTLY BELIEVE THAT IF YOU AND I MET UP THIS WEEK, SAT DOWN AND TALKED, MAYBE YOU WOULD REALIZE THAT WE COULD POSSIBLEY BE THE BEST FRIENDS YOU THOUGHT WE COULD BE. ALL I'M ASKING FOR IS A CHANCE TO PROVE TO YOU THAT I CAN BE YOUR FRIEND AND THAT I'M HERE FOR YOU IF YOU NEED ME AND WANT TO BE HERE FOR YOU. PLEASE THINK ABOUT THIS FOR ME AND UNDERSTAND WHERE I AM COMING FROM."

"event","Have you ever been in a relationship that was going so well and then just one day went so wrong? Well, i have, with Julie. I FUCKING love this girl, and when she left me again on the 21st, I was heartbroken. She told me she still wanted to be with Michelle and it hurts me so bad. I've been crying every hour since she left me. She doesn't even want to talk to me. It kills me so badly inside not to talk to her. She's been there for me whenever I needed her and now she wont be. I know we were happy and that i made her miserable with the lack of affection towards her, but i never wanted it to come to this. I honestly don't like the fact of her being with Michelle but if that's what makes her happy then so be it. I want so badly to have the friendship we had when we went to Denny's one night to have coffee and talk about life. Julie i i do love you and would love to your friend. If being with her makes you happy, do it. I'm here if you need me and I hope that you'll be there for me still. God knows I need it.

Love 
Iris M. Ross"

I think about Julie all the time and I really miss her. I don't know what to do. We started dating 3 times throughout this week... she left me, I left her, and then she left me again. She says she wants to die for what she has done to me but I could never deal with the fact of her being gone like that. It seems that whenever she sees me and I see her, it's hard to keep our hands off each other and our lips apart. The other day she went to kiss me and I turned my head... I felt like total shit. Everytime we say we're just gonna be friends... it's more like friends with benefits... I just want to tell her I love her and thank Paul for being ok with the fact that I do still love her and want to be with her. I'll update later when I have a chance... probably awhile from now... Love ya!"

"event","So last night I was at the mobil with Julie, Meredith, Beth, Carla, Krystle, Mike, Tim, and other people. Krystle and I decided that we were gonna get some beer in our systems so we both drank like 3-4 beers each. They were the 16oz cans. One of them we chugged. It was fun but I had trouble walking and Krystle kept throwing up next to Tims' truck. I saw Carlas' ass and I gave her strap on head. We had so much fun last night. I don't remember going to sleep without pants on. I guess Julie took them off. In one week I'm going to New Jersey with Beth. I can't wait. I'm really excited. I've never been to Jersey. Beth is going to bring me to all the gay spots she knows of. So I'm sitting in Julies' room waiting for her to get back from work. I woke up and she wasn't here. I guess she let me sleep because I was so fucked up. I think the reason I was fucked up off those beers was because I haven't really been drinking a whole lot and I didn't eat before I drank. I have such a hang over right now and I usually never get them. Well, gonna lay down... not feeling to well. Gonna go out to eat with Julie when she gets back."

"event","Holy shit! What a crazy last night... Me, Julie, Carla and Krystle all were in Julies' car following Carlas' (at the time girlfriend). We followed her from pompano to boca. She went to some guys house probably to get laid and then Carla finally caught her in the act and broke up with her. I'm glad she did it because Carla's a sweetheart and deserves much better. Then we all went to Taco Bell and had a little lesbian picnic on the ground. I had to pee so bad so I peed in front of Julies' car. It was a crazy night. Then we went to see Beth at the mobil and chilled there for a bit. It was an awesome night. I've had 4 hours of sleep within 24 hours. I'm pretty tired now and want to go to sleep but don't have the energy to. Krystle dyed my hair black underneath and I think I'm gonna do my whole head. I'm scared to be in this relationship with Julie again because the last 3 times she left me for Michelle and I just feel like it's going to happen again. Anyone would feel that way. She swears up and down that it won't happen but I believe differently. I also found out that when she was with me when we were first dating she was thinking of Michelle basically the whole time and slept with her jacket underneath her pillow. So that really pissed me off too. I just don't know what to really think anymore and I know it hurts when I say I don't trust her, but right now I don't. I would like to, but it's going to take quite a bit of time. Well, that's it for now. Too tired to type more. Night."

"event","Well... Julie and I offically broke up. It's funny how she went straight to Michelle right after she broke up with me. Does she honestly think that Michelle is gonna treat her right? She's got another thing coming to her. Also... supposedly when she brakes up with people she wants to remain friednds with them and have a good closure... I guess I'm the exception. I have 4 black and blues on my arm from her digging her nails into me just so that I would turn around. I guess getting back together was a bad idea. I guess there is no real love that was there. She says she loves me but yet she says fuck you, your a bitch and I never want to see you again to me. That's not love. I hope your happy with Michelle and can move on with your life. I would like to be friends with you but that's your call. I guess our hearts just belonged to other people. I guess the song ""We belong together"" was really for Michelle. Hell, you did dedicate it to her after it was already mine, after-all, it was our song. But like I said, I would like to be friends because you're a cool person to hang with. We've had good times together and some bad. It's funny how we both took a test and said we would never talk shit about each other if we ever broke up. I'm staying true to it... are you? Well, I hope to get a reply from you soon so I will know if we can salvage a friendship from all that we had."

Julie, I didn't mean to make you so stressed out over me. I hope that your ok now. So I stayed with Jakel for 2 nights and he was  more sick then I was but 1 really sick person helping another wasn't such a good idea. I think by doing that I made myself alot worse. But I'm glad Jakel is getting the treatment he needs now. Hope everything goes well for him. As for me... I have severe back pain, stuffed up nose, coughing alot, bad throat pain, neck pain, headaches, trouble breathing, etc... I think I should be fine though. I can actually smoke a cigarette without it hurting so much now. Really need to quit that though. Well, hopefully today is a better day. Glad this hurricane isn't hitting us..."

YOU THINK THE FRIENDS YOU HAVE NOW ARE YOUR TRUE FRIENDS? REALITY CHECK... THEY ALL TALK MAD SHIT BEHIND YOUR BACK. YOU'VE SAID SO MANY TIMES YOUR GONNA KILL YOURSELF, SO JUST GO AHEAD AND FUCKIN DO IT ALREADY. EVERYONE WOULD BE BETTER OFF WITHOUT YOU AND YOUR POOR EXCUSE OF A LIFE. HAVE FUN WITH YOUR LITTLE 16 YEAR OLD GIRLFRIEND. I JUST FIND IT FUNNY THAT THE 1ST TIME YOU HAD SEX WITH HER WAS WHEN U WERE DRUNK AND THAT U ADMITTED THAT YOU DIDN'T WANT TO SEE HER FACE. BUT WHATEVER. YEA I DID LOVE YOU AND AT THE BEGINNING THINGS WERE GOOD... BUT IT'S OVER NOW AND I CAN MOVE ON LIKE I'M DONE NOW. I HAVE A BEAUTIFUL, INTELLIGENT, FUNNY, EXCITING AND LOVING FIANCE AND YOU GOT SHIT. SO FUCK YOU!

"event","Things have been going really good between Julie and I until kasper started spreading bullshit rumors about me which almost caused Julie and I to brake up. Then she fuckin sat there and told our friend that she was going to kill us if we didn't give her her shit back. So many people would have Julie and my back over kasper's anyday. So many people hate her. Julie proposed to me on June 14th. She made me breakfast in bed and then asked me. I was a little scared because of the date. I told her why. We developed the pictures from gay prom and they are fuckin awesome. I will have them on my livejournal when I can. We also have other random pictures of jakel, paul, and danielle (lafonda). The quesadillas 4life. lol. I'm very mad at paul because of the fact he wrote in his livejournal that I should rot in hell and that it was my fault for getting him to do drugs which is bullshit. So paul, fuck you for saying that shit. I'm happy in my life right now and I'mglad my parents are accepting the way of my life. I reconnected with Meredith again. We talked and it seems that we worked out alot of our past problems together. I think we both have a better understanding of one another because we both have girlfriends and have been through some bullshit from homophobics. Meeting Julie uncle was very scary. He was pointing at me and telling me that I was only allowed to stay at her house one more night even though he doesn't even live there. It was scary. He's really mean. As Julie falls asleep in front of me, I look at her and realize that she is the one for me and that I'm happy we found each other. Her friends are awesome and they all love me for some reason. My friends like Julie to which is good. So my 18th B-day is this Friday. I'm so excited. I need to figure out what I'm going to do and if I'm going to throw a party. And if I do throw a party, where will it be? I'm getting my tongue pierced this friday or saturday. It all depends when I get and I.D. Well, if anyone has any ideas about where to party... let me know. Love you guys. ~Nay Nay~ (Quesadilla girl)"

"event","Hey everyone. todasy was an awesome day. and sober fun is not the best fun ever by the way. getting drunk is fun too. hehe. anyways, i've been hanging out with my girl julie and my best friends jerry, danielle k., jonny, matt, andy, and lunchbox. so much fun. one part i didn't like today was that i tried to talk to paul and he had to go because his girlfriend is a controlling bitch. it made me so upset because i had to talk to him about something important. when someone says that they're in love with you and then cheats on their girlfriend with you and wants to be with you and then won't even talk to you because they're too ""busy"" is just fucked up. my love for someone is slowly dying and also growing for another. i love you julie, i truely do."

"event","hey everyone. it's been awhile since i have updated my journal. paul and i are finally over and i couldn't been any happier then i am now with my girlfriend julie. someone who cares about me and doesn't stalk me or isn't to clingy. i wish that things didn't have to end like this paul, but u caused it. and let's get something straight, u were the negative influence in my life and i got rid of you. u have lied so much to me and like an idiot i forgave you. so many things i went through and have done for you. your a very ungreatful person and very needy. u become so dependent on other people and u need to not do that. i have helped u through so much shit and so many things i could have done and didnt do becuase of you. i'm glad we're done and over with. by the way, u said all we have now are the memories and they will be erased... well, a little advice for you, u can't erase the memories. u casn try to forget but they can never be erased. so have fun with your life that ur trying to make better. i know my life is going so well right now because i'm out of high school and going to start college. i'm making myself a life and not going to be working in fast food the rest of it. 

p.s. u suck in bed."

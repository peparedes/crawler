"event","New job, since last post.  I now own my own design business and work part-time as a nanny.  This will only be until August, for when I start school.  Gotta save some money and make those bens.  Buying a house in August as well.  I already have the living room and dinning room designed but thats it.  gotta wait on things like the kitchen, in case the counter tops are vivid, like at my moms house.  GOD I would KILL for the cobalt blue tile she has in her kitchen for the counter.  AWESOME!!  So nothing else really new.  Probably gonna put some pink streaks in my hair when I get home today, to match my lovely lip ring.  Anyhows.  More later, when something interesting happens.  Oh there have been PLENTY of interesting things happening lately, I just don't want to sound whiney or get depressed so we will touch on all that later on.  What you say?"

One where the people I want to date don't work at, and where I don't work graveyard.   It will be nice.  I have an interview tomorrow morning so we'll see how that goes.  Please dear god don't make me stay here anymore!!!!"

Saw A TON of hot guys, one of which works security, and even got hit on by a gay one.  I think that the drinks made him straight for a little bit.  THe only downsides are that my feet are KILLING ME and that now I'm working a shift where I can't figure out a social life.  We'll see.  I can't imagine how I'm going to do school and this job at the same time.  It will be a good job to be able to do homework when I want but I just can't see when i'm going to actually go to class.  We shall see."

I mean sure I have an employer and sure I have money to do things with, but I spend most of my time either smoking at Joey's, smoking at my house, watching t.v. online, and then random outings to the casinos or bars.  I feel like I have a summer vacation.  It's pretty nice at times and then pretty mundayne sometimes.  Here's hoping that Hard Rock calls back soon.  Otherwise I think I'm going to move in to my closet and start getting addicted to AIM again."

I went to Joey's, then Melissa's and watched Strange Wilderness, then left at like three where me and someone else smoked in my closet until 5 AM.  Nice huh.   Saturday I worked until 1 AM. then went over to check out the last bit of the UFC fight, left there at 2 AM and spent the rest of the night at Freddie's watching ""Groomer has it"" and etc.  Today/tonight I got kind of sick today and it just got worse while I was at JOeys.  Came home early, 10:30/11:00 but now it's 2 AM, my migrane is gone and I'm waiting on John to come over.  So, how was YOUR weekend?"

"event","So I'm actually IN the closet.  My little space that noone bothers me, and I feel like I can literally get away from the world.  The closet isn't your normal closet.  It's deep and angled like a little room in the back of a walk in closet.

It's good to be home. In m closet.  The perfect night.  D's asleep so I plan on spending the remainder in here.
Smoking pot, ready O.K! magazine, watching Degrassi online, smoking pot, texting Melissa while she's at work, and reading up on everyone's journal entries.  I miss my Atlanta family.  When I say that I mean my nephews, stepsister and bro in law, and my wonderful Atlanta friends that all seem to have stepped up since I got sick and moved back to MS.  

What did I do earlier.  Hm.. well, we watched National Treasure, smoked ALOT, talked about the difference between a drugdealer's interaction with people vs mens interaction with girls.  (Always gotta act sketchy, like they've got somewhere better to be).  Then wrapped up Tito's leg.  She got hit by a car on friday night.  It's sad.  She has a cone and her leg is all bandaged up.  I just found out I'm working Saturday night at the Beau. 5-1AM.  Hopefully I will feel awesome by then.  As soon as I get done I'm headed to Coast probably.    Let's see.  Current worries


-Haven't heard back from the University on my acceptance and financial aid approval
-still hoping that Charles is able to take a look at the situation and realize that it doesn't have to be so difficult.  
-and then the obvious CURE ME!!! Worry

All in all, I've really come to an attitude of ""Don't worry about things you can't control""  Take life day to day and enjoy the time you have with those around you.

Appreciate everything."

Well found a storage unit in O.S. for $55 a month!!! Awesome huh?  The truck and movers are aparently something that others can handle for me so I'm just waiting on hearing back about that.  Other than that it's going pretty smoothly.  My friends are throwing me a going away night. Sushi and then Kareoke.  I think that's probably when i'll get sad.

"event","Well.  I didn't really write anything in here while I was with Charles.  I don't think I'm going to attempt to summarize our entire relationship in one sitting, let alone for the entire world to read.  All that you need to know is that it is no longer existing.  I have gone over everything in my head so many times, the past week, and I think if I just move on, I'll be able to eat again. 


So instead of talking about that depressing situation, let's go ahead and address the current one.  I'm in serious danger of being back in the hospital.  Eating disorders are no joke and anyone that passes judgement on someone struggling with this obviously has NO idea what it's like to start crying when you just THINK about food.  I spent a total of 5 days in the hospital since Charles and I broke up.  Feeding tubes are not fun, IV's are NOT fun, and having to eat all of your meals in front of people is NOT fun.  I must say I'm feeling ALOT better lately.  Still pretty sick every morning from the meds but once I get something on my stomach, I start cruising.  I've had some calls and visits from people I love very much and I can tell you that a certain one, (British), is probably why I'm here today and not in the hospital.  I'm going to focus everything I have on getting better.  Do whatever it takes!!  So in the meantime, you'll have to endure my old habits of finding funny videos and posting them.  Have a good one!"

"event","So it's been a month in the new place.  The only true thing I've been having issues with, besides my creepy neighbors, is the fact that after over a year, London is having accidents in the house.  She has NEVER, and I mean NEVER so much as pee'd in the house before we moved.  She has been overseas, stayed on a tour bus for two weeks, and even not let out for over 24 hours (that was all Dougie, not me BTW) and didn't have any accidents.  I'm not sure what else to do.  I'm puking in disgust everytime I walk through the door.  This dog is NOT small so neither is anything else. 

Enough of that.  Gotta try and do some work. Tomorrow is the trunk show, so I have PLENTY of things to do before I leave the office today.  OH.  Only because I know I will forget this myself later on, Lauren Usher is still my soul mate.  She calls me on saturday and tells me that her shitty boyfriend crashed his car into a house she was putting an offer on, after they were leaving the tour.  Seriously.  Who else has a life as eventfull as mine but hers.  Still on the antibiotics because of someone we will refer to as ""thong boy"" decided he would get me sick.  I haven't had anything to drink since I was put on these meds and I only have three days left.  i'm going crazy though.


Just thought you should see some hotness after reading about the dog pooper

Until Barney's called at midnight, and it was Corky's bday.  Even though I had already settled in with some wine and Detroit Rock City, I got up and drove the HOUR to Gwinnet.  had fun though.  Got home the next morning at 11 AM.  Slept half the day and then went to Target for the remainder of the night, then GYM.   Sunday, went shopping with holly.  Got some dressed for Janet's wedding, some new boots, and a gorgeous cash. tutle neck from pInK.  LOVES IT.  

Then we went to Barney's (I KNOW)  to play some pool before our movie started.
We to see Saw III (insane BTW) and then hung out with Jon.  Oh BUT i did manage to not wake up this morning for my alarm, and I was over 45 minutes late for work.

Gotta love the irony.  Anyhow, things are slowly getting better.  I'm finally getting to the point where my job doesn't overwhelm me.  I love it. School is good except that I hate the one I just trasnferred to.  I'm thinking about getting my realtors license in January.  Make some crazy dough on the weekends since I don't have time to do anything now, as is.  Halloween is coming up and starting tomorrow I have a party/event every night until then.  I'm little red riding hood. LOVE my costume.  Hopefully Dianne can get her one soon.  I need someone to be the wolf or granny.....

HMMM what to do what to do??

Anyways, going home, then to school, then back home to watch my tivo'd OTH and America's Next Top Model.  Oh yeah!  I discovered that you can get books online for WAY cheap through Barnes and Noble Used and Out of Print books.

First off, no more job at Target,
I now work for Dan Hannon recordings as Dan's personal assistant....meaning I'm staying here watching his son, my nephew, Jake, for almost a month. AHHHHHHHHHHHH. anyhow it's fine

Next off, i'm now applying to be a flight attendant.  random huh.  also random is me not only speaking to on a regular basis, but having dinner with Brandon, yes Brandon, and his friend last week. Alot can change in two years and I'll be the first to admit he has. For the better. 

And last.............. Marcus......................oh what can I say about Marcus?

My family LOVES him, he comes down here to see me while I'm away and calls me everyday, but is he really the one I'm supposed to end up with????
What's wrong with me??  Why can't I appreciate what I have, when I have it rather than wanting something after it's gone. I think we know where I'm going with this.

I'll get back to everyone on this as soon as I know for myself. In the meanwhile I'm going to stick with living through Dawson's Creek every morning.

I moved out of that terrible situation with my drug addict roommate and her boyfriend. I live in a beautiful house now with two other girls, both named Liz.  I still have no money because I now work at Target and I'm on workman's comp....another story later on....
anyhow. I moved into this house and started dating one of my roommates brothers. Things were cool.  I took him to MS to meet everyone. He's really nice there was just some things that he did, or should I say didn't do that kind of pushed me towards the edge. I'm not the kind of person to publisize a break-up so i'll just say we wanted other things in life.  ANyhow. Now  I'm dating this fabulous guy named Marcus, who does nothing but worship me and treat me the way I knew I should be treated just never experianced.  He is wonderful.

My sister had her baby boy last sunday. Baby Elijah. He's wonderful and we're going to mississippi for the week. Ive been having some difficulities finacially really bad which is why I'm going to MS to make some money so I can pay rent. I'm really stressed about this all.

Ok basically, working alot. Still for progress energy. It's good money and company.  About three months ago I started dating this guy that I work with, named Matt.  He seemed like the perfect guy.  Opened doors for me, called me beautiful, when went to the drive-in, camping, ya know, fun stuff.  I was completely infatuated. there' was only one problem.. He would never call me when he said he was.  Big deal right.  NO. I""m serious.  NEVER CALLED>  When went to MS two weeks ago for him to meet my family and basically the shit hit the fan, pardon my french.  He got pissed because I wasn't paying him enough attention.  I was like ""Welcome to being me for the past three months,""

Anyways, we made up but I broke up with him two days later.  I can now see that he is basically a moran.  Don't think I would leave you hangin though.  I've got a new interest in my life.  And get this !!!HE""S AUSTRALIAN!!! So hot!!!! We're just talking at the moment. but things might change.  

I've been going to alot of braves games.  Made really good friends with a guy I work with named Chris.  He's gay so my sister calls him my Will..

Anyhow, I'm on a huge sushi kick lately.  Had some tonight as a matter of fact.  Just can't seem to get enough of it..  My work schedule has changed. YES SARIANNE PARKER HAS TO GET UP AT 7 AM!!! MAJOR CRAPOLA but I like getting off at 6.

I dropped off my resume at Bank of America and then headed to Razoos to eat dinner with liz, her family, and boyfriend.  First off, the traffic here is so bad, it took me 30 minutes to get 5 miles away from Roswell.  Whatever.

So I made it there FINALLY. It was really good to see Liz. I forgot how much I missed her.  Anyhow. Her family was really cool and I had a good time except for one thing.  (Liz I know you're going to read this so just go ahead and prepare yourself to get mad at me)

Her boyfriend is BY FAR the most oppionated person I've EVER met.  There are ways to state your opinion without making the people around you look stupid.  There are other things in this world besides ones self.  AAHH!! Anyhow.  Left Razoos and got lost in Alpharetta for almost 30 minutes. Finally made it back to the apartment and took jake, my nephew, off his dads hands. Watched him all night and then alex for some of it.

Yesterday basically ate at The Brookwood, way too much, went to Walmart, and came home to get ready for a friend of Shelley's party. 
We made it home around 1 and I was able to get to bed around 2:30

Today when i woke up though, I was so sick from all the damn birthcontrol pills being shoved down my throat that I was throwing up and we didn't go see Dan play at northpoint.

Basically caught up.. um. yeah,,,

Oh. And liz, please don't be too mad at me, BELIEVE me I wanted to say ALOT more."

I applied at two places so far and picked up applications for three more. Maybe I'll apply at like every store when Liz comes down.  This has been my week..

got here- day 1
sat here- day 2
applied at Khol's and Target- Day 3
ate at Macoroni Grill and bought a bathing suit- day 4
bought groceries and watched legally blonde- day 5
tommorow's plans- (we shall see if I follow through)

Wake up early.  Take Alex and Jake to have their pictures taken for their father's day presents. Pick up any applications I can get my hands on, set up and buy a new cell phone, set up new bank account, and then hopefully have time to wipe my ass since it's been doing so much sitting lately.  Not true. i've actually wanted to go out and do these things all week. But when you're step-sister wants to go with you with a 7 year old and a 10 week old, you can't really be on a schedule.

O.k. gonna TRY and sleep now.

Anyhow. Since the last time I updated alot has kind of happened.  This weekend just went to alot of going away parties. It made me feel good about myself again because guys were actually hitting on me again!  I was so excited!!! It had been a while because I've been spending most of my time at home or at work.  So anyhow, one night this weekend, I was going through some of my old tapes and found, you guessed it, my HAnson collection. I watched some for fun and got completely hooked again. Went on kazaa and found TONS of new Hanson stuff. I feel reborn. Even though I'm not the crazy hansonadict I was before I still really like their music and can't wait till the new cd comes out this fall!

Packing is going considerably well.  Alot is done.
My little sis was in a car accident yesterday though. She's o.k. just got mawled by some completely cajun idiot.

Well I really need to get some things done.  I get my new cell phone number this weekend but I have my new address.

After work the other waitresses and I headed for happy hour and then went home to get ready for ladies night.  i was soo tired I crashed on my bed and skipped out on the whole thing.  Today wasn't that eventful.  I woke up at 3 in the afternoon (THANK GOD) and just watched tv all night.  Got in a fight with my stupid stepfather about laundry and now I'm online AGAIN waiting until the movie I ordered off of pay-per-view comes on and watching way too much Boy Meets World.

"event","I am suddenly remembering something I read in Liz and Jason's LJ a couple of weeks ago about how tired they were of Christians being the most judgemental people out there?  Was it my imagination?  Well I can now say that I DEFINATELY agree.  Have you ever had someone come on your LJ, make a rude comment about something you wrote and claim to be a Christian at the same time.  Kind of crazy huh?  I am only mad because what I write in this is basically meant for friends eyes, whom of which are people that understand me and my sence of humor. How dare someone that doesn't know me, my friends, or the way we interact judge me?  Am I wrong to think this?  I could maybe understand someone coming on my LJ, seeing something that made them kind of thrown off, and saying something like a confrontation on the comments.  That's understandable.  Then I would just address them with the explanation of why I wrote something and that would be that.  I just can't handle someone questioning my relationship with the Lord when they've never even had a conversation with me.  AAGGHH.  Sorry

I got off around 10 and went to see Chancis at Best Western.  We went bowling with a group of people and then went all redneck and drank in the back of pickups near the woods in Latimer.  Had alot of fun actually. Mostly because I was making fun of this jerk at the bowling alley because he kept raving about how much he loved to play with the big blue balls and nothing else. What a freakin looney.

Anyhow, went to work on saturday and saw that Kyle's cell phone number was writen on the wall. I had TOTALLY forgot that he used to work there so i called him up.  He came by and made fun of the bitch work I was required to do. After work I went home, took a shower, ran by the liquer store to feed all my alcholic friends and went to Kyle's (which is actually Lauren and Westley's).  Watched face off and it seemed like as soon as lauren and west went to bed Kyle came in for the kill. Things got a little hot n' heavy, and around 2:30 a.m. I decided I had to go home.

All n all a good weekend. Just glad to FINALLY have one day off."

"event","After my first day on my new job, I am convinced that I do have the strength of ten men.  I honestly dont know how these people expect me, 5'4'', to be able to throw a gazillion pound garbage bag over my head, and into a dumpster.  Am I crazy??
Anyhow,  I cant think of anything except this part of my day that will last forever in my mind and I will be telling this horror story to my grandchildren.


So, around 11:30 this morning, the lunch rush was about to come in, so they asked me to throw the big garbage can out so we wouldn't get swamped with it during the rush.

O.K. No problem you would think right?? WRONG!!  First off, the garbage bag was sooo heavy I literally used a dolly (sp?) to carry it out to the dumpster, second, the restraunt I work at is near the water so all the sea grass and swamp things are around us...I am told to (this is not a joke people)  GO down the stairs, through the grassy nole, over the bridge around the ""pond"" and through the pete moss to the dumpster.  This is all carry a garbage bad full of God knows what.

So after I make the Tibetan trek, I get to the dumpster to discover that I cannot sling it over the top like I thought I could, so I have to LIFT the bag over my head into the dumpster.

Just as I had the bag directly over my freshly washed hair, my fingernail pokes a hole in it and garbage juices start flowing all over me from head to toe.  I threw the bag into the dumpster, puked EVERYWHERE and then just begin to cry.  You also have to understand that this was AFTER I had seriously burned myself like four times, spilled almost a whole pitcher of tea on my while trying to force myself into the dishwasher station, AND got stung by a horsefly.  Anyhow, a normal person would just quit then right.?? Nope not me.  I only have to do this until I move to Atlanta so two more weeks of hell. I can deal with it. At least I'm getting paid right?

Well, gotta go get ready for the SERIES finale of Buffy.

I called in because I could barely walk on thursday night because of my pains.  Anyhow, my sister, who is a nurse non the less, called in for me and let them know I wasn't going to be coming in.  They (WADE) said that Jackie (the GM was mad and that she might have to let me go) I was like, whatever.  Anyhow. Went to the doctor and then Atlanta to take Shelley home and got back last night.  My dad's friend, Nancy, came over and she is the head chef at Matthew's Downtown, a fine dining restraunt.  I was joking and asked if I got fired tonight if I could have a job there until I moved to Georgia in like the next three weeks. She was serious and said yeah.  I called Hampton Inn and sure enough I was fired, but not because of what I thought. Apparently wade forgot a BIG part of the message from Jackie saying that I had a certain amount of time to be there before I was fired.  Funny huh?  I don't care.  I have a better job now, with way better hours and working for people with brains!! Love it, hate wade and all his petty ways.  Not going to miss him at all.

"event","As some of you may have noticed, I haven't been updating my live journal all that much lately.  Before the tar anf feathers come out, I assure you there is an explanation.  My life has been on a whirlwind for the past week and made some drastic turns.  So I did go to Atlanta this weekend. We got there late friday night and went to meet Dan at the studio.  We left and went out to eat. Dave, the guy that they want me to be roommates with, went with us.  He seemed cool at first but then he kind of started getting on my nerves.  He wouldn't wear his seatbelt and he was sitting behind my 6 week old nephew.  Whatever. So we left there (ruby tuesadys) around 1 am.  I was so FREAKIN tired that I collasped on the sofa as soon as we got back.  Woke up the next morning and went shopping for mothers day presents and then clothes.  

Got home around 5 p.m. and starting getting ready for the game. We left a little late so we got stuck in traffic for two hours.  By the time we got to the braves game it was the 3rd in inning. It was still fun. We won and I sat next to a guy that looked just like James VanderBeek (dawson).  Stinkin seriously.  i took a pic.

We got home late AGAIN, and believe it or not they invited dave to the game too. hmmph.  Got up the next morning and went to see Dan play at Buckhead Church. REALLY good church.  I think that's where I'm going to go when I move to Atlanta.  Left church and went to Brookwood, Brian's restraunt.  We ate almost 300 dollars worth of food and only had to pay for 29 of it!!! HA!  Got back to the apartment and didn't leave until LATE!! 

On the drive home, me and Shelley talked ALOT!~!  she convinced me to go to a state funded college like Georgia State instead of a private college. I'm really excited about it. I've got to get on the ball though going to J.C. and paying all my left over tuition and crap.  I hope I get the job at the hospital in Atlanta.  I don't know what I'm going to do about this roommate thing. I could find another roommate but they wouldn't live right next to shelley and probably not have all the funiture that dave does. NOt to mention he's a record producer. We shall see. I'm literally moving as soon as I get a job!! I start classes this fall and I want to get some Atlanta time before then.

I hope Kimberly gets voted off tommorow night.

anyways, to sum it all up. We spent the entire day trying to find a local pediatrician for her because her's in it Atlanta and the doctor said poor jakey had reflux.

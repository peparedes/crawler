It's 4 in the morning and I don't really know what I'm doing right now. Please ignore all my previous posts in this journal thing, they're all immature retarded rants that I wrote a few years ago when I was really, really dumb. Okay...hello and goodbye. I can't sleep.

Nick: Of course not.
Mom: What!??!!? Then why did you have dad drop you off? You told him you were going to do your homework. Did you lie to him?
Nick: Well I-
Dad (cutting Nick off): He always lies to me. He lies to me on a daily basis. He's says how he's this truthful guy and then he goes and lies to me.
Nick (giving up): You're right Dad, I never tell the truth. I'm the biggest liar to walk the Earth. In fact, I'm lying right now.
Dad makes some stupid joke.
Nick, enraged, walks away and closes his door and starts blasting some satanic metal.

I am sick of my parents not having any idea who I am.
But seriously now, have any of you ever caught me in a lie? Have you ever got the feeling that I lied to you? Because I seriously never lie, I never have a reason to. But maybe I'm wrong. I probably do lie all the time and don't realize it. Do I lie?"

I am such a haha just loser. Yes, loser. What am I talking about. I know she doesn't love me. That would be too perfect. Ahhh that's how I have to decipher fact from fiction. Interesting. So basically, things are true if they are on a scale from horrible to good. Anything past good, is a lie. It all makes sense now. Okay so she likes me as a buddy. Makes sense. It's always just a buddy though. Also a close friend. Haha I'm always the girlfriend. Go ahead and tell me everything. Get real close to me. Let me fall in love with you. Just make sure you don't fall in love with me, heaven forbid we make Nick happy. Whatever this is all so stupid. I've said love/relationships/shit like this can not work at this age.

Nicoleypoo's voice made me melt after waiting for her and Heather in a Barnes and Noble for an hour (I just spent the entire time reading Star Warsy stuff).
Heather is a neat lady. It's just so hard to find a girl that isn't a complete retard.
Hung out at a park while waiting for a movie. I forgot how much I love just doing nothing at a park. Especially with Nuhkole.
Watched Madagascar. The penguins and giraffe made the movie.
Nicoleypoo has the cutest squeak when she laughs. It really just makes me go ""God she's so unbelievably cute.""
Nicole clipped her toe nails outside of a restaurant. Made me giggle.
Heather screwed with Nicole by calling her and hanging up right when she answered.

Really, I just had a fun time. I wish this happened more often."

But I did realize something while I was thinking to myself. No matter what I do, I'm always going to think ""God I wish Nicole was here."" That's all that really went through my head. Which means that any party I ever go to, whenever I go out with ""friends"", or even sitting right here, as I type this, all I can think is ""I wish Nicole was here right now.""

Oh and my summer school teacher is so fucking lame. As long as she never brings up politics I think we should get along.





I can barely keep my eyes open. I would take a nap, but that homework is just too gosh darn attractive."

I've only felt like this once before. Go on back to this entry if you want to see.
http://www.livejournal.com/users/pimpingeek/2004/09/11/
Yup so if you want to know how that eventually played out, it ended with me hating myself and cutting myself and then having fun in therapy for a couple of months. So...if history is going to repeat itself (and that seems to happen a lot in my life), that isn't exactly a good thing. So right now I'm praying that maybe something will work out. Maybe we'll end up just being friends and not really caring. Maybe she'll forget all about me and I won't really care. Or maybe, just maybe, I might be able to have a future with her. Maybe we can actually have a relationship. You know, the kind when you both love each other and are happy. Hm I guess that's what we have now, huh? Maybe I should just stop caring. I have an amazing relationship with Nicoleypoo...I just don't want it to end. See, these are things that could happen. But of course...most likely, I'll end up doing/saying something stupid, making her hate me and making me hate myself, and then I'll go back into that chronic depression that I love so much. Maybe I should just stop caring...maybe I should just lay down and die...I don't even know why I'm typing this on here. I guess it's just a way to vent. Otherwise I would just be yelled at by that guy in the mirror. 

I hope she's having a good time in Europe...she deserves it...
God I love her so much."

"event","Well school's over. Meaning I'm not going to do anything for three months. Sure people might invite me to things, but will I go? Probably not...I'm really good at making up excuses. And if I don't want to make one up I just say ""No I don't like you"" and it all works out. Haha I told everyone how I don't care about never seeing them after graduation but no one seemed to care. Now people keep asking me why I hate them. I just hate people in general. Do I hate any specific people? Not really. Would I rather be alone than with anyone. Yes. You see, I'm a social person that just doesn't like people. That's my problem. Fucking crazy paradox shit going on there. There is only one person that I guess I care about not seeing again. Nicoleypoo. We'll try to stay in touch but I know we won't. Before today I was dreading the fact that I would never see her again, but now it really isn't that big of a deal. Sure I may love her with all my heart, but she's too good for me, too cool, too awesome, too lovable, too cute, just too fucking amazing. I really don't deserve to talk to her. She'll make new, cooler friends then me and be happy. Eh oh well. Haha this is crazy. I guess I can live a life of complete nonattatchment, even though I'm so in love with Nicole that that's all I can really think about. Hahahaha I'm such a little attention seeking whore. I'm gonna go try and stop laughing now. Just forget what you read, it doesn't matter. Nothing matters."

Wow history repeats itself all too often in my life.  And that's the last thing I want.  So now I sit here, thinking about how to prevent something from happening all over again.

"event","I just remembered back in 6th grade how a girl hugged me and I just froze. Seriously I just stood there thinking ""Wow a girl actually touched me"". I remember going home that night and thinking to myself as i went to sleep how awexome it is that a girl hugged me. Now of course I can't get away from everyone. I'm never left alone. I hate it. My 6th grade counter-part would kill for the life I have now. Now all I want is my old life when I had 2 or 3 friends that were basically my friends because they were either outcasts or they just pitied me. I wonder if I should just insult all of my ""friends"" except for the couple that I actually enjoy being around. But then of course I'd be all ""Waaaa no one likes me. I want my fweinds back. Waaaa.""

Well, all I do is immense myself in the world of Star Wars and video games. You see, I like to lose myself in some meaningless crap so that I am at least distracted from my self-loathing problems I seem to have. It really gets quite annoying. I can't do anything without that thought popping into my head. You know how it seems like there's another person in your head? Like, saying how selfish you are, how cowardly you are, how inconsiderate you are, how you're just such a <b>LIAR</b>. I tell it to go away. I tell it I don't need to hear it. I don't like him. Especially when he looks at me with those eyes filled hate. It is really quite nerve raking. So here I am, listening to a Star Wars audiobook because I've read about 7 books in the last week or two. But don't you just hate it when you can't go a minute without being reminded of the past? I think everyone has that one event in their life that they just want to forget about. Of course it won't go away, it never will. I guess I will have to learn to live with the man in the mirror. Maybe I just need to get to know him better. Ok, now back to the corruption in the Senate and Anakin being manipulated and the Jedi Council being to blind to see what is truly happening...the Sith will rule the galaxy..."

They call themselves punk, goth, preppy, player, whore, whatever, because it is thought of as cool by others. Just be yourself. No reason to alter your appearance for others. Meh, I guess I just shouldn't care. You're all retarded anyway."

There's a few things I need to get off my chest
I need to vent - let me tell you why

I'm suicidal, maniacal, self-destructive
You leave me no hope, no life
Nothing worth living for
I've taken it, can't take it anymore
My worst nightmare
You make me want to slit my own fucking throat
Just so I'll be rid of you
Just to get rid of you

You self-righteous fuck
Give me a reason not to rip your fucking face off
Why don't you take a good look in these eyes
Cause I'm the one that's gonna tear your fucking heart
out
My hate is contagious; you've got no one to run to
EXILE

Just tell me fucking why everything becomes an issue
Your opinion is always senseless - fuck this
You make my fucking skin crawl
I've lived with it - can't stand anymore
My worst nightmare
I want to take a bullet in the fucking head
Every time I think of you, every time I think of you

You self-righteous fuck
Give me a reason not to rip your fucking face off
Why don't you take a good look in these eyes
Cause I'm the one that's gonna tear your fucking heart
out
My hate is contagious
Anyone else need to vent?
You've tried my tolerance; I just want you to die

There's nothing more for me to say
There's nothing more for you to say
There's nothing more for us to say
I fucking hate you anyway
EXILE

Can't count the ways that you light my fuckin fuse
I can't tolerate the sight of you, the thought of you or
anything about you
You know what I want to see?
How many ways can a loser fucking lose
I know you'll find a way
The humility awakening the idiot inside
You spineless fucking maggot - you're just wasting my
time
Get out of my face - Get out of my life
Out of my fucking way - Just die"

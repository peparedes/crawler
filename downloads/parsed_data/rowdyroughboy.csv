O.K. so hear is the deal. I have just started to smoke, just a little : - ) and because I am crazy I cannot find a brand to smoke! I am giving way to much time to thinking about this but if I am going to smoke then I want to smoke a good brand. For those of you who know me, which is pretty much anyone who is reading this, you know that I do not usually smoke. I think I am doing it mostly for the fact that I do not want to be a smoker, but I also do not want to have never tried it. So I have told my self that for my last year in college I may smoke a little. Then after graduation go back to being a non-smoker. I know that this may be hard if and when I become addicted but I am pretty sure I will be able to stop when I walk across the stage. I do want to live a long and healthy life and am very afraid of cancer, this said I feel if a person is going to do stupid things then they should do it in college when they are young and can get it out of they way. For all of my smoking friends that are laughing with victory right now, FUCK YOU ; - ) It is not you who has made me smoke and I WILL NOT smoke after school is over. It is a personal choice that I have made without the aid of anyone else. So now that I smoke, for the time being, I will surely be bugging the shit out of everyone that I come into contact with about what brand to smoke, and I will surely have 50 different brands until I settle on one, at which time I will be graduating and have to quit anyway! Oh well at least I will be able to say that I tried it and when people ask me what I used to smoke when I was a smoker I can proudly say every fucking brand they made...except for the cheap ass shit, I will not have even give those a second thought....I mean if your going to do something do it well!!"

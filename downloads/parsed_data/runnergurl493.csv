Well...work suxs like usual....except for the new addition to the staff ;) HeHe..I called dibs!! Yes!!!  Neways....
I wish school was almost over...I am so unmotivated to do anything right now.  I can't wait until next quarter when I have no classes at all!! HaHa!! Yay for me!!!  
I've done a lot of thinking this week and I talked to Janae on the phone for almost an hour today...and Ive decided that I am happy with my life right now. I mean I have everything that I have ever wanted.  I have a best friend who is there for me through thick and thin. Without her I think I would go crazy...I mean I know we haven't beem as close lately as I wish we were but that's cuz we are both busy with work and such...But I just know that she is always there for me and I love her to death for it!! Seriously....Kelly is my knight in shining armor!!  I am also super close to my mom at the moment.  For the first time in my life I always go to her with my problems and when I need to break down I go to her instead of holding it all in. I like it a lot. Yeah...But to say the least I am happy at the moment.
But Ken is still GAY!! I hate him so much...I wish he would die...I mean seriously..my mom could do so much better...he treats her like shit. And lately I don't even try anymore.  I am total bitch to him...and I enjoy every minute of it!! Yes!! I look forward to the weekends just so I can see how many times I can piss him off...Its great!!!
Newayz...Im gonna go to bed!!!
Luv!!!
GOD YOU FAT PIECE OF LARD!!! HAHA I Luv Rans!!!"

You have no idea how many tears you have made me cry...
I wish I could just yell at you and tell you how I really feel, instead of just smiling and keeping my mouth shut.
I know you dont care..but then again I don't blame you.
I wish I could just erase you from my mind...instead of being reminded of you everyday.
Ive tried to erase you...but it doesn't work
I wish it was the day when I could be able to say good-bye and never see you again....
I hate you for what you've done to me
I hate you
I wish I could just leave.....
But instead you are ban from my life...for ever
I think I am gonna snap...."

Homecoming week has been the best ever!! I had soo much fun!!!
**Monday**
Monday wasn't such a good day.  I stayed home sick and slept all day which was nice.  I have been on the go since school started and I don't think I have ever gotten to sleep in..it suxs...and I got sick so my mom decided that I sounded like a I was dying and she told me to go back to bed!! It was great.  But I still went to practice because I wanted to run in the meet. And I had to work which kinda suxed.  Everyone has left Culver's...I really really need to get out of there!! Its getting serious!! HaHa
**Tuesday**
We had our home cross country meet. It was pretty good.  I kinda got stuck in a bad position because I lost contact with the group in front of me and I didn't ever catch up to them.  I mean I think I did pretty good, I was just hoping for a faster time. My dad, Janae, and Kennedy all came. That was exciting.  We went out to eat afterwards and that was a ton of fun!! Kennedy is so much fun..I love her to death!!!  Then I went out TPing..OMG..Greatest ever. All the XC seniors got together to tp people we don't like on the team.  We got a couple houses and then we got Kelsey.  I tricked her into believing that I wanted to go out tping with her but when I got there to meet up with her there were like 10 of us!!  We covered her in Ketchup, Mustard, Mayo, Syrup, and this NASTY cheese stuff that Dale found in the back of his fridge!! And then Harris nailed her with an egg from like 3 feet away!!  Yeah and then we were driving and we saw someone in all black so we chased him and then Dale and Pete tackled him.  Yeah poor kid..they covered him in syrup and stole all of his stuff!!
**Wednesday**
I had to work so I didn't get to go out..I was semi-pissed...but I still didn't feel good so I wanted to go to bed.  I am pretty sure I had a mental breakdown when I got home though.  At work JK talked to me for almost half an hour about things going on in her life.  She was crying and the whole nine yards...I felt super bad because I didn't really know what to say but I think it was one of those times when she just wanted to get everything out and she just needed someone to listen.  But it got me thinking about things in my life.  And I came home and bawled in my mom's room for almost an hour.  It was so bad.  I guess I felt better after...but still....I just wish I had answers to some things...but I doubt I will ever get them, and I am just going to give up.  I can't keep trying for things that are going no where.
**Thursday**
Another AWESOME nite.  Powder Puff was kick ass!! My team won 56-14!!  It was sooo much fun!!  I got some tackles...well I guess we didn't really tackle...but ya know...then it was out for some more fun.  All the seniors went to Mal's house and ate a pre-tp dinner.  Then we had a HUGE senior train.  There were almost 20 cars.  We got a bunch of people but then we had to split up cuz the police were following us.  But i went an got Chelsea. It was the best ever.  We crammed 6 people in my car and went out to the middle of no where. HaHa..Gotta love her farm!! When we got there her dog was freaking out..so we were all trying to be quiet so it wouldn't see us or anything.  We first tped one house on the side where we couldn't be seen.  But then we befriended the dog and played fetch with it..so it stopped barking!!  We got her house super good. Her porch was saran wrapped together, we tped her quite well and she got some condiments on her porch and grass. But the best part was our industrial strength packing tape. It was prolly a foot in width and we taped all her trees together...haha best ever.  But wait..there is more.  She has goats....so we spray painted 05 on them..and me being the brave one...I did it!! HaHa!! But at least she isn't mad!!
**Friday**
It was soo rainy and cold today.  I went tailgating at 5 and it rained and I froze my ass off!! It was worth every minute of it...but I thought I was gonna die!!  My lips were turning purple..which I most def don't think is a good thing!!! HaHa!! We won homecoming though!! It was sooo exciting since we haven't won in soo long!!!  I love football games!!!  
But yeah..that's about it..Or at least all im gonna write.  I am still cold and I am gonna go to bed!! 
Dance is tomorrow and I can't wait!!!
Luv Always!!!"

Last nite at work everyone was giving me tons of lectures!!  Jen was mad cuz she said I coulda got alcohol poisoning.  And she was telling me how stupid I was.  And then Dustin was talking about how I scared him so much because I definitly passed out in the bathroom in front of the door so no one could get in.  And then i guess he finally got in and i wouldn't move and he couldn't wake me up.  I remember being able to hear him but no being able to respond or move.  Yeah I am pretty sure they got me awake and then i just passed out again.  Hmm....good times..right?
Newayz Xc was great tonite.  Everyone was talking about how the course was really bad, but honestly i didn't think it was hard at all.  I got 10th!!  I was excited!! 
I went to Central over the weekend and OMG..I love it there.  I want to go there for college sooo bad!!  I dont know what it was but I just loved it there!!

I realized that things in her life and things in my life are really really similar.  I like our talks....i can really trust her...and I don't really trust a lot of people.  I like it...

I was really tired too for some reason. I don't even know why cuz I slept in.  Maybe it was the fact that I had a huge headache all last nite and it was still there when I woke up!!  Oo well..Neways...Work...yeah..So me and Dusty had a food fight for like 2 hours!!  Yeah he hit me in the face with a cod and then I threw a hot dog at him and it hit him in the face...it was HILARIOUS!!! Yeah we just kept throwing food at each other all nite.  He nailed me with a steak and it exploded on my back..so I most def have a huge blood stain on my nice white shirt. Oo well..I got him back.  At least he didn't spray water on me cuz he did that one other time and it was way bad since my shirt is way way thin!!!  
Yeah....So xc had officially started since we had our first meet on Thursday..I've decided I really need to start working my ass off at practice!!  I want to go to state so bad and I am not where I need to be.  But I will definitly start workin on that.  We run at Noel Ridge on Thursday..I am way excited because I LOVE that course!!!  
Yesterday I had to babysit all day!! It was crazy!! I have decided I don't want kids!! HaHa!! Seriously this kid is like 1 1/2 and he can't say anything so he just screamed all day, it was extremly frustrating!!  I told Nick that I wasn't going to have any kids and he said that he was gonna get me pregnant and then make me move back to Iowa from Cali..HaHa...RIIIGHT!!
Me and Nick hung out last nite.  Yeah......I don't even know what to say about that..We watched The Secret Window...It was a good movie!!  But yeah..I don't know what to think anymore!!

So school suxs...I hate government like no other...its boring and I don't get it.  So I am always frustrated.  Speaking of frustrated...I am way frustrated about things.  I just don't know what is going on in one aspect of my life.  And it just confuses the hell out of me.  All I can say is mixed signals are the worst when you still have strong feelings.  I don't know what to do anymore...all I can say is it is hard for me everyday.  But things are truly getting better.  
So Kelly is my lover!! She is the greatest thing that has ever happened to me...i swear without her I would die!!  She is so great to talk to and she makes everything all better for me!! I love it.  She is was easy to talk to and she is the best friend i have ever had.  And FYI...Kel is better than everyone....so fuck off!!! HaHa..Sorry....
Yeah so the other nite i was told that I use my friends..hmm...that was a great way to end a GREAT day (note the sarcasim) I swear I had a mental break down that nite.  I watched a movie until 12 and then something inside me snapped and i just started bawling.  And I couldn't stop. A lot of things had built up...I just wish I would have had someone there to hold me in their arms because that would have made me feel soo much better!!  But that didn't happen...so i just sat with my teddy and cried...and then i wrote a book in my journal just to get things out of my brain because they were making it start to hurt.  But yeah...
I hate ken..if anyone didn't know that.  I seriously wish he would die.  The last two weekend have been the worst ones ever.  I think he is the one who sent me over the edge on Sunday. He is an asshole and I don't know how much more I can take...honestly I hate him more than anything in the world.  He has hurt me so much and I can never ever forgive him for what he has done to me...even though he thinks we should be friends...haha...he can go fuck himself.

I didn't really hang out with many people from school this summer..even though me and Kel decided we didn't really want to hang out with other people... so it was good to see everyone again.  But Yeah...I was super mad cuz I had an ass load of homework and it was only the first day of school..but you know..it happens.  My schedule is great though cuz I am with Kel for half of my day!!  Its exciting.
Cross country was WAY WAY hot yesterday.  I was suppose to run 8 but I could only run 7..I got super dizzy and I had to take a break..hehe...I didn't want to fall over and die.  
I had to work last nite...that was ok..we were slow so it was mostly talk time.  I closed with Kel and Jen squared.  Yeah...good times at Culver's.
When I got home from work last nite I had the greatest convo with one of my California hotties..hehe....Yeah....about that.  Hmm....the beach sounds good.  LoL!!!  Newayz...He made me laugh!!!!
Yeah so I better go get ready for school..I Love having first block off!!

I'm way sad summer was over.  I kinda have mixed feelings about my summer. In some ways it was the best summer and in some ways it was the worst.  But whatever.. I wish somethings would have been different about my summer and I have a lot of regrets about it too.. But oo well its not like I can go back in time and change things.  
It seems like me and kel became super close this summer.  I guess that's what happens when you really need someone.  She was the only thing that kept me going for awhile this summer....I think I would have totally shut down and been just a blob of B. Whitsell if she hadn't been there.  I love her to death...what else can I say.  I can't wait until we get our apartment, its gonna be way fun!!!
Yeah...I don't really have a whole lot else to say...So I guess I'm Outie.

I don't know what the hell his problem is but he is a huge asshole.  I can't wait until I am 18 because then I don't have to deal with him anymore.  No one understands what he has put me through....only I do.  I hate his yelling, I hate his attitude, I hate the way he treats me and everyone else, I just hate him.  But Im not going to dwell on it because it just makes me hate him more and makes me not be able to be happy.  
Tonite I babysat for Kendall and Avery.  It was pretty fun...I mean as fun as babysitting can be.  We played outside and mostly just watched movies.  They were once again both sick, but I am use to it now because they seem to always be sick when I am there.  But at least they both went to bed without a lot of problems.  Kendall ended up waking up cuz she didn't feel good so she just slept in my arms downstairs...we were watching GAC...I gotta get her to like country..hehe...When Katie and Tyler came home it was really uncomfortable.  Tyler was drunk and he was just being weird.  I just wanted to get out of there.  I was leaving and I honestly didn't think they were gonna pay me...but then Tyler remembered that he was holding a check in his hand..yeah..way weird....
But then I got to come home to Ken...YaY..........
I can tell this is a start of yet another fun weekend. There haven't been any really bad ones lately, but I think this is going to be one of them and with everything that is going on with me right now I don't know if I can handle it...I might just get pushed over the edge...which is just what I need.

I seriously thought Rich and Carol were better people than they are.  But obviously I don't know them like I thought I did.  
Yesterday I swear I was on the verge of having a mental break down.  After I left worked I started crying and I just couldn't stop.  I called my mom but I couldn't even talk to her.  She really doesn't understand I don't think.  I don't think anyone really does.  I tried to call nick but he was at work...I think out of anyone he is the easiest to talk to...even though I feel like I am just complaining.  I always love talking to him cuz he makes things better....but I hate venting to him too cuz I feel bad...I just don't want to seem like I am always bitching about something.

Me and Jean were suppose to go to the rodeo tonite...but that didn't work out so good.  I think Im gonna go to a movie tonite with her though!! YaY!!!

Today at work we had this gay ass meeting and it just pissed me off more than ever.  Julie is such a bitch.  I got up and left.  And then I called my mom crying..but I only talked to her for like 3 seconds cuz I was so pissed I didn't even want to talk.  I hate work and its about to get way gay.  Last nite Jean walked out of work and she wasn't going to come to the meeting today but Carol convinced her to.  We made a plan that if things got bad we were just going to get up and leave.  If Rich and Carol weren't there I think it would have been a lot worse because Julie would have yelled at us hardcore!! But whatever...This meeting has made me want to put my two weeks in more than anything.  I really need to find a new job first though.
Yeah...So last nite was quite gay....Me and Kel had to use the old well we have to be home line...that always shows that it is a bad nite. HaHa!! Oo well...Tonite is gonna kick ass...I can't wait.  Pizza and Movies and M&M's...even though I need them more than Kel..HaHa!!

Me and Nick talked last nite.  I am pretty happy about how things worked out.  I just hope that we truly stay friends and it doesn't just last a week and then we never talk anymore.  I don't think I could go without talking to him.  He is prolly the only person I truly open up to about things, but that's cuz I know I can trust him and I don't really have that with anyone else.  Even though we are just gonna be bestest friends I will still always have a special place for him in my heart and I will love him forever...I don't see how I couldn't.  
Yeah so cross country has been way fun this week...haha...I just want meets to start.  They are the most fun.  But we still have a few weeks for that.  I just gotta keep working my ass off at practice. I want so bad to go to state.  I think that is probably the most important thing to me this year.  And this year I am not gonna do anything stupid like last year to mess it up.  Last year was bad and I'm not going back to that....ever....
I can't wait for tomorrow nite!! Me and Kel are having a sleepover!! YaY for powerpuff girls!! HaHa!! We are such dorks..Yesterday Kel told me I was grounded and I had to come to her room...naked...HaHa....We have way too much fun together.  I Luv Kel!!!!
Newayz....I need to get ready for XC poster pics......Later......
Luv!!!

"event","Yeah so I swear the weekend was one of the worst weekends of my life!!
Friday nite I had to close at work.  Closing wasn't too bad I guess.  We were all just complete idiots all nite.  Jp closed so I basically did nothing.  I changed it so that Kelly would be with me in the kitchen instead of Nate too.  It was Nate's last day cuz he's going to Iraq.  I was being super mean cuz hes kinda dumb and when you tell him to do something he just stares at you with his mouth hanging open..no joke.  But I asked people if it made them feel safe to know that he would be the person fighting for our country.  Everyone just laughed..oo well...I'm a bitch...what can I say.  
Saturday I went to the team run in the morning.  I ran 10 miles!!!!  I was way proud of myself!! I ran with Clark and Fetzer too!!  Coach said that he is going to have me do interval work this week while everyone else is getting back into shape!! Hopefully that will mean that I can be super good this year. I am really excited for cross country to start.  It is something that I am actually good at.  And I like that it isn't really a team sport. But yeah...I worked 11:30-5 and that was fun.  Me and Ralphie changed the position chart a bunch so that we liked it!! HeHe!! It was funny.  But Julie wasn't there so ya know...We were really slow Saturday.  Me and Dani were in teh kitchen and we just went to the back and got our buckets and we just sat all day unless food came up!! It was awesome.  But yeah.  Saturday nite was fun. 
Sunday I got to close once again.  I swear it was one of the worst days I have ever had at work.  Everyone was pissing me off...well more like a couple people.  But I was most def freaking out.  Everyone was yelling at everyone. It was terrible.  But shit happens.  Me and Dani were yelling at each other but we were mostly joking...especially cuz we were talking like sid the sloth!! HeHe!! But yeah...It was weird Sara, Ralphie and Me all worked the exact same hours Friday, Saturday, and Sunday!! CRAZINESS!!! But newayz..Last nite when I came home I was in such a bad mood and I was super frustrated and stressed about everything.  I talked to my mom for a lil bit and then I took a shower and then I went in my room and cried.  It was sad...but I am seriously frustrated with EVERYTHING in my life.  Nothing is going right right now.  I got to talk to Kel about things for a lil bit at work but it seems like everytime I went to the kitchen to talk to her a customer came and I had to go back up front.  Oo well though. 
Yeah so Josh won't stop calling me.  It is really starting to piss me off like no other!! He calls me like 5 times a day!!  I haven't answered for 4 days and he doesn't get the point!! I swear I am going to go crazy if he keeps calling me!!! Oo well...Newayz....Better get ready to go to FUN FUN work!! HaHa!!!
Luv!!!

Whatever...All I know is that I HAVE to find a new job...but newayz...
Yeah...SO I have a new stalker...what is with me and stalkers??  Yeah so Josh won't stop calling me and its getting WAY annoying.  I was suppose to go on a date with him last Monday but I kinda cancelled...yeah and so now he thinks we are still gonna do something and he won't stop calling me.  My phone rang last nite at work so I answered it.  When I answered it someone said hey good lookin hows it goin...yeah way to freak the fuck out of me.  And then he wouldn't tell me who is was, he just kept saying that I knew who it was.  But since I was at work guess I couldn't talk to him long...so he said he was gonna call me back at 1030 since I had to close.  So he called me at 1030,1100, and 1130.  Yeah I most def didnt answer.  I feel bad cuz he is Stacey's son and all, but come on..can't he get the hint.  Then he called me like 3 times today when I was at work. WHATEVER THOUGH!!
Work was ok today.  Julie wasn't there.  Last nite it was super funny.  I got out write up sheets..Me and Sara both filled one out for julie, but we of course didn't turn them in....But to say the least we were laughing out asses off!!!

Julie decided she wasn't going to put up the position chart and we were all suppose to just pick what we wanted to do. Hmm..can you say madness?? But whatever.  I really need to go look for a new job.  But I never have time because I am always working and stuff..Errr...
Its weird..Lately I have gotten really really insecure about everything.  I mean I already don't have any self confidence, but it seems like I am worried about everything.  I just hope things don't get as bad as they were last year around this time.  My mom would kill me..but yeah...we aren't gonna go there.  I guess I am just worried about many things...oo well...
Tonite is Monopoly nite!! HaHa!! I am excited.  We are all going to Stacy and Jean's apartment to play when everyone gets off of work.  We are all such dorks.  But we were all talking about how we haven't played board games in a long time so we decided that it would be fun to do!!  
Last nite after Chilis I went to Cam's house.  Jean, Kyle, and Brad were there.  They were playing ping pong and me and jean just watched.  It was way funny cuz they were really getting into it.  Kyle was getting super pissed cuz he wasnt winning!!  Oo well..then we went inside cuz it was too cold.  We were gonna play Catch Phrase but I had to go home and Jean wanted to leave to.  Oo well!!

The biggest thing right now is what's going on with Stacey. Its so sad!!   I guess Stacey and Julie have always had probs but Julie made it impossible for Stacey to work.  I can understand why Stacey quit and all but no one is happy about it.  Sara called me bawling yesterday and told me I had to come to work right away.  Both her and Jean were way upset.  I of course cried to.  I mean Stacey was our mom at Culver's, if we had a problem with anything we could always go to her and she would help us.  Yesterday we just sat and talked about all the good memories we had and of course it just made us all cry again.  Cam was super pissed too.... Its weird at work right now.  The whole mood of the place has changed.  We are all there but its almost like we just do what we are suppose to with no enthusiasism at all.  We all miss Stacey. Stacey called me tonite and it made me cry.  She is soo nice.  A bunch of us are gonna go see her tomorrow, and I know we will all be crying.  Its weird.  At work the way we talk its almost like she died.  I mean we sat and talked about all the memories we have and stuff.  I hate julie. And we are all gonna go find new jobs and quit!!  
Yeah..so yesterday I had my senior pictures.  It was fun!! I really wish I could see what they look like though.  But I have to wait 2-3 weeks!! Thats No fun...Oo well..I think Im gonna go To bed...I need sleep.
All I have to say is....
I'm So Frustrated With Life Right Now...And its majorly stressing me out.  I have WAY to many things on my mind....I'm Troubled!!

So I had just fallen asleep and my bro came to bug me.  And then Julie called me twice.  It was gay.  There was no way I am going into work today.  HaHa!! But yeah..Then I made plans...so..so much for my nap. Oo well...Thursday when I am going to Cornell I can sleep for a lil bit.  But yeah.  So last nite I talked to Nick for a lil bit.  I am still super pissed.  Like I don't think anyone realizes how pissed I was two nites ago.  Well maybe my legs...since I went running and I puched myself like no other.  Yeah...I think me and Nick are gonna have to talk tonite.  Because I can't keep playing games with him he needs to decide what he wants.  That will prolly never happen with my luck. But whatever.  Today I went to the team run.  It was ok.  I feel bad because once again I started running with the girls but then I ditched them to run with Ryan and Andy.  They are more of my pace.  But yeah...I'm not sure who I am going to be able to run with this year at practice cuz Lauren is gone.  Maybe Amanda even though she is freakin fast...but i guess she slacks at practice.

All weekend I have been looking forward to Sunday.  Me and Nick were gonna hang out.  It was all I could talk about at work, I felt like a little kid on Christmas.  Seriously...I was almost to the point where I was going to count down the hours.  Well I guess that whole thing got fucked up.  I don't even really know what happened.  All I can say is that I wish I was with Nick right now and not writing in this damn thing.  He won't even talk to me.  It hurts so bad.  I swear its like the nite we broke up all over again...I never knew it could hurt so bad to love someone.  I mean I have never cried so much for a person before in my life.  I wish I would just wake up and this would all just be the worst nightmare I have ever had.  This has been the worst weekend of my life.  I was already stressed out enough and it seems as though every day this weekend my stress level just keeps going up.  I hate it all......

Ok so last nite I had nothing to do and I ended up at Culver's because I told Jen that I would come in and see her.  I wanted to show her my hair to...its way kick ass, even if my mom doesn't like it.  But yeah we talked about the usual...you know..how guys love to mess with your mind and break your heart over and over again.  Yeah...We are definitly in the same boat. But I ended up helping them close.  It was funny. Customers were looking at me really weird cuz I was in regular clothes and I was cleaning tables and stocking dining.  Oo well.  After that I went to Sara's house so she could change and then we were going to go to Wal Mart over by Westdale.  First we stopped at a bar where her parents were.  It was craziness.  I got hit on by this super drunk guy.  He was introducing himself to me and I shook his hand and then he kissed my hand...that's about the point when me and Sara decided it was time to leave. LoL...But yeah...we were most def at Wal Mart until 12.  My mom called me and was like are you planning on coming home tonite..hehe..I don't think she was mad though.  But yeah..Craziness.  
This morning I got to wake up to Ken [the asshole] freaking out on Aaron. GREAT way to wake up in the morning. I was pissed because I really wanted to sleep in.  But yeah..So I had to get up and save Aaron.  I hate ken so much.  He has been trying to be nice to me because he thinks we should get along etc...its GAYNESS!! HaHa..Today he pissed me off soo much.  The things he was saying to Aaron were way mean..and it just wasn't even right.  So before he left I yelled at him and it felt way good.  I wanted to say so much more to him but I couldn't.  I was shaking I was so pissed off. I called my mom and yelled at her to..I feel bad becuase she is always stuck in the middle.  Oo well... But I went for a run and that got my frustration out.  I was definitly hauling some major ass. I swear sometimes running saves my life.  It is the only way I can think.  
Yesterday me and Cam went running.  It was fun.  He is such a dork.  We just talked the whole time.  And of course we bitched about gay Culver's.  HaHa!! Surprise Surprise.

"event","The past couple days have been the hardest days of my life.  Nick broke up with me on Thursday and I have been a mess since then.  The hardest part is that I don't know why and the fact that he won't talk to me.  I swear to god I am falling apart.  I haven't eaten since Wednesday when we went out to lunch for my birthday.  My mom came into Culver's last nite when I was on my break to try to get me to eat and food just makes me sick.  I just don't know what to do.  EVerytime I think I have a handle on myself something happens to make me think of him and I burst into tears.  Its a miracle I didn't have a complete break down at work.  Last nite when I came home from work me and my mom watched a movie and I ended up sleeping in her room...it was kind of sad. But I dunno.  I just can't take it anymore.  I lost my best friend and I don't even know why.  All I want to do is talk to him.  I know exactly what I want to say and it will take all of 5 minutes...but I guess I am no longer important enough for that.  Tuesday is going to be the worst day ever...that would have been our one year anniversary.  Since I took the day off of work..I will prolly sit in my room and cry all day.  I will never be able to get over Nick..no matter what.  I can't even imagine myself with another guy.  
LIFE SUXS!!!!
I wish someone would just shoot me....."

"event","Ok...So all last nite and for the past few hours I have been preparing myself to do the most important thing that I will have to do.  I am SUPER scared and nervous.  I don't want to lose my best friend and the only person I truely trust.  I have down what I am going to say and I guess all I can do is hope that it works.  Last nite I was a mess.  I went into Culver's cuz I wanted to see Kelly, and I just started crying there.  Holz came out and said some really nice things to me and said she loved me...it was sweet.  Then I talked to my dad for like an hour.  He is really the person who calmed me down.  He said I should go to the wedding with him this weekend and get drunk to help with my probs.  I tried to talk to Carol cuz I wanted to go..I mean me and my dad had it all planned out.  But I would feel soo guilty because it's Culver's birthday on Saturday and EVERYONE is working. So it will be ok.  Last nite Kel helped me out soo much.  I wouldn't have a clue what I was going to do today if I hadn't talked to her.  I mean she got me on the right path and then I figured out what needs to be done.  I am so nervous and scared.  I haven't eaten anything since lunch on Wednesday...with Nick...Its bad.  But I can't eat...I just can't find anything that sounds good to me.  I went running yesterday and like 3:30 and since I hadn't eaten I died. I for real thought I was going to pass out.  And now I just shaking a lot.  I mean I can't go without eating for more than a few hours...I have had bad experiences with that in the past.....but I just can't get myself to eat.  Maybe after I talk to Nick then things will be better and I can finally get on with things. But newayz...its almost time...So I need to do some calming.
Luv!!!"

"event","Yeah so today is my birthday...and its suppose to be a good day right...HA!!  I could only wish.  I worked all day which wasn't too bad...I mean I worked with ok people and we weren't too extremly busy.  It was really sweet...Nick called me and left me a message at the time I was born...That made my break better.  Nick came over when I got off of work...He got me a SUPER cute and SUPER soft teddy bear...and it was my fav color!!  And he got me REALLY pretty pink roses.  I was soo happy.  I was sad though cuz he had to work.  I really wanted him to go out to eat with us.  But yeah...So I guess...this is when the story takes a shitty turn.  I honestly didn't think Nick had to work and I think he just went to Harper's party.  I went to Hy Vee to get gas last nite and guess who wasn't at work...but whatever...I am sure there is some sort of explination for it.  But to say the least it ruined my birthday.  I came home to have cake and open my presents but I was crying and I didn't even eat any of my cake and its my fav kind to.  But whatever.  I called Nick and 10 since that's when he was suppose to get off because I wanted to make sure we were still hanging out tomorrow.  But he was already at Harper's friend's house.  And he was already drunk.  Great b-day present for me.  I guess I feel like shit and Obviously I am not very high on Nick's priority list.  Whatever...No one Loves me....But at least me and Kel hung out so it didn't end up to be a terrible nite....ecept for the part when I cried myself to sleep."

Maybe if things in my life weren't so fucked up I would be more excited.  But whatever....we'll see how tomorrow goes.  Maybe I will just stay at work till like 8 or something...that would be fun!!  HaHa!!  Newayz....Me and my mom went shopping tonite....well we just went shopping for a dress for me to wear in my senior pics.  Its super cute!! I can't wait to show Kelly...Hopefully she will like it. I was over at her house forever today.  I love that girl!! For real...I don't know what I would do without her...she's always there for me!!!  Yeah today was rather boring though.  I was at Culver's twice today and the second time I was there for at least half an hour.  I sat and talked to Cam for awhile since he was on his break...and I was just being social cuz everyone wanted to know about my trip and all that good stuff.

"event","Ok so I have decided that I should just give up on everything.  I swear I hate life.  So my dad got super pissed at me on our last day in Florida...Surprise Surprise.  It happenes everytime I go to see him.  Cuz we are on a dead run for 7 days straight and then I get tired and when I am tired I just get quiet and I am just kinda daydreaming.  Well when I get quiet my dad thinks I am pissed at him and so he in return gets pissed at me.  I swear its not even worth it to go to my dad's anymore because when I leave we are always both pissed at each other and then we don't talk to each other for a couple weeks...WHATEVER
So the last day we were at Florida I was getting ready and I called my mom crying because of all teh drama with my dad.  I mean I couldn't wait to come home to see my mom beacuse I missed her a ton.  Lately  we have become really close....So at about Iowa City my phone rings....its my mom...yeah so her Ken the asshole and Aaron are going to a movie.  WOW...My love level went from not very much to none at all...The day was just turning out to be PEACHY!! Whatever!! I DON'T CARE ANYMORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
All I can say is I guess I and a bitch and a stupid piece of shit.....

"event","So I have been in Florida for a week...so this is gonna be super long since I have a lot of catching up to do.  Me and Nick drove to my dad's house on Friday..it was fun.  Then we picked up Kagers from school...and of course the real fun started. HAHA..NOT!!!  She is super annoying.  I feel really bad saying that since she is my sister and all but I think its the only child factor goin on.  But whatever.  Florida was so much fun.  Fourth of July was the best.  I think I was the happiest girl in the whole entire world that nite.  I got to watch the fireworks in Nick's arms.  I know it may sound cheesy..but after everything...it was just the best feeling in the world.  I love him so much and I swear I fell in love with him all over again that nite.  The first few days we were in Florida were kinda boring.  I mean we went to the beach and stuff but we really didn't do anything.  Wednesday Sal and Leon (Janae'e aunt and uncle) came and had lunch with us.  It was fun.  Then Thursday Nick and I went Parasailing.  I love parasailing because you are floating above the water and its really pretty and just really quiet.  We were on the boat with these two drunk girls and OMG they were ANNOYING!!  They wouldn't stop talking and it was about WAY annoying stuff.  As soon as they were up in the air the guys driving the boat started talking some MAD shit about them.  I just laughed.  Friday everyone but Janae went Jetskiing.  It was fun.  Kennedy had a BLAST!! She was really scared when we were driving over there but once she got on the jetski she just wanted to go faster.  She also learned a GREAT trick....she now knows how to flip people off. The funny thing is that she doesn't know how to do it with her finger sticking up so she just points it out straight..WAY WAY funny...but not a good thing for a 4 year old to know how to do.  But Florida was WAY WAY fun.  Me and Nick decided we are going to move down there and rent jet skis and chairs and sell hats.. It will be fun!!

I thought I was going to die because I hadn't eaten anything all day and it was hot out...but I didn't die...so I guess that's good.  Last nite I babysat for Kendall and Avery. They are super cute. Kendall was sick and she fell asleep in my arms at like 645 so me and Ave just watched Finding Nemo...that's the greatest movie EVER!!! Haha!! I am such a dork!!  But yeah..The nite was very uneventful and very long.  I dind't get home till almost 2!! But oo well.  I slept in way late today.  I got up at 1230 and just laid in bed for awhile.

Now I just have to paint it.  So yesterday me and RPG were in charge at work and we were both off at three.  Fuckin Stacy Smock did the walk through two hours later and wrote everything imaginable up. Its gay.  She is always such a bitch when she does the walk through.  Her ass is on the line because she always screws up...so the next time she messes up she will prolly lose her crew chief position again.  But whatever.  So Julie wrote me and RPG a letter saying how the walk through was unacceptable and that if it happened again we would be suspended and no longer part of the management team. It was gay.  Everything that was on the walk through was done.  But yeah..so customers come to Culvers a lot and things get dirty...its impossible to keep the store spotless while customers are there. I just think its really unfair for her to get all mad.  But Ralph wrote a bunch of stuff up on his walk through cuz Stacy was in charge.  When I came into work Stacy came up to me after i read my letter and said she was sorry, but I just looked at her and walked away.  I hate her....She's a stupid bitch.  But whatever.  Tonite was the worst nite at work though.  Me and RPG both closed and since our ass's are on the line we made sure the store was spotless...we were there till 11!!  That is the latest I have ever been at Culver's.  But I am the manager in the morning so I will make sure the walk through is good.  Tonite I switched so that I was in the kitchen...it was good cuz Kel was back there...we just talked the whole time.  I haven't talked to her forever so we had a lot of catching up to do...and some great stories to tell...HeHe!!!!  I love Kel...she's the greatest!! But newayz...I needed to vent and since Nick has to get up early I wasn't able to vent to him...which was prolly ok...cuz I feel bad when I vent about work..cuz I always find something to complain about.
More Later!!

"event","Ok...So yesterday was one of the worst days of my entire life.  But in a way I am semi glad it happened.  I almost lost my best friend and the most important person in my life.  I'm still not sure what was wrong exactly but I have some what of an idea.  I regret so many things that I have done over the past few days.  If I could go back in time I would, without even thinking twice.  Yesterday I couldn't do anything.  It felt like I cried all day, and when I wasn't crying, I was just a blob of Brittany.  On my way to work I had calmed myself down but as soon as I walked into work I lost it.  I mean I wasn't bawling or anything like that...I just shed a few tears...I just sat in the office for a few minutes and then got to work.  Work was good for me so that I could keep my mind off of what was really going on.  Last nite when I called Nick, it was super hard. I was trying to sound happy and as if nothing was wrong, even though it wasn't true at all.  But I made it through the conversation, and it was a really good one.  Today was a good day though.  Nick went with me to Running Wild to get my new running shoes..YAY...and things were a million times better.  When he was getting out of my car and he told me he loved me, that made my day.  I went home with a huge grin on my face.  I fell in love with him all over again....The thought of losing him scares me to death....That was the hardest part about yesterday....no matter what I did I couldn't make things better and it wasn't like I could force him to not be mad.  But I am soo glad things are better now.  I went to work today to get my check...it was soo funny there were about 10 employees there.  We were having a partay...haha..Stacey was a little mad about it.  But I think she was only joking.  I talked to Kelly for a long time in the parking lot.  I luv that girl to death. She is my best friend.  I don't know what I would do without her, she always has the best advice!!!! 
Newayz...This is super long!!

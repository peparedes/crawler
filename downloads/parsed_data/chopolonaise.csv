"event","maybe you've already read this on my myspace, but if you haven't, you need to read this. i need to spread the word about my love. my drink. my stella artois.


<center><underline><b>a tribute to stella artois:</center></underline></b> 

Stella Artois is so ace, that i am COCKSURE in stating the following opinion: stella artois is the new fucking H2O. in fact, it is so spanking fresh, that it isn't even an opinion. it's an absolutely indisputable fact. even oj simpson's lawyer would be lost for words if he tried to state otherwise. that's how distinguished this beer is. even though i've only consumed barely a double digit quantity of this liquid god, i am enrolling in AA tomorrow morning because i'm already that in love. i probably think about it more than hugh heffner thought about naked women at the age of 14. people might say that being as big of an alcoholic as i soon will be would be considered fucking my life over, but this beer reaches such a level of excellence, that i conclusively view it to be the utmost boss thing that has ever been presented to my once grotesquely feeble, abstinent life. if there is a heaven, and i go there when i die; if by extraordinarly unfortunate chance they tell me that stella is only attainable in hell, i'd bolt down there at such a hightail, electrifying degree of speed without even a pre-single thought, that while i zoom by earth for the final time, every person's face on the planet would simply rip off. clothes as well. thanks to stella, the last time i see earth, i would see everyone in their true skins: naked as fuck, and without faces. as long as i had my stella, i'd feel more accomplished living the remaining time of all eternity neck deep in shit with terrorist hell children tearing my limbs off from every direction for a good laugh, hitler raping me from behind, serial killers stabbing me in the chest with dull spoons and used needles - and not only used needles, but used needles with every uncurable disease possible so that i could live the rest of time experiencing my body rotting and shitting itself through my fucking nostrils - than having to suffer in a stella deprived dystopia like heaven. wherever the stella is, that's where i'll be. in my own personal utopia with stella nailed to my hand liked jesus christ to the cross. thankyou, thankyou, and thankyou again, stella, for helping me make my life, finally complete."

so i snuck out at about 1230 and met lindsey hubbard mccallister and andrew the bookkeeper at sugar over on pike and broadway and it was awesome. i had 2 shots of jaegar and a rum and coke and remained with a very nice buz the entire time. clearly not drunk, but borderline tipsy/buzz. then we were outside smoking and this guy rides his bike into me and he's like SORRY SORRY and izallzlike itzcooitzcoo and he's like ""yah...i did that on purpose. you're gorgeous."" and izallzlike ""thanks"" and hezallzlike ""i'm justin"" and izallzlike ""i'm liz"" and then hezallzlike ""let me kiss you on the cheek yr gorgeous"" and izallzlike ""okay"" and then lindsey was smashed ass drunk and she kept running across streets and andrew was still in his work clothes and it was weird and then we walked over to lindseys (BTW IN THE HOTTEST SHOES EVER. I BOUGHT THESE SHOES THAT LOOK SOOOOOO VALENTINO AND I GOT THEM FOR 19 DOLLARS. I TELL EVERYONE I BOUGHT THEM FOR 18 THOUGH I DON'T KNOW WHY.) and then we got there and i was finishing my ciggarette on the balcony and this guy was doing some kind of ninja move but he somehow kicked it out of my hand! it was miraculous.

he was against smoking too so how he's all about kicking ciggs out of people's hands. i told him to do it all the time.

i also bought new foundation at sephora. and usually i get a foundation a lot a bit darker than i usually am because i have been ashamed of my pastiness for quite some years now, due to this pathetic trend of over tanning. but just today, i have come to except how ridiculously pale i am. and i bought the palest of the palest of the paleyest foundation i could find at the store besides for geisha face white. and it matched my face better than any other foundation ever in existence. and i have decided to take pride in it - because i can pull off blonde better than anyone the end you lose. p.s. you lose the end. word."

You are a person who thinks before acting, intelligent and thorough.
You are affectionate, passionate, expressive, and future-oriented.
You are a talkative person, maybe even a busybody!

1. i have become a doorslut at old spaghetti factory.
2. one of my managers said i could possibly be a busser by january which would be sweet.
3. looking for a second job so i can move out sooner.
4. bought more clothes the other day which did not help #3.
5. enjoyed washington state's last day of fun at minnie's with ashleigh kilmer and her boyfriend.
6. went to a fucking bombass party last night with alexis, jeffrey thomas and darbuck. it was an american leisure party so i went as a CEO woman attending her yacht party in 1983. alexis and jeffrey were the pirates that took over my ship and darbuck wore a smoking jacket and slippers. everyone at the party actually dressed up which was crazy cuz it's not too often you plan a theme and everyone follows it - anyways - the point is it was the best party i went to in awhile. 
7. i got my septum pierced. i would show pictures of the inside of my nose, but of course, my camera died on me.
8. my hair is back to platinum white - and aubrie and i are planning on growing it to our waists. it's going to be pretty hot.
9. i grew half an inch this year.
10. my family is having a holiday cocktail party tonight so i'm stoked to drink the leftovers.
11. there's this really tall guy at work that i kinda dig but he doesn't dress the way i want m'man to dress so i'm going to either have to stop being shallow, or say fuck it and stay shallow.
12. or i could just wait until he realizes that i want a guy that dresses nicely and then he'd dress nicely and tell me that he was in love with me and that he would take me shopping.
13. the word of the week: scrotum.
14. i don't actually know how to spell scrotum.
15. i really want a new camera."

<big><big>Once upon a time there was a babysitter that hadn't gone anywhere warm for quite some time so she was very pasty and had no sign of a tan whatsoever. It bothered her very much.




<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v242/chopolonaise/b78cecb8.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">
There were also two girls. They needed a babysitter for the night.




<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v242/chopolonaise/d79aa08c.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">
They all ate pizza. And there was much rejoicing.

Then they all played a lovely round of Halo. But unfortunately, the babysitter didn't really have very much experience with videogames so she didn't know what to do except for shoot at the sky, and be killed over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over again. And over again as well.




<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v242/chopolonaise/swedishfishcopy.jpg"" alt=""Image hosted by Photobucket.com"">
Throughout the night, they all ate Swedish Fish.

And tried to set up as many affairs as possible on the Sims.

The night was finished off with a dance party on a very expensive white ottoman. Girls One and <strike>Three</strike> Two performed ritual dances to the Black Eyed Peas, with pillow cases pulled over most of their bodies.






The End."

"event","lately has been pretty disappointing, but i'm not complaining. i've personally chose to sit on my ass all day. i'm still unemployed, still skeptic about reattending college next fall, and have definetely gained back 5 pounds. i really want to get out and do something, but at the same time, i really just...don't. i've tried doing art stuff and stuff but nothing really comes to my head except for ""i haven't eaten for a whole 5 minutes."" tv is one of my all time loves and i'm starting to loathe it. i have been practicing the piano a lot lately though, but not enough to feed my needs to accomplish something. i'm not talking to my mom because i'm sick of her, and because she's crazy. she talks to herself all the time and it's most definetely annoying to say the least. i really want to think of something funny to say because this entry is so serious and it makes me sound like i'm depressed but i'm not depressed. i've just lost interest in things i onced loved doing, i don't want to leave my bed, and i break out into a crying fit for no apparent reason. i have to thank my parents for, (besides for giving me fantastic genes when it comes to brain chemistry,) raising me in the northwest. especially when winter hits early. i love taking walks, but since i've kinda quit smoking, one main point of my walk has diminished, so finding new hiding spots no longer gives me a feeling of, ""hooray"" but instead, ""this is so dumb."" i no longer have a dog so there are no dog walks, i'm fucking sick of walking up and down hills, and walking most definetely means doing something that doesn't require...doing nothing. i was really looking forward to this year. i was looking forward to having a full time job - coming home - sleeping - having money - and then going shopping on my days off - saving for trips to the east coast and back to germany - and maybe even having a car to drive around in aimlessly. i meant to join another dance studio but i don't want to search for one.  i don't know, maybe even get a place of my own this year but this month is already looking like november through april of last year minus christmas break. i just really hope i get this job i applied to the other day. i'm sick of being unmotivated - i'm growing too listless to even find joy in complaining, whining and contradicting. with anyone. if i don't get this job, i guess i'll start looking into colleges. and if you know me well, then you know that the sentence a couple of sentences ago that ended with the word, <b>colleges</b>, made my <lj-cut text=""face look like this."">

"event","so hopefully lise will read this, but probably not. anyways, here are some more ""pod"" moments. 

so i'm watching the fifth element and my mom starts yelling my name quite hysterically. so i run into the kitchen and she points to the floor and yells/""asks:"" ""What were you eating?!?"" and i look at the floor and there is this like infinitely small pile of crumbs on the ground and i say ""i don't know"" and she starts screaming ""WELL CLEAN IT UP JESUS LIS YOU'RE 20!!!! [WHY AM I SO CRAZY SOMEONE SHOULD SEDATE ME]"" and then looks like she's about to start crying because of the pile of crumbs on the ground. and then later she comes in the tv room and she's like, ""soooo did you happen to make enough of whatever you made in the oven [right beside the pile of crumbs on the ground that nearly killed me because the site of it was stronger than a bunch of giant lasers that shot out venemous beams of e. coli and even worse, dust.] to share with me?"" and i lied and said ""no"" because she's a freak. i told her that too. and she told me i was really ungrateful but i made a comeback and told her that she was crazier than me but then she made the ultimate burn and said ""yah right"" and i was like damn. 

then later, both my mom and dad start yelling, again, hysterically, ""LIS LOOK OUTSIDE THE WINDOW! LOOK AT DOWNTOWN! LIS HURRY!"" and so i'm like COOL! EXPLOSIONS!!! and i thought something was being attacked or aliens or like a tornado or something cool because they were freaking out and then i run to my sisters room and look outside and <lj-cut text=""i saw"">

<big><big><big>A RAINBOW.</big></big></big> so i'm just staring out the window like what the fuck this is stupid i thought the planet was under attack and it turns out to be a rainbow. and then i hear my mom running up the stairs as fast as she could with the video camera like the rainbow is just going to run off and elope before she can get upstairs and so of course i tell her that and she says ""well...so sorry...ms...asshole...now get out of my way."""

"event","the day i flipped my calendar page to august, i randomly closed my eyes and circled a part of the page with a red pen, opened my eyes and saw that i circled august 25th. i don't really know why but that's what i did. so of course, i had been anticipating today for about 25 days...and today was indeed, perhaps a day to remember.

BECAUSE IT WAS SOOOOOOOOO SPANISH.

yesterday, was a day long date with israel, my 31 year old peruvian of the moment. it was very spanish. 

then today, before work as i sat outside on the westlake benches enjoying an iced coffee, a pretty cute ecuadorian played sweet love on his guitar for me. in spanish. IT WAS SOOOOOO SPANISH. and his drunk friend got down on his knees as the ecuadorian was playing for me and asked, ""what are your deepest desires?"" ecuad. said his friend was very spiritual. and i guess so. but i don't think he was spanish. he lived in the udistrict.

then this morning, before allllll of this happened, (H)* called me and said he would be in seattle tonight. and i didn't know what to do with my life because it felt kinda spanish even though he isn't spanish but it made my heart flutter.





*he has a spanish name but i don't think he's spanish but he's my love that shouldn't be my love. it's quite dangerous. like the country columbia. which is sooooooo spanish."

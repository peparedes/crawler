"event","I swear up and down that I am the most cliche being around. Did I honestly just spend half an hour writing an ""About Me:"" that suits people to assume my own pre-established self-conclusions are truth? Yeah, I suppose I really am that pathetic. I even capped it off with a nice ""Feel bad for me. ;)"" just to make certain readers don't conclude that I'm full of self-pity. 

Delete, Square one.

I suppose it's a good thing I don't say 99% of these things going through my head. These days I constantly think I'm fading in and out of nonsense. I feel like I'm going insane. I can't neglect my prescriptions anymore, no matter how much I hate the thought of false optimism. They've proved more than once to be my straight jacket. Isn't that enough?

Another thought: Wishing on 11:11? Who the fuck ever decided that was cool? Eyelashes...shooting stars...penny wells? Bullshit. And if by the grace of God you happen to recieve the one thing you've been wishing for all this time, good for you. It wasn't luck, but fate. You might as well stop waiting for natural occurances and say a prayer.

And in case you were wondering: You can convince yourself all you want that you're atheist and without a religion, but as soon as you wish on a penny facing head up, you're a liar. Who are you wishing to if no one is there to listen? 

Now I'm bitching to an unknown online blog. Haha, awesome."

"event","How many judgements can an eye put forth before it's declared blind? How many lies can a stomach ingest before nausea hits eject? How many dreams can two palms crush before they become hard and callused?

What happens when you come to realization that everything you've ever lived for was a lie? Is comfort at all possible when your back lies in pieces, wrapped in remnants of false hopes? 

And who diagnoses the broken heart? Who decifers right from wrong? What kind of degree do angels need to save small children from the wrath of swimming pools?

They say to never look back, but who's to say looking back isn't the perfect remedy? After all, it was all the future once. Maybe if I found that exact moment in time, that flick of the switch, it would all make sense. Maybe if I had taken the time to mend the past, I could have avoided those four miserable years. Rather than looking forward, maybe I should have been forgiving the ghosts trailing behind. Maybe then my fingers wouldn't be mending such a mess of words. Maybe then I wouldn't be here, teary eyed and overtired.

Aside from it all, why is it that I feel the need to put that extra detail into everything I say? And when did I begin to lose confidence in my words? Who was it that spoon-fed my mind such horrible ideals? 

Was it me? Was it God? Was it fate?

It seems as if all I ever do is ask question after question. I can only hope that answers come with time. Time is all we've got, after all. Beginning to end, we're all just digging holes towards the same temporary treasure..

Freedom of mind. Whatever that means."

"event","When all is said and done, it's not going to matter who we are. No one's going to care about what you've done, or where I've been. A name will become little more than a figment of imagination, as will the image tagged alongside. Eventually, the few who choose to hold onto our memory will die off. Eventually, you and I will be forgotten. Existance is inevitable, and no candle burns forever. One day 'loyalty' will lose all meaning, and the sky will decode itself.

Intentions mean nothing; We all see the same smoke rising."

"event","It's amusing, really. When I was younger I dreamed of being an astronaut and part-time lion tamer. I wanted to be that person everyone wished they had been nicer to 'way back when'. I really believed that maybe my lonely, pathetic routine as a kid would make me more eligible for a good future (or something along those lines) in God's eyes. Surprisingly enough, it didn't. 

10 or so years have gone by since then, and I'm still sitting here- waiting for fate to knock me out. As far as those years go, I have absolutely nothing tangible to hold their memory. I've accomplished little more than ruining my metabolism and prescribing myself to capsulized false hopes. I'm not proud of the priorities I've set in the past few years, and I constantly fear the day my decisions come back to haunt me. I'm going nowhere fast, and it's about time I opened my eyes.

I can't be afraid anymore. I can't play it safe any longer. A year from now I'll be holding the rest of my life in the palm of my hand. Until then, I'm going to learn how to live."

"event","I wish there was some way to erase all the bad in a person. I wish that out of some insane grace of God, there was a remedy to hypocrisy. I hate the fact that I constantly judge people out of their wrong-doings, and yet I do the same in doing so. I wish that I didn't mock others for their lack of knowledge on a subject, while I tend to be so incredibly ignorant in so many areas. I wish that I had the motivation to read every book handed to me. The motivation to fill my head with the ideas of countless authors and journalists around the world. I hate knowing that it may take my entire life-span to learn all the things I would like to have learned by this point in life.

I wish I knew the directors of every major film in history. I wish I knew the names of each actor and actress that brings such films to life. I wish I could recognize significance in every motion picture of my time, as well as past generations' time. I wish I was educated enough to have a sit down conversation on little more than, say, Adrian Brody's film career.

I wish I could tell one genre from the next on the drop of a dime, and see the intentions of every form of music. I wish I could name every classical artist in the books, as well as each peice they have conducted. I wish I could keep up with Jacob during his endless musical rants, because the truth is: it's not that what he has to say isn't interesting, it's more that I'm simply not educated well enough on the subject to keep mental equalibrium.

I wish I could quote exerpts from some of the most influencial poets of our time, and have the ability to shadow the views of each author that lines library walls. I wish that I could speak with such meaning behind each word, that no breath would be left unaccounted for. Maybe then I wouldn't be so propt to judge. Maybe then I wouldn't feel such a need to be false.

I wish that I was confident enough in my intellectual capacity, that bumps and bruises would no longer hold me back. The day I can replace each of those wishes with confirmations, will be the day my fear subsides."

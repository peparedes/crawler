I had the privlage of washing my beloved dog TWICE today because he feels that the refreshing scent of lemon is just too.. undogly.

My brother and I are obliged to care for our little brother while my mother and stepfather attend a conference in Orlando.
The thing that really kills me-- momma just assumed that we'd have nothing else to do. Granted, I didn't, but whatev.

so thats all I can think of just now..but I'm still bitter."

it was weird today - mi mum came down today and we had a party--thats not the weird-- but apparently, she was conversing with a couple of total strangers at our local burlington coat factory, and they knew of me..from visiting the school in bay city. the girl said everyone thought i looked cool and they are all anxiously waiting for me to come..CREEPY. i am VERY frightened..

"event","It's amazing how time flies when you're having fun. Or maybe it's just when you leave this place. Either way it's true.<br /><br />I still can't believe what has been going on lately, both here, and outside of the warehouse, with certain people. It feels like&nbsp;two sides of me are&nbsp;colliding like trains, a wreck so horrid and mesmerizing&nbsp;you just can't seem to look away. Much is my life right now, but things are fortunately moving along...<em>slowly,</em> but surely<em>.<br /><br /></em>I have yet to see Fink since I have been back, which may be for the best. I <strike>can't</strike> don't need to deal with that right now. Actually, I was hoping to catch someone for a drink, either here or we can go out for the evening, just someone to talk with for a bit. I'm becoming fonder of social interaction (odd, I know).&nbsp;Speaking of people, how is the music coming along, boys? I'd like to hear something from you soon if at all possible. It's my fault for not being more strict about all of this, but I am sure you have been productive.<br /><br />Oh, and I did try the coffee this morning...what the fuck brand <em>is</em> that? Disgusting."

"event","I hope you see this, and I hope you read it <em>very</em> carefully.<br /><br />I am not sorry. I am not sorry for doing any of the things I've done, nor do I regret anything I have ever said to you. Living with you is impossible, <em>loving</em> you is impossible. I don't understand why I try, why I even care! Fuck, I am so mad at you, yet there is nothing I can do about it.&nbsp;<br /><br />I'm not sitting here crying, or being an immature child throwing fits, I am simply telling you how I feel...and since&nbsp;I can't stand&nbsp;the sight of&nbsp;you right now, this is the only way I can seem to do this.<br /><br />You were special, you were always the special one; that's why I treated you differently. It didn't occur to me that you had been hurt until you showed me, and that hurt me too. I meant what I said then, I most certainly don't regret having those feelings...but I feel like a damn fool&nbsp;for showing&nbsp;you. You think I am weak don't you? Did you have a good laugh? <br /><br />Take your damn gloves, take your filthy mask and malignant&nbsp;lies. I don't need them, and most certainly don't need you.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Svengali"

"event","I just woke up, still exhausted and rather hungry. Kind of lonely too.

I'm really not sure what's going on anymore.&nbsp;I honselty thought I knew everything I had to know, everything there was to know, but I was wrong. I experienced something I never felt before, but I'm not sure that's what I really needed...it's just fucking me up now.

While I laid in bed earlier, I had a lot to say,&nbsp;more than I probably should, but now&nbsp;I just don't have the energy to get into it all. I'm thinking a walk would do me good. i need to leave this&nbsp;house...the&nbsp;room.&nbsp;

Come find me if you want to see me. I'll be back...eventually.&nbsp;"

"event","Who would have thought that one mistake could lead to such...shit.<br /><br />I must say that I've had an interesting few days, drinking, sex, smoking and whatnot. Actually, I'm not all that bitter anymore, just restless. What I'd give for some clarity and perhaps some company. Just <em>regular</em> company.<br /><br />I should go and shove some things around in here considering it will never be <em>clean. </em>It'll just give the effect of looking that way.&nbsp;<br /><br />And Van, thank you."

"event","<p>Seems like just minutes ago I was ranting in this journal. Heh, least it's good for one thing. I really don't understand why I bother, other than keeping in touch with the band and knowing their whereabouts. Fuck. Why is this urge to break something so strong? I need another drink.<br /><br />Van, if you by any chance see this before the night is over, I'd like to talk to you about something. Meet me in the kitchen? I'll be down&nbsp;there scrounging for some more liquor...maybe something to eat.<br /><br />And a note to everyone, let's stop this unneccessary argument over who made or makes noise while fucking. It's done and over with. Do something constructive, like drinking...or fucking, but don't go off about who was being loud, for the sake of us all, just shuttup.<br /><em><br /></em>Pardon my bitterness, my wounds are closing awfully slow.</p>"

"event","Sitting here alone, again. I've only talked to the others briefly this morning, but they've all gone off doing their own things. Practicing is what they should be doing, considering&nbsp;a second&nbsp;album is long overdue. Ugh, that kleine schlampe hellion left one of his gloves in here...let's see if I remember to give it back.<br /><br />I'm not quite sure if I'd be more content wasting time doing shots here by myself, or going out...maybe someone would come with? Fuck that- I'll <em>make</em> them come. Ha, pun intended of course.&nbsp;And can someone please tell me where the FUCK you all were last night?! I heard you all trampling in at the crack of dawn, could have sworn you were all fucking on the stairs leading up to my room.&nbsp;Animals.&nbsp;<br /><br />Such a bitter entry for my first post. Oh well, least I'm not the ones hung over with their heads in the toilet.&nbsp;Bleh, the day is ending and so is my patience...forget going out now, I hear them in the other room. Abschied."

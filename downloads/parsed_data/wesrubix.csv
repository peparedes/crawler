The holidays are coming, and they're supposed to remind us of what's important. Presents, bills, snow tires, ice scrapers, though for you south-birds, just some rain and a pull over. 

What's important to you? really, truly important? 

However you answer that question, make sure you let your answer know how you feel."

I got really sick the other day. Fever, chills, headache, unusual back pains, painful and contracted throat, urges to throw up. Mom said it was a cold. I thought it was punishment from Above because I convinced Leah to take a sick day. That's love.

Returned the dehumidifer I bought the other day at Home Depot. Sure it got rid of the humidity in the room, but it also *heated* it by about 15+ degrees. Not normal. Home depot guys were surprised to feel the box was still warm when I brought it in tonight. Maybe it really was defective. The eventual plan is an Energy Star a/c, but waltham and watertown were out of the model I wanted. On-line in-store pickup maybe?

Most of my symptoms are gone, but the throat and dizziness are still messed up. I'll get there."

And the only lovely person I know with an H is Hannah. I hope it was her. I haven't talked to her in a long time, and what a conversation starter this would be.

The irony of this is that had someone like me ""discovered"" or ""figured out"" one of these Intel/Apple secrets, I don't think they'd come after me with ball-cutting. It'd probably be more in the form of them shrugging. I don't really predict much here. Usually I'm right on my hunches, but they aren't that far ahead in time or that prophetic considering how much information is already out there in the first place. Wait, that's not real irony. That's just rajinou.

The real irony is that one of my friends has a sister who has a myspace account that says she wished she had some balls to fulfill more of her life's dreams, and I was going to post something on her myspace about that, along the lines of, ""are you sure you want them? they're not terribly useful."""

"event","it's time for me to finally stop pretending things are all fine in my life. it's been stressful lately. i haven't been sleeping well for a handful of days now. everything's been hard on people close to me. I guess i kept things to myself because I didn't want to add to anyone's already difficult stress.

i'm not trying to get people to feel bad for me. i just needed to put these thoughts and feelings somewhere.

my dad got married on friday. just like the divorce, i thought it wouldn't bother me much, but it's finally catching up to me. i figured i could tell myself ""it doesn't phase me, and this is what he wants, so he'll be happy."" there were a lot of peculiarities that made the wedding difficult that i don't want to go into--for everyone involved, i'm giving them the benefit of the doubt: i doubt anything was done on purpose. how could my dad do anything on purpose anyway? he ALWAYS means well. he really does. and i love him for it. and i miss my dad.

the second thing is that my job at sun may not be so secure as everyone thought. this is especially troubling to me because i feel like i'm failing at the very core of how i was raised and what it means to be an asian american, as much or as little as i embrace my culture, i still strive so hard inside to do well just so my parents and my grand parents can be proud of me. and now i'm scared they can't. my manager wanted to give me a raise when he promoted me to Graduate Student Intern. this was great at first two weeks ago, but last Thursday I found out that someone in HR rejected the transaction. We still don't know if I'm going to get hired, but now it's shaky if I'm going to get to stay there at all. I also found out if I stay on as an Intern, I won't be allowed to work more than 19 hours/week due to a new policy. I feel like I should look for a new job; I feel like I'm going to get laid off--against both my manager, my operations manager, and my director's wishes... at least these people are working really hard, especially my manager, who is a wonderful human being and is working especially hard to get me to stay some how. I'm still scared though.

one good thing happened though. leah is moved into her apartment now. now we have our own space again. yay. i don't want to write any more. this entry is already long enough. best to all..."

"event","so my mom called me a little while ago. the grand father of a friend of ours wants to take reagan. i told her ok, but only if they never give him to a pound. if they give him to a pound, i'll take him back. she said not to worry, they don't want to do that. this grandpa loves dogs, and gil, our friend, does too. i can also visit reagan whenever since he'll just be over in cambrdige, and i'll be in somerville.

i know some of you think this is irresponsible, ,but situation considered, i don't think it is. my mom doesn't have the time or the patience for reagan--she's not home; she's at work all week. i legally can't take him since the house i'm moving into doesn't allow dogs. the landlord might give eventually, but for the time being, i can only assume no dogs. 

I do want to meet the landlord and talk to her about this, but until then this is all i can assume.

the whole idea of our family getting a second dog was for peety to have company, but unfortunately that just didn't work. reagan was too big for peety, and they have dominance issues, but the worst problem is how much reagan likes to play and how lazy peety is. they argue about it. so assuming that for the time being i came up with another idea... ugh...

but before i get to that, i just had to deal with a frustrating phone call. Next Gen Realty is not a good company. Deposits for housing are legally defined as refundable until the lease is established. applications are signed for one purpose only: to apply for an apartment. not to sign a lease. they are separate agreements. apparently one real estate agent in particular, Jordan Conover, was exceptionally poor in service. he was not helpful or good at keeping us informed. he was flaky at best. for some reason he's no longer with the next gen office in allston. I actually just hung up on him. he kept blabbing on about the applications we signed. they are not legally binding. the lease is. anyway, i told him ""it's your fault the apartment was off the market for two months. that is not our reponsibility, it is yours. and since we have not signed a lease, or lived in it, the deposit does not go toward rent payment. i expect a refund check. thank you."" and i just hung up. i really don't want to turn it into a legal issue.

i need a beer... sapporo.

anyway, while i was in the shower, i remembered an awesome idea Leah had a while back about pets. Ferrets. They're not dogs. They're not cats, but they're not dogs. So I might get one of those. We'll see...

right now I just want my deposit back."

there's an apartment which is nice too that does allow dogs, but it doesn't have a back yard or free laundry (albeit laundry is onsite)

reagan is a bit of a pain. he's frustrating and annoying. sometimes i wish i could take peety instead. he's mellower than any pet i've known, but i don't know if i could work that out with my mom. maybe if i bought her a new dog instead.

peety pretty much is a cat that listens to you. he's so house trained, he doesn't make a mess. he's just a nice dog. doesn't even chew. he has no teeth! (well some, but not many) he likes to lick his toys if anything.

We also saw Upside of Anger with Megan and her boyfriend Jay. It was a cute chick flick, had its moments, twists, and I really liked Kevin Costner in it.

ok now back to work... i think."

"event","first of all, Leah, thanks so much for having me over. Second, holy crap was that food good. Though the gefilte (did I spell that right?) fish wasn't 100% Joan Schaffer (Leah's mom) authentic, it was still really good. I didn't expect it to be a sweet food, but mmmmm. I also got to read a paragraph from the uh ""instruction manual""... haggadah, right? Leah and I both got really sleepy and relaxed off the Manischewitz. I guess we were loaded, but not in the crazy way. More like the ""we can't sit up straight"" way. Last night we watched ""The Forgotten"", which was pretty interesting/freaky, but not in a scary movie way. I was planning on coming home Sundee, but I've got a really sweet girl who won't send me home driving in the night (especially when it could've been raining like it was on the way there--eesh.)

I've finished Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and now I'm reading about the Restaurant at the End of the Universe. Which, I suspected might not have something to do with a spatial edge, but the other kind :)

I also got into a CRAZY physics conversation with Leah's dad and brother, and some family friends of theirs.

Oh yeah, and we installed tiger."

"event","i've never had a canker sore that hurt this much before. there's actually four of them, but two are right along the ridge of my gumline behind my left lower molar and must be near or touching a nerve or two. i couldn't even speak just now. i had to put anesthetic in my mouth (god bless hurricaine (20% benzocaine) ). it stung when my pinky finger touched the canker, but i had to leave it there, rub it around, press, and it hurt so much i had to hold myself. i've bruised bones, had contusions, sinus headaches, migraines, twists, gas, but this was different. it burned inside along a nerve, and i felt it run up my jawline and to the back of my ear. after a few seconds it changed, and now it's gone. thanks to some hurricaine. and now it's back to work. 

i know. the cankers are from stress. it should all be over soon.

gotta get back into my geek groove.

"event","So I've been writing code for almost the entire afternoon/evening, except for a really nice break I got from watching the fireworks at Brandeis. The only weird part about it was the music that was playing. What was with the sap-rock? And Jazz Oh Christmas Tree? (Tannenbaum). 

This project is getting interesting, and this is my mental break before I tackle what I think is the trickiest part of my project. I feel like I should meditate first.

Thursday is the Shins concert, but there's plenty to do before it. It will be a good reward."

Whatever, I had paper work to do while I was there! 

Lost is on tonight, and I'm grabbing dinner with my aunt because she thinks I'm gonna go insane by myself this week. My dogs would make me nuts, but hey, today they were so good! They played together, including some tricks on me that are a little hard to explain, but it involved doors and water. I'm not sure if they did it on purpose..."

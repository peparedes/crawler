"event","...Wanted to jot this down before I forget as it truly warmed my heart.. 

I'm not a big lottery player, but occassionally buy one of those scratch & win tickets.  My 7yr old daughter asked if she could scratch one of the boxes, so I agreed to let her scratcth the ""extra chance"" one at the bottom.  Having scratched the main playing area and winning nothing at all (of course) I passed the ticket to my daughter, her face was a picture of intense concentration while she carefully used a penny to scratch the ticket.  ""Mommy, Mommy!  she cried, her face lit up with pure excitement, ""we won, we won!!""  She gave the ticket back to me and proudly pointed at the box she had scratched...""see there Mom, we won...Good Luck!""   

She was so happy about that for the rest of the day and looking at her and sharing in her innocent joy made me think that maybe we did win something after all..........

"event","Well, I iz proud of myself today...having been inspired by <lj user =Shoebox2> I have decided to try and use this journal again.  Have also changed the name of my Journal to Solo to match the name I use on other forums...seems to make sense, although my user name stays the same...can't figure out how you can change that?

So life is pretty good, although I have the January blahs today...must be cause it was a school snow day and my darling child is driving me insane watching ""Bratz Rock Angels""   I do NOT recommend it!"

"event","Well, I am a happy camper today....Got to watch the new Doctor Who last night & I just loved it!  Grew up on that show, it would be the highlight of our TV watching week when I was young, I even just about remember the orginal Doctor.     Anyway, I thought the new show was well done, the special effects were better, but it still managed to keep the sort of folksy simplicity of the older ones.   I will be making that a regular Tuesday night ritual."

"event","Had the not so pleasant experience of visiting a new, very large shopping Mall this weekend for the first time.  Needless to say I witnessed consumerism at it's peak.  The amount of stores and the number of people there made me want to shake my head, have we all gone nuts?  How much ""stuff"" do we need?  

What did I buy you ask?  A basting brush, a pair of kitchen tongs and some hair gel....yes, you can tell I am not a professional shopper.

I will not return there in a hurry..give me small town stores where people actually smile at you & make conversation..."

"event","Well, so much for my vow to myself that I would write in my journal at least once a week! Not exactly a stellar start...oh well better late than never again.

It was my young daughters birthday on the weekend, took her & two little friends 5 pin bowling, thought I would hate it, but it was actually a riot!  The kids were so funny with the throwing techniques, feet apart, backside sticking way out as they rocked back & forth before letting the ball go.  
A good time was had by all.

Sunday..after church service there was a choir practice for the kids, they are going to ring bells during the Palm Sunday service...this needs lots of work, amusing to watch as the kids are almost shaking with the anticipation of their turn to ring, but hard on the ears, they are not exactly keeping the rhythm at this point and you would be hard pushed to know which song they are doing...yes Madam, that was actually ""Go tell it on the Mountain"" yes, I know it sounded more like a cat having it's tail tied into a slip knot..but they are working on it""  They have a couple more weeks to practice so I am sure it will improve and everyone will smile at them anyway regardless of how they sound.

All in all a pleasant weekend."

"event","Welcome to my journal..At this point I have no idea what these pages will contain, it taken me long enough just to get to this stage!  

Well, let's get started...today is a normal, boring workday..but I have been playing some really old music to pass the time, nothing quite like a little Roy Orbison to sing along to sometimes, especially when you are alone & it doesn't matter that you can't sing..but I do think I offend the dog at times, she gives me the raised eyebrows, pained expression and suffles of to find a comfy resting spot out of earshot.

My dog may become a main character in my journal as we spend most of the working days alone together, so I should introduce her.  ""Sydney"" is a 9 year old golden lab/retreiver mix, she has bad hips and has mastered the art of making humans feel sorry for her, with her soft coat and her soulful, bottomless brown eyes, she is a canine that is hard to resist.  Except of course when she wants out at 5am in the morning and it's -20 outside...then it's easy.

Must attend to the day's work at this point, will return soon."

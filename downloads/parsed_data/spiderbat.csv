"event","So, this last week or so has been... big.  A combination of good and bad (mostly bad) that has left me severely drained and basically not reacting to things like I should.  Of course, I don't notice these things until after the fact, so I can't correct them until much later, if at all.

Let's run down the major players in this drama I call ""news"".  In no specific order:

- Megan and I are moving in together, and thus need to do apartment searching.  Due to things further down this list, that hasn't worked out.  Luckily for me, Megan is super understanding and knows what she's doing.  I'm just afraid that she's taking on too much at once, with her job being a jerk (to her, not her job to be one) and dealing with my crap, and the apartment hunting.

- Work.  Well, work is a mixed bag.  The oldest requisition in my area is *crosses fingers* closing on Monday, so that's good.  However, I get 0 feedback from the recruiters, so I don't know what they're looking for, what they liked or didn't like about a candidate, and that's even assuming they bother to A) call the candidate at the scheduled time and B) update the file after talking to them.

- The Aquabats are playing tomorrow (or, rather, later today), so that should be fun.  Should be fun.  It's turned into a fucking job for me to organize people because I thought I 'd be nice and pick up their tickets early, to make sure they get in.  Basically, the doors open at 6 PM, and I plan on being there well beforehand.  Brett, DeJ, Jimmy, and Tracy haven't gotten their tickets from me yet and I found out today that Brett and DeJ won't be getting there until 7 or later.  So, now I need to leave the show to go outside and fucking meet up with them to hand them tickets that Brett was perfectly capable of taking from me last Thursday.  *sigh*  Same as it ever was.

- Sean (and Vanna) are driving me nuts.  Neither of them seems to understand that dishes left in the sink for a week or so will potentially grow mold, especially when they're covered in food (sticky food at that).  The dish washer I loaded last week was still filled when Sean went to leave for work tonight, so, per usual, I had to do it.  I discovered avocado rinds and tea bags in the sink, partially clogging the drain.  Not to mention the gross film of slimy food left in the sink.  Fuck me if I'm cleaning their sink mess, the dishes were enough.  Sean can clean it tomorrow before he plays another 6 hours of Final Fantasy of Mega Man.

- Danielle's dad died earlier this week, and though I never met him, it's still big.  I haven't had a chance to talk to her yet (we'll see her this weekend), but I can guess how that feels.

- My dad had his surgery last Friday and everything seems to have gone fine, they got the cancer before it got serious (I'll hear the follow up test results this weekend).

- Which leads into the bad (I mean, not that the stuff before wasn't annoying, but it's not this): My mom has been fighting cancer for a few years now and I just found out that it's stage 4 and they gave her 6 months to a year to live.  

That's right, a year on the outside.

I'm not sure how to react to this, as we always knew it was a possibility, but to be told...  I don't know.  I cried a bit when I heard, and I'm getting teared up now just thinking about it.  I haven't told anyone but Megan (and, I guess, whoever reads this), though I'll be breaking the news to others this weekend.  I wanted to have time to let it sink in (thinking it might get easier for me to tell them) and to avoid it detracting from The Aquabats for them.  I don't know if this was the best decision, but it's the one I made.

It's late, and I need to sleep some so I can try to function tomorrow.  I'm sure Sean will be home in an hour to drunkenly wake me up, but let's see if I can try to sleep through it.

EDIT: Well, Sean, Vanna, and Zach (Vanna's brother) are all here, and Sean has no inside voice.  Again."

"event","I know some of you frequent MySpace as well as well as LiveJournal, so you may have been seeing this as well.  Basically, it's a lame ass bulletin that 15-18 year olds post/repost proclaiming their status as a ""90's kid"".  So I went through and tried to figure out what they claim as ""90's"" stuff actually IS from the 90's and what's not.  The original post is <B>bolded</B>, my answers are regular font.



<B>You've ever ended a sentence with the word ""SIKE!""</B>
It would be spelled ""Psych"".
 
<B>You remember when Kurt Cobain, Tu Pac, River Phoenix, and Selena died.</B>
If you can actually claim to have listened to Nirvana before Cobain killed himself you were probably born in the early to mid 80's, NOT the 90's.  Tupac died on September 13, 1996.  River Phoenix, October 31, 1993.  And Selena died March 31, 1995
 
<B>You remember when it was actually worth getting up early
on a Saturday to watch cartoons.</B>
Um... where to start?  Saturday morning cartoons started on the downward spiral in the late 80's.  I'm sure there are people out there that would argue that the cartoons these days are better than anything before.  I would disagree with them, but I'm sure they exist.

I'd like some ""90's Kid"" to tell me what is considered a 90's cartoon worth getting up for.  I guess X-Men, Batman, Spider-Man, and Freakazoid.  Most people think of Transformers, He-Man, Thundercats, and such, all of which were 80's cartoons.

<B>You got super excited when it was Oregon Trail day in computer class at school.</B>
I hate to break it to you, but Oregon Trail was created in 1971.  It became popular in schools during the mid 80's and early 90's.  If you were old enough to be using a computer then, you were likely born before 1990.

<B>You know the profound meaning of ""Wax on, wax off""</B>
The ""Karate Kid"" came out in 1984.

<B>You have pondered why Smurfette was the only female smurf.</B>
As much as I hate to quote Donnie Darko:

<B>Ronald Fisher: </B>We gotta find ourselves a Smurfette. 
<B>Sean Smith:  </B>Smurfette? 
<B>Ronald Fisher: </B>Yeah, not some tight-ass Middlesex chick, right? Like this cute little blonde that will get down and dirty with the guys. Like Smurfette does. 
<B>Donnie: </B>Smurfette doesn't fuck. 
<B>Ronald Fisher: </B>That's bullshit. Smurfette fucks all the other Smurfs. Why do you think Papa Smurf made her? Because all the other Smurfs were getting too horny. 
<B>Sean Smith:  </B>No, no, no, not Vanity. I heard he was a homosexual. 
<B>Ronald Fisher: </B>Okay, then, you know what? She fucks them and Vanity watches. Okay? 
<B>Sean Smith:  </B>What about Papa Smurf? I mean, he must get in on all the action. 
<B>Ronald Fisher: </B>Yeah, what he does, he films the gang-bang, and he beats off to the tape. 
<B>Donnie: </B>[shouts] First of all, Papa Smurf didn't create Smurfette. Gargamel did. She was sent in as Gargamel's evil spy with the intention of destroying the Smurf village. But the overwhelming goodness of the Smurf way of life transformed her. And as for the whole gang-bang scenario, it just couldn't happen. Smurfs are asexual. They don't even have... reproductive organs under those little, white pants. It's just so illogical, you know, about being a Smurf. You know, what's the point of living... if you don't have a dick? 
<B>Sean Smith:  </B>[pause] Dammit, Donnie. Why you gotta get all smart on us?

There's your answer as to why she's the only female Smurf in the original series.  However, seeing as the Smurfs first appeared in 1976, and were first seen on American TV in 1981, they were an 80's phenomenon.

<B>You took plastic cartoon lunch boxes to school.</B>
I refer you to Wikipedia:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunch_box

(SUMMARY: Mickey Mouse was appearing on steel lunch kits as early as 1935, and 1959 introduced the vinyl lunch kit.)

<B>you danced to ""wannabe"" by the Spice Girls, Females: had a new motto, Males: got a whole lot gay-er. (so tell me what you want, what you really really want.)</B>
I'll give you this.  Why anyone would want to claim it as part of their childhood is beyond me.

<B>You remember the craze then the banning of slap bracelets and slam books.</B>
I bet there are people in their 40's that remember that.  If you mean you were a school kid then...  God, I LOVE Wikipedia.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slap_bracelets

<B>You still get the urge to say ""NOT"" after (almost) every sentence...Not...</B>
Did people actually say NOT?  I guess the youth of America was already on a decline.

<B>Where in the world is Carmen San Diego? was both a game and a TV game show.</B>
Created in 1985.  So you got the TV show after it became a popular video game.  How many people remember the theme song from the game show?

<B>Captain Planet.</B>
Ran from 1990 to 1996, Hence you would have to have been born in 1992 (at the latest) to be able to actually be able to watch this and remember.

<B>You knew that Kimberly, the pink ranger, and Tommy, the red* Ranger were meant to be together.

To the last sentence you said.....hey...Tommy was the green* ranger!!!!..>..> 


*later to be white


When playing power rangers with friends you fought over who got to be who............and still all ended up being tommy.</B>
I'll give you Power Rangers as well, as no one wants to claim them.  They put super hero movies back a few years with their terrible movie.

<B>You remember when super nintendo's became popular.</B>
August 13, 1991: SNES becomes available in the US.

<B>You remember watching home alone 1, 2 , and 3........and tried to pull the pranks on ""intruders""</B>
Home Alone: 1990.
Home Alone 2: 1992
Home Alone 3:1997

<B>""I've fallen and I can't get up""</B>
Early 90's.  So I guess you win this round. 

<B>You remember going to the skating rink before there were inline skates</B>
Inline skates came BEFORE quad-skates.  However, the ease of use made quad skates (or roller skates) more popular.  Inline skates were highly popular in the late 1980s and the early 90s.
 
<B>Two words... Trapper Keeper.</B>
Trapper Keepers were popular during the 80s AND 90s. 

<B>You ever got injured on a Slip 'n' Slide</B>
I had the original Slip and Slide way back when I was a kid.  I must have been 10 or so, making it around 1991.  Assuming kids as young as 4 played with them, I'll assume you were born in or after 1987.  However, just having been injured on one doesnt make you a 90's kid, as I'm sure there were plenty of drunk college kids using them in the early 90's.

<B>You wore socks over leggings scrunched down</B>
I have no idea when this was popular.  

<B>""Miss Mary Mack, Mack, Mack, all dressed in black, black, black, with silver buttons, buttons, buttons, all down her back, back, back"" SHE ASKED HER MOTHER MOTHER MOTHER FOR FIFTY CENTS CENTS CENTS TO SEE THE ELEPHANTS PHANTS PHANTS JUMP OVER THE FENCE THE FENCE THE FENCE
he jumped so high high high he touched the sky sky sky and he didnt come back back back til the forth of july ly ly he jumped so low ow ow he stubbed his toe toe toe and thats the end end end of the elephants show show show</B>

This has been around in some fashion at least since the Civil War.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Mary_Mack

<B>You remember boom boxes vs. cd players<B>
Boom boxes arent things that simply play tapes, they can have CD players built in.  I'll assume you refer to tapes vs CDs.  

CD players have been around since the early 80's.
 
<B>You remember New Kids on The Block when they were cool</B>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_kids_on_the_block
""New Kids On The Block was a successful boy band of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Assembled in Boston in 1994 ...""

<B>You knew all the characters names and their life stories on ""Saved By The Bell""</B>
""Saved by the Bell"" ran from 1989 to 1993.  I assume you refer to the reruns.

<B>You played and or collected ""Pogs""</B>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogs
An early-to-mid-90's phenomenom, pogs were originally from Hawaii.

<B>You had at least one Tamagotchi, GigaPet or Nano and brought it everywhere</B>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigapets
The original Tamagotchi was released in 1997 in both Japan and America. 
OK, Ill give you this too.

<B>You watched the original Care Bears, My Little Pony, and Ninja Turtles</B>
Care Bears: 1985
My Little Pony: 1986
TMNT: 1987
Man, you guys must have lived off 80's reruns, huh? 
BONUS: What were the TMNT a spoof off?  And what other characters origin is tied to theirs? (HINT: Ben Affleck played him in a shitty 2003 movie.)

<B>NANCY DREW AND THE HARDY BOYS WERE THE BEST MYSTERY BOOKS<B>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Drew
Nancy Drew has been around since the 30's.  She became highly popular in the early 80's.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardy_Boys
The brothers Hardy have been around longer than their friend Nancy.  The series ended in 2005, but there are spin-offs.

<B>Yikes pencils and erasers were the stuff!</B>
I dont think I ever had Yikes! stuff, as I don't know what it is.  However, Google searches lead me to believe it was a thing for ""80's kids"", and possibly their younger siblings.

<B>All your school supplies were ""Lisa Frank"" brand.(pencils.notebooks.binders.etc..>..> .)</B>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Frank
Founded her company in 1979, success soon followed (mainly from sticker sales).

<B>You remember when the new Beanie Babies were always sold out.</B>
I'll give you this as well, as 1996 was when the craze hit. 

<B>You used to wear those stick on earings, not only on your ears, but at the corners of your eyes.</B>
I dont remember this, so I'll assume it was after my childhood. 

<B>You remember a time before the WB.</B>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_WB 
January 11, 1995.  So you must have been 10 or so, thus influenced mainly by waning 80's TV, etc.

<B>You've gotten creeped out by ""Are You Afraid of the Dark?""</B>
Ran from 92 to 96.  I guess you might have been 5 or so when it was on, but why would your parents have let you watch it then? 

<B>You know the Macarena by heart.</B>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macarena_(song)
Originally released in 1993...  it became a worldwide summer hit in 1996.
Feel free to take this too.

<B>""Talk to the hand"" ... enough said</B>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk_to_the_hand
Is associated with the 1990's.  However, it was popularized by the show Martin, not a show anyone, let alone children, should have been watching in 1992.

<B>You thought Brain woud finally take over the world</B>
Animaniacs first aired in 1993, and Pinky & the Brain in 1995.  I'll give this to you as well, mainly because you'd have to have been a kid to think he'd ever succeed (aside from the time travel episode of Freakazoid).

<B>You always said, ""Then why don't you marry it!""</B>
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081915/
Ah, Pee Wees Playhouse...  Sorry, 1981 my friends. 

<B>You remember when everyone went slinky crazy.</B>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slinky#Popular_culture 
A 1995 movie reference (Ace Ventura: Pet Detective) does not for good evidence make.  A 1989 movie reference (Ghostbusters II) does help slightly.  Together they indicate that the Slinky was popular between 1989 and 1995; or when 90's kids were around 6 or 7 (at best).

<B>You remember when razor scooters were cool.</B>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razor_(Scooter)
In 2000?  I guess the 90's continues after the 90's were done, huh?

 
<B>when we were younger:</B>

<B>Before the MySpace frenzy.</B>
MySpace has been around how long?  A few years at best.  

<B>Before the Internet & text messaging.</B>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet 
Before 1983?
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging
Before 1985?

I'll assume you mean ""Before the internet & text messaging became common in the US.""

<B>Before Sidekicks & iPods.</B>
See last entry on assuming dates, etc.  I'll give you this one.

<B>Before MIKE JONES</B>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Jones
He's older than me by 4 months!  If you're referring to his CD, then it was 2005!  Geez, you might was well say, ""You're a 90's kid if you were on MySpace before John posted this.""

<B>Before PlayStation2 or X-BOX.</B>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_2
PS2: 1999.  See MIKE Jones.
XBox: 2001.  Same
 
<B>WHEN LIGHT UP SNEAKERS WERE KOOL</B>

"event","What is needed in a cruel and terrifying reality isn't heroic virtue - how often do we get the chance?  What's needed is heroic courtesy.  A personal response to the world we bitch in and cut people off in.  The world we create.  I don't believe it just happens by itself.  It's our responsibility.  It's up to us.  And I belive with all my heart that the bottom line ought to be something smaller than kindness even.  Courtesy.  Courtesy lubricates and sustains our society, leavens the world from inside out...

And yet what do we value?  Movie stars who kick ass.  Quick comebacks and prime-time sarcasm.  The brave soldier who takes out five enemies with a grenade and rescues his buddy on the battlefield.  Sports heroes who can leap higher than anyone - dunk, and smack and hit and kick and bodycheck.  We admire violence.  I think it says a lot about how powerless we feel: how much we revere muscles and fitness.

But violence, despite what we see on the news, is exceptional.  It wouldn't be news if it wasn't.  It seems to me that most of life is little moments, tiny thoughtless habitual virtues that make it bearable, that make civilization possible - not extraordinary acts that make headlines.  Most people are good.  If they weren't it'd just be chaos.

Just today, I was feeling particularly glum for the usual reasons and this total stranger approached me at the pharmacy and said, ""You dropped this.""  She was a teenager with that Goth thing, nose ring, black fingernails and lipstick - I guess they have to find something to shock their parents - and if you didn't look beyond the frightening aspect of her makeup you'd never see the sweet, well-mannered child there.  She casually handed me the box of Band-Aids that I had dropped.  She didn't even smile when I thanked her; just nodded and went on her way.  Well, see, to me, that's special.  She didn't have to do that.  Fifteen seconds to make a stranger's life just a little easier.  Who taught her that?  Not the newspapers.

"event","I saw it last night with a good sized group (12 all together). We ranged from Comic Fans (Seidler and myself) to people who didn't know much aside from the movies & the cartoon (my mother & sister). 

The consensus was this: Not as good as X2. Too many characters stuck in so as to try to appeal to comic fans (which backfired, as we were annoyed), and bad dialogue. Yes, I know it's a summer movie, but really. I thought we had gotten the X-Men to progress past some things. 

Good Things: 
- The Fastball special: Unfortunately it came rather early in the movie.  
-Storm is actually a likeable character, kinda.  She's fleshed out more anyway, and you see her more as a leader.  Iceman actually ices up like in the comics.
- Beast and Juggernaut actually say lines geeks wanted to hear, and at the appropriate times. 
- Iceman vs. Pyro. I'm not going to say anything because it would spoil the fight, but I liked the bit at the end of the fight. It's about dang time. 


Bad Things: 
- Trying to get as many characters into the movie as possible. Angel, Callisto, Psylocke, etc. I won't every character that shows up, but some of them are cool to see, others annoying. And most of them are there simply to put on a poster or to show up and do something in one friggin' scene. Angel is a very minor character, but whatever.  At least they didn't try to flesh out Colossus very much.  Oh, wait... I like him.  
- Psylocke and Callisto.  I didn't hear them referred to as either charcter, which I guess should a be under ""Good Points"", as neither displayed powers like the comic characters.  
As to why we needed ""Callisto"" (who seems to have Caliban type powers, plus Quicksilver  )... I have no idea. I guess because she's the leader of the Morlocks (not mentined or hinted at in the movie). Whatever. 
- Beast and Juggernaut may say lines geeks wanted to hear, but one of the lines is a stupid (i.e. unnecessary) reference to a certain internet phenomenon. Let's just say Kiel will get a good laugh out of it, bitch!  
- Van Helsing syndrome. There's enough story for 3 movies! Cutting out one or two of the story arcs wouldn't have kept the movie from doing well, I think it would have made for a better movie. As X2 ended with the Phoenix seen in the lake, that's what they should have stuck with. I don't think we needed the other ""large"" story tossed in. There's refernces to several comic arcs, but they don't add to the story, merely confuse/mislead. 


Basically, go see it this weekend.  As a geek, you'll regret not going opening weekend. However, unlike X2, I don't think I'll be going to see it in theaters again.
 
NOTE:  Stay and watch the bit after the credits."

"event","Today marks the firts strike in ""Operation: Fuck Danny Up His Cheesey Asshole"".  

For those of you not in the know, Danny is a newer Hero Clix player, and he's pretty good.  He beats Seidler fairly regularly to win the prize.  However, he usually does so when every other player brings a theme team.  He'll bring wild card abuse and totally cheese it up.

A theme team is one that (generally) consists of members who work together, etc.  So a team of all X-Men can be a theme AND still win.  However, the Invisible Woman doesn't work with Batman and KC Hawkman.  They're different universes, and there's never been a crossover like that.  And when you throw medics and Con Artists in...  Theme is out the door.  You want a winning theme?  Try Batman & Superman.  Avengers.  JLA.  X-Men.  There are tons.  You don't need to play the same few rotating figures every friggin' week.

Sick of facing cheese every week, Seilder decided we're going to teach Danny a lesson.  Greg, Seidler, and myself came up with a pretty kick ass team for the game tonight, and we're all going to run it.  It's 400 points of ass-kickery that will roll over Danny; all he has to do is lose one game and he can't win a prize.  He won't be getting 1st place, and he's sure as hell not getting Fellowship.  

We figure a few weeks of getting handed losses by really cheesey teams will give him a new perspective on Hero Clix and theme games (which are supposed to be FUN).

Yeah, we're a bunch of assholes."

"event","New Years started early for me, as DeJernet's birthday was the 30th.  After a long night of drinking [and waking up next to a dumbell (not a person, the actual object)] I awoke at 2 PM.  Seidler was up and watching Arrested Development (one of the most under appreciated shows ever).  Brett crawled out of bed shortly after only to discover someone had keyed his car.  Not cool.

By 4:30 everyone had gotten up and we all wanted food.  However, the idea of Burger King was overridden because DeJ wanted breakfast.  And to be able to sit and smoke.  And drink coffee.  Any guesses as to where she wanted to go?  If you guessed IHOP, you're right.  As we were in South Elgin, the nearest IHOP was in the opposite direction from home.  Hence I didn't get home until 7:30-ish.  And I had to get ready for Larry's ""Nerd Year's Eve"" party.

Kiel went and got Matt, then swung by to pick me up.  I go out to his truck only to discover that both of them are dressed up [Matt in a suit, and Kiel with a ""dress"" shirt over his t-shirt (which is as dressed up as Kiel gets)].  So I went back in to change into something other than a pair of jeans.

After some driving to get booze and food we got lost ont he way to Larry's.  Which was no fault of ours, as Larry told us to turn onto 1st.  First.  As in the number before 2.  It was 31st.  Thirty First!  Yeah...

But we got there, and it was rather quiet.  A fun night, but in the words of other Matt, ""sausage fest"". (People actually talk like that sometimes).  Matt Russell got pretty trashed over the course of the night, but not until he'd made out with Ivona.  I should mention that the whole ride there Matt had been saying, ""Anyone who passes out with his shoes on is fair game to be written on.  That's the rule"".  That dumbass set himself up for it.  

Matt passed out.  On the living room couch.  With his shoes on.  After making an ass of himself.  Now, normally I'd put a stop to such high school level hi-jinx, but Matt had asked for this.  So I instigated the writing.  Matt had the Venom web shooters (you're a nerd if you know what I'm talking about) on his hands, ""Douche McCougar"" on his face, the prerequisite penis pointed to his mouth, ""Drunky McGee"" on his forehead, ""I rape children for $"" on his other arm, and much more.  We ran out of space, so I drew eyes on his eye lids.  The best part: The 1st thing I wrote.  ""You forgot to take your shoes off stupid!"".  Matt took it in stride, as he admitted he deserved it.  He was still drunk when he said this, so we'll see if he's pissed later.

Mark had apparently been in a fight (which is no surprise).  If you don't know Mark you'll need some set up.  Mark is about 5'4, and 270 pounds.  And he can kick almost anyone's ass.  Larry refers to him as ""Badger"", much like Logan is called ""Wolverine"".  Give Mark an adamantium skeleton, a healing factor, and a Canadian accent and he'd BE Wolverine.  

Anyway, Mark was at some party when a frat guy decided he was going to show off to his friends/girl by starting shit with Mark.  Mark tried to get the guy to stop, but after 2 punches Mark had had enough.  The guy went down like a sack of shit.  Then idiot number two tried to help his fallen friend.  By hitting Mark over the head with an empty beer bottle.  This is where most of Mark's injuries came from.  That and cutting his knuckles on their teeth.  Mark upper cuts the 2nd guy to the floor, then gets set upon by idiot number three.  After knocking HIM down, Mark has to deal with idiot number four.  Yeah, four guys.  And they ended up with at least one broken face bone (whatever the bone under the nose, above the lip is called).  Mark had scrathes from the bottle and their nails (they actually tried scratching him).  And busted knuckled from driving their teeth further into their gums.  The cops were bought off for a mere $165 (or so I'm told).

Mark cleaned himself up when he got home, then Larry and someone picked him up, which is where  his night intersected with ours.  This was definitely a case of, ""you should see the other guy"", only with 4 of the idiots having to go to the hospital.

Kiel and I got Matt up and into the car, then headed home. I think I slept from 8 AM to 4 PM.  And I thought it was Monday when I woke up.  I got all ready for Hero Clix. only to have Larry point out that it was still Sunday.  Yeah, I'm a dunce.

I hope everyone else had a good New Year's."

And it's irritating because I know I could have won, but there were about 25 people crowded around the table and it was really distracting.  I would have told them to back of, but I wasn't consciously aware of them until after the game.  Next time I'm clearing lots of room.

Also, IBC is on sale at Dominick's at the wonderful price of four 6 packs for $10.  That works out to... let's see... carry the one... pi is still approximately 3.14159, right?  Ok, I think it's about $2.25 per pack.  And they also have various pizzas on sale.  And who doesn't like pizza?  Dirty Communists, that's who.

"event","Well Friday was my birthday.  I worked (got out late), then had dinner with Melinda.  We had a nice car ride, then she went home.  Brett swung by and we headed to Streets of Woodfield to see Sin City.  We were meeting Kiel, Myles, Matt, Seidler, and others up there when Kiel called me to tell me the 11 PM show was sold out.  I informed Seidler and we went to the 11:15 at AMC.  Sin City was really good, if a little long to watch from the 2nd row.

Saturday I slept until 2 or so, got up, and lounged about.  I helped Seidler unload the moving truck, we ate some pizza, then headed to ISU.  I love my brother, but 2 hours is a long drive to play pool.  There was nothing going on.  Tracy had lots of homework to do, Molly met us at a pool hall, and that was pretty much it.  Oh, Pat's girl friend Brittney and her friend Heather stopped by.  That was entertaining for the whole 15 minutes they were there.  Anyway, we drove back that night and I got home around 8 AM (after a short stop at Brandi's house warming party which was still kinda active at 6:30).

Sunday I got up around 2 again and Kiel, Adam, Seidler, and I went to a show/party in the city.  Despite having told Brett this was my plan some time during the week, and that I'da call him and DJ when I got back, they were mad I didn't get back until 8 or so.  Whatever.

I had an entertaining IM conversation, and got to bed/sleep around 1 or so.  Unfortunately I had to get up at 6 to work at 7.  BOO!  I worked until 4-ish and went to Wheaton for Hero Clix.  The stipulations were (due to my birthday), one ""spider"" related figure, one ""bat"" related figure, and one figure with the Aquatic speed ability.  (Spider-Bat and the Aquabats, kinda neat.)  Seidler ended up winning, which was fine because nobody really cared about the prizes becasue Wiz Kids is still sending Mutant Mayhem when Legacy is out already.

We headed over to Tracys apartment, and had Pat ring the bell saying he had a delivery for her.  She seemed surprised, so I guess it worked.

Anyway, we ate dinner at Ruby Tuesday, and the server made Tracy a tin foil tiara.  Oh, and Pat can apparently keep things in his mini afro...  We headed back to the apartment so Tracy could get changed, etc.  Brett went outside to make a call or something, came back in all flustered and said, ""um, John...  Where did I park my car?""  He got towed.  The car was there for less than 20 minutes, there was no sign, nothing.  So we had to hunt down his car, get it out, etc.  Pat and I sat around and watched Teen Titans, Chapelle's Show, and The Daily Show.  Good times.  

Brett, Tracy, and some other people headed to a bar, and I took my brother home.  I hung out with him for an hour or so, picked up the drunks, and went back to the apartment and got DRUNK.

I don't normally drink, so I'm a pushover.  Also, I drank 1/2 bottle of vodka (straight) in about 1/2 an hour.  I'm told I wasn't very annoying, just kinda loud at times.

"event","So Tiz (my sister) and I cleaned out Pat's (my brother) closet tonight.  It was quite entertaining, to say the least.  

Some of the ""treasures"" I found:
- A tube of unopened ""Slimer"" (Ghostbusters) toothpaste from 1986.  He was born in '85, so I don't know where the tube came from.  But it's mine now!
- An old briefcase of mine that I used to carry my books around in back in high school.  Contained within: An old Happy Meal toy of Aladdin, and an old toy necklace of my sister's, from when she was 5 (or so).  Then filled (and I mean FILLED) with...  Old Zip-lock bags.  From his lunches.  
- 3 cubic feet of old socks.  (SOME were clean.  Really.)
- An old Care Bears book, from 1983.
- A swimming trophy (he was on diving, not swimming) with no arms.  Oh, and the statue is a girl...
- Several pairs of shoes.
- A couple boxes of old action figures, used.
- A ""shirt"" made from duct-tape.
- A miniature stuffed jack-o-lantern.
- Books, odds and ends, etc.
- A few basketballs, baseballs, etc.
- A cloth pumpkin head/mask.
- A pair of my mom's slippers.
- 3 pairs of tights, unopened.
- 1 sports ""cup"" (from soccer).
- The ""Scramball"" from the game of the same name.
- Almost $1 worth of pennies.
- 2 of my old umbrella hats.
- 2 blankets/quilts, folded.  FOLDED!  I was amazed.
- A stuffed Kermit the Frog (from the Muppet Babies Christmas McDonald's toys).
- 2 of my old bathrobes.
- 10 pounds of old homework.
- A bag of clothes I had thought I sent to Am-Vets.
- An old Schaumburg Library photocopier card.
- A 1st grade project of his.
- A prototype board game I worked on at Ben & Jerry's.
- An ISU Health History form that was never filled in/sent.
- 13 hats/caps.
- MY high school graduation gown.
- His tux ""buttons"" (on the plastic holder) from prom.  I wonder if he can get his $20 back..?
- A stinky gym bag that I handed to Tiz, who then shrieked, and tossed it in the trash.  It also contained the last item on the list:
- 2 slices of crumpled, hardened Kraft cheese.  (Still in wrappers.)  Which I tossed at Tiz.  She repeated the episode with the bag.

There was more, but those are the more ""entertaining"" aspects.  My theory is that he leaves stuff like the briefcase full of bags laying around on purpose. So in 1000 years (or so) when archaeologists dig this crap up, they'll attribute it to him.  Any time, any dig, crap like that is found it'll be, ""Oh my, that 'Pat Craig' was here too...."""

"event","You know what's worse than being a fat guy?

Being a fat guy who hasn't eaten all day.  Worse than that?

Being a fat guy who made a pizza, at 2 slices, then knocked it onto the floor.  

So now said fat guy has basically wasted 25 mintues (or so) on making a pizza and cleaning it up.  All for 2 slices.

My life is a comedy of errors."

"event","Hero Clix tonight.  Here's the run down:  (And if this doesn't make sense to you, learn to play Hero Clix)

My ""Weapon X"" team 
V Logan 
Auto Regen 
Haymaker 
V Sabertooth (Ultimates) 
Auto Regen 
Haymaker 
E Deadpool 
Auto Regen 
Passenger 
V SHIELD Trooper 
V Paramedic 
pog Professor 

Round 1 (Seidler) 
He has: 
V Shi 
LE Tandy Bowen 
R Domino 
U Moondragon 
R Con Artist 
R Paramedic 
V Spider-Man (Ultimates) 
Pounce 

I play Earthquake, he plays his blank. He chooses the outdoor Avenger's Mansion, I stick him behind the fence. 

Earthquake isn't going off, and Logan falls prey to a Crit hit Pounce from Spidey, followed by some Psychic Blast from Tandy. My SHIELD Trooper gets a Crti Hit on Spidey, knocking him into Charge (with Haymaker) range of Sabertooth, who misses! 

I move Deadpool farther out, into Stealth. Guess what goes off?  If you guessed ""Earthquake"", you're right. It kills Spidey, the hooker, my pog, and cripples pretty much the rest of the board. I push Sabertooth to get next to Deadpool, wo pushes to Passenger the two of them out of LOS of Moondragon. Sabertooth rolls 1's repeatedly. Mike can't hit the braod side of a barn (or a Deadpool). Finally, the two surving Weapon x guys Regen enough to be dangerous, and kill the rest of the enemy. 

Round 2 (Larry) 
His team: 
LE Danny Ketch 
V Black Widow (Ultimates) 
E Booster Gold 
E HDC Trooper 
V Checkmate Medic 
E Havok 
LE Cameron Chase 

I choose the DC mall, and play my blank. Larry plays Warzone. 

All the knockback going on keeps me from staying next to anyone long enough to BCF them. Sabertooth pushed to charge Widow, only to miss by one. Booser Gold and the HDC hunt down Logan after Deadpool Pasengers him into the mall. I manage to KO Danny. 

Round 3 (Smitty) 
He runs: ""Space Brigade"" (or something) 
V Nebula 
Trick Shot 
V Starfire 
Trick Shot 
R Cosmic Boy 
E Moon Knight 
R Moloid (x2) as ""asteroids"" 

He chooses the constuction yard, and plays his blank. I play Darkness. 

I try to get out his LOS by moving around behind the ""dirt mound"" (we're playing ""across"" the map, white building to my right). I push Sabertooth with a Perplexed up Speed to Charge Satrfire, and miss. By one.  

Logan bases Nebula, but cosmic Boy just TK's ger to the other side of the formation and she Trick Shots him. The SHIELD Trooper and Professor try to base Nebula, but she's harder to hold onto thatn your sanity when sitting between Lari and Kiel.  

I think I KO a Moloid. Probably not though."

So this is the first entry in this form. Captain's Log: star date, March 10, 2005. It's 1:45 in the A. M.  Do you know where you spider-legged, demonic cow skull is?  I would hope so.  Those things can be a real pain to hunt down in the middle of the night.

"event","So this was originally in my MySpace dealie, but I think it works better backdated here.  (Tex is more likely to see this and kill me, right?)
------------------------------------------------------------------


You know you have no life when Alex is out and about and you're sitting in front of a computer...

So I'm resolving to be more active.  Not to say I'm not active, but I need to get out more.  Sitting at home and brooding is lame, and the realm of emo or goth kids.  Seeing as I'm not emo, nor goth, I better get a life.

(Idea stolen from Tex)

Things To Do:

1. Kill Tex.
2. Steal his women.
3. Get in shape (one other than ""round"").
4. Destroy Texas' good name.
5. Engage in mentally stimulating/creative endeaveurs more often (eg. reading and painting).
6. Eat healthier.
7. Be more sociable.
8. Makeout with cute, short-haired, punkrock girl at a park.
9. Save more money.
10. Be more available.
11. Catch up on astrophysics, time travel, etc.  (Yes, I'm lame.)
12. Listen to more/different/new music.  Broaden my horizons.
13. Sleep less.
14. Failure to comply with all of the above will result in seppuku.
15. Destroy Catholicism (optional).

Honestly i dont know lol. Why did i like him in the first place? Because his eyes, tallness, and hes just fricken cute. lol. But hes not my type i guess. Does he still have feelings for me? Not sure, but if he did nothing would happen. Yeah, i miss him a lil, but its all good.

A touch of His freedom - ""Where there is truth, there is freedom""
A touch of His wisdom - ""Trusting God is the wisest decision you can make""
A touch of His peace - ""No God, No Peace. Know God, Know Peace.""

Yeah i think its cool lol. WEll anyways to wrap it up, good night...good luck at school tomorrow...and HAPPY HOMECOMING!

"event","WOW...hmm starting with friday...long story short kyle came over..we took out a&w...sat in bairds creek and ate it..and then went to bay beach. IT WAS AWESOME! omg hehe we went on the ferris wheel and kyle was tweakin hehe...anywho so here comes saturday. Well kyle came over in the day..and then he left cuz i had to go to my gmas house to watch the packer game which KICKED ASS..but we left at half time cuz i was going bowling with kory and kyle...so we get to the bowling alley and were all like having fun..oh meanwhile b4 i went bowling i left my mom a note saying that i slept over at brads...YAY that was totally kick ass too...ok so after bowling we went over there...yeah..and didnt go to bed till like i cant remember lol..woke up...(meanwhile this is sunday) didnt eventually get up till 11 or 12 lol ok so me kyle brandon and justin well not sure about brandon but we all were watching The Mask and A Night At The Roxbury...and then me brad pete and kyle wsent to get wood out in abrams...got out of the car and picked some blackberries lol...got back to their house watched ace ventura pet detective...awesome movie..hmm...well got delivered a pizza...ate it..lol....and here i am now. Such and eventful weekend.

I realized that if you dont tell people the things you need to tell them right away...it comes back to bite you in the ass. Which is why i told kyle everything. Becuase it hurts him, and me for no ttelling him right away. I love this kid lol. MUAH!

Lesson for the day: Don't let life pass you by.

"event","Ok. Awesome day...have to go to church soon tho...ugh. I had this dream that Kyle was getting beat up in my garage, an then i walked out of my house and into my garage calling his name, I found him in the back right corner of it laying down, with a cut under his eye, meanwhile this chick that was a bitch in 8th grade was wailing on some other guy. Ok so I woke up from that dream scared that Kyle was hurt. Went back to sleep, dreamt i was in this castle thing, but it was like school, and it we were walking thru this tunnel and saw band kids,lol,then into this big room and everybody started hitting and beating each toher up but i ran out of the way and so did some other girls..I was tryingh to find Kyle again but this time his fingers were burnt and he was hurt really really bad. Ok i woke up and I got really scared about why I had those dreams about Kyle. I hope nothing ever happens to him. I love him so much!

Anyways...enough about dreams. I was thinking about the political/economical leaders of Green Bay. In the paper they have the 15 most ppl that contributed the most to Green Bay more or less. The first being Leo Frigo, and I call him the  cheese guy lol. The 2nd being Curly Lambeau, the last being Morgan L. Martin. I was proud because that was my elementary school.So then I thought would i want to go into politics? Havent decided.

I realized that I have to let go of certain things, and move on with my life. I appreciate the things God has given me and have no regrets on anything that has happened.

To end this journal entry, I want to ask what are you all doing with your lives? Do you have a goal? ANd dont throw away your life on simple things. DOnt let ppl get you down, stand up for what you believe and dont let anyone get in your way. You are your own person so have fun everyone. Oh, and live life as if you were going to die tomorrow, be grateful for what you have, and appreciate everything around you.

Have an awesome night y'all, and a great day tomorrow!

I love you Kyle! MUAH!

And like after the concert I GOT TO MEET SALIVA whoa cuz i bought a t-shirt and like they stamp your hand and you get a pass to meet them and have them sign your shit. SOO they signed my t-shirt and my ticket. The first guy called me babe lol. Okie. So after the concert me and kyle walked to McDonalds and i was starving so i wanted a BigMac but they were closed lol. Fuck That. And then i got home went to bed, woke up, and here I am now. Today we have to work on our rummage sale again. Its Aug. 6&7 if you wanna buy anything lol. Well cant think of anything more to say in my entry but have a nice day and i'll prolly post something later.

  In the last 4 months heather has been more of a friend to me then some people I have know for years, she has cryed with me for the loss of my mother when she didnt even know her, she as loaned me money when I was trying to move out and support myself, she has been there for me emountionly, meantaly, financley and every other way she is more then my firned she is my sister. Im saying this because everyone seems to think that I have choosen heather over them. Well kyla you where right I am a diffrent person and I have diffrent taste in who I choose to keep around me for companionship, 
 Im sorry if anyone got hurt by what I did and did not say to robert but you know what that is between robert and myself, and what happend with heather and robert is between them and them alone its not our place to pry into there love life...Im so sick of these high school games that i dont want to be around the people I knew in high school because all they want to do is gossip and make me choose sides on whos right and whos wrong, well you know what Im done. Kyla if you want to throw our friendship( or what was left of it) away then just say the word and its done but lay the fuck off heather this is between you and I and she keeps getting the blunt end of your rath everytime something happens in the group. 
 I dont know what people wamt from me anymore and Im tierd of caring so fuck off dont fuck off I dont care just let me rest in peace form all this drama"

 We have been out of high school for 6 months now and yet we ALL are still playing these high school games. We talk bad about each other on-line because we don't have the balls to face each other. 
 Kyla I have known you for 9 years and we have had our ups and our downs but we have stayed strong and I love you for that. But you have to let this whole thing with Heather go, I'm not going to ask you to do it for me because thats just low even for myself, I almost feel sick with my self for letting this go as far as it did. I know that you said that after the party you will calm down and be civil, so I hope you will be a women of your word and take the initiative to be just that civil. 
  Heather I love you and in the last few months you have become my sister, my best friend, and my roomate. I'm am so so so sorry that I have let all this happen to you and that I have walked away from the fight when I should have taken a stand and fought for what I believed in instead of letting everyone else take a stand for me. I should have defended you from the git go but I was scared to make any waves in the pool of my life to put a stop to it. And for this I am sorry and hope you will forgive me because I hate fighting with you ....

I was so up set I started to cry in the mall.
  I put alot of emotion in sex and moving on from my first to my second was a really big deal for me and I really wanted it to be something special I know Im prople an moron for thinking that sex with a drunk guy would be anything more then wham bam thank you ma'am 
  SO I decided to tell Bobby that we had sex and see what he would say he totaly played it off as it was nothing. He then told me the next day that he was going to get drunk and when I told him to be careful because he has a habit of getting drunk and forgetting what he dose he's responce was ""Well its not like I care what I do when I'm drunk"" 
  So now I'm inda giving up one men for a while I actually have a date with a girl to go to night fall and I'm really excited and guess who it is anyone anyone...Angel Yates ahhhhh She's had a crush on me for years and she was actully the first women that turned me into the bysexual world.

Tonight I told him to be  littel more aggresive but what I really should have said was ""DON'T BE AFRAID TO GRAB A BOOB""  but I did'nt I dont want to scare him. 
  So back to the boobies, I get to go back to the bunny ranch nd Karens working tonight so I'm excited I feel bad cuz heather cant do a lot of these fun things with us cuz she's under age but sooon she'll cch up with all us, okay well were leaveing soon so thats all for now

I miss the whole physical contact thing. Tom and I talked about the wole feelings thing and its really hard to think about your best friend like anything more then your best friend but were woking on it... 
  I don;t know why but for some reson Ive been thinking alot about my mom today, She's poped into my mind here and there all week I guess witht the new house,job,and boyfriend I really wish she was here to see it I mean I feel like its wrong that she's not here like she was cheated out of all this, And I feel bad about vintting the other night about her wieght and about the way she never could do stuff with us because she was to havey but anyone who grew upwith me would know that , that was the way it was
  but then having all these emotions running threw me makes me really tierd so I'm done now...."

"event","so last night Eric was having a party at his parents house in rita ranch so Heather and I decided to go and I was kinda weery because the last few of Eric's party haven't been all that so I thought we would just show up and saty for a few mi9n and leave. Well we get to the house and it's onl;y Paul and Eric so far not good so steadly all the people show and now theres music so its getting better and I finally said to hell with it and take 2 shot in a matter of 10 min so it went stright to my head so Tom was laying on my lap and I was torminting him then he had to leave and so I was said... 
  I started to play this slot game and I look over and Paul is rubbing Heathers back which was harmless intell he tryed to grap a feel and she got up , 
  Now brett and I where out by the pool and decided to go in so we stripped down and went in then Heather, Jesse, paul, Kyla< Eric, and Fozz all followed our lead and went in its was a plast I jumped out of the pool and stripped julie and threwe her in and when I was jumping back in Fozz made a fat joke about me to Joey after that I wanted out of the pool and the party so I threw my clotyhes on and asked Heather if we could leave I went home really pissed and angrey but more scarde then anything 
  My mom was really havey and thats what killed her in the end , I don't want to end up like my m0om I don't want to be to fat to play with my kids or to lead a normal heathley life I wont let that happen to me but it still hurts when you naked in a pool of beauful women and the fat joke get labled to me... Oh well such is life I guess."

  So this job was offered to me and it was a great job full benifits, 10 a hour, and school reimpersment so I was totaly stocked and excited then 12 hours later they say they cant hire me because I but false information on my application which I did'nt but they seem to think so , so I didn't get the job and because I quit the kennel and came back I may not get my raise in september like I thought,  so I may now have to find a new job which I really don't want to do , God when it rains in pours huh.....

  My day read a letter that Robert had written to him a few months ago, it was about being a soilder and how he know that one day he may get sent to iraq and how he's proud even if he dosent agree with the politics of the war it was so moving and emoitanal that I started to ball my eyes out I miss him so vary much I'm so proud of him and what he's doing it made me think of my won life and how I'm living it I mean how many of us can so we make a diffrence in someones lives today doing what we do every day I  know that Roberts not in the heat of battel or anything but he's fighting for our freedom some how. This war will go down in the hitory book and the people who died in it will go down also. Can we say that in a 100 years from now people will open a book read about us and say wow that person changed my life and I wish I could have know them. No one will remimber the teacher or the doctor that helped their great great great grandma but they'll know the person who fought for the freedom in the war on terrisom. 
  Wow that was really deep for one day  so I'll just leave with that for now."

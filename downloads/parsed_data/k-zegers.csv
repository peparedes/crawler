"event","filming of ""transamerica"" is done and i'm just lounging around in new york city, basking in the big apple. i dread for the moment when i step back inside our apartment in los angeles. hopefully, chris hasn't turned it upside down and inside out.

there's <a href=""http://www.cpps90.com/images/other/kz-2004/ellegirl/ellegirlb.jpg"">a briefly mentioning</a> of yours truly in this month's elle girl magazine. i had to do a double-take when they mentioned my butt. pinchable?

finally, i registered a screenname. <b>kaput kevin</b>. but i loathe it so i refuse to sign on."

"event","tom welling not only likes to put people into coma, he also has a secret occupation other than looking good/wholesome/kind/hot. even if you're like a foot taller than me, i can still beat you in basketball.

he's a pimp and he wanna pimp my ass to someone i know only by reputation.

on the other hand, i still need screenname ideas. you people aren't helping at all. don't bug me for not getting online.

"event","today isn't a bright day here in town. since i'm not required for today's filming, wandering around the big apple seemed like the best thing to do despite the weather. but with my usual luck, a shower came my way and i ran into a small coffee shop on the side of an unknown street. picture the central perk in friends and you'll have an idea how the coffee shop looked like. patrons were sparse. an elderly lady came in shortly after i sat down with my decaf latte. by chance she looked my way when i looked up to check the weather outside. nodding to acknowledge the presence of each other, she gave me a smile which reminded me of my grandmother. the sudden surge of homesick feeling had me invite her over to the couch i temporarily claimed mine. for a good hour, we talked about everything and nothing. one thing about her that really stood out was her astounding knowledge of friends. when she mentioned something about chandler having two mothers, i laughed harder than usual. ""hey, this is what i'm dealing with right now."" it was the answer to the question she asked with the bewilderment in her eyes. she didn't give me a follow-up question but simply smiled. the shower stopped long before she rose to leave. ""i hope you like new york, young man. it's a scary but beautiful city.""

i had a wonderful afternoon. how're you all doing?

ps i need suggestions for aim screenname. something cool? or i'll make you fall asleep with a name like ""zzzzzzzzzzzzegers""."

"event","even though i now live in los angeles, i still consider myself a canadian. it's what i've always been and always will be. the festivities of july 4th baffles me. not that i don't enjoy the events and chance to party, there's no sense of belonging to me. several years ago i told a interviewer my dream was to live with a wife and kids back in canada. it's still my dream today. this temporary rooting in california is a part of growing up, being independent and taking responsibilities of my own life. my root is in toronto, ontario.

currently in new york, the busiest city in the world, filming ""transamerica"". would someone please enlighten me on the legal age for drinking in new york state? i can really use a cold one after a long day but if i get caught for underage drinking, the director will certainly be pissed.

before i start to ramble on my first journal entry and scare off everyone, let me simply remind you all to go watch ""the hollow"" when it comes out in october. it's scheduled for the halloween season, featuring nick carter and kaley cuoco. and i promise not to get killed after getting lucky. in fact, probably won't get lucky at all. but that's something i won't tell just yet."

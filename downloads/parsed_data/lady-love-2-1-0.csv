<h2>Taurus - Your Love Profile</h2>
<b>Your positive traits:</b>
<br><br>
You tend to stick with relationships - through the good and the bad.<br>
You are a great listener and tend to give valuable advice.<br>
Cautious and careful, you never jump in recklessly... saving yourself from heartbreak.
<br><br>
<b>Your negative traits:</b>
<br><br>
Money is very important to you, so much so that it's a cause of arguments in relationships.<br>
If your lover isn't loyal or attentive enough to you, your eyes start to wander...<br>
You tend to keep things inside - so your partner may not know when or why you're upset.
<br><br>
<b>Your ideal partner:</b>
<br><br>
Is stable, serious, and ready to be committed to you.<br>
Is successful and able to provide you with the lifestyle you crave.<br>
A true romantic, who is willing to express their desire for your heart.
<br><br>
<b>Your dating style:</b>
<br><br>
Comfortable and traditional. You'd love to have a nice meal at a cozy restaurant.
<br><br>
<b>Your seduction style:</b>
<br><br>
Love comes first for you before you'd even think of intimacy.<br>
Traditional: you're not a cold fish - but you're not into kink either.<br>
Pleasing... you always make sure that your partner is having a good time.
<br><br>
<b>Tips for the future:</b>
<br><br>
Be willing to change your mind. Who you think is the love of your life may be very wrong for you.<br>
Try listening to your mate. While your stubborn streak is hard to break, sometimes your partner knows best.<br>
Ligthen up! The first months of a relationship should be about fun, not intentions.
<br><br>
<b>Best place to meet someone online: </b>
<br><br>

<br><br>
<b>Best color to attract mate:</b> Pale blue

<b>Best day for a date:</b> Friday

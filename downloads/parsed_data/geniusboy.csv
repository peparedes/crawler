Basketball game today, first ever, i hate how the coach favors his son, when he sucks worse than I do. Yeah. We got whooped, like 45-60. Oh well, maybe we should actually make some plays?

Yeah.

Woke up like 12, had people over for football at 3, which the pats won 24-3, wasn't a good game though. 


Mom freaked out on me and called a huge family meeting because of the way people acted when they were over here. Not a big deal, just guys, if you come over, don't talk to my siblings at all, no conversation, it helps a lot, and i've learned if i don't want to get in trouble, don't talk to them.

Played a little bit of UT, and now i'm here.

Sunday- Mother's day, woke up in a crappy ass mood and argued to not go to my baseball practice, i was wrong, went to baseball, pretty fun there actually, came home, played basketball all day and hung out with my mom!

Movies tomorrow, 7:30 at AMC, Alex's dad is driving there and possibly back, if not my mom, for our end. Greg's mom is driving there and back for the south end, because she is staying for the movie, should be fun, Alex's dad has an assload of room left so if anyone wants to go call me before tomorrow or talk to me in school.

"event","Listen to this, guys. This morning during our day off I was online and decided to play a game. Instead of putting up a dumb away messege like, ""Playing Game"" I decided to look at my creative ability. I put up an away messege as follows, "" I am mad at you n%"" (In cas you don't have aol instant messenger n% enters the name of the screename of the person looking at the away messege/profile/whatever) And Michelle looks at it and takes it personally, and leaves me over 65 freakin' messeges like, ""joe, answer me"", ""I know you're there Joe"", and ""Why are you mad at me Joe"" So I get off of my game and tell her that i just put n% and she doesn't comprehend whatever the hell it means. So about an hour ago she calls my house to ask me why I'm mad at her, and at this point I'm like, ""Why can't she just drop it"" and she still doesn't understand what I'm talking about, so right now Michelle thinks that I am mad at her. The only adjectives I can use to describe this situation are, ""Oblivious, thick-skulled, and Dumbass (Darzee)"" Please comment on this bizzare situation, Originally by Joe

Michelle i am mad at you"

Most of the easy trails had side trails and jumps and stuff so we did those a lot. I didn't do too well on the Valley jump trail i don't know why. Oh well, some snowboarders are REALLY stupid."

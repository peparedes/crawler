"event","I&#39;ve been very privileged over the last two weeks to see two excellent concerts by the Halle orchestra at the Bridgewater Hall. I used to go to concerts quite regularly but somehow slipped out of the habit. About a month ago they were advertising the new season and Lesley Garrett was billed as appearing alongside the Halle. Well, I couldn&#39;t miss that. So I trotted along and got a ticket.

Unfortunately, due to a family bereavement, Lesley had to pull out so instead we got Alison Balsalm on the trumpet. The concert kicked off with Tintagel by Bax, a wonderful piece that heard before and the Alison came on gave us a Haydn Trumpet Concerto followed by Piazzola Linertango - &nbsp;a lovely jazzy jaunty tango number. Then she nipped off and quickly nipped on again bringing her flugelhorn on which, accompanied by the Halle, she gave a lovely version of Someone To Watch Over Me.

Following the Interval we had Barber&#39;s Adagio for Strings, one of the most beautiful pieces of music ever written and one of my favourite classical compositions. When the Halle played it, the audience were rapt, hanging on every note, those heart rending notes the only sound in an auditorium that holds over 2000 ,

And then Sir Mark Elder conducted the entire Variations on an Original Theme &quot;Enigma&quot; by Elgar. Like most people I know Nimrod but I&#39;d never heard the entire work. My night was made when the Bridgewater&#39;s organ joined the party. It&#39;s long been an ambition to hear that instrument being played and so i got to tick one small item off the &#39;bucket list&#39; And by the way, it sounds magnificent especially in tandem with a full orchestra.

Tonight was &nbsp;Wild West. The orchestra eschewed the usual formal wear and turned in jeans, checked shirts and stetsons and Carl Davis wore a Sheriff&#39;s badge (well he was conducting) and treated us to a selection of themes from Westerns (one of my favorite movie genres). We had among others the William Tell Overture (aka The Lone Ranger), The Big Country, Okalahoma, a medley of TV themes and of course The Magnificent Seven.

The orchestra seemed to be enjoying themselves, the audience certainly were and demanded on encore. Davis turns to the crowd and talks about how much of South West USA was originally a Spanish possession and of the large Spanish influence - particularly musically - &nbsp;there has been and continues in America.He turns to the Halle orchestra who launch in La Bamba.

One of the UK&#39;s (and worlds) most renowned classical orchestras playing a 50&#39;s pop hit. And playing it brilliantly, smiles across the musician&#39;s faces, the audience joyfully clapping along. It was just a magnificent moment. Somewhere Richie Valens is jumping for joy.

A lovely coda to the night was the chance to thank Carl Davis for that La Bamba moment. And to buy a CD of movies themes conducted and get it signed. It&#39;s on now. The Good The Bad and The Ugly just finished. Now it&#39;s &nbsp;High Noon."

He took the bus from Stafford, 17 miles away. I took the train from Manchester, 59 miles away. I still got there first

Whilst eating a tasty Chinese takeaway, the news informed me that team GB had won two more Gold medals in the Rowing Tonight I watched the athletics and saw Jessica Ennis, Greg Rutherford and Mo Farrah bring home the Golds!
And I&#39;ve just found out we got another Gold in the Cycling.

Six Gold medals in one day. Three athletics Gold medals in one night. Third in the overall medal table.

"event","It has been a good day, though a long one

I got my shopping done early, Then for the first time in about two weeks, I ventured out with my&nbsp;bandanna and sunglasses on and my coat off. (Though I had one in my bag - this is Manchester). Finally, a decent&nbsp;summers&nbsp;day. Blue skys! &nbsp;Warmth! The SUN!!

The reason for this outing was that the cinema in Manchester charges &pound;4.00 for showings before noon, &nbsp;I was going to the &nbsp;11:00 showing of The Dark Knight Rises ( hence the early shop) I will not give away any spoilers but I will say it is very, very good. A brilliant conclusion to Christopher Nolans&#39; trilogy

On leaving the cinema I noticed&nbsp;that&nbsp;several&nbsp;people&nbsp;in costume were wandering about. It turned out that the MCM Comic Expo was taking&nbsp;place&nbsp;at Manchester Central (formerly G-MEX) and there were many cosplayers in some quite&nbsp;brilliant&nbsp;costumes. Amongst the ones I recognised (I&#39;m not into anime and&nbsp;there&nbsp;were quite a few anime/manga costumes) were the Ghostbusters, several Starfleet officers, a Cylon and some Imperial Stormtroopers (who&#39;d win in a fight between those?), Lara Croft, &nbsp;Spiderwoman (Jessica Drew) (Anyone&nbsp;remember&nbsp;that cartoon) .... and appropriately enough a Batman, a Joker and a Catwoman. Had I known it was on, I might have attended dressed as Spike for I do own the neccesary&nbsp;accoutrements

After a spot of lunch, I visited the People&#39;s History Museum. As the name suggest it tells the history of people&#39;s struggle to earn the rights and freedoms we enjoy today. It&nbsp;covers&nbsp;the campaign for&nbsp;parliamentary&nbsp;reform (including the Peterloo&nbsp;massacre, votes for women, workers rights (with some emphasis on the trade union&nbsp;moment) and in more recent times, the campaigns&nbsp;against&nbsp;discrimination on grounds of gender or race or sexuality. It&#39;s worth a visit

Then after wandering around Manchester for a bit, just enjoying the decent weather, I decided to eat out but didn&#39;t fancy anywhere in the City Centre. So I went to Frankie &amp; Benny&#39;s on Salford Quays. I had a really nice meal and seeing as we had a bit of summer at last, I had an ice cream sundae for desert!

Then it was home to a cup of tea and The Hollow Crown - Henry V. I missed the first 15 minutes but didn&#39;t mind too much as that&#39;s the boring bit with the whole Salic law sequence and the tennis balls. It was a very good adaptation and I loved what they did with the Chorus right at the end . It was very clever and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen it played that way before."

"event","I&#39;ve just got back from a football match - England Women v Holland Women<br /><br />It was no friendly either but a full competitive international. A qualifier for the Womens&#39; Euro 2013 Finals<br />One England quite needed to win as only the top side in each group automatically qualify. A loss or a draw and England almost certainly find themselves having to qualify via a play-off&nbsp;<br /><br />It was being played at the new City of Salford Stadium just down the road and figuring you don&#39;t get to see the national side every day (and the ticket prices were a bargain) I decided to have an afternoon out.<br /><br />I&#39;m really glad I did!<br /><br />The new stadium is really nice &nbsp;and there was a great family party atmosphere there. People had bought along their kids (or being Father&#39;s Day, maybe kids had&nbsp;bought&nbsp;along their parents). There were a&nbsp;sprinkling&nbsp;of Holland fans who&nbsp;made&nbsp;the trip and they were sat&nbsp;together&nbsp;but there was no enforced&nbsp;separation.&nbsp;<br /><br />I&#39;m not a sports fan but I enjoyed the game. There was attacking football from both sides and they weren&#39;t afraid to tackle each other. Best of all, if anyone was tackled , they got straight back up, no writhing on the ground trying to get a free kick. At one point I swear the force of a tackle sent one of the England&nbsp;defenders&nbsp;into a somersault and&nbsp;then&nbsp;to the floor. She got back up and stuck in again.<br /><br />As for the result. Well,, it&#39;s possible that some people did record Match of the Day (It was on BBC 2) so if you want to know the result the official Facebook page is here&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/EnglandWomen"">https://www.facebook.com/EnglandWomen</a><br />"

"event","But I ddin&#39;t want this one

This morning whilst riding into work, I was alongside a double decker&nbsp;bus in the adjacent bus lane.
It seems a driver at a &nbsp;junction had stopped sticking his car&#39;s nose out just a little so the bus had to pull out a little bit to avoid taking the car&#39;s front end off.

The driver of said bus did this without indicating or seemingly checking his mirrors because he swung out right in front of me. I dropped the anchors and&nbsp; just about avoided slamming myself into the back&nbsp;of a double decker at 30 mph. Had I hit it,&nbsp;I would certainly have been thrown off the bike. I would probably have been run over by the closely following rush hour traffic.

Two minutes later, and still a later shaken, I almost turned right, plumb in front of an oncoming car. I had turned the handlebars and twisted the throttle but, thank gods, some warning instinct or sixth sense made me look just as I did so.&nbsp; Anchors away again!

To be honest, this sort of thing is a little par for the course, though it&#39;s not usually double deckers, so you learn to shake it off. But&nbsp;two near misses in as many minutes is&nbsp;somewhat harder to recover from. I was feeling physically sick all the rest of the way into work. I should probably have just turned round and gone home but hoped I might to feel better when I got to work.

At work,&nbsp;people immediately thought&nbsp;I was ill&nbsp;so I must have looked terrible.&nbsp;I felt like I was going to be sick and I couldn&#39;t focus. Easy things like typing in my password required a second or two to recall them.&nbsp; I made myself a&nbsp;mug of hot sweet tea, my manger sent me to have a quiet sit down but I was still feeling crap.

So&nbsp;I got sent home. I should probably have taken the tram and left the bike.&nbsp;I didn&#39;t!&nbsp;I&#39;ve had&nbsp;two bikes stolen already; I&#39;m not leaving my scooter probbaly overnight in Manchester City Cente. Besides if the horse tries to throw you, you&#39;re supposed to get straight back on, right?

As the rush hour had finished there was virtually no traffic and&nbsp;I took it slowly and carefully.&nbsp; I am now curled up on the sofa with another cup&nbsp;of tea and I&#39;m staring to feel a little better. A bit of lunch is in the oven; food will probbaly help too.

This blog is helping also. I&#39;m able to make sense of what happened, to&nbsp;work out&nbsp;why it affected me like this. It sounds wierd&nbsp;but it bothered me that I was so bothered by this, getting me caught up in a circular loop. Thinking about it, I&#39;d probably have been OK if it had only been the bus but two was probably too much to just brush off.

Anyway lunch is ready. Food, a cuppa and then after I think&nbsp;I will chill out and watch some DVDs. My new Millenium Trilogy box set would be cool"

"event","Day off work today.

Got up, went to laundrette, washed up and then went into Manchester

Had lunch at Wetherspoons; It was steak and chips. I asked for it medium-well but what&nbsp;I got seemed more like&nbsp;well done. Well done probably means they cremate it.

Went to HMV to spend&nbsp;gift cad&nbsp;I got at Christmas. I wanted the&nbsp;original&nbsp;&nbsp;Millenium Trilogy Extended Edition box set.&nbsp; Pleasantly surprised to find it discounted in the sale from &pound;29 to &pound;18. With my &pound;10 gift card, I only paid &pound;8. So an (almost) &pound;30 box set for &pound;8. Score!

Then went to cinema to see the remake version. It is very good. I haven&#39;t seen the original film since I saw it at the cinema but IIRC the new film follows the&nbsp; book even more closely than it did. Rooney Mara was brilliant as Lisbeth&nbsp;Salander, stepping into Noomi Rapace&#39;s boots effortlessly. The best compliment I can pay is that it&nbsp;has not occurred to me to compare her performance with Noomi

Then after that,&nbsp;I went to Frankie &amp; Benny&#39;s for tea. Good food, good service until they got busy right at the end of my meal and forgot to bring my coffee."

"event","It&#39;s my birthday today and so far it has been great.

I&#39;ve been off work since Thursday and I&#39;m off work tomorrow as well.

Spent most of Thursday and Friday chilling out and watching some of the complete Star Trek: Deep Space Nine that I received for Christmas.

Yesterday was brilliant! My friend Bev (who had her birthday on Monday) and&nbsp;I went to London to see the musical Rock of Ages. But before that we went to Earls Court to a little Italian restaurant&nbsp;&nbsp;I know. It was wonderful. Good food and great service. And when the owner of the place heard we&#39;d blown in all the way from Manchester for a double birthday bash, we got given a complimentary&nbsp;glass of Liqueur each,&nbsp;&nbsp;which was a lovely thing to do and just topped off the meal.&nbsp;

Then it was time for the show. It was&nbsp; brilliant. I&#39;m not doing a review here but it has all the old 80&#39;s Rock songs I grew up listening to and- as befits the material - fails to take itself too seriously. It is a good show and if you have a fondness for overblown 80s Rock you should go see it.

Today,&nbsp;I have opened my cards and present (I got a copy of Stephen King&#39;s &#39;On Writing&#39;) and have watched more DS9.

I have also received several phone calls wishing me Happy Birthday from friends and family, including a friend in Germany, which was all the more lovely for being unexpected. On Facebook I recived loads of Happy Birthday posts on my wall. To those of you reading this on Facbeook, thank you very much. You have helped make my birthday a memorable one.

I have gone out for a splendid lunch at my favourite restaurant which was accompanied by some equally splendid glasses of&nbsp;wine. My pudding, when it came, had a candle on it.&nbsp;

I kept the candle and it is even now adorning the mini-pizza I am having for tea.

Tomorrow I am planning to go the pictures and see the remake of Girl With A Dragon Tattoo"

"event","I was at work.

We had the radio on for the background noise and slowly I became aware that they weren&#39;t playing any music. They were talking about New York and aeroplanes. I rang our other office to find out if they&#39;d heard anything but they hadn&#39;t.&nbsp; Then what happened began to emerge and it was unbelievable, &nbsp;like&nbsp; something out a disaster movie. But it was real. The rest of the day wet by in a shocked daze listening to things on the radio and that evening, seeing pictures on TV that seemed unreal but were.

Four years later,&nbsp;I was at work again when news of 7/7 broke. I wasn&#39;t shocked that time.Surprised&nbsp; at&nbsp;but not shocked.&nbsp;Then I felt&nbsp;resigned inevitabilty. &nbsp;I thought, &quot;They finally got us too&quot;. Then I phoned my aunt who lived in London just to make sure she was OK. She was.

In the days immediately after , there was an online campaign (Facebook was just getting big) of&nbsp;people posting the defiant status, &quot;We&#39;re Still Here&quot; . I&nbsp;posted too.&nbsp;

So 10 years on from September 11, I pay my repsects to all those in the four planes, in the Towers and at the Pentagon and to all the brave men and women who fought so hard to save as many as they could.

And I remember those who died in the attacks in London.

And to those who would attack us in the name of their religion - or what you think is your religion but is really a twisted and perverted mockery of it -&nbsp; you will never win because always We&#39;re Still Here."

Well, they were going on a day trip to Whitby and asked me if I'd like to go. <br /><br />So I got up at 6.30 to be picked at 7.30, to catch a coach at 8.00.&nbsp; It was a nice but long trip down. The roads through the North Yorkshire Moors are stunning - I want to go back on the scooter. <br /><br />Got into Whitby around 12.30&nbsp; and we went for lunch at a little cafe called Sherlock's on Baker Street (LOL) .&nbsp; Bev had a Dracula Delight&nbsp; sundae (Chocolate and vanilla &nbsp;ice cream decorated with a chocolate bat). <br /><br />Then we browsed a Gothic clothing shop. We were all tempted. Me by a black dress shirt with a cravat and a lovely red velvet red waistcoat (I may still go online to order the waistcoat) I eventually walked out with a new belt, a shiny belt buckle and a&nbsp;skull and crossbones bandanna <br /><br />Another Gothic shop followed which had some nice daisho (sets of samurai sword) and a very Gothic throne in which you could have your picture&nbsp;taken. <br /><br />I&nbsp;was dressed appropriately all in black,boots, jeans, t-shirt, my bandanna, oh and the long leather jacket.&nbsp; Had I known how hot it would be yesterday, I may have thought again. That said if you're gonna wear&nbsp;a full length black leather jacket a la Spike anywhere, then Whitby is the place to do it. Sometimes, you have to make sacrifices. <br /><br />After that, three of us went around the Dracula Experience, a sort of walk though haunted house attraction themed around Dracula. The couple behind got quite a shock dressed as an actor dressed as Dracula jumped out of them. <br /><br />After this ice cream happened followed by boat trip around the harbour aboard a replica of Captain Cook's ship, the Endeavour, which set sail from Whitby. If you go to Whitby you have to do this, it's the best way of seeing the ruins of the Abbey. You sail out of the harbour and you can see the Abbey perched above you on the headland. <br /><br />Then we had a walk around the old town and we went into one of the shops selling Whitby Jet and a very cute silver bat pendant with jet eyes was bought by one of the girls <br /><br />Then we went into another cafe for a quicu cuppa before some brief souvenir shopping after which we got back on our coach. <br /><br />The driver took us back by a different route as apparently York was a traffic jam so we got to see yet more breathtaking North Yorkshire scenery. I finally got home at dead on 9pm. A long day but a really great one<br /><br />Photos: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.2210252814445.133210.1191235286&amp;l=5cf3ae478c"">www.facebook.com/media/set/</a>"

I enjoyed it. Not the ,ost highbrow programme you'll ever see but gloriously entertaining. 

Was really impressed by Joseph Feinnes as Merlin. And Eva Green makes a fabulous Morgan, scheming seductive - and damn sexy. 

My main beef is with Arthur. I don't believe in him as the guy who's going to be the legendary King Arthur. &nbsp;I'm not sure if it's down to the writing of the character, the way&nbsp;Gellert Grindlewand (sorry, Jamie Campbell-Bower) is playing him&nbsp;or a combination of the two but he's a wuss - and an idiot.! 

When he retrieved the sword, why did he throw the rope back down instead of tying of himself to the waterfall?&nbsp;That way he wouldn't fallen off. When he was wearing Uther's robes, he didn't look kingly, he&nbsp;looked like a little boy playing dress-up in 

Hopefully as the series goes on , we'll see him grow into&nbsp;his role&nbsp;and man up a little. Talking of which, he should grow a beard - that's if he's shaving yet"

"event","<br /><span class=""messageBody"">Have had an awesome day.<br />&nbsp;<br />I've owned my new scooter for about two months but just before easter, the fault light on the dashboard started coming on - and staying on. These can so often be something or nothing. In my case it was both. The bike was rideable but it wasn't riding right.<br /><br />So all through April, through all of that glorious Spring weather, the scooter stayed in the garage as I was scared that the niggling little fault might turn serious in the middle of nowhere.<br /><br />About&nbsp;2 weeks ago, the bike came back from the garage again and this time I think it is fixed (I shall not any definitive statements as they will Jinx me) so I've been itching to finally take it for a nice long ride. I figured this Bank Holiday Weekend would be ideal. Until&nbsp;I saw the weather report<br /><br />But at around 11:30, the rain had stopped, the wind had dropped and although though it was still overcast, it seemed to be clearing. So I took a chance and headed South West into Cymru. Llangollen to be precise.<br /><br />The chance paid off because in&nbsp;Wales the sky was blue and&nbsp;the sun was shining.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;had a lovely lunch ina cafe then&nbsp;took the road&nbsp;over Horseshoe Pass. (A favourite biker run) then&nbsp;rode on a steam train and walked over Britain#s longest aqueduct . (photos to follow)&nbsp;<br /><br />The trip home&nbsp;was a flyer. I had almost empty roads - even the car park that is usually the M56&nbsp;was&nbsp;quiet - and&nbsp;got back in time to watch 3/4 of the European Cup Final.&nbsp; It's a shame MUFC lost but Barca played the best football I have ever seen.</span><br />"

I voted LibDem at the last election. 
I was even pleased when they formed a coalition with the Tories. I thought maybe they'd be able to act as a brake. Put a halt to the worst of the Tory excessess. 

Today the Brown report recommended removing the university tuition fees cap. One of the LibDems &nbsp;big election promises was to oppose any rise in university tuition fees.&nbsp; Today Vince Cable stood in the Commons and said that policy was no longer 'feasible in the current economic climate' 

Bastard!&nbsp; This is just the latest example of the LibDems lying down and letting their coalition 'partners' (HA!) walk all over them. Bloody Bastard Doormats. That's all they are. 

They've lost my vote! Problem is who do I vote for now?

"event","<p>Yesterday,&nbsp;I went to see Scott Pilgrim Vs The World<br /><br />I wasn't expecting that much. I'd seen the trailer a couple of months ago and to be honest, it looked like the biggest pile of turkey poo that had ever been released. I'm talking worse than The Spirit, which to date is the only film I've ever walked out of. I decided that for this one,&nbsp;I wasn't even gonna walk in.<br /><br />But it got some good press. I found out that Edgar Wright was directing it and I do like Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead. Then when it came out it got some positive reviews <br /><br />So I thought, what the hell. It'll be a popcorn movie, stupid dumb and overblown but an inoffensive and not un-amusing way to waste a few hours.<br /><br />But something pretty cool happened. The opening just grabbed me and for a couple of hours I travelled to a world where video games happen in real life.&nbsp;As a teenager I was&nbsp;playing 8 bit games on my Spectrum and later&nbsp;MegaDrive , kicking arse (well trying -&nbsp;I was never that good) on Mortal Combat whilst rock music blasted out the stereo. And that teenager got to come out and play.<br /><br />Yeah, the movie may have more style than substance - but what style.&nbsp; It IS&nbsp;a popcorn movie but it's a awesome thrill ride guilty pleasure popcorn movie.<br /><br />And then there was Merlin. The first two episodes were epic and&nbsp;I was already looking forward to more of the same as the trailer played at the end of last week's episode. A goblin?&nbsp; Oh no! You do a massive two-parter and now you're going to do Creature of the Week? <br /><br />I just watched it. The episode is stupid, far fetched and totally ridiculous. It's also a bloody triumph. I&nbsp;almost wet myself laughing. They knew they couldn't top the season opener. So they didn't try.&nbsp;Instead they've completely gone&nbsp;the other way and done a full on comedy episode. They break all the rules, use all the old jokes :&nbsp;fart jokes, bald jokes,&nbsp;&nbsp;the arm-wrestling gag&nbsp;. Everything you shouldn't do, that episode does it. It should be a disaster but it&nbsp;works brilliantly.<br /><br />What makes it is Richard Wilson's performance as the Goblin posessed Gaius. You can tell he was having so much fun doing that. &nbsp;That comes across and carries you along.<br /><br />It's nice to be surprised , to find something isn't mediocre, is better than you expected. It's even better to be surprised twice.<br /><br />EDIT:&nbsp;Have just watched Juno. A brilliant comedy. Like the&nbsp;best comedies, it's funny becuase it pokes fun at things that are true. &nbsp;Michael Cera (Scott Pilgrim) is in it.&nbsp; That's two of his fims I've seen this weekend. The kid can act.&nbsp;&nbsp;If I'd seen Juno before Scoot Pilgrim, I don't think I'd have been as pessimistic</p>"

"event","<p><br />&nbsp;A quick review-ette of I Shall Wear Midnight.<br /><br />First time around, I just wanted to read the story so wasn't reading it in depth. So these are just my initial impressions. I'm sure other people will be along presently with a in depth page-by-page review and<br />annotations.</p><p>I tried to keep it Spoiler-lite but there a few so exercise caution.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p><lj-cut text=""POSSIBLE SPOILERS HERE""><p>It is marvelous. It is almost certainly the last Tiffany book, and if Terry writes about Tiffany again, it's not going to be within a children's/young adult novel. As the title - a quote in 'A Hat of Sky' when Tiffany declared, &quot;When I am old I shall wear&nbsp;midnight&quot; - suggests, this is the book where Tiffany enters adulthood.</p><p>In this book, she's holding down her own patch. Significantly, in the other three books, she's always had a little bit of help but here she insists, in the face of help almost being forced upon her, of sorting out her own problems.&nbsp; So anything further would have to be in an 'adult' book.</p><p>There are some real treats in it for the fans. Some good news for a favourite character and the return of another character, who's fate has long been a subject of speculation. Well, we finally get some answers. Those answers raise more yet questions tantalising fans with the possibility -and the hope - that the returnee may return once more.</p><p>There's also some new characters introduced whose tales are ripe for continuation and it would be great to read more of them in the future.</p><p>My only criticism of the book is in the antagonist. In this book, it's a more insidious, less tangible enemy than in the other three. As such, it's the most dangerous enemy Tiffany has faced and a suitable opponent for her to show just how much she learnt over the books. But this intangibility means there's no actual personification of evil to boo and hiss, if you like, no single figure to cheer Tiffany on against. As a result this, actually, most threatening of enemies doesn't always appear to be especially threatening.</p><p>It seems to me that Terry's got loads more he could tell us about Tiffany. So this&nbsp; may be the last Tiffany centred book but this may not be the last we hear of Ms Aching.</p></lj-cut>"

"event","<h2>&nbsp;</h2><lj-cut text=""Friday""><h2><u><font size=""3"">Friday</font></u></h2><p>The fun, for certain values of fun started before the Convention. I wanted to wear my Mort Maskerade costume from 2 years ago as a hall costume. A friend had lent the short red wig, I used, so I&rsquo;d asked them at the beginning of August to lend it me again. Unfortunately, they let me down. I called into a proper wig shop on the way to the rail station but they had nothing suitable in stock. So, I went to the fancy dress shop in the Andale and bought a neon orange fancy dress wig that would be acceptable. Any port in a storm as they say.</p><p>&nbsp;Arrived about 3pm and even as I walked through the corridors to reception, I was seeing familiar faces and being met with warm greetings. I was sharing again with Vince and the booking was in his name so I&rsquo;d been worried that the hotel would have no record of me. But they were unfounded as I got checked into my room straight away</p><p>Dropped off my bags, went to register and mingled for a spell, saying hello to old friends. It was wonderful. It felt almost like coming home.</p><p>Then I attended my first event, An Audience with Stephen Briggs. He was feeling kinda pleased as he had a sword that had been used on The Princess Bride. It wasn&rsquo;t quite Inigo Montoya&rsquo;s sword as Terry said later, but Cary Elwes had practiced with it &ndash; which made it pretty darn close.</p><p>Around 7pm, I met up with Brian&nbsp;(<lj user=""sabremeister""/>) and Rgemini for dinner. We all wanted the chicken and it had run out and so we waited for around 20 minutes for new supplies. By this time it was getting perilously close to the opening ceremony and I found myself unable to just relax and enjoy my food &ndash; which although tasty was not I considered, worth waiting 20 minutes and paying over &pound;10 for.</p><p>I was maybe precipitous in this judgement and perhaps things did get better over the weekend but I decided at that point I would be eating out.</p><p>And then it was the Opening Ceremony. Terry one-upped Stephen entering with Death&rsquo;s sword, announcing that although Briggs had Inigio Montoya&rsquo;s sword, he had this one. To a heartfelt cheer, he announced the PCA wasn&rsquo;t any worse and that the writing was going well, his dictation software so good that he could dictate 20,000 words easily&nbsp;- oh, and it understood Nac Mac Feegle!</p><p>I hadn&rsquo;t bought a costume for the Bedtime Stories, but as part of the Executive room upgrade, the hotel had provided a bathrobe and slippers. These were pressed into service and I went down, clutching Speedbump (a plush hedgehog) to the Bedtime Stories.</p><p>Rob entered and was about to read I Shall Midnight when Terry interrupted saying he couldn&rsquo;t do the Feegle voices so Rob pulled out a folder containing the draft of Snuff and to applause, started reading that instead.</p><p>I must admit that I left Bedtime Stories before it finished. As it tends to, it overran and I wanted very much to attend Once More With Feeling. Under the bathrobe were a red shirt, black T-shirt and black jeans. My leather duster and Doc Martens were in my bag. Yes, Spike had places to be, and so I excused myself.</p><p>OMWF was great fun. The episode was screened in the Odium with the subtitles and everyone was singing along.</p><p>And then I retired to the bar. I tried to buy Brian Nesbit, the Chairman a drink but was told by the bar staff they&rsquo;d run out of Hobgoblin. On relating this news, Hotel Liaison went and had Words with the bar staff as Arrangements had been made so This Would Not Happen. I stood by, feeling Slightly Evil and Pleased With Myself for having Gotten People Into Trouble.</p><p>I then started chatting with Heather (<lj user=""burntcopper""/>)and&nbsp;Taz. The conversation took several interesting turns that resulted in me Getting Myself Into Trouble &ndash; but, given the company I was in, that wasn&rsquo;t necessarily a Bad Thing.</p><p>At 3am, I went to bed.</p></lj-cut><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><lj-cut text=""Saturday""><p><u><font size=""3"">Saturday</font></u><br />I don&rsquo;t sleep well in hotel beds. The only beds I really sleep well in are my own and the one in my parents&rsquo; spare room. So, despite the late night (or is that early morning), it was an involuntary early start at 7am.</p><p>I woke feeling Less Than Human and with a Massive Headache. A shower and hearty breakfast helped with the Humanity but nothing was going to help the headache.</p><p>&nbsp;Retail therapy happened as I decided to lighten the heavy wallet I was carrying. I adopted a dragon, courtesy of the Cunning Artificer (I&rsquo;m wondering if I really need to fill in and send in the certificate) and bought a Convention T-shirt plus a mini Anthill inside T-shirt for Speedbump.</p><p>Then if it was off to Ian Stewart&rsquo;s talk on the Deterministic Monkey Theorem. It&rsquo;s hard to take in maths and science when your head is pounding but I managed to understand a good portion of an entertaining talk. .</p><p>Following this was Elves: Nasty or Nice. Jacqueline Simpson regaled us with wonderful stories from folklore all around Europe in which the Elves were by turns Nasty and Nice. Unfortunately, the Queen of the Elves did not like what she was hearing and threatened Jacqueline. However, Dr Simpson rallied magnificently brandishing an iron poker that put Her Majesty to flight.</p><p>Deciding to take advantage of one of the Executive upgrade perks, I went up to the executive lounge for a coffee and a snack before going to see a round of Unseen University Challenge.</p><p>Following this, it was time for The Man in the Hat, otherwise known as the guest of honour interview. Things became very interesting when Stephen Baxter came onstage and we were treated to a live brainstorming session as the two threw ideas and discussed the Long Earth project as we watched. It was a fascinating insight into how the authorial mind thinks and how books get written.</p><p>By now, I was really tired and the headache was still throbbing away. There was nothing for it but to scrounge a Nurofen and go and get some kip. And I must admit that on waking 90 minutes later to go out for dinner, I felt a whole world better.</p><p>And so to the Maskerade.&nbsp;It was hosted by&nbsp;Pat Harkin. For some reason, last time around people started quacking at him. As anyone who&rsquo;s been to a convention knows, if something is done once it&rsquo;s a tradition and so we carried on the traditional quacking. (I was in the Maskerade last time so don&rsquo;t know the Origin of this custom. I&rsquo;d be grateful to anyone who could elucidate).&nbsp;The standard was very high, a sit always is but I felt this year was particularly good. Special mentions from me go to Brian Dale as Lord Vetinari Retiring (winner of the Master class) and <lj user=""ssirienna""/>&nbsp; who won the whole thing with her traditionally built opera singer performing the Departure aria</p><p>&nbsp;The Hedgehog Party was as usual brilliant fun. Lots of dancing, unusual sweets to sample and a very nice after-eight flavoured vodka. Oh, and Gideon (<lj user=""gmh""/>) wore Silver Trousers of Doom. We will not talk of them.</p></lj-cut><p>&nbsp;</p><lj-cut text=""Sunday""><p><u><font size=""3"">Sunday</font></u><br />The first half of the day had, as Sundays should, a religious theme.</p><p>It began with the, as ever, extremely spiritual and uplifting Church of Om Service with Brother Mole and Reverend Fanthrope officiating &ndash; and with my friend Bev as Mrs Grubb providing distractions. During the Periwinkle and Butcher had their marriage blessed to much applause.</p><p>Then it was, for me an event that I think I may look forward to more than ay other -&nbsp;Create Your Own Religion. Once again Brian Nesbit, employed his cat-herding skills and together we founded the world&rsquo;s next Great Religion (maybe). This time around, we decided to venerate clich&eacute;s.</p><p>Another item I&rsquo;ve always looked forward to but unlike CYOM, always seemed to miss was&nbsp;How to Buckle a Swash. It was pleased to be able to set that oversight right and found out that I&rsquo;ve been missing an excellent, entertaining and informative event. Over the course of (just slightly more than) a hour Orjan together with his glamorous assistants (and Heather (<lj user=""burntcopper""/>) [Sorry! Couldn&rsquo;t resist] demonstrated how Hollywood got swordfighting completely wrong. (For the record glmaourous assistant credit goes to <lj user=""marco_villalta""/>&nbsp; and <lj user=""gmh""/>)&nbsp;</p><p>In between these events I managed to grab my trucks and hit the pool with Tal (<lj user=""tinkerbell1980""/>&nbsp;) and after Buckle a Swash, several friends and I repaired to the Executive lounge for a nice cup of coffee. Sometimes, just taking time out with friends is the nicest event you can attend.</p><p>&nbsp;After some relaxing down time followed by dinner, I put on the Mort costume and went down for the Coronation of the Low King, the precursor to the Gala dinner. I was worried that I was actually a bit overdressed as I didn&rsquo;t attend the dinner this year but it seemed everyone, dinner attendee or not, was in their finery so I was in good company. As usual, some of the costumes and ballgowns on display were breathtaking and there was a definite Steampunk vibe in the air.</p><p>To much cheering Jennifer Delaney (<lj user=""clanwilliam""/>&nbsp;)was crowned Low King. She probably got in through her election pledge to given everyone the answers to the 2012 pre-con pub quiz. Now the hoopla has died down, it can be safely pointed that she a) didn&rsquo;t promise to give the correct answers, and b) that she always gives the answers in any case &ndash; at the end of the quiz. However, she thoroughly deserved to win for Jen is without doubt the lowest person I know.</p><p>The Rat race entertainer was excellent&nbsp;&nbsp; with all manner of activities. I took part an even won a game of Nugganite Twister (Abominations instead of coloured spots). I spent the evening drifting back and forth between it and the Scone and Jam .</p></lj-cut><p>&nbsp;</p><lj-cut text=""Monday""><p><u><font size=""3"">Monday</font></u><br />First event on the agenda was The Science of Discworld, a wonderfully entertaining talk by Jack Stewart and Ian Cohen on just how the science of Discworld books came about.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;I then drifted into the Dealer&rsquo;s room and had a lovely chat with MEG (<lj user=""djelibeybi_meg""/>&nbsp;), and relieved her of a Graham Higgins print.</p><p>&nbsp;On my way to have lunch, I encountered a crowd of people filing into the Odium for a viewing of Dr Horrible&rsquo;s Sing-Along-Blog. This had been suggested the screening of Once More With Feeling and happily David&nbsp;(<lj user=""medium_jock""/>&nbsp;) had his DVD with him.&nbsp;If you show it, they will come. And indeed sing along.</p><p>Following a pleasant (slightly postponed) lunch by the lake, I the drifted up to see the Seamstresses attempt to set the World Record for number of people fitted under a crinoline skirt. This was highly diverting. I myself was disqualified as my bum was sticking out</p><p>&nbsp;Unfortunately, I had to leave before proceedings ended, as I needed to don my costume in which to attend the Rocky Horror Discworld Show. The effect of the costume was all I could have hoped. My dark soul revelled as the mere sight of my ensemble Broke People. I received numerous double takes and several tortured souls, including the indomitable Heather (<lj user=""burntcopper""/>), were heard to exclaim &lsquo;Oh My God!&rsquo;&nbsp;(There are photos but such is their potential to Warp Fragile Minds that they are not posted online and are available on request only)</p><p>The RHDS itself was wonderful a production on a scale I don&rsquo;t think has been before at a Convention. No-one who saw Vetinari portrayed, as Frank&rsquo;n&rsquo;Furter will ever quite forget it.</p><p>&nbsp;Shortly after, it was time for the Closing Ceremony. The Seamstresses Guild won and were quite pleased about this. Brian Nesbit, stated that he believed there were things he could do that would make the Convention even better and so he was going to stay on as Chairman in order to try. Foolish Mortal!</p><p>And then it was time to go home. Hugs were exchanged, emotional goodbyes were said.</p><p>Another wonderful convention. Perhaps the best yet. Thank you to all my friends who were there to share it with me and helped make it as enjoyable as it was.&nbsp;We&rsquo;ll do it all again in two years.</p></lj-cut><p>Photos at: <span style=""color: black""><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=77457&amp;id=1191235286&amp;l=bc6b0e4442"">http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=77457&amp;id=1191235286&amp;l=bc6b0e4442</a></span></p><br />"

"event","Been a couple of weeks since my last proper post.

I am still alive. (Sorry)

The Pansy is still alive .

It's been busy.

About 2 weeks ago the drama group had a play on and I helped out backstage. It went very smoothly and I had a good time because I was working with B. She's a Pratchett fan so we share a similar sense of humour, &nbsp;which&nbsp;to our mutual delight, we use to be satirical and ironic at the actors. Actors Must Suffer! Stage Crew Rule! 

It was my parents' 40th wedding anniversary.&nbsp;I bought them a&nbsp; bottle of Ruby port (No prizes for guessing the popular name for 40th anniverasaries). However, I was told by one who knows about these things that Ruby port is not&nbsp;exceptional port &nbsp;&nbsp;- it is your usual&nbsp;acceptable port.&nbsp;&nbsp;But as 40 years warrants something exceptional &nbsp;rather than merely acceptable, I also gave them a smaller bottle of Tawny port suitable for the magnificence of the ocassion. It worked. Mum and Dad phoned me up on the day of their anniversary extolling the virtues of their present, whcih they were in fact, at that point drinking with great enthusiasm. To quote my favourite 1980's action show, &quot;I love it when a plan come together.&quot;

Over the Bank Holiday,&nbsp;I watched the Lord of the Rings box set. My favourite part was the documentary about Cameron Duncan on the Return of the King Appendices Part 2.&nbsp; It's a fitting tribute to a young filmaker who was superbly talented - and could&nbsp;have become one of the&nbsp;greats &nbsp;-&nbsp;that he is forever part of such a&nbsp;massive film as Lord of the Rings.

I juggled LOTR with Sky's 1 going Postal. They chanegd a lot of things but got more right than they got wrong. It definitely captured the feel of the book. &nbsp;Clare Foy WAS Adora Belle Dearheart. And Charles Dance as the Patrician was pure Win!

Yesterday, I bobbed over to Blackpool for the day. Parking the bike was a nightmare. It *should* have been easy. I had a leaflet (obtained&nbsp;from Blackpool Council's website) advising where the motorcycle parking bays were located. Except they weren't&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually&nbsp;I found an off-road area just by the entarnce to the car park. As there were no yellow&nbsp; lines and it wasn't actually in the car park, I figured I wouldn't be contravening any parking restrictions.&nbsp;

Apart from that&nbsp;I had a smashing time. I paddled a little, built sandastles, walked along&nbsp;the Promenade and the piers, had a tram ride and&nbsp;ate Fish n Chips. You know, the usual seaside stuff. &nbsp;When I returned to the bike I..... DIDN'T have a ticket.

Just as I was putting bike in the garage,&nbsp;I got a text off my niece. She'd been in Bradford for the week and was changing trains in Piccadilly on the trip home,&nbsp;so asked if I wanted to meet up and buy her a drink. (She having spent all her money). Well, what is family for if it can't hit you up for an alcholic beverage once in a while? So&nbsp;I said OK. Turned out she hadn't eaten all day either so we went to M&amp;S Food and got sandwiches&nbsp;also. It was nice to see her and just put the icing on a chocolately cake of a day.

Today, I have tidied up.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's not untidy if you know which pile of stuff, stuff can be found in. But&nbsp;it was getting to the point where I didn't know which heap things were in. Also the heaps were beginning to merge and form a meta-heap."

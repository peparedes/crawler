"event","<font size=""4""><strong>okay so, I made a desision, finally..I didnt choose either girls... neither of them.. nada.. and Do I feel any better about making the desision I did? well no I dont. I feel worse... but that isnt going to change anything. not going to change my desision... I've already made it. I cant turn back now can I. Shanell has taken it pretty hard.. and she wants nothing to do with me at the moment. not that I blame her.. I wouldnt blame her if she walked.. yet.. she THINKS Im trying to make her walk ... eh.. whatever.. she can think what ever she wants.. I told beth the next morning about my desision.. and you know what she did? she told me ""danny, I respect your desision, Im not mad and Im not hurt.. a little disapointed.. but nothing more nothing less.. this wont change anything wont change my actions now tomorrow or the next day.. I still love you the same. and youre still my friend"" then? she gave me a big hug and a big kiss... and spent the whole day and evening with me.. talked with me we played video games and hung out.. it was great... I felt a little better *sighs* I dont wish Shanell woulda givin me the same reaction beth did.. I mean eh.. hell I DONT BLAME shanell for reacting the way she did.. I deserved the reaction.. I just havent been able to face anybody.. I havent really been home since it all happenend Ive been in and out.. but.. *looks down* I just feel so rotton.. and I feel so fucking guilty about everything.. somehow I wonder if when shanell decides to talk to me again will I ever BE the same around her... Ive withdrawn myself.. from everything and everyone...have hardly said a word..I've spent alot of my time with the friends that I dropped when I stopped doing the drugs I did.. Ive started drinking.. it makes me feel better for a while you know its not an excuse... but it does. so I do it. they (myfriends) make me forget for a while too.. they make me laugh. so what... I like to laugh.. *shrug* I've.... gotta say... this whole thing.. has changed me.. I am a whole diffrent person... and when I decide to come home for good.. I dont know if I will be the same danny.. Im just .... I feel guilty.. and wrong... heh.. and nobody really knows or.. cares about how this whole situation has affected me.. not that I care.. well I do.. but do they? they dont even know.. who is they you ask? heh.&nbsp; everyone. everyone who is involved in this whole thing.. I think this is it for now.. I just dont know anything else to say.. or have anything else to say on this matter... Im done... I'll be suprised if somebody even reads this....<br /><br />-Danny-</strong></font>"

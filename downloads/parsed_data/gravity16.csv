"event","8 more hours before i leave to KLIA. I havent pack anything yet...even the simplest thing. nyehehe..im just plain lazy. I was very much excited to go back at first but i just hate packing, and the 6 hours of torture(45 mins of journey to the airport,2 hours of lingering around the airport and another 2.5 in the plane and +++). it just sucks. 

Why am i complaining? i am goin home you see. But i just can't avoid this feeling everytime i fly home :s
Anyway, yesterday i went out for more than 12 hours and it was fun fun fun. Woke up early morning for <b>dim sum</b> then went straight to Kota Kemuning Clubhouse for tennis and then sauna and steam bath. Didn't really enjoy though cuz we were rushing for the 1o'clock movie : War Of The Worlds. Its definitely worth watching minus the 'a lil' unperfect ending. Had a great time hanging out with my pals but things would be a little different as Sharon is leaving to Aussie on tuesday. Gonna miss her lotssss..

Alrighty..i think im gonna go get dressed. Im heading to Pyramid soon..to get some stuff for ahem* ( you guys owe me a big one) Anyways, i hope you guys will like the wallet and bags i bought u guys =). See you guys soon..muahsss"

"event","Happy New Year everyone! May it be a good start =) So New Year eve went well.. dinner,movie then countdown. Im totally not excited at all this time. To be exact, i wasnt even happy at all. No idea why. Probably i feel all lonely. There are times when i really wanted a special someone to be by my side. It's just that i havent been able to find the one yet. And yea, im real picky :P But i really wanted something that can last rather than just a fling and of cause..chemistry must be there. 

And darn, did i mention dat im still working? yea, cuz im broke and i needed money so this sunday will be my last. I feel so tired right now and i still gotta wake up early tomoro to get to work. UGGHH..
Im just in this mood where my life seems so colourless. nothing to be excited about. blahhh...

i need more sleep.

New year resolution? looking forward for something better than 2004. It jus didnt work out well."

"event","first and foremost, i wanna give a big hug to 2 of my bestest gurlfrens, <b> chu and cynthea</b> for sending me the Christmas card and the gift. Love you guys so much =) Its such a wonderful surprise and the card is sooo...beautiful. cant wait till we reunite in <b>kk</b> again. we'll have so much fun till no one can tolerant wif our craziness..mwahahaha.  

for the first time this morning i woke up without having to rush to anywhere. yesterday was supposed to be my last day at work but since theres not enuff people working, im working on xmas day. Which will be my official last day in MFM. I started off hating the job so much and i wanted to quit ever since the first few days of working. But Leonard says the most encouraging words that made me stay. And i did, its amazing dat i lasted 6 weeks there. It sux shit at first but as time passes by, i started to get the hang of it. Nothing starts out perfectly. Its the way you handle stuff that leads to perfection. 

9 more days and 2004 will be in the past. I wanna do something memorable..do i make any sense? hahaha..
at least, <b>something</b> dat i'll remember so that 2004 will be more than a history of its own. 

It only makes me stronger
When you say I can't do it
I'll work that bit harder
When you say it's not within my grip
The barriers, I'll break them down
I'll prove myself, I'll stick around
I'll get through it all somehow
Nothing's unreachable

Im so sick of working. Seriously, i havent taken a single break ever since exam. Even during the weekends after church i hafta go back to work again. :S Sigh..there are moments dat i feel like quitin but right now, i really needed extra cash. Its a bit sad when i see most of my frens going back to their respectively hometown and now here i am, still stuck here wit a job dat i dun really like. I guess it's jus hard to fit in being 'the new girl'. Somehow i feel oh-so awkward and being so stupid for making mistakes that i've been told not to do after so many times. Sigh..

1. Stay away from the internet. Internet is addictive...i would spend hours online surfing nothing-
2. Arrange my clothes in ma closet! its oh so messy i cant stand it but im too lazy
3. Sleep less. Can't help it..well, you can never say no to a short nap which always eventually leads      
   to long hours of sleep.
4. Shop less and eat less. Im broke and overspent this month. Die die die..
5. Plan a good time management..my life is upside down now.
6. Study study study!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Okay..so basically above all, the most important thing i should do is to study and sleep less. Internet and sleep is allll dat i should stay away from. So guess there wouldnt be any updates for about erm.. 3 weeks. Gambateh for everyones finals! 

i hate my life..i think it sucks..i want a revival in me..a revolution or something. im pathetic arent i?"

Sometimes, its the person whom you thought care the most is the one who don't even give a shit at all. They're only there to put up some foolish act.

Talking about the new hsemate. They pissed me off. And i think they come from Alaska. They turn on the AC 24/7! Uggghh...it's not even hot in the condo and yet they just waste the electricity leaving it on all the time! Worst part is, we are the ones who's gonna get it at the end of the day. Trust me, when the bills come. It's gonna be RM400 and above. My share..for sure, at least RM100 when i even hardly use the air con. You called that fair?! They're so gonna get it."

Somewhere cosy with dim lights where serenity feels the air..and i would be able to enjoy myself once again and get away wif all the troubles in my head.

"event","Pfft...cant believe i've been here for a month aredi and im goin back to KL tomoro. I am so gonna miss home. Maybe cuz i aredi got used to staying here in my own sweet attic. I loveee my room..its big and it has everything i want. Cool. But guess i have to give it up and go back to my normal hectic uni life.
I want another long holiday~! Can't wait till summer heh. 

I'm a lazy bum..last entry of my journal was umm March? I havent been able to keep a daily journal. I think it's fun to keep a journal cuz at the end of the day i'll be able to read back what i've done and achieve so far, and dat includes the embarassing moments i've been thru =P so i'll be able to laff at myself again and act foolish. Bwahaha..im a certified sucker. I think life is about enjoying ourselves and be happy.
I was just talking to hannah y'day and suddenly she just got so serious and ask me to treasure Brandon...cuz we'll never know what will happen later on. She kinda reminded me of the precious things that i have now..fam,frens n etc. Im glad..that i have all these sweet lovely dovey ppl around muah...We should always cherish what we have and never be jealous of what we don't own. Thats the right way to live life.

Went to steven's corner in OUG lastnite for dinner wif hannah, dree, wenni and rudy to try out the popular bird there. It was umm delicious and yes..i ate a bird. no 2 birds. How <b>cruel</b>. But it was delicious. After dinner we went to cruise around in Bangsar for a while before heading home. It's been a while since i went to cruise at nite wif em. Miss the crazy nightlife..goin down to kl in the middle of the nite and chill out. Being a teen is crazy but fun.

Omg, there's a guy in the comp lab here who actually looks like my bro. I can't stop staring at him i dunno why. I miss <b>him</b>. I actually miss his nuisance. funny.

"event","talked with my mom just a moment ago. I really miss her so so much. Words are never enough to explain how much i need her now. I havent seen her for about 2 months and i really miss home. Someone give me a hug? I told her about me failing maths and she says its okay...never stop trying.She advised me to do more excersises. While i was talking wit my mom..Jervis came and whispered ""who's dat ur talking to?"" i muttered ""my mom"" then he said loudly ""HI Auntie!"". Funny guy...he made me laugh. 

Im a bit nervous bout my presentation on monday. I'm worried about how am i gonna refute on the topic human cloning. It's not as easy as i thought at first.
Yuke lose her cell phone y'day when she was in KLCC. Poor her..this is the 3rd time already. A month ago, she just lost her samsung; the one wif the built in camera.
Moral lesson : never lend your phone to a stranger no matter what.
Thats what happened to her. A taiwanese guy approached her telling her that he needed to borrow a phone to call and to convince her, he gave him his cell phone to hold a lil while for assurance. Within a minute, he ran off.

Im on friendster. Are you?

And so..i've got 3 hours break today so me Calvin and Yuke went to Pyramid to catch a movie. We wanted to watch the missing but it's not showing yet so we ended up watching Cabin Fever. The movie was okay but it was pretty disgusting wif blood all over..yucky..

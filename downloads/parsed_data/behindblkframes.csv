"event","in visions of the dark night
i have dreamed of joy departed
but a waking dream of life and light 
hath left me broken hearted

ah! what is not a dream by day
to him whose eyes are cast
on things around him with a ray
turned back upon the past?

that holy dream - that holy dream
while all the world were chiding
hath cheered me as a lovely beam
a lonely spirit guiding

what though that light, thro' sotrm and night
so trembled from afar
what could there be more purely bright
in thruths day star?



i was reading through my edgar alan poe book and i found that one. i like it a lot. in some ways i can see myself in it. i kind of take it as dreaming of all the things you want but waking up and realizing you dont have them. its a good one. well, thats it for now. thought that was a thought provoking entry. i hope you all are well.

"event","whoa. just got back from homecoming. it was rad as hell. heres the whole scoop.

today around 11 i went to the flower shop and picked up the rose and corsage i got for cynthia. they turned out really awesome and i was super pleased with them. then i went home and got on the computer. i starteed talking to cliff and i started slowly to prepare for the dance. i think i got ready in a span of three or four hours. at one point, i called cynthia and told her we were on our way to pick her up. the only thing was it was 3:30. she freaked and i told her it was a joke. it was sweet. then i finished up getting ready and mom came over and we all got in the car to pick up cynthia. 

when we got to cynthias, i walked up to the door and i was nervous as hell. lol. when her mom opened the door i had the shakes. her parents greeted me and we talked for a couple seconds then cynthia came around the corner. i was like whoa. she looked sooooooo beautiful. this didnt help the nerves much because i started getting the shakes. i think it was obvious while i was trying to get the corsage out of the container. her parents took a bunch of pictures then we went to cliffs. when cliff got back from picking up his date we hit the road for the restaraunt.

dinner was good. it was a fun group and the food was good. cynthia got this huge platter that she was expecting to be a helluva lot smaller than it was and she couldnt eat a bunch of it. so she put it ina box complete with the little sauce cups, and we left without it. we got to cliffs moms car and we were like, what happened to the food. we didnt go back in because we were already to the car. oh well. 

when we got to the dance we waited in line for a while and got in and took pictures. the guy that took ours was super cool and took cynthias pics last time. after that we went and hung around and got our groove things on. it was super cool. 

just overall, the night was awesome. i had been waiting for it since i asked her and it was all i hoped for and then some. im sure i had the prettiest date there. super cool night. well, im tired and i need to sleep. i love you all.

"event","woo hoo! today was a half day and it was pretty cool. after school i went to jack in the box and grabbed lunch. then i went to cassie's bday party after getting lost on the way there. now im here at home getting ready to go to the football game. tomorrow is the dance. im super stoked about it. i cant wait for it. 

lately things have been on the up, but when im alone, i kinda get bummed. i dont know why. i busted out the old dashboard cd's. but thats not the cause. im not too sure what it is. i just wished it would stop. at school im totally fine, but at home by myself i get all moody. maybe its because im stressed out. school and hoping the dance tomorrow goes without a hitch. that could be it right there. nerves. whatever it is, im ready for it to be gone. 

thats it for now. peace.

"event","whoa. i havent written in this joint in a long ass time.  since the last entry things have been goin pretty darn good.  i went into a world of difference training and that was rad.  the people there are really cool and its just an overall positive thing to do.  then theres me turning 16.  i had this little fiesta shindig on saturday with my family and then on sunday cliff, cynthia, vina, and rick dick came over and we watched you got served and soul plane.  it was the most awesome birthday ive had.  i wasnt all bummed out like i have the past couple years.  the whole 9/11 thing is a drag on such a great day.  and theres the impending drivers test on wednesday.  then to top the week off is homecoming.  kickass.  im so stoked for it.  i got my tie this weekend and its kickass.  man.  

seems like the past couple weeks have been falling into place nicely.  things have been working out.  its an awesome feeling.  hopefully things keep goin on the uppity-up.  ill keep my fingers crossed.  well, time to go study for the chem test tomorrow.  yuck.  peace.

I found this headstone and thought, ""wow, this was someone who was kind of brave to go into the line of work he did with the last name he had.""

And when I was doing some clips tonight for <a href=""http://www.dailywav.com"" target=""_blank"">TDW</a>, I went to IMDB to double-check that it was Ellen Greene on <i>Heroes</i>. Looking at the comments on her IMDB page, there was a reference to an appearance she did on the <i>Tonight Show</i>. And when I looked at the clip (embedded below) I immediately thought of one person who a) probably never watched the old Johnny Carson days on the <i>Tonight Show</i> and b) would have a total hard-on over this performance: <lj user=""paladincub21""> (jump to 5:37 to hear her sing <i>Suddenly Semour</i> from <i>Little Shop Of Horrors</i>

"event","I spent the summer of 1981 gallivanting across the UK (with a brief jaunt over to the Dublin area. I was in Ireland the summer before for a longer trip.). While I'd seen BBC shows rebroadcast over on Public Television, I'd never really seen it ""live"". I was fascinated by the fact that the shows, well at least on BBC, had no commercials during them. They had a block of time between the shows for the commercials (but I do believe that ITV/Granada ran them during the shows like here in the US). And why would anyone want to sit through some block of advertising? Because they raised this form of advertising into an art form of their own. European commercials just seem to be so much more creative than most of the ones here in the US.

So something jarred my memory about all this tonight and I went searching YouTube for one that stuck in my mind from back then. It just had this British snobbery tied in with the early 80s preppy scene feel to it. I still find this one funny.

"event","Since it's been a hell week, we decided to go out to see a movie in the theatres for the first time in probably a year. See, it's not that we don't like movies, anyone who's seen our DVD collection can tell you different :) It's just that we can't really justify the cost of it, especially when having to deal with screaming kids, people who can't shut up, phones ringing/texting, etc.

So because I had an interest in seeing THE WATCHMEN, Tony decided to treat me to the film to help take my mind off the layoff. Both of us felt the same way about the film: meh.

Sure some of the effects were good but overall it was certainly not worth the $40 we spent to see it. Yep, $40 for 2 tickets, a small popcorn, a soda, and a bottle of water. This got us painful overacting, a film that could've had an hour edited out of it and been the same movie, some clever (but also some overused) musical cliches, and a story that was really nothing new.

And, yes, I read the graphic novel back in the 80s when it came out. If you haven't seen the film yet, I'd advise you to wait till it comes out on DVD - you'll get a far better value for your money."

You exhibit a very well-developed sense of Right and Wrong and believe in economic fairness. 

Explanation Of Results

We wanted to get beyond the two catch-alls of American politics, the Democratic and Republican parties, and see where people actually stand. Parties can bring together people with marginally differing values and make collective action easier. But party platforms can misrepresent their constituents, and blind loyalty to a party can convince individuals to harbor inconsistent views.

The goal of this test was to exactly classify your personal politics, without the traditional labels. We avoided the edgy party issues and focused on fundamental values. Your score is a measure of what you believe in, economically and socially.

Higher permissiveness, on either axis, indicates a ""live and let live"" philosophy. Of course, we're almost conditioned in America, ""Land of the Free"", to think positively of such a philosophy. But practically speaking, permissiviness (or its opposite, regulation) can create any number of outcomes:

For example, on the economic axis, a highly permissive system, like the American system of the early 1900s, might mean things like low taxes and increased scientific innovation. It might also result, as it did back then, in unrestricted child labor and millions of poor people with black lung.

At the other end of the economic spectrum, a highly regulated system might conserve the environment, establish national health care, and eliminate poverty. But as we've learned from the Soviet system, extreme regulation can also lead to stagnation, sameness, and unhappiness.

"event","Tony and I basically did 2 things this weekend: stimulate the economy and play XBox. 

Our phone contracts had been up for a while and we were both hemming and hawing about what to do. I had looked at the AT&T Tilt for quite a while (as it was the most-current version of the phone I currently have, the 8125) and Tony had been talking about the iPhone for a long time. We'd gone to the store, looked on line, etc. The one day were were going to get Tony an iPhone, they hadn't been sent to our store yet.

Flash-forward a month or so; I got a letter from AT&T in the mail this week saying they were going to finally kill off the plan I was on (last time I got a new phone, I just kept the old plan as what was offered was more expensive, so it was originated at least 4 years ago). The letter said they were going to start charging me $10 more a month (and I already pay about $170). So, off to the store to be indecisive again.

Of course, when we got in there, I asked about the iPhone for Tony as he didn't want to ask because they were surely out of them still... you know, like Wiis. We were both shocked to find out they had his 16gb iPhone in stock. Hmm time to go over the plans. I complained that we'd not upgraded for a while because the iPhone couldn't be put on my Family Talk plan. The sales lady looked at as and said, ""Huh? Of course it can be put on a family plan."" All-in-all, we each got our new phones and my monthly costs are actually going to go down a bit; not much, but about $10 less a month.

Our sleep schedules are waaaaay off because we've both been playing ""Too Human"" on the Xbox - fun game; fairly addictive. Thank god you get reborn a lot; I get killed often :("

It finally arrived today. Yay! I'm very happy. Not so much so because it has Illustrator and Photoshop (since I'm a Corel guy and use Draw and Photo-Paint), but it does have the current versions of Dreamweaver, Fireworks, Flash, and Acrobat Pro 8. Yeah, I know CS4 is coming out in a few months... now if only this had a ""real"" serial number instead of a ""promotional/educational"" serial number so I can upgrade cheaply when CS4 comes out :)

How long would YOU take to do the following: 
Create a new mySQL (or MSSQL/Oracle/PostGRES) database with 14 tables holding info for things like usernames, useraccess levels, bus routes (fully populated), train routes (fully populated), park-ride lots (fully populated), public hearing dates/locations, potential route changes for bus and rail (including projected time like Spring 2010, etc, affected routes, details of the change); 38 administrative pages to control said data (add/delete/update/list pages) with (so far) 12 rich-text editor fields, and a number of pages for the public, say 5 at the current count) dynamically driven from said database.

This is what I've done in the past 2 ~ 2.5 days. This project has more to come; more db tables, a lot more admin pages (including image and file uploads), etc.

Remember: 1 person to do this. If you're a consultant, what would you charge for this type of work (whether by project or hour, preferably by hour)? How long would you spec out to do this? Would you use more than one person for this (and if so, how many people?)

Comments ASAP would be appreciated as I'd like some ammo for tomorrow morning's meeting :)"

"event","... keeps the old folks away. Well, at least that's what <lj user=""cubziz""> and I thought today.

We wound up at Macaroni Grill for lunch today and there did seem to be a larger than normal amount of old folks in the restaurant. (yes, I know that this is somewhat hypocritical of me to say, seeing that I'll be 50 in 2 years... you damn kids, get off my digital lawn!) This older couple behind Cubziz started commenting to our server that ""wow, they put pepper in everything here, don't they? It's so spicy!""

Um, regular pepper isn't that spicy. Lady, you were having the Italian Wedding soup. I had the same thing - if anything, the soup was on the too-salty side. This older couple left fairly quickly (being sure to use their coupons). Far quicker than one would expect - I guess they just couldn't handle <i>normal seasoning</i>.

We had originally planned dinner at the house tonite, but life happens and we wound up going to the South City Diner. And what is it with today? It was like an old folks home's bus had ejected all these people in to South St. Louis for dinner. Two couples wound up sitting behind me (and note to everyone: balding men over 65, if not even over 35, should not wear ponytails - this is not Southern California) and this lady started asking about the pot roast - was it spicy? Um, it's <i>pot roast</i>. It's not some damn habanero-stuffed olive loaf or something. What is it with these older folks in St. Louis who think salt and pepper are exotic spices? 

OK, granted, starting in high school or a bit earlier, one of my cousins bought a rice mill/spice company in Louisiana and we started putting <a href=""http://www.conradricemill.com/Details.asp?ProdID=49&category=6"" target=""_blank"">this</a> on all our grilled chicken, etc. And I don't use it now as much as I used to (Cubziz likes <a href=""http://www.conradricemill.com/Details.asp?ProdID=92&category=6"" target=""_blank"">this spice</a> more these days), but I always thought older folks liked spicier and sweeter stuff as their taste buds died off.

"event","This is sort of an open call to any/all of you Corel Graphics people out there. 

If any of you are serious about doing more/doing better with your chosen Graphics Suite, there is really no better place to do this than a User Conference. I went to my first Corel user conference (at that time it was CorelWorld run by Rick Altman) probably about 8 years ago. It was a lot of fun, and I think for me the one shining moment was working with someone in their ""help desk"" area who showed me more about Photo-Paint in 5 minutes than I thought was possible. That more than made up for the conference fee, believe me.

I've gone to two other CorelWorlds since then and had a lot of fun and learned a lot at both. This last one, however, (last year's event) was the last one that Rick chose to hold. He was really wanting to focus more on his PowerPoint conferences.

This year, a friend and very knowledgeable guy, Foster Coburn, is holding a brand new Corel User Conference called <a href=""http://www.coreldrawunleashed.com/conference/"" target=""_blank"">CorelDRAW Unleashed User Conference</a>. Foster runs his own set of boot camp training courses for Draw/Photo-Paint, so it was a natural that he'd try to start a new conference.

If you're a Corel Draw or Photo-Paint user (like myself), you owe it to yourself to try and go to the conference. <a href=""http://www.coreldrawunleashed.com/conference/whoshouldattend.asp"" target=""_blank"">Who should attend</a>? Well, there's really something for everyone from web designers, print designers, screen printers, sign makers, etc. I know that some will balk at the conference price. But frankly, compared to other conferences in the Graphics or IT field, it really is a bargain. (I've personally had to go to conferences that were almost twice as much for only a single day)

So please visit <a href=""http://www.unleash.com/"" target=""_blank"">Foster's site</a> for graphics tips/tricks, check out the <a href=""http://www.coreldrawunleashed.com/conference/schedule.asp"" target=""_blank"">Conference Schedule</a>, and I hope to see you all there because, yes, I am a presenter at the Conference :)"

I had made a comment that 18 staples was nothing and that I had had over 100 staples in my leg at one time. This person and others wanted to see pics of my leg before the skin graft. I had told them it was pretty gross, but they were interested. So, this is definitely behind a cut. It's hard to believe that this was about 2.5 years ago. It doesn't feel that long of a time.

Hmm, my first name is the 1580th most popular first name in the US and my last name is the 192nd most popular last name.

Frankly I'm surprised there are 7 of me... I thought there were only 3."

"event","As I've grown older, presents for birthdays and Christmas are just kind of there for me. I mean, sure everyone likes to get presents, but it really doesn't matter to me whether I get big presents, little presents, or even no presents. It's cliche', but the thought does count more than the actual gift.

That said, Tony surprised me yesterday with a belated Christmas/birthday present: an Amazon Kindle.

When I first heard about the Kindle a while back, eh, I can't say I was that enthused about it. I mean, yeah, I like the portability of e-books and they certainly do reduce the clutter (I read a fair amount and have a lot of paperbacks around the house)... but I already had an e-book reader on my cellphone. And sure, the Kindle can get blog updates, but you have to pay to have them delivered to the device.

Well, actually having one of the devices in-hand, I quickly changed my mind. This is a pretty cool toy. Is it perfect? Nah, of course not. It's a 1.0 device. But it's a pretty well-done 1.0 device. Will I use it for blogs? Nope, but for me that's not an important feature so it doesn't really matter if Amazon charges for blog downloads.

But as an e-book reader, the type is very clear to read (and you can change font size), you can put in an SD card for storage of more books, and it doesn't matter if I'm at my computer or not if I want a new book - it will wirelessly connect to Amazon's site and you can browse books and purchase them and have it delivered to the device in just a few minutes. Or, I don't even have to have the device with me - I can go to Amazon's site, buy a book, and it will be sent to the Kindle automatically... and if I lose/break the Kindle, all my book purchases are still in my library at Amazon and I can just re-download them later on.

And today as I was getting books, it was nice to be able to see that an author I like to read had a new book out. Normally, I'd go and spend the $25 or so for the new hardback book. But when I can get new releases for $10 without having to wait a year for a paperback? Yay, I'm in escapist reading pleasure zone!

Of course, I now have one more toy to keep me distracted from doing things I should actually be doing instead of reading :)"

"event","Tony and I have started working out again. Today I saw something that just strikes me as quite an oxymoron. In the area where the elliptical/treadmill/bikes are, some of the units have TV screens built-in to them. That's kind of cool, actually. What was odd was this thin younger woman working out on an elliptical machine ... while watching <em>Top Chef</em>. Don't get me wrong, I love the show... but I just can't see people watching cooking shows while working out :)"

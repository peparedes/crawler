"event","Why doesn't anyone want to hire me?  I mean what is the deal here?  This is really pissing me off.  So yeah, I've pretty much given up on Cracker Barrell, I can't wait around when I should have been working like...oh over a week ago!  I am at a loss...I have no idea where to go now.  I went to a couple movie theaters, and one wasn't hiring.  I do have an interview on wed, but still...I'm not expecting anything the way things have been going for me.  Anyone got any ideas as to where I can go to look for a job.  Like out of the ordinary places that are good to work at??  GRR!!!

Ya know, I don't have anything else to talk about, just the fact that I can't find a job.  OH OH!!  Saturday night!  Me and Nate went to the Melting Pot, it was so good!  Highly recomend it, but for a special occasion because its expensive.  But if you don't want to pay that much, go just for desert.  But you should go!

I think I am going to Memphis w/ Nate this weekend...and I get to meet more of his family.  I'm not used to this family stuff, I mean my family doesn't get along, I'm not used to being around families that do get along!  It's odd to me.  Yeah I know, that's the way it should be, tell my extended family this!  Like holidays for us, its me and my parents, and thats how we like it!"

"event","So I didn't get up till 1pm...which is good, very good.  But as soon as I get up, maintnence comes to fix the smoke detector, which one of my past roomates' boyfriend broke!  BTW I'm still rather mad about that.  Anyway, so they fixed the one in the living room and they go to check the others...come to find out, mine has never worked, like the one in my bedroom!  The wires were cut underneath it and obviously no one checked it before I moved in back in August.  Now what if something had happened?  I could so like sue the school or something!  I mean, how am I supposed to know the wires were cut in it?  Hmm????  Stupid belmont!  Oh and the maintence guys are rather gross, like older guys and we're here in our pjs still.  YUCK!  

So me and Nate are going to The Melting Pot tonight.  It should be fun, I bought a new dress and he's gonna wear a coat and tie (oh yeah...he's gonna look hot!).  I'm so excited!

So I realized, I get to move out in 2 weeks from today.  How excited am I?  Very!  I just want to live by myself so badly.  I think it would be much better for me.  I don't like rooming w/ anyone cuz I'm too freakin picky, but OH WELL!  

Ok I need to get up and do something since maintnece is gone and I have much to do."

"event","I am so freakin bored its not even funny!  I mean, I have no job, only one real class, and my boyfriend is at his apartment, I think eating at the moment.  He has things to practice, and stuff to do.  Sure, we are going to the Matchbox Twenty concert tonight, but it doesn't start till 7pm, and American Hi-Fi and Sugar Ray are before them, so it'll be awhile before they come on.  I don't care about the first two, I just wanna see MB20!  

So this job, don't think its gonna happen.  I mean ok, they don't have their crap together and I'm sick of it!  So tired of it.  And I've found out from someone who used to work there that its not too good to work out.  Mostly just if you are a server cuz you don't make anything, but I was gonna host, and even then, if its not busy, I won't get very many hours and whats the use in that this summer.  I mean by the time I find a job, summer will be over!  So the way I see it, I should just forget it, take more summer classes and consentrate on getting an internship for fall, and an oncampus job.  But we'll see, that requires more money, and thats not something I have, well, I had a loan and...oh I'll just have to see!

Its closer to time to move, oh I can't wait, seriously!  I want to get out of this trash so bad!  Its horible, I mean, yuck, I hate this apartment now!  And have I mentioned I hate having a roomate?  

And I'm rather agrivated at mtv, because they suck.  Just thought I'd throw that out because I haven't in a while."

"event","I won something off the radio for the first time today!  I won tickets to go to a concert one of the local radio stations is putting on, that you have to win tickets to go to.  Its some acoustic christmas in july thingy w/ Mercy Me.  Don't know many of their songs, only know 2 in fact, but Nate likes them and so thats really the reason I tried to win the tickets, because I knew he'd like to go.  So I won them this evening, and I'm sure I sounded like a total nerd on the air, but oh well, it was cool to me!

But I am really tired now, I spent the evening watching season 4 of Buffy on DVD and studying for a test I have on Monday.  How pathetic am I?  I mean I spent the majority of my Friday night doing homework.  Dang thats sad."

"event","So I just drove through this bad storm and I was scared as crap.  The radio wasn't saying anything about it, if it had tornados or what and Nathan was at work so I couldn't call him to see what the TV said, and I had no one else to call.  This sucks that I don't have anyone else here in Nashville to call about something like that...because its not SUPPOSED to be this way.  And I won't say what I mean by that, if anyone reads this you might be able to tell.  Yeah I'm slighly pissed...irritated, look at the mood.  Not only about that but this whole job thing, I was out looking for a job when this hit and I can't find crap, my only option now is to go to a Craker Barrel cuz Nate said they give hosts 7.00.  Among other things I'd rather not discuss.  

Yesterday was the first day of Water Ski class, I am so sore!  But I got up on one ski so I'm happy about that.  Its a good sore."

"event","So summer classes start tomorrow, oh yeah, there is so much excitement here, can't you tell?  Not really in the mood to get up at 8:30am M-F but oh well, this will keep me from being here a year longer than I already have to be.  Let me tell you, I am not happy about being on the 6 or 7 year plan.  

I didn't work Fan Fair today, they didn't need me, not even tonight, and boy am I pissed I wasn't there tonight cuz Wynonna was performing and her mom, Naomi, supposivly got up and sang some with her tonight.  Do you know how big of a Judds fan I was when I was little?  Like huge, I mean I had a record, yes a RECORD! And I would listen to it, and those are like some of the first songs I remember singing and that influenced me to want to be a country singer, which by the way, I so don't want that anymore.  But yeah, someone from CMA said they'd call if they needed me tonight, and they didn't call...yeah right they didn't need extra help.  Ok, yes I could have gone, I had a ticket, but I didn't want to go sit alone!  GRR!!!  I'm not a fan of Fan Fair at this point.  For one, I don't really like country music all that much, yes there is some I like but I don't know who half the people are, how can that possibly be fun?  And sitting around being bored a good bit of the time sucks too.  UGH!  I just wish I had more to do there, I like to stay busy.  

Went bowling last night and I broke 100!  In fact I got 120 my first game!  Can you believe that?  Yeah but then Nate kicked my butt the next game to make up for it and I only got a 60.  Oh and I won the first game.  But dude, the ball was heavier than I'm used to, cuz they didn't have anything smaller, which sucked bootay.  

I should sleep...I have to get up and go to class...ugh, no more summer vacations ever again, I don't like that idea!  :("

"event","Hi, I'm really tired.  I've been at Fan Fair this weekend, working.  Yet, I don't feel like I did much work.  Especially today, because the majority of the time I sat at Riverfront and watched a bunch of artists I have no clue who they are.  Oh, I knew who Aaron Lines, Kelly Coffey, and thats it, before today.  I mean, its been, the not-so-big people I think there on that stage, well with the exception of a few, like Kenny Chesny.  Now that was funny, because there were some people who had been there since like 2am to see him at 10am.  And the girls who were wearing white tank tops in the rain to see Emerson Drive, so country fans are crazier than I thought.  But one bad thing about not knowing who lots of these people are, is that I live in freaking Nashville now, country music capital of the world.  I feel like before I can get a job at some place that deals mostly in the country genre that I must know more about the music.  I mean the majority of stuff here is either country or christian music, two genres I don't know very much about.  And how am I possibly going to get all high up in ranks in genres I don't know very much about!  This could pose a problem for me.

I am very hungry, and we can't decide where to go eat.  All I know is that I don't want Chinese or Seafood.  Those are my requests.  Other than that I don't really care as long as I get to eat something today, and like, soon.  I have eaten today, just not since like noon and its 6:30 now!"

"event","So, I've decided to open a journal again.  I like livejournals, they all look so good, yet mine doesn't look as good as I would like at this point.  But I don't feel like doing anymore updating to it tonight.  I am going to work on my website...the domain...in a little bit.  I want to get it back up and going asap!

In other news, I hate searching for jobs!  I can't seem to find one anywhere.  No where is hiring, no where I'd be willing to work that is.  UGH!

Tomorrow starts Fan Fair, and I have to be there at 7:30AM, now I don't like that.  I mean, yeah I get to go for free, but I'm working it and I gotta be on my feet in the sun...ok I gotta keep telling myself this will be a good thing, good for my future, to meet people in the business and see more of what goes on behind the scenes.  

And I'm watching this Celine Dion special on TV and now I want to go to Vegas and see it, cuz hello, she's awesome!  

Now I must eat and work on the domain before Nate gets off work...oh yeah if you see that pic up there, thats us back in Jan when it snowed so much here."

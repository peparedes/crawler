Okay well ..
today i woke up at 6 10.. went to veronica's.Then me and her and sammie all got ready for school. and i didnt have my sandels cuz the ones i wanted to wear were in my locker for school. So i had to wake to school with toe socks on*we all wore then for some reason* and then i relized i forgot my back pack..even though its a half day and we got out at 11. and i had my cell phone with me.. and i called my mom.. and she brought it down. Then i was walking to homeroom.. at like 759.. right before school started and i saw jessie. And she didnt make the softball team.WHICH IS SHIT BECAUSE SHE HAS PLAYED CLUB FOR FUCKIN 10 YEARS! STUPIC FUCKIN NEW TEACHER THAT ARE FUCKIN COACHING! God i felt sooo bad for her!and then we all went to veronicas.. walked to jessies.And then went to brothers and the mall..it was soo gay! 
and we saw justin there =)! haha but he was with some nasty ass chick..uh. it was grose.
and we were all laughing at him and he got all mad at me.
and now kyle is being gay AGAIN!

then i had to go to practice.. got nailed in the face because the stupid fat girl thats not even on the team practice with us and she didnt get out of my way toblock a ball.. and it hit my braces which are glass and cut my fuckin lip and i started bleedin. 

uh today just isnt my day. =("

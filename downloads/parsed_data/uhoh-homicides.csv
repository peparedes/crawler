"event","<p align=""left""><font size=""1"">i need to get away. sometimes i want to forever. after i take my trip to portland, if i like it &nbsp;i'm highly considering moving down there after i finish school. i LOVVVE seattle, and it breaks my heart to think about not calling it home, but i'm so tired of all the assholes that live here, and i feel like all my relationships with people here are falling apart. i'm trying to keep them together but i'm not feeling any effort on the other end. even though some of them i'd rather have over. i've realized there's people i never should have trusted, or considered my friend. but that aside, moving would give me a fresh start&nbsp;and a new atmosphere and just forget about all the stress that's&nbsp;accumulated inside my head in seattle. i've heard portland is a lot like seattle so i shouldn't get too homesick.&nbsp;&nbsp;:) i'm excited to go there.</font></p><p align=""center""><img height=""267"" alt="""" width=""400"" border=""1"" src=""http://www.courtesyinnmotel.com/images/portlandSkyline.jpg"" /><br /><br /><img height=""311"" alt="""" width=""400"" border=""1"" src=""http://traveldk.com/dkimages/0-seattle_master.jpg"" /><br /><br /><font size=""1"">look quite a bit alike, yeah?</font></p>"

"event","I swear to God (or Big Baby Jesus) this song is something else!  Bringing together these different elements and mixing them into a musical goulash of epic proportions!  I like it, I dare say that I love it!  

You don't know if an apple's rotten until you take a bite.  I'm apparently writing along with the songs that I'm listening to.  This should be interesteing.  This song is called the World is Full of Bastards (And I've dated every one).  You don't knoe if your peace of mind is just a piece of ass.  

Now it's CCR, run through the jungle.  I've never actually run through a jungle at least not in the ""African Safari"" sense.  I remember onece when I was on a school trip to Australia, we were staying at a beach front resort and there was a bit of thick foliage between our suites and the beach.  We played tag in that ""jungle"" for a couple of hours.  I secretly slipped down there later that night, walked out on the rickety old dock and lay with my legs hung over the edge just looking at all the stars.  It was pretty Amazing!

Bullseye!  I once rescued a complete compendium of Edgar Allen Poe's writings from a transfer station in the dead of winter.  It was a very thick book that I apparently could NEVER remember to take out of my car.  So it stayed there all winter and managed to get severely water damaged.  That summer I was driving around with Dustin Gridley and I think Meg D.  She said she'd never shot a gun so we took her shooting.  We shot the book and the bullet made it all the way to Pit and the Pendulum.

She gives me the finger because she knows I'm wrapped around it.  Damn...  With a line like that and a life like mine, it's terrifyingly difficult to think of just one 3 minute anecdote.  Bowling for soup put out a whole CD of break up songs.  And they all sound the same.   It's really sad because for my birthday my brother got me a T-Shirt that had been signed by the band.  I bought the CD because I refused to Be proud of the shirt until I'd actually heard the band.  I've never worn the shirt, but It's still safe.  Thanks Daniel, it WAS really cool.  I just don't like the band.

Oooo!!!  A humorous Irish song about murdering an entire family!  Drowned her father.  Poisoned her mother.  Set her Sister's hair on fire and danced around playing a violin.  Threw her brother in a lake.  Cut her Baby brother in two, served him up in an Irish stew (and invited the neighbors in).  Wouldn't lie about it though, because lying is a sin!

Aaaahhh!!!  Super Rad!  The video for this song involves the members of the band fighting giant monsters a la godzilla!  It was so cool, but at the time MTV had a show where they would air several videos and let people vote which would go into circulation.  All the losers would be trown out and never seen on MTV ever again.  Sad to say, that video got canned and I've not seen it since that first time.  Sometimes I hate MTV...  Music television?  Someone should remind them of that.  I swear to god that if I see another episode of Road Rules/Real World Challenge I will KILL them!

The Ren and Stimpy CD was the coolest thing to own when I bought it!  But I quickly discovered that it only had 5 songs that I liked (incl. The Log Song and Happy Happy, Joy Joy).  But I dug the CD up a few years later and realized all the other songs on the CD were actually REALLY good jazz!  Yeah, no shit, the CD is an incredibly Jazz CD with occasional interruptions by a stoopid cat and an over confidant little dog.  You'd thing a song called ""Nose Goblins"" would be silly but NO!  It's just...  GREAT!  I'm lucky that CD survived!

The Propellerheads failed me with their CD...  I fell in love with ""History Repeating"" feat. Shirley Bassey but the rest of the CD was a bunch of techno stuff...  Don't get me wrong, me and techno are cool with each other, but I only appreciate it for Dancing, I can't just sit and listen to it (unless maybe I'm cleaning house or cooking).  But these were definitely songs that needed a crowd because they were pretty horribly repetetive.  So, rememer, if you decide to create some techno music...  DON'T MAKE IT TOO REPETETIVE!  

The old black rum.  I don't approach people at Bars.  No amount of Liquid courage can force me to do it.  (Some have seen me ""in action"" at abar, but that was in a party setting so it doesn't count.)  I go to bars to dance...  That's one of the Reasons I hate that tool DJ Johan, he's a shitty DJ if you are in the mood to dance.  Anyway, I get sweaty when I dance...  And when I get sweaty, I just don't feel confidant enough to approach someone.

I love covers!  I discovered this as I lay on the floor of the KSUA office making out with a cute redhead named Jo(hanna).  You see as we were making out on the floor, my friend, Brandon, played A punk cover of Seasons in the Sun.  Though I was really enjoying making out with Jo, I couldn't help but break away every coupla lines to sing along.  Brandon found this hilarious (and I'm laughing at the thought myself) but Jo was none too pleased.  Summer Fine Arts camp was fun!  A few years later I was invited to be her prom date (though she lived in Anchorage).  I made the dumb mistake of being an idiot for most of the trip and something that my friends and I thought would go over really well, failed miserably.  You see...  We were all at Denny's the night before I left and we all decided that I should take some letters of recommendation to her.  These letters would recommend my sexual prowess.  Each friend wrote a letter.  Two were from girls (who I'd previously had liasons with) and were actually quite nice letters, If I were to ever actually try the ploy again, I'd use those letters as good examples.  The rest, from my male friends, were hilarious (at the time) and involved a few jokes that we still reference today.  The problem was that they were not for someone not expecting our brand of humor.  One was written as if by someone very similar to Elmo from Sesame street.  The other involved something  to the degree of ""I love it when he vibrates my anus with his nose.""  Yeah, reading that now, I realise that the best idea was to NOT present these letters to her.  So Jo, if you ever read this, I apologize for that whole weekend from beginning until when you got home from your night out and we talked before you went to bed.  I'm not sure if I'd apologized for that before, but even if I did, Jo, you get it again.  Sorry!

Hehehe...  How fitting!  Weezer has just popped up with a song called ""Pardon Me.""  So, who else do I want to apologize to?  Jess Pena (Pron. Penya), I'm sorry I cheated on you.  I just want it to be known that Jess was the only girl I ever cheated on.  Meg D. I didn't cheat on you, even if I hadn't been a prick about that Christmas break, I still wouldn't have cheated on you.  I spent two months with Heather M. working on 6 Degrees of Separation, but there was never anything between us.  The Heather that I was hung up on was Heather W. (Mentioned previously and the one I'd cheated on Jess with) who wasn't even in my life while Meg D. and I were together.  So Meg, I'm very sorry for that whole big lump of shit that I put you through, and I'm glad you still talk to me (though we rarely get a chance to talk much).  Sorry Meghan.

I guess that last paragraph might seem a little muddled for thems that don't know the history, but suffice it to say, I'm sorry for being esoteric.

She doesn't care, whether or not he's and Island.  I can't imagine wanting to own an Italian leather Sofa, or any sort of leather sofa for that matter.  I don't like the prospect of sticking to my couch.  It just doesn't appeal.  Healthy breasts on the other hand, I do appreciate those, though I guess I'm more of an ass man.  Damn you Kelli, you made me an ass man.  Hehehe, she always complained that she had ""tube sock"" breasts.  Honestly, she kinda had tube sock breasts...  But what an ass!  God!  What an ASS indeed!  I'm being a total ass at the moment!  *Reigns himself in and weathers the storm until a less inflammatory thought inducing song comes on*

Student Loans!  So, I paid tuition this week which means I've returned to debt after a brief respite.  I don't have student loans.  I'm not going to have to pay them off because I've been extremely lucky.  

Friendship Test.  This afternoon I watched Strange Bedfellows, a GREAT Australian movie with Paul Hogan (Croc Dundee) and the guy from the Castle (The Australian Castle, FAR better than the American Castle).  It's about two friends that agree to say their gay so that one friend can take advantage of tax relief laws for same-sex couples.  I laughed a lot and almost cried at one point, No shit!  I tell you what, seeing Crocodile Dundee in psychedelic short shorts and a tiny little tank top is HILARIOUS!  It had a great message and made me wish we had a gay club here (because they'd never put up with a shitty DJ like Johan!).  

The Good Book Song.  Tonight on the Colbert report, Stephen Colbert had a guest who had some things to say for evolution and against Intelligent design.  And yeah...  You should watch it!

Scotland the Brave.  I've been reading one of the Sharpe books (Note to Reader look up Sharpe, Bernard Cornwell).  It's Sharpe's Waterloo and it's about a British rifleman serving under the Duke of Wellington against Napoleon.  Anyways, Wellington (Irish born, much to his chagrin, look it up) was a huge fan of the Scottish troops so they appear frequently in books which involve the duke.  But can you blame him?  The Scottish troops were Bad-Ass Mother Fuckers (I'm willing to believe Samuel L. Jackon's a little scottish).  Yeah.  Next song!

The problem with System of a Down is that it is sometimes difficult to understand their lyrics.  Much like, as I assume anyone who has managed to read up to this point will agree, this post.  Reading something this disjointed can't be good for the brain!  So, you should stop reading, but, so you can feel as though you finished, I'll end the post soon.  See, cooperation, the world is a much better place with it.  So, goodnight all!"

"event","I'm no Superman.  I think that's a good statement for two reasons: first, I'm watching Scrubs and second, there is a small cadre of girls that have harboured a slight superman fetish for me.

SCRUBS!  I really like this show...  There are some things that you watch or read or hear that just make you happy.  Scrubs is one of them.  A perfect Circle's ""The Nurse who loved me.""  Johnny Cash singing ""The Man Comes Around"" at the beginning of Dawn of the Dead (remake).  Certain Episodes of Spaced (the greatest show on Earth which you can only get on region 2 DVD).  The very Last episode of the Office (Brit Version) where everyone gets what they deserve.  Reading Wilfred Owen's ""Dulce et Decorum est..."" (Note to Reader: Look up this poem) out loud to no one but myself (a depressing piece, but there is something strangely nice about reading it out loud...  Try it!).  Oh!  I like ""Peace in the Valley"" by A3, that makes me feel good too.  And ""Aenima"" by TOOL (Maynard is the man).  And System of a Down's ""Chop Suey!""  Now I guess I also have to mention Greg Brown, he has a bunch of songs that make me happy, but the one that comes to mind first is ""All Across Kansas.""  Wow...  There's a lot of stuf that makes me happy...

Have you ever stopped to take stock of what makes you happy?  Nope, me either really.  Sure there's this display up there, but, hell, that's just the tip of the iceberg.  My other entries have ranged from mildly depressing to downright wrist-cuttingly low, but still...

Yeah...  Stuff makes me happy.  

Just because I have a big chin and a nearly unshaveable jaw-line and dark curly hair does not mean that I am Superman.  I'm not.  It'd be neat to be able to fly n'stuff, and to actually be able to fulfil those fantasies, but no...  It's not me.  I dare say it AIN'T me.  

I AM a mutant though!  Maybe if you're lucky I'll let you know what my mutant power is!  But don't get too excited, it's not that great either."

"event","I didn't actually go to Safeway tonight, but on my way home from the house of The Josh and the Dawson, I reminded myself of the last time I'd gone into one of our Supermarkets in the day time.  In the day time, the Markets are a mess, crowds of people coming from or going off to work,  moms with children and teenage girls that seem to laugh at everything...  All of them together...  I'm not a big fan.  But you go in there late at night and you don't get that...  There's usually three customers, a security guard, the night checker and a bunch of boxes for restocking that seem abandoned until you turn into the next aisle way at which time the sacred, world weary night stalkers scuttle back to restock away from the prying eyes of the public.  That's the way it should be.  

I often fantasize that I was meant to be born in a post-apocalyptic world.  Or at least, (probably even better) have the world go crazy while I'm alive.  I know that I'm a bit of a pussy, a softy, a wuss, but I have a couple of the requisite skills for such a world...  Then again, I guess all of us has SOME of the requitsite skills.  I think that since the day I bought the Zombie Survival Guide I've always had zombie defense strategies on my mind.  Honestly, even before that I thought about it but not as tactically aware.  When I walk the balconies at Wedgewood, I can't help but think how easily the buildings could be turned into defensive fortresses.  I know the property quite well, I know the buildings well and the place is very centrally located for long term scavenging runs...  If the man power was available and we were determined it could even be turned into a complete compound with a little land for farming.  We'd be set!

Sadly when I make my plans for surviving the Zombie Holocaust I have to remember that My survival buddy, Charlie Pierce, will not be with us much longer.  My bud Charlie is going to New Mexico and I don't think that we'll be able to execute our Zombie defense plans 3000 miles from each other.  Not to mention, he's going to be screwed!  During a worldwide rise of the dead, New Mexico is far more densely packed than Alaska...  I don't know that Charlie's going to make it!  Not to mention there won't be much of a winter to slow the dead down as we'll have up here!  My friend is prolly going to die a horrible death come the end times!  I'm going to need to find a new zombie defense partner for up here.  Maybe Ian, but he doesn't seem to me to be as Zombie savvy, but then Again, I could be wrong and I shouldn't count him out.  I could Imagine that Mike, Candy's brother would be good on the know-how end, but I can also imagine him being the crazy gung ho guy that get's everybody killed during an adrenaline rush.  I wouldn't want to risk it.  

I just started putting stuff in a pan from various different cans when I got home...  I now have a very hot soup that looks REALLY good!  I am away to be eating!"

"event","I went to bed at 2:00 like a good boy but my brain, fueled by the dulcet tones of an angsty Trent Reznor, refuse to follow along nicely so here I am.  I don't really have much to say about today.  I worked, I made time and a half...  Eight hours of near complete boredom.  I picked up two medical students, one of whom had the most cinematic name I've ever encountered to date: Jericho Cairns.  I mean damn!  That's  a cinematic name.  I drove a woman and her mother to the airport to get a rental car.  The woman, not more than 25, seemed very nice and when I left them at the Car Rental area she invited me to e-mail her should I ever decide to come to her home town, Porta Vallarta (or however the hell you spell that).  So...  If I ever decide to travel to sunny Mexico (pron. Meheeco in my mind) I'll certainly have to take this woman that I've spoken to for no more than 15 minutes up on her offer...  

I found my copy of Shooting Fish today, that was nice (having misplaced it some time last March).  It's a lovely British movie about con people starring two of my favorite awful vampires, Stuart Townsend (Queen of the Damned) and Kate Beckinsale (Underworld 1 & 2, Van Helsing).  The great thing is that the movie was made before Kate, dear Kate, became a queen bitch and she is painfully charming with short hair.  *Sighs contentedly*  Strange thing though, one would assume that a long lost treasure such as the one rediscovered today would have to be appreciated immediatly, and indeed that's exactly what I first thought.  But shortly after slipping it into the VCR and watching half the previews my (apparently)ADD addled mind sent me seeking a cartoon musical by the name of Rock and Rule (With songes by Iggy Pop, Lou Reed, Cheap Trick, Debbie Harry and Earth, Wind and, of coures, Fire).  I turned that on long enough to learn that a great war had killed all humans and left the world to be populated by evolved animals before deciding I really should just go to sleep.  So, as mentioned before, I sought out my third activity which also concluded without any sort of satisfying conclusion (i.e. sleep).  I'm not doing so hot at finishing things today.

Imagine if you could write dreams right from the beginning.  Sit down with your menu just before drifting off to sleepy town and order up a nice flying dream, or a hot sex dream involving someone you'd never considered all that appealing (until after the dream of course, when you decide to see if she really knows how to do that trick with her tongue that she'd done in the dream), or finally, the less enticing though terribly popular, like Boiled Asparagus Souffle at some trendy restaraunt where each portion costs a fortune and is equivalent in filling power to a teaspoon of chipped ice, that is, if you'd forgotten the point of this extremely long sentence, to order up an anxiety dream:  
   ""Yes, I think tonight I'd prefer to dream of the death of my parents and the subsequent stresses of seeing them taken care of whilst my brother has a mental break down.""
   ""Very good choice sir, would you like that with or without zombies?""
   ""Ooohh...  Nothing more stressful than having to dispatch with the parents a second time, I'll have that please.""
   ""Coming right up!""

Imagine it!  And don't tell me you'd never order the anxiety dream...  Sometimes I quite enjoy having to protect my dog from a roving hoarde of Zombies.  If you hadn't guessed, my anxiety dreams all involve zombies...  What can I say?  They scare me...  Those slow, loping, smelly bastards!  And inevitably I only have a flimsy kitchen knife with which to fend them off.  

Tonight I think if I ordered a dream it would be a confidence dream.  I've been feeling very...  Down, I guess, lately.  The Holiday season has compounded my lazy lifestyle and I'm upping my jean size which depresses me.  I try to motivate myself to go work out or get some willpower or something, but it's just not working.  Maybe on Tuesday I'll go work out (I work tomorrow and I choose a fuill night's rest over working out before work.  I always remind myself how cold it's going to be when I come out of the gym dripping with sweat.  But damn, mr. chubster really needs to regain his girlish figure.  I mean, I'll be the first to admit that I've never been skinny, never, but there's a certain level of chubby that I'm willing to accept and I am well beyond that point right now.  I really feel like going up to the White mountains and taking a hike, but Alaska in January is not the best time for such an activity.  Blast!

This is turning out to be longer than I'd planned.  I got up thinking about what I'd say to someone who I knew I'd never see again (hypothetical situation, this is not an actual event I'm planning for)...  But it wouldn't be that circumstances would keep us away for, as I've come to discover, the world is a small place and you can never rule out a chance encounter 4000 miles from home in a soccer *ahem* football stadium or... uh...  elsewhere.  I mean making the conscious effort to never see this person.  Not because of hate, but because it's just no good to be around that person.  Think about it if there was a person that you honestly felt you'd be better off never seeing again (not for malice mind you), what would you say to them.  The best I could come up with (and I was listening to Nine inch nails as I thought it) was:  I only exist to you if you acknowledge that I exist.

I only exist to you if you acknowledge that I exist.  It's just so simple.  In my mind it says that I am erasing my existence from your life, you'll never be bothered with me again, I will go and never darken your towels again (3 points if you recognize this quote).  But it doesn't mean I'm gone forever (a la suicide, which I think deserves an honorable mention in the next paragraph), it simply means, that if you really care for me to exist, I will exist in your life.  My friend Ty read the quote to be a bit higher minded than I'd intended it, that is on the existential level, but I mean it purely on the level of the social interactions of two people.  Imagine walking up to someone you'd never seen, someone just passing in the street and saying that to them...  What would happen, how would the world change or would it change at all.  Maybe they'd just give you an odd look and walk away as, embarassed, your face turns twelve shades of red.  But then imagine saying it to someone you've known for a long time.  Someone who it seemed could live without you.  I think quite a few of my friends would just say ""What the hell is up with you Jason?""  To which I'd say ""I'm hungry, lets go eat some greasy cheesy fries and some boiled asparagus souffle, you know, the kind that is just as satisfying as a teaspoon of Ice chips!""  

The girlfriend of one of my co-workers recently attempted to commit suicide (I know, 'tis the season).  What I thought about as I sat at work on my day off, filling in for the guy, was just how I'd deal with a girlfriend or best friend for that matter, attempting suicide.  If it were a girlfriend, the first thing I'd do (hypothetically, I'm depending on my friends to not pull this shit and put me through it in real life) would be to dump the bitch.  I mean honestly, it's like she's already practically done it herself!  If she'd succeeded I certainly wouldn't still be dating her (that's almost universally illegal), so why don't i just take the hint!  It's not like she felt like she could confide in me or depend on me, so I might as well returne to the good(?) life of a bachelor.  Best friends too, come on people, we're supposed to help each other out, that's what we're here for, if you just go and do that it's like saying ""Fuck you buddy.""  Honestly.  So people, don't pull that shit with me! I'd like to think that we're all our of our moody listening to Tori Amos as we cut ourselves phase and have now moved on to our repressing our angst and storing it up for our mid-life crises or when we get fired from the post office or when our children spill milk or whatever...  So yeah...  If you do decide to kill yourself, at least let us know so we can all have the wake BEFORE you do it.  And I promise that should I ever decide that life is no longer worth living, I'll let you all buy me a beer before kill myself.  And rest assured, if I decide to kill myself I'm going to do it, none of that pussy ""cry for help"" stuff...  I do enough whining right now as it is, no need to compound that with a nasty medical bill and lengthy forced therapy sessions, you know what I mean.  I'm sure Ted Bank III would be proud (Note to Reader:  Look up Theodore Paul Bank III, dig deep and you'll see what I'm getting at there).  Right, It's late and I must belatedly reply to Brandon's absurdly off topic reply to my first post.  Adieu!"

"event","Look at that!  Seven days short of a year since my last post.  Of course when I wrote it I thought that last post would be my LAST post...  But here I go proving myself wrong (always have to be contrary).  I figured that since my world is quickly changing it would be best to collect my rants, musings, experiences, etc. for my friends and family to read (at their own risk).  Because I guess as much as this is a Jason update I plan on using it as an actual journal as well so at some points I'm sure I'll have to warn my family not to read further...  At which point, consumed to the core with curiosity (alliteration!), they'll continue on to discover their dear son/brother is not all that...  Innocent?  Intelligent?  Sane?  Oh well.  They published Bronislaw Malinoski's (Note to reader: Look up Malinowski) diary 15 years after his death.  Banal complaining and candid recollections of homosexual dreams included...  It was his wife who authorized it no less!  So, if Malinowski doesn't get to keep his thoughts private, why should I?  

So yeah, It's new years morning, I've just returned from the Blue Loon New Years party with burning eyes and a sore tongue (at lunch today I nearly bit a hole through my tongue, blood everywhere, and also chipped one of my teeth on a fork...  I'm skilled!).  I took three of my Brazilian co-workers with me to show them an Alaskan club (and honestly, one of them is pretty damned hot) and despite the very bored looks on their faces they insisted they were having a good time for two more hours after I was ready to go...  It's not that I'm a party pooper it's just that DJ Johann is a tool and I don't generally enjoy doing the grind.  Yeah, I stink of cigarettes, but at least I'm not drunk...  Or dead!  Or dead drunk!  I have to get up for work in roughly 8 hours and I'm debating wether I should head to bed or continue to write, or stop writing and go shower the filth of a hundred drunken whores (I know that's a little over dramatic, but I'm tired so be patient with me) off my body.

I saw Heather Ward at the Loon tonight.  That had its up side and its down side but that's the way my interactions with Heather always are.  I have been in so many break-ups that either directly or indirectly involved Heather that if I wanted to be vindictive I could blame her for my fucked up ""love"" life.  That of course is absurd because all those break up involved me, quite directly, not to mention the ones that had nothing to do with her and quite a bit to do with me.  I guess if I wanted a scape-goat though, she'd be a good target.  She pisses me off...  But not in the bad way, more in the way that only someone you really care about and that (I hope) really cares about you can do..  I'm sure a few of you know what I'm talking about, at least I hope so because otherwise I'm irrevocably insane.  

Hmm...  My mind has gone blank...  That means bed time!  YAY!"

"event","I'm not a fan of web journals, I have several friends that have them and I've sworn to never read them.  One's an ex-girlfriend, one's a best friend, both live in the same house; I don't need to hear if they ever feel like having sex.  Speaking of sex... Three years and three minutes ago, I had a girl who I loved and trusted.  Three years ago, almost exactly, I didn't have her anymore.  I'm not so anal retentive that I wrote this fact on my calendar or anything (though I am pretty damned anal) it's just that I was supposed to start work at a new job the next day.  I was so torn up over it that had to call in sick for the first two days of the job.  I couldn't sleep, every time I closed my eyes I just began to imagine all the horrid things she might have done.

A month earlier, She went on vacation to Arizona to visit an ex who was also a best friend of hers.  She'd asked me several times if I was okay with her going, and in retrospect maybe I shouldn't have told her I was but she'd already bought the ticket and how could I be the asshole to dictate what she did with her life?  So, things were great for most of the month, then just after Christmas she stopped writing.  I wrote her and asked her what was up and finally, she told me that when she came home we'd ""have to talk.""  I knew what that meant, but of course I had to be sure so I asked her if it was a break up talk...  She said yes, and I was crushed.  And yeah...  I spent the next two days awake, watching old Red Skelton DVD's and I probably saw Moulin Rouge about ten times as well.  It's depressing enough to have been broken up after waiting a month for someone that is very important to you, but then I only had a depressing (if not musically diverse) Baz Lerman movie and old television variety shows with out-dated humor to keep your mind off the life you miss.  

I finally slept.  I finally went to work.  That night, feeling like a piece of shit, I went to one of my best friends' houses.  We talked for a few hours and then we just started having sex.  That's only time I had sex with her, we're still good friends, Nobody knows it happened and we haven't discussed it since.  I was hoping it would make me feel better...  I think it just made me feel not dead...  Which technically was better than what I'd felt before.  Eventually the girl cam back home and I, like the loser I am, followed through with throwing her birthday celebration as I'd promised when she still loved me (I'm not saying she didn't still love me, I'm just saying she didn't seem to care enough about me to save me some of the shit she put me through).  I made her an extremely special cake (one my grandmother would always make for my birthday before she died), and we shared it.  It was good, not as good as Grandma's, but not as bad as I wish I had made it.  

Eventually I realized I couldn't stand to be anywhere near her.  Just the sight of her made me physically ill.  Everything she said or wrote turned my stomach upside down and inside out.  I avoided her (a hard task considering how imbedded in my life she was), and finally, thankfully, she left the state for (yup) Arizona.  She comes back everynow and then, and I do my damndest to avoid her.  It works well enough, I guess.

I never once got mad at her...  Anger is an emotion I have trouble communicating.  I always worry about hurting someone of making them mad.  This of course would be the intention with the girl, but of course the thought never crossed my mind with her.  I never let her know how much she'd hurt me, and I never gave myself the chance to hurt her back.  I hate myself for that.  I hate that I never told her, hell, I never even raised my voice.  And worst of all...  She's fucked me up.  I've not had anything Truly good since then...   Is it my fault or hers or fate's?  Who knows?  I like to blame her because she's an easy target for all the hate and anger I feel, but hell, look at me, three years later and I'm still bitching about her.  I'm still in love with her of course, but I could never be with her because I hate her more than anything else in the world.  

I know I'm still stupid over her, I know that I still hate her, I know that I probably never cross her mind, and I know I should just get over it.  

Get over it, I'm working on it...  But you know what...  I'll do it when I'm good and ready to.  When is that,  maybe soon, maybe never.  

I'll be silent for a spell, wishing I had done a better job of burying Sorrow."

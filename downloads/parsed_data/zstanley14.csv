"event","Yesterday I moved a dead body to the morgue.  Or, the Pathology Dept., as the hospital euphemistically calls it.  I was working in the hospital with my handy dandy pager, walking around and taking in the Christmas spirit inherent to the day, but of course the spirit had to be squashed at the dreary hospital.  I even opened up the body bag and looked at the dead guy's yeller face.  He looked at me, too.  Most dead people's eyes open up, ya know.  To my surprise, I remember bringing him up from the ER earlier that week.  Lucky for us, he hadn't gone into rigor yet.

This is Colleen, and no one really likes her but she is my uncle's concubine/breeder.  She has produced two children in order to continue the glorious family line.  As one can see, I was in the process of getting drunk. Well alright then enough now."

Notice the savage skins on the front row-ers? Those are from their vanquished foes.  I think that pudgy one on the left has had a bit much though.  We should stop them, anyone?"

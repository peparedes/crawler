"event","Today I went to skool... like I do everyday then hmm... nothing really good happened... 

Came home and got a birthday card in the mail... my birthday was in NOVEMBER... 

Anyways so then I opened it and there was sixteen dollars in it so I wasn't too bummed... Then I found out Sasha kinda invited herself to come to the mall with Jen, Dennis, and I, but I really didn't mind cuz no matter wat I'll see my baby... so yea tonite Dennis, Sasha, Jenny and I are going to the mall, but befure that my mum, sasha, Jenny, my daddy, and I are going to Marlboro cuz he has to drop his truck off... 

I picked a date fur when I get married in the future... AUGUST 1... I wanna get married that day, becuz my step-father means so much to me and that's the day he adopted me... That day to me signifies forever TRUE love, becuz he didnt have to adopt my sister and I... He could have just married my mum and slept with my mum, but no he went the extra mile and made himself my REAL father... And he has loved me ever since and that wat my husband is going to be like too... so Fur now I am getting married on August first... Unless my fiance has something different in mind, but I am Barbie and I usually get my way so we will see... PLUS I NEED TO FIND A FIANCE FIRST!!! LOL

Love y'all

So then I was off to payless where I bought these boots... they're boy boots, but they're kinda kute on me, plus  they kinda look like Timbs... O well I think they'e kute... so anywayz while I was at payless I found this really kute back pack purse OMG which I have wanted for a while, but you kno wat tops it? it was a HELLO KITTY one.. so of course I had to buy it OOO my goodness.. IT was marked as 14.99 and I really didnt want to pay that much but I really wanted it so I did anywayz and it rang in as $7.35... I was so excited... It's so adorable... JUST like me!!! 

After that exciting extravangansa I went to Honey Farms store 40 in West Boylston and there was a gurl on working with her bf how fucked is that?

So then We got to Jen's Daisy attacked me but it was alrite it was FUNN LOL... She was licking me and I couldnt breathe LOL... so then we watched this movie called ""Frogs"" which I must say was a really dumb movie, but then we watched ""Final Destination 2"" which made up for it, becuz it was such a great movie... We finally went to bed around 1, but I called my mummy in the mean time and two of her cashiers and her were having a slumber party in her back office, I mean literally they were on the floor with a blanket and pillow sleeping LOL.... I Love my mommy

"event","so last nite Denny and I were supposed to go out, but wen we went to get in the truck in order to go out the truck wudnt start... OMG so him and my dad went out and my dad got under the truck with HOT HOT bottles of water to de-thaw the gas line which froze.. LOL sorry Denny it's not funny.. or so you say... umm so then we ran up to Toula's and grabbed some food came home asked if we could go out, but my rents said no so Denny left...

After Denny left I went to go pick my sister up at Josh's and then wen I got home i called Denny, but I was in a bad mood and wouldn't say anything so Denny got off the fone.. so then I went to bed and had two bad dreams

One was about my real dad and the other one was about me getting pregnant... UGHH...

umm so Ihave been thinking bout my real dad lately... I hate him alot, but at the same time I want him to be here... I hate him fur not being her, but I feal like i wanna see him like i want himt o be around and to see me get my license and to see my graduate, but at the same time I don't want him to think I'm giving in like mayb this is a game he likes to play I dunnno... I guess I just kinda feal left out like everyone else's dads are around and stuff and they've been around since they were born and yea i kno I have my Stepdad and i love him a lot but it's really not the same... Like since my dad left i haven't wanted anything to do with, but now that I am getting older I wish he could see wat I have become and jut watch me grow up and see... I am sitting here riting all this stuff trying to make it sound like i hate my dad, but the truth of the matter is I really wish I could see him and actually tell him how I feal, but I kno if i did there would be many of people who would get upset with me and I would give in and want to see him time after time becuz I love him... I mean he is my dad... but I kno I'll get my hopes up and he won't show up or he blow me off... I honestly just wish he would be here for me and that he didn't leave....

Now saying that I have also been thinking lately a lot about me ending up like my mom.... All through my life i have alwayz said I am going to high school finishing with GREAT grades and then going to college and getting a job that will make a difference, but my grades are average and I kno I am no where near college, but I still think I am going to end up like her... Pregnant and a drop out who has a horrible job and two kids and is divorced by the age of 20.... I want to have faith and trust, but it is so HARD.... 

so anywayz I'm sleeping over Jenny's house tonite so I need to go take a shower and pack... talk to y'all later..."

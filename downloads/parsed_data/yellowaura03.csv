"event","My parents disagree with unionization.  Upon the basis that it encourages mediocrity and doesn't allow people who are smart and work hard to get ahead and get better things than everyone else.  Unions let people work the amount they want to work and lets them get the benefits of full employment without putting in as much effort as everyone else, leaving other folks to pick up their slack. 

My argument against this is that our society's dependence on wage labor creates a kind of slavery for the working classes - and even for our white-collar paperpushing working class.  People are forced to work eight hours a day in jobs they hate that give them little satisfaction.  For this they are allowed to sleep in a nice bed and eat regularly, and they have the freedom to fritter away their money on capitalist tools for mass control (i.e. tv, ipods, etc.).  Any system that gives people a little more control over how they spend a third of their waking lives without having to worry about losing a job and consequently their ability to eat is a good system.  Sure,  unions sometimes have work stoppages that don't seem to do as much good as they do annoy everyone else that has to go on working (for instance, a transportation workers strike.)

In my opinion, a utopian society would allow everyone the absolute freedom to work at whatever activities give them pleasure for as long as they want whenever they want.  However, folks would also have to understand that there are some responsibilities that must be shared by all for the common good. Which is where selfishness sort of destroys this model. 

In any case, I find it disconcerting that my father said that unions promote mediocrity and laziness - as if it was the most logical statement in the world to make.  In my opinion, the man, who works at least 50 hours a week just at the office, plus two hours of commuting per day and at least an hour of work from home a night, needs a damn union.  I think office rats feel disempowered about asking for shorter hours and more flexible scheduling to accomodate the fact that they have a Life and are not just worker bees for the corporate cause.  I think there are some serious mind games at work here that are a problem.  I would describe in more detail if it weren't about time to go to sleep.

This production-society model that thrives on growth, climbing, and expansion is not sustainable for the environment, the economy, the nation, or People.  It is not working.  It is ""Too Big to. . . "" be successful. 

Little Jack got swindled into believing that five ordinary beans were worth trading his entire livelihood and cultural values for.  He climbed the corporate and social beanstalk that grew from that anti-investment and found his goose cooked when the big wig on top thought nothing of it to eat the little guy and appropriate whatever meagre resources he had.  

I'm wondering if we can change the ending. 

Originally, the sly and intelligent young man stole from the giant, who, without his endless supply of golden eggs, can do nothing but fall to the ground and die, while young Jack can now use his limitless resources to build his own empire.  Not the most moral of stories. 

What if. . . 

Jack finds the magic goose and kills it, and then takes the magic singing harp and bewitches it to only speak the truth.  Afraid of what he has done, Jack goes back down the beanstalk to have a last meal of bean stew with his ailing mother. When the giant asks the harp where his goose is, the harp can only say that the gold will no longer be flying in, because the people have killed their greed.  In a fit of rage, the giant dismantles everything he owns, throws his staff out into the streets, and demands to be compensated for his terrible losses.  He is about to destroy the harp when suddenly it begins to sing a beautiful song.  It tells the story of a simpler and sustainable way of life that is lived in the hill country below his castle, and it sounds so much like what could fill the hole in the giant's heart that he goes in search of the beanstalk that will take him there.  He finds it, and as he climbs down, he grows smaller and smaller, leaving behind gadgets and fancy cars and luxury cruises in his wake.  When he finally reaches the bottom, he is no bigger than Jack himself, who comes out to meet and embrace him, and invite him in for bean stew.  The next day they go out together to chop down the beanstalk . . . .  and then they compost the remains.

"event","I miss home.  The perfect chill climate of northern Spain reminds me of my Michigan forests, crisp rivers, iron bridges, and farmland that smells like shit.  There are familiar plants and smells and animals here in Galicia, and I find that I just want to be in my own country with my own people where vegetarian food is easy to find and various races aren't completely unheard of (and openly scorned).  At home, religious people are really religious and non-religious people are not.  None of this slip-shod wishiwashiness of culture and history pervading every thought and action so that you don't feel free to make your own choices.  And I miss coffee shop culture!  I miss the oasis of pseudo-intellectualism, and I miss the world I work in. 
I suppose this Camino is preparing me for reentry - it is evoking so many strangely familiar feelings of longing for the motherland.  And for my mother.  For her concern and wit and willingness to take me out to dinner and talk to me about anything for absolutely hours.  And a longing for Nicholas, for mid-fall walks through college campuses colloquializing edifying ideas.  For moments of silence shared together. For watching him laugh.  For laughing. . . . for not being the smartest person in the room. 
For a community where I belong and can recognize most of the songs played at twillight on summertime porches in Ann Arbor.  
And as I also watch the teens and twenty something couples con poco verguenza, all over each other on the grass, I feel a longing once again (though much calmer now) for the experience of the intimate sphere of action-reaction between a woman and man who don't yet understand quite what this beautiful feeling between them is.  
Last summer I wanted black coffee and cigarettes, drugs and psychedelic music, candles and wine with art and romance - dark corners in a small room.  
Today, I crave air and fresh sunlight, cool water and light colors.  The touch of a man as it happens in daylight during a tender moment, shared publicly.  I want kittens and babies and rivulets.
I want to ride my bicycle and begin to organize my two projects of next semester. 
I want to do crossword puzzles and read poetry and Shakespeare aloud and watch foriegn films at the Michigan like the huge dork that I actually am.  
In short, I think I may have finally decided to be me, fully and absolutely, with an unshakeable faith in God, the Great Spirit who moves and loves, with a fervent love and courage in my heart that motivates me to do the work that exists in my life for me to do.  To enjoy my life every day and forever more and to be happy, inexplicably and without a doubt.  I want to understand and accept that the world is fucked up, and remember that everyone on this planet is just trying.  That with the information they have and with the given circumstances of their life at that moment that they are making what they believe is the best possible decision.  Therefore you can hold no one accountable for faults they make against you, but you can blame yourself for not trying quite hard enough to be a model of God's love that can change the world. 
I don't need to have mystery and confusion in my eyes in order to be attractive to people.  What you will see - the surprising truth will be that I am not dead inside!  That I have suffered, but now I live!  that I am happyh, and you won't be able to quite figure out why."

Story Time:  I went to the drugstore yesterday for some soap and sunscreen and benadryl for the trip . . . I checked out and the guy, per usual, started to put my purchases in a plastic bag.  I stopped him, saying I had my own bag, and that it would be a waste of bags.  So after I take the stuff out of the plastic bag, as he looks on in utter confusion, he balls up the bag and is about to throw it away.  I stopped him, and he looked really, really concerned about my mental stability. . .  I was like, ""um, that was the point . . . "" I asked him to reuse it or save it for something.  I don't know that he did.  Ah well.  Got on my big yellow Schwinn and pedalled away.  

Sustainability is a big buzz word right now.  Sometimes, in hyperconcientious communities like the old fourth quarter of A2, I forget that the rest of the world exists and that it isn't second nature for most people to turn off lights, reuse containers, and bike or walk instead of driving.  And most of the time, we even don't do as well as we can.  We're in a culture of convenience.  And we love it!  I know I do.  Reliance on convenience is an addiction that afflicts every individual in any way involved in American culture.  
This is something to resist. 

Resistance is difficult. 
It is also crucial. 
Resistance against resistance . . . is that which makes life worth living.

"event","As You Like It is officially ovah for me.  I saw my last performance of it last night and it was tres nice.  

I am now working on getting a second job so I can work on saving money for my trips overseas this summer.  I am uber excited.  My teaching job in Spain isn't absolutely secured yet, but my aunt, who personally knows the director of education for the province, says she feels very positive about it and that the DoE responded quite favorably to my resume.  Those camps don't start until July, so I'll be in Spain with little to do from June 15 until some time in mid-July, leaving me a whole month to travel, work on my Spanish fluency, and just generally enjoy being in Europe.  I plan to spend at least two weeks on my own taking trains and staying in hostels throughout the country, especially the places I haven't yet been.  If I have enough money by the end of this semester, I may even consider getting a eurorail pass and using an extra week or two to go into France, Germany, or Italy.  After a month in Senegal, I'll probably know enough french survival phrases to be understood in any country. . . 

So, with my extra 25 hours a week with AYLI finished, I will be (with luck) working at least 10 extra hours a week for at minimum 8.5/hr, spending time actually doing homework with care and precision, studying Spanish and basic French with vehemence, and, parties willing, doing some guerilla work with ARTillery . .. although we might also end up doing a lot of play reading and song singing, which is spiritually and artistically beneficial.  With luck, I'll also have time and motivation to write, pray, play music, and read for plaisir.  

I am patiently learning, like Levin in Anna Karenina, and even St. Terese de Avila, . . . and, come to think of it, Albert and Tommy in I heart Huckabees, that despite  excitement, ecstasy, hopefulness, and moments of clarity, (pure being!), human nature is to fall.  And we're never as happy in the moments we're in as we are in thinking on the moments we anticipate to come. I'm not sure yet whether it is our lot to perpetually re-climb after a fall, always renewing hope and striving for great heights, or to simply ride with the tides - and by keeping a firm center  avoid desolation and despair.  

Anyway, I was supposed to, two hours ago, leave to go up to the Dude to write a paper, due on Monday, that I haven't quite started yet.  Oops.  Maybe procrastination is okay.  In any case, I should probably now leave to do that.  I vow to spend either three hours or two pages working on the paper, whichever comes first.  After that, I vow to use the NCRB, and come home.  Then, I vow another three hours or four pages to the paper, whichever comes first.  So, by the end of the day, I should have at the very least half the paper done, so that I can finish it Sunday and edit on Monday morning.   Tonight, my house is having an in-house party that I'm a little excited about because hopefully it will be very chill and very enjoyable.  

Okay.  That's enough.  Here I go to write about the similarities and differences between the pride and passion ratio in the personalities of Alexey Vronsky and Constantine Levin of Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy."

Other than that, I'm thoroughly frustrated with my mental health.  And I'm also concerned that I'm not very capable of carrying the line of a conversation anymore. . . or maybe that's not true, maybe it's just with a few people who . . . yes, that's what it is.  It's really just happening with one person that I just happen to talk to a lot that I'm having a hard time talking to at this point in our friendship.  

Tomorrow I need to also go out on the town early in the morning to buy random things from the drug store, possibly a few of my books that I haven't thought about buying yet, all of my coursepacks . . . and hopefully that's it and I'm not forgetting anything.  blegh.
I hope people open around 8.  That would be good. 

Alright.  That's all."

I was accepted into the Global Intercultural Exchange for Undergraduates program and may be spending a portion of my summer in Italy, Costa Rica, or Senegal. . . pending and tba by Dec. 19.  
I'm probably most prepared for Italy- working on puppetry and theatrics in a western european country. . . a little less prepared for Costa Rica- doing non-governmental aid work in a third world Spanish speaking country . . . and most unprepared for Senegal, doing archaelogical excavation and cultural participation in a third world French speaking country with excessive temperatures and desert conditions. 

Finals are coming up, and by that I mean that I have a huge history of dress project due on Monday that I need to spend probably about 30 hours on over this weekend, a color model for sets due on Thursday, a final paper on Friday on a topic that my professor failed to mention she had already published multiple articles on (great . . . writing to the expert), and two months worth of Voice journals that I haven't been keeping track of. 

Over break, I will probably spend a little extra time in Ann Arbor, then about a week and a half in Grand Blanc, and I will individually foray up to my relatives' in Muskegon and Ludington on Christmas Eve/Day so that I don't have to spend five days under the whimsy of my immediate family and in the vicinity of my very uncomfortable extended family.  I'd like to see them, but I don't need to live with them for a week.  The thought is mortifying.  I've done it for the past twenty years, and don't need to again. 

Next semester I'm taking only 15 credits and working on two shows. 
I'm taking Directing II, Acting IV, Politics and Theatre, Spanish Grammar, and Survey of Russian Lit.  
I'm assistant directing 'As You Like It' with Gillian Eaton, and probably directing 'The Further Adventures of Hedda Gabler' through the Basement. . . 
Which reminds me that I have to turn in a formal proposal by Monday, also. 

Ah life. 

Right now, I am going to go to Voice class, see if I can get a group of freshmen together for a 'work on your procrastinated journals' party, work in the paint shop for a few hours, work in the design studio for a few hours, have dinner, work on my computer for a few hours, possibly go to the library, and if I have time, I might go see 'Red Light Winter' or 'A Good Boy' tonight. . . or possibly tomorrow. 

Finals time = fun and excitement for everyone = lots of hours of work, exhaustion, illness, tension, frustration, and general malaise.

I'm trying really hard to get everything done tonight and tomorrow to be ready for coming back to classes on Monday so that I can spend the entire break doing absolutely nothing. 

Let's see. . . Our Lady of 121st St. was fine, it got boring after a while. . . Adventures in Mating was a fantabulous experience that was very well received and admired, so that was good.  And Sunday Morning, although it is an arduous, difficult, and frustrating process, is shaping up to be not bad.  It is not what I would have expected, and not entirely what I wanted. . . but it's alright. 

My Sets project turned out really great.  I'm proud of it. 
My complit class is the first academic course I haven't understood.  Ever.  But I don't think it's actually my fault.  I just don't speak Hebrew or Arabic.  Which is mildly problematic for this particular course. 
Voice is still a little silly, but not as difficult to get through. 
History of Dress is absolutely ridiculous and the bane of my existence.  I don't want to work on the final project, but I will anyway. 
Stage Management is fine.  
Directing is fine, despite it sometimes being very repetitive and that MT who drives me crazy. 

Work is easy, even if it eats up some of my extra time.
Teaching catechism is one of my favorite weekly activities.  Because it isn't really work. . . it's communicating God's love to young children in a fun language . . . with a very cute teaching partner :p

The weather has been unseasonably warm, and I really don't mind.  The autumn leaves are appealing.

I'm sad that I've been so busy, because it means not being able to forge stronger relationships with people that I really like to spend time with.  No matter.  It will work itself out in the end. 

I have a blood blister on my left breast that really is freaking me out and destroying the aesthetic. Looks like a damned third nipple. It should go away soon. 

I'm feeling pretty good, all things considered.  I'm impressed with how well I've been dealing with all this really heightened stress.

I think that's all.  
I'm going to work on getting ready for break, now.

Set design - Agamemmnon (the Ted Hughes translation is officially phenom.)

There are many other things going on as well. 



There's an idea I'm uncovering about the relationship between (to use Tom Wolfe's vocabulary) the bohemian art cafe and 'tout le monde'.

I am interested in why art is important. 

I am interested in the dual nature of God as vengeful, almighty, creator and caring, intimate, father/lover.  

I'm looking for more acquaintances OUTside of the theatre department. 

And my bullshit meter skills are being honed daily as I begin to understand why people with fine arts majors are scoffed at for having subjective and ethereal classroom conversations.  

There are lots of people who need to get over themselves, and if I hear one more person use the word ""brilliant"" to describe ANYthing but a particularly bright lightbulb, I might have to stare them down.  


Don't give me these words about how your art transcends reality- breaks through the confines of this mundane world and reaches a higher plane. 
Give me something real. 
My reality transcends your fucking art.  You can't even see the infinite stretches of absolute reality.

Creativity does not mean recreating THE universe, it means first creating A universe. 


I'm also trying to not be a powder keg.

Caffeine is still the preferred drug of choice, with alcohol, nicotine, and THC taking close seconds depending on cheapness and availability.  But caffeine still wins out about 95 percent of the time.

Here's the story of my morning, told in an itinerary format. 

6:00 am - hear the alarm on my phone going off, press snooze. 
6:05 am - hear the alarm again, press snooze again
6:07 am - think I hear the alarm again, because the damn thing gets stuck in your head
6:10 am - lie in bed, turn on the lights, and curse irises that hurt when they de-dilate to quickly
6:23 am - get out of bed, get dressed
6:30 am - strip the bedding and pack it in a suitcase
6:45 am - eat peanut butter on wheat bread (did you hear about the rising wheat prices? shikes)
6:48 am - Cristin picks me up and helps put my luggage in her little red car
6:56 am - arrive at SRQ airport
6:57 am - notice that there are no attendants behind the check-in desk
6:58 am - realize that my 8:40am flight is not listed on the monitors above the check-in desk
6:59 am - talk to a security guard about where people are
7:00 am - discover that my flight does not exist, and that check-in people won't arrive 'till 8
7:10 am - get off the phone with my mom who confirms its probably best to just wait for the people to arrive
7:45 am - see a person behind the desk, but don't ask questions
8:15 am - move back over to the check in desk to wait
8:30 am - people walk back and forth from the back to front, not acknowledging me.
8:45 am - some guy says the computers are down
9:00 am - a line begins to form behind me
9:01 am - a woman finally comes to talk to me, and is disheartened that this is the first problem of the day on a day when there are no computers
9:18 am - I am rerouted to a new flight, leaving at 2:30pm, but- with a free roundtrip flight voucher, and a $10 meal ticket for airport restaurants. I figure I win anyway. 
9:45 am - I find a lounge area with free WiFi
10:45 am - Decide to chill by the computer a bit longer
11:20 am - Write about it on LJ. 


This is how the rest of the day may end up going

11:55am - Go to the bathroom. . . 
12:00pm - Eat something that costs $10 at the restaurant
12:30pm - Read one of the three books I bought at SNaB (my new acronym, ya like?) last night
1:15pm - Go through security
1:45pm - Sit myself comfortably by my gate and read some more
2:04pm - Board my completely safe aircraft that I will not be anxious about. 
2:30pm - Be in the airspace between here and Atlanta
4:00pm - Be in the Atlanta airport and try to keep myself occupied
6:00pm - Be in the airspace between Atlanta and Flint
8:00pm - Be in Flint
8:15pm - Be safely at my parent's home in GB. 

It promises to be a dandy day.  Maybe boring, a bit stressful perhaps, but nonetheless, nothing to complain at length about. 
Besides- I'm done with my internship! YAY! I get to go back to my liberal college campus and sniff pine trees at the Arb!!
Can't wait.

I think the best way to deal with the Artillery situation is to tell John I'd rather perform than direct- because we have such vastly different visions.  Or something.  I'm still ruminating on this concept.  I'd be willing to 'co-direct'- meaning, be the person he can talk to and run ideas by before coming to rehearsal and also lead a few rehearsals once we have a framework. . . but this is his piece, and I don't think I can work with him on it in the capacity I have been without leaving frustrated, feeling bitchy, unfufilled, and forever butting heads with him.  And I'm a good actor.  I could most definitely do the work required of this project.  And I'm a mover.  Hell, I'll choreograph movement/dance sequences, but . . . I think this might be better.  It lets him sort of spread his wings while still having someone to make sure he has all his ideas thought through before going ahead with them- something that I think a lot of young leaders have a difficult time doing on their own- and it lets me do performance work while maintaining a higher degree of ownership and interest into the direction of the project. 

Yes, I think that's the best way to handle this project. 
I'll think about this tactic a bit longer and then pounce. 

Three propositions I'm making within the next two weeks! Yikes.  I also have to convince Nick to go to Spain with me next spring.  And propose to another certain some person that it would be worth it to get to know one another better. 
Ah, I'm always hatching schemes, aren't I?

I want to be back in MI soooooo much right now.  I've been waiting for this day for about three weeks.  Oh this is good.  

I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow. 
I have to figure out how I'm packing up to go back to A2. . . . and I'll be in the Holland and Kalamazoo areas this weekend!  Maybe I'll get Nick to go to Lake MI with me.  After three months of the glorious, but wave-less Gulf of Mexico, I'm yearning for the tempestuous, cool, freshwater, seaweed-free beaches of Michigan's west coast.  
Sigh.  I think I'm a midwesterner. 
Damn.

The cross is a cross, but the figure attached to it is so human and real.
Sallow-skinned, recently expired Christ hangs limply, but artistically, bound by ropes and nails and suspended in the air. 
The curves of his body, slender, well-muscled, perfectly poised in a spiraled position of release after agony.  The surface looks smooth and the traditional piece of cloth strung around the waist droops down below where the pelvic girdle stretches the skin. 

I've changed my mind, i think the exact moment captured is of the split second between the soul's leaving the body and the mind's knowing that death has come at last. 

And this figure is also charged with eroticism, somehow.  The eros-thanatos pattern infiltrating traditional christian dogma.  
In all the vulnerability there is strength.  And the flesh is still warm and desires a touch, even when seconds from death.  

This artist loved his subject.

"event","Yesterday was by far the best day I've had in Sarasota this summer. 

After buying fruits and vegetables at the farmers' market, I went with James to Myakka state park.  We rented an extra kayak and went gliding across a gigantic, alligator-infested fresh water lake for two hours.  The edges of the lake were skirted with giant palm trees and six hundred different colors of green.  We saw two alligators in the water with us.  It was intense. 
And split perfectly over the lake was the sky, blue and beautiful to the north and greyed clouds with menacing lightning a few miles away to the south.  The two skies met in the middle in a swirl of clouds around the sun. 

When we got back to shore, I talked to old women about Florida lawn lizards that change colors.  We drove towards the park entrance and stopped at the canopy walk trail. 
It was utterly silent as we walked through gigantic moss covered trees dripping with sheets of fluid Spanish moss.  A skinny squirrel and a big black lizard shared separate sides of a tree.  In the middle of the canopy walk trail is a 'canopy walk' (hence the name, apparently).  Two eighty foot tall towers with a suspension bridge stretched between them.  To walk across and over the canopy and stare out over miles of unadulterated Floridian rainforest. A breeze blew softly above  all those layers of trees.  


On the way back to 4th st., stopped for sandwiches for dinner before getting back to my apartment so I could take a record short length shower and get ready for work. 

Suffice it to say, it was amazing.

I just can't do the small talk thing because it's so f-ing boring.  Life stories are interesting. . . and those are okay for small talk, but young people don't have too many life stories.  

I don't understand why I find this sort of a life so boring right now. . . possibly because it involves almost every thing that I always swore I would never spend the rest of my life doing. 

Whatever. 

In positive news, I read a really great Glen Berger play today.  I'm uber excited about it.  It takes place in the mind of a once - dead stuffed goat. Which is about all you can say about it, really. 

I'm also currently reading Grotowski's Towards a Poor Theatre.  I would like very much to emulate the ideas of the poor theatre. Meanwhile, it's easier to produce something with low production values . . . 


People here have stopped calling me and asking me to come to things.  Maybe I'm boring to them.  I think that's probably very true.  I don't laugh at their jokes and I guess I'm not very funny.  I have nothing to say to them.  

I have difficulty breathing.  It really sucks.  It occurs more often when I'm bored out of my mind and don't have the strength to conjure up a fantasy world. . . or really, I think I'm sick of living in the dreams of my head.  Real life is rapturous.  If only we stopped some things and started some others. 

Maybe I need some sleep. . . . I need some shock therapy more likely. . . .or an orgasm. . . or a brilliant film. . . or a religious experience. . . 
The surreality of a life unlived is the most lugubrious manifesto not in print. 

I don't think a dream deferred explodes.  No.  No, a dream deferred is like one of the figs (plums?) on Sylvia Plath's tree in the Bell Jar.  It grows heavy with fruit, is shaken off the branch, falls to the floor, rots, and dries out - turning into dust. . . dust that necessarily will fertilise a new plant, but that is unused by the tree itself. . . unless the tree lives long enough to recycle the dream and turn it into something even more useful. 

I dreamt last night that I was flying an airplane through a city after the more conventional method of travel by canoe failed when my brother tipped my boat and emptied it of me, my companion, ten loaves of bread, and a pocket knife. 

James invited me to go kayaking with him this weekend.  I think it will be jolly. 

If anyone asks within the next twenty years: I don't belong in Sarasota. 


I bought a skirt today from the one neat clothing shop downtown.  It's wicked cool. 

Amateur improv shows make me want to die. 

I think I should learn elementary French.  
I want to travel to Shanghai, Bangkok, Mexico City, Madrid, Santiago, Rome, Munich, Venice, Florence, Vienna, Bombay, Geneva, Moscow, Macchu Picchu, Sumer, Athens, and Jakarta.

ni hui bu hui shui ing wen? bu hui chong wen. 


I also want to write poetry, plays, and make a quilt.  

You.  I am so bored by you and your loud faced excess. 

I was thinking the other day of what my personal ad would say if I ever were to advertise myself as available (as one day, I will probably become just. that. desperate). 
I thought 'chronic artistic drifter seeks fellow intellectual wanderer' sounded pretty darn good.  Because that's the reason I don't meet people- male or female, platonic or romantic. . . because I'm a drifter.  I always have been.  And it's because of the boredom.  If I could snag someone as artistic and intellectually driven as me who was content to let walk through the inchoate mists of life, I think I might lose a little boredom. 

In any case. 
No matter. 

No mater? 
Uh-oh. 
Yes, let's blame it all on the mother.

I want to be able to say that phrase in at least ten languages. 
Nick thinks that's silly. 
I don't care. 
He thinks it should be basically obvious to anyone you encounter whether or not you speak their language. And that if they speak English, they will recognize the English word, ""English?"".  

English is such a completely stupid language.  Just look at the combinations of letters we use. 

""one"".  Who in their right mind pronounces that as ""wuhn""?  If you're logical, it looks completely like, ""ohney"".  

In order to look at how the spelling equals the pronunciation, I like doing a repitition test. . . it should show how long it takes, and the evolution it takes, for a word that is spelled a certain way to begin to be pronounced another way.  So we're talking, they wrote it down when the sounds made sense, and then the word morphed.

"event","Three girls and a guy, the guy rather fancies one of the girls.  Another girl is meeting up with someone she met, getting to know him better while in a group - it's safer. 
And I sit on the side of a fountain watching, of course.  Not taking part in the conversation, because there is no fucking conversation. 
We're just sitting there.  The couple making the first cautious moves towards expressing their liking, and the girl waiting, phone in hand in case he calls back to ask for directions.  We haven't had any conversation other than, 'what are we doing, now?' and 'wow, I can't believe you are tipsy after one drink'.  
And So  I'm bored. 
They all want to go out to the bar, there's a dance club night.  I would Love to dance right now.  I haven't even done social dancing in quite some time, let alone any kind of formal dance.  But of course I can't even get in because I'm under 21 and they're carding at the door. 
Not one to impede on the rest of the group, and definitely not one to spend the rest of the evening sitting on a park bench with a group of people who aren't really talking to each other. . . it's time for me to leave.  

And then I have to face myself as I walk back down the darkened streets, muggy with late July nighttime air.  Face the fact that I can't love them.  I care about them, and I would help them in a time of need, I guess I can be compassionate towards them and their situations, but I can't love them.  
And of course, I feel superior.  
And then inferior. 
And then frustrated, angry, and annoyed.  

That when the next drunk on the street corner catcalls and makes a scene, I don't know what to do or say. 
I want to cry out about how sorry I am that I can't look at him and acknowledge his presence because it isn't safe.  ""it's not you, it's society,"" blunt over arching sentimental phrase.  There is something wrong with our gender equality.  And it's obvious by the fact that women DO have to treat all strange men as second class citizens when they are walking alone at night.  It works both ways. 
I don't know. 
That's not really the point. 


People always tell me that I ask for too much. . . that I'm expecting too much from other people.  That it's NOT natural to have engaging conversation with your peers on an average basis.  That it is actually quite uncommon to Ever have creative discourse with anyone under the age of 50, and that it's impossible to disclose thoughts or expose an inkling of vulnerability to anyone but your significant other. . . and even then it's not allowed, really.  Because you have to be ""strong"" for them or some other bullshit. 

And that might be the one thing that's really getting me down lately (and in the last year or so). . . I have no one that I feel safe being vulnerable with anymore.  Somehow I've convinced people that I'm completely and functionally independent and that I don't need them anymore.  I don't want anyone to feel like I need them.  Least of all the people that I have in the past.  My mom. . . I've gotten her to believe that I'm almost completely happy all the time and that I can fend for myself.  And Nick. . . I just don't want him to think I won't be able to handle it when he leaves.  AndI guess I also had gotten really sick of putting myself out there, feeling guilty about it, and then just feeling ashamed when in response to my admission of guilt I get some kind of idiotic reply that just makes me feel worse. .

And, as I'm complaining right now (as I often do) I'd also like to mention that I'm changing shape again, and it's just getting really flipping tedious.  I hate that.  When the fat from one particular area just kind of moves. . . .

I had a dream last night about being pregnant.  Suddenly being responsible for a human life developing inside my body.  Having to watch out and not accidentally consume harmful substances.  And being really frightened, because while Lynn may be able to have a baby and still go to college, I most definitely cannot.  I don't have the emotional maturity for that.  Hell, I won't be able to have children for a long time, just so I can get my own baggage taken care of first.  I started praying, in my dream, for a miscarriage, because apparently I really am against abortion.  And then I realized that there was absolutely no fucking way I could BE pregnant because I'm virgin.  And I told this to my mother, in my dream, and she simply said, ""Well, it's not the first time that's happened. . . ""  I told a doctor, and he said the same thing.  It was ludicrous- suddenly I'm a virgin mother who is about twenty times more sinful than Mary.  Eventually something happened that proved it wasn't that big of a deal, or something. 

The last three dreams I've had have been about being really really worried or concerned about something and then realizing that it totally was not a big deal at all if I just followed the truth and let things happen.  I mean, obviously that's probably the subconscious message. 

But unless the big thing I'm worried about is just generally my life, I have no idea what pertinent issue it could be.  
I've been having a lot of deja vu here, which usually is a good sign, but for the love of pete. . .  I feel like I've accomplished very, very little. 
But I guess that's okay. 
A popular tv show with everyone here is Scrubs, which /I think is funny, but it gets me down because the lead reminds me way too much of Jeff.  I liked Jeff.  I loved Jeff.  It just wasn't going to work and he still needs to grow up.  and I probably do too.  I still sort of wish I had closure over all that.  
But I wrote the postcard. . . that should be enough. 

Kirby co. came up in my meditation today.  It was awful.  I still can't stop thinking about last summer and feeling utterly violated and traumatized.  

I've been reading lots of plays.  I want to go back to school.    


And of course my mother keeps telling me that I need to go out and have fun, 'you're only young once'. . . blah blah. . . but I don't know how to have fun when I have no interesting or compelling friends, no laws to break or visible cultural revolutions to fight, no boyfriend or even potential casual hook-up lover, and can't legally drink alcohol or smoke pot.  Not to mention, of course, limited financial resources. 
Go have fun.  
What's that even supposed to mean?
what's fun? 
I feel extremely restricted here.  
The things I think of as fun are things other people think of as drawing attention to oneself in a possibly humiliating manner. 
But why shouldn't we jump into the fountain? 
Why not do cartwheels in the park?
Is it a crime to climb up on the pedestal and join the statues? 
And why, for the love of all that is good, do we have to be labeled as very close friends or lovers in order to share our deepest thoughts, feelings, and dreams, to stare at the sunset and contemplate God, and touch each other tenderly in moments of identification with humanity."

"event","In the last three hours, I have written three pages of my play, done some journaling, read some books, watched political satire, moisturized, messed around on the internet, and eaten a great deal of dark chocolate.  And I feel quite a bit better about life. 

I'm not sure if it's because of increased dopamine from the chocolate, or perhaps it's from having  just chilled by myself without worry of my roommate coming in . . . very chill.  

I'm learning, here, how important my solitude is to me.  as an individual and an artist.  Yes, I complain often about not being among people or what have you. . . but when I'm with people constantly, I start getting grumpy. . . and pissy.  and I'm mean to people.  And that's never good.  

I have a lot more control and objectivity over myself than I did six months ago.  And I think that's a step forward.  

I'm just tired all the time.  And that sucks.  Especially since. . . quite frankly There are not enough hours in the day as is. . . And I hate that I feel like there's not enough time. . . I suppose that might just be because I'm young and have no concept of time or whatever.  
Then again. . . what is time?  Time is illusory.  

J. Campbell has an idea that paradise is the cessation of time.  
I've forgotten what we decided Wallace Stevens idea of paradise was. . . I think it was about the same idea, just. . . that it shouldn't be like that.  Either way, I think. . . it's flipping paradise.  Whatever it ends up being is going to be something that completely fulfills your every desire.

In any case.  
I'm getting distracted from this task at the moment by a rousing episode of Hell's Kitchen.  W00t reality tv.  HOw silly we are. 

I miss school and the people of Ann Arbor.  Sigh. 
How many days?

(nick always says I shouldn't count the days. . . . I agree. . . but I can't help it. . . )

34 days.  Just over a month.  That's not bad at all.  5 more sundays.  I can do that.  It's not like this is terrible. . . not as bad as Fredonia. . . not Nearly as bad as last summer, either. . . . I mean, it's all good.  I get to read lots of plays. 

I vow to check out ten plays tomorrow.  W00t.

"event","I went to the at&t store on my lunch break yesterday to 'buy' a  new phone, due to the completely destroyed-after-three-years-of-use that had occurred to my other one. 
I found a nice one that was as simple as you can get these days (which means, still has twenty five features I don't need or want) and paid for it, etc. Whatever. 
But since only half of my contacts had been stored on the SIM card, I had to go through my contact information on Outlook to bring my new phone up to date. 
I was surprised by how many phone numbers were in my archives. 
MOstly, surprised that they are numbers for people I haven't talked to in a few years.  People whose numbers I took out of my phone to resist the temptation of calling them out of the blue and rekindling something disappointing. 

In a way, I feel more secure having those numbers somewhere in my life.  If I ever for some strange reason need to get in touch with them, I will probably be able to. . . unless they've changed their phone number. . . a huge possibility with people my age as they move All of their stuff out of their parents' house and buy their own communications services etc. 

But at one point, I thought enough of these people to make sure I had a way to get in touch with them should I lose their information in some way or another. 

I have people in there from freshman year of college that I haven't even thought about in almost a year.  

Ugh.  Whenever I think or hear the phrase 'freshman year of college' I remember mine.  And can't believe how I made it through.  
Everything from circa February 2005 to March 2007. . . .I feel so much weaker now than I was then.  There were so many. . . not only challenges, but just generally shitty conditions. 

Maybe I feel less able to confront those sorts of situations now because they've been going on so long. . . I've all but given up.  Or maybe it's something more positive than that. Perhaps I just find feeling completely desperate and pained to be unacceptable.  Not something to just take and deal with. . . perhaps I have given myself license to be happy.  
And I suppose it IS more difficult to be happy, peaceful, and productive than it is to be enduring and yearning.  

I don't know.  The whole concept of time just escapes me.  And the concept of non-time is even worse.  

I'm currently a fan of Joseph Campbell.  One thing he says is that God is a metaphor.  I like that mode of thought.  I think that was one of the things I've forgotten in the last few months.  I've tried to make God something, when in reality, it is Definitely not my place to define what God is.  Campbell also writes about how when the metaphor becomes fact, it is dangerous.  I.e., we have warring factions just because we can't agree on a single word for God.  
I think anytime metaphor becomes fact, it would be pretty damn dangerous.  
""You're on fire!"" . . . . I mean, if you said that to someone who was really, you know, doing really well at something, or looking really good, or totally speeding through a complicated task. . . and then suddenly they burst into flames. . . . Dangerous. 
Talk about a major 'oops' moment. 
You would have to douse the flames to save the person. . . but in doing so, would they then be unable to continue to do the thing that won them the compliment/death threat?  
That's tricky.


I've been abstinent from caffeine for almost 5 days.  It's out of control.  It makes me want to take up smoking.  I'm flipping addicted to stimulants.  
I'm confused about brain chemistry. 

Then again, I'm confused about many things. 

I have to go to the office today to work on enlarging and photocopying scripts.  It's a task that promises to be a laugh a minute.  I am thankful for a flexible work schedule on Saturdays.  Besides the having to be at the theatre at 630 thing, I can work the other stuff in whenever I see fit.  And that's really all I'm asking for, you know?  A little flexibility.  I think one of the major reasons I would not work well in an office the rest of my life is that you have to be there from 9am-5pm, and you can't sit on the floor.  And then of course there's the whole having to dress nicely thing. . . 
but for now, it's okay.  I guess it has to be. 

I haven't eaten yet today, maybe I should go do that. 
hmmm.

"event","Lately, walking down the street I'll think of something amazing that needs to be said.  When I get an opportunity to say it, it leaves me. 
Like a newly hatched bird that has fallen to the ground. 
Nothing to be done. 


I'm trying to read like 20 plays a week to find something I can direct in the next year or two.  I don't know when I'll ever get a chance to browse a library of all the most significant works of drama compiled in one location again.  
I just finished The History of W. Civilization (abridged), and am currently reading God of Vengeance.  
Neither of which I could or should do.  Ah well. 
I'm afraid of directing anything commonly acclaimed as brilliant because I could easily screw it up and be seen as erringly pretentious. 
Like with the piece I AD'd last fall.  And it ended up being terrible because the director had this pretentious vision of how surreal and mind-altering it was going to be. . . this idea of trying to make it sublime by telling the actors to be entirely grounded in realism.  And it didn't really work.  
Then again, maybe it did and I just couldn't tell.  I suppose that happens sometimes. 

I think I had an anxiety attack last night.  But it was weird because it was entirely physical.  
I was suddenly sweating and shivering and unable to keep my balance and swallowing profusely and couldn't see straight.  I felt like I was on some kind of strange drug.  A drug without the euphoria.  Not really worth it, in my opinion.  
It subsided slightly, but then I had to go to strike/load-in after I house managed. . . and I was thoroughly useless.  I felt awful.  
I couldn't keep my balance and my stomach felt sick and I had to concentrate on breathing while I screwed down floorboards.  Not really safe. 

I went to sleep with my hand on my face, soaking out the terrible negative energy.  And I learned that the power of suggestion is even more extreme in my body than I thought it was.  My stomach hurt, but I knew I couldn't vomit because then I'd lose the meds I had just put in me to  take away the headache. . . so as a test I started to tell my brain a joke about how I assuredly had a gangrenous toe.  
My toe began throbbing. 
I knew I was making it up, and still my fucking toe started to hurt. 
Seriously. 
How insane is that?


I had a few dreams last night. . . one where 14 black children of various ages followed me home because they had no where to sleep and no caretaker.  One where I was on the stage at Whiting, rehearsing nutcracker again. . . playing clara in the first act and chinese solo in the second.  Which is mildly absurd. 

I miss dancing and singing so much. I'm not alive anymore it feels.  I don't even do any formal acting.  
And I don't have normal, real conversations with people right now. . . all the interns are. . . bland.  We don't talk about anything but work and funny stories.  And whenever I bring up thougths, feelings, political leanings, or religious beliefs, it's an immediate shut-down.  Which is sad. 
I still often have the thought, 'why can't I just be happy like them?'.  Well.  I don't think that's the question anymore. 
I don't know what the question is. 

I'm a little lost at the moment.  It's not like being in a cave or climbing up a mountain or walking through the tundra.  It's more like having come out of the woods, crossed a short little clearing, and then seeing that the trees are there again. 
Better yet. 
It's like walking through a cornfield. 
Yes.  That's what it's like.
Walking through a cornfield in September. 


I remember having adventures as a younger person. 
I remember being part of a rehearsal process. 
I remember- sightreading in the back room with Matt and Irene. 
Damn.  I just remember being creative. 
I'm an artist. 
I can't handle this whole being in an office all day thing. 
And unfortunately the performing arts aren't extremely conducive individually. 

So for now.  
Lots of reading. 
Writing.
Sketching.
And singing in the shower. 

i suppose. 

I don't know. 

I think right now I might just possibly be try8ing to procrastinate.  I need to go grocery shopping and clean the apartment a bit. 
But I would also like to go down to the ritz and read books and sit in the sun. 
Decisions decisions. 

Ohwell. 

this is long enough anyway for narrative about mundane things.

"event","- There is a strange amount of parallel between Florida Studio Theatre and the Boarshead Theatre in Lansing.  We have extremely similar seasons, apparently. 

They did Metamorphoses here two years ago. . . very similar to the ""tales from ovid"" Malcolm did last year. . . (well, granted, I'd say the productions were almost the same, a few different stories, maybe- but all Roman mythology) 

They did it with a pool of water on the stage.  
This gives me so many ideas. 
Why not use a pool of water on your stage?
I mean, besides the cost, possibility for damage and danger and . . . .ah well. 
Water on stage is better than blood on stage. 

And speaking of blood onstage. . . I'm putting blood on stage in the play I'm writing.  lots of it. 

I have a new plan for life. . . one of those that usually lasts about three days and then fails 

I want to wake up 3 hours before work to work-out, do my own creative work, and meditate before having to get ready to go.  I think it could work. 
The only problem is that . . . i don't know. 
I guess it's not really a problem.  It just involves getting up around 6 am. 

This becomes a problem only because I've been having a really, really hard time getting up in the mornings lately.  Not in the ""ugh, I'm tired, and my body hurts and is tired, too,"" kind of way, but as in, my eyes can't focus and it takes every ounce of willpower and strength I possess to be able to sit upright and stare at the wall for half a minute.  And the effort of this is so much that I invariably fall over backwards back into my pillow. 

I generally have been able to force myself awake and moving if necessary even as early as 4 am after three hours sleep.  It takes effort, of course, but it's nothing compared to this. . . 

And then 8 hours later, I'm so lethargic I can't see straight (again with the effect of sight. . . hmm)

I want to blame the medication I'm on. . . but it also might be my eating?  I'm eating too much or too little.  . or not sleeping enough, could always be something. 


I also find it somewhat difficult to be constantly surrounded by people. 
right now I'm not, and that's nice. 
But at the same time I feel like I'm alienating myself from everyone else. 
Monday night is the only time when everyone in the company is off.

ah well. 
I have so much to read!
So much to learn. 
So much to do. 

It's all very heady. 
mm. 

I should do something meaningful, now.

I had a distrubing series of dreams last night. . . . 
The worst one involved my parents having a new baby or something, and it had failing health, so they needed to perform some kind of healing ritual.  What they ended up doing was tying my brother down, wrapping him in cloths, and using a knife to cut his heart out.  I didn't see what they did with it, all I saw was david with a huge hole in his chest, not dead yet, but shaking and convulsing in pain.  I screamed at my father to just kill him, as he was in so much pain and was going to die anyway, but it would be better to put him out of his misery.  He said to me, ""no, I'm not helping him die, he's going to have to do it himself.""  I was appalled.  I ran out of the room.  Later, we  put a garbage bag with his mangled body into the trash.  I mean. . . seriously?  wtf.  The rest of the dream involved me finding random creepy people who wanted to do me harm, and then I had to evade them myself because I couldn't very well call on my family, who had just turned into crazy murderous lunatics.  It was scary.  anbd crazy.  And Im' So freaking glad that it was just a dream.  
Holy shit. 

Anyway. 


I've been wasting alot of time. 
I wanted to wake up a little earlier today and get some exercize so that I don't keep getting atrophied muscles and fat build up.  Blah.  But then I couldn't keep myself awake. . . I think the dreaming itself was an exertion upon my sleep.  So I've been wasting time on the computer.  But I have to be to work in an hour. . . so.  
The new plan is to move around a little bit to give my body the illiusion of having to do some physical activity, and then I will take a shower and get ready to go.  Sa-weet.  Okey. 

Later."

"event","Yes, I will be complaining shortly.  Yes, there will be tiffs and personality clashes.  Yes, my co-workers and bosses will be utterly infuriating. . . . 


But as of NOW.  Could I possibly have landed a sweeter deal? 

Spending all summer in sunny Sarasota, which is a beautifully adorable little town on the Gulf of Mexico.  The theatre most def has a huge budget since it has an 80% renewed subscription base filled with old people who live in the area expressly for the cultural benefits of it all.  
I'm living in an adorable yellow house less than a ten minute drive from the beach with a stage manager, an administrative person, and another dramaturg- so you know the place is clean and well kept up.  there are palm trees and little geckos everywhere and the ocean is beautiful. 
it is also very hot.  
However. 
The theatre spaces are great and the administrative offices are artistically disheveled in an extraordinary way, the unfinished industrial ceilings painted burgundy and green and copper ornaments decorating the mishmash of desks every which way.  A library, a music room, three large studios, three performance spaces.  
Shows going up and down constantly. 

My room is about the same size as the one at the co-op last year, which means smaller than desirable, but quite cozy and not too big or small (if you're in the right mindset).  Free housing, a stipend, a library card, a personal computer workstation, free temporary membership to the Y downtown, more fun shops and restaurants and amazing FOUNTAINS than you can shake a stick at.  . . . 

And nice people.  I will get irritated sometimes. . . . one girl reminds me a little bit of Erin, but maybe I can figure out some way of managing that sort of personality in my life. . . not many males- mostly female people, but maybe that's perfectly okay.  

I'm tired out of my mind.  I haven't slept in almost 36 hours. . . or at least not really- I don't consider 15-25minute cat naps on airplanes and airports where I'm jostled from my sleep every so often when I remember I'm in public AND suspended thousands of feet in the air. . . . 

And by tired out of my mind I mean: not thinking properly perhaps.
I'm excited. 

I'm also making a bazillion typos that I have to go back and correct just because I happen to be exhausted.  Darn. 

I need to get myself some sleeeeeeeeeeeep.  
Soon. 

We're having a house meeting soon, though, so I have to stay up for that.  But then, bed. . . . and then!  going to my first day on the job.  Wo.  I am mildly apprehensive. . . but mostly looking forward to it.  I hope I don't stress out too much. 
That would not be ideal. 


Alright, well. 
Okay. 

Anyway. 

I'm leaving now. 
Just thought I'd tell you how sweet of a deal I scored. 
And how excited I am to be alive at this moment. 


Alright. 
Good night!!!"

"event","Sweet vapors 
hold in the balance
of a man and a woman
no better than the other
weighed separately or together. 

She sits at his breast and bows her head, 
But he bows his, too, in gentle submission. 

To a whim or a whimsy, 
Fate or a dream. 
With the counsel of angels
Poised each on one wing. 
Tablet in hand, and a rose in their teeth, 
Their wings beating softly
Their heads form wreath of light 
That shines intensely, intently.  

Perfect equality
Balance of nations, 
Years of history thrown into the wind,
To be carried away. 

Balanced on angel wingtips
Precariously safe
For now, it's a moment 

As one wing bends, another springs forth, 
Non humanoid are these who support
man and woman
In perfect balance. 
No greater, no lesser, 

they meet on a raincloud, 
and don't need to look down."

"event","Yesterday, the ragbag professor who plays harmonica and washboard (simultaneously! wo.) on the diag played the march from The Nutcracker.  It made me nostalgic. 

ARTillery is almost an official student group, might be getting a stellar performance space for this coming fall, and otherwise is doing well.  

I have to unplug cable boxes for my ghost roommate, so that a delivery service can pick them up and take them back to comcast.  It's a pain.  I have to stay in the apartment until they come, which might not be until 1pm.  And, one of the cables will not unscrew from the wall.  It's really, really obnoxious. 


I called J yesterday, to patch things up and set some ground rules so to speak.  He didn't answer and hasn't called me back, which leads me to believe that A) he knows exactly why I would be upset with him and B) he is a coward.  Which leads me to the conclusion that if I call again in a week and don't get a reply, again, he's gone forever.  I don't need any more cowards in my life who don't respect me.  That's all. 

In other news about male persons, I had a visitor two nights ago who sat by me while we watched a movie.  It was supremely nice after a couple days of solitude. 

And: Nick's coming back to the states in less than a week!!!!  !!! !!!!!!!!     . . . . !
I'm going to have to drug him with coffee to keep him awake, but otherwise. . . 

Yes.  Anyway.  I'm moving back out of Ann Arbor on Saturday.  I'll spend a little over a week with my family and then ship off to Sarasota.  Part of me is of the opinion that my willing transplanting of myself so many times in such a short period is really unhealthy and could lead to some pretty crazy stressy things on a subconscious level. 
On April 28, I moved from the co-op to Grand Blanc, on May 2 I moved from Grand Blanc to my Apartment, on June 2 I'll move from the apartment to Grand Blanc, and on June 11 I move from Grand Blanc to Sarasota.  It's crazy.  Lots of short term residences. But that's alright, I suppose. 

The last few days I've lacked the motivation to do much of anything, although I have gotten some reading done.  I guess I'm just moving at a slower pace than I would if I were working 40 hours a week or going to school full time.  Slower pace as in, waking up late, lounging about with coffee or tea, doing journaling and napping and sitting and meditating, cooking small meals, taking walks, reading. . . all in all. . . I'm on vacation right now, anyway.  Why should I be more productive than what my desires tell me? 


I learned something really interesting about the nature of my personality. 
Maybe Ill talk about it at some point. 
Maybe not. 

As for now, Toast.  With double-cream goat cheese.  
Maybe a little music in the background. 
Knitting. . . sitting in the sun. 
I'll need to workout at some point, so I don't get any fatter than I have to. 
Take things as they come. 


It will be alright."

Anyway, I finally got around to watching the first Ginger Snaps sequel today, and all in all, I liked it quite a bit. I appreciated how the filmmakers chose to go in a different direction from the original in the way that lycanthropy is now used as a metaphor for drug addiction. There really isn't all that much werewolf action in the film, but I found myself not caring that much due to the clever writing and great performance from Emily Perkins. The one major problem I had with the film was the annoying character of Ghost, who oddly enough I liked at first but as more and more of the film focused on her, I found myself wanting Bridget to eat her already. The werewolf threat gets clumsily pushed aside and Ghost becomes the star of the show. I also hated the ending. I do not want poor Bridget to be consigned to that fate worse than death. So basically, it's 2/3 good and one third off the rails. I'd still give it a solid *** out of *****.

One last note: It's bullshit that the always likeable Brendan Fletcher gets killed early on and never mentioned again by anyone, and it's also bullshit how the film kind of sets up the identity of the male werewolf chasing Bridget as some kind of mystery and then just forgets about it near the end and never reveals anything. I don't like loose ends."

Anyway, despite my present inability to vote, I still remain somewhat of a political junkie. I watch news shows, read articles online, and generally try to stay informed about current events. That said, all the candidates for Florida offices this year suck balls. Even the democrats. Most are pretty right leaning, and the rest are impotent pushovers. As for the GOP, Rick Scott is up for Governor, and he seems like a complete tool who believes that &quot;the free market&quot; is god and can fix everything. It's telling he's a former insurance executive. I'll be so sad when this asshole is my governor. He also quite resembles Reverend Kane from Poltergeist 2. Marco Rubio is up for senate, and he's a hardcore teabagger idiot, who as a bonus is an ultra religious conservative.

It's times like these that I really wish I hadn't been born in a damn red state. It really, really sucks to be a much of a liberal as I am and be surrounded by racists and religious conservatives. The actual Central Florida area where I live isn't too bad for that, but once you get further out it turns into hardcore Deliverance country. No wonder Rubio is up by like 20 points in the polls. Ugh."

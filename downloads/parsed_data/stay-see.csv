"event","<u>I'm a mess, I guess. 
It's what I asked for, it's what I needed. 
Well, you know me better than that, 
or at least you did and something happened. 
But once again something's happened. 
The confidence you held in us is the rope we almost hung ourselves with. </u>
At times I wonder if we really took the steps to break right through it. 
I know that there were better days, but to see the light and to feel the rays. 
Life was always back and forth and we were idling or making useless progress. 
Waiting for the rain to stop. 
Destination: beautiful. 
Seems that I'm still waiting for the sun. 
Someday will come back to us, if you're willing let it go. 
Why won't you just let this be your sun? 
It seems like yesterday we had the world our way. 
But some say we're heading for destruction.

I'll ask you ""What in the world should we do?"" 
This light is green our break is through. 
Are we not trying or are we trying too hard? 
Well, you know I never want to miss, 
I hold on tight and reminisce. 
But it's bittersweet to me. 
When time stands still as it's trapped inside 
the letterbox you gave back to me. 
But I'm the one who keeps on reading. 
But I'm the one who wants to let it go. 
I'm the first to speak. 
You're the last to know. 
Another scene that we're creating, 
<u>I need to know if we're still making useless progress.</u>"

"event","just found my old spice girls cd. oh yea... im set for a couple weeks...

and fuck you if you say you never liked the spice girls.

<b>EDIT</b>: I think it is necessary to elaborate on my love for the spice girls. When i was in 4th grade, i was CRAZY obsessed. It really was unhealthy... for the following reasons.

- Two FULL walls in my room were covered with spice girl posters, and when i say covered, i mean you could see NO wall.
- I bought the ugliest pink sparkly shirt just b/c it said ""girl power"" on it.
- I used to have actual dreams that the spice girls came to my house and asked me if i wanted to be the 6th member, and i would agonize over what my spice name would be.
- They had a concert on pay-per view... and i BEGGED my parents all day to order it. Then i found out that it doesn't work where i live, and i CRIED, I litterally shed tears.
- I saw the movie ""spice world"" at least 10 times BEFORE it was released on video. Then i probably saw it another 20 times.
- I wore bellbottoms and platforms.
- One day some random girl in my class told me that she thought posh spice was a snob, and i almost threw down... almost.

you can call me crazy, you can call me obsessed... but nothing will ever take away my love for the spice girls.

posh, sporty, scary, baby, and ginger... R.I.P"

As a runner in a relay race passes the baton while never missing a moment of forward progress, you too, have tried to keep things moving along while dealing with a meltdown of your own. Chances are that you've not taken the time you need to process some current event. Someone who is very near to you has already shot an arrow into the deep blackness of the nighttime sky. Now it is time for you to shoot yours. Let a piece of your imagination soar along with your arrow."

"event","Today was really awful.
I got out of bed really early because my mom was yelling at me.

I feel sad, because Sarah and Britney are complete bitches. They told everyone I have an STD, just because I slept with both of their boyfriends on Saturday night.

I'm so angry. Paul is grounded. AGAIN! And I'm not allowed to see him. EVER. It's just NOT FAIR. I hate my mom and I wish she was dead. This wouldn't happen if I was allowed to live with dad.

Last night I had to masturbate twenty times. I'm so horny. Click here to see my website.

I want to tell the world that I love you all! You're all so special to me!

I am really annoyed with those assholes at _are_you_hotter_than_us_?, because I am so much cuter than them, and those photos don't do me justice. They can't reject me, so I'm starting my own rating community. Click here to join (the first five applicants are automatically accepted).

Today, I got a digital camera! Yes! Here's some photos of my girlfriend in the nude (but don't tell her that I've posted them here - she'll kill me! Har har.)

I want to say thanks to the world for absolutely fucking nothing! You all suck. I feel so alone, no one ever reads this journal, or even comments to let me know that I'm not suffering alone. It's cold here, and I want to die, but I cannot figure out how many of you to take with me when I go.

I went to the doctor yesterday, and he said I have a terrible skin disease which prevents me from coming into contact with other human beings. And bipolar disorder.

You should all do this quiz! It's amazingly accurate. You just put in your name and birthday, and it will tell you you're a moron.

That's enough for now. But I'll leave you with some naked photos of myself. (Not safe for work - teehee).

I really didnt wanna do this but i think its good for me and i need to. As most of you may know, me and michael broke up thursday and this time its for good. Now, i'm not gunna lie and say that breaking up hadn't crossed my mind a lot of the past couple months cause it did. We were always fighting and had too high of expectations for each other. We forgot how to have fun together and just enjoy each others company. Our relationship got too caught up in technicalities. Now, towards the end i wasn't really happy. I was content but i wasn't overly happy. This was of course when we were fighting, because when we weren't things were still awesome. Like he said, our relationship was 60% fighting and 40% fun.. and that just doesn't cut it. Now, this is probably the hardest thing i've ever had to deal with... and i think to myself ""why is it so hard, you weren't happy towards the end anyways?"" and when I think this all I can come up with is memories. I wanted so badly for things to be the way they used to be that I tried to force him to love me like he used to. The reason the feelings weren't as strong as before is because we were always fighting, and we were always fighting because the feelings weren't as strong.. if that makes sense. I did a couple stupid things throughout our relationship that I have big time regrets for.. and im sure that had a lot to do with stuff. I wish that I had just accepted the way our relationship was without always pushing to make it better. Nothing was ever good enough, he was never good enough, until he was gone. Now, the first time we broke up it only lasted a day. I remember it like it was yesterday.. it was a friday and all that day in school we acted totally normal around each other.. but it was just weird to kiss him because.. we weren't going on. That night was joeys party and i went with the girls. I was there for an hour or so before he got there and when he got there we went upstairs to talk. It didn't really go well and he got frustrated and left. I thought that would be the end of our conversation for the night but when we got back downstairs everything was perfect again. We were talking, laughing, hugging, and i ended up leaving with him. We went back to his house and I just remember his pouring his heart out and telling me how sorry he was for breaking up with me. I remember him telling me that he was at his dads and Tom Brady came on TV and he said ""my girlfriend loves tom brady"" and then realized i wasnt his girlfriend.. and i guess that really bothered him. I was sooo happy to have him back it was unreal. I was gunna loosen up, and our relationship was gunna go back to the way it was. WRONG. He still didn't love me enough, didn't do enough nice stuff for me, and i would always be on his case. The breakup threats started coming back and it happened again. We broke up, still talked on the phone, talked online, talked in school. Then i did another stupid thing and he was mad at me. I remember him freaking out online and telling me we were done forever and i was a wreck. I called and called until he finally picked up his phone. I begged, litterally begged for forgiveness. After a couple hours we were laughing, and talking and everything was perfect. Granted he was still upset with me, but i was just glad that it wasn't a last goodbye. He went to california, called me a lot, i called him. I remember he had told me that he was handling the breakup so well because he never planned on us being apart for good anyway. I saw him in school when he came back and ran up and gave him a kiss. I didnt even realize I had done it but he didnt mind. We walked over to his locker and he grabbed my arms and said ""do you.. uh.. wanna be my girlfriend again?"" The biggest smile came over my face you couldn't even believe it. It was like we had never broken up because we both had a feeling we'd be getting back together. I had a slight sense of what it was to lose him, or at least.. i thought i did. ""Im gunna change, things are gunna be better, it's just gunna be fun!"" But it wasn't.. i went back to the same old stuff. I had never really been without him, he was mine for good, and im gunna make things perfect. Then on thursday it happened again. It's over, but this time a word that i was only familiar with in a good way was heard. ""forever"". It wasn't the ""I'll love you forever"" that i had been wanting to hear for so long, it was ""we're done, forever"". I didn't cry, I didn't think about it, i went on with my weekend hoping he wasn't serious. I knew it was really over when he had girls over on friday. When we broke up the last time we were still mindful of what would hurt each other, but this time we weren't. Everything was gone for good and i knew it, and NOW i felt what it was really like to lose him. Before was just a tiny bit of the pain that i would go through. The only thing in the entire world thats worse about breaking up with someone you love, is when they're completely unsensitive to your feelings about it. We talked last night and it really didn't go well. I wanted to hear something, anything nice.. but nothing came. While i was sitting there, crying, thinking about all the good times we had. He was sitting there, angry, thinking about all the fights, all the arguements, all the letdowns. I wanted him so badly to think about the girl he used to love, about the relationship we used to have, but it just wasn't happening. Theres absolutely no better feeling in the world then knowing that someone loves you and cares about you, and theres no worse feeling then knowing that you had it, and then fucked it up. Up until about 10 months everything was *perfect*, in my eyes anyways.I have no many memories of just laying on my couch holding each other until we'd both doze off. I remember the first night when we were really comfortable with each other, we rented cruel intentions and the ""curling iron movie"" and then pigged out on chinese food. We drove up to dartmouth to watch his sister playing ""rocket summer"" the whole way up, we celebrated birthdays, christmas, everything. I left for a month in the summer and we had such an unbelievable night before I left. The night i came back was even better though. I remember going up to gunstock on valentines day and then the candlelight dinner. I remember leaving kerrys new years party early and going back to his house to bake a cake. I remember all those car rides home, even the angry ones. I remember our sleepover, we came home from the mall and it was too snowy for you to bring me home  so your mom said i could sleep there. We spent the whole night playing scrabble w/ your mom and steve and watching a movie. Then you tucked me in, and woke me up with a kiss. We shoveled and played in the snow all the next day. I remember the day we hung out the last time we broke up, we went to the mtn and then went back to your house, made quesedillas... it was just so much fun. You brought me flowers when i had a bad day.I made you a list of 100 reasons why i love you. Theres absolutely no denying that at one point we were in love, you could feel it. The way we could just lay on my couch for endless nights and it wouldn't get old. We would listen to and sing endless love in the dark. We watched phonebooth and you know what happened =) We made so many mistakes but soo many things went right. Theres absolutely no convincing me that you weren't meant to be in my life, because i know it. When I met you, you were a cocky little asshole who wanted to get some. I saw something in you that i couldn't see in anyone else. You weren't just that cocky jerk that you tried to act like sometimes. You were ""that boy"".. my dream boy. Everything I ever wanted. You actually loved me when I thought that nobody could. I could talk to you about everything, you were my best friend, and you always said I was yours. When things were great, they were great. I always got that feeling when I was with you, nothing else in the world mattered, just you and I. It felt so good to hear the ""i love you""s that thats all I wanted to hear. I wanted you to tell me that you wanted to be with me forever and that just wasn't happening. Thats not the way things work. We're in highschool, we're supposed to have fun, and it took so long for me to realize that. Senior year, it's time to have fun, and I know this. I know you go through phases where you just wanna have fun and everything. I know that I messed things up and they're over for good. I just hope that you don't forget all the good times we've had, and I hope that you don't purposely try to hurt me by telling me you never loved me, and by telling me all the bad things you think about me. I want you to think of me as the person that deep down you know i am. I think so highly of you no matter what you do. I saw, and i know that a beautiful person you are and no matter how many mean things you say to me, or things you say to me to make me cry, my opinion of you will never change. I'm so proud of you, what a person you are, what a person you've become since i've first met you. You amaze me and i know your going to have such an awesome life. I'm sorry that our time together had to end, and i'm really going to miss it, but i'll never let go of all the good times we had together. When i think of those times i get such a warm fuzzy feeling, because those were the times that I was truly happy. I will forever be changed because of who you are, and what you were to me. It's going to be hard for me to get over you, but I want you to be happy and if your happy without me, then so be it. I hope we can still be good friends because we get along so good it would be a shame not to be. Thank you for every kiss, every hug, every i love you, every touch, and every smile. In the end it's all the little things i took for granted that i'll miss the most. Thank you for a great year michael conway, you'll never truly understand what you meant to me, because i never showed it like i wish i had. Goodbye michael patrick conway..

"event","It's hopeless now
It seems that there's nothing left
I don't care anymore, this failure that surrounds me I accept
Because I can't be all the things I want to without you
And it won't help to watch you smile without me
And begging to hold on,
I desperately try to remove memories of moments
that I thought you were happy
And I pretend not to care
I hope you're miserable without me
But that's not love nor true
You could not be better off now
I'm waiting for the day when I'd forget you
But I don't know if its right to hate this through
When you're the only one I see who truly keeps me here
But all you've left me is alone
And I miss you now
When all I can do is wish it wasn't this way, wish it wasn't too late
So is it wrong to ask for a second chance?
To prove my regret
To make up for the world
It's hopeless now, so hopeless to forget that there's no one here for me
Because I can't be all the things I want to without
And I'm waiting for the day when I'd be with you
Forever it will be, a dream that's always short of true
When you're the only one I see, who truly keeps me here
But all you've left me is alone



toooooo trueeeee.

"event","i bought my prom dress today. SO RANDOM! I was planning on going to all these different places and stuff, and i was getting all excited about looking so i was like ""mom, lets just go down to yours truly"". So we go, and i pick up a catalogue and find the perfecccttt dress. I've been drooling over it for months. They only had the dress in one color, and it was the one i wanted so i was like ""ahh, fine, order it!!"" The only thing that sucks is even if i HATE it i cant return it. I'm sure i'll love it though, its gorgeous. I wish they had it at the store so i could try it on but.. they dont have ANY cute dresses there. lol. Im going back in about 5 or 6 days to pick it up.. and i gotta see how it fits and if it needs alterations. Alex is coming with me and shes gunna order her dreaamm dresss. =) Ahh, i love it. im such a dork lol. maybe i'll post a picture of my dress later. maaaaaaybe... if enough people wanna see it =)"

ahhh.. i need a vacation so bad. I need to get away, i dont care if its just for a weekend. I cant wait until I go to Florida, or til i go back to italy. i REALLY cant wait til i go back to italy.. its so.. healthy. I feel like last year i came back so different. Well maybe not THAT different, but its just such a great trip. Its very 'cleansing'. I guess i have a little vacation this weekend, an overnight retreat in the middle of the fucking woods. AWESOMEEE. blahhhh."

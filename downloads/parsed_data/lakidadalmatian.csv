I'll stick up for myself when I'm put down (or, at least, I'll try). I'm actually going to eat too. No more waiting until someone makes me eat. I'm losing more weight and it's disgusting.

I went to the library on Friday and checked out 11 books. I have 5 books left to read. But I kind of don't want to read them anymore because I'm scared of the covers and then I get nightmares about witches trying to kill me, vampires, murders, and such.... o_O

This morning, my dad started yelling at me about how I don't behave and how he doesn't want me in band my senior year. Whatever. It's not like I'll still not go to Marching Band practices or hang out in the band room.

Last night was my flute recital. I played Adante in C Major by Mozart. Oh my goodness. I sucked so much. It was horrible. I kept getting lost (I'm still having trouble trying to count and play at the same time). Then, I came in wrong once. And for my cadenza, I did a trill on the wrong note and I didn't even play all the right notes. My jaw was quivering and everything. It just really sucked."

I still have English homework that's due for tomorrow. I'll probably do it like at the beginning of class. Or something like that. Not like I can though. I have it second period and the homework is like looking up quotes in a book, I think.

I still have the whole back side of the Chem. worksheet. And I have no idea how to figure out the problems. I don't know how to figure out the change in heat. U_U And I doubt Mindy even had time to try to figure it out.

I didn't do like 2 math problems. I think I'm screwed in that class. Because of the score I got on my last test. I got a 44% on the last test and we have another test on Friday. I hope I get a good grade on the test. I have a 70.4% in that class right now.

The good thing is... I did my spanish homework while waiting for Jackie's flute lesson to end today. =)



The bad thing was... the AP review was horrendous. When I was trying to pay attention, others were talking. It bothers me when I can't hear because others are talking. It doesn't help me, either, that I'm a horrible notes taker. =/


The highlight of the night may have been when Andrew sent me a song. It's very pretty. It's Bach's 1st unaccompanied Cello Suite. Either that or when I went to flute lessons and my tone wasn't as disgusting as it usually is. ^_^  I'm getting better. Yay.



My mom said that it sounds like I have turberculosis. But the doctor said it sounds like bronchitis? Eh. I don't know. Nor do I really care."

I wish I sat next to Mari and Minji though. It looked like they had a great time. When Ladies Jazz went to perform, Jovany, Nathaniel, and I were the only ones left at our table. Jazz 2 went to warm up. We performed. I didn't play for most of the songs. I got lost in Blues in the Closet and St. Thomas; I played as much as I had memorized. I couldn't really see my music from the stand because I left my glasses at home. Swing Kids were great. Minji, Brooke, Linda, and I danced during their first few songs. Jazz 1 was awesome. I danced with Brooke during their last song. It was pretty fun. I got a ride home from Sarah Zoobi. Got home at around 12:40-ish. It was great. =)

Sadly, I didn't have a great time. I probably would've had a better time if Lucy were there. Or if I had gone to Spanish Camp instead. I wanted to go but I couldn't because of A Night of Jazz. U_U"

I miss Arbuckle too though. I miss Mr. Conder and watching Michael Jackson music videos in his class. I miss that first day of school when I thought Vianey was held back just because she was taller than everyone.

Bernal Jazz Band was good. I've only heard them once before. And Swing Kids were awesome, as usual.

Near the end, I went to Carl's Jr with Kilani's family, David, and Nathaniel. It was fun. When we came back, they and others took stuff down and loaded it into cars. I had nothing to do. So I talked to a few people. And talking to Mrs. Murphy was fun. Though, I don't like that she asked me if Nathaniel and I were going out. Partly because Kilani laughed as she heard that. But yeah. It doesn't look like we're going out. Though, it probably looks like we were because I was wearing his jacket (he wouldn't take it back). So. yeah.

Afterwards, I walked back with Nathaniel and his dad to their house, then, they gave me a ride home.

Bye."

But..
I don't know.
I guess I'm just being stupid.
=/
Headaches make me feel depressed.
When I put on eyeliner, my headache got a bit worse.
=/
Whatever.


Oh. Lucy.
I still can't find my Chem outline.
I have to start it over again.
Argh.
I've very mad about that.

I hate how I lose things.
Grr."

"event","So..
today was saddening.
But I won't go into that.
(and it just so happens that the song I'm listening to is saddening. Coincidence??)

Anyway..
School was okay-ish.
Kristi and I were like laughing the whole time during break and lunch. It was quite fun.
Lol.
Yeah..

I brought my box to school today.
Kristi was the only one who looked inside of it.
Only because I let her.
Nathaniel wanted to know what was inside.
I wouldn't tell him.
Lol.
(If I told him, he'd probably think I was crazy. =/ )

I had a flute lesson today.
It was very exciting.
My flute teacher, Sarah, said that I'm a really good flute player.
Lol.

Afterwards, I finished writing the rough draft for my essay for English.
Then, I practiced my flute.
For THREE HOURS!!
Because I lost track of time.

And now..
I think I'm gonna do my spanish homework.
Then, possibly eat some cookies.
Then take a shower.
And go to bed.
Possibly before 10 PM??

I hope so."

"event","Yesterday was fun.
Practice sucked. Just because pit didn't finish setting up until 30 minutes into practice.

The bus ride to the competition was okay. I sat with Mindy at first. Then, Jackie switched with her. Talking to Jackie, Brooke, and Joe was fun.

The competition was better than I thought it would be. I was glad I didn't  have to play the pit break this time. I have to learn to play in at tempo for the next show though. =[

In the stands, Daniela and I were talking while bands were performing. It was quite fun. She and I were all like ""Go Ashley!!"" before Oak Grove performed. They're show was awesome, by the way.

On the way home, I sat next to Jackie. And she and I talked to Brooke. Then, Jackie and Brooke switched seats. But all three of us still talked. We talked about love. It was quite a sad subject. Jackie was being all happy about it. I was about to cry. And Brooke was just sad.

When we got back home, I had to put the pit stuff away. But I never saw the vibes get out of the truck so I just stood there. Until everyone went inside. Then, I followed them.

Then, I went home. And washed the dishes.
=/



Today..
I woke up at 10 AM.
Took a shower
Went to Diana's (sister) soccer practice. With Leslie (sister) and my mom.
Went to Macy's and got a new pair of pants. And a skirt.
Went back to the park to pick up Diana.
Went home.
Ate.
Did homework.
Talked to people.


Yup.. there's my weekend right there."

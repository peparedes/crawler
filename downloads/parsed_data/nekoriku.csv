There's actually nother wrong with it, it's just that when we installed Windows XP, we had to install all our regular programs in again, including Norton AntiVirus systems. We misplaced the installation disk, unfortunantly.. ^^;; Now we have to find it, or surfing the internet will burden all of us with the pain of pop-ups. 

Yesterday I was absent from school because of a bug going around. -_- I layed in bed almost all day and slept. My fever was around 102.3 Degrees.. now it's around 99.7 Degrees. My mom forced me to go to school today, even with this massive headache. Hopefully the Motrin Jade gave me will help it go away. Speaking of Jade, she's behind me watching. The whole time. o_o;;

Anyways, I'll update later."

At about 9 o'clock in the morning, my 4 year old sister blasts the song ""That's what girls do"" right outside my locked door. I about kicked her into the wall if it wasn't for her crying so easily. X_X Somebody shoot me, please.

For some odd reason I discovered that burning candles near me helps me keep my mind off of food. I've decided that I want to lose 5 pounds by the end of this year, and excersise daily. My goal is to become healthier, and grow my hair our. Right now, it's barely down to my shoulders. By the end of the year, it should be about 2 inches down my back. At least, I'm hoping for that to happen."

My mom had some tests run, and she found out that she has two tumors on her left ovarie, and some kind of weird infection on the inside of her lungs. She has another appointment this Thursday to get the infection checked out. They perscribed her two pain medications, one for the day and one for the night. I know she'll be alright. God will keep her safe..

Last night the 8th graders at KMS played with Fairmont High School at the Football game. They made us wear our Fairmont T-shirts, but the high schoolers wore their uniforms. The uniforms are so awesome.. I can't wait to join marching band next year. Kettering ended up losing to Centerville, 7 to 21. We were never that great. X_X We got free cookies at half time, that was neat. Ended up going to sleep around 12:30 last night, waking up with my arms hurting. They still are aching me, too.

School is doing alright. Today we switched from Music UA to Comp. Tech III. I don't really mind typing for an hour in a half, but it gets very tiring. Our new teacher has this annoying southern accent, and I've already decided I don't like her that much.

Yesterday I was absent, so I have more work to make up. Mostly Algebra I and Chemistry. Algebra has started to bug me, with all the work our teacher gives. It's like she doesn't understand we have a life besides schoolwork and sleeping. I still haven't done that homework, but I'll get to it sometime tonight. It really doesn't matter to me anymore. At least, not right now. All my dreams have since forever fallen into a bottomless pit of endless nothing. 

Last night at about 2 in the morning, my mom woke me up to tell me she was going to the hospital. At first I couldn't calculate what she was trying to say to me, until she repeated it a few times. I sat up, and she explained everything to me. Her kidneys have really started to hurt her the past few days, and if she doesn't go to the hospital, it might become Cancer. Half asleep I nodded, scared to death that she might not come back to this house alive. I was so worried, I couldn't sleep at all, but after awhile I fell asleep. She came back at 4, and told me that she will probably be alright. The doctor said that she should have come in earlier, and gave her some medicine. I really hope she'll be okay.. I don't need to lose another loved one in my life.

I hope that my self esteem will rise enough for my attitude to become positive once again. I feel so ripped apart and strangled inside, like somebody just stabbed me and hit my head with a brick. I'm going to go lay down now."

"event","So very surprisingly, I'm in quite a good mood today. o.o;; So, expect a nice entry. 

Last Friday, My Dad, Nikki, my sisters, and I went on a roadtrip up to Michigan. It was a dreadful, annoying 6 hour drive from Dayton, Ohio to Detroit, Michigan. When we first got in the car, it was nice and calm. Just how I hoped. Satisfied, I took out my book and began to read. About half an hour there, all the girls started getting hyper and entergetic. X_X Why did my dad have to give them so much pop? I tried to persist my reading, but to no use. There was no way I could read with the little 4 year old jumping on my back every five minutes or so. 

On the way we encountered a Detour on Highway 5, which led to an extra half an hour driving. We were almost lost in Findley, until we reached the interstate. The kids had settled down by now, but it was too dark to read. That's what a Sony Walkman is for.. XD

After 6.5 hours, we finally arrived to my Cousin's house. There was no particular reason we were visiting, just to say hi. I hadn't seen my cousins in about a half a year, and they're all so cute. ^_^ There's 2 boys, and 3 girls. All around 2-9 years old. I'm the oldest cousin out of both sides of my family. Including my sisters, that's 9 little kids. To babysit. Can we say fun? Phf. The whole time it was only screaming and chaos. They tackled me at least 6 times, jumped on me who knows how many times, and woke me up every morning around 7 am. Good lord.. 

Overall, I guess we all had a pretty good time up there. It's damn cold in Michigan! O_O Sheesh.. 

School Report: This week the IOWA Exams are going to be a real pain in the ass. We take two tests every morning, making our homeroom, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd periods shortened and confusing. Sadly 3rd period is Chemistry, which is one of my favorite subjects. That period is only 20 minutes now. o_o;; Meh.. the only thing that's really going to get to me is all the studying. This test is going to be really important for High school in the following year.

I must get to my homework now. X_x"

Today Jade and I went to the library after school. I rented a couple of books, and the third Haibane Renmai DVD. I've been waiting for it to come in so long.. After we finished our homework at the library, we walked back. Unfortunantly my mom was already at her house to pick me up.

School's catching up with me. Actually I have Algebra homework to do but.. I'll do that later. 

A few days ago we installed Windows XP to this computer. It runs so great it's simply unbelievable. We also installed a new hard drive. Had to re-install AIM and Flash, things like that.. but I absolutely love XP!

I figured out today that my best friend is going out with a boy I have a crush on. I've known him for two years now, we've just been friends. But hearing her say that just crushed my heart. There's absolutely no way I can tell her about my secret..

Last night my Dad took me and my four sisters to his friend's mom's house to swim while he works on one of their projects. His new project is a puppet theatre for a Museum in Indy. We swam for a little while, and after that I took a nap in the hamok (sp?) next to the pool.

"event","Been a week in a half since I've started school, I mine as well talk about it. And complain about it. What teenager doesn't complain about having to sit in a hot classroom and learn? Heh..

For those of you who don't know me, I'm in 8th Grade at Kettering Middle School. Next year I'll be a Freshman. I'm not sure what High school I'll be going to yet. Depending on how expensive it is and how my Dad's income goes, I might go to a Private School. I'll either go to Alter, or Saint Mary (a catholic school). If I'm not going to Private school, I'll just go to Fairmont. I'm in an Algebra I Honors class, I play the drums in band, and the Piano in Jazz Band. 

I grew 2 Inches over the summer! YAY! ^-^ This is a Big, BIG deal for me.. I haven't grown in forEVER! 

My first period class is Algebra I. We have alot of homework in this class, considering it is a High school class. This means I'll have a credit for Algebra in high school. Ms. Miller is our teacher, and she's very uptight and strict. Everything has to be PERFECT. Ugh.. Sometimes she gets on my nerves. But, gotta deal with it, if I want to get into a good College or High School. 

My second period class is Latin. Latin is actually pretty easy to learn. Except our teacher.. Jeeze.. she's like, the oldest woman in the Earth. They should have retired her 10 years ago. She speaks really, really slow and calm and gives us baby work to do.. X_x Unbelievable, some teachers..

Third Period is Social Studies. It's alright.. we don't have much homework in this class-- yet. It's only the beggining of the school year. Our teacher is an Army veteran, so everything's ""Military Styled"". Even the way we staple our papers. He's very laid back, until somebody starts talking when he is. That's his major Pet Peeve. He'll give detentions for that. 

After that is Unified Arts, Band, and Lunch.

Sixth Perioid.. Science. Our Science teacher is the kind of teacher that doesn't put you to sleep and makes you laugh.. he's also obsessed with Scottish Terriers. However he has NO clue about spelling (hint hint, science). You know, all of my Science teachers have been really fun. I wonder if I'm just lucky or if all of them or like that.

Seventh Period, last period of the day. English. She's just a basic teacher, there's nothing really that great about her, nothing that bad. Except she's the best gum spotter I've ever seen. O_o 

Nothing else that's really new.. got my hair cut again. It's kind of short medium, I'll have to post some pictures when I get the chance. Right now my computer's really screwed up."

First we had to drive from Dayton all the way down to Cincinatti. It's about an hour drive. I had two suitcases packed, the small one with my clothes and the big one with my shoes, bathroom needs, jewelry and stuff like that. I left some space in the big suitcase for the things I buy in Europe. My whole family pitched in to buy me the plane tickets and 400 Euros of spending money. I love them so much for it, I don't know how I could ever pay them all back! ^_^

Anyways.. back to the airport. We got to the airport 3 hours before our plane took flight. My mom, sister, Grandmas and Grandpas, and Michelle's dad were there to watch us take off. We went as far as security, and then we had to leave them. I hugged my mom for what seemed forever, and she was crying waterfalls. After saying goodbye, Michelle, her mom and I went through security, which didn't really take that long. About a half an hour. We went through alot of stores to take up time. The moving sidewalks are really neat, and it doesn't take as long to get to your station.

 The first plane we took was a small plane. The small plane was the one that scared me the most! X_x When we took off it felt like I was falling towards the ground! The view was amazing though.. I had a window seat. The first plane flight took 2 hours to Newark. We went through Turbulance sometimes, which scared the shit out of me because I was sleeping some of the time. When we got to Newark, we had to race to the big plane because our plane was late. The big plane was a Continental Airlines 767. Inside the big plane we had our own little tv screen, video games, movies, music, you name it. The food on the plane was actually pretty good for plane food.

Michelle's Uncle Dominique and Naima his wife met us at the Belgian Airport. His 14 year old son Dairo also came, along with Michelle's Grandmother. Here are the things I thought were different about Europe.

1. Definently all the Grafiti, over there it's considered art and they don't cover it up.

2. Everybody is really polite, not like here in America

3. They drive really, REALLY fast.

4. The speed limits are only suggestions.

5. Phones beep instead of ring

6. The butter is real o.o and the milk is directly from the cow XD

7. Lunch is their most important meal

8. They're very layed back

9. The little circles you go in to choose your street, they're fun ^^

10. They have no mountain dew!

11. Everybody smokes >_>

12. Everything is so old.. the whole place is an antique, it's beautiful ^^

I could list more, but it'd be too much.  

We stayed at the castle, yes, castle (I can see your wide eyes o.o) called Balmoral. It's a 200 year old castle with the tower and everything on top of the mountain in Belgium. Dominique is a chef there. The lady there lives with her husband, she's in her 40's. Her mom also lives there.

The reason they're so rich is because her factory makes old fashioned bricks for bread ovens. Her dad invented the Smart Car and bought the castle for her ^_^;; I took a million pictures of it..

I'm finished for today. I'll write the rest tommorow -.-;; Bye."

"event","Yesterday, around 3:45, I had a call from my Grandpa, who was at the Miami Valley Hospital with my Mom. My mom had fallen 15 feet from a ladder, and landed on her left side onto an air conditioner. She was rushed in an ambulance to the Trauma Room, where they hooked her up to at oxygen machine, five IVs, and a cathider (I think that's what it is). They ran her through a CAT scan, and X-rayed her whole body to see if she had any internal bleeding, ripped tissue, or broken bones. My mom was in shock when they first brought her into the Trauma room, and she was crying her eyes out from the pain. They put her on, I'm taking a wild guess here, Methodine (the strongest pain medicine in the world), and had to cut her clothes off because she couldn't move. After the CAT scan and the X-rays, she had no internal bleeding (which is very, VERY lucky for this kind of accident),and some ripped tissue. On her left side she had three broken ribs in the front, and one in the back. She came home safely, and now she's on that pain medicine, and this breathing thing so she doesn't get nomonia. She has minor bruses here and there, with one big bruse on her thigh that needs ice.

My Mom's not going back to work until Monday. I told her she shouldn't go to work at all, because it's going to take six to eight weeks for her to heal. But she can't miss out on work, I guess. I'm really worried about her.. 

I'll update on her health as I post on. Please pray for my Mom."

Saturday: Saturday morning I got up early at about 7:00 (even though I had stayed up until about 2:00 in the morning) My dad gets upset because I don't want to go to North Carolina with him, which scares me a little, he gets very violent when he's upset.. we end up working it out and he takes me home. Michelle shows up a little bit after. We played the Xbox for a little while until my Grandma came to our house. She took us out to lunch, and we went to go see Garfield (it's my Grandma, I didn't pick the movie out). I wanted to go see Spiderman2, but I don't think she'd really like that. The movie was okay, a little corny but still hilarious. 

Sunday: Spent the night at Michelle's house. We watched Kill Bill Volume 1, and Stuck on you. Kill Bill was AWESOME! 1/3 of it was pretty much anime. That movie was just outstanding, and brilliant. I have a hunch that there's going to be four volumes, one for each person on her death list. Stuck on you was very funny.. I wondered if both of them really were stuck together or not and if it was a real story.

Before that Michelle and I went to an arcade near her house to play DDR. There was a group of about 15 teenagers there, all who were very good and were usually on Heavy mode. We sat and watched, waited for our turn. They never did offer us a chance to play, and we never got to. So much for DDR..

Monday-Wedsday: Jade spent the night Monday and Tuesday, and she went home early in the morning today. We watched the second volume of Rurouni Kenshin, and played Dead or Alive 3 until we were too tired to push the buttons. 

Today we went to my Grandma's house for swimming. Well, my sister and her friend swam but I didn't. For monthly reasons (hint)"

This weekend my dad wants Berkeley and I to drive all the way down to North Carolina so we can pick up his girlfriend's little demon girls from their grandma's. We spend the night there, then go back the next day. Sounds like alot of fun, huh. Well.. for some reason my sister really wants to go, but I'm not too crazy about it. So, I'm going to stay. He seemed dissapointed when I told him, but nobody goes through their life without dissapointment. I definetly know that.

This morning I was playing FF3, trying to beat Kefka. Now I'm not sure if this is the end of the whole game or not, I've never known a Final Fantasy game to be so short. Everytime I lose one of my groups comes back with 1 Hp and no Mp. I've used all my items and skills, all I do is attack as much as I can before I die. Now I'm really hoping that the damage I inflicted on him earlier is still there, and that he hasn't healed. If he has, I'm totally screwed. 

After my Dad's girlfriend Nikki picked us up to go to Kings Island, she pulled over because she took a wrong turn (just so you know, it's her first time going there). Her car stalled on her and quit, and it wouldn't start up again. She tried to start it, but it was really humid inside the car, and we got out and went into the hotel near us. We told the man about our problem, he was fine with it, and we sat down and waited for my dad to come and check out the car. He tried putting new oil in, but it still wouldn't start. After awhile we had it towed, still unsure of the problem. By now it was 3:30.

We took my dad's SUV to Kings Island, where it said it was going to rain and maybe a severe thunderstorm could occur. Of course, everybody started leaving. We decided to stay and see if it would pass over. Yeah, right. While we were on the Vortex (a rollercoaster) it started to pour all over us. After we got off we ran out to our car, soaking wet. As we were pulling out, with the nose of the car about all the way out into the street, some lady comes speeding and comes an inch close to us before hitting the brakes. God that scared the shit out of me. I thought we were going to crash..

That was enough stress for the day."

Then he/she slammed the door so hard it shook the whole house. So I got up, making Tux (my cat) mad at me because he was laying on my stomach, and kind of sat on the couch for what, 10 minutes? It turns out that Dan had to take a crap so bad he slammed the door and ran to the bathroom. I really hope he wasn't constipated.. if he was he'd ruin the bathroom. I used the upstairs one just in case.

After playing FF3 on Super Nintendo for an hour Dan took my sister and I to the mall to look at video games. We looked around, didn't see really anything interesting. What we really need is a second Gamecube controller and a gamecube memory card. My sister wanted to get this creepy game called Animal Crossing. *shrugs* After that we got lunch and I got my hair cut. I had all my dead ends cut off, my hair thinned a bit, and the ends made a little choppy. It looks alot better than before.

When we got home I helped my mom clean the backyard up. We collected all the stray sticks, pulled some weeds, planted grass in dead spots, fertilized everything, planted some flowers, and got rid of a small hill of dirt dug up to make room for the tomatoes. My sister and her friend put one of her sleeping bags under the trampolean on the ground. They were laying on it to see how far down it goes when they jump. Well they left it there and now.. well there's a big square of dirt in our yard. Funny how things work out.."

Last night I spent the night at Michelle's house. We played Tetris all night, and watched a movie called 50 first dates. It was alright, but it wasn't as funny as I thought it would be. My mom came and got me in the morning, and we went shopping. We got Vitamins, cat vitamins, cat food, a neat card for Dan, cat litter, and cleaning stuff. Around 8:45 we walked down to Nora's(Berkeley's friend) house, and walked with them down to Delco park for Fireworks. We met Jade and her family at an intersection, and walked with them too. Fireworks lasted about 10 minutes, and were very, very good, especially at the end. Jade's little sister kept on slapping me with those glow necklaces. I hate that little girl.. treating people that way. After it was over we walked back home, and here I am now.

A few days ago Jade, Michelle, and I were on the trampoline. It was pretty late, not dark yet, but getting there. Somebody left the kitchen door open. Berkeley and her friends came running up to us, saying that two cats got out. Spikey and Cinnamon. Now Cinnamon isn't the smartest cat in the world.. it was easier to find her. We scared her and chased her inside the house. Nora's older brother Jake found Spikey 20 minutes later in the neighbor's yard. She came up to us and I picked her up, bringing her inside. Nobody's ever leaving the door open again. I don't want something happening to Spikey or Cinnamon that happened to Diamond. 

Tommorow I have a big chore list to look forward to. Painting my room, cleaning my room, litter boxes, gah.. I hate it."

"event","It's amazing how much older games like Mario can amuse while some newer games can't. Today I got my old Super Nintendo out and was Playing Mario Brothers 3. I forgot how many cheats there was in this game.. I got pretty close to beating it today, I had to get off to do some chores and I didn't get back on. I've also got Final Fantasy 2, Spawn, Chrono Trigger, and Tetris (which really sucks). I played a little of FF2, also. I had to start a new game because my sister saved over mine. That game is very addicting. 

Michelle and Jade spent the night last night. Today we played Cops and Robbers, but in a different way that I've played before. Michelle was the cop, and Jade, my sister, and me are the robbers. All the robbers hide one small item and each of them have different strategies. One has to hide all the time, one has to run all the time, and one has to run and hide. The cop has 10 minutes to catch one of the robbers and take him or her hostage. The other robbers then have to somehow get to the other robber and free him or her from being hostage, and get them to the starting point in ten minutes. Personally I think it's a very hard game and that Michelle was tweaking the rules to her favor.. the robbers couldn't travel together, they couldn't lock doors, they can't have guns, but the police can kill you by touching you. -_- stupid..

One of our cats, Crystal (or Mama Bear as we nicknamed her) got into the small attic from an entrance in our closet. It's not really an attic, but since I have angular ceilings, it's on the side of the house.. one on each side. Anyways, the entrance has been a piece of wood, covering a hole in the back of my closet. It's been unattatched since we moved here. I left my closet door open and Crystal got in the attic. Now inside the attic is alot of support beams, insulation, and dust. Dust is really not good for me. There was a hole in the wall, where Crystal was just hiding all the way in the back like a lazy bum. We tried everything to get her to move.. meat, string, calling her. But finally we had to go to extreme measures and got the super soaker. We didn't spray her, but we sprayed near her, and when I caught her she scratched me so much I look like death. We boarded up that stupid piece of wood, now nobody can get in.

I barely ate anything today, felt kind of weird.. wasn't very hungry. Right now I'm just talking to Michelle and Josh. Shout out to Josh, hi ^_^"

Today I did some mopping, vacuuming, and dusting around my dad's studio for him. I also cleaned the glass outside and inside. Listening to Virgin Radio from England.. not much else. I'll update more later."

I've had this really weird feeling all day that something bad happened.. that feeling you get deep down in your gut that something's wrong. Or maybe it was just me. I don't know.. maybe it'll go away in the morning. Or maybe something really bad did happen.. gah. I don't want to think about it. I'm trying to be happy here, people. Nothing interesting happened.."

"event","Alright. This is what happens when I leave the computer for a few days.. this crap. Since I'm a fairly organized person I'll sort it out.

Monday- Finally. After finding Keening so quickly out of pure luck and taking forever to find Sunder (which I didn't know was being carried by somebody I killed), I have beaten Dagoth Ur. It really wasn't hard.. just avoid him and get to the Heart. Strike it with Sunder once or twice, then go at it with Keening. After I killed him and crossed the bridge back, the whole statue collapses (actually, I thought the whole place was going to collapse, but I guess not) After that I went through Azura's speech of Morrowind being cured of the Blight and all that.. now I can't talk to anybody without them stuttering at the sound of my name. 

I must have done the stupidest thing also.. up by Dagon Fel there's a Shrine, with a small shack and a lady guarding it inside. I was looking in one of the crates when I saw a book worth 50,000 gold! My sister was watching me here, and since she's new to Morrowind she was saying ""ooo, steal it! sell it! you'll be rich!"" I know alot better than that. Stealing a 50,000 gold worth book in front of somebody, when I know no seller has that kind of money to pay for it. I paused it and went to the bathroom, coming back. ""Oh, you know all the guards are attacking you, you've got a bounty of 50,000 gold on your head, I saved just in case fighting with them froze it."" And there in my inventory was that stupid, fucking book. THAT STUPID, FUCKING BOOK! I only had 17,000 gold then. To pay the bounty off fully, that would take FOREVER! I went to somebody in the theives guild who said he could get it off for 25,000 gold. Now I'm out, trying to make money the best way I can, while avoiding guards everywhere.

Tuesday- Tuesday I went to my Grandma's again for swimming. Jade couldn't come because her brother Conor was having his 10th birthday party, and she had to be there. Went to the knitting club, got alot of my scarf done. I'm almost done with it. It's going to be a gift for my sister..

Wednesday- Oh yay.. it's deep cleaning day! Big whoop.. I had to move my sister's bed out of her room by myself (heavy, queen size bed might I let you know here) with my not so strong arms.. I swear, if my arms were as strong as my legs I'd be able to do it easily. I trimmed the bushes outside, watered the lawn and the plants, weeded the tomatoes, swept, cleaned the whole play room, bleached the bathroom, and a couple other things that totally wore me out for the rest of the day.. 

Thursday- The continuation of deep cleaning day! Cleaned out my bookbag, the junk drawers, defraged the computer, did the litter boxes, a couple loads of laundry, then finished it off with a little bit of Morrowind. We also watched a movie called The Secret Window, by Stephen King, the great horror writer. Never reading the book myself (actually it's a short story) I thought it was really good. Spend the night at Michelle's that night.

Today- Woke up to Michelle poking my feet at 7 in the morning. Isn't that a nice way to wake up? I mean, I can never sleep at Michelle's house. She has to leave her lamp on, and the TV, just so she can fall asleep.. it drives me crazy. We went to bed around 1 something, like I got any sleep anyways with about one and a half hours gone from that. We set up the Yard Sale that they were having that day, along with 26 more houses in that same neighborhood. We sold 150 dollars worth of things today, and I got myself some bran new black sneakers for 5 bucks down at one of the sales. They're really nice, too..

Tommorow- who knows -_-"

We went to Domonics, a really nice Italian restraunt. Their house salad has this very strong garlic dressing, and since my lips are badly chapped right now, they burned like hell while I was eating. My Grandparents also gave me some late Birthday presents. They got me:</P>

<P>Michelle's Hermit crabs died two days ago.. she doesn't know why, but for some reason they were out of their shells and just weren't moving.. she got new ones now, but she was just getting attatched to them and even though they're hermit crabs it's still very sad.</P>
<P>Yesterday we went to Ceaser's Creek, a big lake a little south of where I live. The water there used to be alot more clear, now it's pretty muggy. But it's still good to swim in. Michelle, Jade and I went swimming for a while, then we left because it was too cold. </P>"

Most of the time they just wore normal clothes, like they were never in the wizard world. I expected them to wear their robes almost all the time.. I guess it just took some feeling out of it. Though I'm not going to spoil the whole movie and tell all about it. That's it."

"event","My freedom from the prison school will end soon, tommorow and the two days after that are the only days I have left. However, I'm not that anxious to get out of school anymore. One of my best friends is leaving for Ireland to spend almost the whole summer there. He'll have the internet, but he won't be able to get on it much, because him and his brothers have only one laptop that they're taking with them. His brother is just awful toward him, though his doesn't bother his little brother much. He'll probably be on the computer talking to his girlfriend -_- Maybe, when me and Michelle go to Belgium, we'll be able to go and see him. Or maybe he'll come to see us, I don't really know. He'll come back right before school starts, and I'll miss him.

We had our band concert on Friday night, right after a huge hail/thunder storm hit us. The electricity was knocked out, luckily the school still had a backup system. We played our songs, but since we only have four percussionists, alot of us have to play 2 or more instruments a song. After that, Michelle and I went to Books&Co. for an Eoin Colfer signing. He was really surprised at both of us, because we were very hyper while he signed our books. Eoin Colfer wrote Artemis Fowl, The Wish List, The Supernaturalist (which I just read), and Benny and Omar. I had my picture taken with him, also. 

I recieved a letter in the mail, telling me that next year in 8th grade, I'll be taking an AlgebraI class. This means that in High School, I'll be able to skip one of my courses of Math. Michelle is in this class also, but sadly Jade didn't make it. Oh well..

Right now I'm updating this on my Dad's laptop, in his studio. Some band is here, and they want to record their songs in their studio. They're playing their songs right now, I can hear them faintly, and they're not half bad. Alot of Piano."

The sun burned my face, shoulders and back, and now everytime I move it stings like hell. Remember to actually use sunblock next time, that would be such a good idea.. today I went out and planted some blackberry plants, watered everything, and dug up alot of wildgrass. My mom and I planted Squash and Green Beans where I dug up the grass, hoping that our tomato plants would get enough sun. Spent the night at Michelle's last night with Jade, watched Jackass for about the fifth time. Those idiots are just hilarious..

What really cheered me up yesterday was my cat, Cinnamon. Our dining table is backed up to the wall, and left of it is a chest of drawers. My sister, Dan (mom's boyfriend), his brother and I had just finished jumping on the trampoline. Dan's brother screams YEAH! when a few things happened almost at one, in about 5 seconds. First, my cat jumps off the floor (she is a fat one, to let you know) and jumps onto the table, pushing back the tablecloth while she hurles herself at a candle on a stand. My sister grabs the candle, and my cat bounces off of it, doing a backflip off the wall, then lands on the ground and bolts off into the basement. It was so funny I couldn't breathe. I was laughing so hard. XD

Friday night I babysitted the three little demons at my Dad's house, and earned 20 bucks out of it. I spent that money at the World A'fair in downtown Dayton. There they had performances, including Irish Dancing (which I love), food, souveniers and all the countries from Africa to Japan. There I bought myself everything from Japan, including a lantern, flute, fan, chopsticks, and an umbrella.

"event","Missing my last two Jazz band practices has not cheered me up. Last Thursday my Mom and her boyfriend were both at work and couldn't get off until lunch. My mom arranged for my Dad to pick us up that morning, and take us to school. I was sitting there waiting for him to show up, to take me to Jazz band. He never came. So me and my sister waited for him to take us to school. Still nothing. We thought he might be late, but he never really did come. We couldn't get to school until lunchtime, but mine was already over when I got there, so I had to wait until I got home to actually eat something, because I didn't eat any breakfast either. It turned out my Dad had no clue he was supposed to be picking us up today. 

Other than that, life has been alright. Went to sleep over at Jade's house with Michelle, had alot of fun. We played video games and watched alot of movies and anime. What was the worst was that I was biking down the hill, and since I'm not used to being to Jade's house, I never noticed there were potholes in the ground. I wrecked and scraped my hands, elbos and knees and some of my legs pretty badly. It wasn't any better falling down a hill, it takes you longer to stop.

What made me feel really stupid is that I left her gift and her card at Michelle's house. I'll just have to go get it tommorow after school and give it to her. 

Over the weekend I slept over at Michelle's. They had a little birthday party for me, which was fun.

Two days ago my mom, my mom's boyfriend, my sister's best friend and I had a little family meeting with my sister. We had to tell her, we had no choice, we had to tell her some time. The truth was explained about Diamond, my mom talked about other cats that have died when we were younger, but just when she was about to tell my sister I pretty much burst out crying. My sister was just devastated, and it made me re-live that whole moment. She didn't go to school the next, and it seems she's doing a bit better. 

What's really on my mind, though, are our other cats. Most of them are old, and when they die I'm going to be a complete wreck. But I wouldn't like to talk about that. It's too dreary..

School really isn't that much better. In Math we have a big test on volume and surface area. We took part of it today, and we're going to take the rest on Monday. In English we have to read a Newbery Award book for a report. I chose a book called Crispin, written by Avi. The Librarian said it was very good, and I have a week and a half to read it before I must present my report. 

My mom is now working longer shifts, and I'm not seeing her as much as I used to. I'm glad she's going to start bringing in money again, but I'm going to miss her being around.

This weekend I'm going to my Dad's new house, which they just started to rent. It's a one story but it has alot of character, and I can finally get my own room. The downside is that my Dad's Girlfriend's three little demon girls are also moving in. I'm just glad I won't have to share a room with them.

     A few hours after my last post, my mom wanted to go to McDonalds to get something to eat, because she hadn't eaten all day. I wasn't hungry but she wanted me to come with her, which I agreed to. On the way back, right next to our house, I thought I saw something laying on the road. When I got out and went over to the edge of the road, my heart skipped a beat. My sister's cat, Diamond was laying there, covered in blood, her neck broken, staring up at me with beady eyes.

     And I just screamed. I picked her up and me and my mom were just panicking, we didn't know what to do. She was dead, and I was so shocked I didn't even cry. I just held her and started shaking, and I held her for what seemed forever.. I just didn't know what to do, what to think anymore, and I just wondered why God had done this..

     We burried her about a half an hour later. My sister and her friend were asleep, and we just couldn't tell them, and we haven't since. We're just lucky my sister was out doing things the next few days. Tommorow, though, we're telling her.

He works as the delivery manager of Home Depot, and it was pretty neat. We wore aprons around the store, a couple people even asked us (my sister and I) if we worked there. We got to keep the aprons, and went home after a couple of hours. On the way home after I raised enough money for it, I finally bought the Liger Zero Schneider. This thing comes with both the Zero and the Schneider armor, which actually surprised me. I thought it would only be the Schneider. 

     Our Geography Teacher's mother died today, and she wasn't in school. I feel very sorry for her.. it reminds me of when I lost my best friend Jamie, when I was only a kid. I wrote a sympathy letter to her, and hopefully it will lift her spirits to know somebody cares about what has happened.

I don't know what it was, but it was sure a nice wake up call. Sarcasm can't be heard over the internet very well. I went to Jazz band as usual on every Thursday of the week, and was the only drummer out of four there. I had to set up by myself, and put everthing away independently as well. It was our first practice after spring break, so we had to warm up a bit out of lazyness with practicing. We recieved new sheet music, a neat piece that switches between Swing and Latin beats throughout the piece. 
  
     Our schedule today was period 5,1, lunch/band, U.A. (unified arts)then period 2. 

Period 5- English Class. We simply went over 5 of the 12 labors that Hercules completed, some with cheating. Did some worksheets, nothing special.

Period 1- Started talking about the people of Mexico, watched a boring but information filled movie.

Lunch/Band- Had a test in band over counting 6/8 measures. Lunch had me frustrated because of not eating meat, which I gave up for Lent.

U.A.- We just started Comp. Tech and Music in U.A. Comp. Tech is pretty easy, I'm already on lesson 12 of our typing progam, and I'll probably get finished early. In Music we had what I call a BCD (Boring Composer Day). 

Period 2- About the same thing as period five, only we went to the library for half the period.

We got up there pretty quick, but when we got there we found out my cousin was sick with the Flu. We knew we couldn't stay, partially because my aunt, uncle, and other cousin were getting sick also, and because we couldn't do anything anyways. We stayed there just that night, and then left the next morning. We drove pretty much all day, and stayed in a hotel in a little town called Bowling Greens. I didn't get any sleep ALL night. We were on the second floor, and this little kid just kept on jumping and jumping on the third floor above us. I don't know how my Grandparents and my sister got sleep.. but I didn't sleep a wink. 

     The next morning we got up and immediatly left for Dayton. I slept about the whole time in the car until we got to a small little town called Wapokaneta, which is Niel Armstrong's hometown. We went to a museum there dedicated to him and NASA. It was pretty neat, and it was fairly big for just one person. I got myself a boomerang while I was there, a nice wooden one. After we were done we left, and drove all the way home to my dad's house.
     
     All weekend it was of course misery, as usual with the three demon girls. Nikki (dad's girlfriend) is moving in with us. He didn't even ask me about it, how I felt about it, he just went ahead and planned it. So much for a kid's say in things.

"event","Last night I couldn't sleep at all, I don't know what was wrong with me. I woke up early, and stayed up late, you would have thought I would slept. But I just had these wierd dreams, random ones. Like the whole house being flooded with some wierd liquid that reminded me of LCL from Evangelion. I think it might have been hair jel.. or some weird, clear orange juice. So I woke up about 3 am and watched TV for a while, then I fell asleep again.

     Today my Grandparents took us to these hills out in the country, where we could hike and climb the huge rocks that are out there. I'm just glad my Grandpa actually let us climb up, and not walk all around to get to the very top. We carved our names and the date into this large smooth boulder, and when we got to the very top there was a very steep hill of gravel. I started running down it, but it was just too steep and I tripped and rolled down until my foot caught a tree, which stopped me. I may have some cuts, but I was pretty lucky. And it was fun too XD 
  
     I hope you have a good time in Canada, Josh. I've never been out of the U.S. and I've always wanted to go someplace like Toronto or Niagara Falls. So enjoy your trip and tell me all about it when you get back. ^_^"

"event","I'm updating this from Parma Cleveland, and so far it's nice up here. We got here yesterday night at about 10 pm, went to bed a little afterwards, my sister was out like a light when we got here. I pretty much slept all the way, so I couldn't get to sleep and I was up just thinking about things. This morning I was reading the paper because I had nothing else to do and I was the first one up, and I was just skimming everything until I surprisingly came upon an Inuyasha picture, which really caught my eye, becuase you usually don't find those kinds of things in the newspapers in Dayton. I read the artical and there seemed to be an Anime convention that was going on today and tommorow, and yesterday. Unfourtunatly I couldn't go to it, because we had other things to do today. Nothing good was happenening tommorow, so that kind of put me down. 

     My Dad's 41st birthday was on the 24th, and me my sister and my Grandma went out to get him a birthday present. I swear they have the biggest malls in Cleveland.. compared to the ones we have down in Dayton. We got my dad a nice shirt and a gift certificate to JCPenny's. It was also my Aunt's birthday a little while ago, and we got her this really nice necklace with earrings to match it. My sister and I got a bunch of socks, and some clothes also. 

     Last Thursday our band had the concert we'd been looking forward to for a while, but I got very nervous. I messed up I don't know how many times, and then I had to play for Jazz.. but I did alright on the drums. Though I think one of the other percussionists that I was playing the snare drum with, I think he spazzed or something.. because about halfway through the song he dropped his sticks. Very smooth..

     To sum it up I want to say hi to Josh, who I haven't talked to in a while. I'm sorry I haven't been on very often, if you're on sometime IM me at Yoyokitsune. *wave*"

"event","Today I tried to look on the whole world a different way. I tried not to complain when my alarm went off this morning, and I actually got up about a minute after it went off. I took a shower without complaining, well, untill the shampoo bottle fell on my foot. Then I just got pissed, but that doesn't count. *shifty eyes* Michelle didn't come to school because she had throat problems, and it was just the two musketeers today. Me and Jade. It was kind of boring without Michelle giving us a noogie when we turned our backs to get something out of our lockers, or to get a drink, or simply walking. But that's alright. 

     Unfourtunatly my mom just opened the door and with a little wave of her hand I have to get off. I'll sum up the rest of this entry tommorow."

"event","Today was an alright day. Layed in bed for about a half an hour listening to the radio that wakes me up every morning. They say that Metallica is coming to tour in Cincinatti, I'm not sure, I was kind of half asleep.. if they really are though, I have to find some way to get tickets. Must see Metallica.. Today was a really good day. It rose up to 75 degrees, from around 40 something. The wind was blowing like there's no tommorow, which was really nice. It felt like spring was really here. In English we're starting Greek Mythology, and just finished the story of Icarus and Deadilus. Icarus had the wax wings, and was greedy for the sun, but when he flew too close his wings melted and he fell to his death. 

  Anyways.. in Social Studies we had a map due that we had to label on Canada. Me, along with 3 other people turned that stupid thing in. Nobody else. Our teacher just threw the papers behind her back and started another speech, which I really didn't need.. along with some kid throwing up in math because of the weather change.

"event","Today was a good day at school. I woke up late this morning, at 7:30 because I forgot to turn the volume up on my alarm.. aren't I smart. -_- This morning it was raining, I love it when it rains, especially when you wake up to it. It's so nice. At school I'm doing pretty well, nothing special. I'm getting two artworks of mine displayed at an art presentation in Dayton, a manga sketch and a self protrait. This will do good things for my grade. Very good, yes..

I've been having better times with my mom, at least she's leaving me alone now. We're having my mom's friend Jeremy board at our house for a while, he's going to stay in the guest bedroom. Personally, I don't like this, because he's a guy I don't know.. but I have to put up with it. 

I bought myself the 3rd and 4th books of chobits, End of Evangelion and Metropolisa few days ago with all the money I had been saving up. And it was worth it, too. Even though now I'm broke. Again. My Dad says that because he's getting a new computer, I get his old one, which realy isn't old, to put in my room. I can't wait, it's going to be so awesome to have my own computer, finally, in my own room. Yayness.

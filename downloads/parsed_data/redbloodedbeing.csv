okay, enough abt the worlds most useless pple. 
okay, im a cat person, but there are seriously some cats in the world that shld be biten into pieces and left to rot in the London sewers. honestly! whats so attractive abt my house that the damn neighbours two fat, hedious, utter disgrace to cats like abt it? cat poison doesnt work, im sure catching it and shearing it wld be any better. kill them, those lame excuses for cats. skin them alive then roast them partially over an open fire, slice their just cooked flesh off, feed it to them. salt the raw meat and continue roasting. return the cats two days later. i hope it works. sicken excuses for cats. bleah...
hurmph!!!!! arrgh!!!! *pulls hair by the roots* *snarls* screwed up cats! meow meow meow... forever in heat. arrgh! pull their reproductive organs out by their tails! humph! 
dogs are another thing... and so are reality tv shows. i think simple life 2 shld be banned from screening. who wants to see Paris hilton every week, she just spolis the tv and that nicole richie. *bish* PCK shld cease filming and the crew shld just retire. all that bad english isnt the best influence to an already quite lousy singapore. singlish... id never thought that wrd wld come into being until something like 4 ears ago. is it so cool to speak singlish? i think it's horrifyingly disgusting. vulgarity is another (unless you are absolutely pissed). slip o the tounge, its still excuseable, continuous usage of it... well... i think then your diet shld consist of soap and water."

on a lighter note, i havent been updating and i seem to have fallen off the face of the earth which is honestly fine by me, not that i really care about much. the founder's photos have been printed and i suspect that someone is still waiting to blackmail me. i highly doubt that is possible unless by some form of trickery, i am persuaded into giving her the photo. so fat hope to you.

A demi Cerberus is very similar to Cerberus in<br>appearence but the difference is that a<br>Demi-Cerberus only has two heads.  You are<br>cruel and inhumane. You lack the food<br>intentions and sense of being that Cerberus<br>has.  You like to play with peoples emotions<br>and torture them to the last.  You have few<br>friends because many are scared of you and you<br>are also prone to violence.

i have this sense of regret, remorse, guilt, whatever it is, i dont really care. Not that it affect me in great big way... it does but its more like a shadow. some nagging thing that tugs at the soul. Wait a minute, what soul, i though that disappeared a long time ago when i didnt even notice.
I am very sure that there are somethings i have to change in my life. Most of them concern the poeple around me. I feel as if the world, is a shell, so delicate, so pretty. And somehow this shell has a hole in it and has allowed all these impurities to enter, i'm not sure whether it is because i allowed them to enter or whether it is because of some side effects of neglection. I'm not too sure. All i can say is that whatever it is, i have to change it, the way things are, the way things will be.(there seem to be interruptions occuring here and there in this room).
since i am obliged to end it here, i will continue else where, somewhere like school or something. so yes, i shall leave now and wish you all well. Good day.=3"

"event","<p>i haven't written in here or anywhere since god knows when....<br />i just want to be happy. why is it so hard? i'm happy alone, but i hate to be alone......&nbsp;<br />and now i've been in this relationship for going on to 3 years and neither one of us is happy. He acts like he&nbsp;doesnt&nbsp;care about me and maybe its not just acting its probably that he just does'nt. It hurts my heart to know and feel that someone you love feels that way. the good days are good when there's silence and we're out of each others way. there's i love you's throughout the days, but its mainly through repetiveness after goodnights and before hanging up the phone. "" ok well i'll talk you later, love you, bye."" click..... or ""goodnight, love you"". zzzzzzzz. that's that. i don't feel wanted but i dont necessarily feel unwanted. i&nbsp;guess i don't know my place other than being a mother. i know what i want. i want him to tell me that he can't see himself without me and that i'm the only one for him and i just want him to be nice to me and surprise me every once in a while, but only because he loves me. not because he feels like he has to. pick me a flower, write me a small note, just tell me you love me at any random moment. i knew since the beginning that this wasn't going to last. it just hurts. each time we go through something like this he just says ""i don't give a fuck."" i wish he did. he says"" that i can be replaced just as much as any other person can, but that's not true. you can't replace someone. there's only one of each person... there's only one of me! how can someone say something like that? why do we keep going through this? why do i? i hate love.....&nbsp;<br />i need someone thats going to be good to me. don't get me wrong. he hasn't cheated on me and he doesn't go to out to bars or anything like that. its just he doesn't know how to work through an argument with conversation. instead it always about leaving. </p>"

feeding on your truths
the lies are more stable
swallowing all the good news
i've noticed the empty plate
sitting before you
much like m own
i've not seen a broken word
til the day i met you
i'm useless when it comes to you
if you allowed me to erase
portions of your past
ending at the point where i made you
          ..a part of me..
id be visible 
just not released

i dont think i'll ever cope with being in love with you.

is that you?
you look unfamiliar.
with the eyes that i've known 
for almost four years
your smile brought to my attention
that you were content 
with feeling incomplete.

i won't be coming home tonight
i'll stay quiet
without your consent 
i will fall in love 
promise me you'll meet me
for the first time
my words thawed out completely
   oh my god is that him coming?

we're still in our own heads 
i've come to a conclusion 
its time to take this realzation

you're only happy    cause you're carrying the heart of another.
remind your emotions 
happiness is only the past.
half way to a smile
you'll start to cry
in remembrance of the things you never had.
to gain the pain 
was hanging on too long.
you were never mine.
you're trying to forget 
the things that mattered.
they don't matter.
i'll gather all your exits 
you choose the way out.
ecstacy embraced in your heart now.
emotional conflicts considered an envy.
create your soul
you're only suffocating.
the depression is over.
the depression is over.
the depression is never over.
meaningless words
taken in every angle.
everything is always falling apart.
i am falling apart."

he just came and picked krysta up for a while and he gave me a really big hug. of course i didnt hug him back. why does he do that to me? i know he knows i'm in love with him and he does that when in truth he really does'nt care about anything having to do with me. i just want to tell him not fucking touch me. you just have to understand how he is. its not that i'm being mean.

"event","today was a very frustrating day. i've taken everything to the heart. out of nowhere i broke down into tears. my eyes are swollen from the pain. i've got so much build up inside. i wish somehow there was some way to just forget about life for a while other than sleeping. sleep isn't at all too comforting when you're dreaming of things you're constantly thinking about. marty for example. he, by the way, called yesterday and i made an effort to be very nice, and his cell phone kept going out and i got very frustrated with that, for the fact that i hate repeating myself. i miss him so much, and i wish he knew that. love is a weapon of destruction.

"event","i just wrote marty a letter so he can read it on his way to work. i honestly don't think he'll ever understand what it is i'm trying to tell him. he came over earlier to pick krysta up for a while, and before he leaves he kind of pats me on the back like he cares. i know deep down he still does kinda sorta care about me in a way. he just does'nt show it. why won't he just be my friend for the least part of my worries. i'm constantly thinking about him subconciously. why can't i just get over him? i say i don't need him and that i am over him, but everybody knows the truth. i just wish he felt the same. then i think about how it would be if we ever gave love another try. it would'nt be the same. of course not. i'll just waste his time again. i hate him so much. maybe......maybe.....i don't know. 

its just so hard to be around him. his smell still lingers when he's not around. why does his hygeine matter now? it never mattered before. was it because he was comfortable with me? cause i did'nt care how bad or how good he smelled just as long as i was by his side. now he just always smells good.

i'm so in love with him. i feel so stupid for letting my feelings take over. its just so hard to let your first true love go. this is the time i can't do anything about it."

(thats how it used to be-he'd always tell me i was beautiful) i know him in the inside, not anymore. wounds need healing, i need him as my friend. i took advantage of the lingering moment. he should be mine, but i'm going to keep quite. its something i don't want him to know right now. i told him a while back, but i try not to show it. just wait til he leaves to cry. here comes the emptiness. my heart hurts. </FONT></P>

-he just called and said he has a flat tire so he won't make it.

someone please help me. i'm tired of crying myself to sleep everynight. i'm a very weakhearted person behind this pasted smile. soon you'll see there's really nothing left of me. i'm wearing myself thin and its not because of marty. i've always been tired_nhappy since i was young. i want to be someone else. maybe if i were a little skinnier, a lot prettier, and happy i'd be wanted. everyone is always telling me they like being around me because i make them comfortable with themselves, where does that leave me? 

-he made it over here. and i got this not so good feeling in my heart. 

what am i to do with myself? the thought of suicide has crossed my mind so many times, but i can't do it. i have someone that looks up to me, and someone i need to take care of for the rest of my life. this is true love.
and its a love i can't explain, but this too will hurt when she get older. i have a daughter for those of you who don't know. her name is krysta."

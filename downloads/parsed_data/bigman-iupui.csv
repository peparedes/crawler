"event","I spent over a month and a half building a character in Morrowind for pc.&nbsp; I built this character to where he was a level 32 Nord, born under the Sign ""The Tower,"" and he had Ebony Armor (and was on his way to having Daedric Armor), had a FUCKIN' BADASS Daedric Greatsword, then the save file gets corrupted.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

*about five minutes of nonstop cursing, the first 3 minutes containing forms of explitives that most people have never before heard*

Lemme explain what'd happened:

In Morrowind (even with God Mode activated), your character can still contract Common and Blight Diseases from fighting diseased animals.&nbsp; Well, I was fighting a shitload of Corpus Stalkers (think diseased, but still BARELY alive, zombies), and contracted ""Black-Heart Blight"" disease.&nbsp; Instead of the usual ""just use a Cure Blight Potion"" method, I go a lil hypochondriac, JUST TO MAKE SURE (bc, I've done it all the time and ALWAYS works).&nbsp; This is what I cured myself with:

*5 potions of ""Disease Resistance"" (2 Bargain, 1 Cheap, 2 Quality)
*1 potion of ""Cure Blight Disease""
*1 potion of ""Cure Common Disease""
* Cyrodillic Brandy (Forifies Endurance and Willpower)
* Flin (Fortifies Strength and Endurance)
*2 (not 1, but TWO) Scrolls of ""Purity of Body""&nbsp; 

Well, it showed that I was Cured, so after about 5 minutes, it still showed me as Cured, so I went ahead and saved.&nbsp; Well, yesterday, I open the saved file, and it showed me as having ""Black-Heart Blight"",&nbsp; I Hypochondriac'd YET AGAIN, but this time after a minute.&nbsp; It showed me as STILL being infected with that fucking Blight disease!!!&nbsp; So, out of pure RAGE, I uninstalled the ENTIRE game, and all the save games.&nbsp; A month and a half, down the drain, bc of a fucking corrupted save file!!&nbsp; 

Hopefully, if I buy Oblivion, these fucking problems won't be in it.&nbsp; I still have to buy the two expansion sets to Morrowind (Tribunal and Bloodmoon).&nbsp; But for the time being, I'm taking a lil time off of Morrow-crack, and maybe playing Judge Dredd: Dredd vs Death, or UT 2k4 again.&nbsp;"

"event","Things have been ""Unique"" to say the least, lately.&nbsp; The power supply to the Ultra-Beast blew out, and it took UPS(hit) over two days to deliver a replacement that was sent via overnight (which means it's supposed to arrive by 10:30am the next morning, not 3pm, two days later).&nbsp; But, it arrived, so I'm just glad the Ultra-Beast is up and running again.&nbsp; 

On another computer-related note, about two days after my last regular LJ entry, my brother actually found a laptop computer for me.&nbsp; He works for Ray's trash, and was working the Carmel route (so yeah, richie-ass waste-shits).&nbsp; Hell, the ONLY thing wrong with this laptop is that the battery doesn't seem to hold a charge.&nbsp; It works PERFECTLY when connected to the powerbrick.&nbsp; It's a Dell Latitude CP-x model laptop.&nbsp; The quick specs:
500mhz&nbsp; P3 processor
128mb memory (upgradeable to 512mb)
6GB hard drive (thinking of replacing with a larger hard drive)
Windows ME (another reason for upgrading to a larger hard drive.&nbsp; LOL)

Other than the minor inconvenience with the battery, it works PERFECTLY!!&nbsp; Hell, it even came with a modular swap-out floppy drive, the powerbrick, owner's manual, and alot of other stuff!!&nbsp; What does urk me is that the previous owner was as foolishly wasteful as he/she was.&nbsp; Hell, instead of donating it to a school, charity, Good-Will, or even Dell's pc recycling program, they just simply cleaned the system and shitcanned it.&nbsp; Well, hey, at least I have a school computer now.&nbsp; ^_^

Lately, I've been feeling pretty pissed off.&nbsp; I've been exhibiting Road Rage like beyond belief.&nbsp; Hell, last wknd, I almost got into a fight with some douchebag at Kroger's here in Pissfield.&nbsp; I dunno if it's just me being subconsciously anxious about college in the fall, repressed anger from wrongfully losing my job, or whatever.&nbsp; Maybe I just needta start lifting again.&nbsp; That always seemed to help and do me some good.&nbsp; It's been over 2 yrs now, so yeeeeeeah.&nbsp; I really needta hit the weights, bad.&nbsp; 

But yes, I forgot to mention, I do begin college again in the Fall.&nbsp; So BOOYAH!!!&nbsp; Hell, ALOT of friends from college (before I hadta leave), and friends from LARPing are excited to see my big ass on campus again!!&nbsp; I'm excited!&nbsp; I get to finish my degree, and flirt with some hot ladies.&nbsp; LOL&nbsp; 

Also,&nbsp; I've been feeling the Siren's call of music hit me again these past few months.&nbsp; I've been wanting to relearn guitar badly.&nbsp; Maybe it's just me seeing how the state of hard rock/heavy metal is in a piss-poor coma of a state.&nbsp; Sorry, that's my opinion.&nbsp; It's just that, instead of seeing groups making music that inspires, empowers, enriches&nbsp; listeners' lives, I've been seeing cookie-cutter groups just ""going through the motions.""&nbsp; I'm tired of seeing Mtv (when the RARELY do play music anymore) push these emo/screamo/hipster groups down everyones' throats, and claim that it's ""rock n roll.""&nbsp; 

To me, rock n roll is NOT about a bunch of androgynous twerps singing ""Dance, Dance,"" making out with other guys ""'cause the girls like it"" (Caleb will get that inside joke), and slitting their wrists (bc of some girl/guy that they just met, but is ""so beautiful,"" that they're willing to die for them).&nbsp; ::Rolls Eyes:::&nbsp; To me, Rock 'N Roll is about rebellion.&nbsp; It's about grabbing the listener, and hitting them with an energy that makes them feel empowered.&nbsp; 

With me, I want to build a band again.&nbsp; I want to make music that does what PanterA did for me......&nbsp; Grabbed me by my throat, and hit me with an energy that made me feel empowered to face the world, give it a big ""Fuck You,"" and bullcharge right at it head-on with NO fear whatsoever.&nbsp; I want to make the listener feel like they can take on anything, and succeed.&nbsp; I want the 98lb ""weakling"" to not fear marching into a moshpit proudly.&nbsp; I want that kid that sits alone at lunch to be proud that he's not one of the ""sheeple"", and can PROULDLY think for himself.&nbsp; I want that loner, ostracized by everyone, to have the inner strength to look at every challenge before him/her, and to know that he/she will not give up until he/she has succeeded.&nbsp; Yes, I was THAT underdog growing up, but I'm DAMN proud I was the underdog.&nbsp; I want people out there, in their darkest hour, to be able to know that someone has been through what they've been through, and that fact being the spark that gives them the inner-strength to fight on, against all odds.&nbsp; 

Yes, I'm extremely passionate about music.&nbsp; I'm tired, and it's late.&nbsp; I better head to sleep, bc I have a shitload of chores to finish tomorrow.&nbsp; 'Nite"

"event","Well, the damn replacement power supply I waited over two months for, blew out last night.  It's only been operational for about two to three months now, and it goes kapoot last night.  Figures.  Today, I called NewEgg, and the damn model was discontinued.  Thankfully, they allowed me to choose a new model, and have overnighted it to me.  I hopefully will receive it tomorrow sometime in the morning.  So, that's taken care of.  

But, on a lighter note, the downtime gave me an opportunity to do something I have been wanting to do for a lil while now.  I took apart my graphics card to replace the thermal adhesive.  I'm damn glad I did.  The manufacturer used too much thermal tape (that's known for being PATHETIC in regards to heat transfer) on the memory, and didn't use enough [ADD: Quality] thermal adhesive on the gpu and another chip.  After removing the thermal tape and chintzy-ass thermal adhesive, I replaced it with Arctic Silver 5.  I'm expecting the graphics card to be ALOT more stable now that I've created a much more quality seal between the gpu/memory and the heatsink.  If any of you ever think about doing something similar, I need to give you some tips for proper application:

* For the main processor (CPU, GPU, etc.), use about a pea- to small bead-size drop on the center of the processor.

* Use a flexible card (credit card, library card, etc.), and use it to spread the Arctic Silver 5 evenly over the desired chip.

* Repeat for the GPU memory.

* Make sure to not use too much, or else the excess will ""glop"" onto the surrounding PCB.  

* When removing the old thermal adhesive, use a lint-free cloth to remove the majority.  Finish cleaning the remaining old adhesive with another lint-free cloth damp with isopropyl (aka rubbing) alcohol.  

* Also, (if doing this procedure to a graphics card), make sure that when you remove the screws, then set them up in an arrangement similar to how they are laid out on the graphics card.  


OR

* Call me, the Bigman, and I'll do it for you.  ~_^  You just provide the Actic Silver 5, and I'll probably only charge like $20 to do that for a graphics card.

You represent ideal love: innocence, trust, exhilaration and joy.
You demonstrate the harmony of opposites, two sides coming together.
At times, you also represent the struggle between what is right and what is tempting.
Control is an issue for you, especially when you don't know your reasons for choosing something.

Your fortune:

You have an important choice you need to make about love, and it will be a difficult choice to make.
You are likely struggling between the love you crave and the love that is right.
In the end, you will choose what you crave, even if it's bad for you.
Because without what you crave, you will feel empty and incomplete.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/whattarotcardareyouquiz/"">What Tarot Card Are You?</a></div>"

"event","Let's see, where the heck should I start?<br /><br /><strong>1. My knee surgery, and the bastards at OH-Hell</strong><br />On May 1st, I had to undergo a major&nbsp;<span class=""postbody""> 5-hr surgery on my left knee. Let's just say it was BAAAAD. My ACL was ruptured to the point they had to fully replace it with a cadaver ACL (so, I can actually brag that I'm part undead... <strong>BRAINS</strong>, LOL). Both Meniscuses (think circular shock absorbers within the knee joint) were tore. The medial meniscus actually had a displaced buckhandle tear. My PCL was subluxated, and there was possible bone effusion. <br /><br />On Friday, May 12th, I received a letter, via FedEx, from OH-Hell stating that, (summarized) <em>""If you don't go against Doctor's orders and return to work by Monday, May 15th, you're fired and your benefits are terminated.""&nbsp;</em> <br /><br />Well, I called the doctor and he faxed OH-Hell 3 pages worth of documentation stating what was wrong with my knee, what all had to be done for my surgery, and how long I would be out of commission.&nbsp; Well, I received an offline msg from a co-worker stating, <em>""Hey Will, I heard that they canned you today.""&nbsp; </em><br /><br />MIND YOU, that was still Friday the 12th when I received that offline msg!!!&nbsp; So, the fuckers got out of having to pay for a <strong>WORK-RELATED</strong>&nbsp; injury!!&nbsp; You know what?!&nbsp;<font size=""4""><strong> FUCK CORPORATE AMERICA!!!</strong></font>&nbsp; I even had to quit physical therapy, bc of the shit they pulled!!&nbsp; That, and they've pulled more shit keeping me from getting unemployment!!!<br /><br />Well, that's now out of my system......<br /><br /><br /> <strong>2. My overwhelming boredom, and rediscovery of television</strong><br />I honestly don't know if I've mentioned this already, but while I was recovering from surgery, I wasn't online much (part of the reason of my absence from LJ as well).&nbsp; I mainly laid on the couch and watched G4 Tech tv all the time.&nbsp; That, and my rediscovery of cable tv (augmented by digital cable) and console gaming, I feel like I regained a part of me that was lost.&nbsp; <br /><br />But, when I was online, I was mainly playing Unreal Tournament 2004 and Elder Scrolls IV: Morrowind.&nbsp; Or, as I now refer to them, ""Morrow-crack"", and Unreal Tourna-crack 2004.""&nbsp;&nbsp; LOL&nbsp; Let's just say that I'd play Unreal Tournament TOO much!!&nbsp; Hell, for a short while, I was starting to get TOO good at that game!!<br /><br />Hell, this one sniper match, me and this other guy were playing against three guys.&nbsp; We won, 34 to 18.&nbsp; I scored 31 of the 34 frags!!!!<br /><br /><br /><strong>3. My mom's computer, and ""Modder's Madness""</strong><br />Well, during the time I was recovering from surgery, my mom had me order parts for her to have a decent computer.&nbsp; Mind you, I built this computer for less than $325!!!!&nbsp; Here's the specs:<br /><br /><strong>*</strong>AMD Sempron 2400+ <br /><strong>*</strong>PC Chips Skt A mobo <br /><strong>*</strong>512mb pc2100 memory <br /><strong>*</strong>Antec case w/ 300-watt ps <br /><strong>*</strong>ATI Rage 128mb graphics card <br /><strong>*</strong>Creative Soundblaster Audigy SE soundcard <br /><strong>*</strong>80GB Western Digital hard drive <br /><strong>*</strong>40GB Western Digital hard drive (storage) <br /><strong>*</strong>DVD-Rom optical drive <br /></span><span class=""postbody"">*Iomega Zip-100 internal zipdisk drive</span><br /><span class=""postbody""><br />And what I refer to as my ""Modder's Madness,"" is that I've been so damn bored, that I've been opening up my pc case, and tinkering with stuff, just so I can have something to keep my mind occupied.&nbsp; Hell, today, I removed the original cpu thermal paste from one of my computers and used Arctic Silver 5, just so I can see if that will lower cpu temps.&nbsp; Hell, I'm almost tempted to see if I can do the same thing with the GPU and it's heatsink/fan assembly, and see if that will lower the temps on that as well.&nbsp; There have been times where I'd be playing Morrowind for pc, and my computer would suddenly restart.&nbsp; I'd check the cpu temps, via BIOS, and they'd only be AT MOST low- to mid- 30's C&nbsp; (and that was under a full load).&nbsp; My guess is that maybe the GPU might be overheating.&nbsp; Maybe tomorrow or this wknd, I will replace the original thermal paste with some Arctic Silver 5, and see if that will be a better alternative.&nbsp; <br /><br />See, if I had the money, yes I would buy an aftermarker GPU cooler, but since my graphics card is a GeForce 7800 GS (which means that it's an AGP 7800), most aftermarket GPU coolers won't fit on it.&nbsp; (<strong>FUCKIN' DAMMIT!!</strong>)&nbsp; So, until I can find one that will fit my graphics card, Arctic Silver 5 seems to be my only option for possibly cooling it down.&nbsp; *Shrugs*&nbsp; Otherwise, the performance on this graphics card is pretty damn sweet.&nbsp; <br /><br />Hell, the graphics card (at core clockspeed) is 375mhz GPU, 1200mhz memory.&nbsp; Well, I bought the ""SUPERCLOCK"" edition, which is 460mhz GPU, 1350mhz memory.&nbsp; So, you see where I think the graphics card might be overheating.&nbsp; lol<br /><br /><strong>4. Some ideas I've been having lately</strong><br />Well, I've been wanting to relearn HTML, bc I actually had a blast creating webpages in HTML.&nbsp; <strong>Except</strong> for that one period of a few wks, when I was spending 7-days/wk,&nbsp; 8-12hrs/day doing this one project for a class.&nbsp; During that period of a few wks, I honestly swear I was feeling like Neo from the Matrix and seeing shit in code!!&nbsp; LOL<br /><br />I've also been wanting to relearn how to use the Unreal Editor for the Unreal Engine.&nbsp; I used to know the rudiments for it, until Windows fucked up my Unreal Editor on the ""Workhorse.""&nbsp; I was working on this one map for Unreal Tournament 2003/2004 that was QUITE ambitious to say the least.&nbsp; LOL&nbsp; Lemme explain the details:<br /><br />*The map would be based on the town of Plainfield (as far west as Gilley's Antique Mall, as far North as like Rockville Rd, as far south as the Hendricks/Morgan Cty line, and as far east as the Adessa car auction site).&nbsp; LOTS of virtual square miles.&nbsp; LOL<br /><br />*Capable of handling anywhere from 256, maybe 512, possibly up to 1024 players on the map AT ONCE!!<br /><br />*Multiple options for victory (like in Star Wars: Battlefront).&nbsp; Control all the teleport nodes, Control the PSI/Cinergy node, or score 5120 frags.<br /><br />*Options for vehicles<br /><br />See, my idea for this map was that there are MMORPG's out there, so <strong>WHY NOT</strong> have MMOFPS'es?!&nbsp; I was also inspired a lil bit my the Lord of the Rings movies, in that the epic battles are something everyone wants when they play online (regardless if it's via MMORPG or FPS).&nbsp; I wanted to have a map to where there was no real time limit.&nbsp; That you could explore all you want, and maybe never come across another ally or enemy, <strong>OR</strong> you could spawn right in the heat of a HUGE frag-fest battle!!<br /><br />I also wanted it to be a map that would have a KICKASS soundtrack!&nbsp; Here's some of the songs I'd <strong>ideally </strong>like to have as a soundtrack:<br />*Seraphim Shock- Prey<br />*The Berzerker- Painless<br />*Strapping Young Lad- Centipede<br />*Machine Head- Davidian<br />*Mushroomhead- Sun Doesn't Rise<br />*Black Label Society- Destruction Overdrive<br />*Soilwork- Overload<br />*Brand New Sin- SPP<br />*Nothingface- Can't Wait For Violence<br />*Machine Head- Bite the Bullet<br />*Black Label Society- Life/Birth/Blood/Doom<br />*DryKillLogic- Paper Tiger<br /><br />There's more songs that I cannot recall of the top of my head, but I believe the songlist is around 30 songs that I'd ideally would like to have as the soundtrack for the map, instead of the usual UT aural-fodder.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Hey y'all.&nbsp; It's pretty late, and I need to head to sleep.&nbsp; I'll try to post again soon.&nbsp; Laterz&nbsp; <br /></span>"

"event","Hey y'all, what's up?  Found out this past Friday, that I need to have surgery on my knee, and today, I found out what the extent of the damage is.  

Both meniscuses (think shock absorbers in your knee joint) are tore.  The medial (inner) meniscus has a displaced buckethandle tear.  The lateral meniscus also has meniscal cysts on the side.  My ACL (Anterior Cruciate Ligament, the stabilizer ligament in the knee) is so far gone, they're gonna have to use a cadaver ACL implant.  My PCL (Posterior Cruciate Ligament, a lesser stabilizer ligament) is sublaxated.  And I may also have possible bone effusion.   And everyone wonders why I've been limping the past couple months.  

Today, during the pre-surgery consultation, I found out I may be out of commission for up to 3-5 months, bc the situation is considered THAT bad.  *Rolls eyes*  Great, just when I thought I was starting to get out of debt, this shit comes along.  

Well, I finally got a computer up and running for my mom again.  This one I was gonna get up and running for her, turned out to be DOA.  And it would've been a nice one too.  ;_;  Granted, it wouldn't bring benchmarks to their knees, but it'd certainly been a hemi for what she does (simple websurfing, digital pics, bills, watching movies, etc).  Well, eventually, I would like to get one running for her that's better than what she currently has a 700mhz amd athlon, 768mb of memory, 40gb hd, dvd-rom, ATI Rage 128mb.  

Well, I think I'm gonna head to sleep.  I'll tty'all later.  Keep me in your thoughts/prayers/virgin sacrifices/etc.  LOL  Laterz"

"event","Evening y'all.&nbsp; This past Friday, I went to the hospital, bc of how my knee and ankle were feeling.&nbsp; According to the doctors (which were not much of doctors in my opinion), I supposedly had ""only a little bit"" of fluid on my left knee, even though it feels like my knee could rival Geist Resevoir.&nbsp; And that my ankle only has Tendinitis, even though I saw the x-rays, and there was a HUGE lump right in the joint of the ankle.&nbsp; That's Hendrick Regional Health for you.&nbsp; *Rolls eyes*

I now have that bill paid off for college (thanks overtime!&nbsp; *goofy infomercial smile*), so I'll be able to go back in the Fall.&nbsp; *WOOT*&nbsp; Now, this coming week, I'm gonna place my order for the graphics card, and maybe something else.&nbsp; I'm tempted to add this one power supply to my Newegg wishlist, but I'm not sure, yet.&nbsp; It's a pretty sweet, 700-watt power supply&nbsp; *tehehe*.&nbsp; Also this one 130mm fan that I want.&nbsp; I'd have to mod my case's front panel, but it'd be worth it for the extra air intake.&nbsp; 

But some bad news though.&nbsp; Found out, I have two other bills that I never even knew about, when I finished paying off this one medical bill.&nbsp; Urgh, makes you wonder about the ACTUAL cost of the medical field, and how much is simply swindler's profit.&nbsp; Well, I'm tempted to, after I get my tax checks, start a 2nd bank account, that bill collectors wouldn't know about.&nbsp; That way, I could have some extra money for me when needed.&nbsp; I'm tired of my mom, grandmother, and I having to get by on the skin of our teeth, while the bills NEVER seem to end.&nbsp; Sometimes, I get sick of it, and start fantasizing that I'm Tyler Durdin from Fight Club.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, sometimes I crave anarchy, but I also realize that law and order are also necessary to make sure that my family, friends and loved ones are safe.&nbsp; 

Well, I'm hoping to get ahold of this one guy I worked with at OH-Hell, bc he was wanting me to upgrade this one computer for his son a month or two ago.&nbsp; But this computer is so friggin old, that it'd be like trying to turn fossils back into a dinosaur.&nbsp; LOL&nbsp; By the end of the week, I should have a computer ready for him, that'd only cost like $200.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
* Originally a Dell XPS 700, circa '99-'00
* 700mhz PIII processor
* 768mb pc100 memory (the memory is maxed out on it, LOL)
* 58-60Gb HDD space (40GB and an 18.46GB)
* 52x Creative Labs cd-rom
* Creative Labs soundcard
* 3dfx graphics card (either 128- or 256-mb, not sure), w/ tv-out
* 3Com 10/100 NIC
* Diamond Multimedia Systems 56k modem
* Kickass Cable management job

Am I asking about the right price for a setup like that?&nbsp; I know&nbsp; it&nbsp; won't bring any benchmark programs to their knees, but it's more than capable of running the childrens' games he's wanting to run on it for his son to play.&nbsp; (Blue's Clues, Barney, Dora the Explorer, etc.)&nbsp; If possible, could someone tell me if I'm asking about the right price??&nbsp; Jeremy, Mina, maybe you two could give me an idea if that'd be the right price or not?

Speaking of computers, Saturday night, Chris S (Joe the Malk from BR) had a mini-LAN party that consisted of me, him, his brother Eugene, and his father Marvin.&nbsp; I actually had a great time!!&nbsp; It was a blast!!!&nbsp; I also remembered why I don't accept invites to open-geared LAN parties often.&nbsp; My server tower case, 19-inch CRT monitor, and a duffle bag for my keyboard, mouse, game binder, and headset all weigh a TON!! &nbsp;&nbsp; LOL&nbsp;

"event","Hey y'all, sorry it's been forever since I posted something to my LJ entries other than simple quiz results.  I've been mainly busy with work, and I'm sick of OHL.  

I swear, since they've brought in a new big boss from St. Louis, the whole warehouse is becoming more like a ""one nation under surveillence"" wet dream for ""Dubya,"" bc this big boss keeps running his mouth about how shit's being stolen.  Even though, he says that it definitely is Night Shift's doing, he keeps raggin' on and on to us.... LIKE WE CARE!!  We're dayshift, he's walking the fucking floor every few minutes, so if someone WERE to be stealing from dayshift, he'd catch them lickity-split.  

What pisses me off even more, is that this big boss is a POMPOUS ASS.  
1. NO ONE talks to me in a work environment like a fucking 4 yr old.  
2. This fuckbag makes BLATANT fat jokes about me in morning meetings, when he has NO room to talk.  Fuck, he looks like a fucking beach ball with legs and a bad flat-top.  
3. His exact words this morning:
  ""Hey, you all know we're supposed to have really bad weather tonight, right?!""
   ::Everyone nods and says ""yes""::
  ""Well, then you have NO reason to be late tomorrow.  Oh, and you all will be here an hour early, bc it's end of Quarter.  Oh, and expect to work Saturday.""

Now, y'all see why I'm looking for a new job.  

In other news, about a month ago, my stepfather walked out on my mom.  It's a mixed-blessing, if anything.  Good, in the sense that a major leech and burden is no longer in our lives.  Bad, in that he stole THOUSANDS of dollars worth of shit from us.  Hell, the fuckstain stole fucking wedding pictures, and baby pics of my little brother (whom helped the piece of shit out).  He even took ALL the friggin tools from the house, INCLUDING stuff that belonged to my grandfather!!!  About HALF of our dvd's are missing.  

He was letting my brother and his fucking freakazoid nephew, Tyler, come right on into our house, while my mom and I were at work!!!  Yeah, no wonder my beers went from 2 dozen, down to three.  I've only had THREE the whole time I've had them (from around Thanksgiving when I got them).  That, and shit's missing from my room.  And people wonder why I've disowned my brother.  

But, it's a blessing, bc I can actually watch tv again.  See, my stepfather would sit in the living room 24-7, watching the same THREE channels (CMT, GAC, and the Speed Channel) day-in, and day-out.  And ANYTIME (even wknds) I wanted to watch tv or a dvd in the livingroom, the fuckstain would pull his huffy-puffy act and his ""oh, I want my way and to hog the tv, so I'll go sit outside in the cold, so Deb *my mom* will make William get out of the living room, so I don't miss my redneck racing series"" bullshit.  

Yeah, I was basically stuck in my room all the time.  So, I'm rediscovering television now.  LOL  That, and I'm in love with digital cable now.  Hell, I can watch friggin heavy metal music videos ANYTIME I want to!!  Hell, this morning, I was watching a Children of Bodom music video as I was eating breakfast.  Now THAT's da shiznit.  LOL  That, and when there's nothing good on tv, I can just check out the free movies on the ON DEMAND menu.  ^_^  So yeah, I'm like a kid in a candystore with digital cable.  LOL

I am getting close to having that college bill paid off to where I can go back in the Fall.  *WOOT*   I need the social atmosphere, bc working where I do, I am having withdrawls from social interaction with people who can carry a decent conversation with me.   No wonder I'm addicted to LARPing.  Hell, it's one of the FEW times I can socially interact with people who have IQ's higher than they can count on their fingers.  

Yes, there are a few that I'm friends with at work that do have intelligence to them, but the five or six of us actually SCARE the rest of the workers, maybe because the intelligence of 5 or 6 people is GREATER than the combined intelligence of almost 100+ other employees.  LOL  

Sorry, but I've gotten sick of working for 8.60/hr, for breaking my body down to shit.  I can barely walk.  My rt ankle, and my left knee are ROYALLY fucked up from being on concrete 8-12 hrs per day, 5-6 days a wk.  My back is stiffer than an oak 2x4.  I want something better.  

That's why I want to get back into college.  I want to make sure I have a future.  Yes, I also wanna party again, but mainly, I don't wanna end up going down the same path my mom is on.  She's killed herself to raise my brother and I, and she's a mess now.  Hell, we found out a few wks ago that she's got a Bipolar disorder.  I don't wanna end up with a broken body and a broken mind.  I don't wanna feel like I have no future.  I don't wanna kill myself for a pissly 8.60/hr.  I want a life I feel I deserve.  

Yes, I ideally would like to have the ""American dream"" lifestyle.  The whole ""wife, 2.5 kids, white picket fence""-kinda thing.  I want to be able to enjoy those things as well.  I want to come home, and be able to enjoy spending time with my family.  Instead, I come home from work, and do a few chores, and am normally in bed, DEAD asleep, by 8pm normally. Tonight is an exception, bc I'm making this entry.  I don't wanna continue living in this same, 2 bdrm double that I've lived in for the past 16+ yrs.  I want a home, a decently large one.  I want to be able to make sure my mom, my grandmother, a wife, and children are all there, so I know they'll be safe.  

I don't wanna keep worrying about my grandmother suffering the same end my grandfather went through.  It KILLS me every time I relive what I saw that night in my thoughts and dreams.  Seeing my grandfather, my pride and joy, lying on the ground, convulsing and twitching, fighting for life, while two fucking paramedics looked at him with dumbfounded looks and actually asked each other, ""What should we do?""  I actually grabbed BOTH of them (both of whom, weighed more than me), and THREW them against a wall, while I administered CPR to my grandfather.  I knew he was fading, but I had to at least try.  I couldn't just let him suffer, and me do nothing while I saw his eyes scream for help.  It took like 6 cops to pull me off my grandfather when I was performing CPR.  After getting pulled outside, one tried threatening me with legal mumbo-jumbo.  I don't remember what I said, but I do remember the pig crying like a baby by the time I got through blowing up at him.  

I don't wanna go through that again.  I don't wanna worry about my grandmother suffering the same fate.  I want those close to me to be close by, so I know they'll be protected.  By now, many, if not all of you, know I'm a VERY protective/territorial individual.  I can't help it.  I want to keep those who matter most to me as safe as I can keep them.  I am the same way with my friends.  

Hell, I'm like a fucking rabid bear when someone tries fucking with those close to me.  I don't know of anyone else that would bullcharge into the side of an SUV to get at a group of punk-ass teenagers who made the threat that they were gonna ""kick my mom's big, fat, bitch, cunt-ass.""  Supposedly, I swung open the van door, jumped out, shrugged off my jacket, and charged, crumpling the side of the front passenger door,and made it scoot over a foot. Next, I supposedly was trying to put my fist through the crumplage, and then nearly went for the window, but my mom and brother grabbed an arm each before I could do that.  I do remember that when I came out of that livid state, I was so pissed that even two hours later, I was ready to destroy something/someone.  I hadta drink two beers when I got home that night just to come back down.  Sorry, but I'm just protective by nature.  

Hey, it's getting late, I've been rambling, and my dog needsta pee.  I better take her out, and head to sleep.  Waking up at 4am is NOT my idea of fun.  'nite y'all."

Ivy Dragon's are closely linked to their environments and well in tune with nature. They are the protectors of the forest, and are sometimes worshiped by druids and elves.'<br />Ivy dragons gain their name from the powers they have over the plants and animals in their domain. These dragons often link themselves so closely to their territory that they actually entwine part of their life force into the area.'<br />Because of this, an Ivy Dragons territory is almost always lush and beautiful. The sky is unusually clear and animal life flourishes in a way that seems magical. Ivy Dragons are fierce protectors and will defend their domain with their life, if need be. Ivy Dragon's are have a deep emerald coloring, they are medium sized dragons. Ivy Dragon's are excellent shape shifters. They can use their shape changing abilities to form tendrils or extra limbs in battle to aid them in combat.<br />'<br />This Dragons favorite elements are: Jade, Forests, and Protection<br /><br />http://Dragonhame.Com<br /><br />*You know y'all,&nbsp; it seems that I have a very protective and nurturing nature to me.&nbsp; LOL*"

Your vivid emotions and imagination takes you away from this world
So much so that you tend to live in your head most of the time
You have great dreams and ambitions that could be the envy of all...
But for you, following through with your dreams is a bit difficult

You are charming, endearing, and people tend to love you.
Forgiving and tolerant, you see the world through rose colored glasses.
Underneath it all, you have a ton of passion that you hide from others.
Always hopeful, you tend to expect positive outcomes in your life.

Propensity for Monogamy:

Your propensity for monogamy is high.
You find it easy to be devoted and loyal to one person.
And in return, you expect the same from who you love.
Any sign of straying, and you'll end things.

Experience Level:

Your experience level is medium.
You probably have had a couple significant loves.
And you may have even had your heart broken.
But you haven't really dated a wide variety of people.

Dominance:

Your dominance is medium.
You tend to be the one with more power.
You aren't a total control freak in relationships..
But of course you don't mind getting you way!

Cynicism:

Your cynicism is medium.
You'd like to believe in true and everlasting love...
But you've definitely been burned enough to know better.
You're still an optimist, but you also are a realist.

Independence:

Your independence is low.
This doesn't mean you're dependent in relationships..
It does mean that you don't have any problem sharing your life.
In your opinion, the best part of being in love is being together.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/thefivevariablelovetest/"">The Five Variable Love Test</a></div>"

A lot of people find this style romantic, but sometimes you are going to have to work up the nerve and ask your crush out, because if your crush is shy too, you may both like each other and never know.

<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Location:</span>  The Old Church
<br>

<br>
The Old Church, a largely-forgotten place, meant as a sanctuary for the
holy, now abandoned and left to disrepair. A place that, in recent
months, has had visitors. Those who serve, and their masters of a more
nocturnal persuassion. Not even they could forsee what will happen this
night.
<br>

<br>In the basement of this church, in a largely hidden room, laid the
body of Dragon. Though, he had been rescued from the Giovanni, the
hulking body never moved. Even after the stake had been removed, and
the wound healed, Dragon's body simply laid there. The motionless shell
cleverly hid the war that raged on the inside like a fever dream. <br>

<br>
""Dragon, how willing are you to help bring Sieger back? .... Well,
that's too bad man, because you've been volunteered for Sieger's new
body.....""

<br>""Dragon, your fate is this.... You shall become fully blood bound
to me, and you shall give both Mr. Psolmes and Mr. Storm each some
blood of yours, so they can study it. You should be thankful. Had you
resisted, instead of turning yourself in, you would have been simply
destroyed....""

""Oh no....no no no. Drakar, you are the culmination of a lifetime's
work. Let me connect the dots for you. 1940, Germany, a man by the name
of Dr. Simon Glosier was embattled with several Nazi programs to create
an elite fighting machine. You were the product of such discovery.
Well, one product. There were.....others. Flash forward to after the
war. Glosier escapes Nazi Germany and ends up teaching Biological
pneumetics at a midwestern University. As to not draw attention, he
changes his name to the more stylized Dr. Lawerence Gordon.""
<br>

<br>
<span style=""color: red;""><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Leigh.....
Leigh..... You seem to forget the true date.... September 5,
1666,...... London...... The Great Fire..... The date you learned
fear..... The date you learned to fear..... <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">ME</span>......</span></span>
<br>

<br>
""Yessir, Mr. Leigh, the body just twitched a lil bit, or I'm just
seeing things,"" said a ghouled guard watching over the body. He'd spent
all night, thus far, guarding the body. He wondered why this individual
had to be so important to Leigh. <br>

<br>
<span style=""color: red;""><span style=""font-style: italic;"">You said Leigh, you <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">know</span> where he's at......</span></span>
<br>

<br>
""Yo, big guy, you awake?!  I think I just saw your leg twitch,"" Said the guard as he shook Dragon to awaken him.
<br>

<br>
A menacing, primal growl started to escape the body's lips. Before the
guard could react, the body grabbed him by the arm, and by the throat.
The guard reacted in fear, as he saw the reptilian eyes of the one
Leigh referred to as ""The Dragon."" This menacing monster had him
dangling, pinned against the wall. <br>

<br>
The smell of urine became omnipresent as the guard watched in silenced
fright, as the reptilian eyes washed over black with a blue edging <span style=""font-style: italic;"">(OOC: Think like the Lycans from ""Underworld"")</span>
<br>

<br>
<span style=""color: red;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">WHERE IS LEIGH?!?!......</span></span>  The voice of a roaring bellow that shook the room.  
<br>

<br>
""Calm down! Calm down!!  Please, calm down!!  He should be here, Dragon,"" said the now fear-stricken guard.
<br>

<br>
<span style=""color: red;"">You <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">EVER</span> call me that name ever again, I shall silence your tongue for you by removing your <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">ENTIRE</span> lower jaw!!</span> 
<br>

<br>
""Y-ye-yea-yes sir! What do you wish to be known as?"" quivered the guard
as urine and feces now intermingled in a nauseating cacophony of
blatant fear. <br>

<br>
<span style=""color: red;"">Magnus....  Magnus Von Gritt.....</span> Magnus' eyes now returned to their original reptillian look as he put the guard back on his feet.  
<br>

<br>
""Th-thank you Dragon, err I mean Magnus,"" quivered the guard as Magnus
turned away, only to see the monsterous form turn right around as he
accidently mentioned the name ""Dragon.""
<br>

<br>
<span style=""color: red;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!.......</span></span>  The bellow caused those others, mainly ghouls, in the lower level of the Church to gather in the adjoining room.  
<br>

<br>They listened in fright as the sound of the screaming guard was
abruptly silenced. The next sound they heard made the listeners sick,
as they heard what best could be described as something along the lines
of wet popping and the tearing of wet bed sheets. They next heard the
sound of crunching bone and could easily smell a copper scent in the
air.
<br>

<br>The hallway down to this room was not lit, but they saw the door
slowly creek open. The only light was the dim bulb to the lamp hanging
over the table. They then saw a slumped body get tossed onto the table
like there was almost no effort involved. Then, came the footsteps.
<br>

<br>The steps came slowly as they saw a menacing outline of a large
individul stand in the doorway. They trembled as the eyes began to
slowly glow an insidious crimson.
<br>

<br>
The voice was that of a low, controlled bellow <span style=""color: red;"">Tell Leigh, that when he arrives he is to come in here, ALONE.</span>
<br>

<br>An hour later, Leigh arrived, only to be greeted by frightened
ghouls. When he made his way down to the hallway leading to the room,
the smell of copper wafted his nose. When he entered the room, there
was an obviouly mangled body. Upon closer inspection, he saw the
rigor-mortis-gripped look of fear forever etched onto the now dead
guard's eyes, as the lower jaw had been ripped off and shoved into the
body's chest. <br>

<br>
In an insidious and sarcastic overtone <span style=""color: red;"">What's the matter, Leigh?  Don't tell me you forgot about me.....</span>  The voice, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">THAT</span> voice, drove the fear of God into Leigh.  A voice he had not heard in centuries....  
<br>

<br>
His eyes widened, as he slowly looked up from the guard's body and
slowly turned around to see the menacing form that was once Dragon as
the Cloak of Shadows pulled away from Magnus.....</span><br>

You're a happy person - you have a good amount of self-esteem, and are socially healthy.  While this isn't a social dysfunction per se, you're definitely not normal.  Consider yourself lucky: you walk that fine line between 'normal' and being outright narcissistic.  You're rare - which is something else to be happy about.<br /><br />

"event","Hey y'all.&nbsp; Just mainly working.&nbsp; I got told that my name's
been put in to get hired on full-time.&nbsp; That means a raise and
actual insurance.&nbsp; But my mom has planned that I'm going to drive
out to the Bum-Fucked-Egypt town of Pittsboro, and spend my ENTIRE
Saturday waiting for a job interview.&nbsp; Fuck that.&nbsp; The job is
only paying 8/hr (the same I'm making now, urgh), and we'd be worse
off, bc of the drive out there to BFE eating gas out the ass. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
In good news, I'm turning 24 on January 30th, but since that's on a
Monday (boo!!), some friends from college are ""kidnapping"" me Friday
the 27th, and we're planning on bringing my 24th b-day in
RIGHT!!!&nbsp; ~_^ <br>
<br>
The basic plan is that the entire crew is first heading to Hooters
(either the one on 38th street or the one downtown), and then to
Dancers.&nbsp; Yes, Hooters then a *ahem* ""Gentleman's Club"".&nbsp;
LOL&nbsp; I know, a person's 24th B-day isn't normally a big deal, but
it's a big deal to me, bc the past few yrs have been a really dark and
bleak time in my life.&nbsp; Things are starting to turn for the better
*knocks on wood*, so this B-day's a bit of a big deal/celebration for
me. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
But, like I was gonna say, y'all are invited to join in.&nbsp; All I ask is that:<br>
1. You have to be at least 21.<br>
2. If you plan on getting crunk/drunk/fucking wasted, please have a DD or enough money for cab fare. <br>
<br>
These two requests are obvious, bc I REALLY DON'T wanna worry that good
friends made it home safely.&nbsp; Even though I'm crazy, I'm not
stupid.&nbsp; I care ALOT about my friends, so yeah, I wanna make damn
sure my friends are as safe as can be. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
In LARPing News, I've missed the past two I2T's.&nbsp; The last one,
because my mom had to have emergency surgery.&nbsp; Translation: She
had to have a tooth pulled, and acted so overly melodramatic, that
you'd think she'd had full-invasive surgery.&nbsp; *Rolls eyes* &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Tonight's I2T, I couldn't get a ride.&nbsp; Urgh.&nbsp; LOL<br>
<br>
In the Dark Venice arena, this past game they ran the ""Midnight
Circus,"" and I LOVED it!!&nbsp; Me and Dustin were being friggin
""Kindred Sleuths.""&nbsp; If I wasn't celebrating my 24th B-day, I'd be
at Dark Venice, bc they're running the ""Midnight Circus"" again.&nbsp;
Oh hell yeah, it's fucking fun.&nbsp; LOL<br>
<br>
In Tech-head news, The Beast is down.&nbsp; The power supply blew
out.&nbsp; *whimper*&nbsp;&nbsp; All I can think of is that it was a
freak accident with bad power supply.&nbsp; I know I wasn't overloading
it, bc it was a friggin 550-watt power supply.&nbsp; I know it wasn't
the processor, bc it idles at only 22*C to 23*C, and at full load, is
only in the low- 30's*C.&nbsp; Well, I set up the RMA with NewEgg.com
to get a replacement, so I'm happy about that.&nbsp; I think I'll send
it back tomorrow.&nbsp; <br>

Jeremy will remember these guys from the Coal Chamber concert back in
2000.&nbsp; He and I were both at that same show and never knew it till
a few months ago when we got to talking about it.&nbsp; LOL&nbsp; I
think this group is broke up now.&nbsp; They only released two albums
that I know of, but still quite ass-kicking albums. Unfortunately,
their website (fulldeviljacket.com) is shut down now, otherwise I'd
send y'all there to check 'em out..&nbsp; *Tear-Tear*&nbsp; They were
such a good group too.&nbsp; I could've seen them making it pretty big
if they would've garnered more fan support.&nbsp; Unfortunately, they
came out when Mtv was playing ONLY Piss Daddy, Britney
Spear-my-ass,&nbsp; and Backdoor Boys.&nbsp; LOL&nbsp; <br>
<br>
I chose this song, because to me, it has a very soothing and lulling
melody to it.&nbsp; It somewhat reminds me something the Police would
write, if they were heavier.&nbsp; LOL&nbsp; I also chose it because of
a very addictive and haunting quality that the song has.&nbsp; Those
that have never heard of them before, I HIGHLY suggest you check their
stuff out.&nbsp; Some suggested songs:<br>
* ""Where Did You Go""<br>
* ""Stain""<br>
* ""Wanna Be A Martyr""<br>
* ""Now You Know""<br>
* ""Monster""
<br>
Take it easy y'all.&nbsp; 'Nite.<br>"

friday i got burnt washing my truck..sucked pretty bad. However..the buring too shall pass. so it'll tan. saves me a bit of money for prom haha. no tanning bed for me. but whatever...

friday night went to our Redbud festival thing to ride rides & crap. It was pretty fun. Me,Aly,Tara,Nick,Luke,ect..hung out. It was pretty fun.
Yesterday we had the actual festival, parade, rides, booths ect...it was fun 2. just real hott & the fact that i got burnt sucked quite a bit. UGH & i had to carry my snare in the parade..the harness killed me..but thats ok...drumline was fun & hott =)

after the parade,me,ciara,caleb,luke & caleb's cousin hung out, walked around for a bit, ect. it was cool i suppose. Saw Shaye...miss her a bit. it was pretty cool. 
Last night all of us were gonna go to the Rodeo, but after eating I didn't really feel up to it & i hadn't talked 2 Ciara..so we didn't go. haha...a freshman won Miss Buna. quite weird..but whatever.. woot woot...

i'm sitting here blankly staring at my clock saying 10:58 and I cant seem to think of anything but Steven. (I had accually forgotten about the brownies i made earlier.) haha i can accually say ""I love you MORE than a fat kid loves cake..brownies..whatever.""

anyways. this morning in band we crashed the drumline cadence several times (appears Corey's shockingly important..he wasn't there) School went on, thought about the same sad thing all day. After school, had drumline, marched with the drums 1/2 a mile, my back was KILLING me...(stupid nerve) We accually played it clean several times, with the exception of the mid silence in the middle of the cadence *cough*-stupid basses-*cough* afterwards, went 2 tennis practice, me & destiny almost hit a carney...pretty funny stuff. Vickie yelled her LUNGS out of her brain to get the carneys attention to turn their radio to 94.1 but they put it on Houston oldies instead (LOSER!)...
..if yall are wondering why we're talking to carnies its because the Redbud Festival (Buna's festival) is this weekend, and the carnies are set up right by our tennis courts so me & destiny accidently hit balls over the fence..its quite hilarious though. Justin hit one on the super slide..it was way freaking funny. We were laughing so hard i almost pissed my pants...it was good.

but yeah, so i came home, watched CSI(x3) and then thought more about the sad thing i had been thinking about all day. finally i wrote an e-mail explaining how i feel. ..but whatever..no detail. ]

but however..we got into a ""snowball"" fight with some little kids. like prolly 10 year olds or something..i dunno..it was fun.

then one of the dumb little kids tripped & it looked like i did it. but i didn't..so whatever. i helped her up.

but after the fight was over..we concluded that clearly we won. oh yea. 8)

jodi's booger came up there. it was fun. he saved my life. upon leaving...i almost slipped & fell in water..but he saved me with his arm....it was the closest thing to grab onto. 

ah..cant forget the train we made. christina started it..then it was jodi, then me, then sam....it was fun. 8)

then when we got back 2 her house, me her & jessi cuddled on dales bed. pretty hott..should've been there. 8) 
jodi's mom told us that jessi & dale couldn't cuddle. so we decided we would. 8) it was totally hott. 8) but yea..so

hmm well. now we're sitting here listening 2 FAll out boy & talking 2 the canadian.

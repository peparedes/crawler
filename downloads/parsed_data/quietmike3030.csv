"event","By Jim Gilchrist<br />Special to CNN<br />Adjust font size:<br />Decrease fontDecrease font<br />Enlarge fontEnlarge font<br /><br />Editor's note: Jim Gilchrist founded The Minuteman Project in 2004. He is a former newspaper reporter, a retired accountant and a Marine veteran.<br /><br />ORANGE COUNTY, California (CNN) -- On October 12, Ruben Navarrette Jr. penned a pompous commentary for CNN.com (""Minutemen have a right to be idiotic""). His litany of name-calling and bogus accusations against The Minuteman Project membership places him solidly in the category of propagandist journalists who ""spin"" their stories to suit their bias -- valid facts and objectivity be damned.<br /><br />Navarrette is a clever wordsmith. Under the penumbra of supporting free speech, he creates a wholly fictitious connection between The Minuteman Project and the Nazis who wanted to march in Skokie, Illinois, in the late 1970s, leading his uncritical readers to false assumptions and conclusions. Navarrette calls The Minuteman Project viewpoint ""offensive speech"" and says the project promotes inaccuracy, intolerance and idiocy.<br /><br />Navarrette insults Minuteman Project volunteers by calling them a posse who ""prowl the U.S.-Mexico border chasing Mexicans -- admittedly not an easy thing to do when you're carrying a lawn-chair and a cooler of beer."" He claims minutemen and women are ""hooligans,"" ""yahoos"" and ""wannabes who play cop.""<br /><br />In fact, Minuteman volunteers only observe and report; they do not chase or confront and they do not drink on duty. There has never been a violent incident initiated by volunteers. By contrast, in the past 18 months, nonviolent Minuteman volunteers nationwide have been victims of more than 50 acts of violence against their property and persons by deviants opposed to freedom of speech. Much of this violence is encouraged by propagandist journalists like Navarrette, whose words inflame readers and foster hostility.<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"">Navarrette implies racism, but never says exactly which of The Minuteman Project volunteers is racist. Could it be the African-American members? Or the Asians or Hispanics? Perhaps he refers to the Native American Indian members? Maybe Navarrette means the Jewish members of The Minuteman Project?<br /><br />Of course, there are European-Caucasian members. Ah-hah! In the twisted perception of the propagandist journalist, any organization with at least one white person must be, ipso facto, a racist organization.<br /><br />In fact, The Minuteman Project is a multiethnic, pro-legal immigration, law enforcement advocacy group. Minuteman volunteers are teachers, college professors, taxi drivers, truckers, construction laborers, lawyers, college students, CPAs, surgeons and physicians, retired police officers, veterans, homemakers, authors, PhDs, politicians, grandparents, and naturalized citizens -- Americans who simply want to help protect their country from the problems of illegal immigration.<br /><br />One would be hard pressed to find another national fraternity with a more diverse membership of race, color, creed, age, or vocation. Membership is about 25 percent non-whites and 55 percent women. The board of directors includes women and a black American with a master's degree from the University of Southern California.<br /><br />If Navarrette truly wants to expose obstructionist groups, he should focus on some of what I consider real threats to civility, like Columbia University's Chicano Caucus and the International Socialist Organization, the two extremist elements that conspired in an effort to stamp out freedom of speech at Columbia University during a speech The Minuteman Project was invited to give on October 4, 2006.<br /><br />The hope and belief of Navarrette and his fellow propagandist journalists, along with anti-American groups like those that disrupted my speech, is that readers are so simple-minded they cannot distinguish between truth and fiction. One can only hope that CNN.com readers are not so easily fooled.</div>"

And neither party gives a damn about the middle class.</p><p>Our country's middle class is not just collateral damage in what has become all-out class warfare. Political, business and academic elites are waging an outright war on working men and women and their families, and there is no chance the American middle class will survive this assault if the dominant forces unleashed over the past five years continue unchecked.</p><p>They've accomplished this through large campaign contributions, armies of lobbyists that have swamped Washington, and control of political and economic think tanks and media. Lobbyists, in fact, are the arms dealers in the war on the middle class, brokering money, influence and information between their clients our elected officials.</p><p>Yet in my entire career, I've literally never heard anyone in Congress argue that lobbyists are bad for America. In 1968 there were only 63 lobbyists in Washington. Today, there are more than 34,000, and lobbyists now outnumber our elected representatives and their staffs by a 2-to-1 margin.</p><p>According to the nonpartisan Center for Public Integrity, from 1998 through 2004, lobbyists spent nearly $12 billion to not only influence legislation, but in many cases to write the language of the laws and regulations. </p><p>Individual firms, corporations and national organizations spent a record $2.14 billion on lobbying members of Congress and 220 other federal agencies in 2004, according to PoliticalMoneyLine. That's nearly $6 million a day spent to influence our leaders. We really do have the best government money can buy.</p><p /><div class=""ljcut""><p>But as I discuss in my new book, ""War on the Middle Class,"" what if we all resolved that we would not permit either the Republicans or Democrats to waste their time and ours with wedge issues? Both parties love to excite their bases by focusing on wedge issues like gay marriage, the pledge of allegiance, school prayer, judicial appointments, gun control, stem cell research and welfare reform.</p><p>Each of these wedge issues is important in varying degrees to large numbers of us, but none of them rises to the level of urgency or the requirement of immediate change in public policy. </p><p>These issues are raised by both political parties to distract and divert public attention from the profound issues -- like educating our youth, economic inequality and the war against radical Islamic terrorists -- that affect our daily lives and the American way of life. Imagine the consternation in Washington if both parties had to contend with a national electorate whose political affiliation had dramatically changed within a matter of weeks or months.</p><p>In both Republican and Democratic administrations, Congress has passed and sustained billions of dollars in royalty payments and subsidies to big oil companies; pushed through a corporate-written, consumer-crippling bankruptcy law; embraced the death of the estate tax; approved every free trade deal brought to a vote; and supported illegal immigration for the sake of cheap labor.</p><p>The party strategists and savants are telling us that fewer Americans will turn out to the polls than ever before, disgusted by a disgraced former congressman. But we don't have to wait for the midterm elections to begin to engage in our new political life. </p><p>There's something all of us could do that would have an immediate impact and send a powerful message to both corporation-dominated political parties and to our elected officials in Washington. Our so-called representatives in both parties have been working against the interests of the middle class for so long that they take our votes for granted, or they take advantage of the fact that a sizable number of us don't vote at all.</p><p>So what if a majority of us decided once and for all to walk into our town and city halls all over the country and change our party affiliation from Republican or Democrat to independent? What if that sizable number of us who don't vote at all decided to register as independents? For the first time in decades, working middle-class Americans might just get the attention of our elected officials in Washington.</p><p>Our middle class has suffered in silence for far too long, and it cannot afford to suffer or be silent much longer. Hardworking Americans have not spoken out about their increasingly marginalized role in this society, and as a consequence they're all but lost their voice. </p><p>Without that strong, clear and vibrant voice, all the major decisions about America and our future will be made by the elites of government, big business and the dominant special interests. Those elites treasure your silence, as it enables them to claim America's future for their own.</p><p>I sincerely hope that we will find the resolve to face these challenges to our way of life, and we do so soon. George Bernard Shaw said, ""It is dangerous to be sincere unless you are also stupid."" </p><p>I'm stupid enough to be absolutely sincere in the hope that middle-class America will awake soon and take action.</p></div><p />"

As yall probably noticed I bee n[osting lots of political stuff. It one of my new hobbies, I like stay up to date on pilitics now. I dont wanna be the one those who debated by OPINION, I want FACTS. So I read different articles from different views. Anyways, I like the front page from Google because lots of the news comes from different countries,&nbsp; states, ect...Its comforting to see a less bias&nbsp; news article.&nbsp; Cause our media is too busy trying to make fun of people than&nbsp; actually reporting the news. I mean, SERIOUSLY, our life here has become so simple that we find the dumbest shit to complain about. But back to the topic at hand, I am actually surprised that foreign paper arn't bashing the USA as much as some of our media tries to make it sound. Im sure everyone has there issues w/ our Pres. I only like him 50%, but I am very angry with some other issues he has completely ignored.&nbsp; With that i leave you with this:

If an illegeal immigrant falls in the woods and makes a sound, who pays for their medical bills?

More troops and jets have been ordered to the region.<br /><br />More than 300 cruise missiles are available for use against Iraq, and there are air-launched cruise missiles aboard 14 B-52 bombers on the British island of Diego Garcia, sources said.<br /><br />Britain has 22 strike aircraft in the region.<br /> <br /><br />December 16, 1998<br />Web posted at: 8:51 p.m. EST (0151 GMT)<br /><br />WASHINGTON (CNN) -- From the Oval Office, President Clinton told the nation Wednesday evening why he ordered new military strikes against Iraq.<br /><br />The president said Iraq's refusal to cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors presented a threat to the entire world.<br /><br /><div class=""ljcut"">""Saddam (Hussein) must not be allowed to threaten his neighbors or the world with nuclear arms, poison gas or biological weapons,"" Clinton said.<br /><br />Operation Desert Fox, a strong, sustained series of attacks, will be carried out over several days by U.S. and British forces, Clinton said.<br /><br />""Earlier today I ordered America's armed forces to strike military and security targets in Iraq. They are joined by British forces,"" Clinton said.<br /><br />""Their mission is to attack Iraq's nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs and its military capacity to threaten its neighbors,"" said Clinton.<br /><br />Clinton also stated that, while other countries also had weapons of mass destruction, Hussein is in a different category because he has used such weapons against his own people and against his neighbors.<br /><br />'Without delay, diplomacy or warning'<br /><br />The Iraqi leader was given a final warning six weeks ago, Clinton said, when Baghdad promised to cooperate with U.N. inspectors at the last minute just as U.S. warplanes were headed its way.<br /><br />""Along with Prime Minister (Tony) Blair of Great Britain, I made it equally clear that if Saddam failed to cooperate fully we would be prepared to act without delay, diplomacy or warning,"" Clinton said.<br /><br />The president said the report handed in Tuesday by Richard Butler, head of the United Nations Special Commission in charge of finding and destroying Iraqi weapons, was stark and sobering.<br /><br />Iraq failed to cooperate with the inspectors and placed new restrictions on them, Clinton said. He said Iraqi officials also destroyed records and moved everything, even the furniture, out of suspected sites before inspectors were allowed in.<br /><br />""Instead of inspectors disarming Saddam, Saddam has disarmed the inspectors,"" Clinton said.<br /><br />""In halting our airstrikes in November, I gave Saddam a chance -- not a license.

"event","<p>http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/alqaeda-leaders-not-happy-with-their-man-in-iraq/2006/10/03/1159641300004.html<br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Six months before Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the head of al-Qaeda in Iraq, was killed by a US airstrike, he received a letter said to be sent by a top al-Qaeda official who said he was not happy with him.</p>
<p>It warned Zarqawi that he would be removed if he did not consult with the terror group's leadership on major issues.</p>
<p>Sent by an al-Qaeda leader named ""Atiyah"", who said he was in the north-west Pakistani region of Waziristan, the 11-page letter also praised Zarqawi, saying ""you have hurt America, the largest infidel Crusader forces in history"".</p>
<p>The letter provides a glimpse into the weakened leadership of al-Qaeda in Waziristan and shows the rift between the terror group and the leader of its Iraqi branch.</p>
<p>Two US government officials said the letter is believed to be authentic. They said Atiyah is considered to be Osama bin Laden's emissary to Iraq and served as a link between the al-Qaeda leader and Zarqawi.</p>
<p>It was not clear when Atiyah took over that role or precisely how close to bin Laden he is.</p>
<p>The Iraqi Government identified Atiyah as an Algerian and in the letter he tells Zarqawi how he fought with militants in Algeria in the 1990s.</p>
<p> </p>
<div class=""ljcut"">
<p>One of the US officials said the 37-year-old, whose full name is Atiyah Abd al-Rahman, was born in Libya.The official said he was a religious scholar with knowledge of the Koran and Islamic law, and a veteran of the anti-Soviet jihad in Afghanistan. He joined al-Qaeda in the early 1990s, when it was first formed.</p>
<p>Atiyah is believed to be an explosives expert, the official said.</p>
<p>First revealed by Iraq's National Security Adviser Mouwafak al-Rubaie on September 18, <em>The Washington Post</em> reported in Monday's editions that the letter was the first document to emerge from what the US military described as a ""treasure trove"" of information uncovered from Iraqi safe houses at the time of Zarqawi's death.</p>
<p>The letter is dated the 10th of the Muslim month of Zhul Qadah, which was around mid-December last year and about six months before the Jordanian-born Zarqawi was killed in a US airstrike north of Baghdad.</p>
<p>In a warning to Zarqawi that he could be removed, the letter said that ""anyone who commits tyranny and aggression upon the people and causes corruption within the land and drives people away from us and our faith and our jihad and from the religion and the message that we carry, then he must be taken to task"".</p>
<p>""We must direct him to what is right, just, and for the best. Otherwise, we would have to push him aside and keep him away from the sphere of influence and replace him and so forth,"" Atiyah wrote.</p>
<p>Atiyah tells Zarqawi that on major issues he should consult with ""your leadership, Sheik Osama [bin Laden] and the doctor [Ayman al-Zawahri] and their brothers ... as well as your Mujahideen brothers in Iraq"".</p>
<p>Among the issues that Atiyah cautioned Zarqawi against was the war he declared against Shiite Muslims and attacks the Iraqi branch had carried out in neighbouring countries - an apparent reference to last year's triple suicide attacks in hotels in the Jordanian capital of Amman that killed dozens.</p>
<p>Zarqawi was also asked in the letter to correspond with al-Qaeda in Waziristan through reliable messengers and was told not to attack Sunni clerics whether in Iraq or abroad - an apparent reference to the Sunni clerics who were assassinated after calling Iraqis to take part in last year's general elections.</p>
<p>""The war is long and our road is long. What is important is to keep the good reputation of yourself, the mujahideen and especially your group,"" Atiyah wrote.</p>

Aight enough of that....I got a raise baby!!!! 15 bucks and hour. This is my compensation for doing Purchasing and Fabrication work. I am proud of myself, it feels good to be responsible. I've kept my self in track the last 2 years and it feels great. MY schedule...Work, Gym, Guiatar, School...I gotta go to school on Saturdays now. It kinda sux, but its a fun class, all i do is sleep after it until its time for more drinkin later. The thing I'm most happy about is losing weight. Ive lost almost 10 pounds of fat.

""Above all we must realize that no arsenal, or no weapon in the arsenal of the world, is so formible as the will and moral courage of free men and women. It is a weapon of&nbsp;our advisaries they do not have. It is a weapon that we as American we do have.""

""But I want to make it clear to the American people that while we can defeate terrorist, it will be a long time before we defeat torrorism. America will remain a target because we are uniquely present in the world, because we act to advance peace and democracy, because we have a tougher stand against terrorism, and because we are the most open society on Earth.
-President William J. Clinton
August 6, 1996

""The war on terror is not over; yet it is not endless. We do not know the day of final victory, but we have seen the turning of the tide. No act of the torrorists will change our purpose, or weaken our resolve, or alter&nbsp;their fate. Their cause is lost. Free nations will press on to victory.""

 On September 11, 2001, four U.S. planes hijacked by terrorists crashed into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and a field in Pennsylvania killing nearly 3,000 people in a matter of hours. Behind the staggering number of deaths are the individuals, each of whom left behind family, friends and co-workers who feel the national tragedy on a personal level.  

Lets take a moment to remember what happened. 

Are people already forgetting 9/11? Maybe no one cares anymore...3000 people died in a few hours. Back in 2001 I was still at West Valley College. One of the last things I remember is walking past a ceremony for a girl who attended the school. Then after standing and listening for a few minutes, I realize it was a girl on one of the planes flown into the towers. Normally I dont take things personally...but to think someone I went to school w/ was on the plane. Wow...it literally could of been any one of us caught in the situation. The thing that hit me the most about 9/11, was watching footage before the collapse. There were people at the top of the building trying to excape the fire. The only wasy out was down...I'm watching people jump from the top of the building cause it was the only means of escape. How fucked up of a situation are you in when you are willing to jump from the top of a building.

I know this sounds all emotional...but damn! 
 Oh and again to the the people who think this was a inside job/ this didnt really happen...FUCK OFF! I guess all the people who placed bombs planted on the inside were pretty sneaky, getting around the thousands of employees and all.

"event","OK...I was bored and checking out some of the 911 conspiracy sites. Let me just say this...IF YOU THINK ANYTHING OTHER THAN PLANES ARE WHAT BROUGHT DOWN THE TRADE TOWERS, YOUR AN IDIOT!!!!! I dont mean that lightly, at all. Seriously some of the shit people are trying to say doesn't even make sense. My favorite one is ""planes didnt even crash into the towers."" Really? No planes? What about the fucking 100 people standing out there watching it happen. Oh and another favorite one is...""the tower where designed to take a plane impact. why would they fall?"" hmmm ya that it true. And they did for a period ot time. First let explain one of the first thing I learned in firefighting school: Steel is very strong and doesnt MELT until it reaches very high temperatures. BUT it begins to FAIL in strength at 1200 F. Also a fire in a home doubles in size every minute it burns and can easily reach temperatures around 1500 F. SO jet fuel burning at say ohhh prob 900 F is going to cause other object in the building to burn and quickly reach temperatures of 1500F. The trade tower was not a light building, had a frame made of steel which was weakened and collapsed on itself. Thats all im gona say for now im angry."

"event","Hmmm well. I gota pee...of course its right as i start typing. I havnt done this thing is so long I dont know what to say. So Im sure I posted in the past I work in the Plastic Shop now at my dads business. Its been about a year, which kinda scares me actually. Time is flying...Anywho Since Ive been working in the here I have learned LOTS. Getting older I seem to be taking work more seriously. When I was young I fucked around too much...which will get me started on a whole nother subject. So lets stay on track here...We are on work share weeks right now. If ya dont know what that is, its basically a 4 day work week where one of us has a different day off. So I get Wednesday off. Friday, Jerry is off, so that mean I get to be in charge of the shop since I have the next level of experience. There is only one other person, my friend Danny, but its still cool to be in charge. The whole work share week kinda sucks. 16 hours less of a pay check really hits you hard. Having the day off was kinda nice at first. Too be honest though I dont like it anymore...I feel like I should be doing something w/ my time. Like working...Sounds kinda freaky but ya, I would rather be at work. So Im gona ask around and see if anyone needs help in other departments....I will continue later...."

Issues

Note: more than half of immigration into the United States is illegal, thus more than half of the impact of immigration on our health care system is due to illegal immigration. 

There are over 300,000 estimated anchor babies born to illegal alien mothers each year in the U.S. - babies who automatically attain citizenship. Illegal alien mothers now add more to U.S. population each year than immigration from all sources in an average year before 1965. 

FAIR estimates ""there are currently between 287,000 and 363,000 children born to illegal aliens each year. In 1994, California paid for 74,987 deliveries to illegal alien mothers, at a total cost of $215.2 million (an average of $2,842 per delivery). Illegal alien mothers accounted for 36 percent of all Medi-Cal funded births in California that year."" 

In a recent year in Colorado, the state's emergency Medicaid program paid an estimated $30 million in hospital and physician delivery costs for about 6,000 illegal immigrant mothers - average of $5,000 per baby. Those 6,000 births to illegal aliens represent 40% of the births paid for by Medicaid in Colorado. Those 6,000 babies immediately became U.S. citizens and qualified for full Medicaid services, with a cost yet to be tabulated. 

The federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) mandates that U.S. hospitals with emergency-room services must treat anyone who requires care, including illegal aliens. Medical service for Americans in affected communities is being severely damaged as hospitals absorb more than $200 million in unreimbursed costs. Some emergency rooms have shut down because they cannot afford to stay open. Local tax-paying Americans are either denied medical care or have to wait in long lines for service as the illegals flood the facilities. In California, the losses are calculated to be about $79 million, with $74 million in Texas, $31 million in Arizona, and $6 million in New Mexico. 

These costs are staggering. The Cochise County, Arizona Health Department spends as much as 30 percent of its annual $9 million budget on illegal aliens. The Copper Queen Hospital in Bisbee, Arizona, has spent $200,000 in uncompensated services out of a net operating budget of $300,000. The University Medical Center in Tucson may lose as much as $10 million and the Good Samaritan Regional Medical Center, also in Tucson, has lost $1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. 

The Gwinnett, Georgia, Hospital System expects has established a $34 million reserve to cover its anticipated outlay for illegal aliens in 2003. Los Angeles Times columnist Ronald Brownstein wrote in his December 30, 2003 column that the 'Health-Care Storm Brewing in California Threatens to Swamp U.S... the impending Medicaid disaster is not a problem the states can handle alone; their budget shortfalls are too big.' 

""The General Accounting Office traveled to southern Arizona to study the impact of illegal immigrants on Arizona and other border state hospitals. In 2002, three hospitals located in Cochise County funded more than $1 million in uncompensated health care costs... The Florida Hospital Association surveyed 28 hospitals and found that health care for illegal aliens totaled at least $40 million in 2002."""

"event","Uday Saddam Hussein al-Tikriti <br />Uday [Odai, pronounced ""aw-DAY""] was born in 1964, the oldest of five children from Saddam's marriage to his first cousin Sajida. Uday, who was notoriously greedy, flashy and corrupt, had staked a claim to power through parliamentary politics. He was elected to the National Assembly in the spring of 2000 - although it took him some six to eight months to physically show up and take his seat in the rubber-stamp parliament. <br /><br />Uday seemed unlikely to succeed his father, although he controled the state media and a small security force. A 1996 assassination attempt left him temporarily paralyzed, and he was reported to remain in generally poor health. Uday alienated important figures in Saddam's inner circle. <br /><br />Uday was credited with having a part in the early 1996 killing of his two brothers-in-law, Hussein Kamel and Saddam Kamel, who were married to Uday's sisters Raghd and Rana. Hussein Kamel, a former head of Iraq's military industries and a key player in the country's non-conventional weapons program, had defected to Jordan in August 1995 with his brother, who had headed Saddam's personal guard. The two were lured back to Baghdad, and to their deaths, by promises of an amnesty. Uday is thought to have been responsible for the Kamels' defection in the first place, after threatening to have Hussein arrested. <br /><br />
<div class=""ljcut"">In December 1996, Uday was shot, gravely injured and some say partially paralyzed by unknown assailants who were thought to have been taking revenge for one or other of Uday's killings and maimings. The intelligence services were unable to find the perpetrators of the assassination attempt against Uday (with the exception of Ali Izzat, a former member of a military office whose sports car was found near the site of the assassination attempt in Baghdad's Mansur district and who was liquidated one week after the assassination attempt which took place in December 1996). <br /><br />In 1998, Uday killed Hanna Jajo, Saddam's most trusted food-taster and procurer of women. Jajo had acted as the go-between for Saddam and Samira, who became his second wife and the mother of now-teenage Ali. (Saddam remained married to Sajida, despite at least two other known marriages.) It was reported that Uday, said to be closer to his mother than to his father, arranged a party for Suzanne Mubarak, the wife of the Egyptian president, on the banks of the Tigris in downtown Baghdad. Across the river, on the Island of Pigs, Jajo was also entertaining. He and his rather rowdy bunch were shooting salvos in the air. Uday crossed the Tigris and asked Jajo to stop. Some time later Jajo fired again. Uday returned and clubbed Jajo to death. <br /><br />Uday was Iraq's media czar, and he owned the Babil daily paper, the weekly Rafidayn and the Al-Shabab TV station. Uday took control of vast sections of the media, which was not part of a wider strategy of Saddam himself, but a role that Uday carved out for himself. Who controls information in the country, wields great power. Within two years after the uprising (by 1993) Uday had taken over part of the work that used to be done by the Ministry of Culture and Information. Besides, he set up his own parallel system of media: a newspaper, a radio station, a TV station. There was also a high degree of interference on his part into the daily work of the Ministry of Culture and Information which has in itself led to friction and human rights violations. <br /><br />Uday also acted as an unofficial minister of youth overseeing student organizations and cultural activities, and reigned over Iraq's Olympic Committee. In May 2001, Saad Keis Naoman, an Iraqi soccer player who defected to Europe, reported that he and his teammates were beaten and humiliated at the order of Uday Saddam Hussein for poor performances. He was flogged until his back was bloody, forcing him to sleep on his stomach in the tiny cell in Al-Radwaniya prison in which he was jailed. His account supported allegations made by Sharar Haydar Mohamad Al-Hadithi, a former Iraqi international soccer player, who stated in August 1999 that he and his teammates were tortured on Uday Hussein's orders for not winning matches. In 2000, three soccer players who played for a team that lost an October game in the Asian Cup quarter finals, reportedly were whipped and detained for 3 days. In 1997, members of the national football team reportedly were beaten and tortured on Uday's orders because of poor play in a World Cup qualifying match. <br /><br />Following a raid conducted on July 22, 2003, by Task Force 20 on a residence in Mosul Iraq, and which resulted in a protracted firefight, CENTCOM confirmed that Uday Hussein died during the operation, along with his brother Qusay and two other people.</div>"

I wasn't able to make the time for it I guess. Stupid of me to ever let that happen...Which gets me into a whole 'nother thought. For now Ill stay on subject. Ive been readin up on Muscic Theory, not the easiest subject to fallow, but it intersting. Now I understand what music is all about, how its written and why its writen the way it is. The basic info is easy to fallow, the other STUFF, is not. To help matters I am retaking Guitar lessons w/ my old intsructor I had in High School. The hands on experience makes a huge difference...AND a positive note: I am getting good at guitar again. It feels good to have it back...Sounds cheesy, I know. But it gives me that little extra bit of...confidence I guess. Knowing Ive relearned a skill, added another little piece to me. Now again Im getting into the other thought...Why did I let myself lose it? For the longest time I wasn't making any time for myself. It was always about someone or something else. I definately learned my lessons in the past 2 years..."

1) I kind of have a headache.
2) Why don't some people just shut-up.
3) Why don't I just shut-up... haha...like anybody cares what I think.
4) (blank)
5) If an anoying G/F falls in the woods, does she make a sound?
6) Would the psycos who keep trying to make a consiracy out of 9-11 just give up already. 
7) No!! I can't stop talking like this, havn't you seen my movies?

Alright, w/ that out of the way. Lets get down to business. How was my day? My day? Un-freakin' believable. First we nailed this bastard who had the gall to hide his stuff in his daughter's doll--HER DOLL for God's sake! Where's the line anymore? Well, I got news for ya, it's not even on the radar screen! The days of decency and virtue are gone, honey, BAM, freakin' evaporated like a dingy stinkin' mudpuddle. One day you see your reflection in it and the next day it's a, it's a damn oil spot on your cracked driveway, staring back at you, mocking you, knowing the perverted truths that rot in the pit of your soul. That's how my freakin' day was!

Other than that...School is good, life is good...."

"event","Well, Hello!!! Fellow LJians...I been working the Plastic Shop Since August so I dont go online nearly as much now. The Fabricator life has been great...Its a much more masculine(SP?) job. My hands are all dry and callised(SP?) It feels good!!! As I had mentioned months and months back my return to Rock music has encuraged me to play more guitar. The results are in and I finally have some of my old skills back. Bout 4 months ago I bought a acustic guitar to jam on...I want to get both styles down. ""Damn, I swear I just did laundry, now Im doing it again..."" Anywho...I hacve been working out regularly. Pumpin the old iron is workin out well. Ive started to bulk up a little, gained some muscle and shed some fat. I am now drinking my protein shake...Hold please...........................................................................................................................................  OK I am back and ready to pump you UP!!! So the last few months have been a line up of lesson to learn. Not going to get into details but they have been great. I am thinking positive and using my new knowledge to my benefit. I think I have miss spelled enough words...so this concludes my journal."

"event","I dont really know what to write, but I want to write...So here I go. For some reason I was thinking about people who take their crap out on other people. Kinda funny Terra posted about it....Not that I have that problem anymore, but it really angers me how some people can be like that. If a persons life is bad enough that they need to take it out on someone, why can't they make an effort to better themselves. They put enough energy into messin w/ other people. Maybe it could be used to fix their own crap. 

Anyways...I worked w/ San Jose Fire yesterday. It was a cool experience, I got see a lot more pacients than in smaller cities like Milpitas and Santa Clara. My frist one was a homeless man who was hit by a car. The other two were medical pacients. The whole EMT, Firefighter career has really changed my life. I have a whole new perspective on life...I've seen so much w/ the 3 ride alongs. It makes me look at things differently. Plus I feel like I accomplished something. It's showing me how rewarding it can be to put your effort and hard work into a goal. The last semester has probably been the most stress I've dealt w/. But it is paying off...I can look back and smile about what I did and be proud of myself. 

The last year has been a big lesson for me. I learned a lot about myself...What I want to be, the person I am inside and a whole lot about relationships. I even gained some friends and lost a few. But it was all a good experience. I know now that I can't just give myself to someone w/ out knowing they desrve it. This is not only for relationships but friendships also. People need to earn each others trust, other wise they don't deserve it. As for finding myself, I know I havn't yet, but I am a lot closer than I was a year ago. I am more comfortable in my shoes than I have ever been before. I think the best thing I learned so far is I don't need someone else to make me happy. I am doing good on my own, until I find a girl who clicks well w/ me. No more Mr. Overly nice guy..."

Her pink and black is all I see.
She's a beauty that cant be touched.
The rose w/ a thorn,
a woman that doesn't love.
So dark on the outiside, 
the bright shines w/ in.
There is light through the tunnel.
But there is no end."

"event","OK...so on my way home from Beefys there is an accident on 237. It must have happened seconds before I arrived...all I saw was a SUV up side down. But by the time I see the SUV, I see a tire rocketing towards my car. With no time to stop The tire nails my front right side, damages my bumper and breaks my quarter panel. It also took out my tire in the process...So I hit the breaks and pull to the left. I walked across the freeway and too the crash site...Magically the two people inside managed to get out of the car. The guy was uninjured but the girl was in pain. I got to see the paramedics do there thing and place her on a strecher....all the while my parents are comming to pick me up. Unfortunately I had to get my car towed and it is currently sitting in a yard w/ my $3000 stereo system waiting to be stolen. Well I guesss I am getting a rental car...this really bites....I want to finish the guy off. Oh by the way he was drunk and it was a self inflicted accident....BUSTED!! But at leaste I got to see some EMT action!!! Life and its crazy twists....?"

"event","<center>Baby, the clock on the wall is lying
               It's not really that late 
  It's too cold outside to be walking around 
               the streets of this town
Anywhere if you think you have to be can wait
              Why don't you <b>stay with me</b> 
            Share all your secrets tonight 
 We can make believe the morning sun never will rise 
     Come and lay your head on this big brass bed 
 And we'll be alright as long as you stay with me</center>

Happy 3 month anniversary.. I love you so much hunni <3

<i>Saturday</i>
Worked with adrienne that was fun, ate brownies played scrabble and just talked the whole time, then her car broke down again so I went back and got her. We went out to the cingular store, then to stevos grad party then stopped at my house. then went to her house for 2 hours so she could pick out what she wanted to wear. After I dropped her off at Vals and went home to get ready, picked them both up and dropped them off at maxs then went home and luigi mikey n dain picked me up went to maxs for the night. 

<i>Sunday</i>
Woke up got ready went out to Benni Haunnas with my grandparents then went back over there and hung out with my cousin went swimming and stuff, then went over to chases to watch the game with some people, that was fun. I got home late though, cause I wanted to see the rest of the game since it was so close, and it was really dark so ryan said he would walk me out to my car and I had to wait for him, so we walk out of chases garage and I hear something and ryan goes ohh it's nothign.. and all a sudden theres 3 deer and they scared both of us, we finally get to my car and he goes ""if you hit one, call me so I can eat it "" . a typical ryan comment i love it.. Anyways so my curfew went from 12 to 9 for the week, cause I was 10 mins late. stupid. 

<i>Tomorrow</i> 
Working 10-3 up at mystic creek.. then chases is comming up to play golf with me.. tomorrows mine and Dennis 3 months, but hes in Kentucky :( I miss him soo much!!

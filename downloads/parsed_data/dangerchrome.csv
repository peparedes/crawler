And I think it's hilarious we poured the stuff all over my experiment and just froze the whole thing after we were finished. And that's just the end of it. For being the most frustrating three and a half hours of my life, the freezing-point depression experiment kicked ass.

     Not to mention that I got to use a cold plate and a magnetic stirrer. Sometimes the whole world is so wacky that I get the feeling that everything might just work out fine.

I am also very tired and think I have an ear infection.

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's Saturday night, and I'm stayin' in! Hung out with my pop all day, hung out with Jay, my niece, for a good chunk of the day, spent some QT with my stepma.. ..yeah, today's been swell. I was intending on getting a lot of my physchem assignment done, but it didn't, and I'm hardly upset because the time was spent well regardless.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;sent the following picture to my sister who is attending first-year classes in life sciences at the University of Waterloo:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's about all I have to say. That and I also live in a new house and I am sitting in a lawn chair at my computer. It's pretty student. I hate it."

"event","So I just came back from the hospital. Joe's looking better every day. He even managed a bit of chocolate, hehe. I miss him like hell, though, it's only been a month or so since we moved in together but I'm so used to sleeping next to him that sleeping <b>not</b> next to him is difficult. :( But nevermind. 

College sucked today. Nothing was interesting, everything was completely and utterly nondescript, a couple of chavs from - would you believe it? - year fucking 10 were shouting 'faggot' and 'gypsy queer' at me. I swore at them a bit and Melly from Drama yelled back at them to 'leave Kill the fuck alone and grow some hair on your bollocks, you nasty little bastards'. Which cheered me up no end. :) Melly's a real live wire (not to mention very scary). She's just one of those people you don't fucking mess with. If anyone else wore a 'Dykes on Bikes' jacket to college they'd probably get stoned to death, but if anyone tried anything on her they would probably end up deaded. Hehe. 

So that small part was a good point. But the year tens themselves - that pissed me off. Everyone else knows me around college and I get on with *almost* everyone with the exception of a few - namely chavs and some of the teaching staff, though it pains me to say it - but the year tens are shits. 

Fucking little bastards. If they give me any more shit I'll beat seven bells out of them. I've had much worse shit than this before from much older people than them and gotten through it, so nasty little kids aren't going to upset me. However, they ARE going to piss me off royally. Grrr. >:(

Takes me back, though. I remember a couple of years ago when I got the shit kicked out of me verbally on a daily basis (and that one time when I actually did physically get the shit kicked out of me). Things have moved on quite a bit since. That makes me glad. :)

I miss J. :("

"event","Hello everyone. Long time no type. Joe has been very ill. He has somehow managed to catch pneumonia and has spent the past week laid up in hospital. But never fear! He looks dreadful, but he's absolutely fine. The doctors say he is through the worst of it now and should be out in about another week or so, possibly less. *crosses fingers* I've been to see him every day since he got in. I'm just about to take the car (I don't have my licence yet, but ssssh) and go see him. It's a bit scary seeing someone you love in a hospital bed, let alone on a respirator. He's off that now fortunately, and talking - albeit somewhat feverishly, bless him; he's extremely pissed off about not being able to play his guitar. That just proves he's alright. ;)

I hate having to go to school and work while he's ill like this. I skipped school the first couple of days and the ever-wonderful Greg gave me leave from work for the first half of last week. I was sorely tempted to call my own sickie after that so I could go and be with Joe, but he told me off for thinking it and made me go back to school. (Yeah, I was forced to work by an invalid. Hey, I'm weak, I know it. ^__~)

Well. It's been quite a stressful week, to be honest. Poor Joe. :( I'm really glad he's okay, though. I was so worried about him. Just one question, however - 

HOW THE HELL DO YOU MANAGE TO CATCH PNEUMONIA IN AUGUST?!?! :O

Okay, that's it from me. Off to go see the lovely in a bit. I got him fresh flowers. :)"

"event","And I now have a looovely new job at <A HREF=http://www.void-clothing.co.uk/"">Void Clothing</A>. ^^ It's my favourite shop as well. Yay for staff discount. 

It is part-time, so starting this coming Monday I will be working after college on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays from about 4.30-7.30, and I will be working 12-6 on Saturdays. :) <i>Parfait</i>, no?

Anyway. Today has been enjoyable. Joe's lil sister came round (yay Joolsie!) with her friend Carlie, who I haven't met before but seemed like a sweetie plus she had nice hair so I gave her a hug anyway. (Hope I didn't scare my little sister-in-law's best friend too much, eh? ^__~) 
Anyway, that was fun, they had lunch with us on the 'picnic rug' (a.k.a an old blanket) and then, out of the blue, Reg showed up. (You're a fucking 'tard, man. :p) Then we all went out into town for a wee bit to do some shopping. Not that we needed to or could really afford to or anything. Hehe. But nev'mind, eh. It was a nice day - apart from when it was pissing it down. T__T 

Anyway. Reg left a couple of hours ago but the girls are staying for dinner. Everyone is in front of the TV now watching some film...ooooooo! SPINAL TAP!

Joe is asleep on THE NEW SOFA (yesterday exhausted him, I mean cooking an elaborate ['kay, easy but time-consuming] meal for eight people, damn, I can't even  cook for one) but I am as awake as a very awake thing. ^^

Anyway. What's been done today? ...not very much. Sofa got dropped off at about 11 but that's it. May or may not invite <lj user=""wankeriffic"">, Dames, Lily and co. around in the evening, because they haven't seen the place yet. But so far I've been doing very little. 

Except, yeah, the good stuff, and yeah, I did contribute to J's current state of physical fatigue a little, a little. ;)

Mostly for furniture and shizzle we are lal sorted (there was a problem yesterday, in that we don't actually have a table) but hell at least now we have a TV. :D It only has terrestrial, but we have channel four, which means we can still watch OMG Lost on Four. :) I love that show. 

Ah goddammit I am getting hungry. And all I can cook is toast. (It usually burns.) :) Ah well. I'll wake Joe up in a bit if he's still sleeping and we'll probably call for pizza or something, it's not fair to make him cook again.

I am thinking of getting a job....at the piercing place....:D I asked Sera the manageress (who has the most awesomely green and part-shaven hair evah omgyay) if they had any need for a part-time worker in the downstairs shop. And in the meantime I will see if she will let me sit in on some people getting pierced, and show me how to do it myself. :D So yeah, I might fill out an application. I feel bad because Joe's working at Rockaboom even though he's going to uni, even though I'm just going back to school ('tis my last year of sixth form, though) and I've not even got a job. But that will change.

Speaking of college, I don't want to go back. Ah well. Just one more year, four more major exams. Then that's it and I am in uni as well. I already applied for Notts, but I applied for Loughbourough as well just in case I don't make it. Eeep, what a thought. L.U. looks pretty cool as well, but I have checked out the Notts courses and they are AWESOME, I promise you. 

Oooh, speaking of A-Levels, the results come out *tomorrow*. Eeep, eh? O__O Wish me luck."

Woooooooo. Sorry, hyperactive. It's been a busy summer. We have to go back in two weeks. :( I can't believe it's my last year at school, then next year I'm going up to uni as well. I'm just doing my last year of sixth form, carrying on with Music, Drama, Psych and Art (yes, I'm a cliched panysboy drama nerd...AND I once played OMGKINGLEAR!! :O ) A level and then going on to do possibly Music, Art, Psychology and Literature degrees. WOO. (Yeah, I know it's almost two years until I go to uni but I already looked at the prospectus.) Joe is going to uni this year, he is le nervous. Aww. :)

Gack. So hyper. Today was spent drinking those ridiculously coloured drinks (Panda Pops, I think?) and we mixed them together to create amazing colours of amazement. We mixed pink (Red Jelly And Ice Cream) with blue (Blue Raspberryade) to make purple (Purple Jellycreamberryade) and also red (Cherry) with green (Lime) to make...uh...piss yellow, actually. Luvverly. But it tasted gooood. The E-numbers....the high sugar content....mmmmgyaaaaah....*sugargasms and falls into a diabetic coma*

Kabie was one of the kindest, loveliest people I have ever known. She has helped me through the worst times in my life. When I was struggling to accept my sexuality, Kabie was there to help me come to terms. When I couldn't find the courage to tell my parents I was gay, Kabie was there encouraging me to do it. When I decided to come out to my friends and family, Kabie was standing beside me with her hand on my shoulder as I did it. She got me through a time when I was severely depressed, and helped me find the will to live. She stopped me and yelled at me when I was going to slash my wrists, and afterwards she held me and cried with me and told me it was going to be okay. 

Kabie has done so much for me. She was my best friend, my confidante, my shoulder to cry on, and my sister-in-spirit. Without her I would not be here today. 

We will always love you, Kabie. Wherever you are now, wherever you're going, may you be happy forever. I'm not religious in any way, but if there is such a thing as an angel, I am certain that the invisible wings that buoyed you up in your life have become real. May they carry you forever higher and higher. You're free now."

Kabie was taken to hospital this morning after she collapsed and started fitting. They scanned her brain and she has a tumour. A <i>tumour</i>. It's been in there, in her, for about a month, they think. It's large and they can't operate on it. At the rate it's growing, they don't think she'll have long at all. Maybe a month, two months, but no more. Maybe even less. 

Please, whoever you are, please don't take her from us like this. She doesn't deserve this. No one deserves it, but if anyone deserves to live it's Kabie. She's such a kind and wonderful person, strong and bright and funny and warm. She's helped me through so much.

Fucking arsehole! Oh but Iloveyousomuch....*hugs*""

He's okay. Just tired and upset that he scared us, really. He says he wanted to come home and he didn't want to worry anyone, but he just felt like he couldn't face us. I think a lot of rage and hurt has been building up inside him for a long time now. Poor baby Mitchie. Argh, I'm so angry at him as well! It's so confusing, because I'm angry that he ran away, but I'm so, *so* fucking happy he's safe. Oh God, it's been such a fucked up couple of days. We've been staying at Joe's since Mitchie ran away.

I'm so glad they found him. Believe me, words can't express what we're all feeling at the moment. I've never been so scared in all my life. I had a dream yesterday that we found him all mangled and bloody and broken by the roadside...woke up screaming, Joe thought I was being murdered! He let me sleep in his bed with him, though, so that made me feel a bit better.

He went missing about half six, when our Boxing Day dinner with my aunt Katy and my grandmother culminated in a screaming match. My grandmother started on Katy because she married an asshole, apparently, but who gives a shit. It ended with a fight, and now Mitch is gone.

We've been looking for him non-stop. We have phoned the police. Now we (Mum, Darie and me) are round Joe's. He's looking after me.

Okay, Ihave to go. We're going looking again.

Please pray he's not hurt. Please."

"event","Today has been another fucking interesting day. In a better way this time.


I have.....*drumroll*....a boyfriend. <333 I love you Joe. 





In other news (now that the biggest/best/most important is over), I've had a stupid week. Remember Daddy? Well, he left this morning (there is a god), but not before having a huge shouting match with my mother (who got back from grandma's yesterday night), and then another one with me. I don't know why he was yelling at Mother. I think she dropped a plate or something and broke it. He got mad about that, even though it's not his house and they're not his plates. So Mother was crying and being yelled at, Mitchie had left for school early because he couldn't take it, Darie was in her room (crying - who can blame her?), and I was having to sit there and watch my 'parents' fight. Just like fucking old times. 

But I've definitely changed since then. It's been a long time - what is it, three, four years since he left? - and I'm not prepared to just sit there and watch him reduce my mother to a whimpering puddle again. So I got really pissed off, stood up and yelled at him to shut up. I said it wasn't his house, that she wasn't his wife anymore, and that he had no right to behave like that towards her. He told me to 'shut up, fag' and carried on fighting with/yelling at my mother. And that was the last straw. If I wasn't so short I would probably have hit him, but as it was I just told him what I thought of him: that he was a disgusting, drunken, ignorant, homophobic arsehole who couldn't even treat his own sons and daughter with any form of tolerance or compassion, and no wonder he can't hold down a job or a woman. We started yelling at each other, and eventually he left - after chucking a few plates on the floor and threatening to 'gouge me a new one unless I shut my faggot mouth'. 

And that was that.

Once Mother had calmed down a bit, she asked me what had been going on while she was in London, and I told her all about what my father had been saying and doing. I asked her, please please please not to inflict him on us ever again, and she agreed. So, I don't think I'll be seeing my da again. He's gone back up to Glasgow to stay with his current girlfriend and her fifteen illegitimate children, or however many she's got. So, despite all the rowing and the yelling and the horrible miserable week we spent with him, it was worth it, because he's out of all our lives now for good. Mother promised. And despite how much of a mess she is sometimes, I know my mum wouldn't ever break a promise to us. She actually loves us, unlike Da.


So, yeah. w00t. and all that. You may think it weird that I'm in such a good mood now, after having such a nasty stressful start to the day, but it's actually been a very, very good day. What with Joe and everything. ::blush:: And no more Da. *YES!*

See you later. I'm off to watch a film with Darie and Mitchie. Mother's out for the night and I'm in charge, so basically that means a good time. I rented a few films for us to watch, and I'm going to call for pizza in about ten minutes. Ciaou!"

We didn't....you know....but we did....you know. Well, of course you don't, but suffice to say that it was weird and probably a large mistake. Laaaaarge. And I wasn't even drunk or anything, we'd just had a really good time so I guess it seemed like the right thing to do. And now I'm pretty positive it wasn't, because when I left Joe was kind of weird with me. Uncomfortable, like. And I really hope that what I - well, we, because it wasn't just my fault - did hasn't totally ruined everything. 

Maybe I shouldn't be telling my online journal this. but what the fuck, Joe, I can't say it to your face. You know the poem I wrote about the dream I had? Well, that was for you. And I wasn't just messing around when we flirted before. Maybe you were, but I wasn't. I'd like to say something else, but I'm not in that much of a hurry to get my heart ripped out. I'll skip the three little words part, because I think that bit's a little obvious. You know what I mean, I'm sure you do.


So, er...yeah. ::cough::

"event","Guess what. my dad's back in town. Mum's gone to London to be with my grandma, cause she's ill. And dad's come over to look after Mitch and Darie. Unfortunately, I'm lumped with him too.

Luckily, he's downstairs right now. If he wasn't, I wouldn't be writing this. I'd be barricaded in my room, playing some very loud music. Either that or I'd have been caught, rabbit-in-the-headlights, standing in front of him eyes-to-shoes while he spouted off at me. He loves my sister and my brother, but he hates me because I'm a fag. :( He actually calls me that. He never calls me Kill. Not even Killian. It's either 'faggot' or 'queerboy'. He's my fucking father, for godsakes. You'd think he'd have a bit of tolerance for his own fucking son. But no, NO, never, because if he was the slightest bit nice to me, that would somehow tarnish his masculinity, and maybe that would make him a FAG as well. So he has to keep calling me names and I have to keep putting up with it. All I can say is thank fucking gods he doesn't live with us anymore. I'd kill myself if he did. I'm not joking.

Well, at least it's only for a week. And lovely precious fucking LIFE-saving Joe said I could stay at his place if Dad gets too unbearable.  <333 thankyou so, so much. i love you. i love that you're so lovely to me. thankyou for putting up with me all the time. you're so special.



okay. i'm crying. shitshitshit. i have to get tissues. then i'm going to bed. i can't face staying awake at the moment, i have to sleep.

Anyway, last night I went out, got a little bit drunk (not not that much) and generally had a pretty awesome and above-all *coherent* time. Yay. Also, I was treated to something very lovely when I went to bed. And no, it's not what you think. It wasn't *that* lovely. ;) Though it did come a close second.

<lj-cut text=""Dream Diary""> 


This is a really weird dream I had. It was a really beautiful, vivid dream. I didn't want to wake up from it. But it really touched me, and I decided to write about it. I'm sorry if it's bollocks. The title is bllshit, I know, and I also know the rhyming and lining is erratic at best, but it's supposed to be slightly abstract because that's what the dream was like, and it was also a very spur of the moment-type thing. 

<b>Dream Diary</b>

Like a statue, he stands before me

Paralysed, transfixed, trembling with

What might be lust, but could just be cold or care.

Lips swollen, bruised and bleeding

The whisper of his breathing, hot in the winter air

Tickling my face.

His own face

- Pale as a ghost's, but for the bitten-red slash of lips 

And the wide, clear eyes that seem to have no defined colour

(Blue? Grey? Green?

They change from ocean to sky to ice, it seems

Their pupils always dilated, pure ink)

And the desire (?) flushed cheeks, snow stained with pink -

- Hovers centimetres from mine

So close, it seems I could count every lustrous, dark eyelash.

There is one on his cheek. 

I reach up with an unshy hand

Brush it off, blow it off my finger

Make a wish.

This being a dream,

My impossible wish, imploration to the skies, 

Comes true.

He closes his unfathomable eyes,

And lets his mouth brush mine, our tongues dancing

The uncomplicated dance; breath-hot, sugar-sweet and slow....

There is the mutual knowledge that this must end

Though soon, not eventually; But I know

That I will carry this away from sleep

And I will not forget

And I will not weep.

The kiss is broken

It fades away

Like a daydream on a summer's day,

Rudely interrupted by the trials of life.

He vanishes, too, 

And if he were a magic of my own imagination,

A simple dream,

A fabrication -

I would forget his face.

But I know I never will, because he is a beautiful product 

Of this concious world -

Not merely an untouchable creature of fae,

Here in the moonlight but gone by the day...

</lj-cut>

Comments would be much, much MUCH appreciated. I might find a nice poetry community and xpost it there, too. 

My toes are cold! Maybe because my socks have holes in. *frown*

Just got phoned by Joe...we're having a cookout of sorts tonight in his FECKING HUGE back garden. Kabie, Tim, Damien and a load of other people are coming. Joe's dad has this awesomely huge tent thingy (bigger than the one we took to Devvo), and we're going to light a fire and eat sausages and drink lots of alcohol and sleep over int he tent and just generally have an awesome time. It *will* be awesome, but, Joe, seriousy, couldn't you have picked a better time to organise an *outdoor camping extravaganza* than early December?! I mean, we might get attacked by rabid polar bears or sommit. Well, we won't, because this is after all English Suburbia, but it *is* going to be freezing. I will have to wear more than one layer. *gripe* Hmm. What to wear? Baggy jeans to keep the old legs from falling off, I think, also about three of my really gay vest-thingies and me old Molko shirt over the top. And possibly one of my younger bro's hoodies. It is NOT O.K. that he is three whole years younger than me and yet almost as tall. You hear me, Mitchie?! IT'S NOT O.K.! *coughcough*wanker*cough*

Anyway. I'm going to go and get my stuff together, and get ready to freeze my balls off out there. Just hope it doesn't rain! :p

I have been very very busy with coursework and shit lately so I haven't posted here in ages. 

My new form tutor's name is Ms Haveley. I HATE HER. >:O

I was wearing eyeliner today, like I usually do. I have never got any comments from teachers about it before, because our school has no dress code or whatever, but today at registration, she looked at me and she went,
""Killian, why are you wearing makeup when you are a boy? It makes you look...strange.""
And the way she lifted her eyebrows...I know what she meant by strange. I *know* what she meant. She keeps making these nasty little digs at me. She does it to everyone, but it seems to be mainly focused on me and this other guy called Ross, for some reason.
GRRRR.

Anyways. Hello, Joe, I know I haven't seen you much lately but I promise you that tomorrow I will HUNT YOOOOU DOOOOWN.

I'm starting to get back into the school routine now. Always takes me a long while. But ah well.

This means I will start updating again.

Plus, I am writing something. I shall post it. Sooooon."

"event","<P>Here is a meme that I found somewhere...</P>
<P><lj-cut text=""Sexual Personality (down boys!)""> </P>
<P>What's your sound? Vocal or quiet?: Vocal. Very very vocal. Rawr.</P>
<P>Top or bottom?: Oh, both. I'm very versatile. ;)</P>
<P>Femme or masculine?: I'm mostly feminine. You could call me a flamer.</P>
<P>Submissive or dominant?: Dom! Ohgodyes! *spanks*</P>
<P>Do you have a fetish? What is it?: Leather. *_* drooool....</P>
<P>Protector or protected?: Protected. :) Despite the fact I *love* being the boss in bed, I like to play up to the femmy little guy in public. </P>
<P>What's your most sensitive sexual area? : I love my neck being bitten and touched. Also my nipples.</P>
<P>Any naughty piercings?: No, unless you count a tongue piercing as naughty. I do!</P>
<P>What's your favourite part of a guy's body?: His ass. :D ...I like big butts and I cannot lie...</P>
<P>Fast and intense or slow and loving?: Depends what mood I'm in, but being as how I'm just a teenage boy, I tend to prefer it fast and quite rough.</P>
<P>Do you enjoy being maltreated, abused and/or hurt?: Fuck no!</P>
<P>Do you participate in or would you like to participate in S&amp;M games?: I've never tried S&amp;M and it doesn't really sound that appealing to me. I don't like pain or causing pain so that would probably be a huge turn-off.</P>
<P>Ever had a threesome/moresome?: No, but I came quite close once when I was very, very drunk. I don't think it's a good idea but in the right circumstances maybe it would be fun!</P>
<P>Name your biggest turn-ons: Pretty face, nice tight arse and flirtation. I like the feeling when you keep looking at each other while talking to someone else and you catch each other's eyes. Also lollipops...the sight of a hot guy sucking on a lollipop just does something to me. *_* Gaaah.</P>
<P>Turn-offs?: Hairy backs, body odour, flabbiness (I know, I'm awful), cheesy feet....the list goes on and on.</P>
<P>How many sexual partners have you had?: 2.</P>
<P>How many of them were serious or long-term boyfriends?: Both.</P>
<P>Would you ever consider a one-night-stand?: I doubt it. I'd rather get to know someone before I shag them, thankyou.</P>
<P>Lastly, were you turned on by this quiz?: Erm, no...? Should I have been?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Okay. So, erm, yah. I can't be arsed to describe the party because <lj user=""your_sex_pixie"" /> will already have done it. Suffice to say that it was a lot of fun, and that I am now Joe's bitch. Ehehe.</P>
<P>We played Truth or Dare at Kabie's. Poor Kabie had to pretend to have sex with me. She had to sit on top of me and everything. I will never forgive Damien; that dare was his idea. *smitey-smites* &gt;:O</P>
<P>Plus, I spanked Joey, and he had to run through the house NEKKID. *_* Mmmmmmnnnngyah. </P>
<P>....Joe, will you marry me? :p</P>"

"event","Wow. I'm feeling kind of hyper. And also, can't wait for party tonight. It's going to be one of those big, loud ones where the music and dancing's the main focus. Dancing brings out my inner homo - I love it! :D It'll only be the cool people invited, as non-cool people won't appreciate the music, the atmosphere or the company.
It's at this great club called *bitter that I've only been to once before, and Josh Hampton has booked it for the whole night. So it's his choice of music and shit tonight. I trust him though - I've known Josh for ages. He's sort of like the casual friend that you've known since junior school and you get on well with, except you've never gotten a chance to hang out much before. 
And I just bought THE OUTFIT. I think I look pretty hot in it, heh. Leastways I hope so! It's a tight purple tank and black leather pants. They're the tightest thing I've ever worn. I'll have to wear them without underwear! o.O Which I've actually never done before, but what the fuck. I'm going for Molkoesque style, with eyeliner and polish and lipstick and such. I've been gagging for an excuse to wear makeup other than just my usual little bit of eyeliner for a long time. Makeup is fun!
OMG I am remembering how short I am. WTF I swear I was bigger than that last time I checked.... :\ RRRR, so annoying. And it doesn't help that *CERTAIN PEOPLE* keep calling me 'maniac sex-crazed nympho dwarf', I name no names, cough cough JOE! ^_~"

God I'm so fucking horny. And I'm starting to sound like some annoying blonde slut with a name like 'Cindy' or 'Annabella' acting in a cheap softcore heterosexual (ew!) porn film. Ewiness.

I seriously need to find a boyfriend. Apart from the slight problem of sexual unfulfilledness (is this a word? it should be) I really hate being single at the moment. I feel lonely, especially when around couples. No offence to any of my friends who are currently involved with someone, but when you're single it gets VERY irritating having to watch other people kiss and touch each other in front of you.

THEREFORE! Am going to a party tomorrow. Kabie's going and Reginald's going. Not sure about Joe yet (*grin*) but as he now has an LJ I can ask him. Yay!

Oooooooooh, guess what? I have to babysit tomorrow for my diddy cousins Andrew and Tommy. They're five and seven and they're absolute little darlings. Haha, I was much amused last time, because Andrew said that his mother, my aunt Dotty, called me 'the loveliest fairy-boy I've ever met'. AND SHE WAS IN THE ROOM! XD I couldn't stop laughing, it was so fricking hilarious I nearly pissed myself. She was kind of embarrassed but I told her it was okay and that I found it funny. 

HAHAHA, I GOT CALLED A FAIRY BOY!!!! That phrase never fails to amuse me. 

Talked to The Mother From Hell. She apologised. I hugged. We discussed. She made promises....basically she said she promised she'd try to properly come to terms with my sexuality as it's a part of who I am, and that she'd never say anything like that to me ever again. So, we'll see how that goes. 

AND OH MY GOD! Saw the hottest boy today when I went shopping in Somerfields. (Yeah, yeah, I know I disappointed my dear old granny. But if I didn't drag my little hungover self out to the shop then our family would have nothing to eat but milk. And I'm pretty sure you *can* eat it, because it's all chunkified and ewsome.)
He looked about nineteen, tall but not too tall, slender, with beautiful blue eyes and dark, slightly wavy hair down to just underneath his chin. He was wearing the tightest shirt I have ever seen (we're talking about EXTREME nipple display here) and he was so unbelievably cute. I nearly passed out. Thank God I didn't *look* hungover when I went out (I checked. Repeatedly.) because we were waiting in the same queue and it was uber-long. Apparently, all but one other check-out had broken. Can you believe that?
Anyways, we were standing next to each other in this queue and he said hi to me AND OMFG I think I saw him check out my ass. O_O *drool*
He was really nice. I didn't catch his name but I've seen him around. Hopefully I'll meet him again. Properly.

So, apart from my little shopping trip, I've been at home ALLLLLLL day. My mother only came in once at lunchtime, and Mitchie and Darie were both at mate's houses again, so I had the whole house to myself. I was walking around in the buff. It feels so nice to be naked and on your own."

How much did I drink last night?

I feel horribly sober now. And, quite possibly, deceased. x_X Gnaargh.

And, oh fuck, I'm supposed to be taking my grandma shopping at four. I forgot all about it. Oh, fucking fuck. Why was it such a good fucking idea last night to get pissed out of my brain? I think I drank enough beer to stun a small horse. Fucking fuck!

"event","Sometimes I feel like I can't do anything about these people. I feel like it's just not worth trying to get out from the fucking fascist regime that the fucking government has set up. I feel like me and people like me will be oppressed and abused our whole lives by ignorant assholes of this calibre, and we just have to put up with it. I'm sick and tired of being discriminated against because of who and what and how I am, and I'm sick and tired of hearing about other queers and lesbians that are discriminated against too. 

Yesterday was the last. Fucking. Straw. 

I went into town yesterday with Tim (Reginald :D) and Martina. We ran into a group of disgusting individuals from our school. One of them threw his lit cigarette at me and called me a 'flaming faggot'. I was about to leap forward and attempt to rip his face off with my nails, but Martie and Tim held me back. The rest of his friends came over and started yelling abuse, i.e 'sick pervo' and 'twisted homo fudgepacker', and shouted that I raped children and that I was a pedophile. I was literally shaking, I was so angry and I couldn't speak. Tim was yelling things back at them, but they just started saying that he was my 'secret fag boyfriend' and all this shit, even though Tim is hetero and they know it. And then one of them came right up, the biggest one, a really tough shitehead called Daniel Robson, and he was just really quietly saying all these horrible homophobic things.
""God hates you,"" he said. ""You're going to burn in hell. You're sick and funny in the head and you should be put in a mental institution along with all of the other bulldykes and fag whores.""
It was horrible but we managed to get away from them before they started using physical violence. We got a lot of stares from passers by but even more of them just kept their heads down like it wasn't happening. They could clearly hear all the horrible abuse the assholes were throwing at me and they could see that Robson was right in my face but they just ignored it all. Fucking cowards.

I said to Tim after we'd left, ""I'm really sorry but can you please take me home now?"" and he said sure, because by that time I was crying and an absolute wreck. I was really embarrassed but they were both lovely about it, especially Martie, who gave me a special hug and told me I was beautiful, which made me cry even more. I *never* cry, never ever ever, unless I'm really really upset. I think I've only cried three times in the past three years - once when Grandad died, and then the other two times were when I was going through my most depressed time just before I came out. Those were the worst I've ever felt in my life. I was a real mess - I used to cut myself up and I tried to kill myself several times, because I thought that what I was feeling was sick and wrong and I didn't deserve to live. Since then I've accepted my identity and learnt to enjoy living as an openly queer teen, but yesterday just brought all those bad feelings back, and I never want to go back to the dark place they sent me to again, because next time I might not be able to come back.

And the worst thing about yesterday was what my darling mother said to me. I poured out my heart to her - stupidly - and told her everything that had happened, and she said, ""Well sweetie, you know it would be so much easier if you just went back to being normal again. Have you tried not being....you know...gay?""
I couldn't believe it. I said, ""What, so you think I'm not normal? You think I'm some kind of a freak? You're as bad as they are. No, actually you're worse, because you're my mother and you're supposed to love me no matter what."" I didn't give her a chance to say anything else, just went upstairs and went to bed.

This morning was really fucking awkward. I got up really early, about seven o' clock (which believe it or not is really early for me), hoping to get dressed, get a quick breakfast then go to someone's house so I wouldn't have to face any of my family, but my sister Davina, who's twelve and smart enough to figure out *everything*, was up and around. She was in the kitchen reading when I came in, and she looked up and said hi. She told me that after I went to bed last night Mum was crying. I said I didn't give a shit, because frankly she deserves to be as upset as she made me feel last night. Darie said, ""Don't talk like that, Kill, you love her really"", and I said, ""of course I do, but what if she doesn't love me?""
She's so lovely, my little sis. She's the best sister ever. ""She loves you so much, Killian. You know that. She just has trouble sometimes accepting stuff,"" Darie said. ""It's just the way she is.""
I know she's right, but I just really really hate what Mum said to me last night. I asked Darie what she thought about my sexuality, because since I came out we haven't really talked about it. I've said it before, but Darie is the best. She said, ""I think it's up to everyone to make their own choices about who they love, and it's nobody else's business unless you choose to make it their business. I don't care if you're gay or straight or whatever because you're still my big brother.""
I gave her a big hug and told her I wished Mum could be more like her. Great timing Killian - just then my mother walks in, looking like she'd been crying the whole night. I said a really cold good morning to her, which I still feel bad about, said bye to Darie, and took off. I went to Tim's house and stayed there the whole day. Martie was there, and they were both really nice, and we went to the park and met up with Kabie and some friends of hers, Damien, Lily, and Joe. I don't know Damien or Lily, though they seem nice, but Joe's a good friend of mine, and omfg he is the cutest thing I have ever seen to boot. *groooowwwl* So being with Tim and Joe the others took my mind of my mother for a while. When I got back at about fourish, Mum was out and Davina and Mitchie (my brother who's fourteen) had both gone out to friend's houses. And I've been locked in my room ever since. 

Yuck. What a shit weekend it's been. Mope, mope, grumble. I promise to be more cheerful in my next entry. :)"

"event","<P>Hi. This is Kill. I'm a seventeen year old slashing fanboy dramaqueen from some remote corner of England. So I'll just put all my info-type crap up here, cause it's so much easier than typing it up in full.</P>
<P>Real Name: Killian, and PLEASE DON'T EVER CALL ME THAT EVER IF YOU VALUE YOUR LIFE &gt;:O</P>
<P>Nicknames: Kill (friends and aquaintances), Yo Bastard! (my brother), oi you midget faggot pouf wanker (enemies and general arseholes), and Mr Cheese (generally only by strange friend Tim, alias 'Reginald', but feel free to call me that too, if you really, really want. You weirdo.)</P>
<P>'Ships: Remus/Sirius *gnnngdrooooool*, Draco/Harry, James/Sirius. Erm. That's it. Oh, apart from Hermione/Ginny. Just because. XD XD XD I wuv Ginny and would want to marry her if I was that way inclined XD XD *fanboys*</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>So. That's actually all I can think of. *yawn* I'm so knackered. Today I went shopping (squee!) with my friend Kabe. Kabie is a dude. Seriously, she is one of the spiffiest people I know. </P>
<P>We went to our cafe place that we like and we ran into with Jeff Bradley, an old friend and ex-boyfriend that I haven't seen for about a million years. So, yeah, I was really excited to see him again because he really is lofferly. </P>
<P>Me: Oooo, Kabie, lookie over there, look!</P>
<P>K: Is that...?</P>
<P>Me: I think so....can't be sure...OH! OH! It is! </P>
<P>He kind of looks up from his lunch and sees us, then does this sort of double-take thing. It was so funny, I was pissing myself laughing at the look on his face. He came over and hugged us both, and we were all pathetically excited. He's about 5,000,000 ft tall, and I'm not exactly the tallest person ever, so I had to crane my neck right back just to make eye-contact.</P>
<P>We had a good laugh and went around together for a while, then he went home. Now we have each other's numbers, though, so we won't get out of touch again. It was nice to see him again, and talking to him reminded me why we broke up. I just suddenly realised that I didn't actually fancy him at all, I just liked him as a friend. We talked, and he felt the same way, so we ended it on really friendly terms, and ooooo God I've just missed him so much. My big friendly giant. *pets*</P>
<P>Kabie found this really really nice tee-shirt for me and forced me to buy it. It's like a sleeveless black tank with two dragons on it, one red and gold and the other silver and blue, in kind of a yin yang design-type thing.&nbsp;I love it so much. </P>
<P>Yeah. And I'm now the most tired person in the world ever, so I'm going to bed. G'night.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>"

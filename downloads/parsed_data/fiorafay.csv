You are<br>interested in things that others fear,<br>sometimes using it against them. So much fun.<br>You think you're pretty dark, but that ain't<br>true. Better watch your back, real dark people<br>may find it fun to teach you a thing or two<br>about REAL darkness...

You came from Hell. The devil's dark force still reside's in your veins. You always look for fun, and have a way of winning people over. You have a strong taste in music, and have a very artistic side. Though your attitude can take over your personality, you keep up with your life without worrying about the small things in life. Violence sometimes is your thought, though your heart disagree's. Take time to think over your choices and rmember, it is never to late to change. Your bubbly personality produces envy among frineds but it never takes over you. Control your wild side, and your fire will turn to water. 

I figured i would get some fucked up answer like that...sigh... mabey the devil likes me and i can live ther for the rest of my life...."

i like this one more...

You are night, you are dark and mysterious, you<br>have more than likly been through some kind of<br>truma, depression. you have a creative mind,<br>and more than likly find peace enjoyment in<br>drawing, painting, writing. You are closed and<br>hidden away from people, and hide you emotions<br>behind a wall which you use on people. Try to<br>become more open, spread your creativity, you<br>have no idea of how many people there are out<br>there like you, exposing your art and yourself<br>can make other people come out, so many people<br>would look up to your for your courage and your<br>spirit, your not evil or bad, just<br>missunderstood, so get out there and show them<br>just what you are made of, don't worry about<br>what other people think, it's what you think<br>that really matters. Please rate this quiz!!!

"event","lets see, my friend (stef) is going out with this guy (Chris). C is originally from Guelf. He now resides in Hickville, with his GF and moi. both S and C are good peoples, but im mean really... so C is S's 1rst BF. so S dosn't know the ropes yet. and she now JUST realizes how many guys like her. (she is very pretty) anywho, C moved here 4 school, and some other bad shit like getting shot and gangs and shit. and S only began 2 go out with C so he wouldn't move back 2 Guelf and ruin his life. but she don't want 2 go out with C, and C has this thing in his fucked up mind that i like him (phhhh yeah right), but so does S. so she dont belive me. and so the wonderfull [BREAK-UP] is on her mind. but if she breaks up with him, he moves back 2 Guelf. SO NOW SHE HAS A [PLAN]. i have to go bowling with them, hit on C, and become his Bitch, so he stays in Hickville. can you figure that out? good luck... All i can say Stef, YOU.......OWE.......ME!!!!!!!"

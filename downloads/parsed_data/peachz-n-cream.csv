"event","This was an awesome weekend! I went camping with my bestest friends crystal and beckie and crystals mommy and daddy up at hickory run. The weather was awesome but due to some smoker guy we couldnt have fires because he started a forrest fire. People were still allowed to smoke though. so not fair...but we still had fun we went all the way accross the boulder field...and back...i climbed down inside this huge hole in the middle of the field...we played bull pit and cowpies..we made a lil twig fire in a tiny habachi grill since we wernt allowed to have a big one ..it was so cool ...then on sunday we decided to go hiking through the rhodadendron and i found the coolest water fall. so all and all a wonderful weekend. Unfortunately i some how ended up with pink eye ..now in both eyes ...i couldnt even open my right eye yesterday ...but i got to miss school with a doctors note which is always the best because they cant give you any shit."

Maybe its just because i havent gotten a chance to snow board yet this year which makes me very sad because the more it snows the more i think about how i could be snowboarding. but besides the snow today wasnt too bad. ncc had sumo wrestling which was fun to watch. It would have been cool to try but i didnt want to wrestle any guys. Beckie and i watched and cheered against jason he won to many times. Eventually some girls did it too but their fights seemed very uneventful. It definitly made my hr and a half lunch time go by pretty quickly. Then i just had to make it through history where i just sat there and silently cursed the snow more. (it doesnt help that i sit next to the window).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffff00>In other news I GOT ACCEPTED TO KU last week sometime i was very happy about that but i do not have garuenteed housing so i may actually end up commuting which i am not looking foward too. But if i do get housing it is going to be with stephy or i am going to trick my roomie into switching. I also have a job now i think...at the Hotel Bethlehem...i passed the drug test so i guess im just waiting for training. I am finally done being sick even though john is now sick. (if i get sick again he is going down!!!) (love ya baby). I am getting really excited about going to Myrtle Beach in May!!!! its only like a lil over 2 months! i am excited about getting out of school and the semester is almost at its halfway point! So far this has been the best semester! I am going to miss hanging with Beckie and&nbsp; Adam next yr but i cant wait to be back with my stephy!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffff00>&nbsp;I am missing crystal (shes in boston with her sissy on spring break). Now i have no one to talk to on the phone for hours. lol. i talked to her online yesterday shes having a good time. Then my sister talked to her. Micheles a lil fruitcake her new thing now is asking everyone what they are wearing (crystal was wearing nothing lol) she is slowly getting more perverted but then again she hangs around me. Her new favorite movie is Kill Bill which she keeps stealling from me ...my parents will so kill me for that one...her favorite character Go Go ...yeah i think john was right about i shouldnt have shown her that one ...i dont think she gets half of it but the blood fascinates her. ::shrugs:: well i think thats about it for now i dont quite know how i got on that topic but oh well...</FONT></P>"

"event","<P><FONT color=#33ffff>While im waiting for my Johnny to unpack his car and come get me ...i figured i would update since no seems to be online or they are away. I just got home from a Job Interview. It went very well i like the job it seems challenging but not to hard. Its one of those jobs that will always keep you moving. I like that. It pays 6.35 an hour plus tips ..which i guess will even out to around 8 or so dollars. The tips will be good this place is pretty expensive and i get a raise after 3 months so we shall see. I have another job interview tommorow so we will see how that compares and what that will bring.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33ffff>Been kinda stressed out lately ..too much to do not enough time ...figure adding a job probably wont help but i am broke and have bills which is bad news. I think i just need better time management. I did not go to school today because i hate the snow...i want it to die. Classes didnt start til 11 and i only had one after that so i basically said screw it. I can ace the test without being there anyway. I got an A on my first physics test i was so happy i thought i blew that one.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33ffff>I hung out with crystal, sam, blb, and jamie this past weekend. I had alot of fun. I think crystal was about to kill blb when we played lehigh valley in a box. But the pizza and singing rocked. oh yeah and i was talkin to crystal and i found out i have an enemy but its kinda funny..</FONT></P>"

You're a non-traditionalist, not limited by gender roles or expectations.
Your sexuality is more fluid than that - and you defy labels or categories.
It's hard to pin you down, and that's what's fascinating about you.
You have the psychology of both a male and a female, and you can relate to anyone.</font></td></tr></table>

"event","<P><FONT color=#66ff99>The past week or so have been fun. Crystal, Sam and I&nbsp; finally picked our vacation resort for myrtle beach this year. It is going to be a blast. I wont go into details because we hope to surprise Beckie since she was the only one not there. Most of the places down there you have to be 21 or 25 to reserve rooms which sucks because I dont think one more year makes much a difference. wouldnt it be worse for 21, hello drinking they can actually get it legally.Stupid Hotels.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffff00>Last weekend i went up to Chiller with John. It was pretty cool. He said it wasnt half as full as in April or October but it was full enough for me. I met a few of his friends they were quite entertaining. I think i heard ""its the principle of the fact"" like a million times. I got chased down by some lady she gave me a free tee shirt for a movie that hasnt even come out yet which is cool. Then we ate at this awesome Japanesse Steak house. It was so much food and so good...im not use to oriental food though so i was a little sick later. It was a fun weekend.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33ffff>Yesterday i hung out with crystal pretty much all day it was awesome she is the BEST! Unfortunatly she didnt find the school book she needed at Barnes and Nobles&nbsp; or Borders...but we still had a good time ...we went back to her house and she called around and finally found it in Montgomery...i would have drove out there with her then but it was kinda getting late and i was gonna go over to johns at some point. Her apartment is kinda freaking me out ...shes been telling me storys her tvs keep turning on or flipping chanels and ending on the static chanel ...im like oh no white noise...now im afraid to see that movie ...oh well...last night when i was there her light just turned out but we soon discovered the bulb had burned out .....or did it</FONT></P>"

<P><FONT color=#ffff99>so Saturday i got up early laid around in my pjs and watched tv even though i didnt get home til 3 i was up at 10 ...it was a lazy day and i loved it ...then i went and hung out with johnny boy for a bit watched some FBI files and had some wonderful dreams ..haha ...oh yeah and we watched poisonous women too ...how women murder with poisons that are harder to detect then the obvious ways to murder ...by watching that you know women are smarter then men&nbsp; or maybe they just cant do it brutally like stabbing or strangulation ...but then again these women like murdered their husbands and children ...i mean how can you sit there and watch your children or you husband suffering as the poison eats them from the inside... pretty sick stuff ...mt english teach told us once that its always the people who think to deep into everything, over analyzing,&nbsp;that end either killing themselves or going psycho ...at least i dont have to worry about that ..im hungry now so im gonna end waiting for johnny to call me back hopefully soon he was having dinner.</FONT></P>"

<P><FONT color=#66ff99>so whats new with me i miss ku but i had an awesome day yesterday so i decided to post before i forget about it...well i started out going to school ...which normally sucks ...i took a shitty spot because once again i was late...but i have emily to cheer me up in spanish and i found out she plays guitar quite well which is really cool. English class is the most boring class ...me and beckie tried to get in the same one but we screwed up times so she has it right after me...but so far english 2 is the easiest english class ever ...ncc is so easy...my child psych teacher rocks so i always have a great time in that class ..so i end classes at 1 then go hang out with bec in the student activites center and watch tv for an hr then go home ...why? ...i dunno. but yesterday we watched home deliveries and it was so funny ..they kept repeated like the same 4 clips for a half an hr ...then this 13 yr girl came on and she was hyperventalating over puppies ...she was so afraid of dogs...you just had to see it.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffff00>so after this i go to physical therapy for 2 hrs for my knees and back ...and they decided it was my last week for now however i still have to get evaluated on wed.and then see my doctor again ...so i get home from that and find out my stephy hoe called me.. but it was funny bc i didnt look to see who called me i just listened to my message and i thought it was some girl named Beth ...i was like who is Beth ... i dont know anyone named Beth ...then by looking at my missed calls i realized it was stephy...so i talked to her for a lil while and that put me in an awesome mood ...i miss her sooooo much but i always have so much fun talking to her / hanging around her ...i so want to go back to ku </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#cc33cc>but thats not the end of my great day ...then i went to johnny's and we had an awesome night ...it was so much fun ...hehe ...so then i came home round 10/ 11 and crystal text messaged me and since i hadnt heard from her in days i was happy to talk to her....so she says everyones going to homecoming on friday ...which to me is kinda lame ...i mean i miss marching band and high school so much but the only one i know at saucon any more is Marguerite (she is awesome!) ...its just not the same ...i have to baby sit before that so i might not make it but the lady should be home by 7 so maybe and its just down the street ...reminscing about old times is cool but you dont have to go to homecoming to do it ...i dunno though ...::shrugs:: we shall see what we shall see...</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#33ff33>today was a pretty cool day so far too ...i went to school ...did the math test thing ..ran to the activities center in hope of getting a tv ...was out of luck so went to burger king for lunch ..instead of just eating potato chips ...then i came back and beckie was there so tthen i bored her with tales of ku ...and then adam came back from his smartasses meeting and all 3 of us talked about bad experiences with haunted rides ...like the haunted pretzel ..lol ...then we went to class then i saw beckie again after class ..and we talked more...it was awesome ...i miss highschool where everyone use to just hang around after classes and talk and junk.</FONT></P>

"event","<P>Well walking to my 8 am this morning was a blast and a half ...you ku you could have a 2hr delay or something ...now the question to ponder this morning is which is worse ...walking on a sheet of ice or walking through the puddle next to it? ..now if you walk through the puddle the bottom of your pants will be wet but if you walk on the ice you could slip and knowing my luck end up sitting in the puddle ...well i chose the ice if im gonna get wet might as well go all out and do it the risky exciting way. Now walking back from class was a different story by that time all the ice had melt and the side walks were completely flooded with at least an inch of water...now tell me whats worse then being wet and cold?</P>
<P>Also this morning at 6:47 my bug walter took his last breath of air. so now its just me, myself and i in this room...so its back to talking amongst ourselves. ::sighs and sniffles::&nbsp; </P>
<P>well now im bored and im almost half temped to go out and stomp barefoot in the slush ...hahaha...maybe ill just take a nap instead ...hmm choices choices</P>"

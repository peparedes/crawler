"event","Well, quite a bit has happened since I last wrote.  I graduated.  That is just about all I can remember right now.  So I guess not that much has happened.  Whatever.  It has been a lovely week or so since I graduated.  I attended after grad for about 2 hours. What a waste of money.  But it wasn't my money, so what do I care?  That's right folks, I don't care.  

I just found out that the love of my life is going to Greece for a semester abroad.  I don't think you know how much this sucks, my dear diary.  I guess I can't be too mad, I was planning on going away to college anyway.  But that doesn't matter, I have the right to be jealous, as I am the girlfriend.  He is going to go away and fall in love and I am going to cry.  That's how these things always work out, right?  That's how it is in the movies, at least.  I don't know enough about real life to determine whether or not that will happen.  I hope not.  All I know is that I hate the fact that I can't have him to myself.  I am so selfish.  If I could lock him up in a cage when I'm gone and let him out only when I visit I would.  Of course, I <i>did</i> see that chastity belt up for auction on e-bay...

I've decided that I am going to miss my dog more than anything.  He is starting to get old, and with the shit that my parents feed him from the table, chances are he is going to die of a heart attack at a relatively young age.  That means it's going to happen soon.  And it will probably happen when I'm away at college.  If I get an apartment my second year, I'm snatching him and he is going to live with me.  

I'm going to miss my boy the most.  And Alissa, of course.  And all of 21.  Damn, this is the first time I've really thought about what I'm going to miss.  It is going to suck because whenever I am on break, Amy is going to be in Florida.  What horrible timing.  Why did her parent's have to move?  They aren't old enough for Florida yet.  Florida is for geriatrics, not middle-aged folks.  Having grandchildren should be a prerequisite to living in Florida.  But there is the vacation I'm taking in July to see her.  Plus, I get free food.  And we all know how much I like to eat.  If you don't know, let me tell you: A LOT.  I love food more than kittens.  This would explain my love handles and gelatinous thighs, as the jerk so fondly describes them.  And I say 'jerk' with as much affection as he says 'fatty' and 'porkchop' and 'slut'.  

I finally had 'the talk' with my folks.  Man oh man, good times.  Do you know how uncomfortable it is to have your own father tell you that he hopes your first sexual experience was a good one?  Well my friends, it is awful.  I was hoping that they would just forget about it.  I mean, my mom is starting to have a hard time remembering things, and my great-grandmother had alzheimers, meaning that my mom and her siblings would be next in line to inherit the disease.  I wouldn't wish that on anyone, but I wouldn't mind if she all of a sudden had a memory lapse that erased all knowledge of the situation.  Thank the Lord it is over.  And I'm really glad I can be honest with them now.  I hated being sneaky because my mom isn't stupid, and she saw right through all that bullshit.  I just pretended that I didn't know what she was talking about and stood by whatever bogus story I had concoted, even when she could prove I was lying.  I have found that the more honest I am with them the more they trust me.  What a concept.  Funny.  They told me that a long time ago.  I suppose I am one that has to learn the hard way.

It is now 3:26 and the song I am listening to isn't the one I have listed.  Now Playing : Lil Jon & The Eastside Boyz - Get Low.  What a great song.  I do, however, stand by my position on Radiohead.  So shove it.

There is no feeling like having no idea what is going with someone you love more than life.  You don't know how to get in touch, you don't know where they are staying, you don't know anything.  You want to help but there is nothing you can do but reassure them that everything is going to be okay.  I have never felt so needed and yet so helpless.  It is an absolutely horrible feeling.

"event","I am stuck in Missouri right now and have been for a full 24 hours.  And it sucks.  I'm staying with the people who are generally party animals and the part where I get hammered was what I was looking forward to since I can't be at prom.  And I have yet to participate in any of that, mainly because we had the rehearsal dinner tonight and the wedding is tomorrow morning.  I sat between my mother and a catholic priest for the rehearsal dinner.  Do I really need to elaborate?

I would be out partying right now.  I am very bitter about this, let me tell you.  

There are many things and people that I could bitch about right now because I'm sort of in a bitching mood, but for the sake of someone I care about, I won't.  

I like the way this keyboard feels and I like the way the keys sound when I type, which is why I'm still typing.  I'm not saying anything important (surprise surprise) or even remotely interesting (another surprise).  I'm just typing to hear myself type.  Kind of like how my first period teacher talks to hear himself talk.  And he never makes any sense and ends up just making himself look like an ass.  Like when he was pointing to a map of europe and was trying to remember the name for the balkan peninsula and I told him ""it's the balkan peninsula"" and he was like ""no, I don't think so"" and I was like ""actually, yeah it is"" and he thought about it and was like ""oh, this is the balkan peninsula"" and he pointed to the map and I was like ""yeah, I said that five times"" and he was like ""no you didn't"".  That's kind of what this is like.  But not really.  Because at least I'm acknowledging the fact that I'm just writing bullshit.  I hate him.  Him and his pumpkin-carved teeth and beady eyes.  

Bah, I hate weddings and I hate kids and I hate Missouri and I hate family with their dumb questions about school and all the stupid smalltalk about the weather and all of the constant eating and talking and laughing.

"event","Luckily, the way I feel right now is not a reflection of the events of this past week.  And it always happens that way.  The absolute glee I have experienced in this past week has been matched in magnitude by the 'I wish I could crawl in a hole and die' feeling I am getting from my churning stomach and throbbing head on the opposite side of the spectrum.  Call it God's sick sense of humor if you will.

I would have been in Europe for spring break.  And man was I pissed when I found out we couldn't go.  Now, I am glad I didn't get to go.  It was just a bunch of dumb band kids anyway.  Although I would have roomed with Emily.  And damn.  That would have been awesome.  That girl has no clue.  What was I saying?  Oh yeah, I'm glad I didn't go.  Why?  I'm not really sure at the moment.  I'm sure it will come to me.  Okay, I got it.

I haven't done anything very productive this week.  Aside from checking off an item from my 'Things I Must Do Before I Die' list, I have been pretty counter-productive lately.  But there are more important things to worry about.  For instance, where is Harry Potter 2? 

On a more somber note, an hour ago my best friend's dad went into surgery.  I'm glad he got to enjoy my angel food cake beforehand.

And finally (not finally as in I have been waiting for this to happen but finally as in I'm wrapping it up), the soft top on my brother's jeep was slashed last night.  And his doors were unlocked.  Ha ha, that's what you get for having  that dumb soft top.  Didn't I tell you that would happen?  (Okay, so maybe it was a little bit of both.)

"event","Well, the start of spring break has been an overall success.  Friday, I was just really really tired, so I decided to take a nap before I went out.  I just had a lot of hallucinations and some paralysis, so that wasn't cool.  I decided to wake up and take a shower because the whole sleeping thing wasn't working.  On a whim I decided to drive out to blockbuster, but what I wanted wasn't there, so I decided to visit Alissa.  So I did.  We hung out for a bit and got some coffee.  Came home relatively early because I had to work on Saturday.

Got to work late on Saturday.  Oops.  Met Courtney at my house at 3:15 and the first order of business was coffee and smokes.  Headed out to the g-spot and met Amy at her apartment.  Her side of the room is way cooler than Liegh's.  We went out to Mr. Smiths.  On our way there, we ran into Stephen Marshall.  How neat.  He disappeared and we got something to eat.  And it was good.  We window shopped a bit and wanted to get our palms read, but they were closed.  The bastards.  We saw the restaurant that Amy wants to go to for prom, and it is the coolest place ever.  Very exciting.  Head back to Amy's and grab some party favors, then we head to the metro to meet beautiful beautiful Taylor.  Amy and Taylor went to see ""Rivers and Tides"" and Courtney and I made our way to my brothers house.  We watched hockey for god knows how long, and I made arrangements with John to come out to both his 4th of July and graduation parties.  It will be swell. 

Alissa called me while I was on 66 with Courtney and told me that it was doubtful that we were going to Florida due to some extenuating circumstances.  That sucked.  But then today, just about an hour ago, she called me at work to tell me that her mom said it was okay if me and her drive there ourselves.  !!.  That would be so awesome.  The 15 hour drive would be oh so worth it.  Yipee!  

Was going to hang out with Frank, Ryan and Chels before Frank goes to Florida with Mark, but I have to work until 3.  The backup plan was meeting at mike's after work, but I was just informed that he has other priorities.  Oh well.  Maybe later tonight after my rendezvous with <i>my</i> Donnie Darko.  Who knows?

Either way, I'm looking forward to this road trip with Alissa, and I'm looking forward to tonight, and I'm looking forward to the rest of spring break, and I'm looking forward to graduation.  How exciting!  

Okay, there is powdered sugar just waiting to be eaten by someone, and that someone is me.  Have a lovely spring break everyone!"

"event","I had the best weekend ever.  I went to Towson University with Alissa, Amy and Courtney to see Queens of the Stone age and Zwan on Saturday.  When we finally got to Towson, we drove around for an hour and a half trying to find the damned place whilst looking for a hotel.  At one point I was stopped in the right lane behind a few cars at a light.  People are passing on the left, whatever, I figured I'd get my turn to go any second.  But wait, what's this?  There is no one in the car in front of us.  We were just talking and talking and no one noticed for at least 5 minutes.  Wow.  Not like I was in  a parking spot or anything because that car and about 20 others in front of it were illegally parked, but either way, we were just sitting there like a bunch of jerks.  It was oh so funny.

Anyway, we asked at least 5 people directions (including someone who was actually going to the concert) and they all got us lost.  When we finally found the damned place after turning into 3 other parking lots for what looked like the same building, it was too late to book a hotel.  Meh, we decided to get it after, no big deal. 

We saw the concert and it was better than sex.  I was up front the whole time and couldn't breathe, but I could see Billy Corgan's upper body most of the time.  There was a really tall guy with a fro in front of me, a drunk asshole who kept humping me so I punched him behind me, and a guy with bad breath on my right.  Ick.  But it didn't deter me from totally rocking out.  

Either way, we lost Amy and decided to go to the tour buses to wait for her (we figured that's where she'd be, seeing as she told us that she was going to meet Billy for the third time whether we liked it or not).  We couldn't find her, but we waited to see him anyway.  In the meantime, I had already bummed a quarter pack of smokes to fellow concert goers who were out catching pnemonia in the rain waiting for the band.  But is was all worth it because I got to shake his hand.  But Alissa.  Let me tell you that girl will do anything on a whim (Indiana being the prime example).  She decided to run past the security tape and evade all the security guards and give him a hug.  So she did.  She didn't say a word for 10 minutes afterward, she just made weird animal noises.  It was fantastic.  We finally found Amy on our way back to the car.  She didn't get to see him for some reason, which was a bummer.  On the other hand, she had already met him twice and he kissed her on the cheek.  Whatever.  Moving on.

We go to the 24 hour diner that we found on our way coming in, and we were initiated into the 21 club.  Stayed there for a bit, read some dirty dirty text messages courtesy of Amy and Amy's Zach, and got some info on hotels.  

Unfortunately, the bit of info we forgot to ask about was directions.  Oops.  So we decide to get back on 695 and head home.  Courtney saw the exit for lodging that the waitress had mentioned in the bathroom, so we took it.  No dice.  Apparently there was something going on in Towson that weekend and all the rooms were booked.  So we get back on the highway and it isn't until Baltimore that we see a sign for lodging, so we take it.  We saw a bunch of greyhound busses and canoes parked outside the Best Western or whatever it was, so we were going to be really pissed at the crew team that monopolized the whole hotel.  Ha ha, we were at a greyhound station.  God we are idiots.  So this is the hotel.  Thank heavens.  It was a little more than we were planning on paying, but I wasn't going to drive anymore and chances are nothing else was going to be cheaper.  Plus, the shady crack whore motel that was going to be perfect for our excursion because it was across the street from the diner and it was like the Psycho motel wouldn't take anyone under 21.  Bastards.  When you own a motel like that, you shouldn't be picky.  

So we get our room and proceed with the plans we had made for the rest of the evening.  I was paranoid that we were going to set off the smoke alarm or wake up the people in the neighboring rooms.  What kind of hotel doesn't have windows that open... in a <i>smoking</i> room?  Whatever.  I grew a pair and dealt with it.  After about what seemed like a half hour, I couldn't follow a conversation for 2 seconds and ate a lot of peeps and resees and listened to a lot of rufus and then I passed out at 4:30.  2+2=4.

Wake up to a phone call from my mom telling me that I need to be on my way because it is snowing.  What the fuck??  It is almost April and it's <i>snowing</i>?  Whatever.  So I shower.  And nothing has ever felt so good.  We get on our way.  Go to mikes for lunch, take Alissa and Courtney to McKay's, take Amy to the metro.  What an awesome trip.

I went to church on Sunday and passed out at 7:00 when I got home.  Didn't wake up till Monday morning.  Go to school, park next to Ryan, he tells me we are going to denny's.  There, Stephen lights Frank's hair on fire.  Which, I love you Frank but no offense, was really funny.  He didn't think so.  We (me, Chels, Ryan, Joey, and Frank) decide to go to dc to visit the museums.  So we did.  We went to the Air and Space museum and the Gallery of Art museum.  It was great fun.  I bought a fiber optics keychain type thingy that is already broken.  Suck.  But we got some good pictures."

I am so terribly tired.  Last night was an adderall night and I watched <i>The Kids in the Hall</i> as planned and it was lovely.  I shouldn't make a habit of this whole staying up all night thing because it gives me too much time to fret about things.  I worry incessantly about things that in 3 months won't have any relevance whatsoever.  I got my cap and gown and invitations and such.  It was very strange.  I am so ready to get out of here that my skin itches.  I am so pissed and sad that I feel physically ill.  I swear, masturbating isn't even fun anymore because I get all depressed and nostalgic and it is too similar to that scene in Mulholland Drive for my taste.  I keep telling myself 'this is the last time, I swear' and I know I'm only kidding myself.  The last time we made eye contact was at verona's when she was on his lap and was all lovey dovey and I wanted to throw up.  We looked right at each other for a full 5 seconds.  He hasn't looked at me since.  I fell for all the bullshit about being missed and me having a special place.  If that was the case, then how is it that he can't give me the time of day?  Huh?  And if he will always care about me, then why does he treat me like he does, knowing full well that he is gutting me, taking out my insides and stomping on them everytime he looks past me when he holds hands with her and all that fake shit that they do.  That's what it is.  Fake.  What we had was real.  How could you do that to someone you care about without feeling horribly guilty?  I mean, we hadn't been broken up a day and you had moved on.  And with someone so nice and sweet, I could never compare, to add insult to injury.  I fucking hate you for the way you make me feel, and I fucking hate you for making me cry, and I fucking hate you for treating me like Mark does.  I always thought that you were more mature than that, but apparently I was mistaken.  I thought I was more mature than this, but this is my fucking diary and I am so mad right now that if I don't vent on the computer, I'll vent to someone here at the office and I'll end up screaming because I FUCKING FEEL LIKE SCREAMING.  I can't believe I love you so much that I waited around like a little puppy for you.  The funny thing is, I still love you.  And it really sucks because I really want to hate you two right now but I can't because she never did anything to me and I can't get over you.  But I do hate the way I feel.  I hate being brushed off like nothing happened when you know damn well something did.  I need something.  Like a hug or something.  Bah, fuck.

Ahem.  I'm tempted to erase all of this because I'll probably regret it later, but what's the point?  I might as well say what I'm feeling.  So fuck it.  Hate me if you want.  You already act like you do, so what difference does it make?  Meh, you probably won't even read this.  You don't give me a second thought anymore.  Someone tell me why I shouldn't be upset.  I need a drink or three."

Tonight was supposed to be an adderall night since I have my musical investigation to do that was due on Friday, not to mention the 2 compositions.  But I'll mention them anyway.  At least I know what I'm doing for the compositions.  I have the piece in my head and it is in 2 movements.  2 movements = 2 pieces.  Hoorah, problem solved.  Now as for the musical investigation, I still have shit.  Thus the 'tonight was supposed to be an adderall night'.  Alas, I have already become fatigued and adderall isn't even an option now.  I'm just gonna hit the sack.  What a stupid trite phrase.

Yesterday was my first day back at work in 2 weeks.  My next paycheck is going to suck.  But it's not going to suck as much as my concert is tomorrow night.  Or the concert on Sunday, for that matter.  There are still some parts of the Tchaikowski that I haven't looked at before.  I should probably get to that.

I need to stop abusing my drugs.  Last night I stayed up and watched <i>The Kids In The Hall</i> until 4 and then I decided to do my homework.  I also watched <i>Boys Will Be Girls</i> on VH1.  It was about this group of drag queens.  It was great.  What quality programming.  Then I started on my English homework, which I should have been doing the whole time.  I went to print it out and we had no paper.  Oh well, not like there was any ink either.  I had to drive out to Alissa's to use her printer, and then <i>her</i> computer decides it wants to fuck with me.  I forgot I had to write a sonnet, so I did that.  I didn't get done until about 10, and by then my class was already over with.  I had band next.  Like I'm going to go to school just for band.  It didn't really matter because I left my flute at home.  I did go to school to drop off my assignments.  But I forgot we had a sub today.  So I did all that for nothing.  Waited around until the end of 3rd block to see if I was needed.  I wasn't, so I went home and slept.  And here I am now.  And if I have to answer one more goddamned question about the mass times for Ash Wednesday I'm going to cry.  I'm past angry.  Like last night, when fucking microsoft word auto-formatted my documents when I didn't want it to and didn't auto-format them when I did want it to, I just broke down and started crying.  All I wanted was for all the text to line up a certain way without the tabs giving me shit and the text changing font, and <i>NO</i> I DON'T WANT A NUBERED LIST YOU CUNT DID I <i>SAY</i> I WANTED A NUMBERED LIST?!  ::sob:: Today is not my day.

"event","I had the best time ever.  The Lion King was awesome, even though I kept falling asleep.  I picked the perfect time to take a nap, don't you think?  Oh well, I was told that the part I missed wasn't the highlight anyway.  

I convinced my mom to let me take road trips up there whenever I have the money.  I doubt I'll be able to see something on broadway again for awhile simply because of lack of funds, but I will be able to do the things I wanted to do but couldn't becasue of time constraints and the fact that my mom was there.  I was made for New York.  

That was the highlight.  The lowlight?  Well, there were more than one actually:  

A)The 2 assholes sitting directly in front of me on the bus trip would <i>not stop talking.</i>  And it was 4:00 in the morning.  They are lucky I didn't have a gun or a blunt object within reaching distance.

B)On the way back, they decided to play movies when I wanted to sleep.  They were really loud.  One of them was <i>Sister Act</i>.  Need I say more?

C)My best friend decided it would be a grand idea to go somewhere that I can't disclose because I don't know if she reads this and she didn't want me telling anybody.  Her going was cool, and I probably would have gone if I didn't already have this trip planned.  But.  She got in a car accident on the way home.  She's okay, just a little shaken up, but she is in the hospital right now and ended up having to call her parents because I think she totaled the car.  I haven't talked to her yet, her boyfriend just called me and told me all this, so I don't know exactly what happened or what she told her parents, but I know that they aren't happy.  That blows any chance of us taking the road trip together.  Boo.

D)I had a really bad dream.  Really bad.

But still, none of the above can bring me down.  Not even thinking about Friday night is bringing me down.  Well, maybe a little.  But hey, I knew it had to happen sometime.

Yesterday was totally out of character (except for the me wanting to choke kids and their parents part).  I don't even know why I was angry.  Everything just happened all at once and I reacted like a child.  I usually try to maintain some level of self-control but yesterday I blew it.  I promised myself that that won't happen again anytime soon.  My mom said it was all the medications that I'm on, but I think that that is the easy way out and a really lame excuse for the way I was acting yesterday.  But today is a new day, and we have no school, so that makes it 100 times better.  I love life today.  

Sometimes I like being up early and seeing the sun rise (I'm a tard, I know.  Reading that makes me want to barf.).  I especially like hearing the coffee brewing, like you see in the Foldgers commercials.  I don't know why, but I just do.  It is comforting and it is something I can rely on because we are all addicted to caffeine in this household.  I don't think there has been a day in this house since we moved in here 17 years ago that the coffee pot hasn't started brewing at 6:00am on the dot.  Except for when my mom is out of town... my dad just makes a whole pot and puts it in the refrigerator and nukes a cup every morning.  He's the type of person that would live off of mac 'n cheese and hot dogs if my mom ever died.  Poor dad.

Plans for today:

a)book flight to Missouri

b)choose music for my uncle's wedding (I'm so excited that I get to play... I wasn't going to be able to go because we really can't afford it and I have another uncle that is having his change of command that day in Newport News that I was planning on going to.  It is unfortunate that he doesn't get to see his brother get married, but he is currently the captain of the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower and he is retiring.  It is his big day, so he has to miss the wedding because the admiral can't reschedule the ceremony.  On a different tangent, I went to the last change of command where he became captain of the carrier... I got VIP passes and when one of the helo pilots told me I wasn't allowed in a certain corridor because it was the captain's quarters, I just flashed my pass and was like 'Oh yeah, take that you fucker!'.  He apologized profusely and I felt so important.  It was great.)

c)practice the tchaikowski because I've been to 3 rehearsals and the concert is in less than a month.  Yikes!

d)learn Mozart's flute concerto in G because I have an audition on March 14th and I need to know the first and second movements

e)maybe do some English homework

f)make my bed

g)help Nancy out (Her sister is bleeding internally and the doctors don't know from where, and she is probably not going to last much longer... Plus Snuggles, her dog, is dying of cancer and has been having strokes and heart attacks recently.  She adores that dog and doesn't have the heart to put him down.  And all this is happening at once.  <i>And</i> she babysits for a living (that's how I know her... she watched me from the time I was six weeks old until I didn't need a sitter anymore... she is like my grandmother), and we all know how hectic it can be with a bunch of chatty, hyper toddlers wreaking havoc everywhere.  And Nans is getting old and senile and impatient and the parents don't pay her and they mistreat her, so she is in a perpetual state of annoyance.  Plus she works 7 days a week (she owns a convenience store out in Luray and has to cover the weekend shifts) and doesn't take any holidays.  About 10 years ago she found out she had stomach cancer and had to take a sabbatacle and the parents were pissed off at her and took their kids elsewhere after she recovered.  They called her 'unreliable' . . . She was in the hospital about a year back with a potentially life-threatening condition, and one parent had the nerve to call Nans <i>while she was in a fucking hospital bed</i> to ask her 'Well, where am I supposed to take so-and-so?' because she had to go to work.  What the cock?  But wait, there's more: she docked her paycheck for the days she was in the hospital <i>having surgery</i>.  If anybody that reads this ever has kids, take this advice: never dock a private sitter when they take a vacation or are sick.  Sure it is an inconvenience to find another sitter on such short notice, but... don't you get sick leave?  And paid vacation?  This is what she does for a living, it's not just some hobby.  Why can't she have a vacation?  And like she can help it when she's sick... She pays for their meals, their diapers, and even buys Disney movies (she has hundreds, all for those little brats).  Treat your sitters well, as they have the life of your child in their hands.)  

Sorry, I got off on a tangent.  

I would like to apologize to anyone I ran into or talked to yesterday for my retarded behavior.  Especially you.  Not <i>you</i> silly, you... yeah, the tall one in the back with the gorgeous hair.  I was being schitzo and am tremendously embarassed.  But everything I had said before still stands, and I'm around if you need me.  Even if... 

I guess I should get crackin'."

"event","I was angry all day today for some reason or another.  I went to bed angry and got the best sleep I've had in months.  I woke up mad, didn't have time to take a shower, didn't get food, went outside and my car wouldn't start. Fuck.  So my dad has to take me to school.  I get into the student parking lot and see Steve and Meri together (why should I keep censoring names? It's not like I was fooling anyone in the first place) and that just made things worse.  That was the last thing I wanted to see so I got out of the car in the middle of the road with  people behind us and stormed into school.  Gah!  They got there before I did!  I was fuming by this time, even though I had no reason to be, which made me even more mad.  That was in the first hour that I was awake, so needless to say, my day was pretty much predetermined to suck.  But I'll say it anyway: my day sucked.  But I came home and my mom wanted to take me out for coffee to calm me down, so we went to Borders.  Aaahhh.  That's the sound of me starting to relax and not be so bitchy.  Grrrr.  That's the sound of my nerves being fried because the cute little girl with thick glasses standing 20 feet away from me isn't getting the fucking toy that she wants and she is stomping her feet and crying and yelling that she wants a goddamned toy and I want to choke her until she is blue in the face and you can start disciplining your child ANY FUCKING TIME NOW.  Okay, it's cool Kathryn, relax.  You're home and don't have to work... Hooray!  But you have to go to band practice... Booooooooo!  Oh well, things could be much much worse.  New York will make me feel better.  If nothing else, it will make it easier to quit smoking (if I was addicted) when I go there.  Not only would I have to take out a loan to pay for them, but why smoke when I could just take a deep breath of 'fresh' air?  Nothing like exhaust fumes to start your day.  

Okay, I think I have calmed down enough to function as a normal adult now.  I can go let myself loose in Manassas without picking a fight and being obnoxious.  I hope.  Cross your fingers."

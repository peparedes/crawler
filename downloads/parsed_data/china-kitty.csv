Bullies ('nuff said) I HATE&nbsp;it when people bully others just to be &quot;cool&quot; as well as to impress their so-called &quot;friends.&quot;<br /><br />3.) Narrow-minded people/people who think they're ALWAYS&nbsp;right, but aren't. My dad is an example of this.<br /><br />4.) Fantards; People who get WAY&nbsp;TOO&nbsp;obsessive in their fandom. They often made a HUGE deal about the little things about their favorite character from shipping to hatred of a character.<br /><br />5.) People who call others stupid when they couldn't communicate in the same language. If you worked customer service, you may know what I mean. While we can understand that the person couldn't speak English, he or she shouldn't call others stupid when we're doing our best to help them.<br /><br />That's all, folks!"

I can't believe I've found another Lowena/Rowena! Not a common name though.

Speaking of A&amp;W, I've already sent my resume to various admin-type positions, including Tourism Vancouver and a few police departments.

We were totally understaffed because two of the cooks didn't show up for their shifts, one already quit and the other one is leaving soon but chose not to show up. It wasn't too bad though because it wasn't too busy for a Saturday. Funny thing is I had to work in the kitchen all evening (because one of the current cooks is still in training) and had forgotten that I had a hairnet on. So, whenever I helped a customer at the front I had this strange thing holding back my long hair and nobody even said anything bout it.

However, I am glad one of those cooks is leaving soon because I don't like her."

"event","Yesterday, some&nbsp;asshole walked into the A&amp;W where I worked and started complaining to the assistant manager. From the way he gestured and how he spoke, I know he sounded like trouble. In fact, his stature and his threatening manner scared the shit out of me and my two other co-workers (both girls) who were working at the front. From what I heard, he falsely accused one staff member from the morning shift of ""sabotaging"" his food. He even asked the assistant manager when was that particular co-worker of mine is working since he wanted to ""beat the shit"" out of him. (Of course, he refused to give out confidential information about his employees.) Seeing that me and the other girls looking very scared, the&nbsp;asshole asked the AM to talk in private. After he left, we asked the AM what was going on and he mentioned that he had no idea what he was talking about since the asshole mentioned that the food he was given gave him indigestion or something.

I had no idea if that asshole was trying to scam us into giving him free food or was he looking for someone to beat up. No matter what it is, I know it wasn't my co-worker or anyone else who ""sabotaged"" his food. I think the asshole must be high on something and got indigestion as a result. Man, I can tell you he's trouble.

In case you're wondering, yes, I am going to talk to my manager about it. I am pretty concerned for my co-worker's safety and praying he isn't coming back."

"event","Yep, my manager had promoted me to supervisor last Friday. Ever since I was promoted I am determined not to make the same mistake as one of my last ones.

You see that girl used to be a hard worker long before she was promoted. After she became supervisor, she started slacking off and disappear for a period of time where she was needed the most. She even left people to ""fend for themselves"" and often left the workplace without telling anyone where she was going. At this one time, the drive-thru had gotten so busy that I had to call that girl for help. As it turned out she was nowhere to be found, leaving me and the only available cook working alone. After a while she showed up with a bunch of grocery bags and it turned out that she had left the place. (Man, I was mad at her too.) Because supervisors and managers get free food, she constantly gave them to her family and friends (which is, of course, against the rules.) A year as a supervisor passed and then she quit after being engaged to her boyfriend. Many people were really glad to see her go because she is SO freaking lazy!!

I haven't heard from that girl for a long time, but I've been told that she still refused to find a job after getting married. Serves her right."

My manager said that I am going to be supervisor from her own mouth, but as it turned out it's a lie. I was trained to do the managerial stuff, but no.

Worst still, that manager of mine had to promote the wrong people. At one time this girl was promoted to supervisor after working for ONLY 3 MONTHS!! Why? Because the manager liked her, but that was a HUGE mistake. Many of the employees hated her and many of them quit, including another supervisor. She even abused her position by becoming more arrogant and bossy. In fact, many of my co-workers prefer to have me as supervisor over her because I am less bossy and nicer too. The question is why didn't the manger promote me. It's because she doesn't like me at all despite putting a lot of trust into me.

In case you're wondering, I am actively finding myself another job. Once it's done, I am going to quit that fast food joint once and for all! I hate my manager; she's so unethical and worst than the last.

At least that girl quit after being demoted because she really deserved it after making a huge mistake after another."

It's pretty interesting even though some of the products displayed are pretty strange, especially the food I had sampled. Many people think health food tastes gross, but they're not because they were done right. However, one of the strangest I've tried is a beverage made out of marine phytoplankton which the representatives claimed had lowered the risk of cancer. ICK!! That stuff tasted like cough syrup!! Another product I've tried are sour cream and cream cheese made out of tofu and believe it or not they taste good. They were totally like the real thing that you may find it hard to believe it was made from soy products. For vegans and people who are lactose intolerant, this is prefect for them.

I did receive a bag full of samples of teas, chips, and medicine (for headaches and stomach problems), but one sample that really shocked me was a jar of shark cartilage capsules. o_O People have told me that these have some health benefits, but I am totally weary of something like this since there are no scientific proof about them.

My mom had just returned from her trip in Hong Kong and man, my relatives had bought me tons of stuff for me, including a brand-new cellphone. Because there are tons of new clothes, my brother and I had to get rid of our old ones. I've already placed many of mine in bags, but I had to ask my brother before I could call the Salvation Army for a pick-up. (I am hoping my mom won't make a huge fuss like before since these are my clothing, not hers.) As for the new cellphone, I had to purchase myself a new SIM card as well as signing up for service before using. It even got a built-in camera so I can take pictures and download on my bro's laptop. Because of all those features, I am going to download some stuff to personalize my cellphone from a Naruto wallpaper to a ringtone that plays the Candy Shop song. ^^

I even got tons of new purses as well as a new backpack. The new backpack had some of my aunt's accessories and I had to remove them just to add my personal touches to it. Looked like it's time to purchase some keychains and strapped dolls for myself. ^^ I wonder if my friend Stefan could help me with that since I wanted to get some Capcom-related merchandise."

From what I've read so far, romance is good for Snake people such as me and more success in money is coming my way. I may not be superstitous like my parents and relatives, but they had to make me and my brother keep up with tradition. 

For instance, the house had to be cleaned before the lunar new year started because if people sweep the house during that time their luck and fortune would be taken away. Of course I was shocked at first after hearing about why shouldn't we clean the house during the first few days Chinese New Year. Also it is considered unlucky to say something bad about family members. Don't ask, there are stories associated with those traditions. Like the western society who consider the number 13 to be unlucky, Asians considered the number 4 to be bad because it almost sounded like ""death.""

Sadly, my mom won't be returning from her trip in Hong Kong until Sunday. She originally supposed to come back on January 25th, but due to some uncertain circumstances she had to delay the return trip for (almost) two weeks."

Alexis, one of my co-workers, told me that the pipes in the washrooms were busted and had flooded the entire resturant thus putting them in ankle deep water. Fortunately, they managed to stop most of the shit in the water from going into the kitchen. Even the entire kitchen floor was covered with grease. Worst still, that event happened in front of our regional manager. We had to close the lobby first, but keep the drive-thru open (as mentioned by the restaurant owner who was there.) Of course, my co-workers don't like the idea of that since we cannot serve food in unsanitary conditions like this. There the entire place had to close up until the pipes were fixed and the place cleaned up and sanitized.

I was thankful that I wasn't there when it happened, but I can see the aftermath and smelled the bleach too. I am just glad my co-workers closed the place for sanitary reasons. I can believe that restaurant owner is one freaking twat for keeping the place open despite all that. The problem with him is that he NEVER listens to his employees. He would ONLY get into action if customers and/or the health department complained to him."

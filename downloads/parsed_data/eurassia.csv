"event","So someone stole my BMX.

But they didn't just steal it.  No.  In fact, they dug around the pole that it was locked up to, ripped the cement block from under the ground, and tore off the metal ""no parking without permit"" sign outside my house despite it being attached by several industrial-sized metal bolts.  They slid my bike off the pole and away they were.

Honestly, whoever you are, did you happen to see all the equally nice unlocked bikes on my neighbours lawns?  If only you put that much work into a real job, you might actually be less of a loser.

The part that actually annoyed me wasn't falling or everyone seeing it, but that I was obviously hurt and no one asked if I was okay or tried to help me up.  In fact, people chuckled while others behind me were annoyed that I was in their escalator walkway.

He and his wife bought me eggs benedict and strawberry cheesecake at a nice restaurant in Abbotsford...  perhaps the cause of the sleepy wreck?  Damn you, DAMN YOU EGGS BENEDICT!

My car looks like somebody died in it.  Goddamn it, I loved that car.  It had my 80s childhood written all over it.  And I had painted it turquoise a few years back.

Oh and of course, I just had to put a $50 tank of gas in it right before I left.

I WANT MY GAS BACK, THAT STUFF IS PRICY!

So yes, my car it totalled.  I went to emergency and after three hours and a catscan on my head they sent me home.  I think it's because I couldn't remember stuff and I couldn't speak properly or really understand what people were saying to me.  I was really screwed up I think.  Doctors are losers.  The one I had was such a waste of an egg and sperm.  Anyways, I cut up and bruised my knees and my entire body feels like I was hit by a truck, but I might be going for some physiotherapy and hopefully that will clear up that.

"event","Dear Livejournal,

I am back in Canada.  Since when did it snow so much in Vancouver?  I saw three fresh accidents on the way home from the airport.  They were all with taxis.  Taxi drivers are road idiots.  They will kill you.  KILL YOU AND YOUR PUPPIES!

LOVELY THINGS I LEARNED ABOUT THE UK:
-hearty meals
-a good ale
-you can smoke inside
-villages, actual villages...
-amazing southern coastline
-old buildings and rich history
-castles, castles, castles! castles for everyone!
-everyone's house is at least 100 years old
-legal and non-legal taxis... the latter takes you away and rapes you, but only half the time so odds aren't that bad, and it's cheaper!
-CRAZY DRIVING... which you can view as either fun or frightening (having rented a car for the trip, I found it fun crashing lots!)
-there is no such thing as ""waitress"" or ""server""... also, Tipping is really just a city in China
-tax is included in the price... finally!

UNFORTUNATE THINGS I LEARNED ABOUT THE UK:
-it is very much ""1984"" come alive and I have to say that it scares the fuck out of me... CCTV camera, anyone?
-it is a very sexist, male dominated culture where they will actually give you smaller food portions that the men
-everyone is stuck in their situation, horribly out of debt, and caught in a circle of weekend binging to make them feel better about the shitty job they have to work to keep alive in a high-priced world
-there are incredibly few scholarships for students... there is little funding for the people in general, including the arts--God, I love Canada
-the threat of terrorist attacks within the country is more real that the news in Canada lets on... there are no garbage bins on the streets because of bombs
-in London, people are out for themselves... do I REALLY have to be ignored when I am just asking for directions?
-everyone hates their country and wants out... with banks running the country, the UK having sold off all its major industries, massive growing debt, and great public disdain, it seems that the UK is headed not only for a recession but for some kind of rebellion of the people...
-oh and also, no one recycles

SUMMARY!
The UK was an awesome, interesting, engaging, and mostly fun place to be (except for being ignored in social situations when you're a girl), but I would never, ever want to live there permanently.

Love,
Eurassia"

"event","FRIDAY!
1. Creepy fluroscent gromet party.  Luckily, as we head up to the party we pre-see this through the window and catch a passing cab with Alex yelling ""Let's get out of here, NOW!""
2. Party on Knight & 16th.  We never make it past the ever-popular ""fire exit stairwell party"".  After uneven horizontal standing challenges, we...
3. ...head off to a party a block away with live music.  But instead we miss the live music and eat free pizza.  Drunk boy in kitchen sees me and utters something along the lines of ""when you see the moon in your stars your eyes"" and proceeds to dance with a chair.

SATURDAY!
1. Leigh's Apartment Building Party.  Leigh is hot as always, as is Josh who VERY appropriately went as ""Prom 1970"".  And he is obviously the one at Prom 1970 who wanted in your pants.
2. Based on a very bad decision, eight of us pile into a car with three teenage girls who almost kill us every 10 or 15 seconds.  We all at some point have a moment of, ""Oh shit, I've made one too many wrong decisions in my life and now this is it. Fuck.""
3. Somehow get to the next party alive, and it turns out Alex used to live there.  Surprise!  Crazy house with nudity.  And fire.  I like.
4. Warehouse party.  Need I say more?
5. Our house, sometime after 4am, guitar being played in a room somewhere, feeling fully satisfied with ""Halloween Weekend"".  Thank you everyone.

THE CREW'S COSTUMES:
Brandon:  Clockwork Orange
Alex: Pipi Longstocking's First Period
Josh: Prom 1970
Harrison: Rhetorical Question
Me: Championship Diver 1925

BEST COSTUME:
Seen Friday at Fire Exit Stairwell Party:  ""MYSPACE"".  Costume includes working speakers and dazzling flashing lights.

BEST MOMENT:
When five teenage wiggers show up to a house party.  After much discussion, we discover they aren't in costume.  Also, they are made to look even more ridiculous as one woman at the party dressed up as a wigger for Halloween.  The ""leader"" (aka worst acne) comes up to us holding a miniature ziploc bag, ""Hey man, you wanna buy some bud?""  There is barely any marijuana in the bag.  One of them goes to Harrison and says, ""Hey man, look at this.  Bearspray!""  And they all have a can of bearspray in the pocket.  Then they stand around awkwardly and try to bum some beer.  BEST MOMENT:  ""THE WIGGERS""

Eurassia

Driving down the westcoast to California in the van was awesome.  We almost got busted by the cops.  We slept by the beach everyday.  We saw little towns.  We surfed.  We juggled.  We went into caves.  We blew bubbles.  We pet lions.  We stalled the van on train tracks.  We mounted a pirate flag on the van.  We got searched at the US border because US-ians hate hippie vans.

We had one of the most epic trips of our lives.

In all this we found the real name of the van in a small town on Oregon coast called Myrtlewood.  Apparently to the Japanese Christian American at the gift shop, Myrtlewood trees only grow in Israel.  But then God imported them to Oregon, the new holy land.  And they only grow in Israel and that one town of Oregon.  Hence, the van was thusforth called ""Myrtle"".  Thank you Myrtle.  You are my new holy land.  You're old and you rock my world.  (If you ever become Christian I will push you off a cliff.)"

It's a 1974 Ford Econoline Camper, and although it's the same bangin style because it's a different make than a Volkswagon it didn't cost me $20,000... it was actually under $1500!  I talked the guy down a few hundred in true Eurassia style of course (thank you Asian mother).  It's got a stove, fridge, furnace, couch/bed, hitch, and it's just been done up.  It's also been with the same owner since it was bought back in '74 and he fixes up vehicles!

Guys, guys, guys... I have wanted something like since I was like... TEN.  Think of the roadtrips NOW, bitch!

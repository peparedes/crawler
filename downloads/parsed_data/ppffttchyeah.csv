"event","sometimes i feel like im the only one in the world. like within my limits.
everyone seems so happy lately and i feel happy too, don't get me wrong. but sometimes i feel so alone, like no one is there for me to reach out and grab onto. i just wish i could feel more complete more often. when im with dave, i always feel amazing. but then its like he doesn't ever really feel the same. it feels the same when im with him, but i don't know what goes on in his head when im not there...or even when im there for that matter.

i wrote song lyrics the other day. even though i can't play any instrument to go along with them..so they are basically words on a page, with no meaning unless someone with the skills can actually make them come alive.

one day itll go by
someone will yell and you'll ask how
how could you just mess up so bad
how could you let your life drift by

if you could turn back
and change everything about it
would you jump at the chance?
take that one last chance?

you feel like your drifting
high about the world
your so lonely
so lonely and cold

if you could take one last step
with the one that you love
would you trade it all?
to be loved and not alone?

mr. your so perfect
and mrs. you pathetic waste of human
lets see you live this life
and tell me its easy

tell me its just that easy..



yes, those were it. weird, and yet no one will probably not get them. oh well.

later lovers."

"event","ok so last time i wrote to you guys was the night of band practice. ive been soooo busy since then with all this crap im dealing with.

ok first off, me and dave basically almost broke up on friday night..well we sorta did for like 3 minutes..but still. so the game was fun! haha not. but we did play a kickass halftime show. best one we've done. people loved it.

then i thought everything was ok. cause we talked a little about it, but it still felt weird to me for some reason. well the story gets deeper. we had UMASS band day on saturday (aka yesterday) and that was pretty awsome. our band got the whole stands to do the wave haha. leave it to ben canning to make that shit happen haha. then i got home and started talking to dave. well, this felt really really weird. so finally i just asked him to tell me the truth about like everything. when he did, i never felt the worst feeling in my life. like literally, i felt betrayed, used, hurt, shocked, etc. but then we kept talking about everything and it started getting better, slowly. very very slowly. but now i actually feel better about the situation. i suppose i can be happy that what he told me didn't involve him cheating on me. so thats a plus.

And now today is sunday. sunday morning actually. im suppose to see dave today. we're probably gonna talk about stuff and just really be honest in person. cause phone/aim with this type of stuff sucks. but im more happy to be seeing him period than anything. i just really need to have a good hug and just get to understand things better.

oh and i also love how i this major project due...and i haven't even started it. its due tuesday. yes! go jess!

later loverrrsss"

hmmm..yeah today was cool. ill be changing names so people don't get all pissed. ok. first off..hmm..lets call him ""rick"". ""rick"" claims to not want to talk to me anymore and just harasses me. its starting to piss me off. we dated, it failed. get over it and leave me alone. i don't try and contact him, yet somehow he always finds something to say to me.

umm besides ""rick"" its been pretty great. i love how life got better after him. i mean jeez, look who i have now. dave. perfect amazing dave.

 my friends and i try to party hardy. not gonna lie. AND I actually found someone in my school who says im not gonna lie too. it was basically love. yeah, it was.

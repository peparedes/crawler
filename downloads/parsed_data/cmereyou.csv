"event","<center>What can I compare you to, a window the sun shines through? 
Maybe the silver moon, a smile rising
The magic of the fading day, satellites on parade
A toast to the plans we've made to live like kings.

What can I compare you to, when everything looks like you? 
I get a bit confused with every Spring
Flowers that bloom your eyes, hummingbirds side by side
My heart won't stay entirely in this rib caging


oh and summer is amazing.</center>"

"event","<center>So far, this weekend has been great and so christmasy. Hanging out with hannah and miriam and a few others at abbey's was really fun. And even though i got two hours of sleep, work next morning at 8 am was suprisingly not bad at all. 
After work i decorated the christmas tree with my mom which has always been so nostalgic for me. Its sad jake wasnt here to help us this year. 
That night was pretty christmasy too. Ian and i went to fountain square for the DOWNTOWN DAZZLE where we witnessed santa and two elves repel down the side of macy's and also an awesome fireworks display. Then we went to my parents christmas party, which was kind of disappointing because this little kid, who was cute at first, wouldnt leave us alone. AND all the food was already eaten. Atleast i got to have saag and some delicious peppermint hot chocolate. 
These pictures dont do the fireworks justice at all...but here they are anyways.

"event","Last month i got three traffic tickets- one for speeding 18 miles over the limit and two for driving with expired plates. I went to court today and i've been so nervous about it for the past few weeks. I thought for sure i would have to pay over 400 dollars in fines and court fees, or even get my license suspended. The judge told me that normally i would have to pay 201 dollars in court fees plus 289 dollars in fines. But, for some reason or another, he said he was only going to make me pay court fees! Then, he fucked up and made my payment ticket out for 177 dollars instead of 201. What an idiotttt. So basically, i lucked out and saved over 300 dollars and i didnt get my liscense taken away!!!! What a huge relief. i cannot believe that im so lucky. 
In other news, i love andy's mediterranean grill and baklava. and im so excited for thanksgiving! Even though i wont be able to spend it with my dad and jake, and even though my mom decided to cook a ""less traditional meal"" (which probably means grilled cheeses or something), im looking forward to the break from school. Thanksgiving is usually my favorite holiday and this year its probably going to suck. oh well, im sure the seigel family will have some good food i can take that day.
Well, i better get back to the 6 or something applications i have to finish....Jeez."

I'm counting out dollars while I limp to your brownstone.
I can just barely cover what I need to get back home.
And I know we're allowed indiscretion in our lives,
but I've been making mine count every night for a while.

I keep deleting your number and name from my cell phone,
but I call every day; that's as far as my act goes.
What you have helps me turn down the noise that I make,
but when it stops it just pokes me and keeps me awake.
My friends always warned about living cliches
but my friends aren't there when I meet you these days.
I count people and street signs from the back of your car
and then skip back excited to wherever they are.

I take risks in the stall while they talk by the bar.
I won't go back outside til my memory starts
erasing itself into something less brutal,
some beautiful bullshit I pretend to belong to.
For as long as the truth tucks itself into bed,
and the beat of my heart and the heat of my breath
keep me hopeful and distant and proud of myself,
I'll keep ringing your bell every night around twelve."

"event","if these weeks keep goin by as fast as they are summer will be here in like two minutes. everyones stressin about school but things have really been a breeze lately. after aps are over, the time will fly by even faster. SUMMER 06- SEE YOU SOON!

you know what else will help the time go by even quicker!??! a CAR! good bye metro bus, walking, and bumming rides home from school off EVERYONE. we're mainly buying it because tims best friend is selling it and ""its more reliable that way."" im getting it this weekend, but who knows when ill have insurance. hopefully this weekend too. in case you were wondering its a white saturn SL 1995(?). and no, it does not have 3 doors. :(

too bad im gonna be so broke buying gas and paying insurance. i was so excited about getting a raise at work but i got raised from 6 dollars an hour to an AWESOME 6.25. today at lunch people were talking about making anywhere from 8 to 12.50. what the fuck? they probably dont have to wear smocks or deal with creepy male customers who ""accidentally spilled something on their pants."" i hate my job. most of the time. stephanie and paige help to make it a lot more fun. 

well anyway, im ready for a kickass weekend.. how bout you?"

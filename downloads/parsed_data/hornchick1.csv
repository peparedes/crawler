"event","im doing so much better this year so far. im staying on top of my homework and studying alot. it feels good but sometimes there is the feeling that it is a little too late. i dont know why, i only did bad in 2 classes in my whole high school career everything else is a's and b's. not to mention ive never taken a regular class if an honors one was offered. ive already got college credit under my belt and more coming soon... so why am i still so worried?
today i put in my application for Florida State. i almost got my bright futures application done but my computer kept freezing so im gonna do it tomorrow.
i have to get my physical papers in tomorrow, i have an appointment at 245 so im gonna ask the office ladies if i can fax it or if they can wait for me to come back... it shouldnt take long. 
softball is going to be interesting, i think the fact that i am one of the only seniors going out for it and the fact that all of the coaches know me personally and know that whatever i lack in phenomenal talent i make up for in dedication, leadership, and team building skills. coach parker said im a solid player and that i have an assured spot on varsity as long as i havent forgotten how to play... yea right, me forget the love of my life... i dont think so.
im so happy that i wrecked my car right now.
even tho it is difficult to find people kind enough to pay me back for all the times i gave them rides to and from places WAY out of my way i think it is becoming one of those blessing in disguise because im able to do things i wasnt able to do. and i find that i am doing more of the things i should be doing...

my mom says that if i make straight a's she is going to give me 5 thousand dollars towards a car and allow me to use her credit to buy a new used one. im thinking honda civic or something along those lines. unless i find my jeep CJ7 in good condition. im sure i will, and then i will be riding in style up in tallahassee. im starting to agree with those who say, ""good things come to those who wait..."" well here i am, patiently awaiting my reward for working hard, and i see it in my near future. it looks goooooooooood.

no more mark = no more stress
no more stress = happy lindsey
happy lindsey = happy mommy
happy mommy = car for lindsey
car for lindsey = happy lindsey
happy lindsey = an increasing opportunity cost... lol, just kidding. economics on the brain"

homework is killing me. right now i am so hyper, i am on my third latte. ill probably have one more before the night is over with. i have to finish my english project and the summer reading assignments that i was supposed to have done last week. and i still have math and economics homework to finish.

im also listening to the same song over and over again... actually i am alternating between two songs but they sound alike so that doesnt really make a difference. its that one song by the lesbian group, i dont know the name of the song but they basically sing ""not gonna get us"" over and over again, its the techno version of it. and then i have the techno version of ""baby your all that i want.... when your lying here in my arms... im finding it hard to believe that we're in heaven.,.."" so yea, im weird but its helping keep me awake and focused.

Frightful must it be; for supremely frightful would be the effect of any human endeavour to mock the stupendous mechanism of the Creator of the world. His success would terrify the artist; he would rush away from his odious handywork, horror-stricken. He would hope that left to itself, the slight spark of life which he had communicated would fade; that this thing, which had received such imperfect animation, would subside into dead matter; and he might sleep in the belief that the silence of the grave would quench for ever the transient existence of the hideous corpse which he had looked upon as the cradle of life. He sleeps.

accidents of life. what if we were an accident; or a miscalculation. what if the reason we cant find any other life and why no other form of life is willing to approach us is because we are a time bomb. if we know that our actions are going to ultimately end in our termination why do we continue on the same path? isnt total annihilation a good incentive to take another route... or to make a drastic change? here we are, floating in nothing, made of everything, and destroying all that we touch. conveinantly trapped by our surroundings and the simple fact that we will destroy ourselves. what do police do to a bomb they cant stop? they isolate it and make sure that when it goes off it doesnt damage or endanger anything else.

what if god realized his mistake? what if we were the frankenstein of his creations? if he knew that we were hazardous to all the others he created dont you think he would protect them from us? we are parasites. ok look at it this way. the earth is a host. in a symbiotic relationship the earth and humans would have to mutually benefit from each other.... or just coexist in harmony. so what do you call the relation ship of the earth and the humans that are slowly destroying her, sucking her resources dry and planning on moving on to another host. why do you think they are pushing nasa to make it to other planets... to land people on other worlds? we want to destroy this host and move on to another, just like a virus. we are equivalent to a stellar flu. seek and destroy. there's no logic in it. eventually we run out of resources and have no more hosts to depend on.

when you think about it, we are worse than parasites. parasites have no reasoning capabilities, they are like machines and only do what instinct tells them too. we have the ability to change and evolve. we have developed ways to help save the earth. but our own nature destroys any hopes of this taking place. which is more important? living or having money. life or power? humanity or social status?

they tasted like crap. i suck at cooking. oh well, ill make my future husband cook. are there any experienced cooks out there looking for a useless wife? ill work out so i can be trophy wife if that is any consolation.

this morning i turned on the tv in between cleaning and doing ap english homework and listening to the radio. (ive been told its an ADD thing) on the tube was this infomercial about the ""ball"". its a work out gimic with this guy who apparently trains stars like ben affleck, and some others i didnt recognize. i started feeling depressed. i wanted to buy it because it was ""miraculous and a guarenteed way to shapen up and lose weight."" i started looking around the house for anything that could have substituted for the ball. i felt like working out.---amazing. couldnt find anything so i almost thought about calling and buying the damn thing.  then i realized that jessica has one so i figured i'd go over there later and work out with her but she is at cypress gardens with rich and his family. so i made a promise to myself to get up and run tomorrow like i usually do. ive been slacking on my work outs. i feel so fat when i skip it but then i realize that i have been working out for 2 monthes and NOTHING HAS CHANGED!!!  i dont get it. am i destined to always be chubby. im not fat... im not skinny... im always just a little over average. i hate being stuck in the middle. thats where i always seem to be. i can never jump to one side or the other. i have to be stuck in the middle and a little of both. the confusion can kill me sometimes.

i hate it when i am getting ready to go somewhere and im doing my make up and my hair and everything looks awesome. but then i look at the full length mirror and i put some clothes on and every shred of confidence i had is now completely shattered. i feel like attaching c4 to the mirror and watching it explode. or just attaching the c4 to myself and enjoying the release. messy. 

the average factor applies to all aspects of my life. in school, sports, music, love, friends, work, and just life itself. im never the outstanding student, outstanding musician, outstanding athlete, empoyee, girlfriend, or friend.
IM AVERAGE... SOMEONE GIVE ME A GODD**N AWARD FOR BEING THE AVERAGE JOE-ETTE!
average sucks. i feel like wallpaper. i feel like the glue holding the wallpaper up."

Algebra 2 honors with mr pink...AGAIN! yea i failed it on purpose last term
Spanish 2 with ms. moreno... she doesnt really speak english, interesting
AP English Literature with ms thomas. if i pass... my first two years of college english are done!!! wute wute.
AP Micro and Macro economics with mr walsworth. he's hilarious. he likes to yell, not in a mad way, just a ""im really smart and this is simple"" kind of yelling.

no band... all academics... all hard academics... but i will have no finals whatsoever... walsworth doesnt give a final... neither does thomas (THANK YOU AP!!!!)  spanish 2 is really easy and im gonna ace that class so no final there... and you would think that since i am taking algebra 2 honors for the second time with the same teacher that i will ace that class because i still have all of my homework and all of the tests and quizzes and i know whats on the final... AWESOME. this will be the first time i get a good grade in a math class. my gpa could use it."

"event","My name represents me accurately in all of my complexity. Lindsey means ""a Linden tree by the water"" according to Old English. At first I was frustrated by the simplicity of the meaning of my name. I wanted a mysterious name, a romantic one full of meaning like ""exalted"" or ""holy"" or ""powerful."" As I started to think about trees and what could be so exciting about a tree by the water, I realized that no other name would better symbolize all that I am. A tree is a living paradox full of symbology. Conflicts of thoughts and emotions are embedded in the image of the tree. The roots of the tree bury deep into tradition and family, taking comfort in the warm shelter of the ground; perfect stability. The branches and leaves, at the other end, reach out, forever searching, growing, and changing; thirsting ambition. The tree never moves, yet re-invents itself in a constant cycle. The seasons accent various qualities hidden within the tree. In the winter, the tree loses its leaves. It becomes ugly and naked; vunerable. It looks dead, lost and forgotten. As spring melts away winter, the tree blossoms and explodes with happiness, life and beauty. Vitality and valiance radiate around the tree and infect those closest to it. Summer is the unpredictability of life. Long droughts and torential downpours can happen back to back. Hurricanes and firestorms rage unchecked. Beautiful sunny days full of laughter and play scatter themselves amoung the moments of madness. Fall forshadows winter but comes with its own set of emotions. Resilliance and flexibility are most apparent as it prepares itself for the long cold winter. Sometimes, if you look hard enough, the radical colors can reveal just a glimpse into the attitude and drive that keeps the tree's will to survive afloat and its heart beating."

no homework... usually and if there is its a bunch of bullshit
no assignments in class... likewise with the bullshit factor
and hence no reason for me to go... especially if i have better things to do.

my mom and i are patching things back up. i feel so relieved to know that mark is no longer a part of my life. i dont have to deal with his sick twisted demented thought processes. and... if he ever does anything to hurt me or my mother i will not hesitate to call the same cop that was here a couple nights ago. because that cop also thought that he was a sick twisted fuck.

"event","<P>i am a selfish brat who doesnt appreciate all that my alcoholic mother has done for me. i am a ungrateful bitch that has no family. i am a drama queen with unrealistic opinions and ideas. i have my tongue pierced which means that i love to have oral sex and lots of it... with guys and girls. i have no respect for my family or anyone for that matter. i am lazy, ignorant, manipulative, deceiving, high on drugs all the time, drunk all the time, irresponsible, stupid, little girl who will never make anything of&nbsp;herself ever.</P>
<P><lj-cut text=""well now that you know what my step dad thinks of me, let me explain the afformentioned paragraph...""> </P>
<P>since ive gotten my tongue pierced my mother had begun to accept it and get over it. this weekend her and my stepfather had plans to go to st pete beach for a ""honeymoon/mark's birthday present"" trip. which was awesome because that means i hvae the house all to myself.</P>
<P>mark came over yesterday so start packing and say happy new year to me and all. i went to the store with the money i earned working with linda and bought cake mix for jesse's party and the surprise party i planned for mark. i got home and my mom was crying histerically, of course it was marks fault. he decided to disagree with my tongue ring and cause a big raucous about it. we argued for about an hour... my mother was drunk so the whole thing was pointless.<BR>but it got pretty heated and i went to my room to avoid it.</P>
<P>i think my mom and mark got into a pretty big argument after that because she came barging into my room asking for her keys... i had them because i didnt want her driving any where, i told her i didnt know where they were. she got pissed and start demanding her keys. i called philip and had him come get me. my mom said that she wanted to drive down to Boca Raton to see my godmother that night so i took the keys with me just to be sure she wouidnt. i called to check on her an hour later. she was still at home but she was packing to HITCHHIKE DOWN TO BOCA!!! i freaked out and had philip drive me home to stop her. i called my brother and he got on his way over. </P>
<P>when i got there we got into an argument about none other than my tongue ring... i was so pissed that she thought that my priorities were screwed and that i took her keys to be a bitch and to get attention that i took the damn thing out and threw it on the ground.... NOTHING CHANGED... SHE WAS STILL PISSED AND DIDNT EVEN SAY ANYTHING ABOUT ME TAKING IT OUT. so i put the damn thing back in and tried to leave. she blocked the door, GRABBED THE HOOD OF MY JACKET AND THREW ME IN THE BATHROOM. THEN SHE THREW ME AGAINST THE WALL CALLING ME BITCH AND SLUT. i tried to get out of the bathroom.... but i couldnt so i called 911. i talked to the operator and got my mom to talk to her. as my mom was distracted i nudged her off the door and almost got out. after she realized what i was doing SHE PUSHED HERSELF UP AGAINST THE DOOR TO KEEP ME FROM LEAVING AND SHE FELL BACKWARDS OUT OF THE BATHROOM AND FELL ON HER BACK. SHE GOT UP AND GRABBED ME CALLING ME BITCH AND HITTING ME SWINGING ME AROUND AND THREW ME ON THE BED AND STARTED TO HIT ME. </P>
<P>philip finally got past mark (WHO AT THE TIME OF ALL THIS WAS SITTING THERE MAKING FUN OF MY SCREAMING, MOCKING ME AND LAUGHING... SICK TWISTED FUCK) and philip pulled my mom off of me. i got out of the house. mark tried to call the cops to say that philip was intruding in our house but i had already called the cops so that wasnt flying. we drove down the street to get away from mark and my mom and waited for the cops.</P>
<P>when they got there i told them everything and they collected statements from me, philip and my step father. my brother finally got there, and he was by my mother's side the whole time. the cops escorted me back into the house to get some clothes so i could stay the night with philip.&nbsp; </P>
<P>so as of now, i dont have family because my brother said i fucked up. he says he doesnt care if mother is holding a knife to my throat... i NEVER call the cops on mom. he said that if she goes to jail for this (which i dont want... i want a restraining order against mark) that he will disown me forever. when i told him i wanted to move out and go away forever he got up and went to punch me and said ""IF YOU WERENT MY SISTER I WOULD PUNCH THE FUCK OUT OF YOUR FACE YOU SELFISH BITCH.""</P>
<P>i want to die. i really do. i dont know where to go or what to do. i am so lost, and i dont see&nbsp;a way out of it. death.</P>"

the culprit of my sickness has been sighted and is now being eliminated.

revalation 1- i am in love with philip
revalation 2- screw what anyone else that tries to convince me otherwise
revalation 3- as hard as a long distance relationship would be... living without the person i know i cant live without is just plain stupid
revalation 4- who throws away their most comfortable pair of jeans???

my point is clear to me. and that is all that matters... if you care, ask. 
if you dont, i really dont mind, because i have seen the error of my ways.

"event","ok so the parade was pretty awesome. i thought it was going to be lame and long. it was neither. we only marched for about 20 minutes... im not complaining... that was awesome. and then there were just random hilarious moments leading up to our performance. there was this ::whispers:: colored <--hahaha guy dressed as a rooster on stilts... yea, what does that have to do with christmas/??? beats me but he was still hilarious. he danced to our drum cadences. that was great. then there were ex presidents that had really big heads and sluts dressed as mrs. claus, the guys went nuts for that. and they probably werent sluts but i know mrs. claus does not look like that. lol, and then emileigh katie and i rode the mummy and took an awesome picture. and katie yelled at the annoying chicks behind us to shut up and they did. we bought the picture then walked around universal for an hour and ahalf... we went and played on fivel goes west (sp?) playground and had fun trying to fit into all the little kid small spaces and going down the slides. 
then we went to the bus and went to city walk... SO MUCH FUN! yay! we went to the nascar bar/arcade/whatever and katie tried to play DDR-HAHAHAHAHAHA, nah she wasnt that bad... yea she was but so was i. and she didnt exactly know how to play at first so thats probably why. then Huri and his cousin and his friend John showed up... yay! Huri is so sweet, i really like him. he was just so fun to hang out with. then wes and some others showed up FINALLY! alot of DDR dancing goin on, katie ended up talking for like 2 hours with Huri's friend John even tho she told me that she wasnt interested... well now she is. lol. awesome, he is really cool too. katie has met her perverted match. they out do eachother its hilarious... but thats later in the night, ok back to DDR. then brittany shows up and kicks everyone's ass at DDR. it was great. we headed out and went to a smoke shop to buy katie some cloves. we hung out there for a while and then we just walked around. it was cool, Huri kept me warm :) and then it was time to go to the buses to go home. 
they walked us to our buses and it was hilarious to hear what people had to say when they saw me with Huri. then as we were riding home he called me, and we made plans to meet somewhere, we went to denny's OMG SO HILARIOUS. i think we pissed off alot of peole around us with all the perverted talk, they left! it was awesome, we were there for about 2 hours. then we went to Huri's house and watched van helsing. katie had to go home around 3am so she did, and then huri and i stopped watching the movie after that... lol, ask me katie and you shall know. if ya want to, but im gonna tell ya anyways. and you know it.

then we fell asleep around 530am. and i woke up around 8am to go home. i told Huri i had to go, and he kinda mumbled something and then snored, so i thought he was dead asleep so i kissed him and said goodbye and had john take me home, well we got to the end of his street and Huri called and i guess he was mad that i left without saying goodbye and he hung up so we turned around. i went upstairs and Huri had locked the door. i felt really bad so i sat there until he finally let me in. he said he knew i had to leave and that he wasnt sleeping he was just slow. so i said i was sorry and he asked me to go to the movies with him tonight to see blade trinity. COOL! 

and that was my eventful night! here's to lots more!"

I just want to get it over with,
tears form behind my eyes,
but I do not cry,
counting the days that pass me by. 

I've been searchin' deep down in my soul,
words that I'm hearin' are starting to get old,
it feels like I'm starting all over again,
The last three years were just pretend,
and I say- 

*Goodbye to you,
goodbye to everything I thought I knew,
You were the one I loved,
the one thing that I tried to hold on to. 

I still get lost in your eyes,
and it seems that I can't live a day without you,
closing my eyes,
and you chase my thoughts away,
to a place where I am blinded by the light,
but it's not right. 

*Goodbye to you,
goodbye to everything I thought I knew,
You were the one I loved,
the one thing that I tried to hold on to. 

Hold on to...
and it hurts to want everything and nothing at the same time,
I want what's yours and I want what's mine,
I want you,
and I'm not giving in this time.

"event","wow, that was awesome. ok here's a recap of all the excitement... trust me, you'll want to read it. just hang in there, the last day is hilarious.

thursday- woke up at 2AM... ouch. left the house at 3 and boarded our plane at 6AM. sat by the window and had a blast. there was a one hour layover in memphis tennisee. HAHAHA COWBOYS EVERYWHERE! boarded another plane, once again next to a window having a good ole time. finally arrive in denver at 10 am (there's a 2 hour time difference so when added up i spent 6 hours in the air.) met my aunt and got a rental car. drove out to boulder colorado and had a campus tour. beautiful campus... absolutely gorgeous... but they were pretty snobby and i definately did not feel welcome at the University of Colorado so screw em. after that we got lunch and headed for my aunts house, after i got there i crashed and hit the hay cause i had been awake for 21 hours... damn jet lag. zzzzzzzz

friday- woke up at 530AM. my aunt drove us to boulder again to meet with the horn professor for a free lesson. yea, he was a jerk screw him. what an ass. after that we drove to fort collins to visit Colorado State University. AWESOMENESS!!! a little more modern than CU. and definately friendlier. i got a free dvd, video and cd from the drum major and coordinator of bands. both of them sat down with me and answered all my questions, they were awesome. they even went and got the mello section leader to talk to me about specifics and stuff... awesome. went on a campus tour, saw the dorms and the student union and everything. i got to see a class in session and the i met with the liberal arts advisor... HE WAS AWESOME!!! cant remember his name tho. so ive made up my mind... well sort of. fuck majoring in music... there's no point. im gonna go into liberal arts as an open option student and figure it out from there. yea its awesome. after that we got lunch and headed home to my aunts. we hung out and went to sleep. zzzzzzz

saturday- woke up at 6AM and drove 2 hours to Winter Park ski resort. got my ass WHOOPED. man, colorado snow is so different from east coast snow. way more powder than im used to. i wiped out so bad!!! I TOOK OUT A GODDAMN FENCE FOR CRYIN OUT LOUD! and i was only on a blue course! the runs are longer and steeper out there. i got the hang of it a little later... if i were to stay for a week i'd be ownin those slopes. that was some serious skiing. no one snowblades over there! i was the only one on the slopes that day with snowblades on. i felt like an outsider. but it was fun all the same. after that we drove home and went to a gingerbread house making party for my little cousins. too much icing,  my stomach was killing me. man, that was fun... too many kids. then i went to bed zzzzzzzz

sunday- woke up at 730 (woohoo, finally some rest) opened my belated birthday card and christmas card... i got 85 dollars in total!! woop woop! people are getting christmas gifts after all. tell me what ya want guys! then we packed and headed for the airport. first flight was alright, sat next to some cool chicks and got some sleep. after the layover in memphis i got stuck next to this middle eastern family that smelled so bad!!! HOLY CRAP I ALMOST PUKED SERIOUSLY. and to add on top of the smell, they had a screaming 3 year old spoiled brat that wouldnt shut up. so that was the flight from hell.

so now im home and i have to go to school tomorrow which suks so ill seeyou people tomorrow. dont expect me to move very quickly because my whole body is killing me. ouch. laters"

"event","ive made up my mind to tell him. but i dont know how. i think i am going to tell him the truth about somethings and see where that goes. and then tell him what the shrink said. and then tell him how i feel. hopefully he sticks around for the whole thing. and doesnt get pissed and drive off in a fury.

i just hope that he can forgive me somewhere down the line. and if not then i know it wasnt meant to be. ive gotta be honest with him tho. its not healthy for me to keep it inside.

didnt see this coming. but im not psychic so i guess i cant blame myself. but i will anyways..."

"event","i just got back from my counsilor session with the new counsilor. she's nice, i could see her degrees, she took alot of classes and i trust her. she was really nice. the last guy seemed to have this script he ran off of and a time limit preset that pissed me off. with her, she let the conversation go and gave good advice, she didnt seem to stage everything. she made alot of sense about philip. and i think i need to do something i havent wanted to do. but i am going to because i now know that it is better for me mentally and physically. it will be hard but she made some sense. ive still got to think about it and im going to talk to him but at least i have a better understanding of some things now. i think i like her, she was good. they are giving me a psychiatric evaluation... she really does think i have ADD. odd cause we joke about it all the time, but she honestly thinks i have it. lol, maybe, maybe not... OOOH SOMETHING SHINY...lol
maybe i should stop making fun of it if i have the possibility of having it... nah, ill just make fun of myself now. ok seeya later i gotta alot of potatoes to peel,,, bleh."

"event","why do i like you?
i know i love him.
he means so much 
and i think of you.
why am i confused
when i am so sure?
he is security and stabilty
and you are reckless abandon.
i am scared of you
and i feel safe with him.
so why do i like you 
when i love him?
my mind reaces in circles
but when i see you,
i dont think of him.
when i see him i think 
of you.
who is controlling my thoughts?
where are my feelings?
why do i like you
when i love him?
i see my future when i look at him.
i see you when i look at you.
you see me.
down deep where noone looks.
do you like what you see?
i dont.

why does she destroy herself?
happiness is distance
despare is a blanket that leaves your feet cold
loneliness chills my toes
guilt tickles my nose
sleep prolongs the nightmare
reality depresses hope."

"event","<P>gosh, i hate being confused. it sux. and i know i do it to myself just to put drama in my life. if anything goes perfect i gotta screw it up cause im used to conflict. the shrink i saw last year said its a self-destructive depression. he said that even tho i like to be happy i tend to destroy the things that make me happy on purpose. he said that there is no medication for it. he said that only counsiling and self control can fix it. fuck that. im not gonna depend my life on an individual whom i have no trust in, and who probably never even got a degree at college.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><lj-cut text=""my dream... and wtf does it mean?""> </P>
<P>??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????</P>
<P>i have reason, i have logic, so why do i do stupid things? and i know they are stupid when i do them. i had this dream last night, i was swimming in the ocean and i turned into a mermaid. as i swam i started to change, my hair grew longer, i grew taller, skinnier, and prettier. so i started to swim faster and faster, the changes began to develope rapidly and soon i was so tired i swam up to the beach and lay in the sand. slowly i changed back to human. but my body stayed taller, skinnier, and prettier. the only problem was that i was naked now. but when i lay there naked i was not ashamed nor was i afraid of anyone seeing me. i felt happy, just content to lay in the sand naked in the sun. i felt peaceful. im thinking this means that i am unsatisfied with myself and that i need a transformation of some kind. but it has to be a natural self induced change, and if i commit to it ill be extremely happy.<BR>i just wanna be happy, i really want to stop acting. everthing is fine, im fine, she's fine, we're fine. what is fine? where does fine rate on the happy scale? is it happy or unhappy? is there a cure to fine? its not sad but its not happy i guess. so is the middle a good place to be? im just as close to sad as i am to happy? so how does it make me better off?<BR>half empty? half full? here or not here, sane or insane, happy or sad, smart or dumb, pretty or ugly, nice or mean, strong or weak, motivated or lazy, LOVED OR UNLOVED.</P>
<P>im none of them. so what does that make me?</P>

"event","so honors band was as it always is, long, tiring, and usually unsatisfying. i got to know some cool people tho. heather and i talked and we both apologized for being bitches to each other, i really dont like having conflict with people but i am not nice when i do. she's been goin through crap with her family as much as i have. her mom is still the old heartless bitch. her mom is horrible, you think your parents are mean, no way, she is heartless.

i have this feeling someone likes me and its fun. im not sure if he does, but if he does i guess its just fun to flirt. 

yay! i get to go skiing while im in colorado, my uncle called this afternoon asking me what days we were going to be up there and i said we were leaving early thursday morning and returning on sunday night. and since my interviews are on thursday and friday... I GET TO SKI ALL DAY SATURDAY!!! AND SUNDAY MORNING!!! im so excited, i love skiing. my uncle and i are going to take on some of the hardest slopes in the rocky mountain range. he's excited because his wife cant ski and his kids are too young to ski and his buddys are usually too busy to ski so i get to go with him! its cool, mom and i are staying with them in their mountain condo friday night and saturday night. this is going to rock... snow!!!!!!!!!SNOW!!!!!!!!!i'd better get some warm clothes. seeya'll later."

"event","today was definately fun. i really enjoyed just being at state because i already knew how we would do. i mean come on, this is the state level competition... actually did better than i thought we would. crying over it is just stupid. no offense. so marching season is basically over, we only have to perform our show, one more time and that is for our parents on tuesday night. AHHH IM SO GLAD ITS DONE. as much fun as it is, i have been waiting for it to finish because that means im am even closer to graduation.
i think someone likes me and i think it is cute. he is really cute, to me. katie doesnt think he is cute. if i werent in love with someone else i'd probably date him for fun. he is really sweet. he followed me around alot today. :)

heather douridas is the most insufferable person alive. the biggest hypocrit alive, and the worst vicepresident of student relations/secretary/person who does absolutely nothing in the band alive. she sucks at marching, and she is a horrible leader. honestly how do you expect people to do things correctly when you ask them to when you yourself do not? i dont expect my section to be perfect all the time because i know that i myself am not perfect... not only do i think they respect me more than your section respects you i KNOW they like me more. MARK TIME FOR ONCE IN YOUR LIFE DAMNIT! i cant wait til concert season when i just blow you out of the water and laugh in your face. eat my dust. god i hate you so much. we used to be best friends and i dont regret it because you were human back then, you lied alot about stupid things just to get attention but i never held it against you. now you just think you are so goddamn perfect and you think that you have everything undercontrol and you are always right. newsflash idiot. YOU DONT. ok im done"

"event","boy oh boy does this suck. i just hope things can get back to somewhat normal. wow. 

so anywayssss.......... yea. ive got a lot of cleaning to do today. and some homework but thats about it. my mom was so trashed this morning and i was so tired that we are just now... at 430pm... getting up and doing stuff. lol. yea we're slackers but oh well. thats us. mark is starting to act funny. he has this passive smile on his face. i cant quite place his thoughts or his feelings. and that is weird because i have always been able to read him well.

jess, we do need another night like that. that was fun and i need to get away again. maybe this time we'll exercise too, lol.

festival was alright, considering that the tension could have been cut with a knife. SPRINGSTEAD!!! EA      GLES! HAHAHAHA yea craziness with katie. emileigh was climbing trees causing chaos being hilarious as usual. i was getting food all over my band shirt, and sleeping on the bus ride. wes. ur just odd. if you hit me like that again emileigh and i wont stop tickling you next time. haha. i have finding nemo and i have a new found hatred for pirates of the carribean. oh my gawd, overkill. three bands that we got to see all had pirate theme. and...... we didnt get to see them all. i expect to see alot of it at our fba festival. but oh well, we are going to blow the bands in our district away. yeaya! ok im done. laters"

"event","i feel really sad. i have a best friend and a really cool friend who are not cool with each other any more. and its really rough because i want to be there for both of them without making the other angry. if i understood the situation a little better i think i might be able to help. but thats not happening. festival was stupid. we did better and i improved on my solo. its still chaotically un organized but at least we qualified for state and were placed 5th over all out of 24 bands. we are going to kick our districts arses. hahahaha i said arse. tomorrow i am sleeping in and carving a pumpkin. i think i might do my throw up pumpkin again. or maybe another wicked cool design. ok well tomorrow ill update about the new crap happening with my step dad and my new alcoholic mother. goodnight."

"event","go check out emma lay's journal. it is oh so awesome. im so special! like i said, if you likes what you sees let me know, or wes. he understands the code better but i can find the cool pictures. yeaya! hahahaha this is great

ok ms jd needs to get the stick from her ass removed.  she seriously needs to realize that she is not the band director and that she does not run the band program. tonight, whilst standing in line at the concession stand during the third quarter break, mrs. logan (the national anthem singer) unlocked the gate so that band members could access the other stand to make the process move quicker. well ms jd and her bad self thought that they could come around and tell everyone to go ALL THE WAY AROUND THE BACK OF THE CONCESSION STAND to get to the line. when i politely (yes i seriously was polite... im not usually when it comes to her, but i was in a good mood... until) well i politely told her that ms logan was opening the gate so that we wouldnt have to. she proceded to get into my face and tell me to go around the back of the building. well i STILL POLITELY showed her that we were already going through the gate because of ms logan, she got even CLOSER in my face and said... ""YOU'RE WRONG! GO AROUND THE BUILDING!"" so i ignored her and when i reached the gate i screamed... ""WOW TOO BAD I WAS F-IN WRONG!!!!"" oh it was priceless. so tomorrow i am going to mr hart about her behavior and how if she wants respect shes gotta give respect. my spanish teacher is so right about that! thats the only thing she is right about but hey, she's a step up from ms jd WHO IS NEVER RIGHT BUT STILL THINKS THAT SHE IS!!! 

ok now im going to bed so i can get up early and run before going to band practice/festival.

screw you ms jd. go get a real job and a life. stop trying to run everyone elses. you are not god. and even he does not control every aspect of my life."

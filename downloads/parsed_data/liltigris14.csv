"event","&nbsp;I amaze myself sometimes. My Dad sends me meat for gifts, he's worried I don't get enough protein, so the last time (Easter) he sent me bacon wrapped tenderloins. Well, decided to eat areally tasty meal including said meat. I followed the cooking instructions, and set the oven on broil, with the steak 2-3 inches from the heat source for the first 5 minutes....I walked away for a few minutes, and when I came back the oven was smoking and there was a fire inside. Apparently, the bacon fat had somehow ignited and was on fire. I grabbed the extinguisher, but reluctant to lose my steak I thought for a moment. If I opened the door, more air would get in and the fire may spread, plus I would have to hose my steak. Buuuuuttt, if I let the fat just burn out while watching it closely, extinguisher in hand, the fuel source would hopefully burn out.

Sure enough, it finally ran out of bacon grease, and when I took my steak out, it was actually perfectly cooked!

Huzzah for calm in the face of emergencies.

In other news, the Kittens are growing like weeds. Ashlan has claimed one, which I'm so happy about because she works with me and I know she'll be an awesome home. Tons of photos of all the kittens are on facebook if anyone wants to see. ^^"

<br><br><u>Ability Scores:</u><br>
<b>Strength-</b>14<br>
<b>Dexterity-</b>14<br>
<b>Constitution-</b>12<br>
<b>Intelligence-</b>15<br>
<b>Wisdom-</b>14<br>
<b>Charisma-</b>13
<br><br><u>Alignment:</u><br><b>True Neutral</b> A true neutral character does what seems to be a good idea. He doesn't feel strongly one way or the other when it comes to good vs. evil or law vs. chaos. Most true neutral characters exhibit a lack of conviction or bias rather than a commitment to neutrality. Such a character thinks of good as better than evil after all, he would rather have good neighbors and rulers than evil ones. Still, he's not personally committed to upholding good in any abstract or universal way. Some true neutral characters, on the other hand, commit themselves philosophically to neutrality. They see good, evil, law, and chaos as prejudices and dangerous extremes. They advocate the middle way of neutrality as the best, most balanced road in the long run. True neutral is the best alignment you can be because it means you act naturally, without prejudice or compulsion. However, true neutral can be a dangerous alignment because it represents apathy, indifference, and a lack of conviction.<br>
<br><u>Race:</u><br><b>Humans</b> are the most adaptable of the common races. Short generations and a penchant for migration and conquest have made them physically diverse as well. Humans are often unorthodox in their dress, sporting unusual hairstyles, fanciful clothes, tattoos, and the like.
<br><br><u>Class:</u><br><b>Druids</b> gain power not by ruling nature but by being at one with it. They hate the unnatural, including aberrations or undead, and destroy them where possible. Druids receive divine spells from nature, not the gods, and can gain an array of powers as they gain experience, including the ability to take the shapes of animals. The weapons and armor of a druid are restricted by their traditional oaths, not simply training. A druid's Wisdom score should be high, as this determines the maximum spell level that they can cast.

"event","Sorry to worry ya'll.
Thanks for the concern. I'm fine, just very frusterated. MJ, I'm sure you know the feeling too. Too many responsibilities like school and such, at the expense of freedom, and time to actually relax and enjoy life a little. I just want OUT of the rules of society that force us to go to school every morning, work every afternoon, and not have any free time to even scream  about it all. As I walked to class this morning, I saw the blue sky behind the building and I almost just kept walking. It's not right that college students get so stressed they have a pre-midlife crisis and want to do something crazy just to break from it all.
I'm tired of having no money, no time, and no life. The only full free day I ever have is Sunday,(I either have work or school or both every other day) and I just end up cleaning all day Sunday because I couldn't get it done all week, but I'll go crazy if I just leave it a wreck.
Sorry to whine. I'm just... mentally exhausted.

Anyone else feel too responsible and rule abiding for their own good?"

-&gt; Krissy after days of cleaning and sorting. Work tomorrow will be good for me... even if I won't be done reorganizing my appartment yet.

I've decided the livingroom will be in black/white and blue with dragon/kanji/ and tribal (Like Tribal tatto design) elements. It'll work. Trust me. ^^; 
The kitchen shall be in cobalt and other blues, 
The bathroom and my bedroom are Jungle.
The spare room will be whatever is left over. 

I have tons more work to do, and though it's tiring, I have a vision of the end result and I can't wait to show everyone.


NOTE TO JILL
What days are you free and what could I bribe you with for some sorting/trashing help?

David and Marlena are getting married the 20th. David is moving to Florida to work for Kennedy Space Center, in Melbourne, and hour or so from most of the amusement parks, meaning family visits will be very fun.DAvid is leaving practically EVERYTHING here too since he is driving down in two medium sized cars.
 
Starting the first of June I will be living on my own. I'm staying at Castlewood, just due to ease, and it's hard to find a non-scary appartment in Oak Ridge that is cheap and allows pets and is only single bedroom. I hope to have a ""garage"" sale for some of the stuff he leaves behind, or maybe I'll just sell it on e-bay. ^^;

Last but very important: While canceling/switching phone, internet, utilities etc. it came to a choice between keeping phone, or keeping internet. I chose internet. So, after the 31st I will only have a cell phone. Hopefully, this will force me to change habits and actually charge the sucker. Also, I won't really be available to just talk till after 9:00pm or weekends (free!) since I'm still under my parents cell service. BUT I will most likely be on IM and stuff online. &lt;3"

I may be going to see the newest Cirque du Soleil show in Quebec AND Meet someone in it over my birthday vacation to New Hampshire! My parents are friends with someone who's son is in it and were invited, but they turned it down since I was going to be up there... ='( Mom just now asked me if I would want to go and I told her that ""Of COURSE I WOULD!!!"" So they are going to contact their freinds and see if they still can go. I'd arrive in NH, then we would drive up to Quebec with them and friends to see the show, meet the son in it. I would be sooo nervous with so many new people and places, but it would be worth it! I hope we still can...

And for those who don't know what Cirque du Soleil is... it's an amazing acrobatic show that tours around the US and Canada, they are incredible! Here is one act from one of their old shows.

"event","Told my brother I wanted to move out in april if any way possible. he told me it was stupid and I would be ""throwing away money"" I told him I didn't want to live with him and his new bride. He re-iterated it was stupid and I would be wasting money AND he couldn't afford this place himself. My answer ""yeah, but you could afford a single bedroom appt too. If I'm thinking aboutdoing it certainly you COULD. HE reiterates it's a waste of money for him and me and says he can't support he and marlena both here. I tell him to move out, and that ""You shouldn't get married if you can't support yourself and your spouse.""&nbsp;

He's not speaking to me now.

Thing is though, he plans on moving out too most likely in June when he gets a new job. He doesn't know which STATE he will even be in. He SAYS he'll give me plenty of warning before he moves to wherever the hell. I told him I can wait till June, but I don't want to live with him and his new bride.&nbsp;
Is it so odd that if I can in any way afford it I want my own place. I don't care how small it is. I just want something my own. No more bitching about whos job what is, or who made what mess. Mine, all my messes, all my responsibility, and I could actually build my own credit. currently the appartment and all bills I'm helping to pay are under Davids name. It's my good credit history too...

Am I just being stubborn? Is it wrong to want my own place as long as I can still save for college?&nbsp;"

Possible Names so far:
Gaia -- also called Gaea or Ge - was the Greek goddess of the earth. In Hesiod, Gaia came into existence after Chaos and produced the sky, mountains and sea. With the sky Ouranus, Gaia was the mother of the Titans, Cyclops, and Hecatoncheires. With Pontus, Gaia was the mother of Nereus, Thaumas, Phorcys, Ceto, and Eurybia. In Homer, Gaia is invoked for oaths. Tellus is the Roman equivalent of Gaia.

Kiri -it sounds pretty

Katai - Stubborn

This game even has towns that you can take over by buying in game stocks in them. Then you get money when people come use your market etc. It's really cool.

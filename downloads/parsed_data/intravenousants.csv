Really? You weren't saying that but you're willing to stridently defend the point, retroactively, in spite of your obvious lack of personal investment or even belief in it (Since you didn't say or intend to say it in the first place, why would you passive-aggressively assert it now?)

"event","I recently watched an interview with Bill Hicks.

Something in there really made me think. He mentioned that trying to tailor his beliefs and voice to his audience, having the audacity to say things specifically to entertain them, etc. Was basically condescension. 

It never occurred to me to look at it this way, though I've always felt dishonesty insults the intelligence of its target.

Either way, I'm seeing how this concisely expressed idea applies to almost every area of my life. I think it can be seen as both the backbone of my strong relationships and the culling-catalyst of the weaker ones...

When on my LJ-writing-community, however, I see repeated instances where one critiquer will post as some sort of referee, calling for positive input, regardless of if there's any basis for it... This is also a common requirement in all of my creative writing classes and workshops.

I do not want people to have to force praise from between their teeth for me...

Why does everyone expect this?
What the fuck?

Everything in life has edges and no one is fucking special. Deal with it, get cut, or give up.

If you can't survive serious critique, the world has likely lost nothing special."

Answers to Walking Pneumonia's questions:
<lj-cut>
<i>1. Why do you write?</i> At this point in my life, it's honestly something I love. As a child books were things I always wanted to imitate... Including a few months spent narrating my life in the first person.

But the reason I've decided to write professionally actually brings a story from a point in time when I was studying Biochemistry, and a friend of mine noticed that every morning, I wrote poetry. He asked me what I really wanted to do, and about 3 months later, I dropped my course of study for my current one.

2. <i>List your top 5 female authors, and which titles are your favorites.</i> This is actually a very difficult question for me to answer. It's even recently come up in conversation. I don't really ever read female authors. Not for any inherent misogyny, but because my tastes tend to lead me to related authors, all of whom are male...

I do enjoy Kathy Acker, though at least what I have read. And I recall liking Silas Marner.

3. <i>If you had to eat one meal for the rest of your life, what would it be and why? </i> Uhm, the rice-paper-covered spring rolls you get at Vietnamese places with peanut and sirarcha sauce, because they are spicy, sweet and full of tofu and lovely veggies.

4. <i>Do you plan to live in new mexico for the rest of your life? If so, why? If not, where else would you like to live?</i> No. I find myself consistently disappointed in living here, until I see one of my many amazing friends.

I intend to move to New York City C.O. The squishy ent.

5. <i>What plan (if any) do you have in place in the event of a zombie apocalypse?</i> To change my answer to number 3 so that it reads ""Brains""

"event","""i understand your concerns sir, but i honestly think that with the right spin on these events we could have a marketing goldmine on our hands. a marketing goldmine mined by unhappy suicidal teens. We only need an ""edgy"" snow white to seal the deal.""

""true... we could always release it under miramax though...?""

""hmm...get me the script monkeys""

i couldn't understand why they found this so-called epidemic so extraordinary.
The aspiring young college student might apply his newly acquired knowledge of semiotics to the situation and conclude that is was something to do with the commoditized fetishization or the rampant semulacra of the theme park that was creating such a ghastly situation. However, there is a much simpler answer. It is not Disneyland itself causing the suicides, though i will say in all fairness that the garishness of The Magic Kingdom alone is enough to make anyone not mesmorized by the brainwashing ray they zap you with at the gate wretch their guts out.
No. it's getting there that makes you crazy.
i found myself recalling my first trip to Disney World, a memory that i had repressed until the bodies began accumulating behind Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.
i was 8 yrs old. it was my mother, her girlfriend Angel, and her two nephews, two adolescent white gangster boys from shelbyville indiana who wore blue handkerchiefs in their back pockets and called their mom Godmother. i was trapped in the back of an el camino with a camper shell on top with these asshats for 23 hours from Indiana to Florida and back.
They brought a boom box with one mix tape in it. It had Too Short on one side and Snoop Dogg on the other. At 8 years old i knew all the words to Blow Job Betty. That...is fucked up. i never recovered.






""i KNOW AUTOEROTIC ASPHYXIATION ISN'T SUICIDE! but would YOU want people to know your 15 year old son died while wanking it to ""I Got No Strings To Tie Me Down"" with five marionettes tangled 'round his throat?""



(by the way, that is a true story about the el camino, i shit you not.)

""Okay people listen up, we have a new corporate slogan. Repeat after me:

WE WILL NOT TAKE CREATIVE CONTROL OVER A PIXAR MOVIE
WE WILL NOT TAKE CREATIVE CONTROL OVER A PIXAR MOVIE
WE WILL NOT TAKE CREATIVE CONTROL OVER A PIXAR MOVIE

Everyone got that? Okay. Now, as you know, Pixar has given us Toy Story 3... I have some ideas for how we should go about that..."""

1) The laws in place for conceal to carry.
2) Just how questionable privatized gun-control regulations are.
3) Remembering to specify when I'm not making an ad hominem attack (sorry <lj user=""ilcylic"">
4) The ways I filter media through biases I'm generally completely unaware of.

Yes, the use of human tragedy as political leverage, even for causes I can advocate, still disgusts me.

"event","it was during the lecture on dentures that reginald was struck with the notion that his dream could be realised...

maybe it was his catholic upbringing. the idea of his rigid shaft getting shredded between gleaming teeth, rows of them like sharks', it rushed the blood straight to his tumescent member. far more effective than those self-flagellating pussies in the monestaries. talk about penance.

maybe he'd seen The Wall too many times.

At any rate she still eluded him, shrouded in myth and mystery, the legendary Vagina Dentata.
When the LGBTQ community decided to reclaim the term queer to include all forms of so-called alternative sexualities, i'm not sure they bargained for this.

""We'll have to have those out,"" he said, but reached for my skirt.

	
""Your client, Mz. Said, awaits your expertise. She's in Chair 12,"" grinned Tereza; the gaunt attending seemed to relish this sadistic profession a little too much for even my perverted taste. I sighed, straightened my immaculate white coat, and headed toward the twelfth chair.

As I approached, I witnessed Mz. Said's yamn; her gaping maw, lined with unnaturally white teeth, made my pants feel unnaturally tight. Fuck. It was the second time this week that my definitive homosexuality had seemingly rebelled."

"event","""But these kids are alive! We can't throw them at the Planned Parenthood administrator, it doesn't send the right message!"" Marie shrieked in confused anger. She was never one to miss a good fetus chucking in the name of God's gift of Life, and the screaming toddlers were dangerously close to ruining her weekend fun.

She shut the door, leaned against it, and heaved a sigh of relief while thinking ""maybe abortion isn't such a bad idea.""

congradulations, none of your parents made a mistake, except yours... yes you with the turban...

""Mommy, what's that?""
""Oh dear lord, Billy, don't look at that.""
""But what is it?""
""It's a ruptured fetus! This is what would have happened to you if Mommy had decided to abort!""
[Billy cries]
[Mommy glares]

""Aww, there goes Jimmy, the child we didnt abort. Bobby wasnt so lucky.""

As I walk through the door and smell soiled children I remember why I helped out when my mother got her last abortion. I just think women should choose, you know? As soon as the seventeen year-old at the door judges me (""if looks could kill, I'd watch you die."") she tells me that the meeting is in the meeting room. I thank her and hope she doesn't tell me where it is so our existances in each other's worlds ends. The little brat next to the cage that keeps the world out (I mean, children inside) looks at me with her big blue innocent eyes and I feel sorry for myself. -what?- The eyes of a child are only filled with love if the child is filled with love. The eyes are filled with malice only if neglect endures instead of growth. I realize it's all a myth and walk on, sporting my badge just like everyone else."

""You're s'posed to scrub the cars down, Papi, not ME!,"" she squealed, peeling her wet white t-shirt off in mock disgust. Brent still couldn't understand how Susan's strategy to flash every passing car would help their animal friends, but after the third customer came to a screeching halt in the name of bouncy cleavage and that new car smell, he learned to quietly accept this unethical tactic. Business was business, after all, and sex does sell.

""I knew cars turned me on, but I never thought I'd enjoy washing them so much"", glancing down he realized that his loins were even more excited than his mind, and was thankful his swimming trunks made things less obvious. He didn't want his coworkers to think he felt the same way about animals.

""it certainly is a neat gimmick, putting them all in those sexy little swimsuits""

""true, but it doesn't solve the problem that dogs and cats just don't know how to wash cars...""


i remember, with a lucidity that astounds me, the first thought that came to my mind at that point. ""christ. shit's gonna go down when PETA hears about this. fuckin 'a."" and then i blasted it right on his pretty face.

i grew up on a farm in central Indiana. i've seen some disconcerting shit. (interpret that literally or metaphorically).
until you've had your arm up to the goddamn shoulder in a cow's ass, you can't say a damn thing about the 'facts of life.'"

Is anyone in my area going to Ani-Magic, and if so, can you give me a ride?  I had a carpool set up until about a week ago, and that fell through, so I am searching for alternate options now.  If you can help me, let me know asap.  I can help pay for gas, too. ^^"

Thank you, Chris, for being feminine enough to empathize with Kim, and being masculine enough to explain things to me in a way that I could really grasp.

Sacrifice... rights... balance... fairness... emotional and physical intimacy... freedom... individuality... reason vs. emotion... All these and more weigh on my mind.

This entry is a bit more obtuse than most, but I really don't feel like typing out my whole thought process.  If you're interested in an explanation, ask me directly.

Yeah, I think that's it for now.

"event","...and there's a mass of heavy, twisted, cold metal in my stomach.

My ideals have clashed with reality in an ugly way, and once again I find that said ideals and beliefs have ended up hurting some friends, including the one that I care about most.

I haven't listened, and when I did, I interpreted it the way I wanted to hear it.

Yesterday, for the first time in more than a year, I truly wept: bitter, wracking sobs, from deep within me.

These beliefs have caused me and so many others such pain, I almost want to just give up on them...  Can I?  Should I?  Is it worth it to change myself that much?  Will the change be for better or worse?

I cry out for help from the icy water, from the consuming sand.  And though there are many who hear, and outstretch their hands, no one can help me."

"event","So Kim's gonna be in San Clemente this weekend.  Her mom is being difficult and not letting her drive the 30 miles to see me for part of the day.  And I can't get there on my own.  And there was much wailing and gnashing of teeth.

And then, just now, my mother comes in and offers to drive me there, and to pick me up later.  And I'm like O_O

It's made me think: despite all their issues (see many previous posts) my parents are still basially good people.  I think that lately I've been stereotyping them in my mind, and that's neither good for me nor fair for them.

No one is one-dimensional; everyone has motivations that they consider to be just and right.  And I, who have considered those of my parents, and diametrically disagree with them, and am not used to having them consider mine, am pleasantly surprised to see my mother understand how much I miss Kim, and want to see her.

I will have to make some small sacrifices (getting up early, not partying as much the night before like I planned, waiting around while they finish working), but she is worth it to me.  I pray that it does indeed work out."

However...

I dreamed I was driving around in a car with some friends from work.  We stopped at a gas station, and my mother was there for some reason.  She and I got into a fight over me hanging out with them (she thought they were ""hooligans"") and over pumping the gas (something about the money I was putting in).  I was yelling at her, and suddenly my father appeared (""Don't yell at your mother, young man!"") and attacked me.  I was so surprised that he knocked me down with the kick, but I got up and started fighting back.  Eventually I won (despite the fact that whenever I get into fights in dreams, I seem to be moving very slowly, no matter how hard I try, and my blows always land softly...).

At that point, my father turned into a little robot anime-style school girl and self-destructed.

I really don't know where that last part came from, but I think a ""Paging Dr. Freud"" is appropos for the rest"

So I took this yesterday and got 68.8%, but my browser crashed and I took it again today, and I'm lower by 5%.  o.O;;

So Kim and I hung out all weekend.  It was fun, but there was quite a bit less of certain physical activities than I would have liked, due to the fact of other people being around all the time, and her teeth still hurting from the dentist (damn them! *shakes fist*)  Still, it was a blast.

Friday we watched Chitty Chitty Bang Bang with my dad (it's his favorite movie, I kid you not), and he and Kim sang along with the song subtitles.  ^^;

Saturday was my birthday party (and my actual b-day), and Kim and I watched Earth Girl Arjuna (gift from Todd; cool, but kinda slow) until people showed up, then went to see X2 (fucking rocked).  Dad BBQed for us and we did co-op and deathmatch Halo, and then watched The 13th Warrior (one of my all-time faves).  OOoo, and Kevin and Brandon got me the whole first season of 24!  XD

Sunday we went with my dad's side of the family to a big brunch at El Torito and gorged ourselves.  We played DDR eXtreme later and I got myself the big TIE Bomber Lego set with some of my money.  XD  Yes, I still play with Legos.  And later that night we saw Phone Booth, which was quite good.

Thanks to everyone who came to my party on Saturday, I had a great time, and it was great hanging with you all!  *hugs everyone*"

Seriously, you have NO idea how ecstatic I am over this.  If people weren't sleeping below me, I'd be jumping up and down.  OK, true, the MK movies are not ""good"" movies that will stand the test of time.  But they're so much damn FUN to watch!  Also, you must give them credit for being the first (yes, the FIRST, before The Matrix) American movies to have extended, well-choreographed, well-filmed fight scenes, a lesson that a lot of movies now could learn.

Is it wrong for me to be more excited about this than I was over Attack of the Clones?

"event","I apologize for the length of this; I've forgotten the command for LJ cuts.  -_-;;  Anyway, onward...

For those of you who may not be aware of it, I work at Mervyn's, a department store that caters mainly to women aged 25-40.  I work primarily on the illustrious Truck Team, and our job is to unload the freight from the trailer, push it to the sales floor, and then backstock whatever's leftover.  I specialize in all things shoes, and I am pretty much in charge of the shoe stockroom.  And I must say, I'm damn good at it (though it doesn't take much and it's waaaaaaay beneath what I'm capable of, but hey, they pay me...  </ego>).

So about two months ago, we get a new Logistics Lead.  (""Logistics, (n) : handling an operation that involves providing labor and materials be supplied as needed; the aspect of military operations that deals with the procurement, distribution, maintenance, and replacement of materiel and personnel.""  The Truck Team falls under the venue of Logistics.)  His name is Jason, and I despise him.  We call him ""The Gerbil"", because he always has his head in someone's ass. XD  His personality is thus: he is as -- if not more -- arrogant than I am (he possibly even approaches <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/snark_hunter"">Devon</a> in sheer arrogance), but he's about half as smart, with the organizational skills of a mollusk, and the empathy of a starving pirhana.  On top of all that, he's energetic and cheerful, and tries to convince you that he likes you.

He does two things quite frequently that I cannot abide: he condescends/patronizes me, and he directly questions my competence at a job that I'd been doing for 8 months before he got there.

About four weeks ago, he relabelled all the shelves in the shoe stockroom (and JUST the shoe stockroom), without consulting me about how it should be done.  The way we have it is that every location on a shelf has a 9-digit alphanumeric sequence that describes, for any given item, what floor it's on, what stockroom it's in, what aisle and row it's on, what shelf it's on, and where on the shelf it is.  For example, if the last two digits are ""14"", then you know, without looking, that the item in question is on the first shelf from the bottom, in the fourth slot from the left.  If it's ""46"", fourth shelf from the bottom, sixth slot from the left.  The thing is that most shelves can't hold nine slots, so this means that you can go from 46 (or whatever the last slot number is on the fourth shelf) to 51 (next shelf up, first slot).  Make sense?  Good.

Jason took all those labels off, and made the numbers sequential.  This means that the last two numbers, instead of indicating shelf number and position, are MEANINGLESS.  Depending on how many slots you have on a shelf, ""14"" could be halfway up, at the top corner, anywhere!  It's so fucking annoying to try to find stuff now!

Furthermore, Jason assumes that if it doesn't make sense to him (and having approximately the mental capacity of a saftey pin, lots of things don't) it won't make sense to anyone else.  He interrupted a task that I was doing today, started randomly restacking shoe boxes that I had taken the time to separate by gender, size and color, without asking me why they were stacked so.

There are other stories, but I'll save them for now.  I'll leave you with a final summary of his character: he has a key chain that reads (I shit you not) ""I'm not arrogant, I'm just better than you"".

I'm worried about <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/artgoddess7"">my darling</a>.  Arguing with her mom is like arguing with a five year old.  I don't know what's going on yet, so I'm gonna call her tonight.  I hope things will work out soon."

"event","Kim and I got to spend our first Easter together (hopefully the first of many...).  She got here yesterday morning and there was much hugging and kissing.  I hadn't seen her in about 2 weeks.  ;_;  I got fitted for my tuxedo for SB's wedding, and then she, Chris and I went to see Bulletproof Monk.  It was pretty good, but they didn't have enough fighting in it.  Then today we had our annual Easter Cookie Hunt, followed by a splendid repast at Grandma's house.  Spent the rest of the day lazing about cuddling with Kim, and then we had a very nice (and surprisingly inexpensive) dinner at Acapulco.  She just dropped me off and left for her house, and left me a very cute note on my take-out box.  *goosh*  Thank you, darling!

A rather close and well-loved friend and I have been fighting this week, and that's made me very sad.

There's SO much stuff going on in the next five weeks.  In rough order, they are: Mom's birthday, Elise's birthday, my birthday/Michi's visit (hopefully), Randy's birthday/Kim's and my one-year anniversary, Kim's birthday, Chris' bachelor party, and then Chris and SB's wedding.  And sometime in May I'm hoping to get out to the Corona Ren Faire.  *phew*  It's gonna be a busy few weeks.  @_@"

"event","I'm stopping playing Diablo II for a while.  There's no point anymore.  Unfortunately, this is not because I have attained my lofty goal of collecting every Unique (gold, Kim) and Set (green, dear) item in the game.  No.  To summarize, I quote the illustrious <a href=""http://www.diabloii.net/"">Diabloii.net</a>:

""We've had a lot of reports of a new duping technique that's been released this weekend, and is being massively-exploited.""

That is the under-fucking-statment of the year.  When I logged on tonight, it was... a travesty.  The trading economy has been shot completely to hell, spit on, and had its mother insulted.  There is no currency (the item used as high-end currency, the Stone of Jordan has been duped to the point where it has no value anymore), and nothing worth trading for (all the other items have been duped to the point where people are literally giving away stuff that people would have traded entire accounts for five days ago).  The only things left in short supply are hacked uber-godly items.  Guess who made them?  That's right, kids, the same people who created the duping program.  See the idea here?  Level the playing field by making everything available to everyone, and then offer something that no one has.  Makes perfect business sense.  And yes, these people are making _real_ money off of this.  Said duped uber-items are selling for hundreds of US dollars on E-bay.  The selfishness and heartlessness of these people staggers me.  To have the gall to comptletely and totally ruin a great game for the sake of one's one monetary game wobbles my mind.  I literally cannot comprehend the type of mindset necessary to do this.  I am baffled, disgusted, saddened, disappointed and REALLY pissed-off all at once.

Yes, I'm getting worked up over a video game.  But I put my fucking time and effort into D2, and that makes it valuable to me.  If I ever meet the person(s) who did this, I would enjoy punching them in the throat.  Hard.  With the middle knuckle extended."

"event","It came to me quite clearly in the shower today (The Stephen Theorem: 80% of all good ideas come while you're in the bathroom) that I am unsatisfied with my life as it is right now.  I don't know how, or in what way yet.  I just feel a vague incompleteness about myself, and it's bothering me.  I don't know what I need to do next, but I think it's time to start considering it seriously, whatever it may be.

Also, in a series of e-mails about changes, Todd -- who is one of my closest, longest, and best friends -- said some stuff that eerily echoed what my mother said a number of days ago.  Coming from her, I'm inclined to dismiss most of them.  Coming from Todd, on the other hand... well, it makes me think about them more carefully.  I'm going to put a fairly large quote here, both for myself that I don't lose it and can spend time reading over it and thinking on it, and for anyone who reads this, so that if you're so inclined, you can comment on it's insight and veracity or lack thereof.

""Hmmmmmmmm..... Well, I'll tell you, but keep in mind it's much easier to spot negatives than positives.  Also remember that I'm not saying any of this to be hurtful.. #1, you seem to be a lot less courteous and respectful than you used to be. I've noticed this in a few ways. You never used to just take off and do your own thing when you invited me (or the guys) over.  You used to be much better at returning calls and replying to emails.  You're not as grateful sometimes. I'm sure there are times when I haven't thanked you or your father for having me over to dinner, but whether I remember to say it or not, I'm always very grateful. You seem a little more self-centered now (this I blame on Laura). I can remember one point (quite long ago now) when I drove to anime expo and waited FOREVER while you and the rest of them were doing masquerade which was supposed to be over fairly quickly and I waited and waited while you guys decided to stay and watch the whole thing, and the sole reason I didn't leave was because I was your ride home. Granted that was a LONG time ago now, and that doesn't bother me anymore, I'm just stating it as an example of when I noticed this starting. #2 You do something now, which I think is pretty disrespectful (again, I know this isn't intentional). When you're with Kim, you two tend to make out and just hang on each other constantly.. this is disrespectful because no one wants to see/hear you making out.  That's why I think you need a more concrete separation of friend time and girlfriend time. If it were just a quick kiss and didn't happen frequently, I wouldn't even say anything. I will say though, that if I had a girlfriend, I'd never make out with her while I was hanging with friends. #3 You seem to have a lot less drive to do anything. This, I don't blame on Laura or Kim or anyone. You just wanted to know what changes I saw. Have you written anything lately? Ya know, things like that.. You don't seem to have any goals now, and that hurts me as a friend, to see one of my friends (in essence) giving up. I saw Scott give up his life because he got Hannah pregnant. I don't want to see any of my other friends have to give up their goals and dreams.. #4 has basically already been stated. You don't seem to care about hanging with your OC friends any more. More than that though, you don't seem to really TALK to any of us any more. Not just hanging out, but talking. I feel like I know more about what's happening in Brandon's life than I do yours. You used to actually talk about life once in a while. How you used to have a big crush on (I think it was Allison?) when I met you. And I told you stuff that was going on in my life. Basically, things that embody friendship..  ""

I should say here that I mostly agree with him on #4; I think I have been neglecting my OC friends in favor of Kim and my Riverside friends.  *sighs*  Why can't they all be in one place....?  I need to work on my time-management."

"event","Well, in some sad news, <a href=""http://www.kingsofchaos.com"">Kings of Chaos</a> is down for the forseeable future.  *sighs*  Alas.  I was building a pretty good army, too.

Well, V-day was not as much fun for me as I'd hoped, for many reasons.  First, Daredevil kinda sucked (Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner CANNOT fight, no matter how much funky camera work they use to try to cover it up), and <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/artgoddess7"">Kim</a> got sick with a bladder infection.  Couple that with the fact that I opted to spend the day with her instead of the annual Emotional Blackmail Day Protest Party, and you get a slightly unhappy Stephen-chan.

*shakes his head* It really is unfortunate that I had to make that decision in the first place.  On the one hand, I do think that V-day is over-commercialized, and has become very obligatory, (<i>especially</i> for the guy).  On the proverbial other hand, I think that having a special day to celebrate love and friendship with one's significant other is a fine idea, and I personally like doing nice things for people.  

So what happens when your g/f wants to spend the day with you (and I'd made plans with her weeks before to go see Daredevil on opening day (V-day), 'cuz I was excited about it), and on the same day your good friends throw a party protesting the existance of V-day, to which you had promised to bring French lesbian pr0n (I'm not joking) for the edificaiton of all?  The answer is that somebody is going to end the day unhappy.  In addition, Kim (as she said to me) was opposed to going for three reasons: 1) She didn't like the idea behind the party, 2) She was sick, and 3) she didn't want to spend the hour and a half necessary driving time to get there, when she'd already driven more than that to come visit me.  (I should note here that Kim got very sick that evening, and was pretty miserable at my house--it would have been worse for her at a party.)  Considering that, and the fact that I made plans with her first, I chose to spend the day with her.

In retrospect, I still don't see a ""good"" solution; like I said, someone was gonna end up unhappy.  If I'd gone to the party, then I'd be bummed that Kim was miserable, and feel bad that I backed out on my plans with her.  If I didn't, I'd be bummed that I was missing out on a good party, and my friends would be disappointed that I backed out on my plans with them, in addition to being afraid of seeming pussy-whipped.

Eventually, though I opted to stay with Kim for the day.  Can't change that, and don't know that I would, given the choice.  I don't think things would have been much better had I chosen differently.  I just hope that I haven't offended and/or let down too many people.  If I have, then please take it up with me.

First the fun stuff.  I recently started playing <a href=""http://www.kingsofchaos.com"">Kings of Chaos</a>, an online text-based war game.  Basically, you start an army, either by yourself or by being recruited by someone, and you build it up with soldiers, money and equipment.  It's a pretty fun game for about 20-30 minutes at a time.  ^_^  Fun thing is, anyone who clicks on your link adds a soldier to your army, even if they don't join.  So click away at the link-age I provide!  Join my army, too!  Here's <a href=""http://www.kingsofchaos.com/page.php?id=261396"">me</a>, my officer <a href=""http://www.kingsofchaos.com/page.php?id=277327"">Alluring Sinner</a>, my officer <a href=""http://www.kingsofchaos.com/page.php?id=283527"">Draconisflare</a>, my officer <a href=""http://www.kingsofchaos.com/page.php?id=283598"">Nightfall</a>, and my commander, <a href=""http://www.ee.ucr.edu/~jkent/mylink.html"">Ibiwan</a>.  <a href=""http://www.kingsofchaos.com/page.php?id=261396"">Join me</a>!  You know you want to...

Now on to heavier matters...
I recently got into (yet another) fight with my mother.  This one had the added bonus of being about EXACTLY THE SAME STUFF AS BEFORE.  Oh frabjous day, calloo, callay...  She's Worried(tm) that:
1a. I spend too much time online.
1b. I don't get out enough.
1c. The people that I spend time with online aren't Real Friends.
2.  I don't spend enough time with my family (her, Randy, Sarah Beth and Chris)
3.  I don't clean up after myself.
4a. I'm too into porn.
4b. I've got a twisted/unhealthy view on sex/sexuality.
5a. I've changed for the worse since graduated from college.
5b. My college/Riverside friends are a negative influence on me.

I believe that covers what was discussed.  First, though, I'm grateful that she was direct about her concerns, as it made it easy for me to answer her.  Let's hear Stephen's responses, point by point.

1a and 1b. Well, seeing as how I don't have a car, it's logistically difficult for me to get ANYWHERE (this includes work), and I really prefer not to ask to borrow vehicles whenever possible.  It's a big responsibility on my part, driving someone else's car, and I shudder to think what the repercussions would be were I to get into an accident while driving SB's Saturn.  That aside, gas is getting bloody fucking expensive again, and my local friends work and/or go to school as well.  However, the real point is that in the evenings, when I get home from work, I don't want to go anywhere.  I want to sit down, take off my shoes and relax.  I relax by playing Diablo, by chatting and role-playing with my friends, by reading <a href=""http://www.penny-arcade.com"">Penny Arcade</a>, and shit like that.  She, Randy, Chris and SB relax by watching TV and playing computer games too.  She suggested taking a class at Golden West College (the local JC).  While this does have some merit (I've been wanting to get back into martial arts, and they have a decent Shoto-kan program), again, there are logistical problems of getting there, I haven't found anything I really want to study now, and, frankly, I'm still burned out on school from 19 straight years of it up until graduation.  I expect that my attitude towards study will change in time, but it's not what I want right now.  Isn't that what's important?  I kinda thought so.  Furthermore, what about all the time I spend in Riverside, and at Kim's house and at Dad's house?  If I've got more than a day off in a row, I'm gone from this place.  Even on single days off, 50% of the time I'm not here.  

1c. I was gravely insulted at this comment.  You, most of you who are reading this, are my true and dear friends.  If I were any of you, I'd be insulted too.  To think that all the time we've spent together -- staying up late talking about sex and video games and philosophy, going to cons, soaking in jacuzzis, stuck in traffic, role-playing -- means diddlyshit to my mother saddens and injures me.  You all know me better than 99.99% of the people I went to school with.  I told my mother directly how insulted I was (and still am!), and she seemed a bit surprised by my vehemence.  I can't believe she had the audacity to say that; after all, she met her current husband online, and she knows that that's how I met Laura as well!  She should understand the value of online friendships, but it seems that either she does not, or that mine do not qualify.

2. There is some truth here.  However, this is a conscious choice.  I choose not to spend time with them because 90% of the time, no one's doing anything I'm interested in.  In the evenings after I get back from work, Mom and Randy watch TV for a while and walk the dog and go to bed.  SB and Chris sequester themselves in their room, generally to the TV's company as well.  I HATE television, 24 and (sometimes) Friends aside.  I view it as a waste of my time.  They watch movies, too, but it's almost always something I've seen 900 times before or something my mother picked out (read: chick flick or musical).  On the few times when the do something I like, I'm there, like when we saw Signs (good flick) recently.

3. This is true, and I'll freely admit this.  I'm absent-minded, and I forget to clean up my dishes and such here.  I have a responsibility to clean up after myself, living in another's house, and I need to work on this.

4a and 4b. Ah, porn.  The flash flood that sweeps away the bridge of understanding between adults and adolescents.  Apparently, one of porn's biggest problems is that it Opens You Up To Experiences That You Don't Need To Know About(tm).  I dunno.  Frankly, I think I would have probably thought of anal sex, threesomes and tit-fucking on my own without any porn to show me the way.  Yes, I spend a fair amount of time each day with my porn collection.  How much?  Does it matter?  As long as it doesn't interfere with my responsibilities (getting to work,  chores, etc.) I think it's my business.  Let me put it this way: I have a fairly high libido.  Kim can't be around all the time.  Figure the rest out.  As for giving me a twisted and unhealthy (her words) view on sex...  I was only <i>slightly</i> less insulted than I was about the They Aren't Real Friends comment.  Well, here's what I said to her: ""You go ahead and ask <i>any</i> of the girls I've been physically intimate with about my attitudes on sex, and see what they say.""  Have I EVER mistreated my bed partners in a sexual way?  Have I EVER forced anything on anyone, or EVER even had any malicious intent?  You ask them, mom.  Go ahead.  What will their opinions be on my sexual attitudes? Loose, even promiscuous?  Sure, I can see that.  Likes sex too much?  Some might think that.  But TWISTED?  She made it sound like I was six seconds away from going out and raping the next dog-walker to jog past her house.

5a and 5b.  Yes, I've changed.  I'm a very, very different person than I was 2.5 years ago (I consider Anime Expo 2000 one of the major defining moments in my life), or even a year ago (another personality-defining process: getting over an ex).  However, I consider virtually all changes to be positive.  I consider myself more self-confident, more in touch with who I'm most comfortable being, more myself.  It's as if I found a Stephen-shaped hole, and am slowly settling into it, with those big moments mentioned above being whacks from a hammer held by God, so to speak.  Religion aside, I feel like <i>myself</i>, and I feel comfortable being myself.  I have largely my friends from Riverside and the various anime conventions I've attended to thank for this, for showing me that it was acceptable (even desirable!) to behave, think and feel in certain ways, and then encouraging and rewarding me  when I did so.  My mother called my self-confidence self-absorption.  Am I?  That's difficult for me to say, being a very subjective observer.  Opinions are welcome.  She aske me if I still considered myself a Christian.  I do indeed.  I no longer attend church, because it bores me.  I do things that many Christians would have heart attacks over.  In my view of the religion, I don't do anything that's contrary.  If I thought it was, I wouldn't do it, it's that simple.  I hit my mom with the whole fact about the Bible not prohibiting pre-marital sex and she was stunned.  That was fun.  ^_^

We talked quite a bit about sex, much to her dismay (""I can't believe I'm talking to you about this!"" was her comment, I believe), and I found out that BIG FUCKING SURPRISE our views on it differ quite a bit.  She didn't come out and say it (and I very well could be wrong here), but I got the distinct impression that she was unhappy with the fact that I wasn't planning on getting married any time soon.  Why?  I don't know.  Just a feeling I got.  I also got the first insight ever into a major reason behind my parents' divorce, but that's a bit sensitive to go into here.  Ask me if you're curious.

What really irks me is that I've been over this shit half a dozen times before, both with my mom and my dad.  I was hoping and praying that once I got a job that my personal life would be left alone but alas, this is not the case.  Yes, I realize that they are both Concerned Parents(tm) and are Worried About My Son(tm).  But while I appreciate the care, I don't like being told how to run my life or in what to believe, which was the feeling I was getting here.  Yes, they have a duty to protect their child, but from harm, not experience, and even the harm aspect only goes so far!  When your kid gets proverbially thrown from the proverbial horse, you ask if he's alright, offer to help him up, maybe flutter about a little, and then respect his decision if he wants to get back on or stay off.  What you don't do is forbid him from riding the damn thing in the first place.  Now, don't read into this that I hate my parents.  I'm very very angry with them over certain specific issues, but I do still love them.  I choose to show it less now, because of that anger.  However, I think they did a pretty good job overall in raising me, and I'm very very thankful for the home that I had for the first 18 years of my life.

Perhaps it's time to start looking for a better job (and that might mean attending some classes) so that I can work faster towards my financial independence.  Once I have that, the next time a Concerned Parent(tm) tells me that s/he is Worried About My Son(tm), I have the ability to say ""Y'know, that's really nice, and I appreciate the concern, but it's my business, and for now, just fuck off.""  Yeah, that's harsh.  But I'm pretty pissed over this, in case you couldn't tell.

It is now 6:30am, and I've been up for 21 hours.  The third topic will have to wait for another entry.

"event","So Kim kidnapped me for several days.  'Twas fun.  Friday, I fell asleep while cuddling with her and had the most interesting dream:

I dreamed I was working, and that I was walking from the front of the store to the back, and there was only one hallway that connected them.  In my dream, it was a tradition, when someone was walking this hallway, to sort of accost them and hold them back, and make a game out of it.  But, it had to be someone of the opposite gender.  So as I was walking through here, I was set upon by three female employees.  I remember needing to be somewhere urgently, so I was fighting with them to let me through.  It quickly changed from a game to a real fighting brawl, and I the girls scratched and wounded me pretty bad.

Fortunately, at that moment, my two friends Devon and Jeremy showed up on the other side of the hall and joined in the fray, and together, the three of us won the fight.  Then my boss appeared, and he was reprimanding me, Devon and Jeremy for letting the fight get out of hand.  During this, I felt a sharp pain on my neck.  I turned and Devon was standing behind me.

""What are you doing?"" I said.
""Those girls got you pretty bad on your neck,"" he replied.  ""I'm putting ice on it.

Then pain on my right shoulder; Jeremy was there.
""What are you doing?""
""They scratched your shoulder up,"" he answered.  ""I'm putting ice on it.""

Then my gaze travelled from my shoulder, down my arm to my forearm.  I gasped and started hyperventilating.  My forearm was a hideous mess.  There were three deep rents in my arm, and the skin was turning black, and blood had dried and crusted on it.  Jeremy started to bandage my arm up, but I wouldn't let him, because I knew that the dead skin on top had to come off.  I got my fingers inside one of the slashes and started pulling long chunks of black, blood-encrusted skin off of my arm.  I stopped when I realized that _all_ of the skin was dead and it was all coming off and I could see my bone and muscle underneath.

""Holy shit,"" I whispered in utter horror.

Kim shook me awake at this point (thank you, Kim!), because I was hyperventilating in real life as well.  I clung to her, and told her what I dreamed.  She made the following observations:

1. I feel physical sensations in dreams (in this case, intense pain).
2. The women were trying to keep me from something I needed to do.
3. The women attacked me and deeply wounded me.
4. My friends (in particular, male friends who have also been hurt by women in the past) came to save me.
5. I and my friends got into trouble, not the women.
6. My friends tried to heal my injuries.
7. The women left me with old wounds that had not healed -- they were just caked over with dead skin and blood.
8. I tried to get rid of the old injuries not by bandaging them, but by opening them up again, but I stopped because of the pain and grusomeness of the wound.

Paging Dr. Freud....

A clearer metaphor could not be made about me and my relationships with women.  All the people that have deeply hurt me in my life have been female, and my friends have always been there to help me recover.  I thought that some of these old wounds had healed by now, but, obviously, such is not the case.

An interesting dream, ne?  I'm really glad that Kim was there upon awaking.

In other news, I'm chocolate.  o_O; Description is accurate, though.  :-D

Is it worth dealing with all of that simply to remain true to myself, and to behave how I wish others would behave towards me?

Or should I stifle and kill those urges, and only be affectionate with the person with whom I'm romantically involved?

And be just like everyone expects."

"event","Well, despite all odds (meteors, wild horses, earthquakes, floods, ninjas, and the lack of transportation), I made it to Ani-Magic.  I didn't know I was going for sure until 8pm Friday night, and I was only able to stay for Saturday, but it was worth it.  I borrowed my grandmother's van (the Make-Out Machine, as Van dubbed it) and drove to see Kim at 11pm that evening.  She's sick, so we didn't do much but talk, but it was great to see her again.  I slept for about 2 hours at her house and got up at 6am to drive to Lizzy's house to meet her and Kurara/Laura.  We got to Ani-Magic at around 10:30 and spent 2 hours in line to get registered (AX this is _not_)  Once I got in, it took me about 10 minutes to find Van, who was dressed as Zell (very weird to see her as... me...) and a few mintues after that I found Michi, and ran to glomp her.  She met me halfway  XD.  There was much hugging and I met her girlfriend Candice, who was dressed as Squall.  What with her, me, Van, Michi-as-Irvine and the half-dozen or so other FFVIII cosplayers around, we had a damn good group photo session.

The dealer's room was small, but I managed to find a sexy Pirotess wall scroll, and I bought two hentai DVDs  XD.  Candice was a bit short with me early in the day, but she got to like and trust me quite a lot later on.  I think the fact that I gave her a piggyback ride and ran around while pretending to be a chocobo and yelling ""WARK!"" very loudly helped.  I'm glad that she doesn't see me as a threat to her relationship with Michi anymore.

Ironically, though, she and Michi are having a lot of problems.  I won't relate those here, because, frankly, they are their own business, and not mine to tell anyone else.  But I got to spend some time with both of them individually, and that was nice.  I'm worried about them both, but a bit more about Candice; Michi seems to be a bit stronger in this case.

At one point while Candice and I were walking around trying to find Michi, I heard Candice say something from behind me very softly.  I didn't think she was talking to me, so I kept walking.  But I heard her again, and this time it was clear that she was saying my name.  I turned, and I saw her falling forward with her eyes closed.  I did catch her, which I'm very proud of (I've sorta always wanted to catch a fainting girl), and laid her out on the ground.  (A note for those of you wondering: when dealing with a fainted person, the thing to do is elevate their feet above their head to improve blood flow to the brain and heart.)  She woke up after about 10 seconds and was all right; I think the fainting was due to a combination of low blood sugar (she hadn't eaten in about 12 hours), the emotional stress of her relationship troubles that day, and her heart problems.

In any event, we found Michi shortly after that.  I, much to everyone's disappointment (Candice wanted to take me home to live in her closet ^^; ), had to leave then and I spent a bit of time saying goodbye to both of them, and giving some last advice and suggestions.  I really hope that they can work things out between them; it upsets me to see my friends upset and in pain.

Some other highlights of the day included; an impromtu dance session after the Fashion Show, during which I showed off my gymnastic prowess and got a high five from one of the other dancers; getting quite possibly the best compliment I've ever gotten on my costume (a guy, after I posed for his picture simply told me with a big grin ""Fuckin' A!""); doing flips on the Fashion Show stage to the applause of the audience; doing Zell/Zell pics with Van; doing Zell/Irvine pics with Michi; walking around like the biggest pimp in the world with Michi and Candice on my arms as two scantily-clad Sailor Senshi; and getting teased with a hot dog by a mean Squall.

All in all, I had a blast.  I only wish I could have stayed longer"

*yaaaaay....*

It's not a terribly exciting job, but it's a job.  I work at a Mervyn's nearby, in the stockroom.  Now, this does make use of some of my talents, namely, organization and logical thinking.  I am enjoying it quite a bit more than I have all of my other odd jobs I've had *coughArby'scough*.  This is due to a few key reasons:

1. I don't have to interact with the customers.
2. I don't have to interact with the customers.
3. Everyone else pretty much leaves me alone.
4. I don't have to interact with the customers.

Even though I'm on my feet for 8 hours, the time goes by quickly, and we get two 15-minute breaks, in addition to an hour for lunch.  There are downsides, of course.... I only get 6.15/hr, the job itself is tedious and unchallenging, and they seem to be scheduling me on weekends a lot, which they said they wouldn't.  Still.  I can't really complain.  It's money, and that is a neccesity right now.  I'm saving for a new computer, my own ISP (so I can get online whenever I want) and a car.  Oh yes, and then move out.  How I'll do all that on only 6.15/hr remains to be seen, but dammit, I'm working on it.  XD"

"event","Here's some good news... I've actually got a promising interview, where they liked me and everything.  I might be working within the next few weeks.  Provided that happens, Ani-Magic is a sure thing.  I had a rather blah trip to Vermont last week for my uncle's wedding.  Vermont is a lot of fun -- if you like trees.  Lots of them.  Trees trees trees trees trees.  If you don't like trees, then Vermont is interesting for about fourteen seconds, and then you realize that you'd much rather be in Southern California because while Vermont is very pretty (AND it has TONS of TREES!!) it's bloody humid, and eight-five degrees feels like a hundred, PLUS you feel sticky all the time 'cuz you're not sweating properly.  We also had some really bland food there (they apparently haven't discovered spices in Vermont or New Hampshire yet) and saw some cows.  The highlight of my trip was trying to teach my 16-year-old cousin Josue (pronounced JOSH-oo-uh) and his friend Jacob to play Heroes Unlimited.  A typical exchange follows:

Me: You have successfully kicked the door in.  What do you do next?
Josh: I sit down on the stairs and jack off. *grins as if he has said something witty or clever*
Me: *sigh*
Jacob: I look in the room.  What do I see?
Me: A desk, sofa, chairs, fake plant.  Typical office.
Jacob: What do I see with my INFRA-RED vision?
Me: The same thing.  You can't turn it off.  It's part of you power.  If you saw something with your IRV, then I'd tell you.  *calmly, despite the fact that this is the FOURTH time I've had to say this exact phrase*
Jacob: So, I don't see anything with my INFRA-RED vision?
Me: No. *holding back the urge to beat the piss out of him*
Josh: I shoot Jacob in the back. *again, he grins as if he has said something that is either relevant or amusing*
Me: *twitch*

The other fun part of the trip was that I missed Kim a lot.  And by ""fun"", I mean ""it gnawed at me the entire time and prevented me from really enjoying myself, even if I had done something that I liked"".  We've gotten relatively serious about dating, and I am enjoying my time with her immensely.  We had a great date on Saturday: rollerblading at the Dana Point marina, and a good lunch afterwards (crab cakes rule).  She spent the whole weekend at my house, from Thursday to Monday, and we had a great time.  We watched Evil Dead II and Army of Darkness together. XD  She loved them.

I miss all of my online friends; I miss talking to you all regularly.  Hopefully, this will change within a month or so when I have an actual income.

"event","A quick update on stuff.

1. My mother has since taken my father's side of things and has pretty much banned me from the 'net at her house, as well.

2. My father's position is that the 'net is keeping me from being as productive as I could be in my job search.  He says that I'm very unmotivated.

3. While my parents do have a point (I'm not looking as hard as I suppose I could be), and I can kinda see where they're coming from, the way to get me to look harder is not by killing the things I enjoy most.  In all fairness, I don't know what will get me to look harder, but it sure as hell isn't this.  What, exactly, do they expect me to learn from this?

4. I've spent the majority of the last week in Riverside because the only way I can handle my anger right now is to be away from my parents.  I thank God for my friends here.  They all want me to move back here and get a job in this area.

5. On the plus side, we have Diablo II: Expansion installed on 3 computers here, so I've had fun with that.

6. I have two interviews coming up on Wednesday.  Pray to whatever deity you believe in to intercede on my behalf.  I NEED a job.

7. At least I still have a house to live in, and food to eat.  I am thankful for that.

And now, some tests.

"event","By now, most of you know that I'm dating a girl named Kim, and have been for a month.  We're fairly physical, and when she comes to spend the night she sleeps with me in my bed, but aren't having sex (by mutual decision).  Sounds fine to everyone right?

Wrong.

Tonight Kim and I were watching Goldenboy and I get up to go check my e-mail between episodes.  Poor Kim was so exhausted from yesterday's party that she was asleep on the couch within five minutes.  I'm happily clicking away when my father comes up to me and informs me that Kim is no longer allowed to sleep with me anymore.  I argued with him for a few minutes, and the reason basically comes down to ""I don't think it's appropriate [his word of choice], and it's my house, so deal with it.""  Now, I can give all sorts of reasons why my sex life is none of his business and how it's not hurting anyone, but when he (or pretty much anyone else) takes that particular point of view, there's nothing more that one can do to change his mind.  Especially when he's correct that it _is_ his house and since I _am_ financially dependent on him, I must abide by his rules.  In all fairness, he's pretty open to stuff, but when it comes to my sex life, he is frustratingly close-minded.  Not even ""wrong"", but ""not appropriate""!

I fucking need my own place."

"event","Happy Memorial Day everyone.  We're having a barbeque here (apparently, if you don't have 
BBQ on Memoreial Day, you are a KDCGHCN (Known Drug-Crazed God-Hating Communist Nazi) and should be shot.  Or so says my father. o_0;   I'm pretty sure he's joking.  I'm looking forward to it, 'cept my sister's bringing along someone that I do not like very much at all.  Once again, I find myself in the position of seventh wheel; everyone else will be paired up.

At the end of the week, something exciting.  Kim and I hare holding a joint birthday party at my house.  Saturday (June 1st, '02), afternoonish.  If you're reading this, then you're invited.  Feel free to drop by!

Oh yes, the original reason I started writing this.  For those of you who are curious, the quote ""This is the way the world ends...."" comes from T.S. Eliot's ""The Hollow Men"".  If you're interested, you can read the poem here:

You should; it's a good bit of work.

(and yes, Marshall, it is from ""The Stand"" as well, but Stephen King was quoting Eliot.)"

"event","Well, as the saying goes, I've got some good news and some bad news.

Actually, I've got a fair bit of bad news.

I'd like to apologize to a lot of people for a convenient lie I've been telling for some time.  It's just that the truth is rather embarassing.  The real reason that my time online is so sporadic is only partly due to the crappy ISP that my dad gets.  The other part is that he, my father, has revoked my private internet access.  I can only log on when he is home.  There are two reasons for this.  One is that he thinks I spend too much time online and that my real life is suffering.  Of course it's suffering.  I have no job, no car, and only a few friends close by, who all work and/or go to school.  The internet is 80% of my life right now.  The second reason is that he saw me looking at hentai sites, and got very upset over this.  Now, to be fair, it is his computer, and he is paying for the ISP, so that gives him a certain authority over what he does and does not allow.  Still, he won't or can't see my side of things (I have a high libido, he has next to none, for example).  Pr0n = BAD!!!  *sigh*  I found out during our arguments that both porn and the internet (or, time spent on the internet by unknown parties) were some factors in causing his divorce from my mother, so I also think that he's projecting his or someone else's mistakes on to me, as parents are wont to do.  Anyway, this gives me anywhere from 0-3 hours per day to access the 'net.  Needless to say, I'm upset about that.

In retaliation, I've secretly installed AOL on the comp so that I can get online when he's not home, but that's an iffy business.  If I'm chatting with you during the daytime and suddenly disappear, chances are that my father has come home early and I need to get offline in zero time.  I apologize in advance.  I offically open the Get Zell Broadband Fund.  Donations will be appreciated.

Second bit of bad news isn't really bad, and I can't really talk about it either.  Suffice to say that I visited with my ex-g/f today and when she left I was feeling rather down.  Before you jump to conclusions, no one is mad or angry at anyone.  Among other things, I guess I'm still getting over her, and I'll never stop loving her, at least a little bit.  In addition, she was looking particularly attractive tonight.  The reason I'm writing this entry at 5:40am my time is that after she left, as tired as I was/am, I absolutely do not want to sleep right now.  ""To sleep,"" as Shakespeare says.  ""To sleep, perchance to dream....""

Time heals all wounds, particularly wounds of the spirit.  I wasn't as healed as I thought I was when it comes to love and romantic relationships.

Still, that brings me to the good news, which is that I'm dating again.  Her name is Kim, and she a God-given gift in my life right now.  I've known her for quite some time, going on three years, and all this time, we've had a mutual attraction to each other that we'd never admitted until a few weeks ago.  She's fun to be with, easy to talk to, funny, creative, intelligent, pretty, has a libido as high as mine is (VERY important), and she offsets the more serious/depressed frame of mind that I've been all-too-often in since October.  Just as importantly, she understands that I'm not ready for a totally serious relationship right now, and is giving me my space and letting me take things slowly.  I'm so happy when I'm with her though.  I was thinking about her the other day and something came to me.  Two things, actually, one right after the other.  The first was that I remembered the classic scene from ""As Good As It Gets"" where Jack says to Helen: ""You make me want to be a better man,"" which is a sweet gesture but sort of implies that the man he is isn't good enough for her.  The second thought, following closely on the first's heels was this: ""You make me feel at ease being myself.""

This is how I feel when I'm with Kim.

I really wish she were here right now.  Fuck, I wish anybody were here right now.

I'm lonely.

My emotions are so mixed up... I hardly know what I'm feeling, let alone why...

This is the way the entry ends
This is the way the entry ends
This is the way the entry ends...
Not with a bang, but a whimper.

10 points if you get that reference."

"event","Greetings, all!  I'm back from Fanime and am a better person for having gone.  At several people's request, here is a log of some of the highlights...

The drive up was enjoyable (but long... 5 and a half hours); we had dance music and <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/ultimakuja"">ultimakuja</a> and I was in the back seat with an attrative young girl.  ^_^  We traded massages, but that's all that happened.  I spent most of the drive sleeping.  We missed pre-con registration by about half an hour, unfortunately, so most of us had to wait until the next morning to register.  Also met up with my hentai sis, <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/suzakus_miko"">suzakus_miko</a> in the lobby.  Neither one of us knew the other was going, so that was cool.  :-D

So, after eating dinner at McD's, we decided to take advantage of the hotel's jaccuzi.  ^_^  I got a double massage (back and head) from Heather (the girl from the back seat) and her sister Melissa. XD  woo-hoo!  We stayed out there until about 3 am.  I, having slept a great deal of the day and having drank about a liter of coke at dinner, wasn't tired, so I stayed up to get a good place in line at 6, before registration opened.  I went down as Serge (from Chrono Cross) and once I got my badge and stuff, went back upstairs for a nap and shower.  Nota bene: the showers at this hotel (Westin in Santa Clara) are the coolest EVER.  They have dual WaterPik heads (one on top of the other) so you get sprayed from your head to your knees.  I think I stayed in for about 30 minutes the first time, I enjoyed it so much.  ^_^

After my nap, I checked out the dealer's room and bought some pr0n/hentai. XD  Took a lot of pics (still waiting to get 'em developed) and then met up with <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/miyabi"">Michi</a> who was cosplaying Hot-Glue Shiranui Mai (don't ask).  She and I posed for a fair number of SergexMai pics....strange couple, eh?

Next day (Saturday), I did Zell in the morning (and still had a surprisingly large number of pics taken of me, considering that I've worn Zell at 3 cons now) and checked out the Artists' Alley.  Bought some pics (straight and pr0n XD) from a guy who r00lz named Dave Wong (if you ask me nicely, I may show them to you ^_~).  I was gonna change into Tidus halfway through the day, but I ran into a guy named CJ who OWNZ that costume.  It cost him $400 and he had a molded plastic water sword.  Rather dejected, I returned to my room and <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/vandonovan"">vandonovan</a> was nice enough to let me wear her fantastic Himura Kenshin costume (under the proviso that I would tell everyone that she made it), complete with long red wig!  Here is a typical example of my next 278,050,312 encounters:

Me (as Kenshin): *walking around with my hands in my sleeves*
Random Fangirl: MALE KENSHIN!!!!!  *TACKLEGLOMP*
Me (as Kenshin): Orooooo....
Random Fangirl: *huggletakepicscamperoff*

I made a pretty good Kenshin, and even went to the dance later that night as him.  Yay for raver-Kenshin!  :-D  Oh yes.  Saturday, I was also hanging around with a guy named Alex a lot.  He was very nice, smart and witty, and, unfortunately, gay.  Alas.  We had a good time, though, and went to the yaoi panel together, pretending to be a couple XD.  The girls there liked that, especially 'cuz I was still Kenshin.  There was a mini-party in my room later that night, complete with alcohol (I had a really good pina colada, among many other things), and I tried to teach Alex some martial arts while I was buzzed.  ^_^;;;  After that, a bunch of us went down to the jacuzzi, but I can't tell here what happened; it would embarrass certain involved parties XD.  We had a lot of fun, though, despite the bruises ^_~.

Went to bed about 7am and was up at 10 to get ready to leave.  I slept for almost the whole ride home.

One other interesting thing: I hadn't noticed before how much my personality is affected by my character when I'm in costume.  I noticed it now because I wore Kenshin and Zell so close together.  When I was Kenshin, I was perfectly happy to wander around sedately and quietly with my hands in my sleeves.  I was even responding to picture requests in Japanese and imitating his voice without thinking.  ^_^  And then when I put on Zell, within 2 or 3 minutes, I was being happy and bouncy and genki and flirty and running around and on stuff and being a chatterbox.  Such is the effect that cosplay has on me. ^_^;

Anyway, I had fun.  I give a huge thanks to Todd for giving me the money to go.  Todd, you are the MAN!"

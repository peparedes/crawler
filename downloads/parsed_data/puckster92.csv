2 hours later a friend of hers asks her to go for a drive ... she goes. Her friend swerved to avoid a truck, hitting a tree instead. Her friend was killed instantly and shes in critical condition.

This is the conversation between her sister and her boyfriend

Sister: oh my god (crying)
Boy: what? whats wrong ?
Sister: my sister,your girlfriend, was involved in a major car wreck
Boy: is she ok?
Sister: shes in critical condition
Boy: I'll be there in 10 minutes

He shows up to the hospital room ...standing outside the door, going over the last conversation in his mind over and over as he heard the machines beep and breathing tubes pump

Boy: she wanted to give me something or tell me something
Girls mom: yeah this...

It was an envelope smelling like she did sealed with a kiss in lipstick. He opened it ... it said ""... your everything to me....i love you with everything i am and everything i have...i want to spend the rest of my life with you."" sealed in it was a ripped movie ticket from the first movie they went to ... and the first picture they took together ...he kissed the picture as a tear fell from his face onto the picture. It looked as if in the picture she was crying. Then the machines flatlined....3 minutes later she was pronounced dead.

If you have any heart...any soul...or want to be happy you will repost this. if you care for someone ...do not let something like this ever happen"

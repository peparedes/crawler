"event","It's been again a time since last i wrote. The seasons have turned and i find myself perilously close to the time of anniversaries that i had never counted on, and a year i thought i'd never reach. Of this writing i have successfully made it through the first week of being twenty-seven years of age. Being officially past my date of expiration, it seems as though it's time to live like it.

Victories have been won on the political front and on the personal. Work proceeds in ways that i had never though possible, as really marketing and my own self just seems like oil and water. But there we are. 

Spring is slowly creeping forward, as are my pretensions of being a professional artist, above and beyond the call of a mere designer. The shape of the 'Clyffe is going to be changing in the months to come. Which is exciting and new and different. The cleaning this year is going to be somewhat epic, given that there will be a giant dumpster. And into it will go our broken things, and musty afterthoughts. Probably Weenis's toys, but that rather goes without saying.

People have been coming in, more often than they've been leaving, which is thrilling and wonderful. Things remain warm and close, even in the growing world.

And so it is, i leave this entry with so much unsaid and so much to look forward to.

Happy New Years everyone. May it be all that you make of it."

"event","There's something about cloudy days, when the world is damp and cool that leads one to musing. Moving back and forth across one's home, searching for remnants of the summer and the sweater you were certain you had shoved in a particular corner roughly six months ago. Autumn is well and truly upon us, and it seems as though it will be leading into a winter that will be a bit less harsh than others have been.

Finally have a name to put to the ""vapours"", which comes as quite a relief, to be honest. There's stuff to do about it! A solid (and rather long) sort of name to put to it, and did i mention <b>there are things i can do about it</b>? Truly, it's a marvelous sort of thing.

New leads have popped up on the art/design front, we'll be seeing how that pans out over the next few months. So much to remember to do, and so much fear to overcome. Oh my.

For the first time in quite some time, i'll be out of the state for a Holiday. This may well end in fire, but then again, most of my endeavors have that sort of potential. Updates will occur when this becomes an actual thing, as opposed to something that is in the far future.

Parties are being planned, among them a Hallowe'en party, and something that has been dubbed ElectionGate '08. That's right kids, show up at Wardenclyffe on election day and drink your concern over the future of The State away. Wee and ha.

Speaking of moving back and forth, i really ought get back to it. Happy autumn, all."

Which, given my current elcetro-pop tendencies, is a bit bemusing. Though, now having looked over my music library, really oughtn't surprise me over-much. Buggery.

Regardless, the new Ben Folds/Regina Spektor song is terribly catchy and will likely be in regular rotation for the next few weeks. Which means it's time to dig Piibo out of the car. And pop on Death Cab For Cutie's cover of This Charming Man, while i'm thinking on it. Which is something that i ought have already had on (or in it?) it already, but sadly is not.

Shit, i need to go on a Morrissey binge now."

This beats taking up a habit, i'm told.

Much of the entirety of everyone will be here by Friday, which will make this Solstice perhaps the best one ever. Certainly the best in recent years.

Leading a professional sort of life remains to be frightening, but less and less of it shows each day. Mayhap someday i will be able to bluff as though it were never there to begin with! Haha! As if.

What are the rest of you folks about this summer? What are you reading, doing and/or planning? Are you taking up piano lessons, or perhaps going out and conducting swimming races with selkies? Let me know! i am curious!

To-day is a day for fevered working out, puzzling over code, and copious amounts of vicodin. Oh, and plotting out bits of the Sunday game, as nothing says quality like pain meds, right?

The weather is perfect and i think i'll attempt to talk Heather into putting up with me in it. All this nervous energy needs to go -somewhere- and i can't really swallow my fears like i used to when i was younger.

In other news, it looks like a good third of the people i know will be attending Gen Con this year, and as such, i believe some mild planning might be called for. Really, what this works out to, is in the evening we all need to get together and find an entertaining way of going about and tearing up the town. Any suggestions?"

"event","It's one thing i never thought i'd find myself doing, but it seems to be a habit i've been slipping into in my old age. Whereas in the long ago times, there would be over the top, blown out well, blown out everything, it's reached a point where much of the world is getting downplayed. At least, in the near constant narrative that my mind runs as i go about the business of living and doing.

This follows along with the disconcerting notion that i've gone a bit adrift of my emotions. They're there, but it's like someone else is living them, and i'm only getting relays via semaphore much of the time. Which, while is makes for an interesting mental image, is less than fun to be living through.

And so it is, that i've come upon the conclusion that this will be the summer of the up and out. Dancing in the living room regardless of who may be home, making large gestures for the sheer joy of being able to do so, getting back into the habit of sprawling out and painting in nothing but a sports bra and bifurcated garment that ostensibly goes on below the waist. This might well include items such as pants, or shorts.

The summer is for doing and living, and that involves experiencing things dammit. It's time for recalling that winter's over and it's all right to traipse about barefoot and dreaming again.

Time to get a drink and get -on- that shit."

1) Using band names (AND MUSICIANS), spell out your name.
L - LCD Soundsystem
I - Idlewild
A - Aphex Twin

2) Have you ever had a song written about you?
Yes, and it was mopey as all get out. This is what happens when you date goths.

3) What songs make you cry?
""The Blower's Daughter"" by Damien Rice, the sang makes me think of the movie ""Closer"" and then i just go to pieces. Loreena McKennitt's rendition of ""The Lady of Shalott"" gets me as well.

4) What songs make you happy?
Just about anything by Hellogoodbye or Great Big Sea, they're both passing brilliant for feeling giddy and bouncing around. Death Cab's cover of ""This Charming Man"" makes me squee quite a bit as well.

5) What do you like to listen to before bed?
Classical music when i remember that i actually have a functioning radio. Most of the time it is simply the sounds of fans and slowly realised dreams."

"event","There had been plans for this to be a day in which i woke up at an hour that is at least vaguely reasonable to people who do the 9 to 5 grind, but that sort of fell through. As such, i woke up around noon, cursing various deities and the children at the local elementary school. Obviously, the little punters aren't properly sugared up, and as such were unable to wake me up in a timely fashion. Well, wake me up again. i had gotten up at nine-something-or-other, and snuggled back up with the intent to sleep another ten minutes. This was, obviously, not as successful as hoped.

On the other hand, i am well rested for the first time in a couple weeks, which is a nice change of pace.

The day is cycling between sunny and bright, and the world being remarkably without direct sunlight even though the vast majority of the sky is clear clear blue. This makes for some interesting shifts in motivation and energy levels. Hopefully, this won't get in the way of lawn mowing and the attendant puttering around the lawn. There are likely balls, frisbees and childish hopes and dreams that i need to throw back over the fence.

Everyone has been making requests for books, music and video games appropriate to the season, and not to be left behind i think i'll be making a request of my own. Given that there's going to be some traveling done with other humans in my company i find myself in need of ways to keep myself and others entertained while in a car/train/super-sonic dirigible. So, suggestions? This also extends to games to play in the yard, or at a park. As i think that as this stage in our lives Red Rover could become a bit more dangerous than it ever got in choir.

Which is saying something, really.

Traverse City is this weekend, as well as DEMF. Both of which promise to be fun and exhausting, which is really the right and proper way to put a cap on Spring.

Like walking down to the park, procrastinating on mowing the lawn, playing with hedge-clippers (who doesn't want to play with hedge-clippers?), and other things that would have been of use. But once i got home, all notions of that sort of thing were put aside in favor of taking a nap with the cat.

She takes up the entirety of my torso! It is -amazing-. 

But all of this laziness stems from having a really excellent (if not very long) time last night. i forgot words! There was toast! And the projector that would not focus. o.o This might be because the projector operator was a zombie. At least, i am thinking he might have been a zombie. i didn't look, what with the sensible fear that pink dye saturated brains are somewhat of a delicacy amongst the un-dead.

The thing about hanging out with new people, especially when you are without the company of your tried-and-true people, is that you can keenly feel the fact that you are likely kinda different than you were the last time you gave yourself an internal once over. And this can be a strange sort of thing that causes a body to become tongue tied and oddly uncertain in the face of what would be a normal sort of interaction. Leaves one feeling strange and new and mutable in a certain, rather giddy, sort of way.

This is not conducive to learning new dance steps, in case anyone was wondering.  

To-morrow <strike>there will be a trip to the beach. Or, barring that,</strike> we will hang out at Chanson's and <strike>drink in the hot-tub until it seems like it's just as good as going to the beach</strike> GO SEE <b>IRON MAN</b> AND HAVE A RUNNING NERF BATTLE, YEAH! Also, my father is turning fifty-six. Which is honestly much more frightening than the fact that i turned twenty-six. Dads aren't supposed to get old, you see, they are just supposed to get grey at the edges and somehow grow both more curmudgeonly and kindly forever and ever, amen.

It is still today though, and there are things that i should likely get on about. Like rocking out to the mix-tape that drives everyone else nuts. HAHA! Victory for the one who is home by herself! There is also that business of getting art-work done during said rocking out, and getting laundry done among other things.

"event","To-day, i have found what i believe to be the best thing about largely conducting one's affairs from home. And that would be taking advantage of those scant hours in the day when there's no-one about. And so it was, with great relish, that i wound up taking a shower with the door open, having set the radio on top of the laundry hamper. There was singing, and dancing, and a lot of water. Somewhere during the process, i managed to get clean as well.

This made up for a morning that was a bit more scary than i thought it would be. There's nothing quite like leaping up out of sleep to answer the phone and once that business is conducted, watch the world grow dim around you. It was a mauve sort of dim too, no notion as to what that might mean though.

Perhaps it means the Mary Kay armies seek my blood, the better to rejuvenate creepy, elderly, mid-western hostesses or some-such.

And now, back to work!

Zug zug, and all that."

"event","We watched <i>Paprika</i> last night. It was as delightfully vibrant and surreal as the other films that the creative team has put out. The soundtrack is something that i require, and as such will be seeking out shortly. Unsurprisingly, i found myself identifying with the dream girl. Par for the course.

<i>Sicko</i> was also part of the day, and it was more or less what i expected it to be. Though it was fun in the special features, watching the various talking heads completely denouncing the possibility that other country's medical systems could be even half so nice as they were portrayed as in the movie. Which is, as i understand it, just about what most people see their socialised medical programs as. Flawed systems, but certainly better than leaving it in private hands for the most part.

Five weeks of paid vacation a year and a thirty-five hour work week sound utterly divine,  and i think the attitude that such things are beneficial to society at all levels is something that needs to be incorporated into the American mindset. Though this will like never happen, and really what the hell do i know? i'm just a slack-ass artist cum intellectual and a godless-commie-heathen to boot. Nevermind the fact that godless heathen is an oxymoron.

If anyone can hook me up with a copy of ""When Will Then Be Now?"" (a cover album of The Smiths tunes) i would love them forever and ever, unto the heat death of the universe.

<strike>Part of the day's proceedings shall involve calling around in the hopes of finding mental health care on the cheap.</strike> Should anyone have any suggestions as to where a body might call about such things, it would be greatly appreciated.

Plans for Yulemas go apace, and while the computer related bits are running more slowly than i'd like they're still moving ahead.

For some reason, i seem to have formed the mental connection that jingly pants or plaid skirts equal productivity. It seems i'll have to be getting more in the way of warm tights and legwarmers to accommodate this trend. Certainly not a bad thing though, i should think. Especially since none of my ""short"" skirts are any shorter than just above the knee. Such is life, i suppose.

On to thing that are of important to one Jess (and other who might be attendant to this sort of madness): i'm getting a list of conventions and their attendant art spaces around. We ought plan FOR CONQUERING and great justice.

i actually finished the art-work for the Wardenclyffe Yulemas missive, and will be seeing to its publication on Sunday, more like than not.

On the health related front, i apparently have an irregular heartbeat, but it's not consistent, and ""nothing to worry about"". Given that it took over a month to receive this news, and the fact that i had to call for it, you'll have to excuse me if i'm a bit unconvinced oh Dr and attendant office drones.

Got a lot to do to-day, but i'm fair confident that it can get done with a minimum of swearing and running about in a tizzy. After all, i have A List. i am -organised-. Tremble ye mighty, and despair.

Thankshousing and the week leading up to it was well up to cavalcade standards, and whimsy was present in large amounts; this is as it ought be. Needless to say, there is so much in the way of thanks given to the occupants of Wardenclyffe, the rest of the celebrants and the family members who have roamed far afield (or had to work, damn holiday sales and the like). Without you lot, there would be precious little to celebrate.

Normally, this is where i would be regaling you with tales of fun and games on the medical front, but sadly there's nothing new to report. This is in large part due to my doctor's office being incredibly inept at doing things such as calling me, and the desk staff being seemingly made of half baked thoughts and straw, and as such being singularly unhelpful. Educated mud indeed.

i've been giving thought to the nature of adulthood, though there's precious little that coherent enough to put to paper (as it were). Once i get something though, expect some rambling to such ends. 

There will be updates on both business and art later on in the week, rambling on the latter will largely go as thus: ""LDKFRTJlksejakthAKLSDFHqw;jfkhtgslkgjdzkfjf I FINALLY HAVE SOMETHING UP BWAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAA!!!! OM NOM NOM"" with rolling and frothing following shortly afterwards.

No longer acting entirely as a freelance entity, i have found employment with a certain book-shop in the EL area. It might also be safe to assume that given the fact that i've been employed by three different organisations to do this sort of business, that i might be something of a budding webmaster. Who'd have thought?

Things with the art proceed apace, getting bogged down with a touch of dialogue and some self-doubt. But drinking more sugar water and stomping some arrows ought alleviate at least one of those issues.

Autumn is still the season of reminiscence, though this year there's less in the way of melancholy. Hell, there's been less in the way of moods and fugues all around, which has been delightful in so many ways.

On the medical front, i had a halter monitor on earlier in the week. It was rather entertaining as it gave the appearance of Chthonic tentacles; fun for the whole family. Not entirely certain when the results will be coming in from that, but i think that there will have been some decent data garnered. As really, if i'm going to turn grey while working out, it might as well be in the name of science.

Last night in the shower i had some interesting reflections on the nature and necessity of language, but unfortunately all such thoughts left when i started to towel off. Instead, i offer up a meme that was tossed my way by the ever delightful Miss Jessy (one of our Pokanadians)

"event","It is terribly amusing to me, that while i am generally decent with modern technology and its various proclivities i have to settle down and write things out by hand, lest i come off sounding like an utter retard. There's just something about having a writing instrument in hand, scratching ideas out and getting things all in a jumble as one's thoughts are moving faster than one's hand. Or hands, if a body is inclined to ambidexterity. ...And writing with both hands at once.

On the topic of other things less amusing, the blood tests of last week turned up exactly dick nor shit. Which is about what i had expected, but had been hoping for something else. Such is life though, and it means that there will be further adventures in the land of medical testing. Which likely sounds more fun than it will wind up being.

i believe that i shall endeavor to steal as many latex gloves and giant swabby things as i possibly can. It seems like a decent enough goal to have.

My pants are jingly today, which brings much joy and somehow convinces me that i am a Real Girl who is capable of writing things that would entice people to hire me. Also, the pink shirt with drunken kitties on it. As everyone knows, drunk kitties are the epitome of professionalism."

i'll keep updating this as info comes in, i do believe. It certainly beats writing the 10,000 mini entries. Which is very similar to the 10,000 things of Taoism, and not very much like 10,000 Maniacs at all.

Edit the first
Well, so far, there's no particular notion as to what could be wrong. An initial check-up came up with zilch in the way of evidence for the issue being neurological. Which is something of a weight off my mind (haha, i know, i am clevar).

Five separate blood tests will be run, off of three rather large tubes of blood. Unfortunately, i passed out during the proceedings and nearly slid out of the seat. Admittedly, it would have likely looked hilarious to a passerby.

Next on the agenda: calling the insurance company to see what they'll cover by way of MRI scans and the like. Whee~!"

"event","To-day is very much one of those unreal days that have a tendency of following a weekend in which one has a very excellent time, but the suspicion that one is about to step off and into the aether is a very real sort of thing. While this isn't a bad stepping off, it's one of those moments when you realise that things are at a point in which one needs to make a choice and then do something about it.

As i set here typing, i find myself thinking about watercolours, and whether i have the right type of salt to achieve the effect that i have in mind (i never have the salt i'm looking for, mind you). There are also vague thoughts on what i've been listening to of late, and what that says about me as a person. When we die, are we judged by our ""most played"" lists from iTunes? More likely than one would think! <strike>As though weighing heart feathers made any more sense</strike>

It is Autumn now, though it feels like it should still be summer. But then, i belive it should always be the beginning of summer, with clear skies giving way to afternoon thuderstorms and puddle stomping. Where the days are forever getting longer and there is the thought of going out in the evening to swim in a body of water that is never yours.

So to-day is a day of realised possibility. i'm going to finish that code and the watermark. Find the salt that i need and take a turn at dancing with arrows.

It is a fine day."

There will be more notes on this when i'm less frazzled, and the world seems to be a more stable place. But, suffice it to say, things are more or less all right, and everything that's not right can be fixed."

Next week i'll be out in Boston, coming back to Wardenclyffe on the following Wednesday in the early early hours (why i thin ki can manage to navigate airport terminals at 6 in the morning is beyond me). There will be catching Great Big Sea, i think. Joe of the east coast, is this still the case?? :O?? I MUST KNOW. Mostly for the purpose of how many people are going and whether or not i ought rent a car.

The weekend after that it looks like i'll be heading out to Gen Con for the purpose of schlepping my shit to hung-over members of the RPG publishing world. 

. . .

I might also find it in me to chew out someone at White Wolf about 4th ed. Changeling. *clears throat*

Just have to get some coding done, and the website will be up. Now constitutes the portion of the evening where it seems vaguely plausible that i might be something approaching professional.

There's really so much more that i'd like to say, but my head is so much a happy muddle at the moment. And really, it's been that way for a while. Fuck, summer rocks."

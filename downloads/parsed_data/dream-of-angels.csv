"event","<P><FONT size=5>ATTN: Kitten up for adoption!!!! </FONT><FONT size=3>her name is Iris (i call her Borus), shes about&nbsp;5 months old and is friendly one she get to know you.&nbsp;but she has some problems... first of all she has one eye. its not as creepy as it sounds. it actually makes her cuter. but she also had feline leukimia. so that means you cant have other cats or else they might get infected. feline leukimia is not infectious to humans...dont worry. but she used to be a stray and now she is in need of a home because she cant live at work anymore cause she keeps setting off the alarm. so if you think that mabe you would be able to adopt her, that would be amazing. or if you know anyone who might want to, tell me. the last thing i want is for her to end up in a kennel, and bein put alseep. ill post a picture of her to guilt all you jerks into keeping her. seriously. try and help me find her a home.</FONT></P>"

"event","<P>aww shit so my thanksgiving rocked. shall we recap? i think so. i woke up at around 1130 which was nice and pushed billy out of his deep sleep. lazy ass. and we made our way over to the reeses where the most delicious breakfast was waiting for us. yumm. even though it was like 130 when we started eating it. so we all hung out and ohh man kevin got some weird creatures that i got to play with. yeah thats right i held a tarantula (sp?). it was awesome. and the guys played ping pong and what not. bill beat me so bad at foos ball. damn. and i improved greatly at mario tennis. yessss. after that we ate dinner at like 4 oclock which was hard since i had just&nbsp;ate an outrageous breakfast. so i didnt eat much. i went home and made some pies with my sisters which was interesting since coralyn cant cook for anything. but dinner was good and the corie gave me a hair cut. which was needed. and i dont know it was a nice family day. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>the rest of our long weekend flew! friday me and corie hit up the met which was cool, and after i went to corys party. i got there late so alot of people had left but it was still fun. we ended up sleeping over that night cause billy cory and grahm were ddring until what like 6 in the morning. ridiculous! but it was cool. everyone crashed all over the house. we made a not that unconfortable bed on the floor with some blankets. not bad if i do say so myself. </P>
<P>saturday like didnt happen as cory put it. we woke up at 11 and me and bill and mia went to my house and slept till 4 something. oo but me and billy did go to sushi at izumis which was interesting. yeah i made him eat the raw fish. yummm. i dont even remember the rest of that night. but sunday cory needed our help putting together a movie for him. which i told him i wouldnt do but it turned out to be kinda fun. and itcame out cool too. and yeah theres a very sexy scene in it. haha actually its about drugs and me making bill do cocaine and then billy going on this weird trip where we make out and then i eventually take advantage of him. ooooo. but its cool. rated R though. so bring an id. and now our weekend is over and school is back. boooo! i skipped today cause i havent been feeling well. yuck. </P>
<P>i really cant wait for xmas break. im like counting down the days. im joining the gym which is going to rock heavily. and i wont have like 13 hour work days going from school to work every day. its going to be perfect. only like 3 more weeks or something. plus chirstmas. plus new years. </P>"

well i know i havent updated in a while and havent commented and that is because my computer got a virus and every time i would go to do anything, it would make this gun shot sound. ask me what it sounds like cause i cant type-sound it. kinda like ""chick chick BOOM"" any way i didnt mind too much not being online, kinda did some more productive stuff that sitting at my comp all the time. like sleeping, and hanging out with people. like my sister. 

i, at the moment, have alot of evergy because there are alot of people who piss me of alot and get my very frustrated. for example; nope just kiding i wont livejournal bash, but i will make up silly names for them then livejournal bash....like white out. you can just ask me who this is and ill tell you. well white out is a jerk times a hundred.i cant believe the things that come out of his mouth and the things he does. ugh, i get so frustrated sometimes. and i cant even say that he suprises me because its nothing i wouldnt expect. and for some reason it still gets me really pissed off/upset when i hear the things he does when he acts a fool! im not sure why, im trying to figure that out myself. but either way sometimes i really hate him. and as much as i want to punch him in his face sometimes, or compleatly go off on him, i dont. i shut my little mouth for one reason or another. ugh! i basically regret alot of things ive done this year, and most of the stuff that this certain white out was involved in i regret. what a bitch. HES SO FUCKING SELF CENTERED! 
which leads me to my next frustrating person. who we'll call record, since me and natalie are all up on this name making up spree. well record is a self centered jerk. the world doesnt revolve around you and your not all that sweet cakes. just because you say something doesnt mean that thats the way things are going to go. or that anyone agrees with you. ugh ill let natalie bitch about him. 

well thats good for now. i kinda miss venting to the internet.

"event","ohh man best night everrr
haha
me and mia threw a party at justins house
with just us three.
it was awesome.
we baked the worst cake anyone would ever eat everrrrr and watched the super bowl (aka janets boob) and chilled out. it was sweet. wrote a good rap. juice is the best. 
the ride home topped off the night though. we get into the car and my mom is sitting there compleatly trashed eating chicken wings rambling on about how there arent panthers in north carolina and how they shouldnt have that name. it was sweet. my dad seemed embarrassed.

i wish we didnt have school tomorrow though. ugh. i like nights like tonight. it would have been better if it had been a slumber party though.

goodnight."

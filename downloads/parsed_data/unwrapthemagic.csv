"event","All the old college buddies are making their way back to my small town. You always think to yourself it's nice to have friends, but then I ask you why is it nice? And you answer I dunno, I guess for companionship and the thought of happiness and joy and strength that you may recieve from that person. After all these things are considered and accounted for in the end they leave you with nothing but warmth and the knowledge of what it is like to be someone else. And I ask you again, why is it nice? Are you not strong enough to be content while alone? Are you wanting to make it easier on yourself and watch the life of another so closely that soon enough it becomes part of your own. 

I guess this would be my thought, just to make a summation, you are my friends and I need you in my life, but I don't know why. It pleases me, the pleasurer, to have the pleasure of pleasuring you, the pleasuree. And it pleases the pleasurer if the pleasuree gets pleasure by pleasing the pleasurer. 
WOW! Thats alot of pleasure!!!!

Where is my KY when I need it!!"

"event","My first true entry, a thing of beauty, it is. Wow writers block already. Where should I begin. Writing for myself and yet all the world may view and be apart of my life. In-credible!!! I'll start from the most recent I guess and work my way back. As of right now, and probably the reason I have started my quest to inform the world of my life and all it's intricate weavings, I have lost a love (not talking family member). A love that could have conquered all of the most impossible, unbelievable, hardships that this hateful and yet at the same time beautiful world could imagine.

hold that thought, if your reading just get used to it I will jump around a lot ;P

Underwear are useless, they say extra protection, more sanitary, keeps things in place (okay maybe tighty whiteys on that one), I mean sure it's exciting to see people in underwear because your that much closer to the fully nude position (and when your naked there could be only one reason for that, wink wink (yes, I am a horndog, deal with it)), but come on they are ridiculous on all levels. I myself would not mind being naked all the time, but for some strange reason it's not accepted at the local bar/restaraunt or while at work. It's like we are taught to wear underwear in case we go into battle or have an accident we will have that one extra layer of protection. Protection from what shitting our pants, cause I know when I piss myself it doesn't matter whether I have undies on or not? Hey Hardass, don't act like you've never pissed yourself. 

Back to the Story

I'm not being overly-dramatic at all when I say that this was a love that would have lasted a lifetime, on my part only though (obviously). Now that she has left, I am alone lost in a massive hate for giving any effort, time, thought, etc. Lifeless and dull for a moment I yell why, why the *%@# should I feel this way when I was the provider. I had the love and have love still to give, which she knows so she comes back and asks for a second chance. Predicament!!! Was supposed to last forever but she needed time and now realizing this great loss, the desicrator of beauty returns, to reclaim her place in my vast garden of eden. Sympathetically I conceed but with treacherous woes. Now I do not know for sure the extent of her love for me and whether it is a love of passion or lust I have. The weeds begin to flourish. 

I am an undying river though, and so this tragedy courses through my vains and if it passes, it shall do so and come back more thick and flavorful. Yet if it does not then it is a pain I must accept and cleanse myself of before my ravishing, lustrous, eden can begin again.  


Thank you for this Roe. 

To lie here under you, is all that I could ever do.

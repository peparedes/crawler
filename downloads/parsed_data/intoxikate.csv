"event","Dia dos in Florida. Today we took a little day trip on a charter boat around the gulf. It was awesome. I don't think the weather could have been any more beautiful than it was. It was nice to sit out on the bow of the boat by myself and not speak to anyone for about an hour or so. I just sat and thought. It's honestly amazing how the water clears your mind. You're not bombarded by the hassels of everyday life when your near water. Or at least I'm not. Sometimes I think I'd be a completely different person if I lived on the coast. Tempting thought. 
I'm just getting tired of my life in Atlanta. And there's nothing wrong with it. I know great people. I have great friends, a job that I like and my family is there. But i'm tired of it. i've been doing the same shit with the same people day in and day out for the past 10 years it feels like. And I'm not complaining. I have been blessed with the opportunity to build the relationships that I have built with the people that I've built them with, but I just want more out my life. I want to get more out of it. and I imagine it would be possible to do such living where I live, but I feel like I just get sucked back into the ruitine of my atlanta life and I can never really remain on the outside of it. I get overly concerened with mindless, pointless endevors when I'm there for too long. It's not an admirable quality and it definetly doesn't shine on my more admirable assets. 
I know that its not only my location that needs a little remodeling, It's me. It's my life in general. I'm not even saying that taking off would solve anything,.. and really, what is there to solve? I'm not unhappy. I think I'm just bored. I just need a change of scenery for a while. I need a little more adventure in my life. I need a lot of things. But what I really need to do is stop talking about it and start doing something about it. 
Things I'm looking forward to....
 I'm thinking about moving in with Ben 2 (have to specify) when my lease with Crystal is up. I think it'll be beneficial for me. Sometimes I need to be more closely surrounded my creative energy to help get over my insecurity with it. How strange am I really? Am I the only one that has this awkward trait? I sure hope so. I know, my vaguness annoys me too. 
Anyway, We'll see how all of that plays out when its time for all of that to take place. But I see some growth involved in that situation, even if it's only for a little while. We'll see."

"event","I sit here now, as I too seldomly do with the same intentions I always come here with. Release. I think I just realized that I wait too long between sesions that I am at a loss for words. There is always too much to say. Because I never say it.  That is one thing I think I have held on to for too long. I have not yet mastered the art of letting go. I second guess everthing I do down to the little insignificant nothings. I create havock out of minescule discomfort. and too frequently feel like I'm not making any sense.  I can already tell that this vacation was way overdo. 

I miss Wes. He may be my only real sense of relief in this world.  He's the only one I feel at home with. He's like my own personal sanctuary.  I swear Wesley, our paths just never seem to meet and the right times. You always seem to go when I decide to come back and vice-versa. 

I think I need to give myself more time to reflect. I've been in Florida for not even 24 hours and I can already feel the difference that its making. I can't wait to move out of my apartment. I am way too affected by energy that is anything short of positive or comforting. I need to build a new sanctuary. I am still highly concidering getting my own place, but there are so many downsides in the equation and I don't want to end up anymore stressed out then i have been this time around. I'm not worried about it anymore though. My life always seems to find a way to work out the unwanted kinks. I don't have much patience for them.

I'm feeling that itch again. The change your location itch. But its getting bigger and more intense. I am actually more aware of it right now than I have been. i've been trying to ignore it because I don't really have the energy to focus on it. I think I need it though. I think I need to go. And then I get that voice in my head like maybe that's not it. I have a tendency to desire drastic change in my life when something isn't right. And its true. Something feels out of place. And I'm not sure I know what it is especially now that I am (for the most part) content with everything. But on the other hand my contentment lies only with the superficial. I want more than I'm doing and I have been saying this for so long. And I'm sure that's why I sit at this computer and write the same words in different sentences as I have been for the past 6 years since I've been feeling this way. I just sit and wait for myself to come up with yet another justifyable excuse as to why my life has been so stagnant and why I feel so apathetic toward it.  It's obviously not going anywhere. and it's because I'm not letting it.  I know what I want and I have nothing less than one hundred and fifty million percent faith and confidence that I can achieve it, So why is it like just the simple fact of knowing it is enough, The curiosity should be killing me... or maybe that's just what its doing... slowly. The intensity of it all dies down and I don't think I'm too fond of this feeling. Maybe I should do something about it. Maybe!"

"event","Still feel like shit. I've been sick for like a week now. I am convinced that I have bronchitis, and I'm pretty sure I just got over having a sinus infection. I worked last night and the night before. George was riding my ass last night. I could barely keep up with it, but I did what I could. At the end of the night I was so exhausted I almost started bawling when George told me he could tell I still felt sick because I was dragging. I was so drained that I actually took that personally when he didn't say it with that intent. 
Crystal and I went to Detroit for the weekend to see John. We had a blast. It was good to see him. I don't know how I feel about it right now though. I've been feeling somewhat guilty about my actions when I was there recently, but I know that I shouldn't because I was and still am honest with him about my feelings and everything that's going on in my life regarding that as of right now. But regardless I know how he feels about me and I don't want to give him mixed signals, something I think I succeeded in doing. 
Wes and I are going out to eat. I swear the only time I write in this is when I'm over at his house."

"event","Sitting at Russell's house. It's two in the morning. I've been in a funk all day. I don't really know why. I think it's just the change of pace in my life. I just started waiting tables at Mazzy's and it's definetly a change... in every aspect. It's completely changed my everything in life. How much I sleep how much I eat. I'm on my feet walking around all night almost everynight and I think it's taking its toll on my body. I couldn't move today and I slept for 8 hours last night. I went out to eat with my mom, which was weird in itself, but when I got home I just fell back asleep for about 3 hours and I couldn't make myself get up. I almost felt depressed today. I think I am just running really low on energy. I'm sure I'll adapt to it though. I have definetly adapted to how much more money I've been making though which is nice. 
Hatch quit the band last night. Ben came into Mazzy's all wasted and upset. I hate seeing him like that. I hate that it's actually happening. Maybe it'll be better for all of them. I just can't see them without eachother. I am going out to dinner with him sometime this week. I wish I could talk some sense into him, but I don't see that happening. And even if it were a possibility I don't see what difference it would make with the rest of the band. They seem pretty dead set and the departure. It's a waste, I think.
Blake came into work last night. It was nice to see him and just be able to be light-hearetd about everything that's gone on. I do miss him and I'm over all of that shit. It bothered me at first, but in all honesty it has been more of a blessing in disguise. I don't see how it would have been possible for us to have been completely platonic had he not hooked back up with her. And ultimetly it wouldn't have worked out and it probably would have just caused more fucking problems in our ""friendship"" or whatever you want to call it. It's a good think that it happened because it killed every romantic and passionette thought that I've ever had about him. Even if things don't end up working out for them I just don't have it in me to play anymore games with that girl. I'm done with that.
I talked to Eric for a little while. I called him to see how he was holding up with the Jason situation and we ended up talking for like 45 minutes. When I hung up the phone I realized that I can't be friends with him. Not now, maybe not ever. He's the only one that has ever had that affect on me. I don't know why. He's the only one that has truly gotten to me. And it's ironic because when I talked to him today he told me that as much as he loves me he feels like he really never got to know me. And he's right. He told me that he hopes that next time I'm with someone I open up to him, and I told him, as sensitively as possible that it wasn't really me that had a problem with opening up, it was him that had the problem recieving it. He was always so concerned with his own problems and our relationship was always revolved around the current crisis of his life that mine was always put on the side. He agreed and apologized and it was cool, but I can't talk to him. And it sucks. I can see Blake and it doesn't get to me that much. I get a little uneasy at first. I avoid eye-contact righ off the bat, but then I let it go and I'm just happy that we can be friends. 
I'm about to go see John and it's like the same thing. I am nervous to see him, but mainly because I haven't seen him in like 4 years and have barely spoken to him in between. But I'm not nervous that it's gonig to be hard to see him and not be with him or anything like that. I love him. He was probably the best relationship I've ever had, eventhough we were so young, but it just doesn't have that same effect on me. I don't know that i will ever be able to be friends with Eric. I don't really think that's a possibility and that truly sucks because I do love him. More-so then I have ever loved anyone in my entire life. It's a shame, but it is what it is and I need to accept it because as much as we do love eachother, he will never make me happy.
I need to stop ignoring Russell. 
I like writing in LJ again. I think I need to keep it up."

"event","I am in serious need of a computer. Not that I ever kept up with LJ when I was in constant contact with one. It's so interesting to me that I never post in this thing when I am emotionally involved with a boy. I always write during the short pauses that I take between them. Boys. Gag
I am over it. Dealing with a two-in-one failure as we speak. I don't even know what to say about either of them as of right now. The thought of number 1 is so dull and lifeless to me now that I can hardly produce any words about him. I honestly can't force myself to feel any form of emotion toward him, it's almost as if he's dead to me. Done. 
Number two is still somewhat fresh. Okay very fresh and I'm trying to deal with it. I am trying to deal with my mistakes and now dealing with his reaction to them. I adore him and I'm not mad at him, mainly becuase I have to right to be, but its an all to familiar subject. I'm not going to go through anything that has to do with that ever again. My vagueness almost confuses ME sometimes. What is honestly the point of a journal if you can't abandon your inhibitions in attempts to express yourself? Well whatever. 
Nonetheless it's hard to be friends with him. It's hard to act like it doesn't bother me. And he would never understand why it does. He would probably only concider the superficiality of it all and disregard where it really comes from. 
I have to fix Ben's hair. I need a damn computer."

"event","I don't even remember the last time I posted in LJ. Kinda crazy. Things have been getting pretty crazy in my life over the past few months. Everything is starting to settle though. 
First off, I finally quit that hell-whole job of mine. Didn't leave on the greatest of terms. That woman is useless. She's like some sort of emotionless machine sent to earth to obey her pompous husbands every command. It's a little disgusting. At first they seemed real cool about it. I told her that I was unhappy with the way they reacted to their three year olds consistant abuse when they were home and thta I really didn't agree with the way they did things in their house (in so many words), and they totally understood, or seemilngly so. I gave them a two week notice and they were appreciative and what not. And about three days went by and the agency that placed me with them called me to just give me a heads-up that they were going to inform the family that it was going to be difficult to find them a new nanny due to the fact that they are aware that there is a physically aggresive child in the house. Well aparently they didn't like that too much. On Friday, only 4 days after I put in my notice, they handed me a check and asked me not to come back. They said they could see I was no longer focused on the job (crock of shit) and that it would be best for them and for myself if we both moved on. So here's the kicker: Honestly I didn't really care that they didn't want me to come back, but when I asked to say goodble to Michael, the three year old, (who I absolutely adore and they know that) the bitch had the gaul to tell me that she didn't think it would be a good idea. She said that it was going to be hard on him because he is ""more attatched to you than he has been to anyone else who has taken care of him,"" (probably because I'm the only one in that house that does take care of him) and that they would rather tell him on their own. When I assured her that I wouldn't mention it to him and that I just wanted to say goodnight to him one last time she shook her head and said again, ""I don't think that's a good idea."" Horse shit. I cried the whole way home. Leaving kids that you've worked with day in and day out for 6 months is hard enough as it is, but for the mother of those kids to tell you that you can't even say goodbye to them is fucked up. These people obviously do not give two shits about the mental or emotional status of their children. It's fucking sad. Bitches still owe me five hundred dollars too. 
And then there would be everything else. There is so much I barely even know where to begin. Wes is out of the shower, we are going to have a drawing session. I'm doing a lot of nude modeling this week. It's kinda crazy.. but extremely liberating at the same time. I guess I can update later..."

FUCK YOU! where were you... obviously too wrapped up in your own world to realize what happens to people. You don't see me complaining.

There are things in life that really make you question the intentions of people that you love.

I need a change of pace. I need new faces. 
I am so sick of my environment right now. I wish I could just take a vacation and get away and come back to a completely different life. That would be great. I wish I could just dream up a life and wake up to it everyday.

"event","Gosh it's been so long since I've posted anything. It's been a real long time since I've written anything at all until recently. I find that the less I write the more numb I am to my own emotions. Writing makes it impossible to ignore my feelings and that's really what I need right now.
I am not okay right now. I am so confused and lost. Everything I want and need seems to far away that I feel like I can't even see it anymore. I feel so lost and alone right now.
Me and Eric broke up like 2 months ago or something. We've been doing the whole on and off thing ever since though and its killing both of us. I don't even know what to do about that. 
I've never been in love like this before. I am head over heels completely madly, deeply in love with him and its driving me to brink of insanity because I'm not so sure that he's good for me. He was actually really bad to me for a while and he knows it now and I know he's sorry. I'm not mad at him anymore. I guess when you really love someone there's nothing (well somethings maybe) that you don't forgive them for. 
The whole mindset that I have been in for the past 6 months because of this relationship has been so unhealthy it has been mentally and emotionally damaging, and as much as it feels relieving to be out of it I miss him so much. And I know he loves me and wants me back I think that we could work it out, but its like I almost don't want to risk feeling like that ever again. 
Since I've been with him I have lost sight of everything that I believe in. I looked on ""thegift"" LJ the other day for the first time in porbably a year and I was so amazed. And then depressed because I feel like so much time has been wasted focusing on things that were not good for me as opposed to the things that are. 
I don't even know what I want to do with my life. I have such a tendancy to grab onto other peoples dreams that I forget that I have any myself. I don't want to be one of those miserable people that look back on their lives and regret not doing what they really wanted to be doing or being who they really wanted to be. I know it takes work, but sometimes I don't know what I'm even working for. 
I have such an obsession with music. All I want is to be consumed by it. I have wanted to play the drums for years now and I always convince myself that its way too far-fetched to even make an attempt to do it. I think I have a fear of chasing my dreams. But being around SOMWHEREGON (Eric's band) has inspired me so genuinly that its all I want. I feel so good when I'm around them and their music. And I can only imagine how it feels to create it. I can only imagine. and I don't want to just imagine it anymore. I want to be it. And it sounds like it wouldn't be that hard, but it is, especially when you have no money to support an expensive hobby. I hate money. 
I just quit my job to go back to school this semester, mainly because I need a breather. I nanny on the side part time now so it makes me enough money to live at home and go to school. Honeslty I don't care too much for school. I may never even use the degree that I get. But I am so tired of working so hard all the damn time. It does nothing but cause me stress. I would much rather go to school for like 3 hrs a day, four days a week than work like anywhere between 40-55 hrs a week. It's just too much for me to handle right now. But then I get scared about spending all that money on school. Because when I get discouraged I am pretty much useless. If I don't feel like going, I won't. And that is such a rediculous waste. Education is like the only thing that people are willing to pay for and not get. 
Too much. Just too much right now. With Eric, work, school, family, friends, and everything in between, I feel like high school depression all over again I swear. Lost.... again."

"event","WHere can you find hope when it feels like its slipping through your hands? I pray and I pray and I pray... I suppose its not enough. I just don't understand the discomfort and insecurity behind this. (i know I'm being vague). 
Before I go into this let me express my gratitude for the life I have been given. (i have this new thing where I feel that I should say something positive before I say something even remotly negative... (please free these thoughts from my mind)).
I really do have the greatest life. I have a family that I'm really begining to become close to. A family that really wants to know me and what I stand for, they take care of me. They house me, feed me and take care of me whenever I need them. And now for family # 2, my friends. I have been blessed with some of the most amazing friends in the entire world, though I'm starting to feel like I may be taking my relationships forgranted.. something I don't want to do. (love can be so blinding sometimes). I have an awesome job where I just got promoted. I work with children day in and day out. I have the most amazing bonds with the most amazing creatures that God has ever created. Everyone I work with, all of my directors respect and appreciate what I do and how well I do it.... and I'm in love. I am unbelievably in love... I have been so blessed with love my entire life and for some reason I have this fear implanted in my brain that something is going to destroy it. I swear, that's how evil attacks me... through doubt. Because when I doubt the things in my life I begin to doubt myself and when you doubt yourself you can accomplish nothing. I just want to cleanse my mind of the negative thoughts that plague it. I'm tired of seeing the things that I see and feeling the things that I feel. I just want to believe in him and me and everything that this could really be. Its too perfect and that's why its bombarded with all of these tainted images. I don't want to feel like this so I refuse to continue doing so. 
God has showed me in so many ways how much he loves me and wants nothing but the best for me, so if we continue to work for him, he will continue to work for us. I believe in what this can be.... scratch that. I belive in what this is and all that it will be.
So after saying all of this I guess I don't really need to ask myself ""why"" I see the things I see and feel the way I feel because I now know where it's coming from and I will not let it take over MY thoughts and MY feelings. When I am strong you are nothing.
See I guess thats all it really takes to believe again... just putting more faith in God wiped out all of the negativity clustered in my mind and I am now filled with nothing but feelings of belief, faith and love. 
THANK YOU GOD"

I think i'm just fooling myself, honestly. I don't know what I'm thiking, but whatever it is, its starting to piss me off.

How can something bring you to the brink of insanity and summon you back to blissful intensity in an instant? 

Now I'm a little of course. That's not really how I feel.

Fuck. I'm pissed. I don't understand. I'm i really just being foolish? Why won't you just show me? Are you showing me something and I'm just not seeing it. I don't understand what's going on here. I really don't. I'm just being dumb. Letting myself go down that same old fucking path....

"event","A dream connection:

I went out with Ben the other night. We went out and had a few drinks with Travis and then we went back to his house and I helped him fix his dreads and then we watched a movie and went to sleep.

I had a bunch of dreams that night, but one of them really stuck out in my head:
   
   Ben and I went to this house where our friends
   were. It was a huge house on a big hill. We went
   inside and there were a lot of people there, but
   the only ones I remember really being there were
   Ben and Eric. Ben and I just sat and were talking
   to Eric. I got upset about something so Ben left     
   and went outside and waited by Eric's truck and 
   Eric and I went into a room and talked.
 
 I know, very uninteresting, but it was so vivid. It was so real...
   check this out:

Ben and I woke up at the exact same time and the first thing I said to him was ""Ben I had the weirdest dream last night"" 
Ben's response: ""I know, I was there.""
Okay, I think he's joking at this point
he continues with ""Eric was there too.""
He then proceeded to tell me most of the things I dreamt about, the house... him leaving to go wait by the car, Me and Eric going into a room.

he said in his dream he knew I was dreaming and he knew he was dreaming and Eric was there and Eric knew he was dreaming too. He said he talked to Eric (in his dream) and told him to realize he was dreaming and Eric said he already knew. And Ben wanted to make me realize it too, but Eric told him to just let me be and then Eric walked away with me.

I love when things like that happen. Unexplainable. 
It was funny too because the next day we went to the mall and we were talking about it, and right as we were leaving, in mid conversation about the dream, we hear someone shouting ""Ben,"" we turn around and Eric was walking up to us. 

I love seeing how people can be connected in little ways like that. I mean its not the first time Ben and I have had some weird dream connection, its just so cool when things like that happen."

"event","Now you've really got me confused. I really can't see what you're trying to show me. So I ask you again to show me in a way that I'll understand without question. Because this inconsistancy is taking me nowhere.

What are you really trying to tell me? One moment you put me in that place where I always want to be and the next moment, its like it never existed to begin with. I really don't understand.

Am I just not getting the point? Are you showing me things in their entirety? Am I truly blinded by what I want to feel. Why would you have brought me this to begin with if there was not some meaning behind it? You tell me there is meaning and when I think I see it and feel it, you correct me. 

Is that what you're trying to tell me, I wonder. Maybe the conclusions I keep coming to are falicies and you just keep telling me to look elsewhere. I just don't understand. I know you know the power behind this, you're the one that put it there. So now I ask You, what would you have me do with it?"

Leaving it in your hands. to teach me what i need to know and to give me what I need to grow.
Why am I so afraid, I wonder. I shouldn't be, but I am. Nothing scares me more than this. 

You always give me what I need, even when I don't want it. When I want the complete opposite you give me this and let me know that its a necessity. 

I thank you for all of the opportunities you've given me. Every experience has been worth it. Though I am shocked its come to this again. The intensity grows with every given situation and I am more afraid this time than I have ever been, but my vulnerabilty lets me know its real... that this is what you'd have me do. 

I'm overwhelemed with this. It's so intense I almost don't know what to do with it. So I'm waiting, curiously waiting to see what's to come and again I thank you for everything you have given me, for every breathe i breathe."

"event","Indeed it has been. Its been at least a few months. Things have been going pretty well, really well minus a few stipulations. 
John and I broke up. I have mixed emotions towards that. I feel better now that all of the energy that i was putting into the relationship is now centered on me, but at the same time i feel like I'll always wonder ""what if."" It's like that movie ""The Family Man,"" the irony behind that is how we always used to reference our situation (moving away from eachother) to that movie and now we're no longer together. I mean I know it's the right thing for this time in my life for the simple fact that I haven't been single for more than 3 months in the past 7 years and I'm only 20 (21 in 12 days woo hoo!) I need to give myself time to myself. I'm always putting my energy into a serious relationship and i don't have it in me right now. It's just hard cause I know how much this is hurting him and I love him so much that it really does hurt to not be with him and always wonder if i fucked with fate. But then I know that what is meant to be will be. I am a true believer in fate and i know that it will bring me to what is meant to be.
Wesley just left for Dallas again. He'll be gone for 2 months this time. He was home for a month. We didn't spend every waking moment together, like we should have, but I feel closer to him now than I have in a long time. i feel like we reconnected at a level we haven't in a long time. I adore him more and more with time. I feel truly blessed to have found him again this time around.
I moved into Sarah's parents house. She moved back there too. so now we live together. It's been really cool. We have our spats which is to be expected, but it really has been cool. I get along with my parents so much better when I don't live with them. My mom and I actually enjoy eachother's company when we don't live together.
I cannot wait to go to Ireland. We leave the 13th of December. i'm going with Sarah, her sister and her Mom. It's gonna be a very much so needed vacation.
Work is going well, but its stressing me out at times. I feel like I pick up a lot of slack there, but I've been getting lots of positive recognition from my directors and parents so i feel like it balances it. I really do love my job.
I go back to school in January. YAY FOR ME!! I can't wait. Depending on my job status by the end of this month I don't know if I'll be going full time or part time. i'm hoping to get this promotion so we'll see. I'm so excited to go back though. It's been way too long. I feel so uneducated. It's not the greatest feeling in the world. it really isn't. 
Financially right now, I'm kind of in a rutt, but nothing I can't get myself out of. So i'm not too worried about it. Just a lot of bills and bullshit that keep gettin in the damn way.
Things have been pretty damn great lately though. I had a bad day today. I cried a lot, but that's okay. The sun can't shine everyday. Some times we need some rain. And sometimes quite the opposite...it's been raining here for like 2 months straight. I love rain and all, but damn!
Well, time to shower, watch Monsters Inc. and go to bed."

"event","Why is everything so shitty right now, I wonder? Everything is so shitty right now. Every relationship I have seems like its run itself out. I feel like I have no more fuel left for the fire. Except for John. Eventhough things have been the shittiest with him lately, I know that I'm supposed to be with him for whatever reason. It's just so hard right now. It really is.

Preston had a keg party last night. I had such a good time. I can't even explain how great it was to actually go out and do something. There were so many people there. People I hadn't seen in like 3 years. It was nice to hang out with my friends. John and I had it out over that one too. wow. i'm so sick of it it's almost hard to comprehend the extend of my unhappiness with life in general right now. And I'm not even complaining. Yea, it sucks, but its not such intense suckage that its ruining me.

I started hanging out with Taylor again. It's theraputic in more than one way. We went jogging/walking for like an hour and 45 minutes last week and we just talked and talked and talked. It was great. When I got home I felt so much better. I usually do after talking to her and hanging out with her for a while. I'm glad I still have that. It's like a new friendship eventough we've been friends for like 7 years.

Why does everything run in circles. John and I just can't seem to get it together. We keep running back into the same wall over and over again. It feels like I just keep ramming my head into it. I'm sure he feels the same way too. I miss him. I hope everything works out for us. We're trying. We've held on longer and through more shit than most people have. I think he feels like he's the one doing all the work, though. It's frustrating.

I miss Wes. I wonder why I don't take advantage of the fact that he lives like right down the street while he's here. I wait till he's in New York fucking city to really need him. How frustrating is that?

There are some things I don't even want to get into right now. I need an outside source to talk to. Someone that doesn't know anything about anyone or anything in my life. I need a non-biased outside person to just vent to for like 24 hours a day. Maybe I should get like a counselor person or something. But than that makes me feel dumb. Like I have problems or something. Not that I don't.... I think the problem is that I can't talk to anyone without them judging me or other people or whatever. I feel like a fucking time bomb about to explode. I'm just kinda sittin around and waiting for it to blow up in my face, or somebody elses. Damn this is doo doo."

Why do I always find myself feeling like this when I'm here? I think I'm insane. Quite possibly insane. Things are just poo right now. I'm so glad Wesley is home... I require his words.
(your voice in the back of my head saying what YOU would say about this) I think I'm obsessive compulsive. I do belive so.  I also think I'm in love with a butt head.  He's in love with one too. But the butthead I love is more of a butt than the butt he loves.

I need to get my bed. I hve bruises on my arm. Why do I feel so insane right now? (and why am i always speaking on behalf of YOU all of the time... in my own head. GET OUT!) knowing people too well can really suck sometimes."

"event","BOREDOM. Now this is just getting rediculous. I have absolutely nothing to do. Lets start with all of the things that royally suck right now.

1. i have no money
2. i have no job
3. my cell phone service has once again been turned off
4. i have to be dead silent so i don't wake up the rents
5. i can't even go to a library and get a book (no out of state drivers licences accepted)
6. my car is screwed and if you refer to #1 you'll understand why that sucks.
7. classes don't start for another month
8. i don't even know if i'll be able to afford them
9. i feel like I have no friends anymore
10. i have nothing to do.
11. i'm an insomniac
12. I MISS MY BOYFRIEND
13. i'm cramped in a small room with white walls.
14. i hate smoking and haven't in over a week, but feel drawn to it b/c i have nothing better to do than just sit there and inhale harmful substances into my lungs.
15. i have bills to pay to wes ...*ahem* (#1)

Things that don't suck:
1. i'm no longer in florida
2. i'm alive
3. i have the greatest boyfriend in the world (although he lives in another state)
4. i have a place to stay till i get back on my feet
5. i'm getting along with the rents better than ever before.

Boredom is one of the most depressing things i believe a person can have in their lives. I literally have nothing to do. I can't spend money because I don't have any. I don't even like hanging out with people. Take today for instance. I went to john's for a little while and just sat around while john, ryan, and pat smoked weed and played video games. Now that's my kind of night... no, but seriously.. that's totally cool for them. That's just not my thing. It's like tennis... say you know someone and all they ever do is play tennis and you HATE tennis... would you go over and hang out with them if that's all they were going to be doing? Nothing against any of my friends, or anyone that smokes or whatever, I don't care what other people do, that's totally not my business, it's just the fact that I know that's what they do... day in and day out. I don't do that. It's honestly depressing to be over there. Literally, i just sit on the couch and watch them smoke weed and play video games. Nothing more, nothing less. 

I hate that people think i'm being critical and mean when I say things like that.... like I think I'm better than them. That's not it at all. I just don't do that anymore and therefor I'd rather be doing something else when I'm out and hanging out with my friends. It's not the fact that they smoke weed, it could be the tennis thing, it's the same idea, just different actions. I just wish I had more to do here. I wish I knew more people or at least had money to invest in new hobbies.

I have sarah, i know, and i love her to death, but something is off with us right now. I don't know. The other night we were at her house thinking of ideas for a movie that we're helping Angel out with. (we're acting, Angel is directing). And it was great. It was one of those things where energy was just flowing between us and ideas were just popping out all over the place. It got to the point where just me writing them all down wasn't enough and the two of us had to be doing it. THAT is the type of stuff I want to be doing all of the time. Things when you're done doing, you feel like you've accomplished something. I just need more things in life that make me feel like I am worth anything. It's odd. I was totally content with just sitting around ALL day with john and never doing anything, I guess just being his girlfriend gave me a tremendous feeling of self-worth to begin with... I mean, i did feel it sometimes, well actually a lot of the time... that I needed to be doing something, but now its amplified by like a million. I don't care what it is, just anything. I would even be content with drawing right now, but I have no paper and no markers or crayons or anything, and like I said, i can't afford to spend a penney on anything that I don't absolutely need.

I've noticed that some people (who shall remain nameless) have been saying shit like ""she thinks she's too good for us"" and blah blah blah... ""she ditched us"" and all that shit, well i have one thing to say to any of you that have said or felt that way recently 
                                   
                                    KISS MY FUCKING ASS!!!!!!!!!

The irony behind that... you think I'm judging you b/c I no longer do what i used to do, when really I don't care what you do, I just choose not to do it, that doesn't make me ""better"" or ""all grown up"" or anyhing of the sort.... YOU are the one judging me and what I do or don't do... suddenly I'm not cool enough or worthy of your time. Funny that b/c for some reason you think I think I'm better than you, you turn around and think that about me... like you're better than me. As I said before... well, you can scroll up and read it again if you'd like.
..........well.. goodnight = )"

"event","What a horrid day. I hate being a girl and I say that with a passion today. I really do not enjoy being a girl sometimes. The monthly monster returned for an unpleasant visit today as it had me lying in bed crying with agonizing pain for about 4 hours straight. nothing helps, i swear. I've been perscribed about 20 million different drugs to assist me with this and nothing works. I think I'm going to go to the doctor and get a pelvic sonogram or something. I hope everything is okay. I don't think pain this intense is normal. Maybe it is though.
Poor John, I made him sit on the phone with me for like 2 hours while i cried and whined and did all the stupid girl stuff. 
I haven't done anything or seen anyone in like 3 days. No desire. This is so strange. I still don't want to give anyone any amount of energy besides John.... and myself of course. All i want to do right now is go to school and make a lot of money. I created my dream car online tonight. A brand new Silver Jetta, 1.8l 5 speed, fully loaded. only 26,000. That's it!! It'll only take me 26,000 years to aquire it. I think I'm gonna find a huge picture of it and put it on my wall just to be a reminder of something to work for everyday when I wake up.
I miss my boyfriend. how aggrivating it must be to read those words on this journal day in and day out.
I'm just so in love with him. We were going through some really rough times for a little while there... and we made it through that, I know we'll make it through this too, so when its time for us to be together again, it'll be perfect and untouchable. I just miss him. I remember my aunt always telling me never to marry someone that I'm madly in love with... ""marry your best friend"" she always said... well that's to coolest thing about this relationship... I am madly in love with him and he is my best friend. I've never been more open, honest and comfortable with anyone as I am with him. There is nothing I can't talk to him about. He's so much different than I am too...  and as much as I sometimes hate that about him, I think its one of our greatest qualities as a couple. We learn from eachother constantly. I miss him. But I'm okay because I'm not worried. I KNOW we'll be okay.
It just sucks right now. I wish I could fast forward to the future and just be with him all the time.... poo."

I didn't wake up when he called. Have you any idea how shitty that makes me feel? I don't have the slightest clue as to when I may have the chance to see him next... and I didn't wake up when he called. 
He's not mad or anything... I just feel like shit. I've been feeling like complete shit all day. 
My mom has got to be the most insenstive person I've ever known. She always thinks I'm such a child whenever I am upset about anyhing... nothing is a justifiable reason to be upset in her mind. I think that's why I have such a tendency to supress unhappy emotions. Like I'm a mouron for feeling the way I feel.... or like I don't have the right to my feelings.

I just want to be with john. I went out to eat with Taylor last night and whenever she was on the phone making plans with her boyfriend, I felt like complete shit. All of my conversations with my boyfriend consist of lonely ""I miss you""'s and muffled speech... trying to hide it from him so he doesn't get upset. I really fucking hate this. I feel like I'm in high school allover again. Sitting in my room... crying and being upset and pissed off about everything... except this time I don't have the same escape. It used to be that I would just stay out all the time and do drugs to ignore what I felt and I don't have that.... I don't want that. I haven't done drugs in forever and I don't even like being out with the same people I used to.
I hate it here. But I think I'd hate it anywhere without John. At least its familiar here. I guess.
WHen is this going to end???"

I'm sure its just me, but it feels like his whole tone and mood change whenever I tell him I'm with someone. I hope its just me. He has no reason to be worried or uncomfortable or anything of the sort. I really hope he knows that.

I shouldn't have to feel guilty for doing anything. Nothing that I do is hurting me or him or anyone else... so than why do I feel this way? Is it becase I'm not used to doing anything away from him? I don't know what it is but its really starting to get on my nerves. I miss my boyfriend.... sigh"

its weird seeing everyone again. Nothing around here has changed and yet it feels so different. I don't even want to hang out with anyone. the only one i've been hanging out with is sarah. she's like the only person i know that doesn't sit around and get all fucked up all the time.
The first night i was here i went to a party at sarah's parents house and then we stopped by JP (sarah's brother)'s house for a minute and it was disgusting how nothing had changed. Just a big stupid ass frat party. we left like 2 minutes after we got there.
God I miss my boyfriend so much. i knew it was gonna suck but I already miss him this much and its only been a couple of days. I can't wait to see how shitty its going to get. 
I really hope I get a job soon and than I can afford to go to school and that should keep me busy. At least if I have money i can invest in some new hobbies. I just hate sitting on the couch in fron of the television being like ""uhhh. what do you wanna do"" ""i don't know, what do you wanna do"" ""i don't know""
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

"event","I had the most amazing conversation with Little Sarah tonight. It was one of those conversations that was overwhelmed with so much positive energy I felt like I was going to burst. I can't wait to go home and start this with her. 
.... and on the other hand. I've been so stressed out recently, wanting to get out of here. Weeks seeming like years, but now that its rounding the final stretch I'm getting sad. Leaving John is gonna suck so much more than I can really fathom right now. I can predict how hard its going to be, but that in itself is merely an understatement of what is to come.
Why this sucks:

Me and John have NOT been getting along as well as we usual do for over a month now (takes some adjusting to... from perfection to huh?)

We're not really leaving eachother by choice. He can't afford to come with me and I can't afford to go with him. This has been pretty much forced upon us.

He has been my life for the past year straight. I haven't spent more than a week away from him in the past year and a week away from him always feels like an eternity.

I don't know what's going to happen.
                                 ..... I think that's the worst of all of them. 

I'm not too worried about it because I know how much he loves me and I know how much I love him, but its still going to be hard none-the-less. 
So i guess I'm leaving this one out of my hands and putting it into the hands of fait. If we are supposed to stay together we will and I know that.... I have faith that we will. I think we can do it. I trust him, as hard as it is for me to do so, I really do. I know he wouldn't screw me over and cheat on me or anyhting like that. I guess what it really comes down to when its all broken down is that it just sucks. As does life at times. 

At least I'll be keeping myself productive 24 hours a day. I'm looking forward to all of the things I'll accomplish by going home, just not to what I have to sacrifice in the mean time. It'll all pay off in the end though.

Well I believe it is time for me to go to sleep. 

Weird. the original intent of this entry was to write about the awesome conversation I had with sarah this evening. I guess this stuff with john is really starting to seep out and hit me more than I had liked to admit in the past. 

I miss him already."

"event","I'm going back home. I'm out of my apartment on April 1st. Going home soon afterwards. I was gonna leave on the 16th, but may end up staying till the 26th only because that'll be mine and john's 1 year anniversary. It would kinda suck to leave like a week before that concidering we've been together almost everyday for the past year. I think I owe that day more justice than just a miserable phone call kicking myself in the butt wanting to be with him.

I'm excited. And not. My intentions are purely for my own benefit. I'm going back to school. I'm gonna work at Creme. I'm gonna get my masters degree in psychology. I'm excited to start my life.... again. 

Orlando has been an experience, probably the greatest one i have yet to experience... thank you wes for getting me down here and sticking around, even when I was a pain.  

John isn't coming with me... which was the original plan. He's going home to Detroit to spend some time with the family, which is respectable. It's gonna be rough on us, but I have faith. Things haven't been the greatest between us lately. I think we're both just frustrated with our current situations. We both want to get on with our lives and we're seemingly stuck in our own personal stalemates... taking it out on eachother. I think that when things get moving in both of our lives we'll be okay. He'll be moving to ATL at the end of summer. It'll be the roughest thing we have yet to endure, but as I said before... I have faith.

Wow! I'm going home. It's such a foreign desire. Ironically, now that I'm actually going back (instead of going back and forth with my decision.... sorry wes... again!!) I'm not looking forward to it for the same reasons anymore. I don't want a social life. On occasion, of course I don't see anyhting wrong with it as long as it doesn't interfere with what I need to get done. I'm looking forward to starting my side project with Ben though... I wanna play the drums =)

I should go to sleep. I have to work in the morning. I'm tired. 

ANd wes... as much as I know your hesitation upon returning to Atlanta... I'm glad you'll be coming home to me before you go off on your next journey!

And john as much as you hate this whole livejournal thing... I'm sure you'll be reading a lot more when I'm gone. I'm sorry for the oddness lately... we'll get through it. i love you regardless."

Never in my life have I been so determined to follow this. I'm finally just gonna say to hell with it and give up this whole procrastinating, lazy, careless lifestyle that I've lived for as long as I can remember. I'm no longer careless with things... I've impoved dramatically on the whole laziness aspect of life (getting up on time for work... actually working when I'm at work.... and always wanting to do shit.) I've aquired a deep feeling hatred toward the television. I hate it. When I have kids I don't think I'm gonna own a tv. 

Never in my life have I wanted something so badly before... I want to go back to school and go back and work with kids again. I cannot stand not being around children all the time. I need to be around them to be myself. When I'm around I'm in my element. I just want to support myself and acutally be proud of myself when I accomplish things instead of sitting around thinking ""yeah, that would be cool."" I'm so much more of a dreamer than a doer. But that will be no more. I feel like I'm doing more than an injustice to myself if I don't get off my ass and start doing what I know i need to be doing.

I'm bored of being bored. I wish I had a drum set that I could just jam out to right now. THat is another one of goals. Some day I will play the drums in a band and I'll be such a badass. cause I rule. yea! so there. =P

I need to start doing stuff with john too. I wanna learn how to edit movies and shit. He's always wanting me to shoot shorts with him and shit and I'm like scared. I don't really know why that is. I'm such a wuss... but more so with my own boyfriend than with people I hardly know. I don't know why I sometimes think that he won't think I'm good enough at something if I do it with him. I don't know why that is, but its always been that way. Even with like Wes... I've known him for 6 years and finally recorded a song with him like a few months ago. i'm a puss. It really sucks cause I know that I could learn a lot from Johh if I would just let him teach me. he gets really aggrinvated with it and I really don't blaim him cause I know I would too.

Think I'm gonna go read a book now. Let my mind escape its boredom for a while"

"event","The closer we get the more we grow apart cause now I'm starting to see you for who you really are. 
You do expect too much from everyone in your life. I just never realized it before... i think i was just blinded by the fact that there's nothing that I don't do for you. There's nothing that I wouldn't do for you and you know it, so therefor I'm not characterized as one of ""those people"" in your life. 
I read a conversation you had recently and it opened my eyes to what he's been telling me all along. Selfish. When I think of you... I think of that word ""selfish."" You expect people to drop their problems and their responsibility to cater to your self-inflicted wounds. You think people are wrong when they don't change their lives to make you happier for a minute. Do you ever think about us? Is what we need even remotely improtant to you. You. It's always about you. You would rather someone give up following their dreams for you than have them leave you behind to explore things they've wanted before you even existed. 
It's too bad that you've let them win. You think its cool to be fucked up. You think that it makes you different, when really you've just become everything you've claimed to hate since the begininng of time. You've let them win and now you are becoming them. You expect too much out of a world that doesn't care. The only person you should ever expect anything from is yourself... you just can't do it... so you place the blaim on other people when they're unresponsive to your beg and call. ""look at me... look at me"" Just like a puppy... except you're not as cute. You disgust me more and more with time. I no longer have sympathy for the things you do to yourself. ""it's not my fault"" It's a pitty that you think such thoughts because it is your fault and your fault alone. No one else could do to you what you've done to yourself. So continue on.. blaim it on everything that's happened to you throughout the coarse of your life. Hopefully someday you'll realize that it's you and not them. They are not what's making you do this.... But your belief in that just brings you closer to them. We didn't do this to you.
So now I walk away with no intentions. I no longer want you in my life."

"event","why is it inevitable that we should turn into our parents... not even our ""parents"" in a plural form.. why is it that we innevitably turn into the parent we most despise? Not to say that I still loathe my mother becuase that faded with the growth of some maturity. (I stress SOME) yet why is it that I have inherited these repulsive traits from her? Wes laughs at me innocently sometimes saying that I'm going to be just like my mother and i know he means no harm in it and I hate to admit it, but I am doing just that. How does one avoid the innevitable? I DO NOT WANT TO BE MY MOTHER.
I've had myself convinced at times that I could overcome what she could not and take a different path, but I'm beginning to question my confidence. It kind of reminds me of some disturbing movie I caught of glimpse of last night when Wes and Diane were watching it... about some guy who's extremely abusive and beats the shit out of his best friend constantly and his friend in turn starts beating his girlfriend. Where does it end?
I don't want my kids to look at me with such eyes of hatred and disgust. I always tell myself that I won't be how my mother was to me, but how can I honestly say that when I can't break some of her smallest, but ugliest habits. I don't blaim it on her although it may sound like that, she's just the continuation of an ongoing cycle that I'm sure has been repeating itself for generations. I don't want it anymore. 
""It stops here."" 
.......easier said than done. I feel like a have some evil mechanism implanted in my brain that comes out when it gets bored. Or hurt or scared, or whatever the hell it is. I really hate myself sometimes. I hate having this... this thing.... I don't even know what the hell to call it. It's me I guess, but I dont want it to be anymore.
I was mean as hell to John today. He came up to my work today and we were talking about some stupid technical shit and he was trying to explain something to me and I disagreed so I told him what I was taught on the subject and he pretty much made me feel like I was incompetant and knew nothing, not purposely of course (he doesn't like when people question his knowledge) so I let it go cause I didn't want to argue, but i told him not to talk to me in such a condesending tone and he sincerly apologized (he always has good intentions.. no harm done) 
... I got home from work and we got into another information conflict and he wouldn't listen to me cause he was being stubborn so I called him stupid...not just once, but a few times and it obviously hurt him cause he refused to talk to me after that. 
Why do I do that? Even when it comes to something that hits so deeply home with me... (I HATE when people call me stupid, to me that's more offensive than any meaningless words like bitch or cunt, not that you should ever call someone those things either) and even knowing how much it hurts me I say it to him as easily as I take a breathe.
And its not like I don't try cause I do. In comparison to how careless and mean I've been to people in the past I recognize improvement, but its still not enough. What must I do to rid myself of this? It's aggrivating. 
I will not turn into my mother. And if I do I will turn into the things i respect in her, not what I most despise and fear. 
Why can't that be the end of it. I've stated it now let it be. Yet I still feel it lurking. Barf."

Didn't do anything today. Just worked and took an accidental nap with John for like 4 hours and now I'm wired as hell and he had class at 1:00 so I'm not only wired, but bored too. I've almost doubled my cd collection withing the past few days. I have like 2 books full of cds. it's pretty rad. I wish I could write music. I can't wait until John brings his drum set down here, I love the drums. I think I'd make a bad ass drummer chic. I gots the rythym. I want to get more into photography and cinematography, unfortunelty all of these things require the one thing that I don't have enough of... money. i hate money. I need to find a better paying job, but in order to do that, i need to go back to school but in order to do that I need to save up enough money. Circles. Blah. My cd is done. time to let wes go to sleep.
**goodnight**"

"event","roomates are frustrating. And I hate the fact that I can't just write how I feel and let it be at that cause it never works that way anyway.....
Wes is driving me crazy. He's been pretty inconciderate lately. I know this is petty shit, but after a while of the same repetative petty shit... it eventually builds up and gets really annoying. When the dishwasher is full... he leaves piles of shit in the sink and doesn't even turn the dishwasher on... or when the shit in there is clean, he doesn't empty it. For the past week I've been emptying and refilling the thing. I clean up the messes that he leaves in the sink. Cause its common curdousy that when you empty the dishwasher, you refill it with the dirty dishes... NOT just yours... which my good friend Wes does... a lot. When he does refill it, like today (becasue I left him a note and asked him to) he refilled the dishwasher with HIS dishes and left mine in the sink, when I've been cleaning up his crap constantly for the past week. When I'm cleaning our apt. I don't leave his messes for him. If I'm cleaning I clean his shit up when I clean my shit up and he never reciprocates. Its getting really aggrivating. Last week he cooked dinner for me and John, so we cleaned up... the dishes, pots and pans, counter etc... the next night we cooked dinner for him and he put our dishes in the dishwasher and left the pans and pots and crap all over the counter for us to clean. He's been quite an inconsiderate roomate lately. And I wouldn't care so much but he's always bitching about how he hates when its messy and wants to try and keep it clean and that's exactely what I've been doing. But I'm not recieving much help. It's so aggravating. I just think its rude when you do something for someone out of common curtousy and they can't even return the favor. It's just annoying. I shall quit my bitching now."

"event","I'm so inconsistant with writing in my journal. I don't think I've written a word since I've been back. I bet my last entry was about how my boy is an ass... which he is not. We were having some jealousy/trust issues... not to say that we don't still have them, but we are currently working on them. I guess I can't really blaim him for being as paranoid as he is when it comes to me... I mean the first night I met him I told him that I was a bad girlfriend and that I had cheeted on my last boyfriend (of 3 years) and most of my boyfriends before him, which I'm not proud to admit... at all, but anyway... I guess I'd be a bit paranoid if he had told me the same thing. It just sucks cause I would never do that to him... I never should have done that to anyone... I made mistakes... young, ignorant, careless mistakes which I would never make again... and I know he KNOWS that but at the same time its hard for him to BELIEVE that if that makes any sense at all. We're doing better with it though. I think its especially hard for him cause the vast majority of my friends are all guys... that's the way its been my whole life and he's not used to that. I don't know. I'm sure we'll get over it. Wes has told me in the past that ""that'll never change,"" but I disagree.. I think it will eventually, just with a lot of patience and understanding. I'm good to him. I'm REALLY good to him and I know that. For the first time in my life I can actually say that and know that its true. He knows I am and he appreciates it. He shows me how much he appreciates it everyday. And vice-verca with him. I think the thing I love most about him is that he's not a boy. he's the first man I've ever dated. Anyway... 

Atl was aight. I had a good time actually. I spend most of my time with Sarah which was cool. It was nice to chill with her non-stop for like a week and a half. And I honestly think it was the first time I visited and there was no drama. Joe was home, but we didn't get to see eachtother. Neither of us really went out of our ways to contact eachother and that's okay. I don't neccessarily think we're ready to totally put the past behind us and really be friends and I'd like to hope that there still remains a chance for that sometime in the future. I did see Clay for like a split second and recieved the ""oh my god"" eyes. He didn't really look at me or acknoweledge my existance. I don't blaim him though. I wonder what he did for New Years.
We threw a huge ass party at Angel's new crib. It was awesome. Clay didn't come... which to me is a little rediculous, don't get me wrong, I'd hate anyone who did to me what I did to him, but I dont understand how you would give someone that much power over you.. so much that you wouldn't spend new Years with your best friends cause someone who hurt you a year ago was going to be there. There were at least like 40 something people there. He wouldn't of even had to see me, but whatever. I hope he had a good night anyway.
I still wonder about that sometimes. Does it still hurt him? Does what I did or the fact that I've moved on with my life hurt him... I don't know. I think I could imagine though. I mean if John hurt me like that I don't know if I'd ever really get over it. But on the other hand... John's not an ass hole. he doesn't treat me like shit... I was a dumbass to Clay. not to blaim it on anything but myself, but i was into a lot of stupid shit back then; Drugs, image.. i was young, and really naive and careless. I hope he finds a chick someday that restores his faith in love. Cuase I'm sure I did a pretty damn good job of messing it up. I still hit myself in the head when I think about it sometimes, but really what can I do? The only way I ever feel better about it is to be as good as I can be to John. Everytime I start getting shitty and bitchy like i used to be to Clay, I stop myself... or at least I try to. I'm not perfect, but I try my damndest.

So I'm home and no longer going to school. Not this semseter anyway. I'm trying to get a fulltime position at Best Buy. If I do and I stay with them for a year they'll give me $3,500 for school per semester. I miss going to school a lot. I hate not learning. It makes me feel dumb. i just couldn't afford to go this semester. I could have had my grandpa pay for it cause he offered to again, but I won't let him. I'm still too irresponsible to take that from anyone. 

Me, John and Danny need to start looking for houses. The three of us are planning on moving in together after they're done with school. That should be interesting. I think it'll work out. I mean I've lived with John for like 8 months now and Danny is so damn easygoing I think it would be hard for any drama to go down.
aaahh. I need to go create something. i've got mad creative energy right now"

I'm about to be so swered in so many ways. #1 my car is eating up up every dollar I have and I don't have a nice source of income to recover from it quikly. I just spend $750 on the damn thing getting it new tired, a re-allignment, new fuel punk. fuel filter... yadda yadda yadda. And now I need new brakes and a new alternator. Blah. And I still need like 100 for the rest of my bills this month on top of Christmas presents and the money I need to give my grandpa. Pah! I hate money. I spit on you. I'm not even sure if I'm gonna be able to go home for Xmas yet. Sucks. What a bitching entry this was.

We're thinking about getting a house. Me John and Danny... if we all decide to stay down here. That should be interesting. Nah I think that would be cool. If that happens I'm gonna get a puppy.

It's so weird to think that Wes is gonna be leaving in like 2, 3 months. Our lease is up in like 2 months. ANd than that's it. I'm not worried about him though, he's taking off.

We haven't put the finishing touches on it yet or anything, it's still cool though. I just sang back up vocals over him. It's kinda symbolic in this way... just when i sing and when I don't... it just fits over the lyrics...
I sing with him and then i just happened to fuck up on the part where it says ""everyone i know goes away in the end"" Not that it sounds like the heppiest thing, it is still symbolic to what's going on with us. I don't know. I'm about to go get some grub in this tum."

"event","I just talked to Preston. I haven't talked to him in forever. It's kind of weird to comppare life now as opposed to how it was a year ago. I rarely ever talk to anyone from back home... excpet for Sarah and Ben. I wonder how it'll be in another year from now. I don't really know how i feel about it. A pretty big part of me still wants to move back home in a few months... but another big part of me wants to stay here with John. But i don't like it here. I really don't. I'm bored of it. But I guess that's my fault. I don't do ANYTHING. I sit in this aparment all day bitching about how I never do things. I want to go to school more. All I ever do is work and sleep it feels like. I've been fighting with John a lot recently. It's my fault of course. I dno't know where it came from... it's seems to be out of nowhere. I don't know why. I'm such an aggresive person. I love confrontations. I love arguing with people. Sometimes we have these little pretend arguments just to let some of my aggresion out... and that usually works, but recently I've been kinda crule. I don't know why I like getting peoples reactions like that. It upsets him, and then I always feel bad. I don't know how he handles me as well as he does in those moments. I mean they're rare, but they seem to be becoming more frequent than before. I think I just need a hobby or something. I need something. I feel like total ass right now. I think its due to a lack of productivity. I just need to do more things, but ""more things"" require more money... somnething that I don't have enough of to begin with. I just need to get my priorities straight and keep them that way. Need to go to shcool and work both full time and give myself like one day off a week just to myself so I can relax. Too much time off from things makes me feel like doo doo. 
SHould I stay or should I go now? I want to go home. And I reallu don't even know why. Wes told me that he thought I'd be crazy if I left John. i think he's right, but I think that at any rate I'm going to regret what I do. And I don't want that. i don't want to move to Michigan though. If he stays here I'd probably stay with him, but if not,... I don't really know what would happen. We both say that regardless of where we end up physically that we'll try and work things out and stay together, but c'mon, how long can that possibly last? I guess I shouldn't prejudge the situation so much, but I hate these... DECISIONS, I hate decisions cause I hate having to comitt myself to one thing or the other, I always want both. Poop, I don't know what to do. I still have some time to decide. I think my lease is up in like February or something so if I decide to stay i'd move in with John, if I decide to go... I'll go. You know what? I dno't really think I want either of those scenerios. I think i want to move somewhere far away from here.... alone and without anyone that I know, With no one from my past. But at the same time I dno't really think I'm ready for that. ANd my time will eventually come for that anyway. I'm just bored with life now, I'm so uninspired. and I hate that feeling more than anyother in the world. I hate television."

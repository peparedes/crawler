"event","<font color = orange><font style = tohma> after coley stayed the night at my house for three days... we went to her house!!
Friday-We got up at 8:45 and coley's mom picked us up and we went to scotts camp thing. that was pretty fun. [[hott counclers]]! then after that we walked to coley's house and celebrated mikes birthday.  Heather came over to coley's for a little while but then she had to leave and around like 8:30 megan came over and then we both stayed the night at coley's house!! We slept on the trampoline that mike got for his birthday.  that was sweet. and christ came out side with uss for like a few hours...[[megan your soo funny]]. while we were out there we got rained on like twice. but w.e! 

Saturday-Megan left at like around 9:00am and right when she left me and coley fell asleep until like noon. we didnt really do much that day... we were reallyyyyy tired. 

Sunday-Me and coley were on the trampoline talking to becca and taylor and then megan came over again. She wanted to meet tyler so she saw him and we kinda hungout with tyler and christ for a little while. then at about 6:00 megan went home :(!! At about um... 12:00 coley fell asleep and so me and ashley and christ were upstairs online but then christ went home. after he went home me and ashley were going to go sleep outside on the trampoline her cousin called and told uss that there was a cyco killer on the loose!! ahhh we were so scared. At like 7:00 we went out on the trampoline because we got tired. and we needed a blanket so i went down stairs all alone and i was looking around and then all the sudin somthing was like moo moo moo moo moo... and i wa ssoo scared i ran reallyyyyy fast up the stairs..[[tripped hah]]. outside. Yeah. then me and ashley fell asleep! the next day....

Monday-coley told uss that the hole story about the killer was not true. OMG! yeah but anyways... That night first me and coely were talking to becca and taylor and then christ,tyler,and troy. got home from bowling adn taco bell. haha. then ashley came outside.and we all hungout in the driveway...[[there is grasss in my crack..COLEY you are soo funny]]. Then becca and taylor went inside so me, coely, ashley, tyler, and troy all went on the trampoline. god i was like falling every two seconds! Every onece and a whiel christ would come out side then he would go back in. Tyler, coley, me, ashley, troy, and christ were outside till like 2:30 when christ's mom yelled at tyler and christ to come inside! booo. Then me coley adn ashley all went inside and fell aslepp in ashley's room. 

Today-We woke up at like 12:00..well me and coley did anyways. At like 1:00 there grandpa woke ashley upp adn then coley took a shower while me and ashley went to the store to get DOUNUTS && MOUNTIAN DEW! Then at like 5:30 we walked to scott's house... [[allthough he didnt know we were going to show up]]. we stayed there till like 8:30. Then We all walked back to coley's house and we jumped on the trampoline for like 10 min.s then we walked scott half way home. On the way home we saw [[my fav. person]] Nick Linstruth. w.e! Now we are here just hangingout.

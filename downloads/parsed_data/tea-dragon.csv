"event","We closed on our old house yesterday- wahoo!  I don't ever want to move again.  Ever.

Some highlights of the process:

When our real estate agent discovered that a board on the front porch (under the welcome mat) had rotted by putting his foot through it.  Note to self- do not put a rubber mat on a wooden porch.

When the inspector for the buyer opened the door to the attic and a mama raccoon snarled at him.

When the pest control guy came the next day to remove the raccoons and found that the mama had, very sensibly, chosen to move out on her own.

The fact that Sarah brought home lice from school not once but TWICE in the last several months.  (I've never seen lice before, and discovered them when I was coming Sarah's hair and saw one move!  AAAHHHH!) If you haven't had the pleasure of dealing with lice yet, let me just say that getting rid of them basically requires cleaning every square inch of your house and spending hours combing their hair every day for two weeks.  If you want to be sure of getting rid of them, anything that can't go in the washing machine and dryer on hot has to be bagged up in plastic for two weeks.  Pack.  Unpack.  Pack.  Unpack.  Lather, rinse, repeat. However, the upside is that when you pack up all the soft toys there is a lot more room to walk around here!

The time when the sink in our new house BENT AND CAME LOOSE ON ONE SIDE.  Some idiot (probably the previous owners) had attached it to the cabinets and the wall using GLUE and some small pieces of peg board, instead of making a plywood frame to mount it on properly.  Our contractor couldn't stop shaking his head.

The dishwasher in the new house stopped in the middle of the cycle about a month after we moved in.  I died of sticker shock while buying a new one, and I didn't even let R. get the most high tech one he could find.

But hey, Sarah is close enough to her school now so that she's riding the bus and I don't have to drive two 45 min. round trips each day to drop her off and pick her up.  Sammy got into Sarah's school and will be starting Kindergarten in the fall.  R. only has to take one bus to work, and it only takes 1/2 hour.  So if I ever finish all my home improvement projects, I'll have lots of time on my hands for playing around on the internet, right?"

"event","So, we're in the middle of piles of moving-related craziness.  Two lovely contractors have been finishing an attic for us to use as an office, adding a half-bath, and replacing all the ancient galvanized pipes.  They were scheduled to finish by the end of Feb., but just told me today they expect to be done by Friday night.  Hooray!  Soon I will not be trying to live in two houses!

Problem is, I've been trying to get several rooms in the new house painted before we move and my deadline just moved up a week!  Tomorrow I have to put the top coat on the new bathroom so they can install the toilet and sink, paint the trim before they install that, and paint the wall behind the toilet in the other bathroom before they can put the toilet back in.  Considering I've been averaging about a wall a day, it's time to seriously begin to panic.  So, of course I'm writing this instead of washing paintbrushes. (For extra fun, the water is off at the new house so I have to drag my brushes home to clean them.)

The kids have this week off from school- great because I don't have to be a chauffeur, not so good because I have to bring them with me while I'm painting. Today I brought everything I could think of to keep them happy and occupied while I got some painting done in the tiny bathroom.  Chocolate chip almond scones! Markers and a huge roll of paper!  Soft things to build forts and nests out of! I spent half an hour getting them settled, but they still ran around chasing each other and screaming their heads off.

After I finished the bathroom I let them help put primer on in Sammy's room. They both managed not to step in the paint tray (Sammy put a foot in one this past weekend), but it was still pretty hairy. Sarah had trouble remembering not to overload the paintbrush so she dripped all over, but it mostly stayed on the drop cloth.  Neither one of them painted me, so that's a plus :)

Driving home I was feeling pretty frazzled, as evidenced by this conversation:

Me:  (Mostly joking) You know,I'm considering leaving you by the side of the road if you don't stop fighting in the car.

Sarah: Then we'll go to the nearest person and report you to the police!

Me:  Then they'll take you away from me and I can get some painting done!

Sarah: But then they'll put you in jail!

Me:  Hmm, that sounds very relaxing.

Sammy: Then you'll paint the jail!  

(She pauses for thought) Pink!

Me: *Cracks up completely and feels much better, thanks.*"

It has better sized rooms and a better yard.  Also gorgeous colors and a bigger living room.  The location is a 20 min. bus ride for Roland to get to work, with only one bus.  Not to mention, $69,000 less!  There are clearly little kids living in the houses on either side and there's a K-8 private school across the street.  This means instant community :)!  Sammy may end up in a different school than Sarah or Alec, but she is eligible for busing if I can't make it from one school to the other in time.  However, I think the start times are staggered enough that I can do both and it's possible that Sarah will be eligible for busing too.

I'm holding my breath- we're going to write an offer today!"

"event","Seattle's public school system used to have a cool program that let parents help choose which school, citywide, to send their kids to.  You put down your choices, in order of preference, and their computer figured out which kids go where. Waiting to see which school you got in to was nerve-wracking, but at least incoming siblings were guaranteed to attend the same school as their older brother or sister.  Riding the bus was only for kids within a certain distance of the school, but if you were willing to drive, your child could go anywhere.

Not anymore.  In an effort to keep costs down, deal with overcrowding in some areas, and apparently because their computer is getting old (really!), it has been decreed that kids will automatically be sent to their neighborhood school. Furthermore, the boundary lines for the schools will be redrawn.  There will be a few open spots at each school that you can apply for, but the competition will be fierce and at this point SIBLINGS ARE NOT AUTOMATICALLY PLACED AT THE SAME SCHOOL!

I chose a school for Sarah that is in another area than our local school, thinking that Sammy would go there too.  Now, since the boundaries have been re-drawn, our ""neighborhood"" school has switched to one much farther away from our house.  It's been closed since 2002, but they're re-opening it.  It's going to take them a year to get it ready for students, and in the meantime Sammy would be sent to another school even farther away from our house and in the wrong direction from Sarah's school.  I think it would take me about 45 minutes to drive from one to the other in bad traffic. The other problem is that it would be really hard on Sammy to have two schools in two years.

This WILL NOT WORK!

We planning to move, and I am not at all happy about it.  I like our house, and I've put a ton of work into it.  I love our neighbors.  I hate that I haven't finished making my garden/taming the yard.  If we have to have it professionally done in order to sell the house and I don't get to enjoy it I will be very pissed off.  

I also hate the uncertainty of juggling buying and selling.  I hate that the real estate agent just hinted strongly that we'll need to put a lot of our stuff in storage in order to make the house attractive to buyers (because they might not have young children and we're not projecting the right image).  I hate that, in order to get this done before school registration begins, we have to start now. As in, we'll probably still be showing the house in December.

Is it worth it?  I do have the option of switching Sarah to Sammy's school, but then she would have third, fourth and fifth grade in different schools.  I could also put Sarah in before and after school care and make R. do pick up and drop off for her.  I could put my kindergartner on the school bus and hope that the timing works out right.  I could cross my fingers and pray that we'll make it into one of the open slots for Sarah's school.  Or we could move.

Points in favor of moving: 

Sarah's school is much better than the one Sammy would be in; the middle and high schools in that area are much better too.

We're looking at moving into R's brother's neighborhood, so they would be within walking distance of their cousins, and maybe even within walking distance of the school.

I wouldn't have to spend so much time driving!!

If I'm lucky the new yard will be already tamed and the house will have more storage space.

If I box up a ton of toys, there will be so much less to keep tidy!

This time we will probably not move everything in the back of the car, bit by bit, like we used to do in college.  We will also not have to drive a rickety old u-haul across country and over a mountain range.

What would you do? Advice and general kibitzing welcome."

"event","It's nearly summer- bring on the weeds, I can take it!  This weekend we did a ton of yard (overgrown jungle) clean-up.  It was very satisfying- boy do I love my hedge clippers!  There is no better cure for frustration then hacking things up- bwa ha ha!

The great thing about pruning is that it produces such visible results, and the plants *stay* trimmed.  No small people come along and put the branches back on!  Sarah did, however, use buttercups and the morning glory vines that I pulled up to ""decorate"" our apple tree.  It now looks like it belongs in a swamp in Louisiana.  

Sammy occupied herself by making mud stew and stirring it with a stick taller than she is.  She looked a bit like she was churning butter :) This morning I have plans to channel her cooking energy to bake muffins- mmmm. (We'll be leaving out the mud, thanks.)

I also wanted to share a really yummy recipe R. made last night. http://www.recipezaar.com/Egyptian-Fava-Bean-Dip-Foul-Mudammes-9154

R left out the cayenne so the kids would eat it, and substituted a sweet potato for the potato because we had one in the fridge. He also said that next time he would add the spices with the garlic.  The kids loved it! Yay!

Finally, for your amusement- I walked into the living room yesterday and saw six naked barbies lined up on the windowsill, mooning our neighbors. 8 year-old installation art?"

"event","My Grandpa Ted is an amazing, wonderful, loving man.  He's 98, and is still living at home.   He's at the point where he can no longer be alone in the house, so my Mom and her four siblings have been taking turns going to stay with him, even though the closest one lives a two-hour drive away and two live about six hours away.  They don't want to put him in a nursing home unless they have to.  His spirit is indomitable.  He still plays cribbage and beats everyone.  Two years ago he had a fall and had to walk with a walker, but he came back from that. A few weeks ago I heard that his arm was weak so he was doing arm curls with a soup can to exercise the muscles. 

We had an enormous family gathering at Thanksgiving, requiring three large turkeys and a church hall to feed everyone in.  He's the center that connects all of us. Grandpa's 99th birthday will be on March 23.  All of his fourteen grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren have been getting ready to visit or making cards to send, from as far away as Germany.

But today I found out that he's just gone into the hospital with pneumonia. Two of my aunts are there, and Mom plans to be there on Saturday.  I'm sitting here kind of stunned, sad, and worried. I'm wishing that I had gotten cards in the mail sooner. Maybe he'll be fine, but pneumonia in someone that age is NOT GOOD.  I'd always assumed Grandpa would live to be a hundred- his father died at 105 and his sister turned 100 this year.  Maybe he still will, but I'm already feeling a hole in my heart."

"event","Sarah is spending most of her free time lately with her nose in a book.  My work here is done now :)  She's reading several at once, one of which is the last Harry Potter.  She skipped the rest of the series, and has declared that she's going to read it backwards.  Contrary child.  She's zooming through the Little House on the Prairie books, which I'm enjoying as well- there are so many details I had forgotten.  Like the story of Ma slapping a bear!!  

Also, Sarah would like you to know that she finds her sister very very annoying.  Hmm, some work left to do I guess.  Still they are playing together much better now than they used to.  Right now they are upstairs playing dress-up, which usually involves Sarah putting some ridiculous outfit on Sammy. 

Yesterday Sammy noticed an old bicycle tire hanging in our garage and asked what it was.  I told her it was a spare tire from R's bike that was stolen out of our garage a few years ago.  Oops.  Since then she's been grilling me about ""fiefs"", and why would anyone take our bicycle.  Would a small fief take her tricycle?  I've been trying out various explanations, since nothing seemed to satisfy her.  Maybe the fief needed it.  Yes, there was probably only one fief.  Well, not everyone is nice.  Yes, we were silly to have left the garage door open, and we are more careful now.  Some people don't have as much stuff as other people, and some of them might get angry and take things.  This one made since to her, as it resonated with the whole sharing toys concept.  She thought about it for awhile and said, ""I will build a house for the fief family.  For the big fiefs and the little fief.  Out of wood.  And I will build a tricycle for the little fief.  Out of wood.  It will take a lot of wood.  Maybe I will have to be bigger.  And I will buy a new bike for Bebo!""  

(Bebo is the nickname that Sarah made up for R.  Yes, it is embarrassing when I use it in conversation in public places.  We've gotten some funny looks.  But R. loves it.)"

"event","Can I tell you how much I love my new anti-seizure medication?  We've had quite a stressful week around here, culminating in a very stressful day, and yet I've been pretty cheerful and mostly calm all day.  I feel like the old me, before the zonisamide that made me the cranky mom from hell.

So, here's what I'm dealing with right now, because I just need to vent it somewhere!

We were woken up this morning by Sammy, who crawled in bed with us at 4:30 AM.  I spent half an hour being squashed in the middle before giving up and waking up enough to put her back in bed.  I went downstairs to get a drink, only to find that the reason she'd gotten up was that: 

My sister in law went into labor today, at about 4 AM, and they had been calling us to ask if my husband could come and babysit my 3 year old nephew until his daycare opened.  No one heard the phone except Sammy because we had a hepa filter running on high in our room, and R. left his cell phone downstairs to charge.  My cell phone was in the room, but they didn't think to call me.  R's brother showed up at our door with our nephew 5 minutes after I got the message- poor N had to drive herself to the hospital!  Apparently she wasn't sure it was the real thing and didn't want to wake her son up and drag him to the hospital for no reason, but I still feel like a jerk for not hearing the phone.  She did wind up having a C-section; both mom and baby are fine.  (And she's awfully cute too!)

The hepa filter was running because we stirred up tons of dust last night moving furniture around.  The carpet cleaners were here today, and did the whole house.  I was up until 1:30 finishing as much as I could without blocking access to the shower, one potty and the refrigerator.  (Do you know how hard it is to get ALL your stuff off the floor at the same time when you have carpet everywhere but in the bathrooms, the kitchen, and the entryway?)

The carpets were being cleaned today because R's parents will be here on Thursday, and their house is always immaculate.  I cannot even begin to sustain immaculateness, but when they come to visit I like to put on a good show for a week. (Why yes, I did clean my room as a child by kicking things under the bed, why do you ask?)  I suspect I'm probably not fooling anyone, but it's a handy form of spring cleaning; we'd never get around to doing most of this stuff if we didn't have a deadline.

My plans are being hampered by the fact that our washing machine is on the fritz- the last load produced a burning smell during the spin cycle; not a good sign.  The Sears repair man is scheduled to come on Friday, but I'm hoping to find someone who can come sooner.  (I did use this as a teaching moment though-  I hand-washed a bunch of underwear and washcloths to tide us over, and had Sarah help.  Then I told her it might be a long while before the washer was working and could she PLEASE not change her clothes three times a day?)

Sarah's been sick since Thursday.  The only symptom, other than poor appetite, is fever- it swings back and forth from nearly normal to the worst being 104 on Saturday night at 2 AM.  I took her to the doctor on Monday and of course she acted completely healthy while we were there.  She said that if Sarah still had a fever tomorrow morning to bring her back in for blood work, which will make Sarah very unhappy; needles make her scream and hide behind things.  I shall have to reward her with donuts afterwards or maybe during.  I'm hoping it won't come to that though- last night her fever wasn't high and today her appetite was back and she had a lot of energy from noon until 4, but then she crashed until 9 and her temp was back at 101.4.  I need to call her doc. in the morning, and her school to say she won't be there.  The silver lining is that boy, can I ever get a lot done when I don't have to drive her to and from school AND she's too sick to make much of a mess.

Sammy's last day of preschool before the summer break is tomorrow.  Any bets as to whether I manage to drop her off at 9, or at all?

Whew, I feel much better with all that out of my head.  Thanks for listening!"

"event","My sister-in-law is 37 weeks pregnant, and the baby is transverse, ie, laying sideways instead of head-down, in the worst possible position for delivery.  Normally this results in a c-section, because without one it can be very dangerous for both baby and mother.  N. would rather not have a c-section, if possible, so tomorrow she has an appointment with a perinatologist specializing in high-risk pregnancies to try and turn the baby into the head-down position.  The baby will be monitored for distress the entire time to make this as safe as possible, and they'll also be ready to do a c-section immediately if necessary.  I think the success rate of doing this is only about 1 in 3; sometimes they stop trying due to fetal distress, sometimes it brings on labor, sometimes it damages the placenta and requires an immediate c-section and sometimes the baby just flips back again afterwards.  Please keep your fingers crossed, pray to your favorite deity if you do that sort of thing, and send good thoughts.  Tomorrow I may have a new niece, but hopefully the turning will be successful and I'll have to wait to meet her just a little while longer!"

"event","Our old dentist's office wasn't very kid-friendly, even if they did have a tv in the waiting room playing ""Toy Story.""  The first time I took a kid in there with me (in a stroller) so I could have an appointment, (can't remember WHICH kid) they screamed their head off at the sight of Mama getting stuff done to her, and we had to leave early.  Sigh.

However, my sister-in-law recommended her dentist's office to us, and it's AWESOME.  All the dentists and hygienists are women, and most of them seem to have small children too.  The hygienist I had today talked to me about pumping for her 7mo old while she's at work- hmm, she must be the same one I saw last time, because that time she was due any day now.  The waiting area has no TV (thank GOD) but does have a bookcase with lots of cool stuffed animals.  (Chicken!  Baby chick!)  It also has two kid sized chairs, blocks, puppets, gorgeous hand-made crewel embroidered pillows on the adult chairs, a treasure shaped box with trinkets for the kids to pick from after their appointments and receptionists who didn't bat an eye when Sarah was last in and built a stuffed animal hotel out of the chairs in the middle of the room.  My living room should be this comfy.  

Sammy watched with great interest last month while Sarah had her appointment, then got to choose a toy.  Today was her turn, and mine too.  R. was suppose to be there to babysit, but forgot to put it on his work calendar, and couldn't make it because he had a meeting.  So I was more than a little nervous about how this was going to go.

I prepared as best as I could.  I packed non-messy snacks, of the not-too sugary, don't embarrass yourself in front of the dentist variety.  I brought a princess color-wonder coloring book that she hasn't seen since the last time we were on an airplane.  We also brought ducky and blankie and her favorite scrunchie, without which we go nowhere.  I reminded her what Sarah's visit was like, and told her I would only be able to make funny noises while they were cleaning my teeth, just like she can't talk while we're brushing her teeth.  I told her that she would get a turn to see the dentist too, and that then she'd get a chance to choose a toy, just like Sarah had done last time.  (This made a big impression.)  I asked whether she'd like me to go first.  (Oh, yes.)

Guess what?  It went so well I can't even believe it.  (Except the part where I get to go back later and have five old fillings redone because there are micro-fractures in my teeth.  Which my old dentist never did anything about and/or caused, I'm not sure which.)

They were ready to see us within 5 minutes of our arrival.  We had time to find the chicken and the baby chick, then we went back to the other room and got started.  I settled Sammy in the corner where I could see her, and gave her a wooden stool to use as a nest for the chicken.  I laid out the snacks and coloring stuff on the floor.  She proceeded to snack and play happily.  She calmly stood in the hallway, when requested, while I got some x-rays taken.

Sammy needed to go potty while I was getting my teeth cleaned and the hygienist A. heard her say it when I didn't, and B. calmly led her to the bathroom and assisted her.  By that time Sammy was so comfortable that she let them do her first dental exam, cleaning and fluoride treatment WHILE I WAS STILL IN THE OTHER ROOM.

No fussing.  No whining.  No crying whatsoever.  By the time we finished doing paperwork and choosing the treasure, we had been at the dentist's office from 11:00 until 12:30.  She tucked the chicken and the chick in before leaving, asked me to put the treasure box back up where it belonged, then happily left.  She said she had FUN at the dentist and you know what?  So did I!  I should be in one of those credit card commercials.  The dental work I need done is probably going to be a bit spendy.  But this?  Was PRICELESS."

"event","I can has a new neurologist :)  (OK, I've been looking at LOLcats too much, but they're fun!)

And he is not a jerk like the last one.  Who made me wait in the waiting room for 45 minutes after my appointment was supposed to start and THEN made a phone call (not about my case) in front of me before talking to me.  Dude, better to have let me sit in the waiting room a bit longer.  It was the last straw. (My reaction, in case you're wondering, was to glance at the intern, who was observing that day, in disbelief, and then to pick up my cell phone and call R. to say loudly, ""Honey, I think this is going to take a little longer than I thought.""  

Better yet, I have a new kind of medication for my epilepsy, which the new guy convinced me to try (in spite of the 1% chance of it causing a fatal rash) by calmly assuring me that the rash is only fatal in people who ignore the warning signs and KEEP TAKING IT.  Okay then.  My other concern was that the transition period, in which I get to take both medications simultaneously, would suck and I'd be too out of it to function.  However, it turns out that the new one is an anti-depressant as well as being an anti-seizure drug and it should counteract some of the side effects from the first drug.  (difficulty concentrating, a tendency to space out and drive somewhere I wasn't actually meaning to go to, getting extra snarly at my kids, that sort of thing).  The old neurologist had mentioned trying this drug a couple of times, but never with any helpful advice; he only gave me two lists of scary side effects and told me to pick one to try.  Basically, I was my own guinea pig, and he was just there to write the prescriptions.

It will be 10 more weeks before I'm up to full strength on the new med; apparently if you ramp up slowly you're less likely to develop the rash.  I'm feeling more cheerful already, though it could be from a variety of causes.  Possibly it's just a placebo effect, maybe it's because I'm feeling hopeful, maybe it's because I'm finally over my sinus infection/allergies and I can BREATHE again and maybe it's because I've been out in the sun gardening a lot, who knows?  Whatever the reason, I laughed today.  Several times.  And once, when Sarah was being irritating (as usual), instead of getting mad, I realized how cute she looked and hugged her.  And when the noise level of the kids playing/squabbling started to really bug me and I noticed I was getting more and more tense, instead of getting mad, I PUT ON THE HEADPHONES and listened to music until I calmed down.  And they sorted themselves out without my interference.

Hmm.  Something tells me the anti-depressants are working.  Now if I can just keep from getting the scary rash..."

"event","This past Sunday we were trying (fruitlessly) to buy a few extra minutes of sleep by letting the kids crawl in bed with us after they woke up.  After bouncing around a bit, Sammy looked at my digital clock and announced, ""Mama, I don't like the way those numbers move on your clock!""  I sleepily mumbled something along the lines of, ""Well, honey, if they weren't moving it would either mean that the clock was broken, or that time stood still, and we wouldn't want that, would we?""  She paused for a minute to consider this, then shot back with, ""But Mama, I didn't know time had feet!""

In other news, we were trying to sleep in because on Saturday night we actually (cue the fanfare) had a real date!  We went to the Triple Door and saw Glenn Phillips, the lead singer from the band Toad the Wet Sprocket, who has just a beautiful voice.  The opening act was a local guy named Jonathan Kingham who I'd never heard of before- he turned out to be a total blast.  Not only talented, but hilarious and sexy enough to look good in purple clogs.  If you get the chance to see either of them, go for it.  Yay, music! My face hurt when we went home from smiling non-stop.  

The Triple Door is a great place for concerts because it's also a restaurant.  It's owned by the same guy who runs Wild Ginger (which is a famous local restaurant)- the food was amazing.  We had beef satay with mango dipping sauce, salmon wrapped in banana leaves, curried pork with mango and crepes, and maple flan to die for.  R. is a genius for knowing that we should arrive early and eat before the concert started- I couldn't have done them justice simultaneously.  I will be scoping out the concert line-ups for my first chance to go back!"

"event","More ups and downs.  R continues on his cleaning binge- last night he sorted out his half of our closet; packed away summer clothes, bagged up things for Goodwill, and put really old things in with the cleaning rags.  I'd be wondering what's gotten into him, except I know he's been reading some business self-help book called ""Getting Things Done"" :)  So far the results are impressive, I may need to swipe it and read it myself!  Yay progress!

Sammy woke up from her nap yesterday with a fever.  I was nervous that it was going to turn into the stomach bug Sarah JUST recovered from (she just went back to school today), but it seems to be something different.  She's complaining about a sore throat, but no sign of throwing up.  Still, it meant we had to miss preschool again today.  Then while I was in the kitchen getting her breakfast she decided to climb on the back of the couch and she fell off, so now her left arm hurts.  She didn't cry for long, and she's using it, so I don't think it's broken, but it's worrying nonetheless.

Sigh."

"event","I've officially gone stir crazy- we've all been taking turns being sick since early December.  The only thing worse than being the chief housekeeper and babysitter is doing it when various people, including you, have been ill.  (Sarah has the unfortunate habit of running to us when she wakes up feeling sick, rather than to the bathroom, with predictable results.)  Really, winter could be over any time now, it would be fine with me.

Yesterday was better though- it was warmer, and not raining, and I actually did some yard work.  My midwestern brain is still a bit in shock that I can do gardening in February, but some of my ground covers are even blooming and there are little green shoots coming up all over the place.  The perennials I planted last year all seem to be doing well- hooray!  

My next yard improvement project is to decide whether I want to put in decorative flowering bushes, a hedge, or a fence, between us and our neighbors to the rear.  Right now we have a lovely view of their tarp-covered woodpile and a bunch of weeds.  Also there's a 3 and a half foot high rock retaining wall that I worry the kids will fall off of.  R wants a red fence, but I suspect that planting something would be a much easier project (thus more likely to get done), and less likely to cause a landslide.

R is on a (Chinese) New Year's cleaning binge.  He bought a gazillion filing folders at Costco and has been filing and sorting.  I'm hoping that the new system will help us to work together on the paperwork better- I've been wanting to do more of it, but when his system was all in his head, there wasn't much I could do.  This is a definite improvement.

Last week I moved an entire shelf of toys out of the living room into the kids' rooms, on the theory that it would be harder for them to create huge messes downstairs if they had less to work with.  I think it's helping, especially for Sammy.  They're playing more with the toys that are left.  I know it's easier for Sammy to focus on things when there isn't as much clutter.  I've also been using the empty space I created as a staging area- if I know Sammy and I will be home in the morning I can set out a few interesting things that she hasn't seen in a while for her to play with while I fix breakfast.  This works great when I have the energy to do it- it really helps to start the day a few steps ahead instead of running to catch up like I usually am :)  Now if only I could convince myself not to stay up too late playing on the computer, maybe I could really get it together.

Sammy is growing like crazy too- she's on an alphabet kick this month.  Out of the blue she started pointing out letters to me, and I suddenly realized she was naming them correctly.  I'd say she knows about half of them reliably, and can usually name an object that starts with that letter.  I've been feeding her interest with alphabet books- our absolute favorite is ""Kipper's A-Z"" by Mick Inkpen, though there's a Max and Ruby ABC that I love too. Watching my kids learn to read is one of the best things about being a mom- it's so cool!"

Then there's the sweater issue.  Ten years ago I lost the perfect cotton cream-colored, cable knit cardigan sweater with interesting buttons.  I've been searching for a replacement ever since then with no luck.  Ditto for the simple red merino wool cardigan my mom put in the dryer about three years ago.  I bought them both in Chicago for about $30 apiece, but can't find anything that looks like them at any price.  I've been living in fleece jackets, since this is Seattle, after all, but I really would like to buy something dressy to wear for the holidays.

It's becoming a bit of an embarrassment for me, such as when she insists on wearing them to the school playground to pick up her big sister (who is that incompetent mom who can't seem to dress her child by 3pm?*), but it does lead to some amusing moments.  This morning I got her up and she changed her diaper by herself.  As she was putting her clothes back on she crowed, ""And for the finishing touch... JAMMIES!""  I can't say that I blame her though- she has a cold right now, and seriously, who wouldn't want to wear footie jammies all day if they could?

Then at lunchtime Sarah wanted ice in her water, so R. gave Sammy ice too, to which she exclaimed, ""Did you give me ROCKS in my water??""

*So what would you do?  Naptime is right before pick-up from school time, and I've already had to move her nap ahead two hours and shorten it by an hour so that she can be up in time to leave.  I try to have her dressed and ready to go before I put her down for her nap, but if she decides to be stubborn about it either before or after the nap she either loses sleep time or makes us late.  I haven't been making an issue of inappropriate clothing choices unless I know we're planning to run errands after picking Sarah up.  Is this being too permissive, or just choosing my battles wisely?"

"event","I forgot to add, I'm in the middle of reading Dr. Paul Farmer's, ""Pathologies of Power: Health, Human Rights, and the New War on the Poor"".  I'm about halfway done and it's excellent.  He's using liberation theology as a framework, ie, talking about a preferential option for the poor in health care, and also looking at what he calls structural violence, by which I'm gathering he mean systemic economic and social injustice that causes certain portions of the worlds population to live in continual poverty and face extra risks of ill-health with little access to treatment, while other groups (the wealthy) are protected.  I've studied liberation theology before, but Farmer's concrete examples and stories from Haiti, Cuba, Chiapas and Russia really helped me to understand it better.  Read it, and tell me what you think!

I will be interested to see if he has any suggestions in the second half of the book as to how we go about changing the inqualities that exist, but his basic premise so far is that the idea of human rights should be broadened to include economic rights and the right to equal health care, not just ""cost-effective"" health care."

"event","I just wanted to note that Sarah is reading very well now, and it's been amazing how quickly it happened.  This morning she read Green Eggs and Ham to Sammy and me with nary a stumble, and at a normal, grown-up pace.  It's no wonder I really have no memory of learning how to read- it's almost like someone just threw a switch in her brain and there it was.  She hesitates a bit on brand new words, especially if they're really long, and names are usually tricky, but in general it's incredible the words she already knows.  It's so cool to watch.  I've been trying to have her read at least one book a day to/with me, on top of the ones I read to her to get her warmed up for school starting soon.  I think I'd better do some writing practice with her too- I noticed today she's a bit rusty and is reverting to writing a couple of letters backwards again that I know she knew perfectly well before summer started.  I'll have to think of a cool writing project to suggest to hook her interest so it feels like fun.  

Most of this morning was taken up by converting a shoebox into a pet carrier for her stuffed animals- I helped her cover it with white paper and then she decorated it with glitter glue, yarn, ""jewels"" and stamps.  It has way more bling than any cat carrier I've ever seen and she's very happy with it!  Meanwhile Sammy happily experimented with scissors, glue and yarn herself, which went pretty well until she decided she absolutely must have Sarah's glitter glue and scrambled up onto the table to snatch it, stepping right in her own sticky art-in-process on her way by.  And there was much shrieking from both of them, as I hauled Sammy off to the sink to wash the glue off of her and pry the tube of glitter glue from her hand.  Still, it was a pretty successful dual art project :)"

"event","I'm breaking out of a rut of not getting around to posting because I want to remember this:)

Sammy woke up the other morning crying and when I went in she said, ""Mama!  You had a purple cape!  You were flying! (me- Really?  Wow, that sounds like fun!)  And then you fell on your head!  (Hmmm, guess I'm not so good at flying...)  And then I lost my Mama.""  (Awwwww. But then I came and picked you up!  And it was just a dream.)  ""It's ok, it was just a dream Mama!""

I also want to remember that Sammy is giving really great hugs lately (not to mention big, sloppy, on the mouth kisses), and now she wants to blow me kisses before I leave the room when she's going to bed.  One for each pocket, one for my hand, and sometimes she designates other random body parts to get one.  Today she gave me one for my eye.  I blow her kisses too.  It's a fabulous game because it requires that I PUT HER DOWN in the crib to start playing it, so it's a great transition towards me leaving the room.

My neighbor had Sarah over all day today to play with her great niece and nephews who were visiting her.  She reported that Sarah was delightful to have around, and was a huge help taking care of the younger kids, and that she is really good at playing with them because she's a born leader- apparently she makes up games for them to play and they all happily do what she tells them to do.  This is usually not the case at home- Sammy's not quite as biddable I guess, and Sarah gets grouchy when things don't go exactly the way she wants them too.  Sigh.  Only three weeks until first grade starts- yay!!  I'm really looking forward to the peace and quiet.  In the meantime, I'm practicing trying to keep my cool, even when provoked- perhaps it would help if I wear my cape :)

We just got a second car so that R can help drive Sarah to school so I won't be late for Sammy's preschool every time- double yay!  I'm also hoping it will enable him to get home earlier because he'll spend less time on his commute (it took about an hour on the bus versus 20 min. by car), though I'm pretty sure he's actually going to spend the extra time working out more, or just plain working more.  We'll see.  Either way, I'm hoping he'll be less stressed.

Book report:  I just read ""Lost in a Good Book"", by Jasper Fforde, and it was *really* fun.  Better than the first book in the series, ""The Eyre Affair"", which is slower going, but worth sticking with in order to get to the second one.  In a bid to wake up my brain I've put a couple of Paul Farmer's books on hold at the library- we'll see, maybe I'm going to have time to think when school starts!"

"event","As I may have mentioned before, Sarah likes to ""help"" me bake things.  Mainly she really loves to stir.  And stir.  And stir WAY beyond the point where stirring is actually necessary for the sheer joy of stirring.  She's enthusiastic about it, and some flour flying out of the bowl onto the counter is to be expected.  Usually I let her help me when Sammy is either napping or safely trapped in her high chair, just so there's one less random element to the process.  But today, I apparently lost my mind.  It was nearly dinner time, R. had called to say he was running late, and I decided that since we were having leftovers I had time to get a batch of pumpkin muffins in the oven.  I was immediately surrounded by children clamoring to help.  Things were going fairly smoothly for a while- I sidetracked Sammy into pretending to cook with her own bowl and spoon, and kept Sarah busy fetching things while I did most of the measuring of the dry ingredients.  Usually I let her dump them into the bowl, but I was afraid that with Sammy watching they would start fighting over the measuring cup.  Sammy started getting really grabby and refusing to listen, so I moved Sarah and the bowl to another counter and let her stir the dry ingredients together with a whisk, then I went back across the room to clean up next to Sammy.  Sarah was stirring away happily when suddenly I heard a large, ""Crash!"" and looked up to see Sarah, covered in flour, on the floor next to her up-turned step stool and a half-empty mixing bowl.  The rest of the flour mixture was all over the counter and scattered across the floor.  (We're talking 3 cups of flour and 2 cups of sugar in this recipe- it's one of my mom's and it's large.)  Samantha, of course, thought this was great and immediately ran over to dance in it with her bare toes.  Sarah burst into howls of, ""It wasn't my fault- I was stirring really carefully, and then I fell!""

To my credit, I handed her a broom, did not lose my temper, and didn't laugh until later, when she wasn't around.  (Ok, I admit that last one wasn't hard- it took me a few hours before I felt like laughing, though in retrospect it was hysterical.  R. came home just in time to walk in on the howling, the dancing and the sweeping- I can just imagine what must have gone through his head :) 

What I did not do was assure Sarah that it wasn't her fault.  That's ok I think- she seems to feel that she shouldn't have to take any responsibility for accidents, and I disagree.  What I shouldn't have done, but I'm afraid I did do, was throw in a lecture on being more careful as I was handing her the broom.  Sigh. 

But on a brighter note, after the kids were in bed, I was inspired to try making a new kind of muffins (they have peaches, yogurt and oatmeal) since there was not enough sugar left to try again with the pumpkin ones.  I just ate one, and I think I'll go have another- it's definitely been a two muffin day. Good night all!"

So I called her, on the off chance that there might be something I could do to help out, you know, just to keep my brain from turning to jello, and maybe as a springboard to someday having gainful employment again (gasp), and she said there are lots of things.  Yay!  We're going to have a play-date in a few weeks and talk about finding me something to do that I can work into my schedule.

I've been tackling my jungle of a back yard too. Today I took some old bricks we had lying around from an uncompleted project and used them to make a border separating the ivy from the grass outside our living room picture window.  I've decided to focus on that area, so at least I can look out the window without grimacing at the amount of work still to be done (what we really need is $30,000 worth of landscaping).  The perennials Sarah planted last summer (from seeds even) survived the winter, so we have a little flower patch there now, but I want to plant a lot more.  Daffodils would be nice- I wonder if the squirrels would eat daffodil bulbs?  They ate my crocuses, darn them.  I may try again using chicken wire over the bulbs though- purple crocuses are so pretty.  Does anyone know of a bulb that squirrels don't like the taste of?"

I'd better just jot down the highlights that I can still remember and move on... (and you can all blame my husband- he bought himself some new computer games for Christmas and he's been sort of monopolizing the computer during the evenings after the kids are asleep.)

December was a blur of WAY TOO MUCH SHOPPING, and I swear I will find some way to not make the same mistake again next year.  

The Good:

Sarah and I made a fabulous gingerbread house from a kit purchased at Costco.  It rocked.  The frosting was pre-mixed in a tube, the pieces were already cut out, the candy came with it, and it came with a plastic tray that had grooves cut into it to help the walls stand up while the frosting dried.  It even had extra gingerbread cookies for eating, so the kids didn't want to eat the house right away.  Sammy has been begging for gumdrops off of it ever since- she calls it ""ginger house"" very plaintively.

Christmas evening I read Sammy the Christmas version of ""Pat the Bunny"".  It unfortunately contains the line, ""On Christmas morning, we get up early.""  So what do you suppose she did?  5:30 am Christmas morning Sammy woke up (two hours earlier than her normal time) and the first thing she said to me, with a big smile, was, ""Up early!""  Nothing I could do would induce her to go back to sleep either.

On the 26th, we flew to Iowa to visit my family, and even made the six hour trek from my parent's house to Corning, IA to visit my 96 year old Grandpa.  He beat us all at Mexican Train Dominoes, but R. won at Quiddler, which is a very fun card/word game my Aunts introduced us too.  Sarah and Sammy built a snowman in the park across the street that I played in as a kid.  They also had fun inside pretending that Gramps' walker was a car and driving it around the living room.

Sammy had a great time playing with my mom, although she spent most of January sporadically saying, ""Miss Grandma!,"" which broke my heart.  I hate living so far away from my family.

We just got back from a trip to Vancouver to see R's extended family for Chinese New Year.  Sarah got to see a lion dance, and was absolutely mesmerized.  It's a good thing that we planned to got for Dim Sum immediately afterward, because I don't think anything less than the promise of shrimp dumplings would have torn her away.  Sammy charmed everyone by being shy and then passing out hugs and kisses when it was time to say good-bye.

On the way home from Vancouver we heard the following exchange from the back seat crew:

Sarah:  ""OK Sammy, we have to use our super powers to turn this car into a rocket!""

Sammy:  ""Cool 'dea""

Sarah:  ""OK Co-pilot Sammy, you need to push the green button!""

Sammy:  ""Push!""

This continued for about twenty minutes with much pushing of buttons and emergency pulling of imaginary levers.  At one point Sarah took them to a ""crescent moon"" which she announced was made of cheese.  Then she told Sammy to push the ""Go to the moon button.""  Sammy immediately started making smacking/eating noises, even before Sarah told her to go collect some cheese. (Yes, we do have Wallace and Gromit at our house :) 

The Bad:

A second grade girl at Sarah's school died of complications from the flu last week.  She got a rare heart infection.  Very very sad and scary stuff.  I feel horrible for her family, and weird because I didn't even know her, but I feel like I should be doing something to help and I don't know what to do.  

I'm also extremely thankful that our kids got their flu shots this year- I almost didn't get Sarah one because she was complaining so much about not wanting to get a shot.  I'm generally pro-vaccinations, but I thought that the flu wasn't really that serious unless you were elderly.  I'm sure going to get them vaccinated again next year!"

As I suspected, the old check I found is no good any more.  The bank said they expire after six months.  Oh well, I feel better for at least trying.  What a waste.  The lady at the bank did say something encouraging though- she suggested that perhaps he'd originally lost it, and already gotten a replacement issued long ago.

I didn't realize quite how addicted I was to looking things up on-line, whenever a thought struck me, until I couldn't.  It was torture.  The worst of it is that I'm the editor for our preschool newsletter, and the deadline for submissions was- the 20th.  Only I can't start putting anything together until my darling husband finishes installing Pagemaker onto the new computer, and also pulls the memory out of our old computer (pleasepleaseplease let it be ok) and puts it in the new one.  Good thing I don't bite my nails or they'd be gone by now.  The first thing I'm going to do is upload about a million photos of the kids to smugmug if the memory is ok.

So, what have I been doing in the meantime?  Today I played Candyland with Sarah and her stuffed duck.  The duck won.  This was probably the best outcome, as Sarah and I were united in defeat, but it proved without a doubt that there is no skill whatsoever involved in that game; also, that is one lucky duck.

Sarah's been suffering from a mysterious stomach ailment- her stomach hurts, and has been hurting on and off for the past several days, but she doesn't have a fever and her activity level is relatively normal.  (It takes a 103 degree fever to slow her down, anything less she ignores.)  She's taking it pretty much in stride though, because it's getting her unlimited hot water bottles and much ginger ale and pretzels.  I hope it goes away soon and doesn't get anyone else sick!

Have I mentioned that Sarah and Sammy have a new game?  They both pretend to be dogs.  Sarah's dog name is ""Fluffy"" and Sammy's is ""Doggy"".  Sammy calls Sarah ""Fluffy"" now when Sarah is acting like a dog, and will throw things for Sarah to fetch.  I'm a bit nervous about encouraging her to throw things in the house- her aim isn't very good, but fortunately, she also has a very short range!  It's not a totally fun game though- I've had to give Sarah some time outs for growling at her sister, and Sammy enjoys pretending to be scared and running to me to cling to my knees- kinda makes it hard to get much done :)

We actually had three snow days here in Seattle the week after Thanksgiving.  Sammy was very excited that it was ""Noing"", and Sarah had a blast sledding on our driveway during Sammy's naps.  We have one of those round saucer sleds that are nearly impossible to steer, but I put a scarf around her waist and pulled her down the hill as I ran, using the scarf as reins to keep her from going off the drop-off into the neighbor's yard.  She also made some lovely snow angels.  By the third day we were suffering from terrible cabin fever, so we took a walk with my neighbor over to the community college, where the kids had a great time throwing snowballs into a fountain, and discovering that snow floats.  (and that when you get your mittens really wet, they take a very long time to dry...)

Oh, and one quick question before I go- we cleaned out a bunch of old papers and files in the process of making room for the computer, and as I was shredding I found an old $50 check from R's Chicago employer, which he had forgotten to deposit.  From 2000.  He doesn't want to try depositing it, for fear of a fee if it bounces, and also feels $50 isn't worth the embarrassment of talking to his old employers about it- given these restraints how would I go about getting my hands on the $50?  Any ideas?  I was thinking I'd try calling the bank the check is drawn on tomorrow, to ask if it's still good, but I'm afraid I'll sound like I'm trying to scam them."

"event","So last night, in response to months of Sammy waking up several times a night, screaming for us to come and snuggle her back to sleep, I casually said to her as I was tucking her in, ""You know Sammy, Mama and Daddy really don't like to be woken up in the middle of the night by screaming when we're trying to sleep.  If you wake up in the middle of the night, and it's still dark, that means it's still time to sleep!  If it's dark, you should just hug your bunny and go back to sleep.  When it gets light, that means it's morning, and then it's time to wake up.""  I didn't really think it would work, but I figured that it couldn't hurt, right?  Well, she didn't cry once all night long.  She didn't even cry in the morning!  I woke up on my own, and finally went in to check on her at 8:00, and I found her lying there, awake and happy, which absolutely never happens.  Dear God, please let this continue!!!  It was sooooooo good to get some un-interrupted sleep.  And yes, she got lots of hugs and kisses for being such a GOOD baby."

"event","Sammy has discovered that she likes meat- finally, after a lifetime of using it as chewing gum, and then spitting it out.  Also she has a new word- no matter what kind of meat you're eating, she'll look at you hopefully and beg, ""Chickin?  Chickin?""  We don't argue, we just hand it over.  I'm wondering idly if this means she has some new molars in there somewhere, but there's no way I'm going to stick my finger in to check, as I wouldn't get it back again in one piece.  She's cooperating more with having her teeth brushed lately, but not to the extent of opening her mouth wide.  I have to tickle her tummy and then she'll stop chewing on the toothbrush long enough for me to move it around a little bit, but I have to do it blind because she insists on keeping her lips closed around the brush.

Today she learned how to take her diaper off- look out world.  When Sarah got to this stage, she reveled in the joys of being naked (another word Sammy knows- she cracks us up by pointing it out, loudly, whenever Sarah runs around the house naked.  This annoys Sarah to no end- bwa ha ha.)  Anyway, this means I really need to get on it with encouraging her to start potty training, unless I want to be cleaning up a lot of accidents- if I only knew how.  She has a potty chair.  She likes to sit on it and say ""Pee!"", but she never actually does it.  (Mostly, I think she uses sitting on it as a stalling tactic to avoid having me put her diaper back on when I'm in the middle of changing her.)  She also lets me know when she's pooping in her diaper, which is another sign of readiness, I think.   Ah- I just had an idea.  Maybe the parent educator at Sammy's preschool has some good advice about how to motivate her.  I know enough to know that she won't use the potty unless it's her idea- both my children are extremely *coughstubborncough* strong-willed.  Have I mentioned that Sammy climbs into her high chair by herself, and will not allow me to set her down into it, even if she's starving and begging for food?  Nope, she has to do it herself.  If I want her to get into it, I have to show her the food and invite her to climb in so that she can have it, and she completely feeds herself as well.  I'm only allowed to help with broth.  So yeah, everyone will be happier when she gets to control her own potty-going, because she would really rather that I handed over the wipes too, and does not appreciate having to lie down and hold still when I'm changing poopy diapers.  I will be so happy to be done with diapers someday!!"

"event","Slowly, slowly, I think I am winning the war against clutter in my house.  It must be because the kids are spending less time at home, and therefore, have less time to create chaos, because I'm finding that suddenly I have the energy to tackle problem areas that I've been ignoring (and piling things on) for, well, I should admit it here I guess, pretty much since Sarah learned to walk.  It's the high-up spaces you see, the ones where kids can't reach things if you put them there?  The top of the fridge, the bookshelves, the tv cabinet, our closet shelves, the china hutch, the washer and dryer... you name it, they've ALL gotten pretty crowded because it seems like I'm always racing after the kids, rescuing objects from destruction, and then I have to put it all down quickly somewhere, to race off and rescue the kids because they've moved on to trying to destroy themselves.  

For a long time I never seemed to have the energy/willpower to go back and put all those things away where they actually belonged at the end of the day, after dealing with the more necessary cleaning, like dishes and laundry.  But my new anti-seizure medicine seems to have either A. cured me of a mild depression, if that's what it was, or B. made me hyper enough to want to clean all the time, because now I am some kind of anti-clutter superwoman.  (I need a superhero name, but can't think of a good one- any suggestions?)  I've been averaging about one organizing project a day, on top of all my usual maintenance cleaning and taking care of the kids, and it's making me very happy to be seeing actual improvements in how things look, instead of just cleaning things that are going to get dirty again immediately (ooh, I hate that!).  For my own records, so far I've done the entryway, the china hutch (which holds more art supplies than china) the cabinet that holds my baking spices/supplies, hacked away at some of the morning glories and ivy taking over our ""yard"" (still needs more hacking) the fridge (including the front, which tends to get covered with magnets, photos and bits of paper- still is, but now they're pruned down and organized), created a space on the bookshelf to store library books so they don't have to be left lying around in piles (a good thing, since I have 40 of them right now) and unburied the dining room table (repeat daily).  The clutter is definitely receding!"

"event","We had a (mostly) lovely day today.  Sarah has a cough and a minor sore throat, and managed to convince me that it was a good reason to let her stay home from school today.  I've been vacillating between being happy that I'm able to let her stay home when she's sick, and feeling guilty that I didn't make her go to school anyway, because by 9:30 she was bouncing around the house like her usual chipper self.  It's a really tough call deciding when to keep her home- the rules are clear about when they're NOT allowed to come to school, but the rules for when they are allowed to stay home are much greyer, and seem to be mostly up to the parent.  I hope when I do decide to keep her home it's for her sake and not for mine!   

  But I have to admit, playing hooky was really nice.  I loved not having to rush out the door.  In an attempt not to encourage future feined illnesses, I didn't let Sarah watch tv today at all- instead we played school.  We had a leisurely breakfast, and then spent a long time playing with playdough, then read stories. Sarah even ""read"" one to Sammy, snuggled up together on the couch- I was nearly dead of cute.  Sammy's at the stage where she'll run up to anyone, even her big sister, with a book begging ""read, read? again, again?"".  Sarah and I baked chocolate chip-orange muffins together during Sammy's nap.  She was profoundly skeptical about the recipe, but ended up loving them.  We even talked about math for a few minutes.  They must be working on it in school already, because she knows ""equals"" and ""plus"", and she could do 7 cookies plus one cookie equals eight cookies without going back and counting them (she drew pictures of chocolate chip cookies)- I was impressed, though I don't know if I should be.  It's a relief though, that she seems interested in math, because apparently half of the graduating 8th graders in WA state public schools can't do 5th grade math, according to our standardized tests.

"event","What are you reading to your kids right now?  The current favorite at our house is ""Knuffle Bunny"", by Mo Willems.  His various ""Pidgeon"" books are awesome too, but Sammy really gets into this story- a favorite stuffed toy is accidentally tossed in the wash at the laundrymat, and and increasingly frustrated pre-verbal toddler trys to tell her daddy something is wrong all the way home, only to be met at the door by mom, who saves the day by saying, ""Where's Knuffle Bunny?""  They all race back to the laundrymat, the bunny is rescued, and the baby says her first words, ""Knuffle Bunny!""  It's too cute.  Sarah's favorite of the moment is ""Encyclopedia Brown""- she loves the idea of trying to solve the mysteries- even though they are still too hard for her to figure out she gives it her best shot.

Sarah's school had a Usbourne book fair this week as a fundraiser for their library.  I would have much preferred to just be asked for a donation, which I would have gladly given them.  Instead, they let the kids spend their library time looking at books for sale and having grown-ups write down the titles that they wanted on a wish list, which they brought home to their parents.  Sarah's had $50 worth of books on it, but what upset me the most was that the books in question were HORRIBLE.  How about a cutsy retelling of the Nutcracker in which the mice are defeated by shooting them with big wads of cheese?  Heavy on the sugary illustrations?  UGH. Not something I want to have to read over and over, thanks anyway.  I went to the sale myself and picked out one book I could live with off her list for $5.95.  Sheesh.  We really need to do a better job of funding our public schools if this is what we're coming to."

"event","Time to learn how to cut, because I care. <br />  <br />
<div text=""Please let this work so I can go to sleep!"" class=""ljcut""><br />I really should be going to bed, but I'm just too cranky right now. So instead I'm going to write a boring rant and see if it makes me feel better, when I really should just stick my nose in a nice, escapist, book. Hey yeah, that's why I'm cranky- I have ""Ancestors of Avalon"" and ""The Magic of Recluse"", not to mention ""Ralph S. Mouse"" by Beverly Cleary (Ok, I checked that one out mainly with Sarah in mind, but really it's for me :) on my bookshelf, and they've been there for days now and I haven't even LOOKED at them. <br /><br />The kids are both sick with hacking up a lung sounding coughs, so I kept them both home today and made soup instead of driving all over town. It wasn't relaxing though, because Sarah decided that today would be a good day to argue with me about everything. I wanted to do some baking during Sammy's nap, mainly because I really wanted to do some EATING OF BAKED GOODS, and also because the house felt chilly. Everything in the recipe box was looking yummy, so I made the fatal mistake of asking Sarah her opinion of what we should make. She was so unreasonable, rude and bossy to me about it that I got mad and decided not to bake at all, which really sucked. The final straw was when I suggested making chocolate crinkle cookies, which I happen to know are fabulous, but which she's never had before, and she crossed her arms and declared, ""No, no, if you make those, I will not eat any of them!"" (This was even after I tried to explain that they taste like brownies, which she loves, only even better.) Well, the only possible response to that, gentle readers, is, ""Oh really? Great! Then the whole batch will be for me!"", which I said, but I also lost most of my motivation, because half the fun of baking is sharing the yummies with other people. It soon became a moot point anyway, as her next trick was to wake Sammy up an hour early from her nap. Feeling my sanity slipping through my fingers, and on the heels of a spectacular poopy diaper change, I decided to pop them both in the tub to give us all some soothing play time. Which didn't quite work out as well as I was hoping. The point where I wanted to bang my head on the wall was when Sarah said excitedly to Sammy, ""Look, if we close the curtain, we can splash AS MUCH AS WE WANT TO!!"", which they then proceeded to do. I am SOOOO not cut out for this. She's got me wound up so tight that silly things that aren't hurting anyone, and which will probably make me laugh tomorrow after I've gotten some sleep (hopefully) are making me want to scream and tear my hair out, mainly because I don't feel like I'm in control of things, and even when I do feel like I've got it together, I still feel like Sarah is constantly testing me for chinks in my armor. Because she is. And it's completely exhausting. <br /><br />I called my friend Robyn today, whose daughter is Sarah's best friend and arranged for her to have Sarah over at their house one day a week after school to do art projects (she's a very crafty lady :) and have playdates with Ruby. She's been wanting to earn some extra money since Ruby got placed in full-day kindergarten when they wanted half-day, and now they have to pay $200 a month for it, and I have extra money since Sarah didn't get into full day, so it works out well for both of us. She's probably even going to be able to pick Sarah up from school- wahoo!<br /><br />So, hopefully a little time apart will do us good, and I'll be able to get a grip. I'm also going to meet with the parent educator at our co-op preschool to see if she has any advice- she's wonderful, so it will be fun to talk to her in any case, and she usually has great books to recommend as well. I'm also thinking about reading a book I saw on Amazon, called Nurture by Nature, by Paul Tieger and Barbara Barron-Tieger. It apparently takes the Myers-Briggs personality types stuff and applies it to parent-child relationships, and then offers advice on how to deal with it when your personality styles differ, which is what I think is causing a lot of my problems with Sarah. She's extremely extroverted, boisterous, high-spirited and downright loud, while I'm pretty introverted. Her constant noise and demands for attention wear me out, and I frequently feel like she's invading my space (usually because she's ACTUALLY invading my space by climbing on me), and my need for peace, quiet and solitude probably makes her feel like I'm always shushing her or pushing her away. I hate this dynamic, but it crops up whenever she's bored and I'm tired or busy with something besides her, i.e., a lot. Some days it feels like the only peaceful time we have together is when I read to her. She'll sit and listen to books for as long as I'm willing to read them- when she was Sammy's age I used to spend hours reading to her every day, just to get her to sit still and stop A. destroying the house and B. trying to kill herself off by climbing on everything in sight. Hey, wait, that's still pretty much why I read to her! So now I'm living with a really articulate tasmanian devil who loves books.<br /><br />The good news is that I must be doing something right- other people (who don't have to live with her) seem to find her charming. We have three sets of neighbors who all let her wander over and visit whenever she spots them out in their yards. As far as I know she's polite to other people, just not to me. But then, I'm much more polite to other people than I am to her. We've been aggravating each other too much, and it's all because we're in a power struggle. She wants to set her own rules, and thinks she knows everything- so much so that she doesn't even stop to ask before doing things most of the time. Ok, this, I have to admit, sounds a lot like me as a kid. Man, no wonder my mom is amused watching me deal with this situation! Sorry mom- I didn't mean to be a pain in the ass, I really did think I knew what the right thing to do was! Ok, deep breaths. Ranting calming down now. It's a good thing that she can think for herself and doesn't blindly follow rules. She's in no danger of succumbing to peer pressure and doing stupid things later in life. Unless of course, she wants to, in which case, there will be no stopping her, so I may as well give up now, eh? No, that's not right. But I clearly need a different teaching methodology, 'cause mine isn't working. When I was a kid, I wanted the REASONS for everything explained to me, so I've been trying to do that with her, but it causes huge amounts of conflict because then she argues with my reasons. Could be she's still to young for the reasons and I should just be saying more of the ""That's just the way it's going to be"" kinds of stuff, and save the reasons for later if she asks questions.<br /><br />Ok, almost 1 am, time to hide this behind a cut and get to bed!  I feel better- thanks for listening :)<br /><br />

Sammy's turning into a little monkey lately.  She's learned how to climb up ladders at the playground (terrifying much?) and is also determined to climb into her crib, though she hasn't succeeded so far.  I'm sure she got the idea from her sister- Sarah likes to climb in to Sammy's crib and then lift Sammy out and lower her down to the ground.  I nearly had a heart attack the first time they did this, but now I'm pretty much resigned to it (Sarah does it whenever she hears Sammy crying in the morning before I do), and Sarah hasn't dropped her yet.

Sarah's doing well though.  It took an hour to pick her up from school today because the walk to the car turned into an impromptu playdate with her new friend Samantha.  Sarah shared her fruit roll-up and had a great time playing with Samantha's puppy.  They were giving the puppy dry leaves to pounce on- I've never seen a dog act so much like a cat before.  Then Sarah started pulling library books out of our car and ""reading"" them to Samantha.  She can't actually read more than a few words, but she's got them basically memorized because we've read them to her so much.  I think Samantha was much more impressed by the fruit roll-up though- she wanted us to bring more tomorrow, but I explained that Sarah hadn't managed to talk me into buying more than one :)

I have found a nice place to park the car, and learned the route to take to get back onto the highway.  Sarah woke up really early today and had time to eat breakfast, but still wanted to eat in the car (second breakfast! :) She and Sammy must have switched brains today because Sammy slept in until 7:45, but at least there were no diaper incidents on the way out the door today.  I had a nice talk today with another mom who was also dropping her daughter off, while Sammy happily ran around in circles on the school playground.  I think she was delighted just to be free, poor kid.  She's not used to having to get in the car right after breakfast- going from sleeping in a cage (the crib) to being strapped into the high chair, to the car seat- who can blame her for wanting to run?  Today was a good day.  She played for nearly an hour and I had someone nice to talk to.

Sarah had a sad day though.  Her friend (of one week) Madeline isn't in her class anymore.  She got into the half-day supplemental program, that extends the half-day kindergarten to a full day, by switching to the afternoon session instead of the morning session.  Sarah's pretty upset because she hadn't really gotten to know any other kids yet, and was counting on seeing Madeline today, plus she doesn't quite understand why the half day supplemental program doesn't have room for all the kids.  (It's a non-profit, so they have to follow space and child/teacher ratios that the school district doesn't, and they can only take 18 kids, while Sarah's class has 28.)  Anyway, it's a bummer, especially since Madeline's mom was the one who was going to watch Sarah for me if I needed to be late on Mondays.  On the other hand, maybe we could switch to afternoons and get in too... hmmm.  I'll have to call and see."

I'm stressing about going back to the real world of having to be on time for things again after not having to deal with it for so long.  If I get her to school late, she has to go to the principal's office and get a note- poor kid.  Can I see a show of hands who thinks that's going to happen at least once this year?  Maybe once a month?  Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.  Because my children are the absolute masters of making me late.

Anyway, our brand new local branch library opened this weekend, and in about five minutes of looking I scored some excellent kids books.  If you are looking for something fun to read to your wee ones that you won't mind reading (well, at least not for the first twenty times anyway) check out the following:

""Minerva Louise and the Red Truck"" by Janet Morgan Stoeke (about an extremely cute chicken with a wild imagination, with bonus drawings of large construction equipment)

and ""Max's ABC"" by Rosemary Wells, which is probably the funniest abc book I've ever seen.  (Max's Ants escaped from their Ant farm.  They went looking for Max's birthday cake.  Up Max's pants they climbed...  Max poured his Cup of Cranberry juice on the ants in his pants.  Delicious!)  As usual, the illustrations are fabulous.  I love Rosemary Wells.  Best of all, a glorious mess is made and no ants are harmed.

I am so happy to have a branch close by once again- it's been closed for three years while they built a new one.  Plus they've added a really nice little playground right next to it and a community center.  Yay!"

"event","Today was a good day.  I made a new rule that Sarah can only watch tv while Sammy is napping or eating- Sammy's starting to pay attention to the tv, and I don't want her to watch much of it, plus it's a diplomatic way of restricting Sarah's tv time in a way she can't argue with.  So instead, in the morning Sarah spent a very long time drawing an intricate picture of a bear family (Mama, Papa, Brother, Sister, a nursing baby, and a friend of theirs) having a picnic.  She drew it in pen, without getting any ink on the table, and then colored it in with her markers.  The Papa bear is holding the picnic basket, and you can tell it's a basket because she drew the cross-hatching.  Sarah can tell you exactly what the foods are that are laid out on the picnic blanket.  They have water (she drew a recognizable Brita pitcher, which is cracking me up), cantaloupe, eggs, toast and pie, which she says they all helped to make.  I love the way all her pictures have stories about them.  Tomorrow I hope I have time to help her write it down.

Sammy spent the day testing her new-found climbing skills.  I have to keep the tray on her high chair, because if I don't, she climbs into it and buckles herself in.  I had to move the couch away from the window because she was climbing onto the windowsill and standing there.  I have to keep the chairs pushed in at the table too- today she used one to climb onto the table.  I don't know what I'm going to do when she learns how to climb out of her crib- get used to a new form of being woken up at night I guess!  Today I saw her trying to get her leg over the railing, and she's already tall enough to get her toe up there, even though it's on it's lowest setting.  Argh.  Hmm- pretty soon she'll start using her stuffed animals as stepladders.  I vividly remember the time I caught Sarah balancing on the railings, one hand and foot on each side- that was the day we took the side of the crib off and converted it to daybed form.  That one took at least a year off my life.  Sarah had already been climbing in and out of the crib for a while at that point, but I can't remember when she started doing it.  Surely not at 19 months??  Sarah is teaching Sammy a lot of bad tricks though.  She's started ""helping me"" by climbing into the crib with Sammy and lifting her down if I don't get there quick enough when Sammy wakes up.  Baby-proofing is definitely ratcheting up to a whole new level around here!  

After Sammy's nap I pried the kids loose from the house (you have no idea how difficult it is to get all of us clean, fed, clothed and awake at the SAME TIME) and we walked to the nearby park.  It had recently rained, but Sarah remembered to bring a towel along for drying off the play equipment.  We were lucky enough to run into another family- a mom with a 4 month old and a five year old girl.  Sarah made friends instantly, even though she insisted on calling her new friend ""Stacy"" instead of ""Sophie"".  Poor Sophie gave up correcting her after an hour of this.  The mom and I exchanged phone numbers, and they live in the neighborhood, so hopefully we'll have a playdate again sometime.  It's so much more fun to have another grown-up to talk to at the park, as well as other kids for Sarah and Sammy to play with.  Sammy had a blast too- crowing with delight every time she spotted a dog, giggling on the swings, and climbing up and down the play structure as fast as she could, with me in hot pursuit, just in case she decided to try flying off the edge.  We also worked on garbage recognition- she's not doing as well as Rivka's Alex.  Sammy needed to be dissuaded from throwing away any wood chips that happened to end up on the sidewalk, and when I handed her a bottle cap, with instructions that it was ok to throw that away, she promptly tried to stick it in her mouth.  Yeech!  But I did manage to make sure that she didn't eat any fireworks leftovers, so I think I've earned my mommy gold star today :)

Then we came home to find R. already cooking dinner- yummy kale and lentil soup from a Deborah Madison recipe- I think it came from ""Cooking Light"".  I have a wonderful husband."

"event","Why yes, as a matter of fact I have been staying up way too late reading a lot lately :)  It's good for my sanity to take breaks from fighting the entropy generated by my two cute, but very active children.

I just read ""Sorcery and Cecelia or The Enchanted Chocolate Pot; being the correspondence of two Young Ladies of Quality regarding various Magical Scandals in London and the Country"", by Patricia C. Wrede and Caroline Stevermer, and thought it was delightful.  It's pretty much take Jane Austen, then add a dash of Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norell with a twist of Harry Potter.  Fun!

I've also just polished off two of Sara Paretsky's V. I. Warshawski novels, ""Blacklist"" and ""Fire Sale"".  I don't read a lot of detective novels, but I love hers because not only are they set in Chicago, which I miss, and not only are they total page-turners, but she also does a great job of incorporating social justice issues into her plots. 

Oh yeah, and I actually met her once, because she came in to shop at the kitchenware store I used to manage in Hyde Park.  I was too awe-struck to say much, but I think I managed to tell her that I love her books."

"event","Have any of you read ""The Mermaid Chair"", by Sue Monk Kidd?  I really enjoyed it, but not so much the ending, which I thought was somewhat contrived.  It's an interesting take on the ""fallen woman"" literature that Kcobweb was talking about a while back- the main character says something to the effect that ""Those who say I fell are being charitable- I dove!"""

"event","Bah, we're having quite a day.  Sammy woke up screaming last night every half an hour between 2 and 5.  Then this morning I managed to lock myself and the kids out of the house.  Fortunately, we have wonderful neighbors, one of whom is a retired painter, with plenty of ladders at his house.  When I sheepishly wandered over, kids in tow, to ask if I could borrow his phone to call my husband, he said, ""Are you sure there's not another way to get in?""  This reminded me that it was only a few days ago that Sarah knocked the screen out of the living room window, so I knew it was easy to remove, and thankfully I had left the window wide open.  Don brought a ladder over, popped the screen out, and we sent Sarah up the ladder and through the window onto the couch to run and open the door.  Quite an adventure for her- she was thrilled.  And the icing on the cake? Sarah had been playing in the swimming pool and was stark naked.

Can I go back to bed now? Please?"

"event","Wow, my head is spinning a bit, so this is going to be scattered, but I want to type it in quick while I can still remember it.

  My in-laws arrived in town for a two-week visit on Thursday, Friday was the last day of preschool for Sarah, and we've been doing activities and cleaning non-stop for what seems like forever.  

  My friend Robyn had her baby on the 15th, right on her due date.  Yay, a little girl, so now Sammy and Sarah can have double play-dates!  This is excellent.  

  Sammy said her first two-word combo the other morning when I finally came downstairs after Roland had gotten up with her, a very excited, ""Mama, Hello!""  *MELT* She's loving books these days, and will plop herself into  my lap with one whenever I sit down.  Her attention span is much longer too- she'll ask for four or five board books in a row, and is starting to show some patience with big-kid books even though it takes *so long* to get to the exciting page turning part.

  All this in spite of the fact that she fell out of her high chair onto the wooden kitchen floor and landed on her head last week.  She's got a goose egg, but only cried for a few minutes.  Boy does she remember it though- now when she tries to get out of her seat belt all I have to do is say, ""No no, you don't want to fall on your head!"" and she says ""Ow!"", puts her hand on her head, and sits down.  Poor little girl.  It happened because she was doing her best to escape the dreaded face washing.  Sheesh.

  The girls are doing really well playing together today, knock on wood.  Sarah used her bathrobe to cozily line a cardboard box, then put Sammy in it and started giving her rides by pushing her around the floor.  Sammy loved it.

  I just put Sammy down for a nap and finally experienced a cute trick she's been doing for her daddy.  She was clearly sleepy, so I took her up to her crib, wrapped her in her fleece blankie, gave her kisses and assorted comfort objects, and laid her down, then gave her a few more snuggles.  When I stood up to go... she grinned at me and waved bye-bye.  If I hadn't given birth to them both myself, I'd have to seriously wonder if she and Sarah are really related, but hey, at least I got one that's laid back!!

Oh, and my favorite Sarah quote of the weekend, ""Baba, it's Father's Day, so you get to play with me ALL DAY LONG, it's your special treat!!"""

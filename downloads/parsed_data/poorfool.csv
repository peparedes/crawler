"event","I saw Cinema Paradiso yesterday.. Nice.. Though I was expecting more..
I saw the original 123 minute version.. As usual after finishing the movie I googled to get trivia and information on the movie..
Found out that there is a directors cut which is close to 50  minutes longer.. where many of the unanswered parts are answered..
Read someones spoiler on the directors cut.. then decided that the directors cut may actually spoil the movie..
There is a simplicity and innocence about life in the movie that gets me yearning.. and then angry .. 

It got me thinking about the place where I grew up..
I must have had good times there.. 
But now I just hate the place.. I feel like a prisoner.. I feel afraid..

"event","Many christains I know just dont like the movie The Last Temptation of The Christ. Some of them would not even have seen the movie. I was just arguing with a guy who watched 20 minutes of the movie and decided that the movie was made for cheap thrills, and the director was looking to cash in on the contreversy.
The movie is just an exploration of the possibility that what if christ succumbed to temptation and decided to llive life as a normal person,  have a family and all.
The Christ is not the gun slinging sorta cowboy that you see in The Passion. He a just a man struggling with the greatness inside of him. A person who is confused and at times scared. He is trying so hard to  understand what God wants of him.
I really dont know why anyone would feel his faith threatened by the possibility that the Son of God may have been human too.
Peter (the rock) and quite a few of the other disciples are shown as weak and indicisive. The only disciple with balls is Judas. Judas is zealot (in the traditional jewish sense). He want to free jews from Roman oppression. 
Judas initially follows Jesus because he thinks he is the messiah who would free them from the Romans. But later he follows him because he believes in him. Judas is the one who gives Jesus strength. The one who probably has the capacity and  does love Jesus the most. 
The only reason he betrays Jesus is because Jesus asks him to do so.

I wish more people would question and doubt. I wish they would not fear what they would find.
I really dont believe that a God who values truth so highly would want blind faith. Infact the Catholic church believes that the existence of God can be established on reason alone.
Its just that its so much easier to just blindly believe than question."

I want to physically hurt.. just to hit and hit with no mercy..
I want to hate.. 
I feel anger when I see happy people now.. 
God and religion.. the stupid fools.. the only reason they worship is for fear of a hell.. what sort of God wants blind faith and following through fear.. not any god I believe in.. I rather burn than give anthing to such a god.. 

I did not ask for anything.. It was a dirty trick to play on anyone.. Shown a glimpse of what could have been.. and now to live my life with the knowledge that what ever I do.. even if I am better than I can be.. its not for me..
How does a man live when all hope is gone.. 
If only I could hate.. maybe I would be okay..

I dont believe it anymore.. 

What I thought of God to be like would be the Morgan Freeman sorta God from Bruce Almighty.. benevolent, indulgent, simple, with a sense of humor..  
But the conventional God is a dictator..  he want to be worshiped and glorified, he expects faith not logical reasoning, he wants to be feared, he displays the very human weakness of anger and jealousy and the only way he keeps his people in place is by a promise of a heaven  or the fear of hell after death.. and he seems to gets his kicks watching us go about struggling..

We would be crying bloody hell if this were a Hitler or Saddam.. but somehow we put up with this..

I happened to come across this quote by  Nietzsche -  ""God creates imperfect humans and then blames them for being so"".. 

Religion and God are nothing but crutches for people who dont want to believe the fact they are insignificant, that whatever they do there may be no purpose to it, that we are a freak accident of nature, and that one day you will die and you will cease to exist.. 

Another movie (Secondhand LionsI saw a few days back had this piece of wisdom  
"" Sometimes.. the things that may or may not be true may be the ones a man needs to believe in the most... that people are basically good.. that honor, courage and virtue mean every thing.. and power and money .. money and power mean nothing.. that good always triumphs over evil.. and I want you to remember this.. love.. true love never dies.. remember that boy.. remember that..""

"event","GD.. Group Discussions..

A post industrial age version of gladiatorial combat..

I still vividly remember the first GD session I had.. I was sitting on 3 IIM calls.. thought I better be prepared for what was to come.. So went to the nearest IMS center and signed up for the mock GD session..

The first topic was something to do with politics.. 10 people.. There was a 3 minute thinking period.. I recall people starting to fidget after 2.. unsure of whether to start of.. Then a guy spoke.. then.. then.. hell broke lose.. everyone was talkin.. no shouting... O god.. it was terrible..  all I could do was sit there and see the carnage.. the whole five minutes I could not get a word in edgewise.. the instructor made sure to point it out when the discussion ended..

The second on was much better.. 'Pink Pajamas on Red Fort'.. guess people did not know what to make of it.. I got to have some fun.. my theory was that a group of anarchists were voicing their protest by unfurling Pink Pajamas instead of the national flag..

Anyway.. I managed GDs fine after that.. Its just like acting.. I act like a pushy opinioned wise guy.. And get along fine..

But its not over yet.. Most companies take the GD route for selection.. bloody un-imaginative HR buggers.. Though to give credit there are a few who use innovative techniques to make a GD interesting.. there was the chat like GD by Dr. Reddy where they just sat around and chatted.. with the company guy as one of the participants.. And I think they got some of the bet people on campus inspite of being a second day company..

Aaah.. France.. my first (and only ) encounter with the French was when I signed up for French classes at Alliance Francaise, Cochin. 
Love the sound of French.. the wonderful names they have for their desserts.. 

Random googling for some information led me to a site which had some information on understanding France (and the French).. one section was on the French Anti-Americanism and the American Anti-Frenchism (did I get that right?)...

One interesting (hilarious) view point by Pascal Baudry, a Frenchman living in California, for this bad blood is ' ..<i>the fact that Americans are weaned early and toilet trained late when the French are weaned much later and toilet trained much earlier</i>.. '

Other theories include
<ul>
<li>The french think themselves culturally superior..  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Americans resent the fact that inspite of the time time French take of on other pursuits (35 hr weeks).. the standard of living is as good or maybe even better than America    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Americans keep acting unilaterally.. for causes that seem so clearly unjust to the French  </li>
</ul>

Today, the topic of interest were Tam-Bhrams (Tamil Brahmins for the non-initiated).. 

For some reason.. Tamils at the institute are of only two varieties.. the Tam-Brahms... and the Tam Christians.. (and one notable exception in our batch.. who deserves a post.. no .. I take that back.. he deserves a book.. of his own)..

Its the Tam-Brahms who are interesting study...
The guys can be explained in one axiom.. which is henceforth referred to as Axiom 1..
The girls are much more complex.. we are in the process of developing a theory.. ala Porter's Five Force Model .. 
We (Me and my good friend.. who incidentally is a Tam-Brahm) call this the Grand Unified Theory of Tam-Brahms..
We expect that using this theory, all about a Tam-Brahm can be predicted, just by plugging in some input data..

We already got a few people worried with our findings/hypothesis...

If you are wondering why details are not revealed.. well because my good friend would like to make a book out of it.. or maybe form a rating agency like CRISIL...

there is not much to his business.. a one meter square rig.. and on it one vessel with peanuts over hot coals.. a single kerosine lamp.. and a tin with change and small one rupee packs of peanuts.. 

But there is a quiet dignity and professionalism in the way he does his work.. ask for 1/2/3/4/5 rupees worth of peanuts.. he takes a square of paper.. makes a cone out of it.. uses a small cylinder to measure in the quantity.. and puts in a few more with his hand to top it off... 
its the measuring which really gets me.. I couldn't have cared less whatever arbitrary amout he put in.. but he goes about it in a way as if he want to be sure he does not cheat me of even a single peanut..
Then then way he takes the money from you.. and very carefully gives you back the change..

At sharp 9.. he starts packing up.. packs up the unsold peanutss..takes a funnel from inside his rig.. douses the lamp.. asks a person near him to help him get the rig down from the pavement to the road.. then thanks the person (always.. always.. ).. and goes of on his way..

"event","Think I found one more reason why MBA's round the world are a despised lot..

I sent a mail to the news groups on campus asking everyone to be a little more careful and not to litter..

A little later I see a reply suggesting an eco-drive.. and having color coded dustbins.. and having to take admins permission to do that..

All this when all one needs to do is 'not throw garbage around'..

sigh..... why cant people keep things simple any more.."

"event","I first heard 'I Grieve' by Peter Gabriel when I was in college at Cochin. It was on the soundtrack of 'The City of Angels'. The movie had really moved me and it was and still is one of my favorites. 
My roomie bought the cassette for the OST. Used to hear it at lot. But since then it had just slipped into that closet in the mind we call memories. I just managed to download it using Kazaa.
The song has such a has a quality of sadness which one cant help but notice. Grief.. Loneliness.. and hope..   http://www.lyricsondemand.com/soundtracks/c/cityofangelslyrics/igrievelyrics.html"

"event","mann... the problem with this place is ... every day you see some feat of an extraordinary mind which makes you say.. 'Mann.. how do I compete with that..'

The quiz yesterday at the institute's annual management fest, hosted by Pornab Mukherjee(PB), was just one more such incident..

oh.. I believe I have not mentioned it yet.. I have been cursed with a really bad memory.. no joke.. I remember(no ordinary feat too :) )..at my Infosys interview I was asked what were the subjects I did the previous semester.. I took me 3 mins and still managed only 2 out of 6.. (well I did get in anyway).. 
And it just seems to get worse.. there are times when I just cant put names to a person's face.. people I meet and talk with everyday too.. 
..maybe I will end up as that guy in <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00003CXZ4/103-5995809-3456667?v=glance"" target=""_blank"">Memento</a> 

and here at the quiz were people who were able to recall facts at will.. make connections between them.. 
PB... I noticed was not using notes.. so the questions were from memory (some of them pretty long winded).. or worse.. made up on the spot..
mannnn....

lucky for me.. I look like an intelligent guy..the thinking type.. (though the only thing I may be thinking of is what to have for dinner)..
..hopefully I can keep it up long enough, at an interview, for a company to hire me :)"

"event","have you heard the story of Narayantha Pranthdan... 

well it was something our OB (Organization Behavior) prof came up with during on of the classes.. (more about the prof later.. gem of a guy ..)

.. heard of Sisiphus.. the greek guy who was cursed to roll a boulder up a hill all day only to have it roll back down hill when he reached the top.. Narayantha Pranthdan (which is malayalam for the madman of Narayan.. a place.. henceforth referred to as NP..) was a lad who lived with his parents.. not very right in his head though.. every day he would go to the base of a hill and start rolling a boulder uphill.. and when he reached the top.. he would let it roll downhill... and as it rolled down he would stand there clapping his hands with glee.. enjoying the scene..
point?... same action.. same consequence.. but to Sisyphus.. a curse.. to NP.. a fun game.. :)..

he he.. NP was a craze here at the institute for a while.. yahoo status mssgs being the way I measure his popularity..

then came grades... people forgot him.. 

Think its time for him to return.."

"event","aaah.. just realized.. did not tell you how the summer placement story finished..

Placed on Day 0 Slot 1.. unless you have been an MBA student in india.. that wouldn't have made sense.. just means I was picked up early by a company..

It was not pretty.. 12 odd companies.. I had just 2 shortlists.. Standard Chartered Bank and Cognizant Tech Solns.. 

Day starts at 6am .. you go and sit in the holding area... as I whiled away time waiting for my stanchart GD (group discussion).. i realized that a banking summers did not appeal to me the least bit.. 
went for the GD at 1:30pm odd... you may not realize what a GD is like among MBA students unless you have been through one.. :).. its a bloodbath.. savage.. ruthless.. no place for the faint hearted..
I sat through the GD with a stupid smile.. just could not get myself motivated to speak on a pointless topic, for a job I did not care about.. he he.. anyway.. it reinforced my reputation as a perfect gentleman..
Understandably.. StanChart did not think me fit for a bankers role :)..

Cognizant Tech Solns did not have a GD.. (thank God for that..) .. just an interview.. its amazing how easy an interview is when you really believe what you say.. 
got a spot offer ( MBA jargon for.. company grabs me :) )

hopefully summers will be in Chennai .. so weekends could be at Bangalore.. 
and the pay ain't bad at all.. :)"

"event","hie habe a code (I have a cold)... 
not the best way to start of my biography.. but then who knows.. maybe it will be what ""Call me Ishmael"" was to Moby Dick..  Having a cold is the worst you can get.. sick enough to be miserable.. but not enough to garner symapathy.. in my case, a cold is like being high... only you are not high.. the world is all blurry and fogged up.. 

been a pretty good start to the day.. got to sing... a chinese song.. though I dont know chinese.. made people laugh..  then I got the cold.. 

three days left to summer placements.. 2 rejections from firms.. sad..  wasn't keen on them.. but prefer to do the rejections rather than the other way around..

atchooo atchoo.. think I should try and sleep . achoo.. this cold off.. 

PS.. thanks Sonja.."

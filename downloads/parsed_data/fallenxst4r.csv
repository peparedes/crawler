"event","manda left today around like..11 45 and then i walked up to brittanys a little bit after she left because i didnt wanna stay here for my mom to come home and yell at me like she does...everyday.

soo..i got up there..we watched tv and waited for manda to get there and then we just basically sat there. we were going to take a bus down to oakland or wherever but we ended up not going cuz nobody had any money..

i explained things to brian last night. i felt really really bad and i still feel bad. ive been having this feeling of guilt..before and mostly after i told him. its kinda like a feeling of wanting to fall asleep and never wake up because you know you messed up. i just couldnt sit back and think everything was going to turn out alright and stuff because i know it wasnt. i just had stronger feelings for bobby and im happy that im with him but theres still a part of me that wishes none of this ever happened :/ 

i had many chances of going out with people and this was the one chance that finally worked out and happened and i couldnt pass it up. i just feel really dumb. i dont know. i dont know what else to say except that...im sorry.

Saturday, i hung out with megan, chasity, and bobby mostly. oh yeahhh..me, megan, and chasity were all on megans golf cart and megan followed bobby back in the field thing and she was going pretty fast and she turned really quick and i flew off the golf cart, rolled, and just laid there for a minute or two. Chasity flew off two but i had it the worst considering i was on the outside. i was laughing so hard that i almost pissed myself. hahahaha. it was so funny but it kinda hurt and i went shopping earlier and i had my new shorts on. :( lol. Bruce was finally up camp. i was surprised to see him becasue they said something about him being on drugs or some shit. haha. loser.

Sunday..it rained on and off and i got really muddy. Megan got me all soaked because she dumped a huge bottle of water on me and it wasnt fun. haha. then i got her back. lol. uhmmm...oh yes..and we were laying on megans swing thing and we went to lay back and it tipped and of course i was the only one to fall off. then..i was swinging..and i was getting pretty high up and it broke on me and i fell and now i have this huge stratch on my leg :/ hahahaha. i got hurt so much this weekend. its not even funny. 

we left today early around 9 and that was gay. i was going to stay the whole week up there with megan but my mom said i had to come home and shes gay. and i dont feel good and my leg hurts.

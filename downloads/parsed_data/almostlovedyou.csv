"event","Pshh, What the fuck. People dont make sence really, I dont know why they have to avoid things that shouldnt be avioded, hear things they shouldnt of been heard, see things that shouldnt of been seen. But people avoid/hear/see them anyways. Life just sometimes doesnt make sence. But i guess thats the whole point of life. Its not soposed to make sence. its soposed to be this crazy mixed up world. Spontaneous. Exciting. World, and then i guess you fall in love, but you know you can't have them because there is always this one person in your way, but if this sounds religous i guess god wants you to stay on your toes, he wants us to appreciate what you have in life, and make you work for what you have. There will always be that one person that makes you see that openly and will change you life for most of your life. And there will be that one person that will love you for the rest of your life, but maybe it really wasnt meant to be. But there is always that one chance that is that right. and you just didnt listen to yourself. 



And you wont die. Because, you were here in this world for this one reason. And if you dont feel complete, you havent forfilled the reason you were soposed to. 


Now that i have had my deep thought provocking moment. Everyone can call me emo. But i was just seeing the whole point in life from my view. Cherish what you have to this day, cuz you might not have it later on in life."

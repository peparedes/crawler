"event","Went to Red River Gorge for the third weekend in a row!  Got to take little menace on some of the hikes that peregrin8 and I did last time and a some new ones.  She liked all of the things I expected her to like (namely, butterflies and caves)  and we had a good time although the conversation this time had a lot more to do with death and dog poop than my conversations the previous weekend.

Typical dialogue:
""Would you rather step in dog poop or die?""
""What if it was a giant people-eating dog poop?""
""How many times do you think you have stepped in dog poop in your life?

(Granted there were a lot of dogs on the trail)"

"event","Just went to the mall for the first time in ages and did my part for economic revival.  Bought fancy new sunglasses (and not the cheapest pair for a change), a new phone, new bathing suit, new camping gear, new life (it was 25% off!).  Yahoo!  Will have a new phone number soon, but first I want to test it out.  Plus I've been doing crazy music downloads and just found the Dresden Dolls' cover of Pretty in Pink(!!!), this silly chick who sings about cannibalism (http://cakebakebetty.cabanova.com/), and Miss Li, whose music is always one crappy lyric short of awesome, but I like anyway.  Plus Dresden Dolls covering Pretty in Pink!!!~

Had a great weekend.  Got out of the mandatory commencement ceremony early because my student didn't want to hang around, then left to go camping at Natural Bridge.  Beautiful weekend, lots of fun.  Little Menace and I invented the word ""terrifun"" for really cool trails.  We went down this awesome trail (Devil's Gulch) that takes this super steep, terrifun, staircase down this really cool gulch with funky holes in the rocks.  The staircase is even severely broken in places, thus adding to the terrifun quality (we later found out it was officially closed).  By the campsite there was also a short trail leading to a sink hole that you could climb down into and sit right next to a tiny waterfall.  Mr. Menance and I went there after the kids went to bed for some, uh, relaxation.

Will make some lentil soup so I can be *frugal* while figuring out my new phone!"

"event","We dropped the Little Menace off last night at a ""Kids Night Out"" event where she had a blast and we went to see The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus.  It was fabulous!  This movie made me very, very happy.  It was also a very good film to see on the big screen.  Ryan said he particularly liked it because he had most recently seen Avatar where absolutely nothing unexpected happened.  

Also we rented ""9"" (not to be confused with ""Nine"") a week or so ago and I really liked that too.  I was really skeptical when I looked at the trailer.  Wasn't sure if I would be able to take the animated rag dolls seriously, but that turned out not to be a problem.  The movie is preachy and not as good as Dr. Parnassus, but it is post-apocalyptic so that's always a plus.

Next weekend is girls' night out to see Sherlock Holmes.  Well, some of the girls are going to see Paula Poundstone, but others of us are seeing Robert Downey Junior and then we're meeting up after to compare notes.

I like good movies!"

"event","I've decided that while I do like Thanksgiving a lot better when it's at my house and I'm in control of things (no turkey! no marshmallows mixed into things!), it is still my least favorite holiday.  I vote that we should just have Halloween a second time.  Still, for a dumb holiday, ours was pretty good.  I made two complicated dishes, one of which turned out very well.  Little Menace helped me cook so everything had *very* precise measurements.  She still pronounced everything that we made (except for the jello) to be &quot;disgusting.&quot;  So she ate an artichoke while the rest of us had curried butternut squash and other yummies.

And Little M and I finished up our 4-day Monopoly game.  It's weird how cognition takes these sudden leaps.  When we last played the game about 6 months ago, she was having trouble w/ some of the concepts and we had to simplify the rules considerably.  She also got bored relatively quickly.  This time, she was *all* about the money and property acquisition (maybe this is a cognitive leap or maybe its just acclimation to capitalism) and insisted on being the banker.  She did a great job with the math (yeah math!).

And I got a long run in and we finished &quot;the trumpet of the swan,&quot; which is a really good book that I never read as a child.  So all in all not bad."

"event","For the second time this year, we have been without power for a week.  This time power went out around 3a.m. Wed. morning & given all the lines that are down, I'm not optimistic that we'll be getting it any time soon.  So we are holed up in my mother and sister-in-law's 2 bedroom apartment.  And honestly I feel a lot luckier than some....all of the hotels in the area are booked and are getting hundreds of calls/day.

So once we had to face the inevitability of waking up on Wed. morning, we had to get dressed in the cold, make phone calls, pack up our belongings, clear massive tree branches out of the alley, and drive down an icy hill all WITHOUT COFFEE!  No way to heat water in the house.  It took so much effort not to take it out on my family.  And I was soooo jealous of Little Menace who got to snuggle down with a book under six blankets while the adults in her life took care of everything.  I was also very jealous of those helpless women who can just let the men take care of things like hauling fallen trees and de-icing vehicles.  I so wanted to be incompetent and useless.  Damn feminism anyway!

At least this storm has the advantage over Hurricane Ike in that they closed the university.  So at least I don't have to try to keep up with *all* of my professional obligations while my personal infrastructure has crumbled away.  And being over here w/ my in-laws has actually helped me make progress on the mind-numbing process of editing my textbook (it's very humbling to have a professional editor go through all of your prose--I don't think there's a sentence in there that she didn't revise in some way).  

Little menace is thrilled since Grandma and Aunt Martyna not only have cable t.v. but consider it a form of child care.  Nickelodeon is the intellectual equivalent of high fructose corn syrup.  I think she's loosing an IQ point every day we stay here.

I told her how much our day trip skiing had cost (we had lots of fun...it was everything I'd ever dreamed skiing in Indiana would be like).  And she asked me, ""So mom are you spending *all* of our money on me?""

Well, kinda.  But we are having fun.  We kept the skiing trip a secret from her as long as possible in case one of us got sick, the weather got really bad, etc. but I had to spill the beans when I took her shopping to buy a pair of waterproof pants.  I picked out a pair of cheap, very warm and sensible plain brown pants and she started to have a fit, wailing ""but that's not my styyyyle.""  So I told her why I was buying them and then for the next 48 hours every single person we encountered learned that we were going skiing and that her mom had bought her an ugly pair of pants but it's ok because they would keep her dry."

"event","Well, May was a suckie month overall.  First, after Mr. Menacing finally figured out what he wanted to do with his life and went through the considerable hoops to get accepted into the Masters in Teaching program at my school, the f***ing university rescinds spousal tuition benefits starting almost immediately.  By May, of course, its too late to apply to other programs or make backup plans.  I have written two letters to the provost & gotten no response.  Totally shitty.  The tuition we thought would be free will end up costing about $20K total.  So, that, plus a really awful conversation last semester with my chair means that this fall will be the first time I'm going to really look at the job list since taking this job.  Problem is, I really don't want to leave Louisville, though I would love to change this place for a real university.

And then Morgan, who we have had almost as long as we have been together, died this month.  She had either cancer or a hernia, but either would have required surgery that would have been expensive and really hard on her given her age.  I've never had to put a pet down before and it was really hard.  We got a new puppy (Ryan made it, oh, 2 days before buckling in) but I still miss Morgan.

The new puppy's name is Loki and she is mutt central.  The general consensus is that she has some greyhound in her.  Or maybe whippet, which is supposed to be like a greyhound.  She's a sweetheart and surprisingly (almost freakishly) calm for a puppy, though maybe I just feel that way because I'm comparing her to Morgan as a puppy.  

So, I use this space to post cute little menace things.  So, LM has figured out that all really good children's lit stars orphans.  She's attracted to the idea of being an orphan while still wanting us to be around and take care of her.  Last night, while we were jointly telling a story (more her than me), she put one of her favorite characters, ""bratty child,"" in an orphanage and then stuck the orphanage next door to us with a door leading directly from our house to the orphange that only we could use.  Then she explained that all the good kids in the orphanage got to eat things like macaroni and cheese and ice cream, but the bad kids (like bratty child) had to eat cauliflower.

Oh and she also told me (after reading a book where the kids actually had to do housework) that she didn't want to get bigger because it was ""too much responsibility.""

Well, I'm wasting time before I have to teach my class.  It's a crazy, intensive summer graduate class that I've never taught before.  So, LOADS of prepwork, but so far it seems to be going well."

This seems to have set off a new round of mercenary behavior.  She has suddenly become very caught up in the idea of finding money on the ground (a quest I remember spending a lot of time pursuing when I was young too).  

And, in an unrelated adventure, today she took a packet of crackers and spread a trail of crumbs down the stairs so that the dog would come to her."

"event","So, the new issue around our house is that Andi has finally realized that she is mortal.  We had two nights in a row of her crying for almost an hour because she doesn't want to die.  Although my reading on the topic suggests she's right on schedule for coming to this realization, its also my fault for reading to her within a two-week span a children's book on the Titanic (yes, there is such a thing), Mrs. Frisbee and the Rats of NIMH, and a children's book on space. It was actually the book on space that triggered the severe reaction...I read the section on how the sun will turn into a red giant/white dwarf and die out in five billion years or so.  Apparently, this fact is only non-terrifying if you have fully accepted the fact that life as one knows it will not exist a billion years from now.

So as Ryan was helping me comfort her, he asked ""So I take it we don't want to do the religion thing?""  It took me a minute before I got what he was talking about.  Then we tried, ""well Andi *some* people believe....""  She would have none of it, though the idea of reincarnation gave her pause.  But at one point, she looked up at me and wailed ""Mommy, those are just THEORIES.""

As we were reading about this topic on the web, Ryan came across a story of a 5-year-old who told Santa he wanted ""To live forever"" for Christmas."

hmmm....let's see if anyone actually reads this."

"event","So, last weekend we watched Hedwig and the Angry Inch.  I totally adored!!!! it and told Mr. Menacing I wanted the soundtrack for my birthday (he needs help w/ that kind of thing).  But then today I couldn't stand it any more so Andi and I walked down to the CD store.  The darn thing was $16.95 after taxes!  $16.95!!$%##%@  Then I get home and listen to it on the computer with one of those screensaver/music thingies and I'm thinking how nice it would be if the CD just contained some of the animations from the film, which I liked a lot.  And for $16.95 it really should contain the animations.....And then, here's the rub, I opened up the jacket to look for the lyrics....and there were no lyrics!!!  Now, I know I can easily find the lyrics with a quick Internet search, but then with a quick Internet search I can also DOWNLOAD THE WHOLE THING FOR FREE.  It feels like the recording industry is like one of those people who jumps in front of a train:  the industry wants to kill itself but have somebody else take the blame.

OK, but as Andi and I were dancing to it (and Andi is really a fun dancer--total enthusiasm and tons of energy--'mommy, can we dance rough again?'), I had a revelation:  I want to be a drag queen!  I am serious.  So, I want to have the whole stuffed bra, glam wig, fabulous makeup, right down to the Adam's apple and sultry tenor voice.  But that's the challenge of course.  How do I get to dress up like that while keeping the irony and the DISTANCE from it all?  And, most importantly, how do I get an Adam's apple?  

I guess its something to work on for Halloween.  But honestly I felt something click into place when I realized that my deep, deep more than passion for some Hollywood iconic actresses is not *for* them but to *be* them but in a way that mocks and questions that very desire.  Plus, how cool would it be to have an Adam's apple?

I put on some makeup
Turn on the 8-track
And pull the wig down from the shelf....."

Happy Mother's day to me!  I always swore I would not make a big deal out of mother's day because of all the guilt crap my mom always managed to shift on me, but I'd still like a bit of extra time to myself or something.  My husband sucks.  He's too sick to watch the kid on mother's day but still goes out to play games with his friends."

"event","I spend a lot of the year trying to reconcile myself to living in Louisville, which isn't that bad but isn't that great either.  However, in April/May no reconciliation is needed:  Louisville has this two week long festival during the height of Spring that basically celebrates gambling and drinking.  I hosted my first Derby party this year and it was a great success:  though much harder than I had realized.  There are a lot of traditions to uphold.  It was funny cuz the old men in my department vaciliated between showing paternalistic concern that I do things correctly and feeling bashful about expressing their paternalistic concern.  Anyway, the mint juleps and betting pools were successes (despite one small glitch), weather was perfect, and my house was even clean (this in itself took the majority of two days).

Now I'm just relaxing at the end of the semester, catching up on things I've been wanting to do and walking slowly to various places in my neighborhood, stopping to look at things from a toddler's point of view (we had *quite* the conversation the other day because the metal plates covering up potholes had been removed.  Little menace was very concerned that I grasp the significance of this change).  

I also have been painting the kitchen (bright blue).  Andi has been explaining to everyone about how we had to paint because our walls were filthy.  She was also quite disappointed when she realized that she was not going to be part of the painting process.  Fortunately, Ryan got out some fingerpaints and let her paint the wall with a roller before I got started and that seems to have satisficed her."

Here's some interesting louisville news....a vegan coffeeshop/cafe just opened on the corner of my block!  
It's a very nice space, w/ wireless internet and great hours and fair trade coffeee.  This is causing a huge dilemma for me because I'm very dedicated to the coffeeshop I go to (and love watching all the beautful gay men who come in there) but I feel like I need to support the vegan place (which is actually closer than the other coffee shops).  Now that I'm going to be spending more time working at home, this will be a much bigger dilemma.  I realize many people would not consider trying to decide between two great places a huge problem, but i'm very indecisive....

Of course, the vegan place will almost certainly go out of business with or without my support, but still.

Mood:
Rambling, rambling, slightly giddy from turning in my grades, getting ready to drink mint juleps at the kentucky derby party I'm hosting, trying to research what actually goes in a mint julep, avoiding cleaning my exceptionally dirty house for the party tomorrow."

"event","So last weekend Andi and I went with some friends to the Jewish Community Center where they had some big blow up bouncy things set up for the kids--kind of like a trampoline in a container.  There were two of these things set up--one for 6 and under and one for 7 and up--and of course after about an hour the one thing keeping Andi from TOTAL happiness was my refusal to let her go in the 7 and up one.  The upshot of this is that she now insists that she is 7 and refuses to let us call her a kid because she is 7.  She also insists on referring to me and Ryan and Morgan by our ""numbers,"" except she keeps saying 47 instead of 37 (yikes!).  Oh, and the other day, I asked her to guess Grandma's number, and she said 11.  

Today we had a fabulous day centered around baking Sun Bread!  Yes, not only did I successfully bake bread with the help of a 3-yr-old BUT I also shaped it into a sun.  I will post pictures (maybe).  While we were at the grocery store an employee saw me wandering the bakery aisle and asked if I needed help.  He then not only walked me over to where the yeast was but then launched into a lecture on how a little of it really goes a long, long way.  I started to get offended--come on I *know* what yeast does--but then I looked in my cart:  a bag of flour, a sifter, a rolling pin, and I'm wandering helpless up and down the aisle looking for yeast.  Maybe it wasn't such a stretch after all to assume that I could use some instruction.

Andi loved making the sun bread--especially since I put the bread in her room (which is the warmest room in the house) so it could rise while she was taking a nap.  Wow!  Am I a mom now or what?"

"event","Andi is doing so much cute stuff these days and I want to share it w/ other people, but it seems obnoxious to fill up email inboxes (besides how can I compete with all those ads for penis enlargements)?  So, I thought I might post some stuff up here.  Maybe peregrin8 or mockable_katy will stop by some day.  

So.....I come home today.  Andi is on the couch, shirt off, a flag wrapped around her waist like a skirt, stick in her hand, and dancing while Ryan plays the tamborine.  She ordered me to dance and then yelled at me because I wasn't wearing a dress.  Ryan claimed ignorance on why her shirt was off.  When I asked her about the shirt, she explained that you don't wear shirts with dresses.  Hard to argue with that.  Unfortunately, the whole incident ended in tragedy when Morgan, unable to restrain herself, made a lunge for the stick.  

In an unrelated incident, later this evening she received a time out and spent the whole two minutes wailing, ""but time outs don't make me haaaaappy."""

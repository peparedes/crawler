"event","apparently, my baby has an abscess which i found out last night when it ruptured... the smell was AWFUL, but i think he feels better with the pressure relieved.<br /><br />the good news is i was able to get him a vet appointment for tomorrow since it looks like it's still draining fluid and blood. the bad news is this is SUCH a horrible time for me, financially that i'm not sure i'll be able to afford the bills.<br /><br />he and his brother, wilhelm have brought SO MUCH JOY into my life at such a dark time in my life, it's heartbreaking to think i can't give them what they need....<br /><br /><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v227/beautiful_days/kittehs/DSC_0244.jpg"" alt="""" /><br /><br />this is what he looked like when i brought him home less than a year ago...<br /><br /><lj-cut text=""&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3""><br /><br /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v227/beautiful_days/kittehs/DSC_0236.jpg"" /><br />my sleepy baby!<br /><br />this is what he looks like now:<br /><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v227/beautiful_days/kittehs/n563722131_1611579_9669.jpg"" alt="""" /><br />don't mind my weird face. it's hard to capture that face of his on camera!<br /><br />we love each other:<br /><br /><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v227/beautiful_days/kittehs/n563722131_1596295_9674.jpg"" alt="""" /><br /><br />oh and he has a brother, too... they love each other:<br /><br /><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v227/beautiful_days/kittehs/DSC_0232.jpg"" alt="""" /><br /><br /><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v227/beautiful_days/kittehs/DSC_0186.jpg"" alt="""" /><br /><br />this is one of jacob's favorite spots:<br /><lj-embed id=""10""/><br /><br />i'm just so so worried for him... i have a picture of the wound <a href=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v227/beautiful_days/kittehs/4192_81514862131_563722131_2280956_.jpg"">here</a> if you are curious.. it's about the diameter of a q-tip.. the smell when it ruptured was just unbelievably bad.. i keep flushing it with diluted hydrogen peroxide, though and while it is still draining/icky inside, the smell is gone... poor little buddy.<br /> <br />he and his brother both have claws, and because i am determined to keep that the case, i have to keep them outside when no one is home.. they've come to enjoy being outside since the weather is so nice, and i live in a really really quiet neighborhood in an outlying suburb so it's perfect for them. the problem is there is a cat and i don't know WHO it belongs to, but he (i think it's a he...) is always making trouble and i think jacob must have been bitten</lj-cut><br /><br />so if you could just keep us in your prayers (for you that do) and keep your fingers crossed (for those that don't) for us, that would be SO MUCH APPRECIATED! also, if you have paypal and for some reason you feel inclined to help us that would be so so great as well! if anyone feels so led, i will send them something nice in the mail. (my email is lovesaidgirl@yahoo.com and anything would help towards his antibiotics)<br /><br />c/p to greycatclub<br /><br />thanks so much for your thoughts!"

"event","Hey guys, I started my first community- I wanted a place where I can talk about my favorite books- the ones I found in thriftstores and the like.&nbsp; There are a lot of bibliophile communities, but none that I felt would really appreciate a book written in the 30s&nbsp;that I found in the back of a truck. I'd also like to see things that other people find, and creative things people have done with them, whether it be decoupage or altered books or turning them into journals. Anyway, if that at all sounds interesting, please join!<br /><br /><div class=""ljuser""><a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/biblio_find/profile""><img style=""BORDER-RIGHT: 0px; BORDER-TOP: 0px; VERTICAL-ALIGN: bottom; BORDER-LEFT: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM: 0px"" height=""16"" alt=""[info]"" width=""16"" src=""http://stat.livejournal.com/img/community.gif"" /></a><a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/biblio_find/""><b>biblio_find</b></a></div>"

"event","""Too long, too long..."" the words kept echoing through Anya's mind. ""Two months is too long..."" She was preparing for another tiresome dinner with Marcaous and Liaka tonight. She and Kostya were going to finally get moving! Something was going to happen! The thrill of it clouded her mind. ""Two months: too long"" the mantra continued, fogging out any thoughts of consequences. (She had obviously lost track of time; it had in fact been three months. Poor Anya.)

Heaven only knows what Kostya was thinking.

Marcaous greeted his prisoners with his usual smarmy attitude. ""Ah, my esteemed guests, wlecome once again to my table! I trust the past week has treated you well?""
""Oh, indeed,"" smiled Anya, looking genuinely pleased. 
Pleased? thought Marcaous, that woman hasn't looked pleased since she got here. What in the world could be up? ""Ah, then hunting on my grounds has been enjoyable?"" he asked, casting about for some explanation. 
""Very much so,"" agreed Kostya. 
Marcaous glanced at Liaka, whose eyes were even narrower than usual. He shrugged. They would find out soon enough what was making these two so giddy. ""Well,"" he continued, ""I'm sure you'll be glad to know that we've been following up a couple of your leads, and..."" 
""Lies!"" interrupted Anya, glowing. ""All lies!""
""Pardon me?"" said Liaka, archly.
""All our leads have been lies. We haven't been giving you leads at all. We've been spreading disinformation!"" crowed Kostya.
The table was silent for a long moment.
Then Liaka laughed. ""You think we trusted you completely? You silly, naive pseudo-spies! The only reason we've been keeping you here is so that you can be hostages for us, when the time comes.""
""Well, that, and some of your information has proved unwittingly useful,"" added Marcaous. ""For example, one of your ""false leads"" has informed us that Tristan and Katya will be setting out for Tristan's castle soon. Leaving them, Katya's home, and Tristan's home rather vulnerable. All thanks to you."" He smiled, a sickening sight to Anya and Kostya's fast-sobering minds. ""Of course,"" he went on, ""now that the jig is up, and you know you're hostages, we don't really have to treat you like guests anymore, do we? Guards!"" (two burly and well-armed men appeared) ""show them their new room."" 

Anya and Kostya watched the dungeon door slam shut, not so sure their confession was such a good idea anymore."

"event","As the end of the first trimester approached, Katya and Tristan were became restless.  Not yet far enough along to have her movements hampered Katya was anxious to get out and listen for news of her friends, Tristan was having similar thoughts although was reluctant to let his wife out of the confines of the castle having become ridiculously overprotective in the months following her announcement of the impending expansion of their tiny family.  Furthermore he really wanted to return to his own home, his family having not yet met his wife.  Well, they had met Kalyna, but not as she was now and he knew that his mother would be pleasantly surprized to find that the woman he had married for a political alliance was exactly the woman they both would have wished for him had he been free to make his own choice.  Yes, they would leave immediately he decided, it was just what they needed. A valid excuse to get out and about.  Besides, while it wasn't a long or terribly arduous trip it was one he wouldn't want to make when his wife was further along and the summer and autumn had melted into winter.  Happy to finally have something to do Tristan went to tell his wife his plan pausing only to have the castle chatelaine see about preparing for thier journey and have a message sent to his father's castle.

""Urgh Adam! I am tired of spending all my time in this place! I want to be out and about adventuring like before!  Tristan is being ridiculous keeping me cooped up in here like this!"" Tristan grinned as he listened to his wife finish his rant before he entered their room. ""Are you packed yet?"" he asked, trying to keep a straight face. ""Packed?!"" Katya siad with surprise, hope caused her face to light up like the sun as she jumped off the plush cushin she had been sitting on. ""Where are we going!?""
""To my father's house,"" Tristan watched the sun in her face fade as she imagined the long months cooped up in yet another castle. ""I thought that we could take the long way and listen for firsthand news of Elysia and Brian or even Anya and Kostya. And who knows, one or both of us might get kidnapped in the process,"" he joked hoping to see her face light up as it had a few minutes earlier.  He was rewarded with a cheeky grin and an ecstatic kiss before Katya rushed to pack."

"event","Anya was sick and tired of living with Marcaous. They had been under his roof for nearly two months now and he did little if anything to make their lives more pleasant.  Other then periodically inviting Anya and Kostya to dinner in order to wheedle more information out of them they were relagated to near servant status. ""This is ridiculous!"" she stormed to Kostya, ""and I am running out of things to say, how can we possibly be able to still give him information if we haven't been out of the castle forever?"" Kostya nodded grimly, ""and how long will it take him to realized the same thing. We've got to come up with a new plan or we may all be lost."" Both were silent for a moment and then Anya spoke up.  ""Why don't we just tell him the truth? I mean that might be the best plan besides if we tell him the whole honest truth for once it might just throw him off.""  Kostya grinned, ""Yeah it just might at that."""

"event","A month had passed, and Brian and Elysia had travelled all through the neighboring country. They were pleased with their efforts; a fine spy network had been built. It was time to move on to another country. They returned to the first inn they stopped at, where the innkeeper had become one of their most important sources of information. He was also excellent at spreading rumor. It was late in the night, and the other guests had all gone to sleep. Brian, Elysia, and the innkeeper, whose name was Harold, were discussing the next step.

""Clearly, you need the support of at least one other country,"" Harold was saying. ""We in this country are straightforward people, and we all know that you are the king for us. But it will not be so easy in other places, where they are more slippery, more used to lies and cheats.""
""So where should we go next?"" asked Brian. ""I am inclined toward a country near Tarynsil, so that we can choke off supplies and information to Marcaous. Tarynsil is so small, he'll never survive if he has to stay there without any trade.""
""I...kind of want to see Katya again,"" ventured Elysia, who had become unusually quiet in the past few days.
""Are you crazy?"" said Brian. ""We can't be seen with them. We can't even be seen in their country. It will ruin the whole plan.""
""I just kind of miss her,"" said Elysia.
""Well, maybe later, my dear,"" said Harold, smiling at her. ""Maybe after our position is more secure. It is still too early to run risks like that. Now,"" (and he was all business again) ""I think that the idea of going toward Tarynsil is a good one. If you take this road..."" He and Brian leaned intently over the map, plotting a course and a strategy. Elysia gazed out the window, watching a tree blowing in the wind, absent-mindedly rubbing her abdomen."

"event","Making a big show of being preoccupied with the pregnancy, Katya and Tristan began building their spy network. It began with little notes being brought to them undercover by Miff.  These notes contained information about trustworthy people in the villages and towns along the road traveled by Brian and Elysia.  From these observations Katya and Tristan began sending for all kinds of items 'for the baby' from these townspeople. Everything from a master carpenter to make the baby a cradle to several different midwives for 'consultation'.  Having met the individuals Katya used a subtle spell to test for their honesty and commitment and if they passed, they would be given a certain assignment within their specific area, though most often they were just charged to gather information. Although the baby was an important consideration, Katya and Tristan used these people to create a web of spies all across the the continent. Within a month they had a network to rival that of Marcaous.  And with the cooperation of the other two couples they were fairly certain that Marcaous was none the wiser."

"event","Hungover, Brian and Elysia started out late the next morning. The innkeeper had advised them to head towards the capital, but to take a meandering path so that they could get to know more of the locals. They continued just as they had the day before, giving speeches and listening to grievances. They were getting used to it; most of the people complained about the high taxes and were not fond of Marcaous. They basically just wanted to be left alone. They ended their day on the outskirts of a large-ish town on their way to the capital. They took a room at an inn, and discussed plans over dinner in their room, so as not to attract attention.

""This is not so bad,"" grinned Brian, chewing happily on some bread. ""No, no, it's been quite easy,"" said Elysia thoughtfully. ""But you know, here in these bigger cities, there will be more supporters of Marcaous, not to mention more spies. We should tread more carefully."" ""Yes, but it is important to have a strong presence in the towns,"" said Brian. ""They are, after all, the centers of information and strength."" ""Why don't we stay here a couple of days,"" suggested Miff. ""There's no need to go running all over the country. We don't really have a deadline."" ""Not entirely,"" said Elysia. ""The longer we wait, the greater the foothold Marcaous has, and since no one actively opposes him, except us, it's unlikely that he'll get any weaker."" ""I don't know, the longer he has to do hateful things, the less people will like him. It could be good to let them see for themselves,"" said Brian. ""Well, either way, I think Miff is right. We can afford to spend a couple of days here, and we should. We still really don't know anything about him."" In agreement, they finished eating and went to sleep."

"event","""So tell me about the plans of Kalyna and Tristan,"" Marcaous commanded Anya with a slimy glint in his eye as he scooted closer to her on the ghastly gold, silver and purple patterned couch. ""They don't seem to be really doing anything and I don't know if I should be worried about them or not.""  
""Well,"" Anya began, resisting the urge to explode off the couch in horror, ""The last I heard from them they were working on some family issues - apparently there is some serious tension between Tristan and Kalyna's seven brothers. Also, their own relationship seems to have taken an interesting turn, but she won't tell me what is going on,"" Anya wondered if telling Marcaous of Katya's pregnancy would convince him to relax the security on those two, allowing them more room to establish a spy network from Tarnum's castle, or if it would endanger Kalyna and her baby.  ""I have heard that the crown prince of Kallan might soon have an heir of his own."" Marcaous interrupted her thoughts.  Well, I suppose that solves my dilemma for me, Anya thought. ""I had heard something to that effect as well, my lord,"" she began, hoping to convince him that she had not, in fact, been withholding valuable information from him, ""but I was unsure if it was true or not, Kalyna seems to want to protect the truth of that matter for some reason, so has not come out and told me, but there have been hints.""  
""I see,"" Marcaous mused, ""If they do have a child, will they be likely to withdraw completely from this battle, or should I take the child or the mother hostage to ensure smooth proceedings.""  Anya paused, carefully planning out her response as she noticed Marcaous gaging her response, ""I think,"" she began slowly, ""that taking either Kalyna or the child hostage would do more to hurt your plans than anything else.  At this point the king of Cyren as well as that of Kallan seem to be fairly indifferent to your reign, but if you endanger Kalyna or her child, Kallan will unite with Cyren against you to save the daughter and grandchild.  If you ignore them Cyren and Kallan will have no reason not to continue to ignore you, and Tristan and Kalyna themselves will probably withdraw into family life and leave the fighting and resistance to those without families to worry about.""  When she finished Anya watched Marcaous' face from the corner of her eye, hoping that she had gotten the balance between enough information and too much explanation just right so that he might believe that was her actual reasoning."

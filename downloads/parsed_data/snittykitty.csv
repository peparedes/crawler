I must have read half a dozen times today on various blogs/journals/columns how today is a special day to tell that special someone in your life how you feel about them and they are, in return, supposed to blow overpriced flowers up your badunkadunk, too. Not so much. 

""Love"" one day is a year is as invalid to me as people who attend church on Christmas and Easter. If Mike could only tell me he cared about me by telling me today because the entire country is telling him he's less of a man if he doesn't, it just wouldn't mean anything to me. I define how he cares based on how he treats me the other 364 days a year. The only things I've ever seen come out of Valentine's Day are a wad of people feeling absolutely miserable because they're alone and a bunch of people measuring their worth compared to everyone else they know based on the commercialistic ""devotion"" offered up by someone they love. And I guess it guarentees someone will get laid tonight because they spend those other 364 days not putting out or something? 

Meh, I dunno."

For some reason, the neighborhood kids have decided the most possible fun to be had on the street is by playing at the end of our driveway and in a group of shrubs and plants where our yard meets the driveway. By ""kids"" I mean three kids from one family ages 3-7 and random other neighborhood kids 4-7. Some of the kids use  push scooters, some ride bikes, and some drive those little battery operated Jeeps. And no, parents are nowhere to be seen.

They take their implements of transportation, stow them on our lawn, in our driveway, on the sidewalk, on the street, or whever they want, then proceed to tromp around like it's their property. And of course kids don't play quietly. There's screaming and yelling and toy gun sounds. None of our neighbors even HAVE kids, these kids live at the other end of the street. And don't get me started on why a 3 year old doesn't need to be driving a car down a sidewalk that connects with people's driveways without any adult supervision. 

Our next door neighbors, with whom we share a driveway entrance, add another scare level to the mix: one's an alcoholic and the other is such a horrible driver she's hit the alcoholic's parked car one more than one occassion while backing out the driveway. Yes, the same driveway these kids leave their shit in and play on. It's a recipe for me looking out my office window and seeing something I'd much rather not see. 

So how do I approach this situation? I'd rather not piss off the entire neighborhood because I do have to live here for a few more years. Do I just try asking the kids to stay away from our yard? Do I add some fire ant colonies to the garden area so next time they decide it makes a cool fort they get their legs chewed off? Hornet nests? Do I tell their mother she should monitor her children as ferociously as she does where her dog is, whom she keeps chained to their front steps all day long? 

I keep having this image of me, just after waking up, with full-on bed head, surrounded by cats weaving past my ankles as I stand at the front door with a shotgun. 

What I'd realllllly like to do is walk down to their house and, in front of the kids, tell their mother ""there's a reason we don't have kids. it's because they're a huge responsibility.  or at least, it should be. if we wanted to babysit and monitor kids all day long, we could have our own. howsabout you give it a shot with your lawn monkeys?"" 

But I'm guessing there's a level of social protocol to follow.....any hints?"

"event","I'm a little confused. So, you have to be 19 and a year out of high school to be eligble for the NBA draft. To ensure kids go to finish high school? To encourage them to enter college? Is the NBA also going to create a minimum college GPA requisite to ensure their new recruits and draftees actually GOT an education or are they just interested in knowing they jumped through the hoops? 

Perhaps the goal is to make them risk injury in the college level trying to impress more scouts, live the life of a college student who really isn't in the school for education and degree so much as a stepping stone to the NBA while helping drive the NCAA market, making loads of money for.....whom? 

I guess I'd feel differently about it if, oh, the US Government felt all enlistees to the military should meet a similar requirement. You know, to encourage them to go to college, give them a chance at seeing the world through more educated eyes? Maybe that year between 18 and 19 as an exploratory time where your future is limitless instead of pressuring kids their senior year of high school to join the military and escape their horrible lives so they can risk their lives for pretty miserable pay? 

Why is it ok for the military to recruit IN the high schools for people willing to kill or be killed for such low wages but the NBA needs to wait an extra year or so in order for you to work for them and make millions at risk of just your knees blowing out or something?"

"event","I allow one day a week as a total ""day off."" I don't work out and I allow myself to eat the things I avoid the rest of the week; things that generally aren't that nasty or won't kill you in moderation anyway. I have a whole week of dietary goodness and exercize and look forward to Sunday. This Sunday's plan was to include: a breakfast of Real Eggs, hashbrowns (potato product!!!,) a croissant (real bread made with real flour,) and bacon (not tofu or turkey!; sushi for dinner, and real ice cream (not sugar free sorbet!) for dessert. Generally the ""day off"" would seem like a chance for people to glutton themselves but for me, not so much. Why? Welp, it's simple: my daily diet is pretty simple and plain. Fruits, veggies, very lean meats or fake meat products, no sugar, and only whole grains (with attempts to steer clear of flour all together.) I learned real darned quick if you go buck wild on your day off you really, erm, pay the price the following day. 

So here's where I was going with this: breakfast was good. Two scrambled eggs, a potato galette, two pieces of bacon, and a croissant and they were all the YUM. I was pretty full most of the day but snacked on some dried apple slices and an english muffin. Then we went to my favorite sushi restaurant only to learn it's closed on Sundays. So, we went to a second sushi restaurant. Closed on Sundays. We ended up at a third sushi restaurant which was actually fucking open. Yay. We declined dessert because we were going to get ice cream. But the fucking icecream place closed at 6:30 on Sunday. It was 6:15 when we arrived and they were already closed. WTF. You might think with it being my ""free day"" for food I'd have easily found a runner-up idea but nope. I wanted sweetcream icecream with Heath bar mixin, on a small waffle cone. Mike offered up other ideas and options but I just wasn't interested. He thought we'd come home and find something for dessert but we don't keep that sort of stuff stocked. Instead I cleaned like a fucking maniac for five hours. 

I can't believe this fucking town has three sushi restaurants and two are closed on Sundays. All three are closed the rest of the week from like, 2pm until 5. Two icecream places, one of which closes when the mall does and the other doesn't actually MIX anything into the icecream, they just dump it on top and can't even do that if you order a cone. You'd think you wouldn't have to drive thirty minutes to have a decent selection of restaurants on a Sunday evening."

"event","So, Heaven is this faboo place and when you die you get to hang out with God and angels and the Big J, right? I mean, if you've lived a pius life, having been a good person and followed the scriptures of the bible and asked forgiveness for your sins and stuff? It's the ultimate reward for a life well lived, an eternity in bliss. So when I read about all these people praying for the pope I wonder: are they praying for him to live (and deprive him of his eternal bliss) or are they praying for him to die and finally get to Heaven?

I was discussing the death of the pope with a friend who is obsessed with the Dead Sea scrolls. He's freaking out about the pope and the ""possibility of him dying."" I felt sort of rotten but I had to correct him. There is no possibility the pope will die. He WILL die. It's just a matter of time. The concern my friend has: the death of this pope will bring out the last three popes before ""the end of times."" I don't know how even a person who believes fully in prophecies can get all worked up about the phrase ""end of times."" It's so vague. Maybe it means ""end of the times for Catholicism."" Or, end of times for ""global domination"" Maybe it just means ""the end of times for which they thought they could come up with prophecies?"" I dunno. I just can't get worked out about stuff like that when we still have problems predicting tomorrow's weather.

And poor Terri Shiavo. Best case scenario: she was brain and ""spirit"" deal fifteen years ago and her family has been arguing for their own selfish needs and reasons, having long since lost what the fight was really FOR or worst case scenario: she was somehow concious and spent the last fifteen years in a state of having to watch her family argue over what she'd want, never being able to say a word. Either way, the woman is dead and they're still fucking fighting over her. In all this time they haven't seemed to learn the important lesson of appreciating what they have when they can. Think of all the loved ones they've all missed spending time with bickering over Terri.

And so help me god, if anyone tries to make a Johnnie Cochran, Terri Shiavo, Pope ""they die in threes"" statement, they get a kicking square in the teeth. I mean, people die all the fricken time. They don't DIE in THREES, you're COUNTING in threes. I mean, the third person kicks the bucket and when the next person dies, no one goes ""wait....that's FOUR people....."" Nope, they say ""oh no! we're back at ONE. who will the next two be?"""

Well how else can you get someone to understand how amazing it is to see an inch and a half of fucking ear wax the diameter of a pencil removed from your ear? Even of more fascination to me: there was even more flushed out before the tweezered removal. 

The wax was impacted when I tried to remove water that'd gotten into my ear canal while showering. Yes, I used a Q-tip and yes I'd heard the adage ""never stick anything smaller than your elbow into your ear"" but it was told to me by people who said things like ""if you keep making faces your face will freeze like that"" and ""if you play with your bellybutton your hiney will fall off."" God knows telling me the latter only encouraged my navel playing and I don't even want to think how fat my ass would be if I hadn't put so much effort into making it fall off. 

I was completely embarrassed at the amount of wax the nurse removed. She told me not to be: my case was mild and there really isn't a way to prevent the amount of wax your ear produces. You also can't really make your body disperse the wax with normal means.

At first I was upset at the animals and blahblahblah yeah I eat meat but what about my cute squirrels and woodchucks and birdies blahblahblah. Yeah, I know they killed animals and destroyed their homes when they built this house too, but I didn't have to SEE it. I'll be the first to tell you if I had to milk a cow and then slaughter it to get my cheeseburger I'd like a side of edamame with a dandelion salad side, please; I'm not beyond acknowledging the hypocrisy of it all. Next came my upset over the removal of an acre of trees. Blah, whatever, again. But there is no fucking reason on God's green earth I should have to hear saws and woodchippers and bulldozers at 7 o'clock in the fucking morning. On. A. Sunday.

Now, I'm not going to act like I'm some religious zealout who finds Sunday to be a day of meditation and religious devotion but in this country, Sunday is considered the 'unofficial' sleep late day of the week. And whether it's based in religious reasonings or not, Sunday is the relaxation day, the day a lot of places don't sell booze and some businesses don't even open. It's sort of like how Christmas isn't largely a religious holiday for many people but there's still gift exchange and nativity scenes and people tend to give more to charity at that time of the year.

After spending some of the morning annoyed I finally found the municpal codes for the county in which I reside. NO demolition or construction in residential neighborhoods outside the hours of 8am and 5pm.

About a year ago, I met the owner of the company doing the construction and he was a patronizing asshole. Granted, as a construction guy he doesn't need a bedside manor but it may have behooved him to be a little nicer to the people who's lives he's altering with his subdivision. A little understanding and grace would have gone a long way to preempt the negativity I feel for him and his project. For instance, I don't care about noise at 5:15 or 6 even. This week he's had his crew working until 7pm. No big. Except now I'm highly tempted to be out there at 5pm staring down my watch and with a phone in hand to call the proper authorities. Petty, I know, but rude 7am awakenings to the sounds just 50 feet away put a real damper on my temperament. And just like he doesn't need to be my friend, I don't need to make things easier for him."

I will call them and tell them I won't use their service because 1. they're wasting paper when it's shown in business a phonebook listing generates more business than door to door cold calling, which is also less cost effective and waste more natural resources and 2. who wants a contractor working on your home when even their most basic employer has no respect for time value?"

"event","I've been participating in various online communities ranging form BBS, mailing lists and Usenet for a long time and I can honestly say I've never been so pissed off at a moderator as I was last night. Maybe I've led some idealistic netlife by never encountering someone who was all about censoring threads and banning user,especially all without the benefit of letting them know why. Sure I've seen people who wanted users banned or wanted threads killed but normally those people don't make it to the top of the trash heap. 

so here's the basic scenario, in whining yo-yo fashion:
I post a link to a link to an article on washingtonpost.com which was about as 'on topic' as it gets. A guy replies with confusion about why I posted the link because it doesn't deal with the topic in a more US centric way. I reply that it is on topic and remind him that there are actually people who use the internet that aren't American. He apoligizes and says he didn't mean to complain. I let him know I don't mind people disagreeing and that I'd rather have someone disagree and mean it than apologize and not mean it, that people spend too much time walking on eggshells rather than just saying what they mean and sticking with it. At the end of the day we're all just faceless cogs on the other side of the new age idiot box and you can't really take words as an insult with that in mind.
 
Then *poof*. Entire thread gone not even five minutes after my last post. There was no name-calling, no profanity, nothing. Because there was no warning or explanation, I don't even know wtf was ""wrong."" Wrong. Apparently, anything that could possible offend anyone or with which he doesn't agree is wrong. Apparently telling a 56 year old man to act like a fucking man was toooooooo much. The world may never know.

I'd wondered why, when most posters in the venue appear to be between 30 and 70, at the drop of a pin they'd proclaim ""Delete this thread!"" or ""I don't like seeing #&@(%*$&! used instead of profanity because it reminds me of profanity. Can we make a rule against it?"" but now it's glaringly obvious. They've seen how it works in their Orwellian world. So like a bunch of children, any time someone looks at them cross-eyed, they run to Papa. I'm not talking about people trolling, I'm talking about regular people posting regular conversation type stuff and being banned and censored without warning. I just don't get it. 

So yeah, I'm pissed because I've been censored. I can either bitch about it but do nothing or I can try to build a better machine. Those of you who know me can predict which route I'll go."

"event","I have some great news which should help settle you down and calm your nerves. Janet Jackson was not seen during the worst fucking halftime show in the history of overdone halftime shows wearing something so gauche as a pastie on her nipple. 

Miss Jackson (hey, I'm feelin' nasty) has her nipple pierced and was adorning a NIPPLE SHIELD which rests behind the barbell which PIERCES her NIPPLE. OMFG, stop the press!

Everyone repeat after me: ""Janet Jackson has a pierced nipple and was wearing a nipple shield. She was not wearing a pastie.""

Now, to settle the next Big Question: Why would she wear that NIPPLE SHIELD if she weren't planning on exposing herself?

Have you ever worn a matching bra and panty set, maybe made out of lace with a cute little faux pearl bow? Did you have intentions of walking down Main Street so everyone ELSE could see how sexy you thought it was? Did you think your significant other was going to parade through his office in those red satin boxers you bought him that year for Valentine's Day? Sometimes we do things for ourselves, our own senses of aesthetics or pleasure and we don't need to fucking share them with our next door neighbors.

That said, if you're going to stand on national television with your booblies hanging out and waving to the crowd, this just may not apply to you.

Granted, one might not normally choose to wear a pointy metal shield with vinyl on a day to day basis, but when you've got that sort of expendable income, another couple hundred on a replacement bra cover is probably as meaningless as me buying bottled water."

"event","After a really great night of sleep, I woke up this morning to Mike's alarm. When I fell back to sleep I had some really bizarre dreams that all sort of point to me feeling ignored and taken advantage of by family. At the end of the dreams, I discovered that Prada and Dolce had been let out by one of my cousins and no one bothered to tell me. They tried to tell me they'd found them and presented me with two cats they said were Prada and Dolce. ""Prada"" had no white on her face and was missing her hind leg. She was also about 3 years old. ""Dolce"" was a long haired cat with a really round face and bulging eyes and had the wrong type of collar on. When I told them all I knew those weren't my cats, they all shrugged their shoulders and walked away. It's no huge secret I wish I had a better relationship with my brother and sister but things just don't seem to point to that happening. The biggest obstacle with my brother is the distance between us and the fact that he resented me growing up and never developing a relationship with him as a child. The problem with my sister is, uh, a little more complex. Mostly, I think, it's her being scared of the influence I'd have on her kids...she wants little clones of herself and I'd rather them develop into whomever they really are. If my sister had her way, my 14 year old niece would be dressing in cartoon character clothing and espousing the wonders of Tweety Bird until she's into her 40's and my five year old niece would continue to perform her tricks and stunts on command. That sounds rather harsh. Hm. No, I don't take it back though.

The only thing it seems like the three of us really have in common is our father and whatever genetics nature passed on. It's sort of funny, they grew up being jealous of me living with him and I was jealous of them because they didn't have to live with him. If they came to visit, they weren't punished or yelled out and it seemed they were showered with attention and gifts. They never thought he gave them anything. Front the vantage points of adults we all see things differently about how things were back then but it didn't really repair our relationships with each other. Still, to get the three of us in the room is to watch an arguement for nature over nuture."

"event","Both kittens came out of the spaying well. Matter of fact, just a couple of hours after the spay they were running around the house as if they were strung out on crack. We had to put them back in the crate and give them sedatives to calm them down some. 

The next morning, Dolce was really weak. She wasn't eating or drinking water. I called the vet and she said sometimes the meds make them lose their appetite for sometimes up to 24 hours but if she wasn't eating by that night to let them know. Thursday night we were feeding her by syringe and she was looking gaunt. She had no interest in food (not even tuna) and didn't want to play. We knew we'd have to take her to the vet on Friday. Friday they loaded her up with fluids via injection (which didn't go over so well with her because she HATES getting shots) and then more injections with antibiotics. By Saturday morning she looked so much better and was eating again. Her appetite continued to improve and she started getting playful again. Then, her incision started weeping. Clearish lymph, and constantly. We kept monitoring it but weren't too concerned. Then, she gushed lymph and it freaked both of us out. We called the vet and went it for another visit right away. 

Dolce hadn't seen this vet before but I knew he was really good because I'd taken Sable to him last year. All the vets at this practice are good but I think he's probably the best in terms of pet handling. I brought him up to date on what had been going on with her and told him about the pretty large amount of fluid that was coming out of her wound. I guess vets get told a lot of exaggerated stories from scared owners so they don't take things like that as ""real"" but when he started examining her and even more fluid just spilled out of her, he was surprised. He said he hadn't ever seen anything that bad in terms of drainage before. He seemed pretty certain it was a suture reaction though. He continued to press her abdomen and fluid continued to come out sort of like squeezing a little turkey baster. He prescribed even more antibiotics, but in pill form. He showed me how to give her pills with the least effort possible. I never knew giving a cat a pill could be so easy. He also gave her an injection of cortisone. He was so fast, he gave her the shot before Mike and I saw it happen. We thought he went to give the injection but she moved and hissed. We just knew it was going to be impossible to get her to sit still again so he could try. But in the quick flinch/hiss, he'd given her the shot! Vet ninja. wooooosh! He also told us to take the collar off, that licking the wound wasn't going to make it worse and would only stress her out more. We pretty much are supposed to let her carry on however she can. That pretty much means running through the house, playing and being a kitten.

Apparently, the vet was worried a little more than he let on. He called this morning at 7am to check on her. She's still fine but we have a followup appointment for her tomorrow (presuming she doesn't have a change to the worse today.) If she doesn't heal up they're going to have to operate again to see what exactly is going on and make sure there isn't something wrong with the sutures inside. I'll be glad when I can sleep through the night and not be so worried."

It'd explain why I've only put 70,000 miles on my old car in the last ten years. So yes, coming soon: plans that involve me driving. Before, Mike always drove because, well, why ride in a station wagon when you can ride in a fany schmancy SUV or sedan? Now, I know my car isn't quite on par with his work vehicle, an Acura something-something Type-S (which means ""sport"") but I want to drive. I've had the car nearly a month and have 200 miles on it, which includes the 45 back from the dealership we bought it from. Speaking of the dealership, they sent me a survey. They shouldn't've oughtta done that, I tells ya. I'm not the kind of gal who will absentmindedly fill out a survey; if I'm taking time to fill it out, you'll get my real opinion. Which, while they think they might want, they won't like. But yes, I like my new car. Especially now that I know it wasn't broken but I was. For some of you, that isn't a big news flash. 

Tomorrow the keeetons go in for spaying. I thought they were to go in today, so I followed the pre-op protocol last night: no food after 9pm and no water after 7am this morning.

So tonight the kittens (as well as Sable and Eman) get to go through the whole thing again. Don't worry, none of the cats will suffer without food for 8 hours or so. Ain't nobody in this house underfed.

After over a month of calling and visiting different optometrists in the area trying to find one who agreed with BCBS New Jersey as to whether they accepted BCBS NJ insurance, I finally found one who said ""yes."" I made appointments for both me and Mike and everything went swell. I met their in-house optician, showed him some vintage frames, and he was excited to work on something different for a change. Everything was swell until we went to pay and then we discovered the BCBS NJ has contracted their vision coverage out to another company. This company, DAVIS, isn't accepted my the optometrist. Any guess as to where we got the referral to the office? BCBS NJ's website. I also called, spoke to a representative, and confirmed the site was up to date. Net end result: not only was that visit not covered, but upon further investigation we learned that we have no vision coverage outside New Jersey, whatsoever. Right now Mike is wallowing in a giant vat of ""I told you so"" which is sort of nice considering I didn't even have to say it. Now he's got to go to his mom and tell her the coverage the company offers doesn't work for us and ask to have BCBS Maryland coverage instead. Like I suggested. Five friggin months ago. But no, I won't say ""I told you so."" I don't have to, it's implied in my correctness.

So, is it a blog? Is it a diary? A journal, perhaps? It's a question someone else raised in their, uh, online existance and I thought it warrented discussion. Like whoa. I feel far more simplistic about this than I thought; it doesn't really matter to me what you call it. I personally call it a journal, but whatever works for you works for me. I'm not really concerned with the label. I'm also not concerned with the popularity of blogs. I figure they're in vogue right now and while I've had one for quite a while when they weren't mainstream, I'll still have mine when it's considered gauche or old school. Which reminds me of a (mostly unrelated) anectdote from when Mike and I went out to eat in Williamsburg two weeks ago. He was wearing a Chewbacca shirt and I was wearing a Black Flag hoodie. The waiter, full of ""must identify with my customers in order to shake them down for better tips while providing lackluster service"" raised his fist, almost black-power like, and said ""Black Flag Rules!"" and then turned to Mike and said ""Chewbacca Rules, man!"" He went on to proclaim ""you guys are representing the Old School in my section. Right on!""  I told Mike it really was a shame, we aren't ""old school,"" we're just old. 

And, in the Worst Mom in the World competition, I nominate.....ME. It seems a cruel fate, but each pet in my home is doomed to be either abandoned outside or locked in a closet at least once, generally overnight. 

Sable spent eight hours outside on our balcony while we lived in San Diego. Neither Mike nor I realized she wasn't in the apartment before we went to bed but he did hear her meows outside when he got ready for work the next morning. She'd apparently snuck outside while we were bringing in groceries. For the rest of the year we lived in San Diego, Sable wore a bell collar. In the second Alexandria apartment, she was locked in the coat closet for hours and never even made a peep. When I went to put food down for the cats, I realized she didn't come and I went on to search for her. She walked out of the closet like nothing ever happened.

At that same apartment, Eman snuck outside to the balcony and we didn't notice. The next morning, I noticed streaks of some sort on the sliding door screen as the sun caught it. A moment later, I saw Eman throwing herself against the door, trying to open it or knock it down and saw her meow but couldn't hear it. I opened the door and apologized profusely. She didn't care, she was inside. Bring on the attention! Where's the food? Poor thing even had a potty outside. I wondered how long she held it so she wouldn't have to go outside the box. 

And so the circle continues. With Mike on the road until Saturday, I was wondering how the kittens would react. The little bastards, with their middle of the night grooming. No, not themselves, us. Licking our hands, nails, faces, ears. Last night, the damned kittens wouldn't stop. It was as if they didn't want me to sleep. About 5am I realized it was just Prada. For some reason she was determined to not let me sleep. Finally, after 7am, I gave up. I went downstairs to feed all four hellions and realized there was no Dolce. Oh shit. Where the hell is Dolce. Basement? No. Inside the desk? No. Asleep in the furnace? No. I called to her ""Dolce?"" but really, the kittens don't know their names just yet. Then I heard it. The most pathetic mewmewmewmew EVER, and it came from- where? I looked around the den. I checked the closet. Oh. Fuck. The garage. I opened the door to the garage and I expected her to bound inside with excitement and yay and they found me and oh boy I won't ever do that again. She strolled in, looked up a me, meowed, and began weaving her body between my ankles. Sweet Jesus. She snuck by me while I was carrying last night's litterbox roundup out. The damned kittens are already wearing bells and I didn't hear her. Oof. I'm double fired. She's fine. She ate some food and within a couple of minutes was romping around with her sister. Heck, it's over an hour later now and she's still getting her play on. 

Yep, not ever gonna be ready for kids."

I'm glad to report that I've lost another two pounds. Slow and steady weight loss is fine with me: it didn't take me a couple of months to put on the weight and I can't very well expect it to fall off of me over a couple of months either. Well, five and a half months, anyway. I found the big secret was all the sugar in my diet, sugar I didn't even realize I was eating. Lowfat yogurt, protien bars, marinara, Slimfast.....all had added sugars, and a pretty good amount of them too. Then there was me thinking ""eat a plain baked potato for lunch"" and ""have a bagel with no fat cream cheese"" for breakfast were good diet suggestions too. Nope. They were just making my body produce insulin and woodaddy did it like to store it. I've never been one for fad diets (and really, I've never been on one) but I thank the South Beach diet for opening my eyes in ways other dietary reading hadn't. Ok, enough of the hokey ""it saved my relationship and saved my life"" crap. It didn't really do either, but it was an enlightening read. 

I'm going to be revamping around here, making things a little more visually appealing. No, that won't include me removing my picture from the page."

I came home to discover the hostas were almost all eaten down to nubs. Yes, the hostas that I hated when we bought the house. Yes, the hostas we spent an entire weekend digging out of the flowerbed. Yes, the hostas we spent an entire day replanting once we realized we couldn't really afford to buy different plants for the flowerbed this Spring, the hostas I deslugged, fertilized, surrounded with mulch and have babied for 5 months so they wouldn't look like crap. <i> Those </i> hostas. At first I thought it was a rabbit. Then I saw now much had been eaten since last night and knew it'd have been an army of rabbits, really big ones. I thought ""deer?"" but given the proximity to the driveway, I didn't think it was. Now, having bared witness to the culprit, I know the truth: Pat the Woodchuck has a fierce appetite for hosta destruction. Little bastard. He's damned lucky I'm of the opinion we need to share space with the wildlife. I get irked every time I see a news story about bears wandering into neighborhoods and homeowners freaking out. Here's a thought: when you bought that house with four acres of land backed up against a state park, did you think you wouldn't have a problem bears in your trees, raccoons in your trash, and deer devouring your flower garden? So yeah, the most I'd do is douse the hostas with some sort of animal piss based product and try to get Pat to eat something else. Maybe my neighbor's tomatos or something. Who knows."

"event","I'm going to dedicate my morning crankiness to a special cause, complaining. I'm going to couple it with calling people out. Two great tastes that taste great together, indeed.

So here's the rub. You're tired of people poking fun of you because of your appearance (how you choose to look and present yourself to the world at large) and want to be taken for the person you are, not the person you appear to be. I understand completely. You're wealthy, successful in your own right, and admired by a lot of your friends and peers. You have spoken ""religion"" in to and out out existance. You have loyalist minions who like to think of you as a God. You are just a person. You are a person who was once obese. You indulge in illegal drugs, often. You inbibe alcoholic beverages, a lot. You have made those choices for yourself and they are yours to make, you're an adult. 

So now, you're not obese. Because you're no longer fat, do you really think you're ""all clear"" to police and mock the fat people of the world? Yeah, yeah, bully for your acknowledging ""all fat people aren't fat because of their diet."" You're a real fucking prince. You can't understand how they can make choices that will slowly kill their bodies? They probably can't understand how you can smoke, eat, snort, shoot up or do whatever else the fuck it is you do, it being toxic, killing your brain,  <i>illegal</i> and such.

Then there's the real insult: it's ""ok"" to mock group X beacause I used to be one of them/date one of them/my sister is married to one of them. Two words: bull  and shit. 

The sad fact is people are overweight. But what gives any person the right to condescend to them, mock them, or belittle them in any way? They are people who are making choices in their life. Choices that don't directly affect you. Is their choice to eat two Big Macs any better or worse than your choice to partake in the drug culture? 

Sometimes, people need to get over themselves and practice what they preach."

"event","I'm not really one for diets. I have, for the most part, a pretty decent diet in that I eat a lot of fruits and veggies and mostly lean meats. I don't often eat fried foods. I have about one soda a week (maybe) and two cups of coffee a day. I drink a fair amount of water. We hardly ever have snack foods like potato chips or corn chips and we have all the leftover halloween candy still sitting (untouched) on the fridge waiting for this October. Still, I wanted to give my weight loss efforts a boost and decided I'd try the South Beach Diet. Meh.

The first two weeks of the diet are the big challenge. Basically, no real carbs. While I don't eat what I consider a lot of carbs, I'm definitely missing them now. It's day four and I honestly don't know if I have two weeks of this diet in me. A normal day would have me eat breakfast (a bowl of lowfat granola cereal with 1% milk,) a mid morning snack of a half cup yogurt and some fruit, a sandwhich of whole grain bread, turkey or ham with a slice of lowfat cheese, an afternoon snack of fruit or a protien bar, and a basic meat/veggie/starch dinner. Well, when you take away my ability to have any breads, fruits, cereals, and most dairy I'm not left with a lot I can eat. A set list of veggies and meats, with nuts and ricotta cheese. No soda, no fruit juice, no dairy creamer or sugar in my coffee. In short, I don't know if I see myself on this diet for two weeks. It's tapped in to the core of my favorite things: going to the movies and eating popcorn, waffles or pancakes on the weekend, a cheeseburger on a bun, orange juice with my breakfast....It's simply the idea I can't have a lot of those things that is pissing me off. I don't crave them, I hardly ever get food cravings (sometimes maybe for sushi or hot Krispy Kreme donuts) but god damned it, I was raised in the South. Dinner means: meat, two veggies, a starch and bread. My plate looks so pathetic with a clump of fish and a pile of cauliflower mushed to ""trick"" my palette into thinking I'm having mashed potatos. No dice. 

Grocery shopping today was really pathetic. I found myself walking down the snack isle in search of peanuts and was suddenly irked by all the cheese curls and pretzels I can't have. I don't even know when the last time I had a cheese curl <i>was</i>  so why was I trying not to make eye contact with them? I really miss the idea of being able to eat the things I like and sometimes even the things I don't like. It isn't that I don't have some level of willpower, I've been going to the gym five days a week now since April 1, something I'm really proud of. At any rate, I get to incorporate the stuff I like back in, sparingly, but for two weeks I'm just going to bitch a lot about this diet."

I have absolutely no desire to have and raise children, I don't particularly enjoy cooking, and I make one of the world's worse housewives. I don't like living in a messy place, but I just so often can't be bothered to clean. With this in mind, I am now trying a new approach and my mother would be ohsoproud: the daily task list. Along with some helpful advice gleaned from Heloise (she suggests timing how long it takes to do specific chores and then telling your kids....""Clean the litterbox, it only takes five minutes) I am hoping a ""one task a day"" thing will help. Today's task? Bathroom cleaning. The bathrooms aren't particularly gross or anything (I can't stand showering in a modly shower and can't even make myself use the toilet if it's overgrown with nastiness) so it should be easy.

"event","I'm not big on labels; I seem them as more confining than defining. I'm not talking about whose name you've got plastered across the ass of your favorite pair of jeans ""label"" but rather why people need labels like ""straight edge"" or ""vegan"" etc. Labeling yourself tells people ""judge me on this standard"" sort of like a CAB piece of beef at the butcher shop. I'm not saying ideals or principles are wrong, I'm just wondering why people need to define themselves by pre-established labels. If you're going to insist on labeling yourself, I insist on truth in advertising.

Example A: A guy who has labeled himself SXE. He doesn't pop pills, drink, smoke, or put toxins in his body. Some sxe'ers think having premarital sex is wrong and some think as long as it's monogamous it's ok. This guy is married. But......he's a swinger. Always off at the local clubs hitting on different chicks and sleeping around. One night flings are the norm. If he hadn't gone through the trouble of proclaiming his edge and being sore core about it, his sexual life wouldn't have even warrented commentary from me. Still, he needed to be identified as Edge. 

Example B: A guy who wants to stop using animal byproducts. He wants to be ""vegan."" His trauma? He wants to keep his favorite leather biker jacket, boots, and leather bracelet. You know, I don't see the problem with him discontinuing the use of animal goods, but why does he have to call himself ""vegan""? Can't he just say ""I am no longer buying animal goods""? He isn't being a hypocrit if he hasn't claimed ""Veganism"" and no one really gives a crap if he doesn't eat cheese but wears his 15 year old coat unless he cries ""vegan.""

Pigeonholing yourself to fit into predefined labels for the sake of....what? It just doesn't make sense to me. Be a person, make the choices that are right for you and make you happy. If you can do it without labeling yourself, you can be who you want and on your own terms."

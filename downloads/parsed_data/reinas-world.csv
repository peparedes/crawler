"event","Well yeah last night was very eventful. 
Lesson learned, you should chresh people as much as you can and live life to its fullest because you could lose them or it in an instant. I didn't lose anyone but could've. It scared the hell out of me. At like 11:30pm last night my dad got into a big car accedent. The guy was drunk and ran a red light at 60mph, hit my dad on the drivers side door. Then the guy got out of his car and took off running. I got the call from the nurse and was all freaked. So we went down there and didn't get to see him till 1am. Stayed at the hospital till 2am. And today I was there from 12pm till 6pm. My dad was so lucky though. He has 6 fracktured ribs, 2 brocken ribs, and a punctured lung. The doctor said we coul.da lost him if the guy was going a bit faster. Ughhh...I feel so weird, like I'm way out of i9t. And the worst part is that he can't come home for 3-4 days. Gosh, I'm so grateful that he is ok, I love my dad so much.
But I think the worst part of this whole thing is when he was telling me about it. He said  when he saw the guy coming he thought that he was going to die. He was telling me all this stuff and it made me think. I guess it sounds stupid to be nice to everyone cus you may lose them until you get scared like i did. I just want everyone to know that I love them all and hope you have a great night. I just can't wait till my dad comes home.
bye bye"

"event","If you think this entree is about a certain fight than don't worry cus its not...I say nothing about it. So you can keep on reading! :)

Well I found out that I am a horrible person, that doesn't deserve friends, or as a matter of fact I deserve nothing. I hate it when ppl make me feel like this! Its not just one person its a lot of ppl. Its dumb cus ppl don't think about there actions, thats when they hurt ppl. I also hate how I always dream the world to be so perfect! I sit there and pretend everything is all right, Its like I am and actor! I pretend there is nothing wrong, the world is perfect, and nothing could bring me down! But then I start to really believe it! Then suddenley my world crumbles and I see the real world and my world of happiness and joy won't let me back in! I wish I could go back in time, to when I was little...and my parents loved me till no end, I had stupid problems that always went away, and nothing could bring me down. Atleast I know that when times aren't so great I have friends to help me through it! I love all of u guys, even if u think I'm mad at u I still love u! And thanx for helping me cross over back into my world!
Anyways today really sucked! Went to knotts scary farm and my brother made a listening mistake on the phone so yeah that didn't work out. And I never got a call from anyone to go any where so I hung with my dad! It was great until we had to go home. You see my dad has a hurnia and is going into surgey so yeah he couldn't really do much. Now I sit here waiting for some one to call or somethig! And on top of it all I lost my cell phone! Atleast i get a brand spankin new one! well g2g! bye"

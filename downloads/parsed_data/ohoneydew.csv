"event","Well, here's the latest news on my not so interesting life.

I'm moving!

*dances*cheers*dances some more*

Now to where, I can just say to a completely different part of the country.  Some place in Virginia.....and that's all I'm saying.  *smiles*

This to me is super exciting.  I've never cared for my current area of residence, in fact I've hated it and loathed it and whatever other negative emotion you can think of, and this will probably be one of the more important steps in my life that I've taken.  I mean, yeah there was some good things that happened but....the bad seriously outweighs the positive and '09 showed me that I need to move on.  It's gotten to the point that I'm afraid of what will happen to me if I don't.

So there's a lot of change going on as far as that goes and I feel much lighter because of it.

However....there is a downside to this (isn't there always?).

I will be leaving behind some unfinished business.  Family issues that probably will never get resolved and that will hold some rather unpleasant ramifications in my possible future.  I can't say that any effort on my part will make this any better for either parties involved but I'm going to try.  Whatever happens after that, I've decided to simply let the chips fall where they may and leave it at that.

All in all though....this is huge.  As a person I feel as though I'm almost completely - I don't want to say whole since there is a lot I could do to improve myself - at peace with who I am and have finally grown into the type of adult and human being I want to be.  With that being said, I'm thinking that my future journal entries will begin to have a much more lighthearted tone than they have had in the past.  Or will be less about the things that trouble me and focus more on the stuff I enjoy.

Anyway, that's a quick update on how I'm doing and with luck (and effort, of course) I'll be back with more good news and POSITIVE (my word for the month) stuff to talk about.

Harakiri out.  *waves*"

"event","You know when a personal relationship has changed when that uncomfortable feeling in the pit of your stomach gnaws tiny holes throughout your soft insides.

It's kind of like having your room a certain way for so long, you know it like the back of your hand and you never have any trouble figuring out what goes where, only to rearrange it out of the blue for no apparent reason.  It's all the same stuff, the same furniture that you've had since you moved in, but the layout is completely unfamiliar and you almost want to put everything back the way it was because it's just easier than having to build up that old comfort.

That's what it's like when the person you love makes a major change in their lives, a complete reworking of their persona and lifestyle, and that not quite familiarity makes me feel incredibly.....young and small.  I want to be judgmental and opinionated about those changes but I've become disoriented and doubtful in what I once believed to be the truth.

And it makes it really hard to form any solid reasoning when people all around me have no problem saying exactly what they think of the person who changed and.....

You know I could really use one those 'Easy' button thingies they sell as gag gifts.  Only I want one that actually works.

But other than that, I had a wonderful holiday.  Here's hoping that people all over the world were able to push aside any negativity/worries/confusion and were simply able to enjoy the things in their lives that are worth enjoying.

"event","I want to put a stop to all my melodrama.  Seriously, it's giving me a headache and as much as I want to curl up under my blankets and pretend like the things that bother me don't exist I know it won't make me feel any better.

So no more whining, griping, monologuing, bitching, so on and so forth about how much my life blows.  I'll save that for the leather journal I hate to love that way I can at least appear a little less unhappy.

....I've said this before but I'll just start over from square one.

Anyway, I really should go to bed.  These late nights do nothing to help my mood.

Before that, let me just say Little Big Planet is deceptively easy and incredibly addicting despite how freaking precise you need to be with the controls most of the time.  Being able to leave the other player to die while you go racing off to the next platform is also deliciously satisfying even though it takes away from your collective lives.  I completely agree with my brother when he demands that the game should be in our collection.

It's a nice break from playing RE5 when the game decides to be a complete bastard and gyps me out of shotgun ammo in Mercenaries mode.  *shakes fist*"

"event","Looking back, I really want to post more ficcage.

'In Want Of A Good Wife' needs an update because damn it, there was actually something of a plan going down with that idea and I have another WIP that probably should be archived here just for the sake of having it.  It's already posted on FF.net so why not keep it here too, right?

Besides, writing helps keep me sane when everything else falls to pieces.  Which reminds me that there's a couple of other things that I need to start working on too...."

"event","It's been a long time.  Almost half a year later, I'm home again and I've long since realized that this place can no longer be called home.

The family is broken up, and as much as I wish things would work out for the better, I can't say I have much faith for the future.

Well...not much faith for my future specifically.

This past year has been chock full of bad news on top of even worse news and I'm really just tired.  Emotionally, I'm not angry or upset, not exactly depressed...if I had to name it at all, I would say I feel empty.  My high standards and admittedly romanticized morals and ideals have left me with the thought that what I feel is insignificant.  And it is nothing special to begin with.  People everywhere are becoming disenchanted to things like love and honesty, or so it seems to me, and why bother?  If one person says this then what difference does it make to speak my mind when the message is essentially the same?

I think I'm overanalyzing but.....I wish everything didn't feel so monotonous.

Maybe I need to stop believing that having someone I can spend the rest of my life with will make the world a happier place when I feel like there's nothing left in me to love to begin with.

Ugh.....whatever happened to those carefree days I took for granted....

I'm far too serious for my own good."

"event","This is without a doubt my favorite time of year.  The leaves falling, the wind howling, the cold seeping in and pumpkins as far as the eye can see...

I love it.

Everything I've been eating and drinking - from pumpkin spice coffee to pumpkin pie, I won't be happy until the stuff is coming out of my ears.  And pumpkin carving - can't forget about that!  

This year I stuck to the family tradition of going all out and did a Raccoon Mario.  Nearly 5 hours of carving - well skinning really - and I pulled off a pretty darn good Mario if I do say so myself.  My fingers are sore and will probably cramp horribly tomorrow but hey, Dad will be proud!

... Ah, who the hell am I kidding?  As much fun as I had today, I have to admit it wasn't the same.

With the family all torn to shreds the holiday was... heartbreaking.  I teared up on the phone with my Dad when he asked if we were doing pumpkins this year (my sister and her family that is).  I did the Mario for my nephew (he loves the little plumber to death) and my sister did a decent ghoul pumpkin face.  But it wasn't the same without my Dad working on his own pumpkin right there with us.  Hell, he didn't even bother with any of it this year...

That's one of our holiday highlights you could say... pumpkin carving and horror movie marathons the entire week of.

I miss it.  Out of all the holidays, I'd say this is the one we put the most effort into.  It pained me to sit down, sketch out the drawing and cut into the pumpkin - I almost didn't bother.  I had half a mind to cut out a half-assed triangle face it felt that wrong to me...

And it kills me to know that nobody celebrated it at home.

So for those of you out there who spent it with your family, holding onto those few moments of true family togetherness... I envy you.  I know that sounds overly dramatic but every day that goes by without it, I realize that it wasn't worth losing.

We were a dysfunctional family - some would even say an abusive family - but damn it, we were a family.

As much as I am an anti-social sardonic bitch hell bent on ridiculing the world for every fault and flaw it has... I wouldn't be here if it weren't for them.  I might lie about my need for them, deny it until I'm blue in the face, but truthfully, they are the reason I get out of bed in the morning.

Not for me, not for life, not for anyone else in the world... I had a good life because of them.  It's too late now, and saying these things changes nothing, but I'll remember fondly, lovingly, the memories I have.

Happy Halloween, everyone."

"event","I'm tired but I really don't want to go to bed.

...I was going to rant and rave about how my life pretty much equates to a big heap of nothing but I just don't have the energy.

All in all, I want to curl up and bawl my fucking eyes out.

Sometimes I think that I hate everything.  I hate my life, I hate my family, I hate the love I wish I had, I hate hate hate hate....

And then I realize the hate I feel isn't there at all and I'm simply detached.

I'm outside of it all.

I could get up off of this couch with nothing but the clothes on my back, and I could walk out the door.  I could walk far away from this place, away from everyone and everything.

.....And that would be okay with me.

Jesus fucking Christ, it's bullshit - what I just said.

But if there was a way for me to be completely isolated and still be able to have the things that I wanted....I wouldn't be here right now."

<lj-cut text=""Drabble #1"">God is cruel.  The Creator, the ultimate being of the universe, the bearer of all things is cruel to his children.

And he is mad.  Not only cruel, but heartless in his attempts at creating beings even more extraordinary than Metatron and Sandalphon.  Even greater still than Alexiel and her younger twin brother, Rosiel.

Yes, God is a cold bastard of a father to his children!

My sister and I are living proof of that.

We are an experiment gone wrong.  A poor result of an improper equation that not only failed to copy the original, but was so degenerate as to damn our newborn souls to an existence of endless suffering.

You see it was the rage of having to share a single body with my sister.  No, it was utter madness!  -Madness, madness, where does it go?!  In the blood, in the -

Astarte, the wretched fool.  Too weak, too willing to play by the Creator's rules - not eager, but desperate for something that is forbidden, only willing to play by the rules to get it, that squalling worthless piece of - and it makes me sick!

Then The Shining One came into power.  A demon king, who offered what our Father wouldn't.  He used elemental magic and human science to bring us to a ruined life but he would not use it again to correct the mistake.  But Lucifel...he offered and reasoned, and how could I refuse - please, brother, don't -?

Not only would he separate us, he would give us two bodies, the way we were meant to be....and a kingdom to rule.  Our own domain...where I could - no, please! - keep Astarte, that whore, under firm control....where I could -

No, I will not refuse him.  I will take his side, and rage freely!  Strike back at that Thing and drink of innocent blood!

And Astarte - stop it, brother! why?! why won't you - will always...</lj-cut>"

I know that it's been ages since I last updated this thing but due to certain situations and the general loss of any previous stability both imagined and real, I just dropped off the face of the earth until I felt like I could get things back on track.

Hence, I have come back to life and with a few tasty little tidbits if I do say so myself....which I do.

So yeah.  I haven't died and I still insist on keeping my cozy spot in the world of the Internets' if only to breath in the metaphorical oxygen that would probably be well spent on someone who, you know, would use it more productively.  And with more enthusiasm I'm sure but whatever.

I'm greedy and I don't plan on giving up yet.

"event","Well, I'll admit at this very moment, that I have lost almost any and all interest in the Internet.

I can't stand any of it.  The freedom of being completely limitless in who you are and how you live your life through the virtual world both saddens and disgusts me.  It's so easy, to present yourself as something you are not or maybe make yourself more than you really are.  I'm not singling any one person out when I say this, because truthfully, what I say here could also apply to the person I was 4 years ago.

Actually, it's not even the Internet that is making me feel this dejection, this pathetic despair, if that what it can be called.  Relationships, loving, beneficial, professional, casual, abusive, all of these and more; I deny them, scorn them, pretend that I have no part in those bonds between myself and everyone else.

I'm not sure this makes sense, or if it's relevant to any particular thing....I'm really just tired of feeling as if emotions hold no real meaning.  As if words like love and eternity, if destiny and the soul itself are just ideals that people use to fantasize but never put forth into tangible reality.  Ugh, I don't know, I'm rambling but as I'm typing these words, I feel as if I've become ice and numb to the warmth I felt but didn't possess a month ago.

I'm not sure if I'll recover from this....I feel altered in some inexplicable way....or rather I feel the future that was waiting for me has changed so dramatically as to seem as though it has disappeared all together.

I suppose, if I were to paint a mental picture of this, I would paint an endless ocean of fluctuating colors and random bottomless figures that both expand and collapse under a sky that rushes forever and beyond a horizon I can't see.

I'm not caged in; I'm floating weightlessly in the middle of a world that has no physical hold on me.  And it is terrifying."

"event","Fucking hell.  That about sums up my past two weeks and then some.

For whatever reason, my mom has decided to throw out 20 plus years of marriage with a loyal (and for the most part loving) husband and has said 'screw it'.  Literally.  My mom has turned into a virtual stranger in the household and it pains me to realize that it has been that for a long time now.

But what's making it so difficult is knowing that my dad is completely broken over the divorce.  Not outwardly, not anymore at least.  It just unnerves me when he calls, checking in on me and my brother, telling us that he loves us every day...just generally being clingy and emotional when before he just needed the occasional bonding time spent over dinner and a movie.

Of course, the icing on the cake is how my mother just doesn't...care.  My dad is doing everything to fix himself, to turn himself into someone who is attractive and appealing (he quit smoking the day after she told him they were getting divorced for Christ's sake!), and it makes absolutely no difference to her.  I'm not sure she even notices.  And I know why too even though I refuse to say anything about it.  Not to my dad anyway.  It would kill him to know that she's having online affairs left and right and it makes me want to vomit when she sits there and says that she respects my dad too much to hurt him like that.  He might not know but that's not the point, right?

-sighs-  It seems that most relationships these days aren't built to last.  I'm not sure love is what it used to be.  Especially in this in this day and age..."

"event","Well, these past few days have been hell on my nerves but I'm slowly trying to get my head on straight again.  After having my Mom laid out in bed for a week due to back problems, having to get my brother to his testing, and some nameless drama (that I still don't understand) with my boyfriend, I feel as if my heart has been strangled and possibly tread on.  Urggh, when will it end...?

In all honesty though, I'm doing better.  Thanks in part to this medication that is really helping out with my mood swings and sleeping pattern (I actually go to bed before 1AM now!), which I am extremely grateful for.

Now if only the documents that I had to mail for would get here already, I might be able to make some real headway with getting my affairs in order.

Until then, I think I'm going to lurk around the Internets and find me some yaoi ficcage to keep me happy."

<lj-cut text=""Sentence #4"">It was tragedy, a play of unfortunate events barrelling towards its inevitable end; Zack was clinging, clawing stubbornly at hope, looking for a good that was no longer there, that maybe was never there to begin with - Hojo, god damn Hojo and that thing, demon spawn of the universe - they had made sure of that, had maliciously taken what could have been and surgically, genetically altered it into something else, something that should not have been but was - god, why did it have to be this way - and even though that hope flickered and died, even as he firmly held his ground against his friend, his comrade, his General and superior, and everything that kept them together, he wished desperately, vainly, for Sephiroth to come to his senses, but knowing, painfully and furiously, that Sephiroth would not, could not, be reasoned with; it was a losing battle, a battle that Zack knew he would not survive but god, he would try.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Sentence #6"">The restoration of Hollow Bastion was nearing its completion, but the Heartless still presented a rather dangerous problem, and though their numbers had dwindled to almost nothing, every once in a while there came a sudden influx in Heartless activity, which often lead to wasted efforts as rebuilt buildings were destroyed once again in the fight to handle the issue - because of this, Leon had decided to take care of the Heartless beforehand, waking up long before the other's would even know that he was gone, he left, Gunblade in hand and more than ready to take care of any Shadow that came his way; Leon failed to notice a pair of vibrant blue eyes watching him from a window on the second floor - Cloud Strife allowed a tiny smile to flit across his face and merely shook his head, for reasons only known to himself; hefting the ever present Bastard Sword onto his back, Cloud made sure to stay quiet as he went after his stoic companion, just like he had done what felt like a thousand times before.</lj-cut>"

Mind you, this isn't even fanfiction in the sense of being anywhere near a completed work of writing.

<lj-cut text=""Sentence #1"">Cloud didn't ask for favors, he didn't ask for help of any kind, to do so would mean that he would have to rely on someone else, allow someone else to take care of him and that wasn't acceptable - Cloud Strife might have been weak - well, if he were to be completely honest, he was actually pathetically inept at taking care of himself, but he refused to feel nor recieve pity of any kind - however, when a certain black haired, cheerful goof of a SOLDIER banged into his barracks when all the other cadets had went to dinner and under no uncertain terms demanded to be told the truth, that he had watched from the corners of his eyes long enough and would not leave him alone until Cloud confessed his true feelings for one Silver General - Cloud knew that he would have to do everything short of dropping to his hands and knees and begging for his best and only friend to keep his love (maybe obsession would be a more apt description) a secret; not that it would do him any good of course, this was after all Zack and if Zack decided it was in the best interest of his two comrades in arms to get over themselves and get together, then there was nothing stopping him from playing Merry Matchmaker.</lj-cut>

Anger(wrath) definitely takes the cake for this one.  It does not take a lot for me to get angry and when I do, there's just no reasoning with me.

I think if I were to order the other ones, it would go more or less like this:

1.  Wrath
2.  Pride
3.  Sloth
4.  Avarice
5.  Envy
6.  Gluttony
7.  Lust

Hmm, never done this before but what the hell.  *shrugs*

No, I've never eaten out at a restaurant by myself.  I've thought about it and I find that it sounds kind of cozy.  I'm an independent person by nature so it doesn't bother me at all to be by myself for long periods of time.  Actually, it's pretty rare now for me to feel lonely.  That and when I go out to places on my own (i.e. to the library, park, shopping mall, and the like) I rather enjoy the feeling of going off on my own and not having to ask some other person what they want to do or whatever.  So yeah.  I haven't yet, but I probably will eventually.  *laughs*"

"event","I found this book just randomly browsing the shelves while waiting for my Mom to pick me up (it being dark out, I didn't want to walk back home....not without a can of mace on hand anyway) and it was seriously depressing for me.

The statistics are simply astonishing.  The average age that teenagers reach mental maturity in the past ten years is the age of 29.  In the 1940's that age was 19!  I mean, what happened?  How did we lose ten years of adult life?  Especially when you look farther back, somewhere in the 1800's, that age of mental maturity came at just 14!!

But the book also answers that question, looking into the cultural and social influences (primarily in the Western hemisphere) we see just how much the times have changed.  Parents simply are not parents anymore.  Children are no longer disciplined but more like put on very long and easily breakable leashes.  But what disturbs me more than anything else, is how I can SEE this when I go out and just watch people go about their daily lives.  When I see a 35 year old woman and a 15 year old girl walking side by side, and they're wearing the same tight low cut tank and acid washed hip hugger jeans.  There is something disturbing in the connotations of how the adult is NO DIFFERENT than the child.

It makes me cringe at my age of 19 almost 20 years, because now more than ever, I want to stand on my own two feet and be self-reliant and NOT go out and do stupid things just because it's not only expected but also ACCEPTED.

Seriously though, why does nobody think that this is a problem?  No matter who I bring this up with, they either shrug it off and say that that's just how it is, or they laugh and say it's nothing to worry about.

But when you see something like <a href=""http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2008/10/mom_accused_of_pushing_teen_to.html"">this</a>, I feel like the world has lost all sense and sanity."

"event","There is one assumption that most people tend to make when one is an adult.  It's an assumption that drives me absolutely insane because more often than not, it's simply too stupid and thoughtless to even have much merit in real life.

And that would be, because you are legally able to take care of yourself, you, as an adult, have your shit together.

Or if you don't, that you are below even pity if you should seek help in getting your shit together.

...Why do people think that?  Just why?  Now that I'm almost 20 years old, is it a mortal sin that I still live with my parents?  Because I stay at home, trying to do what I can, because I don't have a job?  That I'm something that deserves endless pity and sympathy, because I don't have friends that I can hang out with on a regular basis?

News Flash!

I can't move out of my parent's house because guess what?  I happen to live in one of the worst cities on the planet, and a one bedroom apartment will cost me upwards of 1300 a month.  The economy is crap so getting a job right now is harder than finding a piece of hay in a needle stack.  In fact, next week, there's a huge possibility that my Dad will be laid off.  And my friends?  Are all spread out across the damn nation and are otherwise busy trying to keep themselves from sinking.  I suppose I could go out and find some more friends, ones that don't have the aforementioned issues, but a social butterfly I am not and in all honesty, I have to remind myself to stay in contact with the friends I do have.

So if you are not someone who has gone through this or is not currently experiencing these problems, good for you.  You are, in my eyes, one of the lucky ones.  But I have to ask you to please not compare my life to yours, to maybe lay off the lectures about how I need to lead a more productive life.  Because I already know all about that, and I assure you that I'll live that life when I am able to or more to the point, these things don't happen overnight.

Not everyone is born into the same reality.  And whether or not you agree, I am my own person and I'll deal with things the way I think they need to be dealt with.

Thank you for your concern but please don't bring it up again.  I will not be held responsible for my actions if I lose my patience with your ignorance and rip you a new one.

FYI: This rant isn't aimed at any particular person, so if you are in any way offended by this, I will now say that was not my intention.  I'm just venting after having had this conversation with a good friend of mine and neither of us could agree with the other.  ~"

"event","I really should be working on something right now.  There's too much to do and not nearly enough time to get it done, but my energy level is somewhere around non-existent so I'm procrastinating.

However, now that I've established that I probably won't get anything done (for now anyway), I'm wondering if I even have the energy to waste on something entertaining.

Persona4 has been sitting in my PS2 for more than 2 weeks now and even though I love that game to death.....I have lost the drive to play it.  Which is a shame seeing as I'm 40 hours into and had just caught the so called 'killer' way ahead of the deadline.  .....Or maybe I just don't want to play Persona period since all my free time has been spent on Soul Calibur 4.

And mentioning that game....makes me want to rant and rave and possibly cry in frustration.

Now I realize that I've never been good at fighting games in general, especially ones that require you to have top notch reflexes and perfect timing.  Neither of which I have but I like SC and enjoy it enough to overlook my gamer shortcomings in order to have some quality bonding time with Raphael, Tira, and on occasion Amy.  Unfortunately my list of characters has grown very short, which brings me to the point of all this text and topic in general.

Why did they have to change the characters so damn much?  Every character feels as if they got a complete makeover; how they move, how they fight, the combos you can link, and which attacks have been eliminated completely......it just goes on and on and don't even get me started on the (somewhat random) difficulty level.

My primary complaint is how the close-range fighters, Talim being the primary example here, have become slower.  We're talking a difference of tenths of a second but believe me, for someone like Talim who has to be standing right next to the other to get a decent hit, it's more than enough.  Especially when you get used to being able to stun an opponent in a blink of an eye, only to realize now that same attack has a brief pause  before it hits, which the other player can take full advantage of.  ARGHHH!!!

All that aside, I know I'm whining but it took me so long to adjust myself to SC3 that it's beyond infuriating for me to know that I'll have to do that all over again with the 4th Soul Calibur now.

It makes me want to go back to the Gamecube version of SC2 because at the very least I know I'm still unbeatable as far as that goes."

"event","i know i said i wouldnt post anything in here anymore.. but.. i'm so bored right now that theres nothing better to do... thats pretty bad in my book. but, oh well.

I have stayed at nates since monday. me him chris tra and tony have been doing some hardcore gaming.. i had to show them what was up in halo. it was good fun. each night after some intense gaming we would all find our places to sleep and pop in a movie.. none of us would ever make it through the whole thing though. first night we watched a new hope, the 6th episode in the star wars saga.. second night we watched empire strikes back.. didn't make it through it though. and then the 3rd night we watched some weird movie about stamp collectors. it had a very humurous part in it where this asian kid was acting like a cave man or something. nate does a great impersonation of him.

new years eve we went to charlies and watch the bands.. but it turns out the only band playing was quarter orange... we still stayed. it wasnt bad. amanda was there, that was cool. but lyndsay was with her so i kinda stayed away from them most of the time. when i did talk to them lyndsay was being nice which is kinda sad seeing as how i've been really really mean to her. i usually don't say anything to her at all. i told her a while back that i really hated her guts and i hoped she died or something. she gave me zebra gum stuff.. and she got me a varukers pin for christmas o_O.. i thought that was weird. oh well. shes still creepy.


i've been listening to music a lot. 

i want to play a video game.i miss knights of the old republic.. adam better bring that back after break is over. 

i think i've been so tired lately cause i stopped drinking caffiene.. but i started again and now i'm never as tired as i used to be. oh well i have no more to talk about."

people always tell me, ""oh, dont worry! your get over her eventually!"".. sorry kids, but i dont think so. its been 3 years since i met this certain girl and my thoughts still havent left her. someone once said to me, ""your first love is always a killer..."" yeah. thats fitting.

well i'm afraid that i contradict myself.. im done dwelling on this. maybe i wont ever forget her.. but i dont plan on shutting myself out of the world any longer. this girl is infact far from my reach at this point it seems.. so i give up. i'm ready to move on...

"event","everything is boring. i'm slowly becoming a hermit or something. i dont even care about anything anymore. i just sit in my room most of the time, and i never want to do anything. my friends basically have to drag me out of the house now. 

i used to be crazy about music. now i just dont care.. well for the time being i dont. i still want to play guitar. but thats not going to happen until i get money for one. i'll most likely put on on layaway at music pantry. something in the range of like $200-$300.

i like to read now. i used to never read that much, but lately its like all i've been doing. i like those anne rice books.. you know? the vampire ones. my mom thinks im goth for reading them. shes asked me if im becoming goth like 4 times and 4 times i've told her no. whatever.

i wish it were spring time. i miss my bike. i miss those summer nights when i would ride for hours and hours. that always made me feel good. when summer comes again i think i'll quit my job. practice with the band i hope to have during the day, and ride during the night. next summer is going to be the best.

"event","i remember this time, when i was at a friends house and we were camping out, and well we were sitting there trying to come up with scary storys and he goes ""have you heard the story of fuck face!? i havent either!"" and you would have thought he was some super funny comedian if you walked up to us a few mins later, because we laughed about that for like an hour. i love stuff like that. like when you're having so much fun and little things like that make you laugh. its great.

anyway last saturday i went to bogarts and saw shai hulud(best band of the night), 18 visions, further seems forever, dillenger escape plan, and poison the well. it was a most excellent show.. the only show that i have ever been to that tops it is the subhumans show.. ask nate he knows what im talking about. 

had band practice tonight. we are doing well. we are getting a little better. we just have to organize our songs a little more. i've got a really good feeling about the band though. the only bad part is the name. chris and aron called wanted to call it apathy or red apathy.. somehting like that.. point is i think it sucks. but i dont want to seem too picky.

i talked to this kid named jordy today and he tells me that claire is crazy about me.. he said she has turned down several guys for me.. that makes me feel really special because shes so pretty and i just dont see what she sees in me. and im pretty sure me and her are going to go to homecoming with each other, even though i really hate dances.. i guess you have to make some sacrifices for the girls now and again. its no big deal im sure i can handle a few hours of torture. i did it a few times before. and things shant be all to bad seeing as how i will be with claire.

i love chocolate milk. i have been drinking a lot lately. like all i ever drink now it water and chocolate milk. and i have been eating lots of cereal. like captain crunch, the peanut better kind and coco-pebbles... man that stuff is the best.

there was this pretty cool girl who liked me and i had to tell her i wanted to just be friends.. i hate doing that.. haha but the funny thing is thats never really happened. maybe like once in the 6th grade. but yeah i feel bad. im sure she will get over it.. i mean its not like she was in love with me. we have barely talked!

anyway im going to try to write some lyrics for one of my many bands. so long friends."

Hey Jenny, what rhymes with ""canceled""?

So the Jenny Jones show has finally been canceled after 12 long seasons. I say: it's about damn time. I hesitate to use the word ""trashy"" to describe her show, because to call her show trashy would be an insult to truly trashy television. The Jenny Jones show is to television what Cheez Whiz is to food. I can't stress enough how shitty this show is. If trashy television was a video game, The Jenny Jones show would be the final boss. 

I made a decision about three years ago to stop watching her show entirely because it was pissing me off way too much. I watched it again the other day and nothing has changed. Every show can be summarized in one of the three following categories: 

1. Some lardass loses weight, and now she thinks she's ""THE BOMB."" So she comes out parading her fatass off to everyone in the skimpiest outfit she can find. Nevermind that every other Jenny Jones show focuses on people who ""dress too sexy"" (in which the audience boos and sneers when they display the before picture, which means that they're no better than the people they criticize), hypocrisy is kosher when it's an ex-fatass who wants her 15 minutes. News flash: nobody cares. What do they want, a reward? They bring the weight upon themselves, then they lose it and expect everyone to throw them a ticker-tape parade for losing what they gained. Way to piss away your 15 minutes you moron. That's another thing, the phrase ""everyone gets 15 minutes of fame"" is bullshit. Not everyone can get 15 minutes of fame. The earth's population is about 6 billion. At 15 minutes per person, that amounts to over 171,000 years we'd have to spend just sitting around watching people be ""famous."" To hell with that. 

As for the other two categories, I was just kidding: there are none. Every Jenny Jones show is like the one above, with various permutations of the following rhyming words: ""geek, chic, teen, obscene, hot, not, mom, bomb"" and many others. I've gone through the trouble of translating a few choice show topics to give you a brief synopsis of each: 


Your Teasing Was Cruel But Now My Looks Rule! 
Translation: I was an ugly skank in high school, and now that I've changed my appearance to conform to the media's perception of what's ""hot,"" I'm no longer an ugly skank. Now I'm a shallow skank! 

You Said I Had No Skills, But Now My Looks & Talent Pays The Bills! 
Translation: Raunchy hags and semi-hookers. Notice how they stealthily snuck the word ""talent"" into the title to make it seem like a legitimate topic. I have to admit, I totally didn't notice that they were glorifying prostitution since they used ""talent"" in the topic along with ""looks."" Otherwise I would have totally changed the channel if I found out it was a talk show about stupid slutty chicks who exploited their bodies to get on television. 

I Got Mad Player Skills Because My Big Chest Gives All The Men Thrills! 
Translation: I should be shot for using the phrase ""mad player skills."" 

You May Shake It For Money, But Leave Those Sexy Clothes At The Club, Honey! 
Translation: Another lame excuse to have another stupid show devoted to make overs. I have to admit though, the topic is pretty clever and sassy. Speaking of sassy, I thought of an alternative title for this episode: this talk show host has a lot of sass, too bad her head is up her ass! 

I'm America's Hottest Honey, You'll See, No Other Babe Is Finer Than Me! 
Translation: This one is my favorite because it's a broken sounding rhyme. They didn't even go for the obvious ""I'm America's hottest honey, nobody else is quite as money."" This episode answers the question that people are dying to find out once and for all: who is America's hottest honey? 
The show I watched the other day was about 11 and 12 year old kids who smoke, do drugs, and drink. It was so stupid I almost had a heart attack. They had some 11 year old girl on there who liked to dress sexy, then Jenny Jones being the impartial host that she is, asked the girl questions that everybody wanted to know: ""why are you doing it""? I guess Jenny forgot that it doesn't matter why 11 year olds do anything, because they're, get this, 11. The bovine-like mother just sat back nodding her head saying ""I can't control her! I've tried everything!"" Yeah? Well have you tried GROWING SOME BALLS AND STOMPING YOUR LITTLE SHIT INTO SUBMISSION, YOU DUMB BITCH? She's 11 years old. Do something about it. Holy shit people are stupid. Why is this on TV? 

Thank you Jenny Jones for your years of glorifying parents who have ""out of control teens"" and encouraging stupid kids with bad attitudes by putting them on television. So long Jenny, your show won't be missed."

got dressed. then my brother came home and made me download some country music for him. i hate that stuff... it still downloading now.  i went and saw that movie just married. its a good one. i like it. it was very funny. 
a few days ago my step dad got home from work and made me go outside and shovel the drive way. well before i went out i asked him if he knew where any gloves were. he told me i didnt need any so i went outside and did the job. i came back inside and got yelled at because i didnt take out the trash. then my hand started swelling up... i wasnt able to feel it and it was getting huge. i couldnt move it at all. so i went and told my mom, and my step dad overheard and came in the room and started yelling at me, since i didnt use gloves. wtf! he told me not to use any. 
shows you how much of an ass my step dad is...from now on i'll call him by his name(kevin). anyway. thats all i got."

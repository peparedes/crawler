"event","well i went to go play soccer with nora and brenna yesterday and we ended up doing 120s and scrimmaging with claire's team which i will admit was better than i would have guessed. it was tough work hangin with those 12 year olds haha. then we went back to nora's and made quesadillas and homemade peach-strawberry pie!! yummm. then i went back over there this morning to go running with nora and justine. OMGGGGGGGooodness we ran a whole heck of a lot b/c those training things that coach green gave us are not exactly simple... we musta run and sprinted uphill like over 4 miles. but it was actually kinda fun having company and all. hopefully our training regimen will work out even if it's just us three. well i gotta go now but i hope all is well and everyone is having a good summer!
xoxo

p.s. running always feels so good after u finish!!!!!!!!!"

"event","ok yeah so i promised that i would be updating a whole lot more now that it is summer... i guess i didnt really hold up to that promise. oh well no one reads this any way haha. so... whats been up? just got back from the pool abd well we FINALLY got a new computer so that the old one could go in my room. they new computer is like so SWEET im not allowed to touch it but it sucks b/c mine hasnt been hooked up to internet yet so i cant really talk to anyone on aim or anything. (haha my dad is in the shower so i snuck on the new computer). hmm... well i have vball camp next week and then i am going to disney WORLD!!! yayyy. we had the meeting thing for club soccer last night and i found out that there isnt going to even BE a silver team so it is a reallly good thing that i made gold. i feel so bad for the ppl that didnt though b/c they are really really good and now they might not be able to play at all. well i think i just heard the shower turn off so i betta go. love,

"event","well i only have a few minutes cuz i have to be back at school at four... to drive all the way to greensboro for states against who other than grimsley the #2 team in the state (YUSS!). my tay ray broke her foot and can't play... im gonna miss your kickbutt play out there girl (and i dont know how we're gonna do it w/o you but i must keep faith). today linnie asked the subsitute ""may i go pee, please"" and she got all pissed off at her for ""telling the class her personal business"".  Ill admit i found it rather funny though. gauri wrote a WHOLE page in my yb so im happy about that! im so glad that its finally friday.. these days are going by so slowly now that there are so few left. its sort of like a bittersweet kinda feeling tho, because as much as i am so ready for summer, i'm really going to miss freshman year and not being able to see everybody every single day (although some im sure i probably will anyway.. darn it you guys haha). well i better go get all suited up for the long drive to greensboro and the game of my life.. hopefully.. Love yo' all!

"event","well i just got back from hangin out with linnie last night.. we had a ball! (and literally balled watching romeo and juliet). today we had our ""spa day"" thing at origins. it wasn't like anything stupendous but it was FREE and we got pretty makeovers and stuff. Blair didnt handle the facial too well.. we're afraid she might have a black eye on monday haha. everybody looked really good though and it was fun (except me ick haha, i try).

i had club practice last night and regular for school and i was exhausted by the time i got to linnie's.. linnie was tired too so we tried to hint that we definitely were ready to conk out.. which we did. well my dad is calling me b/c he says that i havent spent enough time with the family this weekend haha... i better go b4 i get in trouble knowing me!

"event","ok well today was a pretty good day until we LOST to d.a. that really sucked.. it was 1-0 which always stinks plus we were soooo much better. all i can say is that we better beat riverside on wednesday or im gonna cry.

oh and apparently a whole bunch of ppl are convinced that i was crying for the entire second half of the school day which is completely odd b/c i was quite chipper as a matter of fact. yea a whole bunch of ppl had it on their away messages and stuff ""she's such a cry baby."" i dont think half of my best friends have even seen me cry let alone ppl i dont even know... that is SO WEIRD. w/e its not like i care i just find it odd that ppl i dont know are spreading shit about me that isn't true. OH WELL haha, maybe i have some stalkers.. or secret admirers.. who make stuff up? haha i have NOO idea.

BUTTT.. beyond that it was a great day. infact it was really cool seeing everybody after the long weekend  but not so hot to have more school work blah.. however.. i did do pretty hott on my math test today.. and i didnt techniquely fail my biology quiz...

luffers (haha linnie)

"event","well it was noice to have a long weekend though it sucks that i have to go to bed early since i have stupid DETENTION in the morning. oh well i feel that what i said was quite understandable... he was messing with me and it wasn't funny cuz i would have gotten my ass wooped at home (had he not called and gotten me in even more trouble). oh well i no longer effing care what mr. a-hole thinks.. if i ever did.

tomorrow is our big game against d.a. coach jones HATES private schools so we better win. as for school i have a huge math test which i definitely didn't study for and i am definitely going to regret it. however, i did do my english homework a day early instead of waiting until the last minute which is a first! 

i missed you this weekend linnie.. but that's okay cuz i see you lots anyway. me and rachel had soo much fun so it made up for it i guess. well 'night to everybody and i'll see you in the mornin'.

love, peace, and it's ALMOST SUMMER!

"event","ok well i feel much better now that i have had a mini vacation... feels good to be home too (i guess haha). every time i look in the mirror i have to take a second glance just to make sure it's me cuz i look like a different race from my skin color.. u'd think i've been living in the caribbean for a few months.

well now i am just hanging around for the day and hoping to maybe get out a do a little shoppizzling (yuss!)....oh yeah i got a new bikini that's really cute yesterday (well i'm excited about it though it might be a while b4 it's hot enough to show it off). sumbody call me today way before 5:00 cuz i have practice at five and i wanta see you linnster. love to all..

"event","okay... well long day friday. like the worst ever i must say. it was one of those days where everything goes wrong and it's just little things but it just SUCKED.. so im glad that's over and now i'm hangin' with my best buddy rachel and having a BANGIN time so all is good once again. we're at the beach yess! so happy to finally get out and pretend it's summer (and get a really good tan)! there were sum pretty good waves today and we were [attempting] to surf them but failing miserably to be honest. luckily some REALLY hot guys gave us a few pointers (on ""surfing"".. i promise with my fingers crossed). ahh what else to say.. just a pretty cool day i guess. well we are plotting our next escapade since it's still only like 1:30 so peace holla at you on monday (after my stupid detention with mr. a-hole)

"event","I haven't wrote in my lj for sometime it because i been to lazy. 
Someone close to me said the most hurting thing to me she said that i was lazy with no goals in my life and that hurts. 
Yea i admit that i am lazy but that doesn't mean that i have no goals in life. Just because you don't ask does not mean that i have no goals. My goals in life are become carpenter build a house for me and my kids and one for my mother and father cause i no how much they have work and they always seem to manage to keep this family together. 
Even tho i mess up with school i drop out and i regret it the most. I have a second shot so I'm in a ged program trying to get back on my feet. I also want to go to collage and major in business so i can open up one. 
where i can be my own boss and after a few project building houses i can make one for me and my family. That is my dream and i no it gonna happen cause i'm determined to grab it. Don't look down on me just because what you see i really have goals..."

"event","I'm made it to a point where things need to be question like is my heart in the right place with this girl or am I really hurting myself to make everyone happy I just don't no anymore, but one thing is for sure I no I still have myself, when everyone is busy in there own little world. I'm here for all of them. Each day a little more of me disappear until I'm am forgotten. Maybe god has a plan for us or it might be a sign that I shouldn't break myself for them. I'm not saying it all my friends they no who they are... I keep getting sad from conversation that end in minuteness for example I get a hi from a friend. I say hi as well two seconds later they sign off and there no where to be found what up with that you start a conversation and two-second later u leave without saying anything. It could be possible that they got disconnected and didn't want to sign back on, but this is happen constantly by the same person and other pplz are starting this habit as well. So don't judge me for saying this but pplz are sometimes asshole and I'm trying to reach out to these pplz but they seem to not care enough why would they in there new busy life's.

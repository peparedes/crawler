"event","I used to write posts that had substance, even if they were filled with complaints mostly. Insightful complaints.&nbsp; I used to use words like aberration when I described my day and quote Anne Sexton and argue the complexity of love and my existence with a character called &quot;Interviewer.&quot; 

I don't do that anymore. 

What happened? I blame wikipedia and text messaging. Ha ha."

Love is complicated. <br />  BLOUNT: Yes, Love is complicated. We are complicated. And I love you for all our complexity and all our interviews and all our words.<br />  INTERVIEWER: I'm sorry, Blount. I do not love you the same.<br /><br />[Neil Gaiman appears]<br /><br />NEIL GAIMAN: (to Blount) Have you ever been in love? Horrible isn't it? It makes you so vulnerable. It opens your chest and it opens up your heart and it means that someone can get inside you and mess you up. You build up all these defenses, you build up a whole suit of armor, so that nothing can hurt you, then one stupid person, no different from any other stupid person, wanders into your stupid life...You give them a piece of you. They didn't ask for it. They did something dumb one day, like kiss you or smile at you, and then your life isn't your own anymore. Love takes hostages. It gets inside you. It eats you out and leaves you crying in the darkness, so simple a phrase like 'maybe we should be just friends' turns into a glass splinter working its way into your heart. It hurts. Not just in the imagination. Not just in the mind. It's a soul-hurt, a real gets-inside-you-and-rips-you-apart pain. I hate love.<br /><br />[Charles Dickens, F. Scott Fitzgerald,&nbsp; Chuck Palahniuk, and Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. appear]<br />[Paul Simon appears with a guitar]<br /><br />KURT VONNEGUT, JR: (to Palahniuk) If somebody says, ""I love you,"" to me, I feel as though I had a pistol pointed at my head. What can anybody reply under such conditions but that which the pistol-holder requires? ""I love you, too.""<br />CHUCK PALAHNIUK: (to Vonnegut) Your heart is my pinata.<br /><br />CHARLES DICKENS: (to Fitzgerald) I wish you to know that you have been the last dream of my soul. <br />F. SCOTT FITZGERALD: (to Dickens) At any rate, let us love for a while, for a year or so, you and me. That's a form of divine drunkenness that we can all try.<br />PAUL SIMON: (singing, to All) Losing love is like a window in your heart. Everybody sees you're blown apart.<br /><br />[A choir enters]<br /><br />CHOIR: Godiam, fugace e rapido e il gaudio dell'amore. Godiam c'invita un fervido accento lusinghier.<br />BLOUNT: (singing) Let's enjoy pleasure, for the joys of love fade quickly. Let's enjoy pleasure, while its passion and temptation invite us.<br /><br />ALL: (except Interviewer) Let's enjoy pleasure, for the joys of love fade quickly. <br /><br />BLOUNT: (Through Neruda) In this part of the story I am the one who dies, the only one, and I will die of love because I love you,<br />because I love you, Love, in fire and blood.<br /><br /><br /><table width=""500"" cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" border=""0""><tbody><tr><td class=""line"">&nbsp;<br /></td><td class=""line"">.</td></tr><tr><td class=""line""><br /></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><br /></div><br /><font size=""4""></font>"

"event","<font size=""2"">I just got back from the Jazz Bakery, one of the more popular jazz clubs in Los Angeles, where I saw Arjang Rad's piano performance, ""Circle of Myth."" Arjang is a 'dude' from school, and while I only had one class with him, I heard he was a terrific pianist. At the time I thought he was just a pot-smokin' philoSOPHer who was too obsessed with Joseph Campbell and Carl Jung for my taste. Turns out, things haven't changed. ""Circle of Myth"" is a partitur, a full orchestral score in the same family as Pier Gynt (Grieg) or The Four Seasons (Vivaldi). It chronicles the archetypes of mythology, particularly the stages of the archetypal hero. Each movement of the music represents a stage in the hero's journey. Now you see Joseph Campbell working his way into this? And how do I know all of this? Well it was explained to us by Arjang for about a half an hour at the beginning of the performance. More on that part in a bit. Stay tuned.<br /><br />First, my comments on tonight's performance...<br />Overall I thought Arjang impeccably captured the tone of the heroic journey and the nuances of each stage in the process. The music had mystical, mythical, and epic elements, with many different shades and tones.&nbsp; He's clearly an impressive pianist, so the rumors were correct. Although he didn't finish the journey, he made his way through about 6 of the stages. My favorites were the descent (into the underworld) and the building of the weapon. Those seemed to have the most emotional effect on me. The rest of the movements seemed repetitive and at times overwhelming with chords and arpeggios. <br /><br />The main problem I had with the evening was all the philosophizing and waxing of all the grad school terms. After a few minutes of listening to his rants on heroes and western myths, I just wanted him to play the music and stop yammering. Offhand comments and watered-down explanations like, ""Now let me make a note about gender [chuckle],"" and ""On one hand this stage is symbolic of the hero's confrontation with the ego,"" and ""let me just pause for a moment and talk about the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice (which he pronounced Euri-dittey),"" became really tiresome and irritating. I felt bad for the parents and family who had to sit through all that yada yada they couldn't understand. I read The Hero with a Thousand Faces, so at least I had some notion of what he was talking about. It still sounded like haughty grad school crap to me. I paid 25 bucks for music, so I damn well expected music. And it was too bad he couldn't even finish the journey because ""the return"" from the underworld always has some of the darkest, coolest parts of the stories. The audience wanted to hear these stories in the music, but he wasn't letting us. This is why as a writer I can't stand talk-backs. In this case, it was a talk-during.<br /><br />Buuuuut...it was a nice evening because I got to meet up with oldies from my program and see a few professors and their kids. And I did hear some engaging piano from a talented musician. So. Shrug.

"event","A few hours ago I finished reading The Painted Veil (the novel) and then rented The Painted Veil (the movie). I have to say, the movie really creates a cheap fantasy of the book. The actors are fine, the directing is fine, but who wrote the screenplay? It's horrifying how much they cleaned up the book after over 80 years. So much for shameless movie moments. Books are more real than movies will ever be. I'm not stating this out of surprise, like I've made some sort of novel discovery. I'm saying this out of regret.

So where in this obnoxious contradiction does theatre lie?


EDIT: I realize now that perhaps the changes to the screenplay were on account of the way in which the Chinese were portrayed in the novel. Post-colonialism has been taken into account. Still, that doesn't necessarily explain the amendments to Kitty and Walter's relationship. Love conquers all in on the silver screen I guess...

EDIT: I found some comfort in the movie when I discovered that the title of the novel/film is based on a Shelley poem: Lift not the painted veil which those who live
Call Life. Perhaps the movie itself is a painted veil of sorts. And then I realized why I had bought the book in the first place. I found some connection in the basis of the story:

Lift not the painted veil which those who live
Call Life: though unreal shapes be pictured there,
And it but mimic all we would believe
With colours idly spread,--behind, lurk Fear
And Hope, twin Destinies; who ever weave
Their shadows, o'er the chasm, sightless and drear.
I knew one who had lifted it--he sought,
For his lost heart was tender, things to love,
But found them not, alas! nor was there aught
The world contains, the which he could approve.
Through the unheeding many he did move,
A splendour among shadows, a bright blot
Upon this gloomy scene, a Spirit that strove
For truth, and like the Preacher found it not

Then I thought and thought and wrote two edits, and found some solace and comfort in the story and the terrible character of Kitty. If I put myself in her place after Omaha, I would find this:

This dog and man at first were friends;
But when a pique began,
The dog, to gain some private ends,
Went mad and bit the man....
The man recovered of the bite,
The dog it was that died.

Many or all of you have no idea what I'm talking about, but I have found some clarity from this novel and I'm ready to recognize my own painted veil and accept it."

"event","Maybe I should be packing for our trip to Fresno (thrilling) or grading student portfolios (thrilling), but I'm  distracted. I'm getting very nervous for the Omaha conference. In Aaron's words, ""This is a conference where people with egos go."" I spent an hour or two searching through the conference website and reading people's bios. I started to think about Meron's headshot project, partially, and the idea of the playwright as a marketable commodity. The other part ruminations centered on my disgust at what people generally write in these playwright bios. I thought this one up for your amusement:

Ed Blount is an award-winning playwright from Penis, Arizona. She is a Whogivesacrap Fellow and a member of the Dramatist Guild (via the student free pass). Her recent play, ""Shits and Giggles,"" was presented briefly in her grandparents backyard before riots broke out. Following the riots, her grandparents refused to stage ""Shits and Giggles"" and Blount was forced to retire the play completely. Her other plays, ""Whores and Happiness,"" ""Green Elves,"" and ""Uncle Shakespeare's Vietnamese Girlfriend"" have been produced in Guam, Ho Chi Minh City, and a couple of parks in New York City. She recently won the 2007 Ichabod Firehouse Award for her acheivement in sentence structure and comma usage. 



Interviewer: You're jealous of others' acheivements.
Blount: Like hell I am.
Interviewer: You're sour. Jealousy is the green eyed monster--
Blount: Oh, give it up. I'm a Whogivesacrap Fellow and very proud of the work I've done at such a tender age.
Interviewer: Many luminaries before you were doing more interesting things at your age. 
Blount: I'm only human."

I'm sorry, world, the movie just wasn't my taste. I don't know if it was because I was disgusted by Babs' long red nails or because I had little interest in the two characters being together.

"event","(A long update of my goings on)

I've been very obsessive with my email--in a good way. I managed to bring 747 unread messages down to 500! I like to save messages as unread for a long time and then ignore them for months. I have unread messages from 2001 still sitting there. Weird to think that that was a pre-Aaron year. One email from a UCLA professor when I was taking a summer course, a couple of Chautauqua emails, and some very early letters from one Jason Mephisto. Nice touch, Jason, if you're reading. 

I love cleaning out my email. Feels great. Especially when I have an ear-splitting migraine and I'm trying to get through 24 packets of student papers. I leave for Omaha, Nebraska two weeks from Friday. I'm trying to make it to this Writer's Workshop, where I will be able to share my work with Arthur Kopit and Will Eno. It's a pretty big deal. I wish I could stay for the Romulus Linney workshop (Laura Linney's father). He's an incredible writer. I bought a book of his plays a few years ago in Alaska and he quickly became one of my favorites.
 Then June 1st is my play reading and I am already very nervous. The director sounded somewhat skeptical on the phone, but I've sent it to a couple of trustworthy friends and received some good feedback. Then I return home, do some editing for Wings, and then get cracking on my thesis project--I do mean project. Apparently it's going to be hell getting all the paperwork and approval for my research, but I'm very determined and excited about it. And they're going to let me do a reading series at CSUN all for my play!

Next comes another year at the Last Frontier Theatre Conference in Valdez, Alaska and I'm very excited because my sister is going to join me!!! My play reading is on Thursday and I'm also acting this year AND I might have a ten minute piece performed Saturday night. I can't wait to return to the beautiful 'last frontier.'

Two of my plays are now officially published with JAC Publishing & Promotions. Check it out! http://www.jacneed.com/JAC/Shorts/Glucksman_FrontRow.htm

Current books: The Painted Veil, Love in the Time of Cholera
Current Random Shakespeare quote: ""Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown"" (Henry IV, Part 2)

Things with Aaron are great. He's finishing up ""Evan Almighty"" with the lovely Lauren Graham and Steve Carrell and I'm still pushing for the Harry Potter 6 movie (we're running out of Harry Potters, darnit)! Look out for Golden Compass, which Rhythm and Hues is working on. Aaron's going to be lead compositor on Alvin & the Chipmunks. Yes!!

Besides the headache and random craziness, life is moving along fine. Who knows what dreams may come."

I'm the cool sister.<br /><br />Pops, my grandfather, is not doing well. He is in ICU at Cedars and we are beginning to deal with the idea that he may not live through the week. Although I don't think these things can be dealt with at any point. Not for my grandmother. Not for my father. Not for me. This has been a surreal and sad week and I don't really want to get into the details of how I am feeling right now. <br /><br />As a distraction I've decided to instead post about my feelings regarding the next Harry Potter book, based on some questions that were asked on a community post. <br /><br /><br /> Snape - Good, evil or neutral? <b>GOOD. Just because I trust Dumbledore. And how can Salman Rushdie possibly be wrong?</b><br /><b>Will Harry live or die? <b>Live. I'm optimistic because I think the book would be flat without Harry alive in the ending. </b><br />Who else in the series do you expect to live and die? <b>I think Snape will die, I hope Lestrange will die, I think Hagrid may die, and I hope Harry, Hermoine, and Ron live. </b><br />Thoughts on other horcruxes that are don't know for certain? <b>I like the ideas posted before based on the tarot cards. I think Ravenclaw's wand is one. I don't think Harry's scar is one, but I think there may be one very close to Harry that he did not know about.</b><br />Any thoughts on how Dumbledore in his portrait may still be able to help Harry in this final battle?&nbsp; <b>Not in his portrait because his portrait is in his office! But I believe he will help Harry in other forms.</b><br />There have been rumors that JKR may continue harry's life after hogwarts but it's doubtful? What do you think? Would you rather just see her write more of the Hogwarts school books like she did Fantastical Beasts and Where To Find Them and Quidditch Thru The Ages? If any one inparticular you'd like to see her write, which would it be? <b>I hope she doesn't write any more books relating to Harry Potter. I hope she sits on her money for a few years and then writes a couple more books about whatever she chooses.</b></b>"

"event","One month until I marry oh jolly jolly!
And tonight I went to a swanky Electronic Arts party in West Hollywood. Sooo swanky. And Mischa from Santa Cruz was there. And it was uber swanky. Example of swanktitude: Instead of ACTUAL fireplaces, they had fireplaces that were projected from a projector onto a giant white wall. Yeah, and the couches were white and the place was swaaaaanky. And we had special drinks that were named after Electronic Arts videogames (I had Aaron's game, Command and Conquer, twice). And across the street were the Guess and Smashbox Cosmetics parties with paparazzi and everything! Swanker than Hilary Swank!

ONE MONTH!!!!!!!!"

"event","Last night I went to a very cool party right on the Pacific Coast Highway. It was probably the coolest house I've been to in LA, and easily over 7 million. The owner is this Persian doctor, and the party was a birthday bash for Aaron's friend Michelle. Aaron and I came dressed as a nut and a bolt. HA HA HA. The house had this awesome swimming pool and go-go dancers and two dancefloors and smoke. And of course I got completely hammered over one Heineken. Still got it. Neato!"

"event","I was reading People Magazine today and to my disgust I read that James Franco may possibly be dating Lindsay Lohan. They were seen together twice, which means she's after him. I think he's still really down about my engagement to Aaron, so he's making a run for whatever slutrag he can find with a bank account. Sad, really. 

So I called him up:

ME: Hey, it's me.
JAMES: Hey. 
ME: So I know things have been rough between us. But I think we need to talk.
JAMES: I guess you read People, huh?
ME: People, US, STAR...You guys are everywhere. Why'd you have to do it?
JAMES: You can't possibly believe that trash. I'm in love with you. She's just...I don't know, a diversion.
ME: A diversion with VD. 
JAMES: Hey, that's not necessary. She's a great girl.
ME: Yeah? Does she read you Yeats poetry? Does she feed your mind with literary theory? Does she have an endless supply of pens to borrow?
JAMES: Yeah, that was so awesome when I borrowed your pen. 
ME: You're going to get bored really fast.
JAMES: You will too. Running off and getting married...Pff. 
ME: Look, you didn't have to hook up with that bitch just because you're jealous of my engagement. 
JAMES: You could have told me you were engaged when you let me borrow your pen!
ME: We've been over this, James. I got engaged the day after we met. And believe me, that night at Starbucks...
JAMES: Best night of my life...
ME: Mine too...
JAMES: Don't worry. Lindsay is nothing compared to you.

I think things are going to work out between us..."

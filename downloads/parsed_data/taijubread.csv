"event","<b><font size=""1"" color=""#cc99ff"">I was made of a lot of lose, and just a little win. Honestly, the 168 minutes I was sitting there, there were probably 30 minutes accumulated where I wasn't squirming anxious. It's definitely a ""wait til you have it downloaded"" movie, so you can pause a couple dozen times.<br /><br />It's full of fanservice, and points where it seems like they're trying to wrap up EVERYTHING from the last two movies, so you think, ""Oh good, this is just a trilogy, and Disney isn't going to butcher the classic theme park ride anymore."" But then at the ending (the real ending - there are quite a few false endings where you're ready to get up and leave, but then it keeps going.) you're just left going, ""well shit."" Cuz it's obvious there's going to be another.<br /><br />At least I had Val's humour to keep me going :3<br /><br />""I swear to god, I'm gonna stab everyone in here with a knife.""<br /><br />pretty much the whole movie.<br /><br />&lt;3</font></b>"

"event","<b><font size=""1"" color=""#cc99ff"">Hurray! Best midweek ever. Well maybe not the best, but it was great ^^<br /><br /><br /><br />So I didn't have to work Tuesday or Wednesday. Tuesday I met Val .. hm. At his school? Or maybe he skipped class? NO! No. ^^ I met him at school, and then we frolicked back to his house, and he skipped the class he was supposed to go back to. So we're chillin', watching Ren and Stimpy, and Kyle (my MANAGER from blockbuster) texts me, ""I need alcohol and company. Do you and Val care to join me?"" And I was like, ""O_O yeahyeahyeah!"" And Val's like, ""Welll.."" ""There'll be alcohol."" ""Let's go!""<br />So we bus down to blockbuster, and take a cab to Kyle's. Then we got MGD, he got his stuff, and we sat around chatting about crazy things (martial arts, etc.) and watching Doomed or something with boobs and sex and disembodied heads. Annnd then it was four in the morning - oh shi-. So me and Val just took a cab back to his house, and .. yes. Slept til like noon xDD So much for Wednesday class. And I remembered I had this church thing in the evening, so we cleaned the kitchen lightning quick and jogged most of the way to the park and ride (sucks in a heavy coat with a backpack, especially when you're fat and out of shape like me x.x; ). Then weeeee got subway, avoided this crazy guy calling me a racist on the bus, and got home. Annd.. let's see. Ate our food, went to the church thing, I talked a little, annnnd then Greg popped in and we're like, WOOO! So we all went to the Rabbit Hole, along with Brian.<br />Then we went to Beth's which is DELICIOUS. Oh my goodness. It's awesome. Hexxa ghetto, with crayon drawings all over the wall. It's awesome.<br />Let's see.. now I'm watching Eddie Izzard. I dunno. Not much is happening.<br />But Saturday will be great :3 I might meet Julian. I hope it's not rape thirty DDD:<br />Vali will protect me &gt;.&gt;;<br /><br /><br /><br />That's it, folks&lt;3</font></b>"

"event","<b><font size=""1"" color=""#cc99ff"">Oh man x.x; What was the last thing I wrote? I don't remember, and I'm too lazy to look back.<br /><br /><br /><br />So, basically, the highlight of the month thus far has been Saturday (cinco de drinko.) Went over to Val's, picked him up for a play muh old Homeschool Connections was putting on, then drove up to Everett with him and my sister. He was pretty unamused, to say the least ;_; I don't understand how he puts up with me.<br /><br />at least I go to see some old friends. that was cool.<br /><br /><br />Tim was at his house all day, so we could have been there getting our drink on (can I have FOUR beers?)<br /><br />but when we showed up afterwards, there was booze a-waitin'. So it was all good.<br /><br /><br /><br />Then we went and got Cheese downtown and brought him back to Val's place (along with his friend John.)<br />it was fun times.<br /><br /><br />Let's see.. I spent Saturday night at Val's house, then we went to church in the morning (Val really DID have four beers before church ._. Bad ideas ITT.) and a woman from my church complained the 'boy' I'd brought smelled like booze. Sigh. GG.<br /><br />Pastor wants to have coffee with me and Val on Saturday, to get to know him or something. But Val is going on an all guy's camping trip or something. Sigh.<br /><br /><br />We bussed back to my house, Tim already drank like three of the MGDs we had in the fridge. It was a pretty fun Sunday, overall.<br /><br />I think I spent Sunday there too? oO; Memory is getting worse everyday ;_;<br /><br /><br />I didn't have to work Monday either (three day weekend!!!) so, naturally, I hung out with Val. The Bechtels came to hang out with us in the evening, and we went to Alki. I had a crazy urge to go swimming, annnnd.. Val was not even a little amused. He was pretty pissed, actually. D: More bad ideas ITT. I suck.<br /><br />So I dunked in the freezing water in a tanktop and muh unmentionables O: annd then went to the restroom to change into my pants and sweatdshirt. Cold Tai was cooolld.<br /><br />Then when it came time to go home, I wanted to stay with Val, but Greg thought it was like, his duty or something to get me home. What is that? oO; I'm a grown girl, I can stay where I want. He freaked out, gave me my purse, and drove off. I haven't heard from him since.<br /><br />Then I bussed home yesterday, and went to work.<br /><br />And now I'm here, posting in my LJ, cuz I'm a cool kid ;O<br /><br /><br />and that's all.&lt;3</font></b>"

"event","K GOD!  If I could go back to last year I totally would, even if that means...I'd be an old man in grade 9, but honestly, I cannnot stand being separated from everybody.  I liked how we would all sit at the back of every room and be complete rebels off our asses.  I prefer it so much more to this bullshit that is grade 10, HONESTLY!  There isn't enough time during the day to converse with everybody and I mean it when I say I would have rather just repeated grade 9.  With the same everybody, because I liked what happened last year and I liked how Ashley and I started a little talk show during health, and how Ellen and I would sing in art class everytime that song by the Killers would come on and how Nicole had a disliking for our being rebels and Cody/Petey being high all the time.  Everybody in my classes are too cool to talk to me, and I would push them over randomly if I had enough of an urge too.  Because I do not like them.  At all.  They are all the same, and I don't like it.  The thing is though, I am actually too cool for them.  But on the other hand, I liked Ashley's shirt today, it had huge beads on it.  It was phat.  Also, I turn red, alot...more than often.  Its pretty cool.  I'm getting a guitar for christmas, though you might like to know that too.  I also filled up a kool-aid jug with water and proceded to drink it, to prove I can and my brother still has not returned my c.d.  claiming he hasn't stolen it, but borrowed it without my consent.  I'll fuck a nigga up.  I had cubasa?  for lunch and orange juice.  I had a sandwich for supper and I am listening to the Sex Pistols.  A kid got taped to a pole.  That is a fire hazard.


I am also suffering from chocolate milk withdrawl.  I want some.  I want some badddddddddd.

"event","K so, I'm pissed at myself beyond comprehension, and the stupid thing is I knew not to get off but I did anyway.  I went to Janessa's house on Saturday, she owns the 2 horses I'm working with, Copper and Daisy.  I tacked up the 2 girls and  when I mounted neither would move worth a goddamn.  I started off on Daisy, she wouldn't move or bit rein no matter how hard I pulled on her mouth...so what did I do, you won't believe this I got off.  What an idiot, 3 years of her sitting and I get off and *teach* her its okay to ignore what I want and be lazy.  I then get on Copper, and she won't move worth anything either, I did get her moving a bit after persistance, I got a 15 metre straight line and then a 15 metre trot back, and she's supposed to be this excellent cutting horse that neck reins at the drop of a pin, that was a lie, she too wouldn't even bit rein.  But I did some ground work with her and got her responding, so I guess thats okay, but why for the love of god did I get off Daisy and heres the kicker.  I won't see her for a week!  Chances are she's going to be 6 thousand times worse and I'll be lucky if she even lets me get on.  Good job, splendid work.  Ruining horses.

"event","So yesterday I went to Gimli with Brittany, we went to that Icelandic festival thinger, and I obtained a henna tattoo of a.......TURTLE! (Ill take a picture later)  and some fries which the taste resembled shiat.  We then went to the beach and it was cooolllddd, partly cloudly with overcast which means the same thing.  Her dad told us about some little fair thingy so we went on to that and we bought enough tickets for...2 RIDES!  Brittany screamed in my ear much, I had a super ass headache but it was all good.  We then went home and had perogies and cubasa?  which makes my day cause it was good.



PS; I slept over at her house and at 11 at night we went hula hooping around the block and I hit myself in the face with it and my lip started spewing blood."

Their cousins Christina and merna <i know i spelt that wrong...but they were there too and they are CRAZY!!! haha no just kidding. hm. so then we woke up this morning around 6:40 and took showers and stuff and got ready for the youth rally! about 1:15 minutes away from our church. well let me go back in time to the nite before. I didnt think i was going to get a ride to their house, but then my brother and his friend nate took me (very kind of them) even though they both got really mad at me because i got us lost...but thats a whole story in its self...so i wont go into that. ANYWAYS...fast forwarding, we were on the bus going to pualip (sp) and we just talked the whole way and had a good time. ONce we got there, we went to a church service WHICH WAS FOREVER!!!!! and my mind was all over the place! but then we ate a TON of food and went outside to play!!! (on the blow-up toys!!!) like, this volleyball/basketball game in a moon bounce (i won the first time) and then i really really wanted to play this game where you try to knock the other person off of the balance thing, but no one else wanted to. :( so then this guy name cody wanted to play too, so i challenged him, and sadly I went 1-3 BUT OH WELL the last time i KNOCKED HIM OFF REALLY GOOD! haha hm. then Rachel Roxanne and Christina and I walked around while watching the basketball game (haha ...JR!!!!) fun fun! and then we went to another service, went back to rachels house, and ate...DUH! well thats all for now!!! this probably seemed really boring to my readers, but trust me, it was a blast!

So i went to my next door neighbors (who i have never talked to) and asked if i could use the kids bike (he is a sevie and shy...) but they said yes. so lid got to ride the rhino! <that is what the bike was called and it was yellow!  thats all for now!

and then my sister made a rubberbandball and so i threw it into the fountain infront of the bon and she was like ""noooo"" (<you know slow motion and all) then i started to crack up i could hardly walk! i dont even know why i thought it was so funny cuz IT WASNT! 
after all of that excitment i went to em and lids house and em and i were kinda jokingly arguing...but then she went and took a shower so lid and i decided to sing! we were like HI HO HI HO ITS OFF TO WORK WE GO...DO DO DO DO DO DO DO DO DO DO HI HO...HI HO, HI HO HI HO! and believe me that was a BALL! and then amanda (their older sister) got a pay check so she took us to the mall to get some icecream and she also wanted to do some shopping. we went into american eagle and em tried on a hat and she said ""katie look i am a hat person arent i?"" and honest me said ""no em not really"" so then the joking arguing thing started again! and then i told them both my peking story and i said i was practicly crying and then em said yea one time i cried when i saw quiznos because i was so excited! and then we got in a argument seeing who cried more! a while later amanda said ""i got 3 shirts"" and em said ""no you got 5"" and then em made this LOUD GRUNTING NOISE LIKE A TRASH COMPACToR! oh man it was hilarious! eventually we got home and em tried to show me how she belly-danced and she had her sweat shirt on so she said ""hang on i am going to take off my shirt so it will give my dance a little more omph!""

"event","okay...this has been an awful day. and it all started last nite when i feel asleep on the couch after studying for S.S test...i feel asleep in my jeans, coat, shoes, no blanket, no pillow. yes it was a great nite...anyways and then this morning i was running late (because of the couch thing) and i went to school wearing no makeup so i did that there. okay...now in S.S we had a test and i FAILED! <well i dont know if i failed forsure but i think i did. and then i went to a soccer tryout today with em and i felt i did well but no i didnt make it. (i wasnt planning on playing for them anyways) but i would have been cool to say i made it. and to make that worse he was like you were the next person on our list. and he was serious. i would have much rather him said ""sorry you werent even close to making it"" that way i would be like ""oh if i had only done this...i would have made it"" and that is exactly what i am thinking right now. BUT AGAIN I WASNT GOING TO PLAY FOR THEM. ask em if u dont believe me. and by the way...CONGRATS TO EM FOR MAKING THE TEAM! o i just thought of another bad thing...at the volleyball game today, we won by like 100 and it was sooooooooooooo boring!

"event","oh man...tryouts were good call backs are later tonite. 
okay so here is what happened after the tryout and on the way home. We were in the car (mr malik em and i) when i realized i forgot my sweats. sooo we turned around and went back. i ran and got my stuff and then we took off again. BUT mr malik missed his turn so we had to go on the whole big route thing to get back to where we were. AND THEN (here is the best part) AND THEN we were making a turn and this car SLAMMED into the back of ems car. and the guy that crashed into us only had his car for one week and the car was steaming and stuff...well all in all i caused a car crash because i am forgetful. but it was kinda funny in a strange ""OOPS"" kinda way...
ttyl!

"event","Hola! Welcome to my new live journal. Thanks to emily for helping me make it. Im over at their house right now.

Well anyway, i went to the Eagles tryouts today with em, and on the way there we were discussing changing our appearance and style. Our first idea was formal. (NO.) then it changed into Goth. (NO WAY!) then skater/punk (but seeing as we are not skaters, we would be ridiculed as posers and no one wants that, so that options out.) i guess the only option we have is to be....well, us. If you have any suggestions of what our next style should be, let us know. We are always open to new ideas.

Anyway, right now im doing em's hair. it looks awesome, or so she thinks :) 

Well, we must go.

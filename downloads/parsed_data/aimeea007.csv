Well we should do it again.  It was always great on all those boring summer mornings when it's too hot to go outside.  Those days when if you try to walk to the pool sweat will form with in seconds and you can't go outside for 3 minutes with out your suit sticking to your bear skin.  Those times when nobody wants to leave the house, and your parents won't drive you around, and there is nothing on TV.  Those are the days when we all look at our calenders and go ""A whole more month to go""- and than go try on next years uniform.  These days I speak of are the days of LJ.  The days when all you do is surf the net, and get bored.  Everybody knows that eventually myspace gets boring.  This is our thing and we gotta continue.  But we need different names- different identities.  This summer we can all be someone different- someone new.  <br /><br />So add my new LJ- XxSlapshotzxX<br /><br />NOW YOU MAKE ONE!  It might actually be fun again!  <br /><br />:-P  later dudes- remember to update!<br /><br />~Aimee, Aim, Aims, Aimsterdoodles, Aimsy, Aimeea007 and now XxSlapshotzxX</font></strong>"

<P>Fuel injection and the 4 speed became available this year. The body is the same as the '56. <BR><BR><B>Interior:</B> This is the last year of the center dash mounted tachometer and gauges across the dash. <BR><BR><B>Driveline:</B> The engine size increased from the 265 to the 283. When RamJet fuel injection is introduced, the top engine is the 283-283hp FI engine which boasted one horsepower per cubic inch. The four speed is also available for the first time. Corvette is becoming a real sports car that had power to match its looks and the means to control it. </P>

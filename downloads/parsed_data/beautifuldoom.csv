"event","Splintered piece of glass falls in the seat, gets caught 
These broken windows, open locks, reminders of the youth we lost 
In trying so hard to look away from you 
we followed white lines to the sunset 
I crash my car everyday the same way"

"event","Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must have been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight

I keep looking for something I can't get
Broken hearts lie all around me
And I don't see an easy way to get out of this
Her diary it sits on the bedside table
The curtains are closed, the cats in the cradle
Who would've thought that a boy like me could come to this

Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away

Is there any just cause for feeling like this?
On the surface I'm a name on a list
I try to be discreet, but then blow it again
I've lost and found, it's my final mistake
She's loving by proxy, no give and all take
'cos I've been thrilled to fantasy one too many times

Oh I, I just died in your arms...

It was a long hot night
She made it easy, she made it feel right
But now it's over the moment has gone
I followed my hands not my head, I know I was wrong

Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight..."

"event","its always fun when you make up books. well at least it is to me. its not like i ever read anyways. god i hate to read, and i dont know why.i have always hated it. i think that maybe one of the reasons i dont spell as well as i should but that dose not make me any less smart...or dose it? well i think that i am so what smart i know i am not as smart as i should be but i think i get by. i wish that i could fix all the shit that is wrong with me...all of the things that annoyed the hell out of people. but i know that if people could fix all there things that people hate about them then the would be perfect and no one is perfect. i wonder what people think of me ...it dose matter but i would be very interesting to know. yes i know i am rambling on about the stupidest shit that dose not matter but i guess i just felt like say all that useless crap"

AquaDragon7: it's a feeling that comes and goes, one day you're happy, the next you're sad
beautifuldoom99:  ohoh
beautifuldoom99: wait i dont get it
AquaDragon7: joy is more constant, if you have joy it's more a state of being than an emotion, it's always there regardless of what you're going through, so you could be sad and still have joy"

"event","I, like a lot of rat-tail consumers, have stuff.  My very pretty boss has stuff too.  One of the things she has is a fish.  She calls it Lou.  I feed it as many times as I can (whenever I'm in her office), which is to say, I feed it a lot (since I'm in there a lot--she's so pretty!).  Yes.  But her fish tank is Hella Nasty.  Just ask JIMT, whose ass is looking bangin' today.  Did I say that right, JIMT?  Bangin'?  I don't understand Black Talk.  When JIMT starts gettin' all ebonic, I just say ""Fo' Shizzle, in the Drizzle.""  Hee hee.  And then the beatings start.  Just don't touch the hair!

Today I am sad.  My pretty boss is in a meeting all day, which means that when I visit her Hella Nasty fish tank, I do it alone.  Smokey IT is in the same meeting.  TEEM has left his axe in a coworker's chest cavity. (He's so forgetful... Go put your axe away, TEEM!  Clean up after yourself!  Come fetch your Diet Coke!)

Hey Pretty Boss:  CLEAN YOUR FISH TANK!!!  IT'S HELLA NASTY!!!

So, a lot of things have happened since last we talked.  But I got drunk last night so I can't remember any of it.  Back to square one.  Hello square!  You have such nice edges!

It's time to add some more characters to the LJ.  There's The Cannibal.  He wears a lot of Ben Sherman shirts which look all nice and cut on his ripped body, and he threatens 7s by telling her how much he enjoys the taste of human flesh.  I just think he needs a date.  Hey Cannibal!  Get a date!  Also, there is Blue Angel.  Blue Angel has been a coworker for not so long now, but it feels like forever.  Everything here feels like forever.  I call him Blue Angel because I sure wouldn't mind if he buzzed my tower!  Oh la la!  Too bad I don't play for that team.  I like my team.  We got some good hitters.  We're built to compete.

Blue Angel lives in Lake Forest Park.  Wheeeel, which is it, Blue Angel?  A lake, a forest, or a fucking park?!  Sheesh.  Blue Angel just got his hair cut and died.  Watch out Capitol Hill, you got a new Ice Man coming your way, to cool that Hot Gun!

I should get paid for this.  Do you see how versitile I am?

My boss [sigh] so pretty!

I hope she comes out of her meeting soon.  I don't know what to do?  I know!  I'll have a smokey treat!  Yum.  And I'll think about my pretty boss.  And JIMT's ass.  Then, I'll call it a day!  Another day another dollar.

"event","I, like a lot of self-obsessed rejects, have a Live Journal.  The fact that you already know this points to the fact that you are pretty, but don't get a big head about it, okay?  Geezus.  Anyway, mine is about my pretty boss.  She's so pretty and she just stopped by my desk demanding that I update my Live Journal.  She wants to read more about how pretty she is.  Who can blame her?  Hmm.  What can I say that shouldn't already be quite well known?  I.E. I have great hair...

Whoa!  My pretty boss just stopped by my desk again and told me that there's free pizza here!  It's a co-worker's birthday.  Happy Birthday, Co-worker!

[Chomp, chomp, chomp, etc.]

So.  A lot of things have happened since I last wrote.  But then I got very very drunk and forgot it all.  Now we're back to square one.  Hello square!  You are so very round.  Wait.

Okay.  To the updates!  Junk-In-My-Trunk has a great ass.  Yesterday she wore this very pink and revealing outfit.  She looked so beautiful she had to come to my desk to tell me.  I, of course, concurred.  Which is what I get paid to do.  T-E(-I)-E-M has brought an axe into work today.  He has also brought in Phil Collins' ""Face Value.""  The way he wields that axe is very disturbing.  I don't think I want to write any more about that!  There's someone else I want to talk about.  I'm going to call him Smokey IT.  He wore a very fine shirt the other day.  I hope everyone took careful notes.  As you could see from last week's activity, JIMT and 7s got into a fight.  They were both wearing scrumptious thong-y bikinis and the company filled an inflatable pool with some lime-flavored, vodka-infused jello for them to wrestle in.  Soon we were all drunk.  We're not sure who won.

Am I forgetting anything?  That is, anything of importance?

My boss [sigh] ... so pretty!"

"event","I, like other wusses, hate fights.  That's right folks.  Only hours after opening our doors to the adoring public, this our pretty little dictatorship of cutsie-pie proportions has witnessed a fight, which erupted in my comments section shortly after lunch.  Fortunately, my commenters only posted comments and did not actually tangle.  (Oh, damn you imagination, you muse, who tantalizes my imagination with a girl-fight between two adorable tigresses--wrrrrrar!  I'm a pacifist!  I'm not suppose to feel so excited about anger!  Oh conflict!  Oh well!)

My boss is still pretty, oh so. . ."

"event","I, like most bone-heads, have coworkers.  One of them has a real fine ass!  It's the finest ass I've ever seen and she knows it.  That makes her ass even better.  Sometimes she and I go eat lunch together.  When she eats a Snickers, she says, ""I just put more junk in my trunk!""  [She will henceforth be known as JIMT.]  That rhymes!  And it's witty!  Later, we get drunk and talk about our other coworkers--and my boss, who is so pretty!

OK.  I also have a confession to make.  I have a crush on JIMT!  But don't tell her husband because he will kick my butt!  I have another confession to make.  JIMT really has a crush on herself and is using MY LJ as a vehicle to promote the goodness of her own ass.  What an ass!  However, I will allow it because she is so pretty.  Like my boss!"

"event","I, like a lot of us shit-heads, work in an office.  The guy that sits next to me is named T__.  I like him okay, but he's not as pretty as my boss!  But who is?  Anyhoo, T__ likes to bug me when I'm busy.  Being as pretty as I am that's pretty understandable.  Hey, T__!  I bet you wish you had my hair!"

"event","I, like most people, have a boss.  But the distinguishing feature about my boss is that she is so pretty!  She can't stand it herself.  I can't blame her.  I'm pretty, too.  But she is so pretty!  Pretty bossy!  Ha ha ha ha!"

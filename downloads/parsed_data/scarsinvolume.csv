"event","Wow, this is insane. I looked back in my livejournal like i do periodically and i stumbled over my first entry I ever wrote back in December of 2002...

Yeah, so this is my first journal entry. I'm excited to start doing this whole journal thing.
Last night was pretty awesome, I again got the taste of what i want to do for a living. I saw Taking Back Sunday for the second time @ Jack Rabbits and they were fucking awesome...Whenever i go to a show i know that, that's what i have to do with my life and it only makes me more and more devoted to our band and makes me a better leader. I know its a risky business and that throwing away all my plans for school (senior year and college) isn't the smartest thing to do, but ill probably just fall back on my dad in the radio business. Which leads me to the point that I can't always fall back on people and maybe I'm too much of a dreamer and that one day i will hit rockbottom harder than ever and realize how harsh life really is. We'll see."

I'll probably be able to come back for about  a week and a half in a few days. That should freshen me up a bit. 

So we're scheduled for the Starting Line tour, then the warped tour including Canada (which is dope) but before that we'll be heading out with Underoath in March. Purtty crazy.

We got our pretty much brand new van and trailer previously owned by ""The Killers"" for a year and then given to ""The Bravery"". Cool beans.

The quality is phenominal. It's copmpletely worth the 16 hour days of work.

"event","The Tampa show couldn't have been more amazing...
We played at what was basically a House of Blues and makes Freebird look like a shit-hole.
The Venue was by far the best we've ever seen. 3 stories, 4 bars, HUGE floor and the stage was enormous.
When we got there, there were already about 100 kids in line way before the doors opened. They all knew who we were. It was amazing and the kids who didnt know who we were and all the words to the songs were beyond receptive. The drive there sucked, but the drive back was great. Tampa is officially our home away from home.
-Can't wait til Warped Tour. 

-I work at AE now

-So many good CD's are coming out this year...im stoked."

Julie: (after a moment of trying to get over the initial shock of the question) Mom, I think that by asking me that you are disrespecting my beliefs

Mom:  but it would really mean a lot to your dad and the people at the church would like to see you.  They're always asking about you

Julie: I don't like organized religion (note: this is my standard way of side-stepping the religion issue).  I'd prefer to be educated

Mom: You're getting too educated on the subject.  You're starting to get off the beaten path

Julie:  I don't want to be on the beaten path when it comes to religion.  It's an hour of my life I could be doing something else

Mom:  Well God gave you an entire life.  Did you ever think about that?

I have a 2nd round interview on Friday with a marketing firm in Livonia.  It's an international company, but I am not sure how interested I am in it.  They mentioned that if they hired me they would want me to start immediately after I graduate.  By immediately I mean December 20th....blah.  If I were to have this job offered to me I would require 40K, plus benefits, with the possibility of promotion in a year....the last two demands they could meet, the first one I am not so sure about.  Most companies are probably going to try to give me a shitty salary to start out with.  35 is pretty common for new grads with marketing degrees, but those that are more qualified are getting as much as 45 and I think I am one of those people that qualify for more cash.

We'll see what happens.  I really don't want to stay in Michigan for more than one more year."

"event","I think one of the most difficult things about traveling is eating well.  Since I have left France I have not been eating well.  It isn't really what I have been eating as it is what I haven't been eating.  Not only am I not eating enough, I am not eating that many fruits and vegeatables either.  I feel completely worn down and tired all of the time.

Monday I am going back to France and will stay in a hotel for a couple of nights before I pick up my luggage and return home on Friday.

My flight leaves Paris at 1:30pm-ish, arrives in NY at about 3:53pm (it is only a two hour flight across the ocean :), departs NY at about 5:30pm, and lands in Detroit at 8pm.  It seems like it would not take so long to get from NY to Detroit, but that is what my itinerary says.

Dominic (from the festival) is having a party on the 21st so I will probably go to that if I can manage to not have horrible jet lag.  My goal is to not sleep at all on the plane and go to sleep at a normal time at home.  It will mean that I have to stay awake for 24 hours, but I have done that before so it should not be a big deal.

If you haven't been able to tell, I am really ready to come home.  That isn't because I am not having fun.  There are just two many reasons I need to get back.  My sister's surgury will be on the 17th, I feel like shit all day, every day, and the combined weight of everything (my bag and the gifts I am carrying) I am carrying is at least 60 lbs.  A person isn't supposed to carry over 1/3 of their body weight and mine is about 2/5 of my weight."

"event","Tonight I went and saw J Majik at a bar in London.  It was really cool to see that many people really getting into the set.  I've never seen that many people dance to drum and bass (although I should note that it wasn't the best dancing I have ever seen).

In other news, I seem to be picking up accents as I go along.  The other day I noticed that I was speaking to my mom with a really bad Canadian accent.  We'll see if I pick up a British accent quickly.

As a random note: I find myself singing Mary Poppins songs in my head now that I am in London.  It is really odd.  I have always been a big fan of Mary Poppins, but singing them just because I am in London is a little odd.

Finally, I don't remember if I mentioned that I am traveling alone or not yet.  Jim left last Thursday.  Since then my trip has turned crazy.  I can't decide if it is a good thing or a bad thing that he was with me for so long.  Most likely I would have got myself into quite a bit of trouble had he not been here.  Maybe it's best that I only have a short while to party like it's 2999.

The line-up was made up of trance and very good techno.  Thankfully I managed to avoid all of the trance.

All in all it was a good festival.  There were many interesting things about it and when I am not so tired I will have to recall them.  It is amazing how tired one can be after they spent the whole day dancing and tripping.

"event","Last night I sat outside an Amsterdam hospital for 4 hours because I thought that I was going to pass out....not exactly what one wants to do while in Europe.

At about 11pm last night (Wednesday) I ate a VERY small piece of hash cake.  In the couple days I have been here I have ate a lot more than the size of the piece I ate on Wednesday night.  At about 11:30 I started to feel twitchy, then at about midnight I noticed I was having problems concentrating.  At 12:30 I was unable to say complete sentences and I had tunnel vision.  At about one my heart was racing and my skin was very cold.  As the next few minutes went on I started to have problems walking and was having problems breathing...at this point I went to the hospital.  On the way there I vomited several times (the taxi driver didn't like that).  When I got to the hospital they told me how expensive it was going to be to get treated.  Although my insurance would have reimbursed me when I returned to the states I don't think I would have enough money for the rest of my trip.  So instead of being treated I decided to wait in the waiting room for a few minutes and see if I got any better.  I ended up sitting there for at least 4 more hours.  Most of the that time I spent throwing up.

Not to be overdramatic, but there was a point last night when I seriously thought I was going to die...and then I started to wonder if I was already dead..........needless to say I was completely frightened.  I felt like I had snorted more K than I would ever do on purpose and was in a deeper hole than I have ever been before.

At this point I am still coming home on the 20th.  I am leaving Amsterdam on Monday and will be going to Brussels and then on to London, followed by Barcelona and then finally home.

On a more positive note, I got a new tattoo.  This one is on my foot.

P.S. the 20th is 15 days away."

Tomorrow morning at 8:30am I will be boarding a train for Amsterdam :)

After debating with myself for a couple weeks I think I have decided to come home a few days early.  My mom told me yesterday that my sister is having seizures now and is bleeding through her nose.  The doctors said that what she has is likely to cause a stroke.

I have 4 cities left and I am not sure if I am going to cut out London, Madrid, and Barcelona, or if I am just going to cut out Madrid and Barcelona.  Tomorrow my sister will be having another test.  The results of it and the day they set the surgery will probably influence my decision as to when to come home.

In other news, I have purchased more gifts for other people than I have purchased things for myself.  The total on things I have purcased for to take home for myself is about 75 dollars, the total on all of the gifts is about 500 and expect it to rise.  My bank account is little more dry than I would like at this point.

"event","I have posted a few updates of my trip on my mac site, but in all of them I have refrained from saying what I really think of the trip or what I have been up to at night.

At first I was really annoyed by a lot of people on the trip.  Many of them behaved with very little maturity and were quite abnoxious and disrespective of French culture.  After three weeks have passed I am learning to live with them a little better.  People seem to have grown a little tired of each other and therefore are not acting the way they were.

I have drank a whole lot of wine while I have been on this trip.  I am still amazed at how cheap wine is in France.  Unfortunately, I haven't really gone out to clubs because when I attempted to I ended up skipping class the next morning and it is not something I want to be doing.  This week I plan on going out on both Thursday and Friday to Club Rex in Paris.  Matthew Herbert is playing on Thursday and Micheal Meyer of Kompakt is playing on Friday.  I am hoping I can get someone to go with me, but if not I am sure I will survive.  There are a couple people on this trip that used to party so I am going to attempt to get them to go - although one of them is kind of the trashy, cracked-out type that is impossible to rely on so I might not ask her.

Right now I am sitting in the library of the International Telecommunications Union.  Today we are listening to speakers from the ITU.  The three people we have listened to so far have been pretty interesting.  These speaches are taking place in a room that delegates meet in to discuss policy.  The coolest things about the room is that we each have microphones at our desk in case we need to ask a question or comment on something.

I am bored and think I am going to walk around Geneva until class starts again at 2."

"event","19 credits + festival work + resident mentor + organizing trip to Europe = severe lack of sleep.

My schedule for the next few months: school until May 7th, working on the festival until I leave for Europe,leave for Europe on the 13th of June, return from Europe on August 20th, start my final semester of my undergrad career on August 30th, graduate the second week of December, then..........maybe I will have a couple days to sleep after that or maybe I will have a job somewhere and have to move.

I can't wait for Sonar, it's going to be the first time in three years I will actually be able to enjoy a big, crazy festival, and..........MASSIVE ATTACK IS PLAYING!"

"event","A week ago I had no plans to go anywhere for spring break, nor did I even want to go anywhere...it's amazing how things can change in a week.  On Monday I had a meeting with the festival director.  I had to give him a proposal for potential merchandise fundraisers for the festival and a detailed strategic plan.  I mentioned that there was a chance I could be in Miami for the Winter Music Conference to sell stuff if he would take care of setting up our booth.  Instead, Derrick O said if I went to Miami he would pay me to do some work for the festival.  Now I have to get all the products ready to go and get myself ready to go to the WMC and then vacation in Orlando for a few days after the conference.  Before the conference I am going to go to a huge festival (it is essentially a phaty rave, but I'm in denial) that the Chemical Brothers are headlining.  The festival has one of the best drum and bass line-ups I have ever seen, plus a couple of other djs and performers I want to see (and a whole bunch of trance djs that I am ignoring).

Yesterday I found out I was accepted to go on a study abroad program that goes to France, Switzerland, and Belguim for a month over the summer.  I will be living in downtown Paris for two weeks and after the program is over I plan on going to Amsterdam, Rome, Germany, Spain, and the UK.

In summary........I am pretty fucking excited!"

"event","This year's staff (residence life) kind of sucks, and by kind of I mean it does.  For some reason it is full of a bunch of fakes.  They say they encourage accepting other people and what not, but they can't even open their eyes to their own actions.  When I think about it for a while though, it isn't the whole staff that sucks it is just one girl - whom everyone thinks is a bitch.  Also, there are a couple of very needy people on the staff, but they are tolerable to a point.  This bithcy girl on the other hand will soon be getting a house call from me though.  She is in my group (I have one group that I operate) and many people on the staff have complained about her approach to just about everything.  That is all I have to say about that.

As for the weekend......Friday/Saturday was fun and exhausting.  Richie was fun.  I ended up drinking too much and for some reason decided it was a good idea to talk to Chad.  I don't remember the conversation - in fact I can barely confirm that it actually happened - assuming it did however, I have no idea what was said or who initiated it.  That was the only bad part of the night and it wasn't that bad.  If I could remember what was said it might make things worse, but I don't care that much.  I was surprised how quickly the night went, normally I feel like the minutes are passing by very slowly.

For some reason I ended up driving back to EL on Saturday morning and went to the UofM v. MSU game.  It was cool, but would have been a lot better if I had not been so tired.

Eventually I went to sleep at 2am.  The weekend was fun, but now I must return to the wonderful world of text books!"

"event","I do believe that I am once again in contention for the procrastinator of the year award.  Yay!

Things have been going alright lately.  After a month I have to say that I am sooooooo happy Chad and I are no longer together.  I have been in such a better mood dispite how busy I have been.  He has made me realize so much of what I do not want in a person or relationship.  It's too bad that in a way I wasted 9 months of my life finding that out.

School is going alright, surprisingly.  I thought that having 19 credits would kill me.  It has stifled parts of my social life, but I am still finding time to do things that I want.  Plus, I am getting a 4.0 in 5 out of the 6 classes and hopefully can pull up that 6th class.  It would make me so happy to 4.0 an entire semester in which I took 19 credits.

Last week I started physical therapy for my back.  I really, really, really hope that this will cause most of my pain to subside.  My muscles have been spasming a lot lately causing my back to be more fucked up than normal.

This weekend I drank a lot of beer (you'd be proud Beth) and I only paid for half of it.  On Friday I went out with a couple friends to see Lost in Translation (which is good enough to see in the theater) and then after went to BW's in East Lansing.  Afterwards I met up with some other people and went to a couple other bars.

I hung out with Tom this weekend (guy I met at the Paxahau party).  He seems cool, but I'm not sure what I want right now.  I think it's best to just relax and see what happns.  Like I said, what I know of him so far is good, but I'm not going to get all crazy.  One never knows what will happen.

DJ Rap is going to be in Lansing this weekend.  If anyone is coming up let me know if you want to stay here.  However, it should be noted that one does not need a dj to be in town as an excuse to come and visit me at State.  I strongly encourage company."

On a brighter note.....I went to Cedar Point on Saturday with Mike Pasky and a couple of his friends.  I had a really good time, but it also kind of sucked that everyone seems to go to Cedar Point with their significant other and that is all I kept seeing the whole day."

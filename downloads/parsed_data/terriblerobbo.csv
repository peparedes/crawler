Well, the M&Ms method didn't work. I went nowhere <i>really quickly</i>, spinning my wheels until I ended up burning out at 9am. Gah.

This time around I've tried an initial sugar hit to get me over the 1-2am hump, and then gone the rest of the distance with apple & guava juice, and a tealight-sized sandalwood candle burning on a little piece of wood on my desk for the scent, and for something to look at when zoning out.

This is of course having no real effect, but if I think it is, then it's served its purpose. XD I'm still awake and making progress at any rate.


Oh, and after a number of bad experiences this week I'm pretty sure I'm lactose intolerant. Yhey. :|


(<b>Edit:</b> Linkin Park and ""tradition"" - back in the <a href=""http://insanitymanga.net"">InsanityManga</a> days, Aya and I would put on a bunch of their tracks on random while she drew manga and I coded the website.

"event","Oh boy, it's been a bit of a shit end to the week. (Late-night party interlude notwithstanding.)

I'd gotten a place lined up with Matt / Marauder and his girl Louise, great place, within my budget, etc, and I was going to go start the settling-in process on Saturday morning. Friday night rolls around, and I get an SMS from Matt at half past twelve telling me that the deal is off, and that I'm not able to move in with him anymore. Fucking hell, thanks for the warning.

From then on, my life has (again) turned into a frantic search for a places to live in. I swear there's a total of about 15 places in the entirety of the city (ie. not Parramatta or Emu Plains) that are actually available for rent; it feels like I'm going to end up moving into the ""<a href=""http://www.myhome.com.au/rent/nsw/sydney-inner-west/annandale/apartment/p0005qz9/#/"">MEAT MEAT MEAT</a>"" place at this rate. Most people I've tried ringing aren't picking up the phone, and don't even seem to have answering machines.

Looking for a place to stay is like a fucking full-time job. I see notices posted up on the telegraph poles dotted around the area, take a number, and come back in ten minutes to find someone's already come along and swiped the rest of the them. People I call up and actually manage to get through to quote figures far in excess of what's written on the posters, and offer ""So sorry you have wrong number *Click*"" by way of response when I call them out on it. ARGH. Farking charge-as-much-as-the-market-can-tolerate shtick. 

Staying at my own place really isn't an option; come March 14th the lease is going to be ""renegotiated"" (ie. the poor bastards who are moving in are going to pay an even higher rent than what we're paying at the moment, for what's pretty much a falling-down shack of a place). My fallback plan is staying at my parent's place in Warriewood (in the Northern Beaches, way north of the bridge), but moving back there means I'm going to lose whatever tenuous edge I have at the moment of being in the city and inner suburbs all the time (that is, being around to spot more notices, and being able to get to a potential place as soon as it is advertised), making finding a place even more difficult. Gah.


Anyway, leaving day is fast approaching at 12 days and counting. Oh fucking fuck fuck. Fuck fuck fuck. (Fuck.)

<b>Edit:</b> AAAAARGH. A new posting on realestate.com.au goes up, and in the space of half an hour they've already got a full queue of people waiting to see the place.
People must be doing nothing but farking camping the damn real estate sites. How the hell are people with jobs or uni supposed to find a damn place to live? D: D:

I don't particularly feel like hanging around either, the bathroom and kitchen are utter crap, everything still leaks like a sieve, the place is gradually falling apart, and I'm terminally embarrassed to invite anyone over. :\

Anyway, that means I'm on the look-out for sharehouses and such vaguely near the city. Time to hit realestate.com.au and housemates.com.au (and the streets for those little adverts). <b>Edit:</b> And gumtree.com.au - thanks Jez.

After eighteen and a half years, the Rocky Horror Picture Show is finally leaving George St, and to celebrate, we're throwing one last awesome blow-out show. :D

The show's a loud, raucous, late-night dance-, sing- and shout-a-long, performed a by a comically amateuristic and out of tune seasoned cast of hundreds tens, including a whole bunch of old cast members in the audience jeering and shouting along when we forget our lines. Come along, it'll be fun. XD

Anyway, the details:

<b>Where:</b> George St Cinema Complex, Sydney.
<b>When:</b> Midnight, Friday Feb 1st. Doors open <s>11:15pm</s> 11pm and the pre-show fun begins!

We urge anyone who has ever come along and enjoyed the show over the years to come along and join the party! And if you've never experienced the show, this is the perfect chance to come along and check out what everyone's been raving on about all these years. :D

Hope to see you there."

  - The bacon I was going to use had gone missing.

"event","Can Cabbage shape most of a 1.5m wooden cosplay sword in 4 hours, using only a handsaw and two pieces of sandpaper? Can he get it painted and decorated before he has to drive to Animania?

Don't know? Neither does he!

Stay tuned for the exciting conclusion of... <b>The Night of the Insomniac Prop-Builder!</b>


... <b>Edit</b>: Exciting update!

I got it done. Sort of. It's missing two coats of paint, and a sword basket, a gem, wire detailing, and any sort of finesse.

I'm reeeeeally happy with the blade; it's shaped just right, all nice and tapering and smooth, has bevelled edges, etc.
I'm willing to go on record right now and say that I want to have babies with the person that invented the (hand-powered) wood plane. I want one for my birthday, just so I can put it up on a pedestal and bask in its cosplay-blade-making awesomeness.


... Every other part of the prop sucks, however. It sucks so badly, that I refuse to post a picture of it.

If it's in any of my Animania photos, it'll get pixelated out.

If it's in anyone else's Animania photos, their cameras might accidentally go missing.

*Scene: Bathroom, a sword standing in front of a mirror.*
Hello, this is Sword. We can't show you his face, BECAUSE HE'S A FUGLY COSPLAY PROP CABBAGE WHIPPED UP IN LESS THAN FIVE HOURS.


...

... *Phew* Ok, that felt better.

Goodnight."

Well, it's all over (for the moment): following the double-all-nighter, I handed the completed Project Management assignment in, and managed to do reasonably at the Japanese conversational speaking assessment on an hour's sleep. :-\

... My brain is currently mush, though.


In any case, now that's done with, it means convention time! >:-D

I just hope I can fit sewing, prop-finding, prop-making, badge-designing, sign-printing and sword-swinging in this weekend. -_-;

"event","New things I've learnt about All-nighters:

<ul>
<li>Like denial, an All-nighter is comprised of stages:
    - 12am (Massive Productivity): Working, working...
    - 1am (Fatigue): ... Ok, getting tired now. *Yawns, rubs eyes* Just a few more sections...
    - 2am (Hyperactivity): Energetic! I want to run up walls and jump and other things... But I can't concentrate worth a damn on this section I'm working on.
    - 3am (Hypoactivity): Erg... I need more caffiene. Still working on the same damn section...
    - 4am (Massive Unproductivity): Can barely... form... English sentences. Stuff it, I'll get this section finished, then call it a night.
    - 5am (Anger / Depression): Fuck it, I'll just scrawl a couple of sentences to get this section done... There. That's it. Fuck this, I'm going to sleep.
</li>
<li>The To-Do list you wrote at 6pm ain't getting done, no matter how good you think you are.</li>
<li>7-11 Hot Chocolate isn't that bad, really. Good with a doughnut (enough bready stuff to keep you filled).</li>
<li>The 5am-6am bus home really, really sucks. Must remember to bring uniform next time, sleep in ProgSoc room, instead of a 3-hour round-trip from uni to home to uni to work. :-(</li>
<li>As an addendum to the previous point... I really can't wait to move out. Pulling these sort of stunts is so much easier if you live three minutes away from uni.</li>
</ul>

Erg. That's it from me. Off to a Japanese speaking assessment now. :\

"event","Hello again,

I'm currently trapped at Uni, at the tail end of a all-weekend get-the-fucking-assignment-done-it's-due-on-Wednesday session along with another chap in my group. I'm seriously starting to doubt whether we'll get this thing done on time. His Holiness on a flippin' cracker. :-\

Meh.

Also on the Oh-shit-get-it-done-right-now front, Manifest is coming up, and we're not prepared. I've got to churn out a bunch of pictures to put on badges, get said badges made, make signs, print out receipts, and, err... Do the entire cosplay costume. Damn. Forgot about that one.

Aya's on the patterning, but she's had so much to do recently that I fear it's going to turn into a last-minute operation like last year, or the year before. I can't do that this year. Uni and work commitments mean that I can't do that this year. I might have to go in a half-done costume, or take a couple phukitol and show up without one at all. Which would suck.

Oh well. The absolute bare minimum I need to get done to pull off the costume:
- Black Hakama (big flary pants/skirt thingy).
- Black Gi (do-up-at-the-front shirt/jacket. Think what Karate people wear).
- White belt made of thin material (cotton, probably).
- White Haori with a big 5 on the back (Big loose white over-jacket).

Let's see if I can get that done. :(
(And the sword. And the under-kimono.)

... And the big omg-sworn-to-secrecy-not-sure-why prop I have to make for Aya before Animania. Hrm.


Umm. Anyway, see you on the other side.

I've officially dubbed this week the Week of Hell.

It also means I have to do my database assignment during lunchbreak at work. *Whinge/Bitch/Moan*

Not much to report recently, with the exception that the beloved Cabbage laptop has finally more-or-less packed up completely. It only powers on occasionally, and when it does, it complains about missing keyboards, or freezes intermittently (every second-or-so kind of intermittently). Mourn it's passing, and hope I can scrape together enough cash to get a new one. Bread and water for the next six months for me, I think. :P

On the coding end, the Import script is mostly done-ish (where have I heard before), and I'm finally slinking back to Drupal to give it another go. :S Hopefully if I learn it thoroughly enough I might be able to get something useful done with it this time. I realise I just don't have the time to build something from the ground up, so Drupal is my next-best bet. If only I could run <a href=""http://matrix.squiz.net"">Matrix</a> on the hosting service. :S

Long time, no update, etc. Anyway, in brief summary:

Christmas was... Overly Christmas-y. New Year's Eve was spent at a LAN party at Wilbus' place (along with Jeremy, Joel, Johno, Russ, Celine, Andrew), followed by an overly-expensive and greasy egg/bacon breakfast by the beach. I spent the evening at Em's place after a long drive to Liverpool with her & Kai. We watched anime and I banged out more Gallery Import code. (This was all terribly exciting, can't you tell?)

I've just spent the last week of my holidays cleaning the damn house. I must <b>never</b> take leave in the same week my parents do. -_-; At least I have some of tonight free, and hopefully most of tommorow, before getting back to it.

<a href=""http://insanitymanga.net"">Virus</a> is late again unfortunately, thanks to that danged YaoiPress stuff Aya has to do. Poor chook, hopefully she'll get some time off soon. :S

Gah. I've spent the last two weeks looking at all the PHP frameworks I could lay my hands on, and I've been fairly disgusted by the entire experience. I never knew so many people could put so many hours into code that's structured and written so badly. :S

In any case, I managed to use the hacked-up templating system to create the new Interviews section for <a href=""http://insanitymanga.net"">InsanityManga.net</a>. No more SQL mixed with the HTML, yay! (Yeesh, it only took me six months to get around to doing it.)

Next on the cards are the dropdown menus for the top navigation bar - we have so much content that the current system (eight buttons, with four sections hidden behind each one) is getting unwieldy. This is going to be an absolute <b>bastard</b> to pull off (and keep it useable by people with javascript turned off, or people with screen-readers or text browsers).

Oh, and, umm, there's a new manga in the pipeline that I'm rather excited about. I can't say much beyond that it involves Scottish people.

Tommorow will probably consist of voting (pointless, our electorate is a guaranteed Liberal seat), followed by an afternoon out with Em and Kai getting stuff ready for our random cosplay for the Anime Christmas Cruise. :D

Fortunately, I'm mostly over random throat sicknesses. I'm going to be fired at this rate if I don't stop taking sick days.

I found out this evening that my brother, after only a couple of games, can Sk00l me rather soundly at <a href=""http://www.soldat.prv.pl/"">Soldat</a>. I must practice to avoid this happening at the next EGG LAN. :P

After waking from my nap on the bus home, I found myself wondering whether I should stop at the service station and pick up some transaction queries on my way back. Honestly. (I spent the next five minutes alternating between shock, and wondering precisely what they would look like... Maybe some neat little rows of BEGINs or ROLLBACKs hanging from some hooks or something, next to the bags of lollies.)

In any case, work has been busy, this week I'm rewriting a component that had problems when more than one person used it at the same time. My boss, a co-worker and I sat around for three hours on Friday planning this thing, to make sure it won't break this time around.

As far as Insanity-related things go, I'm <b>still</b> working on that damn gallery import script (it's looking more and more like spaghetti code the more I write). The new system hasn't really had any new code added, just a stack of developer notes (I'd put them up on the site, but our visitors (the ones that post, anyway) appear to be more the type that restrict themselves to dumping pre-made apps (say, a tagboard) on their websites, rather than touch anything vaguely related to code, so I'm not sure it's such a good idea).

Parents are away this week on a camping holiday, and Andrew's gone walkabout, so I've got the house to myself for the moment. Cooking and cleaning and washing, oh my!

Meh. I'm in the limbo state between being healthy and sick, it's about to storm outside, it's 10pm, and I haven't made dinner yet. *Grmphrgamnble*

<a href=""http://insanitymanga.net/forums"">InsanityManga.net's Forums</a> membership has just been halved, thanks to <a href=""http://www.phpbbhacks.com/download/1692"">this</a> handy Admin Panel mod for phpBB. So many damn f*ckin' spammer accounts (""got PH3NTERMIINE?!!!1"").

Le sigh.

Anyway, in more productive (and less make-work) news, I've finally committed a working version of the new site following a code run that lasted until 5am. O_O;

Note to self, never do this again (this had me stuck for half an hour at least - put two of these in a row, and it prints out an infinite loop of '0's):
<pre>foreach ($content['main'] as $title => $content) {
    echo $title; // print stuff out
}</pre>
Redeclaring the array you're looping through isn't smart. This also proves that foreach() doesn't get the array by reference. -_-;

In any case, time to get on with filling out that damn driver's logbook so I can pass my P's Test. And reports. And uploading photos. And catching up on STF posting. And cleaning the house. (Gah!)

Courtesy of Nathan, the <a href=""http://progsoc.org"">ProgSoc</a> CSO, I've been introduced to a neat little thing called ""<a href=""http://www.tiddlywiki.com/"">TiddlyWiki</a>"".

<lj-cut text=""TiddlyWiki Nerdgasm..."">
In short, it's a Wiki / notebook... In a single HTML file. <b>Everything</b> is done in this single file, no external files or databases to store data, the javascript just stores the content inside the HTML file.

... The upshot is, you have this portable notebook thing you can just put on a USB key or something, and just carry it around where you need to. Useful for taking notes in lectures, and then reading them later on whatever computer you have access to - all you need is a browser (Firefox works better than IE, but you can use either).

Unfortunately, you can't modify the file when it's up on the web somewhere, only when you have it saved to a disk. But I still think it's awesome. :D
</lj-cut>

... H'okay. Other things to add to the nerdy to-do list:
<ul>
<li>Build an admin page that'll list the users of a phpBB system, with a checkbox next to each. Click the checkbox(es), hit 'Save'... And it deletes the selected users. We're getting so many damn spam users signing up, and it's a bitch to go through the phpBB admin interface and delete them from there. :S (How do you other forum admins cope?)</li>
</ul>

Right, that's it for today. *Waves*

After passing through the script-kiddy phase (""Inline SQL doesn't matter, and who needs these 'function' things, anyway?""), the ""Java"" phase (by which I mean over-engineering absolutely <b>EVERYTHING</b>, taking Object-Oriented design and Modularisation to silly extremes), the DIY-Framework phase (""I can make it work... Honestly... Err... Ok, it sucks, I did my best, ok?""), the CMS phase (""I <3 <a href=""http://drupal.org"">DRUPAL</a> OMG!!1"")... I've finally come up with an architecture (I hate using that word) for the new InsanityManga.net site that:

a) Uses a simple, PHP-based, home-brew templating system, instead a myriad of stupid and pointless formatting functions like 'paintSideBarHeaderTitle()',
b) Uses a bunch of simple objects (like 'gallery', 'plain_page'),
c) Can be implemented in three weeks of solid coding (real-life estimate, two months, one if I spend Christmas holidays doing it),

And most importantly...
d) Doesn't suck (much).


Next few steps:
- Draw up a simple overview of the code structure
- Do some class diagrams for a few of the objects
- Work out coding and naming conventions <b>now</b>, rather than having 'paintHeader()' here, and 'print_header_block()' over there
- Set up the repository on Orthrus so I can actually keep track of the different versions of code (using <a href=""http://venge.net/monotone"">Monotone</a>)

*Cracks knuckles.*

(Fortunately, I did all the front-end design stuff in advance, I'm still using that. This is all about the structure underneath.)

I haven't posted for ages, so I figured it was about time I wrote something and let you lot know that I'm not entirely dead yet. What follows is a brief summary of the wild and wonderful (and not-so-wonderful) events that happened between the last post and this one. Hang on tight to your pillow, 'cause this is going to get a bit dull. :P

<lj-cut text=""Snippety-snip"">
On the bland side of things, I've hit third year of Uni, barely passed accounting (50/100 - ouch), and am doing a year of work placement at <a href=""http://squiz.net"">Squiz.net</a> (one of the companies that survived the dot-com splat, and are doing rather well out of government work) where I'm employed as a full-time PHP developer (yeah, snigger if you want).

As far as messy interpersonal things go, Aya and I broke up way back in June/July (or thereabouts). We're still friends, and still co-run <a href=""http://insanitymanga.net"">InsanityManga.net</a> (what is/was Kabukiyasha.net last year, also known as The-Manga-Site-Noone-Can-Remember-Or-Spell-The-Name-Of).


Recreational activity-wise, as mentioned above, I'm still doing the coding and maintenance for InsanityManga.net, as well as the general organisation and admin work. (Conventions! Argh! O_O;) New members of Insanity include Nny, Aya's housemate, and Blox, one of the fans of Virus we're enamoured with enough to ask him to join us. :P

Speaking of conventions, Aya and I headed off to Melbourne for the Manifest 2005 weekend. Lots of fun... And very stressful. O_O; Oh, and I hate trams. And incompetent tram drivers. In any case, we cosplayed (myself as Cid Highwind, Aya again as Lenne) and ran the stall for the duration of the weekend.

At Animania, we also ran an artist table / stall, as well as cosplaying, this time with me again as Cid, Aya as Cloud, and Nny as Vincent. Very entertaining, except for the week-and-a-half solid work doing the chunky-arse Cloud sword.

Photos coming soon (as soon as I get off my lazy arse and finish all the Uni and work stuff first).


In completely unrelated matters, I'm now the proud, nerdy member of <a href=""http://www.star-fleet.com"">STF</a>, a Star Trek BB-style roleplaying site, playing an engineer of all things. If you're on the right ship, it's wonderful. The politics are horrible, utterly horrible, though. There's nothing worse than a nerd with power (pretend or not). Fortunately, the politics only apply if you try to help with improving things (coding, training new recruits, changing the utterly horrid interface, whatever), instead of just RPing like a good little member. It's enough fun to continue playing, but you get jaded pretty quickly. (In case anyone actually runs into me there, I'm Ensign David Webber, USS Valkyrie, Fleet 1.)


More recent activities include doing stupid things like rushing out and buying $50 worth of Killing Heidi albums after discovering they released more after ""Reflector"", taking (more) driving lessons in preparation for the P's test on the 25th, and generally procrastinating attempting to do the Work-Placement reports for Uni. Oh, and feeling all guilty-like for not having the Convention photos up yet. :S


Wandering off on yet another tangent, my recent techy projects include:
<ul>
<li>Writing the gallery import script for the Insanity Manga website, so I can import photos and gallery images without being driven to tears by the sheer tedium of manually resizing all the images (to two different sizes each), moving them around and renaming them, and typing out the SQL queries to insert them into the database.</li>
<li>Transferring Kabukiyasha.net over to InsanityManga.net (the latter is simply a pointer to the former for the moment).</li>
<li>Investigating CakePHP and Biscuit as two frameworks to build the new InsanityManga.net site in. I've tried a homebrew system, and learned a lot about what to do (and what not to do). In the end though, it's getting far too convoluted and messy too darn quickly - the framework is being relegated to the Admin panel, where it works just fine doing the limited sort of stuff it needs to do.</li>
<li>Setting up a Drupal system to get an example E-Commerce site page going. And maybe looking at the Blog feature later, so I don't have to write my own later on. :S</li>
<li>Putting the InsanityManga.net codebase into a portable repository using Monotone (or something similar). I've heard it's dog-slow, but I'm only dealing with a small project, so it should be fine.</li>
<li>Learning how this XMLHTTPRequest thing works (not going to be put into the Insanity site or anything, just idle interest).</li>
<li>Getting my <a href=""http://progsoc.org/~rhoward/samplenew.php"">revamped personal site thingy</a> working with Drupal (I am <b>not</b> going to code up custom stuff for that site, I've got enough on my plate as it is. O_O)</li>
<li>Updating Gentoo on the laptop without breaking it too badly, as well as doing a write-up how to get 3D and wireless working with it (to go with the former site). It's about time I gave back to the community already. ^^;</li>
<li>Switching to Eclipse at work - jEdit, what I currently use, is functional in that it has the bare basics, but nothing else. Anything decent has to be hacked in with macros. Unfortunately, everyone else in the office uses jEdit, so I'm going to have to be all adventurous-like.</li>
<li>Getting the wireless server set up to talk to Jeremy's end (he's about 300m away, but we have trees blocking direct line-of-sight, so it's going to get interesting).</li>
</ul>

*Phew*

Oh, and I want to get more of my little Warhammer miniatures painted up. They're so cute when they're wielding chain-swords. (Too bad the actual game sucks.)
</lj-cut>

As an aside, does anyone else find that LJ's layout completely borks in Mozilla (not Firefox, the suite thingy)? And I notice that there are a whole stack of free users with fancy themes... They must've changed something. Mental note to go investigate at some point.

And, umm, something completely random. When writing journal entries, posts, essays, anything, I jump around the page a lot. For example, while writing the above entry I hopped between the intro, techy section, the above paragraph and the RP section (no wonder it takes me hours to finish small RP posts), roaming all over the document leaving half-finished sentences and paragraphs everywhere.

... Scatterbrains of the world unite! :D

Today has been a great day of sadness.

And not the sorrowful kind.

During the blackout we had half-way through Christmas Eve tea, we... *Sniff* ... Danced and bopped to the MIDI tunes on my brother's mobile phone. And we took videos of ourselves with Dad's video camera. Shame has come to our household.

My, hasn't this been an interesting day?

Well, early this morning (try 1am-ish) the ailing server 'space' that http://kabukiyasha.net has been residing on finally came back up after being down for about 28 hours.

This morning I went for a quick drive to the hairdresser's to get my bonce-growth snipped. It doesn't look all the bad, actually, she managed to keep some of the wavyness in there (it only comes out if I have longish hair, otherwise it's unnoticeable). 

The drive preceeded a lunch of pies (I can imagine everyone shouting ""Who cares?!"" at this bit, but as the song goes, It's my blog, and I'll... umm... detail my eatinghabits if I want to), and a rather hellish drive to St. Leonards to take my dear mother to the hospital to her finger checked out. I do believe I can put St. Leonards under the 'interesting drive, if you enjoy mass disorganisation and weird lane organisation' category in my circular file. The carpark is one of those delightful ones that you don't realise is taking you gradually up until you look for a ramp up, and all you see is the slightly slanted ground. Tricky bastards.

When mummy-dearest returned, I put the key in the ignition and... *Clicker* *Clicker* ... Again... Same thing... ... Flat battery.  ... Shit.

How the car had managed to run out of batteries while being completely off I have no idea, but there you go. Fortunately, my father happened to be driving around there, so we pushed the car out into the carspace on the opposite side of the road (we were parked nose-in, and the cable's not that long), and we attached jumper leads and had a rip-roaring good time with sparks and flashes and bangs and everything.  ... Well. Not really. The car started, didn't stall, and I had another stressful drive back through St. Leonards and back home. (I'm going to have to go there a few times so I'm actually useful to someone - people seem to need to go there an awful lot.)

After that episode, I got back, err, drummed a bit, and, umm... Studied. w00t. I'm loving it. I have an exam tommorow. I'm excited.

...

And thus the pointless wibbling about cars and stuff concludes.

Ja,

Robert.

(PS: Oh, a whole slew of updates has happened to http://kabukiyasha.net/proto since you last looked, probably. Certain things are broken, though, because they depend on other things that aren't there, etc, etc. *Glum*)"

So there you go.

In other news, some progress on the site, but I'm waiting on others before I can get any further. <b>T_T</b>
The backend for the news is done, but I don't have a template to attach it to. The various Files pages (Virus, Insanity et al) don't have a backend due to me having no clue what's _in_ them, but they have a frontend (which I have yet to make into a template I can use).
Oh... Well, I can automate the Archives -> Virus page (and in turn the Extras -> Sidelines (or whatever they're called, <b><i>HELP!</i></b>) page) so I don't have to update them manually. I have the algorithm scribbled in my notebook already. I guess I'll get on with it while I wait for templates. <b>^^;</b>

In any case, cheerio.

Well. That was trippy.

Today was my Database Fundamentals exam. I was the first person out of the room, despite the fact that I'm tired and sick (*Shakes fist at <lj user=""Subfuture"">*), and shouldn't have finished under time, let alone an hour early. I checked and double-checked that I hadn't missed a section, but, umm, yeah. Weird. I'll see how I go as far as results are concerned. <b>:S</b>

Anyways, off to create random pages so I can destress. The results of which will appear <a href=""http://kabukiyasha.net/proto"">here</a>. It includes 'Contacts', and a mockup of 'Extras'. Enjoy, if you feel like doing that sort of thing. Umm.

It's been a busy week. Exams are coming up soo... err... tommorow. We finished the <a href=""http://kabukiyasha.net"">Kabukiyasha.net</a> website on the weekend. I'm still making minor changes here and there, especially since it failed the crash test Ashera gave it. We had to explain to her how to navigate to the manga, let alone how to enlarge each picture, so that's a couple of strikes against us. I've added a few little navigational aids, and changed with page the big picture on the home page directs you to, etc. Any further changes are going into /proto now, until I get it completely stable.

Among other things, I spent the weekend with Kabu, <lj user=""Selphie_Trabia""> and <lj user=""Subfuture""> taking part in the 24-hour manga challenge thingy (here's the entry: http://forums.ozcomics.com/showthread.php?s=&threadid=3730 ). 
Much fun was had by all. Sleep was had by some (myself included. I chickened out at 9am and had a few hours sleep. <b>-_-;;</b> *Tut tuts self*). Lollies were consumed, music was looped endlessly, random onigiri was made and devoured, dinner was made by a cranky Selphie, Kill Bill soundtracks were danced to, couches were being used by people taking sleeps in shifts, 'net connections were being erratic, Photoshop was being adored, MS FTP clients were being abused for not auto-detecting filetype (binaries end up with their last bit of every byte being shaved when sent in ASCII mode), much ink was used.

And, err, I'm running out of items here.


Anyway, Database Fundamentals tommorow. Wish me luck. <b>^^;</b>

(PS: The 24-hour challenge entry is going up under 'Extras' at <a href=""http://kabukiyasha.net"">Kabukiyasha.net</a>, in case you want to have a look later on.

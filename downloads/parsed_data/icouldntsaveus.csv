"event","Sometimes I feel as though I were born in the wrong time. The wrong era. My father was born in '45 and can remember listening to the radio in the evenings and the advent of television, and then color television, and when t.v. went off every night with the national anthem. Imagine that...the television actually going off the air, voluntarily, on a nightly basis. 
He can remember the delivery man leaving bottles of milk and cream on the steps, the ice man coming to restock his 'icebox' with a hard cut block of actual ice, being given 30 cents and feeling like the king of the world, buying up penny candy and a haircut every saturday as told as a little boy, and later, watching movies at a drive-in with a pretty girl in a pretty dress and cardigan. Sometimes I wistfully stare at pictures from my father's childhood, the clothing, the hair, the cars, the feeling, and wonder what is was like to live a life full of beauty and excitement in a still young and emerging America. 

What a world my darlings, what a world."

"event","<br />The ramblings, dreams and delusions of a hopeful human being in a consistently disparaging world. That is what this journal will become for me. Recently (for the last two years almost?) i've stayed away from this journal without keeping one in another medium and the result is my slight loss of sanity, feeling as though I have a million things I need to say/ scream, and then nothing at all. I keep quiet around others, just listening and learning. You'd really be surprised how much private information people spew to complete strangers. And of this anomaly comes my fear of doing the same, sounding like an idiot, looking like a fool, so i keep quiet, only to become known as stuck up or standoffish, when i'm simply...quiet. I speak, I chat, I laugh, but if i'm not&nbsp;telling dirty little secrets and not so dirty daily details of pointless drudgery then I must be hiding something, or worse:&nbsp;&nbsp; Boring.(<em>oh no! oh meh gawd! )</em>&nbsp;...So ends my rant with a tale to remember, or more so a word of unnecessary/obvious advice: the general public is littered with idiots. I fear that you should ever have to stand trial and be judged by a jury of your peers, be they the same people who try to exit a locked door multiple times unsuccessfully and continue to try the same door despite there being 7 more around just like it&nbsp;(i have <em>seen this!) <br /><br />P.s. more entries to ensue, join me in my journey? i'd love to have the company.<br /><br />SIgned,<br /><br />The misanthropic adventures of me!</em>"

"event","Wow, has it been so long since i've left off posting? I suppose non-digital life got ahold of me and forced me away from this wretched screen for quite some time. Alot has transpired in the time that I have been away. To think, a year ago this month I was walking across the commencement floor and receiving my degrees, yes DEGREES with an S! A YEAR AGO! wow! Since then I've been adjusting the the &quot;real&quot; world, as everyone continues to tell me. the real world? the fucking real world?!?! really? because working two jobs and freelancing whenever possible to put myself through college wasn't REAL enough for anyone?!?! ....ahem... sorry for the rant. Sitting at this keyboard, watching my words spill across the screen is a strange feeling, i suppose because it's been so long.&nbsp; 

To Andrew and Kevin...I see your posts here every now and again, and i'm sorry for not having been an active friend.&nbsp; Alot has gone on, family-wise, and hopefully i'll get to hear your voices soon..Coffee anyone? Dinner? A movie? Any form of human contact? 

To be quite honest, I don't even know why i'm posting here other than for friends that I could&nbsp;just as easily call.&nbsp;I thought I was ready for a comeback, but I wonder if I should just rid myself of this live journal altogether. Hmm. Something to ponder? I think so.

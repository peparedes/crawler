"event","Well, it's officially fall. The first cold front of the season has made it's grand entrance and I'm extremely ecstatic!. I'm sitting here at the Union gazing out the window and listening to Jens Lekman on my iPod while the front puffs around lifeless autumn leaves which are now accumulating onto the ground. The traces of caffeine in my veins along with the lingering taste of coffee, my music, and the morphing weather are giving me a sense of euphoria. Even the ants crawling around on my table seem to be happy with me!"

"event","Chiptunes make me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. They take me back to my happy childhood days with my Game Gear, Sega Genesis and even my uncle's ancient Atari 2600. I suppose that is why I openly welcome electronic driven beepbeepbleepbloopiness. It's my everlasting love with technology.

Oh LOL! Remember in high school when I used to be a little wannabe mod? Yeah, those days are over. I grew up. No more Motown, no more the Who, no more I wanna Vespa, and no more bobbed hair-cuts. I look back at that little phase I went through and how I was so passionate about it and laugh. It was stupid and so <i>teenage</i>. 

I am also not crazy about the Beatles anymore. The Beatles have been replaced with Kraftwerk. My dad would hate to hear me say this and he might quite possibly kill me. I love Kraftwerk way more than the Beatles. I'm not saying the Beatles are crap! It's just that the Beatles don't really mean anything to me anymore. Kraftwerk's main drive is technology, and I love technology like I said before. It's just natural for me to choose Kraftwerk over the Beatles. This probably sounds like pointless crap to you guys. Hahah!"

It was a great feeling driving buzzed off of homemade hazelnut coffee while listening to Die Mensch Maschine. I have a love affair with Kraftwerk and coffee.

On my way home the stupid subliminal McDonald billboards lured me into their trap with their fat ass imagery of Big Macs and fries. I <i>had</i> to pick up a Big Mac and some fries in Harlingen because the images were branded into...my <flicker>SOUL!</flicker>. And now I feel guilty after eating my meal. So, I think that should be the last time I'll ever drive on an empty stomach...DAMN YOU MCDONALD'S!!

He was taking the trash out the front entrance which makes no sense since we have a door at the back of the store that is <i>close</i> to the dumpster. We have that back door for a reasons and one of them is for taking out the trash! I asked him why he wouldn't simply use back the door, and he came up with an illogical response. ""Uhhh, I just don't want it to make it seem like I'm taking anything that I shouldn't be taking, ya know? especially with the manager not being around."" I said, ""ok, but that doesn't make any sense."" He said, ""ya know Ana, you just gotta play it safe."" I thought, ""wtf?"" I really wanted to say, ""why would anyone think you're stealing anything, you're taking out the trash! going out the front door with bags makes you look more suspicious than going out the back, dumb ass!!"" But I didn't argue with him, because he clearly didn't know what the hell he was taking about. He also goes to the restroom way too much than normal. I know he goes to drink alcohol because he comes back and smells like it, and I already discussed this with the owner. I WORK WITH A BUNCH OF ALCOHOLIC DUMB ASSES and it's unsettling.nu

I purchased a small aquarium, two plant decorations, a little bag of stones and cute ancient Greek pillars to go along with the set-up. The fishies are sooo adorable and have been swimming around happily in their new home. I named them Florian, Ralf, Fritz and Henning. Uh huh, I named them after the German 1970s-80s techno pioneers from Kraftwerk. Y que?

I had a crappy day at work last night...again. The register was malfuctioning (it didn't want to open) and we couldn't get a new roll of printing paper to feed into the credit card terminal in the middle of a customer rush. We also ran out of change from the register and I couldn't open the safe to get more because I don't have the authorization to do so. I had to call the manager and he sent his sancha over to help us out. I was embarrassed and a bit stressed out over the problem, but she told me that it was no problem and not to worry about it. I worked with the owner's brother-in-law and he saw me work my hardest that night. He's the reason why the owner's like me so much. He usually brags about my work ethic and how I always am at my best. Soo, mad props to myself.

We also made an ass load of money last night.

I went to my Quizno's today immediately after my exams because I hadn't eaten anything prior and I was craving a honey mustard chicken sub, and what the hell, I get 50% off my meal. Well, my manager gave me a free meal courtesy of him because he said I earned it after what happened the night before. I thought that was pretty considerate of him. He sometimes may be a lazy ass, but at least he is a kind and considerate lazy ass, and for that, I appreciate him.

And from now on, I'm only going to be driving European sports cars. I'm in love with my VDUB Golf. Later in life when I have the money, I'm getting an Audi. Ja ja ja! Wir fahr'n fahr'n fahr'n auf der Autobahn! fahr'n fahr'n fahr'n auf der Autobahn!"

"event","I'm counting down the days and hours for my departure from Austin to Harlingen. I took two days off from work--Friday and Saturday. I don't leave until very early Saturday morning, but my co-workers are <i>supposed</i> to think that I'm leaving Friday night, so sssssh. I'm looking foward to happy shopping times at Whole Foods Market and maybe, hopefully I could purchase a Macbook from the Apple store if they could draw up a monthly plan for me.

Oh god, yesterday was an awkward time at work. I had to work with sanchita and she had to share with me that she needed tampons. So, she left me to work all by myself for a few minutes while she went to Dollar Tree to pick up some tamponitos.

And then...my manager showed up to help his gurrrl clean up the store in his scrappy pajamas. The worse moment was when he was bent over sweeping under the toaster oven and I was trying to cross by to dump some sanitation buckets. His ass backed up into me with underwear lines, plumber's crack and all. I didn't need that..I didn't need that at all.

Also, someone had the bright idea of purchasing a radio for the kitchen area. It plays Wild 104 24/7 ghetto booty jamz and it just adds another awful factor for me at work. I'm stuck with the radio and there is no way I could listen to anything that'll keep my sanity in check, because all radio stations in the Valley are horrible, sadly except NPR. I'd only be ridiculed for switching the radio to NPR because..no one else appreciates. 

Our regular customer, Ryan Wolf came by last night. He's actually a pretty nice and polite guy once you get the douche baggery he seems to portray on Channel 4 and his shrimpy stature. Mind you, he's shorter than me. He always orders the same damn bourbon chicken sub whenever he visits us and people think he's like a god or something whenever he is present. Funny thing is that whenever he walks in, we freak out and try to keep the store as clean as possible. It's like, ""oh god, here comes the muthafuckin'foodpatrol!! clean something!!"" After he ate, he left a pinche mess for me to clean.

God, I can't wait until I'm out of work. I get paid tomorrow. Yeeahhh bitches!@"

I have a cold/cough. My voice sounds like a 12 year old boy at the ripe stages of male puberty. :( :( :( :( No, no, no, I am not liking this one bit at all.

I'm at school right now trying to finish up some Spanish assignments at the computer lab and I'm fixing to high tail my ass out of here. Some dude was sitting right next to me a few minutes had a case of BO. My nose is stuffy, so the effect of the odor was diminished a bit, to say the least. 

I'm look forwarding to going home and eating some easy mac before I go into toasty hell and have to deal with the douche baggery of what is the archetype of an idiotic Quizno's customer. 

Now there is another guy right behind me who is talking unnecessarily loud about ""sutures and shit"". He made me lose my train of thought...aww shit.. 


Yeahh, I think I should be going home right about now."

I missed a day from school because I was waiting around for the activation of my new car's insurance and I didn't want anything horrible to happen to my car. The poor baby was vulnerable. Sooo, I failed to show up for a chapter test and it tarnished my grade in psychology, but thankfully the professor let me make it up because I secretly obtained a doctor's excuse since my parents are really good friends with a doctor. Being good friends with doctors really pays off, y'know. So anyway, all of that stressing over my GPA getting the shits threw my immune system off guard and now I have a sore throat and cold. Well, shit."

It has been a few months since I've worked out. Yesterday, I did some crazy ass Gillian Michael's cardio and my arms, back and ass cheeks are soo sore today.

I'm still trying to save up for a macbook. I'm afraid that by the time I will be ready to purchase it, apple would have a newer, more advanced laptop on their market...and then I'll be sad...

My old Camry is still dead. It has to do with the alarm system interfering with the voltage of the car battery. It's preventing the ignition from starting. The mechanic needs to slap that bitch.

Someone please shoot me at work."

I'm going to miss those tennis players since the tournament ended yesterday. This past week has been a hot, male foreigner extravaganza at Quizno's! I talked shortly with a Russian and Venuzuelan yesterday afternoon while at work. It was awesome. The Russian guy wasn't bad looking at all, either. He kinda, sorta reminded me of a Paul Bettany from Wimbledon. Cha--chiingngng!! 

I turned around to look out my window and I see two little lizards facing each other. They are having a little lizard conversation! It's so cute!"

I chose to make another one because I feel like starting fresh would prompt me to update often. <br /><br />I recieved my packages from Japan yesterday and when I arrived home to find them sitting on my porch, I felt excited like a neurotic chihuahua. Here is what I recieved in my package:<br /><br /><u><b><a href=""http://misola.269g.net/image/anpan-2.JPG"">anpan</a></b></u> - Sweet bread filled with sweet red beans. I love this stuff!!!<br /><b>Shigekix Super Ramune</b> - These gummies are intensely sour at first, but taste like soda after a while. Yum!<br /><u><b><a href=""http://shop.sfriend.ne.jp/~kanemochizake/product/yokan.jpg"">yokan citron</a></b></u> - A dense block of lemon flavored gelatin that is eaten with green tea. It's too sweet for my taste. <br /><u><b>Konpeito</b></u>- These are star shaped crystalized sugar balls. They're nice too look at, but the taste is nothing phenomenal. It's like eating bumpy sugar cubes.<br /><b>Azuki red bean Kit-kats</b> - These are great! One thing I really love about Japanese Kit-Kats is that their wafers are a lot much thicker than their American counterparts.<br /><b><u>Kurogo Pocky</u> </b>- Awww, I love these! These are shortbread sticks coated with black sesame and other yummy stuff.<br /><b>Green Tea Mousse Pocky</b> - I haven't tried these yet, though I'm sure they are ass loads of awesomeness. <p> I haven't eaten all of my treats yet, but I've been tasting bits here and there. So far soo good.</p>"

"event","so i havent been updating for awhile...
i might as well fill you all in on some of the recent activites of my little life here in boston....
im still in serious crush with the neighbor....he's just too cute for words and all i can think about when he is around is sex...drives me crazy
the kids i babysit for are still wonderful...everyday the little boy Will cracks me up..he has such a hilarious personality already at this young of an age...but spending so much time with them makes me miss my little sisters and brother
i get to see my dads 2 little guys, taylor and caleb, alot more than i get to see stephanie...she is already 6 and i feel like i barely know her cause i have been out of the house for so long. my mom told me on the phone that she has really long hair now....this all has led me to the decision of after i get back from my trip to europe..(read on) to go home to Ptown for a few days...its about time..i miss the ocean...i miss my fam...i miss some friends down there....and i miss my dog Taj...
so in 2 days i will be preparing to board a plane over to England to visit my LOVELY friend shay and hopefully somehow meet up with jess...after 2 nights in london in a hotel with alissa, me, aliss, and autumn are flying over to ireland to go visit our AMAZING regis!! after 2 nights over there drinking at the pubs, we come back to england..alissa flys out the next day but autumn and i will be gracing the country till the 14th....im so excited although really nervous about the amount of money this is going to cost me...the exchange rate is horrible now that bush has led our dollar value into the tubes with this war...
thats all for now...i update more when i get back to the states...missing all my friends that i dont get to see....big party on the hill when we are back....."

"event","this has been the best snow day ever.....it started when i woke up in the BIG guest room at the Drubners house and then made chocolate pancakes with the kids and decided to trek it home for a bit while the snow had stopped and shay's plane had been delayed....turns out the trek was more like a journey through this white tundra of snow that was literally, and when i say literally i mean my pants were soaked from the thighs down, of 3 feet snow...the T was thankfully running, but running late and running snow and certainly wasn't magically running up the hill for my ass...so i had to bare the cold and trudge up the hill thanking whatever power is up there when i finally got home that i didnt live even a foot farther...
then chilled with the roommates the best we know how and enjoyed a giggly few hours with music and video taping memories :) 
we then talked about pancakes and decided it was our turn to make them...so we made bomb ass blueberry pancakes with boysenberry syrup...followed by a few pots of coffee and some movies...and now we have finished a good dinner made with whatever we had in the fridge...
i'm so glad that everyone is snowed in here...its fun to sit around and drink hot cocoa and watch movies and just chill...
needless to say i told the family that i could not bare to make the journey again so i wouldnt be able to sit tonight..
our next mission is late night sledding on parker hill with the fellas upstairs....should be a fun time filled with plenty of wipeouts...
i talked to my parents at home and they said that there was 40 in. of snow....thats like taller than my little sister..she would be lost if she went out to play..thankfully, they cant even open the door"

"event","let me start this one of on a good note since i feel like i might start to vent....

i have recently started a new SICK ASS nannying job...$15+ an hour (they always hit me up with extra)and to drive the two kids around (8, and 5) i get the BRAND NEW(as in 35mi.) 2005 Lexus suv w/ tan leather interior...im more excited about getting to drive the car then spend with the kids. they are great as well. very friendly and have anything they could ever dream of. i pick them up at school and then we go to whatever lessons they have that day (skating, swimming, squash, magic, karate, basketball) and then home to play until i make dinner and then get them ready for bed. i feel bad for them because you can tell they have never had their parents around much and have always had nannies. but its ok because i feel like i'll make even a small difference in their little lives...

autumn came home last night but she has brought back more than just suveniers...she has some sort of throat infection where she says it feels like razor blades slice her as she swallows...so much for cuddling with the roomie upon her arrival....

so today i come home from work and have listened to voicemails about how my used to be ex-roommate is coming back today. it sent me into a fuming rage because:
A.) she has not talked to us really about any of her decisions as of yet 
B.)she just picked up and left and now just wants to unpack and stay 
C.) she still hasnt addressed the fact that she is fucking over one of my good friends and 
D.) does she expect just to walk in the door like ""honey im home""? 
i mean how am i supposed to act when she comes through the door after a month of absence in every sense of the word....

anyways, enough of that....i'll just handle it as it comes...i just hope she doesnt hit those buttons that make me want to handle things in my own way..a big ole' ass whoppin'....

i think i'll go vent off more steam in my real journal...enough of this girly drama!
i guess i missed this whole section on the lease...where did i sign up for this??"

"event","so here i am...in the apartment alone, for the next 10 days or so...just me and Chief
the kitchen floor just got re-finished so it wreaks of urethane up in here...maybe thats the little buzz im feeling????
the stresses of finding a job are completely consuming my dreams
i wake up sweating and panting, thinking that the nightmare of me falling on my face, out on my own, has become true....with only $70 in my bank account, its pretty possible
babysitting is where the money is at.....at like 15$ an hour i cant think of anything else to make that kind of cash....undeclared
although i do miss my dancing....i was thinking about trying to find something that may let me do some of that, but that seems pretty impossible...unless i worked at the Glass Slipper....i dont think so~
so about la la-ing....oh i need some sweet la la in my life on a regular basis..guess that makes sense...when you are getting laid every day life looks so bright..with all those hormones flying around...
hopefully the boy upstairs will be into a little deal of a change in ""friendship""...maybe a little benefits for the girl under him :)
anyways, im bored...if you are coming to boston, or want to, call me up....there is plenty of space here for the next 2 weeks...."

"event","what is it with that room in the back of the kitchen? it detracts roommates faster than we can help... the drama now.....she decides to  move out and then jumps back in to stay.. Candice is already planning on moving in, she has a new person for her place, and we are excited to start our new little family. It seems absurd to even think that it would be ok to back out on such a serious decision. i can understand wanting to go back to school, but that doesnt change the fact that she watched us look for a new roommate, saw her getting all ready to make the transition, and now im worried this might get ugly. its a shame to feel like i have to be a bitch to one of my good friends from home, someone i have A MILLION memories with, but its also crazy to think of me telling one of my best friends here at school ""sorry too bad"".... the worst part was when she said that Candice would be the only one getting hurt in this situation, so i should just calm down....EXACTLY why IM PISSED!!! i dont want candice to hurt and certainly not because of her....
so now the dilemma is how to continue this transition as smooth as possible, and to try and not loose this person who means something to me...money is the underlying issue and being into living here...the atmosphere can't constantly have all this tress and still feel like home....when did this craziness happen and when will it end.... PLEASE let me know opinions on what you would do...do i tell my friend that its just not fair and although legally her name is still on the lease, we think its not going to work, or do i tell someone who is relying on this place that she now has 2 weeks to find some other living situation....i dont think i ever would do that to candice, and personally, i think she is the missing piece to this puzzle we have here in this house...and little lucy...cheif needs to be with his sister and have someone to run around crazy with....it all seemed soooo simple a month ago..."

"event","well its about 10 degrees here but thankfully we have finally gotten our heat to work....its about time...
christmas was a great time...i brought autumn home to meet the fam. she loved it....even though it was ice cold and a ghost town since its off-season...
plans for candice to move in are going fast and i cant wait. im so excited to have 2 kitties! (which mine is perched on my shoulder as i type) its weird....Cheif has such an incredibly strong personality...i know that sounds crazy and im sure i will get plenty of ""cat-crazed"" comments, but my kitten thinks he is some sort of ornament on me...he walks around on my back and tries to keep his balance as i do my own thing...silly little thing....oh how i missed him while i was at home for the holidays....
so for new years i was planning a trip to NYC with aut, but turns out funding has ceased to improve so now im thinking i will try and work...anywhere....for the night and make some loot...at least i wont have to be sitting around thinking about how much fun i WOULD be having if i were to be under that glorious ball...
i love the fact that its break from school, but i cant wait for everyone to get back from home....i miss all my friends!!!!!! and it will be even better because now, 2 more of my lovelies will be back...
i got an email today from student universe about my trip to LONDON!!! its really real! you cant even fathom how ecstatic i am about this...and seeing jess and shay!! with my roommates....what could be better you ask?? hoping the pond while we are there and visiting regis in good ole' Ireland! these are the memories i cannot WAIT to make!
i have been thinking alot about how sad i will be if i dont get to spend any time this winter in my home-away-from-home, Jamaica....its paradise like no other...once you get off the plane, there is this chill factor in the air...no worries... sooo true....and the beaches, and the cheap drinks, and the wonderful people, and how could i forget its main CROP!! 
my year looks like it will be a busy one with plenty of traveling...as long as i keep babysitting for all these rich, spoiled, overprivledged children all over the place, i should be able to afford what i want to do...
enough blabbing away here....time for some tide and fabric sheets"

"event","so finally i come to relieve some stresses....its been too long without writing...sometimes i wish i had all the time in the world to just sit under some beautiful tree somewhere extravagant and just pour out everything onto the magic little notebook i would have. after i would close it everything would go away.......

im so stoked for this weekend....most of my lovelies will be back here in boston to see my place and party like we used to...there will be some missed...(coughcough--SHALAYLAH!!!!!--coughcough) but she will be toasted to..

thinking about how our lives were a year ago is crazy. who knew we would have to say goodbye to so many and who knew life could end up with so many crazy times...it makes me smile and laugh thinking about it.


i LOVE my new apartment...i swear, eveytime i walk in here i fall in love all over again..its a safe haven here in the big city where there are so many assholes and shallow bitches...that first breath and taking off my jacket alsways puts me in this serene state and i never want to leave....

which is what has led me here...spending time worrying about the enevitable future i will soon have to deal with..trying to spend evey minute i can talking to my dad or making sure my mom is feeling happy... 

it's really weird looking at those first people you were ever introduced to..the basice foundation of any relationship you will ever have in your life..slipping away from you...its a helpless feeling and leads me into those times where im in my own world...i feel bad about complaining...

i like to think im optimistic. i like to think im sympathetic. i like to think im dependable, responsible, and self-less...but during these times ive decided its time to throw alot of this out the window...not forever of course...i do think i will have a happy life...but for now, i just want to be sad. i want to be mad. i want to be selfish and frustrated. 

so the new disorder i have aquired through this lifestyle is an obsessive cleaning frenzy. and organizing everything. i knew i was going crazy when i organized my sock drawer. but its cool....its a little control on this crazy rollercoaster. 

sometimes i get nervouse about the ride...i mean, did i remember to fasten my seatbelt and are there really some sort of handle bars???"

"event","so its been awhile...but fear not

so anyways...Lots going on in the land of far-away over here in P-town. Justine lives with me now. she is my best friend from home and her family moved to maine, henceforth phoebe gains a roommate...its going good....so far

working is all i feel like i do...that and lay in the sun....i have only seen 2 famous people so far while waitressing...the first was Jai from Queer Eye and the other was Margaret Chow...she's hilarious...and looks damn good considering last summer she was about 100lbs. heavier

i have been missing my boston ladies like crazy...so i thought a nice weekend trip up to boston would do the trick. it was absolutely incredible to see all of the people who i care about so much..(although a few were missing!) and then we partied and laughed like old times...the weekend ended with not enough beds and a cranky traveling partner so we drove all the way back here at 3 in the morning....bummer....but it did make me realize just why im so excited for this summer to end and why my friends from school are so important to me...

the invitation to any of you is always open....i MISS you all, i miss the boston essence and would love to have any bit of it down here in ptown with me....let me know if you want to visit...plenty of room and the ferry comes straight from boston to ptown!"

"event","so we are sitting here in our new bungalow in the basement....we being myself and justine, my best pal from home....we have been friends since before we even knew because we grew up together on the same street and went to scool together until graduation 2 years ago....so now its back for some old time fun and she will be living here for the summer...its exciting....im happy to come home to someone and be able to laugh and chat with someone before falling asleep....not to mention the bed is MUCH more comfortable with her added Feather Bed....

so working has been great. it hasn't been very busy yet but im still making a nice chunk of change to save up and put towards that aweful RENT stigma i'll have following me next year...i started waitressing nights instead of days and life is so much more pleasant...the time spent at the tables is alot less and the bill goes up alot higher alot quicker, hence a much larger portion to me! and now i am able to spend my days full of sunshine on the water..

so i had this dream last night...VERY INTENSE....the whole dream revolved around me waking up to realize that Bush had been re-elected.. shit went down in the world and when i say that i mean SHIT WENT DOWN...bombs were everywhere, the women were slaves, everyone who wasnt from the United States had to wear these weird tracking dog collars and people were dying all over the place...the reason i put this in to my entry tonight is to ensure myself that all of you lovelies reading this realize how important it is for the WORLD'S SAKE to vote and get this pig-headed, masochistic republican out of here....

friends are starting to visit this weekend and im soooo excited....everyone better be planning a vacation for down here in august...i'm trying to go find out when the carnival weekend festivities occur and that's when i want all of your asses down here partying with me and the cape crew....not to mention bon fires on the beach :)"

"event","today is the big day.....a HUGE step towards major acceptance in Massachusetts and it was so nice to be able to be a part of it today. there were crews and crews of television stations and newspapers all over town asking everyone all kinds of questions and everyone was just so happy. it was incredible to be able to share something so important and so meaningful with all of those strangers and feel so involved....in the words of my pal katie...brava!

so today today was a great day. it was my first day off since i have been home so i got to spend some much needed quality time with mommy dearest....went walkingn downtown and then had a great dinner...followed by a trip to get some homemade ice cream strawberry shortcakes with steph.

the next few days i'll be starting to train to work nights which is VERY exciting because now when all of my friends come and visit me i can spend some beach time with you all....soooo exicted...start planning...i am expecting to see most of you AT LEAST once...."

everyone is just how i left them and still doing the same things they WERE doing

it was so exciting to see my little sis, Steph...i cant believe she will be 6 this summer...time flies by....she can already start to read and write...its unbelievable thinking about how tiny she was and now thinking of what a little girl she has become....AMAZING!

i already miss my boston family. it was weird washing my face and brushing my teeth last night by myself....it was weird eating breakfast by myself....so to end my troubles, bitches better be coming to visit! :)

looking at all of this stuff to unpack is one of those things where i dont even know where to start. There are so many boxes and bags and i know that because of my packing skills (which are at the beginner level) everything is in everything and the only way to get what i need is to unpack it ALL! an interesting way for me to spend this cold day."

why is it that the most wonderful people i have met in awhile only came into my life just recently...i just feel pissed at fate for not letting me have had all of my AMAZINGLY BEAUTIFUL AND WONDERFUL friends around in my life for previous time....and then the other voice hollas out ""dude, you get to go to fucking hawaii, london, new york....shit man stop your whining and buy some KICK ASS postcards"" 
so on that...good luck to you lovelies and keep in touch...it will be pretty hard not to since ill be stalking you all  :)

tonight tonight.....where is everyone? it feels so empty and quiet here now and no one wants to do anything grand...i'll take initiative and start to drinking...even it does end up one of those lame-hang-around-the-dorm-and-drink-and-smoke-butts  kinda nights...
these are the nights i'll be missing during the CRAZINESS of our place next year!

"event","contrary to what most may think....i actually think this may be fun. in fact i can see myself having ALOT of fun with this whole LJ experience. To start things off, lets get it straight that i have been opposed to these types of blogs since i first heard of them....now, because of circumstances (::coughcough-hawaii-coughcough::) i am changing my opinion. what is more fun than to share your day with the people who you always have, and to get to share it when they arent even in the same state.

for a little history....there has been quite a load of DRAMA attached to these things usually and this will not be one of the petty journals. im thinking ill use this not only to write about my days and how much i miss people over the summer and next semester (::coughcough-hawaii-coughcough::) but i think it will be a good creative place....so be prepared if randomness occurs...

so today has been amusing...woke up bright and early next to a beauty (emily) and she even got up with me this morning...did the whole bartolmania scene and tried to scrounge up something that didnt look as if it fell off the back of a truck, and unsuccessfully, headed back to this here haven we call hell...i mean SMITH
after a few chain smoking sessions and carrying everything out of my room, the day was spent in the computer lab doing busy work for computer science...now that i have been concentrating for over 3 consecutive hours, its time to go for a little walk with some lovelies and maybe jam with nicki on the guitar....then for tonight, finishing up this mess of a project and proceeding to get tipsy with my lady friends before this chapter of our lives comes to an end....

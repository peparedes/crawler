"event","I just got off work at the waffle. My shift was from 5pm to 1am. oh yeah. It wasn't too bad. Like 30 minutes before i got off, these 3 super fine guys walked in, and right then i knew i was about to make some new friends. THey didn't sit in my section, but like that would stop me. I talked to 'em a little about one of their GG Allen t-shirts. When i got off, work that is, i sat at the tall bar to smoke a cigarrette and give them a chance to talk to me. They giggled a little and whispered a few things, then the cutest one asked me what my name was. Oh yeah! I went and sat with them and chatted for a bit, and now i'm goin to a punk show with them tomorrow night. Hell yeah. 
Ooh, Ooh, i got a boyfriend i think now. Tweek asked me out, so i figure it means he's my boyfriend. And like the whole night we were together makin out and other shit. He said some super awesome things to me. Definate sweety. Me and jake totally broke up by the way. Jack ass. I get to spend the whole weekend next weekend with Matt, which is Tweek. Tweek is Matt, get it? You probably don't. It's ok, don't hate me cuz i'm wittier than you are. Right. ok, nevermind. 
I went to my 2nd party Friday at the globe. It was an awesome night. They didn't open the back doors though, and it was kinda stuffy in there, but not too bad. Oh my goodness, i can't wait to go back this weekend. Friday and saturday night!!!!!!!!! and saturday and sunday morning!!!!!!!!!
     !!!!!!!!!!!!!!One huge weekend of partying!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm gonna be way cracked out come sunday evening. Someone please drive me back to alabama. Let's all go to alabama!No, wait, i forgot, alabama kinda sucks..ok, really sucks.
 I took Randy Dobson to the rave friday. He had a blast. He always used to go to raves before. I even had a dream with Randy in it last night. It was wierd, funny, and wierd.  
                                  Imagine...
                ...Me, and some other big load of people were at some club in the parking lot dancin to some tunes, and there was this group of break dancers that i was really entrigued by. That's all i remember of that part, but the scene changed into me walking in the road in front of my house and Randy comes up to me and we walk into the culdisack. He starts tellin' me that he was nominated as the year's best break dancer at that party i was at, but i didn't know he was there. Anyways, we hear somethin and turn our heads, and 3 little purple shiny aliens were standing like 3 inches away from us next to their soaceship. I remember seein them and screaming as loud as i could, and so was randy. I don't know why i found that so funny, just the alien part really. I never had a dram with extraterestrials were in, but now i have. 
 I really like Matt. I really like most guys though. There is somethin a little different about him though. He's in the army, but i don't think that's it. I don't know, and it could be that the only times that i've been with him is when i was rollin or comin down from a roll. We had fun in his car on the way to the after party though that was a total mess. Mae's brother drove matt's car so he was in the backseat with me!!! Oh yea! 
The after party was a wreck. We got to these people's house in the middle of bum fuck past Hiram down H-278, and were there for 15 minutes before they kicked us out. 20 or so ravers now standing on these people's lawn, and the lady comes out in the middle of a pot circle and sees me hittin the pipe. That i have to say was classic! It was shitty though, Mae wanted to say bye to Geena, and her roomate(the one that saw me puffin') was such a bitch and wouldn't let her. They got in a fight over it too. The roomate pushed and slapped mae, and she pushed her back to the floor. Mae broke down dude. I felt horrible for her. Her bean was turning bad she said, and i could totally believe it, but that's enough negative. That day is over, and a new one is beginning. 

Peace Out, Nicolai"

"event","workin at the waffle is a blast so far, but i haven't really started workin yet. I'm still in training, so i don't realy do much. Tomorrow, i start on the floor. I'm scared, but excited. i can make some tips at least. The first day of my training i met 2 other chicks that were just startin there, and we hit it off pretty well. Last night we all got drunk together at the park and had a ball. We ended up goin to waffle house, and bein as drunk as me and shellie were, we started booty dancin'. Now if yall know what kinda people go to the waffle at like 12:30 a.m., you'd know they were all starin' their asses off at us, cuz we had it goin on!! It was fun. I even humped the floor. We hung out tonight too, but i only got a little buzz, and no one else drank. Not enough vodka.oh well, there is always tomorrow!!
  There's this guy jeremy that's the cook at waffle. He's pretty cute, but you can tell he's a player. Now i aint no player hater, but i do like to teach 'em lesson and have fun while doin' it. So me, Sarah, and Shellie are gonna play on his playground for a while and tire him out. We got it planned out. He's not from alabama either, and he actually knows what dank is. No one over here knows the meaning of good pot. It sucks!!! I'm gonna get some fire dank when i go to Ga this weekend and blow these alabaman's minds. i can't wait. I just can't wait to get some good pot so i can puff it.soon my time will come. 
Oh my god, someone just immed me the most hillarious pic!! It's a guy that can give himself head. Anyone who reads this must request a copy, because it is so damn awesome. it might be a once in a lifetime thing to see. It is too good. 
ok, i'm outta here. come get that pic!!"

"event","I went to my aunt's river house on the river yesterday. It was more fun than i thought it would be. I was the oldeest of the bunch, which was refreshing. I saw my step cousin Josh that i hadn't seen in forever. He was probably 11 last time i saw him, now he's 16. He got cute too. Too bad he is my cousin kinda. We don't have any blood relation, but the title is semi there. He turned out all right though. I got pulled on the innertube, and it was totally a blast. My arms are increddibly sore today though. It's worth it. IT was kinda cool. My aunt bummed me a cigarrette. I'm still tryin to quit, but it's hard. Whenever i see someone smokin, or even when i think about it sometimes, the thought of havin one doesn't go away. Then i have to indulge into one. 
I went to my 1st rave last week. It was too fun. I'm goin back soon. Maybe next week, but for sure the 18th and 19th. I hadn't rolled in such a long time either. I can't wait to go back!"

"event","Bonnaroo was once again one of the most wonderful and amazing experiences of my life. All the people were so nice and so exepting of everyone that was there. It was because we were all there for the same main reason. The music. The music is what sets us free. Bonnaroo is it's own subculture that gets together each year to let go of all the bullshit of american society, and to get as fucked up as possible on as many psychadelics that one can find. I ate so much acid, some molly, sass, shrooms, and smoked pot till the sun came up, at least the first night i did literally til the sun came into sight. It was a beautiful bonnaroo sunrise that i only get to see once a year. I met so many awesome people. I shit you not, i even met Ben Harper's girlfriend. I just started talkin to this chick after the 1st show of the Machine and we laughed a little and talked some more, and then she told me she was the girlfriend of the man who sings I'm gonna burn one down. That was so cool! I was trippin pretty damn hard that night too! The Machine is a Very kick ass Pink Floyd cover band from New York. They rocked my brain so hardcore, and sent me on such a fat trip. So much more happened. I sold a good few necklaces. I gave away more of them though, but i like it better that way sometimes. I only sold them when i went broke, or traded them for food. On Sunday, i was sellin 'em on the road and some guy came up to me and Brett and started chattin, and he ended up gettin me spun for free! He was a good man, and i shall always remember him. 
  
Anyways, i really could go on and on and on for such a long time about Bonnaroo, but i'll save some of it for later. Monday when i got back, me and Jen went over to Cher's house and i got to meet her for the 1st time along with Audry and Amanda. They all seemed too cool. Cher is too awesome. She really gets into Boggle, but hey, so did i. It's a great game and it makes you think, but not too hard, so it's all good. I went swimming for like 3 minutes and jumped out. It was a wee bit nipply for me, and the 5 of us chilled and talked on the patio. 

Yesterday was awesome. Me, Jen, Jessica, Cher, and Cher's friend who's name starts with a G went to downtown ATL and got our hair done. I did meth for the 1st time that day. I enjoyed it a good bit. I can see how it can be crucialy addictive though, so i'se gots to stay away from it unless it's on a very distant occassion. It was fun. Thanks again fuck face. Jen's hair looks so pretty. It now ranges from a dark, redish pink to a light pink, to blond. It's awesome. I got plum colored tips on my newly forming dreadies. It was kind of half and half, some tips were plum, and some just a light blond. Today i died all the lighter ones pink though by myself. It looks really cool i think. It was really good to see Jes. She's doin good i guess. She thinks Aaron is cheating on her, but what else is new? She's in Oklahoma and he's in Georgia. There's the issue right there. Sorry sweety, I know that's gotta suck way bad. 

Me and Jake are kinda broken up. We haven't really broken up with each other, but he pissed me way too bad this week and the last. He didn't call me ONCE, not one time even to just fucking say hi, how are ya. Or, wow, i haven't seen you in 2 1/2 weeks, i kinda wanna see you. No, nothing, and when i called him for the last time to say Bye, it was like he didn't give one damn about talkin to me or that i was even around, so ya know what. FUCK HIM, and trust me, i would of liked to a little more,but that didn't happen ethier. I thought it was sweet though in a way, cuz he didn't want to use me or somethin. He was just so nice. He was goofy too, and it came semi natural to him. I'm pretty sure all the drugs he's done in his life kinda knocked out a good fewbrain cells that made him a little out there, but i liked him that way. I always pick the wierdest combinations of guys, but they all had one thing in common, they had no clue what i would of done for all of 'em, with the exception of Nick P., Adam, and Sean. I have a deep love for many things, and people are on the top of the list with family,jen jen, Jessica, and then the guy that wants to let me love him. I feel like such a fucking corn ball after writing that, but i guess it's how i feel, so i guess i'm a corn ball. 

I have to go in for my Applebees interview finally today at 3:00. I'm excited. I hope so bad that i get the job. I need the money so badly for a car, insurance, college fund, drugs, accessoris for my drugs, and yadda yadda yadaa. I hate money, but i like so many other things, that i need money to get them. What a kick up the anus. OUCH!!!

Whatever, Peace yall"

They must be setting up the place now or getting ready to. i wish i could be up there right now so bad, just to feel the atmosphere. The atmosphere last year was so awesome.  So many nice free loving people. So amazing, such a feeling. 
I don't think me and Jake are gonna last much longer. I mean, he's goin somewhere, probably California this fall. His opportunities keep on arising, which leave me here without him. It sucks and all, but we started knowin we were gonna end. It still sucks though. I wish i could see him more this summer. 
Oh God, Alabama is boring, but i guess any place would be boring if you don't know anyone. and i have no transportation. Soon my cutlass will have new tires. Dad said by the weekend and I'll be totally pimpin!!! I met one dude on the internet last night, but i'm eerie of meeting anyone off the internet. he seems cool enough, but that is what only seems to be. I'll figure it out. Oh well, i'm outta here.

We were chillin in the woods havin a jolly good 'ole time, and we went further. I grabbed him and we started makin out, he moved down south to check it out. He tasted me and was ready to see what i had to offer him. oh, i offered him a good bit. He was speechless, like a little baby with a mezmorizing toy. I'm his toy and he's my Joe blow!!! My pussy was yelpin for some action, so i looked at joe and asked him if he would like to have a sexual encounter with me, and he was all for it!!We were in the woods right behind some person's house. It was their back yard, and we had sex in it. When we were done, he was speechless. I got the idea that he enjoyed himself very much.  I would of liked him to be more forceful, but we still have to figure out each other's rhythums. We'll have some more practice hopefully tonight. He said he wanted to sneak in over here, and i told him he was quite welcome. And we'll have a blast!! Well, peace out livejournal land.  OOH, i made gooey ganja balls today!!"

1. dad                                   leaving jen jen

And there is new stuff to explore in    Bama Ala. I'm still a good bit nervous though. I mean, I'm totally changing my living setting. It's fucked up, but not fucked up enough to keep me here."

"event","Why does something bad always have to come with something good? Sometimes the good shines through more, but it seems like there is always a consequence to everything. Me and greg broke up about 2 weeks ago again; for good this time i'm pretty fucking certain.  It hurts bad even though i know in a way we weren't right for each other at that time. I really loved him and i gave him a lot of me, or as much as i could give him. i feel now like he just totally used me. i guess i used him in a way too, but i didn't even realize it til today. i just liked having sex so much. that was always the first thing on my mind when we were alone. we could have been so much more. a part of me wants to make me and him work out, but another part of me, a bigger part says there are more guys out there that are cute hippy boys with long dreaded hair. I want a cute hippie boy with long dreaded hair. Dread locks mell so good to me. i don't know, it's kinda wierd i guess for hair that hasn't been washed in a long time that is natted up in overgrown fur balls is appealing to my olfactory organs. oh well, such is life.  Oh yeah, bak to the ""main"" topic which is now transforming into my new ""main"" topic. I like Josh Mason. I've known his since like 7th grade. I liked him back in 8th grade, but it never happened cuz of that tramp tiffany, but oh well. I am really eerie of relationships right now, but i want to try cuz i do like him a good bit in that sort of way. i want to see if i can actually have a functional relationship, cuz i've never really had one. the closest was Nick, but all we ever did was make out and go to church functions, which wasn't bad, just not enough. i need to be telling josh these things.

Anyways, yesterday i was a dear. For a sociology project i dressed up like a dear and bud was the afroed out hockey playing crocodile deer hunter chasing me. We ran all around Oregon Park with Bud shooting me with a nintendo gun. It was a HOOT and a HOLLAR!!! So many people were like, what in the fuck's father is goin' on? And we got most of it on camera!! It'll be fun to present it. 

My mom is so pissing me off. She erased all my screen names off my buddy list for AIM. Now, i have no clue who anyone's name is. She is going to pay, oh yes, she will.SOON. Urgh, she makes me so mad. IT'S MY LIFE and no matter what you try to stop me from doin, I'm just gonna do it ten times harder when i move out. That was directed to my mom. Bah. 

I really do hope Josh likes me in that sort of way. If not, hell, life goes on. But if he does, we could be havin some reall fun in due time.  But NO NO NO NO NO NO givin me out til the right time. I have no clue when the ""right time"" with anyone could be, but i'll know when it is when it happens. For one sure thing, it won't be the 1st time i meet someone... .  .Greg.  . ... I don't know if i really loved him or not. I don't know which is worse either, if idid or didn't. I miss him a lot though. I would miss him more if  he wasn't being such an ass. Screw him. i still want to talk to him though an straighten shit out.

As I cry, my feelings for you liquify
  I'm trying to get by,
But if i said i was, it would be a lie
  I love you so much
And i hate that we can't be together
  In my life, I am suffocated by metaphorical bad weather
I want to feel your arms around me
  I don't want to be this free
If it means you have to leave my love life
  And leave my mind with such pain and strife
We went on a ""break"" to clear my mind,
  But now, I'm more confused and blind
I need your love, I need you here
  I can't have you disappear
Not right now, i need you too intensely
  If you think i'm wrong, please correct me.
I want to know how you feel
  How you cope and how you deal
With things such as this
  When you want me but you can't kiss
What goes through your mind when you think
  When you feel like you've lost your missing link?
That's all i ever wanted to know, and now it's too late
  but maybe it can still work, maybe it will be our fate

That was about Greg. I wrote it when we broke up for that one day. Now everything is cool. 

I'm going to Bonnaroo!!!! That makes me so so so so so happy. When i was there last year, that was the best time in my life. The atmosphere was so peaceful, the people were awesome, and the music expanded my horizon. I can't wait for June 13. That is the first day of the 2nd annual bonnaroo music festival. I will go every year. oh yes, i will.

Last night, irony hit me. Some dude imme and we started talkin. I e-mailed him my pic and it turned out to be Big Joe. It's a small world. We started talkin and that's about it. i thought it was cool. He's friends with Greg. 
I do love Greg. He makes me happy and all. Just for some reason sometimes i get so damned quiet around his friends. Mostly at Peter and Lindseys house. I have no fucking reason why. It just happens. I do like going over there though. 
Valentines day was kind of a bummer. i really wanted some of the day to be just me and greg, but that's not how it worked out. My mom actually let me go to the concert for a little while. That sucked too though.Not the music, but I got shoved down by moshers, and i guess hit my head hard. A little while later i passed out twice. i didn't get to enjoy the concert really. Greg was nice about it. He sat with me, but he was really fuckin quiet the whole time. All he did was just sit there. That's all i did too, but i just couldn't think of anything to say, but sorry.i know he wanted to go see the show,an all. I felt like i was being an inconvience to him. I hated feeling like that. I'm starting to think we aren't as perfect for each other as i thought we were. i guess no two people are really perfect for each other though. I have a lot on my mind right now about this, but i can't come to any conclusions."

"event","Merry Christmas everyone. It's a beautiful day here in Allbertville Alabama. It actually snowed earlier, but not enough to make an impact. For Christmas, i got a pair of shoes that go with my new mini skirt that Greg got me. They make me 3 inches taller. Now I'll be taller than Greg, he he. I got a lot of fabric to make this really cool dress and a funky pair of pants. I'm excited. I got a sewing machine from mom, so I'm set. I love Christams time so much. It's so nice to be with my dad and stepmom and brothers, even though Michael is really pissin' me off right now. He always has to hit me or slap me or some bullshit like that. I don't fucking like to be grabbed in the face and pushed around. I'd think he'd realize that by now. Othere than that, my brother is pretty cool. 
I'm kinda glad were goin home today. I'll hopefully get to see Greg and we can have our Christmas together. I got him this painting on velvet that says I Love You and has 2 shadows of people hugging and it even has flowers on it. It's really not too bad, but i think i went too far with it. It was a definant girly thing to do. I'm debating if i realy want to give it to him. I know he'll say he likes it, cuz i gave it to him, and i just know he would do that. I don't expect him to hang it up or anything. Actually, i kinda hope he doesn't for some reason. I really don't know why. oh well. I want to get him something else now. 
well, i have plenty of money now to send me on my way with birth control. All i have to do is get my ass to the clinic place. I am trying to think of a plan to tell my mom. She'd have a cow if she knew i was getting birth control. She would know that i was having sexual relations with Mr. Gregory then, and we can't have her knowing that. 
Well, i am going to go eat my Christmas lunch now, so adios.

"event","it's amazing how one sentence can completely change your mood. i can be so happy, and somebody has to open their mouth and  put such negativity in my tone. somebody told me that i had forgotten GOD. She couldn't of been any more wrong. it actually offended me. It also made me not want to go to church, and that's really bad. I honestly love going to church even if it's not a good church. I love to hear about God, i just hate it when people twist his great words to make them something they're not. And everyone does it, just some people to a greater extent than others. Just because i like to eat shrooms and smoke a little pot, it's like i have been excommunicated from from being able to worship my God. I know that isn't true, but some people have a perfect way of making a person feel like that. And i'm really thankful for the people that can overlook the things i do and realize that THERE IS MORE TO ME THAN DRUGS, SEX AND ROCK & ROLL. i don't do the things i do because i'm weak, i act upon what feels right inside, and what i want to do. And for one thing, shrooms are so not bad. Peoples minds have been poluted with some gov't bullshit abouth them, but they are so wonderful. Peoples minds also have been misled about God because of church, if you can dig it, which you should, cuz it's true. So many people's perceptions of God have been disiluisoned because of preachers talking about utter bullshit that isn't true. Not all preachers are like that, and some preachers make me want to dance in the miidle of a sermon because of how wonderful they are. People need to read the bible for themselves and figure out what they think about God. The bible can be interpreted so many millions of ways.  it's the way an indidual interprets God's messages that is the right way.  i think there are very few wrong ways to look at what God says and take it seriously. And, oh yeah, God does have a sense of humor. If he didn't, we wouldn't. i think he finds the human race hilarious honestly, but i know he loves us. Religion, it's a tricky thing. So many loopholes and too many people thinking they know the best way, when it's only the best way for themselves. Everyone is so different, that there are trillions of lifestyles to live. i have found my lifestyle that i want to stick with right now. I am happy. I truly belive that God just wants me to be happy. If he loves me as much as i think he does, which that is something i can't even begin to comprehend, then he wants me to do what i want. and i am going to do that. If he didn't want that,. he wouldn't of given us free though and minds to think, cuz if you don't do what makes you happy, then it's like someone is thinking for you, which would make you a sheep. BaaABaBBAaa..."

"event","Well, well, i am having a great day.  Yesterday my teacher MADE me go home from school, cuz i have pink eye.  It's super contageous or something.  Anyways, i have been out of school for 2 days and i'm not even really sick, and it's excused. 

Lately, life has been pretty boring other that Greg. My mom had MAJORLY been stressin' me out. I'm pretty sure i have been doing the same to her though. Her problem is, though, that she gets TOO stressed out TOO easily.  Greg earned major brownie points with my mom the other day.  He helped us unload about 60 cases of soda pop. It looked good.  He looked good, usin' all his muscles and all. He's really fine!! it's about time i got a really fine guy.  Anyways, back to the mom issues.  i know she is having major issues with letting go of me, her baby girl. I'm the last kid in the house, you would think she'd be glad to let go. Just another year and a half.  It doesn't seem like that long, but it is, oh yes, it is.  

One of my BEST friends, Jessica is fuckin' moving to Oklahoma. I don't even know where that is, but i know it's a good damn ways away. It's so crazy, cuz this came out of nowhere.  She's leaving me for two old wrinkley people that have to glue their dentures to their mouth each morning. They might have those cool old people buggies that go vroom though.  That would be tight.  If they have two, we could have races whenever i go up there.  Good plan, i think. She's goin' up there to get an education though. She can't read very well, and her grandparents can give her the attention she needs to learn. I'm really happy for her. And this gives me another reason to travel this summer. 

i love greg.  It's crazy, but it's true.  it's not even that crazy. at first, i couldn't really believe that Greg was who i was going out with.  i can't really explain it. Kind of like those too good to be true situations. But it is true. i just talked to him like 4 minutes ago. My second love. 2nd true love that is. i have had other dinky not real dilusioned loves that weren't serious. Tomorrow night we are going to a Frank Sinatra inpersonator at Diamond Dave's Bar. We got invited by Ron. We gonna be chillin with a bunch of old people that like to party.  I mean, 40-late 60's old.It'll be cool, i hope.
             Well, adios"

"event","Well, hello my livejournal.  Long time, no write.  Honestly right now, i feel like shit.  I have strep throat and some funky ear infection.  Plus, i am spitting the colors of the rainbow. I have red, orange, yellow, and green so far.  I am hoping for purple next.  i don't feel as bad as earlier though thanks to the good ol' Doc.  He gave me some nice medication.  It was kinda funny.  I went to my doctor's appointment all stoned and he starts givin' me advice about not smokin' marijuana.  It was funny.  And my mom was in the corner thinkin' oh, you don't have to warn her, she already smokes the jamaican herb.  oh yeah, let me tell the story of the mom and the marijuana.

It was this past Sunday, and i just got home.  My mother dearest is actin' kinda wierd and she pulls me in my room and shows me the infamous pot seeds in my jewelry box. I hate it when someone searches my room.  Anyways, i swear to her i don't smoke.  She goes to Curtis, the stepdad, and he tries to convince her that i am lying and i in fact smoke pot.  Well, she doesn't know who to believe and she goes a little crazy.  i go into curtis' rooma and tell him that he shouldn't be tellin my mom that i smoke, because for one, it'll just worry her, and he should know that i would just deny it, two, he should of come to me first and asked me if i smoked and i just might of told him the truth. Probably not, but who knows, cuz he never asked.  anyways, i find my mom and confess to smokin the good ol' grass. she is somewhat releaved, but also quite disapointed.  i am glad i told her though, so i don't really have to lie any more.  That's nice.  She thinks i buy pot from Dobson. What a hoot.  I have never seen pot that was in Dobson's possesion. I always smoke that fruitcake up after school.  It's fun though.  

I need money.  I have no money which means i can't buy pot which doesn't mean i can't get high, but still, i like having pot.  I like to smell it.  The sweet inviting scent of fresh dang nugs in a little plastic baggy, and sometimes in my film canister, but either way, it still smells the same. I could go on forever, but i can't, not tonight. 

Well, it's about do time for my monthly feminine cycle.  It should start any day now.  The wait is making me paranoid about being pregnant.  I was thinking about it though.  If i was pregnant, i think i would like it.  I just love the fact of having a baby of my own to raise. I of caourse don't really want one right now, seeing that i am only 16, with no money and im in high school, but if i did have one, i think it would be ok.  But knowing that i have those thoughts makes me even more paranoid, cuz my mind could be preparing me for the news of a fat belly.  maybe manana i will go steal me a pregnancy test.  Yes, that will do. That would suck for Greg.  We haven't been goin out for a month, and WHAM, he's a daddy.  For some reason i find this so hilarious.  i have weird urges to laugh my ass off right now.  I think it's cuz i'm sick, but still, that is kinda wierd, i think.  

Well, i'm gonna go watch some pointless tv now and think about alligator toes, so adios. Do alligators even have toes??"

"event","ok, i know it has been just about forever since i have written, but oh well. I just never realy think about writing. I should though. It might help me release som outdated anger or help me express how i feel. Either way, i never know when i will or wont write, so get over it.  

I have a few things that are of incredible importance to say.  #1: I AM NO LONGER A VIRGIN!!!. 
I will get back to that in a few.  #2: my mommy is REALLY pissing me off.  #3: I have once again snagged me a boyfriend!!!!YaY!!! 

Ok, me and greg have been going out for 2 weeks and one day. Or something like that.  Give or take a few days.  I'm not really sure what day we became""official"",but im guessing it's the day when we had sex.  Ooh  hoo hoo, that's a great story.  Let's take a flashback, shall we...
             -~-~-My mom went out of town, and Mud was babysitting me and he was throwing a party at his house.  We went to one of his friend's houses and chilled for a while, and when we left, his friend Greg came with us.  We got back to Mud's house and Jen and Jes came on over.  Jen had to leave, cuz her mom got all wierded out, which sucked bad.Jes stayed though, and we had some fun. We were all pretty plastered, i know i was.Anyways, me and greg hooked up and had sex in my brother's bed.  It was SOoOoOOOooooOOOOooO fun.-~-~-
I LOVE SEX.  God really knew what he was doing when he made our body parts.  Kudos to God!!! Thank You.  So, In my brother's bed. I love it, when i think of losing my virginity, i will think of my good brother Daniel, and how he left me his bed to go to Louisiana.  Thank you Daniel.With you, that couldn't of been possible.  

Well, i must go now. I am at school, and I am skipping BPE, because  that clas sucks very much, and i found a good way to skip. Yay for me.   Adio"

"event","ok, i am just so happy. Life is getting better and better by the day. Last night was the Allman Brothers concert and it was awesome. The band was way great. The lights and the atmosphere were so cool. Elizabeth came with me. She's really cool. I like her hair. it's long, blond, and stright. it just looks good on her i guess. Anyways me and elizabeth were sittin' with my dad, Carol(stepmom), Daniel(brother), and Monica(brother's g/f).Elizabeth whips out the herb and my dad spots it. I knew he'd be cool with it and all. We start smokin' and it was too awesome that me and my dad and stepmom and brother all smoked together. It blew my mind. And it was cool cuz it was the 1st time me and Elizaabeth ever hung out. It was a way special night. One that i will always remember. Tonight i got to talk to my dad about things i've always wanted to talk about. It was really great to get it out.  I just can't stop smiling. I am so happy to be me. I used to be depressed and shit because i really didn't like myself, but now i can't help to hide my happiness. I am at peace with myself and i love it. I wonder what tomorrow will bring.
  I have made a decision. I am not going to smoke cigarettes anymore. I was thinkin' about it last night. Really, all they are are cancer sticks. Ever since they became a trend, so many more people are dying of cancer and they play such a big role in that. So, yeah, i don't smoke the cigs anymore. I even talked to my dad about that. I told him that io smoked and i quit and it looked like he might actually concider quitting. I really hope he does. It really is a nasty habit. All it does is hurt your body. 
   Well, my mommy is comin' home tomorrow. I was in such peace when she was gone. I just got to be free and do my own thing without having to ask and it was way nice. But i guess every good thing has to come to an end. I'm sure not all good things though, but most. I guesss  i'm out of here now. 
                      Peace"

"event","well. i know i don't write very much, but now, i have more time. actually, i don't know, because i quit my job, but half the times i wrote in this, it was at work. So i am no longer an employee of the library. tough shit, huh?  Today was a good day, mostly.  I saw the crucible. That movie made me so upset. i can't beleive people were that fucking ignorant. i guess most of the people in this world are still as ignrant, but come on. They hung honest people and cheered about it. That Is FUCKING Horrible. i hate it. ok, that's enough anger. 
well, i have yet another crush. There is something different about this one though. I might actually have a chance with him. I know i talk about guys just about all the time, so im not gonna stop now. I have never had a real gut feeling about a guy. I never knew what to expect for one of those feelings. But somehow, i know i have one about this guy. i can't really describe it. i'm gonna try my damndest to though. No, i really can't explain it how i really feel it. Words pollute the feeling. AAAHHHHAAAAHHHAAAHHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAH. Why does my mind have to think about guys. Why can't i go ONE FUCKING DAY without thinking about a guy and how i like him. I have a shitload of maybes, BUT no definites. I want to tell him so so so so bad that i like him, but what if by chance the feeling i have for him is a hoax. What if i am trying to make myself feel that. Even though i am pretty sure i wouldn't put myself through that just to hurt myself. im not fucking retarted.  ok, i just need to get a grip on it. if i start writing about something else, my mind will follow.  Have you ever realized that your mind is like a dog. Bare with me here. When you are sane, and in ""society"", your mind is leashed up and you think about things you think you should be thinking about, but when you trip, your mind is unleashed. There ar eno limits, not even the sky. Cool!!! 
i am having a garage sale tomorrow. I gonna make some money. Hell yeah, so i can go supply me with my mind enhancers(pot, shrooms--i hope)yeah, whatever. oh well, i am out of here."

"event","well, hot damn it's been a long time since i have written. a few things have happened, maybe more since i wrote. well, first of all, i am so fuckin' excited about tonight. I am going over to Brandon Ferrara's house!! that's nowhere near the best part. I am gettin' some shrooms, i'm gonna be the only chick with 6 guys, and we are all sleepin' over, but were not gonna be sleepin'. Way too fucking cool. Brandon is so damn Hot too. I want his body, and oh yeah, i know he wants mine too. It was funny yesterday. We were packin' our shit together to walk out of class, when i stepped on my skirt, and it fell down to my knees. My ass was hangin' all out. At least i was wearing some cute panties. I thought no one saw, but then i told Brandon and he said he saw. My face, i could feel, was bright fuckin' red. 
School sucks. i hate getting up so early. It really sucks. i htonk my favorite class is BPE. i find it wierd, but i also found out that i like to run, so, whatever. Yeasterday, we walked on the nature trail, and it was so beautiful just looking at the trees. They were like our protection, a canopy watching over us. Last week, i was at Jen's and we, of course, were stoned, and we were looking at the trees and forming pictures out of them. I almost shit my pants, cuz i saw flying lassie. Afucking colley with bat wings. It was way cool. 

I'm gonna be shroomin'!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Well, adios everyone, and peace be with you all."

Well school starts morrow. In a way I am kind of ready, but i'll miss laying around all day. Today had been a good day to end the summer i guess. I just went to church, came home, layed around ALL day, went to church, came home, and layed around some more. I am watching Peter Pan right now. I am going to leave you with these accomplishments of mine for the day, starting with a story!! For the past week or so, I've been down about things like, school starting, and Nick, and friend issues, but today i overcame them. I had felt led astray from God, in my mind, but i didn't put my thoughts into actions. I felt kind of denied by God, but i knew i wasn't. Anyways, today at church, the sermon was like it was just for me. It seemed like the pastor was looking straight at me. The things he preached about, hit me hard. Now, i feel like i am renewed and ready to go to school. I have a goal for this year(other than getting Chase as my boyfriend)and that is to share God with people. I have struggles with this for some reason, but i am hoping to overcome that, and i felt like God was with me today saying that he's gonna help me with my fear. So, yay!! Now, adios."

"event","I'm at work right now, and i'm bored as hell. Even though i might not be that bored in hell. Oh well. Last night i was watching a Simon and Garfunkel concert from 1981. I have never really heard them before. I didn't even know it was them until their 4th song. I really like them . Their voices are so harmonized. And, there is something about Art Garfunkel that drew me to him. For some reason i found him to be one of the most attractive men i have ever seen. And his voice just added to his appeal. He's like super old though now. I want him. In my dreams i guess. Oh man, then i was goin' in my room, and there was this HUGE la cucaracha on my t.v. I ahte bugs, but i can't kill them. Mom and Curt were asleep, but i thought i would of woke them up with my screaming. Ko Ko came to my rescue though. I decided to take one for the team and kill it, but when i got close to it, the damn thing lunged at me. I went runnin' and screaming down the hall to escape from its rath, but i didn't know where it went. For about 10 minutes i stood in my kitchen starring in the hall to make sure he wasn't hiding and waiting for me. I was also paranoid that he was on me. I grabbed my cat for protection and went to my room. It was scarry. I hate bugs. Then i couldn't go to sleep, cuz i could of sworn it was gonna fly into my ear when i closed my eyes. If you have ever seen Broke Down Palace, you know what i mean. So i slept with a pillow over my head. 
YAY!!Today i am going to Six Flags with my little sister. I don't get to see her very much, so when i do, i get really excited. Oh well, i got to go do that work thing now."

"event","Oh, man, today is a beautiful day. I wish i could be out on a mountain hiking or somethin'. That'd be awesome. But, instead, i am inside, cleaning my room. All i have to do is put all my clothes away and make my bed though. But that is probably gonna take me a few hours. I always find something that reminds me of memories and i'll be stuck thinking about that for a long time. It usually takes me like 3 hours to clean my room. Also today, i get to practice my janitorial rights, by  cleaning my bathroom. that's not too bad either though. 
Yesterday,on my scale of days, was an 8. I went to work and i got to work with Alex. Oh yeah, i be macin' on him like a homie. ok, no, but yeah. Anyways, it was cool. We had more wierd things to talk about. This guy is mest up. He thinks death is not funny, but hillarious. But only if the person deserved to die. Horror movies, for him are like watching sit-coms. Sometime at work this little girl, her name was Emily came up to me and wanted me to read her a story. Of course, i was like, awe, of course. She was like 4 years old. She made me read about 4 different Cinderella stories. This chick is obsessed with Cinderella. It was cute though. Anyways, i came home and sat around for a long time. 
Jen came over around 5:00 i think and we went over to Kristin's house. These other people were there, i think it was, Stephanie, Lindsay, and Salone. Yeah, that's roght. Anyway, we were all gonna go out to eat at some Japanese resturaunt. These people are insanely goofy. Theye were celebrating some Japan rock star's birthday. They even made a cake for him. Can we say obsessed? But ya know, whatever floats your boat, or tickes your pickle. There are different stokes for different folks, i always say. oh well, it was aninteresting opportunity. On the way to the resturaunt, me and Jen had some fun with driving.. Jen wanted to flach Kristin and them, but she couldn't do it very well while driving, so we decided to switch places. Wehn we did, there was a cop 2 lanes away from us, so i told her to do it subtle like. Then all of a sudden, her head goes out my window, and her legs on my seat. Oh yeah, that was what i call subtle. It was great though. I wouldn't of wanted it any other way. She didn't get the chance to flash then though, yet. We ended up switching places again. We ran into some mexicans and Jen got her pic taken with them. She got to flash them as i took the wheel, and then everything was good again.
Then i slept over at Jen's house. It was too cool. We went over to my friend, Matt's house. I used to like Matt a while back, but i got over it. We never really saw each other that much. But last night, i think i started to like him again. NOOO!! I don't know if it's good, bad, or just hormones. Whatever. I ended up kissing him when we were about to leave. It was pretty damn cool. I grabbed his shirt and pulled him toward me and i kissed him. Jen said it was so hot. SHe wants to try it now. I wouln't mind trying it again myself, it was kinda fun. I don't really want a boyfriend right now though. I like to flirt, i think, but i know if that ""right"" guy comes along, i'll grab him too. Then , me and Jen went back to her house and we burned our bras. Yes, we burned our bras. It was fun too. We even toasted marshmellows with the fire coming off our bras. It was GREAT. We decided to retire right after we took some pics of our sight of burning bras, to a movie. I didn't even get past the first five minutes of it though."

"event","i worked today, abd there is this guy Brandon that works there, andOk,  i seriously want to rip of his penis and beat him insane with it. He is so anoying. He is ALWAYS coming up to me and badgering me. He's like one of those annoying puppies that if your nice to, it will suck all your energy out of you. Then one day, you can't stand it anymore and you kick it, hard. I don't think i would ever do that, but i'm sure some people might know what i am talking about. Anyways. My headache still hasn't gone away, and i feel like crap still, but i am, none the less in a good mood. Tomorrow i get to work with Alex. I like him and all, but i have no idea if he likes me or not. I'm not too worried about it though. This year, as my goal, i will have Chase Jackson as my hubbie. Oh my gosh, this guy is so fine. He has long, light brown hair, he isn't too skinny, but not chubby, he is so FINE. I want him. He will be mine. He wont be able to resist me. Yeah, whatever. He probably wont even notice me at all. Oh well, i can still try. YAY!Tomorrow me and Jn are gonna do somethin. I'm not quite sure what, but knowing us, it will be interesting. I wanted to go see Signs, but she and Emily went to see that tonight. They suck. They suck big, black, hairy cock. I reall yhope they don't though, cuz that might scare me a little.  you know i don't mean that Jen. Or do you? What a mystery, huh? Oh well, solve it later. I'm out. Peace"

"event","I'm not sure how a dolphin would feel if it were to take crack, but if i had to guess, i think it would have a MAJOR headache. And i have one insanely large headache. I've had it now for 24 hours+. It hurts and it SUCKS. It even sucks more, because i have to work tomorrow. Wippty Do. I have learned that excessive crying gives you massive headaches, and i'm pretty sure that's how mine started. Yesterday i cried a whole crap load, and that's when the headache started. I also mowed the whole lawn yeserday(nonstop) when it was like 20 billion degrees celcius. In a way i kind of like mowing the lawn. I, however, can't see the fun in it at this point in time. Anyways, enough complaining. Really, the only good news i have is that i got a new hirt today. It's plaid, a button up, w/ a collar. It's real cute. And it was only $3.67. Cool, huh? Oh well, i am gonna go to the sleep world now, so see ya in my dreams.................he he!!!"

"event","Today started out at 7:30 in the morning.  Way too early for work, but I dealt with it.  Work went by pretty quick, so it wasn't too bad.  I got home and it was a GREAT feeling. I love the first day you get home from being out of town for a long time. The smell of your house becomes new again, and you realize how good it smells.  Then my mom got home from Chicago.  It was good to see her. Her and my stepdad, Curtis, went to see my grandpa. He is very sick.  He has prostate cancer(butt cancer).  It's not too serious, but he has to get surgery to remove it.  He'll have to wear a diaper for a few weeks.  My grandpa is an independent person, so this will be tough for him.  He's taking it up the rear. Sorry, i had to make a little joke to make me laugh.  It sometimes helps to laugh when you feel hurt, even if you don't realize it.  Jessica called me.  It was good to hear her.  She sounded happy, her old self a little. She used to live in Cobb County, but moved to Douglasville a tear ago.  Ever since the move, she has gotten really depresed.  Her dad moved back in with them and he is such an asshole.  He's a drunken ass, which is 38 times worse. I talked to her a few minutes ago, and her dad is up to his usual assholiness attaitude. Jess wanted Jen to come see her, but her dad thinks she's a lesbian, which she isn't.  She's bi, but he doesn't need to know that.  He wont let Jess have barely anything to do wih her, except when her brother talks her dad into it. I barely ever talkto her when she isn't crying or about to cry, or just in a really depressed state of mind.  I hate to see her like this, especially when i have no way to get to her in a hurry if i need to. I couls really get into this, but it will take up so much, and i probably couldn't write that much if i tried.  I love her so much, she is my best friend, her and Jennifer.  I known them longer than i've ever known anyone, and actually kept in touch with them.  Usually i lose friends pretty easily, and it's hard for me to trust people.  And without trust, it's hard to build a lasting friendship.  But Jen and Jes have been there for me, Jen especially.  We've all been through some tough crap. We will always be friends no matter what.  Merry Christmas everyone.  Yes, it is CHristmas....Christmas in July. I'll write later."

It was good to see her. Her and my stepdad, Curtis, went to see my grandpa. He is very sick.  He has prostate cancer(butt cancer).  It's not too serious, but he has to get surgery to remove it.  He'll have to wear a diaper for a few weeks.  My grandpa is an independent person, so this will be tough for him.  He's taking it up the rear. Sorry, i had to make a little joke to make me laugh.  It sometimes helps to laugh when you feel hurt, even if you don't realize it.  Jessica called me.  It was good to hear her.  She sounded happy, her old self a little. She used to live in Cobb County, but moved to Douglasville a tear ago.  Ever since the move, she has gotten really depresed.  Her dad moved back in with them and he is such an asshole.  He's a drunken ass, which is 38 times worse. I talked to her a few minutes ago, and her dad is up to his usual assholiness attaitude. Jess wanted Jen to come see her, but her dad thinks she's a lesbian, which she isn't.  She's bi, but he doesn't need to know that.  He wont let Jess have barely anything to do wih her, except when her brother talks her dad into it. I barely ever talkto her when she isn't crying or about to cry, or just in a really depressed state of mind.  I hate to see her like this, especially when i have no way to get to her in a hurry if i need to. I couls really get into this, but it will take up so much, and i probably couldn't write that much if i tried.  I love her so much, she is my best friend, her and Jennifer.  I known them longer than i've ever known anyone, and actually kept in touch with them.  Usually i lose friends pretty easily, and it's hard for me to trust people.  And without trust, it's hard to build a lasting friendship.  But Jen and Jes have been there for me, Jen especially.  We've all been through some tough crap. We will always be friends no matter what.  Merry Christmas everyone.  Yes, it is CHristmas....Christmas in July. I'll write later."

It sometimes helps to laugh when you feel hurt, even if you don't realize it.  Jessica called me.  It was good to hear her.  She sounded happy, her old self a little. She used to live in Cobb County, but moved to Douglasville a tear ago.  Ever since the move, she has gotten really depresed.  Her dad moved back in with them and he is such an asshole.  He's a drunken ass, which is 38 times worse. I talked to her a few minutes ago, and her dad is up to his usual assholiness attaitude. Jess wanted Jen to come see her, but her dad thinks she's a lesbian, which she isn't.  She's bi, but he doesn't need to know that.  He wont let Jess have barely anything to do wih her, except when her brother talks her dad into it. I barely ever talkto her when she isn't crying or about to cry, or just in a really depressed state of mind.  I hate to see her like this, especially when i have no way to get to her in a hurry if i need to. I couls really get into this, but it will tak up so much, and i probably couldn't write that much if i tried.  I love her so much, she is my best friend, her and Jennifer.  I known them longer than i've ever known anyone, and actually kept in touch with them.  Usually i lose friends pretty easily, and it's hard for me to trust people.  And without trust, it's hard to build a lasting friendship.  But Jen and Jes have been there for me, Jen especially.  We've all been through some tough crap. We will always be friends no matter what.  Merry Christmas everyone.  Yes, it is CHristmas....Christmas in July. I'll write later."

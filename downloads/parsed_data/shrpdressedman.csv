This was a great time.  After buying our copy of Harry Potter at its midnight release, Me, Ian, Jocelyn, Anne Roberta, and Tommy decided to fetch some taco bell.  Well the main part of the restaurant was closed, but the drive thru was still running.  So we had food. BUT WHERE TO EAT IT?!?! The answer, of course was the middle of a deserted parking lot.  I brought a blanket out of my trunk and luckily had my camera, so this memorable moment was immortalized in all its digital splendor! 

This has been truly one of the best summers i've ever had and it still ain't over and there's still so much to do.  Anybody feeling bored and wants to do something, give me a call and most likely I'll join ya.(That is if i'm free, I ""work"" alot)

Finally a quick update on my situation status-wise: I leave for vacation tomorrow morning. Virginia Beach or Bust! I'm searching for a place to work while i go to college, hoping for a computer based jobs.  I start college on the 29th.  PSU Altoona is going to regret accepting me. They gave me another scholarship that cut the money i have to borrow in half, which is a real sigh of relief for me.  Well i got to go to bed.  Night folks."

"event","Well It truly has been a long time since I updated.  Alot's happened since the last one.  Prom, Graduation, Senior Trip, among other things.  It has truly been hectic.  But I liked it so all's well.  Prom kicked ass.  Me and Ian tore up the dance floor, tho Ian did more than me.  I wore my top hat the entire evening.  upon our return to steven's house Ian did a striptease for me, chris, and chris's mommy.  We all thought he was high but I'd been with him the whole time and he didn't have anything that i could see.  plus I'd be mad at him for not sharing.  I didn't go to bed that night.  At all.  I finally crashed at 4 pm then next day.  Except for about an hour when i got up to get something to eat, i slept clean through till morning. And that ended that adventure

Senior trip was pretty darn good except for the sidewinder roller coaster dislodging my intestines.  I didn't feel to good after that coaster.  but then we got on the storm runner and everything was shoved back into place by accelerating to 60 mile and hour in 2 seconds flat.  I hung out with Ian, Sarah and Ashley.  We rode 4 roller coasters.  The best rides were The Great Bear and the Storm Runner.  

Graduation was it's usual memorable self, including silly string, confetti cannons, and pictures.  I hit chris with and shuruken graduation cap and gave Steph a hug so hard her hat fell off.  The only down side is that I was so hot there that i was drenched in sweat by the time i got home.

Well, while brief that completes the updates on the major events of the past time.  Except my graduation party.  but i'll save that for another time.  Or when you decide to talk to me in person.  Just one more thing to tell you.  I gave Nikita this new chemical and now she feels so good to be in.  I just wish i could be in her all the time.  Nikita's my car and I recharged her A/C so now it actually works.  YAYNESS!

On an angrier note, I've actually been studying.  Not that studying makes me angry, it the fact that i have two, count'em two chemistry finals.  I don't know what go into her head, or crawled up her butt and died, but it's ticking me off.  Finals suck.  If you have an 87% or higher in Cambria Heights you don't have to takem.  Our school system is so f'd up it's ridiculous.  

GERMAN TRIP TO BUCSH GARDENS!!! SWEET FRIGGEN BIPPIES!!!  In spite of the incredible unpleasanness that are finals, the last week and a half of school should be kicken.  It makes me happy.

My sister graduated from college with her bachelors.  good.  not much of more of her yelling at me that she needs to study and complaining about my music.  That aside, I'm proud of her.  Don't tell her that.  But she graduated Magna Cumme Laude which she means she kept a 3.7 GPA throughout her 4 years of college. Impressive, and it sets the bar high for me though.  I'll have to aim for summa cumme laude with an honors program graduation to beat her.  grr. more BLOODY WORK.

It's a little later than is was earlier... (I'll give you a few seconds to work out that sentence...three...two...one...OK?)  As I was unable to complete my last entry i figured i would finish it in this one.

Saturday night I watched the movie ""The Girl Next Door""  It was quite good... Funny, a little corny at times, and, surprisingly, kinda deep.  It had a number of useful morals woven into the story line, like... 

1. Never talk a porn producer's girls out of doing their movies unless you are willing to pay the price.
2. Never take pills from said porn producer.
3. Never watch a girl change clothes through their window unless you are willing to strip down in the middle of the street.
4. Never steal a penis-shaped trophy out of a porn producers house.

There were other morals from the movie but i feel that these are the most important.  I recommend it to anyone who is not offended by topless girls, a completely sex oriented movie, or foul language.

In all truth what i was talking about is college.  To my disappointment i will be heading to Penn State come fall.  Not that Penn State is not a great school, but i much preferred VT's program.  However VT was far to expensive.  They wanted an incredible 31,000 to attend, which is quite high for a state school.  

So all in all I was rather depressed lately.  Calc also had me down cuz i... well i fell asleep during a lesson and could not figure out wat we were working on for 3 days.  More frustration.  Now that my plans are cemented in however, i can begin to look forward to the summer.  However I find myself wanting last summer back.  Great things happened last summer... 

Enough of my reminiscing.  I know it's disgusting you.  Wipe the puke off your chin and change your shirt.  Burn the old one.  Eventually I'm going to include a test to see how much of a procrastinator you are - If i ever get around to making it... I'll start tomorrow...

Wow... For such a long time without any posts, this certainly has been a long one.  For me anyway.  Well that's the end of that.  The Epic Battle of the bands is set to take place tommorrow so I expect and upswing in my temperament.

"event","I wise man once said ""If everything is going ur way you obviously don't know what the hell is going on""  And it seems to be striking true.  The sweet deal i got on a computer could be turning sour.  The screen is messed up. And it'll cost a pretty penny to fix it.  So i don't know what I'm gonna do with it.  Just trying to keep you updated.  Anyway, How do you like my pictures?  Nothing like flaming farts.  I also have a pic of the infamous sniper kitty.  I love that pic.  

HAHA.. I'm watching tv while I'm making this entry.  It showed this tennis match.  They were volleying back and forth and a bird flew in the way.  The ball pegged the bird and killed it.  MUHAHAHA It was hilarious

Man who drop watch in toilet have shitty time."

"event","I'm sure many of my friends think i'm a spoiled brat, and for the most part, they are right.  But i just purchased a new portable computational device or a Laptop.  It's a sweet piece of machinery.  It already is making me wet. Yayness.  But anyway, enough of my bragging.  As for my old computer, my parents will receive it(Eventually, when i manage to fix.  I'll still be able to use it seeing as it's right down stairs.  The combination of the three computers that we have will make for some interesting Medal of Honor battles.

Other than that, today was still an alright day.  I spent most of it with my father, but it was still a good day.  No, no My father is cool-sometimes.  

Through my journal Entries I'll be feeding you information about myself.  My favorite TV show is MASH.  It's a 1970s tv show about the Korean War.  Although it doesn't sound like much, I enjoy it.  Anyway... Lava Lamps are cool.  And Black Lamps are fun too.  We have lots of work to do.  We're putting a new floor down in the kitchen  I have to fix my old computer, and move it down to the computer room.  I know you aren't interested in that but i told you anyway.  Other than that there's nothing new to report.  Farewell Folks.

P.S. My dog stopped licking himself."

"event","You should all be so proud of me.  Tonight was my first time.  It was wonderful.  The lights were low and there was a movie playing in the background.  It happened on the chair in my living room.  It was a little uncomfortable, but i didn't mind. I enjoyed it immensely.  I thought about it alot and decided to go ahead with it.  So i got my laptop and started this journal.  This was my first live journal.  What were you all thinking?

Yes my fellow internet addicts, have decided to join the millions of those who participate in internet blogging.  Fun fun.  

A little about my self.  I'm a chain smoking weekend transvestite with a habitual drinking problem.  No, not really.  Just occasionally I take a hit of some bad peruvian prayer hash and make up crazy stories or hallucinate the uber intelligent baboons are beating me at chess while forcing me to watch horrifying Janet Reno sex tapes.  I don't know why i keep doin dat hash.  Actually all that is BS to.  Sometimes I believe I'm a compulsive liar.  But then i just realized that is was because of my disconnection with reality because i can't believe bush got elected a second year.

But enough of my rambling.  You will find i do that alot on my entries, And i know you're looking forward to it.  Actually i don't know how often I'll actually be updating, but i'll try to as much as possible.  Anybody can comment on anything they want me to know about, or just im me at ChpSunGlasses05 (I'm zztop fan, Can ya tell?) My computer is currently on the fritz, and I'm on my sister's laptop.  I don't know why I told you that.  

One final note.  I am currently single.  I'm looking for someone, and have a few interests, but i doubt any of them know it.  I'm no good a dropping subtle hints.

For now that is all.
My dog is licking himself.  Thanks for listening to me ramble.  Farewell, for now"

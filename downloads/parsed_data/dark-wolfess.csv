"event","Ok... the sleepover was fun. Haven't seen those people in a short while so it was cool to all be together again. And then we all hung out the next day, well the girls did. Woohoo. Alot of funny stuff happened especially that guy thinking we were insane for being so crazy and not drunk/high. And the me and crissy talk while everyone was playing cards.

Then Saturday night I slept over Ian's and I was soo tired I fell asleep at like 11:30. Which was kinda funny. But I got to hear him and Dave play which was pretty decent. And we talked about how AJ is going to come visit and stay there. That still amuses me. But it's actually kinda good I guess that they are friends again. Cause then AJ could come visit ALOT! woot.

Roommate drama is annoying me. I dont know what is going on now. All I know is it better be fixed soon. Or I'll be angered.

this post was pretty uninformative and such. Oh well. Carly"

"event","Ok, this is weird and confusing but lately I've been feeling really strange. Like yesterday I said to Nicole that driving has been scaring me alot lately. I don't know why, nothing has happened to me while driving. It just makes me really nervous and I don't get it. 

Then, the other day with Crissy she said something to me about Ian. And since she said it, I've been thinking about it. About how true it is. But I've also been talking to him alot again. Mainly because he is on late at night like I am. But I've been thinking about what would happen if we got back together again. I can see it being a bad thing but maybe not. Maybe it would work out differently. 

Then again, maybe not getting any sleep lately is driving me alittle cooky. 

The other thing is, I feel like I can't talk to anyone about anything thats going on anymore. It's not that I think you guys won't listen. I don't even know WHY I feel that way. I guess it's like I said before about disappointing people and changing. I don't know.

alright, thats all. Carly"

I went to bed at like 4:30 last night and then I get a call at 6AM by a fricken DRUNK ian begging me to come pick him up and give him a ride home or he will drive home drunk and crash. So being the nice person I am I drag my ass out of bed and drive 45 minutes to go pick him up. That annoyed me. So I didnt do anything at all today. Which didnt bother me cause I didn't go back to sleep when I got home. But I talked to Scoot* all day and night practically. I don't know I really like him. We are on the same page it seems. I get to baby-sit tommorow. I'm excited to make some money finally!

I don't really understand what just happened in the past five minutes so maybe thats why I'm babbling about it. I feel like its my fault. 

Also- for the sleep over girls... I'm not so sure if I'm going to be in on the little plan but I would be more than happy to help you out. If it's when you guys said you wanted to have it at the movies AJ wouldnt be able to come that early and there really isnt anyone else I would want to bring.

Even though I've been around him the whole time he was here I've been so lonely. Maybe it's just me but I just don't get the whole being happy feeling anymore. I guess there is just something wrong with me. I couldn't wait for summer to come, but I forgot how much school got me out of the house.

I mean I know I'm a piece of crap, an emotional piece of crap at that... but if I stay like this I won't be able to love anymore, not anyone. I can't say that I hate Ian because I dont, I just hate being hurt. I thought I could take it cause even though I don't seem it I am a pretty strong person or atleast act that way. I used to hate acting like I was happy but now it just happens naturally, I could be exploding from the inside and I would look like I was the happiest person in the world, and I could be.

Tonight was interesting, just got my mind off of Ian alot. Being around people of course helps. I met 2 new people too. Mike and Melissa. They were nice people. They made me have fun. And of course hanging out with Crissy is always fun. (FEEL BETTER CRISSY- I <3 YOU)

I wanted to look at the stars, but it was cloudy. Stupid clouds got in my way. Next time I'm outside it better be clear and extremely starry. And I got this song im my head 'the stars aren't out tonight, but neither are we to look up at them, why does hello feel like goodbye?'

AJ-- I know you understand but I still feel bad, and when it all boils down, you only lust me. The girls up there are alot better cause you dont want this shit. 

I dont know, im in emotional-overdrive... looks like I'm not getting too much sleep tonight. I just think that I actually like my decision and will stick to it (if I don't someone better flip on me) Yea. *carly*

First me and Ian got in an accident awhile back and then last night I was driving with Ryan and we got in an accident. It was his (our) fault cause we went through the light just as it turned red but the other one shouldn't have turned green so quickly, there is usually alittle bit of a delay.  I didn't get hurt this time though being that we got hit in the back, but i do have a really bad headache cause i hit my head on the door, and they said I blacked out for like a minute which is no big deal.

I just generally didn't feel good today at all though. I don't know, my stomach hurt really bad and my head of course. Alot of people have like the flu and stuff at my school too though, so I might be getting sick in general. Plus I was so tired cause I didn't get home till like 2:00 and then I had to get up and be at school by 7:50 cause I can't afford to miss first period, plus we had a test that was going to count double today, just great. I think i did horribly on that.

I keep having these aweful nightmares and I don't know why. They are just really strange and I wake up about 1000 times so I am getting no sleep. I probably look like the walking dead, at least that's how I feel. I don't know. Its nothing that I can stop cause I've tried thinking 'happy thoughts', 'counting clouds' and just this relaxation thing and nothing works. I guess it's something internal that I have to figure out and deal with. 

And that's about it. *Carly*"

"event","I keep trying to get away from Ian but everytime it's just like I'm being drawn in by some force, but it's not what I want. Even though I would love to hook-up with someone right now, I don't want it to be him. And that's hard, fighting the urge to be with someone who you love (loved?). I'm one of those people that says that love never dies or goes away, if you love someone truely you can't just be like 'oh, i don't love them anymore' no matter how much you think it's true. Well, atleast that's how I feel. So anyone I've even feel in love with, I still love them, it's just that other aspects of the relationship didn't work. well, I dont know...

I kinda like someone else but not really. Well there is two people but one is turning 26 in 2 months and that's too old, for dating at least, hooking up..maybe. The other one, I don't know either, he's 16 which is no big deal really, but not really my type but I do like him alittle. I just want to occupy myself with other people right now so thats the reason or something like that.

Today, was a vow of silence thing today at school. It was good cause I didn't have to talk and also because it was just a good message. Some people were being jerks about it but most were supportive and understanding. Then at the end of the day we went outside to hear a speech and light candles. It was real sad too. And like I said it was good I didn't have to talk because then people couldn't ask me about stuff I didn't want to talk about. Cause my guidance counsler called me down yesterday to see if I was 'ok' cause some teacher supposedly thinks that there is something wrong in my life. There are alot of things but am I going to talk about them with my guidance counsler? I think not. 

Well here is a song that i like...It's Stars Hide Fire 'Fold'

The emptiness of your voice
Still Echoes clear
You warned me once again
I refused, to listen
Decided for myself
That this was everything I felt

This is all I have to give
This is what I'm living with
The hate, the games
The lies, the pain
The never knowing why
On lonely nights, I still fall asleep (fall asleep)
Without you (without you) I fold

As I sit here distorting my reality
I search hours for answers
And I can't remember
What it felt like before you
Without you I fold

I refuse to answer your questions, I won't break down
Just leave me here I can find my way, I can do this by myself

Everyday I still wake up next to you:
On lonely nights I still fall asleep (fall asleep)
Without you I fold

"event","Well, last night was our prom but i didn't go. So afterwards Laura came and picked me up and me, her, jeff (her b/f) and Damian (his brother) all went to the beach. Damian is like 25 but he's crazy as hell. We went to Point Pleasant and just walked on the boardwalk and the beach and then we stayed at a hotel. They paid for it and then the guys went to get some alcohol so Laura told me about all the 'drama' at the prom. Sounds like it was pretty crazy.Then I got home about 4:00 today and did nothing really. 

But tommorow me and Laura are going to Great Adventure I think... I can't wait cause I haven't been there in a while. Friday I'm going to Dorney Park for school. yay.

So.. thats it.. there are like 10 more full days of school or something like that. I didn't go on Friday cause.. i did other things :)  I talked to Ian on the phone but I really think I am getting over him ALOT. Which is a good thing, i think. Oh well...sounds good to me.  *Carly*"

I'm talking girls and guys with mohawks (some with real tall ones at that) and crazy piercings and tattoos. Very very interesting, they were alot of fun though. I figured they would be.

Why does it have to be a game from day to day to figure out your mood, to figure out what you want? Why can't you just love me or hate me and leave it at that? I hate all of the in between but I can't live without the times when things are good. What am I to do? 

People keep bugging me to go to the prom but.. i dont want to. It's just that I don't like to dance so really what is the point. No I won't regret not going, I have other memories plus high school wasn't my favorite place so it's no big deal to me. Oh well.

by Armor For Sleep 

It's funny how, Things work out
The ones we need, don't know we're there
If I were sand, and you were oceans
The moon would be, why you're pulled to me

I wake asking, Dreams are real?
I sleep so I don't have to feel,
The truth that you can never be
The one person that won't ever forget me.

I hope that dreams, come when I die
So we can talk, I won't wake up
I'll ask you how, your life worked out,
I'll never know, that I'm just dreaming.

I wake hoping,  and think Dreams are real.
I sleep so I don't have to feel,
The truth that you can never be
The one person that won't ever forget me.

Let me sleep some more (12x)

That is a good song.. i like it.. i like them in general-- thanks Jeff! 

This week will be hell being that we had no school last week and now back to a FULL week. But just this week and next week and then every other week I have atleast one day that I don't have to be in school! Which is awesome. My mood is strange today and I've been talking about some people about like the stuff i've been through so I guess that's why. I'm like happy and sad at the same time, yes it is possible.

I walked through the park for a long time today. It is like major stress relief. And right now I really don't have anywhere to go because no more running to Ian. He called today.. it was wierd and pointless and I wasnt really even listening. i have to forget him because I do so I will. And that's about it.So I'm done. *Carly*"

It's like your being pulled at and ripped from the inside and it is no fun. Today was ok but I pretty much wanted to cry the entire time. It's like I can't be friends with him and I just can't bear to be more than friends because it hurts so bad. As they say seeing is believing and actually seeing evidence of what had happened made it more real and much worse than finding out by words. So I will continue to be clueless and confused until I either move on or forgive him, one will eventually happen... I hope. I just hate being sad. And I hate being alone. If I am with him atleast I am not alone. Its also hard knowing that if he has gone to others for pleasure I must be doing something wrong. That sucks. Even though he said that's not it. I am just ugly I pressume. So why does he want me back? So he can have me and other girls all at once? I think he enjoys knowing I cry over him. I don't know. I'm done thinking. *Carly*"

I just cant wait to not have to go to high school anymore because it is way too early and I am just done with that place.  

I STILL need a job, even though it's been less than a week I can't sit around anymore.  I've gone from being super busy and not knowing what to do first, to having absolutely NOTHING to do. I really hate Ian and I just wish that he would stop calling no matter how much it hurts to ignore his calls I can ignore most of them.  Just as long as I don't have to see him I will be ok, i swear. 

I just don't understand what is so bad about just being with me, I'm not a horrible person or anything like that, I'm just me and it bothers me that he says 'i love you' and still can go right ahead and crush me. I don't want to rant about him though because it will just make me sadder and want to go back to him so I will stop.

I have some people that I have to call and catch up with anyway so I will get to that, tommorow maybe.  I don't know, I will think about it tommorow, day by day I wil figure this out.  I can't wait to move out of my house and meet some 'different' people. 

Alright I am all finished for tonight.. -*Carly*-

"event","It really is awful when the one person that you want you know in your brain that you can't really have them.  And then the other person you were almost positive you could spend your life with breaks your heart, more than once. I am going through withdrawal from guys, I didnt think that it was possible in such a short time but it is. I'm going to the doctors friday for all of you who know whats going on in my life right now.  I hope that everything is NORMAL because I don't need one more bit of stress.  

I need something to occupy my time but I don't have anything so yea, I'll just sulk. I applied a few places today so hopefully I will find a new job soon, I need to work, sitting around is no fun.  

That's about enough complaining for now,

"event","I don't know what to do, I'm confused ... AGAIN.  There is just too much going on and im stressing about it all.  I don't know if involving anymore guys in my life is such a good idea right now.  Maybe I should just stay single, not forever but just for right now because it's just too confusing and winds up depressing. Oh well, hopefully it will all work out fine in the end.

"event","I really hate being accused of something I didn't do.  I go into work yesterday and they tell me it was $75 short and that me and the other girl working are going to have to pay for it.  Yet they go on to tell me that I'm one of the best employees and all this other crap, it really pissed me off.  I mean I'm not stupid enough to take $75 and think that they wouldn't notice.  Plus today is the first day of the viewing for Brian. Tomorrow they want me to read my poem, I'm alittle nervous about that.  Luckily Ian was there with me today because I almost collapsed at one point and we are going back later.  These past few weeks have been hell and I dont know if I'm going to make it through the next day anymore..."

If you are able to come to this show, it would mean the world to me if you did, as it will be my last show playing with Kenotia. I don't want to go into details here, but you can talk to me or whatev if you want. I still love everyone in the band and will support them 100%. Word.

Also, if anyone wants to hook me up with a job, that'd be tiiight. Thanks!

Anyway, tour was amazing. It seemed like everything that could go wrong certainly did, but that entire tour package is family now. I love them all to death, and you should check them out.

Then I got my grillll cleaned on Thursday. I'm so beautiful.

Had a really good birthday yesterday. Thanks to everyone who was a part of it in one way or another, I love you niggas!

Then today the Caspian full-length came in the mail. I wasn't expecting it for at least another week because it's not officially released until the 10th... so I shit all over the walls. It's so good!!! Driving instrumental ambient rock at its absolute finest. They put Explosions In the Sky to shame, in my opinion, especially when I want something that'll hold my attention. Gaddamn!

Lots of chillin tonight with muh crackas. Holla!

I don't think that's fully registered in my head yet... but what has registered has me damn excited! It's been too long since we've played a show due to illness and jackass venues... It's driving me nuts, but I'll survive.. once we're out of the studio.. just drive and play every day.

By the way, I made the greatest playlist today. 83 songs the pump me up big time. I'll never listen to anything else ever again.

I set up my drums in my garage for the first time in forever (as they're constantly in transit) a few days ago and played for hours. It felt so good. Did the same the next day. I can't wait for Andy to get his own set so I won't have to keep breaking mine down and setting it back up. I've missed playing.

I've been eating a lot better recently and getting more exercise and stuff. I think it started when I watched Super-Size Me, haha. Either way, I'm down a notch on the ol' belt, and I'm pretty happy about that. Ya heard? Tim's gettin sexy! Woo!

We finally tried out a drummer who looks promising. I miss playing shows so much. I was kind of missing Todd too (as a friend), but any hopes I had of ever being cool with him again are long gone. I called him and left him three voicemails last week asking him if I could get my cymbals and hardware back from him. I came home from work a few nights ago (the night it was storming a bit) and it was all sitting there dumped on my front porch. What a fucking bitch.

I hear Craig is coming up sometime in the near future, and since I've actually some spare bucks, I should be getting some ink when that happens. UA!

Tomorrow is my last night at Zaxby's. Two-week notices suck. Longest two weeks of my life. So after tomorrow I'll actually be available to do shit in the evening more than twice a week! No, I will not get out of town.

And after several months of being too blind and retarded to see what was right in front of me, I have a girlfriend named Lucy. Thankfully she's not holding my stupidity against me, and she's pretty awesome for many other reasons.

I haven't had this much to update about in almost three years."

I drank a Vault right after work, and I'm wide-eyed at 3:30AM.

I think tomorrow I'll be going to my dad's house to make ready my old room for my return. Within the next week or two I'll be back there.. It'll be nice to be away from this responsibility. No offense to BDP, who made living here much more wonderful the past several months. It was just never easy to call this place home, or a home. Too many shitty memories make it hard to feel warmth for this place.

After working there, band practice. I had fun in the studio, but not having practice drives me nuts. I have to have it. Playing shows is awesome too. We have one on Friday in Douglasville and one on Saturday at Swayze's again.

Oh yeah, I took a half-gallon of orange juice to work tonight, put a good dent in it. It was divine.

Then Killer came home around 1. He went out over a week ago. He loves camping. Came back mighty hungry though, and he's got a dime-sized wound near his tail. I bet he kicked that bear's ass though. Killer is a badass and I love him.

It's getting close to 4. I should sleep. I'll finish my book first though. I'm about thirty pages from my second complete trip through the Harry Potter series.

"event","I haven't posted in a while about much of anything other than Kenotia because everything else hasn't been as great and I know nobody wants to read my bitching. This means this post is good news.

It's almost safe for my friends to come over to my apartment again. I can't wait. The place is finally getting clean AND STAYING that way, BobbyDP moves in Monday, Kenotia leaves Wednesday for FLAlorida with Love Takes Flight... other things going on making everything way too busy for me, but it's all great, and I love it.

Somehow I managed to get 3 Bs and an A this semester. I can't believe it. I was completely stressed about my grades and I was sure for some time that I'd be losing HOPE. 3.44, slutbag! Not being stressed out about school rules.

Haven't had huge crowds the last two nights, but every show a blast.

Finally feeling like myself again."

I'll either see you there or never speak to you again, just kidding I love you. Rock over London, rock on Chicago. Diet Pepsi: Uh-huh!"

"event","I took Killer to his follow-up appointment at the vet (his tail was dislocated), and they said he's making a great recovery. That was awesome news.

And last night I dreamt I was drumming for Through the Eyes of the Dead and pulled off all of the insane double bass rolls and shit. It was tight as all get out.

Only two years as of today. It'll feel like five.

I can't wait until school is out so I can Kenotia 110%.

In other news, I came kind of close to getting arrested yesterday, but I'm over it, and I love this weekend."

"event","Not a great week. The weekend should be good though, starting tomorrow as soon as I'm through with the test in my digital class. As soon as I buy a new cab and maybe save up a little for some ink, I'm thinking I'll quit my job so I can have time to do homework and make it easier to have more/longer band practices. Kinda sucks 'cause I like this job and I felt like a bum before I had it. Oh well. Anyway.

To the important shit. I'm looking for a good bass cab. Preferably an Ampeg 8x10, but I'll look into whatever you've got, just as long as it's loud enough and doesn't sound like an old man taking a crap (ie my current cab). So holla.

Until next month probably. You bastards take care."

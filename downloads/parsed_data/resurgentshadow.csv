"event","Well, saw Sarah Mclachlan last night - She was fantasic!  Butterfly Boucher was supporting and although i'd only heard a couple of her songs previous to last night she totally converted me to a fan.  Sarah played most of her new album and a selection of her most popular tracks, including a less clubby version of silence which was great.  It was my first time in the Royal Albert Hall too so that was quite an experience, it was HUGE!  Totally built for it's acoustics no doubt, it really was quite an impressive building.  Didn't get home till just after 1.30 so i was pretty tired trying to rise from my bed this morning.  Still it's saturday tomorrow so i have a lie-in to look forward to.

Just saw Alien Vs. Predator - very cool!  I wasn't expecting it to be that good but it really was a bit of a rollercoaster ride, i was almost dissapointed that it finished.  Got double Kickboxing in an hour, then i can relax infront of the tv for the evening for a well deserved rest :)"

"event","My god it rained hard last night,  I don't think i've ever seen rain come down like that.  Driving home from Kickboxing class was a very risky affair, the road was a total wash with water and visibility was noexistant.  Now all this coupled with the fact that i have a hole in my ceiling, right above my bed and you can guess where this is heading.  I got rained on, but not outside, inside, while sleeping, in my bed!!!  I guess i should have expected it but it slipped my mind before i went to bed.  I got one hell of a shock at 4am when i suddendly woke to the sound of rain bouncing off my head.  I really must get that fixed.

I'm going up to London later to see Sarah McLachlan at the Royal Albert Hall, really looking forward to it.  Got to get through the day first and unfortuatley it promises to be fairly unrelenting and busy.

Best get to it..."

Hmmm, now a double-bladed lightsaber is cool, but in pink!!!!

"event","I've had a real bad headache for the last four days, it's really irritating.  It's strange though, i wonder if i should be concerned, it's the first time it's ever happened.  I almost never get headaches :(

Finished watching Hellsing earlier, really enjoyed it although the ending was kinda random.  I think i read somewhere that the anime overtook the manga at some point and so they had to make up an ending for it.  That would explain the slight change of pace.  Think i may try and get hold of the soundtrack, it rocked!

Gotta drive to Oxford tomorrow, a friend of mine got caught on a speed camera there and unfortunately was on 9 points when it happened.  It means he's probably gonna loose his license but he has to go to a court hearing first.  It's rather irritating they make you go to the court in the town you were flashed in, it's 100 miles away!  I hope he gets off with a fine but i hear its not that common, i can't imagine what it would be like if i ever lost my license.

Been playing Fable on and off for the last few days, really top game.  I think it's the way you can evolve your charcter thats its best feature.  You get scars, have haircuts, grow beards, and there's 100's of items of clothing you can get.  Don't think its that long though, i have a feeling i'm nearing the end of it.

Had a real battle of wills with myself this morning trying to get up for the gym.  I made it in the end, but when its so cold outside it makes your bed that much more cosy.  Didn't help my headache one bit though, still at least i went."

"event","Given up with Wanadoo, gonna switch to another provider - probably AOL they have a pretty good package for unlimited 1mb. Does anyone know of any other good unlimited 1mb providers?

It really felt like winter this morning, cold crisp air - i was thinking, it really makes you appreciate a nice warm room. Winter has to be one of my favorite times of year.  The dark evenings and being all wrapped up inside my big jackets, hehe - it's kinda nice.

Our puppy went in to have her operation today.  She was looking very sorry for herself when she came out, and seemed to have developed a cough from having a tube down her throat.  Poor thing, she was curled up by the fire for most of the evening.  I'm sure she'll have perked up by tomorrow.

Managed to get hold of Fable at last, it's been sold out everywhere for nearly a week.  Hope it lives up to the hype.  I'll have some free time over the weekend to give it a real go but think i may have to hold of until then, work comes first.

Tickets for the Sarah McLachlan gig came through, 1 week to go, can't wait.  I managed to win some tickets to a private press gig she did about 6 months ago for the launch of her album.  Tiny venue, 100 or so press and fans.  She did about 6 songs, chatted for a bit then went - she was pretty jet lagged.  Been looking forward to the proper full on gig ever since. It'll also be the first time i've been in the Royal Albert Hall so that's kinda cool too.

Right, think i'll catch a couple of episdoes of Joey before bed (still not made my mind up about it)"

"event","I cannot believe how incompetent Wanadoo are! I've asked them on 4 separate occasions to upgrade my account from 512k to 1mb, i wait the 10 days and nothing. Everytime i call to say 'wtf!' they say 'we have no record of your order'. I could've screamed when it happened again this morning. I figured getting angry with the person at the other end of the phone is kinda unfair so i held my tongue.  I think i'll write a strongly worded letter to their complaints department instead, maybe i can blag some free stuff :)"

Not really achieved a whole hell of a lot yet again, although i have made a little progress in redesigning my journal - think i might put it up later. Got hold of the first few episodes of Joey earlier so maybe i'll watch those - could cheer me up, or, if they're awful could just irritate me.

Don't think i'm gonna go to my Wing Chun class tonight, somehow i just can't seem to motivate myself to go there anymore. This is something i wrestle with a lot.  I've been going for nearly two years now so to stop almost seems like a waste but i'm just not enjoying it as much as i used to. What with my Kickboxing classes and the gym going to Wing Chun aswell pretty much leaves me devoid of any free time. There are people i'm sure i've neglected who i really should get in touch with, maybe thats something to do tonight..."

It oh so very nearly lost it at the end and went all cheesy hollywood, but then just when you think it's getting predicable if throws in a HUGE curve ball, really awesome ending. Loved it, kinda reminded me of 'Seven'.

Guess that's the problem with working from home - noone to peer over your shoulder and check up on you. I suppose that's a good thing but when the work you do benefits yourself the only person being cheated is you.

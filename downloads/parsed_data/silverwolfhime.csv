SO Melissa stops to get me on her way back to the ""break room"" for her lunch and we go and sit down at one of the tables.  One of the other girls from up front gets up and goes to the vending machine to get potato chips and they got stuck.  She's like ""help me shake the machine."" lol  I can just imagine some customer walking by and seeing three of us girls shaking the vending machine screaming ""GIVE IT UP!"" and ""GIMME MY LUNCH!""   lol  ""Its okay...we work here."" =P~  Melissa pushes us back and is like ""What do you want?"" and mimes like she's busting the glass.

"event","On Sunday, Eddie Geurrerro Died.  He was one of the Best.  I will seriously miss him.  I was watching Monday night's wrestling, and Shawn Michaels was talking about him, and he said that they were both born again christians.  I threw my hands in the air went ""YESSSSS!"" lol  James looked at me with this smile on his face like ""yeah. Mmmhmm she's crazy."" lol  But I'm so happy to hear that.  He's in a better place, part of the host of angels watching over me when I pray. Love you, buddy.  You were one of the best.

So today I made a complete idiot of myself.  I'm not going to play the blame game, and make excuses.  It was my own fault.  Instead of speaking up and asking how we were going to work the cases into the Dissent, and link them to the Dissent, I just kept my mouth shut and went along with it.  Which was stupid anyway, because somehow I ended up kinda being the leader.  They kept asking me what to do and how to do this or that...I was just thinking, ""you're asking ME?  I'm just trying to keep my act together!""  So I got bereted for not linking the cases to the Dissent because I was the first one to list the cases and was humiliated in front of the whole class.  And I wasn't in my seat, either.  We were up facing the rest of the class, so I couldn't hide.  Well hopefully I learned my lesson.  

As we speak, I'm loading a picture to put on myspace.  I want to register to talk to Shane Helms, but I think I may miss him by the time it finishes.  Yeah. I missed him.  Dangit!  ah well.  Hopefully there will be other times.

So I've been doing a lot of thinking over the last year.  And recently I've been praying about it too.  I broke down and cried about it in church.  I feel kinda bad, and it was funny too.  Joe started talking to Mom and I about a day during the week when he thought about me.  He was in Waldenbooks and a girl came in asking about books on Firefighting.  She said she wanted to be a firefighter.  I told Joe that I was thinking about resigning.  And naturally he and my mom wanted to know why, and I was feeling emotional already, and holding that stuff in isn't good because eventually it comes out in bursts if you do that, and I was just like...well, this is me:
I pound my fist on my chair and I said ""because I just don't wanna be there anymore!"" (I kinda yelled at them, and I feel bad now...) and then I proceed to burst into tears.  Nikki came up and hugged me and held me while I cried.  She and I had talked about it before church, so she knew what I was going through.  I felt embarrassed because I started crying in front of so many people...urgh.  Whoever says people look cute when they cry never saw me cry. lol
Okay, this is the funny part.  While I burst into tears, Joe (who is a total non-confrontational person and gets nervous when people are paying attention to him) and mom were just stunned silent.  And Joe was like ""okay, now I feel bad for bringing it up...maybe this needed to come out though.""  It was just funny, I snorted and laugh/sobbed.  yeah...more embarrassment. heh.  And he asked my mom if she knew about this, and she didn't.  I hadn't talked to anyone but James about it before, and he kept telling me that I shouldn't.  I just dread calls.  I dread training.  The only thing I like about it is that I feel like the guys are my family.  I am going to talk to Chief about it, and see if I can just stay on as an ambulance driver.  Maybe either take a leave of absence, or just not be on the fire department anymore.  I just need to talk to him.  I've just...had enough.  I'm not angry with anyone.  I just...think I need to move on to other things.  I've been praying about it, and I haven't been getting a ""no"", so.  I feel kinda relieved now.  Like a pressure has been lifted.  Now that I've come to a decision.  Not all the way, because I still need to talk to Todd, but yeah.
I'm also changing my major.  To what yet, I don't know.  I just don't think law enforcement is for me.  Soooo I'm going to talk to a counselor to see what I can focus on.  I feel lost in limbo right now without a major to strive for...But I'm praying about all this, and it feels right.  -Aside from me not knowing what the heck to do now.
Some big changes, but I know that as long as God is with me, I'll be alright.  He is what remains constant and unchanging in this ever changing world, and I NEED something constant.  Because I was thinking about what all this was going to affect, and that ""whoa, this is big.""  But its not major.  I will find something to do with my life.  Why does time seem to be so short when you're hurried?  They shouldn't lie to you when you are in high school and tell you you have plenty of time.  Because you don't when you consider the pressure your family puts on you to find a career and become successful and fly on your own.

Well, I'm done yakking.  I'm hungry and some chocolates in the other room are calling my name.  Ta!"

Plus some christian bands have one too.  thats interesting. Its so cool to interact with the people you admire.

So...I don't know whether to be happy or really frustrated...I'm probably more frustrated than happy.  I spent ALL this MONEY for blankets for Ginger, and guess what.  She doesn't seem to be getting cold anymore.  We'll see, but so far everything is fine.  Not only did I spend money on blankets, but I spent money to get her stall more convenient for her and bought straw and everything.  BLARGH!!!!  *sigh*
Well, I'm hungry and I need to get ready for work.  I'm tired of school.  I don't know what to study for anymore.  I'm tired of the sameness of everyday these days.  My life seems to have run into a rut.  I need to back up and figure out where I'm supposed to go.  The thing that seems to bug me the most is I don't want to let my family down.

I've already got her the movie Ghost, and Bought her The Partridge Family Season One like she'd asked.  I'm hoping that Laverne and Shirley season two will come out before christmas.  I like that show.  I never saw it until I bought the first season for mom, and its really cute and funny.  She wants that and the Doris Day movie ""Send me no flowers"".  I also want to get her some saddle horn bags.  Something she doesn't know she's getting.

I've sketched a little.  I'm so proud of myself.  I feel like a little kid. lol  Mommy, can we put this on the fridge?  lol  I was just doodling shapes like the book says, and it turned out pretty good for the first time in six years.  Well, I doodled a horse at a fire meeting, so I guess I sketched something before this, but now I'm serious.  I want to get into it again.  Feel proud and accomplished and actually FINISH something.  So many things I want to do and feel so free to do them that I'm overwhelmed.  So many opportunities, God willing.

lol  Sorry, just had to poke fun at Eesheekins again. lol =P
heehee  hey, I felt left out.  lol

Soooooo...Whats been going on lately you ask?  Work.  School.  More Work. Friends.  Occasionally there's some sleep in there, and some food.  Insert wherever. Its been fun, though.  I feel like my life is full.  But I always am aware and watching that I don't take on too much.  ugh.  There's that saying that you can never have too many friends.  Well, whoever that was had no sense of time. lol ^_^  There just doesn't seem to be enough hours in the day sometimes.  GOOD NEWS though-I have tomorrow off!  YAY!  The last couple weeks on my days off, they asked me to fill shifts.  The only day I had off was Sunday, and those usually were full with church and getting things done that weren't done during the week.  ACK.

I had yesterday off too.  I slept in. hee ^_^  I copied the music cds for the ""stockings for the troops"", got my hair trimmed and styled, then came home and went for a good long ride.  I love my horsie.  I haven't gotten to ride her much lately. =(  Been so busy, and the darned days are getting shorter.  Haven't heard from Derek for a couple weeks.  *sigh*  The last time we were together, I asked him what he was working so hard for.  I don't think he got my question.  I ment what was he striving for?  He just never gets out and hangs out with friends.  Doesn't seem to relax or enjoy himself.  He's always so serious.  *sigh*  He only hangs out with me and sometimes Mike.  Rarely with Mike.  And if I didn't call him sometimes, he probably wouldn't even go with me.  URGH.  What a life.  Just work work work work and no play at all.  I told him he needed a freakin' Hobby.  Even if he got a dog that would be great.  Go out and walk the dog.

"event","""God never gives you more than you can handle""

True and false.  When you have confidence in God to help you handle things, he will give you what you can handle-with his help.  People always try to deal with things on their own.  Don't bother God with this, its okay, I can handle it...then later they fall apart because it turns into a juggling act because several things start happening at once.  
God CREATED this world and everything in it.  He conquered DEATH.  He heals the SICK.  He fed thousands of people from seven loaves of bread and several fish.  And you don't think he can fix your problems???  lol  All you have to do is ask. 
""Come to me, all of you who are weary and carry heavy burdens, and I will give you rest.  Take my yoke upon you.  Let me teach you, because I am humble and gentle, and you will find rest for your souls.  For my yoke fits perfectly, and the burden I give you is light.""
-Matthew 12:28-30

""Keep on asking, and you will be given what you ask for.  Keep on looking, and you will find.  Keep on knocking, and the door will be opened.  For everyone who asks, recieves.  Everyone who seeks, finds.  And the door is opened to everyone who knocks.  You parents--if your children ask for a loaf of bread, do you give them a stone instead?  Of course not!  If you sinful people know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly father give good gifts to those who ask him.""
--Matthew 7:7-11

I always called myself a christian.  But I was somewhat wrong.  I was saved, but I wasn't growing.  I accepted jesus as my savior, but I did nothing with it.  Its like I accepted someone as my friend, but then ignored them completely.  People love to say what God wants and what God says, but most of them are like I was.  They never consulted the Bible for what he truly wants.  No one likes someone to make assumptions for them of what they want.  If someone asked me if I wanted coffee and what flavor, I would get a little upset if someone who never got to know me answered for me.

""Then he called his disciples and the crowds to come over and listen. ""If any of you wants to be my follower,"" He told them,""You must put aside your selfish ambition, shoulder your cross, and follow me.  If you try to keep your life for yourself, you will lose it.  But if you give up your life for my sake and for the sake of the Good News, you will find true life.  And how do you benefit if you gain the whole world but lose your own soul in the process?  Is anything worth more than your soul?""""
--Mark 9:34-37

Satan came to Eve as a beautiful creature.  He persueids people with finery and THINGS.  So when someone seems to have it all, they really don't unless it is given to them by God, and they acknowledge that it was given to them by God, and that all the things they have truly belong to him.  The Creator.

I hope that sooths some souls, and gives unrest to those who need rescuing."

"event","I told you I would remember what I was going to say when I wasn't near a computer!  lol  
I was going to say that a few weeks ago, I asked Terri what I would have to do to become a manager.  She kinda gave me this look that said ""What took you so long?"" and ""I knew this would happen, it was only a matter of time.""  I've had several people at work walk up to me and ask me why I don't become a manager.  I don't really want that responsibility, I had told them.  Also, I don't plan on making this my career.  BUT...this could look good on a resume.  And experience is good.  The more skills I have, the more diverse I could be.  Hmmm.  Its still intimidating.  I am praying about this.

Also, lol...yesterday I went to see the Eye doctor.  The nurse and I went into this room with a machine, and it looked kinda familier.  I was like ""this isn't the machine that blows you in the eye, is it? lol  She laughed, and said ""No, we don't have that anymore, our technology has advanced.""  I was like Oh, thank God. lol  So we did that machine, then walked into another room where there was another machine.  She asked me some questions, and then she picks up this eye-dropper bottle, and says ""okay, now I'm going to put this numbing solution in your eyes.""  Now my imagination takes over, and I'm thinking:
Nurse: ""Okay, there is something so seriously wrong with your eyes, that we need to numb them and perform surgery right here and now.""
lol  I knew that was stupid, and it was a funny thing to think, so I listened to what exactly she was going to do next...Then she goes on to say ""We're going to numb your eyes, and we're going to take this prism, shine a light through it, and touch the prism to your eye.""  ... 0_0 ...What?  Because in MY mind, a prism is like a diamond shape-with a point.    SOOO Where's that blowing in your eye machine?  Do you have it in like, storage in back or something?  Can I sign a waver or something and opt to get blasted in the eye with air instead?  Please?  Pretty please?  And she goes ""you won't feel a thing.""  Yeah, well strangely that doesn't make me feel any better. lol  So she puts the solution in my eyes, and tells me not to blink.  So now I have the incredible urge to blink.  She gave up on the other eye because I kept blinking.  I examined the evil machine when she left, and found to my utter embarrassment for thinking such a thing that the ""prism"" was flat.  Duh.  Here's MY sign.  Within an hour and a half I got my eyes numbed twice (because it wears off fast), They dialated my eyes, then they gave me a reversing solution which later when I told James this story, he thought I said ""Chloroform"". lol ""Yeah, they chloroformed my eyes, and this one fell asleep, but this one was good.""  Oh we were laughing so hard the managers came and seperated us like children. lol =P

Also earlier we had eaten at Bob Evans for lunch, and as we were leaving, I was smelling the candles, and this one didn't want to open.  So instead of putting it back like a smart person, I pulled.  The lid popped off, flew out of my hand, and shattered on the floor.  I was SO embarrassed.  I couldn't say I was sorry enough.  Needless to say I won't be eating there for a while.  They probably won't even be working there anymore when I go back. heh heh. ^_^;

So I think that is about it...I could swear I have more to say, but...*sigh*

I have been so hungry for knowledge recently.  I want to take History classes, and Psychology classes.  I want to learn about the world and the people in it.  I have also been thirsty for the Word.
I bought myself a sketch book (because I couldn't find my old one. *sigh* and I had it all broken in too...lol) I'm trying to work up the courage to open it and sketch again.  I say this because I am so mercilessly critical of my work, that I don't even try anymore.  I defeat myself before I try.  I said these words last night about a completely unrelated topic, and now they hit me with resonance.  DUH.  Why don't we ever follow our own good advice?  Its like a personal rule, or something.  Here's MY sign. Duh.

Last Sunday after church, mom and I went to Matheissan to go riding.  She rode Star, and I knew it wouldn't be a good idea, but mom thought she could make it.  I kinda thought she could too when we got there, and she seemed energetic, and it was kinda cool out.  Well, she got hot.  And tired.  We stopped to let her rest several times.  Meanwhile, in the distance we hear thunder.  I didn't realize that the paths were so long until that day.  We didn't want Star to overheat and possibly have a heart attack, but we didn't want to get stuck in the storm, either.  Well, We got stuck in the thunderstorm.  It POURED.  We were in the trees, so we didn't get as wet as we could have...I thought it was a great adventure.  We stood under the canopy of trees as it poured.  I felt like a caravan, or a pioneer in the old western days when people traveled on horseback everywhere.  It made you wonder about peoples' lives back in the day.

Yeah, I had something else to write too, but I can't seem to remember it...*sigh*

I deleted the other entry because I just needed to start over and explain because the problem is that I didn't explain enough.  I didn't give the ""meat and potatos"" of the situation.  I just don't like to spend so much time in front of the computer anymore that I don't explain fully anymore and just rush through things in order to get off the computer because you can get on and spend HOURS in front of it and not realize it.  
When I was taking Yoga, our teacher explained that he had been suffering from anxiety, and he had found the source and trigger and when you find the source and trigger, it gets better.  I'm suffering from anxiety and when I said that I ""couldn't enjoy"" the books anymore, I ment that they made me physically nausious when I read them.  It didn't mean that I just felt bored with them.  I don't know if anyone who hasn't suffered from anxiety can understand that, but I just so desperately wanted to get rid of these feelings, that when Mary had said ""maybe God doesn't want you to read these books anymore"" (because the Holy spirit acts as a concience inside you, so I thought that this was a sign saying ""this is wrong, you shouldn't be doing this.""  Who can REALLY say?) I took it as a sign from God and was so desperate that I didn't listen to her when she said ""think and pray on this and God will tell you.""  I was overzealous and just went home and immediately was ready to get rid of this ""source and trigger"" and have my life go back to the way it was before when life was sooooo good and I was soooo happy.  So I deleted the other entry because it bothers me when people think that she's brainwashed me and she's a complete phsycho.  It was my fault.  Chris had called me ( LOVE YOU CHRIS!!!) yesterday because he was worried about me (he missed the previous entry) and wanted to know what was going on.  We talked about it, and at the end he was like ""remember to follow the God, and not the person.""  Yeah.  I know.  People aren't perfect, and they make mistakes too.  Its like if someone asked my advice on something, and I totally gave them the wrong solution.  It sounded right at the time, but later that so totally wasn't it.  
NO I didn't get rid of the books.  They are in a box in my room.  I think that I should take a step back from them and come back later.  Chris and I discussed a lot of things that were true and meaningful.  I understand where people are coming from when It seems like I just did a total 180.  lol  The only things that have changed in my everyday life is me trying to better myself and reading my Bible.  At work I try to be nice to people that totally get on my nerves and make my life miserable.  I try not to gossip.  Just stuff like that.  And I have learned in these last few days to stop and think and pray on things before I take such a huge step.  Baby steps.  Baby steps.
lol  He also asked me if I got rid of my Manga.  Oh HECK no.  I'm not ditching everything ""nonchristian"" in my home.  It was just the books that bothered me.  lol  Nikki and I are exchanging our Manga and other books, sharing our collections.  I've known her for a long time, she goes to my church, we've hung out together, and we worked at Starved Rock together, but just recently we've started a closer relationship.  Aside from Jerry, she's the only other friend I have around here who likes Anime.  I'm so glad Pete started the youth group.  I've got a group of friends now.  James, Nathan, and I kinda fell apart over the fall/summer/winter/spring.  I didn't have friends around here for a while (part of my depression).  So now I have friends, and I am so happy.  Last thursday I skipped Hazmat class and went to Nikki's birthday party and the people from youth group were there.  We played attack uno after dinner.  LOL  that was so hilarious.  Then we watched ""whose line is it anyway"" and ""the daily show""  while we talked.  We basically do what my friends in Peoria and I do when we get together.  Talk and joke and play games.  The only difference is we get together for a short while and talk about God, pray, and watch NOOMA (its like a mini-sermon from this Pastor in Minnesota.  He gives short and powerful messages to think about over the week).  lol
The Gallery (youth group) on friday was cancelled because Josh was playing in his band at a Hurricane Katrina Benefit.  Nikki and I were going to ride together, but we had a lack of communication, and when I got there, I found that she had left a few minutes earlier. =(  Well, even though I've lifed here for so long, I still didn't know where Ladd was, let alone where the benefit was being held (just follow the sound of the music...lol).  So I just went to the mall and roamed for a little while, then went home and watched some Home Improvement with mom.
This thursday we're having a going away party for Shannon.  Poop.  I just started getting to know her and she's so cool and she's going away.  She's going to New York for a year or so to work at a Camp there.  *sigh*  You know how long it has been since I've had a pen pal??  She won't have internet or even a cell phone there.  She'll probably get to call people, but she'll probably just call family. So we'll be doing it the old fashioned way of writing letters in ink.  kinda cool.  lol 
Well, I hope I explained some things and just know that I'm not joining a cult or anything.  Sorry I had peeps worried.  Thank you for caring.  *hugs*  love you all.

"event","Last sunday at sunday school Mary was teaching, and later she says that she didn't even plan to say anything, but for some reason she just felt she needed to.  She spoke about her depression and that if anyone needed help, she would be willing to be there just like her good friend was in helping her through her depression.  I tell you, I'm not one to ask for help.  I just have a hard time asking for help.  But I went up there, and I asked her if she would help me.  So, now every week we will be getting together.  It is the start of a new friendship.  We don't even have to talk about my problems, we could go out to eat, bake cookies, shop...whatever.  And I tell you...ever since I have felt SO. MUCH. BETTER.  All I needed was a closer relationship with God.  We've decided to do a bible study together.  We have some things in common, its just so great.  I feel so much better.  I do believe it when she says that it won't all be gone over night, but already I feel so much better.  I've been reading the bible every night now for a week, and I don't intend to stop.  I've finally found a way to overcome this anxiety.  -And it is all from reading and trusting in the WORD.  I thank God, and Mary for all of this.  Really its God that brought us together, but I thank Mary too for doing what God asked her to.  I think all of this anxiety was because it was finally time for me to come closer to HIM.  I was too far away for too long.  Far too long.  Thank you Lord Jesus.  My savior.  *tearing up in happiness*

Speaking of emotional trips, today I got a message on our answering machine from our chief.  A couple fire stations were coming home from Louisiana and we were going to welcome them.  I think/guess/hope that the fire departments all along 39/51 were doing the same thing at diff times as they drove home, but we made a banner saying ""WELCOME HOME MABAS 25!!!"" and we taped it up on the over pass, and we took out trucks and parked them on the over pass with the lights on and flashing, and when the firetrucks from the departments drove up and under us, we honked out horns, and blared our sirens, and waved and cheered. Then they threw their lights on, honked and blew their sirens, and waved back at us.  It was so great.  I nearly cried.  I've been doing that a lot lately... 

I've been going to a type of youth group on Friday nights called ""The Gallery"".  Its for high school/college age kids, and its pretty fun.  Mary's son, Peter started it at his house, and he's still looking for another place to have it, but I kinda hope he doesn't find another place.  True, we may get too big for it, but right now its comfy.  We talk a little about god, and watch a 10 min. video called NOOMA.  Those are really good.  Peter is like 23.  He reminds me SO MUCH of Shaun when he's telling his funny stories.  It is funny as all get-out.  I miss Shaun...where's my Shaun??  Oh, Peter is also hopefully going to be voted on as our new Pastor.  He's been doing our services for a couple weeks now, and he's really good.  I hope he stays, because I really like him.  Did I mention God is awesome??

Well, I think that is mostly all I have to report...Nikki and I have been exchanging mangas.  I've been reading her W Juliet series.  Its really cute.  ^_^
Well, Adieu!

Thank you heavenly father, for this awesome new friendship between Mary, and I pray that this feeling never goes away.
I love you lord,
Amen."

"event","Things have been...interesting lately, to say the least.  To sum it up:

I STILL don't have a pager...so I feel disconnected somehow.  I also don't have the clock on it, so I'm lost when it comes to the time and date...I suppose I should get my watches new batteries. *sluggish movement*

I got some info from work on insurance through them...If I continue to get these hours, I could afford it, but I'm so going to be scraping by.  I really hope that gas doesn't go up too terribly much at the beginning of next year when I can start the insurance plan.  Its great so far, it covers everything, but I pay like $15 more for Dental, and $4 something more for eye.  I don't think I will have the dental, so I would be paying $80-something dollars out of each paycheck.  *le sigh*

I had a talk with James in the park the other night...very disturbing.  I almost vomited a couple times it disturbed me so much (also I was still feeling queasy from the movie I saw the night before bothering me...I'm going to get help with my new insurance plan)  But he looked at me at one point with such fear and pleading in his eyes and said to me ""I need to learn how to care again.  I was hoping you would say something to help me.  Teach me how to care again.""  That scared the shit out of me.  In the end, I told him ""Maybe you should just stop pretending.  If you are angry, be angry.  If you are sad, be sad.  Just let it out. Don't smile and pretend everything is okay, because it isn't.  Let it out.""  SO he takes out his phone, and starts calling everyone he is angry with...which was a fairly long list.  I saw him yesterday and he said he felt SO much better.  And to top it off, he called AMBER.  His ex that has been past for like four years now, and even now when he talks about her he gets this RAGE in his voice.  I told him that even if he gets together with her and just yells for the next hour, it still may help.  I know that if he went to see a psychologist, the first thing they would tell him to do would be to come to terms with that.  He holds-clings to that with a vengence.  I feel he should let go of it.  We also had a short spiritual talk, but I really was scared about what to say, so I just picked through it as best as I could.  I hope I helped him...I don't like being put on the pedistal and on the spot like that, because I have serious problems myself, messed up and shit, so why ask me-ME of ALL people, for help???? *manic cackle*

AH, well, I should get ready for work.  I am SOOOOO procrastinating when it comes to homework.  I am such a slacker.  Help.  *sigh*  Ta everyone. 

*hugs Eeshee*  I send happiness your way, hon.  Hang in there, I love you.  I believe anything you tell me.  *Big hugs*"

Hello Hello.  Classes have started.  And Our class found out that we had the wrong book.  The entire class. lol  So already we're sort of behind.  Nice.  I just hope that the books come in before my financial aid expires.  I'm not shelling out $105 for a book.  Not to mention the fact that I don't have that to spare right now.
I've been getting more hours, and thats great.  Next week is the first schedule done by the computer program we have.  Most of the people aren't happy with it.  I kinda hope it doesn't last long, either.  Its kinda screwy, but It doesn't interfere with anything, and I have about 30+ hours now that I took Kim's 11-7 next friday.  Decent.  lol  I just hope this continues to happen this way.  I only have one day off next week, but that is only because I took Kim's shift on Friday.  Only thing is, I think the Sandwich fair is next week, and I would like to go.  I just don't know if it will fit in there somewhere...hmmm.  Must check.  I've decided that when the manager who comes to our store to help out until our trainees are ready to take over leaves, I am throwing a freakin' party.  PAR-TAY.  She is such a *ITCH.  I haven't done anything to her, in fact-no one has, really.  She just tries to find anything to bitch about.  Doesn't compliment anyone on the good job they've done, just tries to find something else to pick at.  Not a whole lot of people like her, so I'm sure I won't be the only one at the party.  I thought we had bonded, and were good, but no.  She just walks around with this constant sneer, and...well, we don't like her at all.  She leaves next month.  I'm wondering where to hold this party.  I'm thinking at the corner cafe.  We'll see.

So.  About books.  Has anyone read the book series by Rita Mae Brown and Sneaky Pie Brown called the Mrs. Murphy mysteries?  I found them in the mystery section, and they remind me of the Cat Who books with the description on the back.  I haven't read the one I have yet, but I'm looking forward to it.  Just wondering...I'm trying to finish books before I start another one.  Its a bad habit I've started doing.  eh.

Not much else to report, though.  Not stuff that is mine to tell anyway.  Just been hanging out with mom a lot.  Riding and watching movies.  I've been trying to do homework more and here I am sitting in front of the freakin' computer.  ""New Years resolution: Keep New Year's resolution.""

I've been hankering to just spontaniously take a trip to Peoria and go to the mall and stuff down there.  But I want to have some monies to spend when I get there, so...yeah.  Gotta get monies.  Hence work.  BLah.  Yeah, I left a response on the BSB official website for the review of there Michigan concert, and that was more than a week ago, and it didn't show up!  What the heck?  Stupid 'puter.  *sigh*  Anyway, I'm going to ""stop talking full stop"".  Ta 'n such. lol ^_~"

"event","Nothing much going on here...just work work work, and then school has started too.  Yesterday was mom's birthday and the day before was my grandparents' aniversary, and we all went to the Cracker Barrel for lunch.  I got mom some dark Chocolate, a pair of leather braided reins, some plastic tupperware for her lunch, and tomorrow I hope to get her some books.  

Saturday was James' 21st birthday.  We went to Murphy's tavern.  That's where his family usually goes.  It was me, James, Shane, James' sister Jackie, her boyfriend Carl, and James' parents.  I got to be the driver.  yay.  I've decided that I really don't like to see my friends drunk.  Eeshee wasn't bad, but I'm not sure if she was really as drunk as she could get, because she wasn't really that bad.  lol  Rachel was even better compared to James.  He was actually FALLING DOWN drunk.  He fell on the floor and was rolling around giggling like a five year old.  That really wasn't funny to me.  The way he got just wasn't funny to me.  The others thought it was funny, but I didn't.  I just don't like seeing my friends drunk.

I'm kinda happy about tonight.  We're actually going to watch wrestling.  It will be at Shane's, but I think it will be fun.  James is moving in with Shane, and his rats are over there already, and Shane has two cats.  lol  They are so cute.  I was over there laying on the floor watching James' rat in her ball, and they climbed on me and layed down. lol  I was like ""make yourselves at home.""  lol  I'm hoping tonight will be fun.

So I'm happy because I'm getting a whole lot more hours, but the thing is that this next week the schedule is being done by computer, so I'm really hoping and praying that the stupid computer doesn't screw me over and I start getting crap for hours again.  *sigh*

I got a new girth for Ginger, so I hope she is more comfortable when she gets saddled now, and stops nervously shifting around.  I got more money because of all the hours I worked, but I barely covered everything.  Its funny how you can never seem to have enough money.  That was one of the most true and wise things that have been said to me.  ""No matter how much money you make, you'll never have enough.""  That has so proven to be true.  Time and time again.  Of course, I haven't made much, so of course it has been true. lol

Well, I'm gonna go.  Not much else to report.  Ta. ^_^  *HUGS*"

"event","Well, this weekend was fun ^_^.  Until I got home last night.  I don't know if it was a combination between things, or if it was just my nerves again.  I didn't really drink much yesterday, and I was stupid and didn't wear sunscreen and/or wear a hat.  It was overcast and rained half of the day, gimme a break!  But last night I didn't feel well.  I got home and was soooo tired.  But I also wanted to go out with Derek, so I went to his house and we went to Delaney's and...I couldn't eat.  Just the smell made me nausious.  I told him I was feeling ill, and he was like ""yeah, you kinda look it.""  My nose was sunburned, and I had had a headache, and then it just turned to nausiousness.  He said that I should just go home and drink some water and lay down.  And drink water.  I felt so bad about that...

Yeah, yesterday some friends and mom and I went to Ottawa 4-H grounds for a fun show.  We took Misty and Ginger, then picked up Hattie for Destiny.  Destiny won second and third place.  Ginger and I didn't win anything, but I don't really care.  We went in the Plug race where we just see who can run up and around the barrel and back the fastest, the egg and spoon, the ride-a-buck-bareback where you ride bareback and put a dollar between your leg and the horse and whoever can keep it there the longest wins, then Destiny and I did the bareback egg toss.  The egg and spoon one we walked fine, but then they asked me to trot, and I dropped my egg. =(  The dollar one I did fine, until the second time around of cantering.  Ginger was getting tired, so I was bouncing in the air from her lazy canter, and I lost my dollar. =(  oh well.  

I wanna go see that movie ""must love dogs""  I read the book, and it is soooo cute.  I'd also like to go see Deuce Bigelow.  Maybe tomorrow Derek and I can go see one.  hmmmm.

Tired of saying the phrase ""I'm so tired of..."".  I'm tired of being angry, tired of being sad, depressed, anxious, and etc, etc.  Like that email keeps telling me ""God doesn't take things away, you have to let go of them.""  Ooookay.  I'm sure as heck going to try.  I don't know why things were bothering me so much, but I'm not going to let them bother me anymore.  I won't go down without a fight!  RAWR!

Well, in other news, I'm trying to hang out with other peeps now.  Trying to not put all my eggs in one basket, as they say.  This guy at my church has a little thing going every thursday night that I have been trying to get to but keep forgetting about or get scheduled to work or whatever.  I will be going to that as soon as I get a chance.  Hopefully it won't flop out before I get a chance to check it out.

I don't have pager as of this week.  It just died.  It was threatening to die for a while, but then it just...died.  So I asked them for a new one, but they can't give me one because they have to wait for the grant to see if it will be accepted or not. I feel so left out now.  *sigh*  Yesterday they had a call and drove right past my house.  I went to the station, but it was a false alarm.  I still felt left out.

I have a reading list for some peeps who are interested.  Some interesting new reads would be: Kim Harrison, her series has: Dead Witch Walking, The Good,The Bad, And The Undead, and Every Which Way But Dead; Katie MacAlister who writes this cool series: You Slay Me, and Fire Me Up; Then there is Barb & J.C. Hendee who cowrite the Dhampir series: Dhampir, Thief Of Lives, and Sister Of The Dead.  Great books!  I've also read some manga, and a friend loaned me the first book of W Juliet.  Its cute.  Doubt, Hot Gimmick, Hana Kimi, and Kare First Love are good too.  Check them out! NOW! (God, I sound like a commercial... ^_^;)

Well, I am going to go now.  Have to eat before work 'n all...ta!"

BACKSTREET BOYS CONCERT</FONT> EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>It was SO COOL because it all just happened so fast.&nbsp; On friday, for some reason Gaby and I started talking about the Backstreet boys, and she just offered me free tickets to go see them on the coming Wednesday.&nbsp; 0_0&nbsp; AWESOME!!&nbsp; The drawback was that they were in Detroit Michigan.&nbsp; oi.&nbsp; So that was a looooong freakin' drive.&nbsp; I took James with me and that was his first concert EVER.&nbsp; And I am so totally going to go see them again next year.&nbsp; Well, on their next tour, and I am going to try and get enough tickets for Eesh, Gaby, James, and I to all go see them.&nbsp; I brought back a shirt for Gaby, and she told me I could keep it for myself.&nbsp; She is such a sweetheart!!&nbsp; Oh.&nbsp; It was so awesome.&nbsp; *wistful smile*&nbsp; I dug out my old posters of them and hung one up, and I can't stop singing their songs.&nbsp; lol&nbsp; We got there just fine, and even were several hours early.&nbsp; We had awesome seats.&nbsp; We weren't so close that we could make out faces exactly, but at least we weren't in the nose bleed section, and they weren't tiny&nbsp;dancing ants.&nbsp; The concert was just awesome.&nbsp; The Click Five and some other girl were their opening acts, and I would like to buy the click five's cd, if I can ever find it...</P>
<P>So thats pretty much all...I gotta run and get my books because if I don't today, I won't get a chance to until who knows when.&nbsp; I asked Betsy for more hours because my savings are soooooo totally dwindling down to nothing its not even funny, its just oh-my-god-gotta-conserve-money panic.&nbsp; And well, she's giving me a lot.&nbsp; I've even been called to fill in empty spaces when people call off.&nbsp; So I've only had one day off this week.&nbsp; Yay.&nbsp; lol&nbsp; I've missed you guys, and I'm planning on visiting Peoria when I get some monies which will be maybe next month or so?&nbsp; I've been asking James if he'd like to come and we could check out the mall and the book stores down there.&nbsp; Whatcha think,&nbsp;Eesheekins?&nbsp; Love love to you all!&nbsp; *big hugs*&nbsp; ^_^</P>"

Bad news is (the thing I need prayer for majorly) our well may be drying up.  NICE.  That would mean no water.  We have water now...but we don't know how long that may be.  And  we don't even know for sure if that is what the problem is.  It COULD be the water pump...and if that is the case, I would be kinda relieved.  I would rather have that as the problem than not have water in the well at all.  UGH.

So yesterday was busy.  I worked on my social problems final paper and finished it (Yay).  Cashed my check and just got essential stuff (trying to save monies).  Went over the Firetruck with Ray (yay, I got that done and over with).  Then Derek and his dad came over and helped put our new washer in the house.  They tried to hook it up, but it the hose leaked where we coupled it with another hose, so mom is just going to get another dryer and get rid if the stacked washer/dryer.  Anyone wanna buy a dryer?  It still has the washer attached to the bottom, and the washer is shot, but the dryer still works.

Well, please pray for me. *sigh*  If it ain't one thing, its another around here..."

My weekend was AWESOME!  heehee.  I love horses.  We went to Wisconsin to the Midwest horse fair.  We left about 7 a.m.  Karen, Aunt Cindy, Mom, and I all went in my car.  It was a lot of fun.  We shopped, and watched the horse shows in the main arena, then we shopped some more, then went to the barns and looked at all the horses.  The biggest horse in the world was there too.  Goliath is his name, and he stands 6 foot 5 at his shoulders.  So his head is even higher than that.  He's taller than my DAD!!!  He consumes 18 lbs of grain, so many bales of hay (I can't remember), and 30 gallons of water a DAY.  We lost mom some time during the shopping.  We had all met up, and decided to go to the main arena to watch a certain show that was in the paper thing (can't remember what its called...ugh.  Words slipping my mind...) and she was in the lead and she just-dissappeared!!  She was there, then she was gone!  We're all like ""what the heck?""  So she was missing for like an hour among hundreds of people.  But we found her eventually.  We stopped on the way home at the Cracker Barrel, and got home about 12:15 p.m.  Whew. All the horses there were so pretty and clean-probably cleaner than we were), and it made me want to go home and brush my horse.  I got some really pretty Arabian horse decals for my windows.  Pretty!
She's gaining weight.  And her leg is healing.  She'll have her stitches out at the end of this week.  I rode her for the first time yesterday.  I love my horse. 
Well, I've got some things to do.  I've got to finish my final.  *hugs*  Byebye!"

I've got mixed feelings about this.  I mean, she's not my horse, and sometimes she can be a pain in the arse, but I also am a little sad to see her go.  A big part is that Dancer won't have anyone to play around with anymore.  What with the two old nags out there...lol.  Ginger is afraid of him, and doesn't want to play and Star doesn't want to play either.  Poor dancer.  I kinda wish we could get another arabian about Dancer's age.

Its incurable, so its chronic.  She compared it to a cold sore-it comes and goes whenever.  So I have a bunch of sneezing, stuffy cats.  Some are getting the mucus in their eyes, she gave me an eye medication to clear that up, but as for the sneezing and stuffiness, she said there isn't anything I can do about it.  Great.

I called around to get prices on psychiatrists, and they are all so freaking expensive.  Mom said our insurance doesn't cover it.  I cried so many times today...I hate doctors.  Why do they have to put a price on peoples' misery?  The more life-threatening disease, or the problem you have, the more expensive to get rid of it."

Soooooo had a talk with Derek around Valentine's day.  We're still where we were a year ago.  Dating.  But the good news is that we're on the same page.  We're both confused.  Yay?  lmao!!  Another good thing is that I got something cleared up-he still finds me attractive. lmao!!!  *sigh*  But in all seriousness...sometimes I wonder if I'm wasting my time. <slump> ~_~*  URGH.  Lately I've been feeling more like things are left unfinished.  At least I don't have Iisha's problem...or maybe I do only on a much smaller scale?  And then am I passing up better people?  Its not like I'm taken, but then I feel like I'm cheating.  I would certainly be upset if I found out Derek was dating someone else. HA like he barely has time for me.  But its not like I don't wonder...I almost hyperventillated when I thought I saw him once at Walmart with some other chick, but then it turned out not to be him.  Men are just walking confusions.

OOh!  Better news is that I've got a room reserved for Acen!!  Things are taken care of.  Suh-WEET.  So I don't have to spend the next two months worrying.

Sometimes I wish I could just quite school and just work.  I wouldn't have to worry about stupid papers, reading homework, or all that jazz.  I could just have a steady schedule, hang out with friends, play with my animals, and do what I want.  No school to get in the way and fail at because more interesting things in my life got in the way.

"event","I haven't been online much except to go to ebay to sell stuff and buy stuff.  Mom and I have been looking at horse classifieds for Aunt Cindy.  Mom is also talking about posting an ad for Misty online.  Maybe trading, but for sure selling.  Mostly to cut the cost, and another reason is because she is such a big PAIN IN THE ARSE.

My anxiety attacks are back. Wheeeeeee. Fun and a half.  When do I just die already?

SO yesterday morning there was an ambulance page.  I decided to stay in bed.  I'm sure there were three other peeps to work the radio.  *pouts*  I never make it in time. T_T  Anyway, Turns out that the friend of mine who's mom died about three weeks back, has terrible, horrible, the WORST luck-he found his father dead from a heart attack.  So now he's lost both of his parents in a matter of weeks.  Sudden deaths.  Not like they were sick in the hospital, no-they just dropped dead.  Have you hugged your parents today?  Be sure to tell them you love them.

Trainings are commencing...oh!  I actually did a sketch if Ginger at the firefighter meeting.  I just sat there and doodled it (YES I was listening too.  I can multitask, people!=P~ ) and it turned out awesome!  Its the first thing that I have drawn in like four years!  I'm so proud of myself. ^_^ <=proud face

Derek came back from his five week police academy training.  He came home every weekend, but still...lol  He asked me to be his valentine.  ...Progress?   His grandmother is in the hospital.  She clinically died, then she was brought back.  She seems to be doing fine...

Ah well...I should really get out of this chair...I've been at this computer waaaaaaay too long.  *sigh*  I need to relax before something bad happens.  A few years have been taken off of my life span, I think.
Well, ta for now. *hugs*"

"event","BAH!  I can't remember the name to my other journal!  MY OWN NAME!  blurg.  *sigh*  SO I guess I will just...put it in here.  *sigh* 

So the weekend before last I went to a reception with Derek.  Which he asked me to the night before, then I went into a frenzy because I had no clue what to wear.  It was possibly the most freakin' cold day of the year.  lol  We sat there with is dad and sister and chatted.  We talked most of the night, and only danced once.  heehee.  Right before we left we slow danced to Shania Twain and Bryan White's ""From This Moment""  There were other songs that I was more geared towards dancing to, but that is the one he happened to ask me to dance to. eh. lol So that is the song we first danced to. He's so cuddly.  Muscled, but not the hard kind.  Coooooool. lmao

I felt sooooo stupid at one point though, because I didn't know neither the bride nor the groom,  I didn't get up to catch the bouquet.  I just would have felt weird standing among all these women who are related to or are best friends of the bride, trying to catch this bouquet.  Am I wrong?  So I just sat there.  I knew some people there, since the oglesby firemen were invited, so I knew some of the guys there.  Which was a relief that I knew SOME people.  Then it was time to catch the garter, and I was like ""are you going to go up there?"" He was like ""well, you didn't go up there.""  urgh.  BUT the hilarious thing was that Randy went up to the DJ and told him to get Derek up there.  Ha HA! lol heeheehee  But the groom practically handed the garter to one of his groomsmen.  Didn't even throw it over his shoulder, he just tossed it to his buddy.  grrr how unfair!

It wasn't a bad night.  I looked great, and didn't do anything I regret...except maybe not dancing more...meh.

Then the next week Mel's Mother died.  On friday Eric had invited me to come hang out with them at the bar, so I went up there and while I waited for Eric to show up and take me to Mel's I ordered a Bacardi Razz.  WELL, I had tried one of those little ""bitch drinks"" as Steph called them.  The ones in the tiny bottle?  And I had liked that, so I asked for the bacardi Razz, and Drew was like ""and...?""  ""Just Bacardi.""  The guys around (some of the other firemen were there too) were like ""whoa!  She must be having a rough day!""  I was thinking ""what are they talking about?  Its not that bad.""  So Drew puts this drink in front of me, and I take a drink, and it Burned.  I almost started coughing.  My eyes almost watered.  I was like ""Okay, I will just sip it...""  It still burned. lmao.  So I asked Drew ""what do they usually mix this with?""  ""sprite, mountain dew...""  ""I'll mix it with sprite""  That tasted much better. lol  But he gave me so much, I wanted to ask Eric to finish it off for me when he got there, but he was on ambulance call, so they weren't drinking.  Then around that time I realized that Mel was at the bar.  huh.  I had no clue what to say to him, I wanted to go over and say I was sorry, but then what?  I didn't know his mother, and I didn't know him that well, but I felt really bad.  SO I just sat there like a stupid lump.  They left, and then Eric showed up with Steph.  He laughed at the thought of me drunk.  I finished my drink, and we went to Mel's.  Mel wasn't there, but some of his friends and his Dad were there.  They offered me a beer, but I declined.  Beer gross.  Soda?  no, thank you.  I was there about an hour, and still no Mel.  I decided it was time to go home, and his Dad came up and hugged me and told me that it was a really special thing leaving that rose at the wake.   I started to get misty, and he gave me a hug.  It was a long hug, and I felt so bad for him.  Eric had told me that the wake was at four, and I wasn't sure if I was going to go or not, but at the last minute, I went out and bought a single rose, and went in search of the funeral home.  I found it, but no one was there.  I went inside, and a pastor was there, and told me that the wake didn't start until 4:30, and even then it was just family for the first half hour.  Oh.  Well, I couldn't stay so I left the rose and signed the guest book. I think the pastor had taken the rose and put it with her...I was afraid to go in for fear of disrespect.

I left and I really had a time keeping my balance...I only had the one drink, but boy did it impare my balance.  I almost had Eric and Steph take me home, but I didn't have far to go...I got home and started to get sick.  I don't know what it was, but it kept me up all night.  uck.  Needless to say I don't think I will be drinking anything for a while.

Anyway, I will go now.  Its a long entry.  Ta-ta!"

"event","Well, despite things around me, I'm doing great.  I'm studying for classes, I'm working out regularly except for today because for some reason I forgot my workout pants.  ugh.

This class I am taking Social Problems in America is very informative.  We just finished a book about homeless people, its called ""Rachel and Her Children"".  Its opened my eyes to the new status of Homeless people.  These People had steady jobs, good homes and a happy life and then suddenly something as simple as a death in the family or a house fire complicated things so much that they lost their home, their job, and in some or most cases, their family.  Then people look down on them like they are just people to be exterminated.  Like insects or rodents.  I read in the book and it actually had me in tears that this homeless man was sleeping on a bench, and someone came and spilled gasoline on him and lit him on fire.  People watched him burn and passed him by for four hours before someone notified the police or an ambulance.  How sad is that???  How infuriating is that???  That could be any one of us sitting there!  THe government is doing less and less to try to help these people, acting like it is their fault, and that they could get out of their current situation at any time.  It is actually costing us more for the government to try to sweep them under the rug than it would to actually try to help these people.  It is so infuriating, I could go on and on.  Read the book.  READ IT NOW!  Then write a letter to our government telling them what boneheads they are.

Also, I discovered yesterday that one of the guys I know's mother died on Monday morning.  She was fifty years old, and she died of a heart attack.  I have no clue what to say to this guy.  What words can you say to comfort him?  Nothing.  I feel sooooo bad.  Especially since the night before yesterday, I had called him, and was all cheerful and he sounded kinda out of it, but I thought maybe I woke him up or something...I feel so stupid.  How sad...No words can describe.

So I was like ""we could have a fire and it would burn down our trailor, then we could be homeless on the street just like in the book.""  Then I was like ""My mother could die.""  Wow.  So many things lately that make me think.  Now I've got to read a book on fast food.  I don't know, maybe I will skip that book and just take those two tests as my ""drop tests"".  I really REALLY do not want to know what is wrong with what I am eating.  Because then I would starve.  I'm skinny enough, don't you think???  Does this cardboard box make me look fat?"

"event","I was so excited the other day.  I went to farm and fleet and bought a stable blanket for Ginger in a brilliant Red with White straps and stuff.  I brought it home, pulled it out and it was nice and heavy.  I thought to myself ""this is going to look so good on her, and it will keep her nice and warm...""  I tried it on her, and OH WHAT A JOKE.  The size on the package said it was a size 71.  I had ordered a canvas blanket sized 69, and it fit her just right.  Then it shrank, so I thought I would buy a size larger.  THIS STUPID BLANKET DIDN'T EVEN FIT AROUND HER MIDDLE.  It was just unworkable.  I could not believe it.  Well, maybe I can.  Farm and fleet is only good for some of their horse stuff, but some like the blanket just aren't right.  *sigh*  I finished sewing the ribbon on her blue insulating blanket today, and put it on her.  She was shivering this morning, poor baby.  I had checked on her last night, when I saw the wind chill on TV, and she was okay.  I just don't know what to do with that girl.  I don't want to keep her cooped up in her stall too much.  She's getting so stiff.  I found the perfect blanket on Ebay, but before my question got answered, it was sold.  I hope the lady has another one.  Now I need to scrounge for the money...

Nothing else new really...I got Jerry, his brother Dale, and Dale's girlfriend Elizabeth in my Sociology class.  That should prove to be interesting, to say the least.  I've got all today off...I took the joke of a blanket back.  *sigh*  Its cold in here.

Blah.  OH!  Yesterday I was at Walmart and someone came on the intercom and said that someone's Truck in the parking lot was on fire.  They listed the license plate numbers of the cars around it, and one of them was Suzanne's!  Oh Dear.  And to think I was going to find her car and park next to her.  heheh.  But none of the vehicles around the truck got damaged.  The fire department was there, and the parking lot on that side was just nothing but smoke.  Cool. =P

SO yeah, back to Blah.  Blah Blah Blah"

"event","Well, I've got an hour between classes, which by next thursday I think will be taken up by lifting weights in the weight room.  Hopefully this next class, Social Problems in America, will have Jerry in it.  The last time I talked to him, he still hadn't signed up for the class yet...if he doesn't get in, I may drop it.  The class I just came out of, Police Community Relations, has a funny teacher.  So thats a plus that the class isn't going to be a snore. ^_^  So that means I will have interesting teachers this semester. lol  

Last Sunday night I had an extrication class at the station that I was so nervous about that I was grumpy all day to mom.  *sigh*  Poor mom.  I wasn't exactly looking forward to possibly making an idiot of myself again in front of the guys.  But, fortunately I did well. ^_^  The only thing I had trouble with was the air chisel.  It made me nervous, so I didn't get it to work right, plus my fingers are too small in my gloves, so I couldn't get a good press on the trigger.  *sigh*  But I got to bust a window. lol  I've already handled the saws-all really well, and I worked the bos (jaws) tool.  I did well. ^_^

I've pretty much just been hanging out at home with mom lately.  Watchin' movies.  Its just like I'm back in high school again before I had a life outside of home, school, and work. I wanted to start a hobby like paint-by-numbers, and looked some up on the internet, and there are some awesome pictures of horses and wolves found at amazon.com.  So BEAUTIFUL.  But I haven't had any money to spare to buy any.  I keep thinking I should be able to find them cheaper somewhere else.  I've started sewing things like mending stuff around the house too.  I'm converting a fleece blanket mom gave me to use in the barn to a blanket for insulation under Ginger's blanket.  I'm looking forward to seeing how it will turn out. 
I'm running out of space to put my books...so sad =*( 
I've rented the movie that I have on Layaway with some other stuff.  King Arther.  I love that movie.  So many handsome men...so little time.  I'm really into the movies like LOTR and KA right now...the old mystical/fantasy warrier type movies.

*sigh*  I think mom is going to try and sell Misty this summer.  She says if anyone offers her $1,200 for her, they can have her.  Misty just seems to become a greater pain more and more.  She's messed up the gate in the barn so bad it won't open in anymore.  The wooden post is leaning inward.  She leaned her big chest on it to get to some hay and caused it to lean.  I don't know if she's slow, or everything is just beneath her.  You try to shoo her away, and let her know that its bad, but she just stands there like ""duh?"".  Then this morning, after a couple days ago I had moved the hay out of reach, or so I thought, she had leaned over some more and pulled two bales down.  I was soooooo angry.  Why can't they just leave things alone??  Why can't we just have every problem fixed, and have no problems for at least a full season???  I swear, if it isn't one problem, its another.  So she's for sale by word of mouth right now.

Right, now I'm irritated again.  *sigh* 

LOL!! OH!  A guy who works at McDonald's used to go to ICC, and work in Peoria as a paramedic or whatever, and he also said that he worked in the computer lab at ICC, so I asked him first if he knew Chris, but then he said he didn't.  Then I mentioned Matt, and he said he knew Matt, and that he used to be friends with Matt.  His name is Jerod, I don't know his last name, but he says he used to hang out with Matt and that he hates Matt now (not surprising), and then he remembered Chris and said he likes Chris.  I just think that is so awesome.  Small world, eh?  I'll have to ask him if he met Shaun.  Speaking of Shaun, when is that party going to be, Eesh?

James, Nathan, Rachy, and I are having a pajama party on Friday.  We are going to all get together at Nathan's have junk food by his fireplace, and watch one of the Lord of the Rings movies. I can't wait.

"event","Well yesterday James and I were discussing a problem of mine, and he has come to the conclusion that I have a serious fear of commitment.  Even the hint of a guy liking me sends me running in fear.  I get sick to my stomach, and I have even thrown up.  Its terrible.  The only one who can relate to me is Melissa.  I don't know if she's gotten sick to her stomach before, but she says that she too gets scared.  We'd like flirt with someone we are interested in, but then when the guy seems interested, we suddenly get scared.  argh!  Well, at least I'm not alone here.  *sigh*  Issues?!?!?

"event","You know, it seems like everything is going great, and you're doing good in your life, handling everything pretty well, and BAM! out of nowhere another challenge hits, and things start to fall apart.  Ever since James and Tony started dating, I've been seeing parts of myself that I don't like.  I'm the jealous type.  And I don't like change.  James was my special person.  Next to Eeshee, he's my best friend.  Since he and Tony have started dating, I haven't been the best of friends to him.  I've been bitchy, two-faced, and very emotional.  I'm sorry I couldn't just automatically switch to good-person mode, and just hand him over to Tony like a good little girl, I'm trying to ""get over it"" and share.  lol  I guess Tony and I are playing tug-of-war with poor James, but I think I'm the worst of it (because I'm a haggy female [yes I said it] =P~ ).

SO I've made some resolutions that will hopefully help me:

1.)  Be nicer to James.
2.)  Become more independant of James
3.)  Study. (this is for both school and Bible)
4.)  Try and work more hours and try to not get sent home early.

You shouldn't make too many resolutions for yourself because they may become harder to keep, so hopefully I will be able to keep these.  If I slip, I'm sorry."

"event","Yes, I'm still alive.  I just haven't had much to say really.  Had a good christmas.  Mom and I had a sort of role-reversal. lol  She got tons of presents from me.  It was so fun watching her open all her gifts.  I got her:  a dvd player, RF Modulator (which I later returned because we don't need it), books, a clock, a mood ring, basters, a wine corkscrew-thingy, a denim apron for work, a tape of twisted christmas songs, aaaaaand I think thats it...
I got some good stuff for christmas too.  All together I got: Home Improvement season one, Princess Diaries 2, The Lord of the Rings Uncut box set, Blue Collar Rides Again dvd, two Hana-Kimi mangas, Double Jeopardy, True Women, Jeff Foxworthy tape, Inu Yasha 2nd dvd, ankle/wrist weights, a book called ""Horse People"", a snowman nicknack, a firestation nicknack, an awesome firefighter knife, A replica of Duncan's sword from Highlander, a picture of Derek, some ornaments, some cute toe-socks, Bill Engvall: Here's Your Sign Reloaded, Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason book, Kenny Chesney's christmas cd, a horse bobble-head, horse picture, chocolates, two horse calendars, cookies, and mom gave me two real gold and gem rings.  I got a pretty awesome haul. =D

LOL!  At our McDonald's christmas party/gift exchange, our limit was five dollars, and the girls got presents for girls, and the boys for boys.  I picked out some cute toe-socks and put them in a cute little bag.  I thought that it was a great little gift.  Well, Dora got mine, and the look on her face when she saw them was kinda less than happy. lol-then she proceeded to put them on her HANDS and said ""whoever got me the gloves, thank you""  LMAO  The rest of us looked at her and we were like ""um...those are toe-socks."" lol  Ah Dora...funny funny.  I got a candle and a Journal kit from Rachy.  Then we played Bingo and everyone got to win a prize.  I got a box of assorted chocolates.  We had tons of fun.

For James' christmas party that we planned, and invited like fifteen people, and only like...eight people showed up. we had a gift exchange and fixed dinner which for a couple things we had no idea what we were doing. lol it was hilarious.  The good news was that the turkey had no left overs for James to eat.  For the next week like last time. lol

Karen and I went shopping after christmas and it felt good to be able to spend money on myself and get some stuff that I've been needing/wanting for a while, but weren't high priority and not feel bad about spending the money.  Since Ginger has been spending more time in her stall this winter, I got a big plastic water traugh for her stall and used mom's old water heater for it with an extension cord I got.  Her stall is nice and cozy now with thick straw on the floor.  She lays down in it too.  Snug as a bug in a rug.  She's going to need a new stall blanket soon, because the one she has is shrinking.  *sigh*  Pretty soon, I don't think even Star could wear it.  Not that SHE needs it.  The little bear crossed with a donkey out there.  I'll have to get the new one two sizes too big.

Well, tonight I'm going to do something with Derek, maybe catch a movie and get some pizza.  THEN I rented the third Harry Potter, bought some shrimp, mom got the sweet wine, and I got myself some Bacardi Razz (I don't like the caffenated stuff as great...oh well), and mom and I are going to spend New Year's Eve together.  Yay!  Christmas Eve we watched the first Harry Potter together. lol  I've been spending more time with Mom lately.  The other night we had a whole night of the third Lord of the Rings.  Nathan, James, Rachy and I plan to get together and watch all three uncut versions some time soon.  I've been watching the extras on the third one for a couple days now.  I was so excited!  They had a thing on the horses in the movie!  The training, and the actors talking about riding, and who bought what horse after it was over.  It was cool.  I loved it.  Thank you James!  

Okay Okay, I'm done...I think...for now.  lol  Ta-ta everyone!  Happy New Year and all that Jazz!"

Anyway, I'm being really really lazy and procrastinating right now...unggg...I just want to be lazy today.  But I have stalls to clean...ungggh...I'll do it tomorrow. lol  Snow is cool until it turns into slush and mud.  Ice is also bad.  *sigh*  I'm so worried about Ginger.  I called mom from work yesterday to see if she put Ginger in her stall or put her blanket back on, but she said that she didn't do either because she wasn't shivering.  Well, when I came home and went out to check on her, she was shivering big time.  Poor baby.  It just seems worse this year, or maybe its because the weather is worse this year?  I heard we are supposed to get 24 measureable snow falls this year.  Great.  I'm going to be shoveling some major poop.  I started to put her blanket on, but then decided to put her in her stall.  She was shivering so bad.  I toweled her off, and put her sheet on.  I don't want to baby her too much then her winter fur may not grow all the way in...urgh!  I just worry about her.  I hate cooping her up in the stall so much, but she gets cold.  *sigh*  Talk about a hard keeper.

The other night James and I went over to Nathan's and played Mario 3.  For six hours.  James and I were Luigi, and Nate was Mario.  Mario kicked ass. lol  Nathan had NO life when he was a kid.  Because he knew where everything but the anchor was.  and he basically got us through every level.  Luigi would win like one world, then die.  In each level.  We won the whole game.  Played through til the last world and then it starts you over to the first world, and gives you tons and tons and tons of P wings.  You can fly through just about every world if you want.  But after sitting there for six hours straight losing, I was about to either laugh or cry because that is so stupid to think that we would sit there and play through again with wings.  How boring would that be???  I would have the control buttons permanantly etched into my thumbs.  Nate said that he played so much as a kid, his thumbs locked up on him once.  DORK! lol  And then when his mom got them un stuck, he went right back to playing.  ^_^;; eheh. 
Anyway, gotta go.  Ta-ta!"

The holiday season is helping too.  That snowstorm before Thanksgiving ROCKED!!  I love it!  I got up Thanksgiving morning to feed the animals and went for a ride in the woods on a whim before all the snow melted and got all ugly again, and it was just BEAUTIFUL in there.  The trees were covered in snow...everything was covered in snow.  It was like a freakin' christmas card.  Trees were down, so I couldn't go all the way in the woods, but I got to go for a great ride in the-did I mention it?-BEAUTIFUL snow.  *sigh*  Then I went inside and got ready to go to Aurora.  When I was on my way to grandma's my pager went off for an accident.  I heard later from Stephanie that it no one was hurt, but it was awesome.

Didn't go see what I thought was going to be the Chippendale dancers.  I changed my mind.  It didn't have much to do with my final decision, but it turned out to be the Playgirl boys.  So Rachel went without me.  Yeah.

Things have been going on, but I don't remember them right now.  lol  Well, gotta go. Ta!"

"event","So, some of the FF guys and I were at the village inn, A.K.A. ""house of doom"" if it ever caught on fire, the plan is to just let it burn, because it would probably kill someone.  You could get lost in there with the lights ON, and clear visibility, let alone if you were crawling around in smoke.  And the structure condition and the JUNK...*shivers*  ANYWAY, we were following the pipelines of the sprinkler system to see where exactly they go, and it wasn't until I looked and came face to face with a condom dispencer (I always thought that was a myth...*shrug*) that I realized I was in the men's bathroom. lmao!!  And They were talking firefighter stuff, and just not paying attention, and I'm reading this dispencer, and suddenly burst out ""SCENTED?"" 
*silence*
Then they realize where I am and what I'm looking at, and they start escorting me out of the bathroom. LMAO!!  That is one of the times they treat me like a daughter. lmao  It tickled me for the next few days, everytime I think about it, actually. LMAO!!  and I heard behind me ""why on earth would you want them scented?""  ""I don't want to know."" lmao!!!!  Really?  Why WOULD you want them scented??  flowers?  ""Awww!  You bought me flowers?""  ""....Kinda..."" *snorts with laughter*  Ah, good times.

Then later I had to do my sprinkler practical, where I have to use two wooden wedges to stop the flow of water from a sprinkler.  Ugh.  I was in full gear, reaching up, blinded by water, trying to stuff wooden wedges in just right to stop the flow, and I just couldn't seem to get them in right, I would still have a fine spray of water!  Finally I got it to stop as much as I could get it.  I had water in my UNDERWEAR. They laughed at this. all the way down to my feet.  I was SOAKED.  I kicked ass at the salvage tarp folding practical, though.  I guess I can do SOMETHING.  I won't even get into the events that happened at the burndown on Sunday...Ugh.  I embarrassed myself so many times, its really NOT funny.  I'm not laughing.  ugh.  So that is my funny story.  Something non-depressing. yay!"

"event","Some day in the future I will come back and be my old self again.  There are times when I just draw out of the group and take a breather, regroup and get back in the flow, but this time it just isn't working.  My engine keeps missing. lol  Every time I think whatever my problem is is getting better, it comes back and I'm in a funk again.  ARGH!!!!  Too many changes at once, maybe???  So many doubts and fears and worries...I don't even enjoy things that I used to.  Like I'm thinking about not being a firefighter anymore, too.  *sigh*  This is getting depressing again.  I'll just go now."

Right now I wonder when/if I will ever feel truly happy and worry free again.  For at least a little while.  Like times when just for no reason you feel bursting with contentment for seemingly no reason at all and the day is just awesome.  Dark clouds are all I can see when I look into the future now.  I wish there were something someone anyone could say to make everything better, but the only one who could tell me that lives states away and I could never get past his security gaurds.

*sigh*  God I beg you...T_T  Please help me.  Please help us."

"event","Well, We got to the smoke house in Cedar Point and were all geared up and ready to go in when Bill goes ""Hey, you guys got a call.  Mutual aid to Lostant.""  SO I had to get all my gear off and jump in the truck.  Its like putting all your winter stuff on then realizing you have to go to the bathroom.  ugh.  Turns out that the paper company in lostant's district has a 200 ft open area with just a roof over it full of bales of smashed corn stalks on fire.  We got there at 9:30 or so, and didn't get back to the station until 4:30 p.m.  It just WOULD GO OUT.  We had a big caterpilar back hoe digging it and moving it around so we could soak it down, but the stuff still kept smoldering.  it just kept reigniting EVERYWHERE.  URRRRGH!!  And we were pulling 100 ft of hose around charged with water, MAN I was sore the next day!  My whole body was sore.  There was a picture in the Streater Paper with me sitting on the hose spraying at the smoking pile of corn husks.  They called me a man. T_T  You wouldn't be able to tell it were me if I hadn't known that I was sitting there and that this guy was walking around me taking pictures.  I look like a little kid sitting playing with the hose. lol ^_^  yeah.  It was a big day for me.  Windy day.  We got the windy smokey side.  Nice.  The worst camp fire you could ever go to.  About 8 fire departments were there that day, and I was the only female there.  GIRL POWER! RAWR! lol  The other girl that joined our station was voted off because she never came back.  I don't think she intends to either.  oh well.

Yeah today mom and I played with the horses a bit, and I'm going to see a movie tonight with Derek.  Don't know what movie.  I haven't really been out much lately.  I've actually gotten to spend time with James though. ^_^ yay!  I've been wondering what to do with myself lately.  Haven't really wanted to go visit with other friends.  I mostly want my other best friend, James.  First being Eeshee, of course. =P~  Derek has been working nights, so he's sleeping during the day, its harder to get a hold of him, and we play phone tag now.  
Well, I'm gonna go now. Ta-ta."

"event","Hi.  Sorry I haven't posted in a looooong time, but I just haven't had anything good to say.  The only good thing that has been happening lately is that I have been reading the Bible more, and there was some good riding had, but that is pretty much it...lemme check...yeah.  Pretty much it.  Some good times here and there, but pretty much nothing good really happening.  Well, later all.  Pray for me to overcome this test.
Tomorrow is going to be another smoke house.  This time I'll be going in.  I pray that nothing goes wrong.  When I come out of there alive with no major problems, THEN I will be happy."

"event","another day of work.  it was pretty boring except for when I had to do a statement because I found someone's house I a unlivable state.  there was piles of cat shit everywhere.  at the end of the night someone pulled a fire alarm and some guy refused to get up from his bed and leave the building.  the MP called for back up and 15 MPs showed up to drag his ass out of bed, cuff him and take him to the station."

"event","whats up everyone.  today was a busy day.  I got stuck in the patrol that checks the high risk targets on post to make sure no one is trying to blow anything up.  I found a door open at the dental clinic and I got to go in with weapon drawn and make sure there was no intruders.  there was no intruders but it was still cool to finally get to draw my trusty 9m:)  I got called to barracks 265 because someone got beat up in one of the rooms.  when I got to the room it was a woman bleeding everywhere and she said she had broken ribs.  a witness said her boyfriend did it and was at the hospital.  I had to go there and find him and I found out from him that they was arguing in the parking about a playstation 2.  the female took out a razor blade and cut the guy on the chin and scratched him on his right forearm.  the guy went into his room and she followed him and started arguing again and she then went into her room and he followed her in and in his own words said that he "" beat the crap out of her"".  I had to stay after to make the statement.  I say if a bitch cut me with a razor blade I would of done the same thing."

"event","whats up everyone.  not much happening in the last few days.  we was suppose to go to 12 hour shifts already but its just been a fucking waiting game and the war will be over before it happens.  as far as these monkey hugging hippies that are on the news all the time saying we don't need to go to war, I wish I could chase them all down with a humvee and shoot them with my mark 19.  Anyway,  I can't wait to get a printer and digital cameral that I have on layaway at wal-mart.  just 150 more dollars to go:)  I'll start posting some cool pictures then."

"event","I got a call last night from someone in my company saying that we'll going to 12 hour shifts and instead of returning to work on friday, it will be thurday.  its not to bad since i'll be working 3 on and 3 off.  it still sucks that im working 12 hours a day.  i also finally got my DSL hook-up to work after 4 days of trying to figure out what was wrong.  i was about to throw my computer across the room if it didn't work soon.  its going to get alot busier around here once the war starts and the base goes on security level delta."

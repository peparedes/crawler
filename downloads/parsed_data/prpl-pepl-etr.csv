"event","okay so I haven't written in this thing forever (sorry Lindsey!). Any way the new news on the block is that my boyfriend and his best friend are buying a car together. Yep now mind you my mom just bought a new car, my best friend (who happens to be my boyfriends-best friends-girl friend) just got a new car, now the boys are buying a new car together and I am feeling VERY replaced and left out because I CAN'T drive because of the whole stupid seizure thing!!!!!! As soon as we got mom's new car Shane got to drive it.....a lot. Have I got to NO!!!!!!! It makes me so mad!!! I am to fucking old to have people driving me to work. Now this week he just started his job so yeah, now it's NEW job, NEW car. And I am feeling incredibly replaced. 

oh yeah and football is starting soon too. So tomorrow teh boys are helping coach move furniture that I didn't know about until tonight because as far as I had known we were going to play sand volleyball tomorrow. But whatever. I guess I am just bitching. I just feel so damn restricted with the driving thing especially because everything in the last 2 weeks has been about CARS CARS CARS!!!!!!

Am I pathetic or what and tomorrow I won't prolly get to see him at all because of the thing with coach then he has to work then I have to work and well yeah. And next week volleyball tryouts start, and football practice starts. And oh wait who can't fucking drive oh yeah that's me!

Grrrrr........oh well life sucks right??? Maybe I can convince people to let me drive again. 
Cross your fingers and hope for me."

"event","Okay so can we say that I am one of the most hmmm....what's the word......scrambled people in the whole wide world!! Not even playing!! Boys are so damn' complicated. Or just a complication to my life anyway. I have this one guy who is head over heels for me, and I in no way like him like that!! And I majorly feel bad because he even called me at work and asked me if I wanted to hang out sometime after school. I was in the middle of checking out a customer, so I said yes. What else was I supossed to say? So I am supossed to go and do something with him on Tuesday. Uhhhh.....yeah.....(Lindsey you know who this guy is. Really tall, dresses in all black, long-ish hair, You got it yet?) So I am kinda feeling bad because I knew that he liked me and I flirted with him anyway. I just realized how disastorous it is for me to be such a big flirt. Like seriously, today I was helping Tony with a story for him lang. class and this kid P.J. that I have litterally talked to only twice ot three times.....I was hard core flirting with him. I walked out of the classroom and was like 'Orion, I am a major big flirt!!! Did you see me  in there with P.J.?' I'm just kind of in awe that I am that awful. Orion was like 'Yeah, steph you are a big flirt. And I hang out with you and Shane and you two are the biggest flirts that i know and it rubs off on me. Now I am the worlds biggest flirt!' Me- 'This is not true you still have me and Shane to compete with, and I doubt that you can beat us.' O.- 'Okay, this is true.'

But in all seriousness I am shameless!!! Or so it seems, especially at work. That's how I sell all of those replays and stuff because I flirt big time. But I seriously just realized this. Me and Shane had talked about how big of a flirt he was and how everyonce in a while he stands back and realizes that he is that big of one and is like uhhh...maybe I shouldn't have done or said that. Now I know how that feels not so cool. BUt yeah.

So the other new guy is a country boy. Well from the country but not a hick, or that bad. He's a doll. I adore talking to him. And I possibly am starting to like him. This presents another problem because I'm not sure what he feels like. So.......yeah. He asked me to go to a party with him one night and I couldn't go, so I called for a raincheck. The next day we were both working (we work next door to each other) so we took our breaks together. Drove around a bit then went to Taco Bell (classy huh?). Ate food just goofed around talking and stuff, and went back to work. So the whole damn thing got blown out of perportion* some how or another in the length of about 2 hours. Then that night I went over to my cousins house and we were talking about that whole thing and she was like I'm going to tell you something and you can't tell him that I told you. So i said ok. So come to find out he had a girlfriend. YEAH. In the end he ended up breaking up with her that night. But then on Monday, I found out that I KNEW her!!! yeah bust my gut, I was so ironic it wasn't even funny! but actually it was. Any-whoo I think that whole thing isn't going to work out but whatever we'll see.


I am rolling out."

"event","okay so I really haven't wrote in a long time. I'm sitting here in the library at school. Completly and totally stupid if I do say so myself. I got bored so I got a pass out of class. lol Hey Lindsey---remember Ms. Currie? Yeah.

So tonight I get to go to Les Miserable at the Fox. I'm so excited!!!! We're taking a bus down there which is okay I guess but.....I still get to go and that is all that matters. Whoo-hooo and the tickets were only $19. 

Now onto that it is now Lent. Which I being Catholic have to give something up. So me and a whole bunch of other people are giving up cussing. It's way harder than you would ever, ever guess. I have a rubberband on my wrist and every time I say a bad word I get snapped. Let's put it this way I let my sister snap it yesterday and now I still have red stripes on my wrist.

Today I'm supposed to go after school with Shane at least, and probably Orion too, to the mall. I have to get some stuff for spirit week next week and I have to help Shane pick out a Valentines Day present for his girlfriend. whoo-hoo But I'm so excited about next week (spirit week)Wed. is cartoon day and guess who I'm going to be!!!! PEBBLES!!!!!! I'm going to dye my hair BRIGHT red and wear a really cute costume that mom is making. And Eric is going to be Bamm-Bamm. The whole story behind that is that his mom's name is Betty and my mom's name is Wilma. Therefore we ARE Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm. lol Monday is p.j. day and I was going to wear feathery shoes(like the little heels with feathers)but the shoes that I bought to make them look like that are sooooo....stripper-ish. They have the skinny clear heel and the clear platform bottoms. So I'm not sure yet, maybe I'll find some at the mall tonight.

I still have a boyfriend.......for 2 months as of today. Which he doesn't know that but.....yeah. Oh well he's been acting like a 10 year old lately so I dunno.

I have new friends that I hang out with a lot. Shane and Orion. They are SOOOOO awsome and I love them SOOOO much!!!! I totally love talking to them about most everything, and on Monday Orion cam eover to make cookies at my house. Sooo....funny. I made up the regular chocolate chip cookie dough and then he added peanut butter nad get this.......icecream. lol But they weren't too bad if you like peanut butter that is.

So I had best better get going and roam around the internet for a while. Anybody know any good sights?

Peace
Steph   

P.S.-    I'm so happy it's almost lunch time!!! Oh and Lindsey I have so much more to tell you but just not online. wink-wink

You are a musical genius... congratulations. Most people think you are a little obsessed with music, but that's okay. You don't care what other people think. You are independent, and would rather have a few good (and weird) friends than a lot of not-so-good ones. You may feel that people run down your eccentricity, but that's only because they're jealous. You will most likely become very successful with your musical talent. \m/ Rock on!

"event","<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ff6666 size=4>So today was great. For the most part anyways. So I left for school after Michael came over---I took him too. We walked into school and I went to get my parking pass which was fun cuz I <EM>COULD</EM> get it. Then went to first hour which was well.....Mr. Lee what else is there to say? Me and Krystal talked and she was majorly excited that I could now driver her around instead of her driving me. But then second hour I had gym and well we did nothing today so I sat around and talked with Eric, and Cindy and Charlie. Good stuff right? So then third hour I dozed for a while, it's math what do you expect? Then we had seminar and I finished picking out my contest music which was fun, I get to do the Lord's Prayer and some mad crazy Italian song called Danza, Danza (I think). So that was fun. Sang in fourth hour but unfortunatly our new warm up is ""Doe, a deer, a female deer, ray, a drop of golden sun........"" which I myself hate that song and movie with a passion. Sorry to all of you who love Julie Andrews. BUt then My fifth hour was okay I got to see my ""brother"" again finally I missedhim. And Cody had to tell me his New Years story about waking up on a front porch in <EM>ONLY</EM> his jeans with some naked chick next to him. He was like 'who are you?' she was like 'I'm Jennifer, who are you?' They then exchanged names and she remembered him telling her that nad that she put her number in his phone and that they well.......yeah. He (unfortunatly for him) does not. lol But I don't feel too sorry for him. The only thing I asked was 'hey did you ever think of a condom maybe?' but whatever I'm sick of babysitting (not litterally*) BUt whatever. Sixth hour was okay I suppose Meghan doesn't have it anymore which kinda pisses me off but shit happens so.....Then seventh hour was well tiring. I wanted to sleep but didn't feel like getting reduced points on the first day. So I played with Larry's hair.&nbsp;&nbsp;Pretty funny huh? Then I got out to the truck with Colleen and Courtney and Micheal and I couldn't get it started!!!! I was like NOOOOOOO!!!!!!! It was just locked (the key or whatever). So that was then okay and I went over to the little kid school after I dropped Michael off at my house (yeah how does that sound right? His car was parked there) Did some copying for Nancy and saw Cass. Yep. so.......... Then I came home and got on the computer great day I suppose.&nbsp; BUt yeah that was fun...................I need a life. I can't wait till I can start my voice lessons, then I will be occupied. So I'm gonna scoot and read a book or something. God I'm&nbsp;a dork!!</FONT></STRONG></P>

I had to be in a work at noon.which no big deal, but then I find out that we have to pull everything off of the end caps, then put them back, then price change everyting in the store and so on. Yea! Just my kind of day. So it was me and Missy working nad then James and Carla were supposed to come in at 1 and James came in 15 minutes later Carla called in sick. PERFECT!!!! All of that shit to do and now we a re one person short and I still have to close. We called Daniel and he came in (gotta love him--don't tell him I said that lol) So we then started our price changes and such things, while still doing register and stuff. Then come to find out the whole other side of the highway went dark. As in no lights, as in Wal-Mart was out of power and making everyone leave the store, and searching them before they left. All I can say I that I'm galde I didn't run over there on break. That would have sucked big time. So blah blah but me and Missy ended up staying after for an extra hour trying to finish stuff. Well long story short- we didn't.

Other things-- I love driving and I have the truck with 4 wheel drive!!!!But no muddin' for me. :( BUt I have transportation so that is all that I care.

Hope so. But you have to come back!!!!Or email me whole hellas you big meanie butt! So anyway after you left My cousin came in, then she took me over to Sonic on my break for lunch. Then she left, then Lindsey (Justin Lindsey) came in to see me, then he called my cousin and she came back up there. And each of them had like 2 other people with them then my aunt came up and her friend and it was soooooo crazy.Then the register wouldn't work it ate the replay card form and all of that jazz. MAD CRAZY I tell you. But I told James (wasn't he so cute?) that my cousin said that he was cute--which she did--and so when she came back in there he was laying it on thick. I had told him before too that he couldn't go out with her. So when he started flirting with her I was like 'James you are so awful!' he just laughted and it was pretty funny but in another way it really wasn't. But then I got off at 4.....well so did James and I ended up going to the movies with my cousin Cass and my aunt, so we tried to convince James to come but then he didn't. Butt Head. Oh well. 

So I got money for Christmas and I think that I am going to spend it on a ring. I really want a new one.

BUtu the story of the well afternoon is I have my hair done and yeas I did it myself, thank you very much little bananna curls all over and I have big dangley earings that go down past my hair (it's short, for people who don't know me) and am going to be sporting a black strappless dress with sequins down the sideand cute new heels that I bougt last night!!! Yea!!! New shoes!!!

So last night went something like getting home from school and be tired I go lay down to take a nap. Then mom walks in and............... I was in that place between sleep and awake that real nice relaxed place.......and she chucks the phone at me and says it's for me. So I answered and it was Kyle. The last time that I had talked with him was on Monday night when he came over at 11 o'clock to bring me firefighter clothes for superhero day. So whaen I answered I was 1/2 asleep so he thought that I was mad. We talked for a bit then Robert had to come over to his house to get some pliers or something like thatso I was like yeah you won't call me back. He was like yeah maybe not. Then 15-20 min later I was in that nice sleepy spot again and the phone rings I answered it and the first thing out of his mouth was ""You Lied"" cuz I said he wouldn't call back. So we talked for a while more then he had a call on the other line s o I was on hold and I was accidentally hung up on blah, blah, blah. Taht was the end of that. 
So the football game I ended up being watergirl again, which is fine because most of my friends are football boys, plus I like Tashua she's the other watergirl/manager. So after the game I went to go find mom and I found my Joseph. BIG SMILE!!!!!!! I love Joseph and I haven't seen him in forever. So I will have to continue this later......

"event","<P><FONT color=#993399>So yeah this would have to be the first entry that I have ever made in here. This week has been a long one, even with it just being 4 days long. A guy from school, Eric Watson died, he had an allergic reaction to some Vicaden that he took. Then one of my new friends, his little sister tried to commit suicide and they had to take her to the hospital. A lady that Mom works with's son was killed in a motercycle accident, my grandma had to go to the emergency room for chest pains, and then last night a guy that I was really, really close with last year, his girlfriend broke up with him. He used to be like my best friend the beginning of last year, then those two started going out and we drifted. Then last night we had this lame back to school danceand she broke up with him there. I didn't know this until I walked outside with my mom (my pretend mom) and my boyfriend. I felt so bad for him, he was leaning up aginst a car sobbing, saying how he tried to give her everything but it wasn't enough. To top it off, like Thursday was their 1 year Anniversary, and she was his ride home. So being the good friend that I try to be I vollenteer me, mom, and my boyfriend to take him home. Mind you I'm supposed to be home @ 11, it's about 10:45 @ that time and he lives on hwy. Y.&nbsp; So I call dad and tell him that we are taking a friend home and I'll explain it all later. He said that I had better be home by 11. So my mom doesn't like to drive that much, or she'd rather have other people drive, so&nbsp;I drove. The farthest I had drove her car, and that was the same day was to the back parking lot of school. Now it was whole hella dark outside and I had to go down EE to Y neither of which had I ever drove at night, let alone her car. Therre was a bit of squealing of tires around a sharp corner and a bad stop but we were all still alive. Got to his house, I got out of the car and gave him a huge hug and make him promise that he wouldn't do anything stupid, and to call me if any bad thoughts came up. He promised. So we left. Mom drove on the way home said that me and my b/f could have the backseat. lol So we talked and I let a couple tears slide out of my eyes, I was really up set about my other friend. So I got home and that would be the story of after the dance.</FONT></P>

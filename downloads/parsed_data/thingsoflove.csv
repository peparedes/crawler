"event","Through leaps and bounds of vertical sounds our stories write themselves... 



I've been taking steps.. I've been believing what I've been telling myself little by little.. 

I've been collecting lack of sleep and talking with my insomniac bunny, Pickles. 

I've become the epitome of conflusion.&nbsp; 



Pickles, also known as Avenged Viking Princess, is staring at me. I think she's on my side but it's hard to tell between the bars of her cage. Pickles has feet black from news print - she demands a fresh supply of the New York Times each and every week. I lay it out in rectangular form for her to devour and peruse the wanted ads. She rips it up, as any good consumer does, upon finishing the paper, and watches me walk by, expecting something from me.&nbsp; 



My plan is going slowly, and it's getting tiresome, and apart from a slight bite of fright that I'll let myself slide and wake up somewhere in the future without accomplishing anything that I started out wanting, I am trying to stay awake when it comes to the long term. I will be graduating some time mid-summer next year, and in the following fall I'd like to find myself in New York, going to school. I seek to leave behind everything I know and accept everything&nbsp;I have no knowledge of into my bubble. I want a bubble-widening experience. As silly as it sounds, I find myself wondering what the other side of the Mason-Dixon looks like. And I have yet to meet a person in my life who actually thinks that is going to happen. I haven't decided if that is including myself or not. 



The best laid plans are yet to be made."

Number one activity one should NOT participate in before bed: looking up the sexual predators in your area. Not conducive to a successful night's sleep.
Just a little tidbit, an FYI if you will...&nbsp;
Counting sheep? Sure. Getting a snack? Great! Counting down from 100? It works!&nbsp;
Looking up the rapists in your area - not a good idea."

"event","Let's go through this, like a piano breakdown...
Yesterday I wandered around inside my own head by way of trying to deal with people.&nbsp;
I've begun to notice how old cliche's became old cliches. A lot of them are true. Makes me want to remember what I learned in kindergarten, all those dumb phrases that were supposed to guide through life that we, inevitably, decided were dumb phrases somewhere around fifth grade.
I sponsored a child yesterday from the CCF. He is two years old, from Zambia, whose name I can't pronounce. So, accordingly, I had dreams last night of babies, wrapped in shrinkwrap up to the shoulders and paraded around in front of me. If I could afford more than thirty dollars a month, heaven knows...&nbsp;
When I am&nbsp;older I will adopt kids like there is no tomorrow.

I'm throwing a party for my friend here tomorrow. I am buying alcohol illegally and concocting desserts. My buddy offered to bring some moonshine. I wanted to pop him over the head, pack my suitcase and leave.
Which is not a usual reaction, so I'm forced to wonder and pursue this need for leaving town.

Hmm.

Work to be done."

"event","I'm very excited. Excited in a planet-humming way. Like some commercial where everything is in sync and you can't help but grin. Extremely excited. What am I excited for, you ask?&nbsp; 
We'll, I'll tell you. 
I have been searching for my dream. I know that your twenties are supposed to be this golden age where you really begin to discover yourself and get your fingers into a bunch of different pies. That particular task has been somewhat difficult for me, because - well, I didn't want to screw it up. I would concoct these ideas about where I was going to go to school and what I would study and the places I'd go and all of the fantastical people I would meet. These plans were eventually scrapped because I would let myself be convinced that it wasn't the right thing to do. 
I've been on this cycle since high school, and I'm tired of it. 
I've decided that I would rather screw up and do the wrong thing than waste my time doing nothing at all.&nbsp; 
I want to travel, and drink coffee in places I've never been before. I want to see&nbsp;foreign&nbsp;sites.&nbsp;I want to meet people I wouldn't normally have come across. I want to experience all these, and I'm excited because...&nbsp;I finally realized that it is something I have to do myself, and I'm perfectly willing to give it a shot.&nbsp; 
I suppose I got used to having things and events directed and planned out for me, in some respects. I moved out, I did the stretching-of-the-wings thing already, but it was always in my own town in a relatively safe environment.&nbsp; 
And now - I'm craving the unknown. I can't wait for next fall, when I go to New York. My body gets tingly and I can feel electricity in my fingers when I think about it. I'm not trying to escape from anything at home, I'm not being forced out, I'm not running away... I'm just ready for what is next, for working and living and going to school in New York.&nbsp; 
So - I'm excited."

I will supply two answers - one (F) coming from Enrico 'Flash 'Cristofori (those of you who don't know, based somewhat on George MacDonald Fraser's Flashman) and one (O) from an amalgam of various other characters I am prone to play.<br /><br /><lj-cut text=""See it under the cut."">1. Would you prefer to rescue or be rescued?<br />F: Rescued. Unless I am rescuing a lady in need of rescuing. But only when it's not too dangerous.<br />O: Rescue, generally. Actually... do they deserve rescue?<br /><br />2. Adventure beckons. Do you need forcing, or do you leap into action?<br />F: You'd have to shanghai me if I'm to stare into the jaws of danger.<br />O: Up and at it - there's nothing on TV.&nbsp;<br /><br />3. The phone rings. An anonymous voice says you have one minute to get out of the house, before they come for you. What do you do?<br />F: F*cking run. (Possibly while blundering through&nbsp;<em>them</em>)<br />O: Prepare myself, lay a trap and then see what they want. No need to panic.<br /><br />4. If you were attacked right now by ninjapiratezombiegoblins, what would you use to defend yourself?<br />F: A bottle? A chair leg? My fist?<br />O: A convenient weapon I make sure to keep on me at all times.<br /><br />5. What form of media would best be used to commemorate your adventures (books, movies, improvised street theatre etc)?<br />F: Novel.<br />O: UK TV Series/Mini-series.<br /><br />6. What songs would be on your soundtrack?<br />F: Everything good from the 19th century, from marching songs, to gentleman's club favourites.<br />O: Something by Bear McCreary.<br /><br />7. The world is in peril from evil scientists. Only a small band of mis-matched heroes can save it. Which side are you on?<br />F: Neither. I am at home, drinking brandy. With a girl.<br />O: I appear to be on the side of evil scientists. Accidentally. By they're not actually evil, as such. Or I'm working to help the mis-matched heroes in secret.&nbsp;<br /><br />8. When picking a stylish evening outfit, how much does practicality become a consideration?<br />F: Not much. It has braid and everything.<br />O: It has to look good, but conceal plenty of gadgets, weaponry, armour and the useless bits easily removable.<br /><br />9. When picking a practical adventuring outfit, how much does style become a consideration?<br />As above... so below...<br /><br />10. As sexual tensions simmer during the tango, fortunes are won and lost in the casino and secrets are bought or stolen in the bar, where are you and what are you doing?<br />F: At the casino, with my tango partner, ignoring everything at the bar except the drinks.<br />O: You don't need to know where I am. But I&nbsp;<em>am</em>&nbsp;watching.<br /><br />11. How much of a team do you ideally prefer to work with, or do you usually operate alone?<br />F: As many people willing to give their lives for me as possible.<br />O: Two-three close associates, a number of close friends around the place and a network of contacts.<br /><br />12. What sort of future prospects would your love interest or sidekick have? Is it worth them enquiring about the pension fund?<br />F: Are they as good as me at running away?<br />O: Fairly good - they won't go before I do unless there are... complications.<br /><br />13. Trapped in the barn and tied to a post. Your captor takes some of the tools down from the wall to sharpen, in preparation for your impending DOOM, leaving you alone for a few moments. What do you do now?<br />F: Gibber, hope the tools magically sever the rope and continue pleading for my life when the captor returns.<br />O: Is the captor an idiot? If Y, attempt to use the tools to cut my bonds, but remain appearing to be tied to the post and catch the captor unawares. If N, don't fall for the obvious trap and instead work on cutting my bonds using the blade I've secreted about my person.<br /><br />14. News of the death of your sidekick/partner/love interest reaches you by letter. How could this have happened?<br />F: They didn't run away when I scarpered. Their own fault really.<br />O: They didn't listen to my advice... or I didn't do my job.<br /><br />15. Revenge is a dish best served how?<br />F: From many miles away.<br />O: To someone else. I just do what needs doing.<br /><br />16. An anonymous letter invites you to a clandestine meeting. Do you go?<br />F: Of course not. I stay at home with brandy and girl.<br />O: If I can do it, I attend in secret/from a distance, if not, I will send a trusted contact who knows what they're doing.<br /><br />17. What is the correct number of knives?<br />F: None. I don't like being cut.<br />O: How long is a piece of string?<br /><br />18. What would be your perfect date?<br />F: Safety, big dinner, nobody else.<br />O: Out in the countryside, we're alone, there's lots of stuff to do.<br /><br />19. If the perfect date was interrupted by Zombie Apocalypse, how would you react?<br />F: Barricade, wait for authorities to deal with it. If necessary - run.<br />O: Team up with my date to stop the Apocalypse or at the very least survive. Out in the country - it's easier. Fewer zombies.<br /><br />20. Did your perfect date already include a Zombie Apocalypse before question 19? In hindsight, would you have changed your answer?<br />What?<br /><br />21. Have you been on many dates which would have been improved by global Armageddon?<br />F: Many.<br />O:&nbsp;What is your obsession with Armageddon?&nbsp;<br /><br />22. How competently could you disguise yourself?<br />F: Very. I can pass for plenty of people... except perhaps women.<br />O: Not always very well. I tend to prefer covers rather than disguises.<br /><br />23. Is there space for romance in the course of your adventures?<br />F: It is a necessity to offset the actual adventuring.<br />O: Yes.<br /><br />24. How well do you cope with sudden shifts in genre and pace?<br />F: Not well. But I probably have to.<br />O: Well.<br /><br />25. If you could pick anywhere to have exciting adventures, where would it be?<br />F: At home. With a girl. And brandy. How many times do I have to tell you?<br />O: Turkey... Middle East... maybe a little more around the Med.</lj-cut><br />&nbsp;"

"event","<div>(It appears the posterous was down for a little bit when I posted this there, so just adding to LJ for... well... people actually reading it! Also putting it under a cut because it's long)<br /><br />So, time for another set of reviews to spring forth from my infinitely awesome head. Since starting work I've had a slow time of reading, so Adrian Tchaikovsky's <i>Dragonfly Falling&nbsp;</i>and Tom Holland's&nbsp;<i>Millenium</i> took a while to get through. Fortunately it all took off a few weeks ago and in a short space of time I finished off&nbsp;<i>Millenium</i> and rattled through&nbsp;<i>Azincourt&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Best Served Cold.</i> Here is how awesome they were:<br /><br />&nbsp;</div><div><lj-cut text=""Reviews""><div><b><i>Dragonfly Falling -&nbsp;</i>Adrian Tchaikovsky</b><div><b><br /></b><div>I'd taken time to re-read the first in the 'Shadows of the Apt' series (Empire in Black and Gold) before moving onto this, so everything flowed very nicely. There was plenty of what was excellent from the first book and much that was new and also excellent. In fantasy terms, Tchaikovsky's work is refreshingly refreshing from the de-rigeur dark and dirty fantasy I've mainly been reading these days. It has some of the same threads, but is much lighter and more... classic.<b><br /> </b></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>But with more insects. It took me a little while to get used to this chitinous set-up when first reading and then re-reading&nbsp;<i>Empire,&nbsp;</i>but by the time of&nbsp;<i>Dragonfly</i> everything had become much more familiar and much more clear. I've not been entirely satisfied in some aspects of the rigorous differences and definitions of a particular insect-kinded and the fact that the heroes (and anti-heroes) are a somewhat unusual lot has not entirely washed this away. Nevertheless, the way that it's written and the delivery of the story is brilliant and it marries both plot and characters (and writing style) most pleasingly.</div> <div>&nbsp;</div><div>Concerns aside, which I would consider to be mere disagreements with style anyway, I can only recommend this book and indeed the entire series. And anything else Adrian might possibly produce in the future. Clever, well-paced, gripping and unexpectedly unexpected, this is both familiar and fresh and thus exactly what anyone could ever want. Go. Read it.</div> <div>&nbsp;</div><div>Even better, go to the book-signing for the third book which is out tomorrow. You can find details on Mr Tchaikovsky's site, specifically&nbsp;<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://shadowsoftheapt.com/blog/214"">here</a>. Do it. Seriously - do it.</div> <div><br />&nbsp;</div><div><i><b>Millenium: The End of the World and the Forging of Christendom</b></i><b> - Tom Holland</b></div><div><b><br /></b></div><div>Tom Holland, an English graduate from Cambridge, has previously written two excellent dippings into Ancient History -&nbsp;<i>Rubicon</i> and&nbsp;<i>Persian Fire</i>. The former is about the end of the Roman Republic and the ascension of an Emperor to its rule and the latter is about the wars of the Greeks and Persians. They were both excellent,&nbsp;<i>Persian Fire</i> in particular, since not only did they deliver and excellent assessment of the history, but forged it into a strong and compelling narrative that engaged the reader and kept the history interesting and faithful. He has not shied away from making it a tale relevant both to us and, if they were still alive, the ancient Greeks and Persians.<b><br /> </b></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The same dedication and eye for the interesting, fascinating and and downright awesome he has brought to the few centuries before and after the first millenium AD. Taking a look at the world of Europe from the end of the 9th to the early 12th centuries, Tom Holland explores how everything, seen through the spectacles of the impending second coming of Christ and the Apocalypse, was changed and altered and how the early medieval states emerged into a recognisably medieval world.</div> <div>&nbsp;</div><div>Holland is never afraid to let you know how it might all have seemed to the people at the time. What was at stake, what was going on and why it all mattered. That is a perspective often absent from drier histories and it can be missing from good narrative histories too - and it is ever so important. The thing that can always block our understanding of the past is either the dismissing of the concerns of the people of the time (as since not having been vindicated, say) or simply be unaware or lack understanding of them.</div> <div>&nbsp;</div><div>Most importantly, the book, and his previous two forays, are highly readable whatever your background or preferences. By and of itself it's just so damn interesting and fascinating - an engaging read. So if you feel that you want to get to know the Greeks, the Romans or the Medieval Europeans better, you could do far worse than follow Tom Holland on his historical journeys.</div> <div>&nbsp;</div><div>The books are historically approved by me - have no fear!</div><div><br />&nbsp;</div><div><i><b>Azincourt</b></i><b> - Bernard Cornwell</b></div><div><b><br /></b></div><div>Bernard Cornwell, of Sharpe and much other fame, has been concentrating mainly on his new Anglo-Saxon series, focusing on the Anglo-Saxon and Viking clashes in Britain during the reign of King Alfred. He has, however, taken time out to write the odd other book, in between - one more Sharpe and... and Azincourt. Cornwell has clearly thoroughly enjoyed the Grail Quest series, which mixed the Hundred Years' War in with some Grail-questing and a love of the English longbowman, and so the English longbowman returns in Azincourt. He's not the same archer, but he may as well be (the one in the Grail Quest series was Thomas of Hookton, the protagonist of Azincourt is Nicholas Hook) and the character is not otherwise too dissimilar...<b><br /> </b></div><div><br />&nbsp;But just like Nate Starbuck in the Starbuck Chronicles is a bit of an American Sharpe (possibly a little weedier) and no worse for it, so Nick Hook is no less an interesting character to follow the story with. Much more rooted in history, but with Cornwell's excellent eye for the common and normal struggles of a... commoner, Azincourt is a pleasure to read. Cornwell's writing hasn't changed too much in the last decade (though it has come on quite a lot since some two-three decades ago) and all the marks of Mr. Cornwell passing by are there - commoners making it up from the dirt to become someone, generals and kings mucking in with the common soldier a bit, and plenty of revenge and love.</div> <div>&nbsp;</div><div>Frankly, I can't fault it - I can tell what's going to come, I can see the broad brush strokes of the Cornwell novel canvas... and yet every novel is no less fun, interesting and capable of offering a little surprise every now and then. Besides that, there is also the interesting and engaging take on Azincourt which takes into account both the latest historical thoughts on the matter, and a dash of Cornwell's level understanding of history which lends a veracity to it that is pretty damn nice to have.</div> <div>&nbsp;</div><div>You won't find anything new if you've read a few of Cornwell's novel, but you'll find the similar done extremely well as usual and looking at the very interesting battle of Azincourt. Well worth a look! (And it's out in convenient paperback now)</div> <div><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</div><div>As a side-note - I have to say that I'd wish Cornwell would do something in the style and feel of <i>Gallows Thief</i>, which is much more of a detective novel - and he's really good at it. Perhaps after he's put Alfred the Great to rest? I can only hope so. And for Mr. Cornwell himself - please don't die, George MacDonald Fraser did it before writing more Flashman and it was very very sad.</div> <div><br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</div><div>And now, at last, to the principal act of today, the one we have all been waiting for (well, okay, probably mostly Joe, since I've already told him I'll be singing his praises) - so here it is:</div> <div><br />&nbsp;</div><div><i><b>Best Served Cold -</b></i>&nbsp;<b>Joe Abercrombie</b></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>So, Joe has already delivered us the&nbsp;<i>First Law</i> trilogy which I have previously waxed lyrical on in my LJ - flick back through the pages to see what I have to say about them. For the rest of you, I will summarise: Dark, clever, brimming with character and a must-read. In fact, go do it now. Buy his books, and read them.</div> <div>&nbsp;</div><div>Done? There we go, I couldn't have put it better.</div><div><br />&nbsp;<i>Best Served Cold </i>is brilliant. It really is. The key thing to remember though, is that it isn't the&nbsp;<i>First Law&nbsp;</i>trilogy - Mr. Abercrombie has, in my opinion, done the right thing in making it a stand-alone novel in the same world. It takes up the same geo-political sweep of the trilogy, but looks at it from a different perspective. As he said at the signing - he wanted to do a story about revenge, and he wanted to do a story that had a bit of the Italian city-state thing in it. It's a good thing that he had Styria in his world then!</div> <div>&nbsp;</div><div>So it's a book that you could be disappointed with if you just wanted something from the&nbsp;<i>Second Law&nbsp;</i>trilogy (not that it exists, but clearly some people wanted it to) and it is a different story, with a different feel and a different structure. But done by the same brilliant author. Its division into essentially seven linked stories following a broader plot made it not only interesting but actually quite easy to read - I could take one of the sections on at a time and didn't feel that I had to rush through the whole thing and get all the plot in one mouthful (indeed, I slowed down after the first three parts in order to savour it more). The characters are once again excellent - they are a different lot to those in the&nbsp;<i>First Law</i> (although a few cameos are promoted to starring roles for this book) and they play out excellently. Superficially you might argue that the Northman of the novel, Shivers, is just Logen Ninefingers with a few tweaks - but he's not, he's a northerner, like Logen, and shares some of the character, but he is very much different and developing character, and so with the rest of them.</div> <div><br />&nbsp;The principal character, Monzcarro Murcatto, the one seeking the revenge, is most interesting of all. I have read accusations that she is more about plot than character, but reading through it became more and more clear, indeed the novel was designed to reveal, what she was really about. And she is consistent - she is not one person in one chapter, and a different one the next, but she also goes through... well, what she goes through. One can't expect the character to remain unchanged, and one can't expect them to not be viewed differently by each of the other characters. It's all there though. It really is.</div> <div><br />&nbsp;And while one does not find any of the characters entirely endearing (well, apart from Nicomo Cosca, and who couldn't find him endearing?) and while you might not necessarily be able to identify with the characters (and I've always asked - why should you have to?) - what they are and what they do is extremely interesting. How they do it, how they go through it, how they are unexpectedly affected by the events - it's all really really good.</div> <div><br />&nbsp;So it's tight, it's direct and at the same time multi-faceted, characterful, dark, funny, unexpected... all the things we've come to love from Abercrombie. Or will come to love if we haven't read anything by him yet. Fortunately <i>Best Served Cold</i> is a stand-alone and an excellent entry into Abercrombie's writing - so go on, get it, read it, and when you have enjoyed it go out and buy the&nbsp;<i>First Law&nbsp;</i>trilogy and read that. You won't be disappointed.</div> <div><br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</div><div>P.S. I won't say that&nbsp;<i>Best Served Cold</i> is better than the&nbsp;<i>First Law</i>. Nor will I say that the&nbsp;<i>First Law</i> is better than&nbsp;<i>Best Served Cold</i> - they are different books, and they're not necessarily in the same category, really. They are both excellent. They are both masterpieces of story-telling and character-drawing. They need to both be read and appreciated. And secretly I rather hope that the further books that Mr. Abercrombie produces (be it stand-alone or trilogy or series) will be a slightly different genre, a slightly different sort of story. What about a detective novel? A horror story? I'd love to see what Joe can do with that. I suspect the results would be most juicy.</div></div></div> <div><br />&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div></lj-cut><br />So there we are, a round-up of what I've been reading. I've still got a long shopping list of reads to do - Adrian Tchaikovsky's third novel is ripe for the reading, followed by the much-anticipated and hotly-expected&nbsp;<i>Dust of Dreams</i> by Steven Erikson, together with some Space Captain Smith, Scott Bakker's start to his second trilogy, a few Warhammer/40k novels for light reading and Bernard Cornwell's fifth in the Saxons series...</div> <div><br />&nbsp;</div><div>Busy busy.</div>"

"event","<lj-raw><p>For cyclists, there is no mercy. Were I some Roman Emperor, I would issue an edict along the lines of not allowing cyclists one iota of mercy and calling upon all true and faithful citizens to met out my vengeance at any sign of wrongdoing from the miscreants.</p><p>For a cyclist is one who has sold his very soul to Satan, herded by the promise of 'saving the planet'. In return for the lower carbon emissions and additional exercise, they are bound by the diabolical contract to inconvenience the lives of driver and most hallowed pedestrian alike. To ride, with malicious intent, upon the pavement, mere inches beside a designated cyclist lane, yet in obstruction of all pedestrian activity. And, whereupon should a pedestrian rightly chastise them, they expell forth from their cursed mouths a stream of cussing and rudeness unknown to all but the darkest inner circles of hell.</p><p>Not that they have much choice, they have, after all, signed the contract that does this to them.</p><p><br/>Enough on that, onwards to politics and politicians. Some time ago, I was discussing with Helen, Joff (both of whom are now married... to each other) and probably Gareth, on the matter of an acceptable society we would wish to live in, and have others live in. I would call it a utopian idea, but it's rather more than that, because it is very much achievable, and also sensible.</p><p>Helen voiced very good ideas regarding public service and so on, and I would leave it to her to disseminate that part of the party plan. I brought my own idea to the table, centring on what politicians should be about. Were we given free choice, and given the technological advances available around us today, an actual Democracy, that is a direct democracy, would be preferable. Well, me being a technical tzarist, a monarchy would be preferable, but that is not an actual practical view. Nevermind.</p><p>Direct democracy though. It is now, with technology, easy enough to put out issues, debates and so on, to the public with good speed and a good degree of transparency. Thus - technically every proposed motion or law, would be debated and each one voted on by the electorate (which would require one to be a citizen... see also, Helen on how citizenship should be achieved). Furthermore, over the course of one's life, every citizen would be required to sit on the 'council' (e.g. Athenian <em>boule</em>) and so on. Jury service... etc etc.</p><p>But... we may have to stick with British Parliamentary democracy of the representative-republic flavour. Fair enough. There have been various details revealed about MP spending recently, and it has spurned the Commons to table and debate a motion regarding MP pay and expenses. Predictably, the majority voted to retain the gravy train. I am of the opinion, that an MP serves her electorate and the country. The service is, ideally, selfless, for one should do it for the love of the country, the people, the wish to improve things, set things right, and so on. That sort of direction is, I think, what the mindset should be. So, bearing that in mind, MPs should be paid just enough to allow them to carry out their duties, and by that, I mean, expenses for London (or wherever regional parliaments may be based) lodgings, unless such are already owned as a primary home, and a salary just a little above the minimum wage.</p><p>Maybe take it even further and, should they hold any other job, subtract what they get from that, from their MP salary. Simple enough. And why not? Such an arrangement would bring one closer to the truth of anyone potentially being an MP - rich or poor, they will be given enough to live at the minimum wage (and it is intentionally an incentive for the minimum wage to be adequate) and perform in their duty because that's what they want to do.</p><p>I think this is probably enough for a resurgent post. Hope you enjoy it, and throw the juicy ranting right back at me!<br/> </p>

Tonnes of fun was had, despite every kind of harsh weather, and we had a great time together.</p><p>Best people in the world ever. Yeah.</p><p><br/>I've also been watching 'Supersizers Go...' which is a BBC show where Giles Coren (food critic) and Sue Perkins (comedienne) go and eat period food for a week as well as doing the sort of things people did in those periods to boot. They've done Elizabethan, Seventies, Regency and so on. It is a brilliant series, now sadly ending - but not only do you learn stuff about different stuff people ate in British history but also get great comedy TV. You see, at the end of the day, Sue and Giles are a bunch of raucous revelers and come up with amusing and surreal things while doing the dining and dancing (or other things they do).</p><p>Light-hearted, informative, amusing - the series is once again indicative of excellent TV still to be had. So go and catch the few episodes still left on BBC iPlayer. You won't be disappointed.<br/> </p>

"event","<lj-raw><p>Just caught up with this on BBC iPlayer and it entertained and amused me thoroughly. It's an excellent piece of TV - extremely well-written, terrifically acted by all and a complete pleasure to watch. Andrea Riseborough's portrayal of young Margaret Thatcher really makes you believe the drama played out. Not only does it acutely highlight Thatcher's struggle in the 50s to get a seat and then get elected, but it does so without being contrived or stuffy or too modernist. It's a perfect example of what the BBC is still capable of producing in its programming. It is a shame that it was first aired on BBC Four rather than to fanfare on One - at least it is still available on BBC iPlayer for a few days.</p><p>Do watch it - you won't be disappointed.<br/> </p>

"event","<lj-raw><p>So. Now with another level complete and boss defeated (exams) I have a little time to spend with computer games.</p><p>This has included, for now, Assassin's Creed, Prince of Persia: Warrior Within and Mass Effect. I will for the most part be talking about the first two, as they were replays. Mass Effect is very very good so far - it's cinematic, feels like having a good bit of roleplaying and shootiness and whatnot.</p><p>Assassin's Creed and Warrior Within then. Both offerings by Ubisoft Montreal in a similar genre of a combination of death defying acrobatics and death dealing combat. What the Prince of Persia (renewed with Sands of Time) brought to our computers was new, innovative and extremely satisfying - the power to alter time itself during the game. This manifested mainly in being able to rewind 10 seconds of time and slow down everything around you. It transformed the platformy gameplay that already had so much going for it - the acrobatics, puzzles and fights were damn fun - and made it more diverse, interesting and allowed the developers to make much more challenging fights and acrobatic puzzles. After all... you could just quickly replay it at low in-game cost and without being thrown back to a much earlier checkpoint.</p><p>Anyway, Sands of Time had great gameplay, an interesting story and was also quite pretty. The Prince was an unsure but charismatic character and there was some interesting character development going on. All this changed with the second installment offered just over a year after release of Sands of Time. In Warrior Within the semi-rock Eastern motif music was swapped out for hard rock and the Prince had become a fringe-wearing emo given to calling people bitch and cutting off monster heads. The creator of the original Prince of Persia games and a developer of Sands of Time said that he didn't like the direction the game had gone and had no part in.</p><p>Boo. Or actually not. Since the above is a first impression - after replaying the game a second time one realises that it's really rather good and the apparently poor and uncharacteristic decisions make perfect sense. The Prince has a rough time after the first game and a man hunted and haunted by fate - he decides, in a rather haphazard and rash manner to fix it, springing after the first rumour he hears from a wise old man. During the time he discovers much more about himself, not only some of the worse aspects of his darker side, but also about fate and his attitude to it. Oh... and he discovers more love. If you play Warrior Within, you do actually see bits of the old Prince, it shines through and his character is consistent. Just coloured by the events between the games. By the end, he has changed, or begun to change, he has become wiser in many ways.</p><p>It fits perfectly into the third part, The Two Thrones, where he more directly confronts his dark side. He is faced with death and betrayal all around and his hopes, so brightened by changing his fate, dashed against the rocks of the inexorable. So he has to come to grips with it all. And, indeed, does. The journey is thus a very well-told story and it needs all three parts for it. The Two Thrones does bring back many more thematic and ideological elements from the first (not to mention excellent humour) and really showcases the character of the Prince. I recommend the Sands of Time trilogy to any person who has not played it - available on consoles and PC.</p><p>Assassin's Creed then. Or 'Faffing About Creed' as Yahtzee of Zero Punctuation fame would call it. And interesting idea and branch of the gameplay ideas from Prince of Persia. It is ultimately ruined by plot, gameplay and GUI decisions. Not completely ruined... marred I suppose. Playing an Assassin, Altair, killing people the holy land, is great - its an interesting and detailed plot. Except that the developers, clearly casting their minds forward to one or more future sequels, add a Sci-Fi future element to it, pretty much completely ruining the authentic Crusades/Middle East feeling of the game. To add to that, the fun bits of the game - the 'Faffing About' is interrupted by the constraints of plot and 'mini-games' in both assassinations and the investigation leading up to the. Thief gave you plot in overhearing conversations and pick-pocketing guards without needing to limit it to minigame mechanics and kept the gameplay and story varied by allowing you to go and take it how you wanted. Assassin's Creed by all rights should have taken advantage of the experience presented there and nabbed it. They didn't. You get sick of the pick-pocketing missions, the interrogation missions and the flag-chasing. And the fact that you get a limiting and unhelpful cut-scene before each Assassination limiting your movement and abilities. And the GUI is tailored to consoles and is thus... consoley in the extreme and just doesn't give the game the right feel in my extreme. Thankfully the PC version lets you customise it a bit. But at the end of the day, the really fun bits - running around rooftops and knifing guards is quite a small part of the game and its a shame. It could have had so much more.</p><p>The Prince of Persia games are, in my opinion, better by far. AC appears to offer more freedom, but it is just an illusion and the linearity of PoP makes it actually very compelling. The story-telling, design and gameplay flow so much better in PoP too. But AC is also worth your time and money.</p><p>So there we go. Some thoughts. For mulling over. Mmmm.<br/> </p>

"event","<lj-raw><p>So. I have finished this 'examination' malarkey yesterday. Curiously it hasn't quite seeped into my brain, any kind of change. I mean... I am writing this at 9am the next day, after having been awake for an hour. And despite the cracking Schools Dinner I had last night - our tutors are rather awesome and really did lavish us with things and stuff. The menu was exquisite and one of the best pieces of fillet stake I've had was served up for the main, followed by a delicious brioche for pudding (mmmm strawbreries) and an excellent chinwag over a cracking bottle of 18 year single malt. We did quite well for gulping down the bottle, even some of the girls (who dominate History in our year) enjoyed a bit of it.</p><p>In short, the dinner was a resounding success. Made all the better for one our tutors being back (he'd been stolen from us by King's London from the New Year) and everyone being jolly jolly.</p><p>Now just two of us from the flat finishing today. I suspect that when we're all done <em>then </em>I can feel the appropriate senses of whatever and things. And glitter. Oh the confetti-like glitter. The right devil to get out of one's hair and clothes and everything...<br/> </p>

Before I managed to get all the numbers off the old phone... about half of them are specifically on the phone, rather than the sim card. Boo.

"event","<lj-raw><p>Why is buying a mobile phone so hard these days?</p><p>Sure... contracts are simple. You tell the company that you want a cool phone, they give it to you. The downside is that you have to pay extortionate amounts of money monthly. I don't use my phone like that thankyouverymuch. So I have to go with pay-as-you-run-around-screaming.</p><p>That is where the shops confuzzle you to death. What I want is a phone... just a phone, with nothing in particular. To make calls etc. I alreay have a sim-card. It has a nice number. I am used to the number.</p><p>I walk into a shop and look at a phone roughly the replacement of my current one. But with a camera. ""How much is that?"" - ""19.99"" - ""Oh, that's rather good."" - ""But only if you buy &#xA3;10 airtime on T-mobile."" Wh... what? ""So how much is the <em>phone</em>?"" - ""69.99."" - ""Oh. Can I take the T-mobile card out and put my Vodafone one in?"" - ""No. They're locked."" - ""So how much is it on Vodafone?"" - ""29.99. Uh... plus the &#xA3;10 top-up."" ""*leaves shop*""</p><p>I understand all the corporate whoring. Various operators subsidise variously, etc. etc., at the end of the day it should be less complicated. I should probably check if I can buy the Vodafone deal and then call them up and ask to transfer my number and credit etc. Which would be awfully nice.</p><p>The reason I am buying a new one is because the battery on the old one has died a slow death and is now dying an extra death. And my charger is long past its date and the wire is largely mangled. A replacement charger and battery cost together about 30-40 quid, so getting a new phone, with a few more shiny things, is possibly a good idea.</p><p>Or would be, if it was easier.</p><p><em>Please send your free phones on the back of a postcard to the usual address.<br/></em> </p>

"event","<lj-raw><p>So there is this thing with Joanne Rowling and Warner Bros. suing Steve Vander Ark over the book-version of the lexicon that he intends to publish. It has come to the big hot trial stage and there is all the fighting over it now going on. It is all a rather sorry business and while I am generally not on friendly terms with Harry Potter, at least it's not rubbish. Just middling. Rowling however, really is rubbish, and my disdain is highlighted (as you may have noticed) by refusing to use her more 'hip' name.</p><p>Let us briefly look at some of the stuff going on here. Mr. Ark has spent quite a lot of time compiling this <em>Harry Potter Lexicon</em> thing on the internet. Now he intends to take it, and publish it as a book. On paper. For reference. Cool. A bit extreme for... you know... Harry Potter, but then Potter does attract an unusual number of nutters. Miss Rowling, on the other hand, has brought a case against him on the basis of copyright etc. - saying that he is basically stealing all her stuff, repackaging it, and planning to get rich on the profits of not much work. Her work has been ""plundered"" she says and that the suit has ""really decimated the demands of my creative work"". Poor girl.</p><p>From my perspective, she is throwing a hissy fit because someone else is bringing out a lexicon before she's brought out her own 'definitive' Pottercyclopedia or whatever. She is claiming he's being a nasty man, profiting from her hard work etc. etc. blah blah. Is he really? Out of curiosity, I had a look at the web-based lexicon and as far as I can tell, it is a rather impressive work. It most certainly is not a copy &amp; paste job - at most he's got relevant quotations for various entries, much of the work is indeed his own, as he has compiled, analysed and systematised  the many different aspects of the Potter universe. I suspect that the book if anything goes further than that.</p><p>It is, I suppose, possible that Rowling has a case. She may have a chance of winning. But by no means does she hold the moral high-ground. She has earned her millions from the sales, she's whored her legacy out to make a bloody theme-park in Florida and Mr. Ark and his publishers are making a print run of just 10,000 books. Given that a great deal of the Potter fans regard Rowling as some sort of living saint, I don't doubt that even if they buy Ark's lexicon, they'll also buy whatever Rowling produces. Given the mindless support they give her, they will probably boycott Ark's book anyway.</p><p>A victory for Ark and his publishers is furthermore important for at least keeping the general field of derivative works open. The compilation of such reference literature should never be undermined because an outside perspective on a work is incredibly important. Even if the author doesn't give consent. So long as it is not simply a load of copy-pasted passages (though even that I would personally let slip) then it has an important part to play.</p><p><br/><strong>Further thoughts.</strong><br/>Rowling has attracted a fair number of parodies and clones and that brings up an interesting discussion of the use of clones, and indeed of characters from other's people's works. To my mind, there should be no legal bar to someone taking someone else's character and using them in their own fiction. It may be rude, it might debase the character - but at the end of the day all you have is someone else's take on the character. If it has a following - they obviously prefer that particular author's interpretation. If not - then it isn't as good. A publisher isn't necessarily going to risk publishing something on just the basis that it has the character (they'll check at least if it is good in itself, or appeals to local audience for example). Tanya Grotter, Harry's Russian counterpart, is far more relevant to Russians, and is written with a Russian cultural background in mind - many of the elements are borrowed and Potter itself has been read widely in Russian. That is is competition should have spurred Rowling to either better her Potter or accept that it can't please everyone. Dmitry Yemets didn't just sponge off Rowling, he did... you know... actually write his own book. That he borrowed elements from Rowling's writers is a tribute to her (though I can't think why there needs to be any). His books are successful because they are in some cases preferred, in some cases enjoyed in parallel.</p><p>Everyone wins.</p><p>Now feel free to argue with me, as I am sure there are more issue to address.<br/> </p>

'Last Argument of Kings' takes the stories of Logen Ninefingers, Jezal dan Luthar, Sand dan Glokta and Bayaz, the First of the Magi, to lengths and depths of unexpected magnitude. And then he positively f*cks around with everything in every way imaginable and at the end you are left with the impression that this man, and this man only, knows how to do awesome characters.</p><p>There is plenty of the expected, the logical, the understandable, which only serves to contrast the complete f*ckery that goes on when Joe pulls all the stops out. And... well... when you've finished it, it all makes sense. In a way. There is no Deus Ex Machina, it is very pointedly absent.</p><p>All the previous components are present and never let down, either. Excellent battles and fights. Check! The grim, deliciously unpleasant tortured musings of the crippled Inquisitor. Check! Bucketloads of quality black humour. Check!</p><p>I cannot emphasise enough how much all of you need to read Abercrombie's trilogy. The G.R.R. Martins are asleep, the Scott Lynches are outclassed, the Steven Eriksons are looking a little more worried and insecure and wishing they had more guards on the throne-room and everyone else is considering quitting now, while people have liked them.</p><p>Okay.

But you get what I am trying to say, you're all clever.</p><p>Oh, and dammit, Joe has demonstrated, and you get to it after its all soaked in after completing the third book, exactly how to do 'wizards' or 'mages'.

I have concluded Mary Renault's masterful 'Funeral Games'. A fictional account of the state of affairs following Alexander The Great's death in Babylon 323 BC. Very enjoyable book.

It pains a very good picture of the tensions, concerns and trepidations of the period. Portrays the characters quite vividly and gives a pretty good account of what events may have transpired and how.

On the other hand, I was puzzled by various things. She lends quite a significant portion of her account to the women of the period. And what women they were - Olympias, mother of Alexander and nearly as formidable as the man himself, Euridykie, pushed forth by the sense of Royal blood flowing in her veins, Kleopatra, sister of Alexander, carrying his heritage and Roxanne, Alexander's Bactrian wife and mother of one of his successors, the baby Alexander IV. All terrific characters and stepping up to play the politics game...

... but she's given them a good deal of page time while, it seems, missing out on more detail behind Eumenes, Seleucos, Antigonos and Demetrios, all great characters who had much to do in the period. Eumenes' unfortunate betrayal and death happens off-screen like in some Greek play, Antigonos and Demetrios' conquests aren't touched upon and Seleucos' unbelievable and brilliant success in the East is completely missed out.

Perhaps she felt that she had not the scope for those adventures, which I think is fair enough. But it must be rectified, good fiction accounts of the above need to be written. Yes.

Ptolemy gets his dues though, perhaps he's coloured a little too rosily than he deserves, but its a good closing to that chapter of history that she's written.

"event","Why hello there. I have decided to grace my lj with more of a fluffykittenness than airportangryness and therefore present a few words on the current state of affairs in my life of reading things.

Can't say I've had all that much time to actually do any reading, but now that my thesis and Albion are done (interrupted by Scott Lynch's second as they were) I have time once more. I was pleased to walk into Borders Oxford and discover Naomi Novik's Empire of Ivory on their shelves. There. In paperback. Early (barring US exports).

Snaffled. Reading.

The fourth is up to scratch, but half-way through I am finding things to nitpick about. All things considered, and despite the DANGER, it is far more of a calm cruise compared to the other two. It feels more episodic and has so far less focus than the previous, its overarching doom not quite impacting enough I feel. Still, half of it to read, so I will get on with it.

I have left the country. Last Argument of Kings arrives on the bookshelves. Joe Abercrombie's publishers obviously hate me. Still, it means I will have the most exciting conclusion of his exceptional trilogy awaiting my return to the UK in a fortnight. If there are still those of you who have not read Joe Abercrombie's work or put it on your lists... why not? Do it. Do it now.

Finally, Steven Erikson's next offering, Toll the Hounds, looks like a post-uni do now, with the date going back to August. How very cruel. I feel I must fill in the gaps by re-reading the series again, which I have actually failed to do, despite its brilliance.

And finally, Funeral Games, by Mary Renault. She's been doing a line in Historical Fiction set in Ancient Greece. Why I had not got onto her earlier is a mystery, but her last books in the Alexander the Great series, covering the aftremath of his death, comes highly recommended by Robin Lane Fox, that lecturer paragon of Exciting! teaching. I will be moving onto evaluating that once I've finished more Temeraire.

I am hoping that I will get hold of more things to read, its certainly been some time since I've read extensively outside my very favourite narrow focus of historical fiction and fantasy, so I may well pop out. Except that what beckons to me is the Boris Akunin series about Erast Fandorin. Historically-set mystery series. In Russian.

But then again, I don't feel like reading anything heavy or what I would see as pretentious... Danger and Excitement are the order of the day."

Apparently we have a new President in Russia. Dmitry Medvedev. Should be interesting. As I have said before, it's not all about Putin, its about the party, and Western media is too hung up on person-politics. So Medvedev has a chance of being very very interesting - will he stick to the party guns, how will he adapt to the situation, will he actually have a hand in running the damn thing and will he be as popular as Putin?

One hopes eventually we'll get our country sorted out, I am looking forward to working on that problem in the future. When I have... you know, billions of pounds and am being hunted by the FSB through Eastern Europe.

It always comes back to me. I have this irrational hate that I can't shake off and it isn't exactly based on much I suppose. Possibly subconscious stuff, I don't know, I'm no Jung.

Flip-flops. Detestable things. I can't stand this most unpleasant and unsightly footwear. I mean, I've even worn them once or twice and they're damned uncomfortable. No support, no style, no... anything. And yet people insist on wearing them, and not just in the summer, some people wear them whenever they please.

I just want to rip them off people's feet and sacrifice them to the ducks. Or shout at people for having ridiculous footwear.



What's wrong with me?

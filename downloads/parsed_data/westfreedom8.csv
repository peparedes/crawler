So we stood out in the rain and got drenched! lol Then we came in side and listened to some music and Jess wrote an email to Rachel. lol Then we ate and went to the basketball court afterwards and talked to Mike. We walked around alittle and sat and talked. Then her mom came and got her. It was a great day all in all. 

Later dad stopped in and gave me my paycheck. Tomorrow I don't have to work! But I'll be totally bored!! Jess starts work tomorrow! Good luck Jess!! Well ttyl"

"event","So since the last time I've updated this nothing new has really happened. I mean I'm still working at World of wheels and down at the farm as much as possiable. We're getting close to moving in. Get this.....my dad gives the bedroom with the ""secret stairway"" so that way when I come home really late after being out with friends I can sneak upstairs and not wake him up. lol Thanks dad....I hope you know what your doing! 19 more days until I'm sixteen!!! Then I can drive! O yea.....Five more weeks and I get the braces off!! I think I'm  more excited about that! 

So yesterday was the best day every for me for awhile. Jess came down to borrow my movie and she wanted to go for a walk, so we walked down to the new store. She was so nice she bought me a drink since it was so hot! Then we walked back to the church and sat and talked for like 20 mins. It was really nice to see an old friend and be able to talk to her about everything and anything. Devon if you read this sorry I haven't been able to call ya....I've been kinda busy and I guess you have been too. Congrats on the new gf!!!! Hope it lasts a long time!

So that ends the story of my boring pathetic life. O I'm also going to Ocean City, Maryland for vacation for my b-day this year. Hopefully! Other than that nothing. Well ttyl"

"event","It's been for ever since I updated this! So I'm on summer vacation!!! Not that it's great or anything.......cuz it's not. I've been working all summer. I work at World of Wheels now! Which I am very proud of!! My dad has the farm now and we've or I should really say he has done alot of work to it, but there is still alot more to go. I turn 16 in about a month!!! I already have my truck and I've been working on it here and there. It's a beast!! 

So I really was hoping for a life changing summer........but it's been nothing but crap. No friends, no fun, all work. The more I think about it.......the more I don't even want to be here. My gf is shade. We haven't gotten together at all. I talk to her sometimes. Devon and I haven't talked at all......I figure he's hanging out with garrett. O well....my life story. Eveybody leaves me. I feel like that fairy tale about the golden touch only I have the opposite. Everything or everyone I touch I hurt or they leave me. Let's face it....I'll be alone forever. I'll never find that perfect girl. There is no such thing! Once upon a time there was one but that's in the past with the rest of my regrets. You know....there's a saying that goes...never dig a whole you can't get out of. I should of listened to that saying alittle closer. O wait here's my fav.........you never know what you have till it's gone. Yea that one get's me everytime."

"event","Today was messed up. I went to school where I just didn't have the greatest day. I mean nothing went right....just a bad day. It was so long.

I came home and my little cuz is in the hospital with strept throat and he's dehidrated or however you spell it. But anyways he's gonna be ok but he's not at his greatest. On top of all of that his mom (my aunt) was recently in a car accident and his dad(my uncle) has pink eye. I feel so bad. Like my grandma says....god only does that kinda stuff to the people he really loves. 

Well then my dad, sis and me went to the movies. That was fun....we enjoyed it. But my mom is being such a you know what. And she's always saying stuff about dad so my dad was upset about all of that. To top it off....on our way home there was an ambulence and a fire truck in our field at the track. Some kid wrecked but he was ok. I was worried that something serious happened. 

So after all this I went for a walk to clear my head. I can't even think straight anymore. I don't know what's wrong and what's right anymore. I just need it all to stop. It seems like I can never catch up. I think I'm finally getting ahead in life then all this other crap happens....and I just can't win. This year has really sucked....I mean bad!!! I hate '05!! But I look at it......and it could be much worse....but it's not over yet. Let's hope it gets better. Night"

First there was a powerline down on the road so we had to take this back road if that's what you want to call it. It was bad....then there was this wreck and this guy flipped his truck over on his roof. I finally got to work and I kept busy today! With all the snow we kept busy! Then I came home and relaxed a little. 

I talked to Rachel most of the night!! She is so awesome...get this...she likes Kurt Busch!! She likes nascar and actually worked at Lowe's motor speedway for a little bit!! That is so awesome! We are both late Dale Earnhardt fans too. 3 Forever!! We both had to work today from nine to five and she keeps a journal too just like me! She writes about me! hehe She does yoga. That would be kewl...I would probably die with all the streching though! lol

Told me too go suck a cactus. ????? whatever....but yea so now she doesn't want to talk to me. Jess will be spreading stuff about me tomorrow too....I know cuz she's done it before....and they wonder why I want to find friends away from here?!?!?!

I mean I'll just be missing a big dinner and being with the family and church. So yea.

Speaking of work........I get to think alot while I'm cleaning. I step back and look at my life. I'm always comparing myself to other people. But when I really think about it.......I'm a pretty lucky kid. And I thank god for being so good to me. I know god has his reasons for me losin jess and not having a gf. He has something better in store for me. Something that I'll look back on and say I wouldn't change a thing. Until then.......life goes on. I also realized what parents say by I wish I could go back to school. I thought they were nuts!! But not that I have a job...I see what they mean. I wish the week would last forever and I wouldn't have to go to work. Just being with my friends and joking around all the time in school beats cleaning all day. I'll hate it when I graduate and leave school. But I'll be happy to move on to something bigger and better.

So I hate it that my mom chooses my life for me. I mean I can't do something without her being there saying nope and then picking what is best for me. I hate it.......I can't do something without her saying something and then making my decision for me. GRRR

Today when I got home I was surprized. My mom was here and making dinner. So we ate early!! She got me the new Josh Gracin cd!!!! I love it!!! Got Nothing to Lose is the best song!!! She also got me another game for my PS2 since the other one I bought didn't work but this one doesn't work either. So I'll have to tear it apart and see what I can find. I also got my computer tonight!!! I'm going to take it to Clarion Saturday to get cleaned and setup. I'll have my own computer! It'll be for interent and game use only!! I'll play music and burn cd's too! But I won't put AIM on there! That stupid thing just junks your PC!!

I can't wait!! I don't know if anyone knows this but I love to garden. I help my grandma garden every year. This year I'm gonna have my own garden! I'll give it a shot and see how it goes. I just got done reading a book on the signs of planting. It has to do with the zodiac signs and what days are best to plant.

So that's my day. I know it's pathetic. I have no life but o well. So I think I might go out to my mom's and set up her new computer for her. She wants me to come out.....and I want to go test out the new computer! hehe So it works. Well ttyt! night"

What a way to spend your sunday......and I have to work next sunday 9 to 5 again. It's ok if I get to work with Jake. He's pretty kewl. He tried to get me hooked up with one of his ex-gf. lol He told me to go ask her for her phone number. She was pretty hot but I couldn't work up the courage to ask her......especially in front of her mom. 

I came home and relaxed!! I've forgot how nice it was when I didn't have to work.....but the money is nice too. I watched the race. Kurt finished 3rd! Not bad in his home town!! But his younger brother Kyle finished in 2nd. 

So I got on here and was greeted by Chels!! Your awesome chels........you knew that! lol I have such awesome friends! Well that was pretty much my day. Boring I know but hey......that's my life story! Well ttyl"

My dad came and we looked at the race cars in the cranberry mall!! That was pretty kewl. I bought another Tim McGraw cd!! Can you tell he's my favorite?? Then we went a couple of other places and stopped to eat. Amanda was making annoying noises the whole time!! lol....but ya gotta love her. 

So then I came home and messed around. Then got the brillant idea to go sled riding in the dark!! I swear trees just jump out right in front of you! lol But I'm ok! I was told by Ms. Chelsea to be careful! Then when I came in she was all upset......I had her worried sled riding in the dark! lol Your awesome chels! 

So yea that's my day. Interesting and funny one! Well Night!"

Well the day kinda did get better. I just dumbed around the house and didn't do anything. Then jess wanted me to come play in the snow but it was cold so she called and we talked for like half an hour or so. So I went up there and we watched napolen. That was my excitment for the day. 

I went shopping in butler!! Finally got to go!! I got another Tim McGraw cd!! He's the best!! They had the race car show there too! So I spent most of my time looking at them!! 

Well now I sit here and listen to my cd..........and wonder why?

I remember Sunday mornings
walking on the beach
And that place we'd stop
for breakfast with the 
old red vinyl seats
The hours of the 
tide chart
The way the sunlight
dance upon your face

That antique roller coaster
you just had to ride
I remember how you laughed
at the terror in my eyes
The color and the detail 
Just like it was yesterday

And I remember how you held me 
the night my father died
I didn't have to tell you
I just broke down and cried
You're sewn into the fabric,
the pieces of my life
And I just can't remember
why we said goodbye

Up and down this 
boardwalk lonely people sit
I know it wasn't perfect
but nothin' ever is
The sails out in the harbor
Are searching for the wind

I just had to call you,
I had to hear your voice
and tell you I still
love you
we still have a choice
You're sewn into the
fabric, the pieces
of my life
And I just can't 
remember why
we said goodbye

Everything I do
leads me back to you
I know I just can't let
us go

There must have been
a reason, but I can't
remember now
I know if I could hold you
we could work it out
You're sewn into the fabric
the pieces of my life
And girl let's give it
one more try
Cause I just can't remember
why we said goodbye"

So that kinda makes me mad! But it makes for a long weekend......or course for me I get a regular weekend for once. I still have to work all day Sunday!! 

My mom said she might take us to butler today which would make my day!! I just need to get out of this house and out of this town!! Another school would be nice too! But from what I heard I don't want to go to Keystone......not the best district and all the kids are crack heads! Which I believe.....ever ment any of them?? So today I don't have anything planned except for maybe going to butler! 

Life is back to it's sucky ways again! I stand alone.......no one I really care about! So now the way I look at things.....it's all about me!! I do what I want....my whole life I've been doing what other people want......worring what other people think. What makes everyone else happy......what they like! Now it's what I want.....what I like......what makes me happy!"

I hope things pick up tempo by the end of the week. It's starting to get boring again.......and I was starting to have a good week! Now it's dull!! Well if the bowling party this week it should get interesting!

You know.....I have alot of people telling me the same thing. I won't tell you what this something is........but I just can't bring my self to believe it. So against all odds and what people think..........I say they are wrong. I guess only time will tell.

I love the long nights staying out till nine......watching the sunset.....then having a fire and sit with your friends just talking!!! It's the best ever!!

So yea.......it was just a nice easy day. Nothing new happened. I'm also kind of excited too cuz this friday is the bowling party........and saturday I don't have to work!! On the bus ride up to the bowling party I get to sit with Allie! But on the way back I have to find another seat. 

Jess was feeling crappy today......so I tried to make her feel better on the bus. I don't know if I did or not, but her smile let me know....and it made me feel a whole lot better. I try to make chels feel better too since her and luke are having there moments. My little sis! lol What would I do with out her? 

You know.......it's werid how on the days everyone is down or not good........I have the best day! I hope that isn't a sign.......but maybe it's a good sign or something! That's just like on Friday the 13th.....that's the luckest day of the year for me!! Well with all this happiness and excitment I'm feeling now.....maybe it's a sign something good is going to happen!

Good news is I don't have to work saturday......bad news I have to work 9 to 5 sunday. But dad came in and ate so took a little brake and sat and talked to him. Thank goodness for dad! 

Afterwards we went and looked at this barn that's in the keystone district. It has more acres than the one we're trying to get......but I don't think the barn is as nice. My dad said he's going on vacation......I guess things are getting stressful........I wouldn't blame him......with all of this crap he puts up with. 

Then I came home and crashed. I was pooped. I got on here and now I'm talking and listing to music. The family is down here.......o joy. Well........later"

"event","Well today was so boring just like my life!! I really didn't do anything. I pretty much watched tv and went outside this morning. I had a long talk with the greatest person ever.....(a.k.a Little sis lol) Chels is awesome.......and she really helped me today making me realize some things. I don't know where I would be with out her.........she makes everything better. 

I had wonderful work today!! Yea right! It was ok though cuz I worked lobby and just cleaned.......which I like to do. I have no one to bother me and I can work at my own pace. Plus I got payed today so it was worth while!

After work I changed and went to the mall with my grandpa and we checked out the race cars. It gave me the racing fever so bad........I just wanted to jump in and take a couple of laps. O well.......hopefully soon I will be racing. Then after words......grandpa and I went out to eat and then I went home.....it was great to get to spend time with him since I hardly get to see him.......we talked about everything. 

Today I learned that hardly anything goes your way and you just have to go with the flow and sometimes you have to do things you don't want to. God has a reason for everything.........and I question him this time.......I wish I knew what he had planned. Well I'll call it a night. ttyl"

"event","Well! Today was a little crazy. All in all a good day though. Shade has been hanging out with me this whole week........she likes me I guess. She's ok as a friend..........but I wouldn't go out with her. So I just let whatever happenes....happen. 

Work tomorrow......joy. I wish that place would just blow up. What's wrong with them taking my weekends?? Grrr......o well.

So I have a chance to go to Keystone next year........I could start all over.....and it could be a fun adventure, but there's something back here that I don't want to leave behind. One special person.......and just being close friends would make it worth while. I just want to tell the world I love her..........I wanna hold tight........and never let her go. You know......a wise old man told me once.......try...try.....try again, and no matter how many times your try........or how many mistakes it takes......you will eventually succeed. I take his advice to heart.

So I end my day with that statement. I couldn't tell you how many times I've tried and failed.......but I could tell you the times I've succeeded. Well Night!"

Another day has come and gone. One that makes me wonder..........step back and look at where I am........what I have........and everyone around me. Yea it's been one of those days. Actually I've been having a pretty good week so far. Today showed me alot of things.......and answered alot of questions for me. 

It started with finding out that Tiff broke up with Devon......which sucks. Poor guy.......he gets a good relationship going and something happens. Then she asked me out at lunch......well one of her friends did......but right in front of him......I felt bad.......and of course I said no! First of all that's not what you do to a friend......and I would never go out with her. 

Shade was I guess if you want to call,flirting, which was gross. She's ok to talk to and all.......but she's kind of werid. But now she's wearing my necklace........gotta get that back. 

I can't think of anything else to type. I could tell ya'll something......but I'm gonna keep it a secret.......it's nothing........just wishful thinking. But hey...dreams do come true.....right? Well time to go. Talk to ya later! Night!"

Remember when I said I wish I could say today was a great day? Well I can!!! Today was awesome!! It started out with a two hour delay.......and then for the first two periods of the day I was on the computer in the library. It was an easy day in all!! Everything was nice and it just flowed!

Well Jess and I talked alot for the first time in a long time!! Which was awesome! She's really great......to bad it didn't last jess! Well your happy now......it's in the past!

So when my sis and I came home........damo, tiff and corey all come over and we had a huge snowball fight!! It was awesome!! We went up in the woods....where we found two feet of snow and I was up past my knees in snow!! Then we came back down and corey and damo started fighting! It was hilarous!! (I think corey won.......he's only in 4th grade! lol) Then our neighbors took after damo....it was great! 

Then we stood down by the trees and told your mamma jokes!! lol.......it was so funny! All in all it was a really good day! I wish everyday could be just this good! Well gotta go find myself! night!"

Today I went outside with Amanda and Tiffany. We went sled riding for a little bit......some other people came over. When we were sled riding....we had a sweater on my little Jack Russel Terrier. Well it managed to come off and she lost it!! So Tiffany and I searched the whole hill side looking for it......but came up empty handed. My sis sat and supervised.....which is what she does best. Then we got the fourwheeler out and hooked up the sled, and I pulled them around!! That was awesome. I was out side most of the day. I came in for a little bit......but then went back out! It was great!!

I was on here and talked to Chels, Allie, and Jess. Jess was upset with my journal. She didn't like the part about the 11 months, should of been 9 thing. She said she didn't think I wanted it to last, which she is totally wrong. Cuz I did......I just didn't know how to make it last! But hey......it's in the past. Yes I did talk to Chels for the first time in a long time. So her and I are back to talking alot.....she's kewl! 

So now it comes to the end of the day.......the part I hate....except I get to sleep!! But I wish I could start this day all over again! The only thing that would make it better if we could make it two days in a row. But that won't happen! O well.......wishful thinking. Well ttyl! Night!!"

Well today was interesting! We got out of school early....and it wasn't even bad.....it wasn't even snowing!! But hey.....if they wanna give us a free day....I ain't gonna complain! Other than that today was boring as usual. You know.....people say the best thing happened......it was so funny.....today was the best!! What doesn't that ever happen to me? I get up in the morning.....and say when will this ever end? I get a shower and get dressed and then go to school. I go to my classes and talk to my friends.....which consists of Devon and Mike and anyone who talks to me.....on a good day I'll talk to Jessica. Then I come home and find something to do and get on the computer. Boring!! 

I made an awesome friend. ALLIE!!! She's the best! She so funny and sweet....she can make me smile on my worst day.....but she doesn't talk to me in school so that doesn't help me! Speaking of friends......can anyone loan me there's. Devon and Mike are great......I just need more of them. 

So my love life sucks. Jess was my last gf......we lasted 11 months to long.....we should of only lasted 9. We were just afraid of hurting each other. We were just missing something........something I could never find the answer to. I don't really plan on finding another gf for a while. To tell you the truth.....there isn't really anyone worth going out with in ACV. So I've learned my lesson....don't mess with girls. And there always right even though there wrong 80% of the time. But I do have one exception....and that's Allie.....she's awesome! 

I do have a job at McDonalds...make a little money. I turn 16 in July also! That's awesome! Finally be able to get away from this mess! Great things come in time........how long is that? My life still sucks! Let's summerize all of this........boring dull life.......no friends.....allie is awesome......girls can be a pain......I have a job and am looking towards the future. So there you have it! Well......other day has ended......night!"

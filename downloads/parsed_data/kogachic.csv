I've been asking myself this question over and over again in the past 24 hours, patiently waiting for a respond. Not from any of you, unless you would like to respond to my question, but from my best friend. Someone who I believe I'm truly in love with, who I've been in love with all along. Even through out my past relationships, which have been thin. Though I've never met him face to face, he's been in my life very actively since I was 15 years old. He was there to talk to when I was happy about receiving my drivers license, when I lost my virginity, when I would fight with my parents or friends, when I moved away for college, then moved back home, even when I lost my license in getting my DWI. He's been there and has encouraged me all through out the most meaningful years of my life. He is the one who made me believe I was a lot smarter and worth more than I ever thought I was, even today. 

Spilling your heart out to someone isn't easy. It never is, but I do believe that you have to always tell a person how you feel about them. Especially when the feelings one is feeling are strong. You never know what can happen in life, so letting anyone know (sooner rather than later) how you feel about them (whether you have physical and emotional feelings for them or it's just a friendship). 

In the past year I've become very blunt about my emotions when it comes to personal relationships and friendships. Doing this has made me feel better about myself, makes me less afraid of the world and of people. If you're honest and straight forward, sometimes it's not the smartest thing to do, but most of the time it gets the point across without beating around any bushes. But right now...I'm wondering if I have made a mistake in being blunt to this person, though they are fully aware of how I feel about them, lately things have been different. I've become more impatient and I acted on an impulse last night in sending him an e-mail, telling him he can either acknowledge that I sent it to him or not and that either way I'm still his friend. I've received no response, yet. Maybe it's just me being impatient or paranoid, but my mind is racing. So I had to post about it on here to help get it out of my system.

Anyways, I have laundry to fold and The Dark Knight Rises to watch. So until next time.

PS:  If anyone has any comments, please share. Unless you're telling me it's a hopeless cause; because I know for a fact that having him in my life is most certainly not a hopeless cause."

"event","My oh my goodness. So much as happened since I last posted. Well last anyone on here knew I was in the process of moving to Mankato and going to school there, well that's done and over with. I ended up moving back home after living in Mankato for 4 months, dropped out of College because I have no idea what I want to go to school for. I don't see the point in wasting money on classes when I don't even know what I want to go for anymore. 

I started working at Double Play again after I moved home and became very close to a high school friend of mine, she also is my cousin's girlfriend, Brandi. She has become one of my closest friends in the past year :) Also I've become best friends again with my oldest friend Marissa. It's been quite the year to be honest, so much has happened to me in the past year. Also I have gotten myself into a bit of a mess. I've gotten my first DWI, so I cannot drive for the next year. Well only 9 more months now. But in receiving this DWI I've come to the conclusion that I will never drink and drive again. It is not worth the stress, time, or money (which depending on what level of DWI you receive is a heafty amount of money). 

Also I have moved out of my parents house, quit my job at Double Play (again), and moved back up to Moorhead within the past few months. I'm living with my friends Wendy, Zach, Pat, and Jake. A few weeks ago I got hired at Sears and I've been working there. I've never worked in retail before, only in restaurants. It's a nice change, I like working there so far but it's annoying that I have to keep bugging people for rides to and from work. Usually it works out to my advantage because my friends Zach and Lana also work there so I just ride with them. But tomorrow I have to be to work at 10am and my roommate and very good friend Wendy said she would take me since she doesn't have class tomorrow until 12:30. OH! And speaking of, Pat and Wendy are graduating at the end of this semester. Slightly depressing to think about sometimes because if I would have stuck with it and kept going to school up here I would more than likely be graduating this year as well. But none-the-less I'm so proud of them and it'll be an exciting day when they receive their diplomas for their degrees. 

On a non-school note, one of my closest high school friends is getting married in September and I am going to be her Maid of Honor. I feel bad because I'm not around the area anymore to be there to help out more with Wedding Plans and all, but I told her I'm just a phone call away. Speaking of weddings EVERYONE is getting engaged! I know of about 6 or so couples who have gotten engaged in this past year, this is also slightly depressing to think about sometimes because I'm not even in a relationship with anyone right now. But hey, that's fine. :) I'm use to being single and I like being able to do what I want when I want without having to tell my significant other where I'm going and when I'll be back and who I'm going to be with. Since I'm on a relationshippy tangent, my online friend whom I've known and been talking to since I was 15 years old says he wants to meet me within the next year or so. :) This super excites me! I know hardly anyone who reads this will agree with me, but oh well. I know he is who he says he is and I've been talking to him on a regular (almost daily) basis for over 5 years. 

Well I think I've typed enough for tonight. Goodnight. :)"

"event","Well, here I am almost finished with my 2nd year of college. Am I proud of myself? No, not really. This year was pretty crappy if you ask me. Why? I'm not sure why, but like I said in my last post, something has defiantly been distracting me. I'm not in it like I was my freshmen year, but I am trying. I am doing my best. South Central College accepted me, I went to my orientation there yesterday. I'm still waiting on MSU in Mankato though, they want my grades from this Semester so I have to wait until after school's out to know if MSU will accept me or not. 

Then Brittany and I are trying to find a place to live in Mankato, we've been looking and possibly might live with our friend Bonny and her brother Craig. They're going to go look at places tomorrow, I wish I could be down there to go with them! 

Also working at Double Play again for the summer, saving my money, going to go to the Boundary Waters in June again with my family. I'm really excited for that! My cousin Travis, and possibly my cousin Jake, are coming with us this time, so it should be fun! My parents are also going to go up to Lake Itasca to their friend's cabin for a week in July. Tucker is going to stay at home with me, so they can have some time alone. Which will be nice for them :) and it'll be interesting having the house all to ourselves, my brother and I. I'm sure people will constantly be over though, like Brittany and Bonny and Sam, etc..

To be honest, I just want summer to be here already. It's all I've wanted since October really. Soon enough though! This is the last official week of classes and I have 2 tests! One in Earth Science Today on Thursday, then a Math test on Friday. I'm not too terribly worried, but I am going to put a decent amount of study time in. I'll probably end up going out to my Aunt's house tomorrow so I can study properly without any distractions. Then on May 11th, after my Math final, which is the final final haha, I'll be saying goodbye to Moorhead and all of the friend's I've made up here. Though I do plan on keeping in touch with the ones that matter to me, and visiting when I can (which won't be as often as I'd like if Gas keeps going up the way it has been).

Anywho, off to work I go! It's my last 2 nights at Duane's House of Pizza this week. I'm going to miss Chelsea, Liz, Paul, and Kelly the most because they're really the ones that converse with me haha. Anywho, until next time! Which might actually be later tonight because I feel there is SO much more I haven't written that I would like to...but we'll see."

"event","Dear Livejournal,

I feel like I've been neglecting you lately. Sorry about that. I could say I've been busy, which I have been, but honestly? Busy doing what? Being social, running around from here to there, occasionally doing my school work. Just kidding, I do do my school work, but I feel like this year...I'm just not into the swing of things like I should be; like something is distracting me, pulling me away from concentrating on what I should be concentrating on, school. Well since I posted last a few changes have been made, or are in the process of being made. I'm transferring down to Mankato in the fall, that is if MSU accepts me. Why? There are a few reasons. 

Big Reason #1: I miss my family. Sure I have my aunt Cheri and uncle Rich up here, which does help, believe me it does, but I miss seeing my mom and dad. I really miss seeing Tucker and Jack. Tucker is also starting to become more active in school programs and church programs musically. He seems to be taking it pretty seriously too and I don't wanna be the sister who misses out on her little brother's plays or performances. I want to be there for him and support him. Sure, I could do that being up here, but I wouldn't do it in the way that I want to. I want to actually BE there, I want to BE in the audience and not have to worry about driving 6 hours to do so. Also, I miss seeing Jack. I'm pretty sure last year I saw him a total of 4 or 5 times, out of the entire YEAR. That frustrates me. Then I start to think, what if something were to happen to Jack while I was up here in Moorhead? I'm 6 hours away, it'd be hard for me to get down there, especially in the winter. Being in Mankato I'll be a quick 45 minutes away from my parents and Tucker, and only a few hours away from Jack.

Reason #2: I miss my friends. Sure they're high school friends, but honestly? They're the friends that got me through a LOT. Yes, I have friends up here, but they're only friends that I've had for a short amount of time. Sure, they've been through a bit with me, but I miss being close to the ones I've known for years.

Reason #3: I wondered if I should have made this reason #2 or not, but I decided against it because 'bros before hoes' except vice versa since I'm a chick. Anyways, Andy is also a reason. He knows this too and I'm not quite sure what he thinks about it, but I let him know that he's not THE reason, he's just A reason. There's something about him that I just can't shake. Believe me, I've tried. Didn't work. Honestly? I think I'm in love with him. No, I'm not just saying this, I honestly think I love him. I haven't felt this way about anyone in years, if at all and it scares the living hell out of me. I don't know what to do about him. But I'm deciding not to act TOO terribly much on it until the move happens, since there really isn't much I can do about it right now seeing as I'm way up north and he's down at home. 

Anyways, I have a cold and I just took some Theraflu..andd it's starting to kick in. I just wanted to update on a bit in my life. Goodnight =)

Love,
Katie Jo"

"event","Well, I've gone through my first almost two weeks of my Soph. year of college. Why does it feel like my Freshmen year was more exciting? Probably because it was something new. I'm not saying I don't like it up here any less than I did last year, I love it =) Classes are going good for the most part so far. Last weekend Joe, MJ, Wendy, and I went to the Minnesota State Fair for the weekend. Funny how I live in Minnesota and for the almost 20 years I've been here, I've never been to the State Fair. It was fun, a lot of walking and eating and such. I also recived two suprises while I was there this last weekend. First suprise was that Brittany was there as well, so I got to see her and talk to her for about 20 minutes or so. Then I get a call from Andy and he said he was going to come up and he did :) so I got to spend a few hours with him on Saturday and spent all afternoon with him on Sunday. I didn't think he was really going to come up..I didn't expect him to because Saturday he had just gotten done with his 2 week training up at Camp Ripley, so I figured he'd be too tired. That boy keeps suprising me and I love it, but I will admit it scares me a little too. I'm going home this weekend for Labor Day. I might see Andy, he said he doesn't know if he's going to be around or not yet. I hope he is, but if he isn't, oh well. I'll get to see Sam and I really want to see her cause after the past few days of us talking on the phone made me want to go home and see her and everyone else if they're around. Also, I've gone 2 weeks without smoking. I'm so proud of myselfff, I'll admit it's been hard, but if I'm not around it I'm completely fine. So whoop whoop for Katie! Anywho, I do believe that is all for now."

"event","Well, more venting is in the process of happening. You know, it doesn't even matter if anybody reads my enteries anymore or not. It's just the fact of me letting go somewhere where I can let go and that's on here. Anyways, last night was my last night with Andy until who knows when and it hurt, a lot, to walk out that door last night. I couldn't say goodbye to him, so I just said goodnight. Jarin and Kaylynn had to give me a ride home cause my truck was sitting up at the Double Play parking lot. I would have liked Andy to give me a ride into town, but I knew he had to pack for going to camp Ripley today. Jarin was asking me if I'm going to miss Andy and I go, ""what do you think? of course I'm going to miss him."" and then he started telling me how he was talking to Andy about him and me again the other night. Jarin told me that he was telling Andy how he'll get to spend even more time with me next summer and Andy goes, ""if she even comes back, or feels the same."" When Jarin said that, I asked him about 5 times if Andy really told him that and he said yes. I cried. When we got to my truck I thanked them for the ride, drove home, sat in my truck and cried. Got to my bedroom and cried. I'm going to miss him so much. I started talking to my cousin about it on MSN because no one else was online really and I needed to talk to someone about it. She told me to have hope and that if we both feel the same for one another that we'll make time to see eachother. Which is true. But it's hard to know if Andy feels the same for me or not. I think he does, but it's hard to tell. The reason it's hard to tell is because he says that because of the military training it's hard for him to show a lot of emotion. Which I believe because he doesn't really show much emotion most of the time. I mean he does, but it's constricted. But I thought going to sleep last night would make me feel better and it did, until I woke up and started thinking again. I'm not going to let this throw me into a sadfit or a depression. God no. But it just...hurts to finally find something, no, someone when I wasn't even expecting this to happen to me anytime soon and then RIGHT as it's pretty much in full swing, I have to leave. I'm the one leaving, not him. Usually it's the other way around. But it's my choice to leave, but like I said before I can't just stop my life in Moorhead, a life that I do love, just for one guy I've only known for a few months. So I'm going to see how this school year plays out and how Andy and I play out within this whole me being gone thing. Then we'll see what happens.."

"event","This is the soul purpose for my livejournal account: to vent out my emotions when I need to. And quite frankly right now, I need to. 

I'm going to be a 2nd year student at Minnesota State University Moorhead in about 2 weeks. I absoutley love being up there, I love my friends that I've made the in past year up there, and I love the professors, the atmosphere, everything. So I come home this summer, expecting nothing but a typical summer. Work, save money, hang with friends, become pumped to go back to school. Well, that's how it started, until I met someone. He's lived in Blue Earth all his life, for the most part, graduated from the same high school I did, yet I'd never met him until this summer. I met him through one of my best friends, Bonny. At first, we all hung out together and had a good time when we did hang out, but then, completely unexpectedly, I started to like him. I could tell he liked me too, so we just started hanging out together more and more. Our liking one another eventually turned into casually seeing eachother, no strings attatched or complications since I am leaving for school at the end of the summer and he's staying back home.

Well, the other night him and Jarin and this other girl and I were all hanging out. Well the girl wanted a ride on Andy's rocket (that's the guy's name by the way haha.) so they did that and I hopped in Jarin's truck and we started talking. Jarin asks me about Andy and I and I told him the truth, no reason to lie, Jarin is one of my best guy friends. He said that he had also talked to Andy just the night before about him and me and what we were. He said he could tell just by the way that Andy was talking about me that he really likes me and when Jarin brought up me leaving for school Andy became quiet and didn't really say much. He could tell that Andy is bothered by the fact of me leaving soon for school. I was really happy and sad at the same time when Jarin informed me of this.

Then tonight I was over at Andy's and after we'd watched a movie, things started to get pretty physical. I stopped and asked him if it was okay that we went through with what we were about to go through with, the reason I asked him was because a few weeks before that he told me something quite personal about himself that he's only told one other person. Which I respect him for telling me, and when he told me what he did it didn't change my feelings for him at all. My feelings still stand in the same spot. But he said we didn't have to if I didn't want to. I told him it's not that I didn't want to because I did want to, really wanted to. But I don't know. It's kind of a big risk. I don't want to flat out say it, but I think from reading this you'll kind of understand what I'm getting at. Anyways, I feel like I'd rejected him, and I didn't. I'd also felt rejected myself. Then he went to the bathroom and I was sitting in his room trying everything to keep myself from crying. He came back from the bathroom, walked me to the door, we talked for awhile, then he kissed me goodnight. Right when I got to my truck and was pulling out of the driveway I called Sam, another one of my best friends, and started crying telling her what had just happened.

It still hurts and I still feel like I hurt him, though he said he understands, I still feel bad. Though I know I made the right decision in chosing to be safe until I figure out if I want to take that risk or not. Then another thing popped into my head tonight as well, it wouldn't hurt this bad if my feelings for Andy weren't strong. So they're obviously a lot stronger than I've been leading everyone else to believe. Though I do realize that I'm leaving in about 2 weeks, I'm not asking him to come with me because that'd be insane. We've only known one another for a few months. But I'm not giving up my life up in Moorhead just to see if things could work out with Andy and I, though I wish I could, but I don't want to beacause what if it didn't work out? I'd be stuck in Blue Earth for the rest of my life. It's just..really hard. I don't like thinking about it. I know him and I can and will still be friends and probably/possibly something more unless we find significant others while I'm up there and he's down here.

But I do know one thing for sure, I haven't felt this way about someone since Nick. And that was damn near 3-4 years ago. It's scary to have those kind of feelings for someone rush up and knowing that you have to leave them behind. Andy has also been slowly showing me that not all guys are assholes. Which I love :) because my experiences with guys in the past year haven't been the best, then Andy comes along and shows me a complete 180 from what I had gotten use to.

I just had to get that off my chest, now I'm tired and I'm going to go to sleep."

"event","So far this year, my freshmen year of college, I haven't been very stressed out at all. Well, good things must always come to an end eh? In my Intro to Ed class tonight was the first time I felt overwhelmed and completely stressed out. I really, really wanted a cigarette after class, but after the debacle with my father over Christmas break, I resisted (thus far) my temptation. I'm not going to go out and waste my money on an entire pack just because I want one, then that entire pack will tempt me every single time I see it. I don't need that. I'm still freaking out in my head right now, I mean I got all of my homework done that needs to be done for tomorrow, but I'm just thinking about things in the long run and what needs to be done  before the end of the semester, before Spring Break for that matter. And then the real kicker hits me in the ass, wtf am I going to do if we have a flood?! (which, by the way, it's bound to happen..) I'm going to have to kick it into extra high gear. *Sigh* I suppose I'm just venting right now..I needed to get this out. I still feel overwhelmed, so to get my mind off of things for a few hours a few of my friends and I are going to go to Dear John at 9:55. I'm excited for this and I hope it'll help clam me down academic wise for the night. Movie over Cigarette? I think I've made a wise choice :)"

"event","My friend Sam and I decided today that we're making a pact with one another for the year of 2010. Seeing as the both of us are so keen on sex, we're challanging one another to not talk about or have sex for an entire year. But we've given one another three ""passes"" that we can use throughout the year, but we have to call one another to get permission to use the pass. We can only talk about sex with one another and no one else. I think that this is going to be a very interesting challange for me, especially since I talk about sex on a daily basis. I've also decided to post about it on Livejournal throughout the year to show my progress and my stories that are likely to come about during this challange. I've never really made a New Years Resolution and actually stuck with it, but this time I'm going to actually try. Some might think this is a silly thing to do, but actually it's not. If you're around me enough you'll know this will be a challange for me. I'm not saying I'm a whore because I'm not. I can count the guys I've slept with on one hand. But the talking about it is what's going to be the challange for me. So, wish me luck? And let the games begin."

"event","Classes are going good :) I really love it up here, but I've never been away from home this long. So it's beginning to slightly get to me, I'm beginning to crave ranch fries, mushroom swiss burgers, and mom's home cooking. I'm missing my friends back home, I'm missing my bedroom, my bed, my Tivo. I'm missing the gravel roads and the late night drives around town. But here I've made new friends and met new people, which is fun. I'm active in class and I speak up, which is something I didn't start doing until my Senior year last year. I've also gained weight. Not a lot, but my jeans are a wee bit tighter on me and my stomach isn't as flat as it use to be O_O which is okay, I shouldn't complain about my weight because I'm a skinny person, but still, it's something I've noticed in the almost month I've been here. I've picked up a routine with most of my days, which is nice because it's a lot less stressful that way. I still haven't driven around town much since I've gotten here. My roommate and I get along, but we don't talk the way I talk with Wendy and Sam and Lindsey and Brittan. So that's still a bit awkward, but we're hardly ever here at the same times as well so that makes it a bit more difficult in talking when neither of us are in the dorm at the same time (which is 95% of the time). I'm also in an Anime Club, which I menchoned before, and I love it. We watch 4 hours of Anime every Tuesday night at 7:00pm. Three different series, three episodes from each every week. We're watching Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles, D.Gray Man, and Gungrave. I happen to love all of these :) go figure right? 

November is coming up quickly though and I'm happy for that because on the 24th after my Lit class in the morning, I'm heading home for Thanksgiving break and staying until that Sunday (the 29th). So I'm really excited for that, to go home and see everyone. I was talking to my mom on the phone about this last night and she asked me what I want to eat when I'm home. Yes. This excited me :) I also asked her to make me a cherry pie, which I'm stoked for. Thinking about it makes me really excited, but I'm trying to not think about it because then it'll come that much slower. 

Anywho, I think that this is all for now :)"

Now I have Astronomy homework to do and a little bit of Lit homework to do for Thursday. I probably should study for my math test too, though I know pretty much everything we're testing on, it's still a good idea to at least go through the stuff. So I'll do that and if I get the guts, adventure out and go to my bank to cash my two checks. Tonight is also the big night for the Anime Organization on Campus, they're having their first meeting of the year tonight at 7, and if you know me then of course you know that I'm definatly going =) The sad thing is I think I threw away all of my Anime shirts when I was going through all of my clothes...>.< I'll have to look. Hopefully I'll have at least ONE I didn't get rid of."

But I do because of my friends and family that are there; I like the atmosphere here. But I will say...some people suprise me. It's only the first technical weekend we've been here (we meaning all of us freshmen) and there are already girls on my floor who have gone to parties. Are you KIDDING ME? I'll admit, I've been to parties and I've drank, I do from time to time, but SERIOUSLY?! This just baffles me...some people I'll never understand. I've made a few new friends =) which is nice because I felt trapped inside of my own head for awhile there. My roommate and I get along fine, we don't talk all that much though, but that will soon hopefully change. Once I get use to my surroundings and the people I'll be more talkative and outgoing.

"event","Wow, I don't think I've been on here in maybe 6 months? LOL nah, it's only been a few. But it feels like it's been so much more. Anyways, I'm reaching the end of my High School Years; with only six days left next Tuesday being my last day. Graduation is on the 7th and then the 8th I'm leaving for Tennessee with Brittany, Steph, and possibly Nick (Brittany's boyfriend). We're going to be gone until the 17th I believe. So there goes pretty much my entire month of June aha. I hope to possibly go down to Missouri to visit my cousins Abbi and Mike, hopefully I can make something work in July to do that. Then August will roll around and Brittany will be leaving for Basic I believe on the same day I'll be leaving to move into my dorm up in Moorhead. Lots of crying will happen within those 24 hours that we both say goodbye. She'll be headed down to Fort Lenardwood in Missouri and I'll be headed 6 hours north to Moorhead. Speaking of dorms, I've talked a bit with my soon-to-be roommate. Her name is Kylie; she's bringing a fridge and a TV so I told her I'd bring a microwave and my big stereo. We agreed that if we need anything else we'll get it later. Now I'm curious as to what all is going to fit of mine and hers and what all won't. I guess we'll find out on move-in day. Now back to high school...I'm dreading this week espically. Mostly for Chemistry; last week I missed two days (one because of the senior trip to Valley Fair and the other becaues of Community Service I volunteered all day at the fairgrounds to help with the Theraputic Horse Riding) so I missed quite a bit on this new chapter. I'm so far behind on homework! We have a test on Friday I believe. Ugha! I asked Sam if she would stay after work tonight and help me with the homework and she said she would, which I'm totally greatful for because I cannot fail! I think I'm getting a C average in Chemistry right now...annndd with this test coming up that can make or break this C. I'm doing totally fine in all of my other classes though =). We had a Psychologist come into Psych the other day and I asked him if there is such thing as a laughing disorder (because I laugh more than the average person) and he said, ""No that's a type of Skitzophrania, why? Do you have a friend that excessivly laughs?"" and I looked at him and go, ""No...I do!"" LOL Then he was all, ""OH! I'm sorry."" Aha. There is so much that's due within this week. I have my paper for American Literature (which I'm pretty much done with anyways I just need someone to revise my 2nd draft, fix it up, and then BAM I'm done), I have to have my Final Summary and my 2 booklit pages done for Community Service by Friday, Chemistry I have my last test this week, on Friday; then in Psych I have a test tomorrow. WOOOOWEEEEE! I'll get through this. Anyways I figured I should post since I haven't in awhile and I believe I've said pretty much everything I've wanted to say. =) Byebye for now."

I'm now considered an adult (though I'm not gonna consider myself an offical adult until I'm 21). I feel sort of fresh and new in my own little way. 

Also if you've never heard of Sanctus Real, listen to them. They are amazing. I bought their newest CD the other day, I've heard their older stuff and I've been a fan for a year or two now, but holy cow. They're so refreshing and amazing and uplifting and relaxing. 

I'm so stoked to live life and get on with things. =D You only live once, why not reach for the stars and do what you wanna do? Brittany helped shove me into this outlook and so has my own thoughts and such, but I wanted to thank Brittany there too because it wasn't all me. 

If you've not seen The Jane Austen Book Club, watch it. I bought it the other day. I love this moviee."

"event","Honestly, with all of my heart, I believe that Robert Downey Jr is an amazing person. Going from rock bottom hell and climbing his way out and going on to the top with the big wigs is just stunning to me. This man, in my opinion, should not have come up in #2 on the ""Comebacks of 2008"" behinds Britney Spears. He should have been #1. If you have not seen Oprah's show on him, you're absoutly missing out. It's an amazing story and it's just, great. In fact, I'm going to watch it right now. Look it up on youtube if you'd like to watch it. But here's a link to Oprah's site on her segment on him. 

http://www.oprah.com/slideshow/oprahshow/oprahshow1_ss_20041123

But seriously, to be addicted to coke and heroin for that long, and then be clean for well over 2 years? That proves that people can change right there. He is probably the most serious and talented and gifted actors ever, again in my opinion, from his stunning preformance in Less Than Zero, to his mind blowing preformance in Iron Man, Robert Downey Jr has come a long way; and I say congrads to him. There is a reason I'm obsessed with this man and his work. On top of all of this, did anyone know that this man can <b>SING</b> like crazy?! He's such a beautiful singer. I'm totally NOT overexadurating either. Youtube him on Ally McBeal, he sings a butt load on there and it's brilliant, and look up some of his music, I want his CD so badly. He's got a jazzy way to his voice and it is amazing."

"event","I'd have to say Papa Roach was the best part of the entire concert. Probably cause they're the ones I've always wanted to see in concert and knew most of their songs. =) Brittany and I had floor tickets so we were out there in the huge crowd of people. We got smushed in there pretty good and Brittany wanted to keep going and I was fine with where we were. So we seperated and would meet by the exit sign afterwards. We were in Mankato so I wasn't worried about us getting seperated, plus there were so many people there that we knew I wasn't scared. So I started moving a bit and eventually ended up by Alex F. and his friend Tyler. I stayed with them, or attempted to, for the rest of Papa Roach's set. =) Lots of funnn! Then when I met up with Brittany again she was all ""DID YOU SEE ME CROWD SURF?!"" and I didn't! =( But she did, twice. Three times throughout the entire night. 

The only time I really like getting into the crowd and not caring is when I know the band and know the songs. Other than that I don't see a point cause then while I'm in there and I don't really know many of the band's songs, I can't enjoy the music as much and I'm paying more attention to staying out of the mosh pits and sweaty people. Whereas if it's a band I know I'm in the crowd paying attention to the music, singing along, not caring too much about the mosh pits and sweaty people. Like if it was Breaking Benjamin, Our Lady Peace, etc...I'd get right up in there and totally rock out.

We left early when Buckcherry was playing cause they were playing songs we didn't really know. Plus we wanted to beat the rush of people getting out. So we went to Applebees and ate and then Thomas met us there and left with us. =) We held hands on the way homee. XD I know that sounds cheezy, but I love it. Mahahahahahahahaaaa and listened to oldies music most of the way home lol Brittany's 50s & 60s mix. 

Then the next morning I had to work and I was working on 1 1/2 hours of sleep...not smart Katie. LOL. Yeah, so after work I got home and I was so tired, I ate supper, watched a bit of American Idol, watched most of Transporter 2 with my parents, then fell asleep on the couch, at about 9:30 my dad woke me up and told me to go to bed. So I did, and slept until 11:10am. 

Going to that concert though made me want to see Our Lady Peace all the more. If I never see these guys in concert I'm probably going to give myself hell for it the rest of my life. I told my mom about a year ago, I'm gonna see them, even if the closest they ever get to Minnesota is 2 states away, I'll still plan to go. Gah, I wanna soooo bad! I would also love seeing just Raine doing his solo thing, but I'd overall rather see him up there with Jermey, Duncan, and Steve rocking out like they all should be doing =). I'd hate though if they didn't play any of my favorite songs (which are not hits). And I'd try my hardest to get some sort of backstage passes or whatnot."

"event","Gahhh so much has happened, yet so much hasn't happened! 
Well for one, I like someone. His name is Thomas =) and he's a Junior. 
I know he likes me back cause Brittany got it out of him that he does, and we've been texting a lot and we hung out tonight with a bunch of friends and then we're hanging out after the concert (Avenged Sevenfold, Papa Roach, Buckcherry, etc..) on Friday. After tonight I realized I liked him <b><i>a lot</b></i> more than I anticipated. He says the cutest things to me though! =) and makes me smileee. He says I leave him speechless sometimes and he dosen't know why. =D Gahhh. Honestly I haven't liked someone this much since Nick. <strike>You can't count Ben since he's not physically here, if he was that would be a completely different story.</strike> 

Also, I have a first hour release now so I don't have to be at school until 9:51am. Which is nice. Then my last class is Community Service and for that I go to my brother Tucker's 4th grade class room and help his teacher and classmates. So I'm like the student advisor/assistant. It's SO MUCH FUN! We started going there this week after like 2 weeks of prepping and such. OH man I LOVE IT!. We have to write in a Journal every night about things that happened and how we felt and such, no tests or quizzes ever in that class, no final. Just serving for the greater good =) I love it. Love love love loveee it. SO glad I signed up for this class =). 

Anyways, those were the two main things I wanted to share for now. 
OH and I turn 18 in nearly a month! And Kim (my cousin) will be having her baby in nearly a month! That would be AWESOME if she had her baby on my birthday. =) I'm excited for herr!!! A new baby cousinnn. I love babies! I love kids! GAH!!!

OH! OH! and Mrs. Carlson, my teacher from Family Futures last quarter, said I have an amazing perspective on life and love. (We had to do a project on our perspective of all that stuff with lots of fun little activities like writing down the top 10 things you look for in a partner and what your views on marriage is etc...). =) so that made me really happy. 

Life is good right now. I love it. I'm probably the happiest I've ever been with my life right now. =)"

my grades are up pretty good though :) besides Econ...>.< 
the quarter ends soon! after tomorrow only one more day of school and then the new semester starts!

honestly...i don't know what else to say right now?
i think i'm getting into the crappy kind of music, well what others would consider crappy...but i like it? 

Jason Mraz...is amazing. 
I love Britney Spears's new hits Womanizer and Circus..is that odd?!
Who else here likes the new Ruby on Supernatural? I DON'T!!! I think Katie Cassidy played Ruby much better than this new girl...even though this new season is like the best out of them all. Maybe. =)

alright. that's all for now. i think."

"event","So I had to stay in town last night, I stayed at Sam's and I""m still at Sam's. I'm probably going to be spending the night at Sam's again tonight. Because the blizzard is far from done. It hasn't reached us yet, but it's coming, so I'm told. School was canceled today. This year we've been getting a lot of snow days, which is weird because out of all the years I've been in school I have only had a handful of snow days. This year alone we've already had three, or four. I don't remember which, but it's one of the two. This is the worst winter we've had in ages. I sort of don't mind it though, it's cool and nice. I hate the cold and here I am saying I like the winter. I don't like it I suppose it's sort of a love hate relationship with me. Sam has to work tonight and I took tonight off because there was going to be a Financial Aid meeting at the school tonight so that's probably canceled now because of the snow. So I'll be here at Sam's house while she's at work. I'll probably be on the computer most of the night or watch Supernatural. I have no idea. Brittany's birthday is this week, Thursday, and that's also when new episodes of Supernatural start up. We're planning on going down to Iowa for the night next weekend to celebrate her birthday with some of her family, and of course Sam and myself. 

Also, has anyone seen the movie Wicker Park? Brittany and I are talking about it right now and I've seen most of it, it was years ago though so I don't remember much about it, but I remember not liking it. It was confusing and sad and made me angry I believe. The other night, well it actually was a few weekend ago, my mom asked me if I had a boyfriend, what in her right might would make her think that I have a boyfriend?! I don't remember if I've posted about this already..but seriously. No. No boyfriend. I don't even know if I want one. Maybe I'm holding off for someone...maybe. I don't even know, if I am it's sort of stupid seeing as there is a great chance that something will never happen, but there is also a great chance that something will. I'd talk about it more, but it's not something...ugh I don't even know. 

Well I think that's about it for now. I don't really have much to talk about."

"event","Lets see. I'm completely stoked for Christmas. I love, absoutly love this time of year, mostly because I get to see family and spend time with them, but then again who can forget about the gifts? I like buying gifts for others and seeing their reaction to it =]. And of course I also love seeing gifts for myself as well, though I don't expect to get much anymore since I'm not a wee tot. Well school got canceled today! Lots of snow, we're in a Blizzard warning for tonight and tomorrow so after work I'm staying the night at Sam's house because my dad dosen't want me driving home tonight and I work in the morning. It's Steph's 16th birthday today also! I hope she's enjoying it down in Tennessee (yes her and Brittany are down there visiting their mom for 2 weeks). I got her Kung-Fu Panada and a Fall Out Boy CD for her Birthday and Christmas. I got Brittany a ""House"" Purse and Taylor Swift's new ""Fearless"" CD. I got Sam some Vanilla lotion, body spray, and shower gel, and a Twilight Movie book with lots of Robert pictures in them. They all liked their gifts which made me happy. I still have to get my mom and jack something; I also need to finish getting my dad's gift. OH Brittany got me this warm as ever music blanket and Sam got me the first 2 seasons of Supernatural on DVD. I freaking LOVE these guys =D Thanks thanks thanks! I'm watching Supernatural with Tucker right now XD Oh also, I've a new dude crush. His name is Tyler Eckhardt...I don't really know the guy, but he's in collge and he was subbing for teacher assistants. He was in my Econ class a few days ago and oh gee; he's lovely. I've been talkingish to him on Facebook. Then Spencer texted me telling me how he's going into the Military Police and he's leaving for about 3 1/2 years at the end of January. So he wants to 'hang out' with me befor he leaves =] I'm excited for this break, for everythinggg. OH I also don't know if I menchoned that I got accepted to MSUM =] I need to apply for housing pretty soon. I'm also kinda pissed school was canceled, but only kind of. Because I didn't grab my notebook. I left everything in my locker because honestly? I thought we'd have school today I seriously didn't think they'd cancel. I had stuff in there that I wanted to work on over break. >.< so that kind of really irkes me, but oh well there is nothing I can do about it. Anywho, this is all for now I believe."

"event","Every single time I think to myself ""hmm I should probably write in my livejournal"" I don't because it's usually way too late at night for me to even type a sentence that will actually make sense. So then I tell myself I'll do it the next day, well then the next day, like today, I <b>forget</b> mostly everything I wanted to put down! Oh Well, I have a new round of bullets I want to shoot at you (haha isn't that good? made that up all on my own XD). I was suppose to work tomorrow, but I get a call around 1:15pm or so today from Brittany saying how Juila was saying how she kinda wanted to work on Thanksgiving and Brittany menchoned to her how I sorta didn't want to work. So I called Karen (the boss) and talked to her, and then called Julia, and called the boss back, and BAM. I have Thanksgiving free =D (thank you thank you thank you Juliaaa! Also to Brittany because without her push none of it would have happened XD). 

Went to Twilight last Friday. It was <i>alot</i> better than I had anticipated. So I was happy with that =] I want to see it again and own the movie when it comes out on DVD; I also cannot wait for New Moon, I'm excited. I've also devloped an obsession for Robert Downey Jr. He's amazing, and really really sexy hot for an older guy =] And he's funny and his acting is amazing. I put like 4 of his movies down on our Netflix list. =D 

There is probably so much more I should be posting on here but I cannot remember at this time."

"event","Cheri, Rich, and Curt (my aunt, uncle, and cousin) are coming tomorrow! Staying for the entire weekend, maybe/probably longer. I love it when family comes to visit and stay with us. I feel as though I don't do much with my family anymore when we're a close knit family..so it excites me that they're coming and how I don't have to work Friday & Saturday so I'll have at least 2 days to spend with them =D. (Thanks again Brittany for picking up my shift for me Friday, it's greatly appricated =]). We were also talking about having our family thanksgiving/christmas this saturday too. Which sorta angers me just a bit because it's not much of a prewarning to the rest of the family I'd like to see; which btw is the main reason why I get so pumped for christmas and such is because normally I'd possibly get to see these family members and since that didn't happen last christmas I was hoping it would this...but maybe not now :( I dunno. 

Ack, I'm so tired, why is it on days that I'm ultimately tired as ever is usually the day when I hear/feel nothing but negitivity? It seems that way, I was in a good mood this morning, until Econ got dreadly boring and I nearly fell asleep O_o. I also have a pang in my stomach >.< a painful one and I dunno where it came from...maybe it's because I'm hungry? But why would it hurt if I'm hungry? Maybe it's just an upset stomach..I dunno. Maybe I'm getting my prewarnings for my period because I seemed really irritable after I dropped Steph off and went to go pick up my mom. Hmm."

"event","There are so many TV shows out there that I love 
It's horrible but amazing at the same time.
I've always wondered what it would be like to live in a TV show based life. It'd probably be horrible. 

I have applications from MSUM, Concrodia, and Bemidji to fill out. I don't even know if I should fill these out on my own or go talk to the school guidance counclar(sp?) about it and have him help me fill them out? I need to get this stuff in, and my mom wants me to look into schollarships(i know i spelt that wrong O_o), how does one even begin with something like that? *Sigh* I guess talking to Mr. Armon or someone..I don't know. 

In other business it snowed today! It's still snowing, and it's cold outside. Finally feeling like winter. The Twilight movie comes out in about 2 weeks! I'm excited to see it; also scared to see it because I know it's not gonna be exactly like the book. 

I also wonder what our family, on both sides, is gonna do for christmas this year...I hope everyone comes home this year and we can all see eachother and visit and talk. I miss everyone so much :("

"event","So last night Brittany, Sam, Steph, Travis & I went to Mankato and Sam met her friend Mat for the first time. He actually seems like a pretty cool guy, even though he hardly talked and was really shy. But I can see why he was so shy because he was in a car full of people he didn't know besides Sam, hell I'd be shy too. LOL leaving Mat's dorm everyone gets ahead of Brittany and I because Brittany was laughing histarically because Travis almost accidently walked into someone's dorm thinking it was still the hallway; there were people in there lokking at him like ""wtf"" and in her laughing that hard made me crack up, so everyone else got ahead of us and while we were laughing someone threw a bottle of water at us! Brittany and I freaked out and ran down all of the stairs and lost everyone else lmfao! So we were lost for like maybe 4 minutes until Mat found us. Then after hanging out with Mat for awhile we dropped him off and went to go eat at Applebees. After eating at Applebees we went to pick up Nate and we all went to the What's Up Lounge to watch Micah's band (Forever Dumb)! I haven't seen Nate or Micah since they both quit at Double Play so it was really fun to see them and talk to them =]. Micah is still hot as ever, *sigh* jeez. He's the drummer in the band and the other 2 are guys who also went to my school, I just don't remember their names atm. After the What's Up Lounge we hung out at Nate's appartment for awhile and watched this one skating show and jackass (which made me remember the last time I had watched Jackass and that was a night Nick was over at my house..>.<). Anyway, right as we're standing up to leave the door opens and Kalin walks in! I don't think he expected any of us to be there so the look on his face was prieceless. So, we leave, and everyone is hungry again so we go to Mexican Village to eat before they close, I ended up eating most of Steph's meal (no idea what she had but I liked it). 

Then we left there and go to Wells to take Travis home. When we get to Travis's house he leans over and kisses me before leaving and gives me a hug, we're both extreamly tired. I felt like I put more effort into the kiss than he did, it was just a peck, but it was a pretty sucky one on his behalf O_o LOL. *sigh* I'm not really sure how I feel about Travis. You have no idea how frustrating this is people! Because it sorta feels like how it was when Dillon liked me and remember...I never really liked Dillon back, I could only view him as a really good friend. And I guess Travis really likes me, and yes, I do like him, but not to the point where...ugh I don't even know how to explain it! I haven't been treated like the way Travis treats me since Nick, and with Nick I had uncontrolably huge monster feelings for him. With Travis it's like, yeah this is nice, but I don't know if it's what I want. Maybe we need to hang out more? AHGH If I can't like him how I want to like him I can see everyone getting frustrated because I always am saying how I want a boyfriend and how I miss not having one. I also don't want to hurt him if I end up not wanting to be his girlfriend. With Travis it feels like it only click's half way, there isn't a complete click with him. Then I also have to think about the bigger picture, he lives in Wells, about a half an hour away, he dosen't have his own car yet. Honestly how often do you think we'd see one another to, if we started a relationship together, keep the relationships stable enough to the point on where it works? I don't even know you guys...maybe a bit of advice would help me?"

I met Travis (the bench person) last night =] and we're planning on hanging out again and such. It was fun, he's cute and funny and nice, but I want to know more about him. I think he's future boyfriend material. LOL listen to me..ahh it's funny =]

Only 2 more weeknd until the first quarter of my senior year is done. Sweetnesss...I have high Cs in all of my classes I believe *runs to check quick*...

Advanced Algebra: 76.9% (C+)
Government: 79.7% (C+)
Communications: 77.2% (C)

so i'm doing pretty good eh? I mean it's not wonderful great, but these classes arn't like a snap on the fingers like some of the others i'll have later in the year. next quarter won't be so bad, i'll have:
Advanced Algebra
Economics
Family Futures (easy cake walk)
Power Mechanics (easy cake walk)
So I have a feeling I'll do better next quarter the only thing i'm gonna miss is my release :( I don't have one again until 3rd quarter and it's during the middle of the day again, but that's okay lol. I'm so excited for Community Service! but i dont have it until 2nd semester >.<

anyways i think this is all for now :D nighty night world.


<b>Actually...there is more</b>
So I cried last night, for awhile, no idea why. But like, a few hours after I got home I just had this feeling in me, I've been having this feeling for awhile, it's like an emptyness...full of heavyness...if that makes sense. It makes me feel like I'm a horrible person and I feel like I have been horrible lately. I feel like I've been a mean rude bitch lately and I have no idea why if I am. It's just, I've been having these tantrums lately, maybe not tanturms, but like where I don't want to be around anyone I don't want to talk to anyone because I feel like I'm so stupid with everything and it just makes me feel bad about myself and I feel like I'm sometimes not good enough to be around anyone anymore...I don't know why I feel like this either, it's not all of the time, but frequently enough that it effects who I am and what I do. :( I don't know, it's hard to talk about as well because I don't even know why this is happening and why I'm feeling like this so I feel if I talk about it and someone asks me ""why"" i'll just feel dumb again because I can't explain it! *sigh*"

"event","So the other day Deidra went with me to Mankato! It was a lot of fun, though we didn't stay up there long. I've come to find out I've gone up one size in jeans (from a 4 to a 5) which feels weird. I blame the ranch and my addiction to it haha. Probably my lack of exercise as well as various other things. On our way home we rocked out to Savage Garden & old Shania Twain music. But okay so here's the deal, I needed new bras. Badly. I had only three that fit me properly, so I bought four more...for nearly 92 bucks! I got them at Kohls too! I was sort of shocked it came to that total for only four, but then again I told myself it was worth it because I badly needed some. 

Then, I don't believe I'd mentioned this (maybe I have..) but on the way up to Valley Scare last weekend I got a random number off of a bench in Winnebago. For fun, randomness..if it ended up being a creeper I would have just deleted the number and never contacted the person again. So I blocked my number and texted him, his name is Travis, he's 16, a Junior in High School, and lives in Wells. The only people he knows in Winnebago are Kate (my ex's girlfriend) and Chelsey, so he's not a creeper. He wants to hang out with me actually...on Saturday. So I asked Steph if she wants to go with me to meet him. This might be totally and utterly and completely awkward, but a fun experience maybe? Haha..

Also tonight my little brother Jack is having a Halloween party at his house, so whence my mom gets off work I believe we're heading up to Windom. I bought a little cat mask so I'm all set! Pretty excited about it as well because I think it's been nearly a month since I've seen Jack, or it feels like it's been nearly a month, but in fact actually hasn't been that long at all. After Jack's party I'm heading into town and Brittany and I are staying, for the first time ever, over night at Sam's house! Her Birthday is on Sunday so this is sort of like a mini-birthday celebration; though her actual one is when we go up to Mankato next weekend to see Micah's band and whatnot. 

I know I shouldn't be bashing on people..it's wrong and not responsible and childish, but seriously...there is this girl in my grade, whom I use to be actually pretty damn close with, but am not anymore for specific reasons, who hasn't shown up in school like at all this week. She's failing all of her classes, so I was told, and doesn't want to come to school if she has to ride the bus because she thinks it's lame for Seniors to be riding a bus to school. She can't drop out because she's not 18 and her parents won't sign a thing saying she can drop out, so from how I see it she's just basically not coming to school until she misses enough days to where she's expelled. Seriously, what's the point? She wants to do all these different things with her life and go places, but how is that going to be possible if she puts in zero effort? She is smart, she just don't give a damn and doesn't try. I just, I guess I don't understand why someone would just basically give up like that. I know I don't know what's going on in her life right now and that could really be effecting her concentration and such, but still. I dunno, this was probably really rude and immature of me to post this paragraph about her, but I needed to vent it out of my system."

I think I'm gonna either be getting my period today or tomorrow or sometime very soon. I don't want itt yettt! 
I also want to go to Mankato after school today, but everyone seems to be busy! Sam & Brittany work. I asked Deidra, since she brought up last week how we never do anything outside of school or work together, and she is suppose to hang out with Clint, but she will let me know. It'd be cool if she could come with =] Cause I really do want to spend time with her outside of the box so to say. She is family, though very distant, I still consider her as close as any of my other cousins =D and she's fun to be around. When I'm with her she brings back a mixture of my kidness which is fun once in awhile, but it's a mature enough kidness I don't act like a total dork XD Anyways, if De can't go I'm gonna see if my dad will go with me because I guess he was talking about going up to Mankato to Menards to get some bricks for our wood stove. He could do that while I do my jeans & bras & kitty mask for Halloween shopping!

It's also a pretty mucky day out =[ rainy and cold. I'm also pretty tired, I nearly fell asleep in Adv. Algebra & Government, I think I'll go to bed early tonight. Other than that today has been pretty good. Last night I hung out with Sam and Brittany for awhile and they had a long talk about everything really, me saying a few things here and there because I didn't really know what exactly to say and I felt like if I said anything it'd be stupid compared to what they were saying or just slow the conversation down. So I kept my mouth shut and listened. Then we took lots of picturesss! (up on Sam & Brittany's Facebook, will soon be up on mine when I decide which ones I like lots and such). 

So yesterday Sam got her phone taken away. And I guess the first offense to that is that our school gets to keep the phone over night and you have to have a parent come in with you the next day to get it back. This was her first time EVER and she didn't even get a warning! Also I've heard rumors that they look through your stuff on your phone! Like texts and pictures and all...and if they find anything 'bad' they'll turn it in. Which I think is dumb, it's our phones! They don't have a right to be sitting there looking through our private things! That's like us breaking into the office and looking through student records basically. So Sam asked for her battery back, thank God. If I ever get my phone taken away I'll just turn it off because mine has a lock and a password for when you turn it on and also to read and look through my texts. =] 

I think I'm gonna start a comic collection. Because I absolutely love them, I think I've always known this, but never really thought about it. Maybe someday I'll round up all of my favorites and make a comic scrap book =] I think that'd be fun!"

But I always have time during other releases...I'm too lazy and excited for after school to worry right now. After school Sam wants me to help her put up posters :S in her bedroom I believe...she didn't really specify lol. Then there are other things I'm going to do whence I get home soo squeee =D exciting! 

OH VALLEYSCARE WAS AMAZING! I have always hated roller coasters and the like, but Brittany made/forced me on some. We went on the Renegade (fastest roller coaster there) first and we waited in line for over an <b>hour!</b> but it was worth it, it was so much fun! Then we went on the Xtreme Swing and I screamed bloody murder on that thing! But it was also lots of fun =]. Then we went into all of the haunted houses, which there was like 4 or 5 of them. A creepy clown one and an insane asylum one...and a hay trail one...and I can't remember what the other themes were...But when the time came for Steel Venom, I tried every possible angle to get myself to not go on that ride, even when Brittany and I were next to go on the ride and we were waiting for the people before us to be done I was trying to get out of it. I went on it, kept my eyes shut the entire ride, screamed the whole time, and apparently held on for dear life because once I got off the ride I had deep fingernail marks in my palms! LOL Then I also went on the Corkscrew, which I kept my eyes open the entire time (it goes upside down and in circles  kind of roller coaster), but it was SO SHORT I'd always thought the ride was longer than that! Also I'll never ever go on the Wild Thing, I know I told Brittany I would, but I <i>can't!</i> whenever I go to Valley Fair I get bad vibes whenever I see that ride and almost every time I've been there at some point in the day/night the ride has to be shut down for a bit because of technical difficulties. So I don't care if anyone gets mad at me for not going on it with them they can suck it up LOL I can't do it. Anyways I better say who I all went with..Brittany, Steph, Charlotte, Carley, Emily, and Julia rode up with us and went on a few rides with us, but then met up with some other friends and went home with them. In one of the haunted houses one of the people dressed up to scare people came up to me and asked if I was with the small group ahead of Brittany and I (Steph, Emily, Charlotte, Carley) I told him yeah and he asked  what one of their names was. First one that comes to mind was Charlotte so I told him and he asked which one that was, so I told him the girl in the red. He lets our group walk around the house for a bit and then he popped up ""CHARLOTTE! COME AND PLAY!! CHARLOTTE!!!"" and ran after us all the way out of the house, I was laughing sooo hard!! In the end they found out how he knew her name though, I still laughed XD fun fun. 

Well I do believe that is all for now...=]

<b>EDIT:</b>
So I guess I also went on the Power Tower and forgot to put that in XD This ride is fun, I've always loved it =]"

That's what we're starting in Communications class and we're gonna be researching topics during class, yet, I've seemed to already done a bit of researching on my own already during my release =] because I'm just that excited. I'm doing mine on Seal Bashing (or Seal Clubbing) in Canada. Sam was talking to me about it at work last night when I was asking for ideas for a topic; when she told me about this I got really sympathetic towards these baby seals, yeah BABIES! For their fur. I'm not totally against using real fur for coats and everything, but clubbing a baby seal on the head until it dies, some aren't even dead when they begin to skin them, is just...wrong and sad. =[

On another note, I'm sort of in a funk. Lately I haven't had that much to say in general when I'm around friends or anyone because there isn't really much going on in my life right now to talk about. I know this is frustrating  and worrying some of my friends, but I wish they wouldn't worry. This happened last year too where for like a month or so I didn't talk much because I felt like I'd run out of things to talk about. =[ It's not that I've <i>changed</i> or am disliking anyone because I'm not. Just in a funk right now that I can't get out of at the moment. The only happenings in my life right now is work and school. Nothing else and nothing all that eventful happens at one place or the other anymore. Everything is just sort of blurring together. So friends of mine who do read this, bare with me? 

MEA is this weekend. Only a tomorrow left for classes and then I don't have to set foot inside this building until next Tuesday. OH in Government for that Congress thing that we did, it was out of 85 points and I got a perfect on it! I was so proud of myself =] I'm so SO close to having a B in that class too I'm right on the edge of a C+ B- range and UGH if I do really good on the test tomorrow (which I have a feeling I will) that will push up my percentage up a few notches into the B range. Also I think/hope the test in Adv. Algebra I took yesterday pushes my C back up to a B because I feel I did pretty good on that test. 

I'm also getting a cold soar and I hate getting those :( they're annoying and hurt and frustrate me. But other than that everything is going alright right now. Though I'm super tired and don't want to do much of anything . OH I've also been unbelievably thirsty lately. No idea why, but I could drink an entire bottle of water in less than 3 minutes if I really wanted to. Maybe it's the weather? Seems like I'm blaming everything on the weather lately lol.  Well I feel like I'm rambling now so I might as well end this and go to my locker to switch books and all that lovely jazz.

Last night is actually a hilarious story. But I will get to that later, first I want to go over this weeks days and what's been going on and such =] So Monday we had a 2hr delay, no dress up days. Tuesday was Class Colors day, so Seniors had to wear black. Wednesday  was 'Bling' day and I ended up dressing sort of ghettoish, but not really. I took Hummer's hat from him and wore that and a bunch of huge necklaces I got from Steph & Sam. Because I have no 'bling' of my own XD. Thursday was 80s day, and I dressed pretty rad and did my hair all cool like. Then today is School Colors (Maroon & Gold) day.

Last night was pretty fun =] 
And now I must get ready for work which I don't want to go to :( I don't feel in the working mood right now lol I feel in the 'lazy katie day' kind of mood. 
I actually want to watch InuYasha O_O
I also have to work on my speech when I get home

"event","I haven't posted in awhile so I thought it might be about time. 
Let's see so far I've had 2 classes, and 2 tests.
My Advanced Algebra test, I'm not so sure how I did on that, maybe a C material test...
My Government test on the other hand I think I did pretty spiffy on. But only time will tell..
Then in Communications today everyone (whom is finished) will present their Authentic Speech. It has to be 3-5 minutes long. I'm not doing mine today though because Mrs. Alleven was absent the day I chose to do mine on a Eulogy and thought we could use something someone else had written. Being she was absent she couldn't inform me that we cannot use something someone else has written. So she told me yesterday that I don't have to give mine until Monday if I don't want to. So I'm not going to give it until Monday =] I wrote a Eulogy about my Grandpa Kuhn, when I was originally going to recite a small speech Topher (my uncle Doug's friend) gave at his Funeral only a few weeks ago. 

Aside from school, life has been okay. I didn't feel well earlier this week though which wasn't fun at all. I was having hot flashes and chest pains (plus my period). I'm not sure why though, Steph thinks the chest pains might have something to do with me having the symptoms of an oncoming heart attack in May. (I don't think I ever posted about that O_o..after Post Prom last school year I had serious pain shooting down my chest and my left arm and I couldn't breathe right because every breath I took I had sharp pains, and Alex had told me those are the signs of a heart attack). But I'm not sure, because the pains went away in the morning. I thought it was really nice how Ben asked Brittany if I was alright because I hadn't talked to him since I'd told him I was having really bad chest pains. =] It makes me smile how he worried so much. 

So I like Dashawn again, yes again, and I have a lot harder time talking to him in school now than I ever use to during Freshmen year. Why? Maybe it's because of the people he hangs around. Or how I'm really nervous and don't know what to say? I sent him a message on Facebook saying how we should hang out sometime, and he said yeah that would be nice, so I sent him one back asking when, and he never messaged me back. This was like last week too O_O and I know he's been on Facebook since then because he's updated things. Is he avoiding it? Does he really not want to hang out with me? Ugh, I don't know!"

"event","Hmm today today, was a boring day. I almost fell asleep in Government O_o Mr. Bartcher just was not interesting at all. But we have a test in that class tomorrow and I also have a test in Communications tomorrow. Then I had a test in Adv. Algebra today. So my grades are going to finally be in swing now! Which I dunno if that's a good or a bad thing O_O LOL!

I suppose it's Alex's birthday today as well. He's finally 18. Wo wo.
I went to Fairmont with Brittany earlier and bought the movie 27 Dresses, I haven't seen it, but Brittany told me I'd love it so I think I'll watch that tomorrow =] Then in a little bit I'm gonna leave and go into town to play pool with Brittany at Double Play. LOL! It seems like everyday we're not working we go into that place at one point or another. It's pathetic and awesome all at the same time.

Well I suppose that's all for now..I don't really have much else to talk about at the moment."

"event","I made a new friend today! =] Her name is Dasha and she is from...wait for it...<b>Russia!</b>. She's a forgein exchange student at my school this year and I have Government and Communications with her. =] I saw her at Lunch and she stood in line with Sam & I and then sat with us at Lunch. Which was cool cause Sam and I got her number. I told Brittany how the four of us should all hang out some day =] Cause I feel sort of bad for Brittany and how she's gonna miss out on cool 'Senior Year' events that we've been hearing about for years. So I feel this might be a small way to have her experience at least something neat this year. Being friends with a new person =] But Dasha is awesome, nice, and I love her accent. It's like a mix between a Russian accent and a British accent. She's been to Britian, Spain, America, and of course Russia. She knows three languages: Russian, Spanish, and English. Which is sweet! 

Also I did the most <b><i><u>embaressing</b></i></u> thing today!! Alright here's the story. 
I see these jeans laying on the floor this morning and I look at them for a few moments and I think <i>'Hmm I really love these jeans, I think I'll wear these today.'</i> So I slip them on, go downstairs and get ready, then leave for school. I get to school and sit down infront of my locker to finish up some Government homework. Sam arrives and sits with me, while I'm shifting myself while sitting I'm wondering in my mind, <i>'Why in the heck can I really <b>feel</b> the carpet on my butt right now?!'</i>. Then I realize, I'm wearing the jeans that have a huge hole in the butt! I quickly put my jacket around my waist and start laughing. Tell Sam what's the matter. So for the first two periods of the day I had to walk around with my sweater wrapped around my waist. Then during my release I drove home and changed. On my way back into town I hit a phesent! (Don't know if I spelt it right) But the dumb thing was just standing there so I thought I was good and RIGHT when I get close enough it decides to fly out and collide with my car. 

So all-in-all I had a pretty eventful day XD
Now I'm extreamly hungry and I want to eat supper!"

"event","bug bites are totally annoying times twelve. 
lets see during work last night i delivered. there was this one guy who called, he orders all of the time, the same thing, a small medium meat eaters pizza light on the sauce. he lives on 214 N Moore St. and his house always smells funny. anyways, he calls and says he wants it for carry out instead of delivery. which sort of shocks me since he never does that he always wants it delivered. anyways so we make the pizza and it sits ontop of the oven, about an hour later i see it's <b>still</b> sitting there. so i call him to make sure he wanted carry out and not delivery, he said he wanted delivery. so i told him i'd be there in a few minutes. when i get to his house i apoligize to him and he says to me, ""No it was my fault I said carry out when I ment delivery."" his pizza cost 9.57, he gives me 21 bucks and says, ""Keep the change"". Shocker, yeah cause usually this guy tips like crap. So I didn't say anything but thank you and have a good night and I left. I made more just  then than i make in an hour at work. so in conclusion at the end of the night I'd made almost 40 bucks in tips on just 10 deliveries. That's like, more than half of what is usually made in tips on ten deliveries, but then again it all depends on who you deliver to and how well they decide to tip you.

in government class on friday we did nothing but talk about the elections and democrats and republicans and liberals and libertarians and populists and that other C one i dont remember. i discovered i'm a litertarian. and we didn't get to anything mr. bartcher wanted to get to during class and he said that was alright cause this was fun to talk about. then in communications we had to do a dramatic thing and line up and walk around the media center doing this dramatic skit ""TOMORROW AND TOMORROW AND TOMORROW..etc.."" it was pretty hilarious because all these other students just stopped what they were doing and watched us. we're suppose to recite a poem tomorrow, but i'm not going into school tomorrow. ma is pulling Tucker and I out on account of Doug's funeral. :( I also talked to Karen and she said I didn't have to come into work tomorrow night which I was greatful for because if she would have said no I think I would have quit on the spot right then and there. 

Ben is coming home in less than 6 hours! =] I'm excited, even though I can't see him. I wish I could :( But now I'll get to see pictures from Finland and talk to him on a more regular basis of my day to day talking with him. =]=]

Also, last night, I get online and check my myspace and here I have a message from Kate, Nick's girlfriend. (Nick is my ex if anyone questions who Nick is). She just totally starts bashing on me and I haven't done anything! I haven't talked to Nick since June when he was in Montana! So I straightened her out in a reply and she replied back saying she didn't know what got into her etc. etc. But <b>MAN</b> I was pissed last night when I read all that stuff. Pissed and confused because I didn't know where all of this was coming from. But everything is all good now, I think. I dunno I don't want any drama bullshit this year. I delt with enough of that crap last year and I don't like it not one bit."

"event","Is a wonderful movie! I just finished watching it with my little brother. Yeah Tucker watched the movie with me, lol total chick flick and he loved it. I believe I want to buy this movie. Well besides the movie today was a pretty eventful day. School went by pretty awesomely, for my Release I crammed on Adv. Algebra homework and then I went and sat with Steph when she had lunch and we tried calling Ben, but he didn't answer, so we're gonna try again tomorrow. Lol she wants to talk to him and she dosen't even know what she's gonna say to him! Ugh it seems like when I ran upstairs to grab my laptop I had tons of things swimming in my brain on what I wanted to post and now I can't remember of hardly any of them! Tomorrow is already Friday. Brittany was saying something about going down to Britt, Iowa to hang out, but I don't know if that's gonna happen or not cause she hasn't said anything to me. Well my uncle Doug passed away last night =[ my aunts' Cheri & Koni came over a little bit ago to talk to us. His funeral is gonna be on Monday night and everyone is suppose to dress casual. Which I think is alright since Doug was never really one to dress up for anything. I'm gonna miss him a lot. I already do miss him and I feel so bad for little Jakie.

OH! I remember one thing I was gonna talk about. In communications class today we got together with a partner and were given a pink slip. Deidra and I were partners and on our slip it told us how we had to make up a conversation and one of us had to intrupt the other all of the time during that conversation on a different topic. Then after practicing we had to present our little conversation infront of the entire class. De volunteered us to go first! LOL So we get up there and do our thing and I suppose we did an awesome job because everyone in the class clapped (for the rest of the skits hardly anyone clapped lol). Our conversation consisted of me telling Deidra about how my dog had to get shot because she had a disease and my dad didn't want her to suffer. Now I put emotion into my voice and made it sound like I was about to cry so I was doing a good job I thought =] and De kept intrupting me about her day at work and at the end we hugged and it was good. =] Lol though I still hate getting up infront of the entire class doing anything, scares the bajeebies out of me.

I think this school year is going to be a good one. I don't know why, but I have this strange feeling that I'm going to enjoy it very much. (Now watch me post 4 months from now saying I hate it and just want to leave lol!)"

"event","Tomorrow I have lots to do. More than a normal day in the life of Katie Kuhn. Lol XD 
In the morning I gotta pick up Courtney and take her to the high school, then go to Paul's shop so he can put a perminant patch on my tire. He's gonna let me take his truck and drive that back to the high school. I'm gonna see if I can get my car back during 3rd hour (my release) so I can run to Wal-Mart and get some Loose-Leaf paper, Notecards, Tissues, Dividers, Pack of Pencils, and a One Subject Notebook. All of this is mostly for Communications class, a few is things for extra credit. I think I'm gonna jump at any extra credit chance I can get this year. Then I should pay my car insurance sometime this week cause it's due on the 12th. 

Yep, during the summer i wouldn't do half of those things because I wouldn't need to. Well the tire thing maybe, but not all the buying and the picking people up and dropping them off and getting things for school and the extra credit. 

Then what's a girl to do, when she has a guy friend, who left after Freshmen year and now is back for the Senior year? Dashawn and I use to be awesome friends =] Now out of the 2 days of school we've had we've only said hi to eachother twice. Well I said hi to him in the hall and then he waved at me in class. Yes, I even have a class with him and we don't talk. I feel awkward. But I do want to be his friend again =] He still has an anime tape of mine actually! LOL. I guess there is a small twist in this though. I had feelings for Dashawn and not long before he moved I let him know of these feelings and he was considering them, but nothing ever happened. He moved. I suppose that's what happened. But I mean now I'm not looking for a relationship, well yeah I am, but not with him. If something were to happen though, which I highly doubt will, I wouldn't mind it. He also hangs out with DJ and Alex Menk. DJ, fine yeah, I can talk to DJ because he's friggin family and I work with him and he's my friend. But Alex Menk? Yeah. My point exactly. Dashawn is friends with all of the people I'd rather not associate myself with, he always has been. Besides me. 

Man I still have homework. Bah, it's not a lot I'll get it done. Anyways my mom made cake right? I thought I could handle the frosting. I couldn't. I had about five bites with the frosting and I had to turn that puppy on its side and cut it off. I've never liked frosting and I don't believe I ever will! Except for that one frosting my mom had on my birthday cake one year. I don't remember what it's called though! Arughhh. My husband is gonna hate me. Not wanting frosting on anything! He's gonna think I'm insane! LOL. I don't like frosting, I don't like cutting my meat (yes I leave it in a hunk and stab it with my fork and eat it like that), I don't eat potato skins (often, depends), etc...So many things I'm picky about/don't like. 

Oh! You know the contacts I got? Maybe I didn't post about them, but I got contacts. Yeahh...I can't even put them in myself. I can take them out of my eye, I just can't put them in. I tried, and I just <i>DON'T</i> like things in on or around my eyes. Never have, probably never will! I don't see why the doctor could put them in my eyes but I couldn't. Anyways, on the ride home my eyes were bugging out and I had to blink every--all of the freaking time! I know my eyes probably need to get adjusted, but I don't think I can do it. Good thing they're trial contacts. I'm gonna just get a new pair of glasses instead. 

I also want Ben to come back from Finland >.< I don't like not telling him about my day like I use to. Expically now that school's started and I've so much to talk about! Plus he's like my rock, and now that that rock is half-way across the world and has been for damn near a month I've no supportage! LOL that's a funny way to put it. *Sigh* I don't talk about him much on here because I don't want a lot of people to know about him. That sounds selfish, but it's more complicated than that. Complications I'd rather not explain right now. 

Also, I loveee accents!! End of story. Till tomorrow =]
(I wonder if all of my entries are gonna be this long, lol I started having fun telling about everything again. Actually having something to tell)."

"event","I wonder if I should start posting almost everyday again now that the school year has started. Always during the summer I lack posting as much as I do during the school year because during the summer not that much happens in my day. Where as during the school year a lot can happen in one day. Like today. The day isn't even over yet and I've already gotten a bunch (not really a bunch, but quite a bit) of homework for Adv. Algebra and Government. I have Release right now so I don't need to be back at the school until about 1:20pm. I'm at Alex's right now waiting for Brittany and I'm gonna go with her to help her with her laundry. Then during lunch someone came up to me and told me she thinks someone stole something of hers from her locker, and it's only the 2nd day. XD But I plan to post more when I get home if I'm not too terribly tired. Because right now I feel I have a lot I want to type about, but not enough time to type it all. When later I'll have forgotten half of these things I want to type about but I'll come back on here and tell you more about my day anyways. *Sigh* I really wish I didn't have Communication's class. But that's my next class, and last one of the day. I have it with Deidra so it's alright, we're doing this thing where we're in groups and reading these passages outloud to one another and we have to tell the one who was reading at the time how they did and what they can improve when they're speaking. >.< Deidra is, of course, in my group =] after she switched with someone else, XD. Well this is all for now, byebye lovelys :D"

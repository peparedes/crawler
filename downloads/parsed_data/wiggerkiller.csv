You are elegant, withdrawn, and brilliant.
Your mind is a weapon, able to solve any puzzle.
You are also great at poking holes in arguments and common beliefs.

For you, comfort and calm are very important.
You tend to thrive on your own and shrug off most affection.
You prefer to protect your emotions and stay strong.</font></td></tr></table>

"event","so, today was just another run of the mill boring school day, but other then that my life has been pretty much all shit. do u ever have one of those times in ur life where everything doesnt seem so bad and ur almost oblivious to all thats around u, well i think ive been having one of those periods for the last six or seven months and now i beleive its drawing to an end. i dont want it to, but i dont think i really have a choice. im starting to feel my old ways creeping up on me. i dont want them, i was fine without them, but with each passing day i find it harder and harder to keep my old depressing feelings at bay. i dont know what im gonna do, ive tried talking about it, ive tried ignoring it, but nothing seems to work. i think the reason is that i truly dont know the reason why i feel this way, and everything just seems so hopeless, i dont know what im gonna do, ive got to many things i have to do, to many people are relying on me, i just wish i could rely on someone like they rely on me, i cant talk about whats bothering me cause i dont know what it is. it seems hopeless."

"event","so, i cant sleep again, i dont know why i am unable to sleep for more then 5 hours. it sure would be nice to not fall asleep in school everyonce in a while. i hate it. today has been full of odd circumstances. but u know what, for the first time, i dont care. im gonna see jen tomorrow, and really thats all i can think about. not because of anything sexual we might do, but because im genuinely excited to dee her, i miss her a whole lot. i'd give anything just to be able to hold her in my arms forever. i love her more then anything. she fills my life with joy, and every time i talk to her, i feel the warmest feeling, i feel secure. does that make me sound a little gay? o well, i have to fucking find out when homecoming is, no one can tell me for sure, im freaking out. and will someone please tell me whats up with this bullshit, the quiz, its stupid. poeple keep asking me to take there quizes. i refuse to take another quiz, unless u make one with truly worthy, thought provoking questions."

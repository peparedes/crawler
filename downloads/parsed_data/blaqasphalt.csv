"event","I'm starting to get a little rage building up in me. 
It's not from the heat, or the muggy clammy weather.
It's not because i took my son back to his other house today. 

It's just that sometimes i get like this and want to scream and smack and break things, i want to get right up in to peoples faces and tell them to shut the fuck up they don't know what they're talking about or what they're saying is pointless fucking drivel. 

But i can't do those things, because its not who i am really.
Only, it is. 

It's part of me, and i ache because i can't release such things. 
I hurt inside because i have no way of just lashing out that wont cause lasting harm to those around me. 

My head pounds and all i see is a blur because i cry at the futility of it all, the futility of myself futilely doing futile things.

Please, forgive me, sometimes i just need to scream and rant and rage.
Sometimes i need to do these things because i'm normally so contained and compartmentalised.

Some time's it seeps out round the edges of me, and sometimes i look at myself and recoil in dismay for losing track of myself and slipping and think ""did i just say that? was i that unnecessarily mean and nasty to some one simply because they spoke?"".

And then i relisten in my head to what they said and it's just shit.
Banal and utterly pointless.

And and and...

Right now i feel like im going round in circles in my head, theres things i Want to do, things i Need to do, but i just sit here, doing nothing about it, about anything because sometimes i just cant be bothered, because when i say ""so, can you help me..."" only to have it thrown back in my face with some witty remark or some such.


I rage because i have no release. 
I have no release because i am me but only partly so.

For the last month things were better, medicated and comfortably doing well in my self, but now the pain is returning and i'm just venting because i need to do that sometimes because normally people vent to me, i'm the one that sits there, listening, patting the shoulder, physically or cyberphorically (like metaphorically but through the computer). 

Right now my music, is doing nothing for me. 
It's not touching me. 
And that is disappointing. 

I cant use the multigym we have until the Dr's decided whats up with the lymph node in my hip, and thats causing me a lot of problems. 
I took the last of my painkillers today, and they've now all worn off.
Totally and utterly.

And once more i'm starting to hurt, i can feel it all building up in me and and i just dont care for it. 
Not in the slightest.


Bah.
Possibly with humbugs."

Left arm noticeably weaker than right arm, especially around the elbow.
Otherwise, good rotation for me to start with and build from.
Only started to sweat with 2nd set of Steps.
Possibly repeat pre-dinner in PM.

Need to find out what each bar is equivalent to on gym.. 4.5kg Vinyl Weights. 
Lol im weak then XD. using the top weight which is the same as the plate weights.

1 weight = 9kg
2 weigh = 13.5kg

double that on the bench press apparently due to the pullies, so not as naff as i thought i was, but still pretty naff XD"

"event","Sands:
(Origin Danish) Sense, wit; or it may be from Sand, Sandy, a Scottish abbreviation of Alexander.

Others:
   1. Greek: Defender of mankind; feminine form of Alexander
   2. Greek: The original prophet of doom in classical mythology
   3. English: Defender of mankind
   4. Greek: Protector of mankind
   5. English: One with nature
   6. Middle English: Alexander's son
   7. Old English: Dweller at the sandy ford

There are two possible origins for this Anglo-Saxon surname, the first being that it is a topographic name for a dweller at or by a patch of sandy soil. The derivation is from the Old English pre 7th Century 'sand', sand, with the Old High German 'sant', and the Old Norse 'sande', having the same meaning, giving rise to this surname in Scotland, Germany, Denmark, Norway and Sweden. However, Sand may also be a short form of the given name Alexander, or the popular medieval given name Sander, and in this instance would be the patronymic form (the 's' denoting son of). The following examples illustrate the name development after 1205 (see below): de la Sonde (1248), atte Sonde (1296), del Sond (1298) and del Sandes (1332). In St. Margaret's, Westminster, on November 18th 1630, one Thomas Sands married Mary Sandsberry. The first recorded spelling of the family name is shown to be that of William de Saudes, which was dated 1205, Curia Rolls of Surrey, during the reign of King John, known as 'Lackland', 1199-1216. Surnames became necessary when governments introduced personal taxation. In England this was known as Poll Tax. Throughout the centuries, surnames in every country have continued to ""develop"" often leading to astonishing variants of the original spelling.



Along with the meaning of my first name only re-enforces the fact that i Should really be crowned King Of The World.

This is good.  I've even been comfortable wearing a shortsleeve shirt for work with out feeling like i'm going to melt regardless.

I guess over all i forgot that i was born on a little island, where the summers were either Very hot or it was Wet for half of them.
I never used to be filled with snot etc when i lived there, it wasnt until i developed asthma that the hayfever started up as well.

I suspect my frequent visits to the island have bought back some of the old tolerances, which is good.

It means i'll be doing much more outdoorsy type stuff, i especially liked the walk in the park on a hot day last week with out feeling like i was again melting or being filled with snot. Woot for outdoorsy type stuff.

"event","Seeing as it's been a few months since the last Ad Update..



What is the Red Court?

Well, a quick Google search will bring up all kinds of things, Hotels, Rapier Schools, Holiday Results, and most importantly, Us.
And eventually hopefully our website when i can get of my butt to sort it out.

For us, the Red Court is the name of the game we play in.
Originally it was called Kings College Nights, as the game was due to be set in and around the Kings College Campus.

It's a Political Supernatural game of Intrigue that is similar to Rome, with a healthy dose of Buffy, Angel, Charmed, Dresden Files (And the Jim Butcher novels), Anne Rice, the Hunger and backstabbery worthy of Battlestar Galactica.

Oh, and we sometimes smack eachother around with latex weapons as well..


~~~~~~~~~~


In our game you play Vampires, or their servants.
Immortal, Ageless, and hungry for blood and personal power within vampiric circles and within the mortal world.

Our game is set in a darker version of the real world, we use rules as presented in the World of Darkness game Vampire the Masquerade (3rd ed), with one or two exceptions.

The main one is that being ""Goth"" and wearing a Frilly Shirt is not mandatory.
The Vampire games often get some bad press in other LRP circles due to the Frilly Shirt Brigade, or people who in normal time (not in game time) think they really Are vampires and all that might entail.

Our game is socially heavy, we meet once a month for the official ""Court"", where you (the vampires) gather to trade information, insults and garner allies.
As well as the Court once a month, we also use a system called ""Downtime"" which is the periods inbetween the Courts where a vampire accheives their other goals not (usually) involving others from the Court.


~~~~~~~~~~


There are many kinds of vampires in the world but they mostly belong to Clans & Bloodlines, many of which are available to the players.
Seven of the Clans and bloodlines belong to a sect called the Camarilla, who are the ""Good Guy"" vampires.
Well, as much as a blood drinking immortal creature of the night could ever be a good guy...


Each Clan or Bloodline has a sort of stereotype for the vampires that belong within its ranks, however players are not required to ""Play to Type""


Brujah
In modern nights the brujah are a rough and ready clan, the anger of the Beast rise to the surface, and they can often be found in the Roughest bars.
Typically Bikers, Thugs or Bouncers, the Brujah have a long forgotton history of Intellect however...

Gangrel
The loner Gangrel, companions to the animals of the earth and sky.
Survivalists and Eco-Aware individuals fill the clan in the modern nights.
As they grow older, the Beast begins to show its mark in their face and body.

Malkavian
Touch by some inner madness, the malkavians embrace anybody.
There are no typical Malkavians, each one, just like his insanity, is unique.

Nosferatu
The subteranian Nosferatu wear their Curse visible to the world, hideous to behold, they often posess a softer and more humane nature.
Nosferatu by their enforced nature tend to become infomation gatherers or subtle spies.

Toreador
Art for Arts sake, Beauty is only skin deep, but so is blood...
The toreador are often the Social Elite, artists of one form or another, ever ready to upstage those of lesser skills.
Typically they're artists and musicians, poets and writers, and many become entranced by things which are Beautiful in the world.

Tremere
Secretive and often secluded, the Tremere are Occultists without peer, or so they assure everyone.
Often to the mortal world they appear to be relegious, cultists, mediums or even debunkers of the ""Mystical Realm"".
The tremere are tightly bound to their ruling councel however.

Ventrue
The Political Elite, High Rollers and Movers & Shakers of both vampire and mortal society.
All ventrue feed selectively.

There is also an 8th group of vampires who do not know their heritage or their blood is to weak to show their true heritage, the Caitiff, they are often considered by the other clans to be little more than cannon fodder and perfectly expendable.
These Caitiff often form the bulk of the ""Disafected Youth"" of the system, and are often Anarchs, trying to change the system from within, often with disastrous results!


So, as you can see, you can be just about anything you can imagine as a vampire, from grungy Hippies through to Royalty, so why not give us a try.


~~~~~~~~~~


So, whats it all about? 

Power. Passion. Betrayal.

In the Red Court there is no real Win or Lose.
There is only ""i could have done better from that"" or ""i got so much from that!"".

You play the part of a Vampire, or one of its servants, and its down to you to interact with the world (Also known as the Plot or Story Arc).
Your character might have something others need to succeed in a situation, or you might want to thwart other players from accheiving things because they may start encroaching on what you own or control.

Normally the year will start off with some big event that the Court (the players) will have to react to. How your character would react is entirely up to you. You're free to do just about anything you want in game, however there could be repercussions from other characters or the world of mortals and its authorities.

Want to go killing werewolves? Sure, go for it, however you might be breaching some kind of treaty which could jeopardise the lives of all the vampires in the city.  So, still set on killing all the werewolves? Great, just find a way to blame some one else if it all goes wrong or ge ready to appear out of no where to show you were behind the culling of all those terrible beasts and claim your reward for it!

Virtually Everything you do in the game will have some kind of follow on effect, even if its just word of mouth, or armies knocking at your door at noon to kill you.

Just like the Real World.

What do You Do? 

Me, i run every thing. I'm the God(s) of the setting. It's down to me to ensure that every one has a good time, and that over a course of time a story, or indeed several interwoven stories are all told.
I'm the guy that has to sit down a week and a half before the game and make up Rumours for the players to talk about or follow up, they're kind of like Plot Hooks in movies or books, and i don't mind if they dont get followed, because they may just be good old Red Herrings, there to lead people astray and confuse them as to what is Really Happening.

Its down to me to reply to players Down Times, where they describe what actions they will be taking inbetween Courts to ensure other plaers dont try to shaft them, or indeed to try to shaft other players.
It's all a bit Political. But Fun.

Each day of the game i often make sure our venue is all arranged, collect the money, hand out character sheets and information, catch up and chit chat with players, put new people at ease, and most importantly, have a beer and make sure i enjoy myself as well.
After all, i'm part of the game too.

Do you Really Drink Blood? 

Nope. We're based in a pub, so we drink beer, wine, coke, lemonade, water and juice.
Some players do like to have Red Drinks, like wine, but its not something you have to do. We just Imagine the glasses are not there :)

What if i Want to wear a Frilly Shirt and have a daft Tansilvanian Accent? 

Sure go for it, you won't really get any stick from us...
Much. ;)

Aren't you all a bit big to be playing Pretend?

Probably Yes. But thats not going to stop us now is it?!

What about Werewolves or Wizards?

Shapeshifters do indeed exist, and they are the nemesis of the Vampires, just like in the movie Underworld :)

Wizards also exist, but they are so odd that vampires cannot often distinguish them between normal humans. They weild powers the likes of which no Vampire could ever dream of, they shape reality on its most basic level..

Frankesteins Creation or Ghosts like that Patrick Swayze guy?

Frankenstein Creations don't Technically Exist in our setting, but thats not to say that something Like them might turn up and be a bit of a threat or even a potential Ally to the Court or to just some Characters..

Ghosts however do Exist. In this setting they're called Wraiths, however they are not something that you're allowed to play as their system is dramatically different to the Vampire powers and abilities. But again, there are type of vampires who can control Wraiths, or atleast try to...

Hey, i've heard of Vampire Requiem, is it the same thing?

Yes and No.
It is a game made by the same company who made the rules we use, however it is a totally revised world setting, with a great many things changed.
But if you know about Requiem, then you'll fit right in with our game, it's only the major history and setting thats different.
But if you're playing a Recently Embraced vampire, then you Won't have any need to know much about the Clans, the Camarilla or the Sabbat, so it's really easy to just step in to.

The Red Court is every bit of a Personal Horror Story as Requiem is.
You're in control of your characters actions within the world remember!

Are there any Hawt Goth Chicks/Dudes at your game?

Come along and find out!

What about Costume?

BAH! What vampire in his right mind would go round looking like something from harry potter or some bad fantasy epic that never quite made the big screen?
They dress like every one else (though generally look better whilst doing it) and Lowcut bodices or Uber-Goth isnt the key requirement.

""But ive never played anything like that before.... i'll look like an idiot....""

It is really a very simple game, its all People driven, YOU make the plots (or atleast 80% of them), and you dont have to worry about silly accents, sticky blood or fake fangs either!
Come as you are (or as you think your character might come) and let me worry about the rules, its really rules light!
We've an experianced team of Refs and Asst-Refs who've been LRPing in a number of forms for a long lot of years


~~~~~~~~~~


We meet once a month in Croydon (South London), and we're always looking for new people to come and join, even if you've never done anything like it before, when we first started our game 9 out of the 15 players had never done anything like it at all before.

Somehow we manage to remain pretty Rules Lite, so if you don't know the rules, it's really not a problem in the slightest, but it's always good to bone up on some of the rules regarding what clan you'd like to play and the powers or abilities they get.

I'm sitting back at the pc because i cannot sleep.
Eating pringles.


I have just to many things roiling around in my head right now to sleep.
Roil is a good word, it doesn't get used enough.


I'm feeling let down.
This is where you say ""aww but nick, you is so wonderful how could anyone let you down?""
And i reply with ""i have perhaps let myself down, or simply expected to much from some people, and thus i feel let down because they did not measure up to how i first took them""

Generally i'm not a bad judge of character.
I never judge anyone after meeting them once.
After all, if they're a prick, they may just be having a bad day or some such.

I try to give people the benefit of the doubt.
It's ammusing, i'm quite a tolerant person, and yet i do at times have quite a short fuse.
Not anger wise, but.. i dunno, i just get let down.
I try to take people at face falue (yes at odds with what i said about not judging people when i meet them just the once i know).
What you show me is what i expect you to be.

It's not that i'm naive or anything, i'm not, at all.
Maybe i'm more of an optimist than people suspect.

Through the cloud of pessimism i shine little glitters of optimism.
Or some such crap.


Anyway, yes i'm disapointed right now.
I've wasted a day today, and i dont do that very often, because i gave some one the benefit of the doubt, i once again left the ball in their court so they didnt feel pushed or preasured or what not.
After all, we all have our neurosis' dont we?

I know i do.
And i know most folks i know do as well.
I wear mine quite openly, why hide it.


Maybe thats part of the problem.
If i'm generally pissed of with some one, they know it.
It gets dealt with, then we move on from it.

I'm not one to live in the past.
The past is just a set of footprints that will lead you to me here and now.
I learn from the past.

Yet i dont with some people.
Again, i suppose its the optimist in me.
""just another half hour then i'll call or text..""

The half hour turns into an hour, then three, then the day is gone.
Carpe Diem and all that.

Yet should the moment be seized?
What if i'm not in full possession of the facts?
How can i make a judgement thats fair if i dont know the full story.

Not that there ever is a full story mind you to anything these days.
Used to be a time where there were two sides to every story.
Nowadays its half a dozen sides.

Or maybe thats just me being a tad pessimistic on the matter.

I make judgements and take actions with all the info i have at hand, and if i'm wrong i'm always pleased to be put right, which not everyone is.
If i fuck up (which i do), i learn from it, and try not to fuck up again.
The past learnings bringing me a greater understanding of who/where i am at the present, and thus add to my information pool to make better judgements on stuff.


But right now i dont have the information i need.
I've asked for it, and it hasnt been forth coming.
So i shall have to make a call on it and simply Act instead of waiting forever ""Just incase..""


But yeah, today i was let down twice, by different people, of whom i expected much better than i received.

Oh i know we all have our own lives, but are mates and freinds meant to be hard work and leave you feeling drained or with wasted potential?
No.
If its hard work then it isnt freindship, no matter how much you hold out the olive branch.

So i'll give up, i'll count my loses and learn from them and simply not allow the peopel to really be much a part of my life any more.
Action instead of Thought.

I have thought and so now i shall act.
Well, later today that is, once i have tended to other things.



I still do not feel sleepy, my head is just tumbling over and over itself with thuoghts and ideas for all manner of things.

Maybe it was the lavazza that sighed when the packet was opened thatis keeping me awake?
The gods know i was tired earlier, even when drinking it.
But my brain wasnt really ticking over at that point.

I guess it was still absorbing the whole ""wtf?"" of a situation which may not even exist.
That you see is my own pet neurosis, not so much Over thinking stuff but more ""thinking thinks through to a number of conclusions, like trouser legs of time"".
It's where my Cassandra Complex comes from.


Anywho, my head is a little emptier now.

If you're reading this and thinking ""is this bastard talking about me?"" then you might be feeling a tad guilty over something and it might well be about you, but heres the thing: i'd say it all to your face if it was about you, as you know full well i would.

But guilt is a feeling so many people dont bother with, it ranks so low on the self pity scale as to be all but a pointless emotion in todays society.


I cant be bothered to censer my words.
Let assumptions be made.
It only makes an Ass out of you, not me when assumptions are made.



Night folks."

"event","I'm leaving this post public just so that everyone is aware that what you read here, if it's not that day, then it's quite likely that i dont feel like i spoke of.  If its more than a week old, i've probably forgotton it, and if its more than a month ago, i dont care.

The past tries once in a while to bite me on the bum, and fails miserably.
So if you read the archives, it is not a indicator of how i am or feel these days.

And because you needed to read that then it means that you really shouldnt really be trying to poke in to my past anyways so vamoose!

The past is the past, i live for today and tomorrow.

(UPDATE)
I've gone through my backlog and put just about everything on to F-List only.
Not much left on Public other than some MEMEs and thats it really."

It's unreadable.

It still appears to be spinning, and it's not a problem with the circuit board (as I swapped it with an identical one with no avail). Heck, the <a href=""http://www.meetmyattorney.com/slink/mt-archives/000275.html"">freezer trick</a> didn't even work. It's not clicking, and I don't believe it's making any unusual sounds.  The bottom line is that the computer sees it, but can't read from it.

<EM>Your mama's so fat,

She makes elephants stampede

She drowned in the Rio Grande,

I mean, think about it. You spend, say, a grand on a new PC, only to have it loaded up with malware and running at a tenth of the original speed within a month.

The thing is that most people are <FONT size=3>simply uninformed</FONT> when it comes to such things.

Around <FONT size=3>90% of all PCs</FONT> are infected with some sort of Spyware.

<FONT size=3>What I want to do here</FONT> is make a list of things people <FONT size=3>should know</FONT>. I'll try to explain them all as simply as possible if you don't consider yourself to be very computer literate. Even if you do, you may still learn something!

<HR>&nbsp;
<STRONG><FONT size=5>[A Few Things You Should Know]</FONT></STRONG> <FONT size=-1><EM>very important stuff, </EM><FONT size=3><EM>trust me
</EM></FONT>
</FONT>- Internet Explorer (IE) <EM><U>sucks</U></EM>. <FONT size=3>Don't use it. <FONT size=2>Use Firefox instead. <i>""All the spyware companies exploit bugs in Internet Explorer, so if you use FireFox, there's less of a chance of you getting spyware."" - Greg</i></FONT>
</FONT>- Norton <EM><U>sucks</U></EM>.&nbsp;<FONT size=3>Uninstall it.
</FONT>- <FONT size=3>WeatherBug is adware</FONT>, not something that came with your computer. <FONT size=3>Uninstall it.
</FONT>- You're not <EM>supposed</EM> to have <FONT size=3>forty million tool bars </FONT>(such as Hotbar) at the top of your web browser. If you have <EM>any</EM> that you didn't specifically install yourself, you have adware. <A href=""http://www.flexbeta.net/images/spyware/ie.gif""><FONT size=3>See this</FONT></A><FONT size=3>? <A href=""http://multigraphic.dk/lounge/weblog/images/uploads/toolbars.jpg"">And this</A>?</FONT>&nbsp;Everything below&nbsp;the Address box <FONT size=3>shouldn't be there</FONT>.&nbsp;Then again, you shouldn't be using IE anyway.
- If you have Windows XP, <FONT size=3>install Service Pack 2</FONT><FONT size=2>. It has <FONT size=3>better malware protection</FONT> and a <FONT size=3>fairly decent firewall</FONT> which is good enough for most people's needs.</FONT>

<HR>&nbsp;
<STRONG><FONT size=5>[The programs you need]</FONT></STRONG> <FONT size=-1><EM>trust me, if you have a&nbsp;PC with an internet connection,</EM></FONT><FONT size=-1><EM>&nbsp;</EM><FONT size=2><FONT size=3><EM>you need this stuff
</EM></FONT>
Typically, you need <STRONG>one</STRONG> program for viruses and <STRONG>three</STRONG> for spyware.

<STRONG><FONT size=3>[Browser]</FONT></STRONG> <FONT size=-1>IE is a horrible browser, and should never be used unless absolutely necissary.
</FONT><A href=""http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/"">Firefox</A> is where it's at. Trust me. Ditch IE now, and never use it again. No more popups, no more spyware. Just because IE comes with your computer doesn't mean you have to use it. <EM>There are always alternatives.</EM>

<STRONG><FONT size=3>[Virus]</FONT> </STRONG></FONT>pick one
<A href=""http://www.avast.com/eng/down_home.html""><FONT size=2>Avast! Antivirus</FONT></A><FONT size=2> *OR* </FONT><A href=""http://www.grisoft.com/""><FONT size=2>AVG</FONT></A>
<FONT size=2>Pick your favorite...personally, I like Avast! better, as it has more features.

<STRONG><FONT size=3>[Spyware/Adware]</FONT></STRONG> </FONT>use <U>all</U> of them

<HR>
<STRONG><FONT size=5>[How to Use the Above Programs]</FONT></STRONG> <FONT size=-1><EM>if you can <FONT size=2>figure them out</FONT>, skip this section
</EM></FONT>
<STRONG><FONT size=3>[Avast! Antivirus]</FONT></STRONG> When you download it, they will email you a product key (which you don't have to enter until you open the main program.) Install Avast!, restart your computer, and you'll see two new system tray (bottom right of screen)&nbsp;icons - an 'i' and an 'a'. Right click on the 'i', and click on ""Merge with main Avast! icon"". (You don't <EM>need</EM> to do this, but having one icon is much cleaner than two.) Avast! will, by default, scan for new viruses in the background. However, to do a full system scan, right click on the 'a', go to ""Start Avast! Antivirus"", wait for it to finish performing the memory test, click ""Continue"", select the areas you want to scan (usually your C drive), and start the scan! Once you know the basics, Avast! will guide you through just about all of its features.

<FONT size=3><STRONG>[AVG]</STRONG></FONT> I don't actually have this installed on any of my computers anymore, so I can't give a very detailed walkthrough. If you need any help with it though, let me know!

<FONT size=3><STRONG>[SpywareBlaster]</STRONG></FONT> The purpose of this program is to fix web browser vulnerabilities (in Firefox and IE), which is how spyware typically gets in. Install it. Run it. Click on ""Updates"" (bottom left) then ""Check for Updates"" (bottom center). When that is complete, click on ""Protection"" (top left), then ""Enable All Protection"" under Quick Tasks at the bottom. For now, you're all set with this program.

<FONT size=3><STRONG>[Ad-Aware]</STRONG></FONT> As opposed to SpywareBlaster, Ad-Aware can not prevent spyware and adware - instead it scans your computer and deletes any that it finds. Install it. Run it. Click on ""Check for updates now"" (bottom right, above Start)&nbsp;every time you run the program and update it. When you're done with that and back to the main screen, click on ""Start"", and then ""Next"" to perform a Smart System Scan. When it is completed, select all of the found items (right click, there's an option in there for it), then delete them.

<FONT size=3><STRONG>[Spybot Search &amp; Destroy]</STRONG></FONT> Spybot is like SpywareBlaster and Ad-Aware combined. It has a feature called ""Immunize"" that blocks spyware and it can also scan your computer.

<STRONG><FONT size=3>[Microsoft AntiSpyware]</FONT></STRONG> Still in Beta, but it can sometimes catch things that Ad-Aware and Spybot miss. Another nice feature of this program is that it takes care of a lot of things automatically. It'll detect attempted browser hijacks and&nbsp;spyware trying to install&nbsp;as they occur and block them. AntiSpyware has a lot more automated features than the others, but unless your computer gets <EM>really </EM>bad, you won't need it, and it'll just be taking up space.<FONT face=""Trebuchet MS""></FONT>

<FONT size=3><STRONG>[AIMFix]</STRONG></FONT> Fixes all known viruses affecting AOL Instant Messanger. All you do is run it, it'll shut down AIM, kill virus processes, remove them, and display a list of all the problems it fixed. Very simple to use, no options or anything to mess around with.

<HR>&nbsp;
<FONT size=5><STRONG>[When to Use the Above Programs] </STRONG></FONT><FONT size=-1><EM>what's the point of <FONT size=3>having them</FONT> if you don't </EM></FONT><FONT size=2><EM><FONT size=3>use them</FONT>?
</EM>
</FONT>If your PC is in <FONT size=3>good running order</FONT>, this is when you <FONT size=3>should run</FONT> these programs.

<STRONG><FONT size=3>[Avast! Antivirus]</FONT></STRONG> Runs all the time in the background, but once a month or so, you should run a full scan.

<FONT size=3><STRONG>[AVG]</STRONG></FONT> Same as Avast!

<FONT size=3><STRONG>[SpywareBlaster]</STRONG></FONT> I would recommend updating and enabling all protection&nbsp;every two weeks, maximum.

<FONT size=3><STRONG>[Ad-Aware]</STRONG></FONT> You should perform a Smart Scan every several weeks.

<FONT size=3><STRONG>[Spybot Search &amp; Destroy]</STRONG></FONT> Update, Immunize and scan every few weeks.

<STRONG><FONT size=3>[Microsoft AntiSpyware]</FONT></STRONG> Should automatically update, so just run a scan every few weeks or so.

<FONT size=3><STRONG>[AIMFix]</STRONG></FONT> If you have an AIM virus, run this.

<HR>&nbsp;
<FONT size=5><STRONG>[Things You Should Avoid Doing]</STRONG></FONT> <FONT size=-1><EM>you know, like <FONT size=3>don't open</FONT> email attachments from people you don't know
</EM>
</FONT><FONT size=2>- First of all, <U>don't open email attachments from people you don't know.</U> This is obvious.
- If someone messages you on AIM with something like ""Check out these pics from the <A href=""http://www.jayloden.com/aimfix.htm"">beach</A>!"" And one of the words links somewhere, DON'T CLICK IT. Another good one is when it's something like ""haha, this is hiliarious: <A href=""http://www.jayloden.com/aimfix.htm"">http://www.funnystuff.com/crowbar.jpg</A>"". Looks like it links right to that, doesn't it? WELL IT DOESN'T. All they did was use a seemingly harmless URL as the <EM>text </EM>for another link. If you see anyone who sends you&nbsp;something like that, or you see it appear in their away message, message them and recommend that they run AIMFix before infecting other people. That's how these things spread.
- <EM>For the love of God</EM>, <U>don't click on anything inside of popup windows</U>. I don't want to see any of this, <EM>""Oh hey! Shoot the monk, get an iPod!!! Sounds like my kind of game!!!""</EM> Of course, if you use Firefox, you won't <EM>get</EM> popup windows.<FONT face=""Trebuchet MS""></FONT>
- Don't scan with more than one Spyware/Adware type program at the same time. Use one at a time. It doesn't hurt anything, it's just inefficient.</FONT>

<HR>&nbsp;
<FONT size=3><STRONG><FONT size=5>[Common Definitions]</FONT></STRONG> <FONT size=-1><EM>you should&nbsp;know what terms such as&nbsp;<FONT size=3>spyware</FONT> mean, but definitions are boring, so I put these last

Ok, so what do <EM>I</EM> do when <EM>I</EM> fix someone's computer from malware? All I do is install either Avast! or AVG, SpywareBlaster, Ad-Aware, Spybot, and MS AntiSpyware and AIMFix if need be. Then I just run them all. <EM>Most of the time this is all that needs to be done.</EM> Sometimes there's really nasty things like viruses running in pairs that if you end one the other restarts the process and you can't kill both at the same time. And sometimes, the whole system is just <EM>so far gone</EM> that what it really needs is a fresh installation of Windows and a new start.

Ok, so last Thursday night. Game 7. That was the day we were going down to Ohio for the wedding. We were staying in Angi's apartment (that she is now moved out of), and she didn't have a TV or a cable connection...so my dad decided to bring our TV since it's only a 13"", and we use an antenna anyway. Well, the game was going to start at 9, and the apartment is just one room (other than the bathroom), so instead of disrupt my mom and sister with the game, my dad rigged up a headphone splitter (mono -> stereo -> dual mono -> each one going to stereo for the headphones) for which he had to make several trips to Radio Shack for. On the first trip, he also picked up a new antenna, since ours was partially falling apart. So anyway, later that night when we were in the apartment, we set up the contraption at about quarter to nine, to tune into the game. ABC is apparently channel 5 around those parts, so that's what we tried to get in. Well...it wouldn't come in at all. Not one bit. So we moved the TV to the door to try to get better reception...but channel 5 still wouldn't come in at all. We tried some other channels and found that we could get the game in <i>slightly</i> on channel 7, but only in black in white, really fuzzy, and with no sound. Alright, so then we moved the TV outside onto the patio, and we could get the picture in color, but still pretty fuzzy and no sound at all. But wait - then I had a brilliant idea! Watch the game on the TV without sound, and at the same time, tune it in on the radio! Well, that didn't work so well either, because we couldn't get in any station broadcasting the game (they only do such things on AM, but we tried FM too, just in case). Well, that idea didn't work so well, so where can we get a better radio? ... the car! So I went to the car, and flipped through every single AM station until I found that 1000 is ESPN Cleavland or something, but it took a while to find because the auto-tune skips over it every time because it doesn't come in very strong from where we were. My dad joined me in the car, but went back to put away the TV at the next commercial break. When he came back, he said ""we're going somewhere where we can watch the game."" Apparently, my mom called a Sports Bar & Grill and found that they were watching the game there, so she wrote down directions for us that the guy gave her, and so we headed off. The guy said head down Broadway, turn left on 6th Street, and it's on this other street down past some hospital. Well, we headed down Broadway and soon found out that 6th Street <i>doesn't go left</i>, so we turned right instead. Now, how to get from 6th to this other street the Bar & Grille was on? Turns out that these were the crappiest directions ever and 6th doesn't even remotely connect to this other street, and ended about 4 miles away from this place. Luckly, we had a map of Lorain and I looked up the location of this place on the street listing, but not before we turned around several times. Ha, so anyway, eventually we got there after the third quarter had already started. We sat down at a table, but after my dad's arm stuck to it and he had to go wash it off, we looked for another one. There ended up being like one table that wasn't gooey, so we sat there. There was only one guy running the place...really, I don't know how they afforded 6 plasma TV's. Ahhh...well after we finally got some food, we sat back and watched the last 1/3 of the game as the Pistons lost. But don't get me wrong, it actually was a pretty entertaining night :-)"

"event","Yesterday was a lot of fun! Basically, me, Anthony, Brock, Lauren, Courtney, and Katie had an awesome barbeque at Stony Creek, then Anthony and I went mountian biking afterwards. I got up <i>way</i> earlier than usual (alright, so it was like 9:30), took a shower, and went over to Farmer Jack to get a pie and some cinnimon rolls to take to the barbeque. Anthony made some bread to take.

We ended up using my bike lock as the final security measure for the bikes, which is actually a <i>pretty</i> good idea if you think about it. It secures the bikes to the rack and it stops someone from quickly grabbing the bikes and running off. So anyway, then we went over to Brock's where everyone else was waiting for us, and then all headed out towards Stony. Well, at least we were hoping it was Stony when we were following Brock there...'cause we took the most <i>in</i>efficient route possible to get there, and it ended up taking like 40 minutes. Once we got there, it was a lot of fun though. We played frisbee and circle-volleyball (the picture is the latter), and had lots of <i>good</i> food. :-)

Aaaand it was really hot out there, so it probably didn't last as long as it would have.

Eventually, we packed up and Anthony and I headed over to the other side of Stony to go biking. We didn't know quite how to get there, so Brock led us to Stony Creek High School via another incredibly inefficient (once again) route through Rochester's back alleys and subdivisions. We parked in a nearby subdivision, across from the entrance we usually take into the biking paths.

Both of us have ridden the trails before, but neither of us <i>really</i> knew our way around, so it took a little while to find the enterance to the first trail we usually ride. But after we did, it wasn't too bad and I managed to find the other trails pretty well. On the first trail, Anth kind of rode off the right side of that bridge and ran into a tree. (I hear Jeff called this one ;-) Not too many slow-downs after that until he took down another tree a while later...this time with pictures!

Alright, I'm out of pics...but this is where it gets exciting! After the hill where it splits off and we could either go straight or right...we decided to go right. Eventually we came to another split where we could go left or right, and both of us remember going right at that point before, so that's what we did. However, that took us back out to the regular park, so we decided to go back and take the other way. Well, that's what we were going to do until the <i>huge, dark</i> thunderstorm clouds came out of nowhere and the winds picked up. Another biker who just rode out of the woods where we had come from told us that we should probably seek shelter in the bathroom (the only sheltered place around) until the rains subsided. At this point, it hadn't even started raining yet, so we debated whether or not to try to make a dash for the car, which was probably about a mile or so away. Turned out to be a good thing we didn't, cause it started raining a few minutes later with <i>huge, cold drops.</i> So we chilled in the bathroom for a little while with our bikes, and then went back outside to decide what to do. By the time the rain subsided, it would probably be too dark to ride the paths back to the car (it was almost 9:00), and there would probably be huge mud puddles and branches all over the paths....so we decided to take the main roads back to the car. We didn't have to think about it too long though, cause there was a very nice couple sitting in their van in the parking lot who eventually drove over and asked if we needed a lift with our bikes back to our car. By this time, it was raining extremely hard, so we loaded our bikes up in the van. I've seen some pretty hard rain before, but I really don't think I've ever seen it rain that hard in my entire life. Anyway, it was a tight fit with his and his wife's bikes in there also. I stood in the back with the bikes (and no it really wasn't that bad back there), and Anthony rode in the front. So we got back to the car and thanked them for the ride, and by this time it had mostly stopped raining. After loading the bikes up to the rack, we had some more bread and drove home, the most efficient way possible, of course ;-)"

Haha, well...guess I'd better start applying around. So much for this new CEO that took over early last year to turn the company around, bringing in a new management board who fired all of the employees under 17 for the stupidest reasons. However, I enjoyed working there most of the time, but after a good 2 1/2 years or so maybe it's time to move on. I'm thinking about getting A+ certified, which is a general computer hardware/software certification, and from what I hear, it's pretty easy. The downside is that is costs almost $100 I think, so what I'll <i>probably</i> do is apply to some computer places around here <i>first</i>, then if none of them take me, I'll get certified and try again. Then if none <i>still</i> take me, I'll just have to try some other places I guess until I find someplace to make some money this summer. You might just find me on Eight Mile ;-)"

Monday evening, Mike Baker - my CS partner, came over around six so we could work on <a href=""http://www.cis.gvsu.edu/~ferguson/cs163/Project3.htm"">project 3</a> (a version of the game, <a href=""http://javaboutique.internet.com/BreakOut/"">Breakout</a>), since we had to turn it in Tuesday morning at 11. To make a short story even shorter, we basically worked on it solid until then, and even a little into the class (so that's a good, what... 18 hours straight?) Mike hadn't gotten any sleep the previous night either, and I honestly don't know how he stayed awake Monday night. Well, actually - he did pass out at one point for a few minutes...and it was rather amusing. I tried waking him up, but nothing seemed to do the trick. I even picked up his arm and dropped it, but he didn't move. So I was like ""I'll try again in a little bit..."" but he woke up half a minute later by himself all confused and having no idea I was trying to wake him up. But anyway, <i>check out the game!</i>

The paddle's angle can be adjusted with the mouse buttons. Left-mouse button to raise the left side, right to raise the right, and both to push it all the way up.

The darker bricks need to be hit twice to be destroyed. After one hit, they turn into the ligher bricks, then are destroyed after the next hit. Those bricks with cages are ""item bricks"" and after one hit, they dissapear and drop their item. (The only items in the game at the moment are ones that change the width of the paddle.)

I still have many bugs to fix and a <i>ton</i> of stuff to add before it's actually worth playing. Adam - <i>your</i> Breakout on the other hand...<i>now that's just dead sexy</i> ;-) When mine is worth playing sometime this summer, you can be sure I'll make it into an applet so y'all can play it online and get addicted :-D

I was actually hoping to get a bit further with the game....but oh well. (We also spent a good three to five hours working on ball to ball collisions, but never got it working well enough to implement into the final version...baaah!!)

I spontaniously got sick Monday night working on the CS project, and on Wednesday, my voice went to crap. Thursday I could barely talk at all, and overall today it's a bit better than it was Wednesday, so I think I'm getting better. This morning was interesting, though. I woke up at 5am coughing and feeling like I was going to throw up...and then I did. After that I felt a bit better, but my stomache still feels weird. I'm hoping I'll be <i>alllll</i> better tomorrow :-) But since I was up at 5, I decided to do my wash, since I forgot to do it last night, so at least something good came out of it ;-)

I should probably be studying for various exams right now, but I found the quickest way for me to start working on <i>other</i> things is to open up my Environmental Science book. Well, that or my European History book. Those classes will definitely contain my most difficult exams, followed by CS, then Math 225, then PLS 102 (if it's like the midterm) being the easiest exam. I found out today that I can get a 50% on my CS final and still get a 92% in the class...haha, but my Prof said that if I didn't get somewhere in the > 80% range, he'd write me a nasty note :-/

...and if you read all that, you're my hero :-)"

If you're curious, the goal of the project was to create a discrete (as opposed to real time) simulation of people entering/exiting several lines in the food court below Fresh Food. The results of the simulation would be displayed at the end. The <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUI"">GUI</a> part was optional, but it's always nice to have extra points just in case we fudged something else up like the code, the layout of the code, or the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language"">UML</a>. (That, and Photoshop is always fun when I feel like I should really be working on the project, but don't feel like coding ;-)

"event","<P>Break was pretty good, I guess. It seemed really short, probably because I slept so much. I got to use Jeff's ballin' $260 headphones for most of the week, so that was <EM>really nice</EM>. (You know what I'm talkin' about ;-) Let's see...well, Organized Living didn't give me any hours, so I worked at PC Mart for two days and made as much as I would have working at OL for three or four...and I got paid right away, instead of waiting a week or two weeks, so that was nice. On Friday I went skating with my mom to break in my skates. I guess a ""factory edge"" on the blades&nbsp;isn't what you want to be skating on though, 'cause I was slipping sideways on every turn. Of course, then I got them sharpened and now they're wonderful. My mom was showing me how to do some stuff and I ended up working on this one thing the whole time...I forget what it's called. It's like where you're skating in one direction and facing the same way,&nbsp;and then you spin around on one foot so that you're still skating the&nbsp;same direction but facing the other way. So yeah, I can <EM>almost </EM>do that now, just need a bit more practice.
Oh, last night Caleb and I completely moved around our room. I like it a lot more and there's a <EM>whole </EM>lot more space in the middle of the room.
Tomorrow I have a test in history that I'm going to fail miserably. So today I'm pretty much just going to be studying for that. There's a study group over at Kirkhof tonight at 8 that I'll probably go to as well. Oh goodness...I <EM>like</EM> that class...I just <EM>hate </EM>the tests. Oh well, I guess now I can look forward to tomorrow <EM>after</EM> my history class. :-)

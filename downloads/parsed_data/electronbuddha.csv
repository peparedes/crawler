"event","my how a month and a half fly when you're having fun.  isn't it funny how you can make time to escape the tedium of work for 5 minutes to go fill your lungs with tar, yet something so simple as keeping a weblog up to date is damn near impossible.
My daily resolution (seeing as my NY resolutions tend to last exactly one day, i figured i'd make daily resolutions i can keep... err... well try to keep for at least a day. Or daylight maybe. Hmm.) is to try to post something here on a daily basis. 

Not for gratitification, seeing as i think the only person who reads my drivel is Paul, but for my own sake so i can look back on my entries in the future and say ""what a bucketmouth loser you were"" to myself."

"event","Looks like i spoke too soon. Orlando managed to pull off their second victory (now 2-19), but Too Short lost a closely fought game last night 73-71. Thankfully we haven't relinquished first place, but now two of our three losses has come at the hand of the Redbacks. Hopefully we'll meet again in the grand final, but for now its back to work-sleep-work-sleep until next week.

I finally bought an xbox. Yay for me."

"event","Well, i finalised the paperwork for the mortgage and the house is almost officially mine (read: the Bank's). Interest rates rose another quarter percent today, the labour party is now being led by a Mr. Mark Latham (westie, born and bred in Campbelltown) and although storms were predicted with a high of 23degrees, one step outside and the searing heat makes you want to lie down and wait for the vultures.
As a matter of interest, a 3 br Townhouse with DLUG and int. lnd in Croydon Park will set you back approx. $515k + $35k in expenses. At the current interest rate fixed for 2 years 6.9% that equates to $3160 a month in repayments. Oh happy, joy.

"event","This being my first post, i'd like to thank <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/subtlety"" target=""_blank"">Paul</a> for assisting me in obtaining an account here. You may never read this Paul, but i never really thanked you for tyring to help me all those many moons ago with Eiffel. I think if i had tried to emulate you instead of Michael Jordan whilst at uni, things may have worked out differently. In any case, thank you for helping me (or trying to) almost 10 years ago, and thank you again today."

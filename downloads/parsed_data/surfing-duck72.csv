"event","I'm here because of a friend of mine.. I missed her, and today I met here again, as sometimes happens once every three or four months.. She told me about this journal, and I was just curious to see what it was..and now I'm here, writing about nothing, during a winter (almost spring...hopefully...) evening..
I miss many things these days, I miss many people...
I'm afraid some of these people do not miss me, and I'll have to cope with this, during the next days, and I will.
But one thing I'm sure is that I have so many good and happy people around me, many friends, many who care about me, and everything will be all right, I'm sure.

Then I just shut my mouth for now. Hope to be back soon to write, and that someone will be back soon to read...and circle never ends...

Beso,
Fiore."

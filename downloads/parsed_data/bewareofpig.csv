"event","i had a lot of fun today, cause i had no classes but choir, and we sounded a little better than yesterday. i got to see some old teachers at cedar crest, most look older. my sister told me she was waving like crazy at me but i didn't see, after the assembly she said like 7 kids went up to her and said i saw your sister singing, the thing is i don't know any other 8th graders, so i was like um... okay, i guess i'm popular among the children. that and mr. moynihan keeps calling my sister(michelle) melissa, and mr. shaufler talked to her about me and being the only person in his science class that passed in 8th grade or something. good thing she doesn't have mrs. peterson, i would feel sorry for her. *shudders* creepy woman. anyways i looked around the gym and wow it looked so much bigger back then. sooo many memories... but i am not going to name any people in choir they are pissing me off really bad, last year we sounded great! this year we suck soooo bad and it because of the people who don't have any dedication and don't give a sh** about our choir. they are only there because they want a place to hang out and ""get an easy A"" *anger rising* you will probably agree with me chris that we need to bring back all the seniors from last year, especially kevin, josh, dane, jon, jerry, and everyone else to get these people straightened out. they would go in there and just kick their a$$ out of the school. because today the people behind me on the third row, first and second sopranos are off pitch through out the entire presentation which spread to me. i don't know why but i have been really easily ticked off lately. i feel sorry for J. cause he has been bugging me but i shouldn't have hit him so hard so many times. next time i'll take my ring off. i love to sing but i'm just tired of the other people and the teacher ruining it for me. o well enough self pity. my birthday is in 16 days! yay! i will finally be 16. the best part is we are throwing the choir party during class that day too so it will be a lot more fun than just working. so happy. then it will be christmas in 15 days after. la la la la. i have been cleaning since i got home that way we can do nothing but watch the movies we rented. i want to hurt my little brother he just told me i have a fat butt, stupid brat.

November 21 - December 20
An improvement in your relations with a love partner or close friend has you feeling especially optimistic about the future, and even more so about the present, dear Sagittarius. Your sense of self-worth is up and you are formulating vague and undecided, but very positive, ideas as to how to shape your life in the months ahead. Don't make any definite plans right now. Write down your ideas and go back to them later when the rosy glow has faded a little!
:D 
the best part is i have no homework, so i will be eating crud and watching movies over the break.

"event","yay! today was so much better than yesterday. i had tons of fun with the choir/band trip, the choir sounded a lot better than i thought it would although we did fudge up on a couple of songs but carol of the bells sounded great.(i think it is because the people who normally don't sing didn't know this song so they didn't sing) the sounded wonderful though. (great job kat!) i especially enjoyed the pirates of the caribbean song. you guys started it and i was like YAY pirates of the caribbean and my friends stared at me like wtf. but i had fun dancing with becka during the jazz songs. it was pretty funny that there was more choir and band people than children at 10th st. school. can't wait for tomorrow at cedar crest and the junior high. Chris did you sleep in again or something, since you were late to choir. bryce i'm not mad at you anymore but i wish you would phrase your sentences better cause it really pisses me off when you say stuff like ""haha you are in pain"" anyways french was what do you know... fun, not really, but people in that class talk too much and which makes me mad. grrr. o well. math was stupid. so overrall it was a good day, tomorrow i won't go to any classes but choir. yay!"

"event","today has been horrible. ok 1-3 was fine. 4th period(choir) everything kind of went splat! into the ground. ok during lunch everyone was just getting cranky, i don't know what or why then they all seem to want to take it out on me. misty wasn't talking to me much and acted like she was annoyed. jo anna was mad cause i was helping misty with choir paperwork and that i wasn't singing with her. everyone else just flat out ignored me, that is my worst fear, being alone without friends and being put down, i would rather go through any time of torture than that. chamber choir sounds horrible, i am very sad, people were actually singing for the first time and we just sounded sooo bad. mr. gabrio was saying all these things that made me feel bad, around him i feel like dirt and have no power. ok chris this is how bad i don't like mr. gabrio, i would rather be stuck for a week in a room with ronnie than have a private singing session with mr. gabrio for an hour. (don't tell him i said that) uhhhhhhhhhhhh......... fifth period with french was boring, i took a couple tests watched a movie on french money. is it you alicia who is bring a couple euros? i figured from your dad traveling i don't know i justed guessed. and bryce why are you being so mean to me? it is just as bad as mr.gabrio, ""by the way i blocked you"" and you won't talk to me and you take your anger out on me, and my stupid computer. i hate that, and i don't want to talk to you if you are going to treat me that way. i found a note that we wrote to eachother in french when watching a movie, it was hilarious but now you don't want to talk to me and when you do you are cranky and i try to be nice and let it slide off but i can't take it any more. i'm sorry. i feel like sh**."

"event","alllrighty then. it all began yesterday *flashback music and fading away picture* half way through sixth period i was given a note to leave class because today i had a consultation with an oral surgeon to see if they could do my surgery(they will remove my wisdom teeth from my gums). they could, set a date, dec 17th, the half day of school before christmas vaca. i will be so knocked out, they will work for an hour on me. afterwords for the next two days i will be taking three medications a day, 600 mg(that is a heck of a lot) of ibprofin(spelled it the way it sounds) every few hours. i can't eat solid food for the first probably 3 to 4 days. can't leave my house or do any straining activites for the first two days. i will be completely healed in a week, they said the numbness in my mouth, cheeks, tongue is normal. i have a 1% chance of having the numbness being permant. and the bruises on my cheeks i will get will also be normal. so it is a bundal of fun wrapped in happyness. enough about that. in french we lost badly to ESL it was like 10 - 0. math was boring. (drat i have homework in math, french, and world studies) the assembly was a little touching, especially when people were reading off of the tombstones. i wish people weren't so disrespectful and talking when they weren't supposed to. i am ashamed of how ronnie and that other girl sang the national anthem. she started out singing like a country person leading into a pop singer while ronnie was so nervous that he was really quiet. then when they sang god bless america it wasn't too bad. a little off here and there, but overrall ok except for the end when mary anna went flat and hit the wrong note. probably cause she was really nervous too but everyone heard that. choir was fun without my choir teacher here. im going to the choir party on friday, are you going chris? you should cause kevin w. is coming around 8 with misty when they get off work. beca is giving me a ride when she gets off work at 7. i so want to see ronnie wrestle shane and hope shane kicks his butt. that would be awesome. um.... i think that is it. anything remotely exciting anyway. no wait i had to run the 1.6 today, she just sprung it on us so now i am aching all over and am going to take a nap. au revoir"

"event","Your score as a human being is 100.35.

    You are a pleasure to be with and a pleasure to be. Your friends do not envy so much as admire you, and you lead your life with grace, honor, and dignity. This site is humbled to have you take a test on it.

    Which brings one to wonder, what are you doing goofing off on the Internet? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Wackiness: 56/100
Rationality: 84/100
Constructiveness: 86/100
Leadership: 80/100



        You are a WRCL--Wacky Rational Constructive Leader. This makes you a Golden God.

        You think fast and have a smart mouth, and you are a hoot to your friends and razorwire to your enemies. You hold a grudge like a brass ring. You crackle.

        Although you have a leader's personality, you often choose not to lead, as leaders stray too far from their audience. You probably weren't very popular in high school--the joke's on them!

        You may be a rock star.

        Of the 46911 people who have taken this quiz since tracking began (8/17/2004), 7 % are this type.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 eXpressive: 4/10
Practical: 7/10
Physical: 6/10
Giver: 4/10

    You are a RPYT--Reserved Practical Physical Taker. This makes you a Stoic.

    You are intelligent, rugged, disciplined and profound. Even if you're saddled with a desk job, you are starving for the outdoors. You are very slow to warm up to people, and people are slow to warm up to you, but once they know you they never forget you.

    You do not get much attention from your target sex, and this means you can feel unloved or unwanted. This is not the case! You are just a hard nut to crack, and your social anxiety leaves you overlooked or outside the frame altogether. What is good for you is increments of low-interaction group activity, like sports or outdoor work. The person who can chop wood with you will melt your heart.

    In a long term relationship, you are loving and devoted. You are calm in a conflict until your partner presses your buttons -- it's never the problem at hand that gets under your skin, but how your partner handles it. Don't take offense! Sometimes it's just the only way your partner knows how to express things.

    You would never cheat, and your approach to sex is conventional and almost prudish. But sex for you is a release and a necessity of life, and you have a sense of entitlement about it that can be trouble. Make sure your partner is comfortable and satisfied -- by communicating both in and out of the bedroom -- and you will be more satisfied yourself.

    You may take a lot of what your partner does for granted. Make a special effort to reward and validate him/her, and you will be repaid in spades.

    You have nice legs.

    Of the 140785 people who have taken this quiz, 4.1 % are this type."

I would just like to point this out to Alicia, who betrayed us by going over to the Arlington side. :) don't worry Alicia I forgive you. Ok i was about 5 rows beneath the band with Kelsey and her friends. They were really fun. I saw Kat, Mike, Emily, K.K., Chris, and Kevin. Fun game though, I was screaming the whole time. Kelsey and I got hit with that ball going around in the stands. I want to congratulate the band people, you did an awesome job and sounded wonderful. Oh yes I would also like to say good job to the cheerleaders especially Ally, Holly, and Nicole who pepped up the crowd very well as with the band. :) I'm soo happy that we beat Arlington cause that is where I go to church so now I go around there with a grin on my face cause the people I know there are really spirited for their team. hehehe. we womped their sorry but all the way back to Arlington. *does a little victory dance* But during the game I feel so violated cause it was so packed I had at least 3 guys a$$es rubbed against my leg, people's hand touching my but when walking by, and my boobs which were squished against people when walking through the stands(not the best feeling in the world). Especially since I saw my stalker from last year(I think only Mike would know who I am talking about)and he happened to be on my row which I had to pass him at least three times and he recoginzed me but I didn't look at him in the face otherwise he would say hi thank goodness he graduated last year.*shivers* anyways who is all going to the dance tonight? if you aren't we should hang out or something that would be fun cause i'm not going to the dance or Kelsey's bowling in our homecoming dresses idea. :)"

"event","yay i just went ice skating yesterday for a couple of hours. I am so proud of myself cause i didn't fall once. very, very close but i didn't *victory dance*. i am so sleepy, my mum had  me pulling weeds for a couple of hours. I AM SO MAD AT MY CHOIR TEACHER!!! so much that i am considering transfering out of choir and switching my schedule so i will have chemistry and world studies with everyone else. ok at the end of the year we always go to a big trip. we were going to go to cali again. maybe with the band. but noooo mr. gabrio wants to do trips every other year. starting next year. GRRRRRR!!!!!! i am mad because the choir is supposed to work hard and have it pay off by the end of the year trip. somewhere fun and you can compete. but mr. *beep* beeply* *beep* *beep* is being a *beep* anger rising i g2g and finish world studies. and take a chill pill before i explode."

"event","i feel so worn thin these days.  i am enjoying school but i cant seem to focus on anything.  i will be glad for our fourth of july break.  i need to manage my time better but there just isn't enough hours in the day for all i have and want to do.  i wish i could go see mickey more but my body just cant handle physical activities like it did before school started.  i am mentally, emotionally, and physically exhausted.  i go to school four hours, come home, do homework for eight hours while taking care of a four year old; makes me want to do speed. i love two people and it is really taking a toll on me.  my heart and brain are confused about what to do even though it kinda seems i have made a decision, i still dont know.  ej has been up my ass since we started talking again and dont get me wrong, i love the attention, but then there is 7 days afterwards that he is not around and it makes me want to do bad things. i really want to be faithful to him, it's just so damned hard to.  i have lost what little income i was getting and my child care, so i dont know what i am going to do.  cant go to school if i cant afford to pay someone to watch my kid for me.  good news is i have a job interview on the fifth but i dont know how i will get back and forth from a job if i do get it.  i just keep telling myself everything will work out in the end, but i still have my doubts. i am sick of people being ill and negative, and sick of myself being ill cuz i just feel so worn. anywho, not much else going on.  i will try and write again sometime (or another).

"event","tis tis...shame on me for not posting in so long...been busy with school...getting good grades YAY! got an 90 on my first psychology test and an 85 on my first sociology test...so i am happy...been babysitting here and there...then there is this whole thing with ej...we dated about a year ago and it did not end well...then we just started talking to each other as friends and no past relationship...we have talked about our relationship in the past, but i told him that we cannot change it so why dewll in it?...i dont know exactly what we are; however we have seen each other at least once a week...which with the way he works and with me going to school and taking care of gabe and homework and all that is better than nothing...and of course now i have found out that someone i really cared for and thought nothing was going to happen between us, tells me he wants to start something now...and i really cared for this guy and tried to just move on but, now i dont know what to do...i guess i just have to talk to both...face to face for that matter and see what happens...i'm honestly not looking for anything serious right now...maybe figure what i am going to do, cuz it might envolve moving, before the next semester starts...oh well that is about all that has been going on...i will try and post more often but no promises

"event","i am so confused right now...a guy from my past has reappeared and part of me wants to be back with him but the other part is worried about what might happen if i do...i really loved this guy and he said he loved me but it ended up that he wasnt ""in love"" with me (which hurts cuz of my ex-husband, he told me after we seperated that he never loved me he only used me)...so i fear that i can never be loved...this guy that has reappeared did treat me well, the only thing that bothered me is that he was a little too controlling...which i cant blame him cuz i not a very trustworthy person...now he wants me back and wants to take care of me and my son and have a life together...and that is all well and good but, i have things going on here that i dont want to muck up because what if things dont work between us, then what would i do?...he does have some good agruements to my apprehension to being with him though...for one, i know he is good to my son, he is willing to help me get a job and a car and still be able to go to school (even though i would be moving up towards charlotte and would have to transfer schools)...plus, he says even if things dont work out (again) i will be more ready to be on my own more so than if i stay here...i dont know...we broke up cuz of a huge fight we had in which we both ended up filing police reports but we have moved on from that and apologized and tried to remain friends after the fact...it had been months since i heard from him so i was really blindsided by him coming over and taking me out on a date...but i know too that my heart belongs to someone else (in which nothing probably will come from that)...so, i am going to think long and hard about it...we can talk and date and all but i am not making any decision to do anything until after this semester at school cuz i will loose my pell grant if i drop out and will not be able to get another one...so time i guess will have to tell

"event","yes, it is even hard for me to believe (being sober)...hmmm, where to begin...this past weekend i was blessed to be able to go to a camp out in cherokee for indians in sobriety...it was amazed at the number of ppl there...i had alot of fun, despite the fact that i thought it was going to be boring and meeting after meeting (AA/NA meetings)...but it just reminded me of how you need support from friends, peers and family in order to stay sober...it has been a few weeks since i last had a drink...most ppl would say that i am not sober but, i digress...anyone who has been where i have knows, and those that know me, knows that even a few weeks of sobriety is a long time...i really am beginning to notice what triggers my cravings and relapes...it helps me alot to keep occupied...picked up a new craft while in cherokee...indian braids also known as finger weaving in which no loom is used...my father asked me to start making some things for extra income and to get back to my native roots...i have even thought about going with him tuesday to an AA meeting...might help...well i am sure it would...since i know that i dont have to talk, i can just listen and get support and be of support to my father and his sobriety...i love my family so much...i never really thought about how much until now...well, well, well...i miss my mickey...wish he would talk to me, but i dont know if he just needs more time or what...but i miss talking to him and hanging out with him...i am going to bike over to his house one day and hang out and play some games hopefully...school starts here soon (yay!!)...but not much else happening here on the rez...been looking into a visit to the school in new mexico, i plan on going after i finish tech...but i want to go visit some ppl i met this weekend and see what it is like there before i go...oh well, i guess that is about all for now

"event","i try not to be a bitch too often, but today is my day...i am so pissed about being ignored by ppl (some more than others and you know who you are)...like i create a problem, this i know, but instead of it being faced and talked over, it is painfully ignored...what are ppl just coward's in general?...i mean come on...if you have a problem with me, tell me, dont ignore it, dont run away from it, and for one dont push me away, that pisses me off worse than anything...cuz if i am not the problem, ignoring me only makes me think it is...i am beginning to understand why my grandfather told me for so many years ""all you have is family""...i havent been close with mine, even though i live at home with my parents, we havent had a healthy relationship, up until now...my mom is my best friend these days...my only friend i feel...i havent had anyone to talk to in days...when i do try to, i get ignored or pushed aside as if i am unimportant...maybe i am...i just dont want to believe it...i feel like screaming...i miss the fights my sister and i would have over nothing...strange, when you are growing up you cant wait for the day you dont have to live with siblings and parents, but now i crave it...i am so ready for school to start so i can maybe find some friends...hopefully, i have a hard time making friends...that is  why i have tried to hang on to the ones i have had for years...but we have all moved on i guess...maybe it is time i did...it just makes me sad...especially since i mucked up a friendship, even though he said he it wouldnt change things, it obviously and painfully has...i just dont get why ppl have to lie...i am trying to be a more honest person, i have lied for way too long...to myself and the ppl i care most about (my parents mainly)...hell i dont know anymore...not like it is important, nobody reads or posts on my journal...i quit writing for a while due to this fact, but i then realized, ""hey i do this for me not anybody else, why should i let this stop me"" so i go on...and on...and on...fuck it, who cares(?)

lol i painted my room this weekend...it is really pink...not a color i usually like but it is a bright happy cool and maybe it will bring out my femine side some more...beside feng shui suggested that since i am a single woman i should paint it pink or red to bring about romance...i dont know...that and i had no frame for my bed so i rednecked it and put it up on blocks...per the suggestion of my redneck mom...she is a georgia peach, all that know her know what i mean....well that is about it...not much else going on, other exercise and resting my ""puppy fracture"" (that's a whole nother story)"

nobody has updated in a few days so i decided i would try and write something...not much has been going on to really comment on...got to try out some new yu-gi-oh cards i got the other night...i still have to work on my deck, got my ass kicked but it was still fun...i learned a good bit...i know better than try and play mickey again until i get my deck straight...i was going to give up on trying to play, figured i would never get the hang of the game, and without money i cant get my deck built up but, i figure it is a good challenge for me and well, it is so much fun...i am best a keeping score for other ppl though 
i guess i was so drained from the night before last that i couldnt help but sleep most of today....my dad brought my son home from school and he said ""you arent up yet?"" ....i didnt know it was so late, i am not talented enough to tell time in my sleep....now i have the shivers from lack of sleep....not to mention i am freezing...i hope it is lack of sleep causing this and i am not coming down with something....i do walk at night in the cold, i might be getting sick...i hope not though...i will be glad when it gets warm
well not much else to write about right now...maybe i can get my brain a little more awake and think of something interesting...til then, just endure

"event","i didnt realize how helpful this live journal can be. i havent been sleeping well lately, but after writing on here i felt a little more relaxed and slept so good last night. 
not much going on today. my son just got home from school. he was telling me about his trip to the park today. god i love kids. their emagination, free spirit, the unconditional love. i wish his dad was around to see what a wonderful person gabriel is. 
i had a dream about Hoss last night. it was strange but i miss him so much. but i cant allow myself to go to the person i was when i was with him. i didnt like her very much. i hope he is happy. even though the bitch he is with now has broken 2 of our close friends hearts and i feel he needs to be careful. at least i know he is good to her daughter. he was so great with gabriel. but i worry about his soul. i cant really remember what the dream was about. it must have been peaceful cuz i woke up feeling at ease. can we reach other ppl and communicate in our dreams?
oh well...not much more to say right now...catch ya on the flip side.

"event","torn disbelieving separation
i close my eyes to see you
this is for you, everything i am
this is for you, take it from me
torn disbelieving separation
i close my eyes
but there is no escaping this
in your arms in your soul
i will be rejuvenation
breathe me in
i am forever
deep within i am eternal
i will return to you
i am with you always
i will never turn away from you
 
as of late this has been my favorite song....yes it is the killswitch engage one that i have been talking alot about...it pretty much sums up the way i feel about a guy very close to my heart...gosh what one wouldnt do for love?"

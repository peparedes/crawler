"event","so its been awhile , deciding to do another random update. i think i've meet the man of my dreams...really. but i dont know if its too soon to tell. but he is everything i've ever wanted in someone. just like in my dreams. its really crazy. i cant seem to get enough of this man. he makes me feel so good. 
my whole life i've always been the one to say they dont belive in love. im still a bit skeptical because im afriad its all going to be taken away so fast. and i think thats the one thing why im scared to even try to fall in love. like you'll never find that puzzle piece to finnish your puzzle. but i love him okay this is becoming WAY TOO GUSHY blah

yeah he's a nice fit...nuff said

"event","my life right now is almost equal to when i was with derek. if any of you remember the little website i had made before i joined LJ. you should remember reading about how much i hated it. the only answer i can seem to give me self or best come up with is ""get over it"" move on and let go. losing my apt wasnt the worst thing to happen. it actually lifted up alot of stress i had built up those few months. leading me to belive i'd do better..just like everyone else..living on my own. The world is just too damn expensive to live in, with minimum wage. it almost takes a college degree to work at MCDonalds. when will what your working for surfice for what your living and fighting for? with out having to give up becuase we cant keep up with the constant headache that socity brings upon us daily? ""thats life"" i would once say with a smile. what bullshit i had blinded millions who have walked upon my grace. there seems to be no winning. Being nice isnt working for me anymore. i seem to get more when im mean. Fear seems to be the answer over it all. i dont know if im ready to head down that road again.
 In other spirts i have met someone who brings me sunshine almost daily. he is very sweet. even tho our time together is kinda short i guess that means i wont get sick of him too soon. i doubt i will. he is perfect for me. or so i say now..check back in a few weeks? lol. 
It feels good to write again. alot has happend some of you know some of you dont. if you dont its not that interesting. im back to picking up the pieaces to my upside down world..once again..im asuming i shall have many of these adventures....when all is over it wasnt that great..i will make it to nyc one day.

I found out we have ALOT in common! he was hot and went to take a cold shower i left a message saying ""dont get too curious while your in there"" and we got to chatting bout things when he came back . i discussed about why how i was shy and he said he was to. and i go what do you have to be shy about (he asked me first) and he goes "" my deformaity"" so at first i was thinking what does he have a pussy too? rofll but no thats not the case.</P>
<P>His left side of his face is paralized he asked if i had noticed i told him no (because i hadint) he said his left eye kinda twitches (never seen it do it) and that he doesnt smile on his left side ( i thought it was just a cute smirk?) and i said i never noticed and he was still cute to me =D because he is! but yeah</P>

that<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: vent, scream, break something<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: whatever<BR>millyc70: i cant<BR>millyc70: i have that problem<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: ?<BR>millyc70: im a ticking time bomb<BR>millyc70: i show no emotion on some things<BR>millyc70: im a....extremly mellow person o.O<BR>millyc70: blah<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: eh<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: I know you're complicated<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: and you say you are hurting but you just don't show it...<BR>millyc70: i numb my self<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: that tells me you're forcing it all inside<BR>millyc70: im hurting but not all the time<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: that'll kill you slowly<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: you need to get it out<BR>millyc70: yeah i have to keep all inside<BR>millyc70: i have no place to<BR>millyc70: lol<BR>millyc70: i live in apt complex..i cant scream..besides screaming wont make me feel better i need a punching bag<BR>millyc70: but im too poor to join the gym..and my lil brother isnt here right now =(<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: you can punch pillows<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: heh<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: well there's gotta be something you can do<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: keep thinking<BR>millyc70: well<BR>millyc70: i feel better when i think that they are hurting<BR>millyc70: lol<BR>millyc70: its normal<BR>millyc70: when tim told me he cheated on me<BR>millyc70: i was calm and mellow acted as tho i didnt care . had a whatever attittude.<BR>millyc70: why do i wanna give him the satisfaction of seeing me hurt?<BR>millyc70: so i numb myself<BR>millyc70: untill i see them hurt<BR>millyc70: i think it comes down when i see them responding<BR>millyc70: i paly off of ppl<BR>millyc70: play*<BR>millyc70: i have to<BR>millyc70: im a profiler<BR>millyc70: i study actions <BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: ; /<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: no<BR>millyc70: see<BR>millyc70: look<BR>millyc70: Tim is bi-polar and he has anger problems<BR>millyc70: he gets up set and agrivated easly<BR>millyc70: if he would hae told me that shit and i would have flipped out<BR>millyc70: then that would have solved nothing<BR>millyc70: but because i didnt flip out<BR>millyc70: he came back and started appolgizing for what he had done<BR>millyc70: and expressed to me how pissed off at himself he was<BR>millyc70: see?<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: ummm<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: I suppose<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: but that's different<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: if you know someone has issues then responding to them correctly is of course the better thing to do...<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: but YOU as an individual, need to do what you have to to take care of yourself...<BR>millyc70: if i woulod have flipped out he prolly wouldnt have come back to appoligize..and the appoligy was what i was looking for..to let me know he had some kind of heart even tho he did something so heartless<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: and you seem to be denying it yourself as well<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: I understand that<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: but the fact is you're still bottling it up<BR>millyc70: yeah i know<BR>millyc70: it isnt healthy<BR>millyc70: im still looking for that outlet<BR>millyc70: alot of it goes into my artwork i think<BR>millyc70: maybe thats why i creat such disturbing pieces<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: well that's good<BR>millyc70: i spose<BR>millyc70: but it isnt an entire release<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: I know<BR>millyc70: its like a small dosage of medication<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: maybe over time you'll release it all somehow<BR>millyc70: enough to take the edge off but not enough to kill it comepltely<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: whatever keeps you sane right?<BR>millyc70: who says im sane?<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: lol<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: well you're not in a mental ward<BR>millyc70: well<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: that's gotta count for something<BR>millyc70: i think<BR>millyc70: if i was told ppl<BR>millyc70: what really went on inside my head<BR>millyc70: i would be there<BR>millyc70: but i keep that stuff locked up from most ppl<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: hm<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: you know...<BR>millyc70: But it isnt just me<BR>millyc70: Everbody has those thoughts<BR>millyc70: Tell me you've never woundered what its like to kill someone?<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: I don't say this to many people, but you may actually have a mind that's more deranged than mine lol<BR>millyc70: and get away with it<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: sure<BR>millyc70: see<BR>millyc70: lol<BR>millyc70: well i like talking to you<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: well I'm interested<BR>millyc70: because you actually undertand some shit im saying<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: ha<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: I think it's all about perception<BR>millyc70: yaeh i get intrested in ppl all the time because this shit is intresting<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: mhm<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: remember when I called you?<BR>millyc70: but i wish i could explaing myself better<BR>millyc70: i feel as tho im holding back all this information i have in my head because i dont know how to explaing it to ppl so that they would understand<BR>millyc70: yeah<BR>millyc70: lol<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: oh... do I know how that feels lo<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: lol*<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: yeah<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: feels like most people just aren't willing to try and understand<BR>millyc70: i wish i had better communitcation skills like btter words ..ways to explaing things<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: tell you what...<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: you can try using analogies if it helps<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: I do all the time<BR>millyc70: whoa<BR>millyc70: didnt we have this convo before<BR>millyc70: cuz i was about to say<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: ...maybe? lol<BR>millyc70: so i could tell the world what i think<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: yeah<BR>millyc70: like recently<BR>millyc70: lol<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: some people just need to look at it from a different angle<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: perception<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: if we all were just a little perceptive...<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: we'd be so much more accepting<BR>millyc70: yeah but most ppl dont know how to be<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: exactly<BR>millyc70: They think they do <BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: I think a lot of people are just too fucking stubborn and opinionated<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: just because THEY believe in it doesn't make it right<BR>millyc70: well thats what i am..but...perceptive as well<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: no I mean...<BR>millyc70: i know what ya mean<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: they're so stubborn to the point where they put down other people who don't agree wit them<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: yeah, anyway<BR>millyc70: yeah how tim would call me stupid all the tim<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: sorry lol<BR>millyc70: time*<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: wtf?<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: he did?<BR>millyc70: yeah untill i started<BR>millyc70: um<BR>millyc70: well i did it on purpose<BR>millyc70: i acted stupid on purupse<BR>millyc70: i do it to get an upper advantage<BR>millyc70: lol<BR>millyc70: but it got to the point where it'd agravate me when he said i was stupid so ..i started showing him i wasnt<BR>millyc70: and i think that intimidated him<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: I don't get that guy at all<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: I don't exactly know him but it doesn't make sense<BR>millyc70: well you prolly would if you spent as much time as i have but even I dont understand him compeltly<BR>millyc70: because you dont have the full view<BR>millyc70: your only seeing parts only what im telling you<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: mhm<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: even those parts I can't figure out<BR>millyc70: yeah i mean i dont understand why he cheated on me<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: me neither<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: didn't he love you?<BR>millyc70: yeah he said he did...and then the night begfore vday he told me he didnt <BR>millyc70: and then on the phone he told me he was breaking up with me<BR>millyc70: he has bi-polar lol<BR>millyc70: their way of thinking isnt going to be ""normal""<BR>millyc70: even tho they think it is<BR>millyc70: they go thru stages of manic depression.<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: trust me, I've dealt with some bi-polar issues before<BR>millyc70: So you have got to think<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: hm<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: I think he just doesn't know what he wants<BR>millyc70: if i had bi-polar (which i have be diagnosed with) how would i be thinking?<BR>millyc70: he said i was immature<BR>millyc70: that i cant do anything for myself<BR>millyc70: because i dont haev my ged or my drivers lincese<BR>millyc70: but im working on that<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: okay<BR>millyc70: when tim isnt in one of his temper tantrums hes really smart<BR>millyc70: i was shcoked<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: so I think he puts you down to feel better about himself, even if he's not trying to conciously<BR>millyc70: lol he even took pshychology in college (sp?)<BR>millyc70: that may be it but he also once told me he couldnt have a g.f that was smarter or cooler than him (he said it in a joking manner) but..<BR>millyc70: one night he asked carol who he liked better and she said Emily and everyone(his friends) always told me they loved me and how perfect we were for eachother<BR>millyc70: he was okay with me before his friends started to get to know me<BR>millyc70: and before he started fidning out i was...smart<BR>millyc70: u there?<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: mhm<BR>millyc70: k<BR>millyc70: you didnt say anyting to that<BR>millyc70: so i was worried<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: i was still reading<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: lol<BR>millyc70: oh geesh<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: hush, other IMs too ya know? d:<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: anyway<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: that right there sounds pretty common<BR>millyc70: its a dominating thing i think<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: just the male psyche at work again I think lol<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: yes<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: exactly<BR>millyc70: yeah he is kinda controlling i noticed<BR>millyc70: he is like one of them ""its okay for me to do it but not you"" sorta ppl<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: a lot of men are intimidated by women who they see as more intelligent or capable than themselves<BR>millyc70: and im like..you cant be like that?<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: yeah, not good<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: okay well...<BR>millyc70: shit i just had something good and forgot it<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: ; x<BR>millyc70: another example =(<BR>millyc70: oh<BR>millyc70: yeah<BR>millyc70: see<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: did you just forget it altogether or you don't know how... nvm lol<BR>millyc70: when we first hooked up and started arguing i wasnt afraid to say what i felt because i didnt know how he really was his moods or how he'd react<BR>millyc70: and one night<BR>millyc70: okay he thinks me talking in my normal voice..and cussing like saying ""you fucking disrespected me infornt of my family"" is yelling at him..he said it sets something off in his brian and makes him mad..but he said he can do it because it doesnt affect him when he says it.<BR>millyc70: so when i argued with him or ""talked"" with him i couldnt swear..or else he'd just shut down and throw me out of his car<BR>millyc70: which happend alot<BR>millyc70: well like 2 times<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: I get like that myself too sometimes<BR>millyc70: thats somethign i couldnt understand<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: anger issues<BR>millyc70: yeah he has that<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: it's a trigger<BR>millyc70: he takes med for its<BR>millyc70: and it was like<BR>millyc70: we'd try and talk but hed be like fuck it and leave<BR>millyc70: because him and his ex argued alot and i figured it was a defsenive manner to where he'd just block her out so he didnt have to deal wit it.<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: mhm<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: because...<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: if he sticks around, you'll only end up pulling on that trigger even harder...<BR>millyc70: see the weird thing is<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: to the point where he'll explode eventually<BR>millyc70: he is the same way i was with derek<BR>millyc70: i did them same things<BR>millyc70: just say fuck it and leave i didnt wanna sit ther and listen to him bitch at me<BR>millyc70: and it didnt help for tim and i to be around each other as much as we were<BR>millyc70: we worked 2gether, lived 2getrher, ate lunch 2gether hang out 2gether smoke 2gether<BR>millyc70: there wasnt any...alone time<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: yeah I thought that would take its toll somehow<BR>millyc70: and i think that set off what happend this weekend<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: how long were you together?<BR>millyc70: like 2months<BR>millyc70: lol<BR>millyc70: we almost broke up once beforfe but we talked it out<BR>millyc70: but then again..we may have talked it out but we didnt do anything to really fix the problem<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: seems to me like you two ultimately had difficulty adapting to each other<BR>millyc70: yeah<BR>millyc70: i tryed<BR>millyc70: well we got along GREAT<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: maybe it was too soon for you to be living together<BR>millyc70: untill we started spending all this time 2gether it was like we couldnt get enough of eachotehrs company<BR>millyc70: yeah well i was trying to help him out<BR>millyc70: his grandma kicked him out and he had to try and find a place for him to live<BR>millyc70: oh and it doesnt help that i only have a twin bed lol<BR>millyc70: so we were like close all the time<BR>millyc70: but i feel as thoough<BR>millyc70: if we didnt spend as much tiem 2gether itd be perfect<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: yeah you really have to ease into that<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: it's rare that it works out right away<BR>millyc70: yup<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: hmmm<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: well, Emi...<BR>millyc70: yeah its night night time<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: you probably already know this but I wouldn't take anything he said to you very seriously<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: no d:<BR>millyc70: oh<BR>millyc70: opkay<BR>millyc70: okay*<BR>millyc70: yeah ithougth about that too<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: sounds like he's struggling to figure out himself<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: and may act out at any whim<BR>millyc70: because we we first got 2gether he had said something that when he gets pissed off he says shit to the other person..mean things to make them hurt..and thats just what i do<BR>millyc70: and thats why i wasnt sure if he really did cheat on me of not<BR>millyc70: but the more i put things 2gether that happend this weekend the more i realized it did happen<BR>millyc70: you should prolly slap me silly for saying this but i miss him so much right now<BR>millyc70: i wish he was here<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: I'm not gonna slap you<BR>millyc70: even if we wernt getting along just knowing he was here with me would make me feel so much better<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: you're human, it's natural<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: of course you miss his companionship<BR>millyc70: sooooo um<BR>millyc70: should i try and show more emotion twords things like this?<BR>millyc70: Bob says ppl need it<BR>millyc70: it shows you care and love<BR>millyc70: and relationships need that<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: absolutely<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: the way I see it...<BR>millyc70: but see..im afraid to because i know it'll hurt worse..and um..its already hurting pretty bad right now so..i odnt know if i could handle that sort of feeling<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: if you're going to have a relationship with someone, you'll want it to be a healthy one, and if you want it to be healthy you can't keep things under the covers<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: you have to let it all out<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: and accept it<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: what do you mean exactly?<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: what's hurting?<BR>millyc70: this pain<BR>millyc70: i mean if i would have shown more emtion twords all the problems we had<BR>millyc70: i think it would have just made things hurt worse<BR>millyc70: and i dotn want them hurting worse<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: he would either have been scared and ran...<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: or touched and embraced it<BR>millyc70: well i havent heard from him all day today<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: I think...<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: you need to express your feelings more with him, I mean the bare, honest truth, but in a subtle way<BR>millyc70: but he did tell me he wasnt going to stop comming around<BR>millyc70: see h.o<BR>millyc70: i was afraid to be affectionet and he even said that<BR>millyc70: and im thinking in my head after he left and said all that well<BR>millyc70: we are 2gether so much i figured the last thing you'd want would be me kissing all over you or wahtever yanno<BR>millyc70: i figuredhe'd get agitated<BR>millyc70: because sometimes if i asked for a kiss he'd be like ""nah im consintrating right now"" or somestupid shit lol<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: lol<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: hm<BR>millyc70: so it was hard for me to figure out when it was okay to be affectionate and how much to be and or how to be<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: it just takes time to adapt<BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: you'd have figured it out eventually<BR>millyc70: yeah<BR>millyc70: i just wish he didnt fuck carol<BR>millyc70: see <BR>millyc70: yesterday <BR>BiGFaT SmileyMan: a little lack of self-control there<BR>millyc70: he came over and started appoligzing we went down to his car and smoked a bowl<BR>millyc70: and i didnt really say anything to him<BR>millyc70: and he was sitting there and he goes<BR>millyc70: im suprised your even takling to me..that your even down here<BR>millyc70: that you even wanna still be friends and hang out<BR>millyc70: and i think he said something about having to prove something to me (i missed what he said) but i knew if i would have asked him to repeate it he prolly wouldnt of<BR>millyc70: and after we got done smoking the bowl we got out to air out and smoke a cigarette and i still wasnt saying much<BR>millyc70: he sat on the hood of his car and i sat on the hood of mine next to his.<BR>millyc70: jsut smokign our cigarettes not saying anthing<BR>millyc70: and i go ""are you wating for ben?"" and he shook his head no (and ther eason i asked him that was because he used the phone and i heard him ask i fthey could drop something off by where i lived)<BR>millyc70: i dunno<BR>millyc70: i started hearing him like sniffle his nose<BR>millyc70:&nbsp;

"event","<P>So for new years i went up to Tenn with Verloren, it was a fun trip. much needed i do believe. It was nice to be on the road again traveling &lt;3<BR>Took a TON of pictures im sure you'll be seeing them around. On my trip i took a Note book with me to write about my trip. It will be posted as <BR>the Newest Adventure on my website when i finnish it. </P>
<P><A href=""http://www.verloren.net"">www.verloren.net</A><BR>------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>Got a short chance to talk to Bob today. I cannot belive i missed his chat last nite...&gt;&gt;moron&lt;&lt; <BR>he said ppl were asking about me =X how cute &lt;3 -- Speaking of Bob, it'd be nice to talk to him on the phone sometime soon.<BR>I miss it =( i miss talking to Bob. But this is how things go between us..talk alot..talk a little im sure we'll catch up sooner or later.</P>
<P><A href=""http://www.normalbobsmith.com"">www.normalbobsmith.com</A><BR>------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P>Today was weird. i had a Remorse attack.&nbsp; Strange? yes. it was very emotional and happend in the middle of work =(<BR>I thought about derek alot...i think manily because my birthday is Coming up &gt;&gt;January 13th&lt;&lt; and im wounderin if i'll be <BR>getting a call from him. from the last time i talked to him before x-mas till now the only thing i've heard from him was this Letter<BR>he sent me . it had my key's in them i left up north and a new photo of Ira and a picture he &gt;&gt;ira&lt;&lt;drew for me that says ""i lovey you emi""<BR>ugh..makes it so hard. Im affraid of letting go..completly. all day today ...the only thing i could think about was writing a letter to derek explaing all the<BR>reasons why im sorry for everything i did. and i understand now..i understand the feeling of pain...of a broken heart.</P>
<P>This is completly weird for me. I Think back at all the angry nights , all the yelling and pushing me ending up walking out and trying to escape from that hell. and it seems to fill <BR>the calendar up more then the days that lay calm, being relaxed and enjoying eachother. It shouldnt be this hard trying to get over someone - over a situation i've worked so hard getting my self out of. and i cannot allow myself to be tempted into falling back down again.i just wanna let go so goddamn bad; but at the same time hold on to every last moments morsel. its driving me insane.</P>
<P>Im having trouble believing my intuition..its like..when i look at tim i see derek and i'll admit the fact that&nbsp;yes i still love derek-there is no way in hell i could ever go back to him. And it sucks because i like tim alot he's so fucking funny. I still havent completly figured him out yet.-he's....diffrent*mentaly* from other ppl or i should say than ppl i've dated..&gt;&gt;no not like retarted -altho sometimes i think he is&lt;&lt; but the way he thinks i can tell is diffrent. which makes it more difficult to get inside his head.<BR>-----------------------------------------------</P>
<P>There was more i wanted to post..alot more..but i've ran out of time its 12am and i have to give my grandma a call and wish her happy bday =)</P>
<P>and for the Kids...a new project is in bloom!!</P>

<P>Im so happy frances finnaly has some furniture in her apt. she got her Big Screen Saturday. Tim and i went over there yesterday night and chilled for a bit then went to taco bell and grabbed some free food. Dustin also gave me a GED book ..and that makes me REALLY happy because now i dont have to go to dbcc to take classes for it i can do it on my own. the problem is finding time to sit down and actually start doing it..i also have to ither find my drug awareness course certifcate that i lost on thanksgiving or order another one if its possible.</P>
<P>Looks like the odds of me finding my cell phone are pretty slim..that is so shitty...oh well i'll just have to get another cheap one..you can now buy cell phones at gas stations lol</P>
<P>and im tottaly in love with the fact you can now order 1 hour photos through walmart over the Net! how great is that? lol i would like to blow up some of my pictures and make them into posters. like the one i posted tonight. Im getting ready to print off some guitar tabs from ogla.net . i've been using that tab site for a while..its the best one there is.</P>

this is what i wanted to post..

im posting in this entry because the other one is completly full.
i see hundereds of hatefull comments. people making ignorant accusations.its almost criminal.
maybe if you could take a walk in her shoes to understand why she did it, alot of you wouldnt
be posting such immature things. you cant make legitimate accusations from her lj sayin shit like.
""oh her mother made her go to fat camp..here's an ideal i'll kill her"" im sure there is a deeper side of all this and things
she's written in here. She isnt competly stupid..she knows this journal is PUBLIC. there are just some things you can't write about
in your ""live journal"". Just take a moment to realize that there are more things that went on in her life than what she types out to
an online journal. just..take a moment and think about it."

"event","so today was INTERESTING!!! to say the least.
So i got to sleep in today till 8am which was nice..i went to bed around 10pm so..10hrs of sleep was just right. 
It was an okay day at work..the normal but at my break someone called for me a guy named Tim. He is this guy i met in Drive Thur. and we kinda chit chatted he mentioned something about working at a screen printing factory . i said i needed a new job..and low and behold..i got one at the screen printing place!! yay!! so many thoughts and soo much to type out. hmm so i needed to find a way to get my ass to port orange before 4:30 *because thats where the factory moved too.*so..this lady karen said she'd give me a ride.
We got off work around 3:50pm we got into her car..she said ""if you could wait just one minute i have to get this out"" and she started busting out crying i asked her what was wrong ? and she said she ""just wanted to die"" i was like OMG i talked to her while we riding to port orange and asked her why she felt this way and so on and so forth anyways yeah i was kinda scared she was going to try and commit suicide with me in the car. 
I finnaly find where this place is at and go in and talk to the boss. Tim got me the job even before i got there so i just had to fill out an app and the head dude showed me what i was going to be working with *big sewing machines* lol I got the hrs 8am - 4:30pm , i think we get weekends off..i get paid every other week *bitches* but i will be making 50 cents more than at burger king and i can wear my piercings AND Where what ever i want.yay i heard the job is pretty easy too. so yanno great job i hope! im thinking of taking a leave of absense at burger king untill i get a car then go back there to part time so i get some extra cash flow. Im going to talk to my boss about it tomorrow. i Start Dec. 6th ugh im so happy i got this job its going to rock. so after all that The guy Tim told me he'd take me home if i got there .so he asked if i wanted to chill and i said yeah..so we smoked a bowl then we had to drop off this one guy and then go pick up his....... KID blah wtf, im not going to be able to deal with this shit.why does EVERY guy have a fucking kid?? anyways we went to his grandparetns house because thats where he's staying , him and his kid..blah ..another turn off..and his sister starts like saying shit and i could already tell Tim needs to deff. work on his fathering skills. but his sister was like just i dont know, lets just say i felt VERY uncomfortable.So anyways i dont know this guy showed all the signs that i need to watch out for and just he's cool and fun the kinda guy i could hang with but as far as dating..i dont think so...but when he dropped me off he said i'd try and kiss you but i think i have bad breath and he was like do you do that? kiss boys ? i go ""i prefer girls"" he was like Really?     NO! lol anyways i guess we are going to hang out tomorrow after he gets out of work and after i do too.
 he keeps kinda hittin on me and im diggin him like that at all, but most guys think if you hang out you like them and thats where guys get the wrong impression from girls, i just like to hang out with guys!! grrr so retarted!! so i hope this new job works out alright..im so HAPPY ! happy happy joy joy! *does dance* 

and WHAT is with everyone posting convo's they are having with me?? lol 

OH..oh oh..i get to work and scott has a new cell phone..hmm its the SAME as mine..bitch..i thought it was mine at first but his sister gave him her own phone..and i was supposed to look for my phone in Quintins car today but i left early for that other job..damn I WANT MY CELL phone!!"

YAY! i dont have to wait my mom actually let me use her card to make the payment..hmm anyways i'll be sittin on my ass for the next 4 hrs trying to figure this shit out..luckly im on the net..so haha!! im sure i wont need to cheat =/

haha An acronym used for good defensive driving is SIPDE. Scan, Identify, Predict, Decide, and Execute. SCAN the road continuously, that the driver may, IDENTIFY potential problems. You must then PREDICT what the other driver will do, DECIDE what you are going to do about it, and EXECUTE the proper maneuver.


1. Impaired judgement. Alcohol in the bloodstream goes directly to the brain. The first portion of your brain to become impaired is the frontal lobe. The frontal lobe is where you have judgement, decision making and awareness. You think that you can do many things that you are not able to do. Annually at spring breaks throughout the country you read about alcohol impaired individuals who fall or jump from their hotel windows. Alcohol is also a solvent and dissolves brain cells and supporting tissues. Extensive use of alcohol can lead to brain damage.
haha all the time in daytona

Alcohol is a toxic substance. Webster's dictionary defines toxic as a harmful, destructive, deadly or poisonous agent. Ask yourself, ""does it make sense to take poison into your body?"" If we were discussing someone purposefully taking rat poison or drain cleaner (NOTE: this suggestion is for the purposes of discussion, the authors do not indorse the ingestion of any type of poison for any reason at any time) 

hahahahahaha thats funny.

ugh its only 6:50 and i wanna go to bed lol wtf? 


yay! i passed my first practice quiz's! i only missed one =D

a good example of why driving in fla scares me :
In Florida, in 2000 there were 23,578 alcohol-related crashes, which injured 19,775 people and killed 979. 9.6% of total crashes and 32.6% of fatal crashes were alcohol related. Approximately 3 people die and 54 are injured every day due to alcohol related crashes.

lol yay i passed my 2nd practice quize 100% lol i rock!  ugh im so tired of this shit i've completed half the course and im really tired i think ima do the rest tomorrow. i have to go to bed soo..its already 8pm i have to be up at at least 4:15am blah....

i wounder why the 2 new recent superchic's have been removed from bob's site o.O brit and that other one.."

"event","So..my grandma calls tonight and she was talking about me working at the hospital...AGAIN now usually this would just annoye me (considering my whole family works at a fucking hospital somewhere) but i actually thought about how much better i could make my life if i do this. 7-8$ & full benifits just to work at the cafe or to be a transporter hell yeah no more dealing with burger king..then the down side..3 generations at the same place?? wtf My grandma is a nurse there my mom works as a cn and me..at the fucking cafe lol oh well its way better than burger king and im at a point im willing to do anything to get out. but also the fact of me working at a hospital..*gulp* im not really a big fan of the place. it smells of death and i dont like old people makes me think of death..and lol i hate death oh well just to get my ass off the ground we all have to make sacrifices and im willing to do this..so she said she'd talk to some lady about it tomorrow.

She also started hasslin me about school i told her i have to wait till my next day off seeings how i work mornings now and the lady's hrs are from 8am-1pm and im..at work from 5am-2pm or later yeah Great! so whatever i'll just walk up to DBCC. My mom is also giving me SHIT again about having to take me to work..gah seeings now i have to ""find my own way"" i have no ideal whats going through my mom's head??? she can stay up all day on this damn computer or go out till 2pm with her friends at the mall or where ever it is they go and still has a problem taking me to work??? im not asking for much..am i?? i try not to.

so i've decided not to move to nyc..i havent told Karl or Bob..i know they are going to be disapointed in me..as if that is anything new? im not ready for such a big move..there is no way i am lol. Zane said if its what makes me happy then the more power to me (or somthing along those lines) well i think its easier said then done.

And maybe Derek and my Mom are right. maybe im never happy where im at? is that any reason to stop searching? not to me..i just need ...to go back to the beach..and Remember why it is i love it here so much..despite all other things..and my bitching about how much i hate it lol. Maybe if i had a better paying job or just a better job period and my own place and actually started my life and maybe even someone i'd be more happy..i dont know.

so i get to work..Jeremy tells me im supposed to stay untill 4 now instead of 2 ..that hooker! then we got to talking about him and his girly gettin married..so he decided i could get off when he did and we'd ride over to the mall and go to zales...so around 2:45pm we get off head to the mall and we go and look at wedding bands for his g.f it was weird..i've never done that shit before i was tottaly clueless as what to look for. Oh well he decided on this one ugly one one haha i didnt tell him it was ugly but he dug it and thats all that matters..so he bought it for like $476 for a 1/4 karet platinum ring with dimonds in it..so now i have to pay him..$476 for his mac laptop because that was the deal...so i think it was a good deal..he offered the laptop to me eariler for $1,500. yay..i dunno when im going to be able to start paying him he said $100 upfront he'd give me the laptop and go from there about $50/month

on another note..im haveing 2nd thoughts on NYC....i expected myself too...but i just dont wanna get there and having to be struggling to get by..i may just get my cosmotology degree or whatever and go from there so that means an extra 9 months but i will be gettin my D.L and a car soon so yay!! i'll be going places!

"event","DEREK decides to call me today ugh....the FIRST fucking time he calls i had mentioned recently coming back from New York..and he goes ""oh new york..okay bye"" and hangs up in my face...im like whatever i go put the phone back on the charger and keep cleaning my room...2mins later..he calls back...and i asked him wtf was up with that shit and he said Ira was messing with the phone?? WTF thats a gay excuse blaming it on your kid.then we get into this heated conversation about i dont even remember these phone calls were so fucking irritating i just tried to ignore it all..but i told him to fuck off and hung up in his face...the bitch calls back and im like WHAT?!?!
The whole time we talked on the phone . we were doing nothing but arguing..and it reminded me why i wont go back..why i left in the first place..another reason to note why i HATE michigan! there was one point in the conversation that i found amusing he said ""when i talk to you i wanna gouge out my eyes"" i laughed we exchanged words heh..the stupid shit he decides to bring up...preaching to me about MY LIFE and how my life is more fucked up than his *im not the one with a kid already* basically telling me im going to fail in New York..giving me THAT MUCH MORE MOTIVE to try even fucking harder to prove everyone wrong! he kept asking me for an answer about *us* im like i already told you we are just going to be friends i dont have time for anything else..and then he goes ""well you have time to travel all over the fucking country and go to new york but you cant even make the time to come up and see me but you can make the time to hang out with your friends all the time"" that pissed me off i told him everytime he talks to me the REASON why im with my friends i probably had the day off and that i DO make time to call him. its just pissing me off!! he said he wish he could show everybody how i really am..the fact that i always do what i want..well THIS IS MY LIFE..so yeah..iam going to be doing what i want. he kept telling me i fucked with his head..maybe so i don't know i don't see it..and im sorry if i did..he says that im always changing my mind..so what..of course who doesnt? This is the way i am he says i've changed..whatever i asked him how does he know he hasnt changed? im so GRRR sick of guys just leave me the fuck alone!!!! 

im getting very irritated by the constant bitching from ex's and stupid drama . Im over it..why cant ya'll just be over it too? Yes maybe it IS EASIER for me to get over things..but do the sob thing with out bothering me..i dont need it..i have my OWN problems to deal with OK?

"event","tonight was a very bad night for me i was happy untill Frederick came up to work and was with this guy ( whom keeps using him) and i was like wtf?? he said it was work related so whatever then he gave me a hug and im like remember nyc!! (we are supposed to move to nyc 2gether) and he kinda just gave me a depressed look . i got worried and asked oh no you didnt change your mind did you?? and he said he did last night because this week has been bad. my eyes started to water and i TRYED to hold it back but i couldn't. his friend saw me and started asking me what was wrong and i just kinda brushed him off and went into the bathroom.There i sat and cried i hate bein so sensitive. The fact that he had chaged his mind and to ask him again in a week wasnt the only thing i was upset about...many things ..like why everytime i try to do something and do something to better my life and try to make myself happy..everything in the world is against me. i bet alot of ppl feel this way huh? oh well anyways i sat in the bathroom thinking about alot of things..even things that bob and i had discussed and it just all made me more depressed. but im GOING to move to nyc WITH OR WITH OUT peter, frederick or karl!! i can do this by myself and even if i dont make it by my 6 month deadline i know its okay because i can deal with bein here for a few months later. Because i know i dont HAVE to stay here in fla. and that thought..makes me feel better.

then Frederick and his fried and kenny left on kennys break and i was outside when they returned.Frederick asked what was wrong and why i was crying and i told him a bit why. and i also said i told you not to tell me you were going to go through with this with me and then tell me your not. i went back inside and went back to work

Frederick left and came back again...(geesh on your day off wtf??)
he gave me a lil teddy bear that had ""best friends""written on it and it made me feel soo much better its nice to know someone cares as much as you do. and its nice to know someone will be here for me.

haha  i love frederick =D"

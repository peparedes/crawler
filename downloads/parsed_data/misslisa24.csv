I've had to make many decisions throughout my life. I know that it's far from over, however I would like a break from these life changing ones.

I have a huge decision to make. I have an opportunity to work at Club Med Miami. I know it sounds like a dream job..and perhaps it is. However, I feel so overwhelmed. I'm terrified about going on my own, not knowing anyone...and I don't know if I can do it. Maybe it's just fear of the unknown, fear that I won't be able to succeed...that I'm not good enough...I don't know. If I don't go, I know I'll regret it. But what if I do go? Will I regret that too? God this is so hard. And I know it's only for six months..but I think the big part is, if I go, then I know that whatever little hope with mike that's left..is gone. Am I ready to accept that? I don't know. I mean it's so hard to move on..and I'm trying. He's a great friend. But I JUST moved out here. Am I ready to pack up and move on again?

GAH! I need to stop thinking about this"

"event","All my life, all I've done is what other people wanted me to do. For as long as I can remember, all I ever wanted was to make people happy, wether or not it made me happy was irrelevant. Truth of the matter is, that's still the case. And frankly, I'm sick of it. I'm so tired of giving into pressure, and only doing what others want me to do just because they know what's in my best interest.

Take this Club Med job for example..sure it sounds great. And sure it sounds like a dream job..but not for me at this time. And I hate how nobody understands that. My aunt is on my case about going out and getting that passport. And Mike, who claims to be my ""bestfriend"" all of a sudden is so adament on my going, it's like he wants me out of his life completely. He keeps insisting that's not the case, but I see through it. He's like everyone else in my life that's no longer there. The whole ""let's be friends. buddies.. let's remain tight, but oh by the way I want you to be in another country, where the only contact is a possible email here or there."" Right. So here's the thing I've decided. If I do get this job,which I find out in 3 weeks,and people are still harsh pressuring me, then fuck it. I'll go, but I won't say goodbye, and I won't talk to anyone the whole time I'm gone. If they won't listen to me now..what's to say they will once I'm gone?"

"event","Well, what can I say? Here I am living with my family, and feeling like the biggest burden, when I read something that totally melts my heart, and brings a tear to my eye.

My youngest cousin and I don't really know each other, she was about 5 when I moved to Ottawa, so her and I never really had that much of a relationship as I do with her siblings. So, when I first saw her when dad died, it was weird. And now living here it's still a little akward. It's like we're too polite with each other. Basically I felt like she didn't really want me to be here.

But, I was in for the shock of my life when I read her web page. this was what she wrote :R.I.P Uncle Mike - I love you and miss you, atleast you're with grandma now, take good care of her, i'll see you again someday, we're taking good care of lisa, i love you

I can't even begin to express how that makes me feel. To know that my little cousin is taking care of me, that she's making sure I'm ok. It's one of the most generous things I could have ever wished for."

My question is this: How is it that you love someone so much, with all your being, yet you still manage to piss them off?
Sometimes I wish that I could just shut up and deal with things in a different way. I feel so bad for the way I treat Mike sometimes. 

So Mike, if you're reading this..

I love you. I know that there are times when I have a weird way of showing it, and there is no excuse for it. I want to treat you the way you treat me. I want to treat you with love, kindness, and respect. I promise to be less like my mother and more like me. I promise to think before I speak, and take in consideration your feelings.

That being said, I look back at who I have become and why. I look at all the changes that happened that year, and how it's shaped me to be the person I am today. Not sure whether or not it's a good thing or not, but nonetheless, it's who I have become, and who I see myself as.
Believe it or not, I see myself as a stronger more independant person. I used to be so dependant on others, and I used to latch on to them so much that I shaped myself around those people. If someone were to ask who I was a year ago, I honestly couldn't tell you. Now, I know me. I'm a girl, who's been through some tough shit. But has somehow managed to keep her sanity. I'm a strong, caring person, who stands up for myself when times get tough. I've seen tough times in my life. I'm not going to get into it this entry, but let's just say that life has handed me some tough hands. 

I've always wondered why I was handed such hard stuff in my life, and I think that was to shape me into who I am now. I am who I am because I decided to be. I used to be easily influenced by other people, following along with the crowd. I didn't want to, but I thought that was the only way to get accecpted by my peers. I know now that I'm not as easily influenced, and if I decide not to do something, it's cool. I now feel accecpted my my peers, and my family. I have finally found myself"

If you think about it, all the stuff that's happened in the past 6 months, seems like it's a farce. Like it's a bad nightmare that I have yet to wake up from.

As I mentioned before, there is another test my family has to go through. My mom has had some heart problems, and on Friday she is going into the hospital to get her heart shocked. It sounds worse than it is, but it is still pretty scary. Apparently from my understanding, what they are going to do is put some voltage in her heart and tap out a rhythm of how her heart is supposed to beat. The doctors assured me that the worst thing that could happen is the procedure won't work. However, there is still that part of me that is scared shitless. The ""what-if's"" keep playing in my head... what if she dies, what if she has a heart attack, what if she goes into cardiac arrest.

How people over dramatize everything: i think that now since dad died, i get really pissed off when people take something small that's happening in their lives, and over stress it. and how much their lives suck. It makes me want to slap them.

How people think they know what I'm going through:it's so frustrating when I talk about how I feel or what I'm feeling..and people are all like ""oh I totally understand"" bullshit. you do not understand, and the only people who do, are people who have gone through the same thing I have. so if you haven't then please stop trying to comfort me by saying you know what I'm going through


How I don't have a job: it's been like 6 months. enough is enough..I'm so tired of sitting on my ass and not being able to do a damn thing about this whole situation. I've applied everywhere, and still no calls back. When will my life turn around?

My thoughts: once again, they seem to be taking over, and once again it's not a good thing. they are begative, hateful and just plain wrong. I wish I could stop them..but I can't"

Imagine there's no heaven,
It's easy if you try,
No hell below us,
Above us only sky,
Imagine all the people
living for today...

Imagine there's no countries,
It isnt hard to do,
Nothing to kill or die for,
No religion too,
Imagine all the people
living life in peace...

Imagine no possesions,
I wonder if you can,
No need for greed or hunger,
A brotherhood of man,
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world...

You may say Im a dreamer,
but Im not the only one,
I hope some day you'll join us,
And the world will live as one.

And when the broken hearted people
Living in the world agree,
There will be an answer, let it be.
For though they may be parted there is
Still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be.
Let it be, let it be

There is still a light that shines on me,
Shine on till tomorrow, let it be.

"event","My mind is taking my thoughts hostage, and replacing them with weird, incoherrant, un-Lisa-like thoughts and feelings. Luckily for me, I've experienced all that before, so I have an idea of how to deal with it. Which as it stands, is trying to talk about it, and becoming very ""bitchy"" to whomever is listening to my rant. 

The latest thought came to me yesterday, and that was the idea of having another baby. I know deep down that I'm nowhere near ready in any aspect of my life, but the thought was there. It was so overwhelming that it scared me too. There are so many unresolved issues in my life, and the one that decided to rear it's ugly head was the whole baby thing. God, that really messes me up.

So, I decided to talk about it, and it worked until the idea of my going to see a shrink came up. That is a touchy subject for me. Why would I want to go talk to a stranger about my ""issues"" when all they do is psycho-analize me. They probably don't even listen to me, they just probably sit there and jot notes on how fucked up I really am, and how they're going to spend my money, and they'll probably sit there and tell me how I need to continue my sessions when they won't really help. So yeah, like I said, touchy subject."

"event","I sit and wonder how much people take the people they love for granted. It's amazing how much anyone takes the word ""love"" for granted too. We as humans grow so acustomed to saying ""I love you"" that it's almost as natural as saying ""hey there"" or ""what's up"" Is it supposed to be like that? 

I'm not sure where I'm going with any of this, maybe just wondering or something. I guess it's just something that's been on my mind since dad died. Okay maybe I do know where I'm going with this. Before dad died, I kept wondering what life would have been like if I didn't move to Ottawa. You know, playing those little scenerios in my mind, who I would have dated, where I would have gone to College, would I still be on talking terms with Mike, let alone dating him? Then I thought about one of the main reasons why I moved to Ottawa. It was to obtain a relationship with Dad. To get closer to him and have that special bond with him that we created over the years that I was there. I am so thankful for that.

Which brings me to one of my friends. this person doesn't have a great relationship with their mother. And at first I understood, since I had heard everything that went on between them. But now, it really bothers me. One day their mother is going to die and they are totally going to regret it. They're going to regret not fixing things with their mom, and she'll be gone and they will have left things on bad terms. And as much as I want to tell this person this, I KNOW they won't listen to me.

So my plea is this. You know who you are. Please, even if you don't talk to your mother, at least forgive her in your heart. You never know when they'll be gone, and you will regret not clearing things up"

Or maybe I'm just bottling things up, I don't know. None of this seems real yet, and I'm not sure when it will. Seems like things are just crzy.

Someone commented that I set my heart on things, and that's true. I mean when dad was in the hospital, my heart was set on him getting better, infact I had a gut feeling that he was going to. But we all know how well ""that"" turned out. He's gone. So instead of getting well, he died. Then with nana, we all knew that she had cancer, but she was getting a lot better, and once again I had my heart set on knowing she was going to get better, but once again we all know how that turned out. 

Last year, I found out that a childhood friend of mine had died in a car accident. And for the longest time, I didn't believe it, I couldn't. We had just gotten back in touch and last Christmas when I came out, we were going to get together for coffee and catch up. I remember when Mary told me, she said that ""Bryson Hall"" had died. I thought no that's not right, his name is Bryce, not Bryson. So, I just brushed it off, since nobody really talked about it much. But today, I was looking at the Province online, and I thought I'd just check the obituaries just to double check. And sure enough, his was there. It was a blow all over again. 

I know why people die, I've known that since I was 11 and grandma died. What I don't understand is what gives God the right to take certain people away who haven't lived life fully? Like Bryce...he was 21..how can that be living? How can you take someone like him away? And then there's dad. He was 49...how is that living? I mean yeah he had 2 kids and 2 step kids and a wife that loved him very much, but to have that torn away from you.

And I HATE how people are saying they understand how I feel. You don't understand how I feel, because you're not going through what I am. Nobody could possibly understand how I feel, why I feel what I feel, and why I am the way I am. And I HATE how people say they're going to help me through this, and nothing happens...it's the same as last year, when I reached out for help...I had so many people tell me that they would help me find help...and nothing happened...so my question is, will you all please stop telling me you'll help me?"

And then I hear that nana is dying, and now she can't talk because she has no energy to talk, and usually in the last stages of cancer you can't talk.

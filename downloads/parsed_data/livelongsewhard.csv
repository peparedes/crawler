Two new skirts. The stripey one, is all vintage fabric that was thrifted last week. I just made a simple tube, added a drawstring waist. Handmade binding for the hem and drawstring. 
Black bird skirt is self drafted a-line skirt with a side zipper. Panels of the vintage bird fabric are in the front and the back. I love this print."

And the matching bag. First time quilting a bag. I just sketched out a shape, sewed some strips together. Made a fabric sandwich with fabric, batting, heavy interfacing. Did some random quilting. Added a lining, with a magnetic snap (that I'm LOVING). Added handles after the fact (which I'm not sure I'm loving, they're kinda bulky looking up close).

I made three of these over the past weekend. Shirring rocks, people! Its easy, simple and makes for some cute wee clothes for your little people. 

Some hints (from my experience) I did NOT wind the thread tight, instead using the directions that came with the elastic thread stating ""wind the thread with little to no tension"" and I used a steam iron when I was finished...you don't actually touch the dress, just blast some steam about an inch above it when your all finished. Its magic! The gathers pucker up all neat and row like :)"

"event","So I made this quilt, using the methods described in ""Quilt in a Weekend"" book that my grammy loaned me. I did take about 2 weeks, working feverishly at night and using a day off during the week, to finish it. Basically, you quilt the top, batting and back as you go, making each block complete. Then you sew the blocks together and cover your seams with bias tape. Finally you sew your rows together and cover the length wise seams with some more bias tape. Then you can finish the edges however your little heart desires. <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/59509848@N00/485661028/"" title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/186/485661028_fdb53f0fa0.jpg"" width=""421"" height=""500"" alt=""finito melvins"" /></a>

These blocks were themed with concert posters of the Melvins. I used bubblejet with a handy dandy ink jet printer to make the prints on 100% cotton. 20 14x14 blocks.

I am immensely proud of myself for 1)finishing this project in such a short amount of time and 2)making a quilt. A frickin' quilt! I usually make bags, clothes, stuff that can be done in an afternoon. I'm normally not good at finishing long, drawn out projects, so this was a big HARRAH for me. Hehe. Will I make another soon? Probably not. But there are some babies on the horizon for a few friends, and I think this would be a nice way to make up some little baby blankets."

Trace a fav pair of pants, making the legs smaller/slimmer. Sew up, add some ric rack and wear. I did put a small zipper in the back as well as some tucks to keep the pants up. This little one has no behind to speak of and has trouble holding her pants up.

"event","Last week was spring break at casa craftys house and we (I) helped 7 kids learn to draft a simple pattern, lay out the fabric, cut fabric and I sewed up them up. Here I'll try to explain how you can get some rockin' pj pants as well! 
<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/59509848@N00/438543915/"" title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/163/438543915_ba965c253a.jpg"" width=""377"" height=""500"" alt=""009"" /></a>
<lj-cut>
Step One:
Take off pants. Fold in the middle, with zipper inside, back pockets on outside. Pull the crotch line out, so it curves away (sort of?) from back of pants. Now if they're the little tiny set (like the little man pictured) you can just tape two newspapers together to trace your pattern. Butcher paper works well too. Note: The little man pictured? He wore some BIG BAGGY pants the day we made these pants, thus his pants are big! 

Step Two:
Fold paper in half, length wise. Lay pants on the paper, (see piss poor paint drawing) with the green dots on the fold side of paper. Trace around pants, leaving about a 2-3 inch seam allowance (bc jeans are tighter than say sweat pants)
<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/59509848@N00/438543913/"" title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/159/438543913_006fde562a_m.jpg"" width=""240"" height=""180"" alt=""pants"" /></a>

Cut out your tracing, BUT DO NOT CUT THE FOLD!!! Your pattern will look like this: <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/59509848@N00/438550076/"" title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/160/438550076_07d0f01f2f.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""pants 2"" /></a>

Step Three:
Lay out prewashed fabric (cotton works well for this) with right sides together, and pin pattern down. Cut out around pattern.

Step Four:
Sew up each ""crotch side"" Then give the pants a shakey shake and twist and you should have some pants that look fine, except you need to sew up the legs! Sew up legs. Hem legs. Put a simple casing in the top & thread elastic through. Sew up elastic and hole you left for threading through. 

Again, sorry for the horrible paint drawings! That was the best I could do right now :)

I don't know what that weird spot is on the front, a reflection? And yes, my dress form has a bottle of garlic salt on her shoulder to balance them (what can I say? she's like 100 years old!) 

The kid tried it on, it fits perfectly, she likes it...sort of. She's a little weary of the color, but I keep assuring her, if this is in fact a mardi gras themed party? Anything goes. Tonight-hemming and finishing. My least favorite things to do."

Easy bag for a boy's birthday gift.
Ingredients:
Two squares of fabric-outside
Two squares of fabric-lining
Two pieces of ribbon
Sew up bag in your preferred method. Me? I like to sew up the bag inside out, flip it right side out and finish the lining bottom last so no seams show. 
Inside I put some markers & blank books and some other goodies so the birthday boy can create his own books. He's into drawing and coloring pictures right now, so it was a well received gift.

A vintage Texas sweater, purchased at Value Village in Texas. I love vintage pieces mixed w/ new :) Makes me smile. Not to mention, sometimes their sizing is better than ready to wear pieces in todays world."

I'm all about sewing simple...these were just two squares sewn together, stuffed and sewn up on the end. Nice, eh?"

Finished at 6:15 p.m.

Two indentical squares of fabric. Sewn down the sides. Serged the bottom, casing for elastic at the top. Stay stitching pulled tight to make the ruffle, which was added per her request at the last minute :) I think I just broke my last record! 
[For a music event at my daughter's school. She needed ASAP. The event started at 7:00 p.m.]"

"event","<p>I made a bulletin board today to tack up my current sewing projects, pics and notes that I don't want to forget. Having them all in one place seems to work for me (as opposed to having them all over the house) 
Step One: 
This came from a local store's dumpster. Sorry for the dark pic.

Step Two: Disassemble frame, keep plexiglass for another project. Find some batting (or I used my wee one's old cloth dipes) and my trusty ol' glue gun. Glue it down to the board that comes behind the glass.

Step Three: Add some fun fabric, like this Road Trip fabric that came from http://www.ciaspalette.com

Step Four: I had to hammer this board in snug so it would stay in the frame (the frame is pretty deep (and yes, I have a red one & a white one-white one was used for this bulletin board) Hang & admire!

"event","<P><FONT color=#000000>&lt;center&gt;...enjoy the power and beauty of your youth. Oh, never mind. You will not understand the power and beauty of your youth until they've faded. But trust me, in 20 years, you'll look back at photos of yourself and recall in a way you can't grasp now how much possibility lay before you and how fabulous you really looked. You are not as fat as you imagine. Don't worry about the future. Or worry, but know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubble gum. <EM>The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your worried mind, the kind that blindside you at 4 p.m. on some idle Tuesday.</EM> Do one thing every day that scares you. Sing. <EM>Don't be reckless with other people's hearts. Don't put up with people who are reckless with yours.</EM> Floss. Don't waste your time on jealousy. Sometimes you're ahead, sometimes you're behind. The race is long and, in the end, it's only with yourself. Remember compliments you receive. Forget the insults. If you succeed in doing this, tell me how. Keep your old love letters. Throw away your old bank statements. Stretch. Don't feel guilty if you don't know what you want to do with your life. The most interesting people I know didn't know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives. Some of the most interesting 40-year-olds I know still don't. Get plenty of calcium. Be kind to your knees. You'll miss them when they're gone. Maybe you'll marry, maybe you won't. Maybe you'll have children, maybe you won't. Maybe you'll divorce at 40, maybe you'll dance the funky chicken on your 75th wedding anniversary. Whatever you do, don't congratulate yourself too much, or berate yourself either. Your choices are half chance. So are everybody else's. <EM>Enjoy your body. Use it every way you can.</EM> Don't be afraid of it or of what other people think of it. It's the greatest instrument you'll ever own. Dance, even if you have nowhere to do it but your living room. Read the directions, even if you don't follow them. Do not read beauty magazines. They will only make you feel ugly. Get to know your parents. You never know when they'll be gone for good. Be nice to your siblings. They're your best link to your past and the people most likely to stick with you in the future. <EM>Understand that friends come and go, but with a precious few you should hold on.</EM> Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle, <EM>because the older you get, the more you need the people who knew you when you were young.</EM> Live in New York City once, but leave before it makes you hard. <STRONG><EM><U>Live in Northern California once, but leave before it makes you soft.</U></EM></STRONG> Travel. Accept certain inalienable truths: Prices will rise. Politicians will philander. You, too, will get old. And when you do, you'll fantasize that when you were young, prices were reasonable, politicians were noble and children respected their elders. Respect your elders. Don't expect anyone else to support you. Maybe you have a trust fund. Maybe you'll have a wealthy spouse. But you never know when either one might run out. Don't mess too much with your hair or by the time you're 40 it will look 85. Be careful whose advice you buy, but be patient with those who supply it. Advice is a form of nostalgia. Dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the disposal, wiping it off, painting over the ugly parts and recycling it for more than it's worth... &lt;/center&gt;</FONT></P>"

the commentators on the american version are so funny.  the food scientist guy likes to over power the announcer guy that's on the floor watching them.  he finishes his sentences for him, trying to guess what's going on before knowing like he's all smart because he has his own show.  and they make such ordinary food on the american one.  like fried lamb chops.  nothing compared to the octopus ink ice cream 
made on the japanese version.  sorry.

in this empty flat alone
in this quiet bedroom we once called our home
the songs you sang made my life sing
the silence here is deafening

if you only knew

call off the search, no one will know that im down here
believe the note i left for you
you can't turn back the clocks, you can't pull me up from here so don't even try

i'm in a car underwater with time to kill, thinking back i forgot to tell you this
<b>i didn't care that you left and abandoned me, what hurts more is i would still die for you</b>

make time slower, give me longer
it's too late for me, no one will know that im down here
believe youre dreams of me sinking
so far, below, you can't pull me up from here so don't even try

leave it up to me. to burden you again. 
leave it up to me. to burden you again. 
this one's not your fault. so forget, so forget, so forget me.

don't think back, don't think back of me at all.
just let me go.
don't think back, don't think back of me at all.
just let me go.
don't think back, don't think back of me at all.
don't think back, don't think back of me at all.
don't think back, don't think back of me at all.</lj-cut></center>

and i'm trying to pretend
oh in wanting life to end

i've got my stereo on ten, i'm screaming connely's pain
and i want to make it louder, louder, louder, louder
to drown out the sound of the road under the tires
yeah, i want, i want, i want it, want it
yeah, i want, i want, i want, i want you

long sighs, sad eyes and twelve hour drives
ten minutes on the phone it never feels like enough

i'm sick with twenty-two days to go
twenty-one days to go
i count them down but they just get
longer, longer, longer, longer, longer
and all the hours, they stretch like all the miles
they run together like the thoughts in my head

"event","One day they set it off
Blowing confusion into our minds
Some say we'll never see
The beauty within our hearts

So help us fight this war
See past your thoughts before
We're all taking battle scars
Just don't you go....

Things never change
Without the strength to move on
What we will be
Depends on what we believe
We'll set it off

We're starting a different life
Confessing we haven't begun to live
Leaving your past behind
You'll follow your heart

What will we do when all is gone?
And what will we say?
Will we ever learn?
What will we do when all is gone?
And what will we say?
No...we'll never learn



this song has a lot of meaning to me.  think about it.  anyways.  had a shitty day because of the finals and all.  miss fregulia didn't tell us about one part of the final(the part she explained while we were on bio trip.  she said it was just 'for our own information') and i bitched to her during the whole thing.  i was so pissed. after school was better.  curt drove me and hannah home.  we sat at my house and looked at pictures and made fun of brent.  doug called while i was asleep so i called him back.  i broke it off.  i feel better.  we talked afterward too so everything's ok i think.  mike called me.  he invited me to the premier of the chronicles of riddick.  i couldnt go though.  i'm going to see it with molly.  plus i had no ride(he did offer to come pick me up).  yeah.  i want to talk to moll but she isn't on.  i'm tired.  maybe i'll sleep early tonight.

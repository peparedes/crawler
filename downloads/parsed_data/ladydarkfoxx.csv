XD It's being translated into german, well, the best i can any ways hehe ^^ it's hard rembering how the sentence are suppose to go and how some of the words are spelled -.-; but yea it's about this girl named akana who belongs in a gang her brother is head boss over...and who takes his job at being a gangster very seriously. Int the beging you see justhow mercyless her brother moxy really is when she is clsoe to death by his own orders before he uses her to knock off a singer int he band 3 deadly sins....but why? She goes to kill him and after shooting him in the head and him not dying she realizes something much bigger is about to unfold before her eyes. After  having sheltered him she begins having weird dreams of the Demon Lord and the Gardian and how her brother and this new singer have some roles int his unfolding game....but what she still is clouded more upon than anything is what will her role be....will she have to side? or will she have to be the one that must sacrifice everything....bum bum bum hehehe stay tuned for more ^^"

"event","It's easy to cast your fears away behind a mask, a mask in which no one can seem to see through only you. I hold it in as I hide behind the  mask of joy as my parents praise me as a jojyful daughter; all the the while you knew I hurt. You saw the teares even w hen I held them in my bright hazel eyes, you saw my frown hidden away behind my fake smile. I could fool anyone and everyone, everyone but you dear love that sees right trough me. So much pain  I have barried away and all you'll see is a empty shell. I have lived a lie so long, oh how you blood hell knew that lie. No more, here is my true side, no more the fake smile but the true frown; no more the bright eyes they look dead with tears. No longer the angel of lifes, but now the angel of truth and pure inner damnnation."

Day by day
a pondering thought runs,
runs through my broken mind.
A mind so dazed
not even death could render it.
A loaded pistol
in a shaking  hand;
it's over.
No more people 
to laugh,
their laugh dead.
No more tears 
to cry,
the tears run dry.
A bloody mess
to hide the sin
of a dance in fire."

He is that fallen lance that lies as hurled,
That lies unlifted now, come dew, come rust,
But still lies pointed as it ploughed the dust.
If we who sight along it round the world,
See nothing worthy to have been its mark,
It is because like men we look too near,
Forgetting that as fitted to the sphere,
Our missiles always make too short an arc.
They fall, they rip the grass, they intersect
The curve of earth, and striking, break their own;
They make us cringe for metal-point on stone.
But this we know, the obstacle that checked
And tripped the body, shot the spirit on
Further than target ever showed or shone."

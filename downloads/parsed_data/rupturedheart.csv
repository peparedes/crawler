"event","Well i move from vegas a little over 2 weeks ago. In some ways its been good, but in more ways its just sucked. I have lost 8 pounds since going on my diet here which is very good! On the other hand i sit at home all the time, i don't have friends here, i get to listen to all the stories of fun over the weekends from my friends. I feel left out and just shitty about it. The more time goes on I find it harder to hold a conversation with them about anything. Most of the phone calls are of them telling me about this party and so on. What am I supposed to say to them ohh thats kewl yeah on saturday night i was aslepp by 8...I doubt that would hold their attention for any amount of time. Music has been helping me through. I have bought 3 new cds since being here. The white stripes....very good cd. rancid...also great and thursday...this is my first cd by them and its damn good. I'll be making a trip to vegas in a few weeks to go to the tsunami bomb concert and hopefully ill be able to stay long enough to see thrice and thursday. I'm also hoping to go to some hardcore shows too. Imiss them. I love watching the kids dance. I wish i could be there and go to the afi show that would very awsome but its sold out anyways...not that its all that hard to sneak into the house of blues...thats how kenny and ronnie got to see thrice last time. I would really like to see thrice again. The rocked at that last show but the crowd kinda sucked. I can't wait for gc to tour cali and vegas I'm gonna make sure that i get to go to shows in both states. I was supposed to go to 2 shows last time the tour but that all fell through and im hoping that this time i wont. My last gc concert was amazing...they are great live. I'm starting to write stories...its harder then writing poetry for me...im hoping to get better as I go. I can still remember my first fan fictions straight and slash. The straight one was when i was 15 and it was about nsync. An slash was also bout nsync. I remeber being way into it and i was just like wow a whole new world. Now im 18 and still reading. Its crazy I can't believe its been that long. Now i only read gc slash fiction...i have still yet to read a straight one with them. anyways i dont know what else to write so later..."

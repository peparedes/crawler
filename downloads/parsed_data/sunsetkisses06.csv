Ok, sorry about the lack of update. I forgot about this thing for the longest time.
Anyway, things with Will and I are great. I went to see Big Fish with Will and Natalee last night. I thought it was a good movie. Will said that we were going to get married, and I was like awwwwwwww.

Damn, sister needs computer. I'll hopefully update later. 

XoXo, 
Hallie"

"event","I hate my family sometimes. It's horriable. Ok, maybe not horriable. But still it's bad sometimes. For the following reasons.

*Ana(we call her Ana but her real name is Anastasia) she is an annoying 10 yr old. Whom gets everything her little heart desires.
*Brad is off at UT and never calls and when he does he's usually drunk.
*Meghan is a senior now and never has time for any of us anymore, that makes me sad because she was like my best friend.
*Jake, he is a 3 yr old. Enough said.

My mom is a workaholic and is hardly ever home and when she does she likes to bitch about how messy the house is. When, it's not even messy at all. My dad doesn't really do anything to make me mad except that he has no backbone when it comes to my mother. It's pathetic sometimes.

I hate being the middle child sometimes. I'm just happy that I have Will to keep me together through all the crap that's been going on lately. He texted my cell today while he was at his dad's just to say he missed and loved me. I thought it was sweet of him. I can't wait till he gets back and comes over for dinner. Well, if we have dinner tonight my mom probably won't make any, which means I'll make it cause Meg is off with Jay. 

Christmas is coming up. I can't wait. I absolutely love Christmas. It always cheers me up."

"event","So this is my first entry. I wonder how often I will update this thing before I forget about. hehehe.
Well for starters, I'm a sophmore at friendswood highschool. I have an extrodinary boyfriend of a year and a half. I love you Will. This is my life. I know I don't have much to update for the first day, but I'm sure things will come to me as the days go on.

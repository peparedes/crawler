Yesterday we had a fire drill at like 7, and i guess that was fun. no, no it wasn't at all. today is my least favorite day of the week, because i have a 2 hour and 40 minute class. the teacher is so dull, and even though the theme is sexuality throughout history, the class sucks. at least 4 days a week i get to watch passions. that is super cool! something to be excited about. and i get to go home this weekend. i'm sorry oswego, but you suck major butt. well i have chemistry in a bit, so i'm heading out. whitack"

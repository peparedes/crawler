<font size=""1"">for all you gimps out there, lemme explain to you just who the fuck i am. i am chad ginsburg, guitarist and back-up vocals for camp kill yourself, also known as cky. for all you lame-ass fuckers out there, you know us as 'the jackass band' or the 'shopping-cart song' band. you fucks.

lemme explain a little of my life so far. i came from nothing, a shithole. i was in a band called rudy + blitz with former alice and chains singer dave kloos, our album was supposed to be released on columbia/ruffhouse records, but they fucked us over and shelved it, big mistake. revenge. buy rudy + blitz, now.

anyhow. i met up with these two fuckwits named deron miller and jess margera at groundhog studios, back when I was producing shit and they played me a demo of a song called 'disengage the simulator' after a few moments of thought, i decided i could rock with these fuckers and the rest is history. we released our first albums, ""volume 1"" and ""volume 2"" on teil martin, and we sold quite a few, bam bam fuck margera made a movie called ""landspeed cky"", and we got bigger, and eventually signed onto volcom entertainment with some other fuck up bands such as ""bueno"". who are nonexistant. hah. assfuckers.

after a few years of fucking hell with volcom and numerous re-releases of ""volume 1"" under various other names and titles, we've now come to the semi-present. we signed with island records famous for andrew w.gay. and sum-31 or whatever, shitty bands. we re-re-re-re-re-released ""volume 1"" (haha). and now we come to the present, no less than a few weeks back, we dropped a bomb on the industry, the first of many, entitled ""infiltrate.destroy.rebuild"" (buy it), and now we're at the present.

if you dont know who the fuck cky is, you will soon, we're opening for guns n' fucking roses, fuckholes.

now. with the basics covered, let me move to things that will not be tolerated, should you come within 5 feet of me:

1. dont ask me about him/her/it whatever the fuck that band is called, from finland, that's bam's deal, not ours, we're not hip to gothlove shit.

2. dont fuck with me.

3. dont touch my fucking mic or i'll kick you in the fucking head.

4. no i wont teach you how to swing your guitar, break your shoulder and learn how just like everyone else.

5. we dont like him.

6. we arent metal/rock. we're cky. we're a fucking genre of our own. dont fuck with us.

now. with that said, if anyone disagrees with what i have to say, fuck you. im chad, you're not. you're not opening for guns n' roses, we are. you know how many bands would suck dick for a spot like that? but we got it, just cause we rock, and you dont, fuckers.


chad i ""can play all the cky songs with my eyes closed and one finger in your girl"" ginsburg"

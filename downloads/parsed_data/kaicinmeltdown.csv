I didn't mention it before, my journal is mainly friends only. 
This is my new favorite song. Desperate Housewives is my new favorite show. I need to update my information."

Dear Abby, Dear Abby
What can I say?
My life's messed up, 
in so many ways.
I'm lost and confused
and don't know what to do,
and that's why I thought 
I'd write this letter to you. 
Signed, 
Bewildered


Bewildered, Bewildered, 
You have no complaint. 
You are what you are, and you aint what you aint. 
So listen up, buster and listen up good,
stop looking for bad luck and knocking on wood. 
Signed, 
Dear Abby"

"event","hey.... well i dunno where to start really, lots of shit has been going on since January.

Jan 6th - passed driving test. woo woo
Jan 8th - got new bf
Feb 2nd - Wrote of my car in a wreck
Feb 6th - broke up with bf koz he was a lazy git and wasted all the time
urmmmmm
Mar 2nd - got new car - am scared of driving ever since
and now were at the end of march. its gone soo quickly! it seems like yesterday i was drunk at new year making out with one very sexy boy called Tim. hmmm, those were the good old days!

Im 18 in less than 6 months. im excited.
Im going to download this year. Im excited. www.downloadfestival.co.uk
Im going to the warped tour this year, YES THE WARPED TOUR!!! in Sacramento CA, on the 7th of july, anyone wanna join me?
Im going to San Fran, Las Vegas, LA and loads of other places at the end of june/early july. PLEASE tell me if you are going to be in any of those places when i am there, i would love to see you guys. 

Meanwhile, i want to get drunk... that sounds nice. Ive been sitting at home the past 2 weeks doing fuck alll. and its annoying me. being wasted is so much fun and i rarely get to do it koz i end up driving everywhere. damn having a car and drivers license. damn it. 

If anyone didnt know, im in a band, we are called Butt Bufkin, and you will love us(only cause i command you to). check us out on www.myspace.com/buttbufkin

"event","i know no one gives a shit bout me or my holiday, but im <i>that</i> bored so i am going to tell you about it.

saturday we arrived at 9. didnt get to the hotel till after 11. even though its only 10 mins from the airport. got lost. had a pergeout 206 as a car. me my mum and nicola squished into the back because the cases wouldnt fit in the trunk. one case, plenty of bags in the front seat. it sucked. no one in my family speak spanish either, so it totally blowed when we were asking for directions. 

sunday i cant remember what we did. i think we just walked round the town and looked at the sea and stuff. the beach was beautiful. we went to a colleseum tooo. its was cool. i would show u pictures but photobucket is being a shite hed. i got piccys now, its only taken me an hour and a half. <lj-cut text=""here are the piccys"">  <img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v63/xxffafchildxx/tarragona 04/IMG_0164.jpg""> 

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v63/xxffafchildxx/tarragona 04/IMG_0155.jpg""></LJ-CUT>

monday we went to barcelona on the train. it was also my mums birthday. she got just over 200 euros. as we were getting on i got my wallet stolen. my mum also had hers nearly stolen, but she felt the mans hand in her purse. she screamed at him to get out and he raised his hands saying i did nothing!. bastards. it had 2 ids 10 euro note, my bank card and piccys of me and ant. i had just got that purse from pac sun. fucking arseholes. we went to barcelona and ate at hrc, then went back. found that a german woman also had her wallet stolen. it happens at that station, and no one there gave a flying fuck. 

tuesday we went to universal mediterranea (universal studios in europe) it was ok we went on the big rides and stuff. well the only big ride there. it has only just been taken over by universal studios, so there is nothing typical to universal yet, apart from outrageous prices. 

wednesday we went to universals waterpark, had fun, nearly died 2 times, got severly burned and after that i walked round covered in after sun all day every day.

thursday we went to universal then moncblanc and just walked round there. not very big. but u got amazing views as you can see from this piccy 

<lj-cut text=""ere""> <img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v63/xxffafchildxx/tarragona 04/IMG_0226.jpg""></lj-cut>

then just chilled at the hotel after that. 

friday we went to universal again. got piccys of me on the bumper cars 
<lj-cut text=""and ere"">

"event","well the party was good. i had fun. i kinda annoyed at some people who said that they would come back, but the didnt. so no goodbye for them, and i am seriously pissed off at one specific person for being a dick head. dont even bother to apoligise, me and dani are really pissed off at you. ARGH!! that seriously pissed me off. I hate it when people are assholes like that. grrrr. he said he would come to. penis face.

Im sorry for people who that does not refer to. i have met so many great people since ive been here, and its been great. i wanna thank patty and dani, who met me at the airport! They have been my party planners (special thanks to dani!) patty who has been my accomplice to places, and the designated driver (not legally tho) :0) thank you two. Thanks to dan who has taken me lots of places, mostly to bens house where i have had fun. Thanks to brandon for making me nearly shit myself when you were doin donuts with me in the truck. that was the first and last time EVAR! Last but not least, thanks to the padgetts for making their home so welcoming to me, and letting me stay here even when alex is in florida. thank you so much.

i dunno what else to say. 

bye"

"event","...was kinda a dissapointment. we got ther at 4:30, and were just packed into a tiny space where you had <i>that</i> much room. by 5:30 and still no water - like they usually have, i was on the verge of passing out. so i get to the end of the cage thingy they put us in, and the bloke said no returning. i said im bout to pass out and he just stood there. i then walked the 10m to costa coffee - still in virgin megastore and say to this woman can i sit here i think im bout to pass out. she said yea and then PUT UR HEAD BETWEEN YOUR LEGS!! i was like wtf okkkkk.. and i did and all the blood rushed to my hed and it felt weird..... i stayed with her the rest of the gig and just talked to her. her name is hillary and she has a daughter who was in the pit thingy who is 14/15 who wants to be a music journalist. it was cool talking to a cool adult. 

Brand New played an acoustic set bout 1 hour long. the 1st two songs were the quiet things, and jude law and a semester abroad - which did make me cry thanks to a certain person. they also played sic transit gloria and soco amaretto lime too.

when the got to the signy bit i couldnt go back in the pit, so i gave my cds to my friend to get signed, but you could only have 1 cd per person per time... and i had 2. i wernt in the thingy, but i coulda gone in, butthere were 300 people infront of me, and i had to go twice. so i sed fuck it. 

kinda sucky for me but my friends enjoyed it :OS"

"event","hola people. i got today off skool, woohoo! im ""ill"" well i kinda am i spose. Its monday, and im still full from a meal i had on saturday. I am so bloated it hurts and when im this bloated i feel sick, but i tried to throw up but mi stomach wont let me :O( grrr. 

on friday nite, i went to sams house for a partay. i didnt get stoned like i planned, but i did have a good time. I have had the shittiest week last week from monday to monday, but its all over now, i hope. well her party was fun, then we went to bed, anddddddd they all left sams house at 8:30 koz they had to be in skool (saturday detentions) and then i walked home. showered, slept, then sean and cheezy came round at bout 1. they hung out here for bout an hour, then we went out to the pub to eat. There were around 20 people there. had a meal. didnt leave till bout 5:30, then went to seanys got changed, shouted outta the window at dave, then went to spams partay agen. (she had 2). Seans mum gave me 2 barcardi breezers, and i dont drink so i thought id sell them at the partay. Then i realised that i havent ever tried them, so i did and i liked them. I then drunk the two, and asked josh to get me 2 more from the shop. he did and by the 4th one i was slightly tipsy, lol. I had a good time that nite. me and sean had never been pissed before and we were. it was funny. he has helped me so much with everything lately and i cant thank him enough for it. we are becoming good friends again. Then i had to sober up koz i had to go home. I then got really upset at dan koz i saw all the cuts up his arms from when we broke up (hes slit all his arms up then sed that he would top himself) and sean comforted me. Sunday i went to work, in the wind and rain. bathed shadow and then went home. woohoo.

i think thats all i got at the minute. ill post piccys of the partay if i can find any later."

I had my college interview for the music college that i want to go to on friday... I had to play 2 pieces of my choice and i was shiteing myself. I decided to play californication and the solo from my generation by the who. I played the who first, i did pretty well. then i played californication. I got it so correct that the man sed i was acccepted there and then. So i am very proud of myself. I also have another college interview in 2 weeks, but now ive been accepted to the other one, i dont want to go. im very very happy. Music is what i want to do.

went to a party on fri nite, and i got a bug from someone. so now im ill.

"event","why do me and dan ALWAYS have our plans disturbed or interrupted? i swear the WHOLE world is against us. I really love him, and i think this relationship is gonna last quite a while. everyttime we do anything, we get interrupted, or something totally fucks our plans up. The most recent one was yesterday. Me and dan have never been out being just the two of us, apart from going to eachothers houses. yesterday i had NOTHING AT ALL to do, so i said to dan early last week if we could spend saturday together, that was a definate yes. On fri nite we went to our friend marks house, and spent most of the time there just hugging, which i loved. Then when he got home on sat nite his mum said that she was going out the whole night, his bro and sisters would all be at their dads houses, and he would be alone. But his mum doesnt trust him being alone all night, cause she said that i would go over there, which is true, but i wouldnt ever sleep over there without permission. So she shipped him off to their dads houses at 12. when i was suppoesed to be going there at 1. WHY DOES THIS ALWAYS HAPPEN?! why is everything always against us. I just want one day sometime soon where we can be together alllllllllll day. That would be heaven. Please let this happen."

"event","heylo people, as you may know last night i went up to london again and saw a band called InMe. I have seen them once before and they were great then, but even better last nite. 

there were 2 bands supporting, X Is Loaded, and Crackout. Crackout were shit, they came out in suits and ties and crap, and they just sucked. X Is Loaded were pretty damn good, i would get their album if they got one. 

Anyways, back to inme. There were not even 1/2 as much croud surfers as there was at GC, but the croud were so much closer, so much hotter, so much more intense. at the beginning of the concert i was rite in the middle of the stage, but when inme came on we were on the left side koz the croud kept pushing. Inme have got better live and they have changed too, the lead singer/guitarist used to have long hair, now he cut it to emo hair, and the drummer had short hair, but now hes also got emo hair too! v sexay indeed. they were so great live. the set list went something like this:

New song - i dunno what it is
Crushed Like Fruit


and i cant membr the rest, ill have to get it off dan :O)

so yea, the last song was Lava Twilight, and everyone was croud surfing, and i got hed butted by the bloke next to me in my temple, so that hurt, and as i was at the very front, ther were many croud surfers to help up, i pushed one up, in a fist shape, and a pain surget thru my finger.. i think i broke it by the knuckle. Now, it is still the same as last night, my mum thinks that im faking, but it hurts so she can go away :O(

so im rawkin out to inme talkin to lauren and this other girl kerry that i met ova the internet, and she sed that she was at inme last nite too, how strange. 

ok well bye :O)"

"event","well last nite i had to go to the WORST part of london to a gig that i didnt even want to go to ... Good Charlotte. I had to go with my sister and her friend. Believe me i had no choice over the matter. i HAD to go. 

Mest and sugarcult were supporting them. they were pretty damn good. 

As soon as it got to good charlotte EVERYONE started to push forward... and us 3 are us against a bar at, can u believe it, rib level. I have very brusied ribs.

As soon as ""Girls & Boys"" started people were croud surfing all over the place.... they wernt little people either. They all FAT!! as in HUGELY fat. so im by the metal bar in my ribs and this fat croud surfer lands on my back... pushing me into the bar even more... now my boobs hurt. THENN someone threw someone(croud surfer) at us and landed on all three of us. As i was in the middle i got the most of the blow. as in my neck went at near enough a right angle to what it had been. I just screamed and burts out crying. this dude behind me asked if i was ok and i just bawled it and ran. i pushed so many people outta the way to get outta there. This security guy then asked if i was ok and i just sed someone jumped on my neck, he took me to 1st aid straight away. to be honest it was better in there than it was in the concert. they guy was really nice and i was laying on a stretcher for an hour getting my neck back into shape. At first they thought that i had broken my neck, but then as the time went by i could slowly move it. The paramedic was really nice and took our mind off things. My sister and her friend were still in there being pounded by the selfish croud. meanwhile in 1st aid i met a few people. One girl (i dont know either of the peoples names) she had fainted (not surprising from the heat) but was telling stories of at one concert she had fainted 7 times... now i dont think anyone could beat that.. or be stupid enough to keep doing it. Also there was a boy who just got headbutted in the nose by some random person for no reason, so his nose was spurting blood the whole time we were in there. It was pretty cool sharing stories about different things, people and places. I love it when you just have a really good conversation with someone that you know that you will never talk/see again.

Well a day on and my neck is better. You may call me stupid or just insane but i am going up to London AGAIN tomorro for ANOTHER gig, this time smaller venue - only bout 1000 and i'll be with dan :O)

WOW ... this was a long update on only one day... i might go, i might not.

i think thats a not.

today was the last day of school for 2 weeks and 6 days (apparantly) thank god. Ive had my exams, and they suck, but i think that i'll get some good grades W/O studying in my final FINAL ones, but if i do study.. good things will happen my friends. 

Man i was so tired today. i got in at 1am last night, and as i see 11pm to be a late night for me i was totally outta it today. I really didnt see the point of going to school today because i only had 3 lessons. then an assembly, and all the head teacher (principal) says is what we did during the year... whoop de bloody do. I fell asleep and Kim was laughing at me. So tonight is going to be my ""early"" night, but seeing as its 11:03 i dont think it will be. 

I really do love dan, really really do. hmmm. :O)

P.S. the concert went really really well for us. the croud were clapping to us all through jons solo, and we got a HUGE buzz from it. if you didnt kno we played Ozzy Osbornes Crazy Train.. uncut... all this hard work has paid off."

"event","Decided to make some more icons since the urge to do so hit me.  I was going to sit on these icons for a while and make a bigger post later, but <lj user=""cwtyger""> insisted that I do a post today.  So here are my icons.

Balto - 6
Balto 3: Wings of Change - 1

Total - 10

Comment and credit <lj user=""silver_huskey""> or <lj user=""silverstyle""> if you take. ^^  No hotlinking and no stealing.  Most importantly, please enjoy. :D

*Edit*

Whoops!  Almost forgot to mention something...  The brushes I used came from <lj comm=""100x100_brushes""> and more importantly from <lj user=""ewanism""> and <lj user=""liminalstate"">.  They have some good work there, if you're into Photoshop and Paintshop Pro brushes, you ought to check it out."

"event","Wow, I haven't updated this journal in two years!  Since I'm not updating Silver Style much, I've decided to convert this journal into an icon journal.  Here I will post icons, wallpaper and whatever else seems fitting.  Best of all, anything I post here will be listed way before I put anything on my websites.  Think of it as a first showing of sorts and a way to keep track of my stuff.

The rules regarding this journal and icon sharing are in the user info, but I'll post it here for those too lazy to look:

<lj-cut text=""the rules"">
1. Credit me! If you use my icons, please credit <lj user=""silver_huskey""> somewhere.

2. No hot linking! Stealing bandwidth is bad, okay? If you're using a blogging service, use their servers to upload your icons. If you're on a forum, use your own webpage or photo-hosting service.

3. No stealing! Don't pass these icons off as your own.

4. Did I mention to credit me?
</lj-cut>

Also if you're interested in friending this journal, would you mind leaving a comment in this entry?  It would help me keep better track of people and allow me to add you faster, since <lj user=""silver_huskey""> is my main journal.  Thanks again."

"event","Wow, it's been nearly two months without an update! Sorry about that, i've been a bit busy with life. However, I did manage to accomplish a few things. It's amazing what you can do when in TBL chat at 4am in the morning...

I updated my art gallery with two new works, added gift art to that section, updated the links page, the photo gallery and updated my video game status page. Which is the main reason why I haven't been updating much. I've gotten myself a PS2 (had to replace my old Playstation in order to finish Chrono Cross) and a copy of Final Fantasy VII. It was definately worth the 20 bucks at the game store. 

I've finished a story and taken a screen cap of my new desktop wallpaper. But i'm feeling too lazy to upload them this morning. So i'll have to wait until next update. See you then!

As for last minutes updates, a mini rant was posted last night. The splash page was changed accordingly and that's about it for the moment. Future updates will be posted when I get around to them. ;)

An hour later, I changed my mind.  Besides I could simply tell everyone in my LJ and make my website rounds later, right?  So I happily uploaded the splash page, and went to announce the grand opening through blogger.  Unfortunately their server was down.  That's right, unavailable for viewing!  Just when I needed it the most!

With a cry, I wished that I hadn't relied on an outside server to post updates with.  There's a reason why Newspro is more popular than blogger, you upload it directly to your own server.  And you don't have to put up with unexpected crap.

So once again Silver Style is delayed.  Damned Blogger..."

I wanted to kick of the site by finishing a story that I was working on, but I don't know. I may just open the site without it."

"event","I've been working my tail off trying to get Silver Style together. I've been working so hard that i've fallen behind in all of my usual online places. Well at least when I return I'll have good news for them. At this rate Silver Style may be open before the end of the week. I just re-did the About Me and About Silver Huskey pages. I felt that they had too much information, and the flow of the paragraphs was a little dull. I added more information such as instant messenger handles to the E-mail Me page and such. Finally I added another link to the links page, managed to get an essay up, add a new piece of gift art from Snow Wolf, moved some pictures around in the Photo Gallery and updated my Video Game Status page. 

I've fixed every broken link on the site, every link now has a page. Next I hope to add more stuff to the Odd Stuff section, re-do this news page, fix up the splash page, add a few more essays and perhaps one more story to the fiction lab. *Phew!* Talk about a big update. :) Oh and my birthday went well."

"event","First off, I must note that today is my Birthday! So um Yey! 

Yesterday, I spent the time finally working on this site. I re-did the Gift art galleries. It should be easier to view now, and I think i've gotten everyone who gave me artwork up to date. I also added some links to the links section, got the E-mail me page up, edited some of my fiction, and added links to a few stories. ""Sage!"" (ugh), ""Tribute to 'Flowers for Algernon'"", and ""Demonic Origins"" are now up. On one last note, i've also changed my e-mail address."

"event","Wow, just about two months without an update. And sadly, Silver Style still isn't open yet. But I guess the purpose of this update is to let those of you who read this know that i'm still working on it. Not everyday mind you because of school, but I haven't given up on the site yet. Nor do I plan to. 

Lets see I'm going to ditch thumbnailing all of the photos that I have. I'm only going to keep the more interesting ones on site. As for the rest, I'll be putting them up in Yahoo! Photos, they should be easy to browse there. I've got several new pieces of artwork up done by myself, and a few pieces given to me as gifts/art trades. I want the section to look good, so I might split my artwork up further into years, and the ""Gift Art"" up by artists. I hope that works out. I should probably do the same with my fiction, although I have a lot less of it... Hmm..."

"event","Blah, this is going slowly but surely. ;) I fiddled with the blogger look a bit more, and decided to change the template. I really have to stop doing these adjustments before bed. I can barely keep my eyes open, much less make sense of this! As for Silver Style itself, I moved some fanart around offline, but I have yet to thumbnail it. Same goes for a few new peices of artwork I drew myself. The photos section is coming along nicely, and I have a new writing for the Fiction Lab. Lots to do, but i'm still holding off on actual updates until I get a hold on my other sites."

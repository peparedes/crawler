They're annoying and it's like I don't exist anymore. so stupid. Ughh I feel so dramatic. Like in my head it's like ""I never get anything I want and things never go my way"" That can't be true. I guess I just have to learn how to suck things up. Easier said than done I suppose. But yeah, I'm being way too dramatic. I'm just lonely,bored, and I wanna just not be here. :'( I have adult swim and possibly a phone call to look forward to. That cheers me up."

It took him awhile to realize it was over. But, the girl started liking him again. This kind of confused the boy. He went along. She had his heart in her palm. The boy liked her but he didn't know if she liked him back. This tortured the boy for months. One day, the girl likes another boy. The boy doesn't know what to do. She crushed his heart. How could she do that to him? She didn't tell him anything.

"event","so today sorta stunk. i slept during school. schools stupid. me nick murr the key went skating in some sick garage in malden. igot free food today. today was freeezing!

one of the coolest dreams i ever had:
it was dream within another dream. The dream in the dream was a horror movie.
The lady was either giving out or candy or not. But, one time she opens the door and its this figure in a very silky black cloak with a hockey mask with no holes just black eyeholes. The lady shuts the door and freaks out. The door had two door knobs right next to each other. One unlocked and the other was turning. The lady was just freaking out so she grabbed a knife. The figure came in and she cut the thing straight down the middle perfectly. It didn't do anything! The figure juss stabbed the lady so hard so many times it was uber bloody. Then a thought came to my head. ""Where is the hot chick that always dies?"" a hot chick shows up and i wake up

I've had lyk some pretty lifechanging dreams lately.

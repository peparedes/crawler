"event","I don't know why, i don't know how, but for some reason i completely blanked out.  I first thought maybe its drugs? wait i'm not on drugs... maybe i need to be? Then i thought Where am I? 6th period math... Hell in my not so perfect world.  Then i thought why am i talking to myself? I'm the only one who listens? maybe its drugs... In any case that about sumed up my day.  I skipped 4 hour to have a heart to heart with my buddy lauren and i got a really cool Chocolete( How do you spell that?) easter egg from Gus aka. John Caleb aka. Sug aka. Gussie aka. lord and supreme master of Gusdom....ect.

 My little Gus has finally grown up and found himself a love interest. Alex and I will not let him hear the end of it either.  He is the oldest of the three of us and he is the weirdest by far.  Alex is a close second and me of course perfect in everyway... for those of you who don't know us we are the fearsome three. Friends forever or atleast until we kill eachother.  Gus is the oldest, alex is next by a few weeks, and I happen to be the young one.  When it comes to girls I have Sarah, Alex kinda has two bi girls, and gus by 6 period tomorrow should get Alicia.  Just a little background on the three of us.
  
As for life otherwise Its not that bad. Baseball was good except for the whole running twice as much as i had to part because i went with the sophomores and then had to run again with the juniors. 

 I feel so much better now about Sarah and i'm not nearly as worried about her.  I'm gonna throw the book at her this time.  Every bit of charm and every little trick i have is going into the pot so i can hopfully win her back.  I don't think i ever lost her but i don't want to let her slip away.  I care for her to much.  

until next time...."

"event","Well now is one of those moments when you sit and do nothing waiting for next period to start and hoping that the librarian doesn't ask you for a pass.  If you haven't guessed i'm skipping because i need to talk to laura about something more important than whatever the hell we were going to do in fourth hour.  That was the bell so bye."

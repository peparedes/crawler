i had a freehand drawing class which seems okay. 
but then i went to poli sci expecting a liberal teacher cause that is what everyone told me i'd have. 
well i must have gotten the only conservative teacher cause he started of by telling us that he hates gays, then he moved on to how he doesnt want to pay taxes becasue he doenst think that he shoudl have to help pay for people that are too stupid and poor to go get an education. 
then he ended with telling us about all the liberals taht think that the war is over oil. and he was like yeah it is but as long as we need oil we are going to go to war. 
and then i stoped listening to him.


so my first day was terrible
tomorrow is english."

they used to laugh with their hearts
and laugh with their eyes;
but now they only laugh with their teeth,
while their ice-block-clod eyes 
search behind my shadow..

there was a time indeed 
they used to shake hands with their hearts;
but that's gone, son.
now they shake hands without hearts
while their left hands search
my empty pockets.

""feel at home,""""come again""
teysay, and when i come
again and feel
at home, once, twice,
there will be no thrice--
for then i find doors shut on me.

so i have learned many things, son.
i have learned to wear many faces
 like dresses--homeface,
officeface, streetface,  hostface, cocktailface,
with all their conforming smiles
like a fixed portrait smile.

and i have learned too
 to laugh with only my teeth
and shake hands without my heart.
i have also learned to say, ""goodbye,""
when i mean ""goodriddance""
to say ""glad to meet you""
without being glad, and to say ""its been
nice talkiing to you"" after being bored.

but believe me, son.
i want to e what i used to be
when i was like you. i want 
to unlearn all these muting things
most of all, i want to relearn 
how to laugh, for my laugh in the mirror
shows only my teeth like a snake's bare fangs!

so show me, son.
how to laugh; show me how
i used to laugh and smile 
once upon a time when i was like you."

i just realized today after seeing laura that things have changed and i miss my friends
first is laura, we hung out like everyday and now not seeing her is really weird.
i think it is time that we hung out...now
i think i also miss nessa 
but that really isnt anything i can help now that she moved to long beach
and bev we still hang out sometimes but there needs to be more before you move back to canada

my grandpa was not in a casket and only the family could see him and it was really weird to see him just laying there dead.

monday i still felt a little sick, today i feel better though"

I don't even feel like updating now that I'm done talking to Casey. I need to call Carly. I miss her, and I was supposed to call her about 22 minutes ago. So good bye until then. Reach me after 9pm at 770 757 6201. Don't hesitate to call, good conversation is always welcome. Peace."

"event","So, I've been bumming around town for the past few weeks, and to tell you the truth, it sucks for the most part. I'm broke, I'm homeless, but on the bright side, I have Carly. She kind of everything I have when aside from her, I got the clothes on my back and the contents of a book bag. I don't eat to often anymore, but that's to be expected I guess. I hate panhandling for money. I fucking hate it. I like working for my money. I'm good for it, I earned it you know? No one can take that away from me. I earned what I have. For the most part, I'm pretty happy. Then again, I'm pretty high. Heh.

I just saw a commercial on the History channel. It was like a credit card commercial spoof. At the end it said, ""But money can't save you from everything, like the French Revolution."" Makes me think of something I just said to Mike, ""Ich habe nichts."" ""But, that's something the rich fucking beaurocrats don't have.""

Well, at any rate, I'm going to go to bed. Oh, and I'm staying with Danny and his Dad tonight. That's why I have access to a computer."

"event","So yeah, I know I haven't been around too much or updated too much in the past month or so.. But you know how it goes. I got evicted on the 30th of Nov. and was homeless for a little while. That sucked a good bit. But now I found a job working at Direct Circulation Inc. I travel all around the country selling magazines, encyclopedia sets, and other books to the top 10%(High end- mutli millionaires). I leave tomorrow morning on Greyhound. It's all pretty sudden considering I called about the job yesterday, had an interview yesterday, confirmed the hire today, and now I'm leaving tomorrow. Well, I'll miss everyone, especially my dearest Carly.

Well, In other news, I tagged this bomb ass little piece with a pilot magic marker last night. If you want to take a look at it, it's on a metal shed behind the dry cleaners that's right next to the Waffle House in Swuannee at the intersection of P'tree Industrial Blvd. and L'ville Swuannee Rd. Not to mention some other taggs ofcourse, but that piece is all I did. You should be ablke to tell right away who did what. Which also reminds me, I'm going to be doing a lot of tagging and bombing in all the cities and shit that I'm going to be at. At any rate though, It's about time Igo smoke a cigarette and see if I can't get started on packing up  what I need. Good bye everyone, but keep in mind I have free roaming and long distance on my cell phone so give me a ring any time. 770 377 7549

Much love."

"event","Apparently I can't seem to hide my journal from either of my parents. And it's just fucking annoying. I remember this one time, I had some privacy, OH! NO! WAIT! I didn't. Fuck the both of you, if you want to know what I'm doing, fucking ask and I'll tell you. If you want to do stupid under handed shit like this, then seriously.. Fuck the both of you. So, in other words, I'm putting my journal back on friends only mode because my parents can't seem to get it through their thick heads that I like my privacy. But hey, you remember that one time when I went snooping through all of your shit.. Oh, no wait.. That never happened, I have the decentcy not to. If I want to know something I ask. And even then, the both of you fucking lied your asses off about tons of shit to me. It's really ironic. Both of you really hated being lied to, I remember being spanked with a frying pan because I lied to my mom. And being spanked with a bread board by my dad for lying. But it's okay for you guys to lie to me, because I'm your child. But it really doesn't matter any more.. I could say some really mean shit, and embarass the hell out of the both of you, which isn't even the slightest extent of what you two ass hats(A person who wears their ass as a hat, i.e. You have your head up your ass) deserve. But I'll have some decentcy..

I like my privacy. Good day."

But that just means I don't have to pay the beer pig because I got everyone drunk one night. Awh man.. I was hitting on this one girl there last night. And it was hilarious.. Because I was like, ""I know I'm patheticly single, but would you like to date?"" ""No.."" ""Yeah.. I wouldn't date me either."" Atleast I created some conversation. And they kept telling me I vommited on the pizza box, and I didn't and I we kept fuckin' arguing about it. I don't know who vommited on the pizza box, but you need to go ahead and die. Oh my god..

I talked to an old friend from HS the other day. Premo is going to The University of Hawaii in Manoa. She's doing so good for herself, and she just got back from traveling around the country and squating everywhere. Jon and Beldar are still squating all over. I haven't seen or heard of them in so long. Last time I talked to Jon was a month or so ago, and he was getting out of the drug scene. I'm proud of him. Ah well, no one really knows what the fuck I'm talking about, but I do. And that's all that matters to me at the momment.

<i>To all my friends present, past, and beyond

Life is the most precious thing that you could lose 
While you were here the fun was neverending 
Laugh a minute only the beginning 
Kevin, Coleman, Nichols, this one's for you 

Ever get that feeling you can't go on 
Just remember whose side it is that you're on 
You've got friends with you till the end 
If you're ever in a tough situation 
We'll be there with no hesitation 
Brotherhood's our rule that cannot bend 

When you're feeling too close to the bottom 
You know who it is you can count on 
Someone will pick you up again 
We can conquer anything together 
All of us are bonded forever if you die I die that's the way it is

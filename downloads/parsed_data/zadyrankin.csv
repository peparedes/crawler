"event","I have worked out every small detail 
In this plan I've made. 
This thing which cannot fail. 
I dare myself to do this one thing. 
You can have my car 
You can have everything. 
All that's good is gone. 
I have tried too long. 
I don't think I miss my mom & dad, 
The class I cut, 
The friends I never had., 
These things I won't miss, 
Won't miss me. 
My house, 
My block, 
The baby bird I set free. 
The dance that I was never asked to, 
The teachers 
that thought they knew me. 
They'll all remember what I did. 
They'll ask ""Whose fault was it?"" 
""Oh she was just a kid."" 

I'll be glad to go, you see. 
You don't even know me. 
Not at all."

and i feel like this is a day to be celebrated not if your candidate won or not it seems that maybe our elections would get more people if we treated it as a holiday than as a burden it is an interesting process i will post about whats been up in my life shortly but i feel like a nice nap

Happy Inauguration Day everyone!"

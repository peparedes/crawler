The only thing that seems to be a good thing, is my voice is coming back little by little. :)  Other than sneezing my head off and coughing, what else is new?! :(  Oh and going through a box of tissues this weekend!  hehehe

Can some one not have their own opinion about something?  My chief complaint about living in the south, is that I am allergic to pine and have allergies.  I am from the NORTH and didn't have problems until we moved here.  Also the weather down here can be night and day.  One week it can be snowing and cold, the next you are wearing shorts!  Up north, it stays one thing through each season.  Right now, its bloody summery hot outside!  :(  I guess some can't take another's opinion.  One wrong comment, and your head might as well grow feet and walk on off! :(

Well I am off to get some more tissues. Later All!"

My friend Amanda finally got a new computer! YAY! We are working on a website together, and now she can help me out! I am running 3 sites right now, and going nuts with them all! Speaking of those, I need to update Terin's site! hehehe Gotta love being a fan of some one! hehehe

This month has flown by! Yesterday marked a month ago I went and saw SOI, and today marks a month ago I donated blood. Tomorrow marks a month ago I turned the big 2-3! LOL I have yet to get my donor card thing from American Red Cross, and I requested a new one. When I called yesterday she said it would cost $5 for a new one! So I am hoping I will just get a new card! LOL Make my life easier! 

Oh, I got to talk to Jen and Svea last night on the phone! Gotta love 10 10 987! hehehe It's $2 for an hour call to Canada, or anywhere! Svea is in Vancouver to see the final SOI show and going to the chariety hockey game that Jamie and David are doing, and she came from Germany! I am amazed she came all that way! I hope Jen is able to get meet n greet passes! :) I just find it cool she came out that far, and shoot if I was an ice skater, I be honored! :) I have got my Kati and Rene icon on display for her. hehehe

Having my 2 1/2 year old niece here isn't helping much either with my headaches. :) I barely am able to get on here cause my family won't watch her, and I wind up babysitting all day! At the end of the day, I am either too tired or my head is pounding, and getting on the computer makes it worse! :( OH WELL! What can ya do?!

We went to Charlotte for the day yesterday, which was probably a huge mistake. It was 3 hours there and 3 hours back. Gaia has some sort of rash or something on her back, and it made her miserable all day yesterday. :( So we got home about 10 last night, and she didn't want to sleep! So I had to read 3 books to her and finally let her cry. We did get to see most of my family yesterday, which was great! 

I think I am going to get off here. I am getting my head bitten off, and tired of it already! LOL TTYL!"

Um I am going to see Stars on Ice on March 26 and 28!  :)  YAHOO! :)  Again on my birthday, but this year its in my hometown of Columbus, Ohio.  My friend won tickets and VIP passes to it and so NOT only going to be seeing the show, but meeting the cast! :)  March 26's is in Raleigh, NC, and that will be interesting to see if my seats are where they come in and out!  I been hearing they come over to the audience areas at the end, so I am going to be BOLTING down the row to get over in time!  If not I can try the tour buses, but even that you have to FIGURE out where they are!  I guess I will follow the people out!  :)  I am very excited about seeing it again.  I had so much fun last year, and I got to meet most of the cast on my birthday.  :)  You can only thank them so much for coming over and signing autographs and such, right?!

Hey Terin- don't let that gosh forsaken balance beam get you down!  :(  Your meet last weekend was awesome over-all!  Congrats Carly and Jason on winning the Visa American Cup!  Blaine- I am praying for you that you make a quick recovery from your injury and surgery!  The good news is that you are able to move your upper arm, so maybe you will be back in time for Athens! :)

A girl here in Charlotte, NC lost her battle with cancer over the weekend.  She was 12 years old.  Her name was Hope Stout, when the Make A Wish Foundation came to her to grant a wish, she told them that she wanted them to grant the wishes of the other 156 kids on the list.  So they set up a memorial fund in her name and want to raise a million dollars.  So far they have raised over half of it.  People this was this girl's dying wish PLEASE help out.  There are two ways you can donate in her name.  Go to www.celebrationofhope.com and click on donate online or you can send it via snail mail.  Any little bit helps.  PLEASE help make this girl's dying wish come true!  Thanks!"

"event","Did everyone have a good Christmas?  I did except I was sick the week before x-mas and then had my monthly friend Christmas eve!  LOVELY EH?  

It started the weekend before last when my brother, sister in law and niece came in.  I woke up that Thursday with a bad sore throat.  We had a real Christmas tree and it aggravated my sinsuses and allergies.  :(  So I was in misery that whole weekend while they were here.  We went Friday and took my niece to this putt putt golf and games place that my brother and I always went to as kids.  My niece had a ball with the ski ball game and this other game.  She likes to throw balls and she did pretty good!  She won 215 tickets!  (Well with the help of her grandpa, aunt and daddy)  Saturday we tried to go shopping with Gaia too, but she wasn't feeling right.  That night she ran a 102 temperature, but we figured out that she was teething.  Then Monday and Tuesday I babysat my aunt's friend's 3 year old daughter.  It was two days of hell!  She wouldn't do what I told her to do, and she cussed to top that off!  That kid got a big whooping at one point.  Now she wants me to sit New Years Day, and that ain't going to happen!  

Christmas Eve morning I woke up and went over to my grandparents to open my ornament. (its a tradition I been doing since I was a baby)  I got the Madeline one and a light up Christmas shirt one.  Went back to my aunt's and we got the house ready for company that night and went to church at 4.  It was the longest kid's mass that I have ever sat through and the church was packed!  Family came at 6:30 for dinner.  We opened family presents.  I got a sweater, a mouse for the computer with jewels all over it, a butterfly puzzle, beanie babies from my dog, stationary, planner and some other stuff probably.  Then we had dessert and went back over to my grandparents and I did my parent's presents.  The main thing I got was stuff to make a scrap book!  I am so excited about it too!  Then I got Mario Brothers Advance 4 and the game book, CDs: Mandy Moore, A Walk To Remember, Rachel Stevens, Hilary Duff and Clay Aiken; DVD: Two Of A Kind, toe socks, stationary, karokee machine and cds for that, pj's, bookmarks, a devotional book.  I think thats it.  Christmas Day I opened the rest of my aunt and uncle's stuff and Santa.  I got pj's, wizard of oz dvd, toothbrush, ring holder, word searches, a planner, peppermint bark candy (mmmmm) and some other stuff.  I got too much crap basically!  

So that was my Christmas and new years is next!  TTY SOON!"

"event","Well I am almost 3 weeks post-op and yet you can still see the scars from the surgery!  I am so impatient, but I pulled out my final stitch cause they left one in!  Hehehe it was weird doing that, but its out and somewhere on the floor!  My aunt got the pictures back, and theres one from the day I had it, having the stitches uncovered, and after!  And also pictures from the Reinassance Festival last weekend where I had my hair done!  So I am anxious to get home!  I want to thank all my friends and family for their prayers and support through my surgery.  It wasn't all that bad of an experience!  It has YET to be worth it, but its nice to pull my hair back and not see 3 huge bumps on my forehead, and to brush my hair without hitting a quarter size mole on my neck!  :)  But this ordeal is over with, I plan on going back before Christmas, MAYBE, to get more off.  Next time it will be done under local.  Hey even the surgeon said he didn't blame me for wanting something to relax me, he even said he go that way!  :)  Well I am off here to eat some of the trick-or-treat candy my aunt and uncle brought me back from the mountains!  WOOHOO!"

My parents said the winds are blowing and its raining hard there, but no power lost yet!  WHICH IS A MIRACLE!  I hope they don't loose it because I am taping my show at home and haven't been rolling out of bed to watch it every morning.  I did this morning and really didn't follow it too well cause I fell asleep at 1 this morning!  HAH This Hurricane has something in common with my cousin's baby, they have the same name and like a hurricane she can tear up things in a instant!  

Well I go to the plastic surgeon on the 26th to see about my moles being removed.  My grandma and I counted 20 that need to come off and probably even more than that!  The ones on my face and neck for sure are coming off.  I am like take them all off if you want, as long as I am sleeping during it!  Its either knock me out or forget it completely!

My niece's birthday is coming up!  She is going to be 2 on the 29th!  My parents and I got her these cute little dress up outfits for her to play with.  She loves to get into my sister in law's stuff and dress up.  We also got her this little cleaning cart that has a vacuum cleaner that picks up dirt and such!  Its so cute!  I had a blast when her and my brother were here. I can't wait for them to move back to Columbus at the end of the year! :)

Well I am going to go here!  I have no clue if I changed my e-mail address on here, but my new one is ButterflyGirl328@nc.rr.com.   Hey Jenika!  YOU NEED TO MAKE UP A MORE SIMPLE E MAIL ADDRESS!!!!!!!"

"event","I got up Tuesday morning at about 6:30 with terrible back pain!  My parents were both like its just your pulled muscle WELL THEY WERE WRONG!  I went to the doctor to find out that I have a UTI!  Where the infection might have spred to my kidneys WHICH explains the back pain!  Well now I am having bladder spasms where I have to pee all the damn time and its painful!  I should've gone to the doctor 2 weeks ago when it all started!  But the good thing is that there is a TINNIEST chance of it being a kidney stone!  WHICH my parents both have suffered from, but I will find out tomorrow or Monday when he gets the results back in!  I had to go back today and I still have blood in my urine, which isn't good, but the white cell count is down (AKA INFECTION) so its going in the right direction."

Let me tell you all something Melissa flies off the handle at the dumbest and littliest things and its old!  I haven't heard from her since I left Ohio and she said we are friends again.  Shows ya how much of a liar she is.  I might go back to Ohio cause I want to go to Cedar Point and Kings Island with my best bud!  She is coming down here in August when I get home from my extended trip out to CA!  WOOHOO!

But anyways I hurt my back last week and been tied up on a heating pad.  I pulled a darn muscle and its getting better!  I got an extension on my paper and so its all cool!  I am so proud of myself for reading from page 286-730 something in the 4th Harry Potter book since the 5th one came out and then 116 pages of the 5th in 2 days!  Aren't you proud?!  I AM!

"event","Well I been in Ohio for almost 2 weeks now and haven't really done a thing.  My ankle is killing me the last two days, and I am getting together with my best friend on Saturday!  WOOHOO!  I haven't seen her in 2 years almost!  Melissa on the other hand is her still bitchy self, and I am sick of her games!  I see her on Saturday after she told me she was too busy, I will be pissed off beyond belief!  We had a big mother butt storm here last night that sent me running for the hills.  The thunder was so loud and I can't stand storms.  I haven't been able to since I was little and I don't like loud thunder.  Yeah Yeah Yeah...I sound like a baby, but I been that way since I was little!  So give me a break!  They woke me up at 1 and 3 this morning!  

Well thats it!  I am going to go watch the season finale of ER and read!  I have read 200 pages of the 4th Harry Potter book and have 300 more to go!  At that part where they go to the kitchen and see Dobby there.  That elf got on my nerves in that movie!  ARG!

SEE YAS!"

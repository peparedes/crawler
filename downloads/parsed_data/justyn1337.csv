"event","I love talking to Alexis, we always have very thought provoking and very productive conversations. Tonight while talking to her I came up with a bizzare short-story/movie primise about a man who thrives working clothing-retail to meet and hook-up with the women who work there. 

He gets off to having sexual experiences and obtaining those he works closely with on a day to day basis. After he has sexual encounters with one or several women at each department store/retail outlet he quits and finds a job at another store. He compulisively gets off to meeting women at women and proceeds to leave the store after each successful encounter. Eventually he finds a new position at a new store, and along with it a new women. Only this time she and him hit it off very well and he is overcome with actual feelings rather than shallow sexual fulfillment. Something hes never felt before and must overcome his past and enter a relm of self discovery. 

Its all up in arms but who knows, I might run with it. I've always wanted to write a book."

that is too low for what we would need at the club.
if you can build your monthly up to $500 or more in bar sales then we might be able to sort something out.

"event","Last night's FUCKING AWESOME FEST was fucking awesome, but not only because of the, well, fest, but because of the happenings before the fest. Me and Alexis arrived and sat outside waiting to get bracelets to get in from Steven from Marco Polio and the New Vaccines when we see this guy walking down the street with plaid pants on and generally kind of looked very...Bellevillian as I put it. Too many bracelets, skateboard shoes...ya know. Well we strike up a convo and share our stories and get together know eachother. Hes a super nice guy who goes by the name of ""Jussen"" and we all quickly became friends. Me and Jussen have a lot of ties in the Detroit scene, as he is ROOMATES with Wilhelm K from The Works. Kind of small world, Detroit. At any rate, he offers to get us all crunk before the show we we bought a pint of Burnett vokda and Faygo and head off to a dark sidestreet to get pre-Magic Stick buzzed. Within minutes we wobbled back to the Magic Stick and catch a lame punk band and wait for Silverghost. I meet up with Michael and Stevie, and see a few familar faces along the way.

Silverghost was super good, and after that we caught F'KE BLOOD who really tore the place up with art-punk energy. I saw Anthony and his crew who we all hung with for the rest of the night. Jussen also seemed to have hooked up with one of Anthony's boys as well. He brought this girl with him from Riverview whos name escapes me but is totally gorgeous and had some sweet dance moves and sense of style. Might need to do some investigating. 

ADULT. was AMAZING. I have never heard of a show of theirs that packes and it quickly turned into a skuzzed out loud as fuck electro-punk dance party. Me and Mike got our slammin'z on and me and Alexis bumped asses to Glue Your Eyelids together as well as Nite Life. Ah! They seemed offput by being back in Detroit. I might just be their general ""i'm so unaware"" personas, but they didn't seem to really be excited to be back in the city that they grew up in. I dunno.

"event","Okay, fuck this. So today at work was the general array of crap that neither me nor Kayla needed. We arrive as usual, after I pick her up due to her car being broke'd, and meet up with Val who is her usual cheerful morning self with only good things to say about us. Ugh. She makes us tear down a wall of clothes and put it back up in 20 minutes because when this head honcho visual comes in she'll expect us to have it done in 15 minutes and what not. Thats fantastic....but ridiculous expectations. Apparently this girl, Mocca (you know she nicknamed herself after watching way too much Americas Next Top Model and figuring she was too fat to do anything productive herself, so she'll nazi stomp teenage clothing stores) has made people cry before because shes so demanding of visuals. She asked someone before ""why are you even a visual?"" if she askes me that I'll straight up say ""because I was told i'd be an assistant manager and somehow that mysteriously fell thru, so you get back with ME."". I don't mind what I do, I just find the unnessisary bullshit that Val feeds me and critiques us on to be wrong. Everyone in the store can see my distaste for her. And I go out of my way to play around with her and not take myself seriously and enjoy myself. Which I can see she thoroughly can't fucking stand. Thats right, I get my work done AND enjoy myself, my associates and customers. Sod off.

Val supposedly asked Gina if I was elligable for a raise because I make only EIGHT DOLLARS/8.00 an hour, and visuals START OFF making NINE/9.00 an hour. Apparently I need to WAIT SIX fucking months to get a raise. Okay, if I am a visual in 6 months, something is pretty fucking wrong, and I will NOT remain a visual for 8 dollars. I am (un)officially looking for a possible new job. How does H&M pay? I don't care if I am full time, no one can fucking live on 8 dollars an hour. I am not in high school, I am in the real fucking world in a bad economy. I am not playing fashionista, I am doing my damn hardest. If Gina thinks ""so highly of you (me)"" then why fuck me over? Prove you think highly of me, pay me more. I mean, you can't even give me FIFTY CENTS MORE?

I really need a good break from this. And this weekend will be it. I am sooo anxious for it. I can't wait to do a mini road trip and pick Angela up from Toledo. Google maps has the option of seeing the turns and streets and its adorable. Reminds me of like Northville and such. Easy drive, less than a hour. Then i'll spend the whole day having a BLAST. Ahhhh! I can't wait to meet her! I hope she has a fun time. We're going to take a ton of pictures to narrate the day and our adventures. Heres to a good time! I am borrowing a bit of money from my mom (who offered, of course) for the weekend. She was really nice to offer, considering I am dead broke right now. Also Angela is helping pay for a lot, which is so sweet and considerate of her. :) I will definitely repay her and when I visit her neck of the woods soon after will do my share of making it rain.

I am like a big box of feelin's. Howdyado!

Also, I hope work is fine tomorrow. I had a very relaxed weekend, despite missing the Legendary Pink Dots show (don't one of you douches mention it to me, I know it was great) that I can say I enjoyed. I was offered the position as assistant manager by Kelly in Dearborn. This, of course, means nothing unless Gina approves of it, which she bettr, or else i'll be seriously pissed. Its not that I don't like being viusal, I mean, its fine, I don't love it or hate it, its the epitome of ""Its a job"", but the benefits of being an assist in Dearborn are far greater.

*Better pay!
*Closer!
*I like Fairlane Mall better than 12 Oaks
*I like the clientel more in Dearborn 
*More opportunities and responsibilites which I think I am ready for
*Cheaper relocation benefits (Detroit, Dearborn, Redford, Livonia, Allen Park, etc)

Please, don't fuck me over Gina, I'd love this."

"event","Okay, first off, thanks for being soooo considerate to my situation. I mean, its not like i'd expect you to be concerned, worried, or you know...care about how shitty of hole I am in. It always surprises me how apathetic you are. It must be nice not to worry about anything at all. 

Work and this week in general went by soo fast. I am so happy and can't believe its over already. It seems like Tuesday was just yesterday. I'm not entirely pleased with my check because of missing a week of work. 264 dollars...how nice. That'll last nicely. It has to anyways, I am seeing Angela on the 1st of November. Perhaps it'll all come together nicely. I can't wait to hang out with her. It'll be fun to show her a great time in Detroit, Ferndale and Royal Oak. Show her all of my favourite cities and places in MI. I really am holding out to go to Ferndale record hunting until she arrives. Also i'm looking forward to introducing her to Alex. He'll like her, so it'll be fun. We'll all have fun. :) I countdown the days. 

Today at work was pretty fun actually. Val was gone, so the relief of having someone hovering over me critiquing my work was not a problme. Me and Kayla still got a lot of work done, and finished our sections and stocked. I met this super adorable and neat girl, Sam, who has a fantastic taste in music and books. She loves William S Burroughs, Beat poets, and pretty good bands like Interpol, Joy Division, ADULT, Klaxons (okay, some good bands). haha. ALSO, I met our new stock guy, Travis. Hes very cool, post-punk guy, really into Animal Collective and electro. Reeks of patchouli oil, but a down dude. We talked of going to the CAID sometime for a show. I see us becoming good friends, I hope. 

Tomorrow Elizabeth is having her Halloween party. Hopefully its cool, it generally is. It'll fun to catch up on old friends from High school and just relax a bit. Take my mind off of problems and worries. Like it matters though, amirite?

"event","Now that I am feeling a lot better, despite having missed two days off work, I can now update this thing with current events. 

So the Martial Canterel concert was splendid. The CAID is such a neat place, always amazes me how that little hub for culture sits on the epicentre of the Detroit Riots. Me and Elizabeth arrived to find a the whole Wierd records crew there. I met DJ Pieter, who is the owner of Wierd Records, what a nice guy. We chatted a bit about Belleville/Detroit techno, Blacklist, and coldwave. Also I bought a copy of Xeno and Oaklanders CD as well as Refudge Underneath by Martial Canterel. If I had a shit ton of money i'd have gotten the whole Wierd collection. The four album complilations...ooh one day! Too bad they are an arm and a leg. 

The first band, Demons was a really neat live electronics band from Detroit thats on Wierd. I am usually not much for live electronics on album, but...erm, live it was pretty neat to see. Next up was Red Rot which was kind of a half assed militant Throbbing Gristle type deal. Following was Bad Party who were absolutely terrible! Shitty experimental punk whos lead singer was the biggest dick. Bad Party is right. Up next was Hive Mind who we went outside for. It sounded like the CAID was getting its carpet cleaned from the outside. Lame. 

Next was Martial Canterel who was a visual and auditory orgasm of minimal-wave. He worked so diligently with the synths and mixing boards, it was a great sight to watch. All together his set seemed very short, but maybe its because it was just so wonderful that it left you wanting more.

Despite a lot of sub par opening bands, the best part of the night was Pieter's DJing. Coldwave, minimal-wave, dark wave, etc. So many obscure things i'd never thought i'd hear in Detroit. I even requested The Cabinet by DAS KABINETTE which was played shortly after. Also hearing The Condos by IRON CURTAIN and Calling (MK II) by DEATH IN JUNE. Mmmm. I really wish I got to talk to all of the people dancing up a storm throughout the night. They seemed really neat. 

The following night I got to catch F'ke Blood and Benny Stoofy at Smalls. I was hoping to meet Sara there, however she didn't make it. So I went solo. It was kind of lame, but Benny Stoofy was great live. I really really respect them as musicians, they always seem to put on a great show. All of their songs played at Smalls were insturmentals though, which was kind of disappointing. But still, they are so talented. F'ke Blood was fantastic. Dion has great stage presence, very enthused, and funny. Steve, the singer, is super flamboyant and fun as well. Also the red head in the band is super adorable. Mmm. hehehe. 

So then I wake up the next day with the terrible upper respitory infection that I have now. Its getting better, but ugh...I go back tomorrow though. Thankfully. 

This Friday I am going to catch 800beloved/Deastro/School of Seven Bells. Who wants to go with me?"

"event","What a week!

Day four into being a visual at Forever 21. I really enjoy it so far; it has many challenges as well as rewards. The mannqeuins are absolutely dreadful and heavy as hell. Not to mention a drag to dress. We have to learn all of the mannequins names corresponding with their positions. Bea, Enuis, Coral, Stella, etc. Lots of outdated names. haha. It takes on average about 45 minutes to do a mannequin. Some are a lot easier than others, however they all really suck to dress. They give us time limits to, which I find are never met, to dress them and have them up on the table and ready. I am so afraid of dropping, and or breaking them. haha. But I am finally glad to be full time, and have a higher position. The day goes by very slowly at first, but once you peak the half way mark, it speeds up and gets by. Usually 8 hours a day the least. Its nice. I work AT LEAST 37 hours a week, which is very fair. 

Today really blew. We had were sent to Fairlane Mall (ah, fond memories...how I miss it) to help their Forever do go-backs today from their fitting room. OBVIOUSLY they haven't been doing them for the past few weeks because there was 26 RACKS stuffed full with clothes. How the fuck did this happen? Were were there for 10 hours today sorting and putting back clothes. There was so many that they were falling off of the racks. The district manager, Gina (who seems to just love me, thank god) was there and didn't seem to be bothered by it. I would be so furious with the managers for letting this happen. That was completely unacceptable. My feet are raw and full of blisters from walking and being on my feet contiously today. I so would love to just relax and not get up for a day. I could also go for some hot sexin' too. I am full of built up sexual tension. Working at Forever 21 doesn't help. Ah, smokin' hot indie/art-fag girls. My one true vice. The little short, skinny ones who are all awkward and fashionably backwards. Oh i'd like to Of their Montreal, put my Arcade in their Fire, put my penis in their vagina. Ya know...

At any rate, tomorrow is Friday, which means my weekend is CLEAR. Good thing about being visual is your weekends are almost always free. Tomorrow night is the WIERD RECORDS party at the CAID. I look forward to seeing Martial Canterel very much so. Elizabeth might go along, which will be fun hopefully. I hope she has a good time, you really never can tell. She doesn't really get excited for...things. Me on the otherhand, I adore them and look up to them greatly. The other bands, whom I am somewhat mostly unfamilar with, seem alright and promising. I hope the turn out is very well, I want more Wierd bands to come to Detroit. Such a fine label. Saturday is the F'ke Blood and Benny Stoofy concert. Should be a hootin' tootin' good time. I hope I can get a bunch of people to do. Chris HOPEFULLY *NUDGE NUDGE* will be at the Wierd show tomorrow, and perhaps F'ke Blood. Sara should be at both, and whoever else shows up to either i'm interested in meeting. 

Forever 21's music is slightly less better than Heritage's. But I heard THE HORRORS in Heritagr when I went to visit. A rough demo of Death at the Chapel, aka, Full Moon (Demo) was the song. I was so fucking surprised. I mean, I know the Horrors are being well known and respected, but THAT big? Jeez.

Still....how about that Neils Children full length CD?

And better yet, 800Beloved. Release your album, conflabbit! I know you google your names, so Justin demands it, Sean. <3

Last night was a super thrilling phone conversation. Liek omg! Very fun and exhausting. hehe. I loved it. 

And following that I had some very messed up dreams. As in, I had a dream that I worked some retail job (how fitting) and I got shot because of there being a shoot out in the mall (also somewhat fitting) It didn't hurt, but looked bloody awful. 

I decided I never want to get shot. That would be very uncool.

"event","Its time to decide what is more important. Both options suck in one way or another. One sucks even more, yet is the smarter option. I always really want to write an autobiography of my life, despite it not being....that interesting. However, I find it amusing that most of the inner conflict, outer conflict, and general drama came in my late teens, rather than early. Its somewhat better I think, I am more wise and less naive now. I mean, I am still naive. But we all are in growing up. I have a web of things i've done in my near past that I thought was the right decision, but now to think about it, it might not've been. I think I learned that either way, I did what I did and learned from the outcome. If you rush to one thing because you think its better it might be - it might not. It might be for a while, or seem like it is, but then you realize its not as pleasent as you thought it once was. Its a harkening reminder that perhaps don't jump to one thing because it seems better...it might just not be. This goes for a lot of things. 

Or maybe not everytime will be like that. Maybe sometimes the thing you think is better really is better. But there is always the possibility that it isn't. I got this new philosophy book that I need to read about more. I think it'd make me feel a lot better and more clear about the future and life in general. 2008 has been such a cross roads in my life, and each month it grows worse. I think this year has made me into such a stronger person mentally. I have felt so many different things, done so many different things, and don't regreat a lot of it. Some of the stuff makes me go I can't believe I did that, or I can't believe I didn't do that, or why am I saying this? What am I getting myself into? What aren't I getting myself into. 

I use to think when the question ""Where do yourself in _____ years/months/days?"" came up I could answer it fairly easily. However, nowadays I can honestly say ""I have no idea, hopefully somewhere happier and more content then now"". I can't keep kicking myself for the things I did, the way I feel, the place I am, because it got me to where I am now. Thats fine. 

But other people really confuse me sometimes. Especially close friends. Some of them crave attention in weird ways. Others are so inept to normality that its really weird. Have you ever talked to someone who is so blissfully (albeit, ignorantly) unaware of how fucking weird they are that it makes you feel awkward for being normal? Its really sad. 

However, it isn't all bad I suppose. I got a promotion at work to be visual merchendiser/manager for Forever21 in Novi. I am happy about that, despite the long drive once again. As well as working with only womens clothes, and a totally unfamilar style than I am use to. I do favour the Forever21 style to the Heritage, but I will certainly miss Dearborn. Fairlane Mall is a gem; a diamond in the rough. I sinerely mean it. Before I began working there I thought ""this is going to be terrible, this ghetto shit mall"" But on the contrary, its actually quite fabulous. I have never met such a real picture of people shopping. People who understand budget, people who are real middle class and lower middle class. People I can relate to. Twelve Oaks has such a hoity toity clientel that it makes me sick. ""Mommy, lets go to Hollister next"" after getting 80 bucks spent on them on fucking t-shirts. But hey, a promotion, you can't beat it. And full time with benefits eventually...this is nice.


I need to save up, I have a lot on my plate that i'd like to do. Especially the F'ke Blood, Benny Stoofy, Childbite, and STNNNG show. I know that'll be fantastic. Also Angela visiting, that will be a lot of fun. Her and I will probably mix really well. She can meet my friends while shes here and hopefully we all get along. Shes a really nice friend to have. She seems very interested in my daily business, and I can hold a conversation with her for hours on end. Its rare to find a genuine character for me, it appears. So a nice change. Hooray for good friends!


But I gotta be up early. I shall update this...eventually soon enough.

"event","Last night was the Chrome/Helios Creed at the Crofoot in Pontiac. Now that was an interesting drive. I live in Belleville, so there is unfortunately no easy way to hop up to Pontiac. I took 696 to Ochrard Lake Rd and Orchard Lake Rd all of the way to downtown Pontiac. Talk about a run down small little city. It was roughly slightly bigger than downtown Ypsilanti, and actually looked a lot like Ypsilanti. I got there a little after 7 (always get to these things too early) so I walked around, then drove down Woodward, too a piss, and got something to drink. Once the doors opened I got inside and shortly after Sara and my friend Steve from Saline showed up. We chatted a bit about and once we got to A Certain Ratio Chris and Anton showed up - and talked about A Certain Ratio. I demand more whistles in music, son!

We all sat around and watched the first act, FASHION, which was kind of disappointing live. I heard their demos on myspace, and was somewhat impressed. Neat stuff. However, the live performance was lacking, and the obvious nervous/awkward lead singer made for a so so experience. I think they have potential, however. Perhaps a difference singer, as rude as it sounds, I just wasn't feeling it. 

Chrome then came up, and we all gathered 'round waiting for an abstract filled experimental performance. It was, in actuality, more straight forward punk. It had an uneasy feeling of ""we just reformed, lets see what we can do"". Helios Creed looked how I thought he would; drugged out, aged, and 'been there, made that'. The rest of the band was so strange as well. Young douchey bassist, redneck guitarist, and rockstar drummer. All in all, hearing In a Dream, March of the Chrome police, as well as other gems were nice. Too bad listening to such great music in CD/Vinyl over the years got my hopes up.


Now the Homosexuals...that performance has got to be good. But lets see. Upcoming might be These Are Powers. However, I after getting my car fixed I am slightly tight on money. So might have to pass that up. Deerhoof/Experimental Dental School, and best yet...on October 11th at Smalls, Hamtramck....

"event","Life has been funny lately, very funny. Maybe funky is the word. I have across a lot of cross roads in the past, and they only keep coming. I guess its part of growing up. Its not just one cross road, its a lot. Many different types of them as well. In the end, only I can make the right decision that was meant to be. 

I hope next week at work I have a hefty amount of hours, and many people quit and/or are fired. Overstaffing is lame. We need Dr. Killinger in here, he knows how to deal with overstaffing. Let them full time hours pour, damnit. I need to save up cos soon I will be having a small get together with some friends. My friend Angela is coming up from Kent, OH to visit in Michigan. I'm going to show her around Metro/Detroit and see all of the neat local things we have to offer. Fabulous Ferndale, Royal Joke, Briming-With-Ham, And the Dirty D. I want Alex to join us in the evening and in Birmingham so she can meet him. Also We can all have a night on the town, club hopping and trying to find culture. I will find you, yes I will. The of course crash at a nice cheap moetel/hotel. We were going to stay at the Leland Inn, however its 21+ check in. I found a very affordable one in Dearborn that is not only 18+, but isn't far away. Hooray!

With me working so much, most of my friends living car away and me trying to save gas/money, and Elizabeth being so caught up in school. I got nuttin' to do when I am free. Its kind of lame. However, tomorrow I will probably catch Japanther and Deastro at the Trumbullplex. Should be fun. 

Paid Friday. Lets hope it doesn't fuck up my Christmas too bad."

I keep thinking about people I know and the way everything has changed. The ways I have changed. The fact I don't use my apartment enough. LOL (I guess the last one is kind of random) For once in my life things  seem kind of perfect. It is weird and  a little scary. I think I realized the other day how happy i am in love. This time it just feels different than before with any other person. The scare part is thinking of everyone in my past and how easy it is for things to end and change. I don't think we will break up but for the first time in my life I am scared to death of losing him. I feel psychotic. LOL I even had a nightmare last night about losing him and it freaked me out. WOW I sound like a crazy person. It sort of just hit me the other day. I was sitting on the couch talking to him when I thought wow he is my best friend and my boyfriend, and I don't know what i would do without him. I mean I have had guys who were boyfriends before and I have had boyfriend that were more of a best friend than a boyfriend but never the perfect mixture I have now. Ok i guess I am going to sleep now that I have made everyone think I am the cheesiest person ever."

"event","All my life I have been concerned about my future. Probably mostly because of my upbringing. Will I get in to college? When will I finish? Every detail of my life I try to plan out. Is it possible for me to STOP it all and just live in the moment. Can I not worry about the future and if I am doing the right thing? I don't know. I have always been taught to worry about the future, to plan ahead, no surprises but am I forgetting to be happy now? I think if I worry about the future I am going to miss what is in front of me, it is just I don't know how not to think about that stuff."

Well on to my upcoming events... I am at home( as in the parents house) and tomorrow I plan on sleeping until my mom has yell at least 10 time for me to get out of the bed (or threatens to take me to the hospital AGAIN because she thinks I am dying because I won't get up). Then do absolutely nothing!!! Thursday is turkey day! yeah for food. I am going to eat 3 time and probably not move the rest of the night or weekend because of it. 

Well I hope everyone else has a great THANKSGIVING. oh yeah and don't forget to be thankful for everything great that has happened to you. Sit down one day and count ""all your many blessings"" and think WOW i am blessed. Someone loves me, I have a house, a dog, friends, the money to get an education, and family! How lucky am I.... AND as you think about ""all your many blessing"" remember to say a little pray (or whatever you do) to all the people less fortunate than us because we are truly blessed!"

Which brings me to tell you about my exciting end of the semester vacation. (YEAH for end of the semester coming soon.... AND YEAH for vacations) Well I am going to gatlinburg with Danny. We are staying in a cute little cabin, and I am going to sleep late everyday.:) 


Thank God for wonderful teachers who know that students that try really hard deserve help sometimes in moments of despair. Right now I could hug my physics teacher for doing so much to help me. Oh and I found out that my chemistry teacher grades on a different scale it is something like 65-76 is a C and 75- 88 is a B and 89- 100 is an A.  So maybe my grade will be ok in there too. However remember there is a reason he grades that way. 

So overall I have decided that my mom was right. Things always look better the next day. So thanks to everyone who said a  prayer for me, I still need them, and thanks to the best mom in the world for prayer constantly for me everyday of my life. It is so nice to feel loved:)"

I was over prepare and I was sure that I had studied more than anyone else,  but I got the test and freaked out. I don't really understand what happened because I was sure I knew it all. I just froze and tried to hard I guess. I am really scared about this semester. It just hasn't been the best for me. The sad part is that I am really trying and I am doing worst than people who don't try at all. It makes me really upset. I don't know what to do. I really want to get into med school and I am not going to get in if my GPA keeps dropping. I just really need everyones prayer because I have cried more and been more upset this semester than any semester before. I am just having a really hard time in physics .... aka if anyone wants to help me or tutor me I will be more than glad to pay them because I am desperate. I just really want to past this class and get it over with, and I could use some help in Chemistry too. I think I get the chemistry I am just struggling because my physics is taking up so much of my time. I need help and I need lots of prayer that I don't have a nervous breakdown at the age of 19."

"event","So have you ever took a hot bubble bath alone and read a book. It is wonderful except for the dog who wants to come in the bathroom with you. It was really nice to have some me time and pamper myself.  I think that is the problem with most college kids, they don't ever get to do something for themselves.  The only thing about taking a bubble bath and getting out and getting ready for bed is that it makes you feel really lonely when you don't have someone to snuggle with.  I am usually not a snuggley person except when I really like someone.  I guess that is one of the ways I know I like someone is if I just want to snuggle up next to them and take a nap.  Naps are great they make me feel like an old person who need his or her nap during the day, but that wouldn't be so bad. To be an old person that takes nap during the day. Well anyways my mushy thought for the day."

I have just let everyone have it that has been causing me all this stress. At first last night I was upset but now I feel much more relieved.

I have come to find out that people are selfish but what makes me even more pissed is when they are like sorry i screwed everything up but I did what I thought was best for everyone and I love you all. That is the most pathetic thing ever. When you do something to benefit yourself don't pretend you were trying to help everyone and do what was best for the group.

He is so sweet and absolutely perfect in every was that imperfection can be just perfect.  This time I am so comfortable around him.  For the first time we are truely able to be ourselves without fear of the other one becoming grossed out by our habits.  I am really excited about this new but old relationship......
Speaking of old relationships, one of my exs sent me the weirdest text message saying basically he could no longer talk to me ever again because of his girlfriend.  It was really weird but I believe that it will truely help me to forget about him and not hold on to any part of him.  We had our good time and our bad times but it is all behind me now. I never really had a problem letting go of him but it seems I have just recently let it set in, but I believe our break up is for the best. 
Now about school... SO this past semester was not my best ever. It seems that I stayed sick all the time and almost broke my neck, but I am just glad that it is over. I know need to work harder than ever to have the best grades ever and to try to get as much experience as possible in the medical field so that I will get into med school. I hope to start reading some books on the mcats and learning things to help me complete my dream to become a doctor. I have this passion that I cannot really explain about being a doctor. I know that I would wake up every morning excited about my job and that it is something I would want to do no matter what i have to do to get there. The only things right now in my life that I miss are my best friend back home Elizabeth and my mom, we had the best walks together, but I would miss my mom no matter what. I am such a mommy's baby.  Oh and before I forget Kristin and I have our new apartment I am so happy. She is a great roommate and friend. We are going to have so much fun. I feel all grown up living out of the dorms."

 You were my partner in crime. I've made out in the back of your car(s) with various unnamed individuals. I've lied with you and in spite of you. We are a dynamic duo and I think that we could take over the world with enough petroleum and motivation. You are my favorite person to go out dancing with and to sunbathe with. You laugh at all my jokes and take me seriously when it counts. You never judged me for that chicken wings and Moulin Rogue night or the serious lack of showers. You let me live and explore and covered my butt more times than either of us can possibly remember. You protected my perfect reputation without fail, but you ALWAYS knew truths that no one else ever dreamt of believing. We've had tons of fun. We're growing apart, but I cannot forget. We've cried, laughed, complained, traveled, partied, and puked together. I have no idea how we became friends, but it's been a seriously fantastic trip. What more can I say without bringing up tag-team dating or our Disney channel friend?

I could never meet her skill to write but all I really have to say now it that i will never forget our time together and even though we are growing apart I will still miss her incredible. To the best friend I could ever have."

Now this girl is someone everyone was making fun of and I tried to stand up for her in the past. Now I could honestly careless if people talk about her because if you don't want people to call you an ugly fat whore then don't play the part. Now this quy has the nerves to call me up the day before my birthday(after he had went home with the girl) and ask if he could take me out to eat. I was like NO. He is all the time trying to get someone here at the dorm to check him in to stay the night. All of the people at the dorms are  like ""Hell NO"" and they come ask me and other people that know him how he got there number because now they think he is just as nasty as the girl. So my thought of the day if you want people to respect you and like you, be respectable. If you don't go sleep with someone that already has a bad reputation. You will then have a bad rep too and possible a STD."

If you aren't you complain about how everyone had it better than you. Tonight I actually had someone tell me that one thing that bothered him about me was that we were different.  We were different because my mom was still supporting me for the most part while I am in college. The other day I said something about my mom putting money in my bank for me and that just really freaked him out. I was like what the heck. I am sorry my parents love me?! NOT. I mean give me a break what do people want me to do. Disown my parent and make my life a lot harder on myself. Sorry everyone I love my mom she loves me.

"event","It is amazing to me how quickly I change my mind. One day I will love being single and the next I am so lonely. Being single isn't easy. I don't ever know how to feel. I think I have grown out of the flirting stage and dating games. I am just not into that anymore. I don't want to play hard to get, and I don't want to enjoy a chase. It isn't fun. Your mind is running crazy wanting to know and you don't. It is actually very depressing. I like being honest. I like knowing how someone feels for me and if someone likes me. If someone doesn't like me I wish they would just not flirt. It hurts to get your hopes up and then realize you have been chasing a dream. Somehow you will never be pretty enough or smart enough or just have that perfect laugh that drives every guy crazy. I want someone to understand me and respect me. I don't want to just make out or be flirty, I want much more. I want passion, caring, understanding, and a friendship that is stronger than any other.  I don't think it is fair that I never get a chance. It seems like if a guy is ever interested in me by the time I find out or start to like him he has found someone new. What happened to the waiting period to give you time to recover. I don't understand the world today and maybe I just never will. I have learned though that it is better to be brave and sorry than to just be sorry and I have learned that I will survive. If I stay at home by myself on Friday night I will be ok. I don't have to have someone; it is nice, but I will keep living with or without it. God will choose my path for me and when he does it will be better than I could ever imagine. So I need to remember to pray. God will listen and he does care!"

"event","Everyone always has this idea of a sorority girl as a easy home run but they are so wrong. I work hard. I volunteer and have to keep my grades high. Plus with all the meeting and community service we do, who has time for guys. Now to the positive side. I have been having so much fun this weekend getting gifts from my big sis. I can't wait to find out who she is. Plus, thursday night was squeal night and all the frat boys had to get us gifts too. I really like being in a sorority. I have someone to listen to me when I complain or give me advice on guys. Plus, I know that I am welcome at all times. Some people say you are just buying your friends, but it isn't true. Your sisters do thing for you because they are your friend. All the sorority does is give you a chance to meet these awesome people.
Off of the sorority stuff I have to talk about my awesome and wonderful roommate Kristen. She has become like a best friend. We are always together acting goofy. We are actually planning on rooming together next year too. I have missed my friends back home though. I miss Elizabeth my best friend from high school and tina and erica. I also sorta miss my family but I am completely happy at school and it is so much fun making my own rules for once and being independent."

"event","So, it is finally the weekend. After attending some great fraternity parties last night and sleeping until noon, I get to come see the puppy of my dreams. He is a black cocker spaniel. He also lives with the greatest person ever. He lives with Danny in  Chattanooga. Even though he is a spoiled brat, I am sure the puppy will manage (JK). Anyways, I have to admit even though he thinks I am a his chew toy , and he craps and pees everywhere, I am still completely in love with him. ( Oh did you think I was talking about the puppy) hehe. Well I am so glad I have the weekend to just chill out for a little while. Tomorrow I get to go home to Jasper. Monday we are having a big family thing for labor day. The best part of labor day is NO SCHOOL."

"event","For some insane reason I decided to sign up for a class at 8 a.m. Silly me! I forgot that people who live on campus never sleep. I have been so tired all week. So I now try to take naps between classes to be able to catch up on lost sleep.  I am actually able to lie down on my bed because I did my laundry. I was excepted into the Honors Program here at UAH, and I am going through recruitment. Oh, I can't forget I am applying for SGA and finally got an on campus job. Plus, I can't miss out on all the fun night activities that are going on this week like the foam party , the luau, and the outcast game show. WOW, no wonder I am tired. I am also really hungry because I never have time to eat. The school came up with this awesome ideal to make all freshman put 800 dollars on a meal plan. I am sure they don't want anyone to starve. The only problem is that the cafeteria is only open at certain hours of the day. Luck for me I have class or work at the hours it is open. So, I now have 800 dollars I can't use. Well at least the school is having a cook out and a dive in movie tonight. I will finally be able to eat. Plus, I get to watch 50 first dates while swimming around in the pool at the fitness center. You can't beat that!"

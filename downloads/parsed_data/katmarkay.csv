We are off to Tuscaloosa for the rest of the day.&nbsp; Poor Shane will be in Alabama town having to work, while the game will be being played just miles away!!&nbsp; Doesn't bother me, I am an Auburn Fan, and the girls and I will be shopping.&nbsp; I think the shopping will be more satisfying than rooting for Auburn today.&nbsp; Don't get me wrong, I love my tigers, I would just LOVE to see both AL and AU have a good season at the same time.
Have a great day everybody!"

"event","I know I've been saying I'd update for six months now, well here's a quicky.
I was finally catching up about the time that Joe passed away. That is so terribly sad.  Even though I 
don't really know them, their family has been in my prayers.
About that time, my Grandfather got sick and was in the hospital for about two months.  I spent a lot of that time helping my Grandmother, getting her back and forth to the hospital and what not.
Sadly, my Grandfather passed away last week.  I am glad he isn't suffering anymore, but it's still sad.  His funeral was last Friday.  It was a traditional Irish/Catholic wake.  It was nice and it was followed by what's best described as a party.  It was fitting for him to be buried on St. Patricks Day.  The party was complete with green beer and Irish folk singing.  Shane even sang Danny Boy at the graveside.  Overall for such a sad occasion, everything went well.  But...yesterday there was an unexpected death in our family--so we have another funeral this Friday.  My teenage cousins have lost both of their grandads within a week, :(  So keep them in your prayers please.
Now that I have made everybody sad...
The girls are all doing well.  They are glad to be out of school.  Shane is doing well.  Working like crazy.  He starts a contract with a local sign company this week.  Which will keep him from having to go out of town so much.
I can't wait to see pictures Tina.  I am so proud of you. I wish I could get motivated to excersize.  I am real motivated at making excuses for not!  Leah, your boys are getting so big.  Can't wait to hold Layton.  I am a sucker for little boys.  Guess, that's since I have three girls.
I'll try to update sooner next time."

"event","So updating once a month is acceptable-eh?
Now through Christmas is a crazy time around here.  Planning the AMSAR Hayride has basically consumed the last entire month of my family's time.  But it got started Friday night, and now that it's started, we can all breath again--for a minute anyway.  Things went well with it.  Friday night was more or less a dry run.  So many things weren't quite ready, so we didn't have the heart to charge anybody.  My poor hubby has worked so hard on this thing so it was kinda frustrating when on Friday the other members of AMSAR had barely done anything they were suppose to do.  It wouldn't have been so bad if for the last month we had not heard ""Oh yeah, I've got that, I'm bringing that, don't worry, taken care of"".  Anyway, Saturday was much better.  Even with the fair going on we had decent business.  And luckily Friday most of the people that came to ride were friends and family of the volunteers.  It was homecoming for Prattville and a couple of other local schools, so we didn't expect too much business.

Everyone around here is doing fine.  About two weeks ago the kids all took turn getting their fall colds,sinus infections and asthma attacks and hopefully that is all over with now.  I will be watching Riley today since he is sick and can't go to school--just pray that he doesn't pass it along.

The girls all got their report cards since last post.  Kayleigh got all As and Kate got As and Bs.  Which is great in my book, especially since she is in a private school and is doing the same work as Kayleigh (who is a grade ahead of her in public school).  Marley even got a great report.  Since she is in K-3 she didn't get ""grades"" but in all areas she was doing ""exceptionally well"".  They also sent a little evaluation on what was expected for them to learn by the end of the year and it is stuff she knew before she started. (i.e. Recognize all letters of the alphabet and numbers 1-15).  Not only can she recognize them, she can write them too.  She can also spell so many words.  She really loves school and to learn.  I feel very lucky in that area with my kids.  Okay, have I bragged enough??  Can you tell I am proud of my girls?  Don't get me wrong, they aren't perfect.  I would gladly take a B or two from Kayleigh in exchange for a little less ""I am a teenager and know everything"" attitude.  Overall they are pretty great kids though.

I hope everybody else is doing well.  Maybe it won't be a month before my next post.  Probably will though Marley's teacher asked me to be room mom and my first job is to plan Wild West Day/Fall Carnival for all 5 kindergarten classes--so send any suggestions my way, I am not used to being in charge!!"

"event","So I am a little slow on updating.  Okay maybe a LOT slow on updating, but hey, I'm doing it now.  I'd say not much has been going on since my last update, but that is obviously not true or else I would have had time to update.  Things have been pretty busy with the girls and school.  Marley cheered at her 1st pep rally and football game last Friday.  It's been difficult trying to convince her that she is three, not sixteen.  She did really well.  Since we are at a very small private school, our football games are played with only 8 men on the field.  So the cheerleaders and pep squad tripled the number of players.  It was a lot of fun.  Katelynn had her 1st soccer game on Saturday.  We played the team that we have came in 2nd to for the last 3 seasons.  We tied 0-0.  So frustrating. Our teams are really evenly matched and we always beat them at least once per season.  Kayleigh has been back riding her horse everyday again since it hasn't been so hot.  She's hoping to get to show her some this year.
Kayleigh is in the 8th grade and Kate is in the 7th and can you believe Marley has homework more often then the two of them put together.  But that's just as well, she still enjoys it.  It looks like she's going to follow in their footsteps with the school thing, and that's fine by me.  My teachers would be shocked to see that I have children who not only stay on the honor roll, but love school.  We did have an incident with Kayleigh a couple of weeks ago.  She came home from a friends with an extra hole in her ear.  Her reasoning was ""well you did it when you were my age"".  My response ""are you going to do everything I did??""  Not to mention, I would have gladly taken her to someone have her ear pierced a second time.  My mom wouldn't take me, so well let's just say I didn't stop at one extra hole, I put three in by myself, and it HURT.  I made her take it out and grounded her for a week and reminded myself that I should put a limit to the stories I share with my kids until they are at least 18.
I have started a change drive with our city parks and rec to help aid Katrina victims and am now confused as to which organization to donate it to.  I want to be sure that it goes to one that REALLY needs it, so any suggestions?????
I'm going to tuck some kids in and snuggle with the man in my bed."

I am sure she will catch everyone up to speed when her power is back on.  Just wanted to let everyone know she was okay.
Things here are still fine and calm here, tornadoes are popping up in counties all around us.  Got a little hectic around 12:30 when schools announced they were closing at 1:00 and I couldn't decide which daughter to get first.  I ended up just checking them out.  Then forgot that we usually pick up one of Kayleigh's friends so I had to go back and look for her.  After 30 minutes, we found out that she got on her bus when she couldn't find us.  OOOOOPS.
Not much else is up.  When the weather gets crazy around here, the whole world stops spinning."

"event","Good Morning!
Just back from the school run.  I had 3 to go to today.  One of them is only a block away so I can't fuss much about that one.  We had our first soccer practice yesterday.  Katelynn plays and Shane coaches.  Guess what that makes me??  Yep, team mom.  I have tried to let other parents do it, but as the coaches wife, everyone comes to me anyway.  And I am also a little bit of a control freak and we have been doing the soccer thing for 8 years, so I am kinda stuck in doing things my way.  This was the first season I didn't have to buy new cleats.  That's amazing.  All we needed was shorts and socks.  A ball too, we moved up a bracket so she now uses a size 5.  Shane has been having to work at night and him being here just really messes with my schedule.  He's sleeping so I could just pretend he's not here, but it just doesn't work that way.  I could wake him up and take advantage of nobody else being home.  Hey that's a good idea.  I can count on one hand how many times we have had the house to ourselves in the last three years.
Why am I on the computer????  I'll get back to everybody later."

So, just read Leah's entry.  I will say that even though everybody there but me have been friends for years, I did not feel out of place or left out one little bit.  They are all awesome. I have hung out with Tina and Chris many times and knew that they were awesome.  But, I had only met Jessica and Leah a couple of times.  Now I know that they are awesome too.  I guess awesome is my new favorite word.  Maybe I should find a thesaurus.  It was so much fun and so much needed.  We need to make a point to do it more often.  I promise the hayride won't be so bad guys--Shane will NOT be driving then.  Unless of course Leah needs him to hurry her labor or something like that.  The pictures are awesome Leah.  She is so talented!!!!!!  BTW Shane is trying to get in touch with you.  We are thinking of having a media night the night before the hayride starts, anyway, something about taking pictures while riding around on the four-wheeler.
Saturday night was so much fun that I don't need to complain about being in a car for 12 hours yesterday.  YAE!  But I do still feel angry at Nextel.  I think it is time to call them again."

"event","I have been released.  Kayleigh has granted me computer privileges again.
Aside from school and soccer starting, we have also started planning for AMSAR'S Haunted Hayride.  Shane is the ""event coordinator"".  So anybody reading that's in this neck of the woods and have nothing to do for the month of October, let me know.  Tina if you can think of anybody around here that might be interested in helping, please tell me.  I have been basically in charge of recruiting volunteers.  That was our biggest problem last year.  Everybody wanted to help...until it was time. We had mostly teenagers.  It still went really well.  Even with the minimal planning, hardly any advertising and it being the first year, we still had a pretty good profit.
We had a lot of fun.  Scaring people is a blast.  One of the fields being haunted and Shane being ran over by the trailer on the last night kinda sucked.  But he's ready to go back at it.  Tina and Jessica, if you guys are in town any of the last 3 weekends of Oct. let us know and we'll get you guys some tickets.
Marley is doing much better at school this week.  She loves it now.  Which is a big relief, even though it does hurt my feelings when she tells me ""Guess what??  I didn't cry or miss you today.""  But I am proud of her.  She is excited to go to the Treasure box tomorrow.  Personally, I think that is what keeps her going all week."

"event","Okay, so I'm a few days behind.  School starting back has been challenging for me.  Marley cried all day her first day.  So did I.  She is doing a little better each day.  I was so surprised, because all summer all she has wanted to do was go to school.  Katelynn is liking her new school.  She is in a very small class.  She compares it to her Sunday school class.  Kayleigh is enjoying being at the top of the food chain at the junior high.  I am working on getting her scheduled changed.  She is in all honors classes except for Algebra.  I am assuming it is an oversight.  She had a high ""A"" average last year in pre-algebra, so it doesn't really make sense for her to be in a regular math class. I'm not trying to be ""my child is too good for that"".  I just know her and if she isn't challenged and becomes bored, she will become very lazy.  We sent a letter today to hopefully get it changed.  
Every thing else is going well.  Katelynn had her post surgery check-up and is totally healed.  She is so excited.  She can ride her go-cart again.
Hope everyone is well.
Here is the horribly sad poem Marley's teacher gave us as we were leaving Monday:

The First Day

I gave you a little wink and a smile
As you entered my room today.
For I know how hard it is to leave
And know your child must stay.
You've been with her for three years now
And have been a loving guide,
But now, alas, the time has come
To leave her at my side.
Just know that as you drive away
And tears down your cheeks may flow
I'll love her as I would my own
And help her learn and grow.
For as a parent, I too know
How quickly the years do pass
Because I've also had my turn
to take my child to class.
So please put your mind to ease
And cry those tears no more
For I will love her and take her in 
When you leave her at my door.

Isn't that just the meanest thing.  And to think, she is such a sweet lady."

"event","The girls and I just got back from visiting a long time friend of mine(Beth).  We have been friends for 25 years (yes, I'm old enough to have a friend for that long).  She's always been more like a big sister or 2nd mom to me.  She's only a year older, but...she has always been there to pick up pieces for me.  Until I met Shane there were a lot of pieces.  Anyway, the last two years have been rough for me and Beth .  We just aren't as close as we used to be.  It makes me sad.  We live less than 10 miles from each other, but I don't know.  Things are different and I just don't know what to do to fix them.  It stinks because our kids are all close to the same age and love to hang out.  For awhile our families hung out almost everyday, then something happened, not exactly sure what.  Her mom passed away and her husband, well let's just say he has issues.  Maybe that's what it is.  Our roles have reversed and I am totally happy and she has pieces to be picked up.  I just don't know how, she has always been the strong one.  I try to be there for her, but I think she has a hard time letting me.  
    Anyway, I am done whining.  Other that all that, today has been good and productive.  The girls did some before-school-starts cleaning in their rooms.  It is always refreshing to load up the truck with stuff going to Goodwill.  
    Hope everyone has had a good night and sleeps well."

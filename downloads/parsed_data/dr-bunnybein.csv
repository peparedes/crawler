"event","Okay. I've been neglecting the jogging lately.

Damn! Since I spent very much money on a gadget last night I vowed not to unpack it until I manage to jog every day for nearly 4 weeks now. Namely, till the 27th of March.

But my work in the hospital has left me scarred. Breathing in disinfectant vapours all day can't be good for you. I suspect that's the reason why I was totally out of breath today and it feels like a lot of phlegm is caught up in my respiratory system.
But I did go out jogging today. And I plan to do the same tomorrow. But for now, I need sleep."

"event","Didn't manage to go jogging yesterday.
a) my legs hurt like hell
b) I had my first day of my internship at a hospital
c) my body got kind of angry at me for getting him some nice breakfast but neglecting food after that and I came home and felt totally sick. I even raced to the bathroom twice or so, fearing food poisoning, but since only bile came up... well.

So, but I do work about 8h a day now for the next 6,5w (with 2 weekends off...) in a early-late-early shift schedule. Hence I doubt that I'll go jogging today either, but then I'll be racing around like an idiot taking some meds here, getting some folders from there..."

"event","I joked about hoping that real life sports were just like in the Sims 2 where it was easier getting fit again when you had some body points to begin with.
Seems like real life isn't too far from that I was just out jogging, feeling not too happy about going but pushing myself anyway. Turns out it was fun (apart from ym sore thighs) and my body remembered how to pace me/herself and I could run half of the round in about 15 min. Yesterday I did about 2/3 to 3/4 of that half in 9 minutes and *had* to stop because I was totally out of breath.

Ah, I love the weather outside. Cool air, the snow crunching under my feet, even the burning in my thighs sometimes felt good. <3

Oh, and another thing. I used to get problems with my joints before I'd get sore muscles. Used to. Haven't got any problems with my knees or anything, just sore muscles. Yay!"

"event","... yeah. Last time I tried I failed like woah, but I'll give this another shot.

Beginning 2009-07-27 I'll be on a 4 week seminar and until then I have to get back in shape. Actually, it's a great ultimatum for me to follow up to.

I started jogging again, today, and it felt even somewhat good. I hope that soon I'll be able to jog at a decent pace without all the suffering. Well, that's what I work up to.

You heard it, 5 months, 6 days.

I'll have a shower, some protein shake and then probably call it a night.

<i>Tipps'n'Tricks:
Sports stimulate your whole metabolism, so if you want your body to process some things quickly (e.g. protein for muscles, minerals...), eat them after sports.
Give it half an hour though, because especially minerals are often sweated out if taken directly.
On the other hand, avoid ""bad"" food after sports. Eating sugary or carbon hydrate rich foods after sports will just give your body the impression that there is no need to burn fat. More on that later, maybe...</i>"

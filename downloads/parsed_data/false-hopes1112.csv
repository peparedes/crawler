"event","i havent written in a while...i kinda just got caught up with my xanga...im not really into the whole lj thing...but its cool...someone persuaded me to start writing in here again...
       yesterday...i went to school...blah...then rob picked up me eddy miguel and this chick linda and we met up with zack at my house...it was a party...there was like 7 people in the garage...charles came too...then i was with jamie and charles while waiting for amy to come over...she brought her little brother so fabe could teach him to skate...so me amy and ryan walked over to fabes house and then to the park...on the way there there was this group of kids...all little boys abou tlike 14 to 15 years old...they started talking shit...whistling...shit like that...amy got really scared...it was funny...amy and i came back to my house and we ate...and then me joey amy ryan fabe and rick were in the garage...then they all left...it was a good day...
       one thing that i knew was going to happen was that fabe was going to like amy...i even told rick that...they other thing ive come to realize is now that i introduced fabe to amy hes going to call her...he calls her more than me where before he called me more then her...it doesnt really bother me that they like eachother...ive been down that road before and we didnt get far...so im not going to waste my time on someone who doesnt want a relationship with me...but it just makes me feel like he doesnt really have to bother with me anymore now that he has amy...i dont know how to explain it...but o well shit happens...it happens to people everyday....some people take it differently then others...you just have to learn to cope with it...
       i saw her yesterday...i had so much fun just talking to her...i wanted to kiss her right there and then but there was to many people around....and plus im afraid if i do she might turn away or something and i wil be rejected...
       well im off...im gonna go party and finish up my physics homework thats due tomorrow...im gonna have fun today...supposed to be hanging out with joey...i dont know what im going to do after though...prolly just work on my paper...even though i have all weekend....

i had to go to francis today...clean out my locker...saw some people i really didnt want to see and saw some people im really going to miss...funny thing jasmina was all like  i didnt know you had a xanga...and i thought maybe she herad what had happened with my old one and i was like ""how the hell do you know""  she was like i was looking on my computer and saw yours so i gave her my new name...hopefully shell comment...

well i was at amys online and this chick imed me told me her name was tammy and that she went to brooks but she doesnt know amy...i thought that was weird...everyone i know who goes to brooks knows amy...anywho...well she imed me again later on when i was at home and i asked what her xanga name was...and she was like i have to tell you the truth...and i was like ok...and she told me her name wasnt tammy and that she didnt go to brooks...i got really scared and thought that whoever it was was going to bust out with ""i gave your xanga in bitch""...well to my surprise she didnt but she did tell me she goes to francios and her bf is lewis so thats when i knew who it was...i never really talked to her in school but she said she noticed me around and i was like o...i was kinda freaked out because i was thinking maybe she was stalking me or something but then i remembered how i met jose and how long i noticed him before i actually talked to him and i thought...hey maybe me and this chick can be friends or something...dont worry i dont think shes weird anymore and i dont think shes stalking me either...so its ok...

nick and kyle are on their way over all of us and amy are going to go to the movies to see hide and seek...im so excited...its a scary movie...well its supposed to be...we are going to get the tickets early and then either hang out at the mall or go to jims...dont know yet...i just hope if we go to jims that everything will be ok because i really dont feel like talking about anything...im in a good mood right now and i dont want it to be ruined...

i started going to my neww classes and as i walked into art 1 yesterday i noticed i wasnt the only upper classmen there...he walked in and i noticed him but i didnt rreally look at him...but when i went to go sit down i noticed jose sitting at the table kiddy corner from me...i was like ""great""...i talk to him and what not but tony said that hes an asshole...i dont believe him and i dont think jocse is an asshole...but i think the only reaso he thinks that is because he hurt me...i know that wasnt his intentions but shit happens...

i feel bad...johns gf broke up  with him and he came to talk to me about it...i knew form the begining that he had a gf so i didnt bother with him...i mean id talk to him but i saw him as just a friend...but now that she broke up with him i think he thinks he has a chance...but he doesnt...im supposed to practice honesty for theology...and honestly i dont like him...im content being his friend but he always brings things up like ""ive liked you for so long"" and ""can i have a kiss oin the cheek""...it makes me very uncomfortable...and sometimes i wish he would leave me alone...but wishes dont come true and i dont have the balls to tell him i dont like him...so im stuck in this situation...

well yesterday i smoked with jamie and charles...i was extremely high...and then nick came over and we watched eurotrip...i fell asleep...i was really tired...and then nick left...i then was screaming at my mom because she should me a side of her i never thought i would see...but lets just say...im not doing it make things harder on her...im doing it for me...its my life...and my happiness...no one can stop me now...im happy and like jose said its about time and he right it is about time...the only sad part is him leaving..."

i dont undersatnd somethings...if im so beautiful and pretty...then why do people insist on waiting to tell me...i would really like it if people would start letting me in on these things...i mean...i hear it all the time but its from parents and friends...and for the past few days ive been told im beautiful and that im really pretty and that everyone wants me but they felt this way for a long time and are now just telling me...if i knew then what i know now...id be happy...alot happier...

well im at jimmys now and im doing nothing...i fell alseep for a bit and it was really hard for me to wake up...i kept hearing people walk up and down the stairs but i couldnt open my eyes...i was getting scared...but then i just got up and found my way upstairs...

im very proud of myself...as much as i love smoking the past few days i havent been doing it...yesterday i smoked a little bit and today nothing at all...im not feeling well though...i know why but im not going to say it here...you all will think its all in my head...but im extremely proud of myself because ive only had 3 cigarettes since new years...i  glad im trying to quit its a bad habbit...

"event","-a geart love?
  its when you shed tears for him but still you care for him...its when he ignored you but you still longed for him...its when ho startsvto love another and yet you manage a smile and find the courage to say ""im happy for you""

-i may seldom tell you how much you mean to me...oi may not be able to reach you because maybe we are both busy but in spite of all this i want oyu to know that i really love you...

-just wondering would you smile if i smiled at you?..would you say hello if i greeted you?..would you talk to me if i talked to you?..would you add the word ""too"" if i said ""i love you?""

i have the words to say it
but icould never say it to you
distance kills as lives do
and sadky you dont care
if you only knew 
how i adore you
your dark shining eyes
your fuzzy brown hair
that goofy smile
if you only knew
how i adore you
your gentle touch
your subtle nidge
that way you held my hand
if you only knew
how i adore you
your frequent denial
your sudden silence
that game you seem to play
if you only knew
how i dispise you
youll notice me one moment
youll ignore me the next
it hurts me so
when i dont know
what i am to you
if you only knew
how i despise you
so please tell me
please let mr know
if you dont care
ill try to let go
if you only knew how i adore you"

"event","turns out francis didnt have school today...jason said they were there for like 10 mins and then got to go home...but what sucks is that they used yesterday and today as my suspension days and im not sure whats going to happen because of the snow day...so i hope i can go to school tomorrow to make my mother proud...

i want to smoke i have some weed but i dont know if i can smoke it yet...its half nicks...i should call him...but i think its too early...im not sure if he has work or not so i dont know if i should...he told kyle who told allie that me and him are going out...thats news to me...i have no clue whats going on...id like to know but im not going to be a bother by asking him everytime i see him i asked him once and i got no reply so maybe i should just keep quiet and let things just take its way..."

it saddens me to say that the past few days were really fucked up...hectic and miserable...things were said that really hurt but im sure i said hurtful things back...but does it matter...no...i know how he feels and vice versa...

i also feel angered by the decision one has made...is it right?  what purpose does it serve you?  are you happy?  thats all that matters is that your happy...because im not and from the looks of it...i never will...

I'm in my own little world now doing whatever i please and you...you cant stop me at all...im nicer and lovelier then youll ever be just know that...just know that...

today i got suspended from school...for the gayest reason ever...i didnt serve a saturday...and then my mom kept ranting and raving about school and how shes disappointed in me and all the good stuff...she mentioned it to allie and then they talked about it...i told her to shut up and that she talked to much...

kyle and nick came over and we watched tv and smoked like usual...then i was making hot chocalate when he imed me and said ""is everyone talking shit about me now over there?""  i was like no because we werent...i finally told him what i was going to say and then apologized for it...i still stand by what i said but what i said about her i was out of line...

mondays suck...tuesdays suck...wednesday is the middle of the week...thursday sucks...the weekend baby!!!!
it rocks my world..."

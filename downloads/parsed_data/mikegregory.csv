Yeah the drama never ends
The doctors say that
It's too late but I'm still waiting
I love the way you conquer style
I love how children lack your vision
I love the way you're smothered
Suffocation
Leave it alone

Yeah the drama never ends
But now it's time you learn:
Baby, We're whores
Nothing less and nothing more."

"event","I hate when people say gay shit like ""well, it's time to update this thing!  wow it's been forever!!  LIKE WOAHH!!!""

So i'm going to start today's boring blather off with
    holler shit its done been foreva sinc uhh updated dis thang.

now for the body of the message (that was the introduction in case you missed it).  there are 4 types of bodies to choose for this message.  body 

a.)  you can give them like, one sentence and have the readers try to GUESS what's going on in Neil's life.  This can leave the audience extraordinarily confused, because you may get comments from Nate, saying ""wtf"" or perhaps compliments from jenny saying ""sorry i didn't call you back this weekend, i was super swamped,"" or even terry tellin you ""what does this even mean Neil?""

b.)  you could give them a nice standard size body, letting everyone know how you're doing, how your life is, what you're listening to, who you've been hanging out with...you know, THE NORM.  the boring ass message that you read and hold a knife to your throat saying if he doesn't infict pain on himself for writing this then i will double mine for reading it, because somebody has to feel for this.

c.)  you could give them the SONG LYRIC.  this can come in a number of different forms.  the indie kids quote a line, maybe even only a phrase.  the emos quote a verse or two, or a chorus, etc, and they like to HIGHLIGHT and make the words FeEl ThE eMoTiOnS.  the country girls like to quote the whole song.  because surely that part about doin the watermelon crawl means something to you.  seriously, i'm sure it does, that's why it's sad.

d.)  you get the 3 page long bitch note that cindy wrote after she found out fred was pulling out of her and cumming on her dog, that he cheated on her with a horse and he killed 19 babes in a 3 month span.  she just feels the need to let the world know about all the times that he was so shitty to you girlfriend, and you were nothin but right the whole time.  you were so right about him girlfriend.  i hope you burn in hell wherever you are pig fucker fred.

so i think we'll choose b to go along with the gangstuhhhh theme we established on the introduction.

   yo sup nigs, shits ite up in here.  life is good fo dat money uny uny.  i been pumpin dat new fiddy cent thru da alpines.  we been chillin wit ll cool j for the past minute, and this fool knows how ta treat a bitch.  he been teachin me.

so now to the conclusion.  you have several options once again here:

a.)  quick exit.  g2g bye!  talk to me soon!  call me!  any amount of this bullshit is acceptable.  even if you have 40 lines of it it's still a quick exit because nobody could read it regardless.

b.)  action exit.  explaining that you have something else going on that you have to attend to.

c.)  dramatic fashion.

i think we'll choose b once again to fit into the ghetto superstar mode of my message.

  so uhhh, bitches been callin me and teddy keeps pagin, so i gotta rush to the max to go pick at nigga up b'foe da pussy get stale.  pimp me up on the ceellll fooone.

That is my blog entry.  I hope we all learned that no matter size shape color or anything else you can still write like a yeti."

"event","I am sitting on my couch watching the Notre Dame and USC game on NBC.  I am in shock, I swear it.  How ridiculous is it that 80,000 catholics can gather into this stadium and create the most uncomfortable atmosphere possible in the history of history?  That grass is SO fucking green, and mix in their 11 guys and their 80,000 belligerent fans, and it's like the visiting team is going head to head with the lord.  Watching it on TV is even MORE creepy, because NBC (National Broadcasting for Catholics) are clearly all trying to hide their bias because they're supposed to be apathetic when you're broadcasting something nationally.  But the announcers get noticeably happier when Notre Dame converts that 3rd and 1, and you can hear the cork pop when Brady Quinn throws a touchdown pass.  It's like the whole world throws a nazi salute at that exact instant.  Literally everyone involved with the production of this game and its being nationally televised are clearly avid Notre Dame, uhh, people.

Notre Dame home football games are a giant conspiracy and EVERYONE is involved.  Except the visiting team, of course.  Obviously the fans, the press, the announcers, the referees...basically everyone is against you.  It's like a giant death trap.  Creepy."

"event","Just bits and pieces of the greatest song ever written.

The sun is always in my eyes,
It crashes through the windows, And I'm sleeping on the couch,
When I came to visit you,
That's when I knew, That I could never have you,
I knew that before you did,
Still I'm the one who's stupid,
And there's this burning, Like there's always been,
I've never been so alone, And I've never been so alive.

Visions of you on a motorcycle drive by,
The cigarette ash flies in your eyes, And you don't mind,
you smile,
And say the world doesn't fit with you.
I don't believe you, You're so serene.
Careening through the universe, Your axis on a tilt, You're guiltless and free,
I hope you take a piece of me with you,
And there's things I would like to do that you don't believe in,
I would like to build something, Buy you'll never see it happen,
And there's this burning, Like there's always been,
I've never been so alone, And I've,
I've never been so alive.

I'll get over you, you'll wonder, who I am.
And there's this burning, Just like there's always been,
I've never been so alone, and I've,
I've never been so alive.

I go home to the coast. It starts to rain, 
I paddle out on the water, alone,
Taste the salt and taste the pain. I'm not thinking of you again,
Summer dies and swells rise,
The sun goes down in my eyes,
See this rolling wave,
Darkly coming to take me home,

And I never been so alone, And I've never been so alive."

"event","i am bored out of my mind so i decided to write.  i wish i would have gone to the football game - but to do that i'd need money and someone to go with.  both of those created a problem for me -- especially the money because i would have needed that before i could have found someone to go with.  i think i've been in a writer's block or something lately.

i'm reading this cool book, the cydonia codex, and it's about the face(s) on mars.  it's pretty entertaining at this point, but i'm not very far into it so we'll see how it goes.

i hate reading people's entries that are so pointless like this, but lots of people write them, so i'm going to bore the fuck out of you, just like others do to me.

i honestly have nothing of importance to write about.  and that's pretty sad.

love,
mike"

I'd tell everyone to go out and buy it now, but unless you live on the other side of the ocean that's not quite possible.  So let me know if you want it...it is INCREDIBLE."

Kimya Dawson (www.kimyadawson.com) come up with a great idea to donate music to the people who have been devastated by Katrina, and are stranded at the Astrodome. There is a team of kids in the area who have organized and are taking donations of CD's, tapes, headphones, walkmans, discmans, boom boxes, etc and giving them to the affected teens that have been put into new schools.

From Kimya herself:
""so please, go through your music collections and your closets and find things that are collecting dust. so many of us have upgraded our music players and lost interest in things we used to listen to. i think it would be okay to donate burned cds and mixtapes too. ask your friends to donate stuff. ask local stores to donate stuff. maybe you don't have a cd player but maybe you could spare $10 to send a gift card. ask bands you know to donate some of their albums. ask record labels to make donations.

i can't imagine being a teenager and going through tough times without my music.

and i am just imagining having my cat die without listening to sting. or being too shy to talk to ed without being able to listen to debbie gibson. or being pissed off about having to clean my room without having a suicidal tendencies cd to throw stuff around to. or driving around aimlessly without the violent femmes. or ending a fight with my brother without blasting metallica.

imagine losing your home, all of your possessions, and members of your family, some of your friends...and just sitting in a strange place. being told you can't go back AT LEAST for 2 months, but maybe FOREVER.

it might help a little to put on some headphones and escape.""

Please send donations to:
Sheila Jozami

and:
Daniel Hyde Schexnaydre

Daniel is a student at Baton Rouge high school who has gotten 300 new students in the past week. You can also contact him at starsandlemonade@hotmail.com.

Please, if you have things to give, there are people in need. If you have spare time and blank CD's, make a few copies of a mix CD and put them in the mail. I'm sure that these people would rather have a little bit of something."

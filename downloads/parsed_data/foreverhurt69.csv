"event","yeah dude, so I found out that Steve joined the Coast Guard. And he's suppossedly moving to California. I cried. I cried a lot. I don't want him to go. Because, if he goes, then I finally have to realize that it's over, and it's never going to changed. I'm going to have to realize that he's never going to be in my life again, and I'll probably never see him for the rest of my life. It's scary, and it's sad, but most of all it hurts. You know, I've held on to the feeling for so long that there is some slight possibility that we may get back together, and now that he's leaving, there's no way that would ever happen now. Not like it was anyways, but still you know? But then again, it could be a good thing that he's leaving. Maybe now that he's leaving, and now that that's forcing me to get over him, I can actually move on and keep a steady boyfriend. I don't know, all of this sounds stupid. But whatever.

So it seems to me, that I'm starting to get back into my old ways. Most of this weekend I just smoked. All night Saturday, all night Sunday, and some of Monday morning I smoked. Saturday I smoked so much that when I layed down to go to bed, I was spinning. I was spinning so fast that I felt like i was going to fall off the bed. I don't know though, I guess we'll just see what happens from here. Maybe I'll start to change again, or maybe I'll just continue to fall back down into the old me where all I do when I'm not at school or work is smoke and drink. But whatever. Whatever happens, happens."

"event","It's really quite strange. After second semester started, something about me changed. I'm happy. I've been happy. I mean, yeah I sitll get upset and really really angry and loose my temper, but I've been happy a lot and not depressed or sad 24/7 like usual. I like being happy, but it just feels weird, I guess because I'm not used to it. 

And I've been getting along with people, with the exception of the whole fight with Ashley and Cindy. But other than that, I've been getting along with lots of other people, I talk to people I normally wouldn't, I socialize with people in my classes, and the people that I know I don't get along with I stay away from. 

The other thing is that I havn't found myself talking about other people as much. Despite the fact that there are people at my school who think I am talking about them, I'm not. I just don't see the point in it anymore. I don't like when people talk about me, so why should I talk about them? It's really not my place to say anything about other people. I'm not saying I never do it, because I do, but I don't do it as much as I usually do. Also, we were talking about this last night at work and I even mentioned that most of the time (or at least I try) when I talk about other people, it's also about me. If I'm involved I don't care talking about what's going on, especially if someone asks me about it. There's no point in bringing other people into my drama, or talking about other people's drama unless I'm involved or they're involved. And even when I do talk about my own fights and drama that I'm dealing with, I don't go on about the other person alone unless I'm involved for that part as well. And in all honesty, I think I've been doing pretty good with this.

Something else that's very strange about me now is that I'm actually doing kind of good in school. I've brought up both of the F's I had and report cards, and I'm just participating more in my classes. I mean yeah, my test and quizzes are still mostly low grades, at least for the classes I was doing bad in, but they're gradually starting to get better. There's only one class that I'm failing right now, and that's World History. I don't know why I'm doing so bad in that class, I was doing amazing in that class at the begining of the year, and now I'm not. I guess it's cuz I just don't like that class. But at the same time I do like that class, I don't know. Some parts of it are interesting to me and other's aren't. But it's probably like that with most people in most classes. And my teachers have been calling and e-mailing my parents saying how good I've been doing and that they're impressed and they've noticed a change in how I've been acting and participating in class and everything. That's weird just because usually when my teacher's call it's because I'm in trouble or I'm failing or I have detention or I'm not turning in my work or something. So it's kind of shocking knowing that they're calling for good reasons now instead of the usual bad reasons. Hey, maybe I won't have to go to Summer School after all.

I really wonder why I've changed so much within the past month or so. Well, maybe no really changed, like I know my personality is the same, I mean I'm still a bitch and I still have a bad attitude and anger problems, but I'm happy. Like truly happy. I havn't been faking my happiness like I used to do everyday, I've really been excited and in a good mood. I know it's a good thing, and it probably shouldn't, but it scares me. It only scares me because I'm not used to it, and I couldn't tell you when the last time I was honestly happy and not faking anything about it. 

I have a feeling that it probably won't last though. So I think I'm just going to take advantage of the fact that I've been this way and show that I'm happy as often as possible before I go back to my old ways. 

Well, that's all for now, I'll probably write again later...

Peace*Out"

It was awesome. I had a great day for the most part, and I got to see my bestest friend in the whole wide world!!! Then Lauren and Bobby came over for dinner and then we went and spent the rest of the day in Westminster. It was fun.

Awww, it was sooo sweet. Last night at like 10:00, Joey came to my house with a red rose, a box of chocolates, a balloon, and a card for my Birthday. He left it on my front poorch and was going to wait until like 12:00 or so to call me to tell me Happy Birthday and to go look outside my front door. But, just after he left the stuff there, my dog started barking and ruined the surprise. But that's okay because I got to see him and say thank you in person. I think it was the sweetest thing anyone has ever done for me for my birthday. After the rose starts to die, I'm gonna tape it to my wall, and after the cand's gone, I'm gonna put the box in my memory box to keep it. Joey's such a sweet guy.

But I think that's all I have to say tonight. Good*night everyone..."

"event","So apparantly I'm doing so bad in school right now that I might not pass, or I'll have to go to summer school. The only problem with that is 1. I have to pay for the classes myself, and 2. I won't be able to work like at all so I will have no money to go towards a car, or the insurance, or my cell phone, or even college for that matter. But wait, that's right, I forgot, the way I'm going I'm probably never going to get into college. Oops.

Okay, this may be boring, but in Creative Writing one day for our daily journal entry, our teacher had us write about everything that really pisses us off, and since I'm in a pissed off mood now, I think I'll make a new list of what pisses me off. Sorry if it bores you, but maybe if you think about some of the things they might start to piss you off too.

My parents piss me off. My family in general piss me off. When people stand in the middle of the hallway at school just to talk pisses me off. When freshman like to walk next to each other in long lines taking up the whole hallway pisses me off. Teachers piss me off. Other students at school piss me off. How everyone likes to run their mouths pisses me off. How everyone feels they have to be exactly like their friends to fit in pisses me off. People that try too hard piss me off. People that think they're better than everyone else piss me off. People who say they are your friends and then go and say shit about you behind your back piss me off. People who think they can tell me what to do piss me off. Society pisses me off. The fact that people take advantage of you any chance they get piss me off. 

But probably the number one thing that pisses me off is when people label me as a slut, or a druggy, or a poser, or a goth, or a badass, or a rebel. That pisses me off because I never once have done or said anything to make me seem like one of those types of people. Okay, so I died my hair black, OMG that means I'm gothic and I want to kill myself and go to hell and I worship the devil! so what, does that mean if I go to dye my hair blonde does that mean I'm a superficial preppy girl who thinks the world revolves around me and I'm perfect in every way? and so I've smoked pot before, I don't do it every day of my life and I couldn't tell you when the last time I smoked was. And so most of the guys I've dated are or were big on drugs, that doesn't mean I am too, did you ever stop to think that maybe the reason we're not together anymore is because of the drugs? I'm still a virgin and have never done anything with a guy below the waist, and that may be a shocker for some, probably most of you, but it's the truth, so I can't be a slut. So I may dress differently one day then I did the day before because I like different styles, most of which my friends don't like, so that doesn't really make me a poser now does it. And yes, I'm a bitch and I have a bad attitude, but have I ever once gotten into a fight or said that I was a badass. No, I havn't so I'm not a badass either. And as for being a rebel? When did I EVER say I was a rebel and I did rebellious things? NEVER. That's when. So get it all out of your heads. I'm not anything, and I don't understand why people want to try to label me as something I'm not.

Most of the labeling probably comes from all the rumors that people spread about me. Which also pisses me off, why would you want to waste your time talking about other people making shit up to make their lives miserable when they didn't do shit to you. It doesn't make sense. And the funny thing is, (I may be hipocritical here but whatever)I've noticed that the people that do talk shit are the people are preppy and think that they're God's gift to earth and talk about themselves a lot. Maybe that's it, maybe they talk about other people because they ran out of things to say about themselves. And they continue to talk about other people until they have something ""interesting"" about themselves that they can tell people. Until they've told everyone that is, then they talk about people again. It's like a huge vicious cyle that never ends. The one thing I have to say to those people are, get over yourselves, and do something even a litte but productive with your lives instead of wasting it trying to ruin other peoples lives. Because eventually, it's gonna happen to you.

But whatever, I have a lot of homework to do from when I was sick.

Peace*out"

"event","I'm tired of working, I'm tired of my school, I'm tired of doing the same thing every day of my life, I'm tired of always failing at everything I do, I'm tired of my family, I'm tired of feeling lonely, I'm tired of being alone, I'm tired of this house, I'm tired of this county, and mostly I'm just tired of life in general.

I'm tired of everything...

It just all seems to get so much worse. with every step that I take it seems to get darker, not brighter. 

But the worst part of it all is the fact that everything that happens in my life makes me feel dumber and dumber with each passing day. It just makes me really want to give up...

Completley give up...

Maybe I will just give up. I can give up on myself, yet at the same time really try to bring my grades up in school and stuff to prove to myself that I can do it. 

I'll give up on everything else, like I can give up on doing the same thing all the time, I can give up trying to be happy, I can give up on any hope I may have of actually finding someone to care about me, I can give up on trying to make other people happy by doing what they want me to do or tell me to do.

I'm sick of it. I'm sick of feeling like I need to wear what my friends wear or do what my friends do to fit in. What's the point? People always tell us to be our own person and people are always saying that they are there own person, but then you stop and look at everyone around, and they're just like their friends. It's kind of disgusting when you think about it. So I give up on that. If my friends don't like me for wanting to do my own thing or being who I want to be then they can kiss my ass. I'm not going to change just for them. I'm sorry, but I'm just tired of it. I don't want to fit in with people by their standards, I'll fit in with people by my own standards. And if that leaves me with no friends, then that's my problem.

You know, I really really can't wait until I'm 18 now. I just want to get up and move out of this house so bad. I can't take much more of the fighting. It's killing me. And I hate it. I just want it to stop and if that means moving out of here when I turn 18 then so be it. I have no problem with that. The funny thing is, my parents think my brother is going to leave and never come back or keep in touch when he moves out, but the way things are going, that's going to be me, not him.

But whatever, I've had a bad day, again...so I'm gonna go lay down and try and sleep...Maybe I'll have a good dream that will make me happy..."

"event","Marty called my house last weekend and 4:30 in the morning. I wasn't home, but my mom told me the next day. She wasn't too happy. She asked how old he was and that kind of stuff and I told her he was 19 (I only lied by like 2 years so it's not that bad) the funniest part about it though, was that he called drunk. I was trying so hard not to laugh when my mom told me.

I've actually heard from him and talked to him more then I thought I would. It's kind of funny actually. I thought he was just going to blow me off and everything, but he hasn't yet. Which is pretty cool I guess.

My parents and I actually got into a huge fight like 2 weeks ago. I pretty much told them everything that they knew was true but didn't want to admit to it. I was screaming at them, saying things like ""your entire life revolves around Nick, that's all you ever talk about and you're letting it run your lives."" so of course my dad had to retaliate with ""you obviously don't understand how close we were to loosing him, you don't get it."" and I was like ""Actually, I do. If I didn't then I wouldn't have cried my eyes out the day it happened, I wouldn't have sat in school with tears rolling down my eyes, I wouldn't cry even now when I think about it, and I definatley wouldn't have stayed in his room the whole 6 months he was gone. Just because I don't let it run my life like you let it run yours doesn't mean I don't understand."" and then my dad didn't say anything. Then I got in my mom's face about how she told me that she thinks that I am the way I am because her and my dad don't pay attention to me, and I told her I agree that they don't pay attention to me, but that's not why I act this way. I told her I could pretty much care less if they never talked to me again. 

The whole time Kevin was in the living room listening to us fight. Then when I walked out of the room he started laughing and giving me praises. 

Everything I said to them are things that I've always wanted to say but never had enough guts to say, or not had the oppertunity. It felt good to get it all out.

They didn't say anything to me the next day about it. We havn't talked about the fight at all. Which, to me, makes me think that they know every little thing I said was true. And they know it, I know it, and both my brothers know it. 

But yeah, I'm gonna go, I might try and sleep more before I go out this afternoon. If I'm not snowed in at least...

I mean this party was like probably 2 months ago and I havn't heard from him or talked to him or seen him or anything since that night, and now out of no where he just calls me? But he did apologize for not ever calling me. He said it was because of the age thing.

I don't know how to feel about it though. I mean, Nicole did get mad at me that night because of certain actions. But I don't know. 

I've had the chills and been shaking ever since I picked up the phone and he told me it was him. And that was almost an hour ago.

Somebody please tell me why I can't write something about someone that makes me happy because I had a good day without everyone else saying shit about it. It really pisses me off. 

I can't wait until high school is over now. I mean, I used to be scared because I was scared that I would never talk to any of my friends any more, and going into what seems like a whole new world not knowing a single soul, which is absolutley terrifying. But now, I could care less if I ever talk to anybody I went to school with again. And I mean it. But it's only because people run their mouths. Even people I thought were my closest friends.

But wait, I forgot, I don't have any friends anymore. That's right, I don't because I'm a fucking slut and a worthless bitch. Oops. Oh well, guess who doesn't care anymore. ME!

oh, and for the record....

          THERE IS NOTHING FUCKING GOING ON BETWEEN ME AND TYLER

So to all of you who like to run their mouths, and say shit and make me seem like some psycho stalker, you can stop because there's nothing to say or talk about. 

That reminds me, I should probably just give up on him. Based on a conversation I had with him last night I figure there's no point anymore. I understand that him and Kasey just broke up, but still I finally realize that I'm sick and tired of waiting around for him. It's just a waste of my time. 

Even though I've been the happiest these past two days than I have in two years, ever since me and Steve started dating. But now it's all screwed up. And both, my happiness and sadness have been caused by him.

So maybe, I should just stick with Devan. Either that or give up completley. But all I'm asking for is someone to care about me. Someone who can make me so happy that I forget about everything else. But I guess that's just too much for me to ask for...

Nothing else matters. And I love being around him because we can joke around. Like we can say things about how stupid I was for breaking up with him and it doesn't matter. I don't take offense to it whereas with other guys I would. But then again, Tyler's different from other guys. I don't know how or why, but he just is. But it's a good different and I love that about him. And also, I'm not scared to be myself around him. I can act normal and crazy and everything and he wouldn't care. It's like when I'm with him I finally know how to relax, and I can't relax when I'm with anyone else like that. Especially if I like that person because I'm always trying to impress them, but I don't have to do that with Tyler. And I absolutley love that feeling.


I don't know what to do though. I mean with Devan. I do like him, but I don't want to hurt Tyler again. So I think I'm going to tell Devan that if something's going to happen then it has to happen soon before I get too carried away with Tyler. But how am I suppossed to say that to him? I can't just be like so yeah, my ex-boyfriend and his girlfriend broke up and if something doesn't happen between us soon then I'm probably gonna try and get back together with him? I mean seriously, Tyler goes to my school and we have the same friends, what's Devan gonna think even if something doesn happen between us? Is he going to not trust me because he knows about Tyler and how we still keep in touch? I mean, how am I suppossed to explain this to him. Either of them for that matter. I mean I can't just be like oh yeah Tyler, forget that I told you I still like you and I want to be with you because there's a guy that I've been fliriting with and talking to for the past month or so. I don't know what to do about it. I don't want to hurt either of them, but it's just so hard.

Sometimes I wonder what would have happened between us if we never broke up. I think we fought a lot, but that's okay too. It got hard though, when him and Judith were together, to see them with each other. But it got easier after a while. Which is always good.

He's a great guy. Really, I love being friends with him.  A lot of the time he know's how to cheer me up. I remember this one time after we broke up when I think I had gotten into a fight with my parents I called my cousin, and she was with Brandon, me and him were fighting at the time. I was crying really bad, and he stopped what he was doing to come see me to make sure I was okay. That made me feel better, to know that even though we were fighting he still wanted to make sure that I was okay. Needless to say we stopped fighting after that.



Aww, it was the cutest thing. This boy Chris in my French class bought me a Christmas gift. He got me candy canes and a card with snoopy on it that says ""If it snowed everytime I thought of you we'd have a really white Christmas"" and then he wrote me a little note in it. But the cutest part of the gift was the teddy bear he got me. It's soo cute. It's blue and pink and purple and it's really soft. I was really surprised when he gave it to me.

Other than that, there's Tyler. Him and Kasey broke up, which I do feel bad for him, but I can't help but feel the slightest bit of joy. I really did think I was finally over him. I mean we havn't talked all that much since him and Kasey started dating because she doesn't like me, and I really thought that helped the situation. But it didnt'. Now whenever I see him all these feelings I had for him come rushing back like they never left. And I don't know what to do or how to react. 

I don't want him thinking that I'm only talking to him and everything now because they broke up, because that's not true. Honestly, I've been kind of scared to talk to him when they were together. I don't know why, I just was.

Part of me doesn't want him to read this, but then the other half hopes he does. Just because I'm too scared to be able to tell him straight up. I wouldn't be able to explain it very well to his face. So then I guess I really do want him to see this. But whatever...

I'm gonna go, I wanna take a shower then go to bed. Good*night everyone...

Peace*out"

But yeah, so tonight at work this guy told me that I was a fucking slut. And that I present myself as a slut so it must me true. He said that I act completley different every day, and that if I ever want to start my life over then I'm going to have to move somewhere that no one knows me otherwise I'll be contintinued to be labled as a slut. It made me cry. Really bad. I almost walked out because of it. Because of him. 

Is that waht people really think about me? That I'm a slut? That I'm going no where with my life? All I want is the truth..."

"event","so yeah, Saturday was....fun, interesting, entertaining.

My friends had decided to give me a big surprise make-over before we went to one of our other friends party. They picked me up and took me to the store, I ended up buying $45.00 worth of make-up, hair dye, press on nails for the night, and some make-up brushes that I had never seen or heard of before in my entire life. Then we went back to Kristina's house. They tried to dye may hair a brown color, like my natural color. But it didn't work out too well because of my black hair, so then we bleached it, and dyed it again. Then, they cut it. I told them not too short, but they cut it to like the top of my shoulders. Actually, it was this girl Kasey who cut it, she's in cosmotology school right now. I didn't really like it at first, I guess because I wasn't used to it. But now I kind of do like it, it looks a lot healthier then it did before. Then, they gave me an outfit to wear to the party. And Mallory did my make up for me.  The sad part was, it all took 5 hours, and if you ask me, that's really kind of saying something.

When we showed up at Nicole's to help her set up, she didn't even recognize me when we were walking up her drive way. I'm not gonna forget the reaction she gave me. She like put her hand over her mouth and kind of jumped up and down some, and her eye's got really big, all this while she was screaming"" OMG!! You look so good! OMG!! I can't believe it, it's awesome..."" and she went on some...

But I'll tell you what happened at the party later, I gotta run right now, Val's coming to get me and I havn't seen her for a while...

Peace*out"

"event","You know what I really hate? I hate when you have a best friend, who promises that no matter what they'll be there. And then one day they up and move, and says they'll always keep in touch, yet every time you try and call they either ignore it or don't answer. And then of course they never call you. Even when you really need them because you feel like you have absolutley no one else in the whole world cares about you, or when you just need someone to vent to when everythings going wrong. But no, they don't feel like talking, they just want to move on with their lives and forget everyone else. Oh no, I'm sorry, not everyone else, just me. I mean, after all she still keeps in touch with the friends she made after she met me, the friends she's known since the end of last school year, the friends she's gotten into the most trouble with, the friends she's gotten in trouble with the cops with, but not me. Not the friend who was there when she thought that she had a very serious illness and thought she was going to die. Not the friend who helped her out everytime she got into a fight with her mom. Not the friend who let her come stay at her house when she ran away and had no where to go. Not the friend who for the most part kept her out of trouble. Not the friend who when we were into a huge fight because of somebody else wouldn't give up on trying to be friends again. And not the friend who no matter how many times she messed up or felt lonely was there and helped her out and listened to her whenever she needed it. Some best friend it turns out I have..."

"event","Today I was actually in a pretty decent mood. I mean there were the occasional bitchy moments I have, but what day goes by that I don't get that way?

I did have a rather long day at work however. That kind of put me into a bad mood, only because of this guy Wiley. No matter how mad he makes me, I can never stay mad at him for long. He knows just what to do or say to make me smile again. 

Sometimes I really hate that about him.

The other thing that made my night was that I got to see Nick. :) that always makes me feel better. I even got to talk to him for a little while despite that fact that we were so busy. Which is also a bounus. He's leaving next month though, on the 11th. I really didn't want to fall for him or get attached in the slightest way, but it didn't work out that way.

Oh well, I guess I'm used to it by now. The fact that whenever I start to fall for a guy they either turn out to not be who I thought they were, or something happens where they end up leaving for one thing or another.

In Nick's case, it's the air force. But I guess I'm better off because I have a feeling he's only in it to try and get laid. And I'm kind of scared of what he may do or say when I won't sleep with him. I mean, if I were him I wouldn't want to start anything this close to me leaving either. But I just don't want anything to happen that will screw up our friendship you know? He's a really good friend to me and I don't want to loose him.

But I guess I'm going to go to bed now. I'm very exhausted and I need to get some sleep so I'm in a kind of good mood when I go back to work tomorrow.

Good*night, and sweet dreams..."

"event","Yeah, so I was in a great mood today for the most part...at least up until my Survey class. This guy Mike really pissed me off, then he decided to talk about me behind my bad to one of my very good friends, not smart. So when I asked her what he said about me, she told me that he said that ""No one is that big of a bitch everyday so there's gotta be something wrong with her"" so then my friend told me that he was wrong, but I just had to let him know, and the whole class for that matter, and I just corrected her by saying ""oh, but I am that big of a bitch everyday, but there really isn't anything wrong with me"" so for all I care he can just go and kiss my ass, because I could really care less about what he has to say about me or anyone else for that matter.

A friend of mine, well I guess I can still call him a friend but I'm not too sure anymore, anyways, that's besides the point. I was talking to him on the phone one night and I told him how I felt about him, and then he said something to me that cheered me up because I then realized that other people are starting to realize that when I'm in a bad mood not to mess with me, and if I'm in a good mood not to make me mad. He told me that he really respects the fact that I always tell people how I feel about them, whether I like them, or I hate them, and that I don't let people walk all over me.

People call me a bitch all the time. The difference between me and them, however, is that I'll admit to it. But if someone were to call them a bitch or an asshole, they would take offense to it and get upset. See, I know I'm a bitch, but personally, I find that one of my best qualities. I'm not saying I always try to be, but if I wasn't a bitch at all then people would think they can say whatever they want about me and get away with it. Whereas, being the bitch that I am, I will go up to someone, for the most part, ask them what they said about me, and confront them about it. And I'm glad I've learned to do that.

But I'm going to go now. I have to get ready for work at hope that my parents will be home within the next 15 minutes to take me there so I don't get into trouble. But I really doubt that will happen, which will put me in even more of a bitchy mood. I'm gonna be a big bundle of joy to work with tonight!"

"event","Lately I've been feeling more depressed then ever, and it's starting to really make me angry. I don't know what to do about it though.

When I was at work last Sunday I was zoning out a lot since we weren't busy at all. My friend Devon was trying to make me feel better and he was trying to get me to calm down and not be so stressed out so he told me to look at him in his eyes, so I did, for a long time. And we just stood there for like 10 minutes looking at each other. Then out of no where he was just like ""You know what I think?"" and I was like ""What?"" and then he looked at me and said in a really serious voice but kind of quiet at the same time ""You just need someone to care about you because you don't have anyone, you just really need to find a guy to take care of you and be there for you because that's what would make you feel better."" and I was just in shock. I couldn't believe he said that to me, mostly because it's the truth, and I hate to admit to it because I don't want it to be true. So that's been on my mind ever since. When I asked him how he knew that he just told me it was because when you look into someone's eyes you can tell a lot about that person in terms of how they feel.

Then, just yesterday, I was in my Child Development class and my little kid wasn't there so I talked to my friend Kelly the whole time and I just vented to her. I told her everything that I've been holding inside of my for the past year and a half of my life. I didn't even mean to, it just all started coming out and I started crying so bad. I felt bad too because I hate just dumping my problems on my friends because then I feel like they feel they have to worry about me. And I hate that especially when they have their own problems to worry about and it's not fair on them.

That's the other thing, I hate to complain. Especially when I know other people have it a lot worse off then I do. I don't want to seem ungrateful for the things I have. I'm really lucky compared so many other people, and I know this. I mean, I'm glad I have my house, and the few friends I do have now, and that I can go to school and work, because there's tons of people who don't have any of those oppertunities, but I'm still sad.

The other thing I hate is that a lot of people think I act this way for attention, but I don't. Honestly, I could care less if I got any attention from anybody. I would probably be quite content about that. My parents are the same way, they think I've been acting this way because I want attention from them because their lives revolve around my younger brother (which it really does, I know, my older brother knows it, and they know it) but I could care less.

The kids at school always ask me if I'm high, and they all assume that I do drugs all the time. Which is a lie. I look that way because I taught myself to be happy around my friends. But the only thing that does it makes me laugh even when I don't want to. The only thing I havn't learned to make look happy are my eyes. They're always so dark and grumpy looking. That's what gives away my secret.

But I've written a lot tonight, and I'm starting to get tired. So I'm going to go and take a shower to try and relax, then do some homework I guess. So much for getting any sleep tonight, again..."

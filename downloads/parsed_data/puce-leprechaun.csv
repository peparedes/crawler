it is wet and mushy and conceals giant puddles of water.

its also very very dirty and when limos and cabs scream past you it splatters your lovely pants.

it also makes it very easy to fall over and then people laugh at you.

but it looks pretty at first...

in other news yesterday I saw wicked.  It was so fantastic, especially because I got such an excellent seat. I brought a restriced viewing seat because im a stingy person but then because of the blizzard some people didnt show up and I could subtly shuffle along to almost the centre of the row and considering I was in the second row it was a choice position!

Then sparky and I went for a romantic dinner to this pizza restuarant and our waiter is the props guy at the rocky horror picture show! Its one of the ones where the actors act in front of the movie and the audience gets all involved so he reserved the entire front row for us on saturday which is gonig to be fantastic!

Then after that we went to this Brazillian dance thing which was pretty fabbo as well.  It was especially good because it was free! Sparkys friend works at the theature so we can get free tickets!

Then I had frostbite of the toes and I suspected they where turning black so I headed home.

All in All it was a lovely day!

Now tonight im tossing up between going to see the 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee or the new hugh grant/ drew barrymore movie.  I think im going to delve the broadway rhelm because its still freezing and theres probably a bunch of cheap tickets left.

anyway this aggressive internet cafe is blinking manically at me so I must depart!

im coming home on wednesday so you should all start preparing yourselves and making banners for my welcoming commitee!"

"event","So I'm having an absolutely amazing time!

I've actually aclimatized to the weather which is rather unexpected and anything above -4 is just dandy!  

Last night there was snow which was so beautiful!  It started rather late at night so all the street lights illuminated it and it looked fantastic.  I was so excited I went for a little walk around the neighbourhood taking photos and being a tacky tourist and meet some wonderful new friends along the way!  Wandering around the streets alone in the middle of the night is definatly a good way to pick up.  One lovely gentleman offered to walk me to my building for a chance to 'feel some australian booty' I was less than impressed and responded that for that sort of action he better at least buy me a drink, then I quickly departed when he headed for the liquor store!

But anyway!  Last night was definatly my best so far.  I went and saw Rent with Vince which was fantastic, even better that I expected it to be.  It amazing how much control of there voices they had when they where jumping off tables and running upstairs.  It was 2000x better than the movie, incompareable really.  So before the show we went to this cute little french restuarant and I had the most delicious lamb.  First food then rent then snow!  Life was good!

Today there was still some snow around so I went to central park and took photos and to the Met and then me and sparky went out for a romantic steak dinner.  It was so tasty.  Like the best steak ive ever eaten.  It was from this little argentinian restuarnt and it was just a giant hunk of tender meat.  I was very impressed!

I went to the New York Public library yesterday and looked at the exhibitions there and went into the reading room.  Its amazing, its the most massive building and the ceiling has all these beautiful pictures all over.  Plus everything in marble, in alot of places actually.  I think there a little obsessed....

I went to the creepiest place the other day, its called American Girl Place and its this massive store filled with dolls and doll accessories. It's totally over the top, it even has a theatre where it performs musicals based on the dolls. It was seriously excessive they even had a doll salon!  Yes indeed, you take your doll there and they do its hair. You can't tell me thats not wierd!

Things are so different here, the stores are open late, theres so many shows and movies, theres always something to do.  And theres so much free stuff.  People who think New York is expensive are wrong, I mean it can be for a lot of things but if you look around its so easy to find cheap alternatives.  But the stores being open so late is so convient! the bodega's are open 24/7 and theres like 6 within a block from the apartment, take away places are open till at least 1 and deliver within 5 minutes and everything else is normally open until 9 or 10.  The other day omar went and got his hair cut at 9.30, and it was open as it is every night.  Even duane reade (priceline) half of them are open 24/7 and the other half don't close before 10.  Its so fabulously convenient!

I'm looking into taking a little trip this weekend, maybe boston or washington, its only $30 return on the bus so I can proably get away with $100 for the whole weekend!  Im so deliciously stingy.  Toronto is going to be more expensive though but I deflnatly want to go to niagra falls, even if the maid of the mist isnt working and im probably going to freeze to death.

The other day I was in the same internet cafe and the guy next to me was participating in a live gay chat.  It was rather amusing, as if you do that in a cafe where theres no privacy!

The girl sitting on the computer next to me is listening to a song with the lyrics-
'I want to fuck you fuck you I already know I want to fuck you fuck you come on lets go""
Its hard not to laugh out loud.  Very hard!

This is the best internet cafe ever!"

"event","Last night I had the biggest shock.  Im having some powercord issues with the mass amounts of electronics in my room so my lamp cord  is streched across to the powerboard along the side of my bed.  Now my little bizzare sleeping habits consist of me sleeping with 9 pillows and 2 doonas which i kick off the bed at various points in the night, so anyway being the lucky coordinated person I am one of these pillows happens to hit the cord  to my lamp bringing it crashing down onto my head.  Now if you've ever had a lamp smashing into your head while your asleep you'll know it isnt pleasent, My immediate reaction is of course to flail my hands around wildly getting me toally tangled in the cord while yelling incoherently, waking up everyone in the house before smashing my lamp into the wall.  Fabbo

Now onto uni, im still enjoying it besides my subjects being pretty boring.  I really like business computing.  Its fun because of the people in my workshop, we spend the entire time shit stirring each other and I actually understand the work which helps as well.  I totally dont get Macro economics but I think thats normal, except the guy told us in the lecture the other day that if you dont get this GDP thing then your definatly going to fail the subject, I don't get it.  But im hoping once I do the reading and shit I will.  Theres also a free pancake and ice cream lunch thing tomorrow which im excited about, free food is always good as im extremly low on funds.

All in all everything seems to be going pretty well at the moment.  I know im going to get sick of uni and the work load is pretty full on but it feels goood to actually be doing something with my life.  Working everyday and the monotony was driving me insane.  Uni is different, I mean theres structure but theres new information everyday, things are constantly changing, theres always someone new to talk to, somewhere new to visit.  I love it."

You couldnt even order drinks at the bar you had to buy tokens then use them to buy pre mixed drinks (UDLs and the like) me and sarah where just like wtf.  Then the music was atrocious, they had this band playing and all the blonde bimbos in there short shorts and the guys in there pastel tshirts where rocking out so me and sarah join in and where dancing like freaking loons and shouting and bouncing around when all of a sudden the band guys like ""everybody get down oooh ah ooh ooh"" and everyone crouches on the fucking floor! It was soooo bad. You could just see this sea of people squating.  Me and sarah are just pissing ourselves.

Then a bit later we where talking to this guy next to us and he actually thought we where serious! I was tres humilated.  I think our ""ENCORE"" ""WOOOOHOOOO""  ""PARTAY"" would have given us away but sadly no.  So uni could be embarassing.  

Then where like pppfff fuck this shit let karaoke, but the cover charges where like $20 each so where shot that idea in the head and went to this bar that was closing and then we went home.  Pretty much crap night, except for our dancing!"

"event","Well today was my first day of uni!  It was so nice not having to get up at 4.30am that I started off the day in a lovely mood!  So I  caught the train into the city and had no idea where to go so I went to the normal business building and low and behold that didnt help me at all then I asked this teacher person looking person who was sticking up phamplets where the stupid room was and he had no idea so I asked the security person and they gave me this neato little map thing and me and dani (this girl i meet in the elevator) attempted to find this stupid building.  

So we trapse around for awhile and we still cant find it so I look at the little map and low and behold its under the freaking church (I know!) so we get down there and find this massive arse room and have to sit down the front because where both blind and then this angry guy tells us how his going to fail us if we dont go to lectures and how its a really hard course blah blah blah (I didnt really listen) and 2 hours later it was over! 

So then me and dani met up with bec for lunch and we got lucky cup and subway and had a nice little chat and then it was time for me and dani to navigate our way to our next lecture which was equally bizzarly placed.  You know where you walking up from flinders street and theres a little arcade thing right near 7 angels and you can go down to the factory outlet place or go down this arcade place to dangerfield and studio girl? Well its right there, in this old movie threatre.  ITs actually really cool, and the wall sculpture things look like foxes.  Well anyway there where like a million people in that one and we just got seats together and he crapped on and we got let out half and hour early and then I went and brought some text books and came home!

Ohhhh and the best news ever is that this tutorial like thing we had to do for it isnt on the first 2 weeks so on wednesdays (which was my earliest morning at 9.30) I dont need to start untill 11.30!   

I can sense that im going to spend so much money always being in the city though.  I need a job, desperatly."

"event","So im generally a big hater of the whole valentines dealio, but today even i was struck by cupids little arrow.  I went out to dinner with my grandma (shut up) and I was sitting there quietly eating my steak when I looked over and saw this little old couple eating dinner.  They had gotten a little candle for the table and where holding hands, then as I watched the old man reached down and picked up this little bunch of flowers for the lady.  she looked so happy when he gave them to her and it was so clear that they where in love.  They where married ( im hoping to each other) and it was just that it was such a little gesture but meant so much.  I mean there was no fancy restuarnt, no jewerly or expensive presents, just them enjoying each others company.

"event","My weekend was rather eventful. Friday night I hung hung out with my pal Kat and we went on a orgasmic meat run, then a lovely little walk around the exhibition centre and I brought concert tickets to tegan and sara and broken social scene (wootang!).  Then it was christina's bday party and we went to this place that started with h opposite richmond station and it was all neato and had church seats.  I consumed to much alcohol (damn them and there efpos facilities).  The highlight of the night was dunking oreos in straight baileys for a tasty snack.  After h-abooble we went to the croft institute in the city and then i headed home.

Then saturday morning I woke up to early and went into the hairdressers (im now a blonde), then I napped and kat woke me from my slumber and then I  headed off to kathleens 19th (she cant be 20, we im pretty sure of it)  and we watched harry potter (the new one).  Actually getting to her place was an intesting little adventure because first I got lost looking for the supermarket, then i saw what i thought was a booze bus so I chased it because i really want to get breath tested but it actually turned out to be an ambulance and that was uber disapointing.  But we got there eventually.

Then sunday I worked and then me and kat had the intention of going to gloria jeans for chai but we ended up hitting maccas for ice cream and then heading on down to middle brighton beach where we made a giant sand vaginamite lady.  We then took photos of us violating our lovely sand woman.  By now we where to hyped up to go home so we went to star and took some happy snaps with the star statue things and of us frolicking near mary.  Then kat said she wanted to get in the pond at ANZAC so we went over there but it was all manky so we cancelled out that little plan.

And that was my weekend.  Tres asmusment.

Ohh and also wtf is with spiders.  Yesterday I got facialy violated bye FOUR spider webs.  All which has these massive big spiders sitting smack bang in them.  ITs like some sort of vendetta against poor little jill and as a result I keep feeling things crawl on me and grab frantically at my shoulder or whereever looking for these imaginary little spiders."

Yesterday I had insane hayfever attacks and looked like a crack addict.  Then we went the the drive in, but I got supremely lost and we missed the movie we wanted to see (cheaper by the dozen 2 shhhhhh) and so we saw the family stone instead.  We had massive amounts of doona and pillows and spooned in the back of the car.  It was saucy to the extreme.

Then on Saturday it was Bec's birthday so we had a lovely little picnic in the gardens where we ate orgasmic vegan cake and sarah got attacked by a dog.  Then we went out to a jazz bar and drank crazy, exotic cocktails.

Now im at work and im grump and tired and aggrivated and my sister sprayed baygon on my toothbrush."

I found the hippest new radion station 94.1 me and maddy where cruising chaps yesterday and totally rocking out, complete with dance routines, people pointed and marveled because we where so good!

In other news I found my phone, inside one of the camping chairs so im back in the game.

Ive also been spending some time picking at my sunburn, and although its painful and discusting its rather fun and amusing.  Maybe im a subconcious self harmer? hahaha hip

Meh nothing else has really happened, I saw the family stone and it was shit because they didnt kiss, I brought some kick ass posters including a grease 2 one! aaaand im the best at the chocolate claw grabbing game!

I was speaking to my mum the other day and she wants me and maddy to go to new york to visit her so I was thinking of ways to actually avoid spending time with her once I got there and me and maddy came up with the idea of a cross country road trip!  So next christmas (hopefully) me and maddy are jetting off to america to spead the love.  How thelma and louise (without the suicide)!

Anyway that is all minions!"

"event","Hrmmmm well I suppose I have to do that traditional christmas postical.  This christmas we decided to induct midge into the family and include and thus this became her VERY FIRST CHRISTMAS, which was hip.  ASo christmas eve we went down the cousins in an attempt to obey traditions and go to carols by candlelight on our tour of the christmas light.  Now for the first time in forever it was raining (my cousins been going for 15 years and its never once rained) so we hung at there house till we left to tour the christmas lights.

Now some of these people take it so seriously, where talking about cutting trees in half to fit in with the displayand rigging up illegal powerboards all over there living room.  We also have a personal favorite. loser boy, who stands out the front of his house in a cherry christmas outfit singing carols with his dog walking around with a basket tied to his head collecting change.  Unfortunalty we missed him this year, christmas wasnt the same.

Then on christmas day we went to my nannas for breakfast after driving around for 45mins looking for christmas cards.  My aunt gave us makeup so we disapeared into the bathroom for 45mins ""testing it out"" while also managing to avoid relos.  The we ate and left with the excuse to going to geelong.

We then went home and watched dvd's and napped for a couple of hours, before leaving for geelong.  I went and visit kat at work because she sounded sad in her lj post and I gave her some lovely yellow thongs for her present.  She stole some lollies for me.  It was tres christmassy.  Then apon leaving I noticed her little white car are thought what better time is there to leave a note?

Dear Kat
Please run away with me to barbados
I lvoe you with every inch of my manhood
Love Cyrill

Im sure she loved it.  Then the cousins was a bit of the same old, we just ate and watched tv, and frocliced.  Then we came home and dad didnt have his front door on his keyring and of course it was all my fault for not forseeing this and bringing my keys so he got all shitty and then broke the front door glass which is now patched up with plywood.  In the morning he found his key on the fireplace in his room and the key incident was never mentioned again.

Ten boxing day was amercias next top model marathon on fox 8.  So we headed off to midgey's house at 10 in an attempt to watch the entire 12 hours of it.  It was a struggle, but we fought through it with chocolate, crackers and massages.  12 consecutive hours of watching tv.  Im not sure if thats something to be proud of!"

"event","Kats entry got me thinking about Christmas and some of my favorite christmas memories.  When we where little we never did the conventional family christmas lunch.  We always used to go on random day trips.  Like one year we went to the beach and we where planning on having hot meat pie for our lunch and we brought them and left then in there bags on the sand with our towels and stuff while we went for a swim.  When we came back we realised that the seagulls had come and stolen them all.  Because it was christmas day nothing was open so we where starving but it was still an awsome day.  

Another time is when we went for a picnic in the You Yangs or whatever its called which are these moutains between melbourne and geelong.  Our plan was to climb the smallest one and stop for a picnic lunch.  It sohuld have taken about 2 hours.  4 hours later we where still climbing and me and my sister where playing about and my mum was cracking the shits.  After forever we finally reached the top and we realised that we had actually climed the highest one!

Then we started going to my nans for christmas which was always traumatic.  We used to have it in the botanical gardens (which has forever tainted them for me).  They day would always start of shitfully with my grandma calling a million times to check we where bring our designated food stuffs (normally desert), then we would all pile into the car, while dad desperatly tried to think of reasons not to come, he was never sucessful.  Then we would have to look for a carpark for about a hundred years, we would finally find one 60 km's away and get ready to lug all our shit around.  Keep in mind its about 60 degrees outside, so we would then wander around the gardens for yonks looking for our delighful relatives and when we would finally find them my nan would be sitting in a deck chair wearing a ridiculous hat, absolutly smashed.  My aunts and uncles would be having useless conversations about nothing and my 2 cousins would be sitting there pouting.  Now my cousins are in a league of there own.  The oldest is called alice but alice isnt arty and edgy enough for her so she changed her name to Ari.  Such a crock.  and both of them dont talk, like at all.  There the most boring people in exsistence.  The rest of the day consists of us sitting there bored, drinking luke warm softdrink and picking at the grass.  

Except the year I had food posioning, then I was drinking luke warm watered down lemonade, looking frantically for a toliet, throwing up in the bushes and picking at the grass."

"event","Ok this is going to be another entry about my nutty grandma.  We went out to dinner last and I drove because shes blind, well anyone she smashed into someone on the way home and her side mirror popped off and she had to go back and collect it.  She hid it under her hat so the owner of the car wouldnt see her, even though she was adament that she didnt leave any marks at all on it.

Anyway then she was telling me how fab her car is because everything just pops back on when you have accidents, an example of this was when we where pulling into the carpark and she told me to watch the partition things but it didnt really matter because shes crashed into them a fair few times and she just gets out of the car and puts the bumper in the boot and clicks it back on when she gets home.  :|

Then she got a little tanked and im sitting there like a 6 year old drinking coke and she was telling me about my mums childhood.  My mum was this insane feral and she used to climb over the gate and open it so her little brother got loose (he was only a toodler) and mum would run down to the tram stop and watch the trams and just leave bernie to fend for himself.  He nearly drowned in the neighbours pool one time but eventually he used to just go down to the pub and watch some old lady doing the washing.

Then my nan was telling me how my mum was a total druggie feral when she was a teenager.  Like insane druggie feral! and she had all these ""ratbag"" friends who got arrested and one committed suicide and i think they where just generally undesirable.

Then she was telling me how her second husband used to take her out to dinner and they would sneak into greek weddings and dance the night away, although it wasnt very interesting for her because she doesnt speak greek.

I think I might get my nan drunk again, twas alot more entertaining than listening to her babble on about the neighbours dog or bushes or something."

"event","Ok, long time since ive updated! But nothing has happened so I will bore you with the trival aspects of my life.

Friday night I was a total hobo and spent in my pj's watching secret life of us.  Tres hip. Then Satumaday I decided it was time for a visit to my delicious cousins in geelong.  We had to go into the city first and it was my first time driving there alone and only seconds driving in there at all so that was exciting.

On the way down we stopped at KFC for some tasty morsels and was discusted to find a grossy in Kats burger so she got her money back (a whole $4.45!).  Then we got there a had a musical extravaganza in em's room before she came home.  Then we just frollicked for a while.  Em was going to some sluts and pimps party or something and was wearing so little clothing it was quite ridiculous, she definatly fitted in with the theme.

Oh and renae came over and is a tad of a homo phobe so of course maddy and kat took that as an ivitation to caus mayhem by jumping all over each other while caressing each other in aq sexual maner.  When I was driving em and renae to there little shindig I was telling the story about kat having lesbian sex in maddy's bed and the look on her face was pricesless.  Im surprised her eyes didnt bulge out of her head.

Then we watched 12 year girl shows on foxtel while waiting eons for the food to be prepared.  Then we ate, then we left.

Now the entire purpose I invited kat was so she could direct me (I dont actually like her) and she managed to get us totally lost.  Oh and I sped in the burnly tunnel accidently.....by 10km's an hour....opps.  I'm just waiting to get a ticket.

Then on sunday I did nothing....shazam!

over and out"

"event","This morning was hystercial, and confirmed my dumbness no end.  Some how in all my intelligence I managed to lock the keys in the car, no not just in the car in the IGNITION WITH THE MOTOR RUNNING! Yay for Jill!

It started with my lovely little morning routine, I woke up dressed, headed to gloria jeans and picked up a delicious chai tea ( a yuppie drink for a yuppie car, at least that was my justification) and one of my jobs is to pick up the papers on the way to work.  So I pull up at the newagency and its dead.  

Theres no one around and the papers are on the pavement out the front so I think, heck save myself some time and just leave the motor running (before you start the car you need to let it warm up a bit and im just plain lazy) so I stick it in park with the handbreak on, jump out and grab my papers, takes all of 30seconds.  Head back to the car, try my handle.....shiiit its locked.  I forgot the car had this stupid security thing that locks the drivers door when theres no driver and the ignitions running.   Never mind theres 3 others, all locked including the boot.  I Forgot the cars been doing this thing lately where the remote central locking only opens the drivers door when you click it once and if you want everything open you have to click twice.  I hadnt clicked twice.  So all the doors and locked, as well as the boot and im straded outside the newsagency, no money or mobile with a locked car chugging along.

So I have to go into the newsagency and use there phone.  Now keep in mind these guys already hate me and think im a tit.  Try expalining that you locked yourself out of the car while its running.  You dont look to spanking clever.  So I call pretty much the only number I know by heart, home.  No answer fuitcake, what to do, what to do.  So I think I know! I'll call jeep assistance (jeep version of the RACV) luckily the numbers on a little sticker on the car so I call them and they say there've put me on the emergency list and will be there in 20mins.  I inform my ""friendly"" newsagency friends of this development and head outside to wait.

30mins later.  Not Jeep assistance, ive already read my papers help 3 imaginary interviews with celebrities in my head and done a manic display of star jumps.  If my newsagency guys didnt think im insane they do now.  So one of them comes out and tells me that Denise called because I hadn't shown up to work, she thought I had an accident.  Whoops, anyho shes gone to pick up dad who was a home and there bring the spare key up to me.  Whoop de do.  Another half an hour of waiting.

They finally show up and Jeep Assitance still isnt there AN HOUR after I called them.  Smucks.  So daddy dearest opens the car, mocks me and where on our merry way.  By this time my chai tea is as cold as ice and I thought asking him to take me to get another would be pushing it.

So then I finally get to work at 7.45.

Hip Hip Hooray, Im the new clare"

So I go to her ""your very bossy you know"" and she goes ""I KNOW THAT!"".

Denise was telling me once she was talking to her and she said she wanted to have brown skin.  Denise asked her why and she said it was because she really wanted to have purple skin because its her favorite colour but you cant have purple skin so she wants brown.  So Denise asked her why she didnt want white skin and she goes ""white skin is nothing skin, like water, its no colour"".  Keep in mind she was 3 when she said this."

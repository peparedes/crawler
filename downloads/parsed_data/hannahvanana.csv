"event","So Life's pretty good right now.  Yesterday sucked.  I locked myself in my room and basically starved myself and cried and slept.  It sucked.  My mom was being a psycho.  She wants me to pay rent or get out of here.  psh whatever.  But today was pretty great.  I went back to work after a very long break.  which i must say was very nice.  But work was fun.  It was pretty busy but I still enjoyed it.  I'm excited to go to school tomorrow.  I'm in a much better mood this week so it should be fun.  Full of laughing, and joyful smiling! haha.  Yeah last week was horrible.  Dont ask.  Its a four day week and prom on friday.  OOO yay! I am pumped.  Basically the whole frickin month of may is going to be a nonstop party and i am sooooo freaking excited.  So yeah Lifes good.  Im happy.  yay.

"event","Im so pissed.  I worked on Sunday and well I wasnt on my till basically at all.  I was outside cleaning booster seats for a good chunk of the day and when i was inside Ben was still selling of my till.  I left when my shift was over, at 6.  Brooke still hadnt come down to count money but w/e right.  No not alright.  I was off 20 dollars and now am taken off the schedule for 2weeks.  Hell with that, take me off for the rest of the time that place is open.  I QUIT.  Brooke SUCKS.  If she was doing her job, which is not upstairs talking to her mom maybe then we could figure this out but no Brooke doesnt do her job.  I woulda liked to watch them count the money, look behind my till.  And its really nice of Ben to put the blame on me, Ben the guy thats supposed to also be a manger claims its not his fault even though that we both know that I wasnt on the fucking till the whole fucking day.  Maybe some bitch face actually stole the money, I dont know, Maybe the very few times I was working of my money I accidently gave someone the wrong amount of change.  But to be taken off for two weeks seems riculous to me.  It seems ridiculous that brittany told me.  Its none of her fucking business.  Why would I quit?  Im sick of that junk hole.  I love that place more then anything dont get me wrong.  That place gave me life, it gave me so much but I cant take it anymore.  I cant take the favorism of that shit hole.  To be treated so wrongly.  IM done.  Tomorrow i work and if they give me the least amount of crap, Im walkign out then and there.  Otherwise Im saying just dont put me back on teh schedule when my two weeks are up.  So as of now, Next Wednesday is my last day at Mann Cinema 10.  Its gonna be hard.  Ive already been bawling my eyes out since i got home, Im leaving one of the most important things to me.  Im leaving my life behind and starting a new one.  Its gonna be hard to stay in touch with everyone but im going to try my best.  Bye bye theater."

"event","I'm so tired of acting tough.  Like im so strong.  When really my heart is breaking into pieces under the pressure.  I think so much of how far I've come, how much I've changed.  Just last year here I would sit up late at night crying myself to sleep because the pain was to much, I remember pleading to God to just end it somehow, someway just to let me be up in heaven with all the angels and be under His care.  I remember confiding to my best friends about my inner secrets, about the pain I was bearing...and then there's now.  When someone asks me what's wrong, I act as if I'm just really tired, or I'm deep in thought.  Nobody knows.  I dont even think I know anymore.  I have become stronger, I give myself credit for that.  When a hit comes, I just blow it off.  Pretend that I dont care and I choke down my tears.  To think of the last time I had a good cry...I dont even remember...besides Lauren's death.  Is that good?  I dont know.  I live by my motto to live everyday like my last, to live life to the fullest.  But sometimes...just somedays I could use a friend.  I'm not really known anymore to go to people when i need help, when i need someone to talk to.  So i guess that makes it difficult.  But right now its becoming so much, I'm trying to be so tough, to put on that stupid smile and say ""I promise, I'm okay"".  Im sick of doing that.  I'm not okay.  Why do the same issues seem to come up with <i>all</i> of my friends at once?  I wanna know why.  Because it makes it extremely hard for me to deal with it when they are all doing it.  So I guess smoking pot is the new high this month.  It makes me so sad.  Thats when it's really hard to act tough...is when that is repeatedly brought into my life.  I dont think anyone knows how I feel about it.  I accept it.  I can't change my friend's views on it, I cant change their thoughts or them doing it.  But I want them to look at it on my view.  Just once I want them to feel the pain I had to go through for about five years...and it still continues.  I want them to just look in the t/v and see it played out.  To see and feel what it does to people that love them...and to themselves.  To never get sleep cuz the yelling is so bad, to come home to another broken chair, another hole in the wall.  Another story that I laugh off when really it feels like a thousand knifes sticking into my heart.  To watch someone that you love with your whole heart go through so much.  And you cant help them.  You're just another face in the crowd.  Another person for them to push around.  Another punching bag.  I love my brother, he hurt me so much but i love him...I forgive him.  But that wont ever take away the pain.  I cant even type all I want to rigtht now...It hurts to much.  Im out. night."

"event","To Lauren:

I never got the pleasure to meet you, I regret that.  Im sorry you had to go so soon.  But I want you to know that your life has affected so many people.  Mine included.  Im sorry that we were at a party, that Maria was drunk when she had to find out that her friend's sister was dead.  Im sorry that we didnt get their quick enough...that we panicked in fear that you were gone.  I still havent got to talk to Rachel, or even see her.  I found out the news outside on your porch...I didnt know who was gone.  Maria was sobbing saying ""Everyone has their time"", ""God chose this to be her time""...with hearing <i>her</i> we knew it was you.  We tried saying the the holy mary...but we we couldnt remember it, we were too shooken up.  I was told not to go inside...that it was ""too bad inside"".  We just huddled outside holding onto eachother as if the world had come to its end.  I havent cried that hard in my life.  We didnt know what to do...so we left your family in their pain.  And went back to a house where we let our own pain out.  Heather and I just huddled onto her couch and sobbed, eventually crying ourselves to sleep.  It wasnt a soundly sleep at all, there were no dreams, there were no thoughts...it was just dead.  We got woken up by your sister Rachel calling for Heather to come over.  I got dropped off at my house at 3...Didnt fall alseep until four.  But thats not even close to how little sleep your family got.  I went to work, tried to be okay but once Heather came to visit while your family was at the funeral home...It hit me the most, Im still shaking, I've hardly eaten a thing...I know thats probably not what you want to hear...but we are greiving for you.  I havent really stopped crying...because when im not crying on the outside, im crying in the inside.  Monday we will be having a special announcment for you, and having greiving counslers there to help out those in need...me included.  Im sorry you had to leave so much, your prom, your school, your family and friends.  Im sorry that God cut it so short for you.  Its not fair...not fair at all.  But im glad that you are up in heaven now, you're in God's care now and you wont ever have to hurt.  I dont know what more to say to you, besides the fact that im very sorry i never got to meet you.  God Bless you.





*Please pray for Lauren, for her family and friends...and for the people that didnt even know her...yet had a relationship with her family.*





God watch over us, guide us in the right direction and help us understand and accept why you took her life.  Help us heal through the months of pain, and help Lauren earn her wings.  In Jesus's name i pray.  Amen."

"event","Whats so great about me anyways?  I cant seem to keep relationships, I can be a bitch, I annoy myself...which means I most likely annoy others.  I will admit that i have been a very angry person lately, which means my anger and frustration has been coming out to people that dont deserve it at all.  The problem is i dont know how to channel my anger in a healthy way.  I dont know how to manage stress, anger, happiness...any emotion.  When im happy i want to shout and scream and run and just go have fun, why doesnt anyone else want to do that?  Im open to anything, I'll try anything.  You think that would make people want to be with me but instead it pushes them away.  I try to be nice, i really do and i know sometimes the worst comes out of me, i know jealousy comes out of me...and I'm sorry.  Im sorry for being annoying and bitchy lately.  I've had so much stress on my plate, with grades, work and my grandpa...its been too much.  I'm thankful for those very few times i get to escape from reality, where time doesnt matter and you're just with those <b>few</b> selected people...People that you want to be with.  I'm so tired of relying on things to make me happy, things that arent healthy for me, I'm supposed to be getting healthy and all im doing is punishing my body...making it gross and disgusting.  Im caught up in two different worlds...one world that i know is good for me in the long run, a world where i just concentrate on what i need to do...but the other world...its so much more fun, being free...for once.  I cant do two at the same time, trust me...I've tried.  I want to feel appreciated.  I want to feel needed and loved.  It seems like all ive been .... is just <i>there</i>.  That how far ive come doesnt matter, how nice ive been to people that dont deserve my time...all i get back is back stabbing...the fact that i've loved them with my whole heart, that i've cried and prayed for their safety...and all i get is their time...when they feel like it...when theres nothing left to do...they go to me.  You say you love me, you give me a hug and say you're always there for me...but in reality...no ones there.  They say it, but when you are in desperate need of a hug, you call them, text them...talk to them...their too busy to manage to give you one freaking hug.  I mean thats all i need, is a hug..hugs always make me feel better.  But that would waste someones time.  And i dont want to be a burden in anyones life...so maybe i should just fly solo.

"event","Ever feel like you're just standing in the middle of this huge crowd and yet no one looks down to see you...no one hears your cries.  You feel so left out, so helpless-the ones that you thought would stick by your side till the very end left you for the more 'popular' kids.  You know our society is pretty fucked up...You see it everywhere the <i>image</i> you're supposed to be...ya know all that makeup, your nails all done, and you are supposed to be as skinny as you can be and are always on another diet.  And if you dont achieve this...you're kicked out.  Simple as that.  I walk down the hallways at MGSH and thats all there is...just all these fake wanna be girls...if they are so fake, then why does everybody love them?  Thats one part of my school, the other part is drugs and alcohol-seeing deals happen throughout the school and talk about what party they are going to on the weekend and how wasted they're going to get.  Thats all that damn place is.  I hate it, I know ive become one of them, just another face in the crowd.  You try and lightin things up, by dancing down the halls and screaming at the top of your lungs, but no one joins you.  They are all scared of what people are going to think of them.  I mean all people are self conscience...you cant help it.  Some are better at listning to the voice in their head versus the voices of the people's oppinions which shouldnt count.  Im pretty good at listning to my own voice...but i get caught up sometimes...where you just stare in your mirror in complete disgust of whats staring back at you.  With my whole accomplishment of gaining weight...i mean its really good, im really proud of myself...I have a feeling i still am too skinny...but now im thinking maybe im too fat.  But then i have to stop myself...I want to live, i want to dance, i want to laugh and smile, and if i want that then i have to keep up eating.  It would just be nice if i felt like my friends cared.  I was so happy that i gained all that weight...that took me forever, and when i say forever i do mean forever...cuz when you are in that position...it seems so long.  A long journey of pain.  And all i got was ""omg good job!""  I want a frickin hug! Just something.


I just hate it.  I hate being the 3rd wheel..the one that gets called to hang out just because their previous plans were broken.

"event","Ahhh i feel so free! I just wanna go up on top of a really high building and fly off! haha although i dont think i would fly.  THis weekend has been so great and its only the beginning.  So yesterday at school i had to make up all my finals that i missed but that was okay because it was the last day of the trimester, although it was kinda sad since i wont be having classes with some of these people and ive gotten so close to them!  Lucky for them, i got their numbers! hehe!  So after school i waited for Heather until 3:30 she had to take a test.  So she was feeling kind of bummed out so i was trying to get her happy, and im pretty sure i accomplished it!  We got mcdonalds like old times...split the 20peice chicken nuggets, large fry, and a large pop.  And then it was perfect window down weather, so we had the windows down, music blarring and using our cellphones as microphones!  It was soo much fun!  So then we dropped in at the theater and went into Harry Potter...ugh i was soo bored, i made us come out! haha.  It was so nice to spend time with that girl, man do i miss her!  So after that she had to work so i went with Karissa to get KFC with her dad, then we headed back to her place and ate it there, then stopped at my place to pick up my crap because i was gonna spend the night.  (We actually were getting along!!!).  So after that we called up Matt and Ian, and they came over, and we walked around the block once, and omg! the stars were incredible! aww i love the stars!  Well after walking around the block we headed up to the park and chilled out there, Ariel, Ryan and Brittany joined us a couple minutes later.  Ryan and Britt were being really big poops though, they stayed in the car because it was ""too cold"" even though Matt offered them one of his numerous jackets, but ""noo we're sick"", oh please then why are you here?  seriously i was sicker then both of them, i shouldnt have even been out since i already had missed two days of school.  But w/e! Not my deal!  So me and Ariel teeter tottered while Matt and Karissa played chicken on top of it, and then me and Ian played chicken on it...I won! ... well not really...hehe.  But that was a ton of fun!  It started to get really cold so we went back to Karissa's and we put a movie on...but man oh man i had way to much energy to be sitting around watching a movie!  So Matt and I took a jog around the block, and i probably walked only 10 seconds of it! I was really proud of myself, but that jsut gave me even more energy that i had nowhere to put.  So Ariel, Matt and I just stayed and talked in teh kitchen for awhile.  Heather evenutally came over too.  Once the movie was over, Ryan and Britt left, which really didnt make a difference since they only interact with each other...stupid.  So we all went downstairs and played Cranium...okay never let Heather and Matt be partners cuz they are both frickin geniusus and totally won...w/e! hehe.  But i started getting really sick, like i was gonna throw up and karissa had already thrown up...i think it was the KFC...it sucked.  Everyone left around 12 and Karissa and I headed upstairs to get some sleep since we were waking up super early....yeah she wouldnt stop talking...i dont even know what she was talking about i was so tired...so i didnt get to sleep until about 1.

We woke up around 7:45ish, finally got out of bed at 8, got ready really quick and then called up Ian and Matt...no response from Ian...pooper.  But we then went off to Bens for breakfast.  Ugh i didnt get to help with like anything! all i got to do was set the table, put frosting on the cinamon rolls and put fruit in a cup...Karissa and Matt got the eggs, and Ben got the french toast....why does everyone think im such a bad cook???  Im really not that bad!  I swear!  But it was soooo good, man oh man!!! yummy!! Bens bird gave me the creeps...i really dont like birds i decided.  So after that Ben had to get ready for work, so we left, Karissa went home and me and Matt hung out.  It was sooo incredably nice outside! like holy cow!  So we packed up some rollerblades and tennis stuff and headed up towards the theater.  We basically just hung outside the whole day in teh parking lot.  I attempted to learn how to rollerblade, and you know what i think i got the hang of it!  And we played frisbee and Natysin came out for awhile and played frisbee with us and ahh! it was just so nice to be outside!  After awhile we went in and watched Nanny McPhee...not that bad of a movie, i must say.  And after that Ian and Tiry were up at the theater so we went back outside and threw the football around for awhile...well more like they threw the football around, i was off in my own little world.  Then we headed back towards Matt's cuz he had to get his work clothes and i saw the new puppy, and for a dog this one was pretty darn cute!  and it actually liked me, so i was happy!  Hmm yepp, so then I went home, and just have been chillin at home all night...im really really pooped out, so i figured this is the best since i still got tomorrows full plans!!! yay!!!!  awwww! i love spring! it puts me in such a good mood!!  Even though i hear its supposed to snow on sunday and monday...whats up with that?!?! jeez!  But yeah im gonna go for now!

Yesterday and today were exactly waht ive been needing for sooo long!  Just break loose, not worry about anything, just living the moment!! awww thank you!

"event","I finally did it!  I finally gained it all back!  Im still way behind what im supposed to be, but to finally be at a suitable weight...It feels great.  I couldnt imagine getting to this much...it seemed so far away, so impossible, but i did it.  Its hard to think that last year i was fifteen pounds under this and still to do this day i cant tell the difference...I wish there were pictures that could show me how much ive changed...if you can even tell.  Thats what im afraid of, that people wont be able to see that i finally gained weight.  I mean i can tell just by my extreme amount of energy.  Man i have never had this much energy in my life!  I used to just want to sit around and do nothing, just cuz i <i>couldnt</i> do anything.  I couldnt throw a bowling ball, I couldnt stand up by myself, couldnt walk by myself, couldnt remember, always shaking and blacking out...thats done with.  Now im sitting up at one in the morning bouncing up and down wanting to go out and party but everyone else is asleep.  I actually did it.  I know that a lot of my friends had given up on me, just cuz it was so hard to manage to put a frickin french fry in my mouth, i mean one french fry would do so much to me, it would make me so sick, almost ready to throw up, and i would feel just disgusting.  And NOW i go into wendys and order the 10piece chicken nuggets, with fries, a pop and occasionally a cheesburger too! and eat the WHOLE thing!  god it feels so good, to be like everyone else for a change, to plan those fat nights and actually follow through just cuz i CAN eat whatever i want.  I dont want to sound stupid and self centered or what not, but im proud of myself, i want my friends to know.  I mean this definately calls for a celebration!  And i just want to say...to all those that dont believe me when i say i eat, fuck you! You can go run into traffic! because yeah i lied about it last year, but i mean its kinda obvious, you can tell if someone is eating or not.  And when you never see me eat because you arent around when its time to have lunch or what not, that certainly doenst give you a right to start pointing fingers at me!  Oh my god! I DID IT!!!!  after all those talks with my doctor, school nurses and teachers and of course all my friends...i actually pulled through.  I can for once see my future. YAY!!!!!




So i think this definately puts me in a better mood since ive been home sick for the past two days...ughhh.  and i ahve four tests to make up tomorrow since tomorrows the last day of the trimester. gross. buttt tomorrow is like a friday but i odnt know if ill be able to follow my plans out for tonight since ive been sick...=(...we'll see."

Just becasue im so skinny doesnt mean i starve myself...I mean they do have a right to wonder because of last year but you think they would believe me when i say that i really do eat.  It just pisses me off...because they jsut go ""yeah sure you do"" or ""i just want you to be healthy hannah"" well okay me too...and i am healthy, i ate a whole freaking pizza by myself on friday! yeah try telling me i dont eat one more time and ill give you a slap.  I fell asleep in geography today during a video and the teacher steps on my foot to wake me up...who does that?  steps on thier foot?  well then i felt really bad and i think i got points marked off...thank god i only have 2 more classes of that class for the rest of my life! yes!!  So Ryan thinks its funny about the whole situation going on...ha ha ha...yeah if you can laugh about me saying fuck you get out of my life then i guess you really dont care...oh FYI Ryan...i wasnt going back to you...i was saying im here whenever you want to make it ok i'll be willing to do that...but now im more leaning towards no really fuck you.

Okay so you know i put up with a lot of shit...i called him a best friend even though he never would hang out with me because he wouldnt give up time with his girlfriend, wouldnt talk to me when i needed him, never called, all that stuff.  Yet i clung onto him.  I loved him.  So this year i met a lot of cool new people, people that were there in seconds when i went crashing and the next day would find me to make sure i was alright.  They actually would ASK me if i wanted to be with them...wait? whats this?  Someone wants to be with me! wow! No he never did that.  I was always the oen to ask...and i would always get blown off.  And he says i blew him off.  What a fucking joke.  He said that i lied when i said i loved him and cared.   Another joke.  I would NEVER lie about that...i've told a few white lies here and there...but for teh most part i dont lie and i wouldnt lie to someone when i say ""i love you"".  Am i hurt? No.  I mean a bit of me is hurt...but not hurt enough to cry...not hurt enough to be sad because well truthly i dont care.  He's hurt me too many times, ive cried too many times and said too many prayers. and what do i get in repay...maybe a hug.  So all the sadness was wasted last year and theres no more room for it now.  Thank god.  I have my real best friends to worry about.  And well everything seems to be going pretty well with them right now.  You know..this year has been the worst best year ever.  Ive met some of the best people on this whole freaking earth...Ive kept some awesome friends as well.  I have people that love me for me, people that care, people that want to be with me.  and i love them so much.

"event","Work sucked.  Gross.  I'm really starting to hate it there.  Like really bad.  So i was pretty quiet the most part and well i have had ENOUGH about hearing about prom.  Im sorry but it just kinda hurts, because i was going to go, they said i was going to go...I mean that was last year.  And im not really upset about it, i mean i know its just going to be a drama fest but i thought this was the big thing to end  the year with them, since next year i wont even  know them anymore.  Well at work they were talking about prom again and i said ""can we not talk about prom""...i meant it for only me to hear but i guess everyone heard...and karissa snapped back at me saying she's only talked about it with me once...what a joke.  Everytime i've been with her she has talked about it and it just makes me feel left out...like crap.  She thinks im upset about another reason and the only reason is ... well didnt your mother ever tell you to not talk about some event with your friends if theres someone there that isnt invited??  I guess not.  Well then Karissa went up to Ryan and all i heard was ""Hannah's mad at me cuz ....... "" Im not going to finish the rest.  Seriously dont talk about me when im standing right fucking THERE! like wow...i thought it was bad enough having you guys talk shit about me when im NOT there but when im standing right NEXT to you....that hurts.  So then the rest of the day went really blah.  After work was fun though, Ariel and I walked up to taco bell, got some food and then hung out up at the theater...that was so fun!  I had so much energy!  It was so nice to smile, and joke around for once.  awww.  Although a friend of mine wasnt being very nice to me...kept saying really mean stuff to me...and even if it was meant as a joke...it hurt a lot...like it really did, I actually had to choke down tears....god...i hate when i let thier words get to me.

I did drive for two hours this morning, i went on the freeway and ran errands! it was mucho fun!  We stopped at my grandparents house and wow...they are getting so bad.  I didnt realize that their age is really catching up to them.  My grandpa had a hard time keeping his head up...Hes going in on Tuesday to learn about the treatment hes going to be going on...and then my grandma is starting to forget a lot....And all i can do is be there with them....

I seem to replay last year a lot in my mind...all my regrets...the regrets i was trying to forget are biting my ankles....they're right....im not better...i mean i really was, i was being sooo good....but now....its all downhill...it gets less and less each day...but then somedays i cant believe im doing that so then i do a really good job, but then its just a repeat i feel lowsy about myself and i try and fix that...just not in a good way.

I have no idea what im doing with my life right now...im throwing it away wiht bad choices...arg.





""...Im falling apart again...i cant find a way to make emense...im looking in both directions....but its make-belief...its all pretend...soooo...<b>shed some light on me</b>...and hold me up in disbelief, and shed some light on me and tell me something that ill believe in..."""

"event","So my brother Justin just recently moved out of the house...he's in his late 20's so it was nice to finally get him out.  I mean i do love him to death, hes like a best friend to me...although i didnt really get to see him much when he was living here...i hardly get to talk to him now.  But anyways...he deals with a lot of crap.  He takes medication for anxiety/depression and he works basically 24/7.  He has a lot of stress on his plate.  So he moves out...and i guess the hours he's there can get pretty lonely.  So he went out and bought a cat.  Even though he has a cat at home.  Well he took the cat to the vet and it turns out that it has a hear mumre and has to be put to sleep.  sad.  So the one thing thats good for him is taken away.  Hes been spending A LOT of money lately...money we know he doesnt have...he just got in a car accident.  Im scared for him.  My other brother Josh said he's going to get out of control with spending money and get into serious trouble and kill himself.  I cant handle that.  I dont want to worry about this again.  I had to do it enough last year.  But last year he was right there where i could keep an eye on him and monitor his pills, now i cant...he lives accross the city.  I dont know what to do.  Pray for him please."

Where are all the cute boys?!?!  i mean yes we do have B lunch which sucks majorly...but STILL!  We finally found a table with a few cute ones...haha we just stood there staring at them...haha i was trying to get Laura to find me a cute one....see my standards are really high...haha the only ones we could THINK of we didnt even see...were the stoners...haha me and a stoner! haha.

"event","A- on my math quiz today!!! yeah thats right!  Wow that made me so frickin happy! no lie!  Foundations holy cow i musta had too much sugar!  i was bouncing off the walls!!  But it all simmered down once i got to biology...well because i gotta keep on task in that class...and well yeah the rest of the day was very blah.  I was crabby, tired and irritated.  After school i got right to my homework (odd) and i finished it all and did such a good job! im really proud of myself and i did this all while having a very serious conversation with Bri, and wow i feel so much better telling someone about it all.  Like i was smiling and laughing for once.  It was so nice to get it all of my shoulders, yet its still sitting there because of my curosity.  

Im not going to lie, life hasnt been treating me too nicely these past few weeks.  Ive been tryign really hard to keep my head up high, and look at things with a positive attitude but it really isnt helping.  ...and i know exactly why... and i hate it.  Im trying so hard to not let it get to me, to forget about it...but its soo hard.  and it hurts, it feels like my heart is bleeding.  ANOTHER one...another frickin friend...gone.  Seriously i want to know what i do wrong to make the best leave my side.  I remember last June...when Ryan left my side, stopped caring...ha the funny part was it was my fault...i told him the truth that he didnt want to believe so he left...that was the most difficult month of my life, I had lost one of what i thought to be a very good Best Friend.  I cried myself to sleep everynight, bearing so much pain on my heart.  Thinking the unthinkable...and he still doesnt know to this day how much pain he caused me.  And to only be able to talk to one person...but she was there for me.  Who knows maybe he'll even read this.  Ive started so many emails trying to tell him but they all ended by pressing the save button.  I mean we got good again...now we dont talk much, but he came back after awhile.  And the pain stopped and my trust went back.  well not any more now...he lost that with me.  But to go through this <i>again</i> only with someone new...Ive been holding my head up the highest i can reach, ive been chocking down all the tears, even if my eyes fill up with tears i wipe them away...im not gonna cry...im gonna try really hard to go along wtih everything like its normal when really...it feels like a knife is sitcking in my heart and only this person can take it out...only this person can heal the pain right now...without them i feel like a part of my soul left...the part that made me smile and laugh...now its a straight face and a fake smile and a pity laugh here and there.  Its crazy how your best friends can mean the world to you...its insane...and especially me...why me...I dont have too many good ones out there and when i find them i hold onto them with all i got...i care about them so frickin much, i would do anything for them anyday, even if its risking my own life...But this person doesnt care anymore.  I love them with my whole entire heart and i cared about them as much as i could care about someone...but it doesnt matter...they left...



say a little prayer for me.  I want to get over this, and fast.  Because it hurts."

"event","Hiiii

Today i woke up and told myself that i had to make it good.  Im sick of feeling lowsy.  Sooo it started pretty nicely and all.  Karissa and i were getting along well and i was actually talkative at the tables.  Ugh but in math i got a D on my homework quiz which will bring my D+ down which isnt good since the trimester is almost over.  And now i have a test tomorrow and well...i dont know how that will go.  Im really nervous.  But it was still a pretty good day, I couldnt stop smiling!  it was nice, it would of been nice if i couldnt stop laughing...i love those days...where you just laugh ALL day long.  aww!  I miss them.

When i got home today i practiced driving with my mom...not good....like she was using that bitchy tone with me and i told her to stop because it was making me nervous and so she gets all pouty-mad at me, and then starts yelling at me for my grades and its like yelling isnt going to solve anything mom.  It just really pissed me off a lot.  I hate it.  Ive clearly been spending too much time at home because whenever that happens she gets sick of me and starts being her bipolar self and blames me for crap that i had nothing to do with.  Yet if im never home she yells at me for using the place as a hotel...well thats basically what it is...i wouldnt even say its a home...i hate it here.  I try and crash at other peoples houses on the weekends, that seems to be going pretty smoothly.  I cant wait for summer where i can just go out all the time...aww!

So now im here...bored as heck.  and pretty hungry too.  Im really confused lately wiht my friends...like im gaining a lot...and i love them to death...but i know they arent a good influence for me at all.  But their so fun to be with!  Just doing random crazy shit all the time! i love it!  But then my other friends, my good ole buddies that never leave my side...i feel like they are drifting further away from me..and it hurts a lot.  The calls have stopped, the text messages have stopped...even the little i love you's seem to be forced out...and these guys are my best friends...i think i took them for granite and now that i realize what i had...i want it back so badly....i just hope they take me back.  Im sorry guys.  I havent been that good of a friend lately...ive been too..out there.

errr..im sick of feeling so lonely all the time...im always surrounded by people, like its insane my weekends are jammed pack full of plans...like ill work, hang out with somone, and then maybe after hanging out with them ill go to someone elses hosue and spend the night...and its just like...aw!  how can i feel so lonely when im standing right next to them?  I think its cuz im so clingy, because i love them so much and i want them to know...and i guess it gets annoying...yet if i try and distance myself even a little bit they think that im mad or something....aw i dont know!  someone please correct my brain!"

"event","Hmm so today was okay i guess, it got better as the day went on.  Man last night sucked so bad, i couldnt stop shaking and i was trying to choke down tears but they just wanted to come out, so after a good long cry i started feeling all numb and i couldnt feel my tongue and i couldnt breathe.  It was awful.  I seriously thought i wasnt going to wake up in the morning.  What caused this to happen?  Stress upon stress upon stress.  The main point im not getting into, most people know why i havent been able to smile...even that person knows why.  Ive been trying my best to stick through it, which worked out for the most part its just when things keep piling on and on and on, i eventually just crash.  And now with my grandpa sick...Im worried and scared.  

Ive been holding on closer to people more then ever and i appologize.  I know ive been extra clingy, i always get that way when everything hurts the most, and i really dont mean to.  I always seem to send the wrong message out when really i just like to be close to everyone.  I mean i love holding hands, girls, boys, i just like to hold hands...whats so wrong with that?  Back in kindergarten it was UNCOMMON to see you not holding someones hand...now you're only allowed to do it if you're going out with the person...psh!  to hell with that!

Today was such a gross day.  I didnt really talk to anyone, I was just in a pissed off mood and wanted to kick someone.  By fourth hour it got good though, fourth hour it always gets good...doing nothing basically in that class but talk to my girls and text people its so nice.  For lunch...mini corndogs!!! hell yes! we never get those, they were kinda gross though but the mashed patatoes...yumm!  It made me really really happy!  and then in Geo all we did was work on the project that im falling behind on...its due on thursday...i really should be working on that.  Last but no least life fitness, i ran the final thirty minutes today!  YES! never have to run thirty minutes again! That made me really happy too...soo in generaly my bad day turned out to be a pretty good day! Which makes me EVEN MORE happy!!


well im off to take a nap and do some homework.


bye bye!"

"event","...I can hardly even talk right now...

I used to have one of these before but i was really bad at keeping it going so i stopped and had to make a new account now.

So yeah...I've been living a secret life...a life that not even my best friends know...Its starting to get really hard.  They dont even know...Im tired of relying on certain things to make me happy, Ive already fucked up my life thats what they dont know, they dont know that the innocence was only a cover up.  That I really am the screw up in the family, I've turned out just like <i>him</i>.  Just like <i>they</i> said i would be.  Maybe it was all those nights my mom screamed in my face telling me the person i was going to turn out to be...im almost there, just a few more steps and ill be just like <i>him</i>...the person i used to hate and fear, ive nearly become a mirror image.  

Ive grown stronger now that i dont rely on them to save me.  I dont tell anyone my feelings anymore.  I learned to choke down the tears, ive learned how to give the fake smile and laugh.  To pretend like i couldnt be happier when really...I couldnt be sadder.  Im so sick of this.  Why just why when im at my worst why cant i pick up the phone...I know they'll make me feel better, i know they'll make me laugh...but i cant.  I cant manage to hit only one button and id have them on the other line.

All our world is...is drugs and alcohol.  Especially when it involves stealing your pain away."

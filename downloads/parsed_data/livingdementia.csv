"event","The bell rings and the students pile out of Mr. Fogwaters class. Why would anybody take this class in the first place. Its the hardest to pass, and the most boring to sit through for 4 hours. Sadly its a reqired class for history majors and teachers. Now i know what your thinking, all history classes are easy, or at least thats what i was thinking. But no, we dont discuss history or why this and what about that. Rather, Mr. Fogwater just lectures on and on about cause and effect, his, ""it couldnt have happened any other way"" theory is the bassis of all his exams, and is the most bogus thing i have ever heard. Honestly, a man who thinks slavery and the holocaust were good things that opened human eyes to the horros of humantiy shouldnt be aloud to teach other human beings. Now that there my friends is an example of the real horrors of humantiy.
        ""Mr. Shittingwit."" said Mr. Fogwaters
        Yes, yes my name is Shittingwit, Thomas Shittingwit. Back off! you dont think i had enough fun with that name in school. Ok, ok you made your point, you know its not my fault. Im German.
        ""Yes Mr. Fogwaters?"" i replied.
        ""Mr. Shittingwit, i have read your paper on the cause and effects of world war two. Your theroy on the axis mistakes and the high cabability of them winning the war is how you say, questionable. But pleace, do not mistake me for a third rate teacher. It was a well writen paper. Therfore i beleave your grade shall sufice."" said Mr. Fogwaters
        ""A sixty-four! You gave me a god damn sixty four on my paper! I worked for hours on this paper. I pored a life time of reserch and, and, and real life expeances from my grandfathers into this paper and you failed me!
        As he attempted to give his little explination i flipped through the paper looking for what little coments he wrote next to paragraphs, or main sentences. An interesting here, a questionbable theroy there. What. Incorect. Why does it say incorect?
        ""Incorect! Are you fucking kidding me. This was a pure opinion paper. Its physically imposobale for an opinion to be incorect."" i shouted.
        ""Mr. Shittingwit, do not take that tone with me. And yes your opinion is incorrect. There is no posobale way Germany could have won that war!"" he yeld back.
        ""Are you fucking seriouse! Look at this, if they didnt declare war on America, they had a good chance of winning, If they were to move the three hundred thousand troops they had in the industrial sections of Finland to France and Normandy in june when the invasion took place, they would have drove the alies back into the sea. If..""
        ""Enough! Listen to me you little kraute bastard. Do not argue with me in my classroom, or i will have you detained and taken back to your dorm. If you fight the security, beleave you me i will make one phone call and have you expelled from this school. I kid you not. Just because you wrote some BULLSHIT paper on how your grandfathers COULD have won the war doesnt make it so. Your pathetic excuses for your country does not change the fact that your race is the scum of the earth. And i find it odd how the worst peaces of SHIT had the balls to atempt to exterminate the second worst peaces of shit. If it wasnt for descrimination laws i would fail you in a heartbeat and have you taken from my class. I would rather, fuck a nigger and have a deamon child then even look at you. You may leave my class now, and if i were you, i would not return. Good-day.""
        I turned around swallowing my pride and stormed out of the classroom. If i had things my way i would have punched that teacher in the mouth right there and shown him the German point of view. Although, one more offeance like that and i would shurelly get kicked out of school. Then that fucking Brtish bastard would have his way. I could see it now. Him sitting in his office drinking tea and eating crumpets watching my walk away. Well if he beleaves in the theroy of ""it couldnt have happened any other way"" then ill show him the way it was ment to happen."

"event","""So you are haveing the dreams again correct?"" ask the doctor.
        ""Yeah, there weird though. Conusing even. Its like my mind is trying to tell my body to do something, but its just not listening, you know?"" replied Tommy.
        ""Well Thomas, dreams are the supconsiouse way of your mind expressing itself. Releaving the pressures of normal life, and reality to a world of pleassurable dessire. Only a man of great wisdom ca........""
        Man why is he the only person that calls me Thomas? I wouldnt even be here if the court didnt apoint me this guy. God damn flight attendants, always make a big deal over nothing. I missed my flight because of that bitch. And my girlfriends birthday. Oh yeah that was a great phone call. ""Hi honey, ummmm yeah i cant make it because the cops arrested me for threatening a flight attendant."" She broke up with me two days later by the way. I havent found a girl since. She was the only one who understude me for who i was. To her i wasnt just some geek, or the little guy all the jocks beat up. To her i was somebody, i was her boyfriend Tommy. I guse we grew apart after high school. She went away to Washington State University, and i stayed here, and went to Prinston. Yeah, thats right, im a Jersy kid. And you know it is true wih what they say. Jersy people do have attitudes.
        ""Thomas!"" yelled the doctor.
        ""God damnit, what!?"" i replied.
        ""Are you listening to me? This is very important."" said the doctor.
        ""Yeah, yeah. Hanging on every word."" i replied.
        God damn doctor always interupting my thinking. Him and his fucking Russian accent. Oh look at me, im so important i get paid 500 dollors an hour by the state to tell you whats wrong with yourself. Look at me scrible on my notebook.
        ""Thomas!"" the doctor yeld once again.
        ""What the fuck do you want baldy?"" i yelled.
        ""Thomas....."" he said with a strong voice. ""Raising your voice in anger is no way to talk to me. I am your athority figure. I am here to help you. Not cast you aside like some, oh look at that. Times up. Ill see you next week Thomas. Remember, a happy mind, must star from within.""
        ""Yeah yeah, ill intrudes my happy foot into your ass. No wonder you guys lost the war."" i mumbled under my breath as i left his office."

"event","I awake to the sound of my own panting. Qickly looking to the left, the right, behind me, to the left again. Nothing. Nothing except endless woods and a bright moon nowhere to be found. My pulse quickens, my heartbeat races and my mind strugles to keep up. And there it is, the crackling of the bushes and leaves, never have i been here before but the stench and hot breath breathing down my neck is all to familiar. I run, as fast as my legs can carry me i run. Through the trees and the streams, paying no mind to the beasts and foul creatures of this forest. Scratches from the foliege are of no consequeance to the horror that hunts me. Shadows arise from a shadowless figure, and as much as i plead with myself notto i look, and nothing. Still i continue to run. Faster and faster knowing that to slow at all or to simple give up would mean serten death. But yet the creature plays tricks with me. It is niether here nor there. It is everywhere, in front of me, behind me, to my side. Above and beyond me, in me....
       And yet i still feel the need to run. Just like everytime it will always catch me, just like every time it will always defeat me. There is no end to the forest, no end to the chase, or the creature that consumse my soul. But what is this ahead? An opening, never in these long years has there been an opening. Hope arises and fear is a battering ram to pain. Into the opening i must go. Out through the forest i plow into the moonlight......and the breath is there no more. I stumble to the middle of the circular clearing, having pushed myself far beyond any mortal bounds. And i fall to my knees, when sudenlly i hear from the forest, a chanting. Men cloaked in black robes, with hoods covering what faces they might have aproach from all derections. And still chanting. Words not ment to be spoken by human tongues. My first instinct of corse is to run, but i can not. I am paralized by an unknown force. And once again, i feel its hot breath on my neck.
       Suddenlly has if thousands of fireflies where set loose apon this medow flames arise not more than arms length from me. The heat i can feel with all being of my body, yet unable to repell from the inferno. The chanting grows louder as i see him once again. Imerging from the flame comes the creature. Bloodshot red eyes, fangs covered in blood inbeaded soundly in his mouth. Horns flowing down his head past his neck, an endless field of monsterouse structure on the creatures body. And as always i cannot look away from the his gaze. I am lured into hes eyes. Hes cold, blood red eyes. Seeming to flow from his demonic being like water from a shattered dam. A dam broken by too much pain, too much hurt, and too much abandonment. Slowelly he struts toward me. A small smile growing on his scalley face. A hand extend to me and...............
        I awake in my bed, gasping for air, sweat soked sheats, and a tear in my eye."

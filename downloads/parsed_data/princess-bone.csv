"event","Yay the homecoming game was sooo awesome! Me, kelly, ally, and even my sister had a lot of team spirit. We made friends with one of the conductors whose like a senior of something and made cheers for him, and STEGGY! Also ali dropped his mallot through the bleachers and kelly and my sister went to go get it so he wouldnt have to do pushups. Also sadly we thougth NH won but we really didnt because they didnt guard the ball and instead went running down the field in victory while the other team ran to get the ball and ended up winning.
After the game we went to the galleria for a few min and we saw sasha, henry, sami, natalie, and some others until the guards told us to stay on the sidwalk."

"event","Tonight me, ally, and lena went to the galleria because lena had never heard or been to it before. It was so f-ing fun! We went to the cheesecake factory and before we got our food sacha and kara met us at our table. Then audrey came and the manager told us taht only 4 people were allowed at the booth, so audrey got up but he said taht one more person had to leave, so sacha had to leave because we needed kara to stay because it was her ""birthday"" (basically just to get a free cheesecake but they charged us anyways). After that we walked around and i saw bess, kenza, rachel karp, rachel keller, aliza, zaria, jared, francis, lily, sydney, diana, lia, and many many more people. Next week i think im gonna go again and see more people! If anyone wants to meet up comment!

"event","In response to everyone else who wrote about this topic, I agree with you. Savor your last moments in middle school because it was some of the best years of my life. Even though i said i hated millikan, and i wanted it to burn, when i look back, i really did have an amazing and fun time there. High school includes, tons of gallons of homework, being on the bottom of the food chain again, and so much more drama. Also to all you 8th graders, make sure you apply to lots of high schools and do really really well in school so you get in to a lot of them. I wish i could go back to 8th grade and change my high school applying process.  Don't make the same mistake i did and apply for only one school."

Luckily me and ally get to do yoga at l.a. community college instead of P.E., so we get a free period. The schedules pretty confusing also and i only get 15 minutes of lunch because i have to board the bus to go back to north hollywood. The only people i know are ally, casey, maddy, courtney, and sacha. Also, im hopefully not gonna go there next year because im applying to campbell hall, oakwood, and notre dame."

Finally at like 10:30-11:00, the power went back on. Today me and allia went shopping in beverly hills at kitson, ron herman, lisa kline, and other stores. Tomorrow morning i'm going to a wedding in santa monica and im staying at the hotel its at, because my parents are going to another wedding in hunington beach in the evening, so instead of driving back and forth, my sister and i get to order room service and do whatever we want. haha.

Today me, becca, and anna went to universal! We made different faces and poses each time we went on jurassic park or the mummy. It was really fun! We also saw and talked to dan,who works there and who i met with allia and zach today and even though he didnt remember us that well. When we went on jurassic park a second time (our last ride) we got to sit in the front and got soaked. We all smelled really bad because of the water in jurassic, but i took a shower so now its ok.

When we first got there (we enter from the back on the bottom) and no one was down there yet so we went on the mummy returns ride and we were the only people on the ride. It was soooooo cool. We went on the mummy 11 times, jurassic park 2 times and back to the future, shrek 4D, and the tram ride only 1. Only 2 people were rude to us this time. My sisters friend is gonna come over soon so im going to allias house to sleep over. And that concludes my awesome day at universal.

The movie was really really good also. It was at the arclight and the party was on the roof of the parking structure. It looked like a park and there was a dance floor and a cool dj and stuff like that. One of the bartenders hit on us though and that was kinda weird but whatever. We also hung out with allia's ""friend"" alex. Anyways it was soooooooo much fun!

Whenever we go to don cucos people tend to stare at us because we act so crazy. This time we were being total pyros and lighting chips or toasting them so they would get warm. After that we wanted to see willy wonka so we went to the movie theater but it was sold out so we just went back to her house. Today we went to paper bag princess (coolest store ever!) to look at dresses. After that we went to saks, urth cafe, marc jacobs, and american rag where i got really huge sunglasses to match allia's. At marc jacobs we saw nole marin and gamila talked to him and he is the nicest person ever! He's so fabulous. Well that concludes my wonderful day on the other side of the hill. Now i have to wait for my dad to come home from north carolina."

"event","BEST SONG EVER!

Century Plant

Outside my house is a cactus plant 
they call the century tree. 
Only once in a hundred years,
it flowers gracefully. 
And you never know when it will bloom. 

Hey! Do you wanna come out, 
and play the game?
It's never too late.

Hey! Do you wanna come out, 
and play the game?
It's never too late.

Clementine Hunter was fifty four
before she packed up and came.
Old Uncle Taylor was eighty one
when he rode his bike 
across the plains of China (Uh huh).

And the sun was shining 
on that day.
Just like today.

Do you wanna come out, 
and play the game? 
It's never too late. 
Hey! Do you wanna come out, 
and play the game?
It's never too late. 

Didn't know how to tell her
for over thirty years,
he kept locked up inside himself 
and no one saw the tears. 
And then she went away, 
and he woke up that day

Now he brings roses 
to his sweetheart, 
she lives most anywhere. 
He sees someone sufferin' 
he knows that despair. 
He offers them a rose 
and some quiet prose,
'bout dancin' in the shimmerin' ballroom. 
'Cause you never know when 
they will bloom. 

Hey! Do you wanna come out, 
and play the game? 
It's never too late. 
(To play the game)

Hey! Do you wanna come out, 
(Do you wanna come out)
and play the game?
(And play the game?)
It's never too late.
(It's never to late to play the game)

Hey! Do you wanna come out, 
(Do you wanna come out)
and play the game?
(and play the game?)
It's never too late.
(It's never too late yeah, yeah)

Hey! Do you wanna come out, 
and play the game?
(And play the game, play the game) 
It's never too late. 

Hey! Do you wanna come out,
and play the game?
(and play the game, play the game)
It's never too late. 
(It's never too late, never too late) 

Hey! Do you wanna come out, 
(Do you wanna come) 
and play the game?
(wanna come out and play the game)
It's never too late.
(It's never too late yeah yeah)

Hey! Do you wanna come out, 
(Do you wanna come out?)
and play the game? (Yeah, yeah)
It's never too late.
(Yeah, it's never to late yeah yeah)

Hey! Do you wanna come out, 
(Do you wanna come out)
and play the game?
(wanna come out, wanna come out?)
It's never too late..."

After that we played cards and rocked out to my i-pod (if you turn up the volume all the way it gets really loud.) This morning we watched camp and ate salad. We might hang out again later after her tutoring."

This morning though, we went to a brunch for the bat mitzvah. That was also pretty fun cause i made friends with the older sister michelle. After ellie's we went to the airport and returned the rental car. Thank god we flew cause i would not have lasted in the car for 6 hours. I dont think my parents could either."

There were lots of other games and dances for everyone to participate in. They gave out all these cool things like glow necklaces, wand things, blowup saxaphones and guitars ect. The best were the hats though. There were cowboy hats, indian hats, sailor hats, and firemen and construction hats. Sadly we weren't allowed to keep them so i have none to bring back. The food was also good. I come back tomorrow after a brunch and we visit with ellie again."

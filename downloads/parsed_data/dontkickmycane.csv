We write for the same publisher and I had a chance to go out for dinner with the author. It was an interesting and entertaining experience, for sure. I&#39;d do it again.

Now, about the book. I had already read the first book before meeting Rhys, and thought it was fantastic. After the meeting, I find now I can definitely hear the writer in the prose. If anything this has me appreciating book two even more. Plus, there is the way this narrator voices Jae-Min&#39;s voice. It&#39;s positively sinful.

Rhys has created some great characters, too. Like Mike, the main character Cole&#39;s brother. He is awesome. So very &nbsp;awesome. I&#39;ll tell you what. When he stood up for Cole, I wanted to stand up and cheer. I maybe did a little fist pump in the air. It was epic. I was a fan.


Then Rhys did this thing that had me texting Mary with &quot;W<em>hy????? Why, Mary, why do that?&quot;</em> Of course, I can&#39;t tell you what it was, because&nbsp;as River would say:<img alt=""RiverSongSpoilers"" class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-2258"" height=""168"" src=""http://jaime-samms.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/RiverSongSpoilers-300x168.jpg"" style=""line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px; float: right;"" width=""300"" />

I will say, at about two thirds of the way to the end, I&#39;m really enjoying the read.

ETA: I know why now, because I finished the book, but holy hell! It was terrible and wonderful all at the exact same time. Not so very many authors can manage that, so go Ms. Ford. Can&#39;t wait for book three."

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Cute Shoes. &#39;Nuff said</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">On to Amy lane and the boys from Johnnies.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><a href=""http://www.dreamspinnerpress.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=2780"" style=""line-height: 1.4;""><img alt=""ChaseinShadowLG"" class=""alignright  wp-image-2239"" height=""360"" src=""http://jaime-samms.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/ChaseinShadowLG.jpg"" style=""float: left;"" width=""240"" /></a>I&#39;ve read the three current offerings. I had put it off a long time because of the talk around how heart-rending Chase, from <em>Chase in Shadow</em> was rumoured to be. And yes, he was sad, confused and, bless him, pretty fucked in the head. Not a huge shock for an Amy Lane Character, truth be told. I was surprised that I managed to like him, though. I sort of thought I might have a hard time empathising, what with the girlfriend and the boyfriend at the same time, but Amy is kind of magical in that, as it turns out, liking him was not at issue. Also, I&#39;ve been suicidal, so I get that. And I thought the book would be too much. It wasn&#39;t. In fact, it turned out to be one of those instances where I thought...this is what all the angst and fuss has been about? Really, my heart kind of broke for Tommy more than for Chase. In the end, turns out, I was procrastinating for nothing. It was a fantastic book and I loved it, and it really didn&#39;t angst me out all that much.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><a href=""http://www.dreamspinnerpress.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=3250""><img alt=""DexInBlueLG"" class=""alignleft  wp-image-2240"" height=""360"" src=""http://jaime-samms.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/DexInBlueLG.jpg"" style=""float: right;"" width=""240"" /></a></p>
Enter Dex. Chapter one broke my ever-lovin&#39; heart. But having seen so much of Dex in Chase&#39;s book, I already knew he was sort of on his feet, if not quite perfect. So the heartbreak was not as deep as it might have been if I didn&#39;t already know the man who&#39;d grown from the boy in the first chapter of his own book. And Kane. I mean seriously. I want a Kane. There is nothing not to like about Kane. He&#39;s thoughtful, sweet, bossy, temperamental, maybe a bit unfocused and hard on himself, but overall, he&#39;s pretty damn near perfect. And from the first time getting to know him, there was never really a doubt in my mind that Kane was going make Dex a safe and secure place to not be in charge of every damn thing and person around him. They&#39;re just an awesome couple, and really, this was a truly feel-good book for me. Of all of them, this will be a re-read, for sure.

Ethan. Dear, sweet, broken, lonely Ethan. Just when I thought I was getting out of an entire Amy Lane series intact, along comes Ethan. And does anyone ever think to warn a girl about him? No. For the love of all that is sacred, people, why the hell not ?!?! Where is the solidarity? Where the compassion for your fellow readers?

I knew, from Chase and Dex&#39;s books, that Ethan was fragile and needy. Just the glimpses were enough to know that about him. But it didn&#39;t prepare me for the desert of emptiness that surrounds the man. From the moment we meet him as a five year old boy to the day he bumps into Jonah at the pet food store, there is a no-man&#39;s land of nothing around him. And that, my friends, is the thing that ripped me open and made me bleed. Like Kane, I never doubted Jonah for even a single moment. But unlike my certainty for Dex, I had moments where I wondered if even Jonah could cross that arid plane of ALONE to reach Ethan and make his world right. And you know that with Amy, sort of like with Joss Whedon, there&#39;s never a guarantee everyone makes it out alive, let alone unscathed. Certainly, I never get to the end of her stories unchanged as a reader. That, right there, is sort of what frightens me about her books, and, of course, what I cherish about her writing. The Johnnies Boys are no different. I&#39;ll be bracing myself for John himself. When his tale is told, I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;ll be a doozie."

"event","...at remembering to post here, (as evidenced by the nearly one year since the last post) I decided to share a free story I wrote a while back. I hope if anyone&#39;s still around to read it, that you like it :)

<p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpFirst"">Dust tickled my nose and I wiggled it, trying to stay focused. I wanted to get this damn critter out of there and get back to work before&mdash;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;Is there a problem?&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle""><i>Shit!<o:p></o:p></i></p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">The deep voice behind me made me jump, but I managed not to move my hand as, at last, the creature I was rescuing minced it&rsquo;s eight-legged way into the cup I held.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I replied, turning from the musty corner as I secured the strawless lid over the clear plastic juice cup.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; I glanced up&mdash;and up&mdash;from my crouch to peer at the man standing behind me. He was blond, I thought, and thin, but beyond that, too blurry from this distance for details. I slid my glasses back up my nose to see him better. Chiselled features filled my vision. And yes, he was blond, in that dirty, but sinshine-streaked delicious way. Muscled arms crossed over his chest and the sight made my mouth dry. I wasn&rsquo;t quite sure if it was in the good way, or the <i>good-God-that&rsquo;s-scary </i>way.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;You the new cleaner?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;Um.&rdquo; I rose, awkwardly, because he was closer than necessary, and I didn&rsquo;t have&nbsp; a lot of room to maneuver out from under the bars running across the center of the floor-to-ceiling mirrors. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; I held out my free hand, elbow bent awkwardly to keep the hand between us in the tight corner. The man didn&rsquo;t seem to have a sense of personal space and my dry mouth syndrome was leaning towards the scary end of the spectrum.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle""> &ldquo;Dusty,&rdquo; I told him, and winced, braced for the inevitable. A cleaner named Dusty. I&rsquo;d already heard all the variations there could possibly be, even in my three short months in this new job.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;Conrad Kosloff.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">Great. This was the boss. The guy who owned the ballet studio the company I worked for had been hired to clean. I&rsquo;d heard he was a true hard ass. He took my hand in his. And good God, he had <i>strong</i> hands. &ldquo;Dusty?&rdquo; He asked.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s short for Dustin&rdquo; I told him, pulling my hand back and wrapping it, along with the other, around the cup. It would come in a moment. The comment. Something about a mistake on my birth certificate. My mother being drunk, or a rabid fan of the actor, or some other insulting jibe about my unusual name.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;People often call me Connie.&rdquo; He shook his head. &ldquo;Or they ask if I&rsquo;m related to Theodore.&rdquo; He made a grim face. &ldquo;Because of course I&rsquo;m related to a dancer who died in the fifties, because I have the same last name and I dance, too. Makes sense, right?&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">I nodded, then realized he was being sarcastic, and shook my head so vigorously my glasses nearly flew off. I pushed them up my nose with a finger and blinked up at him. I barely came to his shoulder. Good God. He was <i>tall.</i></p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re lucky,&rdquo; he went on as he eyed the cup I was holding. &ldquo;Dustin is a cool name. Unusual, but I like it. What do you have in here?&rdquo; He tapped the lid of the cup then lifted my hand with two fingers under my wrist. His eyes narrowed as he squinted past the &ldquo;Starbucks&rdquo; logo to see the little critter crawling about inside.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;A s-spider.&rdquo; I pulled the cup against my chest. &ldquo;She was building a web in the corner. I thought the little girls might be&hellip;not like her. So I was just going to put her outside.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">He actually smiled. &ldquo;Sweet. Here.&rdquo; He gripped the top of the cup. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of her. You get the rest of the floor swept. Class starts in fifteen.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">I kept my hold on the cup, but so did he.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t hurt her. I&rsquo;ll put her out in the garden. I need the floors clean.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;O-of course, sir, Sorry.&rdquo; Relinquishing my rescuee, I snapped up the broom I&rsquo;d left on the floor. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get right on it.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;Relax, Dusty.&rdquo; His firm hand landed on my shoulder and he squeezed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all good. Just get it done so the girls can come in and warm up.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to call me sir.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo; I winced. &ldquo;Um. Mr&hellip;&rdquo; <i>Shit. </i>I&rsquo;d forgotten his last name. &ldquo;Oh God. I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; Mortified, I ducked my head and focused on the wide swath of the broom as I pushed it quickly away.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">Behind me, I heard a soft chuckle, then softer footsteps as Conrad walked out of the studio.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">Ten minutes later, he was back with my empty cup, which he held out. &ldquo;Did you need this back? I know some people like to recycle. I can put it in the kitchen to be washed if you like. I was headed that way. Do you drink coffee?&rdquo; This last he called over his shoulder as he headed for the door again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m making a cup, but I can make a pot, if you want some.&rdquo; He was still talking as his voice faded behind the wall and closing door.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">I strained to hear what he was saying, but didn&rsquo;t dare stop mopping to go find out. I relied on this job and the last thing I needed was a complaint that I hadn&rsquo;t finished it in a timely manner, or that I&rsquo;d interfered with the running of his business. My boss was a less than forgiving little Italian man who took his cleaning very seriously.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;Sorry, cream and sugar?&rdquo; he asked, poking his head back into the room.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">I jumped, glancing up and catching his reflection in the wall of glass. He had, literally, stuck his head back through the door and was watching me in the mirror.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;In your coffee,&rdquo; he clarified. &ldquo;Because I have milk and cream upstairs. I can go get it, if you want some. And I have sugar or honey. Can you hang around and mop the floor up after class? I&rsquo;ll pay extra. But if you have another job to go to, you can maybe do it tomorrow. Did you want coffee?&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">He was extraordinary. I&rsquo;d been told he was a bit of a grumpy man, and a severe instructor, but as I blinked at him and pushed my glasses into place, I was struck more by his constant babble. He didn&rsquo;t seem at all unfriendly.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;Um,&rdquo; I said, feeling heat once more creep up my neck. &ldquo;Coffee. Yes. Please. Black. With sugar is fine. Don&rsquo;t put yourself out. I can&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get cream.&rdquo; The door swung shut as he withdrew.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">With a sigh, I resumed the broom pushing. I liked cream in my coffee, sure, but I could do without. It was nice of him to make the effort.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">I was finished in the studio and had moved on to the kitchen to wash up the pile of drinking glasses left from the last class when he returned with a carton of cream and a ceramic coffee mug.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;Not fond of drinking from the paper cups,&rdquo; he said as he set the mug down beside another next to the pot. &ldquo;Brought one for you too. So. You new with Marcello&rsquo;s company? I haven&rsquo;t seen you before. Usually he sends Tiffany, which is fine, though she doesn&rsquo;t get into the corners and refuses to wash up after the girls. Not that I blame her. That really isn&rsquo;t part of the job, you know. Not necessary.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind. I like it here, and it&rsquo;s my last job for the day. I&rsquo;ll stay and help with the floor after, if you like.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;You sure? Because if you have something to do, I can manage. I usually do it again after Tiffany is done, just to be sure. I don&rsquo;t want anyone saying I don&rsquo;t run a clean studio. Besides, she doesn&rsquo;t use enough soap. I prefer the smell of the floor cleaner to the smell of dancers&rsquo; feet.&rdquo; He grinned and handed over a cup of coffee. &ldquo;You think hockey gear stinks, you should smell a studio after a dozen ballerinas take off their pointe shoes.&rdquo; He made a face. &ldquo;Something else. Sorry. Did you say you were new?&rdquo; A pleasant pink infused his cheeks. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t. Because I didn&rsquo;t shut up long enough for you to even open your mouth.&rdquo; He put his coffee to his lips and whispered a small &ldquo;Sorry&rdquo; into it as he blew.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;You are not what I expected,&rdquo; I confessed.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">His head tilted and he sipped. &ldquo;Really? Do tell.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">Now it was my turn to blush and hide behind the coffee cup. &ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; My voice came faint and I swallowed scalding coffee. &ldquo;Nothing. I shouldn&rsquo;t have said&mdash;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">He laughed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. I know what the girls say. I&rsquo;m a hard-ass.&rdquo; He winked. &ldquo;And I am. They need the discipline. Ballet is a hard life. Tough, nasty business. If I scare them away, they never would have made it anyway. The ones who like me are the ones who might have a chance. If they have the right body and an appetite for self-torture.&rdquo; He paused for a sip, then sighed. &ldquo;And want it very, very badly.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;Did you?&rdquo; I asked, and immediately wished I hadn&rsquo;t. Good God. How was that any of my business? &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">Instead of being angry, though, he smiled, maybe a little bit sadly. &ldquo;I did. Very badly. But I don&rsquo;t have the right turn out, and I hurt myself trying to get it.&rdquo; He shrugged. &ldquo;So now I teach. And I&rsquo;m good at it.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">He shrugged. &ldquo;I was, too. But I&rsquo;m not now. I&rsquo;m happy here. Do you need more coffee?&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;No. Thank you. I&rsquo;ll just finish up in here and you can let me know when you&rsquo;re ready for me to finish the floor.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">His smile was brilliant. &ldquo;Okay. I have to go teach.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo; I know I sounded soft and bewildered. It didn&rsquo;t really matter, because he was a bewildering sort of man. All angles and planes and harsh lines of him, filled out by all that talking, were utterly fascinating. His voice, though incessant, was smooth and low, and really, I could listen to it all day.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle""><o:p> </o:p></p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">In reality, I spent most of the hour and a half class in the kitchen where I couldn&rsquo;t hear what was going on in the studio. There was enough to organize and tidy to keep me occupied. I suppose it said something about me that I was perfectly content&mdash;happy, even&mdash;to be bringing some semblance of order to the teenage-girl/bachelor-pad chaos of the kitchen counters.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">Not that anything was actually dirty. Just&hellip;haphazard, with things piled so high on the countertop the appliances&mdash;toaster, microwave and coffee maker&mdash;were next to useless. And the cupboards were practically empty.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">So I spent the time wiping the cobwebs and dust off the cupboard shelves and arranging the cups and bowls in neat rows, finding the most convenient place for the coffee, filters and sugar, and rearranging the counter space to make the best use of what little of it there was.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">When I was done, everything would be plugged in and ready for use, and no one would have to shove piles of dishes and napkins and empty towel tubes out of the way to get to them.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">Besides. It all gave me something to do other than obsess over Conrad&rsquo;s biceps, spine-tingling height and gorgeously severe features. Sure he looked scary, but it was all backdrop for the exuberant chatter that so didn&rsquo;t jive with the tales of terror I&rsquo;d been told about the man.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">And then one of his dancers scrambled through the studio door and into the kitchen in a frantic shuffle, hyperventilating in that way that only someone trying hard not to cry did.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;Are you all right?&rdquo; I asked. I moved from the sink toward her, then thought better of it when her face crumpled and she lost the battle with her tears. Instead, I filled a cup with water and held it toward her, as though it could shield me from the heart-stopping awkwardness of the moment.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">She nodded and hiccupped as she took the water, gulped a sip down then let out another soft, crumpled wail.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;Oh. Dear.&rdquo; I bit my lip and searched for a napkin, which I handed to her. She took that too, without looking me in the face.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">She shook her head and dabbed at her eyes.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;Clara?&rdquo; Another young lady exited the studio and followed her sobs to the kitchen. &ldquo;Clara, you&rsquo;d better come back. He&rsquo;s going to close the door.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">Clara hiccupped again, swallowed more of the water and handed the cup and soggy napkin back to me. &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; She still hadn&rsquo;t lifted her gaze from the geometric pattern of the floor rug under my feet.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; I replied, uncertain if there was something else I should be doing.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">She didn&rsquo;t stay, but followed her friend back into the studio. I trailed after, going to the wall of windows between studio and office to see what was going on inside.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">A line of girls, hands laid delicately on the bar, studiously did not watch Clara and her friend retake their places. The music trickled through the studio door and thin walls and Conrad clapped his hands.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;Again!&rdquo; He had a log stick in his hand and he banged it on the floor as he counted to eight. &ldquo;Pli&egrave;, Relev&egrave;!&rdquo; he swooped an arm into the air on the last word. &ldquo;Clara, Clara! Stop!&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">The poor girl froze, one arm raised in a graceful arch over her head, her chin lifted, her weight balanced delicately, but firmly on the very tips of her pink shoes. In fact, all the students remained immobile in the exact same pose, some straining not to wobble, others rolling their eyes as the music trickled to a halt and the piano player shook her head.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;Turn <i>out</i> Clara, and pull that stomach in!&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">She shifted her foot the barest hint of a turn and sucked her stomach up under her ribs. It was a barely perceptible change, but it seemed to satisfy Conrad because he nodded. &ldquo;Continue. And one and...&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">The music began again and the students resumed their sequence. Clara faced straight ahead, ignoring the fading tracks of the tears on her cheeks and the scrutiny from her teacher. She focused on the movement and maybe didn&rsquo;t even notice when Conrad examined her final pose and nodded slightly in satisfaction.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;Thank you, ladies,&rdquo; he said after another ten or so minutes of what looked like torture for the girls, and a short but lovely sequence of arm movements that ended in synchronized, elegant bows to where he stood in front before the mirrors.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">Everyone smiled and clapped, including Clara, and she offered him another, extra curtsy as she minced from the studio.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">I hurried back to the kitchen before the flood of giggling young women swamped the office.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle""><o:p> </o:p></p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">They all cleared out in a relative hurry after that, and I was left in the suddenly very quiet building with Conrad who was straightening his awkwardly piled CD collection and gathering abandoned drinking cups from the studio floor.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">He brought them to the kitchen and smiled when he saw me.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re still here.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;Well.&rdquo; I frowned. &ldquo;Yes. I thought we were going to mop the studio floor. You asked for help.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;Yes. I did. I thought you&rsquo;d come back after class. I didn&rsquo;t expect you to hang around&hellip;&rdquo; His gaze travelled over the cleared countertop and the polished appliances. &ldquo;What on earth? Did you do this? That wasn&rsquo;t necessary, Dusty. I never expected.&rdquo; He swallowed and offered me a crooked, but uncertain smile. &ldquo;Please. Let Marcello know I&rsquo;ll pay for the extra time. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;No!&rdquo; I held up a hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Please. Don&rsquo;t say anything to him. Please.&rdquo; Marcello would not take kindly to the thought I might have tried to pad his bill. He prided himself on his honesty and the integrity of his workers. He would see this as me trying to squeeze more money than he had contracted out of the studio owner, and that would get me fired.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll want to know&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just, I would have had to bicycle home and then back. It wasn&rsquo;t worth it to go, so I stayed. I didn&rsquo;t want to sit around and do nothing. I would have been bored. Besides, it looks better. More functional. And I didn&rsquo;t mind doing it. It was something to do. Really.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">Now I was the one rambling, and Conrad was staring at me, eyes wide and mouth open slightly, like he was trying to say something, just waiting for me to give him an opening long enough to interject.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">I stopped for a breath and it was enough for him, because he jumped in. &ldquo;Then thank you. I&rsquo;ve been meaning to get to it, but I&rsquo;m down here seems like twenty hours a day, and by the time I&rsquo;m done teaching, I just want to be away from this place for a few hours before I fall into bed, and the clean up always seems to end up at the bottom of the list of things to get done. Hey. I have a toaster? When did I get a toaster? Was this here?&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">I nodded.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">He had wandered over and now he depressed the lever on the appliance and chuckled when it flipped back up again. &ldquo;Well I&rsquo;ll be. Lindsay will be pleased. She&rsquo;s always complaining about having to eat her tomato sandwiches on raw bread. And you cleaned the coffee maker, too. You didn&rsquo;t have to do that. I would have done that after class. It&rsquo;s the one thing I&rsquo;m sort of religious about. Clean coffee maker. You want another cup? Where is the coffee, anyway?&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">I held up a hand and he pulled back a fraction.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;Oh. I&rsquo;m doing it again.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">I nodded.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;Sorry. How many questions did I not give you a chance to answer this time?&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">I couldn&rsquo;t help a smile. &ldquo;Just a few. Yes, you have a toaster. I don&rsquo;t know when you got it, but it was here, under a few bags of napkins and paper plates and there was a note to Lindsay on it&rdquo;&mdash;which I handed him&mdash;&ldquo;and I did notice the coffee maker was rather pristine. No, thank you, I don&rsquo;t need another cup, but I can make you one if you like. The coffee is in the cupboard above the coffee maker.&rdquo; I reached up and took it down for him, prepared to make another pot, but he took the canister from me.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">He looked slightly uncomfortable as he shook his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got this. How about you get started in the studio? I didn&rsquo;t quite get everything off the floor. Once I&rsquo;ve got this going, I&rsquo;ll bring the bucket and a couple of mops.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">I shrugged. &ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. It&rsquo;s a thing with me. I&rsquo;m sort of anal about my coffee. It isn&rsquo;t personal.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo; I smiled and pointed to the filters, which he took down.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said, his voice low and soft. &ldquo;I appreciate this.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing. I sort of like bringing order to the chaos. Makes me feel&rdquo;&hellip;<i>Needed. Useful. Competent at something</i>&hellip; &ldquo;accomplished.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">I beat a hasty retreat before he could say anything to that, because to me, it sounded as pathetic as all the things I hadn&rsquo;t said.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">I had cleared everything off the floor when he finally joined me, two cups of coffee in hand. He handed me one with an apologetic shrug. &ldquo;Just in case.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">It was warm and the smell, hazelnut, I thought, was heavenly. I accepted and sipped. &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">His smile was radiant, and he practically skipped to the stereo. &ldquo;We need cleaning music,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;Beethoven? Bach?&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;Mozart?&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">One brow dashed up, but he nodded. &ldquo;Something light.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;Fantasia!&rdquo; I said suddenly, remembering the scene with Mickey Mouse and his brooms gone wild.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">Conrad stopped in the act of opening a CD and stared at me.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">Good God. I&rsquo;d done it again. Completely let my idiotic weirdness spill out all over the room.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">But he grinned wide and clapped. &ldquo;Perfect!&rdquo; He put away the CD he&rsquo;d been opening and rifled through his collection until he&rsquo;d found the one I&rsquo;d asked for, which he put on.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">Music blared through the room and he pirouetted off to fetch the bucket and mops, admonishing me to stay put and finish my coffee while it was still hot. I finished getting everything up off the floor that I could and by the time he was back, I&rsquo;d managed to ready the room for the chore ahead.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle""><o:p> </o:p></p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">I was used to working in soothing silence. I liked my job well enough, and the quiet of closed office buildings and schools was calming. Tonight, though, there would be no such relaxing calm. Tonight, there was constant chatter under the music, a stream of what I quickly realized were rhetorical questions and incidental comments that didn&rsquo;t really require more of a response than the simple acknowledgement that I was listening. I got the feeling Conrad prattled like this whether he had an audience or not, and when he occasionally looked up and caught my eye, there was such a look of contentment on his face I thought maybe he wasn&rsquo;t quite used to having an audience.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">The mopping up was quick, though, and I was sorry to see the task end.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">Conrad, however, looked exhausted by the time we were done.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;Are you all right?&rdquo; I asked as he slumped into his office chair.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">I had squeezed out one mop and was headed back for the other as he opened his laptop.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;Long day.&rdquo; He smiled at me, and the expression was genuine, it seemed. &ldquo;Most days are. It&rsquo;s a great job, but demanding. Harder on days like today when I get those glimpses, like with Clara, that they can do something if they just make that extra effort.&rdquo; He had logged into his computer and glanced at me. &ldquo;You on Facebook?&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">For once it wasn&rsquo;t a rhetorical question, I realized, when he held my gaze, calmly waiting for my reply, and I nodded. &ldquo;Dustin Jordanson,&rdquo; I replied automatically. &ldquo;One of those Disney brooms from Fantasia is my user pic.&rdquo; A soft heat crept into my face.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">Conrad grinned wide and turned his attention back to the computer.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s frustrating, you know,&rdquo; he said as he typed and clicked, &ldquo;seeing how close they are to getting it, and how they just don&rsquo;t push that extra little bit to get there.&rdquo; He was talking about the dancers again, I realized, even as he typed and scanned the computer screen. &ldquo;And then I think, that&rsquo;s what my teacher did. Pushed and pushed until I hurt myself&hellip;&rdquo; He shook his head. &ldquo;But I know she can do it if she focuses. It&rsquo;s tough at that age. Stuck between this huge, impossible dream and school and parents and a cute boy.&rdquo; He winked at me. &ldquo;I can sympathize with that last one.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">I flushed. The heat didn&rsquo;t crawl, or seep up my neck, this time. It thundered, right up under my hairline and I grabbed the handle of the bucket, the mop, and scurried for the kitchen sink.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">I was cleaning up the mess of the water I&rsquo;d splashed all over the floor in my haste when I felt his presence at my back.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;Need help?&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;No. It&rsquo;s fine. I&rsquo;ll be out of your hair in just another minute, sir.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;I told you not to call me sir. Call me Conrad. Or Connie, if you like.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;No, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t tell me it was your birthday.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t. Wait. What?&rdquo; I set the rag I&rsquo;d been using down and turned to face him. He was leaning in the kitchen doorway, arms crossed over his chest, a lazy smile on his face. Good God, but he was a beautiful man. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the tenth. My birthday is on the tenth. Saturday.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;Today is the tenth.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;No, I&hellip;is it?&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">He nodded.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;You forgot your own birthday?&rdquo; His smile slipped, slumped into a frown. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t anyone wish you a happy birthday, Dustin?&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">I shook my head, pushed my glasses up my nose, because they had slipped, making him fuzzy again. His expression was hard to read.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;That is unacceptable.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">I shrugged. Who would wish me a happy birthday? Sure a few people had probably posted something on my wall on Facebook, but I&rsquo;d been working all day. I hadn&rsquo;t really had an opportunity to look. My family had long ago stopped trying to wish me straight, stopped trying to talk me into being one of them, stopped trying, period. My coworkers thought I was a bit odd, and I hadn&rsquo;t had this job long anyway. I usually took the individual jobs. I liked the peace and quiet. My friends&mdash;well. I took a sharp breath, my nostrils flaring at the sudden pain in my chest.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;No one called?&rdquo; He wasn&rsquo;t leaning in the doorway anymore, but was gliding across the floor, arms still crossed, face stern.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">I shook my head again.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just. Nothing.&rdquo; I tried to duck past him out of the small room, but he stopped me with a hand on my arm. It was a firm touch, but not a forceful one.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;Happy birthday, Dustin.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">I nodded and shoved my glasses into place. &ldquo;Thank you. I should go.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">He let me go and I collected my coat and shoes, even though he followed my every move and stood over me as I bent to tie the laces. &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; he said at last just as my fingers came into contact with the door handle.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;I really should&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;Do you dance?&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;Good God, no.&rdquo; I flushed again, pushed my glasses into place and looked back at him. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to do this. It&rsquo;s just a birthday. No big deal.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;Come and dance with me.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">I shook my head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t. Can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; I backed against the door, against freedom from his smouldering gaze, but for some reason, I didn&rsquo;t take the escape.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll play Mozart for you, if you like.&rdquo; He smiled, a soft, happy expression. &ldquo;Or the bit from Fantasia with the centaurs.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">Full on blushing commenced. &ldquo;You know no one knows anything other than the dancing hippo and the brooms, right?&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">He smiled wider. &ldquo;You know.&rdquo; He winked. &ldquo;I know.&rdquo; Turning to the stereo, he zinged through the music and watched the timer until he reached the point he wanted. &ldquo;Here.&rdquo; He pressed play and held his hand out to me. &ldquo;Please. One dance.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">Guys like this did not ask me to dance. He was being nice because I clearly had no friends on my birthday. I had organized his cupboards and mopped his floor as social entertainment. On my birthday. How lame was that?</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;Please, Dustin. I have no one who&rsquo;s birthday I can celebrate. Let me do this with you?&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">Well. Didn&rsquo;t that put things in a different perspective suddenly. I gave him my hand and&nbsp; kicked off my shoes, stumbling over the one I had already forgotten was laced .</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">He chuckled as he caught me, and soothed the ruffle to my ego with a smooth glide of his hand down my back until it rested on my waist. The music swelled around us and he took a long stride backward. I&rsquo;m sure I was meant to follow. I stood, rooted to the spot and we both stumbled and crashed, less than gracefully, into one another as we caught our balance.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;Are you all right?&rdquo; he asked as he struggled to contain real laughter.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">I burned with shame and tried to extricate my hand from his. &ldquo;Fine. I told you I can&rsquo;t do this.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;Then I will teach you.&rdquo; He gripped my fingers harder and planted his hand on me more firmly, sliding it around to cradle the small of my back. &ldquo;It is what I do, after all.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">There was very little space between us, with his hand on my back like that, and I was sure he would feel the sweat trickling down my spine any moment. It would disgust him. I squirmed to get a step away, to get that hand safely back on my hip, but he smiled and moved his head closer to mine.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;Relax, Dustin. Dancing is a dirty business.&rdquo; His breath brushed at the hair over my ear, disturbing it, sending a shiver over my skin. &ldquo;If you aren&rsquo;t breaking a sweat, you aren&rsquo;t doing it right.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;Good God,&rdquo; I whispered. &ldquo;Conrad, please&hellip;&rdquo; I had no idea what I was asking for.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">His lips brushed the upper shell of my ear. &ldquo;Please what, Dustin?&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">I closed my eyes and fought the urge to melt into him. &ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">His cheek pressed firmly to my temple. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, either, Dustin, I promise you that. Just dance.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">I&rsquo;d get fired. Marcello would have my ass in a sling if he found out about this. I&rsquo;d lose the last job anyone was likely to hire a guy like me to do. I&rsquo;d lose my room, my food stamps. I&rsquo;d have nothing. Panic closed my throat and I whimpered for lack of breath.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;Why are you shaking?&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t move away, but his body language changed from swaying sensual sweeps to guarded, more contained.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;Please. I have to go,&rdquo; I whispered. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do this.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;You are so afraid.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t dance. I can&rsquo;t lose my job.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">His hands tightened on me and I felt a smile press to my temple. &ldquo;You are no longer working. The day is over. Now, this is me, a man, very attracted to you, and the attraction, I think, is mutual?&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle""><i>Good God, yes. </i> I swallowed hard.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">He stopped dancing and took one small step back so he could look down on me.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">My glasses had slipped again so I couldn&rsquo;t make out the details of his expression, but the smile he wore seemed hazy even without the fog of my poor vision. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; I asked him. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;Is it mutual?&rdquo; He asked.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; I swallowed another shocking retort and softened my voice. &ldquo;Yes. It&rsquo;s mutual. But&hellip;I can&rsquo;t take the chance. Marcello is so&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">His smile grew, flashed across his face and fell away again. &ldquo;I know about Marcello. He will have a fit. But he will not fire you. He is not an ogre.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">I was skeptical, and he must have read that because he touched the corner of my mouth with the fingers of his hand, still joined to mine.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;We understand each other, he and I, Dustin. He called this afternoon and told me he was sending a new cleaner. One I might find more agreeable than Tiffany. One I wouldn&rsquo;t mind if he didn&rsquo;t clean the corners.&rdquo; He snickered softly. &ldquo;When I asked him what he meant, he said to wait and see when I met you, and I would understand.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m good at my job,&rdquo; I protested. It didn&rsquo;t matter that it was a menial one. It gave me pleasure to do it, and to do it right. He&rsquo;d see that, if he gave me a chance.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;I have no doubt you are. Marcello has very good instincts. He was right. If you never cleaned a single cobweb from my studio, I wouldn&rsquo;t care. He&rsquo;s a very smart man. I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s why he gave you this contract.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;Then why?&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">But Conrad was smiling slyly and pulling me back close to him again.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;You mean he was trying to set us up?&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">&ldquo;Perhaps he was acknowledging your birthday in his own belligerent Italian way. And reminding me there is more to life than dancing.&rdquo;</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle"">And as he said that, he swung me around that studio floor and for those few, precious moments, it was like my feet didn&rsquo;t even touch the ground.</p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle""><o:p> </o:p></p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle""><o:p> </o:p></p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle""><o:p> </o:p></p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpMiddle""><o:p> </o:p></p><p class=""DreamspinnerCxSpLast""><o:p> </o:p></p>"

"event","I am ecstatic. Obviously because my friend Ariel has another book out, and I have yet to meet a book of her&#39;s I didn&#39;t like. This is the third book in her Lang Downs series, and (I confess) while I have yet to read them, I feel&nbsp;like&nbsp;I know these guys already, because she talks about them <em>all. The. Time. </em>And they sound so awesome. And really, how can I blame her, when I&#39;m sure she feels pretty much the same listening to me whine (which she doesn&#39;t do, that&#39;s just me) about my latest difficult made-up people.

Anyway, even having not had the chance to read the books yet, which stems, in part, from my desire to have them all ready to read, ie: written, before I start the first one, what I do know about the sheep station&nbsp;in Australia she&#39;s called Lang Downs and all the men living there is enough for me to say; this is going to be another heart-warming read.

Office manager Sam Emery is unemployed and out of luck. When his emotionally abusive wife demands a divorce, he contacts the one person he has left, his brother, Neil. He doesn&rsquo;t expect Neil to reject him, but he also doesn&rsquo;t expect the news of his divorce&mdash;and of his sexuality&mdash;to be met with such acceptance.

Neil takes Sam to Lang Downs, the sheep station Neil calls home. There, Sam learns that life as a gay man isn&rsquo;t impossible. Caine and Macklin, the station owners, certainly seem to be making it work. When Caine offers Sam a job, it&rsquo;s a dream come true.

Jeremy Taylor leaves the only home he&rsquo;s ever known when his brother&rsquo;s homophobia becomes more than he can bear. He goes to the one place he knows he will be accepted: Lang Downs. He clicks with Sam instantly&mdash;but the animosity between Lang Downs and Jeremy&rsquo;s home station runs deep, and the jackaroos won&rsquo;t accept Jeremy without a fight. Between Sam&rsquo;s insecurity and Jeremy&rsquo;s precarious position, their road will be a hard one&mdash;and that&rsquo;s without having to wait for Sam&rsquo;s divorce to be final before starting a new life together.

<strong>Excerpt:</strong>

<em>&ldquo;Bloody hell,&rdquo; Neil spat. &ldquo;What is he doing here?&rdquo;</em>

<em>Before Sam could ask what that meant, Neil was striding across the room. The man who had caught Sam&rsquo;s eye saw him coming and stood, hands at his side but clearly braced for a fight. A third man, one who looked as hard as the granite beneath their feet, interrupted Neil&rsquo;s progress. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t blame one man for his brother&rsquo;s faults.&rdquo;</em>

<em>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he doing here?&rdquo; Neil repeated.</em>

<em>&ldquo;Working,&rdquo; the older man said. &ldquo;Caine hired him this morning, so unless you want to argue with him over it, back off.&rdquo;</em>

<em>Sam tensed, knowing how badly Neil reacted to those kinds of orders when his temper was high. His jaw dropped when Neil shook himself and took a step back. &ldquo;If Caine hired him, I won&rsquo;t make trouble, but if he starts anything, I will finish it.&rdquo;</em>

<em>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fair, Macklin,&rdquo; the other man said from his place against the wall. &ldquo;You know I&rsquo;m not going to start anything, so as long as he keeps his word, we&rsquo;ll be square.&rdquo;</em>

<em>&ldquo;I keep my word, Taylor,&rdquo; Neil ground out. &ldquo;Unlike some people.&rdquo;</em>

<em>&ldquo;Neil, that&rsquo;s enough.&rdquo; Another man entered the conversation, a younger one, with short dark hair and an American accent. Sam figured that must be Caine. &ldquo;Jeremy asked for a place to stay and a job after he left Taylor Peak. I&rsquo;ve given him that. I&rsquo;d appreciate it if you respect that.&rdquo;</em>

<em>&ldquo;Yes, boss. I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</em>

<em>&ldquo;Introduce me to your brother.&rdquo;</em>

<em>&ldquo;Caine, this is my brother, Sam. Sam, my boss, Caine Neiheisel.&rdquo;</em>

<em>&ldquo;Nice to meet you, sir,&rdquo; Sam said, even though Caine was probably Sam&rsquo;s age. He owed the man the roof over his head and maybe a job. Sam planned to mind his manners.</em>

<em>&ldquo;Please, call me Caine. We aren&rsquo;t formal here. Welcome to Lang Downs.&rdquo;</em>

<em>&ldquo;Thank you. I appreciate you letting me stay for a while.&rdquo;</em>

<em>Caine smiled, and Sam felt warmth bloom inside at the kindness he saw there. It wasn&rsquo;t sexual. Sam knew Caine was with Macklin, and if Macklin was indeed the man who had kept Neil from attacking Taylor, Caine wouldn&rsquo;t look twice at someone like Sam. It felt almost familial, like he&rsquo;d been adopted and hadn&rsquo;t known it. &ldquo;Get something to eat and get settled in tonight. Tomorrow I&rsquo;d like to talk to you. I have some questions, and Neil thought you might be able to help.&rdquo;</em>

<em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy to help,&rdquo; Sam said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know a lot about sheep, but other than industry-specific regulations, the laws don&rsquo;t vary that much from one business to another. I should be able to help you out. And if I can&rsquo;t, I might know someone who can get the information we need.&rdquo;</em>

<em>&ldquo;Good to hear,&rdquo; Caine said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk about it after breakfast tomorrow. Did Neil warn you what time the day starts around here?&rdquo;</em>

<em>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Sam said.</em>

<em>&ldquo;Early,&rdquo; Neil replied. &ldquo;Breakfast is at five. You don&rsquo;t have to come down then, but if you don&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;ll only get cold cereal. Kami has no patience with people who don&rsquo;t get their lazy arses out of bed.&rdquo;</em>

<em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be up,&rdquo; Sam said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want anyone to have to go out of their way for me.&rdquo;</em>

<em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to finish my dinner,&rdquo; Caine said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look for you both in the morning.&rdquo;</em>

<em>Sam turned back to Neil as Caine walked back to where he had been sitting before Neil exploded. Sam would ask again later about Taylor and the reasons behind Neil&rsquo;s animosity. For now, the food smelled delicious, and Sam was getting hungry.</em>

<em>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s for dinner?&rdquo; he asked, smiling at the aborigine behind the counter when he approached.</em>

<em>&ldquo;Wombat curry,&rdquo; the man&mdash;Kami, Sam thought Neil had said&mdash;replied.</em>

<em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never had wombat before,&rdquo; Sam said, holding his plate while Kami ladled a thick stew onto his plate.</em>

<em>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t having it now either,&rdquo; Neil said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s either beef or mutton, probably mutton. Kami likes to take the piss with blow-ins.&rdquo;</em>

<em>&ldquo;And I fell for it.&rdquo;</em>

<em>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not the first, and you won&rsquo;t be the last,&rdquo; Kami said. &ldquo;You want some naan with the curry?&rdquo;</em>

<em>&ldquo;Kami makes it fresh,&rdquo; Neil said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as good as anything you ever got in town.&rdquo;</em>

<em>&ldquo;Sure, I&rsquo;ll have a piece,&rdquo; Sam said. It wouldn&rsquo;t hurt to get on Kami&rsquo;s good side. The man would be feeding him for the foreseeable future. Better that Kami like him.</em>

<em>They found a seat at a table with several other men and a pretty woman who smacked Neil on the back of the head as soon as he sat down. &ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; she demanded.</em>

<em>&ldquo;Not here, Molly, please,&rdquo; Neil said.</em>

<em>Sam hid his snicker behind a bite of curry. He had never imagined Neil looking quite so henpecked. &ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; Molly said, &ldquo;but we will discuss this when we get home.&rdquo;</em>

<em>Neil looked so mortified that Sam took pity on him. &ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Sam, Neil&rsquo;s brother.&rdquo;</em>

<em>Molly looked like she wanted to smack Neil again. &ldquo;No manners,&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;Nice to meet you, Sam. I&rsquo;m Molly. Welcome to Lang Downs.&rdquo;</em>

<em>&ldquo;Thank you. Everyone has been very kind.&rdquo;</em>

<em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that kind of place,&rdquo; Molly said, &ldquo;which is why we&rsquo;re going to discuss Neil&rsquo;s outburst later. He&rsquo;s second in line behind Macklin. He can&rsquo;t go around acting stupid, or he&rsquo;s going to lose his place.&rdquo;</em>

<em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Jeremy Taylor,&rdquo; Neil said. &ldquo;What was I supposed to think?&rdquo;</em>

<em>&ldquo;That your bosses pay enough attention to who&rsquo;s in their canteen to realize he was there and that if they know he&rsquo;s there and don&rsquo;t have a problem with it, you shouldn&rsquo;t either?&rdquo; Molly suggested.</em>

<em>&ldquo;Taylor?&rdquo; Sam repeated. &ldquo;Like the neighboring station?&rdquo;</em>

<em>&ldquo;Yes, that Taylor,&rdquo; Neil said. &ldquo;Well, the younger brother, but that family. I said I wouldn&rsquo;t start anything, and I won&rsquo;t, but I don&rsquo;t trust him. Devlin Taylor wouldn&rsquo;t know good management if it bit him in the arse.&rdquo;</em>

<em>Sam glanced at Taylor across the room, wondering what had led the other man to leave his home and come here instead. Taylor rose as Sam was looking that way, dumped his plate in the bin of dirty dishes, and headed outside. Sam couldn&rsquo;t help but think the man looked lonely.</em>

 

Awww. I can tell I&#39;m going to really like Sam. Anyway, if you want to know more about Ariel, here are her links:

"event","I&#39;ve invited Victoria Bliss over today. I&#39;m sure lots of us are familiar with her own Friends Friday posts., I&#39;ve popped in there myself quite a few times, and her Sunday Snog loops,&nbsp;which&nbsp;are always fun,&nbsp;especially&nbsp;if you&#39;re like me and love the moment in the romance when they finally kiss for the first time...So today, Victoria dropped by here to share her new release with everyone. Enjoy!!!

<b>Getting Real.</b>

I deal in fiction, just to be clear. Rob and Lou&rsquo;s Wild Weekends may read a little like Lou&rsquo;s diary, but it is not a true to life document. However, I did set about writing about a really believable couple when I wrote the 4 stories that make up the bulk of my anthology.

It is always fun to write about crazy imaginative things like vampires and werewolves and billionaires but I thought it&rsquo;d be fun to write a story about a couple you could walk past in the street. We all have different parts to our personas and I had great fun delving into the kinky side of Rob and Lou. I hope people reading realise that anyone can spice up their sex life, it just takes a little imagination.

<b>Introduction to Rob and Lou</b>.

Robert Nimble is thirty-five years old, he&rsquo;s tech support for a large Internet host, and loves to play computer games to relax. He&rsquo;s married to Louise Nimble, who&rsquo;s a child minder, and a year younger than her husband. She bakes to unwind. Taking the old adage that stressed is desserts spelt backwards to heart.

Robert and Louise are more often known by the shortenings of their names&mdash;Rob and Lou. They&rsquo;ve been married for ten years and have two children: Connor, who is six, and Elizabeth, who&rsquo;s four.&nbsp; They live in a terraced house in a suburban outskirt of Manchester. As a family, they enjoy their yearly week-long holiday to Scarborough, and visits to the cinema to watch films that the kids and adults giggle at in equal measure.&nbsp; In the school holidays, they&rsquo;ll often be found in museums and parks, enjoying the culture and the beauty of Britain.

They&rsquo;re a smiley family, although Rob can get grumpy when his tech genius isn&rsquo;t taken seriously enough, and Lou may have the patience of a saint with children, but more than two hours with her in-laws has her pulling out her hair. The children are mostly well-behaved, with an inclination to the curious, and the mischief that goes hand in hand with that. If they do run into the back of your legs, or scare you with their latest pet insect, they will apologise politely and you&rsquo;re likely to instantly forgive them.

This book is not about the day-to-day life of this family, but those weekends and rare occasions that Lou and Rob get some time to themselves to indulge their sensual natures. Rob enjoys seeing his darling wife in very little clothing, and likes to indulge in intricate and imaginative role plays. Lou enjoys a bit of spanking, some domination, and bondage. She wouldn&rsquo;t say she was into BDSM, per se; she just likes to dip a toe in the shallow end of that particularly pervy pond.&nbsp; They both like to flirt with erotic danger, playing about in public places in hopes of possibly being caught.

Rob and Lou&rsquo;s Wild Weekends are just that, so hold on and enjoy the ride.

&nbsp;Blurb: Hold on tight, it&rsquo;s going to get wild! Rob and Lou could pass you in the streets and you&rsquo;d likely not notice them. They&rsquo;re in their thirties, have a family and jobs to hold down and they do it with smiles on their faces. But occasionally they get a little time off and that&rsquo;s when things get seriously sexy.

Light-hearted and fun, this mini-anthology features episodes from this couple&rsquo;s wild weekends. Making the most of the mud, finding the erotic nature of an apron and even having a sexy visit to a fish and chip shop. Rob and Lou make the mundane much more pleasurable so join them on their kinky ride.

Includes a bonus short story Damsel in Distress and excerpts from other ebooks by the award winning queen of rosy, raunchy and rubenesque erotic romance, Victoria Blisse.

<div style=""text-align: center;""><b>Mud is Good and Wetter is Better.</b></div>
&ldquo;I told you this was a fucking bad idea,&rdquo; I yelled. &ldquo;How the hell did I let you convince me to go camping on a bank holiday?&rdquo;

&ldquo;If I remember rightly, you were the one who suggested borrowing my brother&rsquo;s tent.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rob pulled the door flaps closed and shook the water off his anorak.

&ldquo;I was just being polite,&rdquo; I grumbled. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d actually lend it to us.&rdquo;

&ldquo;And they&rsquo;ve taken the kids for the long weekend. We really shouldn&rsquo;t grumble.&rdquo;

&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s cold and it&rsquo;s wet and it&rsquo;s miserable and I want to go home.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Well, Lou, we could do that but&mdash;&rdquo;

&ldquo;But what?&rdquo; I threw my hands in the air. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me you&rsquo;re actually enjoying this.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Well, no, that&rsquo;s not it. It&rsquo;s just that, erm, well. Just look out the tent flap and check out the car.&rdquo;

I muttered and mumbled, shot evils at my darling husband, and crawled past him to look out into the storm. He passed me a torch so I could see into the murk. It wasn&rsquo;t really late, but the storm had brought darkness early, and even though it was the middle of August, it felt like a dark, oppressive winter night.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d told Rob it would be a bad idea. It would rain, I&rsquo;d be cold, but he didn&rsquo;t listen. He wanted to go on a grand adventure. Something deep inside him ached to sleep under the stars, separated from nature by a bit of whippy canvas. Being the good and loving wife I am, I gave in. Also, Rob&rsquo;s brother and his girlfriend had happily acquiesced to have our kids for the weekend, so I was looking forward to some adult alone time, even if it did mean I had to wear my thermals in the middle of summer.

When I spied our well-loved family car standing where we parked it, surrounded by a quagmire of mud, I really did wish I&rsquo;d persuaded Rob to stay at home and just <i>pretend</i> we went camping. We&rsquo;d not be stuck in the wild in the middle of a thunderstorm then.&nbsp; We&rsquo;d be rolling around in bed, eating snacks we don&rsquo;t let the children eat, and fucking with abandon.

&ldquo;Fuck.&rdquo; I cursed. &ldquo;I told you we should have parked it in the car park.&rdquo;

&ldquo;You did no such thing,&rdquo; Rob exclaimed. &ldquo;You dragged me in here and fucked my brains out.&rdquo;

He was quite right, I had. Well, he looked all sexy with his sweat-beaded brow. I&rsquo;d enjoyed watching him pitch the tent. It involved a lot of bending over, and my husband has a bloody gorgeous arse. I spent my time pretending to help, but really I was ogling his body and thinking wicked thoughts about having my way with him. So, instead of telling him we needed to park on the tarmac at the car park, I kissed him and pulled him into the tent. I didn&rsquo;t strip him, I just opened his trousers. I had to struggle out of my own jeans so I could only watch him stroke his cock for a frustratingly long time, but as soon as I could I climbed on top of him. I pushed him down and straddled his waist. The scent of the crushed grass, mixed with his musk was so primal that it added excitement to what we were doing. I pushed down until I felt him stretch me. It was a heady mix and made me feel connected to nature in some kind of primitive way.

"event","I thought I would try something a little bit different today. A sort of spotlight on an author I&#39;m just getting to know and who&#39;s books, while I haven&#39;t had the leisure time to read yet, have got me really intrigued. I briefly talked about Times Square Queers a couple of posts ago over <a href=""http://dontkickmycane.livejournal.com/169798.html"" target=""_blank"">on my LiveJurnal</a>, but that got me interested to go search out what else Mykola has on&nbsp;the&nbsp;go and I came across his blog and more books! Who doesn&#39;t need more books, am I right?

<span data-mce-mark=""1"" style=""line-height: 24px;"">Although, I&nbsp;admittedly</span><span data-mce-mark=""1"" style=""line-height: 24px;""> ostly lurk on the forum Myck most appears on, since that particular forum is chuck full of authors I greatly admire and that brings out my shy in a big way, I&#39;ve noticed he seems to be a pretty soft-spoken, understated kind of guy. Or maybe that&#39;s cyberspace mellowing him a bit :) All I know is that he seems to be a kind heart and a well-spoken man </span>

So first, here&#39;s a bit about him that I lifted from one of his publishers, JMS Books:
<blockquote>
<h1>About Mykola Dementiuk</h1>
A Ukrainian born in West Germany, Mykola (Mick) Dementiuk grew up and survived on New York&#39;s tough Lower East Side streets, which are now a bare echo of what they once were. He is the author o <i>Holy Communion</i> Lambda Awards Winner 2010/Bisexual Fiction) <i>Vienna Dolorosa, Times Queer,</i> n <i>100 Whores</i>.

&quot;I started going out early with girls and guys, not for sex because at that age, who the hell knew what sex was?&quot;

With those words, Danny&#39;s coming-of-age begins. From the gloomy, stifling hallways of high school in the 1960&#39;s to the vast expanse of 1970&#39;s New York, young Danny explores the complexities of love and lust in the arms of Luba, a girl he believes himself in love with, and then in the company of various men, from whom he learns his true nature.

Raised by a poor, single mother whose upcoming marriage to a second husband threatens Danny&#39;s shaky world, Danny finds that accepting -- and ultimately embracing -- the unpredictability and promise of his future means letting go of the past and taking the leap of faith he knows he needs in his journey to maturity.

And I&#39;m sort of, well, no, not &quot;sort of&quot; I&#39; <i>definitely</i> tealing a bit <a href=""http://mydem.blogspot.ca/"" target=""_blank"">right off his blog</a> to introduce the one I really, really want to read the most: Kinky Pubes&quot;
<blockquote> quot;Kinky/Pubes&quot; is out now!

I&#39;m always pleased to find new authors to read, and I hope a few of you find something here to intrigue you. &nbsp;And Myck, thanks for hanging out and offering your quiet encouragement. You never know who&#39;s listening, maybe, but I thank you for just being around as an example of yet another author who makes this&nbsp;business, and our tiny corner of it, worth the hassles."

I have been meaning, for some time, to mention a blog that posts excerpts of gay and lesbian new releases. A few of my own books have been featured there, and it&#39;s nice exposure for authors. It&#39;s also a great place to find your next read, if you&#39;ve been casting about for one. It&#39;s pretty easy to remember, since it&#39;s called Gay and Lesbian Fiction&nbsp;Excerpts, and today, it&#39;s&nbsp;featuring&nbsp;Mykola Dementiuk&#39;s novel Minasota Strip: A tale of Times Square Queers. This is a book I&#39;m eager to pick up when funds allow, but I thought I&#39;d share the excerpt with you, so <a href=""http://glfictionexcerpts.blogspot.ca/2013/01/minnesota-strip-tale-of-times-square.html"" target=""_blank"">here&#39;s the link</a> Click the cover to get to a purchase site)

And finally for today, an interesting<a href=""http://glbt.theromancereviews.com/viewbooksreview.php?bookid=7718"" target=""_blank""> review of my own cross dresser story, Lace</a> was posted on <a href=""http://glbt.theromancereviews.com/"" target=""_blank"">The Romance Review</a>. I like this review, because believe me, I&#39;ve read some reviews by Vantina Heart of my stuff, and she&#39;s not kidding when she says some of it is a real miss for her. And that&#39;s okay. It means I can trust her when she says she liked this one, because she&#39;s not afraid to say when she doesn&#39;t like something. I like that kind of honesty. Also interesting is that she&#39;s the first person I know of who hasn&#39;t&nbsp;liked&nbsp;Levi, and that, I find curious and kinda neat</div>"

"event","I call it that because the following little gem is pretty much an example of everyone crowding into one head. Mine. I found it while clearing out the folder containing all&nbsp;the&nbsp;detritus&nbsp; snapshots, cuts, crit and copies of my latest submitted MS. Now that it is officially off on it&#39;s first foray out into&nbsp;the&nbsp;wide world of publishing and gazing all hopeful-eyed at it&#39;s first&nbsp;acquiring&nbsp;editor, as I do with all my stories, I went in to clean up it&#39;s old room on my hard drive.

You would not believe some of&nbsp;the&nbsp;stuff I found in&nbsp;there&nbsp; This MS has some...interesting shit stashed away in the depths of it&#39;s overflowing file folder. And I&#39;m not talking crumb-filled empty pizza boxes or baggies of&nbsp;the&nbsp;good stuff, either. I&#39;m talking about some strange-ass shit that came out of my brain while I was in the throws of OMG-I-can&#39;t-write-this-story-what-the-hell-was-I-thinking.

So, how about a conversation between what appears to be me and Stanley, one of the four main characters in the book (he&#39;s a music agent who has handled some really big-name country and western mega stars, including his ex-wife&#39;s career, and his best&nbsp;friend&#39;s&nbsp;career. I wanted to know what was in his head, I guess, because he did go through that really&nbsp;awkward&nbsp;teen-age stage where he wouldn&#39;t open his mouth to say boo to me other than to tell me he was bored or that he wanted the car keys to abscond from the story entirely)

<strong>M:</strong> First song you remember you couldn&rsquo;t get enough of?

<strong>S:</strong> The highwaymen. No. Pancho and Lefty, when I was bout nine. Wasn&rsquo;t till I was more like fifteen, I knew those two were doing the nasty.

<strong>M:</strong> So, you&rsquo;re a fan of Old School? Willie Nelson and&nbsp;Kris?

<strong>S:</strong> Yea. Mostly because Vance and I, we grew up on that shit.

<strong>M:</strong> You and Vance.

<strong>S:</strong> Don&rsquo;t.

<strong>M:</strong> why?

<strong>S:</strong> I thought we were here to talk about music.

<strong>M:</strong> I suppose we can talk about music, then. When did you start playing?

<strong>S:</strong> *big sigh* Let&rsquo;s see&hellip;.maybe&hellip;around nine or ten? Vance was already onto his second guitar. I played along on his castoff. He taught me my first chords.

<strong>M:</strong> He must have taught you a lot of things.

<strong>S:</strong> *shrugs* sure.

*Pauase*

<strong>Me:</strong> &ldquo;Sure&rdquo;? That&rsquo;s it?

<strong>S:</strong> Music, remember?

<strong>M:</strong> Right. Sure. Okay&hellip;did you ever play in a band?

<strong>S:</strong> Well yeah. All through high school. I played guitar or bass. We had a girl drummer, and this skinny little mouse of a kid on keyboards. Kerry. He plays for *big famous band* now. Vance was out front, of course.

<strong>M:</strong> Of course. Did you get Kerry his gig, too?

<strong>S:</strong> Nah. He was shy, but wicked talented. Plus, he always had his shit together, you know? He didn&rsquo;t need me. In fact, he pointed me in the direction of Vance&rsquo;s first band members. Introduced us after he left high school to tour. We were in senior year when I started booking us real gigs. Ones that actually paid for themselves and left a bit of cash in our pockets, besides.

<strong>M:</strong> So Vance was your first.

<strong>S:</strong> *glares*

<strong>M:</strong> First client. He was the first artist you managed.

<strong>S:</strong> Yeah. I was dating Sherie by then.

<strong>M:</strong> Sherie. She&rsquo;s one half of Sky Daughters.

<strong>S:</strong> Yes, she is.

<strong>M:</strong> With Nancy Tompson.

<strong>S:</strong> *frowning* Yes.

<strong>M:</strong> They&rsquo;re good. I like their sound. Ballsy, for a couple of chicks. Even more so for a chick couple. How did that happen?

<strong>S:</strong> Geez, you&rsquo;re a bitch.

<strong>M:</strong> Yes. Answer the question.

<strong>S:</strong> It isn&rsquo;t a secret. Sherie was good on her own, but too mellow for real mass appeal. She needed a brighter voice to counter hers, and someone to be the front man. But she didn&rsquo;t get along with any of the guys we auditioned. Or, probably more like she intimidated the hell out of most of them. She&rsquo;s like that.

<strong>M:</strong> But not you

<strong>S:</strong> *grinning* No. Not me. I called her on her brooding crap fests. She didn&rsquo;t pull that with me for long. When I finally got her to smile&hellip;*trails off*

<strong>M:</strong> Gonner, were you?

<strong>S:</strong> Yeah. Guess I was. Even quit Vance for a while.

<strong>Me:</strong> *raised eyebrows*

<strong>S:</strong> Vance&rsquo;s band, Quit the band. I quit Vance&rsquo;s band. Still found them gigs, but I was pretty into her, there for a year or two.

<strong>M:</strong> Until you found Nancy.

<strong>S:</strong> *deep sigh* No. Even after I found Nancy. I was still into her. She was just more into Nance than me.

<strong>M:</strong> That still hurts.

<strong>S:</strong> Will you get out of my head!

<strong>M:</strong> Doing my job, here, buddy. If you don&rsquo;t tell me what&rsquo;s going on with you, I cannot make this happen, and I&rsquo;m going to have to make shit up. And believe me, I can probably make up way worse than what actually ever happened to you.

<strong>S:</strong> Well, maybe you&rsquo;ll have to, because nothing is going on with me.

<strong>M:</strong> You keep letting Vance fuck you silly. Why is that?

<strong>S:</strong> I thought we were not going to talk about him.

<strong>M:</strong> I lied.

<strong>S:</strong> I didn&rsquo;t. You wanted to know about my career.

<strong>M:</strong> Your career is boring-ass shit. You manage bands. You make stars. I get all that. Big wow. You fuck your best friend regularly, even though you *claim* there is no relationship there, and you get horny like a sixteen-yr-old virgin every time you hear Damian&rsquo;s voice. *That* is my story, and I want it.

<strong>S:</strong> You&rsquo;re like the worst paparattzzi ever!

<strong>M:</strong> You going to smash my camera and break my nose? Or are you going to tell me what I want to know?

<strong>S:</strong> *&hellip;*

So, technically, he never did come clean about <em>why</em>&nbsp;he let his best friend have his way with him so often, but he did, eventually, give in to his crush on the goth rocker boy, Damian, and the rest, as they say, is history. So now all we have to do is fix up the old room, dust out the cobwebs and move the next story in. Right now, I have Skate and Denny from Rainbow Alley and a new singer, Coby Birmingham vying for the good room. Not sure who&#39;s gonna come out on top, though Coby is slated to move out by the middle of next month, so looks like I have my work cut out for me. Wish me luck!

So I asked to many of the authors in this year contest to be generous and donate a book or two... and the answer was overwhelming: 243 among print and ebooks!<br /><br />But this time you have to &quot;earn&quot; your prize and so there is a &quot;little&quot; treasure hunt: nothing complicated but you need to complete a chain made of Title-Word-Definition-Cover-<wbr />Number. How? I will try to explain LOL<br /><br />We have 243 book titles, you can find them here:<br /><br />The Books:&nbsp;</span><a href=""http://elisa-rolle.livejournal.com/1805679.html"" style=""color: rgb(17, 85, 204); "" target=""_blank""><span style=""color:#800000;"">http://elisa-rolle.<wbr />livejournal.com/1805679.html</span></a><span style=""color:#800000;"">&nbsp;(mirrored here if you don&#39;t have a LJ account to comment and you are not friend on LJ:&nbsp;</span><a href=""http://reviews-and-ramblings.dreamwidth.org/3359348.html"" style=""color: rgb(17, 85, 204); "" target=""_blank""><span style=""color:#800000;"">http://reviews-and-ramblings.<wbr />dreamwidth.org/3359348.html</span></a><span style=""color:#800000;"">)<br /><br />from each title I extracted a word, but be careful, same word can match more title, BUT there is an unique matching (example, if I have two titles, Love Story and Story of Me, &quot;story&quot; match both title, but probably, from the first title I took &quot;Love&quot; and from the second I took &quot;Story&quot;.

I &#39;met&#39; him years ago in a chat room somewhere and he quickly revealed&nbsp;himself&nbsp;to be one of the nicest, most talent authors and artist I know. He&#39;s also generous to the point of insanity. Plus, he saved my sanity helping me out with this very website, and I could go on and on about how great he is, but I&#39;m pretty sure he&#39;s already turning eight shades of red and cursing me for going on about him. He just doesn&#39;t know the impact he has on people, the glow he exudes, even over the net.<br /><br />That and I love his writing and his art.<br /><br />(And in case you didn&#39;t recognize it, that, right there, was a big ol&#39; fangirl moment)<br /><br />So, on to the point: <em>The Statue</em>:<a href=""http://jaime-samms.net/?attachment_id=1182"" rel=""attachment wp-att-1182""><img alt="""" class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-1182"" height=""300"" src=""http://jaime-samms.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/The-Statue-b-212x300.jpg"" style=""border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; margin: 10px; float: right; "" title=""The Statue b"" width=""212"" /></a><br /><br /><strong>Blurb:</strong> Freelance journalist, Tristan Church, wants to expose Galloway Mental Hospital&rsquo;s dirty secrets. Teaming up with broody photographer, Mark, promises other perks. A ten year relationship with high school sweetheart, Eli, no longer offers Tristan the excitement he craves. Mark made his intentions clear and Tristan is close to giving in to his advances.<br /><br />One morning at &lsquo;The Gallows&rsquo; leaves Tristan reeling. He wasn&rsquo;t prepared for the hell he witnessed and certainly wasn&rsquo;t prepared to meet Zane. Disarmed by Zane&rsquo;s angelic manner, Tristan can&rsquo;t believe anyone would stand him up. He soon realises the tardy boyfriend only exists in Zane&rsquo;s mind and the beautiful young man is not a visitor to The Gallows but a patient.<br /><br />Eli walks out and Tristan&rsquo;s life falls apart. A decision to meet with Mark almost ends in tragedy and Tristan finds solace in Zane&rsquo;s company. Before long Zane&rsquo;s delusions begin terrorising him again. While Tristan fights to save his own sanity and get Eli back, he knows someone must fight for Zane&rsquo;s right to love a man no one else can see. A man who scares away violent hallucinations, takes away Zane&rsquo;s fear, keeps him safe, and is trapped inside a stone statue.<br /><br />Can I just say: I&#39;m excited!!!<br /><div>And here the purchase links:</div><br /><div><a href=""http://scarlettiebooks.com/?page_id=262"" target=""_blank"">http://scarlettiebooks.com/?<wbr />page_id=262</a></div><br /><div>or</div><br /><div><a href=""http://zathynpriest.com/brokenpencil/?page_id=970"" target=""_blank"">http://zathynpriest.com/<wbr />brokenpencil/?page_id=970</a></div><br />&nbsp;"

It&#39;s like my new hero, Vic, says on his blog: One voice matters. Every voice matters. Your&#39;s might be the voice that changes a life. Or saves one. You do have that much power. Use it for good. :)<br /><br />How often do we hear that story, <a href=""http://jaime-samms.net/2012/05/17/the-saddest-story-i-know/"" target=""_blank"">like mine</a>, even, where one voice, one answer to one question, would have made<br />all&nbsp;the&nbsp;difference? Or the heartbreaking stories where one person&#39;s derision, intolernance, ignorance, or hurtful comment killed a person&#39;s spirit? Caused them to despair? Why do we think we have any less power because we speak a message of love and acceptance?<br /><br />We don&#39;t. We have as much capacity to do good, to help and lift up just by speaking up at&nbsp;the&nbsp;right time, and you know what? You might never know when the thing you said to the right person at the right time changed their lives forever. You probably will never know. And you don&#39;t have to. Because that isn&#39;t the point.<br /><br />Believe that what you say and do matters. For good or ill, we all leave our impact on the world, and it&#39;s up to every one of us to decide what our footprints look like. &nbsp;Not too long ago, I realized I was still waiting for that long ago answer to my question &quot;Where does Ray sleep?&quot; Even then, somewhere in the depths of my young mind, I knew the answer to that very simple question. What I wanted was someone to tell me it was okay.<br /><br />No one did. No one could. Because there were four adults in that room, and no matter how much they all loved me, or each other, they could not say it was okay. Not even Uncle Cliff and Uncle Ray, who knew in their hearts and souls what they had was good and right, could tell a little girl it would be okay to grow up this way.</div><div style=""text-align: center; ""><br />I don&#39;t for one second think they regretted loving each other, or being the people they were. But somewhere along the way, someone said something, did something, that changed their lives, and made it impossible for them to say it out loud. And more than anything I&#39;ve gone through in my own life, more than any struggle I&#39;ve had trying to figure my own truth out, that is the thing that breaks my heart.<br /><br />So. Be the change you want to see in the world. I can&#39;t think of any better way to put it. It&#39;s the only way it will work.</div><div style=""text-align: center; ""><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1176"" height=""336"" src=""http://jaime-samms.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/be-the-change-you-want-to-see-in-the-world_22.jpg"" style=""line-height: 18px; border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; margin: 10px; "" title=""be-the-change-you-want-to-see-in-the-world_2"" width=""500"" /><br />And also, <strong>William Prater</strong>, you win, dude!

If any of you noticed that, well, book two fleshes them out considerably, so I take all that back.<br /><br />Alec is the perfect combination of smart and capable vs. naive and innocent that makes me want to sit down and have a serious chat about life, love and the universe with the lad. He is one reason I&#39;m freaking out as I near the end of book two of this series.<br /><br />Sergil is another reason. He&#39;s far more seasoned, so I have no illusions about his innocence. I do fear greatly for his stability, though. He&#39;s highly intense. Everything matters so much to him and he takes such great pains to show only that nothing means anything. Only he&#39;s cracked. Breaking apart at this point, and it&#39;s doubtful he can survive the emotional impact of what&#39;s happening to Alec.<br /><br />Micum is their rock, and I fear for him the most because I have my suspicions who the Vanguard really is, and that does not bode well for Micum&#39;s survival. At. All. but he&#39;s such a *nice* guy. Stable, strong, level-headed. In short, the perfect authorial sacrifice. The one who least deserves to die, and therefore, probably the most likely one not to see the end of the quest. Sucktastic.<br /><br />And finally, Nysander. On death&#39;s door, so you know he&#39;s going to survive. But in the end, I fear I might not like the old guy so much. He kept so many secrets. Even lied to people who trusted him. Maybe he really did believe he had reasons, but I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll be able to forgive him when it&#39;s time for the body count. Plus, he was weak as far as his assistant Thero was concerned and either Thero will be the next series blackened wizard of evil doom (I forget what they&#39;re called, but they aren&#39;t pretty) or he died a horrible death because his mentor failed him.<br /><br />Or, and here&#39;s where the nervous breakdown comes in, I&#39;ve got everything wrong and the surprises will kill me. Or, I got it all right and it will rip my heart out to read it. I&#39;m already broken over Alec, and I&#39;m pretty sure he hasn&#39;t seen the worst of it yet.<br /><br />So, well done Lynn. You win this round. You&#39;ve made me hate on you and admire the crap out of you all at once. This book is killing me. (Which means it&#39;s some of the best writing I&#39;ve come across in quite some time, because if I didn&#39;t care, I wouldn&#39;t be lamenting it on my blog)</div><br />"

Her new release, <em>Damnit!</em>&nbsp;came out a few weeks ago, and while I haven&#39;t read it yet, I do have it in the&nbsp;quay, and it&#39;s looking like it&#39;s going to be a great read.<br /><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><em>Damnit!</em>&nbsp;The Blurb</strong></p><br /><p dir=""ltr""><em>Escaping the past isn&rsquo;t easy, especially when the scars left behind are a constant reminder that trust and love can hurt.</em></p><br />Michael McKnight knows what it means to be on the run from memories. Years ago, after fleeing an abusive relationship, he was brutally stabbed and left for dead. His only savior had been a&nbsp; compassionate stranger he&rsquo;d only gotten a glimpse of before slipping into the blackness that claimed him.<br /><br />For Michael, recovery was an arduous and hard fought return to some semblance of normalcy. He rebuilds his life, spending his waking hours buried in work and fighting to forget the past. And his life seems to be going well until he finds out that his cousin Wayne is being held captive in a mental asylum for being gay. So he buys a plane ticket and flies out to rescue his cousin.<br /><br />But the weather is against Michael, keeping him grounded and talking to a man who claims that he&rsquo;d once saved his life and is willing to help him rescue his cousin. Can this man be for real or is something more sinister in the works?<br /><p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align: center;""><strong><em>Damnit!</em> The Buy link</strong></p><br /><p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align: center;"">&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.seventhwindow.com/index.php?main_page=product_music_info&amp;cPath=&amp;products_id=46"">http://www.seventhwindow.com/index.php?main_page=product_music_info&amp;cPath=&amp;products_id=46</a></p><br /><p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align: center;""><em><strong>Damnit! </strong></em><strong>The Excerpt</strong></p><br /><p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align: left;"">CHAPTER ONE</p><br />&ldquo;Do you think it&rsquo;s at all possible to make this yellow thing go any faster than it already is? I have a flight to catch and it&rsquo;s one I can&rsquo;t afford to miss. It&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;re stuck in traffic here. Its three a.m., there&rsquo;s no one in front of you.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;No, no. Not possible. Snow make it hard to drive. Why you leave before sun shine? Maybe it make snow go away, eh?&rdquo;<br /><br />Michael groaned and slid down further in the backseat. His fingers tapped on the door, showing his impatience. He looked out all of the windows and cursed the falling snow. And it wasn&rsquo;t just falling. Oh no, that would be putting it lightly. It was coming down in blizzard fashion, and he had to fly in this?<br /><br />Michael exhaled. God, how he hated to travel; it was like a train wreck waiting to happen. Or a plane wreck. Whatever. Turbulence that felt as if the damn plane were attached to a bungee cord that could snap at any moment, lost luggage, then an engine failure that caused an emergency landing had just about sworn him off flying for good. Just the thought of it made him shudder. The lost luggage thing hadn&rsquo;t been so bad, though. He did get to shop for some replacement clothes and found a pair of jeans that made his ass look fabulous, if he did say so himself, so there was that sparkly plus to an otherwise crappy experience. But still.<br /><br />Flights after that had somehow managed to go smoothly, but now this mess. First, his alarm clock had malfunctioned, waking him up to Ozzy at two o&rsquo;clock in the morning. And who in their right mind plays Ozzy at that time of the day? Damn alarm clock. It was supposed to go off at four. He&rsquo;d lain in bed glaring at the evil thing, trying to decide if he should just get up, get his shower, and have his coffee, or go back to sleep. Getting up had won out because he couldn&rsquo;t trust the alarm would go off again at four. Needless to say, the damn thing was<br />now in the incinerator.<br /><br />To make matters worse, the snow had continued to fall, all the way to the airport, &ldquo;making&rdquo; the cab driver proceed cautiously, as in driving twenty miles an hour all the way down the freeway. This lovely ride was now coming up on an hour long, and he lived not twenty minutes from the massive circus tent the people in Colorado called D.I.A. The cab driver, who drove like it was a Sunday morning with nowhere to go, was doing his damndest to make him late, but somehow, someway, they were finally pulling up to the departures curb.<br /><br />Michael let the cab slow to a rolling stop, then threw open the door, prompting an angry outburst from the driver, in a language Michael couldn&rsquo;t hope to understand. If he had to guess, he was pretty sure the guy wasn&rsquo;t thanking him for the great conversation and charming company.<br /><br />He checked in with the skycap and then ran to the security gate, arriving breathless, ticket and ID in hand, only to come to a parking lot of people of all shapes, sizes, and colors, none of them moving or looking at all happy. Everyone and their mother had decided to travel at the same damn time as him, just his luck, and here he&rsquo;d thought that by taking the early flight, the airport would be quieter, certainly less busy than this. Somberly, he stood in line and tried to ignore the couple behind him with their two screaming kids. Who in their right mind traveled with kids? The poor things had to get up early, probably missed breakfast, and then got dumped into this madness.<br /><br />Time ticked on. And on. And on. Then finally, after twenty minutes of thanking God he was gay and would never reproduce, it was his turn. Like a well seasoned traveler, he had his shoes off, his pockets emptied, and his belt and laptop in the plastic bin, ready to go. He walked through the machine, then heard a noise that sounded a lot like, Ahhh! That same noise his aunt had made at him when he was little and doing something he wasn&rsquo;t supposed to. He froze in place and stared at the security guard on the other side of the yellow line, motioning for him to come hither. Fear took hold like a fist in his belly, his heart thumping, and he stood there, paralyzed, because everyone was staring at him as though he were public enemy number one on the US government&rsquo;s No-Fly List. Oh God, he knew he&rsquo;d done something wrong or that guy wouldn&rsquo;t be signaling to him, pointing him out and making his face heat up and break out in a sweat.<br /><br />&ldquo;Sir, please step this way. You&rsquo;re holding up the line.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Oh, good Christ, why me?&rdquo; he said, wishing he could disappear right at that very moment. He moved toward the guard, the cold tile floor making his bare feet all the more uncomfortable, his eyes wide and unblinking.<br /><br />&ldquo;Arms out to your sides, sir,&rdquo; the guard said. He sounded annoyed, at that.<br /><br />&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Michael said, doing as he was told. Like this, of all things, was exactly what he needed to have happen, and right now? Why was it every time he traveled, shit happened to him?<br /><br />Up one side and down the other went the wand as he stood there sweating from embarrassment, but it was amazingly quiet. He cocked his head to the side and snickered as if to ask, now what?<br /><br />&ldquo;Please step to your left and the next available guard will be right with you.&rdquo;<br /><br />Michael groaned and looked at the man. &ldquo;But&hellip;why? Your wand thingy didn&rsquo;t beep.&rdquo;<br /><br />The guard raised his left eyebrow, lowered his head. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll want to Step to your left now, sir.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;But, what about my stuff? My laptop cost me a&hellip;&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s safe and sound. Please, step to your left. Next.&rdquo;<br /><br />And with that, Michael was dismissed. He fought the urge to growl again and did as he was told. Did he look like a terrorist? And, for that matter, what did they even look like? He moaned inwardly, sighed and rolled his eyes. Why had he even agreed to do this? Oh, that&rsquo;s right, he hadn&rsquo;t. He was being forced to do this. Well, not exactly forced, but if he didn&rsquo;t do it, he&rsquo;d be worse for the wear, and a shitty cousin, on top of it. Then he saw what the man in front of him was being put through, and his dick suddenly woke up. Perfect. Just perfect.<br /><br />&ldquo;Frisk? They frisk you now?&rdquo; he said to no one in particular.<br /><br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m putting it up to a free feel, personally. Perverted bastards. I swear, if a man touches me, I&rsquo;m throwing down on him. Nasty creatures, groping paws all over this hot body. I want a woman!&rdquo;<br /><br />Michael looked to his right, and a laugh escaped before he had a chance to swallow it down. The girl standing next to him had red and orange hair and eye makeup so thick he was sure if he&rsquo;d scraped his nail across it, no one would&rsquo;ve been able to tell, bright pink eye makeup, at that; the girl must have been color blind. &ldquo;What are they looking for?&rdquo; he asked.<br /><br />&ldquo;Fuck if I know. What do they think, that we&rsquo;re all armed and hiding said weapons in our bodily orifices? Not very sanitary!&rdquo;<br /><br />Michael grew lightheaded as a wave of panic shot through his body. He swallowed hard a few times, his throat like sandpaper scraping against rock. &ldquo;Oh shit, do they actually check those open ports? Here, in front of God and everyone?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Hell if I know. This is my first ride since all the bullshit started with those insane, flying acrobat wannabe&rsquo;s. All I know is that no man is touching me. Do you hear that?&rdquo; she yelled, raising her voice with every syllable.<br /><br />One look at Mr. Gorgeous&mdash;tall, muscular, blond, and blue-as-sky eyes&mdash;frisking everyone, and Michael&rsquo;s dick started dancing about in his pants. He was a goner, just wonderful. Six months without any action, whatsoever, and little man down below starts his happy dancing at the mere idea of being groped by a beefy, blonde TSA agent. &ldquo;This is so not my day.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Next!&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Good luck, Mister. Don&rsquo;t let them shove their fingers up you, unless they have a glove and lube!&rdquo;<br /><br />He swayed with dizziness. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Cavity search. Haven&rsquo;t you ever watched Lifetime?&rdquo;<br /><br />He was pretty sure his heart was going to go ahead and explode from stress. Or maybe he&rsquo;d just have a nice aneurism and escape this humiliation altogether. When he walked up to the rather large man standing near the&hellip; &ldquo;I have to undress?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Sir. Please raise your arms out to the side and spread your legs.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;With my clothes on, right?&rdquo; Though the guard was all kinds of hot and muscular, Michael wasn&rsquo;t good with having a stranger&rsquo;s digits entering his body, at any time.<br /><br />&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;<br /><br />Once Michael did as he was instructed, he saw the man slip a pair of latex gloves on, and he yelped, &ldquo;Oh my God! What are those for?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m only going to frisk you.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Can I ask why?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Random search, that&rsquo;s all. Do you have something to hide? You seem a little nervous.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;No! No, nothing to hide. I emptied my pockets and took off my shoes and belt, so I don&rsquo;t understand why I&rsquo;m being&hellip; Oh!&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Sorry, sir. It&rsquo;s part of my job.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Touching a man&rsquo;s penis is part of your job?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;No, sir, that was a slip. I apologize. Please turn around.&rdquo;<br /><br />Michael turned, as he was instructed, and jumped as that big hand had made its way up the inside of his thigh and back down again. As far as his dick was concerned, this was foreplay, and it made him achingly hard.<br /><br />Add sexual frustration to his already overdone day. And it hadn&rsquo;t even hit seven o&rsquo;clock in the morning yet.<br /><br />&ldquo;Okay, sir. You&rsquo;re free to go.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m clear?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the man answered with a gleam in his eye Michael took as lust.<br /><br />&ldquo;Right, so you didn&rsquo;t find anything?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Well, yes, as a matter of fact I did find&hellip;something. But it&rsquo;s not a danger to anyone other than you if you don&rsquo;t get it taken care of.&rdquo;<br /><br />The man grinned, patted Michael&rsquo;s shoulder, and said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re just fine. Next!&rdquo;<br /><br />Michael didn&rsquo;t miss the other man&rsquo;s suggestive look or what he&rsquo;d been looking for. Random search, indeed. He offered a slight nod, cleared his throat, resumed his regular breathing pattern, and concentrated on walking to his personal items, with a hard on he was doing his best to hide.<br /><br />&ldquo;Oh man, that looks painful. If I was into dudes, I&rsquo;d sure take you into the restroom and help you out with that.&rdquo;<br /><br />Michael couldn&rsquo;t have been any more embarrassed if he tried. Make-up girl again. &ldquo;Have you no couth?&rdquo;<br /><br />She laughed and sauntered over to her items, then came back to sit beside him. &ldquo;None. Not at all, whatsoever. What&rsquo;s the point? If you hide your true self from the world, they&rsquo;ll never know you were here. It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m ever going to see these snobs again, and if I do, they&rsquo;ll remember me. You? I&rsquo;ll remember you cuz when Mr. Sexy back there felt you up, you popped a woody and he, while you were turned around, grinned like a schoolboy. He liked it.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re bad. Shameless is what you are. And for your information, men have no control over how their penises react to certain situations. It&rsquo;s a normal reaction.&rdquo;<br /><p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align: center;""><strong><em>Damnit!</em>&nbsp;The Buy link </strong></p><br /><p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align: center;""><strong>(again, just in case you missed it the first time :D )</strong></p><br /><p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align: center;"">&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.seventhwindow.com/index.php?main_page=product_music_info&amp;cPath=&amp;products_id=46"">http://www.seventhwindow.com/index.php?main_page=product_music_info&amp;cPath=&amp;products_id=46</a></p>"

I&#39;ve talked about her work often enough that it should be pretty clear she&#39;s one of my absolute favorites.&nbsp;Still, I wasn&#39;t sure I was going to read this book, because, well, she&#39;s so prolific that I just don&#39;t have time to read them all, and I have a&nbsp;whole&nbsp;list of her other titles I still want to get to.<br /><br />Well, what decided me was Audible. It was available there and I had a credit, so I picked it up and besides, I was curious how it would be to listen to a m/m book read by a woman. I don&#39;t remember the reader&#39;s name, but I have to say, she does a spectacular job. (although, I&#39;m not sure if the ipad is glitching, or if there are a few spots where the editing is off, and some short bits of narrative are repeated. It&#39;s happened a couple of times, but I can live with that.)<br /><br />I&#39;m not sure how close to the end I am, but probably pretty close, because things seem to be wrapping up nicely, the lives of this little family coming together, and everything. I admit, there were times I wanted to slap Jaime upside the head for his...well...typical man behavior, but I never outright didn&#39;t like him. He has issues with letting people around him feel how they&#39;re going to feel, and he kind of defaults to assuming they&#39;ll feel the worst, but still, he does give Sri a strong foundation, and I think towards the end of the book, there&#39;s hope he&#39;ll begin to be a little more open minded about the people who love him.<br /><br />As for Sri, Sophi&#39;s&nbsp;biological&nbsp;dad, well...if a man more suited to fatherhood exists...obviously, this is fiction, and even giving him his insecurities and his ignorance, Ms. Tachna created a man who was simply born to be a father. There&#39;s really nothing to not like about him.<br /><br />Basically, what I&#39;m saying is that I&#39;m glad I picked this book up. It&#39;s been a wonderful break from all the angst I&#39;m writing at the moment, and a bright spot in my days as I listen to it.<br /><br />Thanks, Ariel.

The general public blames him for his former employer&rsquo;s nuclear pollution, resulting in professional disgrace. Humiliated, he takes a job as an editor at a science magazine run by his best friend, John. That part isn&rsquo;t so bad; Bailey is fond of John, who seems to find Bailey&rsquo;s abrasive nature amusing.</p><br /><p style=""text-align: center;"">&nbsp; Unfortunately, working for John also leads to writing an astrology column in exchange for getting free rein in some op-ed articles&mdash;and then being sued over one. The (totally coincidental) accuracy of the column offers opportunity for further professional disgrace if anyone discovers its author&mdash;and then Bailey digs himself a little deeper.</p><br /><p style=""text-align: center;"">&nbsp;&nbsp;In an attempt to prove astrology is bogus, he agrees to an experiment to date someone from each star sign. As if that wasn&rsquo;t bad enough, Bailey&rsquo;s got a stupid crush on John, who stubbornly insists on a detailed breakdown of every date&mdash;bad and otherwise. Bailey&rsquo;s luck has to improve sometime&hellip; right?</p><br /><p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>And an excerpt. She sent me a nice sized one, and I was only going to use part of it, but it was too much fun not to share it all, so here ya go!!</strong></p><br /><p align=""center""><strong>Chapter 1 - <em>Heavens Above</em></strong></p><br />&nbsp;&ldquo;NO. NO, no, no, and no!&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; John said, not even looking away from his computer screen.<br /><br />&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t possibly be serious,&rdquo; Bailey insisted. He slammed his hands down on John&rsquo;s desk, finally getting the attention of the magazine&rsquo;s editor in chief.<br /><br />&ldquo;Serious as a funeral,&rdquo; John said.<br /><br />&ldquo;This will <em>ruin </em>our credibility! Everything we&rsquo;ve been working for over the last year, ever since we started! You&rsquo;re going to destroy it all just to pander to the masses? They don&rsquo;t need any more pandering! I refuse to be a part of it,&rdquo; Bailey said definitively. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t do it. I&rsquo;ll quit first.&rdquo;<br /><br />John&rsquo;s attention had shifted back to his computer, irritating Bailey. He&rsquo;d probably done it on purpose. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t quit.&rdquo;<br /><br />The sound of sputtering frustration filled the office for several minutes until Bailey managed to get ahold of himself. His boss was many things, all of them annoying, but stupid wasn&rsquo;t one of them. &ldquo;Why won&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;One, because you&rsquo;ve seen the numbers and know that we need to make some changes to keep afloat. Two, because appealing to a broader, more mainstream audience is the best way to do that. And three, because I have a bribe for you: I&rsquo;ll let you write the review column you&rsquo;ve been bugging me about.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;But an article like you&rsquo;re suggesting is going to dumb down the whole magazine!&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;<em>Baaaaaileeeeey</em>,&rdquo; John said, the name sounding about three syllables longer that it actually was, each brimming with John&rsquo;s world-weary suffering of his senior science editor.<br /><br />Bailey closed his eyes for a moment, thinking. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re proposing that I get to write a scathing commentary of my former peers&rsquo; latest research developments every month?&rdquo;<br /><br />John nodded.<br /><br />&ldquo;I get to be rude to people, <em>in print</em>, every month&mdash;for at least twelve issues?&rdquo; he clarified.<br /><br />John nodded again, a smile starting to creep onto his face, starting in the fine lines around his eyes.<br /><br />&ldquo;And in return, you&rsquo;re going to make me&mdash;over my most vehement objections&mdash;write an <em>astrology </em>column?&rdquo; Bailey managed to load an impressive amount of scorn into the word.<br /><br />&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;<br /><br />Huffing in justified frustration, Bailey thought for a moment again and then jerked his chin in a quick nod. &ldquo;Fine. I&rsquo;ll do it. But!&rdquo; he hurried to add before John&rsquo;s grin became overly smug, &ldquo;I want you to guarantee the twelve-month minimum for the review column, and I insist that That Other Thing be completely anonymous. No byline, John, and no one else at <em>Spark </em>knows about it who doesn&rsquo;t have to. If word got out, it would destroy my remaining credibility.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Oh, you still have some left?&rdquo; John asked, eyes twinkling with laughter.<br /><br />&ldquo;Bite me.&rdquo; It was always going to smart, how the idiots at Stellar Energy had cost Bailey his reputation by refusing to listen to his advice. Well, him and the other scientists on the research team, but still.<br /><br />John reached into a tray on his desk and pulled out a sheet of paper. &ldquo;Here; I knew you&rsquo;d want it in writing.&rdquo;<br /><br />Bailey took the agreement back to his desk to look over thoroughly. John Forrester might be his good friend, maybe even his best friend, but he wasn&rsquo;t signing anything without reading the fine print. He and John had known each other too long and given each other far too much shit for him to be quite that trusting.<br /><br />The two had met nearly a decade ago, when John had still been enlisted and Bailey was contracting with the military. He&rsquo;d been working on a still-classified project which would one day revolutionize energy production, and John had been one of a small team of soldiers assigned to keep the scientists somewhat grounded in reality. It had turned out that John was actually quite intelligent, even had an MA in mathematics&mdash;something Bailey found difficult to believe of someone who had voluntarily signed up to be shot at&mdash;and despite the constant arguing and insults, they became friends.<br /><br />They hadn&rsquo;t stayed in touch once the project had been completed and they were both reassigned. Bailey had finished out his contract and then gone to work for those fools at Stellar Energy. While he was grateful that John had sought him out and offered him a job at <em>Spark</em>, his gratitude only went so far. To Bailey&rsquo;s eternal mortification, John instinctively knew the right buttons to push, the same way he had all those years ago, to prod Bailey into doing whatever he wanted. Just like with this ridiculous astrology column.<br /><br />Bailey reviewed the proposal carefully and tried not to get too upset that John had been able to predict his demands that the editorial be for a year minimum and that the astrology column remain anonymous. He signed his usual assertive scrawl and took the agreement over to Lauren, John&rsquo;s assistant, detouring to make himself a photocopy first.<br /><br />John popped his head out the door. &ldquo;Buy you a beer after work to wash away the bitter taste of defeat?&rdquo; he offered.<br /><br />&ldquo;Go to hell. But yes, buy me a beer first.&rdquo;<br /><br />John grinned. &ldquo;So long as I know I&rsquo;ve got company for the trip.&rdquo;<br /><br />Bailey shook his head, flapping his hand dismissively as he headed back toward his desk. Damn John for always knowing how to get under Bailey&rsquo;s skin. Bailey sat down at his desk and shuddered as he started typing in search phrases to learn how to predict horoscopes.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><p align=""center"">*****</p><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />THREE months later, John was back at the bar down the street, buying Bailey yet another in a very long&mdash;endless, maybe&mdash;string of conciliatory beers.<br /><br />&ldquo;I still can&rsquo;t believe you are making me do this.&rdquo;<br /><br />John shrugged, bored by the same dialogue they&rsquo;d had a million times but willing to recite his lines once again if that was what Bailey wanted. &ldquo;People want to read about sex and romance. It&rsquo;s not my fault.&rdquo;<br /><br />Bailey sat hunched over in misery, staring hopelessly at his half-empty pint glass. &ldquo;This has to be punishment for something I did.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Buck up. If you want to write the editorial column, then you have to write this one too. You&rsquo;re the only one who&rsquo;s qualified,&rdquo; John said, resting a consoling hand on Bailey&rsquo;s shoulder.<br /><br />The reaction was explosive; Bailey sat up sharply, turning on John with a vengeance. &ldquo;You take that back!&rdquo; he spat. &ldquo;I am not qualified to write such blatant drivel and quackery. I am so far overqualified, so far beyond qualified&mdash;&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Whatever; you&rsquo;re the one who is writing it. It&rsquo;s your assignment; I&rsquo;m your boss. Write the goddamned column,&rdquo; John said, rolling his eyes. Bailey&rsquo;s melodramatic outbursts, which had lost him most of his potential friends and pretty much all of his dates in the last five years, had never had very much effect on John.<br /><br />&ldquo;I hate you,&rdquo; Bailey grumbled.<br /><br />&ldquo;And yet somehow I manage not to cry myself to sleep at night.&rdquo; John smirked as he raised his glass and then drained it. &ldquo;Only you would have a meltdown because your column&mdash;in an obscure new scientific journal&mdash;got praised on a morning talk show.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly it! My astrology column&mdash;the one with <em>no scientific merit whatsoever</em>&mdash;has gained national attention, and I can&rsquo;t even decide if I&rsquo;m more appalled that people think this bullshit is real, or that people finally approve of my work but it&rsquo;s <em>this</em>, or that I&rsquo;m apparently shallow enough to somewhat wish I was actually getting recognition for this drivel. What am I saying&mdash;I absolutely do <em>not </em>want my name associated with this crap! John, under no circumstances are you allowed to ever reveal that I write this column. On pain of death,&rdquo; he said, giving John the most threatening look he could manage, which wasn&rsquo;t very.<br /><br />John laughed. &ldquo;Do you honestly think anyone would believe me anyway? Bailey McMillan, the double-PhD genius, mastermind behind Stellar Energy, writing <em>Spark&rsquo;s </em>astrology column?&rdquo;<br /><br />Bailey signaled to the bartender for another round. &ldquo;I know; you&rsquo;re right, of course. But seriously, John, promise me&mdash;not even in your memoirs.&rdquo;<br /><br />John rolled his eyes but nodded.<br /><br />&ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t get it. I mean, I tried&mdash;I honestly <em>tried</em>&mdash;to find some scientific basis for this garbage. Some way to use the latest research of, oh, the last two centuries of space exploration to find patterns in radiation or magnetic shifts, or anything at all that had the tiniest hint of a possibility of correlation between astronomical phenomena and human behavior, and aside from some very minor reports of a higher incidence of homicides during lunar eclipses, there is nothing. <em>Nothing!</em>&rdquo;<br /><br />John dared another pat on the shoulder as Bailey buried his face in his hands on the table. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the fact that it kind of works that really gets your goat, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Yes! It&rsquo;s driving me insane that so many people are reporting how accurate the random crap I make up is turning out to be!&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Only you would be so upset. Most normal people would simply stop worrying about it and enjoy the ride. It must suck being a genius.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;<em>Hate </em>you.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Love you too, buddy.&rdquo; John laughed.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><p align=""center"">*****</p><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />A WEEK later found them back at the same bar. It was getting to be a regular habit for them. Any time Bailey&rsquo;s&mdash;or rather <em>Spark&rsquo;s</em>&mdash;astrology column was mentioned in the news, John added an hour or two at the bar with Bailey to his evening plans. The column was turning out to be shockingly popular, and it was a good thing Bailey had insisted on keeping his agreement a secret from the rest of the staff at <em>Spark</em>, because the media had started questioning anyone they could find when neither John nor Lauren would give up the writer&rsquo;s name.<br /><br />It seemed as if Bailey&rsquo;s inability to simply make up the column without doing some sort of research&mdash;mostly to prove that astrology was totally bogus&mdash;had backfired. He was running numbers, correlating everything from the levels of radiation the sun was emitting on a particular day, to meteor showers, to the slight wobble of the earth&rsquo;s axis and comparing it to behavioral studies, lottery winners, crime statistics, and data from suicide prevention hotlines. He remained absolutely convinced that there wasn&rsquo;t a shred of evidence to support any sort of relationship between the two&hellip; and yet the magazine was being flooded with e-mails from people who claimed Bailey&rsquo;s predictions were spot-on, including some from well-known astrologers who wanted to know his secret.<br /><br />It almost made Bailey want to weep over the sheer stupidity of their readers.<br /><br />&ldquo;It boggles my mind that people would rather believe their lives are influenced by the movements of big chunks of rock and enormous clouds of gas two kiloparsecs away than simply accept that chaos theory makes far more sense.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;People don&rsquo;t want logic, Bailey, they want a sense of order in their lives.&rdquo; John sighed. This was becoming a very familiar conversation.<br /><br />Bailey made a face. &ldquo;People don&rsquo;t make sense! There are no numbers that are &lsquo;luckier&rsquo; for a Taurus on a particular Wednesday, and there&rsquo;s no specific cosmological configuration that means Virgos should be careful with money or that Geminis should watch out for tall, dark strangers. And don&rsquo;t even get me started on the nonsense about &lsquo;love matches&rsquo;. These idiots might as well be reading sheep entrails for all the &lsquo;science&rsquo; involved.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;The romance stuff pisses you off the most, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; John asked, grinning. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like a personal insult to your finely tuned sense of the utter randomness of love, which of course is why <em>you </em>haven&rsquo;t found the right person yet: sheer chance.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a better answer than looking to the stars to find my soulmate,&rdquo; Bailey answered, tone full of distaste. &ldquo;Part of it is my fault, sure, but most of it is just <em>life</em>&mdash;not ever meeting the right person at the right time under the right conditions. It doesn&rsquo;t have a damn thing to do with where Venus is in my chart.&rdquo;<br /><br />John shook his head and finished his beer. &ldquo;So prove it.&rdquo;<br /><br />Bailey looked at John like he was nuts, which clearly John was, and this was simply more evidence. &ldquo;Prove what, how?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Prove that the romance crap is wrong. Wow me,&rdquo; John challenged him, grinning.<br /><br />&ldquo;Of all the idiotic, pointless, futile theories to waste my time on&hellip;. You might as well ask me to disprove the existence of the Flying Spaghetti Monster.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Praise His Noodly Appendage,&rdquo; John said, raising his glass in a toast.<br /><br />&ldquo;Oh for&hellip;.&rdquo; Bailey sighed but raised his glass to clink against John&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Seriously. The only way to &lsquo;prove&rsquo; that something doesn&rsquo;t work is to try it and see what happens. But anything involving human behavior is so subjective that trying to apply the scientific method is just asking for skewed results.&rdquo; He glanced across the room at a particularly attractive young woman seated at the bar. &ldquo;I could go over to that woman and be charming and wonderful, ask her out, and then attribute her rejection to the month she happened to be born in not meshing well with the month I happened to be born in. Or I could give the same attribution to something slightly more logical, like the fact that she&rsquo;s got a tan line on her hand where a ring used to be and she might not be ready to date again yet. Or maybe she had a crappy day, or maybe her goldfish died, or maybe she hates men with blue eyes!&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;So try just the basics, like a general compatibility test,&rdquo; John suggested. &ldquo;See which signs you&rsquo;re supposed to get along with the best and then date them and see if it&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;<br /><br />Bailey gave him a look. &ldquo;Oh please. What, you think that if I go out on a few dates and somehow magically end up getting along best with the one I&rsquo;m &lsquo;supposed to&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said, complete with air quotes, &ldquo;then that will prove anything?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Maybe not, but you&rsquo;ll have a handful of dates out of it, at the very least.&rdquo; John smirked.<br /><br />&ldquo;I weep for your college professors if that&rsquo;s what you consider logic.&rdquo;<br /><br />John kicked him under the table. &ldquo;What do you have to lose? You go out on twelve dates, and you get to have a tiny bit of proof&mdash;&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Flawed, subjective proof,&rdquo; Bailey interrupted.<br /><br />&ldquo;&mdash;that astrological love matches are bogus,&rdquo; John continued, ignoring Bailey. &ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;ll even get laid,&rdquo; he added, wiggling his eyebrows in what was probably supposed to be a suggestive way but instead looked like he had a facial tic.<br /><br />&ldquo;In order for an &lsquo;experiment&rsquo; like that to work, I&rsquo;d need to date at least one person of each sign. And I couldn&rsquo;t know who was who or I&rsquo;d bring my own biases into it&mdash;which is going to be difficult enough to ignore, given that there is no way in hell this can work, because, and let me say this very clearly since you seem to be missing my point, <em>astrology is completely bogus</em>.&rdquo;<br /><br />John ignored him, as usual. &ldquo;So you go out with one person of each sign within a close enough time period that you can realistically make comparisons. It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;ll suddenly be popular,&rdquo; John teased. &ldquo;Twelve dates in a few months; I bet that&rsquo;s more action than you&rsquo;ve had in years.&rdquo;<br /><br />Bailey made a face at him. &ldquo;Why are we friends?&rdquo; he asked, trying to sound genuinely curious. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty sure I loathe you.&rdquo;<br /><br />It wasn&rsquo;t as if he needed John to rub it in that Bailey didn&rsquo;t date much&mdash;or at all&mdash;and that the idea of finding even two dates in one month made his palms sweat. Not everyone could have the looks John had: tallish, fit, runner&rsquo;s body, tanned skin, hazel eyes. His hair was a perpetual disaster of cowlicks that tended to make him look sort of goofy, but even though he was nearing his midforties, John had a grace and self-confidence that drew women to him like bees to honey. He&rsquo;d always been able to charm his way into any pants he&rsquo;d wanted.<br /><br />Bailey never even tried to compete. Sure, he was a genius and he had money, but he simply wasn&rsquo;t good with people and had given up in his late teens, when he&rsquo;d realized that being super-intelligent didn&rsquo;t seem to make people want to sleep with him. He had huge blue eyes, which were his best feature by far, a stocky body that tended to look more pudgy than strong, and hair that had sadly started thinning in his midthirties. He liked sex&mdash;loved sex&mdash;but rarely found dealing with other people&rsquo;s emotions worth the effort involved.<br /><br />&ldquo;What have you got to lose?&rdquo; John asked, a smile beginning to tug at the corners of his mouth. &ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;ll even find Miss&mdash;or Mister&mdash;Right.&rdquo;<br /><br />Bailey shook his head, knowing he&rsquo;d already given in the moment he&rsquo;d begun thinking about all the variables involved. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet you a steak dinner that at the end of this pseudo-scientific farce, I&rsquo;m still sitting here in this bar with you.&rdquo;<br /><br />John grinned. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re on.&rdquo;"

One killer. Both dreamwalkers. Not every dream should see the light of day...</em></strong><br /><br /><strong>Three very different people have one thing in common-a dreamscape steeped in horror. Barry has had dreams of violent death all his life, and as a cop, he now works to solve the crimes his dreams tell him about in hopes he can save at least one victim from suffering the fate he faces every time he lays his head on his pillow. His ex-lover, Tag&mdash;now his boss&mdash;has no idea how to help him cope other than to protect his job...and try to protect their hearts from the dreams that could end up killing them both.</strong><br /><br /><strong>Layton welcomes the dream state that shows him his next victim. He&#39;s been a killer for as long as he can remember, and the land where he walks in shadow beside the horn-headed man who guides him feels more like home than the waking world. Now, in addition to seeking out those who would kill the innocent and ending their lives in his own special reign of terror, Layton is promised a bride&mdash;someone to love him forever. It seems everything he&#39;s ever dreamed is about to come true.</strong><br /><br /><strong>Jessica just wants to get her life back after her boyfriend is murdered and she is abducted. Twice. Finding herself at Leyton&#39;s mercy is a nightmare she soon finds is only the very beginning. When the horn-headed man visits her, she knows nothing will ever be the same again.</strong><br /><br /><strong>The four of them now have to find a way to navigate the real world while the dream state dictates their very lives and threatens everything they hold dear. If they manage catch a few killers and save a few innocent lives along the way, that will have to be their compensation for the &quot;gifts&quot; given by The Dreaming.</strong><br /><div><a href=""http://www.total-e-bound.com/product.asp?strPageHistory=home&amp;numSearchStartRecord=0&amp;P_ID=1590&amp;CAT_ID=0&amp;numRecordPosition=1"">http://www.total-e-bound.com/product.asp?strPageHistory=home&amp;numSearchStartRecord=0&amp;P_ID=1590&amp;CAT_ID=0&amp;numRecordPosition=1</a></div></div><br /><br /><em>And&nbsp;coming soon from my friend, Alix Bekins, Written in the Stars</em><br /><div style=""line-height: 18px;""><a href=""http://jaime-samms.net/?attachment_id=1110"" rel=""attachment wp-att-1110"" style=""color: #ff4b33; line-height: 18px;""><img alt="""" class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-1110"" height=""300"" src=""http://jaime-samms.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/WrittenStarsLG-200x300.jpg"" style=""border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-top-style: solid; border-right-style: solid; border-bottom-style: solid; border-left-style: solid; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; float: right; "" title=""WrittenStarsLG"" width=""200"" /></a></div><br /><div>Bailey McMillan&rsquo;s life is a mess. The general public blames him for his former employer&rsquo;s nuclear pollution, resulting in professional disgrace. Humiliated, he takes a job as an editor at a science magazine run by his best friend, John. That part isn&rsquo;t so bad; Bailey is fond of John, who seems to find Bailey&rsquo;s abrasive nature amusing.</div><br />Unfortunately, working for John also leads to writing an astrology column in exchange for getting free rein in some op-ed articles&mdash;and then being sued over one. The (totally coincidental) accuracy of the column offers opportunity for further professional disgrace if anyone discovers its author&mdash;and then Bailey digs himself a little deeper.<br /></div><br /><div><br /><br />In an attempt to prove astrology is bogus, he agrees to an experiment to date someone from each star sign. As if that wasn&rsquo;t bad enough, Bailey&rsquo;s got a stupid crush on John, who stubbornly insists on a detailed breakdown of every date&mdash;bad and otherwise.

It means Tools of Justice, co-written by me with Sarah Masters is one step closer t it&#39;s release in May WOOT!!!<br /><br />So, the News:<br /><br /><strong>From the Web:</strong><br /><br />I haven&#39;t spoken up much about the PayPal fiasco.

It explores the very potent world of the family you chose over the family you were born into. It explores responsibility, trust, honesty and forgiveness.

This book has been out for what? A decade? And me a fantasy reader from way back in the beyond, so whats taken me so long to read this series? But I am reading it, at last, and I'm enjoying it. </p><p>It isn't epic fantasy in the tradition of Tolkien. More like...Robin Hood, maybe? Seregil, one of the main characters, is your basic swashbuckler/master of disguise. I know. Those two should be mutually exclusive, but somehow, in this book, anyway, they are not. I'm around a quarter of the way into the book and am finding this character delicately balanced on the knife edge of selfish indifference and paternally overprotective as of his young and clueless apprentice, Alec, whom iveheard is supposed to be his love interest eventually. But I've also been told to be patient on that. </p><p>We all know that's one of my strongest traits...so not!</p><p>And Alec. What is there to say about Alec? He's just stepped over the threshold of manhood. Barely. Seventeen, I think he told Seregil was his age, and newly orphaned (can he be an orphan if he's practically a man?) so he's a man-child of exceedingly naive proportions, and they, he follows Seregil around with nary a twinge of doubt or contemplation over the 'bard's' many disguises, his skill with weapons or ability to bust them both out of a torture dungeon and be away before dawn. And at the same time, the kid can shoot a bow, skin a rabbit, ride a horse, sing, track, guide and do any number of things with confidence and skill. Do I sound tongue in cheek? I might be, a little bit.</p><p>I don't dislike these characters. Don't think that. I like them both as long as I remember to embrace their epic, bigger-than-life qualities. It's been a long time since I read a fantasy novel, i tend to forget, at times, I'm not reading one of my many contemporary paranormal or real world gay love stories. The characters are meant to be competent, intelligent people with the ability to learn and develop necessary skills for survival. They don't have to be tragically flawed just because that's what seems to have become the norm in the books I often read lately. They are allowed to be completely capable men who don't balk when asked to step outside their comfort zone.</p><p>Still. The author in me who loves to torture her own characters would like to see one of them stumble and fall on his face. Just once. Promise I won't laugh....much.....</p><p>But don't let my assessment steer you away. Remember, this is just my opinion of a book I'm still reading, and despite my remarks about the characters seeming perfection, I do like both men and I'm enjoying the read quite a bit.</p><p><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/ipad/link"">LiveJournal app for iPad</a>.</i></span></p>"

He&nbsp;glanced at Jesse, turned to Mike and placed his order, waited until Jesse had&nbsp;ordered and Mike had left before quietly excusing himself from the table.<br /><br />Jesse waited a long time, much longer than it would take for Aadon to use the&nbsp;facilities, before following him.<br /><br />The heavy restroom door swung open on silent hinges, and the peculiar&nbsp;smell of a bathroom trying too hard not to smell like a bathroom engulfed&nbsp;him. Jesse drew in a silent breath and stepped inside.<br /><br />Aadon leaned on the counter by the sinks, his back to the mirror.<br /><br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; Jesse tried to make the apology light, tried to see into&nbsp;Aadon&rsquo;s shrouded eyes.<br /><br />Finally, Aadon looked at him. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;I got a little defensive.&rdquo; He held up his hand, finger and thumb an inch&nbsp;apart, sheepish smile on his face.<br /><br />Aadon stifled a groan. How could he be so fiery one minute, and this&hellip;adorable the next and not know how crazy it made him? He pushed himself&nbsp;off the sink and closed his hand around Jesse&rsquo;s fingers, closing the space and&nbsp;kissing the fingertips. &ldquo;Maybe that&rsquo;s the point. As long as you feel you have&nbsp;to defend yourself around me, I have to be careful.&rdquo; He closed his eyes, kept&nbsp;his lips pressed to his warm fingers.<br /><br />God this was hard. He wasn&rsquo;t doing Jesse any good, wanting him this&nbsp;bad, knowing he couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;shouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;and knowing he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to&nbsp;resist much longer. He shouldn&rsquo;t still even be with him. It was too much. He&nbsp;just wasn&rsquo;t what Jesse needed.<br /><br />Jesse felt the churning sensation in the pit of his stomach even before&nbsp;Aadon spoke again and yanked his hand free, mouth open, ready to fill the&nbsp;void before Aadon could speak. Before he could say what Jesse knew he was&nbsp;about to say. He was too slow.<br /><br />Aadon took his face in both hands, tilting it up and looking into his&nbsp;eyes. &ldquo;As long as I have to be that careful, this can&rsquo;t work.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Because I don&rsquo;t want to be careful, Jesse,&rdquo; Aadon went on, overriding&nbsp;his faint protest, passing a thumb over Jesse&rsquo;s lips and backing him up against<br /><br />&ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; The words warbled out past Jesse&rsquo;s pulse fluttering in his&nbsp;throat. He swallowed hard. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be careful.&rdquo; Aadon&rsquo;s toned body pressed&nbsp;his against the cold metal. The rush of fear and excitement mingled, and he&nbsp;knew he&rsquo;d lost the ability to tell which was which. He didn&rsquo;t know if he cared.<br /><br />&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m not, I could do more damage than Anthony ever did.&rdquo; Aadon&rsquo;s&nbsp;palm caressed his cheek, his fingers slid into Jesse&rsquo;s hair, and he kissed; a&nbsp;light strike of his lips and tongue, there and gone too quickly to capture, but&nbsp;expertly bringing him back down to where he could almost breathe normally.&nbsp;The rush faded, and Jesse wanted it back.<br /><br />He gripped the front of Aadon&rsquo;s shirt, preventing him from moving&nbsp;away. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not anything like Anthony, and I&rsquo;m not who I was then.&rdquo; He&nbsp;never would have demanded Anthony answer his desire like this. Kissing&nbsp;Aadon firmly, not hard or angry, just without compromise, Jesse closed his&nbsp;eyes, willed the other man to understand. He needed this so desperately.&nbsp;Needed to know he was wanted, desired. Needed to know Aadon could look&nbsp;on him as a man and not a shattered thing.&lt;<br /><br />A soft groan welled in Aadon&rsquo;s throat and spilled out into Jesse&rsquo;s kiss.<br /><br />Jesse couldn&rsquo;t breathe, couldn&rsquo;t think, and his fingers tightened to fists"

"event","&nbsp;<br />I&#39;m not entirely sure why I chose this book as the first book I read from <a href=""http://riptidepublishing.com/"" target=""_blank"">Riptide Publishing</a>.&nbsp;It seemed like a good idea at the time?<br /><br /><img alt="""" class=""alignleft size-full wp-image-965"" height=""300"" src=""http://jaime-samms.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/First_Watch.jpg"" style=""border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-top-style: solid; border-right-style: solid; border-bottom-style: solid; border-left-style: solid; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; float: left; "" title=""First_Watch"" width=""200"" /><br /><br />It&#39;s making me...squeamish. It isn&#39;t even very long and I&#39;m finding I have to read it small doses at a time because I&#39;m not liking the situation or, in a strange way, the main character. But still, I feel for him and his predicament. I&#39;m kinda pissed at him for how things are turning out for his friend, but the details on the sale page promise me a HFN ending, so I shall soldier on.<br /><br />And in fact, I don&#39;t want to turn anyone off this book. Just because I&#39;m having difficulty with it doesn&#39;t mean everyone will. Some of my very favorite books, like The Slayer&#39;s Apprentice by Zathyn Priest and the Last Harold Mage Trilogy by Mercedes Lackey, I had this same&nbsp;visceral&nbsp;reaction to. It isn&#39;t a bad reaction, necessarily. Its a strong one. One that can&#39;t be ignored. One that comes when the book is well written, engaging and demanding. That&#39;s strong writing, strong editing, and commitment by the author. It demands commitment from the reader, and you definitely have to be prepared to give this book your attention, whether you like it or not.<br /><br />For me, whether I like the book or not, I suspect will strongly hinge on the ending. If that is as strongly written as the rest, not a cop out, and not gratuitous, then I suspect despite my squeamishness thus far, I will not only like it, but probably re-read it some day. As a writer myself, I can&#39;t ask for more than to touch a reader so deeply they want to read the same thing over again."

Check it out:<br /><br /><i><b><a href=""http://www.dreamspinnerpress.com/store/product_info.php?cPath=55_356&amp;products_id=2644"">&quot;The Dogs of Cyberwar&quot; by Jamie Fessenden</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></i><br /></div><div><b>BLURB</b>&nbsp;Connor is a netrunner: a hacker who ventures into cyberspace to steal data from corporate computers. As he hides out in the slums of Seattle, he&rsquo;s attacked by a street gang and, incredibly, rescued by one of the members. His rescuer is a man named Luis, who has decided Connor needs his protection.</div><div>But instead of providing safety, Luis&rsquo;s presence wreaks havoc with Connor&rsquo;s online identity, and they find themselves hunted by a lethal security force. While they attempt to escape the city, Connor finds himself struggling to survive with the most lethal killer ever pitted against the corporations that control the FreeCorp&mdash;and he risks losing his heart to the same man.</div><div><br /><b>EXCERPT</b> -- Rated PG -- M/M -- &quot;The Dogs of Cyberwar&quot; by Jamie Fessenden</div><div>The gym had sleep capsules in a room off to one side of the locker room. These were &ldquo;rooms&rdquo; just big enough for a person to crawl into and sleep. But&nbsp;they were comfortable enough and provided access to the Net, which Connor would need in order to finish the job he&rsquo;d contracted for.<br />&nbsp;<br />But when he swiped his wrist across the reader and the door swung open, he discovered a new drawback to having Luis for his bodyguard.<br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;Is that big enough for both of us?&rdquo; the Latino asked, peering into the capsule.<br />&nbsp;<br />This took Connor aback. &ldquo;What? No, not really. Can&rsquo;t you get your own?&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have any money,&rdquo; Luis reminded him.<br />&nbsp;<br /><i>Jesus</i>.&nbsp;Just how much was this deal going to end up costing him on a regular basis?<br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;I suppose I could rent you a capsule,&rdquo; Connor said, not bothering to hide his annoyance. The capsules were pretty pricey.<br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Luis replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just keep watch out here.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be ridiculous. You have to sleep.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m locked in another capsule, I might not hear if somebody comes after you.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like I get attacked every time I try to sleep,&rdquo; Connor protested. But he could see from the look in Luis&rsquo;s eyes that this argument wouldn&rsquo;t get him anywhere. Luis had decided that Connor needed to be protected. And that meant not leaving his side, apparently. &ldquo;So your idea of being my bodyguard is pretty much what other people would call a &lsquo;stalker&rsquo;?&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think your bodyguard should be nearby whenever you need him?&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;If I have to take a shit, are you going to come into the stall with me?&rdquo; Connor asked him, irritated. &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t answer that. We&rsquo;ll save it for a surprise. In the meantime, if you&rsquo;re going to be like this, you might as well just get in the goddamned capsule with me. They&rsquo;re big enough for two, if<br />you don&rsquo;t mind being snug. But leave everything you don&rsquo;t need in the locker.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />Following his own advice, Connor stripped to his underwear. There certainly wasn&rsquo;t going to be room in there to undress if Luis was inside with him. The one thing he brought in was his cyber deck.<br />&nbsp;<br />Luis followed his example and stripped to his underwear, though he insisted on bringing his gun with him into the capsule. Connor prayed neither of them rolled over on it in the night.<br />&nbsp;<br />It was pretty cramped when they were both inside and the door was locked, but thankfully the capsule had air conditioning. Not that Luis smelled bad. In fact, once he was stretched out beside Connor, his chest at the level of<br />Connor&rsquo;s face, Connor found that he liked the faint masculine musk Luis seemed to radiate. The scent was clean and held a trace of the generic liquid soap available in the gym shower, but it was unmistakably manly.<br />&nbsp;<br />It was impossible for their skin not to touch in this close space, but Luis didn&rsquo;t seem to care. When Connor glanced up at his face, he found Luis looking at him thoughtfully with those beautiful dark eyes. Not for the first time, Connor wondered whether Luis was gay or straight. So far, he hadn&rsquo;t given much indication&mdash;unless the fact that he had a strong desire to make himself subservient to another man was a sign.<br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;Um&hellip; just so we&rsquo;re clear about this,&rdquo; Connor began, uncertain how exactly to phrase the question, &ldquo;Are you&hellip;expecting sex out of this arrangement?&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />Luis shook his head, smiling at his discomfort. &ldquo;No. Although I did my time giving hand jobs for money, so if you want me to get you off&hellip;.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Connor answered quickly. Luis was certainly not the first guy he&rsquo;d known who&rsquo;d resorted to prostitution to get by, so he didn&rsquo;t fault him for it. But he didn&rsquo;t want some guy helping him &ldquo;get off&rdquo; if the guy wasn&rsquo;t enjoying it himself. &ldquo;So you don&rsquo;t like guys, then?&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />Luis shrugged. &ldquo;I guess I don&rsquo;t really care one way or another. If I like someone, I&rsquo;ll fuck them. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if they&rsquo;re male or female.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;All right. That&rsquo;s cool. I generally just like guys, myself.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;<i>Muy bien</i>.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />That seemed to end the discussion. Connor wasn&rsquo;t certain if he liked the fact that Luis had left the possibility of sex open. This guy was already complicating his life. If they started fucking around, it would get even more complicated.<br />&nbsp;<br /><i>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</i><br />&nbsp;<br />Luis smiled at Connor and lowered his head to the pillow they&rsquo;d be sharing. &ldquo;I already have a job as a bodyguard.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t pay.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;Just feed me. That&rsquo;s all I need.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;And a &lsquo;purpose&rsquo;?&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;I want someone to protect,&rdquo; Luis said, his voice beginning to sound sleepy. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like being the bad guy. Is that wrong?&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />Connor sighed. &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not wrong. But you realize you&rsquo;re protecting someone who steals and destroys data, don&rsquo;t you? I&rsquo;m not exactly a &lsquo;good guy,&rsquo; myself.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;<br />There was no response, and Connor glanced up to see that Luis had drifted off. Asleep, there was something innocent and childlike in his beautiful face. Of course, Connor had to remind himself, this was the man he&rsquo;d just seen cut two men into tiny pieces.</div>"

His book,&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.dreamspinnerpress.com/store/index.php?cPath=55_429"" target=""_blank"">Hot Head</a>, has made it into &nbsp;the semi-finals&nbsp;of Goodreads&#39;s best romance of 2011. So that&#39;s cool beans. Congrats, Damon. As I&#39;ve mentioned my opinion before, well deserved. (It might be I keep talking about this because I just love&nbsp;the&nbsp;look of the cover and want to post it again. That&#39;s always a possibility.)<br /><br />This week, I finally took some time for myself and watched a movie. <a href=""http://jaime-samms.net/2011/11/20/sunday-entertainment-nov-19-2011/torch-song-trilogy-2/"" rel=""attachment wp-att-878""><img alt="""" class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-878"" height=""300"" src=""http://jaime-samms.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Torch-Song-Trilogy1-206x300.jpg"" style=""border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-top-style: solid; border-right-style: solid; border-bottom-style: solid; border-left-style: solid; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; float: left; "" title=""Torch-Song-Trilogy"" width=""206"" /></a>I picked up <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Torch-Song-Trilogy-Anne-Bancroft/dp/B0001HAGRE"" target=""_blank"">Torch Song Trilogy</a>. Now, I&#39;m not a gay guy, so I might have missed a few cliches present in this movie. I dare say there were more than a few, like the gay bashing death of beloved, the bi guy who can&#39;t decide what he wants, and the mother...the&nbsp;Jewish, New York mother...wow. But...She was definitely cliche, yes.&nbsp;She&nbsp;was also...oddly sympathetic, though at some points I wanted to hate her. I really did, but in the end, couldn&#39;t, because she might have been closed off and narrow in her definitions of things, but she didn&#39;t stay that way. She <em>tried</em>, and that made all&nbsp;the&nbsp;difference as&nbsp;to how I felt about her character. And the scene between Arnold and his mother?<br /><blockquote><i>&quot;You want to be a part of my life, I&#39;m not editing out the parts you don&#39;t like...There&#39;s one more thing you&#39;d better understand: I have taught myself to sew, cook, build furniture, fix plumbing, I can even pat myself on the back when necessary. All so that I don&#39;t have to ask anyone for anything. There&#39;s nothing I need from anyone except love and respect and anyone who can&#39;t give me those two things has no place in my life.&quot;</i></blockquote><br />That will be one of my favorite scenes in any movie for a really long time, I think. I can&#39;t think of a sentiment truer to life than that, and brilliantly presented, writing, acting, everything. Great movie. I&#39;ll probably rent it again.<br /><br /><strong>WHAT MY PUBLISHERS ARE UP TO<a href=""http://jaime-samms.net/2011/11/20/sunday-entertainment-nov-19-2011/dsp-2x3/"" rel=""attachment wp-att-882""><img alt="""" class=""alignright size-full wp-image-882"" height=""300"" src=""http://jaime-samms.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/DSP-2x3.gif"" style=""border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-top-style: solid; border-right-style: solid; border-bottom-style: solid; border-left-style: solid; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; float: left; "" title=""DSP-2x3"" width=""200"" /></a></strong> There are three special events going on at Dreamspinner between now and the end of November that you may want to know about: First, we&#39;re having a We Are Thankful Sale, 20% off everything on the web site through Nov. 30.

Well done, TJ. It's on my list of books to read. Looks like I'm going to have to move it up the queue.



A lovely book trailer for Salad on the Side author, Karenna Colcroft, though it isn't for Salad, it's still a pretty thing to show off, and it was made by Winterheart Designs.&nbsp;<a href=""http://youtu.be/0eH51WRGMkc""></a><a href=""http://youtu.be/0eH51WRGMkc"">0eH51WRGMkc</a> I confess, I have no idea how to embed this.

<strong>IN PERSONAL NEWS</strong>

This past week, I signed a contract with Dreamspinner Press for a new short story that will be published in May of 2012, under their Bittersweet line. How excited am I by that? Very. It's a re-print, called Paying the Piper, and while some of my really faithful readers from years past might have read it, I do think it will be new to most of you. I'll keep you posted on this as things progress.

Just him and his Harley. Stars brightened the sky without a cloud to mar his vision. The State Boulevard Bridge was coming up and he liked to park there on his late nights and stare out at the water below with the city sounds behind him. It was peaceful after the day he&rsquo;d had. Some days he hated being the oldest of six and head of his family. But only fleetingly, because he loved each and every one of his brothers and sisters and wouldn&rsquo;t trade them for anything.<br /><br />He turned the corner and something seemed out of place. Was that&mdash;? It couldn&rsquo;t be. As Ray got closer he saw the back of a woman, her straight, long, black hair almost reaching a cute, firm ass covered by a short skirt. How she kept her balance on the handrail of the bridge in those heels, Ray had no idea. She had nice legs, but what the hell was she thinking?<br /><br />Startling her was a bad idea. She&rsquo;d fall for sure. He revved the bike to alert her before coming to a stop and lowering the kickstand. Traffic had been light so he figured he had to be the first one to see the woman. There was no way she&rsquo;d be missed as a person drove by, the street lights had her illuminated. Ray took off his helmet, set it on the seat, put his blinkers on and casually walked over.<br /><br />&quot;Um. Excuse me. Miss? What exactly are you doing up there?&quot; He spoke softly because he was a big bear of a man and didn&rsquo;t want to scare the poor thing. He knew he came off looking rough, being six-three with a barrel chest. The tats and beard probably didn&rsquo;t help either. He looked like what he was&mdash;a biker.<br /><br />&quot;I&rsquo;m going to jump.&quot; The woman never turned around. Her voice was low and husky. It caressed his ears.<br /><br />Ray moved closer so he could grab her hand and yank her off the rail if the ridiculous idea he&rsquo;d just concocted to distract her from jumping failed.<br /><br />&quot;A kiss!&quot; he blurted. &quot;Could I kiss you goodbye? That is, if you really think you need to jump.&quot; Suave he wasn&rsquo;t, but he&rsquo;d never been in a situation like this before and would hope if it was one of his siblings someone would try and help them any way they could.<br /><br />The woman finally turned. She was a vision of beauty with high cheekbones, dark sherry- coloured eyes and a small pert nose. Red plump lips, just meant for kissing, framed the most gorgeous mouth. He couldn&rsquo;t tell how old she was. Her face had a timeless quality. She was short and slim and the shirt she was wearing hid her breasts so it looked like she had none, but that didn&rsquo;t distract from her looks at all.<br />&quot;Okay, but no touching.&quot; The girl sat down on the railing and leaned towards him. Ray licked his lips in anticipation. He wanted the kiss more than he should. This woman was troubled and he was just trying to help.<br /><br />Keep telling yourself that, Hoss. Maybe you&rsquo;ll believe it.<br /><br />Ray ignored the inner voice and gently pressed his lips to the woman&rsquo;s. He&rsquo;d only wanted to get her in a better position to drag her away from the edge, but it turned into more.<br /><br />She whimpered and opened her mouth, touching his lips with her tongue. Ray opened to let her explore. She was hesitant at first, but that didn&rsquo;t last long. The woman tangled her hands in his hair and cradled him between her legs. Ray wanted to press their bodies together, but she resisted so he didn&rsquo;t push it.<br /><br />Finally they broke apart. Ray was stunned. He&rsquo;d never been kissed so passionately before. Sure, he&rsquo;d had his fair share of women, and men for that matter, but something about the kiss was more than he&rsquo;d ever thought possible.<br /><br />&quot;Damn, girl! A woman who kisses like that should not deprive the world of her talent. I&rsquo;m Ray by the way. Rayne Carr. Please tell me why you&rsquo;re thinking of diving off the bridge.&quot; He rested his forehead on hers and hoped she would answer.<br /><br />She pulled him closer and his dick hardened. This was so inappropriate it wasn&rsquo;t even funny. Wait, was that&mdash;?</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><a href=""http://www.total-e-bound.com/product.asp?strParents=&amp;CAT_ID=&amp;P_ID=1399"" target=""_blank"">http://www.total-e-bound.com/product.asp?strParents=&amp;CAT_ID=&amp;P_ID=1399</a><br /><br />&nbsp;<br />"

I&#39;ve lifted her short bio from her author page at Total E-bound:&nbsp;<i>An avid reader for years, one day Carol Lynne decided to write her own brand of erotic romance. Carol juggles between being a full-time mother and a full-time writer. These days, you can usually find Carol either cleaning jelly out of the carpet or nestled in her favourite chair writing steamy love scenes.</i><br /><br /><b>Check out the blurb, for starters:&nbsp;</b>After the death of his father, Grayson Conner finds himself running, Sunset Ridge Stables, a prosperous horse breeding operation just outside of Wellington, Arkansas. Since riding a horse for the first time, Gray has known running the ranch would be his destiny. Years spent watching his father negotiate and build the ranch into a highly respected operation prepared him well.<br /><br />In need of a manager to oversee the hired hands, Gray hires Jack &ldquo;Ram&rdquo; Ramsdale, a sexy temptation that could spell nothing but trouble. For years, Gray managed to keep his sexual preferences away from the ranch, but the introduction of Ram into his life changes everything.<br /><br />Ram fell in love with Sunset Ridge Stables the first time he stepped foot on the ranch with its rolling green hills and views to take a person&rsquo;s breath away. The handsome ranch owner is definitely a bonus, but more than anything Ram is searching for a place to belong.<br /><br />With temptation at his fingertips, Gray gives in to his feelings and begins an intense affair with his new manager. For a few blissful months he believes he can have it all, the ranch and a man he loves at his side. When local gossip threatens the reputation of the Sunset Ridge, Gray and Ram are forced to make an important decision. Give up their relationship or lose everything they&rsquo;ve worked for.<br /><br />Now anyone who has read a Carol Lynne book knows this is going to be fantastic!!! Pre-Order it <a href=""http://www.total-e-bound.com/product.asp?strParents=&amp;CAT_ID=&amp;P_ID=1427"" target=""_blank"">here</a>, because you know you want hot cowboys as much as I do!!!&nbsp;<br />"

"event","The release I wanted to show off today is, yes, another het, but no one writes het like my pal Lex. This universe where Weylyn&#39;s Gift is set is so rich in detail and chuck full of shifters, and dragons and all kinds of fantastic creatures of magic, and this book is just one more painting in that beautiful tapestry that includes both het and m/m love stories. I&#39;ve read a few shorts and snippets, and am stoked that there are more to come.<br /><br />Thanks to Lex for sharing her new release with me today :)<br /><br />Buy link:&nbsp;<a href=""http://pinkpetalbooks.com/Encounters-Weylyns-Gift-by-Lex-Valentine.html"" target=""_blank"">http://pinkpetalbooks.com/<wbr />Encounters-Weylyns-Gift-by-<wbr />Lex-Valentine.html</a><br />&nbsp;<br />Blurb:<br />Werewolf Weylyn Randall is bi-sexual and happily carefree. He spends his nights fucking and playing bass in a band. &nbsp;His days are spent recuperating for another go-round when the sun goes down.&nbsp; Nothing gives Weylyn more pleasure than getting his &ldquo;were&rdquo; on. After years of this hedonistic lifestyle he doesn&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a mate out there for him. He&rsquo;s happy having encounters with whomever strikes his fancy and hooking up with best friend and occasional lover, Drake Keating, whenever possible. Then Drake sends him a gift in a plain brown wrapper. Along with the gift comes a magical woman and between the two, they unleash the next phase in Weylyn&rsquo;s wild sex life.<br />&nbsp;<br /><a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/dontkickmycane/pic/0005gsfe/""><img alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/dontkickmycane/pic/0005gsfe"" style=""margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; float: left; width: 200px; height: 300px; "" /></a>Excerpt:<br />Nothing about the brown cardboard box seemed out of the ordinary. It had normal computer-generated shipping labels, simple and lacking in any information whatsoever about the sender. The return address belonged to a company called &ldquo;Plain Brown Wrapper.&rdquo; The name made Weylyn instantly suspicious. Any company with a name as innocuous as that had to be anything but plain.<br /><br />Weylyn shook the box. It made a whooshing sound as the contents slid around inside. He grimaced, realizing he&rsquo;d never know what was inside the box unless he opened it. Taking out a pocket knife, he slit the packing tape carefully, preoccupied with trying to figure out which of the people he&rsquo;d fucked recently had sent him a present. He was confident enough in his abilities as a lover to know that he hadn&rsquo;t left anyone angry and unsatisfied, so the package couldn&rsquo;t be anything but a gift.<br /><br />He put away the pocket knife and peeled back the flaps of cardboard. Lifting out the crinkled brown packing paper, he found a flat cellophane package with bright neon pink plastic contents. Weylyn frowned. Pink wasn&rsquo;t exactly his color, and he couldn&rsquo;t imagine anyone buying him a pink anything. Upon closer inspection, he decided that it looked like some kind of floating device like a raft for the pool.<br /><br />Weylyn pulled the package out and ripped open the cellophane, taking out the hunk of pink plastic. His sensitive werewolf nose crinkled as a strong scent assailed him. Whew! Whatever it was, it stunk to high heaven. Petroleum based products always reeked and he had a nose more sensitive than most. Whoever sent him the gift either hadn&rsquo;t realized how delicate his nose was, hadn&rsquo;t really thought about how stinky plastic might be or didn&rsquo;t care.<br /><br />As Weylyn began to unfold the pink plastic, he discovered that the sender hadn&rsquo;t cared about the stink of the plastic. He held in his hands a gag gift. At least, he figured it for a gag gift. The plastic turned out to be a pink blow up chair&hellip; with a big thick dildo attached to the seat.<br />He frowned at the chair for a long moment. Then he began to grin. As he reached for the box to search for a card, he began to laugh. It had been a long time since he&rsquo;d seen anything so amusing. Now, he wanted to know who had sent it. Obviously, the sender knew he was bi-sexual. The chair wouldn&rsquo;t be nearly as funny if he&rsquo;d been straight.<br /><br />His hands touched a sheet of paper. Pulling it out, he read.<br /><br /><i>&ldquo;Hey Wey!</i><br /><br /><i>I was sure you would like this. I tried to get it in blue, but they were out of that color. I know that sometimes you get nothing but pussy thrown your way. This chair is for those times you&rsquo;re missing some male action. After all, I wouldn&rsquo;t want you to fall out of practice. See you the next time your band comes to NYC.</i><br /><br /><i>Drake&rdquo;</i><br /><br />So maybe it wasn&rsquo;t exactly a gag gift after all, Weylyn thought, fingering the thick dildo. In fact, come to think of it, the stiff rubber dick resembled Drake&rsquo;s cock. The shape of the head, the thickness of the base, the way the veins stood out&hellip;<br /><br />Weylyn grinned as he realized that he&rsquo;d become aroused. Not that it took much. A horn dog at the best of times, getting his &ldquo;were&rdquo; on was his primary goal in life. After his music, of course. Luckily, his music usually made it really easy to get his were on. His innate wolfish attractiveness didn&rsquo;t hurt either. And he had an outgoing and fun loving personality. It was a combination most people couldn&rsquo;t resist, which meant he never suffered from a shortage of partners.<br /><br />A hunt through his closet produced a pump to blow up the chair. Once filled with air, Weylyn set it down facing his television. He stared at it with a little smile curling his lips. Drake loved to fuck. He&rsquo;d loved fucking Weylyn so the chair wasn&rsquo;t exactly a gag gift. Still, it amused Weylyn.<br /><br />He left the chair in the living room of his small flat and went into the bedroom. He had a gig tonight and had to get ready. He didn&rsquo;t have time for the chair at the moment. After a shower, he dressed in leather jeans, a sleeveless t-shirt, and boots. He smudged a little black eyeliner under his eyes and ran a hand through his damp brown waves. Done with his primping, he grabbed his jacket and headed for the door. He stopped, the door halfway open, and looked back at the chair.<br /><br />Damn. It looked totally hot just sitting there waiting for someone to use it. Weylyn&rsquo;s cock stirred, and he quickly eyed the clock. A discreet cough from the other side of his door made his head jerk around toward the sound. His gaze met the amused jade gaze of a woman he&rsquo;d never seen before.<br /><br />&ldquo;Nice chair,&rdquo; she murmured in a husky voice.<br /><br />&ldquo;Gag gift,&rdquo; Weylyn replied shortly, looking her up and down, and feeling oddly shell-shocked.<br /><br />What stood before him was far hotter than the pink chair. Nicely rounded full breasts on a petite body. Long, dark silky hair spilled over slender shoulders in a thin t-shirt. Wide dark green eyes in a small triangular face. A pert nose. Moist pale pink bowed lips. A tiny beauty mark at the corner of those smiling lips. Oh, yeah, he thought as lust roared to life within him.<br /><br />&ldquo;Mmm. I can see what part would gag you,&rdquo; she purred, her eyes glowing preternaturally.<br /><br />It can only get better from there :D<br />"

Even while the author has broken down those walls between reader, character and author, I still feel a bit distanced from Trip. On the other hand, I think I'm meant to feel that there seem to be layers of all kinds in this book, the idea floating over everything that none of it is what it appears to be, and Trip keeps everyone at a distance, even when he's talking to you on this intimate a level. It's odd and at the same time, oddly <i>fitting</i> for a book narrated by a southern boy of breeding. </p><p>I'm enjoying this book so far, because it's interesting to see how a character can be shaped so well just by the voice with which the author choses to tell that character's story. This book is anything but typical, and that's what I like. Maybe not everyone will appreciate the laid back distance the MC uses to tell his tale, but I do love the way the technique builds an extra diminution into Trip's personality and into the book itself. </p><p>I'm ready to read on and find out who the mystery man is.</p><p><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/ipad/link"">LiveJournal app for iPad</a>.</i></span></p>"

In fact, if you hit every blog post on the tour, you'll be entered to win a terrific grand prize (which, sad little me, I forget what it is this time around, but I do remember actually wanting it myself....) *sigh* I want so <i>many</i> things, alas... go here: http://jaime-samms.net/2011/09/03/labour-day-2011-blog-hop/ to read my free little story and enter the hop.</p><p>And finally, um....there was something else... oh dag. I forget. It'll come to me, though, and when it does, I'll be sure and let y'all know.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=""font-size: x-small;""><i>Posted via <a href=""http://m.livejournal.com/ipad/link"">LiveJournal app for iPad</a>.</i></span></p>"

"event","Bitch, bitch, bitch. I think some days the world is just too big, and I'm just not enough to cover all the bases. I know this is where I usually step back and say how I know I don't have it all that hard la-dee-dah-dee-dah

Fuck that. Today, I just want to bitch.

I want to feel like my contributions are enough, and that the people around me are working just as hard as I am. They aren't. I can look and see that they aren't, and it pisses me off. I'm sure there are people out there saying the same about me. I'm SURE. But can I say I don't want to work this hard if you're not going to work this hard, too? Can I say that? Or is that just petty? I think it's petty. I think I should just set my own standards and live to them and not hold anyone else to them. I think that's reasonable. I also think it's reasonable to expect the people benefiting from my living up to my own standards to at least acknowledge that they have it pretty damn good, thank you very much.

I want to feel like I can say ""this bothers me"" and it will matter to the person I say it to. It doesn't. They will continue to be who they are. My choice is to put up with it or not to. I know that. Can I know that and still be friction' annoyed as hell? 

So. Everyone has family. Everyone has moments. Today is mine. Tomorrow might be different. I might feel different. Who can tell teh future?"

"event","&nbsp;Today, I hesitated and decided against a Savvy Author's workshop that would have cost me $25 and sounded like a very good workshop on BDSM for writers. (I did buy the book. Just waiting on delivery) I am quite sure I could have learned a great deal from this class, as I do tend to lean heavily toward that D/s dynamic a lot of the time, however, I just couldn't bring myself to spend the monyy, for some reason.<br /><img width=""250"" height=""375"" vspace=""10"" hspace=""10"" border=""0"" align=""right"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/dontkickmycane/pic/00059t2f"" /><div><br /><img width=""200"" height=""300"" vspace=""10"" hspace=""10"" border=""0"" align=""left"" alt="""" src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/dontkickmycane/pic/00058rxr"" />The, this evening, I did not hesitate to pay about $9.00 for &quot;Healing in His Wings&quot; by Ariel Tachna and&nbsp;Nicki Bennet, and &nbsp;&quot;Any Closer&quot; by Mary Calms. Just shelled that dough out there for the books, without a thought.&nbsp;<br /><br />To quote Ron: &quot;She needs to sort out her priorities...&quot;<br /><br />Or not. :D<br /><br />&nbsp;</div>"

"event","Well, Good news: I have landed a chance to put some of my print titles in the local Chapters/Indigo book store. SO I get to see my very own name up there on the book shelf beside all those famous authors. If anyone knows how much time I have spent hanging out in that book store over the years, you would understand my enthusiasm over this news :) Very happy.<br /><br />I've finished two titles, one of which was written with the wonderful Sarah Masters and retains our odd mix of horror/romance that is next to impossible to&nbsp;categorize. But you know me. I don't do boxes well. I have high hopes for both stories, and when I have news, I'll pass it along.<br /><br />My buddy Jambrea Jo Jones has sparked the best idea for one of my Rainbow Alley&nbsp;characters, Jacob, and he'll be getting a short tale of his own after Cliff tossed him over in <a target=""_blank"" href=""http:// http://www.total-e-bound.com/product.asp?strParents=&amp;CAT_ID=205&amp;P_ID=1193"">Fix This, Sir</a>.<br /><br />New releases:&nbsp;<br /><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.dreamspinnerpress.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=2424"">New Linen</a> at Dreamspiner Press:&nbsp;<br /><br /><em>Until now, Drew and Garrett had been playing at the whole dominance thing, but this weekend is different. Drew is already losing himself to the implacable will of his new Master and they have yet to make anything official. That&rsquo;s what this weekend is supposed to be about &ndash; Garrett making Drew his &ndash; unless the memories from Garrett&rsquo;s past are too strong to let him meet Drew&rsquo;s ultimatum of the real thing or nothing at all.</em><br /> <br /><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://pinkpetalbooks.com/Finding-Home-by-Jaime-Samms.html"">Finding Home</a> at Pink Petal Books, which is the last book oin my Ageless Series<br /><br /><strong>Series Blurb</strong>:<br />In a world&nbsp;disintegrating&nbsp;under the weight of too many people, the Ageless men and women are finding their lifespan&nbsp;stretching well beyond normal, and discovering they have abilities never before documented. When children are few and far between, and people find they can shift to animal form with a thought, the rift between those doomed to age and die and those who seem ageless is growing.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Morgan has taken advantage of this rift to seize control of the central nervous system of the world's social structure and make his bid for world domination. It's up to Mikko and Ken and their small band of friends to stop the takeover even as they struggle on a much more personal level to find love and balance with one another.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>&nbsp;Book Blurb:<br /></strong> <em>Mikko's life is turned upside down when his old mentor, Morgan infiltrates his mind and forces him to hurt the lover he's been trying to save. The attack leaves them both broken and uncertain, and Ken decides leaving is the only way to save Mikko more pain. Accompanied by friends who seem to have designs on something more, ken sets out on a quest to find Morgan and stop him. <br />&nbsp;<br />Old friends and new lovers are all&nbsp;the&nbsp;pair have to sustain them on their individual&nbsp;journeys.&nbsp;There's no telling if they'll ever find the peace they seek for the world, or for themselves</em>.<br /><br />I suppose if I updated more often, there wouldn't be so much news to throw at you all :D But as you can see, I've been busy. Now, I must get started on this other story idea Jambie has embedded in my brain..."

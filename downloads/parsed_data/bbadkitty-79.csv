"event","Lord, it's been a year since I last posted on this thing. I have totally become a myspace geek. Anyway, nothing new since I last logged in. I no longer work at Bortolami's. It was a fun place with coworkers that were great, but I felt like working there was draining my spirit a little. I found a job at Kohl's doing what's called ""Ad Set"". It's okay. I don't hate it. I am bothered that I don't have a lot of hours because the position is only part time. I originally applied for customer service, but because I said in the interview that I would be willing to work until 1 am they hired me for ad set. I like the crew that I am in though. They are pretty interesting to say the least. We've kind of had a battle with the other departments in the store because one, they were talking trash about the Ad Set crew, and two, they seemed eager to blame us for pricing issues in customer complaints. On top of the fact, that Ad Set is usually left out of any special employee activities that other departments enjoy. Case in point, our holiday party which was held at Big Al's from 6-9 at night when we had Ad Set work at 8pm. Not very considerate. I ended up not going because most of my crew couldn't go. One ended up going and brought back some pizza and desert for the Ad Set crew. By the time they had a break to enjoy it, the associates from the other departments had already devoured the entire treat without apologies. So, the next night, one of the assistant managers bought us all pizzas with cheese sticks and cinnamon sticks and had reprimanded the guilty associates. Bastards! 
I have benefits through Kohl's, which is nice. I only pay about $14 dollars a paycheck, which is every week, so about $60 a month. I don't think the coverage is great, but at least it's something. 
I am still trying to find a good full time job, but as usual, am having difficulties. My confidence, once again, is not that great considering I have applied to multiple places, some of them multiple times. I feel like my luck in the job department doesn't exist basically. sigh.
I haven't gone out too much, mainly because I have been broke. I saw Julie and Dan on Monday and went out to dinner with them and Crissy and Dee. That was fun, but T.G.I. Fridays needs to hire new servers. BAD customer service. I didn't tip, that's how bad it was. 
Lately, I've been getting the strongest itch to move out. I want my own space so bad. Nothing wrong with my parents, but I feel suffocated in my tiny room and it would be nice not to give up dates on my schedule and whereabouts throughout the day. Sigh, again.
Anyhoo, that's my life right now. I'll try to be more attentive to my journal."

"event","Hey, I know I havent been on here in a while. Sorry. I'll try to be more attentive. So, what have I been up to lately? Not much. Working, looking for another job, hanging out at home cuz I aint got no life. 
At the moment I am kind of boy crazy. For awhile I've liked someone who's such a cool guy. Problem is, as always, I think I've struck out for the umpteenth time because I don't think he likes me in the same way. We have a lot in common, like the same stupid jokes, and the lack of a social life. He's so charming and funny and cute, which is all I like in a guy. But, once again, I don't think he sees me that way. Also what sucks is a friend of mine also has a crush on this guy for basically the same reasons.
What I am trying to do now is convince myself that it's never going to happen with this guy and that I should move on. I hate how I am when I am around a crush too. I get all nervy and wierd and say stupid things. I feel like an idiot. Just awkward. It's wierd, because I totally feel like we're kindred spirits because we do have a lot in common, but that could just mean that we're meant to be good friends.Sigh....."

"event","So, I didn't go with my parents' to my uncle's house for Thanksgiving. I ended up just staying home by myself. I did, however, manage to make a decent Thanksgiving meal, even if it was for one. I baked turkey cutlets with some seasoning, stuffing, deviled eggs, creamed  corn, green beans, and bought a bottle of cran-apple cider, which I am finishing off at the moment. By the way, it tastes really good with Grey Goose vodka. For dessert, which I haven't had yet, I made an apple pie. 
So, it went well. 
I got invited to a lot of places, but ultimately I decided to stay home. I don't know why. I think that I am just in a self-pity mood. Also, I didn't want to intrude on someone else's family gathering, especially when I wished we had one of our own here, but my stepdad wanted to go to my uncle's. My mom left sad today, one because I wasn't going, and two, because she didn't want to go either. She wanted to stay home, too. 
I wouldn't say this Thanksgiving sucks, because it didn't, but I would say that it could have been better."

"event","Hey there. I know I haven't posted in a while. So, it's countdown to the end of the semester and I have so much to do still it sucks. On top of that, my laptop died on me and i have to get a new Motherboard for it, which is not cheap. I'm actually going to call HP and see if they can take care of it because of I've only had it for a year. Then, my car's power steering went out so I can't drive. Oh, and the dvd player in my television has been down, so I haven't been able to watch DVDs on either my computer or my television. So, it's been kind of a sucky last couple of weeks. 
I feel like I really could use something good, whether getting laid, or seeing old friends I dont know. 
Oh, and another thing, I just found out that we aren't having T-giving here this year. My parents want to go to my uncle's house on MT. Hood for dinner. I don't want to go because, one, it will be boring because it will just be my parents and I, my uncle and his family (who I don't know very well), and grandfather (who I am looking forward to seeing, but probably won't have very much to talk about.) We've always had dinner here. My sister and my nephew showing up and my self-centered stepsiblings coming and eating the awesome food that Mom does exquisite on. 
I am really considering not going. Im thinking about making my own Thanksgiving. I don't really feel like driving an hour and a half to go to a place where I will be bored out of my mind. I've never cooked thanksgiving meal, but if its for one, it shouldn't be too hard."

"event","Hey guys, it's me again. I haven't posted in awhile and I've been quite neglectful on this thing. I've been having an affair with Myspace and have abandoned my livejournal. Oh, how irresponsible of me.
Anyhoo, went to Seattle this weekend. I desperately needed to leave town, even if it was for the day. Last week was not a good week. I had so much going on with school and my grandmother passed away.It was something that, by Friday, I had to get out of here. 
Anyway, Delicia and I ended up leaving early Saturday Morning and went up to Puyallup, near Tacoma, to see the Oktoberfest. It was interesting. They had an actually German or Swiss police car, which I took a picture of (will post on myspace)that was cool. Didn't have any beer, because they were charging a butt load for each serving. So, we ate some food and listened to German music and watch people attempt to dance to German music. Dee got her groove on with this older gentlemen in a sports suit who was way too enthusiastic about the music, which was hilarious. 
After that, we went on to Seattle and met up with Dee's friend, Tory. We went and had drinks at a nearby Australian pub and ended up getting buzzed pretty early. After that wore off, we went and had dinner at the Spaghetti Factory, where Dee had a really strong drink and was getting slightly tipsy off of. 
Upon deciding that we were, in fact, going to just stay the night, instead of heading home that night, we went to this bar called ""Dante's"" which was playing hard core metal that, if sober would give anyone a headache. I got nice and buzzed as well as Dee and Tory and then we went dancing where this wierd chick in a red outfit came up and wanted to dance with me. Successfully warding her off, we continued dancing until we couldn't do it anymore and went back to the table with the birthday party that was going on that Tory knew about.
Sunday, after sleeping in and constantly being awakened by Shaquira's ""Hips Dont Lie"" on Tory's roommate's cellphone, we all went to breakfast at a nearby diner that served humongous portions of omelets, hashbrowns, and pancakes. It was funny, because we were sitting next to a table that this guy was talking loudly at. He was going off on how his ex was a bitch and that she broke his heart and if it wasn't for ""ultimate frisbee"" he didn't know where he would be. I guess I shouldn't laugh, but it was funny anyway. He was so serious about it too. Anyway, we had to wait until they left, before we could have a good laugh about it. 
After that, we went back to Tory's had some beer and watched more football. We didn't do a whole lot, but it was a nice excursion anyway. And, once again, I felt sad that we were leaving Seattle, I think I've developed a love-affair with it. Anyway, now it's back to the grind, but Im already trying to plan another trip, this time I want to see the ""Dead Sea Scrolls"" that are at the Pacific Science Museum near the SpaceNeedle. Ah, good times."

"event","So, Tuesday I went to Mike's for our weekly NIP/TUCK fix and unbeknownst to me, I accidentally locked my keys out of my car. I didn't realize it until we were all leaving. If it isn't one thing with my car it's another. Anyway, after about an hour of trying to use a hanger, Stephanie's boyfriend and I couldn't get it open, so I had to call a locksmith. After waiting a half hour and paying $54, I finally managed to get myself home. So, why am I still a little bugged? Don't get me wrong, I know that there's only so much one can do with that kind of situation, not everybody knows what to do. But, with my friends from work and other people being there, it kind of sucked that only one other person, besides Mike, stayed around and offered to help me. Like I said, there's only so much one can do, and there wasn't much anyone could do, but at least be sincere enough to say ""Is there anything I can do?"" or something like that. I just kind of felt that people didn't really think about it, and I know its minor, but it kind of hurt my feelings.  I know that if a friend of mine was in that position, I would have at least extended an offer to help out and not run out to my car and take off. 
This isn't a personal attack on anyone. I'm just writing what I'm feeling at the moment. I just kind of felt that that wasn't cool. Anyway....

WENT and saw ""Wicked"" on Sunday. It was awesome. I loved the set and the costumes the most I think. The lead actresses sang really beautifully. I didn't read the book, so I didn't know what to expect, but it was good. and funny. Later I found out that it is alot different than the book, but I like the musical version better from the sounds of it.

And tomorrow I am going to go see Jackass2. Way to class it up, huh? A Broadway play,then a movie about a bunch of guys that punch each other in the balls. Oh, well,what can I say, I'm wierd."

I just got done with school, finals were last week. Now, I can breathe, until I see my grades, which I will do next.

"event","Today started out great! (sarcastically) My mom lost her job, because basically her boss wanted to demote her and put my mom's coworker in her place. My mom told her boss that she wouldn't do it, and her boss said basically she could either ""take it or leave it."" What a fucking bitch. I really wanted to go to my mom's office and officially beat the shit out that lady.  She just hired my mom a year ago this month. The woman, or she-devil, just opened her own clinic and barely knows how to operate it. She was supposed to give my mom a raise this summer, but didn't do it, because she said she couldn't afford it. Well, then why the fuck did you open your own clinic if you cant afford to keep your employees from walking.
She basically told my mom that the reason she was demoting her was that there were complaints. My mom asked her what kind and from whom and why she hadn't talked to her before deciding to take action. 
The bitch didn't really give her a very good answer apparently, so my mom walked and now she's devastated.
I hope with everything in me that this bitch's clinic goes down the toilet, because she doesn't deserve to be successful especially when she takes out her incompetence on my family, especially three weeks before Christmas. I seriously  think this bitch's first name is Satan, because she seems pretty evil to me."

I could have went out with a really nice guy last week, but I thought (and still think) that he wouldn't like me. So, to spare myself the embarassment of being turned down for being overweight, broke, without a car, and living at home. I used every excuse in the book to get out of it, and the sad thing is that I am relieved that I dont have to reveal the hideousness that is me to someone who will think I am loser anyway. My parents already think that, I don't need anyone else on the bandwagon, unless some of my friends already think that.
I really feel like crying. But I can't cause I am at school using their free internet, because that's what users like me do.

Both Saturday and Sunday, our busiest times were between 4 and 7. It was wierd. Then, Sunday, this stupid lady got mad because we didn't go to her table to serve her, not realizing that we had a sign posted up front saying, ""Order here/Pay Here"". She was like ""We have been waiting at the table for 5 minutes and nobody came to help us."" I was like, "" Well, ma'am, all the orders are taken up here and paid for up here."" Then she asked why we didn't have a sign, and pointed out to her that we did and she said that it needed to be bigger and in a place where people could see it. Yeah, having it in front of the registers is such a bad place for it, dumb bitch. Anyway, after being extremely rude, she went back to her table and sat down. There were like 4 or 5 other people in line after her, so I had to help them,. I originally thought that she just took off, so I just helped the next customers. As I was pulling the three or four pizzas coming out of the oven, I see her and her husband walking out of the restaurant. I am guessing she assumed that I was going to go after her to her table and do full service, which we don't do. What an idiot.
I found out that I am going to Rascal Flatts concert on the tenth next month, sweet ass!!! That's two concerts next month!!! And it was cheap, about $50 for the tickets, 100-level."

Last night, I finally got off the pot and did something that should have done a long time ago, but was afraid to. It feels good to have finally done it. (I can't really say what it is yet...) Basically, I went for something that I feel I deserve and want and hopefully it worked out. 
I am sort of getting into the Halloween spirit. I originally wasn't going to dress up. I didn't really have anything going on and I didn't feel like dressing up for the hell of it. But, I got invited to a party on the 29th that I am stoked for, though I barely know the people who are hosting it. They're friends of friends... 
Anyway, it's been a while since I have been absolutely fucked up, so I am going to absolutely, can't-touch-my-nose drunk. Instead of getting candy for Halloween, I am going get some shots... Oh, and I think, if I can pull it off, I'm going as Betty Boop.:)

Glide over the rocks and within
Overwhelming the masses
In unspeakable ways
Devastating the helpless
Til we know no days
Tears of rage, tears of sorrow
Wondering what will happen tomorrow

We cannot say when it will end
Desperately hoping they will mend
The old, the young, the disadvantaged
None of us knowing how they'll manage
Where will they go? To whom do they turn?
Will they ever be able to return?

The heartbroken helplessness we all feel
In helping those who cannot deal
Wishing we could understand
The chaos this storm revealed

Let there be sunlight not far away
For all of those evicted that day
Far from their jobs and their homes
And everything that they've all known
Praise God, they will not be left alone"

Well, I am school right now and I just found out that my morning class is canceled this week due to the instructor being ill. It's cool, though, I can get some reading done.
My parents are leaving on Thursday, and I am really nervous. They are going to Tennessee which gets all the leftover storms from the gazillion hurricanes the south gets this time of year.  I just hope that they will be okay."

Anyhoo, I showed my parents my labtop and they didn't flip out like I expected. They were actually pretty cool about it and they understood that I needed it for school and was cool with it. In fact, my step-dad might actually go buy one, he likes it that much. He wants one for the plane to Tennessee in a week and a half. Then, I am going to have the house to myself which makes me nervous because I really don't think I like being home alone at night. It just freaks me out.

Instead of doing homework most of the night, I ended up staying up until 1am downloading music from my CDs to my computer.( It's so wierd, I have a computer) Then, I did some this morning. I don't think I am going to put all my cds on my computer, it takes too much time. But it was fun to do. I feel more comfortable handling it, now that I know a little more on how to use it.

That's about it. I got to go and walk from campus to Salmon Creek park and ride because there's no shuttle this semester, or at least until September. ( Yesterday I wore brand new cowgirl boots and had to walk to school in them. By the end of the day I wanted to cut my feet off. I swear it felt like my feet were covered in blisters."

For those that know me very well, I'm not that much of a bitch am I? I know I have my moments when my opinions get the best of me and I say some pretty harsh things. Most of the time, I make these comments when something is really bothering me and just need to let go of it. I realize that what I say has had an affect on how people, most of which I don't know that well, see me. But what they have to understand is that the things I say or have said have been my opinions or perspectives on things. I may well be off the mark in some instances and that's fine.

"event","Well, today's Monday and my parents are out of town. I had planned on a party, that everyone seemed excited for. Anyways, my parents took down the pool for some stupid lame reason, so I figured, well, who would want to show up since there's no pool, so I cancelled it, but I didn't call anyone, because yesterday at work, I decided I could still have people over if they wanted. But, no one remembered, except Mike, who couldn't come, and Stephanie, who was sad that it wasn't happenin. 
I know I had my hesitations about throwing a get-together, or party, at the house, I was  actually really excited. I cleaned my room up, I went grocery shopping for snacks, made some brownies, almost made cookies. All for nada... 
I'm not really angry, just kind of sad, cause I was kind of looking forward to it. I will say this, I will never plan anything again, because it never works out the way I hope it does. So, that's the end of that.
Anyways, that's all I have today.

Anyway, school starts in three weeks, and I am so not prepared for it. It's all good though, they're all day classes, which is a relief.
My parents bought a pretty groovy pool over the weekend, I swam in it yesterday and froze my tits off. but it was worth it, I haven't been swimming in over a year. Last summer  I got my nipple pierced and couldn't go into pools or hot tubs for six months, by then it was December.

"event","Okay, so the big talk of the town was the white trash party the other night. And I really don't care what anyone says, but the chaos came from more than one particular person. Some people were mature enough to stay out of it and then there were others who kept the drama going, and I am not talking about Mike's friends either. Needless to say, I wish I could have been there longer to really have a good time. But I ended up getting there when everyone was getting testy and ridiculous. Except for Mike, he was crazy drunk and was all about the love. Out of the ""hosts"", Mike seemed to be the only one caring if anyone was having fun. 
Here's a little tip for those who got pissed at the party: Don't invite a large amount of people that you can't control to come over and drink and expect them all to be civilized. Especially, minors.Oh, and where were people supposed to go to the bathroom if no one was allowed in the damn house. Come on, now.
Oh, and just for the record, no one is giving Mike crap at work. If anything we have been supporting him. So fuck all of you that think otherwise. By the time all of Mike's ""work friends"" got to the party, the only people even remotely civil to us were the other guests, otherwise we were being forced outside or a certain someone's boyfriend got mouthy and was rude to us. Not to mention he took mine and my friends fucking beer, that we bought ourselves for ourselves, and hid it in the garage.
Of course the chaos is going to blamed on Katie and her group, because Star's and Elisha's friends didn't antagonize the situation at all. Whatever.
Oh, and how responsible was it to kick all 25-30 immensely drunk people , who were in no condition to drive, out so that there could have been a real possibility of them hurting themselves or someone else, because they had nowhere to sober up? Or threaten to call the cops when there were minors on the property?
I'm glad I went there though, because it made me realize that I never want to go there again. (Sorry Mike, I still love ya.)"

Had fun at Dee's birthday the other night. Got really drunk. Not surprising. Got a little frustrated though. I had hoped that more people would come, but people had things to do I guess. We had a good time regardless. Our friends Crissy and Michele came and Mike came as well. Dee was kind of bummed that some people didn't show, I think, but as the night wore on, she forgot about it.

Okay, so since I feel like my summer just started, I wanted to make a short list of what I wanted to accomplish before school starts again:
1. Get a boyfriend, or at least get laid. (It's very important: I am going crazy.)
2. Go to the beach as often as possible. (Once isn't going to cut it)
3. Make money. ( I need to)
4. Dont be rude to Emily, a girl that I have to work with that talks so much it makes my ears bleed. (She's only here for a couple of months,)
5. Stop making fun of retarded people. ( I just threw that in there)"

Anyhoo, we walked around, almost got henna tattoos(Now I wish I had, they were cool..) Then we went to this burrito place called ""Chipotle"" which was delicious. Oh, we did see one really sexy hot Navy guy, but I think he was a recruiter, but he gave us some tokens to ride the Navy simulator, which was actually fun, we kept sliding side to side because the plastic seats were slippery.

In the last four years or so, I have kind of seen a whole new process going on with friends, everyone is moving around, doing different things, growing up ( I will never do that, thank you very much), and busy as anything.
I miss the old days where everyone was still trying to figure out what they wanted in life, and we could go anywhere and do anything because we had the time and energy and didn't have anything tying us down. I miss the days of going to Canada to drink and have road trips, I miss  camping at the beach or on the lake, I miss going to downtown Portland just to walk around and be ourselves. I miss the days where there was no drama, everyone got along and could hang out and just have a grand ole time. We could all get shitty and not worry about the consequences, cause we all crashed where  we drank. I miss the ass-flashing and grabbing, the inappropriate conversations and jokes or games we used to play...Anyone remember the game ""I'm going to a party[or orgy], and I am going to take......""? Then we'd all go down the alphabet and by the time we got to ""z"", the person would have to recite everything.

"event","I am so tired of people misinterpreting the things I say. If I make a statement based on one of my opinions, it seems like someone will have to twist what I say around and make it sound offensive, or whatever. I have held my tongue on certain things for a long time and I wish I hadn't. I should have said them when I first thought them and not wait until later, when noone knows what I am talking about.
Like trying to give constructive criticism to someone who refuses to see it that way. 
What happened to being honest with people? Doesn't mean you don't like them at all, just means that you're comfortable with telling people how things are or how things have seemed.
What's pushed me into finally saying something, has been a number of things that have kind of annoyed me to a point to where I don't want to hold it back anymore.
For example:

How much longer is it going to take for some people to learn that it is rude and inconsiderate, not to mention frustrating, to make plans with people, then at the last minute, come up with a 101 excuses to not fulfill plans that you committed yourself to already, when in reality, you just dont want to go.
If you know that you don't want to do whatever comes up, save us all the time and energy and say ""No""
right then and there. We can move on and no one gets offended. We can be spared the last minute bullshit. If you have to think about whether or not you want to hang out with someone, then don't make plans.

Here lately I have been feeling that a lot of my problem has been not having a car. Although I have been grateful to everyone for giving me lifts, I am beginning to realize that it's becoming a burden on people. I have been feeling, as of late, that that has been a reason for certain people to not want to go and do anything, because they feel like they have to haul my ass around."

Cinco de mayo was fun, though I got drunk way too fast and there were sooo many people. I don't remember too much except I think I was making fun of Mike's friend,( I am really sorry, by the way, I was being a drunken biatch.) I also remember the chaotic fight of some morons who ended the party early. Dumbasses. I didn't see a whole lot, except a whole flurry of people in the hall way and some chick getting knocked into and almost spilling her ""consuela"". Then there's the spittle with drops of blood on the concrete by the front doors which was gross. Oh, and who can forget the nine cop cars that parked in front of the restaurant? I certainly can't, drunk or not.

"event","Okay, so I kind have been thinking a little bit lately about what I want to do in the future in regards to getting married and having a family and all that shit.. 
I'm still on the fence about getting married, I don't know if that will happen, but I can't honestly say that I wont get married because I haven't yet run into that person that I absolutely fell-on-my-ass-in-love-with. I'm sure I'd probably see things differently had I met that person yet.
One thing that is definite, and it may be my Achille's heel in relationships, I just don't want to have kids. I don't feel like I need that in my life to be happy. I feel like I am satisfied being an aunt and a godmother, but not a ""mommy"". It's just not something that I want. Im sure my family would love to hear that, but it's true. People can tell me until they're blue in the face that I will change my mind and give in to ""birthin' babies"" but I just dont want it. Like Pansy on ""Gone With The Wind,""  ""I don't know nothin' bout birthin no babies."" 
Maybe I am too much of a selfish person, I don't know, I just don't think that I would want to give up the freedom that I have, that I will have with my career, just so that I can invest all my time, or most of it, to raising kids. I certainly don't want a guy to do it for me either. Nothing against guys with maternal/paternal instincts, but I guess I am more attracted to guys that kind of think the way I do as far as wanting a career, wanting the ability to do what they want without being tied down."

"event","I hate that I love it when a hot guy talks to  me. Especially one that I kind a crush on a little... It's wierd, the last two weeks. I have more than one crush, of course. Well, a week or so ago, I was walking towards Salmon Creek and I was waiting at the light to cross the street. I wasn't really paying any attention to anything, until I saw this one car turning past me. The guy driving it had on these yellow sunglasses and he looked really familiar, and a split second later I realized it was the guy I was crushing on. Anyway, he apparently recognized me, because he waved as he drove past. Stupid me, being surprised, still had my hand in my coat pocket, attempted to wave back with my hand-filled pocket. Nice one, Heather. he probably didn't see it. I was surprised because I never say very much to him and he's in two of my classes.. I sound just like a freakin' school girl... 
Today, I happened to be in the computer lab, working on my history paper, and this other guy I crush on comes in and sits diagonally from me.(He's also in two of my classes, one of which is my history class) After a while, he started asking me about what I was typing and if it was for history and I said,"" yeah"" and we had a brief conversation about our papers for no reason. It gave me butterflies I tell ya..
They are both so hot...I hope I have class with them again.. 
I apologize for letting my horniness get the best of me, but those guys are so yummy.
Anyways, in a good mood because of it, so that's nice.

Word of the day: Humpalicioius!!!"

"event","We have two weeks left before finals. Oh my goodness. I decided that I am taking summer courses. I can't register for fall yet because I need to do my writing portfolio. Anyhoo, most of the hard stuff is out of the way, now I got to focus on tests.
I don't know what it is lately with computers and our highly ""reliable"" information system, but I have not been having any luck with them. First, the internet is down at home because we have Comcast and they suck every inch of  a donkey's dick. Second, the computer lab that I like to go to is always busy and I can never seem to download anything from blackboard because it doesn't stay on the screen long enough to do so. Third, I tried going to the library, but all the good computers were taken and the one that was left, wouldn't even attempt to go on the internet. So, now I am here in the Classroom building lab, which is out of the way, I must say (Ha, I just rhymed) It's frustratin' and I hate computers. 
Oh well, what can one do.

Maybe see a movie.... I want to see Sahara really bad. cause Mr. McConaughey is in it and looking good as usual."

I think  I will go out of town for my birthday. Get away from here. At least I will be doing something then."

"event","So we're gettin down to the nitty gritty and the end of the semester. Why has this semester felt so overwhelming? It seems like everything decided to pile up this semester. I do love my classes, though. I just found it really hard to catch up, though. I better buck up though, because next fall I am going to take about 15 credits, so I can graduate by next summer. I just got done with advising and now that I know what to do, I just got to get to doin' it. No distractions, just work.
Boy, oh Boy....
I am kind of sad to see this semester coming to a close, though. But, the break will be nice. I think I am going to spend the summer, in class, and researching graduate schools. Out of this area more than likely because not alot of schools up here offer graduate degrees in Archaeology in this area. 
Don't worry, I'll send postcards from Australia, when I have my master's degree in my hands..:)

From now on, to be my wierd, silly self, I am going to leave ""words of the day on my journal."" and for no particular reason, other than to be different.
So, today's word will be......... Superfluous. I like saying it, though I cant remember what it means."

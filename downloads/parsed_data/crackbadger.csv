"event","Alright, what a week!

I house/dogsat this week for a couple that lives in town.  They had a nice trip to a warmer climate, but luckily it got pretty warm here for a couple of days, too.  I just made sure I stopped in as often as I could and played with and fed the pups.  I had to sleep there, too, but it was all kosher.  The only bad part was the other night when it rained really hard and one of the pups got scared and couldn't settle down.  Doesn't make me any less determined to have a pup of my own one day.

School is still going pretty well, too.  I've slowly started to get more and more strict with myself about getting to school earlier and staying focused until later in night.  I do feel like I've gotten more done the past week or so, and now that I've finished taking care of the pups I should get even more done this week.

Over the last few weeks I've discovered some great new tunes.  Wayne Shorter compositions kick ass.  Extreme ass.  I've yet to hear one that isn't catchy.  They're not super, duper complicated either, so playing on them is pretty fun (and educational, too).  Speaking of music, a message board I check out once in a while has seen a couple promo posts for board regulars that are putting out albums.  Now, maybe I'm an over-critical asshole, but I've listened to the (very length generous) sample cuts from both of these artists, and they're OK, but not spectacular.  But most of the folks on the board are like ""Yeah, kickin'"" and ""I love the swing"" and ""Nice articulation"".  Now, there are some catchy tunes, and some really good ideas are played, but I really didn't think the cuts swung very hard at all, and that's a big deal with the articulation, too.  One of my roommates has agreed with me here, but still, maybe we're both just assholes.

Anyway, time to get a couple other things together before Adult Swim.  Smell ya later, chumps.  (Happy Halloween!)

"event","Ah, Sunday has come to a close, and in the earliest hours of Monday I drop a quick note on the ole jizzle.  Last week went alright, and the weekend was pretty regular.  Made some decent $ Friday night at the bar, and then got absolutely stiffed by about 40 people Saturday.  Man do I love hippies now....  At least we get a pretty good wage.  Otherwise I'd have killed someone.

It seems like we're getting pretty close to doing actual sessions in recording class.  I'm damn excited; I already enjoy learning about technology, and I like music, so recording really seems like it's going to be a blast.  I just hope that if I do like the course that there will be some avenue for practice after this course.  I guess if I had to drop a wad of cash into some kind of equipment or computer I'd be willing to do it.  If I enjoy it all, that is.  Which I should.

This week I'm going to try some new things with my schedule.  Pretty much I just want to try to get up a little bit earlier and make sure I stay on task and working/practicing so that I can squeeze more out of the week.  Also try to do maybe a little playing after work on Saturday and more on Sunday.  Or something like that.  Just more playing in general.  Just crossing my fingers that it'll work and maybe even pay off one of these days.

Band concert Tuesday night.  As usual I forgot to say anything to the family until today.  And I think that was just to my brother and sister, so my folks don't know yet.  I'll tell them not to worry about making it up; things aren't shaping up real well anyway.  This will probably make the second performance at this university that I am in no way proud of.  I know it's a bad idea to into things with a negative attitude, but sometimes it can't be helped.  Maybe if we'd been having good rehearsals all along.  Maybe if rehearsals were consistent.  And maybe a family of unicorns lives under my bed.  It's a fresh group, and there's only so much to be done with a group so young.

Do you ever feel like you've worked all day and gotten nothing done?  That's how I feel about this day for the most part.  I'm sure that if I just think a little bit I can find some good things that I did or some improvements I made.  I guess I did do some good transcribing and got more familiar with some tunes.  A lot of the time it feels like no matter how hard I try it's not going to happen for me.  *sigh*  I know that's most likely untrue, but it's a shitty feeling to have and a hard one to shake.  Just have to keep digging in and hoping for the best?  Just have to work as hard as I can!

I've started to put in as much time as I think I should put in on practicing and things this week.  I've been slacking, dammit, and that just can't happen.  I've been sleeping too late in the morning and staying up too late at night.  I have been enjoying Star Wars: Battlefront, though.

You know what else I hate?  I hate driving around in this one horse town.  Even Freeburg (Pop. 4000) has had talks and looked at ideas for expanding its (one) main road into a 4 lane with a middle turn lane.  E-ville is just now getting to it...years later than it should have.  But I guess now that Esic Drive is open again it'll be a little bit easier getting around.  At least now Pizza Hut will deliver to us, eh?  Let's not talk about that, shall we?

I got my hands on a copy of Star Wars: Battlefront for PC.  It delivers absolutely everything that it was promised to deliver, and it's a really, really, really fun game.  I would recommend getting it, because you can pop through a couple battles in about 10 or 15 minutes.  It's a completely different experience form something like UT or CS.  And it's Star Wars.

I get a new mattress set in a few days.  I'd have to say that I'm pretty excited because I've never gotten a new bed before, and the old one kind of sucks at this point.  It's lumpy <i>and</i> uncomfortable, but it's not quite as old as I am.  Someone's gonna be sleeping soundly after the end of the week....

Tonight we had the Jazz Supper Dance-the annual fall fundraiser for our music department scholarships.  It went pretty well; CJB played, and there were some small groups and vocalists, too.  There were also some trainwrecks, but they worked themselves out.  I guess maybe it was kind fifty-fifty as far as energy and feel, too, but that's a bit better than some days have been lately.  My folks attended, and they were really impressed, so I guess we all did our jobs right.

Anyhow, it's time to take off.  Someone is snoring very loudly right now.  Ear plugs deploy!  Enjoy two quotes.

"event","Alright, so it's been a while.  A long while.  A <i>very</i> long while.  But here I am!  I've been going to school for pete's sake!  My classes are pretty sweet.  I have an analysis class, which I happen to like, but you probably need to be a pretty unique individual to enjoy a class like that.  It's pretty intellectual, and it requires a lot of time for homework.  Not that I've put in all that time....  I'm also in a jazz arranging class, and that's a load of fun, too, and then I have a recording techniques class, which kicks ass.  That class only meets once a week, but it's fun as hell, and I feel like I'm learning a lot of stuff.  Other than that I try to play as much as I can (of course in ensembles and stuff), but I also try to practice a lot and get to jam sessions that happen.

Actually, I've been kind of bummed about playing lately, so I haven't put in as much time or had as much enjoyment from playing with other people.  I guess maybe it's a plateau before a next big incline, but whatever it is I'm trying to get it together to get through it.  It's such a bummer sometimes, though.

Mel (my lady) doesn't like her job that much.  She got a gig teaching full time at a school in Belleville.  She's doing 4-8 grade band and 5th grade general music, and the kids are crazy.  There are a lot of very well-mannered, well-behaved children in her classes, but there are just as many trouble makers and stuff.  It stresses me out just to hear about the stuff they do.  She's had a kid just get up and leave class, she's had kid's ask when the teacher before he is coming back....  Just a bunch of jerks.

I talked to a friend of mine who is in the Army and stationed in Germany.  He said he's going to be deployed for a year in Afghanistan next year.  YAY Bush!  YAY War on terror!  (sarcasmn)  I'm voting democratic.  Just keep those folks in mind; way too many have already paid the ultimate price for our current administrations blunderings.

About 2 and a half weeks ago one of my high school teachers died.  He's been retired for a year, I think, and he just up and had a heart attack at his house.  That was a sad day for this world; Dale Reavis was a great man, and I can't say enough about how much I enjoyed and learned from him.  There's a quote that I can't remember exactly, so I'll paraphrase it:  ""Live in such a way that even the fates weep at your passing"".  That's at least the gist of it, and may not even be close to the exact quote, but that's Dale.

Alright, enough with the downers.  I'm going to take off, but before I do, I'll recommend three albums.

Joshua Redman-Elastic
Sonny Rollins-Plus 4
Cannonball Adderley-In San Francisco

Later, folks.

All I ate yesterday was a bunch of leftover food.  Red Lobster, chinese...I did have a microwave burrito, though.

I don't know if I mentioned it, but Border's just had this radical cd sale.  Select albums for different genres were $8.99.  $8.99!!!  I got three, and boy was I satisfied.  At that price, Art, Newk, and Dex never sounded so freakin' good.  I also got some new clothes over the weekend.  Yes, my mother bought them for me, but isn't that much better than me just running around like a ragamuffin?  Or even just plain naked?  What did kind of suck was when my mom told me that she'd write me out of the will if I voted Democratic in November.  She was kidding, of course, but I got more of a glimpse of how uber-conservative she can be.  We didn't get into a conversation after that; I didn't feel like it, and she's got way too strong of a personality for that talk to be any fun.  But gay marriage <i>is</i> more of an issue than foreign policy in the minds of some people.  Of course, those marriages would probably be in a courthouse and not forced upon unwilling centers of religion.  Oh, and when was the last time you read about people being killed at a gay wedding ceremony?

But I don't even really need to go into all that.  There aren't a lot of good reasons for a musician to vote Republican, anyway.  Right Matt D?

Not only is the work wonderfully rewarding, but I also get a free meal, shot, <i>and</i> drink when I work.  It's part of a dream come true, to be sure.

In other news, I finished the stock campaign for Neverwinter Nights on PC.  Sixty hours of gameplay!  <i><b>SIXTY HOURS!!!</i></b>  I started it in May, and I'm just finished with it.  What a great game, too; the story, graphics, and gameplay are most definitely superb and far superior to comparable games.  Speaking of PC games, Half-Life 2 is going to be <b><i>FUCKING AWESOME!!!</i></b>  No matter who you are, go check out a preview trailer and convince me that it's not the most amazing game footage that you've seen.  Then check out Star Wars: Battlefront and tell me that's not going to kick ass, too.  Man, what a time to be alive!!!!!

I've also <i>finally</i> started getting my ass in gear on playing some saxophone.  I got a good hour in before I taught tonight, and I even had the chance to rip some changes.  Hopefully I can keep up the work and it'll show when I get back to school in August.

I also got Andy a nice birthday gift today.  I'll let you know what it is next week.

In other news, I'm not going to be a security guard at a Shop N Save in the shitty part of Collinsville.  Instead I'll be a cook at Stagger Inn, a swank restaurant in the classy part of town.  This is the job that I wanted.  I have to work Friday and Saturday nights, but I get the rest of the week off and make good wage plus tips.  Plus a meal.  Plus a drink.  Plus a shot.

Gypsy starts again tonight, too.  We had last night off (presumably because the orchestra is so bitch) so just 4 more performances and we're finished with this madness!  Sounds pretty sexy!  Here's a real stuffed cat!  I doubled your Crackerjack order, Ed!!!

The other day Melissa decided that she didn't want to move out of the area for a teaching job (especially not to the middle of nowhere).  That's pretty good news; I wasn't exactly thrilled about the prospect of driving 4 hours north (the middle of nowhere) to see her just once a month.

I feel like I've gotten pretty decent at playing clarinet, though.  I've actually started to enjoy the instrument a little bit.  On Friday I did have a job interview with Shop N Save for a security position.  I got the job, but I've been having second thoughts about it lately.  It's a lot of short shifts at really inconvenient evening times, it's for the prevention of armed robbery in a depressed area, and I'd have to shave my face.  The face-shaving was the deal breaker.  It might also be the only thing really making me apprehensive, and I'm not sure if that makes me shallow, stupid, vain, or anything else.

But enough about me, Nathan Gloeckler came down from Chicago this weekend.  He was playing at a wedding for one of the grad students at school.  Nathan used to go to <a href=http://""www.siue.edu"">SIUE<a/> with us, but a couple different personal reasons made him decide to move back to the Chicago area and go to school there.  We miss him, and he misses us, but it was really apparent this weekend.  God, that guy is hilarious.  I remember him telling one of my roommates-a very religious man-that he should name his penis ""Jesus"".  Good old Nathan.  We hung out with him for a little bit at Hucke's apartment and then took off.  He has an inguinal hernia; he showed me, and it doesn't look like fun.  We should kidnap him and make him live here, locked in a box.  Just like the gimp in Pulp Fiction.  But then he'd probably get his hands on my sword (or <a href=""lj:/user/fyamand/"">Joe's</a>) and kill us before we even got to the sodo...  Maybe I'll just quit while I'm ahead.

Rehearsal for Gypsy tonight was almost a whopping 5 hours long.  I thought we were done after we finished the last scene.  Apparently so did the cast (I'm playing in the pit), because when the director decided we had time to run a couple scenes again everyone had to rounded back up from the depths of the beyond.  That took enough time that all the actors involved forgot their lines, so we spent another five or ten minutes with folks dicking around after dropping a line.  Ah, <i>theatre</i>!

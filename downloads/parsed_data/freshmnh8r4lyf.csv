"event","After a long discussion with Bridget, I realized I hate the media.

The media dictates what's cool. IE, if you don't have X brand of clothing or x whatever you're not considered ""cool"" and you're shunned. 

It dictates who can date who in a relationship.

It dictates what music is ""good""

It controls our lives without us knowing it.

I hate the media."

Geometry: B

Spanish: B+

English, Physical Science, Band, Gym: A

Yay. 

Surprised Mom didn't flip, seeing how she's a spanish teacher and all... 

G.A.Y. assembly today. Think I wanna sit there and watch people spend money they don't have?

These 2 girls behind us kept bidding... Like they had x amount of money. 

I also feel bad for the people who donated the season Monarchs tix.

They only sold or about $100 for both of them, when they're like $600 each.

Same with Redsox tix...

"event","Man, I hate school. So much.

I hate when people smell.

Meh, anyway today Po came over after school to help me with the scales... much better now :D

Now onto business. It pisses me off when people want you to do stuff that you can and they can't for certain reasons. They could

do it without getting caught. 

So unsure of myself lately... 

Bridget rocks :D

"event","the future freaks me out. that's about all i've got to say. <br />that's about all i've&nbsp;been thinking about.<br /><br />i'm supposed to be thinking about the future right now, i guess. i mean, i'm a senior in high school. huge, monumental changes are coming. difficult decisions&nbsp;i don't want to make that i have to. right now. <br />i feel like i'm going to lose everything. i feel like i have to prepare myself to have nothing for the rest of my life. <br />i'm the type of person who expects the worst, more or less, on a regular basis. that way, you can either be right or you can be pleasantly suprised. and i'm expecting to go to a college where i have no friends. where i make no friends. where i find out i can't do what i want to do. where i find out i'm just not good enough. where i find out that i don't really want what i thought i wanted. when i find out that i really have nothing in the world. <br />i don't want to be alone.<br />i guess, it would all be alright, probably,&nbsp;if i knew i could keep my best friends. i honestly could get through anything if i could keep them. <br />but reality is harsh. and one friend is even harsher. i honestly don't even know what the one friend is really thinking about it all. the two are total opposites when it comes to the after high school thing. good/bad toss up. <br />but it's awful. it's all i can think about. i really just want to focus on having a fun senior year. but it's like college is always <em>right there</em>. i can't go a day without thinking about it or having to decide something for my future. i want to focus present. not spend all of this on what will be. <br />i'm really hoping that things will slow down with the future/decisionmaking stuff and all the obsessing in my head as time goes by. but not after too much time goes by. i don't want to look up one day and realize i missed my senior year getting ready for something part of me is dreading.<br /><br />whothefuckknows, really."

"event","Family sucks. Things with my family are not good. As I'm typing these first lines I'm vowing to myself to keep this short because I don't really want to get into it,&nbsp;I just want to say a few things.&nbsp;

My mother is a blind idiot who doesn't know how to handle anything. She's desperate for ""a relationship"" with me when all I really want is for her to leave me alone. Because she pushes things. To ridiculous breaking points and she doesn't realize and is probably incapable of realizing how to grow up.&nbsp;

My dad hates me. He's silent about it but he gives me looks and carries a ""fuck you"" attitude on&nbsp;his shoulders whenever he's around me. I'm pretty sure he blames me for everything. I'm a ""little bitch"", which he's told me to my face on more than one occassion but for the most part he just ignores me. Which is better, I'm pretty sure, than following me around the house like my mother does.&nbsp;

My mother seriously does not leave me alone when I'm home. She will follow me and try to start ""conversations"" with me. She wants to know what ""she ever did wrong"" but honestly, I can't even tell you how often&nbsp;I have tried to have this conversation with her. It always gets absolutely nowhere because she's too damn blind for it to matter. She doesn't really listen to a word I say. EVER.

So I'm done, basically. Done trying.&nbsp;

Eh, it was short enough."

"event","<p>I've been having trouble lately coming up with the right words to use. Mostly in English papers. Like I know what it is that I want to say, and a lot of the time the word is right there... but I can't think of it. And I love words like the ones I can't think of... that describe complex or specific things that you could explain in a paragraph in just one word.&nbsp;<br />I am not particularly fond of school recently. I don't really like it and the homework load is intense. I took the ACT this past weekend, so that's over with now but the homework is still a lot. And I imagine that it's only going to get worse next year because I'll be taking... four? AP classes. AP Calc, AP Gov, AP Chem, AP Lit... plus imedia which is a sweet class that requires no work outside of the class but it takes up two periods. Well, I guess half of the time I use one of them for a study hall anyway, so that will help. Taking Spanish four this year was kind of a mistake. I could have tried to take contemp law, which I want to take next year.&nbsp;Because of the whole maybe wanting to be a forensic scientist thing. Which is scary because not only is this a sort of ambitious goal with the whole probably need a graduate degree or whatever, but I am also afraid to officially say this is what I want to do for sure. Because, well you never know. I could change my mind and then I'm back at square one. Well, more like square two because I actually have another idea as to a career. But in a way I'll feel like I failed if I change my mind. But then I hear that people change their majors even halfway through college all the time, which also freaks me out. Like I have to decide what I want to do with the rest of life NOW or I screw myself over. There have been so many times in my life where I've looked back and thought, wow, I was so ignorant and young back then. Imagine how I'll feel 5 years from now. Wow, what were you thinking? Now your entire life is screwed over because of it. And it's not even like it'd be my fault. I mean, I have make a decision before that point. When I probably am going to be slightly if not completely ignorant about how I'll be in the future. And maybe ignorant isn't the right word but I'm not going to even bother trying to come up with a better one because of what I just said at the beginning of all this.<br />Oh future, how you stress me out.</p>"

I am having an... internal conflict about ha. This year I think is the first year where I've really decided that Catholcism is not me. I don't want to be Catholic and I don't have Catholic beliefs. So, do I follow all of the Catholic ""rules"" for Lent? No meat on Fridays, ""fasting"" inbetween meals on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday? It probably wouldn't be too hard to just end up not eating meat on Fridays... my parents will make something fish for dinner. But I don't think I'm okay with just ""ending up"" not doing it.

I found this college, University of New Haven, that actually the closest I've gotten to what I want and I told her about it when she got home and she basically flipped a bitch on me about how I'm ""never coming back."" Which I totally don't understand because HELLO BITCH I'm sharing shit about what I want in my life with you. What the fuck is it now?

And holidays mean you have to give presents. Presents cost money. I don't care what people say, realistically, presents cost money. Money I don't have.

This colonial writers english test is stressing me out. I'm so sick of all of it. I haven't studied much compared to others and yet I want to curl in a ball everytime I look at the stack of papers. We were supposed to have the test Monday, but that was an ice day, so no school. Today we did some career/college thing the counsellors scheduled. So it's been put off two days and I just want it to be over.&nbsp;

I got a 76 on our last math test. Nobody did well on it all except one kid who is a genius anyways. It's frustrating because when the teacher ""teaches"" she talks to him only. It's like they're having a one-on-one session. He gets all the answers faster than anyone else, so she just goes with what he says, paying on attention to the fact that nobody else in the class understands what's going on. I'm not blaming my grade on the teacher, but she hasn't exactly been helping.&nbsp;

Synergy is difficult. I'm exhausted. It's after 10 now. So I'm going to go to bed soon, hopefully. I&nbsp;have studied some for english, but I am not going to obsess about it. I learned a while ago that hardcore stressing and freaking and&nbsp;cramming&nbsp;isn't going to help me any.&nbsp; But after two extra unexpected nights to study it has sort of gotten to the point where I no excuses. I had better get a good grade on this. I don't enjoy what we're doing currently, so that makes it even harder to focus. I am loving chem though. And when I have chem homework I do that first and longer and with more concentration than the rest. And it is showing in my grades. Ugh."

"event","<p><font face=""Times New Roman"" size=""3"">The Tigers traded Omar Infante to the Cubs today =(<br /><br />I absolutely loved Omar, from day one. He was my first favorite player and I have always rooted for him. Hell,&nbsp;I remember him from the Mud Hens, that's how far he and I go back.&nbsp;<br />In short, I am really upset about losing Omar. He's been a Tiger since 2002 and has been&nbsp;in the organization his entire career, I think.&nbsp;<br />But, putting this in perspective, I guess this move will probably end up being the best thing for him. He wasn't getting the playing time he deserved here in Detroit, partially because it seemed as though Leyland didn't like him, which is thus far Jim's only visible&nbsp;flaw.&nbsp;That and the whole chain-smoking thing.&nbsp;In retrospect, somewhere in the back of my mind, I kind of had an idea Omar wouldn't be around much longer. I think we&nbsp;all did.&nbsp;Especially after that trip to the minors last season. But I have always believed that he could be an everyday middle infielder and I really really hope he gets the chance now in Chicago. I wish him the best of luck in the NL, and I will continue to&nbsp;follow him and continue to root for him. I won't forget you, Omar, I love you.<br />Basically, I am now also a&nbsp;Cubs fan, ha.<br /><br />Also, I am not sure I like the direction the Tigers are now going. The guy they got in return for Omar is probably meant to be a platoon with Marcus in left, which I don't like. Personally&nbsp;I believe that&nbsp;Marcus completely has the ability to be an everyday leftfielder, if he would just be given the chance. Also I am still irked about the decision to not resign Sean Casey. He's a .300 lefty. You couldn't ask for anyone better in the clubhouse.&nbsp;I like Carlos at short, that's his home, it's where his heart is. He's a team player though. I don't know about the Renteria thing. I just don't know what to think about that. I don't know much about him except he did not do well in his only stint in the AL, which is slightly concerning.&nbsp;I guess we'll see. But for now, I'm not very happy. Especially with the whole another Zumaya&nbsp;freak accident injury. I am pretty okay with Todd Jones coming back, especially after the Zoom thing. Now we must resign Kenny.<br /><br />Good luck, Omar.<br />Go Cubs.</font></p>"

I don't want to spend time thinking and bringing to the surface what I want to talk about. Even if it's just thinking about it to myself. Healthy, I know, but for now I guess I'll just stick to the burying them inside me thing.<br /><br />With each passing day I get more and more sick of my family and my house. I'm sick of having that ""minor"" label, like because I'm not 18 I can't make decisions for myself. I feel suffocated by my parents and my mom's constant need to know where I am and what I'm doing every moment. I understand that she's my mom, and is therefore worried and has a right to know, etc. But still. I'm almost 17. I'm trying to prepare myself for my own life. I think they are kind of unaware of the fact that one day I am going to be on my own and they won't be able to keep me here, under their attempt at a shield from the world.&nbsp;<br /><br />I've been thinking a lot lately about ""family"" and what it means. This is one of those things that I want to talk about that I mentioned earlier, but I can't quite bring myself to record it, write it down. I have, however, fully thought most of it through, which I guess is a step. You know how sometimes you don't finish your own thoughts because you know what you're thinking? You know what you're thinking and you know what you're feeling, so you don't need to finish the thought or to put it all into words. You just kind of... let the feeling float there in&nbsp;your head without pulling it up. You can see it, you know it's there, but you don't pull it out of the water for fear you have to face it.&nbsp;<br /><br />Wow analogy.

Potentially, these thoughts are life changing, at the very least kind of uplifting. 

One of my best friends mom died of cancer this past weekend 
I went to her memorial service today and it was a really nice celebration of her life, as they called it.&nbsp;
This woman was described as living life to the fullest, the kind of person who really touched people and who really got all she could out of life. From what I know about her and from when I've talked to her, this is all so&nbsp;true.&nbsp; 
She seemed to be really an amazing, strong person with strong faith.&nbsp; 
This is the kind of person I want to be. I want to live my life as fully as possible and with faith like that.&nbsp; 
Really, I was truly affected. 
I swear, however wackily spiritual this may sound, I looked outside at one point and the wind was blowing the leaves on the trees and I swear I saw her in them.&nbsp;"

"event","Well hello, Livejournal. Been a couple weeks, eh?&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />I have been fairly busy since coming back from vacation... I went back to work the day after we got back. It's actually pretty enjoyable now and I kind of feel like I'm actually beginning to make a difference... I think there's been an increase in website orders. Which is cool.<br />Vacation was pretty good, considering. I mean, a hell of a lot of family and my brother was always annoying. Either because he was bored or he was being an ass or because he was all ""look at this"" and ""watch this,"" but eh.&nbsp;<br />I have to say that I liked driving through/past the cities (Chicago, Denver, St. Louis) more than the actual ""destination"" of the Rocky Mountains. Don't get me wrong, the mountains were amazing. (Pictures on Flickr soon, hopefully, but this is my first real day all alone since coming home.) But dude the cities were <em>amazing</em>... looking, anyway. We didn't stop, just drove through. Except we stopped in St. Louis to see the Arch. There were SO MANY people wearing Cardinals gear around there... I've never seen so many people all wearing team gear except in and around a stadium. Which, I guess you can see the Busch Stadium from the Arch, but still. It was cool to see, minus them being, you know, <font size=""1"">World Champions</font> and whatnot.&nbsp;<br />I tried to get as many good pictures out the tinted, smeared window of our minivan as a could driving past the cities. I am in love with metros and bus stops, seriously. I want to go to college in Chicago. I want to experience city life. I'd ride the metros. I could totally see myself reading and stuff on them/while waiting for them. Don't ask, that's another story for another time. As it is I'm trying to make up for the past two weeks in one entry.&nbsp;<br />But anyway, as cool as the Rockies were, the cities were cooler, even though we didn't even get into them, just through them on the highway. Oh, highway.&nbsp;<br />Next summer I am going to the Bronx. I am going to see Yankee Stadium before it&nbsp;closes. I have to.<br /><br />So, I am alone today. My brother started his first day of Jr. High today, ha. I start school tomorrow and I have to say that I am looking forward to it more so than I thought I would be come the day before school. I talked to my counselor and I managed to get back into Interactive Media, which I'm really happy about. So I dropped economics/contemporary law and&nbsp;AP Psych, which I can then take next year for the 1/2 credit of social studies needed to graduate. So the addition of IM helps. I got a parking spot, too, so that is good there. Except I don't have a car yet, so I'm borrowing my mom's and she's borrowing my grandparents'.&nbsp;<br />Seriously I don't know what I'd do without them. They've helped us all out so many times. They're even going to help pay for whatever third car we eventually get. They are completely awesome people. And they won't take money from us, ever. So I am going to hopefully go over and help them (mostly my grandma) with her computer/cell phone/new digital camera sometimes, trying (though I don't know if I'll ever be able to) pay them back, in a sense.&nbsp;<br /><br />Alright, I need to go do my Chem summer homework. I finished the third and final book we had to read last night. I could totally ramble on about more, like how much I like reading books like that, but I do not like&nbsp;Chemistry. Hence why I have not done it yet.&nbsp;<br /><br />Oh, and The Format is freakin' amazing. Totally and completely. Especially their ""Interventions and Lullabies"" CD. Sooooo amazing.

"event","<p>I'm gonna go back to a subject I talked about a while ago here. That stupid 'praying' that my family does before we eat. It pisses me off. It pisses me off not because we do it, but how we do it. My brother slurs through the whole thing so fast you can hardly tell what he's saying. And then he ends it with a ""Let us chow!"" that is pretty much the only thing somebody who didn't know the prayer would actually understand. And they obsess about holding hands during the thing. So much so that they actually miss most of if not all of the actual prayer trying to hold my hand or at least touch me in some way. It's so ridiculous.&nbsp; <br /><br />More later, hopefully. I have to go to my brother's game and this fucking computer wasn't working for the last ten minutes. Damnit.<br /><br /><strong>edit:</strong> I previously edited/updated, but stupid livejournal had an error and didn't save it. So I am going to try to rethink most of it.&nbsp;<br /><br />My brother's game was cancelled today because it rained earlier in the day. We went all the way out there to find out it was cancelled. I was actually kind of disappointed because I had finally brought my camera. I want to take pictures of the fields because&nbsp;they really&nbsp;are amazing. Especially at night. And especially when they're empty.&nbsp;(Seriously, that is where I want to lose it someday. In the outfield grass. No joke. Hahaha. I'm a nerd, I know.) But his game is rescheduled for tomorrow, which is kind of inconvenient because I was planning on going over to a friend's house. Which I think I am still going to do. Even though this is potentially their last game, if they lose. Oh decisions, decisions.<br /><br />Anyway, back to my original topic. The prayer is a fucking joke. It really is. There is no meaning behind when they do it that way. I'm not an extremely religious person, but I have my things. I mean, I'm nothing like how my mom wants me to be in that area. She has made that quite clear to me. Especially with all of her recent ""I should have sent you to a Catholic school"" woe-ing. Because I cuss too much. Which I probably do around her.<br /><br />But I am more religious than she realizes. I just don't like her kind of religion. So, yeah, in that sense, she failed her duty as a Catholic mother. She did not raise a devoted Catholic daughter. Her son, however, is seemingly coming along just fine. Oh yes, he carries the hypocritical trait of Catholics so very well. When I say ""goddamn"" and say I don't want to go to church he gets all ""you're defying God"" in front of her. But seriously. He's so two-faced and selfish I don't see how he could be considered a good Christian in any eyes but a Catholic's. At least&nbsp;most Catholics I know. AND he thought the pope was Jewish. Not even kidding.<br /><br />But I honestly think that you don't have to be all ""I live my life&nbsp;solely&nbsp;for God&nbsp;and everything I do is for him"" to be a good Christian.<br /><br />My mom really only goes to church when it's convenient. Like when we don't have any games and when she doesn't work the weekend. I honestly think that if you're going to play the devoted card, you need to make an effort to go to church every weekend, regardless of what is going on. I mean, it's one hour for something you believe in. Now, I don't personally like church. (At least not the ones I've been to. There is probably one out there that I would like, but being only 16 I haven't exactly been given an opportunity to look for/find it.) But it would be so much easier and acceptable in my mind to respect my mom's desire for me to go to church with her if she wasn't so hypocritical about everything surrounding religion.<br /><br />I am mostly content with my... uh... spirituality? I guess I'm not really comfortable calling it a religion because I don't want to feel like I have to conform to any one set of beliefs. But I believe in God. And I'm not a bad person for the most part. I think that is the most important part. Maybe my thing isn't to have a religion, but my own ""beliefs"" that happen to include things about God and parts of religion. Like I don't believe in drugs. I don't believe that homosexuals are wrong. I'm not really sure on the premarital sex thing yet. (That is a biggie for my mom. She continuously says ""And I&nbsp;KNOW you&nbsp;know that that is WRONG"" whenever un-married people on TV are having sex. Well, truthfully, I don't think it's WRONG. They can do whatever they want, reasonably speaking. I don't even think it's wrong for me personally. I think it's more of a matter of being ""ready"" or not. I'm pretty sure there isn't going to be a clear cut yes or no.<br /><br />Wow. I have rambled and gotten off track a TON. I will end it now, and leave you with this:</p><p><strong>Urban Dictionary's word of the day<br /><em>Sapiosexual</em></strong><em>: One who finds intelligence the most sexually attractive feature.</em></p>"

"event","My god work is exhausting. I worked from about 8 til about 4 four days this week. I'm so tired. It's not even that fun. I thought working on a website would be fun, but I was being ingnorant. Yeah, ok, it's fun and really easy at times and I love internet and tech stuff. But it's frustrating a LOT. I mean, they hired me to work on their website but they don't give me a computer to work on. So I spend a fourth of my time looking for a place to work. There are also not very many resources. It just gets frustrating sometimes. But it pays more than minimum and it's way more flexible than just about any other job would, which is something I need. Oh contradictions, how you mess with me.
But I can only work 20 hours next week, so it'll be better I think.

Anyway, onwards. 

The other day I was online looking at Curtis Granderson's (Tigers centerfielder) ESPN blog and my brother was sitting on the chair in the computer room behind me (like he is right now). He looked up and flipped out on me because he saw the word ""blog"" on the screen. I was like dude, chill. It's not mine it's CURTIS GRANDERSON'S. For god's sake. But he wouldn't let it go. He was like, ""well, still. You shouldn't be looking at a blog."" Okay, mom. Seriously. 1) He needs to leave me alone and mind his own business; 2) Even my parents let me look at players' etc. blogs. Not that them not letting me would stop me. But still.

I love cookies and cream ice cream, it's amazing.

I haven't done much online music listening/exploring lately, due to my imense workage. I miss it.&nbsp;But that's what I'm doing right now, it's awesome.

Alright, I'm going to go now."

The recruiting camp today went pretty well, I guess. I didn't do amazing or anything, but I guess I didn't completely suck. So we'll see. There are so many rules and things to know for the recruiting process. It's ridiculously complicated. Oh well, we'll get through it I guess.

Tomorrow we have four games(!!!). Holy crap that is a lot. I'm excited though to try to make that whole not thinking thing work. Hopefully permanently. Really, mindframes are so important. In basically everything you do.

I'm working on getting those pictures up... I didn't go to my brother's game tonight, so I was actually able to stay home alone. Uploading is slow going, though, because I can't download any of the tools that are supposed to make it go faster because I really really doubt my parents would let me have a flickr account if they knew about. Seriously, I'm not even allowed to have instant messaging. No joke.&nbsp;

Call it cheesy, call it obsessive, call it whatever you want, but seriously.&nbsp;<br />I took a lot of pictures, as you can imagine, but I don't think any of them really came out with the clarity and breathtaking-factor that there is in real life. My little digital camera isn't the greatest of quality for that kind of thing, so it made it that much&nbsp;harder to capture what it felt like.<br />I will eventually post them up on my <a href=""http://flickr.com/photos/8514640@N08/"">flickr account</a>, which I got up and running (sort of) last month. For some reason, I can't get my pictures into sets on my computer. It just never loads. I left it up for hours once and nothing happened. Oh well, nobody looks at it, so it doesn't really matter right now I guess. But I will get these pictures up soon, hopefully. Next time I'm home alone. Which, in reality, probably won't be anytime soon because of my stupid job.<br /><br />But about the game: I know I said that I love pitching duels, and I do. I love them.&nbsp;But when playing your rivals (the Indians), it is a great thing to see&nbsp;them get&nbsp;ripped. Oh yes,&nbsp;today the Tigers pummeled the Indians. And won the series. Big win. Huge win. Great fun.&nbsp;<br /><br />I'm going to a college recruiting camp thing tomorrow. I'm kind of nervous because there are supposed to be a ton of college scouts there to watch and whatnot. I'm not even really sure if I want to play softball in college right now, but this is a big step, I think. I guess I've got nothing to lose, though, right? Nothing to lose.<br /><br />(Pretty much unrelated to tomorrow's camp): I need to have a clear head. That's what I need to succeed at softball. I've figured it out. A clear, calm head.

"event","Congrats to Polanco, Ordonez, and Pudge for earning an All Star start and Carlos and Verlander for reserves... that's awesome to see the love for Tigers. One final vote remains... Jeremy Bonderman is up for the final vote, so we're definitely voting for him as many times as possible.&nbsp;

I consider myself a baseball purist. Old school, if you will.&nbsp;I would so much rather see a pitching duel than a slugfest. I think triples are way more exciting (okay, only in most cases) than homeruns. I love speed and basestealers.&nbsp;
This is why last night's Tigers/Twins game thoroughly excited me. Score tied at nothing going into&nbsp;the bottom of the eighth. Bondo (VOTE VOTE VOTE!!!!) was pitching spectacularly and his counterpart, Baker, was pitching just as well. Marcus Thames, who is one of those guys you just have to root for, started at DH for Sheff who was serving a suspension, hits a line drive homerun and Jonesy closes it out in the ninth one-two-three. Beautiful.

Next topic. I have a job now. Today was the second day.&nbsp;It's at the same place my mom works, which can get kind of sticky at times, but it's extremely convenient. It's good pay, but it's been frustrating because nobody seems to know what they want me to do with what they hired me to do. It's just really frustrating because sometimes I feel like I'm more just in the way than anything or I'm kind of useless. I sometimes feel like I'm getting paid (more than minimum(!)) to just sit there and take up space. Oh well,&nbsp;I guess I kind of can't complain too much. I mean, I AM getting paid (more than minimum).&nbsp;I guess.&nbsp;

When I actually get sleep, I dream. My dreams are never good ones. They almost always leave me with an uneasy, disturbed feeling when I wake up. Sometimes I don't even remember what I dream about, but there's still that nagging feeling. It's like a sinking feeling. Like when you go to sleep to try to sleep off something bad, like a bad day or something, but when you wake up you know that something is wrong, but you can't quite think of what it is. It's&nbsp;kind of&nbsp;depressing.

Well, it's almost 10 now, so I'm going to try to get some sleep.&nbsp;The working all day thing is extremely exhausting, even when it feels like I'm not doing anything. Especially when it feels like I'm not doing anything.&nbsp;"

Placido Polanco is now leading all AL second basemen in the all star voting. Good job, this is well deserved. Keep up the voting. I have actually voted 100 times myself so far (using four email addresses, ha). Also, Magglio Ordonez needs help getting in the top three outfielders. Last I heard he was fourth, which is unfathomable. How can a guy hitting a league-leading .381 average and 34 doubles NOT be in the starting three outfielders?? So, voting must be done to correct this. ""Change gonna come...""

While I'm on the Tigers subject... I don't understand why Andrew Miller is in the rotation over Chad Durbin. Yes, Miller pitched six shutout innings yesterday, but he threw almost entirely fastballs. And against the&nbsp;offensively-challenged Braves. Come on now. The dude's obviously gotta work on his offspeed stuff, and I don't think that he can properly do that up here. And Chad Durbin pitched AMAZINGLY during his time in the rotation, especially considering he wasn't even supposed to be, you know,&nbsp;good. Chad Durbin can throw pitches other than his fastball for strikes, thus leading me to believe that he will be more effective&nbsp;than Miller at this point. Ah well. That's why I'm not the manager, I 'spose.

Things have been incredibly noneventful lately.&nbsp;
I got two stitches in my chin last Tuesday after colliding&nbsp;with the opposing shortstop while I stole second. Kind of cool, I guess. My first stitches, not including the ones in my mouth after oral surgery a few years ago. I'm actually surprised it took this long, ha.&nbsp;I hit an RBI double that game, too. Take that.
Two weekends ago we went 7-1 in a tournament, which is crazy good. I didn't have a tournament this past weekend, so things are even more noneventful than normal.
We got new phones, finally. Our old ones were crap, so I'm pretty happy about this.
I really want a ton of CDs, but I don't want to spend any of my money because I reallyyyyyy want&nbsp;a car before school starts again.&nbsp;
I hate school. I kind of dislike life, too. It's so damn noneventful it's killing me. Whatever, I guess. I'll get over it, I always do. 

Okay, I'm done."

If I heard it correctly, she had been arrested 23 times before this.&nbsp;TWENTY-THREE&nbsp;TIMES!!! Who lets somebody like that back into society?? Honestly.&nbsp; I think they said she'd pleaded guilty 3 times to crack possession or something having to do with crack. Who lets somebody like that back into society? Shouldn't there be someone, if they DON'T lock them up, watching&nbsp;people like that closely? Like parole officers or something?

"event","<p><strong>I love words.</strong>&nbsp;They're amazing. I love the way you can use them to do so many different things. You can make the same words mean completely different things. You can make words mean something they aren't meant to mean. You can arrange them differently and you can interpret them differently. Everybody could get something different out of the same phrase. I love how there are so many different words that mean the same general things. But then at the same time they can mean something entirely different. Synonyms for words can describe things differently than others.&nbsp;Words can describe things in the coolest ways. They can be beautiful, they can be ugly, they can be contemplative, they can be shallow, they can be evasive. Words can make you feel things. They can make others feel things.&nbsp;They can be just about anything you want to make them. But then sometimes, you just&nbsp;can't seem to make them say what you want. You may have the general meaning, but not the feel that you're looking for. It's that feeling, that personal feeling, that makes words so awesome.&nbsp;<br />Everybody has a different style of putting these words together, too.&nbsp;The words they choose and&nbsp;how they choose to arrange them&nbsp;very often&nbsp;represents who&nbsp;they are as a person. How the words are interpreted&nbsp;by individuals makes that person who they are.&nbsp;<br />And to ever not be able to have that variation of words that allows one to so carefully express the feeling they want is a horrible thought. It's a violation of freedom of speech. In my opinion, freedom of speech is not just the ability to speak your mind, but also to express it how you want. It's one thing to have an opinion or a thought, but to be able to really, truly express how you <em>feel</em> is something that Newspeak does not allow. To minimize the words you can use&nbsp;for expression&nbsp;is just a complete violation of freedom of speech. I don't think that feeling something is completely the same as having an opinion.<br />I love words.&nbsp;<br /></p>"

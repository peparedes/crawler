"event","My soul is gone.Everything I have ever believed in has died.I have gone through my entire life knowing what to do in every given situation.Yet here and now i find myself broken and beaten,unable to concentrate and think this through to find the proper solution.I can break any law in our government by careful planning,yet i cannot find a way to revive what has been lost.My mind is flawed and confused,unable to focus without Kana.I have tried my best for her,but can it mean anything now,thinking on her best interests.How can you help and protect someone and give them that which they claim to want if they arent willing to do the same for themselves.I have so many questions that i want to ask,but i fear the answers.For the first time snce my grandpa died when i was 13,i am truly and undeniably afraid.I let my guard down and it crushed me.Now i have my guard back up and i yurn so badly to let it down again,but i am afraid,and dont know how to let it down.Three years.Now,just the simple thought of being with her in any physical sense,even holding hands or kissing,forces these images into my mind of what she may have done.It feels as if my mind has been burned with a branding iron,and,try as i might,i cannot ignore the mark any more so than i can the wound to my right arm try as i may.I know i still want to grow old with Kana,and die,holding her in my arms,feeling the warmth of her breathe,but when you so rarely let your guard down,is it so easy to forgive the only person that has ever managed to bring me to your knees,or forget the entire situation alltogether,which would be preferable.I know very little,but i do know one thing,without Kana,i may as well have died physically that day,not just spiritually."

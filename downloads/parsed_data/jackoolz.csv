"event","<p>i still cannot get over the atonement. i like the film but I LOVE the book. james, oh dear lord, james was good. i do hope that he'll win an award for this movie. i especially loved the confrontation scene with the sister, oh meng! he was brilliant. i rather find him short though, he even told&nbsp;the press&nbsp;that he is only 5' 7 and he is not a classic leading male star like brad pitt, hahaha! he is the same height as me. </p><p>part in atonement movie that really fucking kills me and stayed&nbsp;in my mind even when i sleep, was the narrating letters of robbie to cecilia.</p><p><em>**dearest cecilia, the story can resume. the one that i have been planning on that evening walk. i can become again the man that once walk the surrey park at dusk in my best suit, swaggering on the promises of life. the man with the clarity of passion made love to you in the library. the story can resume, i will return, find you, love you, marry you and live without a shame**</em></p><p>such a tragic love story, i love it! makes me a cynical person become optimistic when it comes to love, does that makes sense? i dunno. i did not cry on this movie but i&nbsp;cried like a mofo&nbsp;in the book.&nbsp; ian mcewan is a brilliant storyteller and while reading the book, its seems like as a reader i felt robbie in me and how he is losing his soul each and everyday but the promises of cecilia are the one keep him going on. uff, medyo corny na ba? haha! i want to thank mr mcewan for perking up my literally obsession. i'm also glad that i have a friend who shares the same passion when it comes to reading and will start a james mcavoy appreciation group in facebook =p</p><p>ok, back to my old self...sorry, shameless post of my mcdreamy- JAMES MCAVOY! he is soo married that makes him so hawt, hahaha! ok obviously i wanted to wear a scarlett letter on my chest.</p><p><img alt="""" src=""http://z.about.com/d/movies/1/0/4/N/Q/atonementpic5.jpg"" /> i swear i'm having those school girl crush again which is a good sign cos i complained before that i dont crush anyone anymore even movie stars. i guess, im not an ice queen of narnia....yet!</p>"

mia: i just saw 300

mia: oh my gawd i nearly fainted
me: why too violent
mia: hell no! too many men, too many abs, too many six pack- ahay!!!!
me: lol, isn't he cute, the king.
mia: darling he is my new wallpaper. i want him to be my sugar daddy
me: i thought george clooney is your sugar daddy?
mia: that was before but he's too old to carry a sheild baby
me: i crush astinos- the guy with  the head got chopped off.
mia: oh yeah i like him too, he is marco bailey you know
me: marco bailey?
mia: yeah from mile high
me: ohh....damn he became hot
mia: yeah but daddy gerard is still delicioso
me: hey that xerxes king looks like that indian gay guy we saw at arq
mia: lol (for 1 min) i'll call him xerxes from now on, hahaha. you're mean!
mia: hey do you think gerards' butt  was computerised too?
me: hahaha, i dont think so..why does it look fake?
mia: nope...too hot. i wanna squeeze them in the morning

oh my God, it was never ending. the last time he gushed like this about a movie was clueless and he soo wanna be like alicia silverstone. he thinks that this top off spartacus as the new gay icon movie- i think so too. me and mia will watch this again in imax, hahaha- gerard BUTTler fan club. he is already planning a 300 theme float for the next year mardi gras. 300 gay guys marching daw along the oxford street, haha, funny =)

i'm so happy coz.....

BABY GOT MAC!!!

i'm still a bit lost, this is my first mac. like posting pics i'm still struggling, even simple things that i used to do on pc but i'm not going to give up; this mac is such a sexy beast. the mac support in apple website is not a great help. i can't call my friend dee cos he is anti-mac, i wished i got lots of friends who own mac. any suggestions for a book or website that can help beginners like me to become an expert.

it was not my plan to buy a mac. my plan was just to buy fabric paint at spotlight. then the next thing i knew i was fiddling with this mac inside dick smith store, they were on sale plus a free office mac with every purchase. i think it was my subsconscious mind that bought this thing kasi wala talagang plano but nonetheless i'm happy with my purchase."

"event","<p>Pheew! my first ever post for a very long time.......</p>
<p>it feels kinda odd,&nbsp;it's kind of&nbsp;i'm in&nbsp;a computer rehab and i'm not allowed to touch any computers. work is really hectic, a lot of changes at work so i've been snobbing my friends and i haven't had&nbsp;fun in ages. so i've been very good except this time i have a new drinking buddy---- my mum. </p>
<p>after dinner, we usually have tea and some bikkie, but this time we have a glass of red each to help us go to sleep. hahaha! we're becoming alcoholics yo!</p>
<p>so&nbsp;me and my girls&nbsp;went out today, had dinner and watch a movie. we watched john tucker must die. i dunno, i can't find jesse metcalf sexy or even drool worthy. maybe i watched so many passions (don't ask!) before that i'm waiting for charity to pop out or that midget timmy.</p>
<p>it was funny though coz lately me and my girls were talking about how guys these days are so fucking retards. i mean, they are listening to their knob than their brains, right?????</p>
<p>i don't want to be discourage&nbsp;with this&nbsp;observations but WHERE ARE THE DECENT GUYS????&nbsp; guys that are not playing games. guys who are honest and sincere. guys that find woman as a person with feelings and not an accessories. is my friend right? are they just bunch of dickheads roaming around the streets looking for a victim, make them fall inlove, hit them in the sack and then dump them. shit this is what i hate about singlehood, yeah its fun no boundaries, no ties pero puta the emotional part dude, nakakainis.</p>
<p>example na lang ha, like this good mate of mine (i will not name names) he is going out with this uber fashionista chick and really pretty. they're been going out for two years now and planning to move in together. they are basically married in bills ( ie shared car bill, telephone, accomodation) but everytime we are talking about how we meet a new bunch of hot girls and he's all going gaga and wanted to meet them. shit lucky i'm not that close to her gf or else i'll tell her about his dirty little dick.</p>
<p>i think guys stop looking&nbsp;to the other&nbsp;women when they are already in their bed pan or maybe when they go blind. i mean hands up those who think that your man is 100% honest with you? even when they are sleeping they are cheating on you. they are having wet dreams over jessica alba's butt or maria sharapova's leg.&nbsp;<br /><br />what i don't understand is what they frontin' on you. they pretend like they are the new age sensitive guys. like they are the victim of this ever changing world. i've been meeting a lot of guys lately who wants to get married, damn what is happening in this world? are the guys now becoming a sucker for romance? does tiffany and co targeting the late twenties male nowdays? if that was six years ago, i'll probably so aswoon and end up marrying some ass wipe dude, but i turned so jaded right now that romance does nothing on me. flowers-arghhhh! bulgari ring- fuck off. i listened to destiny's child so much that i surpass beyonce when she said ""all the ladies who are independent, throw your hands above me"".</p>
<p>my mum keep pushing me to get married that's why i think she wanted me to go back in phils and use my AUSTRALIAN CITIZEN charm to get a husband. she always said, "" i can die now if i see all of you settled"". then i'll answer her with ""that's why i'm not getting married coz i want you to live longer!"" i'm so terrible eh?!?</p>
<p>i always pray to God that i'm doing a right thing&nbsp; about deciding not to get married. i've seen a lot of old lady at work who are not married (most of them are retired nurses-yikes!) and they are living alone and in some way miserable. i don't want to be grumpy and miserable but i guess i'll be like that if i don't break&nbsp; this super protective barrier that no one can pass and hurt me.</p>
<p>i better stop thinking about this barrier bullshit again coz it made me think of this fucker that help me built them and he ain't worthed to be remembered.<br /><br />hay naku enough with this bullshit, this is making me depressed. i'm still waiting for my romeo though,&nbsp;pero i think nakuha na rin sya ng bading :( :(</p>"

patay na naman ako nito!!!

oh yeah btw, tristan and isolde is like an adaptation of a mills and boon pocket book in big screen, such a crappy movie. i was so excited to watch this movie coz i love all that star-crossed lover type of movie pero it doesn't have anything that click my movie experience, the story suck.

everyone are so pretentious, those fuckin poser think that they're all that. ethiopian/sudanese/south african guys thinks that they are posse' of snoop dogg with their baggy clothes and FAKE blings. white guys think they are sean paul or worse kevin federline with their corn rows and bandana. filo guys think that they are so cute act like jarule, puhlease 5 ft 0 doesn't make you a gangsta.

and the girls, my gawd! i may sound like an old maid but what's the point of wearing a skirt if your purpose is to show your g-string when you play pool. it was hoochies galore! paris hilton wannabe overload. i hate it! hate it!


i went out of the club at 12:00, pretend that i got a massive headache ( well i did!) went to a friends house and drank wine while we watch ""CHARMED"" early years, you know the one with shannen doherty.

<P>i was watching it just a few hours ago, i'm starting to like the show, cos in many ways i understand those medical terminology that they keep blabbing all the time. mum was watching it too and she once again said that i should shift to medicine. i don't know, don't get me wrong i love being a student and i hope that i can be a student forever but i saw some meds intern in hospital and just watching that show really made me so exhausted. i know that she'll be so proud to have a ""surgeon"" daughter but nah...i don't think i can hack it. during my short stint in hospital as a student nurse, i saw a lot of dickhead doctors, asshole patient and annoying sons of bitches. i'll go back in the hospital one of this days but right now, i'll stay still in my little office, in this retirement village doing nothing sometimes and i only got one boss to think about.</P>
<P>btw, i really can't keep my hair long, my hairdresser/good friend cress cropped my really boring bob haircut. she was laughing when she saw my bob cos it was really feral. i was trying to get that natalie portman bob in closer but end having jim carrey dumb and dumber look. i guess looking normal doesn't suits me, so i'm back&nbsp;in this&nbsp;short funky hair-again and will keep it forever till i lose a bit of weight. </P>
<P>we were playing pusoy dos last night ( me. cres, ronald and allan) and it was funny when we took all our cigarettes out,&nbsp;all of us got different brands. mine are marlboro lights since highschool. cress love her cartier but will change soon as they will remove them in the store. ronald smoke menthol- st. moritz, what a fag! hahaha! and allan love his blue dunhills. i remember we used to pinch someone elses cigarettes but now we stick to our own brands. anyhoo, we were playing it while i'm waiting for my blond streak to set in. i get distracted to my cards coz it was naked women! 100% bimbos with fake boobs, sheeet!</P>
<P>oh and yeah about my plan on joining pinoy big brother next year, ahh yeah.. i kinda change my mind coz i'm not pretty and i haven't graced the cover of fucken FHM and i don't have any sad story of struggle- boo hoo! there's nothing real on those people, i mean none of them was real looking, not all pinoys have pointy nose and mestizas, HELLO we are brown. i'm just kinda upset coz i don't have model look :( and my face is not good in reality tv, no one will watch this face.</P>"

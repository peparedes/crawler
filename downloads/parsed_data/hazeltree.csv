<P>You are the fabulously quirky and independent woman of character. You go your own way, follow your own drummer, take your own lead. You stand head and shoulders next to your partner, but you are perfectly willing and able to stand alone. Others might be more classically beautiful or conventionally woman-like, but you possess a more fundamental common sense and off-kilter charm, making interesting men fall at your feet. You can pick them up or leave them there as you see fit. You share the screen with the likes of Spencer Tracy and Cary Grant, thinking men who like strong women."

Another day breaks and the last one's gone.

<b>What is music to you? How do you define music?</b>
Music, to me, is a constant in my life. I could give you a technical definition of it, but that really wouldn't do any of the arts justice. Music has always been in my life, from my father singing me to sleep every night, to my mother practicing for her opera. The only time our house is silent is when everybody is asleep or it's empty. My head plays a soundtrack to everything I do, and as long as I don't think anybody's paying too much attention, you will find me breaking into song or dance. I think that life without music would be bleak and unmoving.
 
<b>What is poetry to you? How do you define poetry?</b> 
Aaaaaaaaaah, poetry, my second saviour. Whether in rhymed verse or free verse, I can never get enough! There have been so many times that I have been ready to burst with frustration, flood over with beauty, or wrench my heart out with sobbing and my swollen fingers have saved the day. I have definitely gone through ups and downs in my life, and my writing reflects all of it. The only thing I'm sure of is that I don't think I could ever stop.  

<b>What is art to you? How do you define art?</b> 
I think that art is anything that somebody has constructed to be pleasing to the eye, and/or convey a message or emotion. I am somebody who is obsessed with beauty. It is not that I condemn those that do not ""fit my mould"", I simply love looking at things that please me. I find many different concepts beautiful, and no matter what art you happen to have, if I know you have it I will push you to show me....did I mention I'm also curious?

<b>What is a movie to you? How do you define movie?</b> 
A movie to me is any motion picture that is not a series on television. I love unique movies that have captivating cinematography and are psychological thrillers or drive at the problems of humanity. I also love musicals!

<b>What is fashion to you? How do you define fashion?</b> 
To be quite honest, there are two things I think of when I see the word ""fashion"". One is a runway with people wearing overly priced clothing that is ugly and impractical and once reproduced would be tailored for 12cents/hour in Malaysia. The other is picturing all those girls that went to school with me that wore 60lbs of makeup and all the same clothing like those new jeans that came already dirty for $20 more to be ""cool"". I only like the type of fashion that is like art. I like dressing everyday because each day is different and it's like a project reflecting my mood and to hell with what is ""in style"" or what the rest of you ppl think? No offense.  

<b>What is life to you? How are you using it?</b> 
Sorry to burst all of your bubbles, but I believe that we are no greater than any other animal on this planet, and therefore we do not go to some great heaven in the afterlife, and we do not have some dude sitting in the sky who'd obviously have been a dumbass if he'd existed 'cause look how much he fucked up with us! Reincarnation doesn't really seem plausible to me either due to population trends. I'm not going to condemn or pity other people for their beliefs, as most religious people seem to do to me for mine, but I'm just saying that that's what I think. Therefore, I think that the whole point to life is to keep your eyes open, experience everything you can (good AND bad), find things that make you happy that don't jeopardize others' happiness, and try to make it so you add to the world and the people in it instead of take away like most do.

<b>What is love to you? What is a good marriage to you? What are your deepest emotions? Please describe them in details.</b>
Good god, who's the genius who grouped the big ones together?!?! Love is one of the deepest emotions I've felt, as I would do almost anything for the person I love. I would not sacrifice my own well-being, as then they obviously don't love me as much and I'd have to reconsider things, but other than that I'd do anything. Love is a great many things. Love is looking at Johnny Depp and honestly thinking ""I don't want to fuck him, I want my bf."" THAT IS LOVE, BELIEVE ME!! On a more serious note, love is when you don't know where that week together went but this hour apart is torture. Love is when you don't hold a single secret and you can be honest and open, and trust that the other person is doing the same for you. Love is when you can be comfortable in any mood around each other, and you can debate and understand that both have different views, and that's okay. Love is when you're crying and you need your best friend, and so you call up your partner. A good marriage is when the marriage itself doesn't matter at all. The couple is so entwined and commited that the only reason they throw the darn wedding is for legal reasons (and to please the mothers!). They can spend their time together but also leave time for family and friends, and have their own lives, careers, and personalities separate from each other. They can communicate, co-operate, and compromise. The other deepest emotion that I (and I believe most others) can feel is fear. Fear stops so many important things and begins so many negative things. It is felt most strongly among humans and is our biggest plague.

<b>What is the most memorable thing from your childhood?</b> 
I think feeling afraid is honestly very prominent in my childhood memories. Other things are music, reading, and of course my comerade, Snowy. Snowy is my teddy bear that was bought for me before I was born, and I've had him by my side since I was placed in a crib. His fur is matted, bare, and grey now, but he is my buddy, and knows everything about me. I am not even joking when I say that people other than me have looked into his eyes and said that he is alive.

<b>What are your innermost fears?</b> 
My innermost fears are that I will hurt those I love, that I won't be able to stick to my convictions, that I won't always tell the truth, that I won't find a career that is enough to live on that I have a passion for, that I won't get published, and that if I have a child, it won't trust me or itself enough to grow into its own person that shares themself with me.

<b>How do you think we can learn to love one another?</b> 
I think that if everybody could be sure with themselves, they wouldn't have to be afraid of one another, and they wouldn't have to build hierarchies and egos and war with one another. I don't think this is really possible, as the most vicious, insecure beings are the ones who believe they are the highest and problem-free. I think that the most we can do is treat others with respect, especially ourselves, as the world really does come full-circle.

<b>When was your most hopeless point in life?</b> 
I seem to feel hopeless a lot, and as much as I try to control it, it always tries to edge its way in. I think the worst time so far was the last four years, as they were degenerative. I never knew what I was feeling or thinking, as my thoughts would race and my moods would swing so quickly. I was paranoid and hated myself and was sure others hated me too, and knew I was going crazy. I just wanted to end myself, but was too scared to do so.

<b>When did you last cry for someone or something? What happened?</b> 
To be honest, I feel fragile lately, so I'm crying a lot. Anything that's really beautiful or tugs at the heart can get to me. I'd prefer not to go into detail.

<b>What was the most influential novel or movie in your life?</b> 
I just went and looked through all of my books and movies. To be honest, while there are so many beautiful stories that have touched me and should be read by the world because it is important that they have life given to them, I can't say that there is one that has profoundly influenced me. Perhaps one has without me noticing, but right now it's not coming to mind. That certainly does not stop me from reading anything I can find time to, though!"

"event","So I am trying to make everything come together in order for me to move to Vancouver by the end of November. I have been offered a position where I'd be trained in becoming a piercer. This is something I've dreamed about ever since I was 10yrs. old. To be able to actually live out this dream and be paid for it would be absolutely amazing! There's just so many things I have to think about. I have to finish a five month math course in two months so I can graduate high school before I leave, I have to set up doctors and psychiatrists over in Van, and I have to come up with the money (the hardest part). I am hoping that Parker's offer of bumming on his couch for a month or so until I get a couple paychecks to afford my own place is still up for grabs. Otherwise this whole plan is a wash. I am completely freaking out, because math is my weakest subject, getting to know a new psych is gonna take a year or more (and be a bitch), and I just don't know how I'm going to come up with the money to survive. I only work a paper route two times a week, so I'm trying to find a second job that wouldn't take up tons of time, but would earn me a bit more cash. I feel like I'm going to puke. I haven't talked to my father yet, but my mother isn't interested in helping me out. For some reason she thinks it is more my friends' responsibility to help me out by putting me up in Van until I can pay for rent, instead of her lending me money as a grad gift. *Sigh*

And now down to the nitty gritty. I've broken up with Alex. This was to try and free me of an overload of responsibility, and also of the negative attitude that he's had of-late. Unfortunately, it's really not working. I am getting caught up in too many romances of yesteryear that I guess didn't ever work out for good reason. Everybody hears I'm single, they all rush forward. I'm sure that sounds cocky, but I'm honestly just feeling like I could scream. I love all of my friends dearly for different reasons, and they've stayed ""just friends"" for different reasons. However, my alchoholic tendencies (I've drank every single day minus 2 days for 3 months straight) are starting to affect my mood drastically. I'm seeing hallucinations not just at night, but in broad daylight now. It becomes harder to realize what's real and what's not. I'm not so sure of what I'm feeling anymore. My meds have been upped to compensate, but all I feel is lethargic, which I compensate by drinking more liquor. I feel like I'm falling in love, and I'm not even sure if it's real. But it's not truly returned past being a friend and a fuck buddy, so better off for me to move on anyhow, right? Hey, can you tell I'm getting drunk already? Here I am on a Monday night, sitting by myself, and on my third beer. I'm going somewhere, eh? I just don't know where. 

I sliced my arm up nicely with my exquisite camping knife from House of Knives. I'm so confident lately, but still so sad. My mother took one look and said ""Hoooolly???"" with that motherly glare. I told her I was rough-housing with the boys. She told me it looked a little too semetrical, but she bought it. Sometimes I wish people would catch me more in my falsehoods. Maybe it would do me some good. Unfortunately it seems to be one place where I can pull off being smooth."

"event","I'm so fucking confused right now. Part of it may be because I've been sick with a kidney infection and infections on the nerves in my legs, and I was off my lithium for 2 1/2 weeks as a result. I am so unbelievably horny, I'm getting myself off 4 times a day min, and it's starting to interfere with things considering I hardly ever see Alex these days. I feel horrible to say it, but I'm starting to get attatched to a few other people, and I can't separate whether it's hormones, loneliness, more than that, or a bit of everything...argh! Plus, does anyone find it weird that I really want to bring Shakespeare back to life and fuck his brains out? Perhaps following a bath; after all, we are talking about a 16th century man here. 

I'm trying to get a job (not very earnestly at the moment, I must admit), but my mother is pressuring me over the top in her attempts to be ""supportive"". It's driving me nuts because I need the money, and I'd really like her to stop being annoyed with me. Someone should pay people for job hunting, as it's a hell of a lot more work than any minimum wage job out there.

I'm starting a group for people with social anxiety at the end of August/beginning of September. It's going to be two hours every week for twelve weeks, and they told me to expect mega homework. Oiy! Kind of ironic, don't you think? A GROUP for...you get the point. I was also given a perscription today to try out. It's gabapentin, which I'm supposed to take an hour before I do something like go to a party, go for an interview, or take a test to reduce anxiety and OCD compulsions. I've been thinking, ""Oh god, more meds,"" but considering I've been self-medicating my anxiety with cocaine and meth of-late, I guess it's a step above. My hope is that by the time I'm finished the group in December, the pills will no longer be such a necessity.

I'm pretty much tired of having what I think to be other people's expectations rule my life. I feel I've come so far in a year and three months (since the EMP), but that I'll always be a work-in-progress."

"event","I'm back in the clutches of depression for the first time in a year. It feels horrible. I suppose that's a given, but I just can't stop feeling frightened about what my mood is going to fuck up next. It's fucking up my school, it's fucking up my ability to quit smoking, it's fucking up my ability to search for a job, and it's fucking up my relationship with Alex (although he's loving not taking responsibility for any of it). I finally made my A in English, the pace of the course is starting to quicken, and I feel like it takes all of my will and energy to make it on that bloody bus each morning. 

The panic attacks have started up again, and even when they're not present, my heart has permanently sped up as a side effect of my constant stress. I have a crying binge about three times a day, and I hate it when the tears well up in unexpected places like on the bus or in the school halls. Everything feels too close and like it is underwater, and I get so self-concious that I wish I could close myself in a room and never come out. On the flip side, I can't be completely alone because then I just think in circles and it kills me.

None of this is foreign, except for the anger. The other night a girl came over to Alex's house who I loathe, and I don't know what came over me but all I could see is my fist slamming so far into her face that her head crashed back into the wall behind her and she slumped down to the floor as I smiled in satisfaction, finally. I have never felt like this before. Never so cranky, angry, violent. When I feel bodies around me I am constantly pulled into myself, aware that I'm ready to pounce. WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH ME? Even when I was depressed before, never once did I feel bitchy. Hardly ever did I lash out or snap at people over pointless things, or seriously consider that I needed to hurt someone to calm down. I keep telling myself that cutting is stupid and pointless, but my old habits are beginning to look more and more tantalizing.

Four things have happened in the last week that have made it the worst I've endured in a year. I slumped into physical signs of depression, which have brought along the mental ones. I was completely ditched and disrespected by the person I love more than anything in the world. The other two reasons I must shut up about in order to protect those involved. 

I know that I should've realized by now that with this disorder there is no permanent remission. I'm just getting so tired of it screwing up the life that I've just begun to build back up."

"event","A long song, but worth every second!

Now in Vienna there's ten pretty women
There's a shoulder where Death comes to cry
There's a lobby with nine hundred windows
There's a tree where the doves go to die
There's a piece that was torn from the morning, 
and it hangs in the Gallery of Frost
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay- Take this waltz, take this waltz, 
take this waltz with the clamp on its jaws 

I want you, I want you, I want you 
on a chair with a dead magazine
In the cave at the tip of the lilly, 
in some hallway where love's never been
On a bed where the moon has been sweating, 
in a cry filled with footsteps and sand
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay- Take this waltz, take this waltz, 
take its broken waist in your hand 

This waltz, this waltz, this waltz, this waltz
With its very own breath of brandy and Death
Dragging its tail in the sea 

There's a concert hall in Vienna 
where your mouth had a thousand reviews
There's a bar where the boys have stopped talking
They've been sentenced to death by the blues
Ah, but who is it climbs to your picture 
with a garland of freshly cut tears? 
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay- Take this waltz, take this waltz, 
take this waltz, it's been dying for years 

There's an attic where children are playing, 
where I've got to lie down with you soon,
in a dream of Hungarian lanterns, 
in the mist of some sweet afternoon
And I'll see what you've chained to your sorrow, 
all your sheep and your lillies of snow
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay- Take this waltz, take this waltz 
with its ""I'll never forget you, you know."" 

And I'll dance with you in Vienna
I'll be wearing a river's disguise
The hyacinth wild on my shoulder, 
my mouth on the dew of your thighs
And I'll bury my soul in a scrapbook, 
with the photographs there, and the moss
And I'll yield to the flood of your beauty, 
my cheap violin and my cross
And you'll carry me down on your dancing 
to the pools that you lift on your wrist
Oh my love, oh my love, take this waltz, take this waltz
It's yours now; it's all that there is."

"event","When I first walked into the EMP, I was immediately drawn to a somber girl who sat by herself and looked close to my age. After the first awkward introduction, we found out that we were within two years of each other's age, and that we were both bipolar. 

Over the next two months (we were lucky enough to be roomates), Erin and I became quite close. We realized that we had a lot in common. We both felt like we had to constantly socialize, but like we couldn't be around anybody two weeks later. We'd lost a lot of our close friends who didn't understand this behaviour as a result. We also had very low self-esteem. 

We and another girl, Tove, became the fearsome threesome; we enjoyed our vodka in waterbottles and smokes on the roof-garden island while wearing tiger lilies in our pigtails. We'd dubbed the island Hawaii. We made our overnight escape to an art show behind Value Village, and had our terrifying chase scene when locked on the second floor with an escaped psychotic meth head. Best of all, Erin was somebody that I was able to just chill out with. We'd put on some music and sing out our frustrations, or I could just say, ""You know what..."" and she'd know. We'd experienced so many of the same things, we wanted the same respect (not just from others, but from ourselves), and we were able to give each other a comfort and an enjoyment that would not have been there otherwise.

The friendship carried on past the hospital. We'd become such good friends in such a short time that we knew this was valuable. I would go to her apartment and we'd have a movie marathon, or we'd just hang out and talk. Sometimes there would be a huge party, bringing Tove and tons of the EMP-ers to drink it up and rock things out!

About three months ago I went into another social recluse stage of mine. I was getting stressed out about going for family Christmas vacations, and the fact that it was getting closer to exams for school. I made all of my usual Christmas cards, including one for Erin. I never got to give it to her. I found out yesterday that Erin passed away a little while ago from complications with her meds. Not only is this news absolutely heartaching, but I know how much Erin felt like she wasn't wanted at certain times. When I say certain times, I mean months at a time. I had this card in my hands, filled with my thoughts of how much she WAS wanted and appreciated, and she never got to hear it from me. I'm not saying I should've known or anything, as Erin and I had an understanding about either of us needing extended alone time, but I would be lying if I said that there wasn't any guilt creeping in.

I sometimes wish that I could believe in the whole afterlife thingy, because then maybe I could convince myself that she's reading this over my shoulder or something. Her boyfriend is a schizophrenic, and he's convinced that he can still hear her talking to him. I don't know whether to think that is sad, or that he is lucky. One consolation for Erin is that she is finally finished fighting a battle that has been plaguing her since she was young. It just sucks that it came at a time when she finally seemed to be doing well. I honestly hope that she rests in peace."

"event","My sister found out that the school screwed up on her transcripts, so not only is she going to graduate this semester, she's going to do it with extra credits! She phoned my mother up long distance to let her know that at least one of her children is going to graduate on time. I think she actually whooped. I'm really happy for her!

My P.D. (grandfather) has offered me the opportunity of going to college in Ireland for 4-9months next February or so. All I have to do is contact some people and find out if there is an exchange student my age who wants to come over here. I'm worried about a few things, like if I need a med change over there, or if my host family plots to drown me after they find out how long I take in the bathroom every morning. I was staring at an ash tray from Ireland today, however, and I'm really starting to think this is a great idea. I know I'm going to go to Ireland sometime in my life, and that I want to stay there for at least half a year if I do. Why not go now, when it's free and I'm still youthful and energetic? I'm just worried about life inevitably going on without me over here, and coming back distanced from my friends. I'm also a bit worried that schooling requirements will be different over there, and I will get there and have to upgrade, or I will have to do the same when I come back. Ah well, you take a risk, eh? My mother had already been to Paris and Russia by the time she was my age. You can't even speak English in those countries!! We'll see how things go.

Off to go home and relax. I went dancing last night with Taylor, Parker, and Karen. Chris was there too, but Chris doesn't dance. Karen is pretty cool, but she was sick, so I'll have to wait until next time to really party with her=) Parker danced, and it's always awesome to be there when somebody grooves for their first time."

I was sitting at a bench outside of the store, stuffing my purchases into my backpack as I hate carrying around extra bags. All of a sudden I noticed a group of four brawny men dressed in bandanas, denim, and ""ice"" coming towards me. None were under six feet tall. I was wondering if they were going to ask for a smoke or something, when one of them burst into song. I think another said it was a ""Beyonce tune"". One by one each fell into harmony, and when they forgot the rest of the lyrics to one song, they would move onto the next. I recognized an old Savage Garden tune, and some other popular ones I can't name. They patted me on the back, wished that I would enjoy the sunshine, and loped away. They were actually very talented, and besides enjoying the performance I have had something to laugh about for the rest of the day!"

So I suppose that it is important to have a day that the world devotes to love among all this war, sham and drudgery, but does it really have to include all this buY, bUY, BUY?!?!?! If you want a special day to celebrate how much you love one another, make it special; make it unique. For gods' sakes, don't equalize spending fifty bucks on some chocolate with an expression of true love. I will never understand why couples get so hyped up about such an unpersonalized, commercialized holiday, and I will never understand why those who are single even bother to get depressed about it.  

On a completely different note: Did you know that the war in Iraq is costing the United States $1 Billion US per WEEK to fund?!?! Isn't it sad that the most prominent country in the world prides itself in a bankruptcy as a result of a dishonest, nosey, testosterone-driven war instead of investing in essentials such as health care or education?"

  I feel so utterly restless. I don't know where I want to go from here, and I hate not knowing a direction. 

  It's so frustrating being in a position where people think they have you figured out. I've tried in the last month to not let anything lie and boil. Even if what I say can't change somebody's view, I'm still going to let them know my honest intentions, because I believe that is important. Believe me, however, knowing it won't change a thing is a hard lesson to learn.

"event","So I've felt like kind of a wreck lately...really tired, trying to get everything done that I'm supposed to before I head off to Ontario, and trying to see everybody as well. I'm going to have two weeks of solitude at a cottage in Ontario with my family, and I'm hoping it will be relaxing because I need a break- and I haven't even been doing that much these days. 

I'll be in Ont. from July 17th-August 2nd. So in advance, <b>HAPPY 19th BIRTHDAY, LEE!!!</b>

Anyhow, I'm hoping to get healthier in the next while, and I'm scared that I won't be motivated or self-willed enough to stick to my plans. I'm also scared because I have an interview tomorrow morning, I'm tired, and it's not going to go well: I can just feel it. It's not a real job or anything- it's volunteer, but I need to treat it just as rigidly as a paying job, for this is me testing myself to see if I'm ready to take on that responsibility again. I need money, and on good days, I feel as though I could conquer the world. Then other days (I can't tell if it's me being pessimistic or realistic, most likely a bit of both) I take a step back and think; what am I DOING? I'm not getting anything done, not reaching my goals, and I'm not even trying to do anything hard yet! Argh! 

I'm so confused these days...I don't know what I want, what I need, what my limits are, what my balanced life should entail, how to carry out my everyday plans. I don't know how to push myself anymore, and I STILL don't know how to take care of myself properly. *sigh*

    Reading through Taylor's ""journal entries"", for lack of a better title, I have gone from bitter to contemplative, to the place I am now. I think this mood would be best described as a mixed sense of recognition. I have, more or less, thought the same, written the same, concluded- you guessed it- the bloody same. As my eyes scanned the words, it was not only the act of reading the present, but a slide show of triggered memories. A rush of intense emotion engulfed me, so vivid and swift that it has left me jumbled and reeling.

    It is in my nature to spout endless advice, however hypocritical it may be. What appears to be verbal diarrhea (as it is not backed up by example) is, in actual fact, a simple yearning to help my friends achieve what they independently yearn for.

    I've noted that in many accounts Taylor ponders ""happiness"", ""truth"", learning to be content with yourself, and wanting to be more. (Any definition I believe to be subjective, I've put in quotations.)I believe that ""happiness""- like ""perfection""- is subjective. On that note, I believe that chasing after the latter is a waste of time, as no other soul can recognize it. What is the use of perfection to yourself? (I will explain what I mean further on.*)

    As for happiness, that is merely a a title for becoming wise to contentment. If you are content with your life (life being the subjective aspect, as each individual's is different), then you have attained the seemingly elusive happiness. Before most can achieve this, however, they need to undergo a shift of perspective.

    Society seems to be playing a game of pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey with us. We are taught that happiness <i>itself</i> is the subjective. That we must construct a model for ourselves which, once we can change/reform ourselves to fit, we will have our happiness...is bullhockey! This is where we have been blindfolded. Happiness, then, truly becomes the one-in-a-million beautifully pinned tail.

    Here we are confusing happiness with perfection. What we need to learn is that, as I've stated earlier, our lives are already the subjective. Then your blindfold comes off. *You recognize that while it is healthy to want to learn and try new things, and work honestly and fully at whatever you do, perfection is useless. Why construct a model of perfection to strive toward when you have yourself already?

    On your pilgrimage for contentment, you should not be concentrating change on your life's positions, but on your perspectives. The blindfold's off, and your true life goal is in graspable sight!

    I hear Taylor convincing himself that he believes he is perfect, and then voicing personal disdain on each page: ""I'm not happy...I should stop trying to sound smart...
I can't write well enough...I need to do this & that..."". Taylor, I don't care if you're perfect, and neither does anybody else (except possibly you). If you were ""perfect"", you wouldn't be Taylor. I just want you to be happy, whatever that means to you. Perhaps you should scrap the perfection shindig, and just be Taylor. 

    You write how you write, you act how you act, and perhaps someday your style will grow. I hope that is from experience and an enlightened perspective, and not simply sprouted from your want to fill a certain role. As for now, you might as well work on the self-acceptance aspect because habits are hard to change, and they are a reflection of who you are.

<b>P.S.-</b> There is no absolute truth. It sounds paranoid, but how can you be absolutely sure anything anyone says is the absolute truth? Canadians statistically lie 7-8 times a day, including embellishments of the truth. 43.7% of statistics are made up on the spot...see what I mean? LoL!

Seriously though, I believe the only truth a person can have is through what they, themselves have experienced. One can only know what one's learned firsthand; what one's witnessed. There still cannot be absolute truth because not everybody can experience everything, and even if they could, each person has a different perspective.

This, however, only applies to human knowledge. There is an absolute truth for everything that exists, for to have it exist, it has to be true. What is, is, what happens, happens. It is simply human accounts of the truth that cannot have an absolute.

I break into tears so many times a day, and it's gotten to the point where I can't even control when it's going to happen, so I end up choking back tears on the bus or some other public place.

I wouldn't get there on time; I would worry about people watching me all the time and have a panic attack. But I'm too old for money from my parents, and too young for disability, so I get to deal with the stress of having a gazillion debts, which I hate, just to be able to hang with my friends and get food and movies once and awhile, etc. I'm so angry with things right now. I feel like I want to break down and cry and never stop, and pound somebody to the point of overkill. I feel like I want to BE the overkilled. Everything I think these days is a contradiction of what I felt yesterday (or even an hour ago), and I can't stand it. I don't even know what I think or feel anymore because it's so back and forth.

I asked Alex to kill me the other day. Isn't that horrible? I'm too scared to do it on my own, but I'm so unhappy. All of the counselling and self-help books (the ones that say they're an alternative to drugs) say that I SHOULD be taking drugs after my test scores are evaluated. It's a downer. 
  Fuck, I don't even know what I'm saying right now. I've been in this daze for quite a long time now. I'm bored with everything and everybody, I can't stand company, yet I hate being alone and restless. I've had a writer's block for about six months, and I feel like nothing can release me from this numbness. I just want to feel something other than pity and frustration for myself. HEEEEEEEEELP MEEEEEEEEE!!!! 
  I don't know what I'm trying to ask of you. I doubt I can handle seeing people right now. I definitely can't express myself in the ways I wish I could anymore. I sound repetitive and whiny and I just can't stop hating everything I say and do and don't say and don't do and think and act and look and ARGH! 
  I am at the point where everything seems pointless because all I've been doing lately is exercising my self hate and waiting for the final plot of hopelessness which will end me. I don't know if I'm at the point where drugs are the best option or suicide is. Please just babble to me like you do.

"event","I don't know what I want. Because of this, I do many stupid things in search of the one thing that will make my insides finally untwist and relax. Because of this, I stay alive (it's harder than you think) in hopes that someday I will find something that will make me happy. But the more I hope and the more I try, the further I fall each time another plan doesn't work out. Plan isn't the right word, but I can't find any others right now that would fit. 

  I feel like everything I do is the wrong thing. I try to do what people tell me is right, but sometimes- no, most of the time- it's just so hard. How do you explain to somebody who's never felt a sadness harsher than when their dog died (I'm not saying this isn't sad...when my first dog died, I was depressed for weeks) that it's too hard to get up in the morning? It's too hard to look in the mirror and not want to smash what you see into a million shards. It's too hard to stay in this world of pain any longer. How do you say that you hate yourself, and that compliments are like blows to the heart because they feel like mockery? 

  For fuck's sake, I hate being angsty, I hate pitying myself, I hate myself. I went to a fucking mental hospital for two months, I've been out two days, and already I feel like I need to go back. It's just too tempting not to lock myself in a room and make myself bleed. Cutting seems stupid and pointless to most, and believe me, when I'm feeling good, it sounds stupid to me as well. But when your emotional pain is so bad that you can't breathe, you can't function, you want to die, it can start to look like the smart alternative. Watching the warm liquid burst out from underneath the pressed blade brings me comfort. It gives me an excuse to cry. For even though at these points I can't feel the physical aspect of it, I know it's SUPPOSED to hurt. I'm SUPPOSED to cry. And it's so much easier to cry at that than at the pain I feel but I don't know why.

  Sometimes I feel so alone...like I'm disappointing so many people, and at the root of it all, I'm also disappointing myself. I've just always felt so unsatisfied with my life. I think I know what I want, and then when I do it, it feels so wrong. And the fact that I was so sure THIS WAS IT makes me feel even worse. 

  I feel like I want somebody to hold me and love me. I can't seem to love me, so I need somebody else to love me and convince me that it's possible. Everybody who's ever confessed their love to me just doesn't fit. They don't understand me enough. I don't know what I'm looking for, really. This isn't a Want-Ad, here. I feel pathetic writing this. I'm always the first to say that people shouldn't need another ""half"" to feel complete. But goddamnit, what if for some people, that is so? What if some people weren't born with the ability to love themselves, feel understood, or feel wanted/needed? What if they need somebody to nurture to feel like they're worth anything? What if they need somebody to tell them they matter? I'm so self-reliant, thinking I can solve anything by myself, but what if I can't? What am I talking about, I KNOW by now that I can't. I have the answer for everything, and the one thing I can't figure out is my Self. Fuck, fuck, fuck."

"event","So I've been back at school for a week now, and already I've slipped back into my Geek Pattern of life. I decided that since it was Friday, and I didn't have to rush and do homework right away, that I would sit in on an 80 minute History lesson for fun! Yay! Okay, now apparently most ""normal"" people don't consider this a form of entertainment. Apparently a person can turn to a complete stoner-dropout, and be completely re-geekified. Isn't at amazing? Only the people who know what it's like to crave knowledge with their every being would understand...anyways, we covered the events leading up to- and the- first world war in one class. I'd heard most of it before, but some facts were new and interesting, and it was definitely worth it.

  I'm getting much happier lately. Actually getting out every morning and walking in the sunshine has done me good. Also, it feels good to actually accomplish something in a day. I'm taking Math P11 and English 11. My Math teacher, Mr. Greenwood, is fabulous! He is so enthusiastic, and you can't help but have fun when you're learning from him. He starts teaching at 8am, and doesn't finish all of his tutoring, etc. until 10pm. This has been every weekday for as long as he can remember. On weekends he marks homework and makes tests. He says that he can't imagine doing anything more satisfying or enjoyable with his life right now. How can you not smile at that?! Also, we all work together on our homework, and he won't leave for the day until everybody understands. He says the textbooks are crap, and signed them out to us for firewood and door jams! 

  I got to talk to an old friend of mine that I hadn't 'really talked' with for a long time. I appeciated  finally understanding some things that have been left hanging for awhile, and whether or not they realize it, it really filled something that was missing. <i>So thank you, you know who you are.</i>"

"event","<b>  I haven't written in this thing for so long, everybody's probably forgotten about me! I haven't had the interest or the energy to do much of anything lately, so most of my hobbies have gone to the fishies.
  I have an interview this Monday at 7pm with McDonald's. I know I always promised myself that I wouldn't ever apply at McDonald's, but I recently officially moved out of my mother's house, so now I'm desperate for anything that would make me money. McDonald's is easy to get into, and it's secure, so that's what I'm going for. I recently transferred to Spectrum Community school, but I'm dropping out to take correspondance, which is free if you aren't enrolled in any public schools. Now, if I can ace the interview and the work evaluation, and phone SIDES about correspondance, then I'll be rolling =)
  I did mushrooms the other night. They were SO much fun! I took an eighth, and ate it as fast as I could in little tiny pieces. I didn't get any visuals, but everything did seem more ""beautiful"" than it usually is, and I felt awesome. Alex, my bf, doesn't want me to do them anymore. We had a big fight, and I promised him that last night would be my last time. I'm torn because I don't want to break the promise, but at the same time it's my body, and I should be able to make my own decisions without worrying what others will think of me. Plus, it was SO MUCH FUN! I wouldn't make a steady habit of them, but I would like to do them again. *Siiiiiiigh*
  I'm living in a room with Alex and Sanae. Alex's mom is subletting this place by Crystal Pool for four months. It's been about one month since we got here. It's been fun a lot of the time, but I can't wait until I can afford to rent a bedroom from some landlord on my own, so I can have some privacy to do things my own way. If I can get this McDonald's job, I'll eventually be able to do just that. 
  That's all the energy I have for tonight, so good evening.</b>"

"event","<b>AAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!!! My mother is up island on business, and I just realized that we have NO fruit or vegetables in the entire house! ACK! What is a girl to do when there is only roast beef in the house, and she doesn't eat red meat? Lol! I feel an attack of scurvy coming on...
 
  I ended up resorting to frozen foods. I found a package that consisted of three frozen strawberries, one frozen pineapple slice, and a few frozen peach slices. I feel a slight bit better. Hmmmmmm *rummages further through freezer* AHA, BINGO! I just stumbled across some frozen mixed vegetables. Now I just have to boil these up=D

  20 Minutes Later: Nothing makes you feel better than having some juicy fresh food in your stomach. Yes, I'm living it up, because starting at 2am tomorrow morning until 8am on Saturday, I am on a famine! That's right, no solid food for 30 hours. I don't think it should be a problem, as I've gone for long periods of time without food before. Actually, come to think of it, these vegetables and fruit are the first solid things that have passed through my mouth since about 4pm yesterday. So I think this famine will just be a normal day in the life of Holly. We DO, however, get juice, which is I switch for me. I LOVE juice, we just never have it in the house. Mmmmmm, I can't wait until tomorrow now! 

  I took a loooong route home today. Instead of taking the 26 home which would take 20mins including the walking, I took the 27 downtown, then walked around in the sunshine and took the 70 home. I left right at 3:15 and didn't get home until 5pm. It was nice just to spend time thinking to myself, and also to get some fresh air. I now have East Indian music on, and I'm singing and dancing around my basement. Lol! Altogether, it has taken me about an hour to write this entry, because I keep having to jump up and dance. 

  For any of you who know me really well, this is normal! I get these bursts of energy, and the only way to get rid of it is to sing, dance, and be loud (hence usually outside and/or with friends). Ah, the many times I have embarassed Grace by skipping downtown, singing Christmas carols at the top of my lungs in June! I'd say sorry Gracye, but you know I'm not;)

  Anywho, not much more to say: I passed the aptitude and medical tests for the Reserves, but I have to come back for the interview on May 28th. I can't be an MP because my vision is too bad, which is very disappointing. It sort of makes you wonder when you see pilots with coke-bottle glasses, but at the same time they won't let me do military policing with mine. The other frustrating aspect is all the time it takes, and the many repetitive forms. Ah well, the military will be the military. As Karl put it, our motto is: HURRY UP and WAIT! I just hope I get into the basic training in July this year.

  And now folks, I must go and finish my dancing...Mwah!</b>"

"event","<b>Wow, I am so excited and SO nervous about this Wednesday. Karl, you're probably the only person who knows about this, but my Reserves interview etc. is at 7:45am, and I'm shaking already! I don't think I'm going to do well, because I'm not in good enough shape, I'm tired and cranky and slow a lot lately, and can't focus. Aaaaand, wouldn't you know it, I got my period two days before The Day. Ugh! They SPECIFICALLY said that the Part One Medical Exam should NOT be on the same day as your menstual cycle. Weeeell, mine's not due for another two weeks, and look what happens: the stress made it come early. Being female can really SUCK you know! Lol! I hope they're not mad that I will have to come back. Oh well, what can ya do?
I'm also pretty upset right now. See, I've been told (and can tell) that many people have been making fun of me behind my back, gossiping, etc. I mean, I don't even KNOW half of the people very well, so I don't know why I care so much about what they think of me. I guess this spawns from my charming elementary years when people made endless fun of the scrawny, geeky tomboy who had absolutely no friends and called her teacher ""Mommy"" because she was so insecure. I mean, I never said so much as a mean word to those kids. In fact, if any of them ever needed help, I would be the first person to give it to them. Maybe that's why it hurts so much...I just don't understand.
Anyways, I know it's pathetic to be so sad about stupid remarks, but I'm just feeling sensitive today, so that hit me deeper than it normally would or should have. Tomorrow is looking brighter, as there is a pep rally before lunch! I'm so glad because I have a psychiatric appointment, and I was worried that I would have to miss it. PEP PEP to you and all that!

"event","<b>I'm so drained. That's the only way to put it. I had a weekend where I burned myself out, and now I cannot focus on anything. I'm floating somewhere in a place where my body is not functioning; meanwhile my mind is on overdrive. My brain is rushing back and forth between what most would call rational, analytical realizations, and the emotions are bubbling up from my heart into my head in such a way that they won't be ignored. Earlier I was vicious, tearing apart whatever I could, and getting my usual high from debating, but soon the emotion edged its way in, as it always tries, and this time it refused to be pushed back. Then the power that my intellect had tried to gain (and my ego believed I owned) was lost in a flood of weariness. It's ironic how my self hate can fuel my anger into a fiery mass, and can so quickly turn itself into the tidal wave of hopelessness that douses my rage.
Most will not ever get the chance to understand what I mean. Perhaps some of you who are in the same place right now can see themselves written across this page. It's such a long, intense journey across my mind, and the one thing holding back my flood of tears from your shoulder is the fear of never being able to stop; the fear of my own insanity.
I guess as a starting point, I could share the fact that I got drunk on Saturday. Beyond rationally drunk. I had also gotten drunk on Fri, so that might have contibuted to my haziness. I do not remember Saturday...if I try my hardest, I can see flashes of meaningless dips in the evening: wondering if I could walk along the big dipper, shivering against the cold of the wet grass, and feeling so very alone. The alone part is not reserved strictly for my drunken state, however. That accompanies me whereever I go, and seems most glaring in the presence of other people, both depressed and joyous.
I was with one other person that night. Somebody who I trusted, and I ""knew"" would keep me safe. Unfortunately, that person was not the strong will that I'd believed in. He took the opportunity of me being close to limp, and I would have never known had it not been for another friend coming to check up on me. Now I know what it is to wish for straightforwardness. For honesty the first time around. But most of all, for trust. Right now I cannot trust in myself, and I'd hoped that I could at least trust in those dear to me, but I seem to have a lot of false wallpapers printed up for my security (or perhaps INsecurity?). No, he did not go far, and no, I was not physically hurt. But I have to ask, is that what matters? Because I've had so many bruises laid upon me over time by others and by myself, but none of them have shown up on my skin. I carry and nurture every single one until they will finally swallow me up. Writing and thinking used to be my release, but now it feels as though it's a cheerleader, pushing me towards the final yard in which I will choose the easy, cowardly way out. But do you think this stops me? No, rather I've become obsessed with it, because at least inside this bubble of pain I feel I have a grasp on where I am. It keeps me from floating away, and from getting lost inside myself. It gives me the attention I crave, if nothing else. 
He said he was sorry, and I believe he is, for I know his situation off by heart, do I not? A drunk or a child, they are the same. I know that I am a child, drunk or not. I can't seem to leave my childish wants even when I am sober. I couldn't help it, I blew up at him. My pain was eager to rush forward and scald him, but luckily I drew it back before too much damage was done. It is not he that has stripped me of my worth, and it is not he who has backed me into a quivering heap in the corner. It is many who have contributed to this, perhaps me being the worst, for I cannot seem to let go. He unknowingly opened the floodgates. 
Kirsten...God, I know where you are, or at least where you will be once you can articulate it. And I hope on everything I have that I will stay and listen as long as you need it, and not make any more excuses. Perhaps I have always known, but I was too high on myself to really let you and your dear ones vent without self-pity. Maybe the only light of hope is that your assailant is still here. That is why everything of mine dumped on he from Saturday night. He is the only one left to carry the weight of the others. Shame on me for letting the weight slide...for not catching it sooner.
It's hard, because when somebody touches me now, whether I want it or not, I have to think two or three times if I have the right to say no. I mean, it's senseless, because I've been taught, I KNOW that I do have the right. But do I really FEEL that I do? It's totally different: to know your rights and to feel your rights. I have so much trouble saying no, and I will tell why I feel this may be so. Keeping in mind that this is only a piece. I have been letting down people in all areas of my life for the last year, or perhaps more. It comes and goes. I am the Pleaser, the Debater, the Curious One, the Analytical One, the Fixer. I can narrow anybody down to a nail if I try, and believe me, I do try. If something new comes in, I store it in my database, and revise it for later reference. I have become a machine, for if I allow myself to dip into my pool of feelings, I may fall in and drown. The one person I cannot pinpoint is myself. It frustrates me, God does it ever. I used to have myself down on paper, without any need for erasing. My motivation has gone down along with my self-worth, and I wonder how it did so when I was flying so high. Maybe too high? I decided to actually be honest with myself. I looked back through my journals, and I went back through my memories, and promised myself I would not screen anything, as I was not out to please anybody. I wanted the truth. What I realized were the times in my life that I have been truly happy with who I was. I came up with a surprising answer. Before the age of five, and grade 10. That is it. Those are the only times that I thought things were looking up, and the only times I wasn't thinking about how easily it would be to end my life. How much easier it would make other's lives as well. 
Anyhow, I am wandering: back onto topic. The point is, when I am most happy, that is when my mind chooses to fall the farthest. There is something inside me that will not let me be happy. So I make myself happy by making others happy. By being the Pleaser to avoid conflict. By being the Curious One, therefore making others feel worth something. By being the Analytical One, so that I can find any part of me that may shine badly on another Part, such as the Pleaser, therefore interfering. By being the Fixer, so I can fix myself and other people, which is also the most obsessive Part of me. By being the Debater, so that I can smooth over any problems that the Others can't seem to change. Come to think of it, all of those are obsessive. I have a very obsessive, addictive personality. I can't seem to break out of any cycle I start into. It begins to rule me to the point of exhaustion. It was that way with doing well, it's become that way of now doing badly, and it's starting to become that way with substance abuse. By substance, I not only mean shrooms and alchohol, but also fooling around sexually with many males my age.
And while I really don't want to do what I do with those males, I grit my teeth and bare it, often even initiating it, because I know it will make THEM happy. This is how I will myself into many things. Because I know that if history is any clue, I will never be happy. So the least I can do is make others happy. And since I keep failing with everything else, my body seems my last resort to please people. I don't even feel what I'm doing. I often act when they want to see my own pleasure, and I sometimes wonder what they would do if they knew that all I was thinking inside was: ""Get in, get the job done, make sure they're happy, pretend you are, and for gosh sake's, remember that tomorrow they want you to act as if nothing's happened!"" It becomes a horrible cycle because while I'm happy knowing they are, at the same time I know I am just a body. I know I am being used, I feel guilty, but I can't seem to stop it from happening again.
So as you can see (or maybe you just think I'm insane by now), I have a hard time believing I have the right to say no. I have caused a lot of pain within others, and I am just trying to make it right by helping others feel better in any way I can.
This is the longest entry of anything I've ever written thus far...someday I will take pieces and phrases and make it into something worthwhile, like a poem or a song. For now, however, it feels good to take three months of circular thoughts and put them down where maybe someday somebody will care enough to read them through.
And now, my friends, I am TRULY drained. Good night.</b>"

Yes, I'm quite chipper at the moment, which doesn't happen too much these days (at least not genuinely...I've perfected my acting, heheh). 
  Last night was a blur: I had a little too much to drink (okay, a LOT too much) and I'm getting my friends to fill in for me what the heck we actually did for the four-five hours out in the freezing cold. Turns out we did nothing, as usual! Don't worry, I'm not proud of myself, I'm quite disgusted, but I seem to have become addicted to socializing, and the only time I feel free of worry and self-hate is when I'm on drugs (har har, and I used to be the biggest anti-drug advocate on Earth. Yeah, laugh it up all of you who predicted my hypocracy).
  Anywho, everything feels foggy, and like I am having to reach into the bottom of a full barrel to find each word that is going towards forming a comprehensible phrase. Wow, was that wordy or what?! I think I need to work on that...*sigh* I'm not a geek, noooo siree-bob!

I Caught Fire: The Used

Seemed to stop my breath my head on your chest waiting to cave in, from the bottom of my...
hear your voice again could we dim the sun and wonder where we've been maybe you and me so kiss me like you did my heart stopped beating such a softer sin, I'm melting in your eyes I lost my place could stay a while and I'm melting in your eyes like my first time that I caught fire just stay with me lay with me now. Never caught my breath every second I'm without you I'm a mess ever know eachother trust these words are stones why cuts aren't healing learning how to love I'm melting in your eyes I lost my place could stay a while I'm melting in your eyes like my first time that I caught fire just stay with me lay with me now, you can stay and watch me fall and of course I'll ask for help, we could take our heads off lay in bed just make love that's all."

"event","well i pretty much killed mine and haley's friendship the night before last and as horrible as this may sound, I am just fine with that, the hard part is going to be finding new frineds, i have grown away from everyone and it really hurts, im not very good at making new friends and i just lost about 3/4 of the ppl i know. i think im going to be ok... something that has been really bothering me lately is these ppl i miss, i miss lauren, i miss brittany, i miss jaycie, taylor, and i miss SARA, i talked to her last night and it went well, she hates it there and i wish that she could move back here, its so hard without them, we have all grown apart and i have no one to run to, i just want to know that they are there, the last time i talked to haley she told me that the reason all my friends are leaving me is bc i push them away but i dont understand why... im just not sure if i should believe her because now she hates me. well thats all i have to say, mothing is hitting right now except for the fact that i know some friends that are hurting and they wont let me in, they wont talk to me, my dramatic moods are over im tired of trying to be the center of attetion, i realized it was wrong and im sorry, well just so you know i am here for you and i want to help, i love you all........"

"event","Hey I just wanted you to know that I love you a freakin ton and youre strong enough to pull through all of this with wisdom to help the next person coming down your path. You arent ever alone! Remember: True happiness is felt when we help others. Thats seriously true. When you spend your time helping others and making them smile its really rewarding and fun and makes YOUR heart smile. And I know youre good at it. The happy you IS NOT FAKE. Its just a different part of you. A part of you that you just cant seem to be right now because situations call for the other Aprils gaurds and protections and walls and all that. But dont say youve been fake just because you were happy and bubbly when maybe you didnt really want to be. Thats going to make you feel crappy knowing you were ""fake"" ... and it isnt true! You were just trying to be positive, you were being strong and trying to change things, you were trying to make them better, and you were trying to make other people happy when you probably werent. And, it made you happier to see them happy... didnt it? Sure it did! Just believe in yourself April. I know I believe in you!

I LOVE YOU!!!!!

"event","wow they really do care, my friends, ive been trying to get attention in all the wrong ways, ive screwed up so bad, where is my faith and what have i come to? they really did see what i was doing and they knew there was something wrong, damn im coming off of this crazy high and hitting rock bottom, this is the worst feeling ive felt in months, you know you are right it is getting outta hand but i cant do this on my own, ive felt so alone and its killing me, the scars, the tears, where is the faith god help me... yet how can i say that and not get struck for the hypocracy, to half of the ppl that think they know me i seem like a church-going christian girl, the other half doesnt know whether to think that i am stoned, pathetic, desperate or straight up crazy, the truth is no one knows me,sure i will tell a few ppl a secret but no one knows exactly the same stuff, i dont deserve them and ive truly failed this time, im in way above my head and i cant do this anymore, im a liar, a cheater, a hypocrite and im pretty sure that if you asked me my own name that i wouldnt even know anymore, its gone. I owe a huge apology to everyone and i cant do this to these ppl that love me anymore, when im mad i do things to scare them, when im hurt i push them away from me, when im scared i deny everything that they ask about, when im trying to be positive i overexagerate to get attention, i want to show them who the real me is but the truth is that i have no clue who that could be, who am i and why have i done this? i need serious help. i dont know where to start and i need a way. someone help me, i know i cant do it on my own...

The Used- All that Ive Got
So deep, that it didn't even bleed and catch me
Off guard, red handed
Now I'm far from lonely
I sleep, I still see you lying next to me
So deep that it didn't even bleed and catch me I...

I need something average
Someone please just give me
Hit me and knock me out
And let me go back to sleep
I can't laugh
All I want inside I still am empty
So deep that it didn't even bleed and catch me I...

I'll be just fine
Pretending I'm not
I'm far from lonely
And it's all that I've got

I'll be just fine
Predenting I'm not
I'm far from lonely
And it's all that I've got

I guess, I remember every glance you shot me
Un-harmed, I'm losing weight and some body heat
Eyes closed so hard
I stopped your heart from beating
So deep that I didn't even scream f**k me, I..

I'll be just fine
Pretending I'm not
I'm far from lonely
And it's all that I've got

I'll be just fine
Predenting I'm not
I'm far from lonely
And it's all that I've got

And it's all that I've got
Yeah, it's all that I've got
It's all that I've got
It's all that I've got!

So deep that it didn't even bleed and catch me
So deep that I didn't even scream f**k me

I'll be just fine
Pretending I'm not
I'm far from lonely
and it's all that I've got

I'll be just fine
Pretending I'm not
I'm far from lonely
And it's all that I've got

And it's all that I've got
Yeah, it's all that I've got"

So if you are reading this you probably have no clue about what I am about to talk about, but two of you do and lets keep it down to that small number of people...
recently she left me shes gone and now im empty, shes far away and cant come back shes the one last piece that i do lack, the counselors tell me to be strong, to know who i am and not be afraid, but thats kind of hard when you are in my position, if i was to say half of the things on my mind id lose you all, though there are only about 15 friends that i can recall ,they have all left me! i know i know, "" April, what has happened to the fun-loving,optistic,happy,pretty girl,"" the truth is that she was never here, she's a freaking mask that i put on to hide the bad,lately more and more of that unmasked person has been showing, the people that say they care about me have faded oh so much, yeah its scary but ive gotten used to being scared, the people that i trust, i try to keep them close because there is no one else there, it hurts so bad and life is so perilous, but I'll just admit it , times like this make realize how much life is full of hate and lust, wow the temptations, i need someone to tell me they love me and tell me its ok, come on i am desperate, i wanna be loved.


oh i really like natalie imbruglia, i have since i was like 7 but now i understand the lyrics to her songs, love them!

Everybody's been in my face
Left of the Middle  

Had a dream 
Had a drowning dream I was in a river of pain 
Only difference this time 
I wasn't calling out your name yeah! 
Has it ended before it's begun 
You hold on 
And I try to run but 

Anybody heading in my direction 
Away from the city 
Anybody wanna change the way they feel 
step inside 
Doesn't really matter where you wanna take me 
Away from the city 
I wanna start again 
I wanna start again 
A wanna take it back 
I wanna start again 
Start again 

Funny how those friends forget you when you tired of their games 
You miss a show or a party that blows 
And they've forgotten your name, yeah 
And you wonder what you've become 
They pull you back when you try to run 

Well anybody heading in my direction 
Away from the city 
Anybody wanna change the way they feel 
Step inside 
Doesn't really matter where you wanna take me 
Away from the city 
I wanna start again 
I wanna start again 
A wanna take it back 
I wanna start again 
Start again 

I left the me I used to be 
I wanna see this through 
Left the me I used to be 
If only you'd see it too 
Well I wonder what you've become 
You pull me back when I try to run 

Well anybody heading in my direction 
Away from the city 
Anybody wanna change the way they feel 
Step inside 
Doesn't really matter where you wanna take me 
Away from the city 
I wanna start again 
I wanna start again 
A wanna take it back 
I wanna start again 
Start again

Smoke by NATALIE IMBRUGLIA
Left of the Middle  

My Lullaby, hung out to dry 
What's up with that 
It's over 
Where are you dad 
Mum's lookin' sad 
What's up with that 
It's dark in here 

Why, bleeding is breathing 
You're hiding underneath the smoke in the room 
Try, bleeding is believing 
I used to 

My mouth is dry 
Forgot how to cry 
What's up with that 
You're hurting me 
I'm running fast 
Can't hide the past 
What's up with that 
You're pushing me 

Why, bleeding is breathing 
You're hiding underneath the smoke in the room 
Try, bleeding is believing 
I used to 
I used to 

Why, bleeding is breathing 
You're hiding underneath the smoke in the room 
Try, bleeding is believing 
I saw you crawling on the floor 
Why, bleeding is breathing 
You're hiding underneath the smoke in the room 
Try, bleeding is believing 
I saw you crawling on the floor 
Why, bleeding is breathing 
You're hiding underneath the smoke in the room 
Try, bleeding is believing 
I saw you crawling on the floor 




 only NINE INCH NAILS

I'm becoming less defined as days go by
Fading away (you might say) I'm losing focus
Kind of drifting into the abstract in terms of how I see myself
Sometimes I think I can see right through myself

Less concerned about fitting in to the world
Your world that is, because it doesn't really matter anymore
None of this really matters anymore

Yes I am alone, but then again I always was, as far back as I can tell
I think maybe it's because, because you were never real to begin with
I just made you up to hurt myself, and it worked. Yes it did

There is no you, there is only me
There is no fucking you, there is only me, only

Well the tiniest little dot caught my eye
And it turned out to be a scab
And I had this funny feeling
Like I just knew it's something bad
I just couldn't leave alone

And I kept picking at that scab
Like it was a doorway trying to seal itself shut
But I climbed through

And now I'm somewhere I am not supposed to be
And I can see things I know I really shouldn't see
Now I know why and now I know why
Things aren't as pretty on the inside

There is no fucking you, there is only me, only

Is this really all there is?
Is this really all there is?

Title: I'm Not Okay (I Promise)

Well if you wanted honesty, that's all you had to say
I never want to let you down or have you go
It's better off this way
For all the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
Remember when you broke your foot 
From jumping out the second floor

I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out

What will it take to show you that it's not the life it seems
(I'm not okay)
I've told you time and time again
You sing the words but don't know what it means
To be a joke and look
Another line without a hook
I held you close as we both shook for the last time
Take a good hard look

I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out

Forget about the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
You said you'd read me like a book
But the pages are all torn and frayed

I'm okay
I'm okay
I'm okay, now
(I'm okay, now)

But you really need to listen to me
Because I'm telling you the truth
I mean this, I'm okay
(Trust me)

I'm not okay
I'm not okay
Well, I'm not okay
I'm not o-fucking-kay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
(Okay)"

"event","I was supposed to go to Austin this weekend but I didn't get to cuz stupid bobby didnt get around to it so im pretty much annoyed by that and I feel alone, whatever. I am bored and listening to music, here are some songs of the day:
 
  ""Brackish""



She is not scared to die 
The best things in life drive her to cry 

Crucify then learn 
{Take so much away from inside you 
Makes no sense, you know he can't guide you 
He's your fucking shoulder to lean on 
Be strong} 
Sit and watch me burn 
{Take so much away from inside you 
Makes no sense, you know he can't guide you 
He's your fucking shoulder to lean on 
Be strong} 

She's led to believe 
That it'll be OK 
Look at your face 
Scarred in dismay 
But times have changed 
And so have you 
I think I'd rather 

Crucify than learn 
{Take so much away from inside you 
Makes no sense, you know he can't guide you 
He's your fucking shoulder to lean on 
Be strong} 
Sit and watch me burn 
{Take so much away from inside you 
Makes no sense, you know he can't guide you 
He's your fucking shoulder to lean on 
Be strong} 

I'd like to take you down 
And show you deep inside 
My life, my inner working of smell 
And lack of inner pride 
To touch upon the surface 
Is not for what it seems 
I take away my problems 
But only in my dreams 

Take so much away from inside you 
Makes no sense, you know he can't guide you 
He's your fucking shoulder to lean on 
Be strong 

Take so much away from inside you 
Makes no sense, you know he can't guide you 
He's your fucking shoulder to lean on 
Be strong

Torn
Left of the Middle  

I thought I saw a man brought to life 
He was warm 
He came around like he was dignified 
He showed me what it was to cry 
Well you couldn't be that man I adored 
You don't seem to know 
Seem to care what your heart is for 
But I don't know him anymore 
There's nothing where he used to lie 
My conversation has run dry 
That's what's going on 
Nothing's fine I'm torn 

I'm all out of faith 
This is how I feel 
I'm cold and I am shamed 
Lying naked on the floor 
Illusion never changed 
Into something real 
I'm wide awake 
And I can see 
The perfect sky is torn 
You're a little late 
I'm already torn 

So I guess the fortune teller's right 
Should have seen just what was there 
And not some holy light 
Which crawled beneath my veins 
And now I don't care 
I had no luck 
I don't miss it all that much 
There's just so many things 
That I can touch I'm torn 

I'm all out of faith 
This is how I feel 
I'm cold and I am shamed 
Lying naked on the floor 
Illusion never changed 
Into something real 
I'm wide awake 
And I can see 
The perfect sky is torn 
You're a little late 
I'm already torn 
Torn 

There's nothing where he used to lie 
My inspiration has run dry 
That's what's going on 
Nothing's right I'm torn 

I'm all out of faith 
This is how I feel 
I'm cold and I am shamed 
Lying naked on the floor 
Illusion never changed 
Into something real 
I'm wide awake 
And I can see 
The perfect sky is torn 

I'm all out of faith 
This is how I feel 
I'm cold and I'm ashamed 
Bound and broken on the floor 
You're a little late 
I'm already torn 
Torn..

Playground school bell rings - again
Rain clouds come to play again
Has no one told you she's not breathing?
Hello, I'm your mind giving you someone to talk to
Hello

If I smile and don't - believe
Soon I know I'll wake from this dream
Don't try to fix me I'm not broken
Hello, I'm the lie living for you so you can hide
Don't cry

Suddenly I know I'm not sleeping
Hello, I'm still here
All that's left of yesterday"

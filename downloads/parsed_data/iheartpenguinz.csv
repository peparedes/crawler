i wonder if he is ok. he has been really depressed lately and nothing i say or do can help him. it makes me sad. he still talks and is upbeat most of the time he just kind of doesnt care about anything anymore. which hurts cause he used to say he cared about me. im worried. he does stupid stuff when he is depressed. pray for him"

He neve stops. It gives him too much pleasur. God is not waiting to bless us after our troubles en, He is blessing us right now, in and through those trouble. At this exact moment, He is blessing us right now, in and through those troubles. At this exact moment, he is giving us what he thinks is good."

"event","i recently found my old diaries and discovered i am a weird kid. but i was so much more.....on fire i guess. i mean i still love God and want his will for my life but then i was more in touch with him on a personal level. i talked to him or about him like i did my best friend. i talked about wanting to do stuff for him all the time. i want to be like that again. but also going through these diaries i found some memories i would have liked to never visit again. stuff i had blocked out for a reason but they are back now and i dont know what to do with them"

"event","life is so weird sometimes. you never know what can happen. God must be busy because something new is always going on. right now. nothing bad. and i like it. too bad i never remember to tell God thank you. when everything is rough and i am depressed i somehow remember to ask God for help. blame him for the problems yes but i do ask for help. then things go good and he gets no credit. isnt he just as much in charge ofthe good as he is the bad?? so yea. thank you God for giving me life that i may enjoy living for you. thank you for the freedom that i can do that without fearing for my life. thank you for the blessings you bestow on me everyday taht i never take the time to thank you for. i thank you for them now."

"event","ok i hadnt acctually read the comments on this thing but now i feel a little better knowing there are people praying for me. I think i have been pretty stresed lately there is just too much going on. not to mention this stupid brain thing. but going through this medical stuff makes you see who your real friends are. like some of them you tell them you have it and they ask if you could die and you tell them yes and they say ""oh. well did you hear that jesi and steven broke up"" i mean i dont want them to be all depressed over it i just want them to sympathize or pretend to for like half a second. and then there is the stuff that happened with my dad on saturday that kinda sucked but i am ok. i havent done anything stupid in a few weeks despite all the stress"

"event","it amazes me how much it can hurt sometimes. ya know. i write this hear because i know nobody reads it. i have complained about so much to people that now there is no choice but to put on a happy face. i have awesome friends that leave me as soon as they find ""the one"" and i am left again dealing with everyone elses problems. trying to hide my own. i feel so selfish for wanting the attention of someone. everyone that i have been close to is either gone or will be in the near future. and i am left to work it out on my own. i try my best to help them and give tehm advice and they always find and get what they want through it. but what about what i want. when will someone make sure i get that. when will someone care enough. sense i cannot fufill my own happiness i see toit that everyone around me reaches that thing for which they have been aiming. though it is my doing i cannot help but regret when it happens. i leave myself in the dust. 
i was watching a show on cutting and was amazed at how rational it sounded. this girl was talking aboutwhy she cut and why it was ok and every word made sense to me. she talked about how maybe the reason she cant stop is because she doesnt want to. scars give a sense of accomplishment, with emotional pain you cant say a specific it hurts right here because of this exact thing. with cutting you can say it hurts rigt here on my arm because of this cut. it is a pain that you can control and nobody can inflict on you."

"event","the pain has become so deep
over my head
drowning me in my own tears
tears of blood 
that scare teh world away
nobody wants to see
what they have done
to someone like me.
so they leave me
with blood on my face
all alone. 
it cant be much longer
before this passes. 
they tell me all wounds heal with time
but time stands still
wounds deepen
pain grows
people leave
we are worse than when we started."

So much has happened and we have been super busy.We are getting ready to go home on block leave in a couple weeks, so lots to do to prepare for that. A friend of mine took on the Mayor's position for our area. She stopped and wanted to know if I wanted to assist her as Vice Mayor and I told her I would. I swore after doing it at Ft Benning that I would never do it again, but here it goes. I finally quit all the Girl Scout BS. It's amazing some of the things you find out after not being involved. It turns out that all of the crazy bs thats going on in GS with 90% of the troops is brought on by our Service Unit Manager. It seems she loves gossip and spreading rumors and when their is a small problem she adds alot of fuel to the fire. I guess thats why alot of the leaders are quitting. Why am I such a bad judge of character? I thought she was great, but boy was I wrong! LOL So, I quit GS and joined the Mayors. I go from one thing to the next.</FONT></EM></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><EM><FONT color=#3366ff>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One more thing to add, I swear if I hit a slot in Vegas I am taking my money and buying a ticket to Alaska. I'm coming up there and am going to whoop that fat ass bitches ass.LOL&nbsp;She is such a miserable person and isn't happy unless she makes everyone else miserable. The more I think about it the madder I get. To mess with me is one thing, but to mess with my friends is another. She will get whats coming to her.</FONT></EM></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><EM><FONT color=#3366ff>&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyways, so Amanda made the squad, so after we get back from leave I will be doing alot of running for her. She has a new boyfriend and I really like this one, a nice boy, but he is gone for the summer so she is pretty bored.</FONT></EM></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><EM><FONT color=#3366ff>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday, Steph and I took the kids and went shopping. We hit Birdy Jo's, Dairy Queen, the outlet Malls and Wal Mart. Then swung by Tara's to pick up a load of candles for my party on Monday. Roni had Mikayla stay all night and I hear that they are up now, so I am going to wrap this up and get ready for another busy day!</FONT></EM></STRONG></P>"

"event","This weekend was great! Why did Monday have to roll around? Friday was Roni's field trip, which I was dreading. Not that I didn't want to go with her, but because my fellow GS leader was going to be there, and I had to sit and listen to her talk about everybody and their brother. I know she is talkin shit about me, but its a situation I feel like I can't do anything about and just hope that people will see her for the person she is. She is very treacherous and shes the type if you approach her in a nice way, she will turn everything around and gets chain of command involved and all. So, I'll continue to play her lil game until GS is over with. It's just not me to sit back put a smile on and pretend nothing is wrong. Uggh! Just had to vent!
   Anyhow, Saturday, we went to V'ville and finished Roni's B'day shopping and spent way too much money. Scott took me out to the Roadhouse Grill for dinner and a stop at DQ on the way home. 
  Yesterday for Mothers Day he was just a sweetheart, he did everything. God, I love that man! Steph and Mikayla came over to go swimming in the pool and thats about it in a nutshell. 
   Guess I better go get my butt in gear. Scott's in class today, getting trained to be the person who gives the urinalysis. Sounds fun huh????

   We went today and got started on Roni's B'day. I found the paper outlet and got all of her plates, cups, pinata all the good stuff to start out with. We are going to go with the Disney Princesses this yr. I don't remember what we did last year, it might have been the same thing, but oh well. I have a lady who has been buying candles off of me who is a professional cake decorator, so I am going to have her make the cake to match everything. Now I just need to figure out what to buy her. UGGH!
   After all that we went over to Victorville and hit Wally World. I need to stay away from there, I always spend too much money. Then we finished up the day with a wonderful dinner from The Outback.
   Well, I think I am going to go clean out the pool and put some chlorine in. Get ready for next week, so I can lay out on my new raft. TTFN"

   Kristy's party went well and then we had a lil get together afterwards. It was fun. Nice to get out of the house for a while. 
   Well, I am off to bed, just thought I would do a quick update because I need to start getting on here more often."

   After we do the party, we are staying for a BBQ and Steph and Simon are coming. It will be fun! I guess Scott and Si are loading up the 4 wheelers tomorrow and going riding, they better make it back in time for the BBQ since it seems like Kristy is going all out!
  Same old drama and bullshit with Girl Scouts! God I cannot wait to get it over with. I have never seen a more cut throat, malicious, vendictive person than the one I am dealing with. I just want to get it over with! Too bad I didn't go off my first impression with this one, but oh well.Lessons learned!

"event","Gosh It's been awhile since I last updated. So, much has been going on. The kids spring break is almost over and we have tried to stay busy. Scott's mom came to visit with his niece for a few days and that went pretty good. My candles have been selling really well also. I was always complaining about being bored, now I just wish I had 5 minutes to sit down. 
    We went to Vegas and toured yesterday. What an amazing place. I can't wait for my mom to get here and take her there, but who knows when she'll be coming out. We got our plane tickets to go home for June over max leave and my grandmother got out of the hospital, so I need to go home and see her. She is really excited to see us. They sold the flower shop, so I guess everyone is upset about that.
   I talked to Kristy today and told her we need to plan a trip to go to the Price is Right. MWR is taking a bus there and also to Hollywood, so if I can fit it into my schedule it would be great. We may start going to the gym next week also.
     Next week is going to be super busy! I have a field trip to take Roni's class on Thursday and another on Friday, then Friday night I'm having a Home Interior party and Saturday we have to take the girl scouts out for camporee. Which I still need to make a tribal flag for. So Sunday I am going to run to Barstow to pick up a load of candles and I have a party booked for Monday and another on the first. Wow! Doesn't even sound like me. Oh well at least I am keeping busy.Gonna go sit down and relax for now."

We had a blast and Amanda was having so much fun. We stopped and had dinner at Arby's and then came home and Steph and Simon came over. They stayed till after midnight and Roni had her first sleepover. Mikayla stayed with her all night and she was so excited. 
   Today was Gorgeous so I layed out on the trampoline and tried to get rid of my Casper look after being in Alaska for a year. My face got sunburned though.I need to get rid of these white legs. I'm hoping the weather will stay like this now, it is so beautiful out.
   Thats about all thats new here. Getting ready for my Passion Party next weekend, hope to have as good of a turnout for it as I did the candles."

"event","<DIV>Just thought I'd fill y'all in on Roni! Saturday she hit her elbow on the Trampoline and Sunday morning I took her to the ER. After sitting there for 4 hrs and Amanda passing out, they send her home because no X-rays will be given on the weekends and I go back to X-Ray on Monday. They see a small fracture and put her arm in a sling and send her on her way. While I was waiting in Xray, I filled out a comment card at how rediculous it is that we are such an isolated post and are unable to get the proper care we need. A representative from the hospital called me back and she said she would investigate because she didn't understand why if she had a fracture, they would just giver her a sling.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think they were then trying to cover their as&amp;*es because they jumped right to everything and ordered a catscan and then finally today they put a 1/2 cast on her. The fracture was small but right by the growth plate and he wanted to protect it from any further damage, because if she hurt it again, it could effect her later on down the rd.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sorry about the ramble, but then people wanna know why I have to be on my death bed before I go to the hospital. I have never received such a runaround.!</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then last night we had our girl scout leaders meeting. The one girl that I thought was so nice really floored me. She comes to the meeting and doesn't like Christina our leader so she starts attacking her viciously with words and such childish acts, I&nbsp;wouldn't have believed it unless I saw it with my own eyes.She told me today that she just wanted Christina out because she didn't like her and the sad part is she doesn't even know her, but she was being so hateful to her that she was trying to get her to quit. This is the type of person we want as a GS leader? So, today I let her have it with both barrels. I said she acted in a way that I wouldn't have expected my teenager to act and I was very disappointed in her actions. So, I guess I probably pissed her off. I don't know what the problem is with her, but I hope I never have to deal with that shit again, because if I had been Christina I would have knocked her on her fuckin ass for the way she was behaving. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other than that, my first candle party is done and over, My total sales were $533. and two bookings.

He comes home yesterday morning and goes to Victorville to buy a 4 wheeler. Well, when he gets home he has bought 2. The one(mine) was in the back of the truck and he got them to deliver the other today. I don't think I've ever seen him this happy. I am happy for him. Scott is the kind of husband that will buy, buy, buy for everyone but himself, so it was so good to see him actually get something hes been wanting and once again he was thinking of all of us. He said it wouldn't be much fun to take one out and go ride because 2 of us would be left out, so he bought the second one so that we could all go out. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I really hate like hell having to make the payment, but we have the money now to do what we want so its about time for him to get something he wanted.</P>

"event","<P><EM>The start of another week. This weekend really flew by, even though Scott was in the field. I took the kids to Barstow on Saturday and got Roni's haircut. In a way I hated to cut it. It was clear down her back, but it was so hard to get a brush through it and she is really to young to take care of it herself, so now she has the Lizzie Maguire look, at least thats what she called it. Then Sat. night I took the girls to see Cheaper By The Dozen. It was a really cute movie.</EM></P>
<P><EM>&nbsp;Yesterday, Amanda wanted to get her hair done, so we went back. She had a reverse frosting done and a whole new cut. She looks so pretty. The only thing I don't like is it makes her look older and god only knows we don't need that. She was tickled with it though. I think it really made her week. So, the girls got a couple new outfits to sport with their new haircut.They are ready for school, except I don't think Roni is feeling good at all. Shes running a bit of a fever and tossed her cookies Sat night and hasn't felt good since.</EM></P>
<P><EM>&nbsp;&nbsp; Tonight is our first GS meeting. We'll see how this is going to go. The girl thats doing it with me doesn't seem to enthused about doing anything with it and I just hope I don't get stuck with it all again, like last time. I have prepared the entire meeting and printed off all the papers for the girls, ran to V'ville to get the uniform to show the parents and all. She called last night and said she was sorry that she didn't call this weekend, she knew we were supposed to get together to plan this thing, but shes been really busy. Like I haven't????? Oh well, I knew this when I decided to do it, so I'll suck it up and if I have to do it all myself I guess I will. I know I've got some good people that are signing up their kids, so I know they'll help. Ok, I've rambled enough, gotta get busy!</EM></P>"

He came home last night and applied for credit through Honda&nbsp; and he got approved for quite a bit, so now he's contemplating on buying 2. LOL The payment wouldn't be too much and he wants something that we can all go do. Only thing is, if he even buys just one, it won't fit in the back of the truck with the camper top on. So, he's debating on that. We found a nice trailor here on post from a guy who's PCS'ing to Korea, so I told him I'm stepping out of this one. It's going to be his decision.

Now that I am finally getting my life back and starting to get out I had to start writing things down on the calendar so I wouldn't forget.I took Steph over to Barstow to pick up her carpet and &nbsp;My background check finally came back, so now I am approved to be a volunteer for the schools. Only to find out that now that I'm going to be a girl scout leader, I have to go through the whole background check and fingerprinting again. What a Waste of money!!!! Thank God its not mine, but I just had this done 2 weeks ago, you would think they could use the same clearance, but NO not here at Irwin!&nbsp; Oh well, I got to go in and volunteer for Roni's Valentine party today. She was so excited and now wants me there all the time. Bless her heart. She asked me if I was going to be able to stay with her at Girl Scouts and I had to sit down and explain to her that I was gonna be kinda like her teacher, so I had to be there.She got even more excited.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>&nbsp;Tomorrow is a day to get the laundry caught up and clean house, then Friday my Gold Canyon kit comes in so I need to go pick it upand that evening I told Steph I'd go to a Mary Kay party with her. Saturday is our ball and then Sunday I have training for Girl Scouts. So, I guess in a way its good I'm keeping busy.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>We just got done watching American Idol and The OC. God, I love that show. Amanda and I make a date every Wednesday to watch The OC . Crystal called right at the end and I waited till it was over to call her back and by that time it was just starting in Alaska so she was watching it. LOL Are we a bunch of OC addicts?

We left early Friday morning and made it there in about 2 1/2 hrs. We checked into the hotel and went and hopped on the trolley and went to downtown SanDiego. We did some shopping at Horton Plaza and walked all over town.Then we went back on base and did some shopping at the NEX. I was bitching at Scott all weekend about getting out of the Navy and going into the Army. The Navy takes such better care of their people. The NEX was more like a huge Dept. Store and the Navy Lodging was only $64 a night with full accomadations.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#990000>&nbsp;&nbsp; We got up Saturday morning, had breakfast and went off to the zoo. The kids had a blast. After spending the majority of the day there, we went to Mission Beach and got to put our feet in the ocean, then took the kids up to the boardwalk and let them ride some rides. We ended the day with a wonderful dinner at Black Angus.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#990000>&nbsp;This morning we got up and drove downtown to the harbor and took some pics of the USS Midway, which is opening up for tours in June. We got some really nice pics of the Navy statues that are scattered everywhere. What a great weekend. Then we come home and Amanda's stalker's dad comes down here and wants to talk to Scott. Thats a whole other story, as soon as we got home we saw him ride his bike by the house and then about 5 houses down we see his dad jerk him off the bike. I swear, I jsut want all this shit to stop!</FONT></P>

It all started with one of the gals planning a playdate for the kids. I came back and said I wanted a play date for me, ME ME ME Damnit! No kids no teens, just me and a couple friends hanging out and having a few drinks.Well, they all fell for it and wanted to go out. Most of you that know me, know that I am a homebody and I'm not much one for going out but we decided to meet up. We had a great time and I think I had one too many drinks. Steph drove cause she wasn't planning on drinking and she ended up getting drunk too, so Scott picked us all up and drove everyone home. Everyone showed up so I was really surprised because noone ever seems to want to get out here, but last night they did! I found out a few interesting things last night. The Army has more gay men than I thought. We met this one guy Peaches who was very open about being gay and he had us all laughing our asses off all night. I have never been around a man that was so open about it, but he was just like hanging out with one of the girls and was a riot! Everything was going great until some asshole came out while we were having a smoke and wouldn't leave me alone. He said his buddy really wanted to meet me and I told him I was very happily married and that didn't seem to bother him. After telling him a few times, Steph finally said ""hey Buddy, Look shes happily married, so I think he took the hint from her. Kinda freaked me out. We closed the bar down and I wasn't feeling to good last night, but this morning my wonderful husband let me sleep in and took Amanda to school. God, I am so thankful to have such a wonderful man, I don't know what I'd ever do without him! I Love You Honey! </EM></STRONG></P>

We were trying to decide on the Zoo or Sea World, so we decided the zoo.Next 4 day we'll try Sea World or Vegas.It seems so weird having so many places to chose from.I feel like a lil kid again. Our income taxes hit today so that will help out in our adventurous weekend of fun.Then I am going to pay off this computer and a couple things. Not too much happened today.Same Old Same Old. Me and Stephanie are going to the outer limits tomorrow night. It's Country Night and we are meeting up with some of the girls from the Ft Irwin group. I need to start meeting more people, but the older I get the more picky I get. It seems like I am always seeing the flaws in people before anything else. I guess that happens when you've been burnt as many times as I have.The biggest person who burnt me is now telling me how much she misses me and what a great &nbsp;friend I was to her and how sorry she is, but its just not that easy to forget. I can be cordial but thats about it.and thats as far as it will ever go, I could never be friends with her again. </FONT></EM></STRONG></P>

Today was warmer than a summer day in Alaska and it felt so good to sit outside and let the sun beam down on my face. Scott had to go into work for a lil while today so I paid bills and got a few things done. I finally got my Valentines flags hung up, I really need to go get some new flags. Most of mine faded in GA, but I'm sure they'll fade even more here.
   I called and ordered my Gold Canyon kit today. Hopefully it will be here by next Friday, so that's going to give me something extra to do. Still debating on the girl scouts.
    We went to Barstow and picked up a few things from Wal Mart and then we went and had dinner at Peggy Sue's 50's Diner. It's a small diner that is on Route 66 that was built in 1954. They expanded it and it has a pizza parlor, and out the back door a really nice place to walk around with little ponds that were supposed to have ducks, but we didn't see any tonight. The food was delicious and on the other side they have a huge gift shop with ton's of memorabilia. Amanda fell in love with the place since she is trying to do her room now in a 50's theme. They had tons of stuff from Marilyn, Elvis, James Dean, I Love Lucy and Gone With The Wind. I love the Gone With The Wind collectables, they were absolutly gorgeous. 
    After that we came  home and Scott and Amanda had a heart to heart. It was really sweet, so now I am off to bed and get some zzzzz's."

I was sitting here painting my nails when the front door flew open and in walked Scott.Apparently he was out in the field yesterday and did something to fix 8 of the B-Fists, so they told him since he did so much to take the night off. Yippee! He worked alot with the B-Fists at Ft Benning and I guess his knowledge paid off out here.
   Today,I got up early, took Amanda to school and off to the district office in Yermo.I picked up the live scan card to have my fingerprinting done and then off to Barstow to hunt down the Police station. Finally, after finding it we had to wait forever to get fingerprinted and then I had to go back to Yermo to drop off the paperwork.In between stops I managed to make a pit stop at Wal Mart! Roni and I got home just in time to pick Amanda up from school and hear all the latest drama thats going on with her, so we decided we were going to the commisary to pick up some groceries before Scott gets home tomorrow.
      Scott informed me last night that he wants to go to San Diego next weekend and take the kids to the zoo,maybe even Sea World, so I need to go to tickets and tours and find out if they have any deals going on. Other than that, thats all the news in the Carl household.I'm exhausted and am off to take a nice hot bubble bath."

Amanda has still been having problems with this boy and I have found out that she has brought alot of it on herself,but he still won't take a hint, so I ended up going to the school after he threatened her in an email. Hopefully it will all be settled now, I just don't know. Amanda is learning at TOO young of an age that even though someone says they are your best friend, it doesn't mean shit when it comes down to it, but thats a whole other story and it pisses me off that I can stand up and say my kids are not perfect, but they have always been good kids and some parents want to point the finger and the parents think their child is an angel.Boy, I found out differently this weekend. It's amazing what you can find when you start snooping. So, hopefully things will have calmed down and this week will be better than last! I am thankful Scott has been in the field, because I don't think he would have handled all of this as well as I did,he probably would have been out hunting down a teenage boy.LOL
       
       Anyhow, I really need to start posting in this journal more often, too much to do. I had to go last week and get  a TB test and then I couldn't find my shot record so I ended up getting a Tetanus and a HepB. Tomorrow I go to get fingerprinted in Barstow and do the background check. All of this to be able to volunteer at the school.Roni has a 100th day party sometime this week, so hopefully I'll be able to go in for that, otherwise she will be devastated. Scott should be done with this rotation on Wednesday. He got to come home last night and it was sooo good to be able to cuddle up with him after the week I had.

     Crystal, I gotta say Thank You for all the late night phone calls helping me get through the week. Tell Eric I'm sorry for taking you away from him, but you have been an angel and a great listener. I love you like a sister and I'll be here for you when you need me!  ~HUGS~"

It is sooo nice to have a movie theatre here on post and be able to see a movie for $1.50. Saturday, I took the kids and met up with Steph again and we all went bowling.We had a great time.
    Today was lazy day.I sat outside and watched the sprinkler as I watered the grass. I stayed around the house waited on the Fed Ex man and my abc stuff came today. I ordered a really nice picture with country apples and an apple plate rack that holds 3 plates with apples and 2 votive holders. They are really nice. I have talked on the phone so much that now my ear hurts. he he he, I talked to Pam last night and got to play catch up with her and then Nina and Crystal. So, by the time Crystal and I got off the phone and I went to bed it was 3 AM. It's nice to have friends that are so far away and yet as much as we talk it seems like they are just a hop away.

I felt bad because I told him I didn't want any pancakes, but he knows I'm not a breakfast person. Give me my coffee and cigarettes and I am good to go! The as I was checking my mail he was cleaning up the house, running the sweeper, dusting.What woman wouldn't be happy to wake up to that. Anyways he went down and did a couple of things to his truck and then we went off to Victorville.
    We went to Petsmart and had every intention of buying a hamster for Roni, but the employees their talked us out of it. They said hamsters are not a good small pet for young children, because they bite and when they bite they bite hard, so he suggested the guinea pig. Well, Roni looked at them and they had a lil Albino one, white with pink eyes and Roni fell in love with him.So, we ended up spending alot more money than expected, but gosh he is adorable.Roni will hold him and he will snuggle in her arm and whistle.I don't think Jack is too crazy about him. Oh and I found out something interesting. Gerbils and ferrets and other certain rodents are outlawed in CA. Why? The guy said because there are some weird people in CA, he asked did u ever hear about Richard Gere. I couldn't believe it! How Gross! Who in their right mind would put a rodent up their ass. YUCK!
   We finished up the evening with a delicious dinner at the Outback,I Love their blooming onions with that sauce. Tomorrow is our 14 year anniversary and my parents mark their 31st at the end of the month, so I bought them a $50 gift certificate to The Outback.Let mom and dad go have dinner and a few drinks on us!"

   My canisters from Cracker Barrel finally arrived yesterday, the UPS man must have heard me cussing him cuz he left them by the door, rang the doorbell and took off running.I mean C'mon I thought UPS was supposed to be faster, but mail is alot faster and less expensive.Anyways, so now I have the complete set and I absolutely love it!
  I think we are heading over to Victorville this weekend. We are going out for our anniversary dinner, just trying to decide where. We never had so many places to chose from. I do need to go to the Outback and get a gift certificate for my parents. Their anniversary is at the end of the month.

I was sitting in here on the computer talking to a new girl I met here and Scott comes in and says""I think you need to go outside"" Well, Amanda was on the phone talking to her friend Jessica and there was a puppy running loose. Well, Jess's mom is an avid animal lover and she said they were going to come down and try to find out who the dog belonged to. They got here and by the time they did, the owners had already come out to get the dog who was being nipped at by a Rott through the fence. Jess wanted to see the pup so they walked behind the house to see where the dog was and I guess it got out again and the owner came out grabbed the dog around the neck and started beating it in the head. The dog was yelping and crying.Jessica came up here crying and Lynn took my phone and called the MP's. What a joke. The guy who was out there cussing Lynn came out and would not cooperate with the MP's at all. They finally made him get to the ground and cuff him, he was being very aggressive and the size of this black guy could have taken those 2 MP's and probably whooped their ass.Well, we were telling the one MP as he was taking the guy away in cuffs that he wasn't the one who beat the dog it was the skinny guy. All he said was ok. In the midst of all of this, the puppy disappeared and the MP's thought that the dog that was beaten was this other mutt in the backyard. We took the girls down to the station to file a complaint and once again we questioned the quiet MP(Dean) about why wasn't the dog beater brought in and where was this pup? No remarks. So, finally the other MP (Nemitz) who took the big guy away came in. We asked him the same questions and he literally blew up at us and the kids. Now, here this guy is a specialist,totally disrespecting the Sgt Maj wife.He said we told them it was the big guy who was beating the dog and he brought in the wrong guy. The girls told him it was the guy in the blue shorts,So he walks out of the room and comes back and starts screaming at 2 13 yr olds. ""Not one of them even have on blue shorts"" He walks out of the room and says under his breath""This is fuckin unbelievable"" Well, come to find out later when the Sgt came on duty, they found out the guy had changed before he came to the station,he said that they were bringing in the puppy and he would look it over for any harm and if he saw none he had to give it back to them, so as they left the rm they forgot to shut the door.We heard the Mp's telling the dog owners that they had a beautiful pup and how they disciplined their dog was up to them, just next time not to do it out in public. UGGH in other words if you are going to beat the hell out of your dog,spouse, child whatever, just don't do it where you can be seen and caught. Totally amazes me. So, we didn't even finish we got up and left. Lynn said she was turning it over to her husband tomorrow and she was going to let him take care of it. She said she has never been one to throw her husbands rank around, which is totally cool about her. She is a very nice lady.Well, that was my day in a nutshell. Why is it that trouble can sometimes always find a way to find me even if I am sitting on the computer minding my own business,LOL"

"event","Well another year has snuck up on us! 2003 was a good year, but also a little sad. I left my family(again) and friends who became like family, to move to another state.Thanks to the Army. I was really glad to leave Alaska, but just hated leaving behind all of our friends. I think 2004 is going to be a great year, it has already started off good. I now have no car payment(thanks to my wonderful grandparents) Scott loves his job, Amanda and Roni love it here and so do I! California is going to be an awesome place to live. I forgot how much I missed the conveniences of shopping and restaurants. 
  Amanda is doing so good, she has always adjusted well, but I was really worried about her when we left Alaska, but she has made friends and is hardly ever at home now. I'm glad in a way considering she never got out much in Alaska unless it was with Sean, but I miss having her around.
   Roni is just Roni! She could make friends with a total stranger and she is such a little blessing to us. God was really looking down when he blessed Scott and I with two great kids!
  As far as Scott goes, we grow closer and closer every day, I am so thankful to have a husband like him. I really don't know what I would do without him. He told me last night that next January he wanted to throw a big party,possibly even go home to celebrate our 15th anniversary. He said he feels that is the biggest accomplishment of his life.Aww how sweet, especially considering people said it wouldn't last 6 months. I guess they are eating their words now. So, bring on 2004,I am ready for just about anything(I think) as long as I have my best friend and my kids beside me."

"event","Well, I guess I will try this thing out. I'm new to all of this. Thanks to Nina for telling me about it.
   This morning started out good. I got up earlier than usual, because Roni had to be at school earlier. Today was my baby's first Christmas program. They all looked so adorable in the little shirts they made. Scott and I were front row and center.Then she got released to come home for the rest of the day. Tomorrow is her Christmas party, so we had to go to the commisary to get some cookies. I miss Amanda doing things like this in school. I looked at Roni up on stage today and I could have cried, because it seemed like only yesterday Amanda was that little. (boo hoo) My baby is growing up. She hasn't been in school here for more than a couple of weeks and the boys are already beating down the door, I'm surprised Scott isn't standing out there with a shotgun!
 I came home cleaned house and the mailman just brought a big box to the door from my parents. I hate not being home for the holidays, but I am thankful that I do have my husband here with me instead of him being on foreign soil. So, Life is Sweet!, Well, guess I'll go see what Santa delivered. Oh, I mean the mailman! Later"

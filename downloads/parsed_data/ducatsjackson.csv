"event","<p>Hello.</p><p>I'm halfway through the Dune miniseries. It's very good so far.</p><p>I'm sorry to have to inform everyone, but music officially sucks now. It's been pretty shitty for a while, but i'll go ahead and announce it: Music Sucks Now. There are just too many walking cliches around now. Too many bands that should have stopped before they started.</p><p>I've been having more seizures. These tend to lead to some pretty righteous dreams. Maybe they are clues to some greater mystery. It hurts like a bitch to come out of them, though.</p><p>Heroes finally came back, but I haven't watched the newest one yet. I'll do that after I finish Dune.&nbsp;<br /><br />People keep telling me to watch Lost, which I would like to do, but i'm already caught up in Heroes, the Sopranos, and the Riches<br />so I don't need to add more to my plate.</p><p>Later.</p><p>R.</p>"

"event","<p>So. Black Snake Moan is pretty much the best fucking movie ever. It was even better than Hustle and Flow, which is a hard act to follow.<br />Wild Hogs hopefully tonight.<br />Purple Rain Movie Night on Tuesday.<br />Bad Dudes on the 16th.<br />Dad bought a new dog. That brings the count up to 4.<br />The Films of Kenneth Anger Vol.1 is out. I'm excited.<br />Jim Goad's Big Book of Sex will be out in about a month. Again, very excited.<br />I'm going to go eat now.<br />R.<br /></p>"

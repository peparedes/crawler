Miyo moments of late:

Tapping on the shoulder - She will tap you to get your attention or just keep tapping you for laughs.

Evil grin - Whenever she's about to do something she knows she shouldn't, she turns her head, looks at you, and smiles. Great early warning system for danger.

Papa point - For some reason, sometimes when she sees me she points and in a loud ""whisper"" says a drawn out and overly-dramatic sounding ""Papppaaaaaaaaa"". It's like I'm a ghost or something. Maybe I've put on enough weight to look scary.

Blinking gestures - Outside my in-laws house they've set up Christmas lights. Now, whenever she sees blinking lights, she'll open and close her hand to simulate the blinking. 

""No"" - She can shake her head ""no"". The ""terrible twos"" might be creeping up soon. 

Bowing - I forgot if I've written this before, but she can bow. Sometimes she keeps her balance.

Separation anxiety - She wakes up a lot more during the night reaching out for mama and mama only. My sleeps ok, but Chi has to sleep with the little monster."

A really cool-looking fruit I got at the department store supermarket. A red dragon fruit, aka Costa Rican pitaya. The taste doesn't quite match its appearance though; it's rather bland."

"event","Miyo is now a little over a year old. I'm not going to sugar-coat it; raising a kid is rough. Doubly so when said kid has no concept of ""stillness"". The first three months were hell - little sleep on top of a job that I'm not exactly in love with. By sixth months, things got slightly easier, but there were always one or two hair-pulling fiestas to each day. From that point on routine and comfort got turned on its head. She moves on from milk to solids, from crawling to walking and grabbing everything within reach (no a dream situation in a tiny apartment with little storage space about 3 feet). She grows fast and there's very little time to catch up. The last stretch until now she has become more independent but at a price; if things aren't her way, then the tears start to fall...loudly.

That said, there still are the moments that keep one in the game: her smiling, laughing face can move mountains (unless said ""face"" is the result of tearing the kitchen apart); the times she speeds over to you because she needs you; the funny things she does like dancing to the happy birthday song. Those moments can feed the stressed parent to push on and are probably the memories that are least likely to get repressed when waxing nostalgic to new parents years later.

It's been a definite roller coaster and not one for the faint of heart or mind. Happiness shines through the stress-lined clouds. It changes everything. Let's see how the next year goes."

"event","I guess this has been a long time coming. I've been busy and the little free time I do get I'm usually busy researching other stuff or going through email, etc. Anyway, here are the most recent milestones:

- Starting to walk - She can walk a few yards by herself(I've really gone metric. I typed ""meters"" first...). If we're holding her hand, she can walk a good five minutes or so until she gets bored. 

- Moving to solids in a major way - She can eat nearly anything if it's in bite-size pieces and soft enough for her. She's been eating a lot of broccoli, pasta, cheese, and apple jello recently.  The others can be hit and miss though. For example, she seems to have gone off rice. Half the time she spits it out. 

- Pointing - She now directs us when she's carrying her by pointing. She can also use it to draw our attention to something. Once I pulled the tap-on-the-opposite-side-of-the-shoulder gag on her but she turned around and pointed to me as if accusing me. Coincidence or just scary smart for a 1 year old? You decide.

- Beginnings of speech - She's had ""mama"" down for a while, but tends to still use it indiscriminately. Everybody and their mama is ""mama"". She can say ""papa"" too, but doesn't use it to call me or address me much yet. Other words she appears to be able to say include ""duck"" and ""doggie"" (she says it in Japanese as ""wan-wan""). ""Duck"" is probably because the duck is her bathroom toy and ""wan-wan"" is because her grandparents here have a dog.

- Drinking by herself - She hasn't taken the bottle by herself yet, but she can drink from a straw cup. She's finally able to use the cup my brother and his fiance got for us. Thanks guys!

- Falling asleep without being held - This is still a work in progress. If we dim the lights, set her in one of our futons and lie down next to her for a while, she'll fall asleep in 15-20 minutes. She's usually rolling around like she's drunk; her head goes up and she teeters forward as if to crawl but slips and falls down face first.  Anyway, better than holding her for that time. 

- Vampire tendencies - For some reason she thinks it's funny to come at us open-mouthed, slobber her saliva on us and bite at will. She hasn't drawn blood so we think she's still human, but she doesn't have all her teeth yet so...

- Likes chasing games - She loves being chased around the apartment. Chi or I have to crawl after her and it's hard on the knees, but it keeps her entertained for a good 20-30 minutes before we get tired. She, on the other hand, seems to have inherited genes from the Energizer bunny somehow - she never stops moving."

There's a butter shortage in Japan. If you go to the supermarket, in it's place are packages of margarine or faux butter. They sell butter pats at our supermarket, but quite expensive for a few small pieces of butter. I guess I'll have to cut down on a lot of my Western recipes. Trying times for the chefs of Japan."

"event","The plastic bag has long since become useless. Music is now currently the most reliable tool to calm Miyo. Rocking her gently back and forth to Japanese kids songs, The Wallflowers (Rebel,Sweetheart), The Wreckers (Stand Still, Look Pretty), or India.Arie (Voyage to India) has been the most effective so far. Opera occasionally works too. The kid's already a bit eclectic.

The Wallflowers ""How Far You've Come"" 

You'd have a wonderful day
If you could see how lucky you are
Now don't get carried away with your heart
You're better where you are

You're not the only one
Who's failed to hang on to a moving star
Now don't be sorry, what's done now is done
And this is who you are

These days feel numbered and long
There's no one to speak of, there's no one at all
But you're not the reason that everyone's gone
That's not how they are

There is no system to change
No conditions are made, no permissions to start
Now don't go drawing lines in the sand
That's not who you are

Sometimes a high wall is just a wall
Sometimes it's only there to make sure you feel small
But maybe that'll save you
From the depths of a much deeper fall

The truth will not set you free
It's okay to believe that you're not good enough
God is not angry, not blind, deaf, or dumb
He knows how far you've come
He knows how far you've come
He knows how far you've come

Yes, an ordinary, supermarket plastic bag. Crinkle this baby in your hand and little Miyo gets hours of entertainment.

<a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2008/2/20/201332/807/36/458633"">A blog entry on the Daily Kos</a> I recently came across on ""Stumble!"" may have solidified my support for Obama. The author did some research on bills past in the Senate and compares the records of both Barack and Hillary. According to what she's come across, it illustrates that Obama's bills are able to garner greater support and address issues on a grander scale that those of Clinton. 

On several bills Clinton was unable to get co-sponsors where Obama was able to on his. In addition, it appears he was also able to pass more bills successfully than she was. I haven't had time to fact check it myself, but the entry is definitely worth a look (it includes links to the Library of Congress from where she did her research)."

-- We've moved up to S size diapers to contain all her poop (could use this stuff as a biological weapon)

Raising a child wasn't as cut and dry as we intially thought. Just when we think we've got the pattern down, Miyo throws us a loop and we're diving through books and calling doctors to figure things out. A few weeks ago she went through a bout of constipation that lasted a few days. We gave her drops that didn't help and eventually had to bring her in for an enema. Not exactly what I want her to go through but it was the last resort and she seemed to be in some discomfort from the constipation. Luckily she got through it with no tears and has been doing fairly well in depositing brown Christmas gifts for us since.

Now after a month and a half we do feel like we have a handle on most things. With diaper changes we're becoming a regular pit crew. We've got most of the cries figured out, but she still has what seems to be the ""I'm crying for no particular reason"" bouts. She's cooing and gaga-ing a lot more and checking out her surroundings with diligence. She's even sleeping most of the night. 

So it seems like things are all right. But for how long?"

Recently I've been reading to the baby. By around now it's supposed to be able to hear to some extent and so we thought it'd be good if it starting hearing my voice more. Not quite sure if it's true or not, but I've heard that it helps the baby to recognize the father and his voice from soon after birth. The sound is familiar so the baby turns toward it, gaining some comfort from something it can recognize in a bright ocean of light and, as far as it's concerned, chaos. I've also heard it may help brain development to some extent so we figure why not give it a shot.

We considered getting something called <i>babyplus</i>, which is supposed to pump sounds similar to the mother's heart with slight variations into the womb. I did a bit of research and it didn't seem to have any significant support other than ""testimonials"". Plus I'd heard some complain it was quite loud. So, rather than risk some kind of harm we nixed the idea.

Anyway, I've been reading some books Chi had around for her English school and among them I stumbled onto some Sesame Street books. They don't have my favorite, ""There's a Monster at the End of this Book"" where Grover reads the title scared of the monster only to realize the monster is him. It did remind me, however, of some of the songs I used to love from Sesame Street and the Muppets. 

As a result I've been singing ""Rubber Ducky"" ad nauseum and been recalling Kermit's ""Rainbow Connection"" playing on vinyl back in my family's old Levittown home. 

For some reason the latter always made me feel a little sad somehow. The Kermit version has him strumming a banjo lamenting about rainbows and chasing dreams hopefully finding a way to reach them someday. I doubt at the time it had much to do with the lyrics, but now older, hearing it once again I still get a wee bit pensive. 

""Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection, 
The lovers, the dreamers, and me.""

Only the second time I've ever made a curry from scratch. This one came out with a taste close to hummus. If you add tomatoes, a bit more ginger, and some sugar it's closer to a true Gujarati curry."

Michael Moore is back again with an issue I hope gets just as much attention as global warming has been getting recently. In his new film ""Sicko"", he talks about how ass-backwards a healthcare system is that often places profit as priority.

The number of weeks that my wife is pregnant. That's right. I'll be a father by November of this year. It still doesn't quite register, but her belly is growing and it ain't from overeating. The prospect of becoming a father brings a swirl of emotions. On the one hand, it's scary that I'll be in the same position as my parents. More responsibility. More to think about: Do we settle here? Do we buy a house? Will I be able to provide? Will I be around enough in my kid's life if I hold this job with such unorthodox hours?

But when I consider the flip side most of it washes from my mind. There'll be a little someone that I made. Someone who'll look up to me (for a while at least). Someone who I can teach, play around with. A family.

Both sides battle it out inside my head in a tug-of-war, but in the end I know that it's simply a blessing.

So, Florence aka Firenze as it's better known in Italy. 

We used Florence as a bit of a recovery stop on the honeymoon tour. Although there was plenty of sites we'd have like to have seen we had already started to feel the habitual lack of exercise catching up with us as our legs grew sorer each night. 

We left Rome early in a taxi cab running through the dark, empty streets. By now, growing weary of getting ripped off a few times previously I searched the cab to check the meter was on. Not appearing as though it was, I questioned the driver only to get a slightly annoyed look and a finger jutting toward the ceiling. At first, thinking it some rude Roman gesture I was getting ready to show him the eloquence of the English language when it comes to profanity. But then, slightly hidden behind the indoor light I noticed the meter. It ended up being cheaper than the price quoted in most guidebooks. 

We wearily worked our way through Termini station to find our train. We climbed aboard to find our reserved seats. Reading about others who had trouble with locals taking their seats I was slightly anxious to get to our seats a bit early. Instead of hooligans, we were greeted by a pack of nuns who were situated in seats around us. Thank God...literally.

<lj-cut text=""Day in Firenze"">
We arrived around 9:00 and were lucky enough to check into our hotel. From there we walked about Firenze headed in the general direction of Santa Maria del Fiore. It can be seen from pretty far away so wasn't exactly hard to find.

We went up one of the side towers, climbing around 500 narrows steps to the top. And when I say narrow I do mean it. Feels a little too intimate when you have to pass someone else on the way up. The view from the top, however, was amazing. It was like someone had taken my image of Italy and plastered it over the ground.

A bit winded from the stairs we decided to find some grub. We wandered into a touristy restaurant complete with Japanese menu. Not exactly what I wanted, but it seemed like a lot of places were closed for the holidays. Despite my fears that because it was touristy it would be the equivalent of an Italian McDonald's, the food was quite good. We had mushroom risotto, lasagna, and tiramasu. The table wine was also very tasty. 

We walked around Firenze some more afterward with no real purpose in mind - just wanted to get a feel for the city. We found a small kebab shop and split one for the experience. The meat was being roasted and cut before our eyes. 

We grew tired of walking and headed back to the hotel. 

When we returned we both started to feel a bit under the weather. Chi thought she had food poisoning from the mushrooms. I had a run-of-the-mill cold that would unfortunately cling to me until Barcelona.

For dinner we ate at the deserted hotel restaurant. The waitress didn't look especially pleased that she had to take care of us. But the food turned out good. The minestrone was so good that Chi still longs for more to this day. The pizza with anchovies we had was a little too salty for my tastes but looked great, if that counts for anything. 

After that we decided to call it a night and get some rest before an early train for a short visit to Venice. And it would be a very short visit.

Florence/Firenze honeymoon update is coming up soon (which probably means a couple weeks in my case), but wanted to post about a great cooking site I stumbled upon.

Open Food Source is a fantastic site that was recently sent up by the brilliant, witty writer of <a href=""http://www.yongfook.com"">Yongfook.com</a>. In essence it's a recipe site. It's been designed, however, to work more like a community than most of the run-of-the-mill foodie sites. Recipes are connected to the author's profile and a picture of the creation, which can then be rated or comment on by other users. 

There's an amazing amount of creativity in many of the recipes that have been posted so far and with pictures attached to all the recipes it makes it easier to choose recipes to try. I've posted up a couple myself <a href=""http://www.opensourcefood.com/people/Sinbad/"">here</a>."

In Rome we would find fatigue within the lurking shadows and be enveloped into its dark mass. 

The problems really started from Paris though. After my lovely wife over-tipped the driver, a generous move I had thought at the time, she recalculated what she gave and blamed me for not stopping her. We had agreed on an amount beforehand, but the driver had given us a bit of a tour of sights we had missed so I thought she gave a little extra because of that. 

After informing most of Charles De Gaulle how loud Japanese and Americans can really get, we had made up and were off to Rome. The flight didn't fare much better as we were gypped from the good sandwiches and were treated to a 1-year old's crying imitation of the jet engines outside. We landed and trouble piggy-backed along with us. We waited an hour for our luggage only to find it...missing. 

After complaining and waiting around 2 hours we decided to have one more look around, and lo and behold there is our luggage. It was apparently placed on another flight by accident. Lucky us.

As night had already fallen we'd pretty much missed out on our first day in Rome so we decided to get to our hotel and just relax. Dinner was pizza and pasta with some wine. ""At least we get to taste Rome,"" we thought. 

The hotel was nice with friendly staff. The room a bit sparce with cold, marble flooring, but enough for us.

Morning we awoke to a sun-drenched view of Rome, albeit far in the distance. We grabbed some breakfast and stole a bus ride to Rome. And I do literally mean steal, as we couldn't get a ticket anywhere and decided to do as the Romans do and hitch a bus ride without paying.

From there Rome was a something like a drug-induced dream. We started with the Colosseum and wandered our way through to the Forum, Venice Plaza, the Pantheon, Trevi Fountain, the Vatican, and much more all in one day.

Meandering through the narrow streets and taking in everything was amazing. Because everything seemed just a hop away we couldn't stop ourselves. And when we finally had thought we had had enough not a taxi was to be found and the metro was closed for some reason (perhaps a strike). So we had to walk zombie-legged to Termini station to catch a bus back.

We had dinner again at the hotel and crept wearily into bed so we could get up at the crack of dawn to make our train to Florence.

We arrived in Paris mid-afternoon. Tired from a night bus to Tokyo that was followed by a 12-hour flight we were just glad to get off the damn airplane. Chi had already started with the video camera on the plane and continued with riveting coverage of us waiting to pick up our luggage. 

But we were finally in Europe. Our next problem would be making sure we had a way to get into Paris. We had booked a shuttle last minute, but there was no confirmation before we left so we had to have information check for us. At first we freaked a little because the guy had never heard of the service we booked. Eventually all was cleared up and we were set to head into Paris.

A chatty and mildly annoying Vietnamese man who spoke some English and Japanese drove us to our hotel. We ran into some more trouble (a theme that would persist throughout Europe) in trying to get metro tickets to the Eiffel Tower. The ticket person had no change for a 10 Euro bill so we had to wander a bit to find someplace to get something. After finding a Chinese place we picked up a spring roll and took the subway to the Eiffel Tower. 

The Eiffel Tower was beautiful at night and would sparkle with hundreds of lights lit up every 10 minutes or so. We rode up to the top to see Paris. It was freezing. Paris wasn't quite the ""city of lights"" I'd imagined, but a sight to see nonetheless.

We next strolled down the Champs Ellysee careful to the decorative dog poo left to entertain us. It felt almost like a fantasy to walk down tree-lit street looking down the Arc Du Triomphe in the distance.

We finished the night by grabbing a baguette sandwich and heading home for some much needed sleep.

Next morning we picked up what we thought was a complimentary breakfast, only to be surprised later by a 26 Euro bill. It was excellent though. The pastries, deli meats, and cheese were quite good.

"event","Well this place is starting to feel a bit like lost ancient ruins - unused and mostly forgotten. I  think I'll make a return to writing here. If anything my writing needs practice so this should be good way to brush up on that. 

Chi and I recently returned from our honeymoon in Europe. We decided on a late honeymoon to avoid added stress during the wedding period. We hadn't originally planned to do it in winter (we were thinking to do it in spring) but circumstances made this the best time to do it. 

Europe was, for the most part, fantastic. We tried to do a little too much though. In a little more than 10 days we managed to hit 7 cities in Europe. We started out in Paris, moved to Rome and up through Italy to Florence and Venice. And then a tired hop, skip, and a plane to Barcelona, Malaga, and Madrid in Spain.

Admittedly, it was trying at times. Such a grueling schedule was something of a test to the seeds of our newly planted marriage. Tiredness begot irritability begot yelling. But at the end of the day (or at least most days) we usually made up and played nice. 

But it was worth it to be able to see many of the places and things we had been dreaming of seeing. And considering it may be a while before we're able to do anything like this again, I'm glad we did it. We saw the canals of Venice, the ruins of Rome, the genius of Gaudi in Spain, and the lights of Paris among much more. Lots of memories, lots of fun. 

I'll try to post photos soon."

"event","I'm engaged! Never would have thought it would happen myself. But she just happened to come into my life and now our lives are converging together, to be intertwined until some force, natural or otherwise, separates us. 

I proposed to her at an Italian restaurant a few weeks back. I gave her a photo album with a little story written along with it. As I reached the end I gave a little speech, turned the page, and showed her the words asking, ""Will you marry me?"". I'm a sucker for the romantic I guess. 

But I sometimes wonder whether all this has hit me fully. I've been living in Japan for the past 2 and a half years, and it looks as though I'll be here indefinitely. We may go back, we might not. And now at the age of 24 I'm set to get married. Never would have imagined this scenario even if I was put on hallucinogens. It all seems so surreal. When I take a step back out of my mind and look at it, it's just unbelievable. 

In high school and college I always pictured that I'd end up in a rather dreary, mundane sort of life. Of course I wasn't always in the best of moods then. But wouldn't have thought of this. 

But the future still lies beneath murky waters. It's not quite clear what lies ahead. And now things have to be planned for two. I don't know what lurks ahead, but I'm kind of glad I have someone to explore it with."

Valentine's was good. I got some chocolates from some of the staff and a few students. One of my kindergarten kids also gave me a hand-made chocolate. 

In Japan, Valentine's is a holiday where only women are supposed give to men, and then one month later on White Day men return the favor. 

I was a bit disappointed at first since Chi didn't give me so much as an email on my cell phone, and was telling me she'd talk to me later online. It wasn't a big thing. I didn't need anything but I figured a ""Happy Valentine's"" would do. But I shrugged it off since we had a Valentine's dinner the weekend before at a French restaurant. Plus we went shopping for a vacuum for the apartment so I figured that was a Valentine's gift in a way. So we had celebrated it some already. No big deal. 

So I was surprised to see her car outside my apartment. She had attempted to sneak into my apartment to surprise me. That was why she hadn't said anything I guess. She was going to park in the back in someone else's spot, but someone saw her so she settled for just being there for me. She had dinner ready with chocolate cake for dessert. Also gave me a beautiful hand-made scarf laced with her perfume. Best Valentine's ever. Got my work cut out for me for White Day."

"event","Man, the things that I get to do just because I'm a foreigner...

A friend of mine is taking guitar lessons at a school nearby. The school is doing a concert to showcase the students next month so each student is preparing a little something. My friend's friend is doing Green Day's ""Basketcase"", a song I'm notorious for doing in karaoke. My friend's friend thought it'd be cool to have native vocals along with them, sooo now I'll be performing with simply because I got rockin' English. Go figure. Of course, I also do a bad-ass rendition of the song - I'm sure that figured into the equation somehow. 

Anyway, Sunday I went to practice with them in a dingy toy model shop that's connected with the guitar ""school"". They have 2 guitars and a bassist. Still a little shakey on the song, but they're getting there. The teacher's a easy-going guy, joked around a lot. Even played the conga to give us some percussion. We had some groupies too. A couple of my friends showed up, plus one junior high student taking lessons stopped in to hear us jam. Kind of funny watching people bobbing heads to my singing. But wicked cool nonetheless. Should be fun."

"event","Finally back. After having my old computer breakdown took me a while to get around to getting a new one and getting the internet connected. Now I have a spiffy used Dell that runs 3X faster than my old one, and was bought for about a third of the price. 

Can't think of a whole lot that's new. Pretty much been working  and hanging out with Chiha or friends in my free time. Only a few more weeks before there's no official classes and I can start planning for next year. 

Despite the lack of any major news life feels pretty great. Job's a little tough with the commute and certain classes, but it's a good environment and a job nonetheless - better than nothing. Chiha and I have been together close to 8 months and things are still going strong as ever. Really can't complain. 

Anyway, just wanted to say I'm back. More to come when it comes."

"event","Life recently has consisted mostly of going to work and hanging out with Chiha. Not that that's any reason to complain. 

The job is for the most part good. Two days of the week I drive out of the city to teach kid classes. It gets really tiring trying to keep up with them, but they do tend to make me laugh. Toughest is probably the 4-5 year old kids' classes. They can't stick with anything for more than 5 minutes so I have to come up with a bunch of different activities to fill the time. Competition in one game got a bit much for one kid in a class last week and he started crying. I felt really bad. I kept trying to give him a chance to win, but that only soothed him for a couple minutes. I ended up having to finish the class early and hand him over to his mom. No competitive games next week I guess.

Wednesday and Thursday I teach at a beauty college. Most of the kids aren't that interested in English so I kind of have to teach to them like their junior high kids. We play games like Bingo, Simon Says, and word searches with rewards like chocolate to bribe them. It's worked so far and the classes have been fun. 

On Saturday and during the rest of the week the remaining time is filled up with private lessons - usually one-on-one lessons with adults or advanced school-aged students. Also because they tend to be mostly conversation lessons I get some interesting lessons. Had a lesson a few weeks ago with a woman that was infamous among the other teachers as being a bit of a mystery lady. She's rumored to have ties with the Japanese mafia among other things. She kept getting phone calls during the lesson. Also sort of turned the tables on me and gave me a psych test to see what I was like. Others give me gifts like bottles of beer (the student works at a brewery) or sweets. Not bad, huh?

I've been commuting by train most of the time, but recently got a car to make the commute a bit cheaper. I have a Toyota Corolla II now. Gave a it a good wash and clean when I first got it. First car I've had that I can call my own (even if it isn't really mine). The freedom that comes with a car in a rural area has definately been nice. I've been able to explore areas that would've taken forever to get to before. 

Things are still going well between Chiha and I. We mostly hang out on weekends, but occasionally we spend the weekdays together. On those times she usually texts me asking if I'll ride the train down to meet up with her. She's the sweetest. She'll often meet me at the station along with dinner. When we're together we tend to goof around a lot or talk. We're like little kids when we're together. It's a lot of fun being with her. Don't know what I'd do without her. 

Well that's it for now. Who knows when I'll get a chance to update next. Til then."

I thought this might be a fun project for grandson MiniBob and myself - maybe get him interested in something other than video games on the computer.&nbsp;
We went to the site and entered the serial number and saw that the tracking of this particular bill started in Amarillo, TX, maybe a couple other appearances there, and now we've logged our entry for Dallas.&nbsp; I gave the bill to MiniBob to spend and we'll watch and see if anyone else tracks an entry for it.

We also wrote ""Track me at wheresGeorge.com"" on 5 $1 bills and will redistribute them in the next few days.&nbsp; If any of you Dallas-area readers should happen to get one (not likely I know), be sure and log it for us."

The Pug Brothers stayed with Dave the St. Bernard and his people.&nbsp; They were overjoyed at first to see us, but are now sulking and acting as if they had been abandoned.&nbsp; Fat Boy is favoring his right hind leg a bit.&nbsp; I'm not sure what happpened, probably Dave sat on him or some other play got out of hand.

I'm wondering now if having them so friendly with such a big (ok, huge) dog was a mistake.&nbsp; They seem to have lost all fear of bigger dogs and will often get right up in their faces in an attempt to initiate play (I guess).&nbsp; They seem more timid around the smaller, yippy hyper-active type dogs.

Man Mistakenly Cuts Off Penis, Dog Eats It

Mon Oct 4,10:41 AM ET
	
Oddly Enough - Reuters

BUCHAREST (Reuters) - A elderly Romanian man mistook his penis for a chicken's neck, cut it off and his dog rushed up and ate it, the state Rompres news agency said Monday.

It said 67 year-old Constantin Mocanu, from a village near the southeastern town of Galati, rushed out into his yard in his underwear to kill a noisy chicken keeping him awake at night.

""I confused it with the chicken's neck,"" Mocanu, who was admitted to the emergency hospital in Galati, was quoted as saying. ""I cut it ... and the dog rushed and ate it.""

Doctors said the man, who was brought in by an ambulance bleeding heavily, was now out of danger."

Tonight, after 9 months without trimming my mustache, I took about 4 inches off my mustache. You can actually see my mouth now.  :)  Don't worry, I didn't (and won't) trim the beard any.

This week I've been filling in at one of the local tattoo studios. It feels great to be doing that again, and my hand has not hurt at all.  Kind of makes me want to do it again...  Hhmmm..   If I could only find a shop where I could come and go as I pleased, but did not have the extra burden of being the owner/boss."

"event","Yesterday I downloaded and installed the Mozilla Firefox browser.  I have to say I do like it and will continue to use it.  And yet, I'm disappointed.  Because of all the hype, I really expected it to be revolutionary - the same way iTunes and Gmail have changed the way I look at music players and email programs.  Some of the features are cool, but most of them, including the tabbed interface, are available for IE through 3rd party tools.  However, in the past couple weeks, I've had random lockups in IE, requiring the application to be ended, so Firefox is the new browser for now.

In other news, Dave the St Bernard is staying with us this week while his people are on vacation.  I will try to get some pictures of him playing with the Pug Brothers.  I swear that dog thinks he is the same size as a pug.  I just hope he does not fall down and squish one of my little guys."

Took a quick lap around the lake - the crape myrtles are beginning to bloom - and then headed for open highway.  I ended up in a little Mom&Pop diner place in Canton.  The owners were nice enough folks, though they seemed a little scared of me since no one else was in the cafe (I get that a lot).  They made me a good burger w/swiss, fries and a choc. milkshake.  I ate quickly, wished them well and left since it was beginning to look like rain was headed this way.

The trip back was uneventful.  No rain yet.  It was hot and very humid and I was sweating buckets, but even that seemed somehow refreshing.  Does that make sense?

So, I am back now - the pug brothers snuggled at my feet.  Angela is out spending money somewhere.  I hear the hammock calling my name..."

You would think that since I spent decades in a profession requiring great hand dexterity, that I would be good at something as simple as wrapping a present.  Not so.  As soon as I pick up the roll of paper, my fingers become huge and uncooperative. The result looks only slightly better than those items wrapped by my 5-year old grandson. 

Lucky for me the Pug Brothers don't give a damn if their presents are nicely wrapped or not.  :)"

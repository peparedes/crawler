"event","I hate depressing ends to shows... Why are all the Chinese shows I
watch always so sad????? Okay, here's a basic synopsis of the story:
guy falls in love with girl, they have to fight an evil person, they
make some friends who help them fight the evil person, all the friends
die (except for two of the old people but that's only they're minor
characters and only appear like three times during the 38 episodes of
the series), the girl sacrifices herself for the guy, and the guy ends
up with a baby and nothing else. <br>
<br>
Argh. I hate whoever made up this story. Apparently it's based on some
Chinese video game. At least in the game, the ending isn't as bad.
Pffft. <br>

Now I'm going to read <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Eldest </span>and try and focus on something happier. <br>

"event","Okay, so, I'm going to be leaving tomorrow. To go on the wonderful
college trip... Yeah... Half the schools on the list are places I don't
even want to go like Princeton and Cornell. But who's making me go
anyway? My oh so wonderful dad. <br>
Sure, they are good schools. But I DON'T want to go to some of them.
The only consolation I have is the possibility of seeing my best friend
who I haven't seen in over a year when we go to tour NYU. And yes, I do
actually want to go to NYU. More so than some of the other schools.
However, I'm really excited to finally be going to Johns Hopkins. My
dream school... Though now I might not be getting in due to the not so
happy scores I got on one of my SAT IIs. If that is the reason I don't
get in, I swear I will wipe off standardized testing from the face of
this earth. I don't know how I'll do it, but I will. <br>
I want to go on a long roadtrip one day. Just get away from here, from
places that I'm accustomed to. I'm sure I'll be back but I just want a
little bit of adventure - journey into something totally unfamiliar. <br>
My suitcase won't fit all my clothes since I have to share it with my
sister. &lt;sigh&gt; My parens won't even let me have my own!<br>

"event","<P>I hate standardized testing...it stinks. Even though I think I did fine on the Biology, I still despise these tests more than ever. </P>
<P>I had to go to Pawtucket, RI to take my test. It was really annoying. The school was really big though. All the SAT II people had to go to the cafeteria where they separated us alphabetically. The guy actually got my name right on the first try!!! However, before I was called, he announced someone else who I haven't seen in years and evidently didn't recognize when I got in. It was Zach Arbit! Ugh. And what is up with his hair??? Hopefully he didn't recognize me either. </P>
<P>Anyway, I have to continue studying for history. I hate history. Primary source readings are fun. But I don't like having to memorize everything about them. &lt;sigh&gt; Maybe tomorrow, after I'm done with everything, I won't have to take another history class ever for the rest of high school. Then again, I still want to take the course in Ancient Chinese history next spring, so maybe I won't give up on history altogether. </P>

"event","My birthday is tomorrow!! Yay!!! <br>
However, I am still stuck studying for my lab final and finishing up
the revisions of my English paper. Plus, I have a feeling that
something else is due but I have no idea what. <br>
I was watching the ending of Survivor tonight and I realized how
pathetic the people on the show were. Not that I didn't think they were
pathetic before, it just exxagerated their patheticness even more. I
mean, who would give up a million dollars just for a donut? It's
pathetic. They could've at least waited for the pizza. What's even
worse is how shocked people seem to be when they realize that one of
their fellow game members has been voted off. I mean, if they signed up
for this as a game, why do they allow any emotions interfere with what
they originally set out to do? If anything, this show brings out the
fakeness I see in people every day to the worst extent. Inevitably they
will have to part with one another and it's pointless to try and make
any connections (unless, of course, it helps you get ahead in the
game). It's a harsh way of viewing human nature, but that's the
""nature"" of the game. After all, doesn't everyone just want to win? <br>
So those were my thoughts about the show. And of some aspects of daily human life. <br>
Somehow I get the feeling that my birthday is not going to be all that fun. <br>

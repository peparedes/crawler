<P><STRONG>It has been a rollercoaster of a month for me but I can still say I do not regret one moment. Emotionally I suppose I am a tad unstable and I have done some rather dumb stuff over the past few days but you can only learn from your actions and that could only be a good thing.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>I at this time want to just thank Clairy for being there for me. you are my rock and the only person I know I can confide in.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>I am proud to have you in my life, you are a damn fine bitch !!</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>I shall be moving to smelly Bridgwater in the coming months, I really need to start a new life as I am so unhappy with the one I have created for myself here, And I cant wait to hang around with Clairy :)</STRONG></P>

In my infinite wisdom I offered to cook xmas dinner for me family .... what I did not know was that the oven had broken down and I would have to cook for 8 people using just a combination microwave oven. I started cooking at 06:30 and finaly dished up the food at 17:00.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>&nbsp;All in all though I had a pretty funky xmas made special by someone very important to me :) ( it is quite amazing the effect just a few texts and phone calls can have on a person) </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>I hope everyone had a great xmas though i have to admit I am pretty much glad it is all over. Now I just need to get new years out of the way and I can start dealing with all my new future plans :) </STRONG></P>

"event","Well today was kinda mooooo

I think the concept of going to work after 2 days off has sunk me into a minor dose of pissiness.

had a good morning though ....... cant wait to hear Clairy singing Conte Partiro ..... I am gonna laugh my ass off .... well as soon as she has finished laughing at me anyway.

seen the funniest thing EVER today.

I saw an old episode of Rainbow .... and I can honestly say that I do not ever remember quite as much sexual innuendo ..... infact i swear they prolly would not show that episode til after the watershed nowadays hehe

feel a bit bad that I have got so disorganized that i am reduced to begging to parents and friends to feed me lol.... but I have learned my lesson now and it will not be happening again in a hurry.

Gave prolly my first and last non sexual massage today ..... it was not half as much fun..... tis far more fun to relax the poor lady then ruin it by jumping her hehe...... but she is not my type so i will reserve them for yummilicious ladies lol."

"event","Well I suppose I should get my first entry out of the way.

Been using Diaryland but a friend has informed me just how funky this place is so only fair I at least give it a go

I am not going to make this entry all poosie and depressed as I have plenty of time to put some of those in.

Had a very busy week of 12hr shifts and I am a wee bit tired, but all in all I have had a truly funky if not a little odd week

firstly I have started talking to the funkiest girlie I know again (clairybo) .... I missed her more than I miss a kebab on a weekend

My best friend Is getting married so I get to spend lots of time talking him out of it and even better I will get to tell him "" I told you so "" when it all falls to pieces

I got an interview date for a much better paid job with oooodles of holiday entitlement.

I finally managed to pick up a book and start reading ..... yay

there is prolly loads more I could mention this week but I am way too sleepy to think


Oh and I am super pissy cos once I have finished this entry and I look at it, I am gonna see a very poosie unsparkly entry that needs to look colourful

Clairy HEEELLLLPPPP MEEEEEEE"

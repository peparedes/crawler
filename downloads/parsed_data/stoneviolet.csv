This is not a love letter.

These are all the things I want tell you at fragile midnight.

Hope is an undaunted child who refuses to forget where the candy is hidden. Things are not always as difficult as they seem. I want to discuss roots, dirt, seeds and water, but not necessarily in that order. 

I want to explain the significance of vultures and doves. Ferocious is not a good color.

I want to play ""Blackbird"" for you. Music is one true universal force. I want to tell you about the time I set my bangs on fire accidentally while lighting a cigarette. The human soul is compartmentalized. Your smile just lights up your entire face, but is not the crux of what makes you beautiful. There are far too many poems written about the intricacies of the moon. You have the heart of a compassionate falcon. I want to open up your feather chest and study what has been torn and mended and what hasn't been mended. I want to count and know each stitch. Angels don't sleep. I want to watch your eyes while you are deciding on an answer to something. Time can be a snail if it chooses to be. To be comfortable beneath the sun, one must embrace the night for black is not always the complete absence of light. I cannot comprehend the distance of water. I want to describe to you what stones, sunsets and skulls sound like. Quiet is not always peaceful. I want to listen to your best joke and stories of your first love. I want to share everything I have ever learned about silver coins. I want to make you a dragon out of paper.

I want to explain the significance of crows in a murder. I want to show you how soil is a crucial part of me. 

Torpor is not a good color, either.

Spilled love has a tendency to saturate everything it touches.</font>"

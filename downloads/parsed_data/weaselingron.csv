"event","I hate ghosts. Especially poltergeists. I don't even know why we have them around when they try to make your suffer. Or when they do stupid things, like locking people up in broom closets. Damn you all to hell. Don't you know that closets are used for hide and seek <strike>snogging and even shagging</strike>? I would think everyone knew that by now."

"event","I guess we're back at this place again, eh? I'm pleased to say that the holidays did me good, with playing a bit of Quidditch and all. Got a nice tan, but I'm not sure if you can tell. All I can say is that I look pretty good. Damn right I do. <strike>You know you want me.</strike> 

Seems like Dumbledore has lost his marbles. Sucks to be Harry though to have detention with Snape. Of course, we know what's <i>really</i> going on. Or at least I do. <strike>Duh, they're getting laid, man.</strike> And as usual, Ginny's being stupid. 

Oh, does anyone fancy some chocolate? I have a lot with me right now and if you come down here in five minutes, I'll give you something extra. <strike>Maybe a shag if you're lucky</strike>. Chocolate? Yes? It's a good offer, you know!"

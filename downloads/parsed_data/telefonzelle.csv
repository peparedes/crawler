#1: i haven't read anyone's journal yet lol
#2: thanks for the note, awstin
#3: i missed you guys
#4: i'm going to tell you alll about my camping trip

so.. the best part is that i got a black acoustic guitar at a pawn shop for only 70 bucks. and it's a good guitar. and most likely everyone already knows that b/c the second i signed online i told everyone :). and i'm HECKA FAT because lizzy's dad bought us a lot of good food. and smores. but i'm also really dirty because camping showers suck ass. there was a cute vintage store and some other nice stores at arcata (pothead town). i bought a skirt and a shirt and i got a little red belt for free haha. the best part of the pothead town was when there was some guy with a mohawk standing on the corner and he looked at me and said ""can you spare some change?"" and right as i was about to answer he lifts up a sign that says ""smile if you masturbate."" lolll of course by the time i realized what the sign said i realized that i was already smiling so i might as well screw myself up the ass. anyway the second time that i saw him he tried it again but we told him we already saw it and complimented him on his originality. from what i heard from lizzy's sister's bf, the guy got a ticket from a cop and as he was writing it out, he held up a sign saying ""this man is protecting us."" and as soon as the cop left he held up a sign saying ""cop stole my weed."" we went on a few hikes, one of them being pretty scary. that's pretty much all there is to tell about the camping trip. 

i have a lot of the summer assignment to do. so i'm officially screwed. i need to call a million people who called when i had no service :(((((. the lady who hooked me up with my free piano thinks i don't appreciate her so i have to fix that too. 

in the meantime, go fuck yourself."

i went to meet this ukrainian piano teacher yesterday, he's dying of cancer, but from what i hear from everyone that knows him i should take advantage of his lessons while i can. BUT they cost $50 per set of lessons. sorry, but i'm not made of money. plus he was really scary and he asked me to play things that i didn't know how to play because i've NEVER taken lessons before. ok..had to get that off my chest. GUITAR AND SARKY ARE WAY BETTER THAN PIANO AND CRAZY UKRAINIAN GUY. 

oh, there are these songs that my mom used to sing to me when i was little. they're really pretty and they make me nostalgic. she figured out how to play them on the piano and i wrote down the notes and i'm going to transfer them to guitar. i've already done one song. woohoo for me! they're cute. ask me and i'll play them for you b/c they're pretty easy too haha

oh and awwstin is pretty cool b/c he stays up really late and listens to me and laurie make total idiots of ourselves. laurie's good at speaking asian haha she yelled it out the window at people who walked by. this all happened at like 2 in the morning. goodtimes!

i have to do my schoolwork. i'm only on chapter 4 of the english book and i've only taken notes on ch.1 for world history. eeeeek"

"event","<P>That was a nice break. Livejournal was really getting to me. But here&nbsp;I am, with no motivation to go get out of the house because i'm a <EM>sick ass bitch</EM>. It's gotten to the point where getting up in the morning is this enormous torture for me, let alone falling asleep in the first place.&nbsp;I feel like I'm going to suffocate. I'm whining over a cold and a headache, but hell,&nbsp;I guess this is what happens when you're running on painkillers. I'm so sick of this. Literally.&nbsp;I was hoping that summer would offer a chance to relax, but it only presents more stress. First of all, being the genius that&nbsp;I am,&nbsp;I lost my summer assignments for honors english and AP world history. I had to call people and ask for copies of theirs.&nbsp;I did that on monday, and&nbsp;I still haven't gotten them. First of all, because I'm a lazy ass. But second of all because one of the people hasn't even called me back yet. 

        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't breathe at night it feels like I'm going to explode from the&nbsp;neck up. People have been calling and&nbsp;I haven't been answering and I'll sit in front of the phone for like fifteen minutes at a time wanting to call them and explain what's going on but&nbsp;I don't have the energy to explain myself.&nbsp;I feel horrible for doing that to people but honestly i'd be a party pooper (<FONT size=1>yeah, i'm mature</FONT>). My boyfriend thinks&nbsp;I hate him, when&nbsp;I really don't. I don't know what to do. I just want to lay down and hybernate or something. This shouldn't be happening. Well anyway,&nbsp;I owe a lot of people apologies for being so nonexistant and as of now whiny.&nbsp;I can't help it,&nbsp;I don't know what's happening to me. Whatever it is, I hope it will be gone by friday because i'm hoping to see galin and saturday i have to go to concord mall with lubka and sunday I'm babysitting from 12:30 to 6 and probably going home and sleeping after that. Next week though, I'll be free. My plan to work out every day has so far been bombed. Laurie's going to move soon, too soon. <EM>Everything is falling apart,&nbsp;I just want to go back in time.</EM></P>"

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A new approach being used to fight cancer may also help fight fat, U.S. researchers said on Sunday. 

   

They said blocking a certain protein seems to literally vacuum fat off mice. 


When fat mice were injected with the new ""fat-zapper"" every day for a month, they all slimmed down to normal weight with no visible side-effects, the researchers reported in the June issue of Nature Medicine. 


But they stressed the experiment is still in the very early stages and it affects a function found in virtually all cells -- meaning it has a high potential for serious side-effects. 


""I am trying to un-hype this,"" said Dr. Wadih Arap of the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, who led the research. 


In cancer, a new class of drugs called angiogenesis inhibitors starve tumors by cutting off their blood supply. 


Arap and colleagues have turned this approach against fat. 


It makes sense, Arap argues -- fat cells grow and proliferate quickly just as cancer cells do. Like tumors, they build themselves a scaffold of tiny blood vessels called capillaries for sustenance. 


Cancer drugs tackle different proteins involved in building blood vessels. Arap's team looked for a protein that might be found only in the blood vessels that feed fat cells. 


They found one. Prohibitin is active on the surface of fat-feeding blood vessels. They also found a monoclonal antibody -- a synthetic immune system molecule -- that finds and attaches to prohibitin alone. 


REVERSING OBESITY 


""If even a fraction of what we found in mice relates to human biology, then we are cautiously optimistic that there may be a new way to think about reversing obesity,"" said Renata Pasqualini, Arap's research partner and wife. 


Arap's team made the monoclonal antibody lethal by attaching it to another protein fragment or peptide that causes apoptosis -- a natural programmed cell suicide. 


Then they put normal mice on what they called a ""cafeteria diet."" ""It is high in calories,"" Arap said in a telephone interview. The mice started out weighing just under an ounce, 20 to 25 grams, but more than doubled their weight on the diet. 


Then they injected half the mice with the new fat-killing molecule. After daily injections for a month, the fat mice lost, on average, 30 percent of their body weight. 


""The weight loss was also accompanied by a reversal of fatty liver and glucose intolerance,"" Arap said, describing two common complications of obesity. ""They actually looked better. You could see them walk and so on."" 


They also tested aging mice, which tend to get fat. ""They responded just the same. They looked a little thinner,"" he said. 

   



Arap said his team saw no side-effects. ""They didn't have any signs of being ill,"" he said. ""All measures look improved. If they had a side-effect we couldn't detect it."" 

Arap's team did not measure how long their mice lived and they did not measure lean body mass to see if the mice lost healthy muscle tissue, too. 

Next they plan to test baboons, which tend to put on weight much as humans do. 

Arap noted that other research in which fat rodents have miraculously lost weight has not translated to humans. And prohibitin is found inside cells, which means that accidentally disrupting it there could cause severe side-effects. 

""I think it will be a while before we know whether this will be duplicated in humans,"" he said."

When they took him to the gallows I just saw a scared old man trying to keep his composure as best he could. The taunting and insults cast at him in his final moments was rude, crude, and uncouth. Although it was the 'Iraqi"" government that was in charge, this is going to be a huge shit sandwich for the US. This whole thing is just so sad. It is becoming clear to me that this country learned nothing from the Viet Nam experience. That makes us Nam vets ... Well I hope some of you can understand what it makes us feel like. 

Happy New Year friends.

"event","My uncle Jim Passed last month on the 20th. We corresponded on a regular basis. When I was stationed in Japan in 1968 we got together in Tokyo for a bite to eat and a visit.&nbsp; He was on a reunion trip for the fourteenth air force. That was the Flying Tigers in China in WWII. He is gone now and his passing has brought me down much more than I expected. I knew he was in his 90's but somehow I was conditioned for my uncle Jim to always be there. Now I wish I had asked him more questions about what it was like in India and going to China in that time. It is so strange. I'm an old fart myself but my uncle Jim was one constant thing in my life. Now he is gone and I miss him much more than I thought I would. I have more thoughts but I just cannot put them down here now. All I can say is get close to your uncles and aunts and ask them everything. You will not be sorry for that."

"event","I got a letter today telling me that my Uncle Jim passed away last Wed. morning in Texas. I talked to him earlier this month and I knew he was failing but he said he was doing better. He also told me that if he did not get much better soon he hoped he would just go to sleep and not wake up.&nbsp; At least he got our Christmas card we made for him and told him how much we loved him. I believe he was 93 or 94 years. We sent him smoked salmon every Christmas for the past 18 years or so.&nbsp;It was a real treat for him and he really liked it.&nbsp; My uncle Jim was an aircraft mechanic with the American Volunteer Group in China in WWII. Otherwise known as the Flying Tigers. This is, I'm sure, politically incorrect, but the Japanese were very&nbsp;barbaric in thier occupation of China in that war.&nbsp;The Americans provided almost the only air power to challenge the Japanese. There are Chinese alive today who remember and are thankfull for that. My uncle&nbsp;loved the Chinese people and he told me many stories that&nbsp;would make most folks just cry. He told me one story that I will relate. Him and a buddy got some rare time off and went into a local Chinese town. There were rickshaw&nbsp; drivers. (I suppose I should say rickshaw pullers.) Anyhow they were only too happy to give rides to the Americans. My uncle Jim and his buddy rented a rickshaw. But they put the driver in the rickshaw and took turns pulling him around town. The local Chinese just doubled over in laughter at the sight.&nbsp;That was my uncle Jim at his best.

There are more stories I could tell but I just thought I would toss this one out into cyberspace so perhaps it will not be lost forever. I will miss my unclle jim.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"

"event","Things can always get worse and sometimes do. The lay off Monday was a blow but last night some one in a large pick up or suv went around a corner too fast in icy conditions and managed to pretty much destroyed my '93 Ford Ranger. The impact pushed my poor truck into the curb and back a full five feet into the car parked behind me. The old ranger had almost 200,000 miles on it but it was paid for and never failed to get me where I needed to get. More likely than not the person who hit my truck was drunk and fled the scene to avoid getting a DUI. I have liability insurance and uninsured driver protection but not comprehensive. I figured with a pickup that old comprehensive was not really needed. If I were to get into an accident that was not my fault the other driver's insurance would cover things. If the other driver had no insurance I would be covered as well. A late night hit and run seemed very unlikely but there it is. My insurance company tells me that I have to prove that the driver that hit me had no insurance. That will be difficult because I doubt I'll ever know the name of the perp. I'm covered for damage to the car parked behind me but it looks like I'm in the market for a new ride at my own expense. Hard to find work of any sort without transportation. The only consolation to me is my my old pick up gave as good as it got. Someone is driving around with a lot of damage to their rig."

"event","Yep. I got layed off Monday. Small company and the orders just stopped coming in. I was making good bucks but as a temp I learned that the temp agency was getting what my hourly rate was. So it was like the company was paying for two of me. Heck, I can understand that. When things slow down, the temps are the first to get whacked. I really did like working there. The folks I worked with were the greatest. Oh well. Merry Christmas to me.

I've been thinking about Wonder Warthog a lot lately. What would W.W. do in my situation? He might get on his ""Fastass Sumbitchi"" motorcycle for a spin around the country for starters but I'm thinking the ""Hog of Steel"" would find something new to do. Apparently, what I've been doing for the past thirty years or so is just not working anymore. 

For now I'm making soap. It is about the only thing in my life I have total control of. I choose the ingrediants. I choose the mixing temps. I choose the scent that the soap will wind up smelling like. We have sold some to folks that kept our business card. It was a pleasure to send the stuff  to the ones that could recieve and enjoy it.  I'll pick up some supplies tomorrow. Shea butter, coco butter and sodium hydroxide (Also known as lye) .
Thanks to all the meth heads for getting Red Devil Lye off all the store shelves.  What fragrance tomorrow? Not sure. Perhaps I'll try this Mulberry or Apple Martini. Cucumber  might be a good one as well.

I think the new job is going to work out. Yesterday was crazy. Owners and engineers out there in assembly putting the product together so it would be ready for UPS. I like it. All hands on deck. Everyone pulling on the same end of the rope. Refreshing compared to many places I've worked. Yes, it can get stressful sometimes as well. But the good humor of my boss and co-workers means a lot. I've worked in humorless places and I do not recommend them. I asked a question to another programmer yesterday and the programmer next to me says ""Ah, Fred with the hard question."" I cracked up. I enjoy going into work at this place. 

Other breaking news. A bro of mine got an elk. He now has about 400 lbs of elk meat on his hands. He assured me that he will give me some. I offered to make as much jerkey as he wants on my Treager wood pellet grill. These things are awesome. I'm doing pork shoulders right now for pulled pork sandwitches tomorrow and next week. I prefer to use pecan pellets but they were out so I'm using apple instead. Pork is great but elk is really something special. 

That's all the news worth telling right now. Have a good weekend all."

"event","Happy Thanksgiving to any who might read these scribblings. Honestly, Id just as soon be at work today. Working for the temp company is OK in some ways. They got me out of the almost coal mine job I had before. They do have a bare bones health plan. But no paid holidays. Hence, I'll have a small payday come 30 November. We will survive anyhow. After surviving eight months with zero income this will be a piece of cake. 

Regarding currant events I'm vexed about what is going on in Iraq. I can understand the axe they have to grind against the US but why do they hate each other so much? Here in this country we had a war that killed over 600,000. Six hundred thousand. Most of my kin were on the losing side of that one. Well we still made it through thoes times and came out pretty much ok I think. My grandfather told me that the worse thing that happened to the South was Abraham Lincoln getting killed. I believe my grandfather was right on. I don't have the answer to the living hell that is now in Iraq. Folks burning neighbors alive is just beyond my comprehension. 

I expect I'll be making my famous turkey curry later today. Although I did not personally slaughter the bird like my friend Evergrey did we are gratefull for the food we have. I have killed a few deer, ducks and geese in my life but I no longer hunt. I am more into fishing these days. 

I have an uncle in Texas who is not doing well. He is about 92 years I believe. He is the last blood kin I have on my fathers side. I think my wife will have to go down to Texas and take care of him. I'm worried that no one is looking after him properly. He is a fine man. He was an aircraft mechanic with the American Volunteer Group in China in WWII. He helped drive the Japanese out of China in that war. Ironic isn't it? Now Japan is a friendly nation and China is the 800 pound gorilla. There are still some Chinese folks alive who remember the Americans that came to help them when they felt like they were alone in their struggle with the Japanese. I'll stop this rambling and get to making my turkey curry. I like it over batsmatti rice. Take care friends..."

Customers indicated they would not be buying a lot of the product for a while. Well guess who gets slammed in the butt first? The temp dude of course. I can't really blame them. The temp agency was making every bit as much as I was. It was like the company was paying for two of me. What a blood sucking business. I'm inclined not to work for a temp agency again as long as I live thank you very much. I quit a job with good benifits to take this one. I did not like the old job working graveyard in a fairly dirty shop but at least I had good health insurance and benifits. Now I'm out of work again. The timing could have not been much worse. What next? I don't know. Right now it hurts too much to even think about it. Perhaps move to Viet Nam and open an American style BBQ restaurant for the old vets who might be there. Perhaps I'm just getting too old for the pace of the manufacturing companys here anymore. It is a rude awakining to find out that the work that you have done for over thirty years to support yourself and family no longer is marketable. Not trying to bum anyone out.

"event","I just happened to be watching the news this evening. I think it was NBC. Now that the Commander and Chief is visiting Viet Nam, it is all over the news. I saw a thing where there are folks carefully digging in certain locations looking for remains of Americans who died trying to escape the VC back in 1965. I applaud the effort the folks are doing. It just brought up a lot of old stuff in my memory. Back around 1970 or so POW bracelets became popular. They were made for the missing and unaccounted for Soldiers, Sailors, Marines and Airmen missing in action in that war. To see these young folks carefully sifting through soil in Viet Nam looking for remains of these guys just choked me up. I have eight of the bracelets. Capt. John Nasmyth 9-4-66 (I belive he made it back), Capt. Charles Hoskins 2-16-71 (just after I got out of the Navy), LCDR Charles Lee 7-9-67, Lt. Col. W.N.""Newk"" Grubb 26 Jan 66, Maj. Robert Lodge 5-10-72, LCDR Hugh A. Stafford 30 Aug. 67, Staff Sgt. David Demmon 6-9-65, and Lt. John Heilig 5-5-66. I rarely take these out and look at them anymore. I'm not sure how to explain my feelings other than I was shaken up. I remember when we were in Subic Bay and another destroyer came in. A round had gone off in the breach of one of the 5""38 guns. They had a big tarp over the gun mount. One of the guns was blown off the ship in the explosion. It was a miricle that only a few sailors were killed. Word got around that some of the dead guys had I beams of steel impaled through their bodies and they had to use cutting torches to get the poor guys out. It is these memories that get stirred up once in a while and remind me how senseless war usually is. I know Hitler had to be stopped but in the Nam so many guys around my age died and I cannot figure out what good it did. I believe this will vex me to the end of my days. This whole Iraq thing has me stressed out. I'm sure I'm not the only Nam vet to feel that way.

I'm thankfull for my new job, my wife daughter and son. Once in a while I will pull out the bracelets and read the names of the guys and remember them."

The brineing with spices and aromatics before roasting. I have to admit it comes out flavorful and juicy every time. My wife and I have our yearly argument. I like cornbread stuffing. She likes her own bread stuffing. She always wins that one but it is a traditional argument. I'll get Thursday off but will work Friday and perhaps some of Saturday. At least I like my job and I know poverty sucks. 

Many folks get tired of all the leftover turkey pretty soon but I've an answer for that. I make a killer turkey curry. Get your bell pepper, onion, mushrooms, perhaps some shaved carrot and saute in a little olive oil. Put aside. Then saute your leftover turkey. Prepare your curry however you like. We use the packages of curry paste from Japan I believe. You can certainly use curry powder if you prefer. When the time is right mix it all together and simmer until it is thick enough for you. Then serve it over hot rice. I am partial to batsmatti rice. Wonderful aroma. I promise your leftover turkey will disappear. Happy Thanksgiving to all."

Heck I am not really sure myself. It makes you pay attention to what you are doing. That much is certain. Also on my face it does a good job of getting rid of the little stubbies in my neck area. You women probably have no idea what I'm talking about. Also it reminds me of my very early years on the farm in Ohio. The razor strap was a prominant feature in the bathroom there. During the week I just use the Norelco to buzz off the stubble but on Sunday when I shave it is sort of nostalgic. I'm not sure if that is the right word. After my surgery last March I let my facial hair grow out some. By June I looked a lot like Robert E. Lee. <grin> It was not a bad look but I took it off to rejoin the workforce. I still have my mustache. I've had one for many years and I think I look goofy without one.

Looks like the same scenario to me pretty much. I'm convinced that there are really bad folks out there who like to saw off heads of helpless victims on vidio. They will cut the head off of some one converting from Islam to a Christian or any other faith for that matter. In 50 years will our presence in Iraq make a diff? Not much I'm thinking. Anyhow I'll be sending a care package of my homemade soap, shampoo bars, snacks, paperback books and anything else I think might be appreiciated to a unit in Iraq or Afganistan. I use ""anysoldier.com"". Most of these folks just want to come home. I hope they do. At some point the folks in Iraq will have to sort things out for themselves. If that means splitting the country up into a Kurd, Sunni, and Shiet(sp?) sectors then so be it. In spite of what many over there think, killing all the Jews will not make things better for them. I don't have the answer for anything. I just hate to see all this carnage. If we teach our children hate, then hate will manifest itself in the future generations. The world turns and changes and I feel so helpless to help make anything better. I'll just do what I can in small ways and hope for the best.

Another programmer was talking about the journey of life today and remarked, ""Well, when you hit 50 you are done,"" I replied, ""I guess that means I'm well done."" Laughs all around. I'm happy in my new job and even these young guys are starting to like me. Why not? I'm a very likable dude. Mitch told me that veterans should have veteran's day off. I cannot argue with that but I've never worked for any place that had veterans day as a holiday. I understand folks who work for the government have it as a paid holiday but I have not worked for the government since I got out of the Navy. Seems like I'm getting long winded here and probably boring for most folks who might read this. I'll wear my ribbons tomorrow when I go to Costco and anywhere else for the day.

Actually I get it cheaper in bulk but how do they know I'm not a meth cook? I expect it is because of the avacado oil, castor oil, jojoba oil and the shea butter and coco butter I also buy from them from time to time. Just watch. Soon you will need a federal ID just to prove you are a hobby soapmaker.

Last market day this coming Saturday. We will bring all our soap in. I've got a feeling our regular customers will be loading up for stocking stuffers and just to make sure they don't run out of the good stuff for a few months anyway. It will be good to see our fellow vendors once more before the end of market season. We have all had good and bad days there but have helped each other out when someone was feeling down.

October brings a new job for me. I'm pumped about that. The graveyard shift was killing me. A new job is always a little scarey but bring it on. Nothing like being a 58 year old ""new guy"".

Hope the rest of the week is smooth sailing for all yall. Take care and TTYL."

"event","Where to start?
    The last year and a half have been bad for my wife and me. Things are finally looking up. I start a new job Monday. I rolled my toolbox out of the old place last night. Graveyard shift and breathing the bad air in that shop was just really getting to me. I entertained the idea of two weeks notice but I was never given that at the last places I worked. I will enjoy the last bit of ""Indian Summer"" here in Portland, Oregon for the rest of this week and then move on to a new beginning. I'm not going to dwell on the past. It would help nothing. The past is what it was. I will focus on what is ahead of me and do the best I can with that. 

    My wife and I will sell our homemade soap once more this coming Saturday. Then the market is over until next May. We did fairly well this year. Hopefully next year will be even better. We have a lot of loyal customers in Sherwood that seek us out for the soap we make. It is good for folks to make some things from scratch. That way you have complete control of the final product. In our case our soap. We use high end ingredients.Shea butter, coco butter, avocado oil, jojoba oil, olive oil, castor oil and the usual coconut oil, palm kernal, and palm oil. We do not use Crisco or load up on corn oil like some soapmakers do. We make the best soap we can. Our loyal customers do know the difference. I'll now get off my soap box.

    I had a cousin and his wife out here for last weekend. We had not seen each other in seventeen years. It seems none of us are getting any younger. We had a great visit. He will go back to Mississippi with stories of buckets of steamer clams, micro brew, douglas firs and a really good time. We steamed up some fat artichokes and showed him and his wife how to eat them. 

    I believe I'll just choke it off right here. I will post more when I have something interesting to tell or perhaps if someone has a question for me. In the mean time, hello to all y'all."

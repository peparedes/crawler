"event","1 phone call was all it took. I have a note from Dr. Brown, written on his prescription stationary, that says that Frog boy has an intolerance to cows milk and that he needs to have Soy milk. 

Don't mess with me. I was taught by Head Start how to teach other parents to be their child's advocate. 

On another note, I went in to volunteer in Frog's class today and his teacher told me that he is very good at knowing the rules and that he is very good at putting his listening ears on. 

My answer, ""Are you sure your talking about MY kid? Michael Coocen?"" What is up with that? He is a perfect angel at school and a holy terror at home???"

"event","I just got a call from the school. They won't allow Michael to have his Soy Milk because it is not a medical necessity. He is not allergic to milk. So because I CHOOSE to have him drink soy milk and not subject him to the hormones and other things that are in cows milk my child has to suffer and eat his cereal with water? WTF is up with that? 

This is EXACTLY the reason I didn't want to deal with the school system. Because my family doesn't go along with their ""cookie cutter"" 4 food groups system and my child doesn't have a ""special problem"", my child has to suffer. I understand their no food from home thing because of the peanut allergies. But Soy Milk doesn't have any peanuts in it thank you. If they didn't make a big deal out of the fact that his milk is different then there wouldn't be the ""I want what Michael has"" crap. 

I am just a TAD aggravated because they told me to begin with that it wasn't a problem. Now they are saying that this may be a problem with the rest of the school system on top of Head Start. This is EXACTLY why I didn't want him IN the school system. Because you have to be just like everyone else or suffer. I wish I had the car right now because I would go and get him and bring him home. I am SOOOO pissed right now."

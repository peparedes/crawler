"event","Ok so i  haven't really written in this thingy for a while ok maybe a long long time but here i am now. There isnt much news. We came in second for our school band competition. Our teacher is mad because he always expects the BEST! You probably have all heard but kurtis that guy i like said hi and smiled at me. I was happy but now its not a big big deal. He waves alot now. hehehe(maybe he has only waved twice since but alot) And this is y the subject is lol lindsay. Lindsay i was reading your i repeat YOUR horoscopes and when i got to mine(aquarius)(lmao) it was true!!! It said that i was getting closer to someone and farther aways from someone. ANd i am getting closer to kurtis and also so new friend that were right underneath my nose but getting farther away from you, courtney, julianne, cathryn and well everyone. My mom really i mean REALLY, doesnt want me to go back to don bosco. Im not so sure though cause im kinda starting to like my school but dont worry not that much. Well tuta (trying to find a cool way to say goodbye)"

The did a demonstartion. I didnt really find the ppoint in it and it was pretty boring. Mostly I would be like well we are missing school but, we were only missing band and i like band so yah.We got no homework today so I am pretty happy. THERE IS SOMETHING BAD THAT HAPPENED TO ME TODAY!!!!!!!!!! OK, my friend named kassandra likes this guy alot named patrick. She was all angry at me and my friend jenna for no reason today.

"event","Hello
today was the worst day ever. First of all in our school our heating system is all screwed up. It was on way too high for the classrooms and couldnt be shut down. So all the teachers were all angry and grumpy dont forget mouthy. Also I had band practise this morning so I had to get up at like 6:30 and I was soo tired because the night before i didnt really sleep. The worst of all is really bugging me and i am going crazy. I am not trying to be a goody two shoes but I am sure you would be scared too. See my teacher Ms. Allen she hates me because every class we get questions for homework and every class I whisper to my friend that we will have questions again. Some how she found out how much i hate questions and just for some reason hates me. I know cause a while ago we had to stay in cause it was too cold and i was in her class room. I went up to her desk and asked if I could borrow a pencil. She saidd no on the spot. Then my friend went up and asked to borrow one just to see and she gave it to her! But this isnt wat bothered me. Today she made fun of me in front of the other students and said I was failing Religion badly. I thought she was kidding and said wateva. Then It was kinda annoying me so I went up to her and asked and then she said that it was true and my mark was 50%. well watever i guess.:( ok so i care but still watever buhbi"

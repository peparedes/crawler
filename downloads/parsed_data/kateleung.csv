"event","Hey! My name is Katie Leung. Most of you probably know me as Cho Chang from Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. If not, you're really missing out! ha ha. Im only kidding!

I was born and grew up in Motherwell, Scotland with my parents, who are now divorced, my two younger brother and my one younger sister. Right now, I attend Hamiltion College in Glasgow and enjoy shopping, listening to music, spending time with family and friends and going to the movies.

When I was in line for auditions for Harry Potter, I actually thought of leaving. I didn't want to stand in line but 4 hours later, I had my audition. At the time I had no experience in acting or taken any acting lessons. I'm glad I did stay, because this has been the best experience of my life!

So, I figured I might share some of my favorites that have to deal with Harry Potter. My favorite book, of course, is Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. I dont only like this because I'm in the movie, I love the details of the Tri-Wizard Cup. My favorite character in the books and movies is Ron Wesley, honestly, how could you not love him? My favorite Hogwarts class is herbology and favorite scene of the movie is definately the Yule Ball.

I hope I didn't bore anyone. But I look forward to meeting and chatting with everyone!"

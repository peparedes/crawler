"event","I have four more reasons why i love new york city...middle school kids fascination with jinxing the subway cars, straight women playing queer eye hook up in department stores, gay men with i-tunes and air force ones, and NYFD trucks outside fine fare.

On my way to city college today i was sitting on the train with my headphones on when two hispanic boys in catholic shool uniforms and a white girl deck out in punk flava are goofin off by the train doors, next thing you know the train can't leave the station because they have dropped a pen in the groves of the door so the doors keep trying to shut and reopen. so they frantically yet nonchalantly try to kick the pen out of the door way. after about the 8th time of the doors trying to shut an off duty mta worker gets up to remove the pen... just as he reaches for it the penis hit by the doors for the final time and is catapolted out of the train. that 5 minutes wasted in the station was worth the good laugh i had when people stopped glaring at the middle schoolers beside me.

When in H&M looking for an outfit for my little sister i was in line waiting for my plainly gay cashier to check me out when a woman came up to him and said her friend was attracted to him but wasn't sure of his preference. Her friend was a guy and the cashier was inaterested... so i suppose there was a homosexual H&M hook-up today. i feel privaledged to have witnessed this triple H event.

On the train back from H&M a tall and lanky white guy with greasy and curly hair boarded the train. he had his i-pod on alon with spotless white airforce ones, old (and far too short) fish bowl boxers and a neon green knitted net tank top. this mans apperance was not the most surprising, the most surprising was this mans dancing, full out lack-there-of-ass shaking, hippjiggling and limb waving. the grinding on the subway poles was when i had to turn my head a chuckle a bit. This man gets off at my stop and this is where i notice his unmistakable gay strut. and somehow this explains his behavior...

So i make it out of the subway and to my left is a firetruck, I take a moment to look for the emergency. i expected to find someone passed out on the pavement of something but instead i see at least half a firehouse of firefighters in full uniform doing their grocery shopping. not random at all.

so this is why i love the city, entertainment everywhere."

"event","<P>Well I am home. I absolutely loved being at the beach. </P>
<P>I left Sunday evening, the day after Graduation (which still hasn't sunk in.) Sunday we drove half way, stopped in some little town where some of Elizabeth's family stayed and in the morning made it to Myrtle. It rained most of the time we (Kim, Elizabeth from North, Elizabeth's cousin Andria, and I)&nbsp;were there. we shopped, cruised the strip (of course) met up with friends, went to some clubs, hung out on the beach ( i am tan, thank the lord), drank (no, i did not get drunk), had to be rescued from the Bilo in North Myrtle, walked the strip, earned some mardi gras beads, laughed it up, went to a couple house parties, met some really hot guys such as Dave the 21 year old Marine who dances so-so but&nbsp;kisses like whoa, took serious amounts of pictures, mastered how to make jello shooters, swam, watched fireworks, ate... ate a lot, watched ppl get arrested, endured elevator smells, threw drunk ppl out of our hotel room, watched dumbass movies, and just had a good time.</P>
i missed my family, but now that i have seen them im ready to leave again ; )

i had no exams so i went to my brother's 5th grade graduation with my mom dad and little sister. They sang really corny songs with hand motions, but i got teary eyed when i thought abt how im gonna be crossing the stage and how i did the smae they weree, and how they have so much more life after today. it is crazy how young they are.

then my friends and i did some bikini shopping and dress shopping for beack wk and graduation... hours upon hours

Later Graduation Rehearsal. the longest part of my day, but i wont complain 'cause i am fucking graduating.

Eats afterward. after much texting during rehearsal we still couldnt decide on somewhere to eat so we ended up at Wendys (ole faithful) discussing topics completely inappropriate for the old ppl and children around us.

And then i ran aroung with Lisha for hours, and we caught up as we have needed to for ages. her guys issues, my guy issues, icees, more of her guys issues, lots of laughs. i love her

now i am home and have a calculus exam to study for, which i so am not going to study for. damn"

"event","I have a headache

the night started out okay but Dennis* is way to insecure around his classmates. dinner good, in the car good, actually at Prom bad. AND he barely danced with me and left me alone for long stretches at a time so he could wander (alone) and look stupid. I'm teling you, insecurity at those kinds of levels can be fatal. and we wont even mention after prom (PHS prom was 7 to 11) 

luckily i had a youth group meeting today and it inspired me. one thing mentioned was complaining and how it prevents you from furthering yourself. so i'll stop complaining abt this b/c he tried. but i have to say, i was desperately wishing i was with someone else. oh, one plus to the night was that i got to see certain ppl that i havent seen in forever, like Josh Powell. we ended up having dinner with him and his date and another couple. that took it back to middle school. 

i need to go to sleep now b/c again, i have a headache and i am just a little pissed off and very dissapointed.

one word...

Confidence

if you ain't got it, fake it

Prom was great, Anthony was a fabulous date. all the drama, bitching, and dress mess was completely worth it.

Sunday i got into a car accident (no comments on this please, i know already) but all was okay. no biggie other than the huge ass black scrape on my mom's car (the other car was fine btw, AND it was completely their fault) but monday my mom was ing the car fixed for something else and they cleaned up the mess i made completely and no one would ever know 
what happened.

27 school days left and i am totally drained, i have to choose a school, i hate classes, im frustrated with what i dont know, BUT the weather has been absolutely gorgeous.

oh, but today i went to dinner with my aunt and cousins (instead of study for Cal as i needed to be doing) and my aunt totally busted my bubble. she wants me to be a pre-med major and i dont fucking well want to do that. everyone has always planned for me to be a doctor (except my mom who tries not to influence my decisions in this) and now that i am showing an interest in something other than medicine ppl are trying to ""persuade"" me otherwise. i never said i wont go to medical school ever, i just want to study what most interests me and damn, shoot me for trying to persue something i would love doing all of my life. add to my shitty mood. andyhow, im ready to stop ranting now"

"event","My Grandmommy's bday is on the 21st, first day of Spring, and so today the whole family got together and celebrated. the things i learned this evening...

1. My Aunt Joan's macaroni will crush any other macaroni, mos def
2. three cakes are more than enough even for my large extended family
3. Four year olds cannot be trusted with a camera or in front of a camera
4. all of my male cousins are pervs and quite possibly gay, excluding Justin and AJ
5. i must keep all skin from exposure b/c at least 3 ppl will find a way to call something on it a hickey
6. a three tier piggyback ride is dangerous even with appropriate or not so appropriate padding
7. do it yourself networks will find a way to cause tension btw the doctor and carpenter of the family
8. ugly babies cry more than pretty babies, prolly b/c they know they are uglier
9. my dad's remarriage is awkward, not b/c it is his 2nd wife but b/c he thinks i am uncomfortable around her or i should be (he's beeen remarried for over a year)
10. life is way more boring w/o horney little dogs going after stuffed animals and little children
11. life is way more boring when Suki works late and i have to hang out with the toddlers for 2 hours
12. i should record the i dont know where im giong to college speech and where i have been accepted list to preserve my sanity and my voice
13. my grandmommy isnt very interested in gifts unless they are wine or coffee
14. flowers are awesome
15. my brother will find a video game to sit in front of anywhere he goes
16. my uncles will be sure to find a way to watch the bassketball tournament
17. many members of the family are tone deaf and cannot sing the birthday song in key
18. family will separate by gender and age lines into mini clans
19. i will always be worn out after family functions
20. my purse will be called out no matter what, chic and puertorican-looking tonight
21. we will never be on time 

i think this is enough, my brain is shutting off"

"event","So. 
Friday was really nice. I spent most of the day chillin around the house, eating leftovers, and then braved the mall. My god, someone help these psychotic shopping freaks.

Oh, i saw Brad Harris and AJ at ""eat mo Chikn"". just thot id throw that in there. maybe one day i will add why this is significant...

anyway, fri evening was cool. I FINALLY went to see the Incredibles with Johnny boy. It was absolutely awesome, through and through. and after sitting in the car for ages attempting to think of something to do in our rockin Winston-Salem, we went to the bowling alley where we ran into Nicole adn a few others. Jeez i missed her, such a good person. The three of us rolled over to Starbucks... John took in his guitar and played for us, we watched this girl get soaked in her vanilla latte, and heard her mom bitch. And then I saw Alex, who goes to West! (hes also in my APES class) yeah

so, since we are in Winston-Salem Starbucks closes at like half past 10 or 11 or something like that, so we went to Harris Teeter where John explored the ladies room, then we went to Walmart and sifted thru cds. 

i ended up getting home 10 minutes after curfew (which has been extended to 12 b/c ive been getting in on time, matbe i'll get myself back to the bliss of no curfew) but my mom didn't notice cause she was almost out... then agian, it may have been b/c she like john a lot... in not too sure how/why b/c she barely knows him... hell i dont know him THAT well. whatever.

anyhow, today was a blur. i watched a ton of movies, did most of my APES GROUP project, and entertained my little cousin. Any there is one more day off! YAY! i've got tons to catchup on (in school)

wow, any todays i have mentioned mean yesterday. time flies. I guess today really is yesterdays tomorrow

enough rambling from me, i ramble early in the morn, and i have tons of typos... please forgive

"event","I love Thanksgiving... i don't think i've mentioned this before. 

This yr i intended to make dessert (cheese cake.) i ended up doing the entire dinner excluding what our guests brought and the Turkey. (there is no way Gina is about to handle raw meat if she does not have to.) 

I made candied yams, some absolutely awesome mashed potatoes (if i do say so myself, which i do), collard greens (that I, one who refuses to eat anything healthy/green, ate), pumpkin bread, hickory beans, stuffing, cranberry sauce, mac and cheese, rolls, gravy, coockies, and finally the cheesecake. it was awesomeness. 

I woke up this morning at abt 10 when my cousin called and woke me up... the turkey was already done... and i was somehow compelled to cook. there you have it. i was supposed to go to our big family dinner with all teh extended family, but didnt get around to it. Apparently it was a memorable dinner with some serious drama; who knew my family had it in them?

My buddy Niea came down from Raleigh with her fam, they've just left our house, so Turkey day has ended. Ive known Niea since before i can remember and it was so nice spending time with her. we've got to do that more often.

well, ive got 3 days to catch up on hw and such things. do me a favor and distract, it will be appreciated.

peace love and happiness to ya all,
~G

ps: im thankful for everything (i know, vague, but im lazy)"

YOU GOTTA LOVE THE SOUTHNorth Carolina redneck passed away and left his entire estate in trust for his beloved widow. However, she can't touch it until she turns 14. 
Folks in Georgia now go to some movies in groups of 18 or more. They were told 17 and under are not admitted. 
The minimum drinking age in Tennessee has been raised to 32. It seems they want to keep alcohol out of the high schools. 
In Mississippi, reruns of ""Hee Haw"" are called documentaries. 
How can you tell if a West Virginia redneck is married? There's dried tobacco spit on both sides of his pickup truck. 
Tennessee has a new $3,000,000 State Lottery. The winner gets $3 a year for a million years. 
Recently, the Governor's Mansion in Little Rock burned down. In fact, it took out the whole trailer park. 
The best thing to ever come out of Arkansas is Interstate 40. <BR><BR>An Alabama State Trooper stopped a pickup truck. He asked the driver, ""Got any ID?"" The driver said, ""Bout what?""</lj-cut>

Why rednecks are not paramedics
A couple of rednecks are out in the woods, hunting, when one of them suddenly grabs his chest and falls&nbsp;to the ground. He doesn't seem to be breathing and his eyes are rolled back in his head. 
The other guy whips out his cell phone and calls 911.&nbsp;He gasps to the operator, ""I think Bubba is dead! What should I do? The operator, in a calm soothing voice says, ""Just take it easy and follow my instructions. First, let's make sure he's dead. There is a silence ... and then a shot is heard. The guy's voice comes back on the line, ""Okay now what?""</lj-cut>

"event","Fair Friday was awesome. Kim got me onto Top Spin the Fireball and all kinds of stuff. we did a spectaular job with cutting in lines too (god bless my gym class and the little freshmen, lol). Jeff and Ben learned to rock the cutting also. food firewoks a near fight drunkards and a swing accident. one of beth casey's friends fell through the floor of the swing ride. i think she's fine, it was a rough and serious fall though. my neck hurts though and i shall never get on the fireball again. OH and i saw Brandon and Nick and Leigh and Rhea and some other ppls i cant think of right now. And some random girl i dont remember but seemed to know me really well.
there was this woman (40ish) in line for the Musik Express with us (whom we cut in front of) who ran and threw herself on the floor for the loose looking girl's (20ish) cigarette butt (that had just been thrown in the dirt) you see all types at the Fair

Zonefest!!! absolutely awesome! I went with Ivy and her coworker Rachel. Ivy got to my house at 8:30ish and we gto to Subway to meet Rachel at 9ish. we got lost for a moment trying to follow Rachel's directions (we were in Greensboro) and ended up at the Collusium instead of the War Memorial Stadium (Bats baseball stadium) the ppl from VA were in there too trying to get to Zonefest so we ended up all attempting to figure out directions... hilarity ensues, (Ivy actually had expedia directions from the getgo). we name these ppl ""asswipe"" it was a very fond relationship we fostered. we had plenty of time thankgod. got a great patch of grass. got tanned/sunburned (me tanned, them sunburned... god bless my black and asian background) then got poured on (umbrellas werent allowed and there was a no re-entry thing but i went back out to the car and got the umbrella anyhow, got back in missed the mosh pit and slip 'n slide and then it stopped raining) we heard fantasteriffic music. the Brat Pack, Diana Anaid, Avion, GAVIN DEGRAW, the Pat Megee Band, SISTER HAZEL, Edwin Mcain, TOBY LIGHTMAN, BETTER THAN EZERA, and FIVE FOR FIGHTING!!!! 
i thoroughly enjoyed mtself. such a chill day.
There was a ton of drunk ppl as the day wore on, and then a shit load of drunk dancing (the shirtless black guy, the round red-haired girl, and the uber nerdy, uber skinny white guy)
We were there from 11am to 7:45pm. good stuff. i got a my shirt signed and pics, maybe i'll put them on here sometime... who knows!
im nery tired so i'll wrap this up
ummm
Oh, i saw Mack and Mandy and Catlin and Catlin and Monica and some other ppl.

MONDAY: Orchestra concert~ fabulous, very long, in two languages, very very long, underclassmen are really immature (i was never ever like that), a bit corny, personal stories very touching... not at all corny, seven dollars for 25 exposures..agh..im a bit pissed abt that, my mom and sibs came, thats a first i believe, umm what else? i had fun got donuts the next day 

The Next Day TUESDAY: umm good day, very chill, i bummed it. everyone seemed to be throwing things at me, kidney beans, tree buds, paper, etc. i had fun

WEDNESDAY: i dont really remember... hmm. i was very tired. I saw George afterschool. i threw the mouse aginst the wall and finished off, i was just a little frustrated...

THURSDAY: yesterday, i think something happened i cant really remember, good day i believe. OH YEAH, first Presidential Debate (held at U of Miami), i stayed up until 3:00 in the morn watching it and commentary and i drew a kick ass political cartoon, okay maybe not kick ass b/c it isnt really satirical but it is still funny and takes a shot at Bush and his truely shitty preformance last night. probably more to come on that. i got a little over 3 hrs of sleep last night, but i feel fantastic. i got 10 hrs Tues and felt like shit Wed, soo tired. Weird.

"event","This w/e was nice. Saturday i went to see ""Without A Paddle"" with Kasey and Brandon. Absolutely hilarious movie. Went to Waffle House after, i ended getting home two hours late (by my moms time, it was really an hour but anytime i get home late my curfew is suddenly an hour earlier than we agreed, whatever) And when i got home i smelled of ciggarette smoke, i know disgusting! my mom wasnt too happy abt that (i wasnt smoking btw.... lets just make that clear now)
oh, and my mom intended to ""ground"" me again. she's so funny. i was supposed to be on restriction Sunday so i couldn't go to our gun control debate meeting... well i did, it was good, AND i saw John working there (i haven't seen him since his graduation before the summer, yay!)
I am so excited, i got my Stereo back (you like how i capitalized stereo dont you?)umm, what else, oh Orchestra has a FREE concert tonight, 6:30 at Reynolds Auditorium, bring a friend. its a multicultural thing, again FREE. it's abt time for me to get to school. 

i'll finish this update later i suppose.

"event","Spirit Week was this week
Pep Rally was today
FINALLY got to sit in Senior section, woohoo!!!
Pep Rally sucked for the most part, missing Gym class was awesome and again, sitting in the Senior Area was FanTaBulous. 
Pigskin tonight, much fun.
Homecoming Court was great. Audrey Gauss and Ebony Hayes were crowned, all were beautiful. 
i guess this means im not really grounded, my moms been letting me drive , use the phone, internet, etc... i still dont have my stereo system back tho, nor do i have my cds... im trying to survive.
OMG, Lalani is back from the Philippines, i saw her tonight, she has graduated, im ecstatic!
I hung out with Alyssia, Brandon, Shanice, Clair Chen (on court), Alisha, the Sexy Seniors, all my buddies, all crazy, all out to have a good time, all had a good time.
My voice is gone, had a helluva time... tailgated a bit. won ten bucks. and got in free esentially b/c the man gave me ten ones back for the ten i gave him, eh whatever... my lucky night i suppose. so i came home ten dollars richer, yay.
I saw miss Ashton Taylor also, looking fabulous as usual... hey Dashielou
We won. 40:7
the Jazz band was great.
the litter was insane
i got to do the bump with Matt hill to some classic funk!

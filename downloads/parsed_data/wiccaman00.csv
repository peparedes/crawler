"event","Well not really sure what to put today it's been a rainy day <sometimes i hate the rain> other than that it has been pretty good. The last few weeks have been interesting.  I will no longer be employed by lockouts as of tomorrow. I start working for a locksmithing place monday at 8:30 in the morning. it's going to feel weird working only 8 hours a day and no more. it will be a good thing not to have to work 24/7 since i now know that i am not working there i will be able to sleep at night. which means i will have to be in bed by a certain time but at least i can sleep without waking up all hours of the night.  the only bad thing about it is that i will not have a phone anymore so ppl can't get ahold of me.  they will but it will be after 5 and all the other good stuff.  but no more stress of working all the damn time.
my relationship with crystal is going great i never thought it would be this good but it is.  the more time passes the more i like it when someone is there. someone i can talk to anytime i need <or can> with working and going to school it is going to be hard to do stuff like that. but i will manage hell it will be easier then trying to do it when working 24/7.

well my class starts here in a bit so i have to get off here but i will post more later"

"event","well as always president bush got what he wanted.  what about the other ppl in this world what about what they wanted.  hell i tryed to vote but apparently you have to go vote where your drivers license are registered.  hell i thought just as long as you were registered you could vote anywhere? apparently not.

but not much has happened within the last 24 hours except i might have a job working somewhere else.  <hopefully this is true> but other than that just the normal bs of everyday working 24/7.  i finished a book called gods debris that book takes your prospective and makes you think more and more and then some more on top of that it's actually a really good book it's a short read of about 130 pgs.  its really easy to read tho but it gets the old brain firing in a way you wouldn't think.  but other than that got nothing else to say until next time

"event","Damn, It's been a long time.  Well I have been too busy for words but I am working lockouts, way too much and I just started working at papa johns <Because I need the money>.  always fun.  I pissed everyone off in my life which isn't really all that unusual. To put a long story short I am now going back out with my ex-wife.  Yes It's true.  It kinda happened I started talking to her and after a few conversations <well about 2 months> it went to more. No I am not crazy.  It took alot of thought to get to where I made that decision.  But all in all I have spent the night in jail.  Because of a suspended license I didn't know about.  That was fun <rolling eye>.  So other than that I have been doing nothing unusual.  Been trying to get back in touch with reality.  But other than that trying to keep the peace in my life I just wish ppl could understand why I am back with Crystal.  Well it is acually kinda simple of a answer she lets me be who I am and doesn't judge me. Yes I know that isn't the only reason to be with someone there is more to it than that.  But that is another story.  well i hate to post and run but i got stuff to do 
until next time <which i hope is sooner than later>.
wayne"

"event","well i got my car back.  it's thunder over louisville and i am working.  but it gave me a good chance to get my website done http://dragonsden.faithweb.com every picture and link should work right now i thought it was going to take forever between working and fixing the site.  but i am enjoying the time being able to get my mind straight.  it's seems that thing have been a mess and now not so bad.  hopefully i can get back to school soon so i can get my degree i need to do something besides lockouts this shit is starting to drive me crazy.  but enough of that.......... i have been listening to meditation stuff and trying to get myself centered again it's really hard when you never know when you are going to get a call.  hopefully i can catch up on bills and stuff when i get my school check <one good thing coming> can't wait to be back in the classroom.  sounds weird but i have missed college.  hopefully i can meet some nice wiccans and we can maybe start getting together i miss my circle.  i wish you could come down sonya.  :) .  my back has been hurting me all day i think i slept wrong but shit i don't know. it  hurts is all i know let this pain leave me.

"event","the day has went along ok.  not working kinda sux ass but hey it has it's advantages. but i don't make money not working.  the car is going to cost me out the ass.   but i gotta have it to work but in the long run it would almost be better to fix the truck but i really wan to have both of them fix em both up.  gotta get everything going.  and i really can't wait to start back to school.  get myself out of college and into my field would be great.  but i would like to have my own business. but maybe i can work with jack and them if there business gets going.  i would like that to work among friends.  it's nice to have people in my life i can count on.  i would like to see jonathan sometime this week.  i can't wait to be able to see him next i love hanging out with him being his dad and teaching him stuff.  it is the best feeling in the world.  well enough ramble for now."

"event","all things are?  is this a true statement?  all our lives we wonder.  are the things we do right or wrong. would ""god"" agree with this? but i think that we live our life and that is the reason we have our own free will.  the only answer in our life is the ones we get answered at death.  so anything that everyone needs to know will never be answered.  out of the 28 years i have been on this earth i have learned what i can and still reasearch what i want to know.  so as the days go ticking away till my death i have nothing to do but stay true to who i am.  
     so who am i? i couldn't answer that question.  i know that i am a witch.  set in the old ways and have been that way for exactly half my life <14 years for those who forgot> do i fear who i am? no i accept who i am with open arms.  i do sometimes fear the people out there that don't understand who i am and want to do harm. the existance of such people are known and have been for years.  i do concider myself a rational person and look at things from all angles.  all my life people have wondered about who i am.  what i am.  what i want in my life.  all i can tell people is get to know me before you judge me you might be suprised and actually like me.  
      I could try and explain myself but i won't not right now."

"event","i have been doing research.  the stress of having a 24 hour job and trying to go back to college and having a 2 1/2 year old. but none the less someone pointed out something too me and i started looking around.  they noticed that in graveyards there have been alot of fresh graves.  i went to my hometown where there is a graveyard and found 23 fresh graves. being a small town this is very unusual to have that many fresh graves at one time and most of the graves where within a 6 month time period.  i think something is up with this i need to look more maybe the answer is in my dreams but i can't seem to remember most of them or if i so just minor details.   goddess help me remember and help me see."

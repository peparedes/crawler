i do grownup things now. i pay bills, go grocery shopping, write budgets, do my own taxes. but i'm not a real grownup. i still watch tv upside-down when no one's around, dance to silence, hide under the covers, lick chocolate off my fingers. i don't want that responsibility, i want to still have an excuse. ""she's just a kid, what do you expect?""

i expect great things. but not until i'm all grown up.

if i add up the hours of school, work, travel time, and eight hours of sleep per night, my week is overbooked by 2 hours. i've still managed to make time for project runway.

"event","a new beginning is quickly approaching. a rebirth, a fresh start, and no more crutches to lean on. committing to commitment. the honeymoon is over; two steps forward, no stepping back. and i can't wait. i've always been a fan of the buddy system.

remember back before we loved each other? those car rides when we didn't notice the radio was off because we had so much to talk about. how everyone around us knew we had something goin' on long before we did. back when we wanted to hold hands, but didn't know how. when we wanted to feel close to somebody, but not necessarily each other.

the butterflies have flown away, but what is left is so much better. i can turn on the radio and sing my little heart out without worrying what you'll think. both knowing that the joke is always on them. we can sit in a comfortable silence and argue without fighting. valuing the intimacy of eye contact. knowing the other well enough to know that each is still a mystery. 

the romantic stays disguised as a cynic for twenty-three hours and fifty-nine minutes of the day. but for a minute, right between waking life and dreams, for that entire sixty seconds the hard exterior is shed and the true form is revealed. what is inside isn't as resistant but it is much more sincere. be attentive; when the sixty seconds are up, a new hard skin has grown, impenetrable until that minute of vulnerability.

Maybe this feeling just comes in waves. During ""birthday week"" I felt very connected, very inebriated as well. I've lost something. Or maybe I'm in the process of losing it. Hopefully, I'll be able to find it again and it's not gone forever. Maybe it's just the free time, I've had a substantial amount of it this week. This is due to the change in my work schedule. Work's going well; I've got my own kids now and I love them dearly. I just wish they hadn't assed me out of hours.

strangely enough, i've been corresponding with a few old friends too. you can tell a true friend when you haven't spoken for weeks, months, years but when you do speak, conversation picks up just where it left off. it isn't awkward or weird. those are the best kinds of friendships.

it's easy to forget how things began, why they began. but it feels good to be reminded. i feel like i'm making the right decisions, proper investments. i'm not used to this positive outlook on life, but i'm liking the way it fits. school, check. work, check. love, check. family, check. i'm set, at least for today.

i'm oh so ready for the semester to begin. I get bored so quickly if i'm not being challenged. i've gotten through a few books, not as many as i'd have hoped. although, my time hasn't run out yet.

i want to go to prom. too bad i'm old enough to be a chaperon. everything meant so much more at sixteen. emotions were felt so much more completely. when you loved a song, it was with your whole soul; when you hated a teacher, it was to the bone. will anything ever feel that way again?

"event","<small> it's ludicrous how quickly people can turn on each other. silly. ridiculouls. pathetic. but should we really expect anything less? for most 20-somethings the world is a bubble. with ME in the center. it's the norm, and i don't frown upon it because, in all honesty, that would be hypocricy. but sooner or later the bubble will burst. and when yours does, i hope, for your sake, that when the light finally shines upon your eyes for the first time, it doesn't burn or make you go blind.

the costs are outweighing the benefits. and your value is depleting. no long summer drives; no freezing winter nights either. it has taken me far too long to conclude that you are probably not a keeper. it takes money to make money, but i'm tired of going broke. no matter how much i invest -- dollars, nickels, dimes, even pennies -- i'm getting no return.

my mixed metaphors and stupid similes, they ain't got nothing on what's coming next. sticks and stones? words are vicious, if you know which ones to choose. and i do. ""need"" is a strong word, (much stronger than hate). but i definitely don't need you. ""want"" isn't so strong of a word, but i don't think i want you either. you're just begging for excuses and i'm more than happy to give you one. close the book, heck, throw the book away.

control is what i want. of my life. sometimes i forget that i'm the only one that has ever been holding the reigns. everything, positive or negative, is my fault, and mine alone. once the reigns go lose, it's hard to gain control again.

intimacy. i miss it, the unspoken understanding and genuine care. there are some things that you just can't fake. the game of life is so much easier than the real thing. sometimes, i can't stand the voice inside my head. and how i think of the perfect things to say after the perfect time to say them. and how i can't help but dwell on every word.

i can't spend my life waiting. and i can't always get what i want. but i can't settle for less. maybe i can, but i just don't want to. the time has come for me to let go of reservation, fear, and regret. the world is changing with every blink of my eyes. alone, afraid, or in pain i still will be walking in this world. the beauty is in the struggle; the satisfaction is in the pain. rainbows and sunshine are pretty to look at, but it takes a little bit of rain for the grass to grow; and spring will never come until winter has passed.

"event","<small>there's a difference between being alone and being lonely. isolation is best when self-inflicted. otherwise, it will drive you mad. i don't know what i'm doing or where i'm going. i want ... i need something more. i need purpose. i need substance. right now, i have nothing. not even the words to describe this sense of nothing. complete and utter pessimism with no hope for the future. no future even in sight. i feel completely cut off from the world around me. with nowhere to go except down the long internal path that leads back to only me. just me. that's it. i do all the wrong things for all the right reasons and all the right things in all the wrong ways. i'm listless, unexcited, and uninviting. i put myself on a pedistal for fear no one else will. i hold my head up so high that i can't see who's looking down on me. losing touch with friends and reality simply because i don't feel like keeping up. lost track of where lies end and the truth begins.

i've got big things to accomplish, but i haven't got a clue where and how to begin. start at the top. get to the bottom of things. write what you know. and don't get left behind. just stop ignoring the elephant. potential can only get you so far. but what gets you the rest of the way? baby steps aren't nearly as small as how slow i'm going. you can't finish what you never start. and you can't do what you never think. i wish on shooting stars, hold my breath in tunnels, and think the number seven is lucky. cuddle with my cats, spoon with my dog, and talk to myself constantly. all i know is what i see but what if i go blind? i can't stand this single-serving solitude party of one with nowhere to go but to bed.

why can't i ever be positive?"

i turn twenty-one in less than nine days. this is definitely <i>not</i> where i thought i'd be in life at twenty-one. whatev. it does not matter how slowly you must go so long as you do not stop. confucius is my homie. there's just so much that i want to do. so much that i aspire to accomplish. but sometimes i feel like there's so much preparation that i'll never create anything of substance. i don't want to lead a selfish life. but i want to have made my mark.

i want to create.
and i want to create change.

it's time to leave this place. it's time to end this chapter. i feel like everything i say, i've already said. it's time to make new stories. find a new way. live unexpectedly. i shouldn't have a timeline in my head. life should be fluid. but i do and i can't help feeling like i'm living a vagrant life in comparison. it's a delicate balance. and a thin line. every line is thin. why aren't there any thick, obvious, distinguishable lines anywhere?

"event","<small> yesterday was so amazing and sad and fun and tragic. warped tour + vodka + 100 degree weather = craziness. no but honestly, i really am much too old for warped. i was basically there for saves the day and my friends. plus i don't like sweating.

  so this was my first non-san francisco warped. my thoughts: 1. hot weather fucking sucks balls. 2. mushroom-shaped waterfall things in the middle of a courtyard are awesome when it's hot. 3. yay for free parking when you're ""working for a sponsor"" 4. boo for the ""sacramento"" warped being an hour away from sacramento. 5. where in the hell is <i>marysville</i>? in bumfuck, california. that's where.

  so we bumped into butcher pretty early on in the day, which meant plenty of time on the sweet new (and air conditioned) bus. met catherine, who is such a sweetheart, by the way. a car-full of us took a joyride over to walmart. power walked in eagle-eye formation across the park with our heads down cause we're rockstars like that. bill then proceeded to over-compliment my car, which i found to be kinda funny. oh, and let me tell you - walmart was where the party was at. after dropping billy, cat, and sisky off, i proceeded to get wasted with tess in 2.8 seconds or less. missed saves the day's acoustic set, which i was kinda bummed about, but made it over to the academy acoustic set. we were hella drunx. and hella sweaty. <i>hella</i>.

  went swimming under the mushroom waterfalls and put on some more deodorant. once the alcohol started to wear off, we got tired. yes, we are <i>so old</i> that we had to take a nap in the middle of warped tour. depressing. i just can't keep up with the fifteen year olds. screw the fifteen year olds. i enjoy my naps. when we got up, we hung out with luis. watched/helped him take down his injury-waiting-to-happen tent. watched gym class heroes. they are <i>the</i> next big thing.

  my boys were the last band of the day. did some real catching up with tom and real bullshitting with mike during setup. there were fangirls everywhere backstage, even in the middle of nowhere. i loved the sharp glances whenever any of the guys would come over to talk to us. <i>loved</i> it. one amazing and emotional set. bill did his last thriller dance ever for us. sad sad sad. it was definitely the culmination of being undeniably extatic and proud for how far those boys have gotten in the two years i've known them, but utterly sad that things as they've been for the past two years are ending. the end of an era. glad that it happened, sad that it's over.

  after the set we admired all of bill's adoring fans. and i had a mini panic attack when joan jett came riding over on her bike. she's probably the hardest chick to ever walk the planet. eventually we made it back over to the bus where we hung out with our new friends, the guys in cartel, while the boys threwdown with chidos (aka herpedos). i was kinda bummed that they didn't have southern accents but whatev. in the midst of ""bus party"" chris conley comes strolling on the bus. everyone tried to play it cool, but he's an effing hero, so there's a silent gasp when he walks on. i had a mini heart attack this time. i later shared a pipe with said hero which makes me quite happy when i recollect.

  had to say one of, if not <i>the</i> hardest goodbyes ever. i don't even want to think about it. i couldn't even drive home. but some genuine, reassuring words were spoken. ... but the time has come to grow up. ""scene politics"" are too much to deal with. but who knows, maybe i'll end up on the other side of the coin."

warped tour round two in a few days.

running really does help. physically and mentally. it's probably more of a mental workout than a physical one. knowing i've got a quarter-mile more in me, and fighting every step of that quarter-mile, makes me feel more alive."

so i'm alone all weekend. sad, sad, sad. i think i'll take advantage and not wear clothes for the next couple of days. either that or refrain from showering.

i can't stop thinking that every decision i make is wrong. the ""what if"" game can drive you mad. but i kinda wonder if my choices even make a difference. success in san francisco, sacramento, la, new york, london, paris, casablanca ... it doesn't really matter where i end up. home is where i make it. i don't like forks in the road. i prefer spoons.

legs are sore from running. i'm good at running. closing. shutting. turning. away. my eyes. doors. my back. being, seeing, doing, feeling any and every thing that is negative.

why do people lust for fame? i used to when i was younger, but i just wanted to feed my adolescent ego. but why do grown 19, 20, 21, 22 year olds lust for fame? is it out of desperation? i understand when a person wants to do something that can result in fame (acting, music, fashion etc.), but to just want a famous face ... it's pathetic and almost repulsive to me at the moment. maybe ""repulsive"" is a harsh word. trying to be less judgemental. starting to think that empathy is a road to pity amd judgement is a road to hate. hate takes too much effort. why waste energy on hate when there are so many other productive things we can be doing. besides telling someone that you pity them probably stings a bit more than telling someone you hate them. pride, it's a bitch.

i want to take my own advice. i want to pick myself up by my own bootstraps. i know no one else is going to do it for me. i give the best advice. i know the right things to say. i knock sense into people. can't i do it for myself? i see all this potential and i just don't want to live out my life in vain. enter doubt. enter fear. and i just want to cover my head with a blanket. stick my head in the sand. put on a set of headphones. tune the whole world out. control my playlist cause i can't control my life. ignore you and everyone else.

i haven't slept yet. i would like to. but now there's too much. too many birds chirping. too many beams of sunlight sneaking in through the curtains. too many cars driving by (that are most definitely driving too fast). too many thoughts running through my head. i think i'm overwhelmed."

I could write about a boy who dissappointed me a great deal. I could write about someone that I once looked up to, but have recently lost all respect for. I could write about seclusion, betrayal, lust. but I'm not going to write about any of that.

in other news, I think I've figured out some of my educational goals. I'm thinking I want to transfer to berkeley to do a mass communication major. but it sounds like it's extremely hard to get in the department. that on top of the competition to just get in to the school is, well, a lot. english at ucla? another high-demand major. we'll see what happens. I won't be transfering anywhere for a while. sweet - I got pushed from 12th to 3rd on the waiting list for my summer class. I'll be pretty pissed if I don't get in. yay for some sort of plan.

school's almost over. good. i wonder what i'm gonna do all summer. hopefully, something fun. i'll probably end up taking that marketing class, but it's online so that doesn't really count. birthday plans thus far -- lake tahoe with dad, hawaii with tess, vegas/cruise to mexico with mom. and i decided that i'm throwing willy a birthday party at dad's house. it will be funnnn. june 25th. be there.

i don't know why i do these things. in the cover of darkness we give in to our most horrible desires. but once the sun rises, our true faces are revealed. and everyone's got skeletons in their closet. maybe i just have a few more than most.

rekindling old friendships is good. patty is the shit and i'm glad that after seven or so years, we picked up right where we left off. i'm hoping we keep this going strong.

"event","<small> i've been having some minor pains in my hip and i finally decided to go to the doctor today to get it checked out. so today was my first time visiting my new doctor since i moved here, hence, i had to arrive 5-10 minutes early to fill out paperwork. 10 billion pages of my address, phone number, and emergency contact information repeated over and over and over. why can't i just write it once and then you photocopy it? 

twenty minutes later, i'm doing the weight, temperature, blood pressure crap (holler!! i lost five pounds) with the nurse. she asks me about my ""injury"" and says ""take off your pants the doctor will be in in a minute"" as she walks out. found it kinda entertaining. wish things in my private life were that easy. take off my pants, in comes a man (preferably a doctor). anyway, doctor comes in rubs my hip and lower back a bit. makes me lay down, moves my legs around to twelve thousand positions going ""does that hurt? ... does that? ... how bout that?"" makes me take off my shirt, stand up, bend over. 

verdict: i have minor scoliosis. so the doctor gives me two pieces of paper with drawings of exercises to help relieve the pain. tells me to do the exercises and if the pain continues they'll recommend a physical therapist for me. so i pretty much paid a $5 copay to fill out paperwork, see a doctor who felt up my back, thigh, and butt then gave a free show while doctor ""checked my spine"" oh and before i left, doctor asked me if i needed a papsmear and told me to set up an appointment on my way out.

"event","<small> i can't help but feel betrayed. but you can't lose something that isn't yours. stop trying to find happiness in other people. you've got to find it for yourself before you can have it with another person. and i'm far from either. maybe i'm starting to find contentment with discontentment. am i selling myself short or am i just a realist? maybe it's not possible to be happy with life. maybe we can only be happy for moments. maybe we should never <i>be</i> happy with life. there's always room for improvement. and why settle for mediocrity? maybe i should be glad that i have those moments of happiness.

i hate being ignored. and i hate not having the answer.

happy day without an immigrant. if i was at home i would have gone to the march. but at least i was a non-consumer. big ups to those who actively seek change.

i feel like i'm in hell. not because of my self-loathing emotional status, but because it's fifty million degrees outside and mom is an air conditioner nazi."

"event","<small>maybe my problem is that i never stop and stand in everyone else's shoes. i'll start to try. maybe not <i>every</i>one, but at least <i>some</i>one. there is no one to blame for my situation but me. maybe i'm not the only one that's hurting. and maybe i inflict more pain than i ever thought i possibly could, without even realizing it. hopefully it really is never too late. he envisions love and hope; i only see pain and loss. i am too weak to be his cure. i'm an addiction that he doesn't need. what would i do after our ultimate failure? there's no recovery. i can barely stand leaving the way that i did.

it was 92 degrees fahrenheit today. i had a garlic cesar salad and strawberry soda for dinner."

"event","<small> i copped out and upgraded to a sponsored+ lj. shit, i'll do pretty much anything non-money spending to get more user pictures. haha. so then i made like eight new icons. and had a grand ol' time. watch for all of them in entries to come.

i took a seven hour nap today.

i've noticed that i'm always kinda grumpy for my last two classes. i've figured out why. a) coffee caffeine is on empty and i'm burning out b) i have an hour break and in that time i think about things/people that dampen my spirits. made me realize - internally, i'm quite negative. that shit needs to stop. but i am caught up with school. i'm even ahead in two classes. which means i win at life.

i have the new taking back sunday and thursday albums. i am happy.

in this moment, life is exciting."

"event","<small> bruv and erin came up tonight. we went to this crab shack place for dinner. it was effing sweet. we had to wait like two hours for our table. but in the meantime everyone got super-drunk off of margaritas. hilarious. bruv fell asleep at the table with his mouth wide open while we (and all the waiters that walked by) pointed and laughed. oh yeah and we went to this candy store cause we got a flier saying that they were giving away free samples. when we got in, we found out that you could sample <i>anything</i> you wanted, just as long as you ate it in the store. i probably ate about a pound of candy. lol. it's the most amazing store i've ever been in. too bad i couldn't eat any chocolate! dammit.

i had this mad-crazy dream last night that sisky was my drunk uncle. i woke up laughing, hysterically. it was so freaking funny that i had to tell him about it as soon as i got up. he also found it crazy-funny. he told me about his trip to japan. i'm hella jealous. japan sounds amazing. i hope that whatever i end up doing with my life, i'll have the means to travel.

question of the night: if you could go to any city in the world, where would you go?
top three cities: 1) venice, italy 2) tokyo, japan 3) sydney, australia."

"event","<small> i've decided that i'm going to stop caring about people that don't care about me. it may be easier said than done. but it might be as easy as not keeping in touch with the people that don't keep in touch with me. love, any kind, is a two way street. and i'm done being the only car on the road.

i'm sad. i just found out that i won't be going back home tomorrow. which means a) i won't get to see maria <i>again</i> and b) i don't get to see tess before she goes to hawaii. fucking lame.

today was an ideal day to go to the beach. 75, sunny, low winds. too bad the closest beach is like a hundred miles away. i hate living in this city.

i'm gonna go write or read or something. get away from this damn screen."

"event","<small>the past few nights have been sleepless. my mind has been restless. girls are complicated. boys are simple. girls are biologically made to over-complicate/analyze things/people/situations. and guys to simplify them, break things down into pieces. so where does that leave the heterosexual couple? a man and woman can never fully understand each other because the world is so different through the other's eyes. thus, relationships are made for failure, monogamous one's are, anyway.

the new head automatica stuff isn't that great. but the new thursday stuff sounds amazing. new thursday, new taking back sunday, new saves the day, new brand new. hello sixteen year old jenn. i'm twenty-one year old jenn. i've missed you. and your music."

<small>the next time i cut my hair, it will be like this. then, i'll let it grow out ... maybe.

i have an interview at forever 21 on wednesday. back to being a retail whore. but whatever pays that gym membership, right?

so, i was thinking about it, and if i took a class or two over the summer, i might be able to apply to transfer rather soon. that'd be, well, nice. ugh. back to a lab. and math. boo. haha. hello berkeley. how are you this fine day?

i decided that i'm going to look into the sacramento community theatre. i'm out of practice. and doing the simulated patient stuff at uc davis gave me a small enough taste to crave more. i need some sort of creative emotional outlet.

i had a pretty shitty week. i put myself in situations that do me more harm than good. i'm as high as the moon when i'm with you. but as soon as you're gone all i have is a reminder that you're not here. spring break will be my turning point. i've got a week to get all this bullshit out of my system. it's time to fucking grow up and get this shit that i call my life together. i always used to have a plan, but now, when having a plan is essential, i'm lacking. i over-analyze everything. it's time to stop thinking, make a decision, and act on it. who knows, maybe southern california will be calling when berkeley's done with me.

i'm happy for you baby, but i don't want to know."

"event","<small> i enjoyed myself this weekend. i love going home. there's something about the city that just ... i dunno ... touches me in a way that no other place can. party, party, party. in that order. mad hangs with old friends, made new ones in the process. got to be exactly where i wanted to be with exactly who i wanted to be with. it's pure naivety loving you the way that i do.

the babies are getting big. they're not babies anymore. where did the time go?

dee takes her driving test this afternoon. i'm so nervous for her. i hope she passes. then i'll have a permanent designated driver. holler.

midterm week is awful. hoping that i make it through unscathed. there is the light of spring break at the end of this tunnel.

novel ideas are stirring. subplots. changes in narrative. thematic elements. motifs. usage of symbolism. a possible title even popped in to my head. it's promising. but i'm scared too. writing what i plan to write will be an emotional roller coaster; i'll be rehashing emotions that i've buried far beneath the surface. i'll have to re-live so much of what i've tried to forget. but the pain and strife will be outweighed by the product. the beauty of tragedy is that it is so ugly."

"event","<small> i love, <i>love</i> that everyone's flipping out about saves the day's new album. they're relighting that spark that through being cool originally did, years ago, for so many kids. if through being cool and in reverie had babies, the result would be something like sound the alarm. i've missed them <i>three</i> times. ugh. i'm going to bamboozle, dammit.

ps anyone seen chris conley's pink hair?! crazy.

"event","<small> been listening to a lot of TGUK lately. probably cause tess downloaded like every single song they've ever recorded. haha. i've always listened to them a lot, i guess. so i've been listening to them a lot, a lot. why do people always argue about their favorite get up kids album? favi always gave me shit for liking on a wire. but then again, his word shouldn't matter much, he's got saosin on his myspace. haha. i crack myself up sometimes.

me and dee went to see throwdown with nick on sunday. haha. freaking funny. he was there to see the black dahlia murder, some nasty metal band. i can deal with hardcore music, sometimes i'll even enjoy it, but damn, i don't like nasty metal. i wore my academy/slayer track jacket. haha. it was a semi-enlightening experience.

i applied to, like, twenty-five jobs today. when i get a job i will:
- take tess to bamboozle
- get a fake id for tess' birthday
- buy my sweet camera
- go to disneyland with dee
- get orange, green and red bumpers for my sidekick
- get a touch screen ipod off of ebay
- get a brand new ibook
- buy lots and lots of stuff that i don't need but i want at the time of purchase

hopefully i'll make some sweet moolah ... or not have to do much. i'm pretty ok with making eight bucks for standing around and eating candy for six to eight hours a day (i applied at a candy store in old sac).

funny thing about tour that i never wrote about:
how i was referred to as ""jenn, you know, the chick with the pictures of pete's dick on her sidekick"" for an entire night. and then asked by several of the guys to forward the pictures to their emails. haha."

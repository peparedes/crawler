"event","so its been a while. I think u ppl can realize who i was talking about in my previous entry. Starts with M, ends with L, and a y in it. so a shit load of bombing have been happening in spain. I swear to god, if they cancel our trip, just fuck i dont wanna think about it. back to this girl. Shes a lot taller than me, a few inches though, not like 2 feet. Shes not godzilla ppl. Shes definetly smart, shes in pre-calc honors. Also quite the athlete, volleyball varsity star. I dunno if its me liking this girl, or volleyball actually being a fun sport to watch, but i had fun at those games. anways. this girl, chicita, is i guess the popular one. now normaly i hate popular ppl because, well they are popular for all the wrong reasons. Its like a smack in the face when someone has all this attention and you get none even though u are true to yourself. But not for her. Its nothing like that at all. its not like some other ppl. God, its like when ur popular, ppl think u are one fucking rad god for rubbing your tummy and patting your head at the same time. they kiss ass and are like ""wow who taught u that, u must now collin farrel, only hot ppl have that kind of skill). Its sickening to watch. i find it funny that this one senior was once a much less popular duckling and david was friends with her and nice to her, now she doesn't say squat to him. nice guys finish last rite? Oh fuk im ranting again arent i? sorry. I just needed to get this out of my head. anyways on to more pleasant things. so this girl, popular but not in that hated way. Shes a bit the opposite of my in some ways. Outgoing, smart lol ( im not the brightest), and pretty. I know, they are the typical things ppl say about the ppl they like, but think about it. If its realli sincere, then it actualy means something. And I am sincere about this. I dont wanna be pessimistic or anything, but lets just put it this way.....no. just no. nien! (is that how u spell it?). Hmm how sad, i can sing silent night in german but i have no idea wat the english words are. O well. anyways i gotta go. I tried to make this quite the homage to this lovely sophmore, but again i have failed to make a worth while entry. I will someday i promise. until then

"event","ok so its been a while since last update i suppose. Musical auditions have started lol. We are way behind schedule since a shit of load of ppl are trying out. Which frankly some of them dont have a chance. They are just doing it for a sports credit and unfortunatly in this case, you actually need some fuking talent so, but still i wish some of u the best of luck, except the freshman girls. We could do very well without them. anyways im gunna try my best. A livejournal first, of this journal that is. An entry about a girl. I dunno if i should say who. But this isn't the first time ive liked her. I'll be going to Spain with her and thats all I'm saying for now. anywho i kinda have this awful habit of getting nervous around some girls who i think are realli pretty and sort of shy away, avoid eye contact. Not all the time, but for this girl, i dunno y. I think she's gorgeous, specially since she got that cut and dye thing. I dunno i just think she's awsomely awsome, and pretty. Of course i always kinda make things worse cuz of being nervous and thus i come out as goofy and akward. Its awful. Hopefully something will be able to mend this mess i have made. More on this later. below are some honorary title lyrics.


Cut Short 

When I said you looked good baby
I was thinking possibly or maybe
We could head back to your crib
Not where I live you see
My situations quite sad
I'm still living with my mom and my dad
But really I'm going places
Even though I'm seeing three of your faces
Please, God, let's not resort to mini-mall parking spaces

Encounters with police, with my hands in the air
Encounters with police
Why ask if you don't care

I just had no idea that this would be lasting for just one single moment

I just have to say, you look so goddamn good
I give you crazy mad props, because I know I should
OK, I'm a bit intoxicated, but really I just graduated
And from where my hands are situated
Obviously, I'm growing more and more infatuated
Just wait, please wait

We could be like onions and peppers 
In a sleeping bag fajita
We could be anything you want
The way you're busting out of that wife-beater
And I know it's a bit uncomfortable here in this 2-door seater
But you're just the right size, 
And I will always feed you and feed you and feed you

If you were driving next to me
Say, on the LIE
My eyes would become so engaged
I'd float unconsciously
Into the HOV
Kill myself, the guy in front of me
His inflatable passengers of one, two, or three"

"event","i saw the honorary title last night alongside yellow second and francophone. holy shit that was awsome. There were like 50 ppl there. Sorta like a private concert, it was sweet. The bands interacted with crowd a lot more as a result. They all told jokes and hung out in the audience. If u have yet to attend a concert, u are seriously missing out. Unless of course u have no passion for music, well then i can't help you. I dunno wat else to say, they made my night, alongside Conan Obrian, he is my hero too. but yeh support them people. And for u damn ppl who need something substantial other than my word, honorary title was on Spin Mags top 5 ""Hot list"". Support Yellow Second and Francophone too, support ur local bands as they say. o yea i deleted some of pics cuz it was taking forever to load on my comp, in case ur wondering.

"event","as i read the script for guys and dolls, it became more obvious that i have no chance for a main part what so ever. I am boring, So dancer it is. Which isn't bad. Got me thinking of this convo i had with katie fier during dance of how lonely it is to be an only child. She's not an only child but is the youngest so is the only child in the house. Sux though cuz she is a senior, she will be leaving soon. But its finally good to hear that i have something in common amid this garbage that is the dawson community. Not everyone of course, but still, le garbage i say. And by something in common i mean someone finaly understands me a little more at this place. Maybe cuz its midnight and the night somehow makes u feel sad, but watever. this is lame im out. here are some more pics just cuz. first one is the band im goin to see tomorrow. Rock on. second/third, two pics i found on myspace.com

"event","hope u enjoyin the new livejournal. its thanksgiving break and it fukin rocks. i played a lot of halo 2 today and had a guitar lesson. It didn't snow all that much, an inch or two. Im am super stoked for the musical. Everyone should come! it will be in like 3 months lol but still. it will be great. Its kinda hard to screw up Guys and Dolls and with someone like kieffer (our wild theatre director). I'm gunna try for a main part, nicely nicely johnson or something like that. But if that fails (which it fukin will cuz he type casts, i have no hope) i will be a dancer. Thats kinda the reason y i decided to join theatre dance, so i could do that, cuz last year it looked like a lot of fun. and when i say theatre dance, i mean like jazz swing dance. I think more ppl are starting to realize that u dont have to be gay to join a musical, which would answer y there are like 20 guys trying out while only 8 last year. Now of course i dont care if they think its gay in the homosexual way, i hate it cuz when they say gay they mean that plus that its bad to be homo and its something to be made fun of like being ugly or dumb. Fortunately that is starting to change in all the grades EXCEPT MINE!!! Again, i am the only guy in my grade to do the musical. but o well. I was listening to the frausdots and the part of a song called soft light caught my attention. Ive decided that if i ever find a gf at this hopeless school or anywhere else, these words are dedicated to her

Turn off the water
Close the curtains
Flick off the soft light if you wanna see me
In the morning lies will certainly be dancing across your face like an angle

sad to say ive never woken up to a person i have been deeply romanticaly involved with but soon, soon. Ha ok. To top it all im gunna leave u a pic of one of my favorite bands, the Stills. SO yeh, enjoy."

If Your Child is a Gothic, Reform Through the Lord! 

Listed below are some warning signs to indicate if your 
child may have gone astray from the Lord. 

Gothic (or goth) is a very obscure and often dangerous 
culture that young teenagers are prone to participating in. The gothic culture leads young, susceptible minds into an imagined world of evil,darkness, and violence. Please seek immediate attention through counselling, prayer, 
and parental guidance to rid your child of Satan's temptations if five or more of the following are applicable to your child: 

-Frequently wears black clothing.

-Wears band and/or rock t-shirts.

-Wears excessive black eye makeup, lipstick or nailpolish.

-Wears any odd, silver jewelry or symbols. Some of these include: 
reversed crosses, pentagrams, pentacles, ankhs or various 
other Satanic worshipping symbols.

-Shows an interest in piercings or tattoos.

-Listens to gothic or any other anti-social genres of 
music. (Marilyn Manson claims to be the anti-Christ, and publicly speaks 
against the Lord. Please discard any such albums IMMEDIATELY.)

-Associates with other people that dress, act or speak eccentrically.

-Shows a declining interest in wholesome activities, such as: the Bible, prayer, church o! r sports.

-Shows an increasing interest in death, vampires, magic, the occult, witchcraft or anything else that involves Satan.

-Takes drugs. 

-Drinks alcohol.

-Is suicidal and/or depressed.

-Cuts, burns or partakes in any other method of self-mutilation. (This is a Satanic ritual that uses pain to detract from the light of God and His love. Please seek immediate attention for this at your local mental health center.) 

-Complains of boredom. 

-Sleeps too excessively or too little. 

-Is excessively awake during the night. 

-Dislikes sunlight or any other form of light. (This pertains to vampires promoting the idea that His light is of no use.) 

-Demands an unusual amount of privacy. 

-Spends large amounts of time alone.

-Requests time alone and quietness. (This is so that your chid may speak to evil sprits through meditation.)

-Insists on spending time with friends while unaccompanied by an adult.

-Disregards authority figures; teachers, priests, nuns and elders are but a few examples of this. 

-Misbehaves at school.

-Misbehaves at home. 

-Eats excessively or too little.

-Eats goth-related foods. Count Dracula cereal is an example of this.

-Drinks blood or expresses an interest in drinking blood. (Vampires believe this is how to attain Satan. This act is very dangerous and should be stopped immediately.) 

-Watches cable television or any other corrupted media sources. (Ask your local church for proper programs that your child may watch.) 

-Plays videos games that contains violence or role-playing nature. 

-Uses the internet excessively and frequently makes time for the computer. 

-Makes Satanic symbols and/or violently shakes head to music. 

-Dances to music in a provocative or sexual manner. 
-Expresses an interest in sex. 
-Masturbates 
-Is homosexual and/or bisexual. 

-Pursues dangerous cult religions. Such include: Satanism, Scientology, Philosophy, Paganism, Wicca, Hinduism and Buddhism. 

-Wears pins, stickers or anything else that contains these various phrases: ""I'm so gothic, I'm dead"", ""woe is me"", ""I'm a goth"". 

-Claims to be a goth. 

If five or more of these apply to your child, please intervene immediately. The gothic culture is dangerous and Satan thrives within it. If any of these problems persist, enlist your child into your local mental health center. 
~St. Mary's Catholic Church

....well that was interesting. I'm not goth but i definetly eat cereal and wear t-shirts with bands on them. So i guess that would make me the devil incarnate? y ive never had such a lovlier compliment...goddamn church ppl."

Gary Jules, ""Mad World""

All around me are familiar faces
Worn out places, worn out faces
Bright and early for their daily races
Going nowhere, going nowhere
And their tears are filling up their glasses
No expression, no expression
Hide my head I want to drown my sorrow
No tommorow, no tommorow

And I find it kind of funny
I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I'm dying
Are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you
I find it hard to take
When people run in circles
It's a very, very
Mad World 
Mad World 

Children waiting for the day they feel good
Happy Birthday, Happy Birthday
Made to feel the way that every child should
Sit and listen, sit and listen
Went to school and I was very nervous
No one knew me, no one knew me
Hello teacher tell me what's my lesson
Look right through me, look right through me

And I find it kind of funny
I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I'm dying
Are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you
I find it hard to take
When people run in circles
It's a very, very
Mad World

"event","well bush has lost. And well if u can find a single country that actually supports bush let me know im wrong, cuz last time i checked everybody wants to kill that guy. And i actually mean 'the people.' u retards. Not the prime minister of england. Which by the way, i believe he supports bush because of an alliance and he honors that. There is also some other kind of dirty deal they have between them. And by dirty i mean illegal and shit like that. But anywho...yes i feel robbed. How could Kerry loose buy that much. I think kerry should make another speech and be like, 'no matter what, may our country flourish. and by the way...""OHIO U SUCK!! KISS MY ASS!! I'M TAKING AWAY ALL OF UR FUCKING KETCHUP BITCHES! AND JOHN EDWARDS! U WOULDN'T DARE U SAY? OR WOULDN'T I??BET UR SORRY NOW! MAUAHHAHA...OH AND BY THE WAY GO TO WWW.BACKAFTERDAWN.COM BECUZ THEY ARE AN AMAZING BAND. IF U THINK OTHERWISE THAN I'LL RAISE TAXES ON UR ASS. I AM STILL SENATOR. GOD BLESS, AND FOR THOSE OF U WHO VOTED FOR ME...FREE KETCHUP AND...HMM I DUNO I'LL FIGURE OUT SOMETHING COOL. A FREE TRIP TO AUSTRALIA. WE CAN ALL CHILL THERE WHERE IT WILL BE SAFE. GOOD NIGHT AND BLESS... 

by the way, if i ranted on bush supporters i didn't mean too. although i dont understand y u would support bush, i respet ur decisoin, although i dont like it...k ya so peace to bush voters, and all voters. Except for those putas who voted to ban gay marriage. perhaps we can put texas's old electric chairs to use, but using them on ppl who voted to ban it.. the respecting point of view doesn't apply for bastard fuckers like u ppl. i dont give a shit if im politicaly incorrect. just....fucking eh'. anywho, sorry if that was a little hmmm i dunno. I just needed to get shit out of my head....go to www.backafterdawn.com and go to download.com and download their songs by typing in back after dawn in the artist thing...do it, or else i will be forced to start writing entries on how wonderful bush is. dear god dont make me do it ppl..just check it out at least. mmmk later..

p.s. Last minute chance for social D fans or fans of punk/rock in general...concert tomorrow and i have 1 ticket..I swear this concert is like cursed. No one can go at all. k yeh leave a comment or something. the explosion will be there and i guarantee their music will make u instantaneously head-butt strangers and metal scream 'ROCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!' oh and same for tiger army..and social d of course...xiajen(good bye in chinese i think...fuckin eh' this makes no sense at all)"

"event","I just learned something, CU has a bowling alley in their student center! CU is my hero. I nearly won some money but that stupid guy from fairview beat me buy 5 pins or something, but at least i kicked Tu's ass. And as how i came to CU at 1 in the afternoon, no i didn't ditch school. Choir went there for this workshop and some other shit (as long as i get to miss school). And just note im in there the same reason DC is in it, i want to improve my singing, choir can bug the shit out of me. After all, THe Herzchel Experiement is invincible on drums with brox behind the pedals. Double bass pedals RULE! And guitar shouldn't be too hard, stephen is a good bass player. But vocals is wat always fucks everything up. They either can't hear u or u sound like shit. SO yea, but i think DC more so cuz he's got a battle of the band thing at the Ogden (go ppl, there will be some great bands there im sure.)So yeh, CU was fun, I went to get some shit to eat and bowled with sarah, ryan, and tu and some ppl from fairview. Ryan told me about this thing similar to livejournal except cooler, called myspace.com Its pretty cool, u can post pics, play songs on ur website, have graphics in ur bakground and all sorts of cool shit. And its free. Its perfect cuz when i get an 8track i can record songs and post them. So i might switch to that, and if i do i'll post the new site, not sure that anyone would care but yeh. anywho if anyone is going to Green Day let me know, or social D cuz my friends bailed cuz they have SAT the day after, so yeh. Or if anyone wants to join me. ha ok. im out, necesito dormir."

"event","well, yo voy a ir espana. Im heading of spain march 25 i think, somewhere around that. Its gunna be muy divertido, i know it. There probably will be situations i will have to choose my host family over a party or something fun, cuz in espana they are all about la familia, but there will be ample opportunities and its all good. Im more worried that my spanish is gunna suck ass. But if its one thing ive learned ppl generally are realli nice and enthusiastic when u try to speak in their language. Which is cool, but then again they could be asses about it and make fun of u, then u can just tear them up in english, no curses to be safe cuz everyone knows fuck and shit and words like that. But anyways yeh, i get to take a bullet train! yES! those things are awsome, well they might just be ok but it will be one of those cool things i say i did in Spain, yeh. Most definetly gunna check of football, haha. Makes more sense to call soccer football, hmm watever. Only 4 ppl are goin, which is a good and a bad thing in some ways i guess. 1 guy (me) and three girls (stella, elizabeth, meryl). All cool ppl. I think ive got probly 20340304000 times ppl saying i better get some, shesh, how shallow. Sure i might try and hook up, im a guy and they are all pretti, can u blame me? But yeh. Only like 2 ppl are going to switzerland. MORONS! ITS SWITZERLAND! its great there, just use our friend albon for an example. And plus its a safe and relaxed place, u can like just walk around town by urself, its great i kinda miss that, from taiwan and switzerland, and lots of other european countries, although u can do that in boulder kinda, but still its different. Its practically being an adult, u can go where ever the fuk u want, go to a resturaunt and eat out with friends, then go over to a cd store, buy some viynls, and in spain they have flamenco clubs where u can chill and drink and eat, then go bak home and chill with host family and do hw. Well this is mostly in switzerland, as b4, spanish ppl are very family oriented, i gotta stay in the house for the most part. Yeh u can drive and do watever u want but everything is concentrated, everything is near by each other. Its different even though it doesn't seem it, u gotta expereince it for me to make any sense. and as for hw, Yes, its cruel, they make us do school work while we are over there, but its ok cuz our grades are frozen but if we dont do shit and not even try they can make us come bak, and that would blow. Yea if u ever go to europe, go trekking or just live cross country for like 2 or 3 months. During the summer or something. I promise it will be the best time of ur life. But yeh, only dawson ppl (not everyone at dawson) would say no to go live in the swiss mountains and ski/snowboard. Although by the time u get there u have like 1 week b4 they close probly but hey, u can't complain. But yeh, 10 weeks. In other stories, the tickets for Social D are mine! Finally! i tried like 10 times to get them, but they were supposedly sold out. THey just hold tickets and release more the closer the cocnert is. I dunno y, but i guess its so ppl like can buy them. I always do shit at the last minute. I am a procrastinator. But u must admit nothing in this world would get done if it hadn't been for those last 5 minutes. Its a fact ppl, God is God, he can snap his fingers and the world can be made. It took him 6 days and on the 7th hes like fuk this shit im taking a break, gunna get myself some mexican food.(y else do u think they love jesus so much....just kidding, dont take that seriously, im hispanic so i can say it, i guess, i dunno watever im a fuck, but bak to the story, as god was saying. Ppl must now bask in my greatness. (Sorry to those hardcore christians who find offense in it, but im not the one who hates ppl for being who they are because god says being gay is a sin. I dont give a fuk who it is, i dont hate anyone or think they are an asshole/slut until i see it for my own two eyes cuz its easier being nice to ppl and making friends that way, plus that is wat i would want someone to do for me. But yeh I dunno, the whole 'these ppl are bad because i say so, i need no reason becuase i am surpreme',well thats something Hitler did, Aryans are surpeme and rest are infidels that need to be dead, just saying its corrupt in a religion that is supposed to be spiritual. Explain the priest and catholic boys? hmmmm, creo que no!! sit and chew on that mind candy. Ok but with that aside, (random clutter, get used to it) Social D will be kick ass, the explosion and Tiger Army are there and they are pretty good. Unlike the get up kids, god dammit did they suck or wat david! Well speaking of such, how bout that ashlee simpson thing? As i could rant on about how anyone who makes $75,000 for lip singing should die, its more important to focus on the problem of it over all, not just that she did it that night. Cuz ppl do; think everyone, u can't dance and sing that well at the same time. I say, well stop fukin dancing 5/6 songs. Thats wat dancers are for, if u realli wanna show ur talent (and some realli do, like usher, just my opinion), then actually make it a dance routine, not just a filler in for the song for entertainment sake, u and ur amazing voice and stage presence should be entertaining, not the flame in the background, although still very cool, i wouldn't mind that. but Just one of my beefs with the whole issue. If u have to lip sing because u are dancing, then just dont dance every song at least and sing them. I dont care if u not moving isn't entertaining to the 10 year old girl in braces, shit many ppl can pull it off, Frank Sinatra anyone? Shesh, whether an artist is good should be judged in these ways including, there probly more but i gotta sleep, i dont have time: live shows (how good they realli are), albums- their musicality and lyrics, not being a sell-out, and their message they try to convey in their music. Yes, i have not made multi-platinum albums so some may argue i cant critique them, but if we dont, wat will stop them from puting little to no effort in music and getting away with it? If we dont critisize, how then will we keep ppl in check, making sure they do their best. I mean, ppl get all kinds of shit at normal jobs, y cant celebrities?? Do u honestly think someone who hasn't gotten their food for over 2 hours can't complain because they have never been a waiter b4? NO!!!If it weren't for grades for example, no one would do the hw or study! Maybe that will help. Again just my beef, i just dont think its fair when ppl who work just as hard get paid less, when they had to go through college, sustain a family with living on a budget and raising kids, all that. I used to love gift bags until i found out they give them in value of excess $1000 to celebrities. CELEBRITIES! WHY THE FUCK DO THEY NEED FREE SHIT!? I want free shit! Which is y i actually like the idea, cuz sooner or later i get free shit. But that only happens when ur like 3, u get a pencil, candy and a cool magnet for a bday party when ur like 6. But its good, im not angry i dont get free things, im angry THEY get free things. Wow that got side tracked. Ok so point being, yes ashlee simpson did lip sing, but instead of bringing the awareness that many other ppl do it too, they are just focusing on her, which is valid cuz she shouldn't have, shes a fucking singer, she gets paid more than anyone should ever get just for singing 1 show. Maybe less ppl will lip sing in fear of getting caught. Yes these views are biased, but it scratches at me greatly. Though it may be a hard life, if u realli do love music u will learn to cope with it. Much like a wife and husband. Cuz realli, when it comes down to it, although it may be the worst shit on earth, the hardest thing u have ever had to do, when nohting made sense or went ur way, nothing can break ur passion for something (if strong.) If u hold something that close in ur heart, it doesn't matter. And if these celebs hate, then maybe they didn't like making music as much as they thought they did. My cousin joined the marines, he knew it would be hell, and that he would likely get shipped off perhaps, but he had a passion for courage and defending this country in any way he could. U may think celebrity life is hard, try living the marine life. Just saying, everyone has a right to complain and have someone to tell it too, no matter how petty it is, because when someone is in need, they are in need. I dont give a fuck wat it is, they need help. Everyone needs a helping hand. So yeh, hippie message for the day is help one another. U would be surprised wat it can change. El mundo necesita amor ( u know its true, stop saying its cliche)"

"event","well winterim selection day has drawn neigh, and still no word if im in spain. Im a little agrevated since meryl already found out. We called them, no response. We looked in the mail for the letter we are suppose to get b4 tomorrow, nothing. But in other cases, the election is in about 2 weeks. Tons of cars in school have the whole kerry bumper sticker going on. Ppl are talking about it during break and so forth. It seems most ppl dont realli like either, but their hatred for bush is strong, so they are thus pro kerry. Well although that makes sense, i dont think its right that it should come down to that, the one u hate less. Some facts i learned from teachers and other resources i think are important into aplying who u wanna vote for or support if ur not old enough. The US is the largest consuming country in the world, yet we are not the most populated, not even close. The number #1 health threat is obesity. We are also the richest country, who has the death penalty in place. Countries who also have the death penalty, Iraq (hmmm, interesting), North Korea and another Asian country near tailand i believe, and 2 other middle east countries. As before, we are the richest nation on this earth, yet Cuba is better at providing health care for all, due to their organic farming which is cheaper, the life expectancy is somewhere around 80 i believe. Not only that, the minimum wage is lower than it was 35 years ago.  And if u combined all the money spent on military funding in the entire world, every single country, i mean every single country (not including US), it wouldn't even come close to wat the U.S. spends. In other words our military budget is greater than all of the countries combined. I dunno, but i find these facts disturbing. Are u telling me fucking Cuba provides health care for everyone and we dont. The country we forced into starvation through our trade embargo (which pretty much prohibits trade with cuba, and cuba doesn't have a lot of natural resources so they were fucked big time, but the embargo is lessening a little), the country that use fucking cattle to plow the ground is better of than us health wise? Yes less mouths to feed true, but the US is the richest fuking country in the world. We have more than enough money to give everyone health care. Or if we dont, maybe we should consider donating some of the military budget to healthcare. I dunno, but it seems there is a better use for money. We do afterall have the most surplus of it in the world. And for those of u, who would argue ""We are the US, we have many enemies, it is necessary or they will get ahead of us and nuke our country."" Hmm i say to them, well wouldn't life be easier if we had less enemies or enemies who didn't wanna nuke us. Ironic that we are the only country to ever nuke a country during war. More than once in fact. There are always natural enemies of a super power. But these enemies dont want their land back, they dont want to get away from heavy tax burdens, they dont wanna throw down the government and institute their rule. This is not fucking medieval europe. So y then do so many ppl want to see the destruction of America. If its not out of immediate threat, not out of necesity, well then its simply we are looked down on. We are hated like people hate each other. U may disagree that the majority does not hates us, but u are then again american. ur biased is the equalness of a parent defending its angel child. Everytime i told ppl i lived in america when i was overseas, they gave me a bad look, others less severe than others. Not every single person, but i can't remember not having a bad look, whether it be disrespect or something else. Yet when i met with friends who were rich or parents business ppl, they were friendly. Now of course many countries would never contribute to terrorists, not because they dont believe in terrorism against americans, but they are scared shitless. IF they even help the terrorists, they will be invaded and bombed the shit out of. Which if u realli think about, is necessary because as the worlds super power, we are also the most vulnerable. But we can't inspire so much fear that ppl dont give a shit anymore and start a world rebellion against U.S. which unfortunately has happened, not out of fear but out of anger. But fear leads to anger so it is the same thing essentially. 

So the point of this being, is to vent out my ideas, and to force change on ur country. Dont just think john kerry or george bush are like machines who simply performe specific functions, so thus u must pic the better machine. Force change on to them, if bush is re-elected and puts limits on stem cell research, riot dammit. Riot like the fucking vietnam war only 10X's more the rage. The protests did work after all, it took some time but they worked. Dont just think because this candidate believes in this thing they will never change it. Cuz after all, protesting is contagious. Once Martin Luther King started the peaceful protest, the striving for equality, it was addictive among his ppl. Thousands joined. How could they not?! This was their country and they wanted change. So in summary, dont be so partisan, be a fucking american and change wat u dont like. As for many bad things of the US, it is also a completely fair statement that we do the world good. However unofortunately it doesn't get acknowledged as much thus, we could do so much better but because we dont know wats good for us, how can we keep on doing that and improve on it. I would name so many good things of the US but it would get way to  fucking long now. Point being, be an active society. And although it is widely assumed that i am one person, wat difference can i make. Well u can make a big difference especially when 20 million ppl share the same ambitions, goals, and views in mind. Eventually, someone must answer the phone, no matter how long it takes. We are with our flaws as we are with our pros. However viewing the flaws as something that must be acted upon by killing ppl i do not in my mind jthink is ustified by any means. Although i obviously see y so many middle eastern ppl are signing up for terrorism, violence is not the answer. Because fighting fire with fire, well eventually both of the flames die out. Maybe Bush doesn't realize this since he has never been to war, or has had a fight against all odds. After all, he did spend like half or 1/3 of his presidency at a fukin ranch. Im not saying anything, dont wanna turn this bi-partisan because then this could go all night. Because the Bush administration couldn't think of any other way to help the Iraq situation, because u couldn't come up with anything, because the worlds leaders couldn't come up with something, doesn't mean for a SINGLE MINUTE, that there was no other option. Its like a bunch of children trying to grasp the concepts of Quantum Mechanics. Those select will never suceed, but that doesn't mean there is no possibility of it happening. Always be an optimistic. Life is easier when u are. Well, with all of this in mind, it may change the way u think about the candidates and many other things as well."

"event","might as well update. Well, i thought that by now i would feel comfortable at Dawson and find my place, sorta find out wat to do. Used to (and sometimes still do but not to severe degree) have the 'feelin sad n' lonely and nobody seems to care' thing ruling my life. First you pretend like nothing is wrong cuz god forbid ppl think ur a loser right? Well you get over that quickly when u just get tired and u dont give a fuck anymore. After taht well, i dunno. U just feel stretched. People either dont know wat this is like, or think ur one of 'those' people. I dunno anymore. Think ive made it clear being at dawson isn't making me the happiest person. Nothing ever seems to make sense. Im sick of hearing im shy, cuz im not. It may seem that way but im a laid back guy. Just give a while, im not such a bad guy, or boring. And for proof im not super shy, ive had to make new friends 5 fucking times and introduce myself to them every single time cuz ur 'guide' for the day doesn't do shit. They ditch u, much like shadowing. I am a little shy i will admit that but not so much that i can be personified as shy. Im much like the underdog who which the team has no respect but ppl realli know deep down that hes a guy to be mentioned. Unfortunately there is a shortage of these people. Ok well i have a lot more to say but i gotta hit the shower and then bed, crap its like midnight, o well. Late start. This post is dedicated to ppl who feel like me or have been judged b4 ppl actualy got to know the real person, and ppl who are simply down and feel like crap. 

post script-(thx for that kurt) check out www.backbeforedawn.com, its this band in texas. friends bro is in it. They are pretty good. Look for them."

"event","hmm well either i have a case of social anxiety or ppl reali do just not like me and think im a loser. Pretty insulting since none of them realli know who i am. Pet peve i think of mine and im sure of many others. But it bothers me especially cuz i have experienced things they will never experience and they think they got me figured out. Dammit now is when i could have used a mentor, but alas hes training to become americas bright future. yes dan smith, he got into westpoint. Pretty cool. Hard to get in. But anyways yeh, i just dont care anymore. There is only so much i can take. To say a little about the dawson kids, im the only guy going on the spanish immersion and john is the only guy going to switzerland. Kinda gives u an idea of how lame ppl are. All they wanna do is go to hawaii and lay on the beaches, no real commitment or danger in the unkown sense. Not knowing what its gunna be like from day to day. THey are cowards if they dont do it. Hopefully that will paint a canvas. I mean come on, ur grades are frozen for 10 weeks. U HAVE NO TEST OR HOMEWORK OR PROJECTS FOR 10 FUCKING WEEKS!!! MORONS! they gotta live more and not be embarassed about things and stuff like that. Its great, thats probly the reason i get non stop shit when i dont know the smallest detail of random bs and it sux, cuz although i clearly have the better argument they are all bitches and side up, and are to immature to face the fact anyway. Im not taking it personal sometimes, but grow the fuk up. Not to mention the slandering of my country China and Taiwan in 9th grade. I know wat racism is and 1 word for u....frustrating. Oh and this is heads up to those of u who dont know this...Saying bye or giving a high-five/hug to someone right next to another person u know and not doing the same to them is quite the kick the nads...OMG WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT?!?!?! Ok im taking my steam out on my lj and its probly starting to sound whiny and boring. So, to a new subject. Back to Spain, y not. It can't come fast enough. I will be let down if i dont go, cuz that means i have to stay at dawson for that time. I wouldn't be surprised but still, WTF! I'm definetly gunna bring mi guitarra a Espana. Maybe that will help break the ice with the ppl there. Even if it doesn't, those of u who play guitar know what i mean that if i go without playing guitar for a long period of time its unberable, it sux. Its like not listening to ur music for 10 weeks. For me atleast. and i read this other live journal, i couldn't tell who it was cuz my computer went all crazy and jumped to a random journal, kinda freaked me out. but i was able to read some of it and it was about society and religion and control to say the least. Bravo to whoever wrote that. Thats kinda wat im going through u could say since im kinda in that 'fuk dawson and everybody' mood. Not literaly everybody but yeh. I know wat ur saying man, or girl. But im most definetly thinking guy.Has to be someone i know or knows somebody i know cuz how would it know where to go without link or things like that. Yeaaa. So to conclude this epic poem, im taking on a new atitude due to the fact that i hate dawson more each day, i realli wanna go to spain, props to the person who wrote the entry, and its midnight and i have not done my english or math. And it feels great. Ciao, adios, and fuck u very much. O yea shit, check out backafterdawn.com they are this new rising band based in texas. My friends bro is in it and they are pretty good. Support them and check it out ppl. later....o yea sorry for sounding bitchy, im just kinda worked up rite now. I think im gunna post pics when i learn how...

"event","school sux monkey balls. but wat else is new. Did my interview for spain immersion. To be honest i wouldn't be surprised if they didn't pick me. A little disappointed at that, but we will see wat happens. Im not saying if i think i got in or not because that always jinxes it. Going to Spain should be fun though, a lot of challenges no doubt but no one has realli said anything but good things about it so yeh. I wish i spoke french so i could go to switzerland. Living in the swiss alps, doesn't get much better than that people. Yeh so im gunna ditch the whole update everyday cuz i can't bring myself to do it. Although when i find out how to post pictures on here maybe ill do that. I should get a 35mm black and white film. That would be cool. But back to immersion. I would be gone for 10 weeks which is a long time. THe people that have applied are elizabeth, meryl, stella, sydney, and me of course. I think theres someone else but i can't remember. I have no idea what spain is like, ive never been there but according to DC he said ppl there have their hair and clothes perfect and they eat lots of ham..hmmmm. Well anywho i wouldn't be leaving for Spain until like april or something i dunno. THe week b4 spring break i think. Nothing better than leaving dawson. Im sick of ppl here. I think its already established that im a loser at my school but its dawson......yeh im sleepy..ciao.

"event","its only been 1 month of school and im already tired in every way. I dont know why. It just sux, hard to explain its just sort of that feeling u wish school was over by ur 2nd class. I have spanish 1st tomorrow. Im starting to despise that class. Specially the little group of mr lewis, brox, and alex valin are forming. They always talk about something to do with Israel or jewish related and kinda just alienates the class out. i dunno im just down. Im kinda starting to wonder if brox and everyone else kinda thinks im a loser. I never realli thought about it cuz we played guitar alot but now that we haven't he kinda is less friendly, not that mean but i feel kinda lonely. Steven picked on me ALL during dance theatre, it sucked cuz i got sick of it and everyone else started to. I know why he did it and hes an ass. It rained today which was awsome. Rain is cool and it canceled our match. I know my feelings about school rite now are kinda vague and whiny but surely someone out there must understand my point. School can wear and tear u. lots of ppl think school is easy and a little hard at times, well they obviously dont face the problems many of us have faced. And it sucks to cuz there is no solution to it, just like trying to argue the right answer with 4 ppl against u, it just never works..well time to fall asleep to the raindrops"

"event","hola..well im pretty glad this week is over, cuz it sucked and just wasnt much fun. I'm starting to dislike theatre dance. wish i could switch into 6th period but i have english. O well. Half the school is at the Story of the Year and Lost Prophets concert. Well more like 30 or 35. Brox invited D.C. and didn't even answer me when i asked him if he was going. Kinda makes me feel like a loser on top of this spirit club they have with coach cox. They like talk about it infront of me and ask alex valin if she wants to join and not me. that stung but wat o well, nothing i can do realli. I could ask and they wouldn't say no but they would give me annoyed looks alot most likely. and that shit just makes me feel uncomfortable. it doesn't matter. i got this new cool journal thing to write songs in. Im gunna start actually writing songs rather than just random riffs. Probly wat im gunna do all nite. cant fall asleep. now that coffee house is gunna be once a month i gotta get on it, lots of performances to do. maybe i should dedicate a song, ive never done that. it would probly be a coffee house first, but we'll see. ill get back to that one later. Spirit week starts monday. Should be great, except not. Super Hero Day is the only cool day. The rest are a little lame but bravo to our all female council. THey are actually make homecoming better, which isn't saying much but its still better. i dunno, dawson is that place where ur parents are happy to send u for the good education and stuff but other than that everything just sux. Everyday i wake up im like shit, school. Not a very cool way to start the day, but thats wat music is for. To get u in a better mood to last the day. Too many crapy things to list to make this week suck, but at least its over. i think a lot of ppl at school have an overall consensis that im a plain loser. y else would they not realli talk to me much or invite me to places like they used to. i dont care but they are probly rite. ima go and strum mi guitarra. adios...honor to che guervara.

"event","well its been a total of 2 weeks of school. not sure wat to make of this year. homecoming is in 2 weeks, damn that was fast. it wasn't realli that fun last year so i dunno..unless i get a date im not going. and better not cancel at last minute like prom. it would be nice to have a date though. truthfuly i dont plan on asking anyone at this school (cuz this school sux!) so getting a date probly wont happen but w/e. choir with elliot hell. im glad im not a tenor anymore, cuz everytime elliot would tell me to sing louder or that i suck at singing. Im pretty embaressed on the subject of singing, so that kinda made me feel crapy easily. Im gunna switch into 3rd period. other than that class i got a decent schedule. i saw Garden State just b4 leaving for alamosa. That movie rocks. go see it ppl if it is still in theaters. indie movies get pushed around by the big blockbuster ones. but after that movie i felt something mixed. the love between the two characters kinda makes u feel good inside and the whole indie feel of the movie got me relaxed, sort of inspired. Cheesy or cliche u think but im trying my best. anyways gota do hw. hopefully this year will be better..im trying to sum up all the courage i can to perform infront of the whole highschool for community, we will see. i'll also try and write more and update, ive also changed the user info thing cuz it was lame as hell b4 and still is....later"

"event","haven't posted in a while...i dunno im not very good at this writing entry thing. Its probably getting lame already. But i'll continue for now even if no one is reading this. doesn't matter anyways. school is almost here. shit i hate it. Alamosa should be a blast. I get to help ppl and sleep in a church. My faith is weak in catholicism, strong in jesus, but weak in catholicism. Sounds weird but catholicism isn't jesus at all. He taught love and that was his signature move. I cant see jesus saying ""gays go straight to hell to burn!"" gays do not go to hell. THere are all these exceptions to catholicism. U can't have sex or u go straight to hell, but if u make a baby then by the grace of god u might be forgivin. WE are born with sin the minute we are born (thats my favorite one, how the pin guilt on u when u are 2 MINUTES OLD!!) And then we have loving is accepted, but loving same sex is forbidden! Sounds a lot like the law back in the day for african-americans..""seperate but equal."" a infamous exception to the law. So bottom line, catholicism moderates the human spirit, it surpresses it and makes u feel guilty and disgusting and tells u there is nothing u can do about it but god will save u if u bask under him. Sounds a lot like magazines, telling girls and guys even that they aren't good enough. Of course they dont fukin saying directly but they put beautiful woman after woman. So then ur definition of beautiful is set. U look in the mirror, u realize u dont look anything like them and tell urself u are fat, too thin, ugly. The minute u start to say that it is not u talkin, its billions upon billions of dollars put into making u believe ur are good, but not that good, or ur ugly but its still possible to become pretty. Sorri stole some of it form margaret cho, but i did think a lot since the presentation mr picc gave. holy crap..im out...signing off."

"event","hey..ok so like i said i would once in awhile  post some of my favorite artists and recommend them plus post the lyrics. Other than that, not much else to say. So here it is, the song is called ""You Get What You Give"" and it is by New Radicals. I first discovered them by watching their music video while i was in the philippines. This is a realli cool song, buy it off of itunes if u dont wanna buy the album but i recommend u do...ok im tired..later...signing off

here they are:

Wake up kids 
We've got the dreamers disease 
Age 14 we got you down on your knees 
So polite, you're busy still saying please 
Frienemies, who when you're down ain't your friend 
Every night we smash their Mercedes-Benz 
First we run; and then we laugh till we cry 
But when the night is falling 
and you cannot find the light 
If you feel your dream is dying 
Hold tight 
Chorus:
You've got the music in you 
Don't let go 
You've got the music in you 
One dance left 
This world is gonna pull through 
Don't give up 
You've got a reason to live 
Can't forget
you only get what you give 
Four a.m. we ran a miracle mile 
we're flat broke but hey we do it in style 
The bad rich 
God's flying in for your trial 
But when the night is falling
and you cannot find a friend
You feel your tree is breaking
Just then
(chorus)
This whole damn world can fall apart 
You'll be ok, follow your heart 
You're in harms way I'm right behind 
Now say you're mine 
(chorus)
Don't let go
We feel the music in you
Fly high 
What's real can't die 
You only get what you give 
Just don't be afraid to leave 
Health insurance rip off lying FDA big bankers buying 
Fake computer crashes dining 
Cloning while they're multiplying 
Fashion mag shoots 
with the aid of 8 dust brothers, Beck Hanson 
Courtney Love, and Marilyn Manson 
You're all fakes 
Run to your mansions 
Come around 
We'll kick your ass in! 
Don't let go 
One dance left 
Postscript: Championed by a soulless media misleading 
pople unaware they're bleeding 
No one with a brain is believing 
It's so sad you lost the meaning 
Never knew it anyway 
Human nature's so predictable 
I'm a fool to do your dirty work whoa, whoa"

"event","ive decided to voice one of my opinions on music. Well its sorta an answer for why mainstreem music can realli suck and be awful. And its a valid opinion. Some are cool though of course. Like metalica, no need to give a reason why they fukin rule, but on the other side of music for the hip&hop genre, ive taken a liking to Nas, he is a true music artist. But back to the point why so many bands are getting so much attention when there are FAR BETTER bands out there. 1, the record labels. The big ones are only concerned with not its talent, but if the aspiring singer has the looks and if they are wat the general ignorant public wants, aka they need money makers. Brittney Spears is a perfect example, i heard her sing on her las vegas concert i think, i dunno it was on HBO or something and i realli wanted to know how well she could sing since she has to sing at least one song without a recorded voice. I heard her sing live, no recorded tracks, and it was godawfull. Im not saying this to attack her, its the truth. She sucks. I dont have an opinion on her music since im not into it. ANd well if ur not into the genre how on earth could u possibly give an honest opinion on the music? I feel sorry for spears, she has officially been labeled a money making product. She is no longer a person in the eyes of the public. But still, she isn't a music artist, she is an entertainer. There is a HUGE difference but this post is gunna get too long, so another time. But i have no judgements on her. I dont know her personally. Sure the marriage thing is a little crazy, and she may be stupid and dress like a slut, but still its always best to give them the benefit of the doubt. She may be a cool person to hang with. Flaws no doubt but she is in a situation that a lot of ppl could not handle. Im not saying we should all listen to brittney's music or that its good, im just telling ppl to cut her some slack and stop juding her. Go and mind ur own business if u care so passionately about other ppl u dont know. Ok, for the second reason, it is because of music videos. You either hear about music from word of mouth, or see a music video. Well no need to say that they cost a lot of money to make, and only the famous ones make videos for the most part. Because with indie rock artists for example death cab for cutie, i haven't seen a single music video for them. Maybe its cuz their record label can't afford it. But anyways the overall view is the record labels control what you listen to in a way. If they dont give the record contract to the band, well tthey can make records. THe band may be able to save up money and make it themselves at low quality with average mixing. They put the records in small record stores where nobody goes since sam goody wont accept it for watever bull resaon, and thus almost no one hears about it. No music video and no word of mouth. Some bands do get word of mouth around, like the Gamits, a local colorado band. They are pretty good but i only heard about through word of mouth. Its sorta like making a movie known. If its a wide release well then its more accesible to the public, if its limited to LA and NY only, well yeh. Ok. sorry this post is awfully long, but its the way i write i guess for the most part. But anyways, point is music is loosing its quality these days and is being mass produced like bricks, but dont blame the artists only, record labels and you yourselves are responsible. After all, we are the ones who buy the albums. but i think im trying to say is that the reason mainstreem music is awful a lot of the times, is because that is wat record labels put in it. The dont care if the person is done deaf, the just want the person to be able to make them money. TO get a deal with pepsi and advertise. btw, they can get paid millions just for drinking a pepsi on national tv, fair isn't it? anyways if u need further proof look at william hung who i heard got his record to gold or something. He sold a lot of records. Considering he sang covers and it was awful. Hes a good man, just not a good singer. WOw that was long as hell. and to top it all im gunna post lyrics from bands i like. Why i have no idea, im just trying new things other than writting awfully long repetitive posts. so this one from pearl jam. and the song is called 'indifference.' Give me ur feedbak if u like em, or if it drove u nuts and u hate it. 


i will light the match this mornin', so i won't be alone
watch as she lies silent, for soon light will be gone
i will stand arms outstretched, pretend i'm free to roam
i will make my way, through, one more day in hell...
how much difference does it make
how much difference does it make...
i will hold the candle till it burns up my arm
i'll keep takin' punches until their will grows tired
i will stare the sun down until my eyes go blind
hey i won't change direction, and i won't change my mind
how much difference does it make
how much difference does it make..
how much difference...
i'll swallow poison, until i grow immune
i will scream my lungs out till it fills this room
how much difference
how much difference
how much difference does it make
how much difference does it make..."

"event","its been a long time since my last post. If i recall i would talk about a girl i possibly like but im not sure if i like her. She has pretty much all the qualities you would look for in a girl, but i dunno. I guess i'll have to see if i realli do like her, cuz last time i went for a girl i thought i liked, but just feel in love with their image, it didn't end up happy. So when i figure things out then i'll write about it..for now i will browse through the subject of family. Family is much more important than some people may realize. It can either destroy you or be just the thing you need to get through. In puerto rico family is everything. Also true for chinese but in a different way sorta. There is some kind of mystical bond family members seem to have. For the most part, family is something you can always count on. For example, my mom and dad. They are 2 people that i can always count on. 2 people i know will love me. We may hate each other at times, but its expected. Without hate how would u know wat love is? since love is the opposite of hate. But anyways yes, my dad visited from cali. Sorta sux that he moved but its cuz of job and i understand. I'm blessed enough to have non abusive parents. I'm not sure what realli to write, but just to simplify things family is something you truly can't live without. Whether it be your friends are your family or actual family family. Anywho not very wisdom like or insightful, but the greatest act of love is dying for someone. and i would gladly give my life for family. Just because i know they would do the same. ok kodac moment over. Maybe something regular. I've started running a mile everyday and slowly added distance. I'm at 1.5 about or something. Our coach wants us to be ready to run 3 miles on top of a shit load of other things. I hope i make varsity, its my last chance to hang out with some pretty cool people at the matches. Its sux that farber isn't our coach anymore. He was the shit. Hopefully this new coach wont be a physco. Vans Warp TOur is almost here. Im excited for that. Coheed & Cambria, flogging molly, and rise against are just some of the great bands to perform. I hate the new found glory is there. I'm not a fan at all. I've never seen flogging molly live though so that should be awsome. Probably gunna see ian or john there since they are all into irish punk and flogging molly. Which will be ok i guess, they are pretty decent people. I'll go with david and christian if they are in town. I went with them to the thrice and dashboard concert, that was sick. I also saw brox there and rumor has it that jenny wong a cohagon were there. Concerts are pretty addictive but i dont wanna end up like mr. fanz. Hmmm i hope hes still assistant coach. k im tired. Conan o'brian was good as always. i'll be writing a movie review soon, maybe even a book review. I'm reading this book by Roger Ebert. It was cool to see him live at CU..ok..and by the way i highly recommend the song im listening too right now which you will see under ""current music""...david gray is awosme..ok..finally relunctantly signing off from this amazingly dumb post......"

"event","as i contemplated what to write about, i thought about a lot of things. I though of a friend who i will not mention, mostly beause some of these opinios might change in time, and i have yet to decide wat to make of everything. Wondering wat they thought friendship meant. Because if my friend has the same definition as i am, i'd have to say they would be quite twisted, because they know they aren't being a friend. They are just being a person that knows me, and talks with me in a tone like its a hassal and boring. Someone told me not to stoop to my friends level. My view on it is that there is no level realli. Just if you have enough humanity in you to sacrifice and be the honorable one. Judging ppl ive pretty much gave up on for the most part. Judging ppl is ingrained in a lot of ppl. But im doing it a lot less. A lot has changed about me. Ive learned the true meaning, in my view, of some simple yet important words. Words like friend, the right thing, beauty, clife, and many others which i will continue to write as time goes by. But right now im starting with friend. I have no stone concrete description of a friend, except that a friend is something i am always happy to be and have. Now the friend ive been talking about, im happy to a friend, to help and to share. However my friend is not something i want to have. THe friendship isn't mutual. It pains me to think about it. It reminds me of the time in taiwan, where i had envited a couple of friends to hang out with me and see a movie the day i left for USA. The whole night i felt from them was, this is boring, alex is a loser. It was this feeling of death. When goodbye came, they didn't even want to hug me. So just for the sack of it, game them a hug and they left immediately. They said goodbye to me like saying goodbye to a cashier. It did some serious damage. Until then ive been careful and have been trying to find my little niche everywhere i go. THe feeling i had in taiwan is sometimes the feeling i get from my friend. I think this person thinks all a friend is, is someone who will stick up for u, and hangs out with u. Being a friend to someone is so much more. Not long ago, i had a talk with someone who i havne't talked to in a LONG time, Joy. I was already having a bleak day and feeling worn out. We started to talk and stuff, and slowly i began to feel at ease. LIke finaly, someone who will listen to me and has the same interests, a true friend to lean on, and not give me that vibe like your boring or yeh ur complaining about problems is stupid, go to hell, or just that empty word they give u. I dont complain like a child, unless its been bottled cuz ive had nobody to talk to about it. Example 1, i told a person how much it sucked that i felt so different from everyone at my school, how i didn't like the ppl there, and it was like a on sided conversation that contaiend words like 'ya' and 'oh'...it was real fun. It made me feel crushing that when i needed them they refused. The person was there alright, they just didn't see it as necessary. They might say sorry, but just so they could justify themselves, or say it just because your suppose to. Little things realli do count, for me at least. The convo with joy wasn't a life-changing experience or epiphany, but it was the simple beauty of it. It was a reminder of how awsome some ppl can be. Wish i had more friends like her. Not only is she still willing to keep in touch after 4 years without seeing eachother (o crap i gotta send her a pic..i totaly forgot anyways) in person, but the two years i did spend in taiwan weren't realli the friend bonding expereince. Its very vague rite now cuz im tired but i liked her during hte last year maybe, i dunno, so that made things odd. It was sorta funny we talked more when i moved then when i was actually there. Well anyways, to wrap this incredibly long post up, this friend i mention, well im hoping time will help, but i dont care much for it now. This person obviously doesn't care much for me, im not a priority. THe person hurts me. So the cheesy moral is the little things realli do count for some, and that a friend is something you can't define but rather a person who in aids and helps you in defining yourself And so thus, to lead a topic for my next post, i think im looking for friends or more so perhaps a friend and much more..keep tuned...signing off"

"event","que pasa mi amigos..my spanish is horrible..anyways i have decided instead of making the casual entry about a girl i like or everyday inconviniences (horrible speller too, sometimes) i will start writing movie reviews. I may not have the artistic eye or the cinematic eye or way of analyzing a film, but i promise it will be earnest and wat i am able to muster from opinions shaped by life experience etc...ok so for my first review i will be writing on the movie directed by Peter Webber, ""GIRL WITH A PEARL EARING."" A shorter film that ur average, running time was around 100 minutes- or 1 hour and 40 minutes, yet it wasn't a downfall. The reason why the movie was made short and in some senses uncomplicated, is this. If you try and imagine it any other way it would ruin it. Because this film was comprised of images. Colin Firth's character, Johannes Vermeer, defines an image in the movie as a picture made of light. Throught the movie the lighting and tones of the scenes do a good job of giving you that feeling of expression. Rather than focusing on the script, the movie embodies the term motion picture as the images show the story. Each frame is like a painting. I recommmend this movie and give it two thumbs up. I find it puzzling to give it 5 stars out of 5 or something like that. Because what then would be 5 out of 5. The best obviously but how do u know what is the best? I just find it more useful to ppl if i recommend it and give my opinion. They then can make of it as they please. So overall, no the love story was not 'when harry met sally' or anything like that. It tried to show a story and a message about art. We did not get to know this girl with the pearl earing (Griet, played by one of my new favorites Scarlett Johansson) in the way like ur typical movie. We do not see her grow up or start a family. But you take an instant liking to her, even though would logically appear mysterious yet due to the acting she doesn't appear mysterious. She is how she is. So again overall (wow i need to learn not to ramble on, i assure u this habbit will be broken in time) the acting is enjoyable as is everything else. Stick around till the end, it is the best part in my opinion. It was simple, yet moving. It gave the catharsis intended ( I will explain catharsis later, this post is awfully long now) So thats all, hope this was usefull. as always...signing off"

"event","ok..so last night i was watching lewis black: live on broadway. hes fukin hilarious. i realized he had many good points and solutions for the world..like making a class later in the day when everyone is fukin awake. anyways i was also watching the jimmy kimel show or however u spell his last name. The audience was prety much all female. They were there obviously for clay aiken. its sad how obsesive ppl can get. this 40 year old woman was confessing her love for him telling him how he had the perfect hair and lips and shit. it also got me thinking about 'friends.' dont ask my why..i have a random thought process. anywho it got me wondering why the hell ppl religiously watch it and think its the most brilliant show ever. in my opinion the jokes aren't even that funny and that pheobe person realli annoys me. Lisa kudrow is fine though, just her character. one show that kicks ass is last comic standing. No im not one otf those ppl who watches tv all the time. I watch movies a lot since if u hadn't already known, i love them. Some TV shows are cool like last comic standing as before. I can't remember his name but the guy that wears the white overalls, im rooting for him, the italian mafia lady, and the guy who one last episodes comic stand-off. The rest are realli funni too but ive taken up with those 3. no i dont have a solid reason but i dont need one. reminds me of writing history papers. dammit i hate writing history papers. Its all about proof and shit which is why i also hate geometry..at least some of it. I wish my school started later, im never awake at 8 in the morning. like lewis black himself said to his economics professor, ' listen prick, why the fuk are u having a class at this ungodly hour? what u wanna keep this shit a secret' ok fine not exact words but same idea..ok so thats all..signing off"

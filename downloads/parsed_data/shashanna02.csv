"event","i will start this off with good news : my cuz. had the baby, its a girl and they are calling her trista. his girlfriend (babys mama haha ) went through the labor without any meds!!! ouch! but i am happy for them. a new addition to the maloney family. 

latly i have been listening to sad music. i dont know why, but it really makes you sad. i find it interesting. as i said before i am very boring! haha. anyways so as i am listening to these sad songs, it makes you start thinking of all the sad things that are happening or happened in ones life. my current fav. sad song is ""spending my time"" by roxette.  but whats even better then sad songs, are angry sad songs. they make you feel better, in a wierd way. 

big disapointment moment number 1 million: 
parents cancelled my birthday party so they can fix the van. now keep in mind the just bought a new house! so no birthday party for me, but honestly not surprised. i have learned to no longer think they will ever do anything nice for me (aside from my car they got me, but i think it really helped them more then me...whatever).  the sad part is that this is like the smallest dissapointment they ever did. oh well what are you going to do. now i am getting a little angry because it sucks to think of your childhood as a disapointment. i just never think about it anymore, so i think it goes away... untill it happens again.  

 i feel an angry moment coming on:
well my first angry moment will be that i hate hearing stupid people get mad about stupid things. although i find it very amusing, its still stupid. i mean their lives must be so perfect that they have to mess it up so they feel normal. the cause the drama, deny the drama, but keep on runing their mouths. i guess i am happy that my issues are real, and i dont have to make them up, unlike some. i mean every has their sad story... but some dont, so shut up! i dont care, and please stop talking... i am way to cool for you (haha inside joke, sorry for yous who dont get it). also it makes me mad that i let people including my parents make me mad, it shouldnt bother me but it does. i mean maybe me being angry once in a while is good , even healthy... hmm sounds like excuses to me haha. but oh well i will keep thinking that. 

i think its ok to not like someone, and i think its better not to fake that you like them. i give poeple the most respect when they are themsleves. i would like to think that i am myslef all the time, but probalbly not. but at least i try. i dont try to like someone when i dont, i dont act nice to their face, then talk shit behind their back. but i guess thats how people are. i think you should have only a few best friends, because if you have a lot then how ""best"" can they be? but if it works, dont fix it. i do believe that honesty is the best policy. i think that it makes you stronger by hearing the truth good or bad. i cant think of anything that could be said to me were i would be soo upset for the rest of my life. i just dont get it. why are we so scared about what other people think? why does it matter?  who ever said it should? how did we get to this point in our lifes where our opinion about ourselfs is last. people can say, that i am mean or that i dont care about what i say, but all i am saying is the truth and i say it because i am ok with myself and i know that your words wont change me or my self opinion. i wish everyone was liek that. the world would be better in some small way. 

well i think i ranted on enough..."

new years was nothing really exciting. matt and i hung next door and had a good time for the most part. i learned something that night... which is, that i am very greatful that as bad as we can fight mine and matts relationship is very good, our worst of times are some peoples good times. i must say that i relized a lot of things on new years, i feel much wiser about people, i also learned to not care about most things that occure on water st. 

my birthday is on the 21st!! i will be 21 on 21! haha it makes me laugh.  i hope every one comes out. we are going out th. at 12:00 am. i think my cousins are coming out to party with me. it should be fun. i am really scared about going out though.. hahaha after seeing matt it can only be worse for me. i wish that shara and emily would be 21 too so they can go out!!!!! ahhh stupid drink age!

 good news: 
Jorden's band is doing well. they got signed!!! i am really happy for them bc they worked so hard. amd they are awesome.

"event","<P>well i am bored so i will update my journal. so far break has sucked. although, nothing good or bad happened, which means it was uneventful therefor was a waste of time in my life. although i was pleasently surprised that during the time i was home i was not yelled at and i didnt feel the need to run back to the apt. i am back at the apt. though, mostly becasue this is my home, even if it is lonly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>the job hunt is still&nbsp;in progress. i havent really tried that hard the past few weeks. i kinda like not working, but i think that if i&nbsp;had a job, not only would i have money, i wouldnt be bored all day. i went to go buy books today, but left empty handed because i have empty pockets. i dont understand why books are expensive, i mean if the&nbsp;teacher cant teach the material in class then&nbsp;what am i paying for. why should&nbsp;we have to buy books to read so we can learn when we&nbsp;have Dr.'s and Prof.'s there to teach us. i just dont get it. i have come to the conclusion that i will&nbsp;not give the book store any money, i rather buy online. for those of you who dont, check out the&nbsp;web site&nbsp; <A href=""http://www.half.com"">www.half.com</A>. its run by ebay, its very cool. </P>
<P>this past semester can be described in one word... interesting. i havent felt the feeling that i felt this semester since high schoool....&nbsp;mayber even longer then that. there are time when i feel the same as emily and just want to&nbsp;get the hell out of here. but i couldnt leave my good friends that are here, they out weigh the other retards i have to deal with in edinboro.&nbsp; i must say being around all of &nbsp;the drama makes me feel more secure about my self. im glad that for the most part my life is in order, well as much as it can be considering the fact that in a year and a half from now my future is undetermined. this semester also&nbsp;brought me alot closer to my friends. the best days here were the ones that consisted of five good friends drinking and bullshiting around a table. i notice that over the break i really havent&nbsp;bullshited about anything, well only to matt... but he's use to it. i hope this semester goes bettter, but if it doesnt i dont care, i had a really good time this semester ,considering.&nbsp; i also learned this semester that i shouldnt care what everybody is saying either about me or about other people. because in reality there are only a few people here that i really care about their opinions. and the rest i shouldnt listen to. i hope next semester is better... if not then i know the summer and next year will be awesome. </P>
<P>this summer should be the best! hopefully me, emily, jorden, and colby will all live to geather. it will be fun. and then it will get even better next year, when me, matt, emily, jorden, and colby all live in the house on erie st. we will have a pool table, a bar, which is currently in the kitchen, and a fooseball table ( i know most likly i spelled it very very wrong!) we will have like four couches, like 8 million Tvs, 8 million computers, two awesome entertainment stands (yes, we will have two), four bedrooms, two indoor porches, two living rooms, plus like a sun room thing. oh yeah did i mention that it is two houses away from the distribitior. and next to the bars (for the most part). and we all will be 21!!! bring on the fun.</P>
<P>this was probably the nicest christmas i ever had! and it had nothing really to do with the gifts. i didnt get any awful gifts this year (big plus). everyone in all four familys got along. matt was here the whole time (our first christmas when we were actually togeather). matt and i didnt do gifts yet because we dont have any money, which i think made christmas so much better because instead o fbeing excited about gifts we were excited about the actual holiday. it was nice. </P>

"event","im moved into my apt. and i  love it, for the most part. last night there was some shit going on with some people who decided to get into this huge fist fight, im not sure why. but i guess the one guy yelled he wsa going to get his gun, then everybody ran! the cops soon followed. everything seems calmed down now, but who knows, there are a lot of people who live in the apt. complex who think there awesome. 

all my classes are really fun and for the most part easy! although i am already withdrawing from a class (human bio.. AKA the devil!) i tryed but the teacher doeant teach very well, and he acts like we should know everything even though its a 100 level class.  i had emily, and matt help with it since both there major are science. but matt said that some of the info he is giving us is wrong or incomplete. which made me feel better, bc i knew that it couldnt just be me, since i have done well in bio classes befor. 

matt and i just celebrated our 4 year ann. on the 13th!(sorry matt, i fixed it) i cant belive its been this long. plus when you start thinking like when we move in togeather we will be dating for 6 years! we will hit 10 years befor we have kids (hopefully haha jk)! i hope we dont get bored with each other. i doubt that will happen, but soem marrages dont even last that long. matt might be getting a car which is great for him and a little for me. i wont have to depend on my parents for the last thing they hold me to.. my car! if things get worse with my parents i wont be stuck anymore! but for the most part it has been good news all around."

"event","well i havent written anything in forever. but nothing really exciting has happen. i cant wait to get back to school although there already is conflict with that. there is this guy named james!, who lived in my apt last year as well as this summer. he is an ass, and we all know it but still remain polite, anyway he continues to be an ass by saying he isnt moving out till 8/28. well when me and the rest of the girls went to sign the lease it said we can move in 8/10!!! and so once we informed james of this he decieded that his lease is up on 8/18 but he still isnt moving till the 28th bc he has nowhere to go. and you know what i say to that, NOT MY PROBLEM! i know it sounds harsh but keep in mind he is an ass. so i just called the apt mgmt. and im still waiting for them to call me on monday. ahhh! i wish things would be easy.

    on better news, all my furnishings for my room in my apt. where free!! oh yeahhhh. i am taking my bed and dresser bc my parents have decidied that i am not moving back in soo they are filling my room with exercising stuff (blah!) and got a desk for my loving grandma, and so now i am just wasting my money on stuff that doesnt make a difference such as cleaning products ( i have a cleaning problem haha). but i know the apt. is a mess bc james is incapable of cleaning anything. 

    matt is still living in the dorms, rose hall, he is not too excitited about that but he cant wait to see adam, his roomate. i am going to my first big concert its called warped tour and i am going with matt, josh, emily, courtney, and tish. it should be wonderous. well i guess thats all the excitment for now. wish me luck with james grrr!"

(wtf!?) talk about fear of commitment.. well its more like lack of money, job, house and you know all the other essential things that married people need. i cant wait i am soo excited im almost counting the days (nerd!) but whatever im excited!

     today matt and i looked , ok drove around, appts. its nice to think that someday we will be looking for real. but i think it will come faster then we thing. i plan on graduating college next dec. (sad face.. yet happy hmmm) but i still plan on living with my friends in our appt. so i wont need to come home untill the summer ehhh. it should be fun though bc all matt and i will be doing (besides work.. yuck!) will be apply for real jobs, yes after 16 years of school, and $40,000 down the hole, we can each get a job that pays more then $8. and find us a place to call our very own.... besides the fact we wont own anything ohter then the stuff we bring. but still fun times!"

"event","well school is out for summer!!! which isnt such a good thing because i really miss my friends.(sad face) but hopefully the summer will go fast and we all will be back as the group and having fun. the worst part is i think they might be mad at me... i hope not because i dont know what i would do without them. im sure once everyone gets back to the boro things will be good. my summer so far has been eventful. matt and i just got back for visiting bryan and jessica (his brother, and his girlfriend). we had an awesome time we went to ikea (whatever) and it was great!! we didnt get anything exciting except a garbage bin, a desk light, and the greatest smelling candle ever! there appt. was very nice, and a lot bigger then i though appt. were. i think they are doig well there in maryland. i can only hope that matt and i can adjust that well, which im sure we will. we watched the best movie with them which was actually a documentary called spell bound.. i think, but it was soo funny everyone should see it for a good laugh. the drive took us six an a half hours, which went well. matt was sick of driving but other then that uneventful. we made friends with the blue van which we called ""79 van buddy"" the reason for this is because he followed us from pitts. all the way to 38th and peach. it was great! 

   the job search has finally come to an end (thank god). i am working at the ymca as a park assistant. which can only mean fun (hopefully). i was going to work at the post office... but luckly that didnt work out. i start at the ymca  in june which is good althiough i wish i would of been working during may, but oh well. like i said i cant wait to get back to edinboro to be with my friends, i will be sharing an appt. with emily, shara, anita and myself. which will be fun. also my friend jordan, josh and sarah will be living next door. matt will still be living in rose with adam, who is the best room mate ever! he is soo funny.

"event","well going by the title of this update, i am sick! again, like always, sick! think i have a ear infection, but it could be something like a flu. all i know is, my ear hurts, i cant hear very well, and i am tierd. this of course had to come at the worse time ever, finals week! i admit this has been an easy week, im not sure if it is because my tests arnt hard, or if i am lazy... my guess is the ladder. i am trying to focus on reading and studying but i cant focus on anything because of the meds, and because i am tierd. so far my tests have been simple, which is good. but my classes werent during the semester. i am only worried about one class and that is state and local gov't with dr. jeffery ahh! if you attend edinboro, and you plan on taking this class... run away! run as fast as you can! she is a bad teacher, nice lady, bad teacher. one of the only teachers i have had that made me want to literally shove pencils in my ears so i wont have to listen to her talk. for those of you who havent experianced dr. jeffery first hand let me explain her to you...
  
     well one of the main words that describs her is scatterbrained. like i said she is one of the nicest teachers here, but really needs to find a new field. her tests are multi choice, and one essay. typical test right? wrong! multi choice up to H yes ABCDEFGH! the options usually follow ABCD, then A&B, B&C, D&E, all of the above, none of the above, or AB&E. ahh give me a break! even if you do know the answer you cant find it in all the hullabaloo she puts into the wording of this test as well as the answers. if i get a d+ in that class i will be very very happy. right now i think i have a C.. but who knows.

     for other news; matt got his org chem class he needed to grad on time. which is good, because now he might be able to grad with me.. which  would make job hunting a lot easyer for the both of us. we still havent planned out where we want to look for jobs at (which i think we should do soon, so we are on the same page) but i understand that it is going to be hard to find a happy medium but we will try. 
     i fell in love with this puppy! its one of those weiner dogs, but it was cute even though my cat could of killed it. i dont ever want to get a small dog bc it drives me crazy when people are like i hate cats, im a dog person and they are lugging around this dog that is smaller, smaller! then a cat. what is the difference.. at cat at least can take care of itself.  this dog was at some pet store in the mall, the price was $1,000! never will i ever pay that much money for an animal! 

    i finally got to see the last matrix movie, and i must say not all that thrilled with it. i loved the first one and once i saw the second one again i liked it too, but the last one sucked! for some reason it reminded my of a real bad star wars movie. hmm im not sure though. 

   well thats all i have for now, feel free to post comments or questions if you want... i have no life i will respond to them!! haha!"

        i cant wait to grad from college but i still have two years ( sad face!) i mean i could be done in 3 semesters if i do an internship but i dont know if i will. i kinda want to grad when matt does this way we can look for job togeatehr and in the same area. he wants to stay here in erei (boo) and i want to go anywhere south... so we decided that who ever gets the best offer is where we go, im sure that will change though. its not that i mind staying here but i hate the weather and if you dont get a job that comes with a contract you can count on being unemployed or layed off. which neither is a good idea. but we have a while to figuer this out... if you have advice on where to live let me know!!!!! well thats all for now."

""underneath"" jessica simpson.... hahaha dont laugh its a good song!
Sometimes it's hard when you're so deep inside
To see all you can lose in a blink of an eye
Dreams could be shattered
You could be gone
How would I survive
Cause you're where I belong
My soul-believer
Without you, I don't know who I would be

Underneath, I can feel you move through me
Inside out, you surround me
I breathe you like I'm taking my last breath
Oh, you're everything I know
So how could I let you go

Sometimes I listen to a voice that isn't mine
I disconnect from everything inside
And I have made choices
And wasted all the days
I could have been with you
Where my heart stayed
I know you've waited faithfully
Blessing our love even stronger

Underneath, I can feel you move through me
Inside out, you surround me
I breathe you like I'm taking my last breath
Oh, you're everything I know
So how could I let you go

And I've been blessed
For every kiss
For every breath
(How could I let you down)
And I've been touched,
By hands I trust
My love is risen"

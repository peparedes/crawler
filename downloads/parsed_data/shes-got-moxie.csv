"event","Yesterday I went to this music fest, you Tampa people know what I'm talking about, <b>Next Big Thing 5</b>! It lasted from 10am-10pm and the following bands played: 

- Staind 
- My Chemical Romance
- Trapt 
- Story of the Year 
- Rise Against 
- Our Lady Peace 
- 30 Seconds To Mars 
- Alkaline Trio 
- Anberlin 
- Motion City Soundtrack
- Suburban Tragedy

Everyone was AMAZING!! I have a blistering sunburn, a lingering headache, and a SORE neck from headbanging. It's great! Small price to pay to the rock music gods. AHHHH!! I'm still in afterglow.

Jared Leto (From 30 Seconds to Mars) rocked my world when he said (talking about the mosh pit) ""If anybody falls down, you pick 'em the !@#$ up."" He was all about everyone taking care of eachother.

AHHHH! It was SO great!!"

These first 3 I had to take of myself cuz I was bored and it was like 3:30 in the morning. That explains the hair, LOL, but whatever, I was bored and awake.

"event","I just had to show you guys this. I was at the coffeehouse tonight and there was this cat there named Sherbet. I have never seen a nicer, calmer, sweeter, people-loving cat in my life. And it's a BOY! Well he came over to me and decided to nap on my chest so Anth decided to snap a pic. Sorry about the quality, it was taken with my cellphone. But awwwwwww!

"event","I watched Beaches today for the first time since I was a child. Cried. <b>Gawd</b> I love Bette Midler. What happened to Barbara Hershey, anyway? She used to be a pretty big name, right? Back in the day? She just washed up. I wonder what did it for 'er though.

The weather has been cold and windy and rainy all day. I LOVE IT!"

"event","Tonight I hung out with Annie and Anthony. (Sounds like a bad off-broadway show, I know) and we went to the Wal and I bought ""Beaches"" for $8.88 and the other day Anth got me ""Steel Magnolias"" so I figure this weekend I oughtta have a ""Gawd-you-fat-pig-put-the-ice-cream-away, cry-your-eyes-out-and-then-fall-asleep-like-the-lazy-schlub-that-you-are"" marathon.

In other news, my neighborhood has gotten scary and ghetto, so excuse me while I go put a padlock on my sock drawer."

"event","Soo I just want to say this might have been the worse summer I've ever had in my entire life. I'm not looking forward to senior year, I'm not looking forward to going back to school with a bunch of people I don't like. I just feel like I'm going back to school with no friends. This summer I've realized like.. who my friends are, and who my friends aren't. I mean seriously you kinda realize that when none of them call you to hang out. Ok thanks, don't plan on pretending to be my friend when school starts. I'd rather sit alone at lunch, then sit with a bunch of people who don't even realize I'm there. 
  I mean I'm just gonna bitch about this cause I feel like it. I don't have a ride to school this year, and my house is not even close to my school. So I have to wait until I can get my lisense to drive to school. So I ask a friend who has a car if I could get a ride and I'll give her gas money, and she signs off line. I don't care if you don't want to give me a ride just say no, don't fucking just like sign off. And like, if I had a car and someone needed me to pick them up I wouldnt hesitate to help them out. Fucking god. Whatever. 

 Rockland makes my life myserable. I wish I still lived in hull. or something. 

  It pisses me off how my mom is like WELL YOU CAN WALK. Ok, so I'll wake up at like 530 to walk to school when you could just drive me and john at the same time because he goes the memorial park which is right behind the highschool and we'd both get to school on time. No, cause somehow that would mess up johns little schedule or whatever I don't even know why she won't do that. It would be less work, god what the fuck. 

I'm in the fucking worse mood."

 So I was getting sick of everytime I wanted to take a picture with my phone, it would say memory is full. So tonight I decided to delete some of them worthless pictures. But, I came upon pictures of my grandpa in a durag, which made me sad and happy at the same time. I was remembering when he was healthy and how I wish he still was, but then I remembered he'd probably like a durag now that half of his hair is shaved off. Maybe I'll get him one. Also, then I came upon about 40 pictures of nick and I. What a waste of pictures, I got so angry when I saw all of these, and I deleted them all. Even the ones I knew he took, that didn't have either of us in them. I forgot there was so many pictures of us in there and it took me by surprise that I hadn't already gone on a rampage and deleted them all. I want to completly erase those three months from my mind, even though I was so happy at some points, I was also so angry at some points too in those few months. If I knew what I know now with what would happened, I probably would have quit victory ASAP and never ever started talking to him and continued on with my life the way it was. Augh, it gets me so mad. 

  I fought with krystal all sunday, monday, and tuesday of last week. She got mad becasue I saw a lady at her work, and she asked me if krystal was pregnant. I'm not going to lie so I said yes. <b>That started a whole bunch of complete trailor trash bull shit that I don't even want to involve myself with.</b> Cool tell me one more time I need lyposuction or that I'm a monkey or I get played by every guy that I like. First of all, <b>I might be slightly chunk</b> but in no way do I need to get lyposuction, if anything I'm average weight. I didn't know being italian and dark made you a monkey? That doesn't even bother me anyways. And her telling me I get played by every guy I like is completly false. The only guy I have ever gotten played by was her boyfriend, who has played her with about 5 other girls, shes just pathetic enough to stay with him. I just tried to stay completly oblivious to what was going on in that situation thinking it would go away, <b>thats pure stupidity on my part </b>and never again will I play oblivious to whats going on ;-\ So basically that whole thing ended with nick saying fuck you. haha whatever The jokes on you man.. 


-grr- I hate boys. 

 SO ANYWAYS, no onto something that has meaning. My grandfather had brain surgery wednesday morning. I suppose they got out everythign they could, and he can still talk, walk, a read alittle bit. His senses were alittle off I guess, but thats what comes with brain surgery - he'll get them back with time. For awhile they were afraid he was going to have a stroke, so he was put on some medication for that and he's GOOD! And so he was in ICU after the surgery and woke up, and my aunt had fallen asleep I guess? You know those poles on the cieling that they hang stuff from and what not? <b> He got up on his bed and starting doing chin-ups, and ripped out his IV</b>. Needless to say, the doctor told him ""to take it down a notch - does he realize he just have intensive brain surgery?"" and my grandfather replied with, ""Well, I need to get my excersize in, you know I use to walk 5 miles a day."" .... WTF... they ended up taking the pole down from the ceiling and told him he needed rest he could catch up on his 5 a day later. 



... MY LIFE IS A CLUTTER ! my rooms getting so messy again. 



 So finally my shoulder was getting better, you know couldn't sleep on it still and what not. But I had to go fuck with it - and pick up my little brother. Seriously it felt like maybe my arm was being ripped out of my socket. COOOLLLL... 

well,


my life sucks.

camp starts next week. I can't fathom watching another kyle - everyone knows kyle. Thankfully she didn't sign up this year. I love the other little girls besides that, it makes me wish I was like 7 again. Life was like soo ... carefree. 


I want to show roy on permits next year since I'm too poor to pay board on him. 


ok thanks bye."

Needless to say, some hick got him. It was exciting. 

    

  Yesterday I finally got to see my grandpa. He gets confused so easily, and forgets what things are called. But other than that he's in like amazing spirits, and he's just his happy self. I feel alot better seeing him. Today I spent the day with him too, and he actually got to come home and we cleaned up the garden alittle. He's not supposed to be doing that, but he's a crazy man. He's getting his operation next wednesday and they are going to try and remove as much of the tumor as possible without causing damage -- I wanna make him a italian bracelet :) 

   I got a shirt and shorts at johnny cupcakes, which is good. I actually got two shirts, which is awesome.

   In other news, my life sucks. My mom woke me up this morning to tell me my Grandpa is worse off than everyone thought and he actually has a tumor in the front of his brain that is growing rapidly. Needless to say I cried for most of the day. That shouldn't happen to him, he's too good of a guy. It's right where his memory is stored, and therefore he's not able to remember things. Like he can't remember what a clock is called, but he knows it tells time, but he can't read the time. Tomorrow I'm going in to see him, he knows theres something wrong with him, and he gets confused very easily. He remembered my horse show was this weekend and asked how I did. :) I love him so much, he needs to get better ... Actually I know he'll get better. :*( 

   I really wish the Rands were home, so they could know about all of this. I would never want to come home from a vacation to this. If I knew while I was on my vacation I'd fly home. It just sucks they can't be home...

   Today I slept until about one. I needed it. The heat was unbearable yesterday at the show, I'm glad they called for no jackets. I would have passed out off Cha's back. We did decent yesterday, three seconds, a fourth, and two fifths and in the classic I got ninth. I know I wasn't consistant with him, people don't need to keep repeating themselves. But seriously it was 100 out and charlys focus just wasn't on me, and if it was alittle cooler maybe I would have made him focus on what I was asking him. I know exactly what I was and wasn't doing.. I'm over it. The classic was good, I was happy with most of my ride except the first canter he wanted to be a asshole. I can't blame him though, he's not use to showing against horses like morgans who gallop around and cut me and him off and he wanted to go as fast as them or get away from them I don't really know what he was thinking. I'm glad he doesn't mind crowds too too much, some of those horses were bucking and going crazy. I love charly :)  oh yeah, I wish he would stop talking to all the other horses, it's quiet annoying haha. 

   Danielle and I went out today and got some worms and went to <b> Johnny Cupcakes.<b> We met Johnny and he's pretty hott. I think the other guy that works there though is way hotter, he was there when Andy, Cha, and I went down there last time. He has nice hair and really nice eyes. Danielle thinks they are both gross, but what does she know? haha just kidding. 

   I just watched Dr. Phil and the show was on ""Parents who have trouble bonding with there kids."" I mean some of these people told there kids they hate them, and whatnot. I mean that sucks. I feel really bad for those kids.. well this was pointless for me to write about haha.

  Sometimes I think about living with my dad, more and more lately. I mean soon I'll have my license and it would be easy for me just to go live there. My mom is just constantly up my ass about stupid stuff, and I'm sick of alot of things in this house. It's not that I don't love my mom or anything like that cause I do obviously. But I mean, I don't even know what to say. Lately its every little thing that happens we get at each others throats and it always ends up being my fault. I'm not trying to say I'm innocent at all - but I'm not the only one thats doing something wrong here. She always taught me don't let people push me around and all that shit, and if someone yells at you yell back at them. So I don't understand why she thinks she can yell at me whenever she feels like it or at all. I mean if shes gonna yell at me I'm gonna yell at her theres no way I'm not going too. I wish she'd just like stop yelling all together, and I'd stop yelling. Yelling is a learned trait you know. Shes always trying to like ground me and stuff, I'm 17 ok? Like she wants me to start acting 18 and growing up and stuff she needs to treat me like that and not ground me for everything. 

  Also, this morning she told me she read all my instant message convosations on my computer. I'm not a bad kid, what gives her the right to go and snoop through my stuff? And told me about how I had a convosation with someone about smoking weed and how I would want too but I never would because I just get caught and get in trouble so I have no desire to. Ok, she doesn't need to read my stuff I'm not a bad kid and she has no reason to go through my stuff and read my stuff, maybe if she had some reason to go through my stuff because she thought I was doing stupid shit. Like last year, when I was a asshole yeah I would have torn through my room if I was her, but Im not even bad at all, like at all. haha. I mean seriously she has no right going through my stuff, the worst thing she is going to find is probably like I don't even fucking know. I really just think she needs to find something better to do then read stupid convosations on my computer. I have no privacy and it sucks and it actually fucking pisses me off she doesn't trust me at all. 

    idk but like I saw krystal this morning and it kind of pissed me off. Like seeing her or Nick just bring back memories I really just don't wanna like think about cause I think I still think about that situation way too much. I wasted like three months like trying to make myself believe he wasn't seeing krystal and he was just like with me, but no no I should have been like.. peace out. Everyone was like nicole seriously wake up, and I was just like NOnoonononono he's not doing that blah blahb blah. And prom, I'll never go alone to a prom again it's way to awkward like pictures and stuff it just sucks I guess it hurt me alot cause I still think about it from time to time. 

  I also just found out my Grandpa had a stroke. What the fuck is this? Everyone in the fucking Coletta family get sick? No, I can't deal with this. My Grandmother has breast cancer, and it just needs to stop. Everyone just needs to be better again..  :( :( :("

"event","Well, Today I went to work. I'm still working in the Tack Shop because my shoulder is still bothering me. It's fucked up and I just don't think any ""swelling"" should last this long. I seriously think somethings torn or chipped or broken or dead. I organized 400 gloves today. Last week it was the Jackets. I know now ever brand and size of gloves and jackets in briggs tack shop. :) I like working in the tack shop though. It's actually more relaxing. 

  Jojo, E.V.L, and I went to Wally world and spent so much money on baby food. I suppose it's cheaper there and she got like alot of food. Cameron is so lucky they have so many different kinds of food smashed up like apple sauce. When I was little it was peas, carrots, or sweet potatoes. I don't eat any of those vegatables today. Sickkk. And we got Chillis. Chillis is delicious. We all brought it back the the barn and chowed. It was absolutly amazing, and it gave me heartburn. I was kindly supplied with mint flavored tums. Yumm yumm. Going to chillis was quiet the .. trip.. haha. Idk. peace. 

  After lunch and not being all heartburned up I gave went out to the turnouts to get charly. He's a god damned nut, he beats on joe so bad. It's funny. I was afraid he was gonna get kicked though. Whatever, he tried to not let me catch him but he has no will and finally came upto me and was all happy to see me. I love that horse. He's sped though, he kept flipping his head like there was bugs around him or something. What a loser. :) Tanya braided him, I did his tail. He's all perty for the show. :) 

  My mom bitched at me for about five seconds cause we were late to the fundraiser for Caitlyn Dwyer. She gave me about 12 minutes to get ready and go. Needless to say I didn't have any makeup on and I probably looked like a sicky. I hope they raised so much money for her :). Shes a cool shit. Although I saw two fucking bitches that didn't deserve to be there for reasons I'm not saying, but I'm glad they didn't stay while I was there cause I hate them. Everyone got trashed, there you go. Thats rockland for you, ""Lets get trashed at a fundraser!!!"" Hey it's a excuse to get drunk. Whatever scummys. My mom won 8 tickets to two pawtucket red socks games. Sweet deal. 

 The south shore show is tomorrow, and for the first time I can say that I'm not looking forward to it. Besides the fact that it's going to be 92% and I'm going to be in a huge field with no trees. I don't feel like dealing with Amy, I mean I'm not going to start anything - because theres nothing to start anything over. But I can't work because of my shoulder and I'm sure that will piss her off and she'll make snyde comments. I don't care I mean waste your energy on it. I just don't feel like listening to it. I really don't have to awnser to her or explain myself. I just wish kara was going cause I know nothing like that would happen if kara was there. haha. I don't know, hopefully by next year I won't be showing with Amy anymore and I can just go to shows with Kara and Terry. That would be super. I just need to find a way to afford it. 

 Well I'm probably going to bed now.. Peace out"

  Today was fun, the first Coletta cookout of the season was a good one. We had a good game of wiffle ball - but it got cut short due to thunder and lightening. Whatevs it was still fun - also we had no boche game going on. I don't know what that was we usually play like 10 games of boche?
 
  Wiffle ball made my shoulder hurt even more though :( . I don't know was going on with my shoulder but it kills when I lift things up or use it too much, I believe I'm going to the doctors on tuesday. Maybe they'll take a x-ray or two to find out whats going on in there. I feel like I'm falling apart at too young of an aggeee - I mean my neck and back always hurt and if I don't move my knees I feel a bunch of pressure building up in them. Its what horsebackriding does to you I suppose. Whatevs - I'll put up with it.

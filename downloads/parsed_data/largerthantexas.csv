"event","Here in this diary, I write you visions of my summer. It was the best I ever had! Okay, umm accually thats just the begining of one of The Ataris's songs. But heyy why not ;] Soo The Cape was fun =] me and bob got tight.. and i clearly think he awesome. We played baseball, volleyball, and football. Eh good times! =] Brooke left me umm Tuesday until Thursday [?] I believe. When she came back we went shopping and cool stuff like that. We went to the beach a lot. We like went to these rocks and we got stranded =[ so Bil came over and got the tube to save us! *weeeee* That was silly. Then we went again, but this time.. with WONDER SHOES! =] Oh yeah! ((note* not water shoes, but wonder shoes)) We saw that kid Lucas again. Me and Brooke met him one night. He was my age & from NY. He liked the Yankees. clearly.. i could never like him lol He was cool I guess. He liked to catch crabs! =[ That scared me. and so did his friend. his friend was cute, but kinda weird. Oh jezze, I got hit on =[ The 1st time on Main Street, and dad was right there. Thankfully he didnt hear though. Then some boys yelled at me from a car, Bobby enjoyed that one. Then we got in the car and Bobby told me it was my turn to yell at boys. Har Har! Then Thursday night Some kid with God damn SEXYYYY hair hit on me. He asked me if I wanted to touch his beatiful hair, and of course. I couldnt pass that one up! =] It was hmm so yummy, I love that curley hair. Its sooo.. mmm. okay so anyways.. lol Im never going to see that kid again.but I did enjoy his hair. =] I cant really think of anything speical that happened over vacation. hmm.. nope got nothing. Well me and bob watched a documenty on a porn star! =] Yeah! Good Timessss ;]And Brooke would not stop touching my ass. She wanted my boobs to but ehh thats kinda sketchy =] Well the other day me, booke, bobby, Lour, dad, and little fat satan. I mean Emily went tubing. It was soooo much fun! We got a new tube thats bigger thank god. So me and Brooke went on. We were singing about my dad and his pants. See my daddy dont dance he just ripps his pants and does the rip away... now rip back.. rip back. hmm good song. ReMix=] Well we laughed our ass's off and had a good god damn time. Speaking of ass's Brooke.. Jesus Christ.. I never saw someones ass as much as I saw hers on vacation! I had never been mooned so many times in my life. hmm.. Wellllll, nothing really speical or WHOW happened over vacation.. 6 flags.. beaches.. boat.. Cape.. All good times though.. But I think last summer was wicked funner.. But I really want to eat food and watch Sponge Bob. Tomorrow im suppost to get my kitty with Gram, But im not counting on it. =/ Every time we say yeah kitty! no kitty =[ but were accually going to look at kittys. Oh my fiel star depp <3 =] yeahhh.. bob said to name him Pudge.. lol cute but I like fiel =] Okay world.. I will let you know if i get my kitten. <3

Well, tomorrow I am going to see The Lion King.. That broadway show. EKK!!! I dont want to go.. Butt my aunt got these tickets last year and they were a lot of $$. So I must try my hardest to like it. Maybe I will love it? I hope so though. Today I did an accual flip on my trampoline! Not my crappy fake ones.. like an accual one! =] I was so happy. Nothing really happened today. Me and Nicole watched ""My girl"" and CRIEEEDDDDDDDD so bad!! That movie was never so sad. Last night I got my phone! Its soo sick. The screen can flip and its a camera phone. Its soo cool, when say Nicole calls me, I have picture  of her on there, so it will show up when she calls ;] Its hott. Today wasnt wicked fun. I didnt really feel good and I still dont. Michelle taught me a new card game though. my dad had us watch the Olympics opening.. and the second the commerical came on we ran for our LIVES! but were going to play cards and pretend we like what hes making us watch..

Sooo let start over but with less detail because Im to lazy now! 3 days ago Christopher Fitsgerald Renyolds came over to see me and Lyssa Pants. We went cloud searching! =] We foundd hmmm, a rabbit, and a wolf looking thing I believe. then he headed home after a short period in time. I kinda got to fight him, but not the fight we have planned.. Cause I will kick his ass sometime! Oh I can, and I will. ;] The next day me and Lyssa just hung out. Then Billy came over and dad took us tubbing. It was friggen.. I dont even know.. like fun.. but not.. It was fun until like my foot like broke my crotch.. [[<STRONG>dont ask</STRONG>]] It would have been more fun if I was with Lyssa in the tube. BUT its small. It was funny though cause it was small so Trev couldnt really stay on it. It was fun overall I guess, but i really am scared shitless of things in the lake. Like the lockness monster or something. =[ and FISH! BAHH! But hey life usually goes on. Then we headed back here and Aimee came! *woot* We asked Colleen to go get us BK and she did =] We &lt;3 you! Then us 4 headed for the trampoline. We saw shooting star [[ <EM>*</EM> ]] aww! =] Then Billy went home and we watched Big Fish while eating our yummy BK! =] That was a good movie yesh yesh. Except we did make fun of him becoming a large fish in a swimming pool BUT thats okay. We really didnt do anything that night. Just watched TV. The next day, thats ALL we did! We watched Joe Shmo 2 ALL day* It was awesome. We took a break to make soup and tuna =] yum yum! and feed the birds burnt bread! Oh we are such good citizens! Then A_dizzel went home, and me and Lyssa continued to watch Joe Shmo2! lol It was an all day marathon. =]! Then Aimee came back over to sleep here, but plans changed. We decied to shit this shin dig to her house. But Lyssa had to go to her step-moms house. I miss her already! =[!! But I am going to my stepmoms house tonight also. So its all good =] *woot* So me and Aimee went to help my dad get furinture with him and Lour. We went to some old ladies house. she was WEIRDDD AHH! You wanna pet my dog?! WHERES THE DOG.. in your hand faggot. Oh man. Crazy ol' women was she. We had a grand time though. Then we went to Aimees we watched Scary Movie 3. It was funny. Friggen Joesph threw open the door and gave Aimee a heart attack. It was silly. ;] Then he like went up to the window later on, and scared us.. again.. Jesus christtt.. Glenny too! a_holes! =] Then I talked to Eric for a short while on the phone. Hes going hiking today. I did infact have a mother f*ing good time making fun of him for that one! Being the good kid I am, I told him not to fall down the mountain! =] Then me and Aimee watched center stage and fell fast asleep.. Then I woke up and came home, and thats where my story ends. Hmm, I feel kinda like weird.. I dont really know why though. I didnt do anything wrong or do anything bad. I just feel weird.. :-/ HmmmmMmmmMmmm... Well Im going to my house tonight and maybe I can accually get het to take me out to dinner * y U m M y * diinneeerrrr..

"event","Okay so clearly Lisa didnt accually say that one. But she did say ""Grab his pizza and run. It looked big"" But thats not what we heard! So Monday morning comes along and me and Lyssa wake up and get ready for our Hampton Beach adventure. It was me, Lyssa, Mommy, Lisa, and Ashley. On the way there we were all,including the mommys, were car looking for guys. We saw some kid that they thought was cute (NOPE!) and there was an old fatty in the car. Ashley, being the good sport she is, said she would take him. Taking one for the team! When we got there we just beached it. Then Me Lyssa and Ashley went for a walk. and we saw Matt and Eric! How weird is that? Accually, not weird at all since we planned it the night before. So, we just beached it and then went to the hotel pool. I must admit I harassed the kids in the pool. I told them I couldnt touch the bottom, and asked if they had balls. The rules clearly stated no ball playing was allowed. ;] Just keeping everyone one in check. Oh and Me, being Mr.Smooth, smashed my mouth on the side of the pool. It was hott. Nice and Bloody! Hmm go me! =]Then us Ladies got ready while the boys ate. We had to get ready for the Brandy concert. Then I hung out with Matt and Eric until they left. =] Then us ladies headed to do a little shoppin' and then to the concert. Okay so we see a bunch of white guys come and they start playing so were like they must be an opener for Brandy?? HaHa NOPE! this band is called Brandy.. haha it was so funny but we had a fun times anyways.. We still danced around cause they had some good songs..=] good times. then we headed to the strip =]! WooT! We had some kids look at us and mom was like ""Keep your eyes in your head thats my daughters!"" they were Like aww sorry! Then she laughs and goes HAHA JUST KIDDING! She told everyone that story.. even the guy that holds the door at the hotel. Which she hooked up with Ashley. lol Good times. Then the mommys headed to the beach to drink wine. so me and ashley and Lyssa walked the strip.. and we can some creepy people.. drunks and horny little buggers.. so we headed back to the beach with the mommys.. and we saw thee coolest thing everrr it like pick up trash =] It was cool. and these kids were walking by and they thought they we were yelling to them.. so they like came over lol.. we just walked on the beach for awhile with them.. but seeing as it was like 1:30 at night mommys wanted us to go to sleepy. So everyone went to sleep but ohhh noo not me and Lyssa. We went on a stake out on the porch! haha. Some guy called the cops so we were like listening but we couldnt hear cause the AC came on.. Damn that AC.. So we made up a story.. So a gorilla that was ""THIS BIG AND PREGNANT"" was comming at him. =] Good story if I do say so myself ;] Then we just went to bed cause he left us, and there was no more means of entertainment. The next day we were beach bums. They our friends from the night before came with us shopping =] I got a sweatshirt, 2 shirts, and skirt. I love them all. and I got eric something cause he said he needed it.. but I cannot say what it tis. Cause its a sHHH secret. Then we kinda sorta ditched them.. SORRY! Then some boys told us they wanted to teach us how to surf.. but they were in a car sooo lol  After a while we just headed home.. Sooo I get home for like 20 mins. no one is home then I see Grammy.. as soon as I see her she tells me to pack cause were going to the cottage.. So we hop in the car and away we went to Aunts Nancy cottage we go. So we get there and we played 31 it was up to me and Gena.. Damn her she won.. so I told her we would Rummy 500 it. But we quit and looked at Pictures.. then I watched Kim Possiable then slept. The next day we went to OLD SILVERRRR I love this beach so much. Its the best beach everrrr.. I tanned and swam with Gena all day. I was hope[ing] I would see johnny but the fucker didnt bring his cell. But I forgive him.. even though I am holding that grudge Johnny.. and I still owe you for you telling your mom I was was a LOTR fan.. lol I miss Johnny though. I havnt seen him since midnight madness. But I did not. He was with Christina Cambelle. ""shes a sight, if your blind"" oh Norris Face. lol But there was this life guard.. and he was like 17 and he had sexy hair!! =] So Gene, being the wonderful cousin she is, tried to swim out past the bouy so that he would look at me. haha shes so silly. I love it.. Shes the only almost 30 year old that acts my age =]! I love her. and I think she should move outa wisconsin. and here with me =]But I got a killer tan! and I love it sooo much!! =] Then we headed back to the cottage, and they ate dinner while I slept. I wanted to go to Lyssa's tonight to help paint but stupid dad went to Lour's house so I had no ride. but were doing something tomorrow =]Im soooo excited.. were going to 6 flags on Saturday now.. but thats okay even though its going to be crowded but Saturday is suppost to be nice and tomorrow isnt soo its all gravy. but I get to see her tomorrowww =]!! and her new room. Woottt.. But now I will shower and eat and sleep fast so I can see Lyssa sooner ;] LoL. Okayy world.. G-night. <3 Da' beach bum

I know you wanna leave me,

I don't mind coz' you mean that much to me

Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go
Ain't to proud to plead, baby, baby

Ain't to proud to beg, sweet darlin
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go
Ain't to proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go

If I have to sleep on your doorstep
all night and day just to keep you from walkin' away
let your friends laugh, even this I can stand
cause I want to keep you any way I can

Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin'
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go
Ain't to proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go

Now I've gotta love so deep in the pit of my heart
And each day it grows more and more
I'm not ashamed to come and plead to you baby
If pleadin' keeps you from walkin' out that door

Ain't too proud to beg, you know it sweet darlin'
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go
Ain't to proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go
Baby, baby, baby, baby (sweet darling)

We also sat on the boat. Then we went running... to Dunkin Donuts. But thats okay.. Then Jerm picked us up on the way home because our hands were filled with food. We now worship him =] thank you Jerm. Then Me Trev Diana and Joe took the boat out. Joe.. is seriously.. the funniest kid ever. He makes the best faces and looks like a true retard. Trev like hit some waves and Joe like made himself bounce wicked high and like threw his coffee off. You had to be there, but I never laughed so hard in my life. Joe is seriously thee funniest kid ever. and hes nice. He got me soda and an enegry drink! THANKS JOE! =]! Then we went out with Lour dad emily. I drove the boat. why am I so pimp? I just dont know. We went to WB the other day. We went to Bobs and I got etnies for.. hmm 12 dollars. whoot* Me and sarah had the same shoes. That was so funny. Then I got to see James Thomas Peck! =]!!!! I miss him sooo much! Hes all punk and cute. And he has the cutest puppy everrrr =] It sniffed my ass. Good times [?]I also got to see Stephaine! :) Then me and lyssa went to Michelles home. We had Mac and Cheese and watched The Sweetest thing. It was so funny. Your to big to fit in here.. To big to fit in here.. To big to fit in here *moan moan moan* My body is a movie and your penis is the star. ;] Aww such good times. HAHA then we like vultured the Bingo Hall. hahahahaaha. we went all like secret agent, and was ducking under windows and shit.. then some old bitch turned on her lights. It was so funny. We were spotted. But then Gram came out and went home to Webster.It was so funny. but Im out. me and lyssa are going to do.. anything. ;]

I thought I saw a man brought to life
He was warm
He came around like he was dignified
He showed me what it was to cry
Well you couldn't be that man I adored
You don't seem to know
Seem to care what your heart is for
But I don't know him anymore
There's nothing where he used to lie
The conversation has run dry
That's what's going on
Nothing's fine I'm torn

"event","HaHa. Oh man. Last night I went to Lyssas house. We acted like we were deaf. and We were pretty good at it. I knew some signs because of McKinley. =] I think last night was like, one of the best nights ever. We didnt really do anything stupendus. BUT at 1 in the morning we went outside in the POURING rain! I love the rain so much and I love Alyssa so much so it was awesome. Shes a really good puddle jumper. We just danced and yes, even sang in the rain =] It was so much fun. It was a little to much like a movie. lol But it was awesome. Eric got pissed at me last night. Wonderful eh? Buttt I cant really do anything about that one. I tried and hes still mad.. This is summer time FUNNNNNNN!Okay, so I was just gone for a few hours. We went out on my daddys new boat =] It was wicked fun. Then since it is my dads birthday I suggested we go to Point Breeze. So we went to dinner there and Trev went to pick up Colleen on the boat. Then we headed home in the rain good times. lol I really wanted to put my hand in the water but I seriosuly thought it would get like bitten off or something. It was scary :-/ Yeah, i know im a loser. The boat is awesome though. I must admit it is a little bit more fun than the Ka-new. Sorry Nicole! lol Dad said that if took like lessons or something I could ride the boat all by myself. That would be awesome.. but also scary. lol Me alone on the Lake. ek! but that would be awesome. The lake is so beatiful at night =] It was fun with Me trev and Dad. Then Colleen joined us durning dinner. and I <3 her so it was awesome. Then I got home at like 9:30-10 ish. And did nothing.

<P>1. That movie is wicked funny, and I &lt;3 it mucho so.</P>
<P>2. My dad got a boat for his birthday. Random?&nbsp;I'd like to say so. </P>
<P>So0o, I was making cookies last night. *Cookies/cookie dough is like my comfort food* And I look outside and I see a large boat in my drive way. I was very confused so I go outside. And sure enough Lour (being the wonderful person she is) had bought PaPa bear a boat! *GASP* I feel like a true Webster..ian.. =] Also last night was a good night cause.. something I was hope[<STRONG>ing</STRONG>] would happen.. Happened =]! <FONT color=#ff0000>&lt;3 </FONT>hmmm Jinxy <FONT color=#ff0000>&lt;3</FONT>! Okay, so lets think of my day. Well I had a cool dream. I dream..ed. that the people i like from WB came to BHS. It was cool. I also had on roller blades [?] and I also bought&nbsp;a pair of Barbie hightops. They were very cool and I kinda wish I had some in -<U>Real</U>- Life.. but meh, i dont. =[ Then I woke up at like 9:30, and thought to myself.. "" Do I, Katie E.B. Bonanno, really want to get up this early "" The answere was <STRONG>NO</STRONG>! So I went back to bed and woke up at like.. One. I felt normal again. Then I called Lyssa cakes. And we planned for her to come over tonight. So I hit up Dani cause I miss her mucho so. So she came and we swam.. and I vowed not to get my hair wet.. But yet I jumped into the pool thinking my hair would be safe from all water. I guess not huh. Splashes tend to make my hair get wet. not to good. Then we <FONT color=#ffcc66>TANNED</FONT> cause half my ""tatas"" are white. Dani.. is just all white. I am sorry.&nbsp; Then we watched Peter Pan!! =] and not that new movie.. cause that movie..from what I saw. sucked ass. the disney <STRONG>ORIGINAL</STRONG>. It was splended! They can fly =] Tink.. is a SLUT! god.. with big hips!!! I mean seriously.. her dress is a strapless that shows her ass and it has slut like things in it! I was shocked. and they wonder why kids start to be sluts at such a young age. I blame tinkerbell. Dirty slut. and also.. wendy.. shes not <STRONG>too </STRONG>bad, but she does try to kiss Peter and may I remind you.. Shes still in the nursery. But that movie is still so cool. So then we just chilled, and I got worried about Lyssa cakes. So I call her up, and she couldnt come over for medical reasons. But our plans for tomorrow are still on! *woot* Okay so dads bday is Wednesday.. ususally on birthdays, its like a family thing right? <STRONG><FONT color=#663366>WRONG!</FONT></STRONG> Hes kicking everyone out of the house. So himself and Lour can be alone. Dont really want to ponder about that though. It may result in puke. Or another addition to the family. <FONT color=#333333><EM>*YUCK*</EM> </FONT>Kinley.. I want to kick the fuck out of that shit head... seriously.. He is the reason the thought of kids makes me want to be a virgin until I die. I really would enjoy punting him in the face. But anyways.. So tonight G-smith came over and we went on the trampoline... AND he called me a beached whale. Oh<FONT color=#cc33cc>_</FONT>snap Gunit. That hurts. He tried to make up for it, but thoes words will echo in my heart and mind! Then he headed home.. and I went online and talked to Eric. He let me make him a profile.. and he accually used it too. *<STRONG><FONT color=#6666cc>GASP</FONT></STRONG>* thank you E_rock. =] I must admit I do love the profile! ;]&nbsp; Im soooo wicked amped cause 6 flags with my 3 favorite people (besides all the other people I find cool) are going to 6 flags. Lyssa - Matt - Eric! Yeah kid. im wicked excited. I believe the boys are meeting up with us. And if not, it will still be so much fun! But they better go! ;]!&nbsp;Im wearing my new brown shirt today. I&nbsp;do heart it a lot. But Me and Dani are going to eat food and watch TV like the true&nbsp;champs we are. I feel a need for Corky&nbsp;Romano.&nbsp;"" Question.. you do you dont you do you dont. no no its cool you dont have too, im up here your down there "" I would like to Thank Johnny (no middle name) Norris for telling me he liked that movie.. cause that inspired me to buy it. ;]&nbsp;Good memories my darling. =] miss you.

"event","Oh yes, me and Lyssa had a good time with that title. It was on Mad Tv. and we found it funny. He can speak fluint dumbass =] So last night.. hm I slept over Lyssa<3 She got her computer to work for like 10 minuets. I was proud of her. I saw something that I wicked wanted to see, but then again I didnt. I kinda like cried. Got a few tears. But While Lyssa joyed over her computer working I talked to Eric on the phone. It seemed like he didnt want to talk to me so I kinda like ended it. Sorry Eric. And of course, Matt was being a bitch. Hes only a bitch on the phone or online. In person he is a cool one. But I dont know. Me and Lyssa went to Price Chopper [wad up to our love Aimee] and we got lots of yummy food for us! Our mommy was mad cause we took forever. On Lyssas TV we rented EuroTrip and that movie was wicked funny. We got some good quotes from there. lol. Then we just watched Kim Possiable and then went to bed. The next day we went to the mall. We had some pretty hott outfits on. Then we headed to Wendys. =] I am a tank. Then when we got home I called my PaPa bear and then headed home. I havent really done anything productive since I've been home. I went on my trampoline for a bit. Im going to go out later to look at the stars. Yeah know, if they come out. Ugh, im so confused right now. Honestly, I could be confused over nothing. I just saw something that USE to mean something but I doubt it does anymore. Confused? I bet you are. Really only me, Trev, and Lyssa understand. Oh and Colleen lol. I <3 Lyssa so much. You know how theres only like one or two people that you can hang out with for like ever and you dont get sick of them. Thats Lyssa and Sarah E. Lundin. I miss Sarah a lot. I <3 her also. So me and Lyssa have been seperated at night for 2 nights. Not in a row. We've been apart for like 22 hours at the most for the past like 2 weeks. She is home tonight and i miss her a lot but shes sleeping over here tomorrow! =] *woot* We will do front flips and whatever else we want. Aimee went to camp today! I miss her already! but when she comes home me her and lyssa will be reunited. =] Oh yeah.! I miss her already. The other night Joe slept over. Me Michelle Trev and Joe talked. but about things people with moms will find mest up then we watched home movies. Trev knows about underwater valcanoes. HaHa. Oh little Trevor. Once so cute.
Wellp, Im out. I think i will go chill alone on my trampoline cause well yeah Im kinda cool like that. Later dater.

                        *sorry to crush your hopes and dreams*
                
                                          Strong Bad.

11 days until me and Lyssa hit up 6 flags!!! ;]!<3
We may meet up with Eric and Matt. *woot* Dunno though.!"

"event","<P>Yesterday and today was 2 splended days. Yesterday me and Lyssa went to lours house. We <EM>almost</EM> had to go to Bobbys hockey game. But with all the children/girls complaining about going so Lour let us stay and babysit. So we headed to Matt's pool and then watched the little ones swim. Then just me &amp; Lyssa headed to the house to make the children food. We made pancakes and then cleaned everything. *aw*&nbsp;Then as always that night we played manhunt. Good Times. Me, Lyssa, Matt, and Eric were bascially a team. We kinda kick ass. Yeah Yeah, we do. Then we all went into Lours house and watched ""The Princess Diarys."" and I was going to drug up Emily and then make her wash it down with some Niquill. She was like going insane and I wanted to kick her in the face a little bit. Then today was woken up at 9:45 by who else but Emily. I wanted to <STRONG><FONT color=#ff6600>punt</FONT></STRONG> her. so I went back to sleep because clearly me up at 9:45 is insane, and hazordis to little kids. So then we woke up and hung out with the neighborhood ""gang"" then Lour came home. Me and Lyssa put on disney princess dresses and wigs. We got picture but on her cell phone. Might I add, I would make a fine Goldie locks. No.. kidding. But that wig was sexy. Then we all went swimming. We played b-ball after that I almost beat this kid Brian in PIG, but I got everyone else out. Oh_snap! It was awesome. then I&nbsp;went home with lyssa and we did front flips on the trampoline! who0o sadly though&nbsp;she went home. I only stayed home because Michelle my favorite&nbsp;cousin EVER is here. So I will miss her but i will hang out with her again tomorrow!! =] Today we&nbsp;adopted a frog. His&nbsp;name is Backster. Hes made out of plastic. But we love him anyways. Okay well that was my day!&nbsp;Now me and Michelle and Trev! (WHO IS NOW HOME! YAYA!) are going to pick up Joe I guess. hm joy. then me and&nbsp;Michelle are watching home movies! The best&nbsp;movies ever&nbsp;might I add.&nbsp;Super fun and all but Later dater!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ((IWALC))</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

"event","<P>Yes cadets. Thats Aimee.. Shes a retard. =] we were at the bowling alley tonight, and we got some tickets. so we bought invisiable ink and then we had enough to get bubbles and something else. So the guy, being the nice guy he was, gives us two bubbles. Aimee, being the wicked blonde she is, goes. ""We have like 20 left.."" the guy simply looks at her and says.""No you have none left."" Aimee trying to do the math in her head says ""No we have 20 left!"" and she starts freaking out. Then she sees theres 2 bottles, and the it clicks we only have enough for one but this guy is nice. Or just like little girls. We arent really sure. but he was deff stoned. It was awesome. That is my story. In the end though, he gave us another free bubble thing cause there are 3 of us. =] THE END! Today was a wicked fun day. Paul called me hott, sorry Paul but thats creepy. =]! and I got to see _____. It was so good, but ____ didnt say anything but ""Yeah"" to me. Even thoes words I shall cherish. But ____ just dont like me so ugh*I mean I even love the ____'s that resemble this persons name. Oh well, sucks for me! The real point of this entry is to tell you about me and Lyssas pancakemuffins. Also known as: Birdmuffins. Okay so this is how you make them. You take pancake mix, then pour it into muffin trays with chocolate chips. Simple and yummy right? <FONT color=#ff0000><STRONG><EM><U>WRONG!</U></EM></STRONG> </FONT>These things taste like ASS HOLE! (dont ask me how I know that) But oh my god, you dont understand. They smell like ass and they have this fucking weird texture. Like a sponge corn muffin. It was just plain old sick. So you may be wondering why we call them birdmuffins. Simply because after one bite, you want to throw them to the birds. And not those cute little robins outside your window. Like pigeions that shit all over your freshly washed car, or worse on you. You hate them basically. well make our muffins and feed them to the birds. You will get revenge on them, trust us.Well me and Lyssa have been together and irrspeperable for.. like a week or so now and I wouldnt have it any other way. Also we include Aimee in our plans simply because we love her a lot. =] &lt;3hmm just the 3 of us ;] &nbsp;well.. go fuck yourself San Diego. Thanks for stopping by. </P>

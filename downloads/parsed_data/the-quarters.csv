"event","wow, been a while, alot to cover, best for last though, sorry, like my, commas,?,

firstly, job went well, lots of fun.  i actually didnt do what i thought i was going to do but instead had alot more fun (alot more).  made some friends sam was cool, adam and andrew (twins) ok but whatever, bailey, hate the facker hope he dies and umm... ya, showed lots of constraint to not turn him upsidown and shake my sanity back out of him, and jessica(see later) is my current lady friend (no im not with ariana anymore)  but that was cool, all of it was fun.  things went well, didnt want to leave but i had to

secondly, philmont, the hiking thing in new mexico.  awsome even tho it was the second time.  loved it, completly freaking wonderful, didnt really like the people i was with tho, that sucked.  overview, hiked, that was cool, i like hikinh, gives me time to think about stuff.  ate lots of dehydrated food... mm... crunchy meat and powdery mac and cheese.  then did mount philips, the second tallest mountain out there, (ive done that and baldy [tallest] so im happy now) got to play in snow a few times, made a ghetto snow/ice man but then hands went numb and all i could feel was pain (after i could feel again) but it was cool.  on the last day the staff at the camp we were in (forgot the name) gave me (and only me, yay) bbq chicken, and after 10 days of dehydrated food, its freaking better then um... anything... (cept jessica of course, good save, me, hi five bro) anywho there was this really cool hail storm, it hurt cause it was huge and so much, but there was like 2 inches of hail covering the ground afterwards, it was so cool, but no one else liked it

and lastly, jessica, yay.  finaly, a girlfriend and i get to keep my self respect and my testicles arent in a trophy case somewhere (it feels... strange).  anyway, i really like her and she really likes me so its all good and happy, but she lives in paige so that sucks, plus i still cant drive and she wont be able to for a while.  right now shes in virginia for national jamboree (might have heard about it on the news, 4 people died out there) but shes coming back tomorrow.  she was in the hospital today, not fun appearently she threw up and passed out so not the best thing to hear.  otherwise all is good and i hope to see her soon. if not, i have to wait till the second or third weekend of august were going kyaking so thatl be cool, been a while tho so im gonna suck at it.  o ya, she likes kyaking

thats 'bout it, see yous guys at school.

"event","so its about 1 and ive been starting to learn to play the guitar.  ive been meaning to do this for about 7 or 8 years, when my dad bought me a guitat cause i wanted to play, so i finaly decided id go for it (thats right, after 7 or 8 years i finaly decided to)  so far its going pretty crappily, altho ive only been playing for like 20 minutes, i guess all is well.  and its official, i hate picks, i dont like them at all, im betting at using my thumb, stupid online thing all like ""oh, use a pick, its so much better,"" screw that, ill stick to the way i halfway tought myself (sorta).  and i can almost play 'leaving on a jet plane' (sorta) the easy version where its just strumming chords (hooray easyness).  o well i hope i get better, thatd be good, u know, the whole actually being able to play thing.  but my fingers hurt now so ill try again later

otherwise in my life, for those of you that dont know im working at a scout camp this summer (and yes im in scouts).  but theres this thingy that i have to turn in tomorrow (today? firday) that way i get paid, so my bro has to copy his and bring it by tomorrow, then drive it way up there (hooray him, also he didnt turn his in either so whatever) anyway its all good

also, im not sick anymore, if i actually was, not sure what was going on, but its all good now

thats about it, wow, longest post so far, im proud *pats self on back*"

You wouldn't understand what it means, unless I took the time to explain it. Which I won't. And probably will not. Someone will understand eventually, I'm sure...that cannot be avoided. Someone will understand right now. But I'm not going to waste my breath [or fingers...] on explaining a meaningless thing right now. It wouldn't matter. The fact of that matter is...that is my new one, and that is the only one which I will be visiting. 

So, deal with it. And as my new motto goes...but mind you, its being modified still:

Tomorrow is another day, but the clouds will not go away."

"event","Its a burning sensation, deep within my heart. Like a nagging feeling...as if I've forgotten something, or someone. I wish to understand it fully, to grasp the meaning. To hold it close...and never let it leave me. Never let go. Its starting to take me over, making it hard to think clearly. I can't concentrate, or if I do...it only lasts for a little while. Its amazing sort of thing, although scary...very scary. Its starting to consume me. Eating me away; from the inside, out. Almost like a hollow feeling. There might be some sort of water in there...down in the bottom of my feet, and it sloshes around when I move. Even when I'm not moving...its swirling, possibly causing all this discomfort I feel. All these problems I create for myself...they startle me. But I suppose that this is what it is supposed to feel like, whatever this is..., and I suppose this is fairly normal. Although it feels abnormal, alienated almost. I no longer understand...but I feel as if I must try."

"event","The ending is near, dear ones...it has come. I cannot say we did not earn such a gruesome and horrible one, for we have. I cannot say we deserve to live, for we don't. We don't really deserve another chance. Second chances are like candy given to a baby, if handed out to freely they will become expected...almost like an addiction. But when given sparingly, and saved, they can make life so much sweeter. Or like giving a puppy a treat. Giving him one when he takes a whiz on the floor, and he'll continue to do his naughty little deed. But give him one when he scratches on the door to be let out, and he'll understand that. He'll be thinking: <i>Dude, I just got a cookie...cause I wanted out. DUDE! I need to want out more often!</i> Then...while the little bugger is outside, he'll do his buisness. The only problem is that if your dog catches on quick enough, he'll just about always want outside. Just for one of those damned cookies. He may even love the cardboard box more then he does you...ironic how that works, isn't it?

The broken tears have graced my eyes once again. But they will never meet my cheeks, for I do not allow them to escape. Like a stolen fortune, I hoarde my crying on the inside. Locked tightly away. Where it can be seen, or heard, by no one other then myself. On the inside I'm screaming, screaming to be heard, but I've been muzzled. By myself. By others. By the world. People don't understand why I hide away my feelings like this...well, its safer this way. I don't get hurt. You don't get hurt...the whole world is fucking happy with their Scooby Doo band-aids. Lets just smack one of them big 'ol suckers on...it'll make everything better. Ask your damned Mother to kiss it...christ on a cracker people, Grow up."

"event","Well, since my decision was rash...I'd like to apologize to a few people. Although I really did none wrong, I feel bad for participating in such a childish act of anger. It makes me feel young, once again, like when we had fights on the playground. Its not really worth it...we get into a fight, just to become friends again. We all know its coming, so lets skip all the drama and go back to being friends...its easier. Less painful, and stressful on all of us. My apology is given, I hope it is accepted...and I hope the rest of you will follow suit. There is no need to be at one another's necks, especially among such a tight circle of friends. We are supposed to be there for one another...so when one screws up, we should cut them some slack. Its what we're here to do...help out. 

Although I still believe friendship needs trust, friendship is possible to conceive without it. Although it is more of a hollow, meaningless, time-consuming act of interest towards one. I would rather not participate in such an act of friendship. I have worked out my problems with the said person, so we're alright...we have trust, and we have friendship. The good times are coming, and the bad times are leaving.

Someone who I held close to me, who I trusted with more then just simple meaningless words, has told me that they cannot trust anyone at the school of which we partake. To them: I'm horribly sorry I don't meet your standards, but I will not be changing. I am who I am, and others trust me...if you're going to act like this...well, I'm done acting as if everything is alright. I mean...seriously, I've taken a lot of shit from people. And I mean a lot...but its never worth it. Sure, we avoid a confrontation that is needless...but its mainly just because I don't like hurting people. Even if they are stupid, over senstive, drama-queens who believe everything revolves around them. I'M SICK OF IT! Sick of taking all of this shit!! Sick of being compared to others!! I AM NOT THEM! I NEVER WILL BE! If you can't grasp that concept, and continue acting as you all have been [not all, directed at a few] then I'm afraid I cannot handle it anymore. Its really not worth the effort anymore...as Tayna said, [If you don't know who she is, check out my buddeh page] its just fuckin' bullshit. I'm being cast aside, for what!? Attention...a spotlight, and peers looking at you. I would rather be invisible, or dead...

I didn't use names for a reason. Which, you all know I'm rather vague...I'm just feeling drained. Emotionally, mind you. All these people are sucking the very life out of me...and those who make me happy, well, its like a bad reaction to an anti-biotic. I just want to be away from everyone. I want to be with...well, Him. He makes me smile, when he's not play-insulting me. He understands...and I don't get enough time with him. Its addicting. He's addicting.

"event","Its writer's workshop this time...I like this class, a lot. It gives me a specified time during the day of which I can write, which is what I think I do best, and allows me to complete that certain thing. I turned in my poem, the best one I've ever written...maybe I'll post it. I'm not sure, since I'm currently waiting for a certain someone's opinion on it. *Hint Hint Nick...* My teacher had a lot to say about it...she liked the ""lay out"" of the poem itself. Enjoyed the way I wrote it...the way some of the lines were broken apart, and turned into more then one sentence. A good thing, because I enjoy positive feedback. Negative feedback is always fine to...because it merely helps me to become better. Which, is always possible, and always a good thing. I can never be a perfect writer, because there is no such thing as a perfect anything. Everything, and everyone, has flaws. But we, as human nature, ignore them...or choose not to see them. Or, we provoke them...enlarge them in our own views. Why must we as a race be so...faulty? I don't mean one specific color of people, but humans on a whole. I know very few which I would not mind keeping in touch for...the rest of my life. I can name them all, right here. Right now. But, to spare certain feelings...I won't. There is no use of needless pain, for it has been caused to often in my life, and I don't want to be the cause of it in another individual's life. What comes around, goes around...and I am currently trying to break that specific cycle.

Those damned feelings...intense love, or liking, and anger. Anger that they could be so sure of themselves in such a situation...but I almost idolize that fact about them. They do not fear what lies ahead, but dodge right into the mess. To the very tangles of such an inner being. It might not be safe...someone is going to be hurt, badly. I don't want such happiness to end though. When I talk to this person...everything seems alright, seems fine again. As if all the pain I have gone through is completely worth what I will get in the end. As if I've won a game, but taken a horrible casuality. I get a prize at the end of the tunnel...I just must complete the maze of the inner-most thoughts of my mind, as well as their's. Its like...a chance. A chance which started a chain reaction. I took a chance on them, and now they're taking a chance on me. I would thank them for it...except for I have other ways to do such a thing. Better ways, you might say. Ways that are more meaningful. I'll link them here...so they may understand just how I feel. And maybe save them from a few nasty words I may accidentaly blurt out...who knows.

Suddenly...I see myself, eagerly awaiting the days to come with this person. A relationship, dare I cringe.

None of this I can answer for sure...I'd like to, but I must await that single person. My Knight in Shining armor. Its as if I can't feel whats inside, like its all hiding from me. Or just behind a door I cannot open without a key, a key which has been lost, or is just out of reach. To him...he knows who he is, I'd like to thank you. You know some of which you are being thanked for, but not all of it. Which is probably safer...although some may not think so, I've got reasons for sharing what I share, and keeping what is kept. I was once told, its in my comments somewhere...go searching, that there is love in me but that it can only be seen by special people, certain people. Is that true for everyone? Or just for me? I'd like it to apply to a certain person, but I'm not entirely sure it does. I can't ask, because we've talked it over before. But ones mind can't help but wander...especially when you've as much times on your hands as I do. It confuses me, as well as intrigues me, like a good book. Or a movie with twists around every corner. I can't help but want to know the outcome. Its like walking on thin ice, you need to step carefully. For if you break the fragile barrier, you'll never know what could have been, had you reached your destination. Or when it rains. Some people enjoy it, genuinly, and others hate getting wet. Some people understand, while others would tell me I need mental help."

Am I destined to forever receive these sorts of answers? ""You don't want to hear this, but you're a rare kind of person."" You're right...I don't want to hear it, so don't tell me it. I hear it enough...but obvioulsly, to the people around me, enough for me, isn't enough for them. Well, yes...I do know this is my second update today. I
ve got a lot of time on my hands...so sue me. Well, don't really. Its just sounds catchy when you want to tell someone off. Christ, my computer loads to slowly...stupid damned dial-up connection. I'd beat it with a bat, if I still didn't need it. Oh! I probably haven't told you all yet, I'm saving up for a computer of my own. A laptop, preferally. To put in my room. I know, it'll take me forever...but, well, it'll be worth it eventually. 

I yearn to be free, once more. To be on my own, allowed to go where I please. Like an animal. Take away the leash, but leave my collar. Just let me run! I'm being smothered at school, at home...everywhere I go. 

Dad: ""Are you going Goth!?""

Grandma: ""Don't let your anger kill out your creativity Alyx...""

Mom: ""Work hard in school, go to college, get a good paying job!""

People at School: ""Are you alright? Are you going anti-social?""

Well you know what...I'm going Anti-LaConner, Anti-Family! ANTI-HAPPINESS! I hope thats what you've all been waiting to hear, because there it is...you broke me. I hope it was worth whatever you all gained. Because now I've got to spend the time and mend it. I'm going through another one of those moods...which I haven't got many of lately, as opposed to when I would get them every day. I suppose I should be thankful. So, I thank you...you know who you are, whether you're actually reading this or not. I thank you for being there, for opening my eyes, and for helping me. I would name you...but I don't see the point, and I don't see the need. This break didn't last long enough for me...I need more of it. I need summer. I need a job, I need a life. I know that sounds selfish, and greedy. I just need to get away from all this stress...all these problems, and all the fits that are starting to catch up on me. I mentioned something, to my Father, about thinking I may have some sort of mood disorder...he snorted, laughed, and rolled his eyes. I don't think I can stand that look much longer, before I finally snap, and take a swing. I feel like a willow branch, you can bend and bend, and continue to bend...but it won't break. You've got to take something sharp to it, and saw away. Well...thats enough ranting for now, I suppose I've got to deal with it, huh?"

I miss it sometimes, but thats alright...because I prefer myself with out it. I'd rather be angry at just about everything that moves, or breaths, then happy bouncy sheep-type person. Sure, I've still got enough of my sanity to keep my parent's satisfied, but I've lost enough so I go kind of ""loopy"" every now and then. I wrote an awesome poem this week, dedicated to a guy friend of mine. I'm not sure he'll like it, since he's an awesome writer himself...but it was worth a try. I'll have to give it to him soon. I don't want to go back to school, ugh! I do want to see the gang again. Especially Joe, I need to weasel a picture out of him. Maybe I'll make a trade...yes, thats what I'll do. I'll write him a poem, in exchange for a picture. Damnit, he would've loved the one I wrote...then accidetally destroyed. Yes, accidentally. It was in my hoodie's pocket, and my niese decided the hoodie needed a mud bath. So I stuck it in the washer, poem and all. My hoodie's pocket looked like a paper machet storm struck, and it still kind of does. Paper does NOT come off...amazingly. I need to work on reviving that one. Best piece I've ever written. Certain parts of it stick into my mind, and I can recite about four different verses of it. But it was a frickin' long poem. Gah, that'll be fun...wracking [racking?] my brain for the rest of it. Shoot, I should get started on that...not to mention I've got CD's to burn. Ah well. I just got done cleaning the house [IE: vacuuming, folding and washing clothes, doing the dishes, putting away dishes, sweeping, and dusting] so I've got some money to spend tonight. I'm heading off to the mall in a little while, I need some new clothes...direly."

The shreds of everything I've worked so hard to keep together are failing...and I'm not sure why. There have been no large fights at home, and school is going...well, boringly along. Its just something that happens, or so I'd like to think. 

I'd like to lay down, and never have to move again. Now, I know that sounds selfish...but I feel as if I'm drowning. As if I'm being smothered. By parents, by family, friends...by life in general. I'm just getting kicked around lately. A lot. Not as much as usual, but it seems to hurt a lot more. Maybe...cause I'm actually starting to feel happy. I know why, but you don't have too. I've been introduced to a new way of life, something that appeals to me. Something that makes me want to run away, to be free...I know grief would overcome those who love me, or who think they love me. But others would toss it aside, use it as leverage for themselves. I don't mind...they could use it as much as they like. For I'd never have to look upon them again.

Is it wrong...to want to leave? To harbor thoughts of dropping your life entirely? I want to...these figments dance around my head. Teasing me with the idea, taunting the fact that I can't do it. Not yet anyways. College. Its my answer. I'd like to go to a college far away. So I'd rarely have to come home; just for a visit now and then. The thought of being able to leave everything behind me...brings a smile to my face, if only for just a moment. 

Have I gone insane? Or am I merely waking up to a different me...I don't know the answer; I'm sure none of you do either. But, it doesn't hurt to ask."

Well, I'm trying to do better on my updates...so, well, here they come. School still sucks, relationships do to. But recently I've met this guy, an older guy. Nick. I call him God. Just for fun. He's 17...I know, it's quite a bit older then I am, but we click. I mean, its an odd sort of emotional connection. I can't talk to anyone else about the stuff we talk about. He calls me Kid, just to fire me up. So I let him. No big deal. Its amazing though...the way some people are just made to be friends. I mean, like we can talk for hours. Literally. Where as the people I go to school with, I can only stand to be with them for so long. Before I start wanting to kill people, hurting something, or ripping things apart; that is. 

He's a writer too, a good one. Not to mention the fact that he's in a band; is it me, or do I always fall for the singers? I don't think its just me...well, guys in band, in general. Its deep writing though, its not really the kind of stuff you usually hear from a small town band. Its not love...Christ on a Cracker [Nick's saying], we all know I'm encapable of that.

You are<br>an angelic spirit who has fallen from grace for<br>one reason or another - possibly, you made one<br>tragic mistake that cost you everything. Or<br>maybe you were blamed for a crime you didn't<br>commit. In any case, you are faithless and<br>joyless. You find no happiness, love, or<br>acceptance in your love or in yourself. Most<br>days are a burden and you wonder when the<br>hurting will end. Sweet, beautiful and<br>sorrowful, you paint a tragic and touching<br>picture. You are the one that few understand.<br>Those that do know you are likely to love you<br>deeply and wish that they could do something to<br>ease your pain. You are constantly living in<br>memories of better times and a better world.<br>You are hard on yourself and self-critical or<br>self-loathing. Feeling rejected and unloved,<br>you are sensitive, caring, deep, and despite<br>your tainted nature, your soul is<br>breathtakingly beautiful.

No one's really<br>sure why, but at this point in your life you've<br>shut off emotion to the point of extreme<br>apathy. You are cold and indifferent much of<br>the time...or perhaps you're just a good<br>pretender. Next to impossible to get close to,<br>even those who do never see the real you. It's<br>entirely possible that YOU don't even know the<br>real you. You have a certain fascination or<br>attraction to destruction on a massive scale -<br>disasters, perhaps even death or the concept of<br>the Apocalypse. Because you hold so much<br>inside, one day you're simply going to snap.<br>Then the mask will fall away, and your true<br>wings will be revealed. Until then you will<br>deal with whatever comes your way in icy bitter<br>silence and acceptance. On the positive side,<br>you are fearless and immeasurably strong - not<br>much can crack through your defenses. You<br>intrigue people, who can't help but wonder why<br>you're the way you are. A loner and one who<br>spends much of their time brooding and<br>contemplating life and death - you are a time<br>bomb waiting to explode and create some<br>destruction of your own.

I fell this weekend, spent a little over a day in the hospital. I got a mild concusion, and really fucked up the muscles in my neck. To the point where it hurts when I swallow...pathetic, aren't I? It happened when I was snowboarding, first run of the day, during lessons. But like the dumbass I am, I finished out my lessons. $.$ And fell again...after lessons were over, I went to the ski place. They made me sit there, with snow on my head, for 5 hours...I was really FUCKING BORED.

Erm, Love life? Gah...mine is still BARELY there. Ok. Steve hasn't been on in a while, but just before he left we got into a small argument about ""us"" again. Although there really hasn't been an ""us"" for a while now. Ever since he got with Grace anyways. Tet, who I was seeing a while back, and I have ""gotten back together"" if that's what you would call talking once or twice, every week or so. I FINALLY told Alex how I feel about him, 2 weeks ago...but we really haven't talked since. He's been really busy, revamping his house. Remmy {a newer friend} has a crush on me...says he's ""practically in-love"" He's nice, really cute...but I'm just not really looking for a relationship anymore. Then there's Jeff, cute little Kuno. I like him...alot. He knows, but he's got a girlfriend. We were talking last night, and he was rating people. ""You're a 75...but, you could be more. Thats just from talking to you over the net."" I was like AWWWWW!! He doesn't know it, but he's like a 90 for me...*shifty eyes* Shhh, don't tell him. 

School sucks ass, as usual. I hate people 'round here. My classes go as...[in order, with added comments] Science [I hate this mutherfucking class], Social Studies [Isn't bad, the teachers awesome], Language [This teacher needs to get her head out of her fucking ass, and have some control], Algebra [Math is finally making sense, but I'd still love to shove all those numbers up who ever invented math's ass], Writer's Workshop [Fucking awesome class, I love it. You sit around and write, for an hour!!], Digital Media [Cool class, I'm in charge of the yearbook...but theres to many fucking preps. ""GImme that page Alyx"" ""Its taken..."" ""So?"" *wants to SMACK THE SHIT OUT OF ALL OF THEM*] and PE [I hate it, I hate it, I hate it]

Well...yeah, so life goes fairly well. Better then not, I should say...^^"

Ok, so I got this really good friend...and I really really like him. I dont know how to tell him either, and I know he doesnt feel the same way about me. But I still think I should tell him. Do guys like being told someone likes them, if they dont like them back? I dont know! :( But then I started thinking...he's one of the only guys in my life that I actually trust. And we're such good friends! I dont want to ruin that. So I guess I'll just let it be, with the flirting and such

But he's such a great guy. He's cute, and funny. And most of all...he understands me. He treats me so good!! I cant help but love him more then I should...he's alittle bit older then I am, being 16. He doesnt live around here either. But states away, with a few more friends of mine. *sigh* He's soo funny...ok ok. Im gonna stop. He's just a transition right? To help me get over the heart break? I hope not...:( 

On a happier note, I've been oddly cheerful lately. Its weird...like, really weird. I dont remember the last time I was this happy without the help of drugs. [Prescript, from the doc] Im almost afraid of myself...Oo; Is that weird? I think it is...</FONT></P>

"event","It does...really. Whether its the fact that its my birthday, and Christmas, and that my family goes absolutely nuts at this time of year. The fact that a new year starts within days, and such on. It just scares me. Its to busy. At my Mom's house, everything is psychotic. She gets so freaking stressed out, constantly cleaning a mess that isnt really there. Or making sure the cat is over fed beyond what he already is. At Dad's house, its alittle calmer, but my Granny and Aunt [Granny practically lives here, and Aunt lives across the street] take all the stress and go ""psycho women"" too. Not as bad as my Mom, but its still bad enough. Im only at my Dad's on the weekend, and I spend the rest of my time listening to my Mom either: 1. Complain about work  2. Clean the house constantly  3. Complain about me  4. Get drunk  5. Argue with my older sister about the holidays. *sigh*

Well, my birthday is coming up...we all know that. I really am not looking forward to it. Tonight, we're going to a play [which a friend of mine is in] and out to dinner...to celebrate my B-day. :( I dont want too. I dont want to be sung too, I dont want presents, I'll take the year older...but nothing else. Also, at school, Jeremy plans on making my day horrible. He is going to make sure the whole school knows; I dont know if I'll last the day. He's getting me a Christmas present and an X-Mas present. I feel bad. I never get people presents, but here all these people are getting me some...does that say something to you? It does to me. So Im gonna be working my ass off for the next week or so, just so I can afford something for everyone. 

What else is going on...oh right! The dance! It was fun, I learned some really cool [slutty] moves. I danced with alot of people, but a few guys in particular. One, who I kinda have a crush on, dances really closely. Alot closer then any of the other guys, and I really liked dancing with him. He's really cute, and really funny. But he's crushing on one of the popular girls. Who really bug me, if ya'll dont mind me saying so. Preppy. Im not going to get into it though, cause its really none of my buisness. I just think he's a good person, deep down, and needs to look for someone whose gonna treat him better. Oh well. 

I'll update again as soon as possible, but I may not be on much for the next week or so. WHOOT WHOOT! Less then a week 'till we're out of school on winter break.

"event","MEN!! Im talking about men, of course all you women know what Im thinking here...and the guys, well they're thinking 'WTF did I do?' To answer your question, EVERYTHING! You <u>were</u> born. Thats the start of your problems. People were born, thats the start of everyone's problems. I hate people. Men more so at this current moment, but people in general. Love is right along with those on my List. Love needs to die. Wither away until its a nothingness, and the only reason people talk anymore is to produce more offspring. A wonderful never ending cycle. The sudden uproaris hate against love you ask? Well Im in-love for starters, and I've been hurt one to many times for my liking. Hell! I can do once, and I can even do twice...but three times, two of those in less then a month time span? Thats just asking me to be unhuman, which I rather think Im becoming. 

Anyways, about the concert. It was awesome!! Fucking awesome! Although, I was there with my sister...her friend, and his 12 year old niese. The niese was sooo annoying, I sware to god I was gonna smack her head right off those scrawny little shoulders. She had more make up then my 22 year old sister, and me put together. She was constantly begging for money, she walked around ALL night with her shirt rolled up to where her bra would be {if she had one}, and let her stomach hang out. *SMACK SMACK* >_< People like that make me sick. WHAT A FUCKING LITTLE PREPPY BITCH! I, grrr....enough about her

The only bands I wanted to see were All American Rejects, and Simple Plan. For AAR we were up in our seats, but for SP my Older sister managed to talk this guy into letting us in. I MOSHED!! So proud of myself, although it wasnt really music you could mosh too...*sweat drop* I got a AAR shirt, and a Simple Plan poster *drool* They're all soooo hott. So we hung out for a while, and left right before Clay Aiken ended...he really sucked live. Im disapointed. So we went to Hooter's after that, and got dinner...and I got a free shirt, its cool. We hung out there for a while, dropped the niese off, and got this ""limo"" to drive us home.

So this fat little arabian dude pulls up in a town car, barely enough room for all of us. We're thinking <i>WTF is my limo!?</i> but it all turned out ok...man was this guy hilarious!! He's like really short, and he's got this huge coat on that practically covers his head!! Im talking to my sister, and we hear this loud THUMP sound. The guy makes this loud weird noise.
Guy: OOOCCCHHHH *grunt*
And then he huddles down in his coat, like all hunched over, and speeds the hell up.
Me: *blink*
Sister: Did...we just hit something??
Guy: I...I tink shooo
And the whole time, we're constantly looking out the window...trying to see. And my sister's friend is snickering like crazy.
Sister: Was...was it an animal?
Guy: I dont know
And he's like trying to dismiss the subject everytime
Sister: Well did it have 2 legs, or 4 legs?
Guy: *grunts again* 
And then he sped up even more!! 
Sister: Should...do you wanna stop and check?
>_< By this time we're like a mile away cause the guy is going so damned fast. 
Guy: NOOOOOoooooo, no
After that, we're talking again...still alittle weirded out.
Sister: We live right past the sign that reads ""Please dont drink and Drive""
Guy: I try not too
-.^ I was so confused. But it was soo funny. So we've got a new ""inside"" joke.
""Did we hit something?"" Or ""I try not too"" HAHAHAH!! Ok...so, its really not that funny. You kinda hadda be there for it to make you laugh like it makes us laugh. Oh well, enough about this...

"event","Well, I figure since Im trying tp update everyday...even though theres nothing to tell, I'd post before I head off to my Father's for the rest of the weekend. Its to early, *yawns* and no one is on. So poor Cat is left all alone, oh well. -.- It seems to me that whenever Im allowed on late, everyone else is 1) To tired 2) Grounded or 3) Not in the mood to stay up late. And whenever I get on in the mornings, no one is on!! *mutters nasty things about bakas* Oh well I guess, ya know. No reason in holding it against anyone...not really their faults, right? OR!! Maybe they've got their secret cameras trained on me from up above, in space. And everytime Im allowed on they send out this alert ""*ALERT ALERT* Cat will be on late tonight, so none of you can"" and so everyone obeys...wouldnt that just suck the hell out of life? I think it would. *nods* Erk, my Dad hasnt called yet (Thank gosh!) so I dont have to go over there...yet. I really dont wanna, but it only seems fair that I spend Saturday with him. I mean, after all, I am going to the concert on Sunday, and I was here Friday night. 

By the way, cleaning out the Ex-Step Dad's house went good. We got to dig through his drawers, and found alot of personal papers that the schmuk hasnt moved yet. He actually has almost all his stuff there still, the idiot. His furniture...ugh! Glasstop table, black chairs. Connect-o black couch, with shiny black strips. Shiny wooden dresser, wardrobe and bed. Along with a black comforter that matches the couch. His whole entire fucking house just screams SINGLE WHITE GAY GUY. I hate him. I really do. And hate is such a strong feeling, I try not to feel it. We had this cat (died, the baka ate a pointsettia leaf) and we had the catbox down the stairs, right before you went into the basment. He was horribly messy, and kicked litter everywhere. Well we didnt vacuum it that last week before we left, and when we went there (over a year later) all the litter was still there. Nothing had been touched. -.- Oh well, Im done complaining about these things
 
 I'll post as soon as I get back on Monday, to fill you all in on all the juicy details of the concert!

"event","More...shame on Cat's. -.^ Hehehe, well I apologize profoundly to any of my fans...if I've got any in the first place. :( Well...to explain alittle of what has been going on lately. Im stressed...oh so very stressed!! Mainly because ""T"" a guy I love, lied to me. Had a girlfriend...he ended up dumping her, asking me to take him back. Then, when I couldnt decide...he wanst sure who he wanted, her or me. So...he plans on deciding tomorrow, but I probably wont be on. *sighs* Im afraid he wont choose me...and I still love him, despite the fact that Im upset with him. I...almost hope he chooses her, just because...self esteem issues I guess. I dont know, and although I have made my decision, I wouldnt tell him. I dont want it to effect his!! Because then I would feel I did something to effect his decision, and that makes me feel guilty; which in turn makes me feel sick. Yeah, I start to feel sick when depressed or to stressed.
<br>
Another thing Im stressed about is school...school, has always been stressful though. I've got Science, which Im not doing bad in at all. I've got a B or something. Social Studies, I dont know what I've got in that class. Language, obviously a A or B. I always ace that class. Algebra, Im not doing so hot in that class...maybe a C. Boat Building, I think I've got an A or B in that one too. Then theres Spanish, erk! I dont know exactly what I've got in that class either -.^ And Health, who gives a shit about that class. AIDS/Sex/Drugs/Alcohol talk, with one of the teachers I really dislike. -.- It wasnt fun...and this is the second day, and she said ""I'll need to come back again, probably a few more times to finish this talk"" Eurrghhh!! I dont wanna...*tear* Oh well, I suppose its needed. AIDS kill, and I should know about them...but she's just so damned ""excited"" about the talk. She's a counseler, so she's...she's....I dont know, I just dont like counselers. And...the next problem
<br>
My birthday is a little over 2 weeks away, and Im going to a concert this weekend with my older sister to celebrate^^ It'll be fun, but its my first one...Im kinda worried. My parents are kinda smothering me, I guess my Granny talked to my Dad...cause he's letting me stay here on Friday. And then Im leaving on Sunday Oo; Not to mention a dance at school next Friday. Its totally unlike him, but Im happy my family is realizing who I am and that Im at the age that I wanna do stuff on my own more often. ^.- More enjoyable this way I suppose. Although there is nothing wrong with being open, and loose. Anyways...now that you have been slightly updated on my oh-so important life...Hahahah, not at all. My life isnt important at all. Not that it matters any, ^^ Oh well I guess. I post some more laters...

"event","Whooo^^ Today was a half-day, the first actual day of our ThanksGiving break. Fun, I guess. I really am not overly fond of Thanksgiving, cause I usually gotta spend it with my Dad and his family (Yes, I like to hope I have no relation to any of them) but this year...I getta spend it with my Mom. My older sister is coming up, with her boyfriend and his Mom...and a few other people are coming over. My Mum bought a 22 pound turkey!! >.< You'd think we were feeding half the population of my town!! But no, just the few people who are coming over to my house...along with 10 pounds of potatoes, and God knows what else!! 
 Also, the 23rd was my Niese's 4th birthday. We got her alot of Barbie things...although I hate Barbie ((Barbie needs to die...kill, burn, drown...burn))...really really hate Barbies. It doesnt matter, the twerp likes 'em, and it keeps her quiet. So its all good in the land of Me. My older sister dropped her off earlier this morning, and ended up cleaning our fish tank -.-!! It was all, euwww...and gross. Salt, calcium, and chlorine deposists everywhere...even on our walls. oO; The sides of the tank were almost completely green, and we only had 2 fish left alive. So, of course, Mom went shopping and bought a bunch more. So currently we have: Dr. Dweeb, Captain Fan Fin, First Mate One Eye, Da Vinci, Lips, and our snails...Gary and Larry. Before the fish was cleaned, it just so happened to smell like wet dog...and after pouring in the chlorine so we could scrub it, it smelt like over-powering wet dog who rolled around in some chlorine.
 Ah, what else. We've got a HUGE weekend. Whooo^^ Its gonna be well...lazy. Fun, Iono...maybe. Doubt that highly though, cause most time will be spent at my Dad's house. :( No real such thing as fun there. Although, I've got my new favorite movie, X2: X-Men United on DVD^^ It rocks...and I love it. Pyro, *drooling* is <u>sooo hott</u>!! Im obsessed...like completely. But I love Marvel, love X-Men, DareDevil, the Hulk, and SpiderMan!! Dam does Tobey McGuire look good in them tights, Yummy! 
 School lately, has been...school. Same as usual, lol. Although my classes are getting alittle harder, and my friends are starting to show their ""real colors"". If ya know what I mean, and Im starting to find who I can and cant trust. Oh well, ya know. Beggars cant be choosers. I guess I'll live with what I've got, deal with who my current friends are now...not alot I can do otherwise ^.-

"event","Of course it can, how stupid of me to ask. OH WELL!! -.- The reason things aren't going so hott, is well...obviously cause its winter. Heh^^ Yesh, Im not in a great mood...so my humor sucks. Im cold, I've got a cold [obviously], Im blowing my nose every 3 minutes. Headache, and...ugh! Im having my mid-life crises about 20 years early. Caught between...well, guys. 2 to be exact. They're both great in their own ways...but Im not going to go into detail about that right now. Im sick, and I dont feel good. Thats all really. I got homework, which I should be doing now...and I feel deprived. I dont know what of, just...like any one little thing could set off all my emotions that I've been bottling up for years. Fun explosion there, eh?
<br>
Well one good thing. <b>December 7th is the Jingle Bell Bash! Hell yea!</b> If you havent heard, which you havent...my older sister got me first row seats, and a backstage pass to the Jingle Bell Bash. I getta meet one of the bands, and I got some of the best damned seats in the place! Whooo!!! Its gonna be fun. Cause before that, we're gonna go get somethin' to eat from her restaurant [Hooters, she's a manager] then we're gonna go to the concert, then we'll go to her house...stay up all night doing stupid things^^ Stupid sisterly things. So what if it only starts now that she's 23, and Im __, it doesnt matter. Atleast its going, and atleast we've got a good relationship now. I suppose, what happened when we were younger...does matter, and it does effect the way I think of her. Well of course it does. Ah well, time for slacker Cat to go do her homework. Laters^^

"event","Whooo^^ Know I havent posted lately, I've been...eh, busy I suppose. School, staying after alot lately. I hate doing that. School is annoying. It needs to well, die....or something. Anyways...what have I been doing this week? Not alot...I gotta admit, I've been a lazy ass. Thursday night, there was this meeting at 7:00 Pm for those people who wanted to do ski bus. I want to do ski bus, but I showed up at 6...it was pitch black out, and freezing!! And Im standing there waiting, thinking <i>Where the fuck is everyone!?</i> So I getta walk home, and wait for my Mom to get there...so she can take me back. -.- She doesnt get home till like 7:15! Ugh, there goes my meeting. Oh well, ya know? Good thing...I can just get the information from the office, which I will be doing on Monday...if I can remember. Ah well, what else? LESS THEN A MONTH TO MY BIRTHDAY! WHooo...I got a guitar, yes...I already have it. Wanna know why?
So my Mom and younger sister get home, and Im sitting on the computer. Sister walks upstairs, grinning like the stupid idiot she is.
Sister: I know what we got you!
Me: Shhhh
Sister: I KNOW WHAT WE GOT YOU!
Me: SHHHHH!
Sister: I know what we got you, and Im not telling you!!
Me: Shut up!! I dont care!! 
[By this time, Im VERY curious]
Sister: I know you wanna know...and Im not telling you!!
Me: If you dont shut up...
Sister: I know what we got you!!
Me: If the next word out of your mouth isnt what you got me, then SHUT UP!
Sister: GUITAR!!
Me: Oo;
So, she told me. Easy...caving, folding...stupid...little twerp that I wanan beat in sooo badly. Anyways, about my guitar. Its old!! Right handed, accustic, soft string. Brown, and a light tan color. I love the way it sounds...the case? Well its kind of 'ghetto' as the boys at school say. Im afraid the stupid plastic handle is gonna fall off...its a cream color, with blue denim looking fabric on the sides. Its almost military looking, cause its got an eagle holding arrows/american flag print. Kinda an eye sore if you ask me, so I think Im gonna cut some paper and tape it on...then completely cover it with stickers, and stuff. ^^ That'd be more me anyways. But I love it already...[got it yeserday] and I named HER Maria. Yesh, I named my guitar...and yesh, it is a HER.

Today was lazy, I didnt feel good. I was gonna pull a Robert [I say that because the boy at our school named Robert walked out of class during 1st period, and just left...oO;] right after 5th period [Boat Building] cause...ugh! I just wanted to lay down and sleep. I almost feel asleep during 4th period Algebra...hehe; Oops! Lol. Oh wellz, ya know. Cause I got all weekend to sleep, and play Maria. I wont be updating again this weekend...oO; its, weekend after all. Which means Im at my Father's, which means Internet is almost off limits...unless I sneak on. Which I do alot...ah well, he's gonna be gone tomorrow night. I dun know why, all I know is Granny will be here...and she'll let me on^^ Ugh...Cat needsa go take some tylenol, and sack out on the couch wiff Maria, some chips, a soda...and a good movie. Well, maybe Maria needs a nap too^^

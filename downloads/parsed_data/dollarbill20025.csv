She then tells him to come and ask for himself. After that follows a ritual that I had long forgot. He is shy and slow-witted, while she is cruel and heartless. Yet she don't run him away but she don't give him her number and asks him why her. Tells him that he don't know her. He tells her that he thought she was nice and just wanted to meet her. She continues to torment him while teasing him, like he may have a chance but he has to work at it. Mating never changes I guess.......Me?...where is my Ms. Goodhead>>>>>>>"

Never mind what your estranged may have molded in the childs character to complicate things.

If not a go of it at least move some product thru out the beltway. I got a gig coming out moving product and lots of it all around the beltway. I do not have to drive so it should be no pressure on me. The pressure however for the product can get a little bit testy. The demand for the product this time of year is immense. The customers sometimes are very emotional. The product is one I normally shy from because of the high demand. To not have the product there on time is sometimes not a forgivable offense...Yes i am speaking of Girl Scout cookies. The demand is brutal and the pace is furious. When u enter the world of big cookie sales, u enter a world where few have left untouched by the unrelenting trauma of the event. Can I cut the cookie....."

"event","I first met Mr. Brown while at the Durham shelter. It seemed he was trying to get a contract in the Eastway development deal. Seeing that he was up against it. He solicited participation from the underprivileged to broker a deal that the city was of course giving to a big-bucks out of town investor. He was passionate, fiery and not to be denied. Often intimidating, but only those that normally attempt to intimidate the less than privilege. His style and appearance(he was a huge black man) did not bode well with the city hall clan that of course never has time for the small man but only for the next big conglomerate deal they can ascertain.     I speak of him as if he was dead, but he is not. Not in the practical sense any way.  He is incarcerated! Is he a ""Saint'. I doubt it. But to read Thursday' s edition of the Herald Sun you would think he is on the 10 most wanted list. To me he is a hero. A fighter.  I am sure even in jail he will remain a fighter. Everything he has done has been discredited. I wonder why?"

"event","Talking to my friend Mike Mcgee made me realize a couple of things. I will begin by telling about Mike. Typical white dude. 6'7"", blonde, glasses too thick to tell what color his eyes are. But he is kool. Perhaps a nerd. (I never figured out why he is in and out of the shelter).He loves to conversate w/me. Maybe because I am the only one to understand what he is saying. Perhaps I am the only one that will take time to pay him any attention.     He wants to know why I don't organize a group and take them down to the Town Council. The Town Council is of course going no where fast. Their so-called ten year plan to end homelessness in Orange county is 'dead in the water'.  The reason is of course they won't put any money into the thang. It will never work just talking about it and everyone knows this. I mean they allocated millions to build an animal shelter.(none have been allocated to build a new homeless shelter)(not to mention-no one wants it in their neighborhood).   Any way Mike wants me to take some action to the Town's steps.       I did not even bother to tell him of my efforts to ban some people together when  I was 'no trespass for 2 yrs for B A H (black and homeless) on campus. O.K. I did a mild infraction. School kids do it every day. I caught a UNC death sentence. Guess why I was really treated that a way? Who over 18 has never seen porn? Show me two(that doesn't live under a rock)        Back to the organization, though. Most guys have too many other issues to even consider one of this magnitude. They have to consider things like existing, staying out of jail, being unemployed, being homeless, being penniless, and being poverty stricken. Doing something about it? That is someone else's job!"

Have i really let the man monopolize my time like that? how could Willie Earl actually let that happen? ..Anywho, life is good. God is good! Istill have my part time job. Still have my good health. Not to mention a perpetual hard-on. Where is Ms. Goodhead when u need her? Once again I don't ask for much out of life. I just feel it is every man's right to have some good throat at his beck and call!!!  This is so anti-American. I wonder if i can sue the government for this??"

"event","God is good all the time! i wonder how the people in the Gulf coast states feel about that right now? So many inadequacies in the world and what can b done about them. i have my own. My privilege to go to a public library on the UNc campus has been revoked! What my options to rectify the situation. I may even go to jail telling them how wrong it is. Will that help? Probably not but I am desperate in a desperate time."

I don't know whether that is a blessing or a sign of destruction on the way. I know i need to move out of where i am and move on. But where i don't know. I just know i need employment, my own place and regular throat! If there is a God, and I know that there is.

This wenton until he was on the verge of tears. Thenext day one of the lifeguards sprayed me w/waterhose and i retaliated by throwing water on her fm a nearby bucket. Later finding out that it contained chrlorine. I had to answer questions aboutthe incident for 3 days.......Ahh, the weekend I think i will go to Durham and see iffin any loose throat is laying around anywhere--------"

I know that i am too talented for this.....Why ask why?.....Why does it seem(my humble opinion)that the hotties all ways give up the mind-blowing sex to someone that doesn't appreciate it. I can really actually remember talking to so many guys that don't like head or women that give it to them! Go figure? Here i am world, I love head!  If there is a God(and i know that there is)here my plea and please hurry and matchmake me up with my soulmate(a woman that enjoys,thrives,loves to give good_____head)and i promise i will b good. Amen!!!"

"event","My first week back in the work force. It was hell. i love my job. The kids are all demon kids fm hell. i know that things have changed and everything is different. I mean when i was a kid if u were bad the teacher spanked u and when u got home u got another spanking. Now the kids know u can't do anything and they run the show. Even the good ones are bad. They know the rules better than u and they use them well. They only call me 'Mr Willie"" when they want sumpthin.      It's all a test. I have one white girl in my group. I have the 11-12 year olds. the biggest kid in the class is ten. She sees everyone else teasing him and calling him names and she attempts it. He went ballistic! I had to phsically restrain him. And he was after her. He was fed up. But i could just imagine the implications. White girl plummeting by big black kid! Not on my watch! .......I am glad to have a job, but now i know that no job is a pie job. This was suppose to be easy, but it is so frustrating. I have no power. the inmates are running the asylum!!!"

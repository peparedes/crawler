I don't know why I care. I don't know why I refuse to smoke around him when I drink (cause that's not a shocker) and I also don't know why I am the only person who is forced to feel like shit 4 years later. Oh well, I should have known. It's karma. And it's a bitch. well...actually, I was the bitch. Anyways, this is boring, huh?

packed tonight, suprisingly light compared to usual where I take everything I own. I probably am leaving out something uber importante, but I will deal with that I guess. I just don't feel overjoyed about going back...I feel home here. I feel home anywhere BUT Uk, let's be honest. I have never liked it enough to brg about it, and I usually like everything to that point. I guess one more year won't kill me...here's to hoping for the best again."

"event","i just got back from sober driving...but it was fun. I took it as a compliment that one of my UL peeps said, ""I've never had a friend who could have fun sober."" lol...I prefer not to most the time, but I know how the DD situation is in the ville and figured it wasn't much to give up. Like i need alcohol anyways...Red Bull and I'm hyped.

then I took a huge hit to my heart when someone told me my ex (see previous journal...the one about always having something there, blah blah)basically hates me. Or really really dislikes me. Oh well, I guess that's out the window. And I know it was in HS, but if it didn't matter, why is it STILL an issue. Why do people think they know me based on what he said? I'll have to laugh at this one daywhen some lucky guy marries me. Then I'll know what this crappy feeling was for. Until then...

goodnight. too many emotions right now :-("

"event","MUCH TO UPDATE ON KIDDOS:

Wow, summer is coming to a close, and I am neither happy nor sad at this point. I feel like I wasted most of my time home anyways, just working and coaching...I rarely let myself have fun to the degree I normally do...it was an awkward time I guess. I felt in limbo all summer, just trying to get readjusted for living in the Lou and then trying to prepare myself for letting go of the Lou. This is so sad, but I should be used to it by now. I wish I would have went to UL in the beginning I think...one of two regrest in my life. Only 2, not bad.

the second is being a selfish, scandelous, completely STUPID and shortsighted 17 year old who let the best guy go...I know, I know, this is so juvenile, but I have been thinking a lot about him and the situation lately. Probably because I have randomly run into him. Oh well, I guess I shouldn't be so hard on myself since I was 17...not an excuse, but certainly a disability in a way. Let's be honest.

Finally, this weekend in Chicago was nothing short of A-Mazing and memorable. Kate and I left Lou around 5 and got to CHicaco around 10:30 our time (9:30 to Caito)...so we got there fast, no problems, ready to drink and catchup with best friends. We went shopping, I bought some sweet ass ALDO shoes on Magnificent Mile, enough said, and we just took the L all over the city, mainly getting lost and using exaggerated southern accents to find our way back. The ride back was kind of redic seeing as we somehow missed 65south and went East on 80 about 150-200 miles OUT OF THE WAY. Oh well, we only added a total of about 2 hours onto the trip, and let's be honest again, other than gas money, we had nothing to worry about. It was lovely, and I am falling more and more in love with Chicago. I was hoping I would grow out of it, but it looks like I will always think of moving there. More on that later.

Pics later too. I still can't figure it out."

"event","Today has been one of those reflective, ""why am I such a brat about MY life and self-centered"" days. I love these days and truly wish I had chosen a career where I could feel this more often. I guarded at UL for a deaf camp...it was really amazing how smart they are and how much I had to learn compared to the youngest at 5. They knew what I said when I said it if they read my lips and they taught me some too so I wouldn't be talking to myself a lot. I get to go 2 more times this week and I can't wait. Damn it's fantastic how good it feels to see that something we take for granted is what they rely on. The funny thing was that, as usual, I was a 1million question asker and said whatever I thought b/c I was so interested. To some people it comes off as being an airhead, but I really wanted to know things. Whatever. i learned how they drive without being able to hear horns, how to gettheir attention...and more importantly...that they laugh louder than I do. Well @ least God let them have that, I have never been so happy to hear the international language of LAUGHING. My forte.

Lesson two occurred @ my second job of the day with the old lady water aerobics...and that is normally funny and alarming at the same time, but I also picked up on another pointer. One of the ladies was saying how she was moving to another house outside of this current comfortable community, and said, ""I wonder if I am making a mistake."" Weird, I thought I was  the only one making them. Apparently, at the ripe age of 60-something or 70's, mistakes and risks are still there. Life is always a gamble I suppose, which is neither disappointing or a shock really. I guess you gotta take big risk to have big rewards...I am oh so cheesy. wtf??

Vacation was amazing, especially considering it is my last real family vacation that is gratis...my brother and I really just did SNL skits on the beach the whole time, swam in the ocean non-stop and attempted to surf without waves...bacially, it was a funny trip. It's weird b/c when I was sitting there I thought, ""Shit, this time next year, I'll have a degree from UK."" WTF?? It makes me mad...I wish I could change my major lol, but I know I am good at what I picked. shit.

Anyways, this summer has flown by, I can barely believe it will be July at the end of the week. I am not sad about it though, I feel so weird being home. Usuaully I love it and HATE going back to the sorority house (and I inevitably will complain about that since it is always an adjustment in august), but I need to be around UK people...and fast. I was joking with UL peeps about how much different I am at UK and when I am home...mostly because ""drunk"" here is nothing like what is successfully drunk at UK. You go big or go home. And I miss that.

Not likely since I have a great sense of people ... although the men always are difficult. I don't get it. And it's not like I am one of those girls who needs the attention or the relationship...not that there is anything wrong with that, but I always thought my independence was a plus. I was reading in Glamour today that being TOO independent (ie- I had all the traits) is a huge negative for a guy. Upon hearing about any of my interactions/talks/encounters with ANY of the male species, Sam always says, ""Oh, Carolina, he looooves you. He does."" Well, if that were true, why have I been so single?? Ahhh hell, it doesn't matter...someone will definitely get me one day, maybe I don't need that right now.

I think I am going to get more involved like I used to be with the church. i don't know when in college I lost that, but I am ready to pick it up again. I seriously am getting so old.

Kate left early and sam stayed the night and we chatted as usual about all the stress and drama in our lives (mainly from boys). Apparently her mom says I am a good role model about that since I delete men and awful people frm my phone book (ie- my life). hahaha...glad I am helping her realize how amazing she is and that you don't need a guy to make you feel like that (although one day a guy will be smart enough to know it, admit it and tell you all about how fabulous you are). I hope she sees that in the next few years.

Let's hope it is the later.

work went well today, it went fast. damn it was hot, I put on SPF 30 every hour...and I still got sun. I should be mexican looking in approx. 2 weeks. Then to Panama...I hope my hair stays dark so I look exotic. It's about all I've got going when I am short, not skinny and not big boobed. hahaha. whatev.

looks like I need to go to Lexington soon. I hope to find time to do that soon b/c I miss people more than I ever have. I wish I could fly to Chicago and hang with Caito too, but I'll have to wait for her birthday maybe...oh well. I might just go anyways. Who knows, I guess I could do that instead of FL.

I hate that I miss out on my family and especially my little brother's stuff, but I feel like I am constantly waiting for something to happen, someone to run into my room, a funny drunken story, being hungover and cruising. it's not even an issue of missing things, it is just that those things are so much a part of me and for the first time, I realize that. Damn, I can't imagine graduating and how this will feel when that is over. I guess every ending is a beginning though. corny, akk.

If you want to know my mood/attitude/feelings just tune into dave barnes and you'll probably get me. I don't know what has come over me...I really think I'm at a crossroads...we'll see where this goes. I could be totally different by the time august rolls around, I have seriously just been forced to learn and deal with a lot in 3 weeks. ahh I hate growing up.

quote from Jean--> ""When you're young, your whole life is about the pursuit of fun. Then, you grow up and learn to be cautious. You could break a bone or a heart. You look before you leap and sometimes you don't leap at all because there's not always someone there to catch you. And in life, there's no safety net. When did it stop being fun and start being scary?""

pool opens tomorrow, pulling 40-50 hour weeks with the two pools, then more time with the two hockey teams...but you know i like to be busy. it distracts me from the above. just like sleep lately. how sad."

kinda creepy cause his dr. hit on me, 3 times...and it was direct. and it was weird. and I hope my brother would have kicked his ass. i love how my demographic is until 16 and over 40...thanks. great. do ANY 20-24 year old men like me!?

had a dream that high schools had facebook...weird i dreamed about FB, but it was funny. the whole world would be stalked...I hope that dream never comes true.

gotta guard tonight, but spending all day helping my bro with studying for his finals, although he has a 4.0 at Trinity either way...damn he is smart, damn I am proud. It goes to show that maybe this Catholic school thing people bash really isn't that bad. It shapes men. A lady was walking towards the door of the dr.'s exit with a stroller and a young toddler plus and infant and my brother leaped up to grab the door for her and help her out. That was amazing. Cheesy, but I think it is cool that at 15 he doesn't care what people think, he knows what is nice, classy and chivalrous. We've got ourselves a classy lad ya'll."

As for today, I am off since we have the pool ready to open officially on Friday, although I guard a couple times this week for the swim team before the pool actaully opens. damn athletic kids...good luck with that cold water. If I have to jump in for anyone I will hurt you.

Last night I basically slept like every other night, I tend to sleep a lot now...I think it is because I can be stress free there and nothing bothers me...and because I might have mono. In that case, it would explain why I choose sleep over bars. Maybe I am just trying to change for real...and not going out is a step in the right direction, at least not going out EVERY night offered. I need to learn to say no.

If bad news comes in 3's, I would put ""getting very ill"" as #1, ""not being able to go on the trip"" as #2 and now for #3...my grandparents (Dad's side) came over last night and although I couldn't get close b/c everyone is paranoid about me having the plague lol, I found out later why they were over. They come over all the time so I didn't think otherwise, but apparently my grandpa (the one from Greece, whom I vowed to get to Greece and learn some of the language before he died) has only about 15% working kidneys, which is apparently not good. People have lived off dialisis for 20 years at times, but not at his age they said. So, I guess I need to stop denying the inevitable and stop by more often since I am lucky to even have 4 grandparents and I am 21. Sucks. But what can you do?

on another note, I called my bestest last night to vent more on how I felt about Nashville boy and the whole not calling thing...which most of you will have no idea what I am talking about but that's okay...and instead of giving me the normal, ""no, he is a nice guy and is just dumb it's not your fault deal"" she said ""well, it was fun, but it's not like either of you would want a longdistance thing. He should call, but you'll look back and think it was fun eventually."" ummm, well, I always knew she was honest, it is one of her strongest points, I guess I needed to hear it. Oh well, shit happens...no, we need to change that phrase...Carolyn happens. I suck @ life it seems.

I hope to figure myself out this summer more, take the things that are negative in my life and seriously turn them around. It is always a battle for me when I miss so much about where I am not, UK. I never thought I would miss it...it took 3 years to actually miss it. I guess that means I lived right, but now I feel in limbo. No boyfriend (thanks for the constant reminder mom), no walking-distance friends (at least a 15 minute drive to anywhere), no sorority house to entertain my audience, no frosty fridays, no avio, no hangovers...I want so bad to have a UK hangover. There is a such a thing, as much as I love UL, it has nothing on our hangovers. I wake up laughing and wondering what the hell happened sometimes, but I know I was A) taken care of and B) not alone, @ least 4 sisters are in the same boat.

Yesterday I work at the pool from about 9:45-3 and then went to my annual Jefferson County swim test so I can guard another summer...4-8. Cool, I was dizzy at work all day and juts not myself...but I figured I was just hot. So at the swim thing we start the class with 20 laps (500m) and follow up with saves, spinals, chemistry course...cool. Last one of my life however since I graduate from UK in a year and won't be lifeguarding anymore. Weird to think I won't be doing that hell of a class again...EVER. Anyway, I basically swam for 3 hours and was ill the entire time but knew I had to get it over with.

Later I get home and my mom takes my temp and I have 102...so I am on fire on the inside. I didn't sleep much and made her take me to the immediate care center this morning b/c I was in too much pain to wait for a doctor to see me...and thus, the strep test ran negative. I might have mono, it might just be a passing normal virus...no way to know for a week. Awesome since I was supposed to go to Charleston with my cousin, her husband, and their 7week old baby tomorrow-sunday. I am so pissed. Even if it wasn't mono the dr. recommended NOT being around an infant (obviously) for that long. I am super upset about it and super pissed I am having hot and cold flashes.

Last night I went out yet again with DZ gals from UL, and as I walk into a house that I thought only had 4 poeple max drinking in it...there stands my first love. I mean, we go back to gradeschool, we dated for a while in high school and he will just always make me have butterflies, even if I haven't seen him in 3 or so years. Weird. I decided to not make things weird and just walk up to him and say hi since I knew he wouldn't cause he is uber shy. Things went well, apparently my friend gave him a little heads up that I would be there, but I still think we were both in shock. He'll have his master's in engineering the december after I get a mediocre bachelor's lol...but he is a genius, thus more reason to kick myself in the ass. His friend did mention that although I have blamed myself for the breakup 4 years ago, he tells people it was him. Kinda sad, I didn't deserve someone as good as him. And he has a gf, whom all his friends say I am way cuter than. It's not important though. Okay, it is lol.

Fourth Street was fun, I ended up getting left just like I do at UK but it works out because I am becoming good friends with the SAE's here and they take good care of me. It's so different than at UK, but then again, that's why I love them. Good times, I'm off to a banquet with my brother and mom, Dad is still in Alaska doing his engineering thing.

Here goes a run-down of what you've missed...well, some, I'll keep it brief, comment for details (Liz, I know you will laugh about parts):

-Moved home Friday from school and it wasn't weird so much as it was awkward...there was this air of inconvenience surrounding me and my family...like them helping me for hours was a hassle (as I am sure it was). Oh well, I am just paranoid, but my room at home now looks worse than it ever did at school (imagine).

We put our ""Dame Faces"" on and had huge hats and fancy dresses and shoes...nothing about the day was without perfectly executed detail. I got to mix and mingle with possible employers from all over the country and get to hang with the one woman whom I love more than any other...oh, and I won 5 races...oh, and I picked the Derby winner (because he wore DZ colors) even though he had 50-1 odds (largest longshot in a million bazillion years apparently). Clearly, I had no idea what that meant anyway, so $102 return on a $2 bet is fantastic. then...

-Saturday night Caito was in town and her and some DZ gals from UL all went to an SAE preparty and then O'Shea's on Bardstown Road. ummm...can we say A-Mazing?? I met, or re-met rather, a guy who is an SAE there and we hungout pretty much all night, good times, sweet guy, probably a deadend like every other situation, let's be honest. mmmm one day.

IF YOU HAVE MADE IT THIS FAR, HIGH FIVES ALL AROUND. THANKS.

-Sunday, Mother's Day proved to be alright...except for the fact that with all the shit going on all weekend and week for me, no one remembered to buy my Mom anything. WTF?? I am terrible. I ordered her a cute key chain thing, silver, with my brother and my name on it...should be here soon though. My mom always gets the stuff for my Dad on Father's Day and wraps it with our names on it, but my father forgot, and then made me feel like shit about it. welcome home. apparently she cried, I am going to hell and I deserve it. hopefully I can make it up to her.

-I have been working 8-2 everyday this week pretty much, landscaping and setting the pool up for another summer at the country club...I won't complain, I love the people I work with (well, a handful or so) and I love getting money, so hopefully this summer is busy enough to distract from all the people and fun I miss at UK. Although, this is my last months living at home, so I will take it all in with patience and love. right.

***sorry so long, I promise I will update more often to avoid this annoying length of a story, again, comment if you want details on the derby night thing, it's pretty fabulous. Miss ya'll, visit soon, keep in touch.***

love always,
lilCP"

"event","man, it is only wednesday, and it seems like I have been stuck in this finals week for about a month. Maybe it;s b/c everyone I know is finished and I have yet to take a single exam. Out of 6 classes, I only have 3, but I also took one of them weeks ago and had to write 12 page papers for the others...so I havent been bored this week. I haven't had the chance to be stressed b/c there is no time for that. oh well, this might be hte most boring topic ever.

Samantha and I were at the brary forever last night, I really thought we might pull an all-nighter, but we chose to come to the house and have a sleepover on the livingroom floor and wake up early to study. It kinda worked...I feel okay with my exam in 30 min, but I havent started for the one at 3:30...shit. Let's pray God loves me...

I am really just keeping my eyes on tomorrow...all I have to do is turn in my huge term paper and take a spanish exam at night, then it is off to celebrate being a senior (eek) with CK and the DZ hoes...I'll sure miss everyone. I can't even talk about it, but this summer and Derby is really getting me excited about being home. I miss my brother and I miss working and having a paycheck...so this should be a great summer. ohh Louisville, Louisville! Wish me luck today, and ""EFF YOU IF YOU'RE FINISHED, YOU ANNOY ME."""

"event","damn let's be like everyone else and say finals suck....but honestly, they don't. People might think I just don't care or I have it easy, but I just know that there are some things worth worrying and stressing about and this is not one of them. I THRIVE off weeks like this, it motivates me. I wish all of campus went to the brary all the time so I could get more work done throughout the semester. I am super freakedout that I am a senior at the end of the week...a freakin senior. 

I was telling Sam that its weird, because when you are at certain ages in life, you kind of visualize what being a future age will be like and what you'll be like. I used to think I would be so different than I am now, but seriously, I am discovering that I am just the same girl is pigtails, but stuck living out her glory days in college. So strange, I am not who I thought I would be at this point, but I like who I am for the most part...so oh well. I guess that's life.

I finally finished the 12 page paper, it only took about 8-9 hours total minus the unused time...although it wasnt wasted time b/c I got to hang with my favorite brary friends, big dog thompson and sammy sosa. yesss... can't believe I'll be home this time next week. Can't believe I will be off to a distant and strange city to start my own life in one year...how did this happen??"

"event","For a Saturday, and for a college student...I got more accomplished today by 2pm than most other people. Normally I wouldn't rub it in, but I feel like I acutally accomplished something today. I didn't get to Louisville until almost midnight, we woke up at 6am and started the mini-marathon at 7:30am. Seriously, I thought all week that I was going to fail royally...but I did really really well. Funny thing was that 
A) I didn't train...I ran maybe 4 days a week since I had a crazy schedule and would rather go out or sleep
B) I drank...often. Dehydration what??
and C) sadly, I smoke cigs when I was drunk and stressed...and that's clearly not positive for running.

Yet, I learned that I mentally still have it to make it in the running world. I wish I would have trained and been a good person so I could have placed, but oh well. I did it. yessssss.

The Best News though was that when I jokingly (but you know, not so jokingly) mentioned that when I graduated i na year that I would like to backpack through all of Europe for a couple months...just get Europasses and stay in hostiles...it would be eye-opening and the last little rebellion before the ""Real world"" of life. I have mentioned it before, about a year ago, and my parents acted like I was smoking drugs...but when I mentioned it today my Mom said, ""Sweetheart, that is great. I think you should definitely take time to do that and not regret passing it up."" My Dad even nodded the ""okay."" WTF?? I was pleasantly suprised...so who's down in May 2006?? Apparently I am going to do this...and then maybe get a job in London...that would be a dream come true."

I had one of the best times I have ever had at Avio...and I'm pretty sure it;s because I thought it would suck royally. However, I went with Kate and her nuring school friend and we just had a great time. I ran into the new girls, I talked to the hottest man on campus (the welch's grape jam dream one...you know what I'm talking about) and I drank probably more than I wanted.

It was Chris Sherry's b-day at midnight, and I am pretty sure I gave him a kiss for it. Wow. Message to boys: tell me it's your birthday. I get ot go home tonight and see some of my girls and run super early in the morning...apparently Matt H. might come watch, which would be fun to watch honestly...because the Derby Events are amazing. Anyway, I'm gonna be happy when it is ver and I can study. This might be the last summer I spend in the ville, so I am looking forward to spending it with my lil brother who rocks my socks. William!"

"event","sometimes I feel like Carry on ""Sex and the City,"" no sickos...not for the reason of the title of the show, but because I am often helping poeple with relationships and I can't even figure my own out. I was walking down the street and I overheard a woman saying, ""in 10 years he'll be wondering what he was thinking."" I wanted to turn around and say, ""WTF are YOU thinking? In 10 years, you'll be the only one thinking 'what was he thinking.'"" It doesn't mean you suck, it doesn't even mean he sucks...it means you have something better waiting out there. What the hell is wrong with people? (PS- this will be me in a month I guarantee it lol)

I've had a good week that went by super fast, I've basically been going to class and hanging with sam who is turning out to understand me very well...and great support for this stage in my life. I hate growing up...one year. I can't believe our seniors are leaving...it's going to hit me during Fall Rush that I am the next to go, and that will not be a good moment. shit. when did I grow up??

class and Target with the girls, then the gym and library...fun fun! I can't WAIT for next Thursday...I am so nervous for this race Saturday...I hope I make it. eek, I am such a slacker."

I need to figure out if I hav a sign on my head that says, ""please, make me feel like crap."" I was complaining to weber and whoever talked about summer that I didn't want to move home for the summer...that there was nothing great there for me...that if it weren't for a good paying job, I would stay in Lexington.

Then I am hit with all these stupid boy situations and overall issues that relate only to UK and then I knew, I needed a hint, but I knew that maybe I need to stop running from the place I will always call home. I guess that I just don't understand the American Dream of moving from home to start your life...my life has been started, and time and time again, the poeple in the ville always complete it. I love all my friends from here, but I am now looking very forward to asummer spent with nice people who make me who I am. I am sick of Lexington,  UK boys, bad choices, school, Nicholasville Road, drama and more than anything...the way this place makes me feel. I'll now quit dreading being home and thanking God I have 3 months to get UK out of my hateful system.

running 10 miles with hottie Matt H. later...hopefully I don't pass out. Maybe then I'll feel okay too. Mini- in 4 days, FUK.

I am the Queen of Procrastination this semester...but as I was telling <lj user=""dzgirl18"">, it's usually for good reasons. I'd like to think that when my Mom tells me to ""be random and spontaneous in college, you won't regret it"" that she didn't mean to put school work to the side. But seriously, I won't look back and regret OAR concerts and late night movies...I would regret missing that stuff.

I shacked in the dorms hahaha (with my grandlil <lj user=""dzgirl18"">) and talked about life I guess...I feel obligated to make her and the rest of my baby DZs how fast senior year hits you...I am looking at one year left and it freaks me out. WTF?? My best friends are getting degrees...DEGREES. How the hell did I get here? IT is so weird.

I have a much better week filled with studying and a paper, which is a great turn from last week's complete hell. I hope I am in a better mood since there is less stress, although the mini-marathon (13.2 m) is Saturday and for the first time in 1999, I don't feel ready. I feel ""in shape"" and can run forever, but I don't know how I'll do and that is new for me. I usually know I'll do great, but I just haven't had the time this semester to kick it into high gear really...damn gurl.

gotta finish this take home exam and then head to class, I will definitely need a nap later. ohhhh hell.

I have great friends in the ville of course, many of whom I am close with at school, but it's different there. I am different there. I am much more grounded and focused on being what my family wants me to be...although I am pretty sure the priorities always swing back to normal in the Fall. I have just had the most amazing year of my entire life. Honestly, how did I get so lucky? Here's my little send off to some awesome peeps from the year who made it awesome somehow (it's long, scroll to your name, lemme know if I forgot u):

<lj user=""enliven"">- we are completely different people with completely different ways of thinking and guiding our lives, but I think you have shown me how to look at things differently and laugh more often. You always were there when boys sucked, school kicked my ass and new member ed. made me cry often...I love you for helping me through the biggest transitional year in my life so far.

<b>Kate-</b> classy dames and white trucks, sig ep formal, shacking excursions, Heaven Hill...I could go on for years about what we have accomplished this year lol...you are truly an amazing person and even better friend and sister. I am so glad we had each other through 3 car accidents and multiple family issues...I wouldn't be the person I am without you telling me to write mean people out of my life. I love you for teaching me to ""fuck the dumb shit"" basically.

<b>Caito-</b> I am still pissed you left me to go to UL, but it has actaully brought us a little closer, so i guess I'll forgive you. You always know what to tell me to make any situation better, and I love when you tell my ex's that they are idiots...I don't know how I have made it without your humor my entire life b/c you have a serious gift of making me laugh til I cry. I love you for always sticking by me, even when I sucked at life.

<b>Jeano-</b> you'll always be my momma and I'll be sad to not have your firecracker personality in the house next year...visit me often and I'll definitely come to the ville. I wish you only the best after graduation, you're a talented person who deserves a great future.

<b>Matty Weber-</b> I mean seriously, must I say more? you are the best man alive (other than my brother) and I am so happy we've gotten closer this year...senior year here should rock out, although we're not talking about this time next year. I can't imagine a year without you in it buddy, we're hanging out this summer. Count on it. ""what what??""

<b>CK-</b> ummm my love, you know I <3 u...you are a great lifeguard hahaha and an awesome date to any date party. I won't have to miss you b/c I have all summer to work with you and I can't wait...prepare yourself. The wedding is still set for 6 years from now in case neither of us is snatched up by some smart people. I love you for getting me and my humor and adding to it...you rock my world.

<b>New girls-</b> my baby turtles...I am glad I had the chance to get to know each of you on the level I did b/c it made me realize what DZ meant to me as I taught you to love it too. I brag on you all nonstop and I can't wait to see how each of you change and grow in the next year...I had an unblieveable semester with you all and I can't wait to live with most of you for my final 2 semesters. 

<lj user=""dzgirl18"">- ohhh my grandlittle, Sammy Sosa...just recently we have grown to be close, and I am pretty sure it looks like a superficial or strange beginning since I should have known you and loved you since day one in the Fall, but I am glad to finally have more in common with you b/c you keep me young. we are seriously so parallel in so many ways, from the acid reflux disease, to curly hair, to boys (kinda)...so it's a shame we didn't hangout before. Whatever, we are close now, so I am happy. Thanks for being here for me the past month or so, you are an amazing girl and deserve only the best."

"event","well the last 48 hours have seemed to be a blur and not because I have been drunk (although some of those hours were filled with that), but more because I have been doing pretty much nothing monumental for once. I am glad to have a few days of no huge responsibilities, although the next couple weeks should royally kick this ass. oohhh hell.

Good news is my Mom wrote me and sent cash for the weekend but bad news was that at the end of the note she said, ""PS- your graduation is the weekend before so-and-so's wedding next year, we'll plan your party around that."" ummm, graduation?? shit. I am not old enough to be a year away nor know so many people who are already getting real jobs. what has the world come to?

Friday was seriously the most lazy I have ever been from morning until night. Sam and I have had major bonding time since we're apparently ""the same person""...and pretty much have similar things going on in a lot of aspects right now. It's also nice to keep in touch with all my baby turtles since I was their mom so long...I'd like to think they keep me young but I think I will always act like a 5 year old regardless.

Thus, this is boring since I have literally just reconnected with friends and let myself be me for a few...Kate's last night was fun but some random shitheads drank all my bacardi that I paid for...and if you know me, that is sacred juice right there. ooohhhh HELL. hopefully tonight is a good one despite the weather; I vetoed going home for Thunder b.c I've been so often and vetoed Makong b.c it would be miserable tonight...so hopefully I can get Chris his A-Mazing KS initiation gift I got him and drink asap. I loooooove UK, why do I have to leave in 2 weeks?"

"event","by the subject line you can basically guess how I already feel about today...and it is only noon. Luckily I have a good attitude so it'll turn around I'm sure, but let's run down how un-AWESOME today has already been:

-first, I find out my aunt had cancer removed yesterday, thanks for the memo family.

-second, I have an exam at 9:30am that I slept through, even though I went to bed early...but you can't expect a little girl to wake up 7 hours later after sleeping only 7 in 3 days...I have never failed so bad at one thing in my life like this...my parents are going to kill me.

-third, I decided that if I overslept through and exam I might as well go running to make myself feel good about SOMETHING in my life...and out of habit I always put the keyless entry button in my running bra and conceal my keys and purse in the trunk. It seems smart...but today I almost lost the button when my huge knockers (insert sarcasm here) made it fall out. The trail is 2 miles long and I had aleady ran 4 or so miles when I realized it was gone and had to make a million more laps until I found that it had moved to the back of my bra. I am an idiot...but an inshape one now. I thought my life was over...

Last night was stellar at Club Willy T. Young lol...that library is going to start charging me rent b/c I live there...and it isn't even finals time. Whoah, so proud of myself lately...I study like a chamo, although I have little choice. I am trying to get text messaging back on my phone and my Dad thinks I am a baller and deserve it if I bust ass at school...so yah, workin hard. I usually hate the brary, especially if I am there more than in my bed, but last night was seriously fun. I held down the 5th floor with Samantha and Big Dog Thompson until 5:30am...damn. We went to Arby's for a break (cause m yass needs THAT) and I even got put on the radio when I was taking a break outside. It was nice to be requested to call into the studio to be put on air, I really miss having that in my life. I guess all things happen for a reason...we'll see where all of this studying and missing things leads me...things are really looking up.

Gotta head to the journalism building for some lab work before the presenation (worth 60% of my grade) is on tomorrow at 2. whoah...that's the last thing over my head, so I am hype. Tomorrow night, it's going down...and breakfast with the hotties of 316 Friday morning should be the best couple days ever. yessss....Thunder Saturday?? we'll see..."

Yes, I am the master...last night I went to the brary for 4 hours or so with my group and then decided to go to the house for a break and to get out of the damn library. Then I IMed Samantha to see if she needed a break too and so we bought fountain soda, baked lays and somehow ended up at 316 Park with Mr.Tivo and Mr.Crown Royal. hahaha, they were entertaining to say the least...so I bonded with my grandlittle until 3:30am.

It is a joke from last year, but when FIJI and DZ had a grafitti mixer, he wrote on my shirt that I was the type of girl he'd like to marry....so from then on we have referred to each other as husband and wife lol. It's just random and funny. When his mother walked up at Keeneland, he said, ""Mom, this is Carolyn Petredis...my future wife."" HAHAHA. Well, I have never heard that, but it was both strange and awesome at the same time. She invited me to their tailgate and I wittily replied, ""I'll do my best to go, but if I don't make it I do have the rest of my life to tailgate with you!"" hahaha, classic. Does anyone else find this comical? ok, maybe not. I did. Thanks craig for a good story."

I went to the ville Friday night to hang with the family, go shopping, and of course, see my UL girls. It seemed like a good weekend to do so since a lot of cool people at UK went out of town and Fridays are not fun in Lexington anyways. So we went to a keg/birthday party for someone's friend and then 4th street as usual. All in all, I had a great time with the girls, and havea new respect for the people at UK. I have always bashed the UK boys as being shady and cookie-cutter in looks (yet, undeniably hot)...but maybe that's whta I love. I missed being around the guys here who literally piss themselves in excited to see me, and i definitely missed the popped collars. hahaha...boy was it an eye opener. Oh well, I won't be home to go out until summer when I am forced to move from what I love here...

Keeneland was pretty sweet, I got a TON of sun, so i had a pretty sucessful weekend I suppose. More fun to come this week as I have a 20 page paper due, an exam, a huge presentation...but Friday morning we're cooking breakfast for the hot boys of 316 Transylvania Park. mmmm good wink wink.

I love being busy, it makes me feel important, but sometimes I wonder if half the things I fill my schedule with are there because I can't let people down. I need to figure that out. 

So funny story, I went to KRoger to get some chips (because THAT is awlays good for my stomach problems) and up the isle comes Orbzuck of however you spell his name. Basically, the tall white guy from the b-ball team that plays sometimes, yeah him, stood next to me asking some translater woman what chips are good. I walked past him and saw everyone around think of how comical our height difference was. Well let's be honest, I'm no giant, so it made me laugh too. My lil brother will love to hear I saw Orb on campus though, he always does. They aren't different than me, their just taller, on a free ride with some pay, have groupies, and don't graduate...other than that...we're soooo similiar.

finally hitting the sack and wondering why I had to update, I just can't get tired. I mean, I'm worn out, but there is a difference between the two. Maybe I'll sleep when I am home the first week of summer. That's what I usually do...go straight into a slight coma to make up for a year of fatique at UK. I'll sure miss this place in 3 weeks...damn."

I was tempted to just drive home to get away from the house and being surrounded with so many reminders that <b>I lost.</b> It was just a bad day, but luckily Amanda, on her 20th birthday, took <b>ME</b> to Happy Hour and then the Fishtank for a few margaritas. <b>I am so selfish, I stole her birthday</b>, but I appreciate her helping me drink through it lol.

"event","wow what a weekend. I was in the worst mood Friday, yet I couldn't pinpoint why. I have very real gut feelings about things and can tell when something is going wrong before it does...I guess it's a girl thing, Although, to my suprise, things have turned out for the better since. Ironically, I told the DJ in my interview that I have always gotten what I wanted somehow, although maybe not how I saw it, but I somehow always end up happier with the path I get. I really hope I win the apprentice, not only because I've worked hard for it, but because I want to see where it can take me. I have already learned so much and would hate to leave the people who have been a huge part of the last couple months of my life. Either way, everything will workout. It always does somehow.

Yesterday may go down as the best day ever...I didn't go out Friday b/c I knew what Saturday would be like, and that was a good idea. Keeneland was fabulous. I love seeing men in ties, nice pants, coordinated shirts. Classy dames, as you all know, is my thing. I love the Southern idea of chivalry, and it's funny how much nicer these fratastic men are when they are dressed nicely. I guess that's the idea behind uniforms in schools, it just makes them act on their best behavior. Everyone was gorgeous and classy damed out, not to mention shitcanned. Loved it, I can't wait for another weekend there. Tailgate hosted by the one and only Room 301, be there or be a loser ya'll.

Well pretty darn cool I guess, considering how well the DJ with me said I did. I thought I sucked at times, but I think that's how it is supposed to go. Who starts out as a prodigy?? I am funny on the phone, good with improv and just being myself...I forgot that I was on air most of the time...I felt like I was hanging out with a cool person, listening to music in a small room, and randomly talking to people. It was such a rush, I must have that in my life. I really think that, win or lose, I am going to pursue where this could take me. I love it, incase you missed that part. I'm just proud of myself for getting this far in the competition and learning so much...it's nice to finally hear positive reinforcement from people. lord.

Well earlier in the day, I had a pretty packed day, no time for huge napping (like I EVER get to anyways)...Sigma Spike was pretty fun. I won't lie, the mud may never be completely off of me...thanks to the firemen hosing the fields every 3- min. for MORE mud. I thought I might drown. Good thing I was sober lol. I am really starting to finally see what DZ has done for me and how awesome those people are, it's just sad it took me this long. I love seeing the new girls get into things and see how the campus reacts. Go DZ, I am soooo not a sorority girl, but I will consider myself one at mud volleyball HAHA. Did we win??

Anyways, my brother left for the lake this week-weekend, so I guess I am gonna have to go a whole 5 days without tlking to him. I seriously need his humor...and miss it. Shit, come back kid.

Granted, I have a ton in Lexy, but there's something new and exciting about the people here. It's nice having to introduce myself, have someone find out about me through getting to know me (instead of knowing me through UK campus ish) and to just have a freshman approach to things in a way. mmm, I'm coming home as much as possible and I don't care what the hell it looks like.

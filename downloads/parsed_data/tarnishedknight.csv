"event","this will probably sound silly, but you ever wonder why we bother going on if theres no afterlife, or why we go on if there is an afterlife, or hell why do i bother... sometimes i just wish it would all just go away. i looked into voice acting alittle harder and guess what? nobodys going to give me the time of day if im not in california and have an agent gah well whatever i need to go to bed i get to start packing tmw for the new life im feeling overwhelmingly anxious about... weather going to texas is better for me or not leaving my friends behind is starting to feel like slowly striping the flesh from my bones."

"event","Its Mothers day.

its been almost 7 months since my mother was killed.

she was my guide in this world.

since her passing ive not been the same.

when i need advice i feel hollow and alone because the one person who has ever loved me unconditionally is gone from this world robbed from me and all the people who loved her dearly by a person who was too busy paying attention to the radio to stay in the proper traffic lane.

seven months and still i feel like there is a void in my life ... seven months ... before she passed i put her email off for a week because i wasnt in the mood to respond ...

heaven has to exist, for her, or my world my colapse around me at any time.

I just want to go home... but that died with my mother.

I cant help but be haunted by the fact that if i hadnt moved to az i would have been in that car.

I cant sleep right now because the nightmares will come again.

I wish i had told her i loved her more often remember people its something that u can never say too much.

There is no justice left in this world.

she was always trying to help me meet the right girl, and now when i do meet the right girl who isnt taken, she ll never get to meet her.

i must have been a wonderful person in a former life to have her as my mother.

I hope, that she is at peace, and maybe someday i can be too.

I love u Mom be at peace.

"event","-im eating myself up inside
-im tired of being alone, tired of coming home every day and doing the same stupid crap alone tired of not being able to change my situation in life, and staggeringly hurt to find that i am Dante from Clerks. after watching it again i am far to much like that.
-im sick of feeling for someone who i can never have in my life, and wish the torturous attraction would just go away so i can move on to not telling someone else how i feel about them due to my overwhelming fears of rejection and inadiquasies of self.
-im unhappy feeling alone in a house with 3 other ppl who while seeming distant are somehow always around.

on a bright note some tests i saw on a friends lj

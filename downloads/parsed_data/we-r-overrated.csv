"event","I feel like I snapped my fingers and my weekend disappeared.<br />It was super crappy.<br />So maybe it's a good thing that it feels like it went by so fast.<br />Friday I had class from 9:30-2:30, and believe me, my brain felt like it was going to just explode afterwards. This whole week has been jammed back, it's getting down to crunch-time in a couple of my classes. Major assignments and tests are coming up. October effin' sucks.<br />So then at 2:30 I raced outside, having to pee so bad (too much info?) but inevitably ended up missing my bus, because it was Friday the 13th. I called Arleen, who sounded grumpy, and told her I'd be late for work. I was scheduled for 3:oopm...what fackin bullshat! I can't believe that. I generally don't work Friday's because I get off class at 2:30 and then I'm expected to work 3-7? No thanks. Too long of a day for me. So I got there by like 10 after 3 or something like that and I felt like shit. I'm telling you, I'm developing an ulcer. Even Tristan thinks so! And hes <em>smart</em> so it has to be true! Anyway, in pain, I got to work. Only to have my day get so much worse.&nbsp;<br />There was so much clothes to bag that day that I was doing it until 6:30 - half an hour before we close! I was hungry and bitchy and tired, and customers were being assholes and I just wanted to go home.<br />But Ron came in to see me during my shift, which was so nice because he had gotten back at like noon on Friday and I was so happy to see him. Then for some reason Tim came in for all of 2 minutes and then left. And then Ammie came in after a while, which is CARAZY cuz I haven't seen her in forever. It was nice, visitors made me feel a bit better.<br />So anyway I got most of my shit done, I didn't bother cleaning ANYTHING, just made a float, counted everything and left. My dad picked me up because he rocks, and I went back to my place to change, pick up my late top and ghetto tape player (because I had recorded the interview with Tristan on Power97 on it) and got driven to Rons while I stuffed my face in the car with spicy Thai food. Tristan, Jayme, Ted, Derek and Dereks girlfriend came over to Rons and we all kind of just sat around. I went home at like 1:30 and passed out.<br />I got up at about 10:oo and slowly got ready for work. The package came from my Grama's Tuscany/Rome/Italy/Etc. trip! I was so excited....I got earings and a bracelet and the best of all: a beautiful purse (black) with pink handwriting on it saying Ciao Bella, and its sparkly. Totally sweet purse and it holds so much I'm so happy. Its by far my favorite purse. I LOVE purses.<br />So I went to work and my day sucked just as bad as Fridays. I had so many customers bringing in BAGS of clothes...not even kidding, like GARBAGE BAGS full of clothes to be drycleaned. I just about killed myself, no kidding. Not to mention customer after customer came in for lottery and it took me forever to get anything done. Eventually it was time to close and I got hella outta there as fast I could, I tell you. Ron was supposed to pick me up but he had to go to his parents place first so I got some coffee and took the bus back home where I rushed to eat a grilled cheese and get changed, sat for 2 minutes (seriously) and Ron came and picked me up. We made it to two stores before he had to take me home because he had to go be with his little brother because his parents were taking&nbsp;his grama to the hospital. He dropped me off and I went and passed out. He called me at some point, I don't even know what time, and we talked for a bit. His grama is okay, thank god. :)<br />I went back to bed and slept until about 10ish today (Sunday). All day I did notes, studying, and homework and played with my pup. It was pretty lowkey. Now here I am talking on the phone and msn and updating my journal. I am such a multitasker. Boo-ya.<br />Tomorrow I have school all day and then some cleaning shall commence, if I actually have time. Then Tuesday I'm taking Hillary out to the Daily Grind before I go to work for a birthday coffee. Happy birthday to Hillary! (on the 13th).<br />so now im off to bed after making yet another long and pointless update. Woo."

"event","What a nice long weekend! Thankgiving was good, despite the fact that I don't eat meat anymore besides chicken...so I didn't eat any turkey, and my dad went and put bacon into my favorite dish - stuffing! So I spent forever picking all the bacon off my plate haha. Otherwise it was good. Sadie wolfed down her little turkey dinner we made her. She more or less inhaled it. She didn't puke after, which is surprising.
I got alot of notes and studying done, and even went out for a bit with Gerard yesturday. It was fun, we haven't really hung out a whole lot since we graduated.
Other than that I've been watching Lord of the Rings all weekend because I bought the box set.&nbsp;
in between notes, taking Sadie for a walk, and watching the Two Towers last night, I spent a bit of time on the phone with Ron. He's called me almost every night this week, which is so nice because I like hearing from him while he's out of town &lt;3. He probably won't be back until Thursday or Friday...so I'm sad. :(

Tristan is going to be on Power 97 @ 7pm this Thursday (Oct. 12) so everyone tune in damnit! He got interviewed (Ron was supposed to too, but he's out of town) and it's going to feature the music and everything. I'm really excited &amp; I'm going to record it for Ron.

Well that's it. Back to work today, but hopefully dead because they didn't do much drycleaning because of some boiler inspection. I hope it blows up in Dale's face.
Wow. I'm burning in hell."

Its the University's fault I swear.<br />And my job.<br />And trying to have a social life.<br /><br />I'm hardly on msn anymore, and when I am I'm normally ""away"" cuz I'm not <em>actually </em>there. It's a good thing I'm a loser and my only friends call my cell when they want to talk. Heh.<br /><br />Well anyway. I actually have a few minutes to spare, so I figured I'd do a bit of an update. Unfortunately, there isn't much to update at all!<br />Rons birthday ROCKED! The pictures I took are totally killer, although, I was pretty trashed that night and really dont remember taking some of them. But thats okay. It was so much fun.&nbsp;<br /><br />School has been carazy of course. I went from 5 to 3 classes ( I suck with stress ) but I'm taking two over the Spring/Summer term so it evens out. My classes I'm taking are amazing. I never thought I'd be able to say that about class. But really, I actually <em>want</em>&nbsp; to do homework! Wow...I'm such a nerd.<br /><br />My job is blegh. I like working there in a general sort of way, because of the hours and it's just so slack...and anymore stress right now and my hair would fall out or turn grey just like Kaits (although I am getting there). Dale (my boss) is just such a nob sometimes, and so is Arlene and Katie. I generally get along with Katie really well though, so I can't complain.<br /><br />besides that, the belly button ring is no more. Woke up one morning and had to take it out due to the green puss and the entire redness and itchiness of my stomach. Once it heals I think I might go get it re done...with a ring this time. Heh.<br /><br />Well, see, that was it for my update. My life is thoroughly uninteresting.&nbsp;<br /><br /><em>Happy Thanksgiving!</em>"

Tuesday we didn't go to Pizza Hut for my birthday. They took me out for wings at Smitty's and then for Gelati's. We went back to Tristan and Jayme's house, and just chilled for a little bit. It was a really nice low-key birthday...and I was just so happy that Ron was able to come home for it.&nbsp;

Wednesday Ron and I went to Tristan and Jayme's again and just watched lots of Duckman ep's with T&amp;J and Jonny. Jonny was supposed to go to BP but got totally held up by Duckman and didn't go. Muahaha.

The rest of the week was low-key and relaxing...until Saturday that is.
I got up at about 6:30 ish on Saturday and went to work until 1pm. I was going to nap because I knew we were going to drink that night, somewhere, but Tim msg'ed me and asked me to go with him to get his eyebrow pierced. I went with him to get his lip done ages ago, so I figured, why break tradition? And I went. Seeing as how grungy Sorensins is now closed, we went to this place on Provencher, Babylon something or something Babylon (if anyone remembers the name, please lemme know lol) which is such a sweet place, I want to take Ron. It's all done up Egyptian style and is SOOOOOOOO hott. They had tons of books full of tattoos and piercings done there. It was wicked. Anyway, we waiting for a gazzillion hours (probably half an hour) and the girl who was going to pierce Tims eyebrow came up to us. Tims cousin and I were all but gawking. Her ears were stretched out so wide I could have put my whole fist through it, and she had a tattoo of an actual heart (the anatomy type heart, not the &lt;3) over her heart...and get this..her cheeks were pierced so they looked like dimples! As nice as she was she was a little intimedating. Anyway, he got his eyebrow pierced, it looks cool. I'd get it done if a) everybody and their god damn dog didn't have it done and b) if I wasn't going to have to take it out for teaching. hahaha.
So I go home and then I call up Ron, who was busy, and called up Jayme, who then informed me that they were having a birthday bbq for me! How sweet! No one has ever done that for me...it was sooooo nice. I was so excited. So Ron came and picked me up an hour or 2 later, and we got 1.75 L of Captain Morgans Spiced Rum (OMG YUM) tons of Coke Zero, munchies and stuff. 
Jayme made delicious wings and wonderful burgers and the whole bbq was just super. We started drinking shortly after. I think by 2am the entire bottle of Rum was gone and we cracked open Jonny's. Ron and I were pretty trashed. As was Jayme and Tristan and Jonny. It was awesome. We all sat outside for the longest time, just chillin and talking. And at random points a couple of us would come inside for a bit to warm up, then back out we went.
The boys went to Macs at god knows what time in the morning and bought cigars and everyone but me was smoking. Ya, thats right bitches, I can say no to peer pressure. Its cool not to smoke!
I was up for almost 24 hours by the time we went to sleep. I must have fallen asleep at around 5am or something. I didnt even hear Jonny get up to leave for work like an hour later. Ron and I woke up at about 10 am and we snuck out of the house and bought everyone McDonalds. We got in the drivethrough and I was going to pay and everything...open up my wallet....and low and behold I lost my god damn debit card. I'm pretty sure I left it at the bank lol. Dumb ASSSSSS.
So Ron paid for thirty dollars worth of McDicks LMAO and we went back and woke everyone up. We all went and sat on the couches ron and I pushed together so we could sleep together on a makeshift bed, and all just sat around eating mcdicks. Such a sweet way to wake up. 
So we sat around watching the really funny South Park episodes and then the Tenacious D DVD. We eventually went to Dairy Queen and got DQ Blizzards, mmmmm. I then went home and showered. I tried to take a nap, seeing as how I got like no sleep. But there were so many damn kids in the house. My uncle Glen had come over for a BBQ&nbsp;with his three kids,&nbsp;who are so nuts. &nbsp;I was so tired, I could hardly lift the burger to my mouth. I got a second wind tho, and we were gonna go out but everyone ditched out on me. Kind of sucked, but I read.&nbsp;

I did not much of anything during the day today, slept until almost noon. But tonight Ron and I went together to see Nacho Libre. It was okay, if Jack Black wasn't in it, it wouldn't of been half as good. But I like Jack Black alot so it was good.&nbsp;
Oh and....

RON BOUGHT A HOUSE!!! His possession date is the 15th. Congrats to him!!! &lt;3 &lt;3

I'm so excited for him. Its so impressive and mature of him, and just goes to show what a responsible level-headed man he is. I'm so happy for him. The house is on Ferry, and its this cute little place with a nice garage. I can't wait until he moves in.&nbsp;

Anyway, so its been a great birthday coupla-weeks. :) I'm pretty happy my 19th turned out so nice.

School starts on Wednesday. Tomorrow I'm going to go get a new Debit card, and I work at 2:30. Nice short shift. in fact starting this month almost all Katie's and my shifts are going to be at 2:30. Which sucks cuz it cuts down on hours, which means less money. And I'm deffinately not Ms. MoneyBags right now. W/e.

I'm so anxious for school to start. I hope I do good. I'm kind of nervous too though...I think I'm mostly nervous about finding my damn classroom. They're all over the place!
I gotta call Kaitlynn tomorrow to tell her to put a lock on our locker, and for us to meet up before Classical Mythology on Wednesday.

Yay for September, this month is looking to be really wonderful!

Last night my parents made me Eggs Benedict as my birthday dinner (seeing as how I'm going out tonight....hopefully) and bought me a cake, which is sooo yummy. I also got my birthday present last night from them. It's a really beautiful gothic bed. It's so sweet. Its got three sides that are blocked off by frame, and its this beautiful black craziness. I'm not doing to good at explaining it, but it's sooo awesome. And I got a black duvet cover, two new feather pillows with red cases, a black pillow case and really nice red sheets. They are so hott!&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm so happy that I'm not just sleeping on a matress on the floor :) All that's left to get is a desk and a closet organizer...which I'm getting next payday.&nbsp;

Since it's my birthday today, I gotta go pay for my licence. I really don't want to...but oh well. Gotta do it.&nbsp;

Ron was supposed to come home last night, and said he'd call when he got in. But he didn't call, so I'm kind of worried. I mean he probably just got in really late or just forgot to call, but I hope he got in okay. I hope he didnt get held up or ended up getting a weird accident or something.
Im sure its fine.

Tonight we're supposed to go to Pizza Hut for my birthday. But I had a dream I got completely ditched by everyone and went by myself and people were laughing at me cuz I'm such a loser. lol.

Well thats it for my birthday update...."

"event","<p>Well I got paid alot more than I thought I was, then with the 100 dollars my grandparents gave me I was kind of rolling in the cash! On Friday I went and met up with Hillary and we went and cashed my cheques, got coffee (mmm Daily Grind), exchanged my Gilmore Girls DVD for a Tool and APC cd (see a theme?) and then walked to walmart. It took me a couple of hours but I got a couple really nice outfits for back to school, and only 1 thing had skulls on it! I'm so proud of myself. After exhausting ourselves (or myself) by trying on a million different things we went to subway, and then caught the bus to go home. My clothes are really nice, they're pretty girly, but I wanted to have a bit more variety than just my band clothes. </p>
<p>Soooo Ron is coming home Tuesday at around supper time, then we're getting together to go to Pizza Hut (I think) with a couple of friends to celebrate my b-day. I think Ron and I might do something on the weekend or whatev. I'm just glad he's coming home! What a nice birthday present. You know what else is a nice birthday present? That fact that I have today, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday off. Yayness. </p>

He'll be home!<br />So for all those who were gonna come with me to Foody Goody on Tuesday, I *think* plans have changed. I think we're all meeting up at BP or Pizza Hut unless I just spend the night hanging out with Ron, like the original original plan was &lt;3.<br />Anyway, so happy that he's gonna be home soon!<br /><br />Other than that, I went out last night with Hillary, Gerard and Kaitlynn and we all hung out for a bit, then Kaitlynn came back here (my place) where we looked at our booklists for school and Kaitlynn vented a bit. Her night progressively got worse. Luckily I was there to crack jokes. Not that it helped her, but it helped <strong>me. </strong>hahaha.<br /><br />Payday tomorrow ! Woo! Its my day off, but I'm going to go in and get my paycheck and go to walmart and maybe do a bit of shopping. mmm walmart. I also have to take back season 1 of Gilmore Girls to Entertainment Exchange because it's really scratched :: le sigh :: I watched as many ep's as I could, the ones that worked anyway. Maybe I'll get the second season, muahhaha. I beat the system (except, not really).<br /><br />Oh, ok and how about now I <strong>have </strong>to buy an MP3 player as my fackin discman stopped working today. Just, stopped. Well I dont HAVE to by an MP3 player, but why waste the money on yet <strong>another </strong>discman when I can doubly spend money and get an MP3 player that will fit more music and help me refrain from carrying around an abundance of CDs all the time. </p>

<p><strong><u>Life Of Pi<br /></u><br /></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm gonna give this book 4 stars outta 5. Only because it was slow at the beginning and I had no idea where it was going (element of surprise I guess) and I was pretty skeptical about reading it. I really enjoyed it though...the writing was very easy and flowed really well. Anyone who wants something new and refreshing that involved religion and animals, I suggest checking this book out. <br /></p>"

"event","It's been a pretty good day off I'd have to say. Nice weather, nice sleep-in (despite the two weird nightmares I woke up from in the middle of the night - one involving a Stephen King type Regulator storyline on my street with crazy neighbours, and the second having to do with middle school, Terry Fox Run and a broken bridge. Oh yes, and Alysia Taylor. The dream made me resolve to call her this week) and a nice afternoon hanging out with Ron.&nbsp; Who is leaving tomorrow :( We spent a bit of the afternoon together because he got off work earlish, and after supper tonight we are going to hang out possibly with Tristan, Jayme and Jonny depending on what everyone is doing. <br />Rons only going out of town for a bout a week or 2 so thats nice, he wont be gone forever :)<br /><br />the 29th is my birthday, I'm somewhat not caring about that fact. I think its just because every year since I was 16 I've spent my birthday with Ron, so its like my birthday is being postponed. The 29th is just an excuse to go get huge at Foody Goody cuz that is what I am doing. Who wants to come? I think Kaitlynn and Gerard, hillary and Tristan, Jayme, Jonny and possibly Ted are coming...if anyone else wants to come just drop me a line on msn or if you have my cell number call me. The more the merrier!&nbsp;<br /><br />So I'm almost done <strong>Life Of Pi </strong>it's really crazy. I'm gonna put a quick review up here on my LJ when I actually finish it. I think if you like abstract stories you'd like this book. It's a bout this 16 year old boy who gets shiprecked on the Pacific Ocean with a Tiger in a lifeboat. Really great book!<br /><br />Other than all that there isn't much else to report. I'm actually talked to Derrick Donovan right now on MSN for the first time since before Grad...since before he left to join the Army I guess. I'm asking him about him and Samarra, because lets face it, I'm a curious cat and I haven't spoken to her since she left for Egypt. He says they broke up when he was in Basics and that she got all bitchy. I havent heard from her, so I guess I got lumped in there with the group of people she doesnt want to talk to ever again I guess. I mean I did introduce her and Derrick, probably awkward. I'd just like to know how her and her mom are doing. I'm a terribly compassionate person :: rolls eyes :: .<br /><br />Well..that's about it. I think I'll be updating more for the next little while seeing as how I wont have as much stuff going on. I dont work as much and lets face it, Ron is 99% the reason why I'm always busy hahaha. I'm gonna miss him.<br /><br />xoxo.<br />"

"event","It's been a couple weeks since I've last posted. I've been really busy and everytime I go to sit down to post whatever it is I normally write in here, something comes up.&nbsp;
My last post was about the concert. Mmmm the concert. What a good concert. I worked all that week (8th-12th) with Sunday off. Most of it was spent hanging out with Ron and also Tristan and Jayme and them. It was a nice week, and the paycheck is gonna be killer because I only had two days off this past week. 
This week SUCKED. So bad. Too much stress, too much working, too much work-related stress, too much everything. I hung out with Kaitlynn on Tuesday, and went and saw The Omen, which I'm warning you, do not go and see, with Ron on Wednesday. Thursday I relaxed and then Ron showed me the new Lamb Of God CD....wowowowowow. Soooo crazyyyyyy. Soooo good.
Then Friday I went to Tristan and Jayme's with Ron and we crashed there. Ron and I woke up at 10 and he went to get the on-call phone from a guy from work for Saturday, and then we got McDicks for breakfast and I went home, changed, and went to work until 6. OMG did I ever not want to be at work. I was so tired and everyone was so dumb that came in. After work I came home, ate, watched Gilmore Girls and Valentine and went to bed.&nbsp;

Today I laid outside before it got all cloudy, with my headphones on, and then I went to read Life Of Pi, but got restless and now here I am, writing this pointless entry.

Ron leaves on Tuesday for a work trip...again. :( Im pretty bummed out and I feel selfish because its his WORK and its not his fault hes gotta go and ya know, miss my birthday. I'm gonna have tons of birthdays and we're gonna do something special when he gets back...but it still sucks. I just hate it period when he goes away, and now hes gotta go away for my birthday. Im a terribly selfish person.&nbsp;

Other than that. School starts up soon, I'm pumped!! Hopefully I get into my Euro Art History class like expected. But all my other classes are set. Gonna get my books with kaitlynn on Wednesday. YAY.

Well now I'm bored with this, and restless with reading. I think I'll watch some Buffy."

"event","What a fucking weekend, holy gawd. I'll pick up where I left off in my last post...<br />I got together to go to Tristans with Ron at about 8:30 or 8:45ish, and we went to the liquor store where I got Captain Morgans Spiced Rum, and Ron got some coolers of some sort and some malibu rum. Tristan and Jonny met us there, I don't remember what they got. I think some more rum and some vodka. Anyway so from there we go to Shoppers by Walmart where we get some coke and some chips and stuff for the evening. Tristan and Jonny were driving in front of us on Portage and all of a sudden there was this horrible clunking noise and then like something smacking cement over and over. Ron turned down the music and I was like ""Ron! Thats your truck!"" we pulled over to find that the muffler of his dad's truck had fallen off. Eep. And there goes Tristan and Jonny not even realizing that we had stopped, ha. Good thing we didn't completely break down or anything. So Ron, even though he looked all nice and clean and had a nice shirt on, with not even a second thought, got under the truck and tied the muffler back up with alot of rope and then we went to Tristan and Jonny's haha. We started drinking right away while the boys played video games and some new songs they recorded. I found that since I was drunk on Friday it took more liquor to get me drunk on Saturday...but I was still pretty drunk by the end of the night. Ron chugged back his girly drinks pretty fast and was soon quite drunk.&nbsp;<br />Jonny lent me a book that he thought I would like, so I'm going to lend him Angels And Demons, the prequel to The Da Vinci Code. I also found out that Jonny is quite the Ewan Mcgregor fan!<br />We ordered pizza and played a drinking game (Fuck You) upstairs, it was pretty fun. Afterwards we hooked up the nintendo...like, the really old school nintendo, and they played duck hunt. Ron eventually passed out on the small couch. Once Jonny and Tristan were done playing duck hunt I suggested we watch a movie....Jonny and I opted for Moulin Rouge, soon losing Tristan. Jonny and I sat Moulin Rouge and recited along with the movie, as well as some drunk singing haha. At one point Ron woke up, where we proceeded to switch couches cuz Jonny and I were sitting on the big couch, when poor Ron was passed out on a couch smaller than me. He watched about thirty seconds of Moulin Rouge, the part where the Duke and Zidler are dancing around singing Madonna's ""Like A Virgin""; said ""what the fuck? this is messed up."" and passed out again hahaha. Jonny and I stayed up until about 5am, then he went to his bedroom and conked out and I passed out on the couch. I woke up 3 and a half hours later and couldn't get back to sleep.<br />Tristan took Jayme to work at 9:30 and then Ron and Jonny woke up at around 10. We tried to clean up the best we could, then had to take off because we wanted to be at the concert for noon.<br />I had about an hour to get ready after Ron dropped me off at my place from Tristan and Jonny's, and all I wanted to do was sleep haha. I showered, put up my hair, wore my As I Lay Dying shirt and burnt the Cannibal Corpse discography for Ron and was on our way when.....<br /><br />I tripped off the fucking back stoop of our door, whipped out completely and ripped a huge hole in my pants. AWESOME start to my day I say. (note the sarcasm). Anyway, it hurt, but I was laughing almost as hard as Ron was and we left.&nbsp;<br /><br />We got there so frickin early but guess what? We were first in fucking line and met Matt Heafy (Sp?) of Trivium!!!! Came and shook our hands and everything. We spent about an hour and a half talking to some younger kids (17 ish) behind us who also met Matt with us, and then Tristan showed up, followed by Linsey. When the security guard said we could go threw, I was suddenly worried I would be trampled......everyone was RUNNING up the escalators and stairs to get to where we get patted down and our tickets ripped. then everyone was RUNNING to the gate put up in front of the stairs that lead to the actual concert area itself. We were, again, first in line. When the gate was lifted we flew up the frickin escalator and about 200...300...metalheads were barrelling into the floor by the stage. I actually saw people jump out of the way and some people stood by with dumbfounded looks saying ""holy shit"". It was nuts. However, because we were first, we were right in the fucking middle right at the front, it was so fucking sweet. Ron and Tristan held our spots while I ran to the bathroom and took a quick look at some Tee's. The lines were too long though so we got a bunch of water (9 bucks for three fucking glasses!) and went back to our spots. Linsey and I held out spots while Tristan and Ron went for a quick walk to take a look at stuff. They came back around the time of the first band to start, who sucked big time. Actually the whole first half sucked. Thats okay, we had <em><u>sweet </u></em>spots for Trivium, As I Lay Dying, and IN FLAMES!!! OMG.&nbsp; Ron eventually went to get a tee so I gave him some cash and he got me one too. We both got really cool Trivium t-shirts. When he came back he told me there was a band signing for Trivium in half an hour, and I so wanted to go. So Tristan, Ron and I went while Linsey held our spots (the best she could). So we met Matt again hahaha as well as the rest of the band. They signed our tickets. I was grinning like a complete moron, it was really embarrassing, but I didn't know what to say, I just kept saying thank you thank you and grinning like an idiot. So much for being cool. lol.<br /><br />Afterwards we went back up to the front and Gwar came on. Gwar...I fucking hate Gwar. They were way to much for me to handle, they like pushed me mentally over the edge. I know I must sound like such a baby but I don't really like how the cut open ""the nazi pope"" and there were mutilated pretend babies everywhere. Not to mention I got my nose and mouth smashed into the top of the gate and couldn't tell if it was my blood or the stupid fucking shit that Gwar kept spraying out into the crowd. I got SOAKED. I was dripping with fake blood and crying cuz my face hurt so bad. The security guards wanted to pull me out but I wasn't loosing my spot for my three favorite bands, fuck that. So I put my extra t-shirt over my hand and concentrated on not having a full blown panic attack. It really freaked me out that the pressure got so bad that the fucking gate SLID FORWARD on the fake-blood-drenched flloor, at least a whole foot. Considering I was pressed up against the gate that kind of really freaked me out, and it freaked out the security guards too. Once they were done, thank god! I turned to Ron, and said ""I hate gwar"" and then started crying again. I'm such a loser. But fucking Gwar made me chip the back of my tooth and Im not covered under a plan right now, so I was pretty pissed. Not to mention I was drenched in fake blood. and...green goo...i dunno what the hell it was but I hate that band and I will never see them again. I should make them pay my dental, those fuckers.<br /><br />By the time Cannibal Corpse came on, even with Ron in back of me holding onto the bars I was getting squished. I managed to take a look at my belly button and it was so swollen the top of my bar bell was disappearing into my skin. Ron kept so much pressure of me it was amazing. What a sweetie &lt;3<br />Anyway, Trivium came on and they were so good, wow, so glad I saw them live. Only thing was, was they played a Metallica cover which I so wasn't cool with because their set was so short, they should have played one of their songs, and their brand new song sounded EXACTLY like Metallica. Uh-oh looks like this might be the end of coolness for Trivium. Oh well, they were pretty saweet.&nbsp;<br /><br />In Flames came on and I was soooo pumped up and started head banging right away and pumpin up the \m/!! but the pressure was so bad I couldn't keep my chest off the gate and I couldnt keep my stomach off it either. It was so good though, I love In Flames. Ron stayed up for most of it but started feeling sick so he went and got some water and watched the show from the back for a bit.&nbsp;<br /><br />As I Lay Dying opened with my favorite song! Confined!! And Ron had managed to come back up to me for the As I Lay Dying set. After a few songs he took off to go mosh and I eventually thought I was going to pass out cuz I had been at the front for 6 hours and hadnt drank anything since the beginning of the concert. I took off from the front and went to the bathroom, meeting up with Linsey on the way. I looked like shit when I went in. Covered in blood (fake) and green stuff and it was all over my face and it was nasty. I washed off the best i could then we went back inside, where Linsey crowd surfed.&nbsp;<br /><br />Afterwards we parted ways, me meeting up with Ron and Hummer and we went to perkins for food. We walked in and got a few stares considering we were all drenched in grossness and really crazed-lookin. Good food though. Ron and I had breakfast (him an omlet and I had eggs benedict) and we got onion rings to go with. Hummer got a sandwitch.&nbsp;<br /><br />All in all it was a super good night, came home, showered, and passed out. :)<br />"

"event","<strong>Thursday : </strong>I went and paid my student fees down at the U of W with Kaitlynn and we got a locker together down in the basement, ooooo spoooooky. Then we went shopping (ish). Kaitlynn tried on some really pretty shirts that she wants to buy and I bought a new backpack for school and an As I Lay Dying tee in honor of the concert...WHICH IS TOMORROW, HOLY FUCK!!!! lol. Kait and I took the 24 back down to our end and I didn't even make it home. Ron and I hung out as soon as I made it to seven 11 (by his place) and we did a little bit of running around and then helped Tristan and Jayme move the rest of their stuff into Jonny's house. Afterwards wings were in call, but it ended up being like *the* worst wing experience at Smitty's I've ever had. We ended up getting there right at the rush so as usual we get our name taken down and we were supposed to be next in line...but the stupid effin' manager wasn't watching the door and people were going in, CUTTING us (yes, how grade three is that of me to say) and we ended waiting almost half an hour. Finally we got in and ordered a whole buncha wings.&nbsp;<br />Tristan and Jayme gave me their old TV from their bedroom which is like the same size as the one in my parents bedroom. The only thing is is its old and doesn't have a DVD player jack...but Rons a smarty pants, hopefully he can help me fix it up &lt;3.&nbsp; Anyway, they wouldn't let me pay for the TV so I paid for everyone's wings that night.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Friday: </strong>I didn't work friday...I don't even know *what* I did. I guess I just relaxed all day, then Ron and I went and got a bite to eat ( I, alas, had seven 11 chicken, yikes) then we went and did a whole bunch of rushing around before we went on the boat. Kait, me and Ron were the only ones that went and Kaitlynn got sooooooo hammered. As did I, but she was quite a bit more drunk than I was. My 4 drinks was her 14.&nbsp; Kaitlynn with the super liver. Anyway, boat cruise was so dead because apparently the boat manager was complaining saying that he wants people to pay for the boat and such and so instead of making another 10 000 in one night just in booze, he probly made 1000 because Freq wasn't aloud to give out anymore than like half of what they regularly give out. Still good though.&nbsp;<br />Course we went on the McDicks run afterwards which probably added to my hang over this morning.&nbsp;<br /><br />I worked 12:30-6pm today and now I'm watching Carrie and waiting to go drink at Tristans with Ron and the gang. Everyone seems to be running a liiiiiiiittttllleee late though apparently as Tristan was supposed to call Ron an hour ago.&nbsp;<br /><br />CONCERT TOMORROW!!!! OMFG. OMFG.<br />"

"event","YESSS! My two days off turned into three! I've never had three days off in a row while working at Jon's. I have today (wednesday) Thursday, and Friday off. I think boat cruise might be in call on Friday, cuz I dont work until 12:30 on Saturday, so I can get good and drunk and half-assed sleep in on Saturday. I'm pretty happy about these three days off, I'm still in my PJ's (although I showered already today, just got back into fresh pajama's) and I plan on just doing absolutely NADDA all day until tonight. Tonight I do believe we are going to go out for wings downtown, but if not I think I'm hanging out with Ron and the gang anyway. I don't really know what is going on as for plans, but thats okay, today is my day off! EEeee.&nbsp;<br />I was gonna go to the bank and then downtown to pay my student fees and THEN to walmart to pick up some odds and ends, but I woke up today and said puk it.&nbsp;<br /><br />I worked until 7pm last night and when I got off work, I went home and found my Aunt Yvonne (not really my aunt, just my moms best, BEST friend), in the kitchen. She came over to talk to my mom about some personal (relationship-related) problems that her and my 'uncle' are going through. I didn't particularly know about it, just heard snippets from phone convo's and what my parents have discussed. But when my mom and Auntie went outside, my dad told me the scoop. It really hurt my heart. My Auntie and Uncle have been in my life since before I was born and it was always my mom and my dad and Sam's mom and her dad. I didn't think this would ever happen, no matter how much they are alcoholics, no matter what kind of problems they have or had. It was just a peachy end to my night.&nbsp;<br />Ron called me when he got home, which wasn't until probably about 9, which sucked for him because he was out in Portage La Prairie at a job site yesturday and the day before. I hope he doesn't end up having to work overtime again tonight. Anyway, I told him a bit about what was going on with my 'aunt' and 'uncle' because it really put me in a shitty mood and got me thinking about so much stuff. It's so nice that no matter what Ron is always there for me.&nbsp;<br />I went to bed early after reading a bit (Stephen King's ""Wasteland"" which is from&nbsp;the Dark Tower chronicles, book number three) and conked out right away. Woke up early though.&nbsp;<br /><br />Other than that, not much else to report. ....<br /><br /><br /><u><strong>4 DAYS BITCHES!</strong></u>"

"event","<p>Oh wow...the Sounds Of The Underground concert is coming up in less then a week, and school is coming up in a month. Omg. But to start from the beginning, or end, of my last post. </p>
<p>I didn't go on the boat cruise last friday, I worked first thing in the morning as well as other reasons prevailing, I just didn't feel like going. So I stayed in, watched a movie, and went to bed. On Saturday I hung out with Ron, we did shopping, then went to Foody Goody.&nbsp; Oh GOD I love Foody Goody. I want to go this weekend, haha. This week that just past was spent hanging out, wooooorking, and doing lots of little odds and ends like registering for school, shopping, and oh um getting my belly button pierced, heh.&nbsp;<br />I registered for school, got into Classical Mythology, Ancient Greece and Rome, Stylistics and Diasporic Lit In Canada (WTF is Diasporic?????????), I'm also on the waiting list for European Art history, hopefully I'll get in that class.&nbsp; So that was less painful then I thought it would be cuz I wanted like 3 out of those classes, so, woo to me. It was obviously less stressful then Kaits registration; I couldn't tell whether she would throw up or cry first, luckily it resulted in neither. I think the chinese food and university bashing afterwards helped. :P<br /><br />Took Ron, (well he drove) and Ted to Tavern United downtown. AAhhhh Ron loved it. I was so excited. He loved the patio on the roof and the wings which were killer good. the whole place was wicked. Its totally the new wing spot.&nbsp;<br /><br />This weekend was pretty fun..well, almost uneventful, but still fun. Friday night I went and I got my belly button pierced then Ron, me, kait and linsey went to play pool at Classics (I loooove that place) and then Ron and I went for a drive. I got home...late, 1:30 or 1:45 or something, and woke up at 6 to go to work. OUCH. I worked 10 hours, OMG it hurt. lol. But Ron who is the biggest sweetie ever, showed up at about 11:30 with the hugest thing of my favorite food (PALATAL!) and drinks and came and sat in the back with me to eat! It was so sweet, and sooo yummy. Rons never had it before so I figure I got him hooked. haha. That night I went to bed by 10 i was so tired. Sunday Ron took me school supply shopping, which was so exciting and then we went our seperate ways to eat, and then got back together at around 7pm. We went to Jonnys/now Tristans (cuz Tristan and Jayme moved into Jonny's) and we watched them play this video game called Condemned: Criminal Origins. It was pretty neat. I started falling asleep though because I was tired and the couch was so warm and nice haha. We told Tristan we have to take him this Wednesday to Tavern United, so hopefully everyone is down for that. I'm craving those wings!<br /><br />Anyway...decent weekend. I actually have two days off this week, holy shit. Thank god. hahaha. I'm thinking bout going on the boat next Friday, so long as the group is good. If you know what I mean. Other than wings on Wednesday, and boat possibly on Friday, no other plans confirmed as of yet. I'm sure something will come up :)<br /><br />Well the pointless update is over for now.&nbsp;<br />xoxo<br /></p>"

"event","So Ron is home now, which I am sooooooo happy about. For some reason though it just feels like sometimes I catch myself anticipating him leaving again soon, like I'm trying to hold onto the time spent with him this week, really tight, as if he's leaving again next week. Which he isn't so me feeling this way sometimes is kind of funny. I guess I'm just used to him having to go out of town quite a bit lately.&nbsp; I am so glad he is home again though, it was lonely without him here &lt;3.<br />Well since he's been home I've been hanging out with him and oh, working my god damn ASS off. I, as of tomorrow, will have worked 39 3/4 hours haha. It's going to be good money, most of which is going towards the money I haven't been saving up for my school books haha.&nbsp;<br />I've been downloading quite a bit of cd's lately too. Lamb Of God - As The Palaces Burn; All That Remains - This Blackened Heart; As I Lay Dying - A Long March: The First Recordings; As Blood Runs Black - Allegiance; AFI - Decemberunderground (dont ask lol); Billy Talent - II; and I can't remember what else. Been on a pretty big new CD kick, which I've been sharing with Ron haha.&nbsp;<br />Boat cruise tonight, dunno if I'm going. I'd like to go with Ron, who I think is going with Ted, so we shall see. I had a really stressful day at work today...fucking boss is nuts. He called me at 12:40, I get off at 1 and he is like FLIPPING out saying we are like 60 dollars short or some shit like that. and made ME, 15 minutes before my shift ends, recount ALL the tickets, ALL the money and make a new sales sheet. He's fucked up. I flat out told him I wasn't stealing his money and he said ""im not implying that you and whatsherface are stealing"". I told Katie that Dale called her 'whatsherface' and shes gonna quit. Shes had enough of the crap there.&nbsp; Sooooo Kaitlynn (my kait!) is gonna drop off her resume and I'm going to make sure that Dale hires her lol! Yayness.&nbsp;<br /><br />I'm so exhausted I find it funny. I've been getting up at 5:30 every morning, and staying up pretty late. I'm pretty hyper right now, I think I'm gonna end up burning out later and just passing out on the boat or something hahaha. Ah well, Ron can take care of me :P<br /><br />Same shit next week except I work 1-7pm every day. I dont know which is worse, wasting my afternoon every day working, or depriving myself of much needed sleep to work super early. Hmmm...<br /><br />OoooOOOoooOOO.... <strong><u>15 fucking days!!</u></strong><br /><br />So Gerard is out of the hospital, still baring portable tubes, but at least he's up and about, thank god. He's still hellish skinny...its....scary. Kinda gross, but hey, whatever turns your crank right??&nbsp; I'm just glad he's feeling better. <br /><br /><br />"

"event","<p>Oh gawd. I hate leaving updating for so long because I can never remember what's happened in the time span it's been left. Woops! I know I left off right before Canada day....</p>
<p>The first boat cruise was alright....There were some things that occured on the boat itself that I wish I could put past me but seem to be having a hard time shoving from my head. I got pretty drunk, not as drunk as Ron tho. The aftermath of the boat was extremely fun. I didn't get home until pretty late. Heh.<br />Canada day I went over to Tristan and Jayme's appartment while Ron worked on his car and we drank and sat around and ate Mcdinks. Ron came a few hours later, as did Ted. We went to Jonny's buddy's place where they set off fireworks. It was pretty sweet, even tho we only caught the tail end. We ended up going back to T&amp;J's for a while, drank a bit more and played drinking games and just all chilled together. <br />The Unholy Alliance concert was on the 9th and it was fucking killer!!! Lamb Of God kicked ass, it was beautiful. And Children of Bodom just fucking rocked the MTS centre. Slayer was cool. That's all I have to say about Slayer. I was at the front for COB and LOG as was Ron, until he went to thrash around in the huge circle pit for the rest of LOG. Great concert. Less than three weeks until Sounds of the Underground! EEEE!!<br /><br />Ron left the day after the concert to go do some work out of town. I miss him, it's been pretty boring here without him. Been spending time with Kait and Linsey, trying to pick courses because I register next Friday. And working. Work work work. I work mon-sat this week, sunday off and mon-sat next week. hahaha ouch. Ive been getting up at 5:30 the whole week (I know its only tuesday, heh. But for the rest of the week too!) so im dead tired. Ron is coming home tonight at some point so im just waitin for him to call!<br /><br />Been goin on the boat cruise once in a while (i think ive been on 2 or 3 now..I dunno) and I have passes for Friday. I work 7:00am every day this week tho and Saturday morning at 7:30 so I'm debating going, I might be dead tired and I was hoping Ron and I could go out for supper on Saturday evening, and I dont want to be rediculously dead tired for that.&nbsp;<br /><br />Well I can't remember much else that has happened....im getting old. </p>"

"event","My summer holidays are zinging by me. I can't believe I have been out since the beginning of May...I'm pretty much about ready to go back to school. What a nerd, hey?? Before classes ended I figured my summer holidays would consist of tons of partying, boozing, tanning and chilling. Well the chilling and a bit of boozing has commenced. Mostly I've just done alot of reading, hanging out with friends and working. Although this week has been pretty interesting....<br /><br /><strong>Monday: </strong>Didn't work on Monday, which was a first, but Katie and I switched shifts (she took my Monday, I took her Wednesday), so I pretty much slept in, swam and then relaxed. After supper (which consisted of a pretty much constant in my belly - perogies) Gerard called me up and asked me if I wanted to hang out, so we agreed to go to Chapters so I could pick out my brothers Birthday present, a book for myself (which ended up being the prequel to The Da Vinci Code, called Angels And Demons), and so Gerard could get himself some starbucks.&nbsp; I invited Ron along, who was pretty bummed out about the fact that his red (AND blue) Camaro (s) are dead. His engine is screwed on the red, and the blue just needs a helluva lotta body work and stuff. Wings at Montana's seemed to cheer him up about .5% however. Gerard and I split an order of wings, mild (mmm) considering I am trying to lose weight...then we decided to get another order, which didn't come for like half a frickin hour, so they were free, decided the free ones ""never happened"" (ahem!) and ordered a third pound. YIKES. Ron had some of ours tho, so that kinda helped my gut... a bit?? Ron got a pound of BBQ (I think) and then the spiciest ones which took him a little longer to eat, teehee :P. We took him home after wings, because it was gettin pretty late. I went and paid my phone bill, and ran into Matthew Prepost! I haven't seen him in forever (outside McDonalds of course). He goes to U of W as well, but he's taking communications. Hopefully I'll see him around in the fall! So chatted with him for a bit, and then I went to Seven 11 for some candy, got hit on by the sev guy, and then went home to start my new book.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Tuesday: </strong>Linsey came over after she got off work, we ate supper and hung out, just chillin'. Then I went to walmart where I got the sweetest shoes ever, they're black with redish pink soles, and SKULLS all over the top parts of the shoes!! How sweet is that for walmart? Oh and to make it better, they were only 5 frickin dollars! I love my new shoes.&nbsp; Kaitlynn came over once we were done our shopping, and we went swimming till we got pruny and goosebumpy. We decided to go play some pool, and invited Ted and Ron. We went to Classics, which was actually really fun for being dead. I'm not one for super busy atmospheres anyway (part of the reason why I dont go to the bar much). So Ron stayed for a few games and then took off to go to bed, and then the four of us got a table, a few drinks and some of <em>the </em>best french fries I have ever had!! Drank alot of Tom Collins, played some more pool, and then went home and to bed!<br /><br /><strong>Wednesday: </strong>Yesturday was pretty damn uneventful. Worked from 1-7. Arlene informed me that she changed Katie's and my schedule so that every day that we work we have to come in by 1. I found it funny that she didnt <em>ask </em>but told me thats when I had to come in. What a bossy nut. Then Dale came in a while after she left and asked me if I figured out how to put together the outside swing-sign and I said ""uhh...was I supposed to?"" and he said ""it'd be nice."" like I was supposed to KNOW to put it together. I didn't even know thats what was in that box. Did I do it? NO. I was not hired to put together hardware for a man! Thats a MANS job thank you. So whatev, worked until 7, my pa picked me up (along with the whole damn-fam. including the puppy). Went home and read and dinked around on the computer and went to bed.<br /><br />Today....again uneventful. Worked, Ron popped into Jon's for a bit, won ten bucks (yay him!) and then came home to give my brother his birthday present. He turned 9 today, and my parents bought him that new Nintendo DS Lite, so I got him a super mario's game to go with it, and im going to give him the two books I got him at his birthday party on Saturday. Saturday is also my DADS b-day, so I gotta get him a card. I ate some taco's, went swimming, came in and read then watched Seven (for like the 100th time - what a SWEET movie), ate some really good b-day cake and now here I am. Im pretty bummed by the fact that i'm going to be broke before I even get money in my pocket tomorrow. Ha. Shitty. I need to put minimum away for school, a hundred bucks. I need to pick up perscription, pay my dad for some paint and my neighbour for some furniture i bought off her for my room. all in all i need to set aside at least 180 bucks for all that shit...and then I get to have some money. UGH. Stupid bills, stupid money. I bet the neanderthals didn't give shit-one about money. How nice for them.<br /><br />Tomorrow is the first boat cruise of the summer!!! Who's down? I'm so going, so long as I'm not dead tired from work or something. Saturday's a day off for me, so i'm getting trashed tomorrow. I have five passes guys....give my cell a call if your down!!<br /><br />Saturday was supposed to be my somewhat bbq, party thing as my parents were gonna take off for Canada day. But they decided to fuck around and stay home, so now my Canada day plans are screwed. Sunday is probably going to be my hang over day or just plain ol' recooperation day. Monday is a day off too! thank gawd....dunno what I'm doing on Monday, that's WAY too far in advance.<br /><br />Well now that I've wasted 20 minutes of my life writing in something no one reads, I'm gonna go do something constructive. Like...expanding my mind by reading. :: nerd snort ::<br /><br /><em><u>Disconnect &amp; Self-Destruct 1 Bullet @ A Time. </u></em>"

"event","I seem to have a tendancy to update in spurts, but if I haven't updated in a week or so, I fail to remember what happened at the start of the week.&nbsp; Unfortunately the months of May and June have been a blur of working, hanging, the occasional drunk night, and lots of reading. Can anyone spell NERD?<br /><br /><strong>The Weekend:&nbsp; </strong>The weekend was spent with my favorite person (Ron of course, DUH). We hung out, went to a movie after I got off work with Tristan &amp; Jayme, and rented a bunch of movies on Sunday. It was nice, because the start of my weekend was a little swamped with constant painting and working and lack of food (I seemed to have been so busy, I ran out of time to eat. I felt like one of those vitamin commercials). Saturday, although we watched Scary Movie 4 in the cheapies, was an early night and Sunday was spent shopping (bought As I Lay Dying - Shadows Are Security, much to the dismay of Ron) and then movie watching and an abundance of relaxation commenced.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Monday: </strong>Fortunately dead day at work. I hate to say it, but I LOVE working Mondays. They are always so dead. It's like people don't exist right away after the weekend, and forget to come in to do drycleaning or get lottery tickets. Its funny. People just drift through Monday, and then remember to do everything Tuesday. I hate working Tuesdays. -.-<br /><br /><strong>Tuesday: </strong>Thankfully a day off! As I hate working Tuesdays, but am not scheduled for a Tuesday shift at all this month so my hate of working Tuesdays is very moot. Delved into The Da Vinci Code the moment I woke up, and didn't stop until about 2ish when Kaitlynn came over to pig out on perogies, talk about courses, and swim.&nbsp; It was great to hang out with her, since I haven't seen her since about the end of school (Mayish). Nice to catch up, plus she always makes me laugh so hard! She stayed until about 5:30, and about 10 minutes after she left, <em>I </em>left for Rons, where I watched him re-record some of their sweeeeeet songs, while I finished reading The Neverending Story. :: nerd snort ::.<br />We then when to Smitty's, just the two of us, for wings. Unfortunately for my stomach and I, I got a 'bad wing' and spent the night throwing up in the bathroom.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Wednesday: </strong>Woke up early to call Arleen to see what time I had to be in at work. She said 2, and I debated going back to bed, but decided The Da Vinci code was way more important than sleep. I read, and I am almost done the book. Funny since Tristan leant it to me Saturday night and I have been pretty busy, it's just so good! Talked to Tim who decided he would walk over to my place with his suit that needed to be cleaned, and then walked to work with me, and kept me company for a while. It started getting swamped though with stuff for me to do, and after some 'sisterly' advice on relationships, he took off. Spent the rest of my shift feeling sick, overheated, overswamped and guilty that I cant go to the X with Linsey. Ron came and got me after work and we went to Computer boulivard together, cuz he decided he needed more giggies. Teehee. Got more giggies and then went on a hunt for sushi at Sobeys, to no avail. Settled with dried fruit (banana's, mango and dried fruit and nut mix). Borderline nautious from lack of food/overheating I went home and inhaled a huge burger with bacon and fried onions. YA that's good for my diet. :: sarcasm ::.&nbsp;<br />Since I got home, this is the first time I've managed to drag my ass out of bed and away from The Da Vinci Code. I nerdishly am very enthusiastic about this book. It is probably one of the most captivating, well written books Ive read in a while. I read a helluva lot, so that's something. I can't wait to finish it, but don't want it to end. Okay, now that I've condemned myself to dork HELL for saying that.....<br />Tomorrow, after hopefully a half-assed sleep in, I'm gonna paint my room some more cuz my dad is home for the day. I can't wait to finally be down there. It will be so nice to have a room that doesn't resemble a walk in closest.&nbsp;<br />Tomorrow also happens to be Thursday, which is technically the second wing night of the week. Although unfortunately broke, money or no, Im a little wary to go stuff my face full of wings anytime soon. OOOOH Smitty wings, how I love theee!!!<br /><br />I get paid Friday, which is supposed to be my 400 dollar paycheck...before tax. God knows what it will be <em>after </em>the government robs me.&nbsp;<br />Well now that Im bitter about money, I'm gonna go back to The Da Vinci Code. <br />"

Which was nice!

Last night Ron and I went out for wings, just the two of us! It was really cool, I ate so many wings haha, then stole the bill and payed for both of us. Teehee. Other than that we just chilled together which was very enjoyable.

Today I did more course stuff, and told my grama all about the Education thing, which she seems to think is a blessing in disguise, which actually seems to be pretty acurate. I did nothing today, and now I'm hoping to go see The Omen, although I'm slowly becoming more poor hahaha.

"event","<p>Tuesday, my day off, which also happened to be 06.06.06, was spent picking courses, back up courses, and back ups for the back ups. Here's what I have picked so far:&nbsp;<br />~ Creative Writing*<br />~ Professional Style and Editing*<br />~ Types Of Popular Literature*<br />~ Literature and Film<br />~ Modern Fiction In Translation<br />~ Classical Mythology*<br />~ Religion In Greece and Rome*<br />~ Topics In Ancient History<br />~ Medieval World<br />~ Ancient and Modern Conflict<br />~ World History*<br />~ 20th Century World<br />~ Anti-Semitism*<br />~ Europe 1350-1650<br />~ American History to 1877<br /><br />(The ones * are my main picks, everything else is back up.) I would <em>loveeeeeee </em>to take ALL of the courses, but unfortunately it won't fit. Considering the stupid University has almost all the English classes scheduled at the same time, I probably can't take more than the three unless I take night classes, and that would be sooo shitty.&nbsp; Linsey and Kait might take Classical Mythology with me, which would be so much fun, although we would get nothing done in class, haaa.&nbsp;<br /><br />Tuesday night, subconciously in honor of 06.06.06, I went out for wings (Smitty's) and got my fav's, Sweet Chilli, which of course inevitably gave me heart-burn when I got home, at like 11pm. But they're always worth it. The funny thing was that night was that because Hillary looked like she was under-age we got I.D.'ed. I've never been I.D.'ed there before. I guess it's cuz I've never gone there without Ron and Tristan and them, who look so much older. It was funny because the waitress was so dumb, she looked at me and said ""funny, I thought you'd be the oldest cuz you look older than 18."" and I was like ...""Uhh. I am the oldest."" and she was like ""....I'll go get your wings."" LOL. It was funny. Stupid waitresss. She was kinda shitty. <br />I also found out that night that Jenna used to work at Jonathon's. It was very amusing, I was impressed.&nbsp;<br /><br />So I'm getting paint tonight or tomorrow (depends on what I do tonight or if my pappy works too late) and my mother finally gave in and said I could get the red with torqouise if I pay half. HAAAA she'll never stop me now!!&nbsp; I'm pretty psyched. Dad and I are *finally* painting Saturday morning because I don't work until 1pm. I was gonna switch my shift with Katie (or ask anyway) cuz I hate the afternoon shifts, I like the morning ones, but I'd rather paint in the morning than after work. Boo-urns to that.&nbsp;<br /><br /><em>(There's a tiny dancer in my bed, &amp; she never has too much to say, she reminds me of the Danse Russe....)<br /><br /></em>Yesturday at work, in regards to clothes, it was pretty dead. But I had like 100 customers in an hour all for 6/49 because it was like 29 mill. It was so amusing because half of the customers that came in are regulars and kept telling me they'd give me a cut of the money, hahaha, so I have my fingers crossed for sure!!<br />Hillary <strong>and </strong>Gerard came and visited me at work yesturday, and then Hillary bumped into the sensor and I had to unplug it cuz it wouldn't stop going off. Oh shit, it was funny, she was so embarrassed. Gerard didn't drive Hillary home...or offer for that matter....so she stuck around until her mom came and got her. It was nice to have visitors, it was good and distracting. Which also meant that i left some of the stuff that was done and for today, for Arlene to bag. So ha! Take that bitcccch! Grrr...I hate her, she's such a psycho. She always leaves Katie and I such stupid shit to do and so much of it. Pisses me off.<br />I also forgot to do half of the closing stuff last night cuz I was a little distracted (on the phone) so I'll probly get in shit today. Any excuse for Arlene to come down on me and she will. I work until 7pm again tonight but I ACTUALLY have tomorrow off. It's the first Friday off since I started, haha....that really sucks....<br /><br />Other than that I did shit all yesturday. I orded myself a pizza, which now I'm regretting, cuz I'm sure I just put on all that weight I dropped ha.<br /><br /><em>(Damn it all, I love you, but you're unkind.)<br /><br /></em>And yet I'm taking more pizza to work. I have no back-bone. In regards to anything....<br />Oh well, I was a dumb ass yesturday and didn't go and pick up bus tickets to get to work, so now I have to walk there as well as home.&nbsp;<br />I am such a complainer. Teehee.<br /><br />31 days \m/ - Everytime I think about it, I start to hyperventilate I'm so excited!<br /><br /></p>"

I got my marks in the mail, two C+'s (English), B in Anthro and a D in philo, but that was expected. Actually I expected to fail, and I didn't, Wooo! Sunday I got my ears peirced a couple times with Linsey and then we went and hung out with Ron, who got a call like an hour later, so we went and hung out in the pool until he called again and after supper we went cruising in his sexy Camaro. Unfortunately something was wrong with his car and something was boiling, so we took it home and Linsey went to hang out with <em>her </em>boyfriend and Ron and I hung out some more. It twas fun. It means alot to me that my two closest friends are getting along enough to hang out, it was nice.&nbsp;<br />Next weekend, in between Ron picking up his second Camaro, I want us to go to tattoo shops (thats what we were supposed to do Sunday but he got the on-call call) so we can scope out some good clean places and some neat designs/tattoos. Cuz not only does Ron want a third one but I want a first one and I really want him to be there!!&nbsp; OOh and speaking of piercings&nbsp;and tattoos, on my b-day Lins and I are going to get our bellybuttons done at The Crypt. Saweet. I'm excited. Well thats if I lose another twelve pounds, but I've lost quite a bit already so I'm sure I'll drop it by my b-day.&nbsp;<br /><br />Anywho. Today and Friday I actually have off, which is exciting cuz I rarely get days off. But even with these days off my next check is gonna be about 400 dollars (before tax). The 18th is the day/night Linsey and I are going to the X and hopefully Ron and Marc are coming as well.&nbsp;<br /><br />Well even tho I haven't updated in a little while there isn't much to really report. Just working and hanging out, catching some sun, Rons in town for a good while (hopefully), yay, and all that lovely jazz. My summer is AWESOME so far.<br /><br />Oh ya. 33 facking days!!! \m/!!!!<br /><br />"

"event","<p>I keep meaning to update, but haven't been because I'm either a) too busy or b) think I'm too lame to update cuz there's nothing much to report.<br /><br />Ron has been coming and going. The weekends seem to be a blur of jamming in as much hang out time as possible with him as he keeps going back out to Dryden during the week.&nbsp; The good-bye's are getting suckier (for lack of a better word) because I've never been one for good-byes. I know that they are short trips and all but I hate change, and ron being out of town is change, and I don't like it, as selfish as that is. I want him to come home, I'm worried that he's over working himself, 14 hour days are very long especially the line of work he does. When I saw him on Saturday he looked so tired and it wasn't the stayed-up-to-late tired, but the physical and mental exhaustion people get from overworking themselves. But on the other hand I am so glad he gets to come home for weekends, it's nice.&nbsp;<br />This weekend alot of shopping commenced, I bought 2 girlie type movies, much to the dismay of Ron (Chronicles of Narnia and Sisterhood Of The Traveling Pants), a book (The Second Summer Of The Sisterhood [sensing a trend?]). And the Buffalo BBQ went on this weekend. Ron and I went with Tristan, Jayme, and Ted the night of Rons backyard BBQ to it, and we went on the Skymaster and the Zipper. The Zipper resulted in a huge bruise on my thigh that makes me look like I've been beaten. Not even exagerating.&nbsp;<br />Last night we relaxed together, and with his parents, and watched the cheesy remake of When A Stranger Calls, and then Walk The Line, which was VERY well done I have to say. I hate country music, but it was a great movie.&nbsp; I was kind of sad when I had to go home because it meant the end of another great weekend and the beginning of another quiet one with no Ron-calls.&nbsp;<br />This week I work every other day which is cool, and Gerard and I are going to Linseys Thursday night after work and probably spending the night.&nbsp;<br /><br />On a shitty note, my cell phone is broken, sort of. The piece around the light that lights up when its charging and I'm getting calls broke off, making the top of my flip phone so loose it's flaps around like a dead thing. It still works, but now even more is breaking off and its going to just end up falling off in general. I really wanted to stay home and do nothing tomorrow but I suppose I have to take it in to get fixed, *if* those money-grabbing bastards will actually fix it.&nbsp;<br /><br />Besides that nothing else important to report. This is what I meant by lame update. Things are generally good. Room is almost done, summer and job is going good so far, besides Ron being out of town quite a bit this month, Linsey possibly has a new boyfriend (YAY for her!) and Gerard is going to get his lungs fixed. And me? well I can't complain. :P<br /><br />xoxo</p>"

But apparently they are going to be working 4, 10 hour days and then come home for weekends. Poor Ronnie. I'm so glad he's comin home! He'll be home tomorrow! Can't waaait to see him. &lt;3<br /><br />My week has gone by as if I've been trying to run through molasses. Slow and blah. Although Monday Gerard came and met up with me after work and we went to forbidden flavors just to hang out over icecream, then we went and walked down Osbourne, which was fun and we haven't done since last summer. There was this amazing store that I need to go into when it's actually open (we were on Osbourne like 2 seconds after all the stores closed haha). Then we got Starbucks and I eventually made it home. I've been working every day and I'm getting <strong>so </strong>exhausted. Especially since yesturday, today and tomorrow I'm supposed to be covering shifts at the ness location. But that's where all the chemicals are and I'm having an allergic reaction!! I need to tell him but I dont want him to fire my ass. Although I did like nothing yesturday, so I dunno. But I dont feel like being all spotty and itchy and red for when Ron comes home. Not fun. It's irritating and I was so bitchy yesturday after work because it is so gross there! I want to go back to Jonathons!! :(<br /><br />I'm gonna go in this morning to The Cleaners (thats the Ness one) and tell Dale about the reaction. Hopefully he'll just let me sit up front doing nothing or let me go home.&nbsp;<br /><br />Other than that there's nothing much else.

"event","My week sort of went by in a really slow blur. I worked alot, which is a good distraction, because I really miss Ron. It seems alot longer than 6 days, more like 6 weeks. On Friday though Tristan called me up to see if I wanted to go out for a kind of birthday celebration for him, so Jonny picked me up after work and we all went downtown to the Pony Corral. It was Ted, Tristan, Matt, Jonny and me. I had alot of fun but it was kind of lonely without Ron :( Not to mention the waitress who knew Tristan thought I was his fiance! HAHAHA, I thought I was gonna choke I laughed so hard. Just before we were going to go, guess who called Tristans cell? Ron did!!! Apparently he tried calling my cell twice and my house phone then finally got a hold of me through Tristans cell, haha. I found that kind of cute. It was SOOO nice to hear his voice. So I talked to him for a bit, then we all went out for Gilati's on Corydon, then I went home.&nbsp;
I opened for the first time at work on Saturday (with Caitlin) and it was sickeningly dead. It was awesome. I'm going to love opening on Saturdays, ha.
When I got home I slept for 3 hours and then did nothing but read. I got invited to a) go to the bar b) go to a movie and c) go to a part with Tristan &amp; Jayme. However I picked d) stay home and read. But I got a nice phone call again (RON!) which was really nice. He sounded so tired though..I can't wait until he comes home.&nbsp;

Yesturday was a fun day, I started packing up my stuff, and then Linsey and I went to the U of W to pick up the book courses for the 2006-07 term, and then went to perkins for lunch. It was cute cuz we both ordered two different chicken burgers and two different kinds of fries. Haha. Then we went back to my place and she helped me pack more stuff and clean up alot of shit. After that we just lounged.

For supper we had steak and baked potato's and fried mushrooms. I felt huge haha. I had to clean up all the white powder from the sanding in my new room, which was a pain in the ass and hurt my eyes, and throat so bad. I watched some tv and read some and then had a huge urge to call Ron and check in to see how his day went. So I talked to him for a few, then I downloaded the new city and colour CD (made a copy for Ron) and watched Greys Anatomy, Big Love, and went to bed.

I work 2-7 and 9-1 tomorrow and after that I'm really not sure. Hope I work for the rest of the week, because then I'll have lots of money for may long.

Although in the next couple of weeks they're cutting down my hours to 15 a week and its SOOO not enough because i need to save up for my school books. Shit. I dont want to get a second job.

Cant wait for Ron to come home &lt;3

my new job is going really well, I'm apparently picking things up fast, but it's still pretty hard cuz I had to learn cash, the lottery, bagging and tagging clothes, sorting, pricing, buying/selling used books, and so much other things I've forgotten already. I work every day this week except Sunday (thank gawd.), Sunday I'm spending a girl day shopping with Hillary and Linsey. But as I was saying, the job is going very well. Tuesday I worked until 1pm, and then went home to dink around for a bit, and then my dad drove me to this lottery course I had to take because I needed a certificate saying I can use the machines apparently. It went on until 8:30 and then Ron came and picked me up so I could join them at Smitty's! It was really sweet. Got wings cuz I was very hungry, and I didn't leave a tip because I'm horrible and poor. lol, I think the girl was offended but Tristan didn't leave a top either so HA. After Smittys, Ted and Jonny and Tristan left and Ron and I spent some time together. It was raining really hard out, which seemed suiting. 2 weeks is an awfully long time ...for me anyway. ha.

I work today, 10-2. tomorrow 2-7 and saturday morning like 7:30 to 1 or something. I need to check the schedule again. Working is keeping me occupied, but my small feet aren't used to holding my fat ass up for 5 hours at a time. GAWD.

Well seeing as how I have nothing cool to report because Ron isnt here there is nothing else to write.
Except I got The Sisterhood Of the Traveling Pants for only 50cents at work, cuz, well I work there! Go me. It's a good book.

mmmyup. Im boring.

For one it was WAYYYY too far. Like rediculously far for someone who has to take the bus and lives on an off-street. For another I hated my shifts. They gave me all the shitty ones and even though I said I could work no later than 8pm cuz it is so far they scheduled me for 8:30 which meant I had to miss my last bus. So dumb. So I quit, HA.&nbsp; This new job should be cool though, its nice and quiet and we sell books too heeeeheee! Im going to end up buying most of them, haha.&nbsp;<br />I start tomorrow 9 until probably 2ish...and then in the evening starting at 5pm I do believe, I have to go take a course to get my lottery licence. They train you how to use the lottery machine and everything, but apparently it is very easy. Hopefully I dont seem like a dolt.&nbsp;<br />I'm kind of sad I have to go to this thing tomorrow because Ron leaves for a work trip on Wednesday morning. I'm going to be really disappointed if I dont get to see him before he goes and this course is supposed to be like 3 or 4 hours long! BAH. That sucks.&nbsp;<br />My weekend was goodly. Teds b-day was on Friday so he had a partay. I worked until 8:30 and then took the bus to the general area of St. James, where Ron came and picked me up ( so nice of him ) and he also bought me McDonalds cuz I completely missed the BBQ part of the party!! It was yummy. There was this crazy girl at the party who was so nosy and made me feel uncomfortable, as did half the people at the party, but I was glad I went cuz it was Teds b-day!! We left at about the same time Tristan and Jayme did and drove around for a bit.&nbsp;<br />Saturday Ron and I were going to hang out and spend some time together cuz he was supposed to leave Tuesday and all but he ended up going and working on Teds parents plumbing from 2-10pm so we got together kind of late, watched Minority Report, ate Gondola pizza and just relaxed together. I dont know what Im going to do for 2 weeks, I know that sounds SO lame but...I look forward to him calling me and all every day and hanging out with and stuff. Its going to be a lonely 2 weeks. Im going book shopping this weekend though.&nbsp;<br />Sunday was kind of boring and rainy, although I finished The Vampire Armand which was a good book.&nbsp;<br /><br />Now im just waitin for Ron to call me back maybe we could hang out for an hour or two tonight so at least I can say good bye in person tonight if I cant see him tomorrow.&nbsp;<br />Besides getting a new job, quitting ticketmaster and Ron leaving for a couple weeks, there's not much else...<br /><br />Downloaded the new Lacuna Coil cd, which is super awesome but doesn't top Comalies. Nothing ever will. &lt;3</p>"

"event","What a great weekend besides the fact that I worked for most of it. Ron had Friday off so he picked me up on Friday morning so we could spend some time together before I went to work and he took me to do some running around (got me out the money for his Sounds Of The Underground ticket) and I went to the bank and took out a bunch of my own money and then we went and I bought us McDonalds for breakfast ^_^. MMMmmm fat.&nbsp; Then we went back to his house and I helped him with his car (sorta) and helped his mom move around stuff on her deck. We relaxed for a while and then he drove me to the library (what a sweetie) so I could return my overdue books (which I have yet to pay the fees for, heh, woops). Then I bussed it to work.&nbsp;<br />Friday night Ron was going to go to a social with the gang but ended up hanging out with me (I'm so lucky!) because he got home too late from checking out the second Camaro that he's decided to buy. It's a generation before his and sooo pretty. Now he's got a little brother for his reddy-purple one!!! I went home earlish on Friday because I had to be up at 7:30 the next morning cuz I worked 11-7 and it takes me forever to get ready and to get there. Even though I woke up early I was still late for work, yikes. I forgot my bus tickets and had to go back home super quick to get them and missed the bus I was supposed to take. Ah well nobody noticed that I was late. Ha. So then I got shuffled through like 5 different people for training and ended up with this asshole named Tim for the majority of my shift. He made me feel so dumb and like I should know everything. Plus when I was going through the script, out of the corner of my eye, I could see him shaking his head. He was a prick. I got about an hour and a half worth of breaks though which was sweet, hahaha. So anyway after a very long and somewhat stressful day at work I went home, my parents made me a killer supper AND got me a Tim Hortons Ice Capp which made me feel a million times better.<br />That night I went with Ron, Tristan, Jayme and Ted to Hooters and then Ted drove me home because him and Ron were going to Adriens b-day shindig. I went to bed so early, probably at around 12:30ish, and didnt get up until 1 or 1:30. It was the best sleep ever. The weather was frickin amazing when I woke up so I went and lounged around outside hoping for a tan (not receiving any tho) and then my pa took me, Evan and his friend Kaitlin to DQ and got us Blizzards and I also picked up mine and Rons Sounds Of The Underground tickets which turns out to be August 6th not October. OMG SWEET.<br />Afterwards when I got home Ron invited me over to his moms b-day supper, and he came and picked me up in his Camaro &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3 SOO PRETTY. We did some driving around, we did some birthday eating, some Sunday night cruising, some Burger Factory eating and then some more Sunday night cruising. It was alot of fun. First cruise night of the season for both of us and I felt so honored. Unfortunately the weather went to absolute shit by 3:30pm and we had to put the T-roofs back on. Boo-urns.&nbsp;<br /><br />Its cold today too and stupidly windy. Figures that my days off will be cold and shitty!!!! I work Thursday, Friday and Saturday - 3:30-8:30, even though I put 8 as my latest availability. I'll have to talk to them. Those shifts are going to bite. Not to mention its Ted's b-day on Friday and he's having a bbq again sometime this weekend so I dont even know if I'm going to be able to make it cuz I work and might not be able to get a ride. I'm going to have to talk to Ron aboot it.<br /><br />So I went to the bank today and got an application for a credit card and also got my daily limit raised to 300 and my debiting limit is 500. CHA-CHING. Then I went to the MTS phone place and got my cell phone bill officially switched over to my name. I feel so much more responsible now, HA. I can't wait until my next payday. Its going to be like $200+ SWEET.<br /><br />So the new Lacuna Coil cd came out apparently, which Im insanely excited about getting and I need to inform Ron of this as well :P and the new Tool cd, 10 000 Days, is soooo good. A little too much like the last CD, but it's stil really awesome. I love Tool/APC.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><strong>Sunday, July 9 - Unholy Alliance Tour - Lamb of God, Children of Bodom, &amp; Slayer!<br />Sunday, August 9 - Sounds Of The Underground Tour - IN FLAMES ( FUCK YA), Trivium, As I lay Dying, Cannibal Corpse, etc.!!!!!!!<br /><br /></strong>See you all in the hospital headbangers!!!!<br />\m/"

I work tomorrow 2:45-7pm, and then on Saturday I work 10:45-7pm which kind of bums me out cuz not only is that my entire Saturday day kind of wasted, but Ashley isn't working so who knows who the hell is training me. I sure hope that they don't put me on the phones or anything. Ashley says they won't but who knows. Meh.&nbsp; My last exam was today, it took me almost 2 and a half hours to do. It was my Immortality In Literature class and I think the exam went super good. Or I hope so at least!!! The first part was quotations where you had to list the author, the book and the significance of the quote. The second part was on poetry, I did an analysis of an e.e. cummings poem (who by the way, SUCKS) and then the third and last part was an essay on how beauty and immortality was tied together in the works we did. Hoping I got a B....I got 11.5 out of 15 on my journal assignment, not too shabby.&nbsp; But today was the first day of my official summer holidays! Now I can work and party and not have to worry about studying! Here's to 4 months of hardly any sleep, too much work and too much fun!! Hahahahahahaha. Besides that, I'm just relaxing watching Firestarter and waiting for Ron to call. Gonna go to the library tomorrow to finally return my overdue books and then to work and then who knows what, it is Friday, but I am broke. haha. WOO summer holidays!!!"

"event","What a <strong>killer</strong> weekend! Well except Thursday, but, that isnt *technically* part of the weekend (haha). On Thursday I was hellish sick and seriously didn't want to do anything at allllllll, so I went to bed at like 10:30, woke up for a bit, then went back to bed. Ha. Friday was awesome fun! I think I studied in the afternoon, after I managed to pull my ass out of bed, and then Ron and his parents invited me over for a steak dinner and Rhonda's awesome potato salad. It was soooo good. Mmmm steak....afterwards, we listened to some new Atreyu and some As I Lay Dying then had Tristan, Jayme and Ted over and just sat in the backyard with a fire. It was *so* nice to be able to do that finally! NO SNOW!! YESSSS!! Thank god....So we called it a somewhat early night at I think almost 11pm or something as everyone was kind of getting tired, and I stayed up stupidly late watching the Joan Of Arcadia marathon, ha. I'm bitchin' cool. Teehee. So Saturday, as usual, I procrastinated and didn't study. I think all I managed to do were some definitions and laundry, and laundry doesn't constitute as studying (I wish cuz I'd have an A!). At around five, Ron came and picked me up and we went to Sthuper Store to pick up some steak and met up with Jonny and Tristan and got chippies and junk for Teds BBQ!!! We got there and started BBQing right away. We started off with boiled shrimp, which Jonny made ""ick"" comments about the entire time haha, but I totally ate his share for him :P and then we cooked up our steaks, Rons mooing of course. Jonny did mine and it was soooo gooooooddddd....:: droolage :: and yes I'm aware I had steak 2 nights in a row. haha, I'm huge.&nbsp; Then we BBQ'ed up some chicken breasts and...chicken in general....and then we ate chips and drank beer (ew) and then Kaitlynn came over.&nbsp; We all just chilled outside on Teds deck and Kaitlynn force-fed me a gross Kokanee beer, ugggh, and then Tristan and Jonny took off, much to the protest of the rest of us. We all kind of wanted to go somewhere, but after losing half the crew, Ron, me, Kait and Ted just stayed at Teds, lounging in his Sauna (""Lets go in the Sauna Shauna!"") and watching TV.&nbsp; Then Margarita and her B/F came downstairs to tell Ron that her B/F's 1st generation Camaro was outside, so we all went outside to see it, then one by one we all eventually sauntered back in, Ron being last of course. Stayed until 2ish...and then Ron and I took off. Kaitlynn stayed, waiting for Ted to sober up to drive her home. O.o.....<br />Ted sent me the BBQ pictures last night, which turned out really sweet, I want to save them on disc and then go get them printed. There's a really cute one of Ron &lt;3<br /><br />Eventually got to sleep at like 4am...and then got up stupidly early (okay almost 11am) to study. Which I managed to stick to more or less all afternoon until our killer easter supper of marinaded steak, baked potatos and fried mushrooms. Yes, I deffinately did have steak three nights in a row. Yes I'm huge. Hahahaha. Then afterwords Ron came and picked me up and he actually watched The Chronicles Of Narnia with me!! I was sooooo excited...it was soooo good. Because he didn't have class today we watched another movie after, Monster, then&nbsp;I came home cuz I had my stupid exam this morning...which I bombed.<br /><br />By bombed I mean I have no idea how I did. I had a breakdown when I looked at the questions and left for a bit, unsure of whether my measly breakfast was going to come up or not, and then came back, attempted to bullshit my way through the fucked up exam.&nbsp; Everyone looked pretty apalled by it, one guy handed it in right away too, obviously failing. So to make myself feel better, I went and got McDicks breakfast as I had ten minutes until it was done, which wasn't too smart cuz it sure didn't make my stomach feel any better, ha. Came home, went back to bed, got woken up twice by Gerard, and then watched Joan of Arcadia and Gilmore Girls, did dishes and now here I am.&nbsp;<br /><br />I had such an awesome weekend, it was so fricking nice out. Unfortunately my days this weekend are kind of cut to shit cuz of my shifts. I work tomorrow 2:45-7pm, then I have Wed and Thurs off (English exam on thurs...) and then on Friday I work 2:45-7pm, and on Saturday 10:45-7pm. Kind of cuts into the middle of my day...but at least on Fri and Sat I still have my nights to go chill! I also get paid on Friday, thank god, as I am completely broke now.&nbsp;<br /><br />But since it is so beautiful out I might actually get out of my PJ's and go for a walk or ....outside somewhere. YAY for summer!<br /><br />xoxo"

"event","Wow work totally ROCKED my SOCKS today even though I'm pretty sick! I will not let this cold stop me!! Ashley trained me again, and she's more my work buddy than my trainer which is sweet. and Danielle is *so* cool about me having to cancel my shift tomorrow and told me to call in when I can to find out my schedule for next week! They're all really nice.&nbsp; So I listened into Ashley's phone calls and in between them we chatted about all sorts of things, then I took a lunch break with her and got paiiid for it lmao even though I a) wasnt schedule for a lunch break and b) it was supposed to be unpaid! Totally pro, I'm likin' this being trained thing, hah! Then Shawn came in at like 2:30 or whatev, and in between all our calls we talked about Dylan Thomas&nbsp;(since he was reading the compiled works of) and a whole bunch of other writers and books and such.&nbsp; I actually got to go on the computer today, I was so excited. I did all the typing for Ashley, more or less just followed her calls and entered all the data and found the tickets. I only screwed up once, weee! Ashley was pretty impressed that I caught on so quick, and Danielle just thinks I'm sthuper cool, teehee. I'm really liking it at ticketmaster...the atmosphere, the people, the work, its so much better than CSP and Zealous. Boo-urns to both!!!

I'm deffinately getting used to my glasses really quick...I only had a headache this morning because I didnt sleep well and the pressure in my head from whatever the hell my throat has caught. But other than that, no left-eye pain, and I dont feel dizzy like yesturday! I'm completely procrastinating with the Philosophy studying. I dont think I will get much done tonight unless I decide to confine myself to my room. But I also have all day tomrrow...so....hmm......maybe I'll do a day-before cram type thing, and hope for a D.

Except for the fact that my tonsils are FACKING swollen as usual. I worked yesturday, well continued my training, and I had such a great time cuz the cool girl Ashley with blue/green hair was the one who trained me! Shes 19, and awesome to chill with at work. My dad also picked up my glasses for me yesturday so as I'm typing this I can actually see what I'm doing, OMG. Last night, after I ate, Ron came and picked me up and I showed him my glasses teehee, he said they looked really good! I'm glad he thinks so cuz all I got was older person's opinions while I was at Oakley Optical. So we went out for wings (mmm wings) and then went to walmart where I helped him do some summer clothes shopping! Eeeee it was so much fun!!! He got some nice shirts and some shorts and it all looked sooo nice on him.&nbsp; Then I eventually made it home where I took a cold shower cuz my throat was killing me and I was very hot, and then watched Big Love and went to bed. Or tried to anyway. I got so stuffed up and my throat got so swollen in the middle of the night I got like no sleep. It was really rough since its the third night in a row where I haven't gotten more than four or five hours and its been constantly interupted. Ah well. In regards to my tonsils, I promised my doctor that I would make an appointment to see him or the nurse if they swelled up again, so I did, but it's for tomorrow, but I work tomorrow....so I'm going to have to tell work I have to switch my shift because it is apparently really important for me to get in to get some tests done on my tonsils. I was kind of bummed about having to switch my final training shift, not to mention that it's like my second week and I'm cancelling a shift, I don't want to look like the kind of person who is always calling in sick or trying to cancel shifts, but I guess itd be pretty hard for me to talk on the phone to ticketmaster customers if my tonsils dont go down a bit, heh.&nbsp; I can't wait until next Friday! I get paid heeeeeheee! I'll be gettin about $118.oo before tax, omg, to have money to do things again will be so nice. Not only that but after a couple paychecks I'm going to start saving up quite a bit of money for next year for school books and also just so I'll have a couple grand in my bank account for when I start school in september.&nbsp; I think I'm going to really like it at ticketmaster once I figure out how to get the hang of the system, ha. So much information...no wonder they have like a gazzilion shifts of training! It'll be nice to have a job for the summer and work pretty much as many shifts as I want and to make money. I was worried I wouldn't have anything for when I was done school and exams, and just going the not even month of being unemployed after all that stuff happened at Zealous made me feel like such a bum. I hate not having a job, it makes me feel so lazy!

So I gotta seriously buckle down to study philosophy because, well, I havent read any of the books and I havent studied yet, and my exam is on monday. Eek. Tomorrow apparently we're all having a BBQ somewhere (I think), Tristan thought it'd be fun anyway, and since the weather is so nice it'd be awesome to have a BBQ and drink and stuff. I hope plans follow through for tomorrow because it's a long weekend!!!!

So not much else to update...gotta get ready to make some money!

"event","Wow long time no update...I dont even know what has happened between now and my last update, ha, I'm so boring.<br />Well for one I got the job at Ticketmaster (the call centre). I started last Tuesday, 2-5, and Thursday, 2-5. Those were my tutorial shifts. It was so overwhelming. I spent both days just reading tutorials off the computers, I swear it would have taken me three shifts but I skipped through the last half of crap so I could move on. Probably not the smartest thing in the world as all of the shit I read seemed pretty important. I work/get trained again tomorrow 12:45-5pm. I think tomorrow what I do is just sit on a computer and mess around with the system and have somebody answer all my questions. Thats what Heather said anyway. I'm not too sure if I like the job yet or not, it's all so overwhelming and...crazy...alot of information to take in.&nbsp;<br />What else...uh I got glasses. I have a gimp eye haha, my left eye is very very far sighted (or is it near sighted? I cant remember...) and my right eye is pretty bad too, but not nearly as bad as my left. When I close my right eye, I cant really distinguish colors up close or super far away, and I cant read things very well...so I got glasses, they're really nice. Black thicker frame on the top part, and the bottom part is a very thin frame of green. They look really nice, I got to pick them up tomorrow. Woo! They were only 170 bucks with tax and all...thats a pretty sweet deal.<br /><br />Classes are done, I got a B on my English paper on Dracula and Trilby, which was an okay mark, even though I worked so hard on the paper...and for the philosophy one, well I'm crossing my fingers for a 50%.&nbsp; Im <strong>NEVER</strong> taking Philosophy again. <strong>EVER! </strong>It totally sucks, what a shitty class and a bitchy professor!&nbsp;<br />I had my Anthropology exam today though, which went not so bad. The first dozen multiple choice I was panicing over because I didn't know them, but the essay I knew exactly what I was talking about this time (unlike the damn mid-term). I think I did okay, I'm hoping for somewhere in the B's, but will settle for a C, or C+...I hope. haha.<br />My next exam is Philosophy, which is next monday, and I really should be studying but I am so burnt out from the concert last night. Then I have English that Thursday but I'm not too concerned.<br /><br />I had a really nice weekend, on Friday I got my glasses picked out and then went to Rons while he was fixing up car parts, and I kept him company and ate chicken fingers, afterwards we went out to Dylan O'Connors with Jeff and met up with a couple of his friends. I think I got home by midnight.<br />On Saturday I studied alot, or attempted to, and then in the evening I went to Tristan &amp; Jayme's with Ron, where Jonny and Ted were as well. Everyone except Tristan was VERY drunk, especially Jonny and Jayme, as they were drinking Absinthe. Ron even bought some too, and I have to say it tastes like mouthwash, but was alot of fun figuring out all the ways to get the sugar to dissolve in it, plus it *looks* cool. Jayme made me a couple Malibu drinks and being the cheapo I am I became very happy/giddy. I got home at ...well I dunno what time. I think by 2ish or something.<br />Sunday was my favorite day though. I slept in until 11ish and then I cleaned up my room and did about an hour of studying, and then I made supper for Ron! &lt;3!!&nbsp; I made Alfredo tortellini with diced chicken and fried mushrooms. He said it was his second favorite meal ever, eeee I did such a good job! I was so happy he liked it, I loooooooooove cooking for him. After that we went and got McFlurries ( so good! ) and then we went to the Taste Of Chaos concert where we met up with Gerard and Adam. For Atreyu we made it almost right up to the front and Ron caught their sweaty towel and he gave it to me! &lt;3 YAY sweaty towel! We then tried to get in line for As I Lay Dying to sign the sweaty towel that wasn't theirs, but they cut the line off, which really sucked. Ah well. Concert was good, except for trash-can-band, and some whinny band where the singer tripped and fell, very funny. Got Mcdicks after the concert, as is our ritual and then I went home. I couldn't fall asleep until almost 5 in the morning but I had a free energy drink from last night so I shot that back (or tried to, they gross me out!) before my exam this afternoon. And now here I am.<br />I guess I really am boring since that wasn't much of an update at all...<br />Oh well....<br />Tired and burnt out now, so I'm gettin into bed.<br />xoxo"

"event","Two extremely late nights this weekend, and I'm *so* exhausted. On Friday I got together with Ron and he went and dripped off a CD at a bassists house and then we went to CD Plus, then off to pick up Hillary and went to Gerard's.&nbsp; Hill brought my thing of Mango Malibu Rum, which has lasted for three completely drunk nights so far and there's still like a quarter of it left! Shit I'm cheap. Hahaha. I made myself a really gross drink of fizzy lemonade and Mango Malibu Rum, and drank that as quick as I could. Then Gerard made me, what I think is a ""brown cow"" (Kahluha and milk??) which tasted like chocolate milk so I drank that up quite quick haha then we went to Taco Bell for..well taco's. Well Gerard, Ron and I went. Ron drove Gerard's standard car and now he misses his Camaro even more!&nbsp;
went back to Gerard's place with a shit load of Taco Bell food and we all just chilled. It was me, Ron, Hillary, Gerard, Adam, Laura, Derek, Teri and Beth.&nbsp; Eventually Ron and I made our way home at about 3:30. Well thats when I got home anyway :P
It was alot of fun...when Gerard gets his own place, it's gonna be so PRO. PARTAY every weekend! Hahahahahaha.&nbsp;

Then last night Ron invited me to this guys place Dave Jansen cuz he was having a little get-together. Tristan, Ted, Jayme, me and Ron went (Ron DD'ed AGAIN! in his parents van hehehe) and Tristan, Ted and Jayme got really drunk. But I stayed sober because 1) I drank alot the night before and 2) I felt bad that Ron was DDing again &amp; thought it'd be nice if he wasn't the only sober person haha. So we had fun, quite a few people showed up I suppose. Some that I kind of knew and some that I didn't. We ordered pizza at around 1:30 and left at like 2:30 and drove the three of them back to Tristan &amp; Jayme's place. I got home at about four hahaha and slept until almost 1pm!!! I am still *so* tired. I managed to read quite a bit of Dracula today...I need to finish Dracula and Trilby by the end of the week so I can work on my big paper. I also need to do my Philo paper which is due on the same day.
Gawd, I can't wait until this damn shit (school) is over with for the year!!

Other than that nothing much else to report. I had a pretty fun weekend, twas good and crazy/busy. Today I managed to relax abit which was nice.&nbsp;

"event","So I quit Ipsos. Partially involuntarily. I mean my parents really wanted me to not work downtown and then when I got stranded at Portage Place then again at Polo Park and sweetheart-Ron came and picked me up.&nbsp; The hours were too late and too stressful and scary to get home from downtown at about 11ish at night. So I quit and instead of working last night I went and played pool with Ron (he taught me!) then we drove around and ate McFlurry's.&nbsp;

Life is never not confusing...

Today Hillary and I went and dropped of like a gazillion resumes. We were out for about 3 hours! We walked from the grace to portage and alldown portage and down cavalier to catch the bus. We saw Ammie at AOV and applied/talked to her for a while and then went on our merry way. Tomorrow we're dropping off more after my class.&nbsp; This morning tho it really pissed me off cuz my grama called and kinda was bitching at me for ""hiding away"" at work. Meaning that she doesnt think I should work as a telemarketer. Like fuck whatever its a job, I'm so tired of people bitching at me for working at telemarketing places. I'm comfortable with it, I generally like it, and the last one only sucked because they were fucking me around. I just wish people would lay off about it. But I applied at a bunch of restaurants today and other stores and things so hopefully I'll get something more interactive. I realllllllllllllllllly want to be a waitress.&nbsp;

Other than that nothing much is going on. Got TOOOONSSSS of homework to do tonight and yet it is wing night. Although getting wings tonight would probably defeat the purpose of my three hour walk today hahaha.&nbsp; Caught up with Ammie today at AOV (LMAO) and we're probably gonna hang out soon. Maybe tonight. Who knows whats goin on!
Tomorrow Gerard is having a bunch of people over as a get together so Ron and I might go to that, and I really wanna go see The Hills Have Eyes this weekend, maybe saturday. Other than that, I'll probably do all my homework and try to get caught up for class next week.

Ah well, I'll call him on my break today and see how he is.

New job today and I dont know if I'm looking forward to it or not. I'm looking forward to money and lots of it that's for sure. But maybe it wont be that bad, at least I know its more professional than my last one. Stupid Zealous...

Other than that I'm just trying to balance a shitload of studying and homework, dropping off more resumes, having a social life and figuring things out about stuff. Nothing is ever light lol.

Front and centre for Dark Tranquility, Devil Driver (boo), and OPETH!! FUCK YAAAA BITCHES!!!

Soo nuts. The rest of my weekend isn't something I really want to talk about haha. But yesturday...oh wow yesturday. We got there really early (Ron, Adrien and I) and we walked down the wrong side of Smith St. for like 20 minutes and then figured we were going the wrong way and followed a band of metalheads in the other direction and finally found the Ramada Confrence Centre. It was so saweet! Tristan met up with us a little while before the concert started. Just as we got to the doors to get our tickets ripped Adrien happened to notice he didn't have his ticket anymore. We were like FAAACK NO! Tristan ended up being Santa Clause and sold Adrien his ticket. Tristan was going to leave the concert early anyway cuz he had to be up at 5:30 am for work and stuff, so Tristan went home and Ron Adrien and I went in. We went into the stage area and noticed we had a complete bee-line way to the front where the gate thing was to hold us crazy metal heads back hahaa. I ended up standing next to this really nice short girl with her boyfriend and she took shit loads of pics with her awesome digital camera and Ron gave her his email address and hopefully she'll send them to us!&nbsp; I was really excited. So for Dark Tranquility I got right up to the FRONT! OH MY GOD! Ron ended up standing behind me for half of Dark Tranquility and Devil Driver to hold off the crazies. He put his arms on either side of me and held onto the railing. It was so sweet of him - I would have been crushed. Then Opeth...oh my love Opeth! I was RIGHT AT THE FRONT!! THE STAGE WAS LIKE 3 FEET AWAY!! FACK!! I cant get over that. Ron ended up descreetly shoving some guy out of his spot and was standing next to me, and I had Adrien right behind me. It was the most amazing concert ever. Even with me passing out. lmao! I got crushed so bad against the rail and I'm so short it caught me in the lungs and I had to get pulled out and I passed out from hyperventalating. Hahaha, but its okay I got to stand like right next to the stage in a SAWEET spot afterwards, with no crazy sweaty bodies pressed against me. I'm glad I passed out! It was funny too cuz when I came around the paramedic was saying ""I need to check your ribs for bruising"" and I was still right out of it so I said ""okay..okay"" and hes like ""can I lift up your shirt?"" and I was like ""why do you wanna lift up my shirt?"" and he was like ""I need to check your ribs."" and he repeated himself cuz I asked again, and then I said ""give me backstage passes and of course you can lift up my shirt."" and they laughed and said ""well I think she's fine!"" ahaha. They gave me a lot of water though cuz I was so dehydrated I stopped sweating. Normally its Ron that gets that sick, figures I would pass out for my favoritest band EVERRRRR. I still got to see like the whole thing though and they did like a 2 hour set. it was fucking intense. Most amazing concert ever!
Afterwards we were all hungry &amp; decided to go mcdonalds but the one on portage/whytwold was closed for maintence so we went to the one in charleswood on moray because Adrien lived down there, and that one was closed too! We were so pissed and Ron drove all the way back to Cavalier and they were open and he bought us all McDonalds. It was great to feel that sick! Awesomest night ever. Adrien and Ron were so sweet to take as good care of me as they could, considering Ron fended off all these assholes that kept trying to get into my spot. Anyway..soooo good. It was SO sold out! I was so happy and they said they would come back. Dark Tranquility and Opeth fuckin rule!!!

Other than that I skipped English today because I am so tired and shit that I came home and kind of slept this afternoon and now I'm doing notes and waiting for my dad to come home. Tomorrow I start work, 4-10pm, god damnit. Its just for now though until I find something closer! I'm getting trained tomorrow though so hopefully I'll get off a bit early. What a busy week, Tues I gotta go to the bank to get my shit for direct deposit and then I work 4-10pm, Wed I have class from 9:30-3:45 but have to leave at 3 because I need to be at work for 3:30 until 10pm again and then fackin Thurs I gotta work 4-11pm! Its insane! It better not be like that next week cuz I cant handle that. We get to pick our own shifts though after the training process so Im gonna work Tues and Thurs cuz I dont have class and then Sat cuz its only 11am-6pm which leaves my night completely free. Hopefully this job will be less stressful then I think it is. I just think I'm not gonna be used to such long hours/days especially going from 9:30am to 10pm and then an hour to get home. YIKES. Good money tho. woo 8.75 an hour!

Other than that I gotta bust ass this month to get caught up cuz finals are next month and I have 2 HUGE papers due on the 27th of March and I'm very behind. Which probably means I should stop updating my damn LJ and go finish my Anthro notes. Heh!

During my three hour spare I went and inquired about a gym pass and apparently if I get it after March 15thish, I get it for 35 bucks. BOO YA. I should have a job by then too anyway, so yayness.&nbsp; I also went and did a bit of shopping then hung out with Kait and Lins and then rushed to get to class where my psycho English Prof got in a fight with a psycho English classmate. Its this really crazy looking 80's girl who wears see through shirts and ripped pantyhose and undermines the Prof all the time. The prof obviously doesnt like her and she walked in late and started asking the prof a bunch of shit and interuppting her, thus causing a fight and she stormed out. It was rather amusing and I'm glad I showed up. I also got a C on the paper that I knew shit-all about. Woo go bullshiting. Dad picked me up from Sev cuz I missed my bus as per usual because it is timed so awful...and then I went home and did nothing.
Hahaha. at about 8ish Hillary and I went with Dave, Tim and Pedro to Montana's for wings which were SO good, and then to Movado's (boo-urns) for pool. Dave bought Hill and I a drink each, which was really nice! Then we all went home :)
Twas nice to see old friends again!

Tomorrow I gotta go drop off some resumes and then study! Midterms coming up and I'm so behind! EEEEEEEKKKK!

"event","<p>My weekend got better...Yay!! Ron and I had a nice relaxing movie night last night (Three Kings &amp; Phonebooth). It was funny because Linsey called me to go to the bar, and Tim called me to go chill at his place&nbsp;- yet I already had plans. Where were all the phone calls Friday guys? GAWD! Just kidding. I had a nice time just relaxin with my Ronnie :)&nbsp; Its been such a stressful week it was great to just chill out and do nothin and not have to worry about anything. I went to bed at about 2:30 after I read for a bit and got up at 11...on the dot. It was Carazy! Today I made myself some French Toast and then Ron and I went and did a lil running around. He took me to pay my phone bill and to walmart&nbsp;- which has NO good clothing. But I got face wash finally. It was super nice of him to take me to do all that stuff, as soon as I get my license..I'm gonna drive him EVERYWHERE! He also bought the King Kong game and owed me a hug cuz I told him it'd be there ahahha. I rule.<br />Sooo I went home and read and then watched The Man With No Face (or whatever its called) But then I had a headache and did nothing but lie there with my eyes closed. I need to make an appointment with an eye doctor. I don't think its anything serious, or anything to worry about, but my eyes randomly become unfocused and they always hurt.&nbsp; Maybe I just need some advice to stop eating such and such or stop spending too much time on the laptop. But just in case...might as well make an appointment.<br />So my goal this week (by Sunday) is to get a new job. Since I am completely unemployed and feel like a god damn bum. I will drop off like 20 resumes a day. As long as I get hired by the end of the week I don't give a shit where I work.<br />I also need to go pick up some jeans tomorrow.<br /><br />So besides my weekend getting better (partially thanks to Ron &lt;3) there's nothing much to report. Doing Dracula in English this week, which should hopefully stop me from wanting to skip out on the class. School is done in like 2 months, and I can't hardly wait.<br /><br />Well nerdyness has overtaken me and I shall go read until Grey's Anatomy is on :: nerd snort ::.<br />Ya, I'm cool.<br /><br />xoox</p>"

"event","This week progressively got a million times worse. Not only did I not have shifts this week because work SUCKS ASS, but I also quit. Jessica called my cell yesturday morning and told me if I wanted my paycheck I had to go all the way to the north end to pick it up. I was fuming. Thank god my dad was home or else I wouldn't have gotten my check! Plus she was super rude to me on the phone. So my dad drove me all the way there and the whole way he kept telling me to quit. I hate quitting jobs without having another one especially right now with my situation (bills and such) but I have been so stressed out I haven't been sleeping and they are fucking me over. So I told her I quit, she was pretty rude. But whatever, I'm so done with that place - I just gotta bust ass to find another job!
I didn't go to class on Friday, my dad let me play hookie haha. And after the whole ordeal with getting my paycheck, I went with Ron and Tristan to pick up Tristans new car (which is actually really cool), and then they all went to a party and I stayed home. Ron (drunk Ron) called me about ten times last night, he was super drunk. So I tried calling him 10 minutes ago, but his mom said he's still sleeping. I hope he's feeling okay.&nbsp;
Gawd this whole week sucks. I feel like such a loser. Everyone is going to Gimli today (Hillary, Gerard, Nat, etc.) But I didn't get invited so I'm not going. Surprise Surprise with the no invite.&nbsp; I'm super bored and restless and upset right now I just wish I could go back to sleep or go do something.
I woke up this morning (afternoon? haha) and my parents gave me this big talk about my weight and everything and my dad gave me 60 bucks to go get new jeans and stuff, and gave me ""incentive"" to lose weight, but all it pretty much did was make me feel even shittier about myself then I did before. I obviously need to lose weight, and I want to get my gym pass, but my mom started nagging at me and my dad was talking to me like I was five, and my whole week just got THAT much worse. I can't wait until it's over.
I hope Ron can do something tonight....he always makes me feel better.

Other than my week sucking ass so bad, nothing much is new."

"event","<p>So I didn't go and hang out with Kait and Gerard on Saturday, I ended up going to Rons for the afternoon and had supper there, then Tristan called wanting to know if we wanted to go see King Kong. Even though Ron and I were super sick we wanted to see the movie so we went and brought Marco. We went with Tristan, Jayme, Ted, Jonny and of course Marco, Ron and I. We were worried we weren't going to get tickets because when they called for the seating of King Kong the really busy game and concession stand area all flooded to the doors to be seated...and we were the only ones (Marco, Ron and I) that were there! We got tickets though and even managed to find some good seats. I have to say, about King Kong, it was the best 3 hour movie I have ever seen. It was amazing. SOOO good. I'm gonna buy it as soon as it comes out. I kept blaming my tears on my cold though, which Ron thought was funny. We hung around and played some games for a while (well they did) then we drove Marco home, and I eventually ended up at home, passing out in my bed.&nbsp;<br />My cold was even worse the next day (Sunday) and I sounded like shit. I didn't want to eat anything cuz my stomach was super upset, but I was really hungry. Anyway, tried to go to bed early, but I didn't fall asleep for hours and was really restless. Great start to my impending doom of the new week.<br />Yesturday I got up late so I was rushing around so I could go get Kaitlynn, and I was cutting a bagel and ended up slicing my thumb realllllly deep. It didn't hurt at first until I looked at it and saw lots of blood running down my arm. My dad couldn't even see how deep it was cuz it couldn't stop bleeding so we washed it off and put like 20 bandaids on. He debated taking me to the hospital, but we decided I would go to school and if it didn't stop bleeding to come home.<br />Well my fackin thumb hurt ALL morning and kept bleeding (not gushing, but quite a bit) and I managed to see how deep it was and YIKES, I got grossed out and had de ja vu about Rons poor finger. So I decided I would go home and see what my dad had to say about it. But I went to drop off my English paper to my prof and she said she had to talk to me (uh oh) and she told me that she had overheard me saying to a girl in the class that I hated the class and didn't like how it was being taught. I had a good save however and said I had been talking about my other English class and that I really do like hers and blah blah blah asskissasskissasskiss. Anyway, now she likes me, which I guess is a plus, but I hate her class...ugh!!<br />Went home and showed my dad my finger and he was really debating taking me to the hospital. He couldnt really tell if they would have to give me stitches or if I would just get a fancy bandaid. He came to the conclusion that a bandaid would fix it, so we didnt go to the hospital.&nbsp;I ended up tripping over some god damn toys of my brothers and went headlong into my dresser and scrapped up my shoulder of the opposite hand that my cut thumb is on, and then i said FUCK IT and layed in bed the rest of the afternoon.<br />I went out at about 4pm with poor sickly Ron (&lt;3) because he had to pick up an AUTOGRAPHED WAH PEDAL BY ZAKK WYLDE (!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) at second encore. Soooo we got that, and then went and photocopied some borrowed books for his school (which he started yesturday) and then did a little bit of walmart errands for school supplies ( I LOVE school supplies). Eventually went back home with starbucks and read for the night.<br />Dreaded going to work today cuz my throat is still sore, but I needed the money. So what happens when I get to work? Ms. Lorusso asks ""oh didn't jessica call you?"" uh..no she sure fuckin didnt!!!!! APPARENTLY there is NO work this week. WELL FUCK YOU WORK!!! ITS A STUPID GAME ANYWAY!!!<br />I'm really pissed.<br />So my goal is to drop off 10000000000000000000000000000000 resumes on Thursday since&nbsp;I&nbsp;have no fackin shift!<br />Other than that my day was okay. I napped and read and now I'm gonna go shower...typing kills my thumb.<br />What a fackin week. (and its only tuesday.)</p>"

"event","My ""Reading Week"" has been a blur of doing nothing. Lol. And sickness. I am so stuffed up right now, figures I would get it on my only week off. I don't remember what I did Wednesday, but I know Thursday I didn't go to work and Ron didn't work either so he came over for a wee bit then we went out for lunch with Tristan while he was on his break from work, then once he got off we went over to his place (and Ted came as well) and I watched them play video games. Then Jonny came by to fix Tristans computer, to no avail. Then Jayme got off school. We left at around 6ish or something, and I went home for a while. Went back out with Ron at about 8:30 or something. Had a good night,&nbsp; just doin some...driving around. Hahaha. Today however I did NOTHING until almost 11pm. I mean NOTHING. I layed in bed rotting my head out with this god damn cable we got and dinked around in bed. I was so lethargic. After some horrible indecision I went to Gerards with Kaitlynn and we watched Seven and then did a Chicken Run to Sev at like 2am and drove around until almost 3am...and now here I am.&nbsp;
It was a fun night, I had a pretty good time. Haven't hung out with Laura and Derek since the time that Ron had them over cuz Derek was fixin' up Rons new computer and everything. Tomorrow night I think Gerard, Kait and I are gonna chill again, depending on where though. Since my parents FREAK everytime I try to have someone (or someones) over, I dunno where we can hang out. I want my own place!&nbsp;

Not much else to talk about...I need to do some studying and my English paper tomorrow and Sunday - it's my goal. Which I could have achieved the entire week that I had off, but no one ever wants to do work that they hate on their holidays. It defeats the purpose of holidays!
....doesn't it?"

"event","I had such a nice Valentine's!! It's my first one ever hehe. Yesturday at work Ron called me at around 12:30 and asked me what time I get off work for lunch and I said 1:00, and he met me at Slices, the pizza place downstairs from my work at 1:00 and split a pizza with me! My favorite kind (pinapple), and he bought me a can of Iced Tea! He's so sweet, it was sooooo sweet of him to come visit me at work, let alone buy me a pizza and a drink! Both my bosses were being dinks yesturday and it sure brightened up my day to have him come pop in for half an hour! He got off work early and fixed his truck, so last night we went for a drive and I gave him his spongebob and lintdor chocolates I had got him, plus the ""massage giftcard"" I had dorkily made him, but he seemed to think it was funny, so I'm glad! We drove around for a bit listening to tunage and then I went home.

I didn't do a full day of work today, I left at around 12:30...I was having intense jaw pains. So I came home and watched a movie (Cold Mountain! Now I can watch chick flicks with my new cable!) and ate supper, made myself look decent, fought with my dad, then Ron came over with Saw1 and Saw2. We only ended up watching Saw2 though, good thing, since Ron was pretty tired. As am I, but I refuse to go to bed as I have no school or work tomorrow! For Valentine's Day he bought me spongebob candy (Eeee!) those ""conversation hearts"" which I love cuz they're the soury type ones, not the powdery ones, he got me a huge bag of cinammon hearts (my FAVORITE) a big hershey kisses chocolate and a chocolate heart sucker thinger. So sweet of him. I had a great night just relaxing and watching Saw2, which is like, just as good second time around! Ron left at aboot 10ish and now here I am! I don't have work or school tomorrow so I'm gonna stay up reading and watching CABLE!! and hopefully sleep in until noon then work on some Anthro! I'm gonna probably do my english paper tomorrow too, since it's due next monday. Yeah that miiiiiiiight be a good idear.

All in all, this week off is turning out just awesome, and it's only Tuesday! I have 3 more days left PLUS the weekend!

"event","<P>Wow was Friday ever INSANE. I am so glad I went, I had a blast!&nbsp; Gerard went and picked us (Ron and I) up at like 7:30ish, and we went and got Flying Pizza, dropped off Gerard's car at Gerard's house and walked to Hillarys (which I am very proud of myself for cuz I was wearing those crazy black boots I have). We went there and immediately started pre-gaming and eating pizza haha. 2 drinks later, as usual, I was pretty warm in the face and had a little trouble getting my barings as I stood up. What can I say? I'm cheap and that's the way I like it! Had another drink I think before we left and then Hillary's mom drove us to the Juiceboxx. Ron and I were pretty drunk, and Gerard was getting there, Hillary on the other hand was just waiting to do *other* things at the bar. When we got there we met up with Kaitlynn and Chris Richot whom I haven't seen since the night I ran into him at Foody Goody with Ron. Went and got more drinks for Ron and I to sustain our drunkness, and chilled with everyone, eventually drifted off from everyone and found a fouton ;). Then went and got more drinks and found everyone again. We had a blast, I got so drunk, and techno music sounded pretty damn good when I was drunk! I think Chris and Kaitlynn left at around 2ish or something and we stayed until 4am. It was nuts. Ron got super drunk so I got him alot of water and took care of him...then shook my ass for him on the dancefloor lmao, which he seemed to like! What else...Megan and Hillary are dating now...(Cassell, not Yunk) and I think Gerard found some guy. Everyone had a great time. I'm so glad too, I didn't want anyone to have a shitty time, considering it was 10 bucks to get in and it normally isn't mine and Rons scene. Booze makes everything cool though, haha. We left around 4, and Ron started passing out in the van, probably from booze and exhaustion. I went to bed at around 5am and got up at like 12:30pm. I was fackin exhausted though!!</P>
<P>I relaxed yesturday and then Ron and I went and rented all of the Scary Movies and watched them at his place - it his insanely comfortable bed. I was passing out by the third movie though and ended up going home at about 1ish...or 1:30ish and passed out until noon. Went to the Millenium Library again today! Although I didn't get anything..and went to some computer stores and to wash Rons truck. Heeeheee. I had chicken fingers for supper (home made!) I was so happy, its like my favoooorite meal ever. </P>
<P>Tuesday is Valentines Day! And this week is spring break! I work Monday, Tues and Thursday, so hopefully I'll be able to get my gym pass next paycheck! I wouldn't mind being able to get a pair of pants that aren't ripped however. Or...new clothes in general. <BR>Anyway what a killer weekend!<BR>Awesome!!!</P>

"event","<P><FONT color=#ff9900>If all goes as planned this Friday should be....interesting....to say the least. I mean Hillary invited me, and I invited Ron, and then Gerard got invited along the way, who is invited Jenna or some girl I've never heard about, and possibly some other person, and then along with that Linsey might be coming who might be bringing Ryan and Brody (these friends of hers) and then on top of that Kaitlynn might want to come, although I'm not too sure she knows anyone who might want to go to this sort of event. <BR>But, I have made a plan to save some money! PREGAMING!<BR>(yes kaitlynn, I know we have bad pregaming experiences, but...) as long as Ron still has my Mango Malibu Rum from last Saturday, which I only drank like a quarter from, then I can be good and drunk before we even go there and I dont have to spend much money on booze at The Library, just enough to sustain my drunkness. And I know Ron has some beer left, so maybe we can all pregame and say the hell with the overpriced bastards at the bar!!!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff9900>I don't really know why I'm so pumped up to go to this bar on Friday, I mean its horridly expensive (alright only $10 to get in) but I am an ass about my money lately.&nbsp; I guess I just really wanna go to the bar lately, I don't go much, cuz I don't see the point in going like every other day and becoming a barstar. But I wouldn't mind going this weekend. I like to hang out at peoples places more so than go to the bar, just because to me the atmosphere is better (like hanging out at Tristan &amp; Jayme's, hanging out at Rons, etc.) but once and a while I like to go out and stuff. Besides I *do* get paid tomorrow, and I also find out tomorrow if I get to work a couple more days next week, which would be so nice. I like moneys.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff9900>Went to Rons house last night! And watched a movie in his great big comfy bed for the first time. Mmmmm it was heaven. I could, like, live in it (don't worry Ron I wont!) but it was so comfy and warm and the blankets eated us :P.&nbsp; We watched Radio, which I haven't seen in such a long time. What a cute movie...so sweet. Ron took me home a little after 11 I think, and I passed out right away. I haven't been going out much during the week so I have been going to bed early, which resulted in me being super tired last night/this morning.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff9900>So today I went and got Kaitlynn this morning, where we were both generally late for class haha. We didn't catch the bus until 9:15, and our class starts at 9:30. and then I went to Philosophy learned more about morals (it's all starting to make sense! ...6 months into the course...), called some places that I dropped resumes at and decided I was going home. I did a whole shitload of nothing this afternoon and I plan to keep it that way (unless I go out, cuz I'm bored). No homework tonight, and only work tomorrow. Yay, I get to relax!!!<BR>What is that again? O.o</FONT></P>

Bah.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff6666>I had a great weekend though! I went out for a midnight snack with Gerard on Friday night to Perkins where we split one of those platter things and I got eggs benedict. Onion rings and breakfast....mmmm my favorite. And then we drove around blasting Shinedown while Adam became a moody idiot on the phone with Gerard and hung up with him, and then I went home to bed. <BR>Saturday Hillary came over for most of the day and we just chilled and talked and relaxed and looked at old memorable surveys we did a year or two ago. At around supper time Hillary went home and Ron, with his amazing timing, called me a few minutes later and came and picked me up. We got dropped off at the liquor store where I got my usual Malibu Rum (mango) and then we walked to Shoppers to get some juice and Ron bought pizza pops. We then walked to Tristans (next door) to drink...although we were the only two drinking, it was awesome. We watched a star trek documentary called Trekkies, which put slightly drunk Ron in the mood to watch an episode, which I found highly amusing cuz it was about baseball with simulated fans. Hahaha it was actually really funny/good. Then they played some video games, got a little drunk and frisky, they played more video games, and at about midnight everyone started to pass out hahaha. Except me, cuz I for some reason was not tired at all.<BR>Ted took Ron and I to McDonalds and then home, where I crashed and slept until 10:30 on Sunday.<BR>Did more or less nothin until Ron asked me to go do some runnin' around with him, which was fun, then I came home and watched some TV and worked on some reading that is way overdue for my pointless, shitty English class.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff6666>My weekend was very nice and lowkey and I still got drunk! Next weekend however I hope it to be full of drunkness and funness, as it is Valentine Weekend. The Library (juiceboxx) is having a V-day rave, which on a normal occasion I wouldnt go to, but Im thinking it will be neat! and alot of my friends are going, so I think I may go and hopefully Ronnie will come with me, cuz that would make it so much better. We've even got a ride sorted out and everything, I just need to pick up tickets. Which are ten bucks a peice. Yikes, plus booze, double yikes with my small paycheck on Thursday. Ah well, I really hope to do something neato this weekend like go to this rave which I have never been to (only been to the bar on a dead night). And I would also like to make Ron a really nice supper and everything and maybe go see a movie. Funny how all of that requires money. BUGGER!</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff6666>Today was the most pointless day in existence, class wise anyway. Anthro was cancelled again, Philosophy was SO bunk, and English was a no go. I dont understand why people cant get a hold of us ahead of time if our classes our cancelled I mean it is *so* out of my way to come down there for almost no classes. It was facked. But I did go to Portage Place with Kaitlynn and then Ron picked me up at the music store across the street from my work and I went to the computer store with him. It was sweet of him to pick me up! Plus he got a pizza for us to split. Mmmmm! </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff6666>I wanted to go skating tonight cuz it is *so* nice out, but I have this philosophy paper I am procrastinating on..I really doubt I could do it all tomorrow night, all though, you never know. I am a good bullshiter, since thats all stupid University has taught me.</FONT></P>

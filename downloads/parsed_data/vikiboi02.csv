Can i pls tell u all something.. yesterday when i was walking home after dance practice.. there was this boi.. with long hair and he was holding his sisters' hands. he kept starting at me from afar.. and when we got nearer...he pointed at me.. and laughed and said ""gummoh gummoh"" (fat in malay).. and he laughed and repeatedly said that.. and the sister with him actually was laughing.. I was so pissed.. I never starred so badly and angrily at anyone but i just stared at the boi.. if it was the secondary school mano i can just imagine myself holding to him or at least shouting at him..the boi got scared and ran off.. when i walked a few steps.. I felt so irritated that i actually walked back towards the boy and told (ok la actually kind of shouted) at the sister.. you better teach ur brother some manners and maybe u shld learn some too.. and walked off..

I am bloody pissed even thinking abt it now.. When i walked back to shout at the sister..the thought that came ringing in my mind ""What has society come to?"" ""wat is wrong with this people?""
I am sure the parents must have pointed at fat ppl and teased them or made them an object of ridicule that the brother has the cheek to say that to a passer-by and the highly annoying sister can actually laugh at it.. Parents sub consciously pass such thoughts to their kids and look wat happens.. Its ok if its me.. cos i always believed fat is beautiful can u imagine if it was another person who was really struggling with weight issues.. that person could have been so hurt and had such low self esteem.. its so irritating.. society's perception have to change.. but with the future generation like this... the future only seems to bleak..

"event","Hi..haha I know I havent updated for damn long and i got good reasons for it..

That day I went to Di's house for a party.. of cos as expected it was cool.. met up with frens and took a lot of glam shots.hahah but of cos.. my happiness was shortlived

I already was very sick..sneezing and my eyes kept tearing and tearing for nothing..when i went back home felt so sleepy and went to sleep.. And i woke up at ard 7 and i couldnt stand by myself.. felt so giddy and naseous.. ran to the toilet and vommitted.. i vommitted and vommitted and mind u i NEVER vomitted in my entire life.. i am serious.. in fact i went to the toilet and didnt know where to vomit ok.. it was really my 1st time.. When i came up i nearly fell and my mum had to grab to me.. I was so bloody weak pls..

I felt very cold as well and my mum dragged me to the clinic.. I tell u there were this 2 nurses who were damn irritating and actually said i look funny wearing that weird mask..HELLO ITS NOT AS IF I WEAR A MASK EVERYDAY AND I AM BLOODY SICK.. I was so giddy and felt like i just wanted to sleep.. i kept shaking my legs, rolling my eyes, and just whining and whining abt how this old lady went into the doc's room and never came back.. I really thought she died in the room..and then after that lady came out (surprisingly alive) there was this skinny sneaky man.. who just tip toed and opened the doc's door like a mouse and went it.. and I waited and waited and waited.. he took sooo bloody long to come and it wasnt even his no... the doc did not change any no after the old lady came out.. it was so long and i asked my mum to tell the nurse that i feel very very giddy and i need to go see the doc urgently.. the nurse pointed at me LAUGHED AT MY MASK and said she cannot do anything abt it.. and she passed me some warm water(which by the way i didnt ask for).. I was in half the mind to use my acting skills and just pretend to faint..idiots u know..HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH.. and at last i went to see the doc.. and then it only got worst..

This doc is such a loser..I had a fever of 39.5 degrees and i listed all my problems.. and he just nodded and nodded and nodded without any reaction.. if i had said i had AIDS and were abt to die i think he would just nod and nod and nod..loser.. and then he wanted me to lie on the bed cos he wanna check my tummy and i said i got no stomachache..and he said no he just wanna check and i said again.. ya i got no pain there.. he didnt bother asking abt my vomitting, fever or giddiness and all he cared abt was checking my stomach.. sooo loser! AND HE GAVE ME AN INJECTION.. and i said oops i dun like injections and even b4 he poked me.. i was giving reactions which he found weird..and my mum literally pushed my neck to the other side and he gave me the jab.. OUCH!.. again i walked out and immediately rushed home to sleep asking my mum to collect the medicine..

I have been so bloody sick i never ate anything except milo.. to the extent that now i am ok.. i cannot eat alot.. in fact i cannot even eat three quarters of wat i can eat..and my dad was smiling the whole day cos he said my stomach has shrunk and now i can only eat lesser and i dun have to go for this stupid operation he wanted to send me to where they would tie up my stomach or something (I hate hearing my parents using such scientific terms and sometimes i dun even know such things exist but they use it anyway cos they know i am an arts students!)..

I really cannot eat much now.. SOOOO IRRITATING.. btw the whole world seems to have found a job or at least trying to find except me! I am such a lazy (glamourous as well) person.. haha 

Aiyah dun know la.. have been going for dance practices with the ICS.. so am bloody tired! thats all.. pics will be posted soon but now i am bloody tired!"

Now that A levels is over (ok la almost over other than the highly disturbing deeply twisted and greatly terrorizing subliminal Gothic paper) .. as expected my life has lost its direction purpose and meaning.. I am like this lost ugly ducking swimming in the sea trying to find its way out!!

Haha and of cos.. as much as i am trying to not think abt it.. Sometimes i think and even dream of how my army life going to be (wat life..its pathetic 5 days which i choose to call an orientation camp in which half the time i would be sitting in an aircon room???)..

Just saw the movie army daze.. its bloody hilarious.. Now i know wat i will miss being in this stupid PES E.. I also wanna be painted green and hide from the enemies (and stupid hornets) in the bushes,trees and grasses..I also wanna do P.T. every morning and cheat in pushups (eg. doing 10 pushups instead of 50 when the teacher/instructor is looking away)... I also wanna go kayaking, swimming, hiking, cooking, and all the cool things <b> THAT I AM DENIED </b>.. 

Btw i also wan a fun group of army ppl to keep me accompany.. pls dun give me some geeky group who would say ""technically speaking, according to the (insert some physics rule) the instructor is not making sense..I wonder how we are going to do this""....PLSSSSSSSSS that would be torture chamber.. If that happens i will just go to the nearby hornet's nest poke it and invite all the hornets to sting me till i die!!

Furthermore, army is weird.. but pls everyone pray that my bloody mouth keeps shut and my bloody voice miraclously become softer and I dun get into the nerves of the sergents..haha 

hahahaha.. lets just hope karma wont be a bitch this time and forgive me for watever sins (including bullying, shouting, calling names, bitching, laughing at or even disrepecting ppl) would be forgiven.."

Hello first of all u r not following the fat people's guide to fashion !! Fat ppl dun wear horizontally stripped shirts.. HELLO.. u make even glam fat ppl like me look bad !!. and the worst he was dressed in mjc's flag colours..white and blue.. and this is wat i saw ok?

Hahah there was this poor boy this another invigilator just put the econs paper 2 on the boy's table in this awkward position..and of cos any rationale str8 thinking boi would turn the paper str8 facing him.. and that is exactly wat the boi did... and then came the FASHION FAILURE.. he pointed at the boi and said ""Put down the paper NOW!"" for heaven's sake he was talking as if the boi just carried a bomb and was abt to throw at that idiot's face (well that shld be the punishment for the fashion failure for being a fashion failure).. GET A LIFE...

He walked up and down left and right middle side and centre..he was so annoying! And this boi got irritated and said ok i wont touch the paper ok.. look i dun touch the table ..and started touching all over the table..it may not sound funny now but it was so funny then..haha and the fashion failure, turned and looked at the boy like how Mr. Penguin will look at Batman and it doesnt help that Fashion Failure looks like a penguin that flew to the wrong continent!

Other invigilators are nice though..

"event","I know it has been ages since i actually updated this..but now i shall..

Of cos..i shall choose to blog about the G.P. Paper..haha like cmon everyone i know is talking abt gp..and if i dun i will seem like the odd one out..

I have told u before..this blog is a whining partner for me..someone who will accept my whining but will not reply..so if u think u can be demoralized by wat i say..PLEASE..AND I MEAN <b>PLEASE </b> stop reading now..

G.P. was weird..I have to say that paper 1 was normal..I was so worried it might turn out to be a difficult and challenging paper like the 2005 one..but it was ok..i was actually relieved..but wait..the worst is yet to come..

I dun know why (and i mean it..i really dun know why in the world) i had to choose a question abt women's discrimination..firstly, I am NOT EVEN A WOMEN..and secondly i feel that women are always asking for too much of rights more than even wat men are having..but still i had to go and choose the essay..

And miss haslinda (my gp tutor) has pointed out about how i need to be more inspired in my writing..and i tell u.. i was writing my essay as if the next minute i was just cry and stop writing the paper becos i am overly sad abt the state of women..haha.. i really was.. the marker could very well think the person writing that essay was a girl.. so funny!!

I mean one of the reasons why i chose the question is maybe becos..firstly i read abt the different types of discrimination and also becos i am a vivid fan of oprah and actually quoted oprah here and there..so its ok..and i still remember my first sentence : <em> As Oprah's saying goes ""Education is a form of liberalization"" </em> and my last sentence <em> Whilst there are many hurdles that women have to cross to achieve same rights as men, I am only glad to announce that 1 day they will! </em> .. COME on i got to wake up the idea u know..and after i wrote the last sentence i felt like this huge hypocrite..haha

But.. i still feel so insecure that no one i know has chosen this question.. I mean.. I know i wont do very well but at least good enough to get my aim (B4)..but i still feel very insecure..i talked abt right to be educated right to be employed right to be financially stable and etc. so maybe could have gone out of point.. aiyah dun know la..dun care

Anyway one is done...thats how i see it!"

Unlike the many other maths tests I did, I actually studied for today's mock maths paper..let me recount to u wat happened;

I actually came in to the lecture theatre u know, feeling prepared and trying to psyche myself, telling myself i can handle the paper, but lo and behold, I forgot I had to some other <b>PEOPLE</b> to handle as well..well miss ng was nice enuf la at least to give out a photograph and cards and then this tai tai actually announced all students who are not in proper uni to come down.

Haha the funny thing was i think at least a quarter (I am sure the no. was more) actually came down.. I went to tai tai and she asked me why I wore slippers. And unlike the other ppl, i told the truth that i was late and that I wore slippers in the rush and then, trying very very very extremely hard to be polite, tai tai actually said ""Pls leave""... haha and then the ppl behind me got enlightened.. suddenly as if some blister virus is in lose, everyone had blisters, and some people had perfect feet with NO SCRATCHES, told tai tai they had blisters and this loser actually said ""Oh ok, u can go, next""..So loser..

then tai tai asked me to go and see the GODFATHER.. the bold (bald to be more specific)GODFATHER..
Again I told him the truth. And he said the same words ""Pls leave"" (I mean is it the mantra of the day?). And again, I wanted to be studious and asked him to give me the paper (if it was any other time in the term, I would have skipped out of the lecture theatre, showing off my latest dance moves, ok maybe not the moves,happily...but cos its near A levels I had to be like that), and he bend down, and said ""NUPE""...shaking his head left and right.. And the reflection of the light from his bald head nearly blinded me (ok this is an exaggeration but i cant help it OK?).. and i saw my unshaved self there...

HELLO..I didnt carry my yellow bag (the glam one I am sure my frens noticed that),my paper bag and my blue canvas bag (that puts the army camp bags to shame) and all my maths notes and brain for nothing u know.. and though I was wearing my uni, they sent me out .. YES PEOPLE THEY <b> SENT... ME... OFF</b>.. that was worst than olinda leaving sgpore idol, the model leaving ANTM and even the scout leaving SURVIVOR.. I WAS SHATTERED..(ok not really).. 

I went down and whined and whined and whined to andi and van tan min han..hahah.. at least they were nice...

And even Miss Ng was nice.. and one of my fav maths teachers (Mdm Neo) gave me that puppy dog face as if i just did a striptease in front of the whole LT. like i did something that is never and would never be accepted by society.. so guilty uknow..

BUT the slipper was glam, black slipper with yellow strips, symbolic of the hornet that came to attack me in class..haha

Ok this blogging is a form of catharsis..hahaha (speaking of catharsis, Miss K was very goodlooking and nice today!)

OK Bye.. (sory for the abrupt ending..nowadays this blog space is only for me to go thru the emotional purgatory process).."

"event","Haha Hi everyone!!..

I had another weird experience today as well! At the same macs, when I was trying to decipher what the heck shakespeare was trying to do in king lear today, suddenly i saw from the corner of my eye that something blue was standing near me for some time!

So I naturally looked up and saw this boy. And the thing is he looked like how I used to look like when I was around his age (around 4??) the same dark complexion, deepset eyes, curly hair, and the pot belly that stuck out of his shirt (oh and the blue thing was his subaru tshirt)... and he just stared at me.. Hahaha quite weird

So i just signalled to him using my hand wat? Then I smiled at him, he smiled at me and stared at me back! Then he moved to look at something around my seat.. I looked at my seat and saw nothing and looked at hime again, and asked wat (in tamil).. and he stood there looking at me.. and then..

SUDDENLY, he leaped to the floor,REALLY.. all of a sudden he just jumped to the floor bending down to look at something underneath my seat. I was taken aback and so were the people near me! and again, he turned up to look at me from below like how a puppy dog looks.. and he pointed at something from underneath .. I tried to look down and then he pulled out this grey macs balloon out! I laughed and he asked if it was mine and I said no he could have it.. he smiled at me! And walked off looking as if the balloon was really going to fly up to the sky carrying him along!

I wonder if i did such things when I was yng???

OF COS NOT.. I was a <b>GLAM</b> kid ok !!"

Haha sori for not updating so much.. am just soooo lethargic and weird and loserfied!

And I have not been <b>STUDYING</b>.

If i go on like this I am dead.. I am so scared now.... can someone slap me and tell me to study!..

Well school and I are slowly drifting away.. its like school doesnt exist anymore.. weird..

And i have this weirdo who i badly need to blog abt..

This guy lives near the macs I always study in.. he is ... hmm.. not like everyone, i should say..
He needs attention especially from the girls.. everytime i study he is there.. and he just goes ard, getting close to the girls by starring at them, and those girls get intimidated by him and run away!

That day he attempted to play hide-and-seek with the girls in that goofy way and ended up chasing the poor primary school girls around macs and caused them to disappear!

Another day he cut his hair and went around putting his face on the glass window and scaring the girls on the other side of the window..

Another day he bought a can of sprite, came into the macs, drank up the whole can, and then went to another group of boys and made some noise or muffling that sounded like ""U drank up my sprite, give me back!"" , pointing to the guys. I mean I SAW HIM DRINKING u know.. then he went out, just showed his arm and ppl actually gave him money.. and using the money he bought another can and actually went to the boys and gave that ""na nanny poo poo"" look! The ppl gave him money becos, when u see him its obvious that he is not like us.. i mean I think he has some deficiency or down syndrome..

At first i felt sad, but sooner or later I was getting annoyed cos he really disturbed the girls.. that day he came so close to karthi, and this loser karthi did not even know he came near her until I told her! And another day he actually like peeped down the chair, like looking under another innocent girl's skirt u see.. I am sure thats not his intention, but I mean thats wat the girl will think right..

I told my dad and he told me that I shouldnt get annoyed with him cos he is not the same! It only shows how I lack compassion if i get angry with him.. and I agree cos he doesnt know wat he is doing..and sometimes his actions are childish..

The other day two girls actually didnt freak out but instead made flowers using paper and gave it to him.. and he was taken aback..and I tell u i could see from his face.. he was taken aback! He just stared at the flower and then at the girls and then at the flower again!..

But 1 thing i couldnt forgive him for was that he actually came near me that day.. and he turned to look at the girl sitting at the seat that was opposite me and actually scratched his butt, revealing his butt and red undies to me!!!!

I mean he really doesnt know what he is doing!"

"event","It has been nearly two months since I've updated this journal and I might come to now embrace something I hated for so long.  Exposure to strangers made me feel so vulnerable when in the end I was my own worst enemy.  Now with little to lose I feel I have an obligation to keep in touch with those who might benefit from my experiences, or more importantly, offer their wisdom from theirs...

There has been much to happen and the uber-couple may be no more.  To blame anyone would be as useful as it was when tried in private.  This will not become a forum to rebuke any ill will that may result.  Without a doubt I made mistakes and fell for my weakness, the result may being the loss of the love of my life.  Maybe circumstance felt the time wasn't right or there is a higher purpose not yet known.  The details are only important to Josh and I and we both now the truth and the pure heart it beats from.  I LOVE YOU.

With that said I leave with this: 

Do not pray for your own needs, for your prayer will not be accepted.
But when you want to pray, do so for the heaviness of the Head.  
For whatever you lack, the Divine Presence also lacks."

"event","So I fell off the face of the earth and I took Josh with me!  Its been so long I really don't know where to start, but here I go-

Let me start off by saying how lucky I am to have a man in my life like Josh.  Not only is he my best friend and confidant, he is my home.  My heart resides in him allowing me a reason to smile in the morning.  He's been uprooted and thrown into a situation very few would endure.  He endures for one reason- he loves me.  To try to tell you how much I love him would be like a Jew saying the word God, just plain blasphemous, so I won't try (you know baby and that's what matters).  Somedays it is so hard to look into those eyes and know how painful and lonely it must be to be away from his friends.  I worry I cannot repay him enough for the sacrafices he makes to be with me, but I will try.  I was a military brat and just picking up and leaving is not hard for me and I forget that others are not the same.  He would hate me saying this, and I almost feel generic in doing so, but Josh is the bravest, most compassionate, just outright strong man I know.  Never do I want to chip away at a spirit that gives so much to the world.  Fact is I love him more than ever and I am still enamered with the man.  He is my husband and I am pround to be able to say those words.  I told him once the only reason I feel beautiful is that a man like him loves me and thinks so.  OK for those haters out there who might suspect an unhealthy dependance on someone I am here to say you are right.  Love in its nature can be scary.  Anytime you are open up and reveal your vulnerabilities you risk a part of your soul.  I'm just not going to deny I have them and pretend they do not exist.  The fact I am vulnerable makes the love all the more real.  My life would never be the same if he left me and there is no shame in that fact.  I love you Josh...

So one time there was this room mate who said he saw me in bed with a guy(Josh) and then wrote a statement againt my evil gay ass, but first he couldn't resist my fabulous taste so he asked me to take his wife out shopping.  Then!  My boyfriend and I realized we were going to have to move into that box under the overpass we where looking at- not alot of room, but quaint (THanksgiving at our place!)  That was just yesterday.  Good times.  Who knew we could be a Whitney Houston song.  Hmmm, there's an idea for our wedding...

To address the, Ike and Tina moment as I heard it called, it was a low point that opened up some problems our love sick eyes needed to see.  My low point was when I threw a box of cinnimon toast crunch from the jeep.  I told him I must really love him to waste a whole box of my favorite cereal.  He said,""But you threw it!""  Hey, he looked hungry.  OK, maybe not funny to joke about but it was what it was and we have moved on and fixed some of the problems...

Saw Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind- Great flick although my similarities to the Kate Winslet character were to close for comfort.  I kept hearing Josh snicker...

Josh bought a book of us book.  It ended up in the garbage lol!  There are some things that shouldn't be told...

Thats about it.  There's a chemical cloud in Atlanta today heading this way so I'm going to go

Never a dull moment"

"event","I'm back and I could be called away at any second again so bare with me!

I just read a comment from an unidentified reader about the possibilities the army may not let me go, especially in a time of war.  It is a hard fact I may have to face, but I am hopeful it will be an easy transition out.  If not I am prepared for the consequences and hardship of what I have to do.  My life can only be lived once.  Someone like Josh only comes once in a lifetime.  I will not let some general or Bush tell me how to live my life anymore.  The contract was signed by me and I understood the possiblities.  Signing the firsat time was not a mistake, it eventually taught me valuable lessons, appreciate life more and brought me to Josh.  But my reenlistment was an act of fear and lonliness and I will not endure four more years when the mistake can be corrected... enough about that situation.

Josh and I are rarely apart and I fall deeper in love each day.  Our wedding, which seems to be front page news, will no doubt be a much discussed, carefully observed event.  I hate to think there are people out there who will hope it fails, but they exist and I gladly diappoint our dissenters.

Lost my phone the other day.  After almost a day of searching at my parents house where Josh and I were staying I looked towards heaven for help and amen I knew exactly where it was.  It lay in the attic where the night before I was showing Josh pics and old toys.  Well I don't need to tell you the romantic ambience attics have, so eventually one thing led to another and we were having sex while my dad studied for a test and the family went about their business below.  

Does anyone else want to slap J Lo's mom for thanking God for her win of the lottery?  I'm sure God thought that- now there's a family who needs a break!  Proof Godd has nothing to do with lottery wins or game victories, so stop thanking him!  By the way, God it would be great if we wona little somethin, somethin.  I swear I'll go to church!

My friends from Germany came.  They are great and so much fun.  Beanie was telling me she loves Fellinni's pizza because you can order what you want as topping.  I had to tell her that was every pizza place.  In Germany you take what they give apparently.  I stayed away from their pizza while there so I'll take her word.  She has a bro named Felix who wants to be the next Eminem.  I walked away for two seconds in the mall, next thing I know he's buying some bling-bling for his neck.  A giant fake silver and diamands NY Yankees madallian on a chain.  I need to teach him the word Jacked.

Beanie was thrilled to here I fell in love and that Josh and me were taking the plunge.  Coming from her meant so much.  Her spirit is so strong and truly glows.

There is so much more, somethings on a darker note.  But today I will stay in the light....

""I love you Josh.  I do believe I invented you when I was four.  It took a while, but I finally found you."""

Thankfully I stopped while I was ahead although it was fun, just know I'd be messing with it all the time.  Knowing me I probaly will go back and do it.  Hey Josh, is there a place for me in the government?  Supreme Chancellor of Fabulous.  Hmmm, that was a gay thing to say.  I mean Secretary of the Department of Naked Atheletics.  Butcher?  Ah, who cares.  But I think the currency should be Cheez-Its with imprints of the new nations icons like...me!  Kidding.

So there I was minding my business, taking a brisk jog around the golf course when I see a dog with some golfers.  They were about 100 feet away and my MP part of my brain kicked in and I wondered why that dog wasn't on a leash?  That thought quickly turned to why is that dog running towards me? Why is it growling and why the hell isn't anyone calling it back.  I think fast.  Maybe I should stop and slap my hands together like on that show I saw.  But that was a cheetah wasn't it?  No, istead this genius makes a dash for it and found the dog loved my shoes sinking its teeth into my new balance.  No penetration and I suddenly had a great I idea for a commercial...

Actually although it was long it was great working with a large diverse group of people, all looking to me to learn something (and have a good time :)  I had to teach the Dekalb county sheriff's office how to do color guard ceremonies.  They were a trip and who knows what they thought of me, as usual I mix business with fun.  They seemed to appreciate the fact and joined in acting crazy.  In the end we got the job done and they looked sharp.

Brandon posted a comment and it meant a lot to me.  He was extending his support to Josh and I and really was cool about the whole situation.  I'm glad that cooler heads seem to have prevailed.  This could have turned into a worse situation and our relationship could have been given a rougher road.  I'm especially happy for Josh's sake.  His sensitivity level is great and it hurts him to make anyone feel other than happy.  It feels right and I think Brandon will be a close friend of both of ours and you can never have enough, though I feel blessed withthe ones I have.  Brandon helped put to rest my fears of possible difficulties.  Can't say how happy I am.

Talked to Josh while on break at work, said he might be coming down with something.  I just wanted to fly over the mountains to him and make him some soup and make him get some rest.  Maybe get him one of those annoying bells just like in a sitcom.  He said he was going to paint and I imagined what emotions might feel the canvas.  Being with a creative person is incredible and so productive.  There is always something to discuss, or laugh about, or plan.  There is nothing holding us back and, shit, I can't get enough of the boy and can't stop talking about him.  I should go to my room and blast Beyonce's Crazy In Love, but they over played that damn song and it just makes me plain crazy.

Today I had lunch with SSG D. and discussed my plans for probaly outing myself so I could be discharged and focus on my future and to be honest-Josh.  Many won't see this as wise which is good for them.  Maybe its not practical on a pure logical/rationale sense, but where has two demension thinking got anyone.  It's the visionaries, the poets, the dreamers that change the world and live a life worth living.  I told Josh not to feel pressured if I made that choice.  Listen to me acting like I'm not going to lol!  Because when I do it will benefit me no matter the outcome, although I know the plan...

Now I put it out there.  Now I make myself vulnerable.  Everyone watches Romeo and Juliet and cries, wishing for a love that strong.  They believe it could happen- love at first sight.  It has happened to me.  That week opened up heaven to me, he has become my salvation.  He is the one.  Yes, maybe you found a marble and think I lost it, but I am ready for this and will work at it no matter what.  I feel Josh is going to be my husband, the one I grow old with but never tired.  Even after our looks fade, his eyes will shine all the brighter and I will have been the luckiest man to have lived with the greatest love.  I am lucky.  God, I can't believe I wrote that!!!  But if this was journal stuck under my mattress at night I would express the same thoughts so there it is and I feel empowered.  You would think I would feel vulnerable, thinking ""look dumbass what you wrote for all the world to see!""  Well look world because I want them to see and I'm not afraid because I feel so human, like I am what the divine plan had intended.  Anyone saying being gay is wrong has never kissed Josh or walked through the park with the sweet fruit of conversation enticing your ears.  They have never the euphoria that makes you think your heart will burst any minute.  Ok, I need to stop ha ha.  

I told my Mom Josh was twenty and she was like as long as he's 18 I don't care.  My dumbass told her originally he was 22 because I didn't want to deal with her drama, but I hate lying and I want to keep things pure b/w Josh and I.  Josh was happy.

If I have to watch another Viagra or female viagra commercial again I'm going to puke.  Have you seen these things?  That old couple on the beach given each other the goggly eyes.  Common people!  I don't mind, but keep your lifestyle to yourself.  

My room needs cleaning, I need to run and I need to dance around my room.  Finally I found my northern star and I know where I'm going.       

I'm one happy SOB."

She is awesome, a die hard auburn fan, thought the house was going to collapse when I watched a game with her.  I was being butch no dought that night.  Anyways, she invited me out with some friends.  I thought it would do me could since I had Josh on the brain and I just needed to relax.  So I met them at Joes and had fun.  I told her all about Josh and she asked if I was sleeping with Joey cuz my jeep was outside her apartment last week.  Talk bout insulting.  I told her no and how me and Josh went to Kevin and Ambers and the park.  If only she knew what Jake was up to. I found out Jake told his friends we were German princes!  I told them the only relation to royalty was the fact my parent produced two queens  lol!  My bro has ISSUES.  Back to the story.  So then we met Neil at Blakes and his friend said he would take me back to my jeep.  Being the typical gay guy he asked if I wanted to go to his place.  I told him I had a boyfriend and was very much in love.  This must of sounded foreign cuz he just didn't get it, so I went into the ""mode"".  I told him how much monogamy met to me, that my gift was Josh always knew my kisses, my body, my soul belonged to him.  It was only for him and we had trust.  He asked why did I go out then.  This is so weird to me.  Can't people have friends and not have sex?  I guess many don't think so.  As I talked he had this envious look in his eyes, like he yearned for the same thing.  I saw this in Amber's eyes.  How lucky am I to have what I have in Josh.  The world would be so much better if everyone could feel true love.  We said goodbye and I felt so strong and wanted Josh to be waiting in my room.  I knew how much he meant to me, that Josh has made me the best man I can be.  Thats the last time I accept a ride from someone I don't know directly.  So here I am at my neighbors computer.  He's talking on the phone to some girl he met on the internet.  I hope it goes well...

Oh yeah, I saw one of my bro exs tonight.  He went up to me and started talking shit about him.  I asked him to stop, what was b/w them had nothing to me.  Then he said my ex has been calling him.  He really pushed my buttons.  I told him to stop, just have fun.  He didn't, so I told him to get away and he ran off pissed.  He called my house drunk and my mom answered.  My bro called me and I told him what was up and he appreciated it.  I don't appreciate his activities though and me seeming to get involved without trying. DRAMA!

Well I miss Josh so I need to sleep.  Tomorrow I have to train some state troopers for their color guard.  I get to sleep in and I amgoin to find Josh in my dreams.  He is so pure and I am so lucky to have him.  I could never risk what we have.  Noone compares to him.  He is the one.  I have so much to give him.  Time to take my drunk ass to bed.  Josh, I'll see you there.  God, thank you for this great spirit, I won't disappoint him.  He is safe in my arms.  To bed I go knowing its official, I love him and will die loved...."

"event","Live Journal is so addictive and it's such a good release.  But I hate when people are not honest in their journals, a documentation of our lives and at least truthful.  I remember finding my room mates journal in Germany and reading an entry about us and he lied and made up what had happened.  We had become involved romantically (he was straight supposedly), a strange relationship and not my last with a straight guy.  Not only did he say nothing happened, but had me coming on to him.  These were suppose to be his private, inimate thoughts?  Lies?  Maybe it was a way to convince himself he wasn't partaking in the forbidden fruit.  None the less it hurt.

So I suppose I should not become what I hate.  I think I've avoided putting down some of my fears because who might read it and what they'll think.  Well fuck it.  Those who love me will love no matter what.  So here I go-

Jeolousy can be romantic in a way, a way of knowing the extent of your feelinf for someone, but it can get ugly unchecked.  My jeolousy should be flattering, I trust Josh.  He is honest and truthful, but I fear what could happen if I'm not there mentally.  I read some of Brandon's Journal.  He spent the day and night with Josh and Shawna.  I respect this so much.  I'm friends with all my ex's and it has allowed for some great friendships.  But Brandon seems to love Josh and I wonder if he'll pursue it further.  Brandon can be there when I can't and I hate it and I'm scared to death.  There was an entry about an IM at Tracy's where Josh said he didn't want it to end.  This might be out of context and it was definately before I told Josh I wanted to be with him- make it ""official"" as my brother says.  In my heart I know I worry for nothing and I keep it there, but I just needed to get it out.  Tracy last night talked to me a little bout me and Josh, said she was happy for me and thinks its great, but I kept most of my thoughts in because I like my relationships to be b/w the one I'm with and myself.  Outsiders have a way of, well, being just too far out.  I'm being selfish though.  This must be hard on Josh and I need him feel free and let him handle his heart and complicated situation.  We are together and that is more then enough.  I do trust him and I am patient.  He'll do the right thing.  Still, my uniform is camoflaged and I fear it makes me invisible.  I can't wait to take it off for good.  Soon enough.  THAT FELT GOOD.  Needed that off my chest."

Today- Marshall Hall, Home of Forses Command.  Very important and very political.  Nights and weekends here are great, free wielding.  So of course I had plenty of time to think, a past time not encouraged by the army.

My book has been killing me, my characters screaming for death.  It really is time to put them to rest.  Behind my confident veneer I have fears.  But at the moment I feel fearless and should ride the wave.  When writing the damn thing it was hard on me.  My protagnist is clearly me, his demons mine.  Our worlds are both haunted by the same ghosts.  The book was cheap therapy, watching Quentin self destruct prevented my own implosion.  Without that book I would never have made it.  I owe those character my life, so I guess in the end I really could care less how the book is received.  Yeah, that was me kind of lying.  It would be great to find success and an audience for them, but its not important in the end.  A writer writes because he has to.  Artists are lost without their craft as I would be...Can I call myself an artist?  John's dad would say I could when it brought in a check.  So I say I am an artist becuase I haven't sold out, but I'd love to if you know any publishers out there...

I saw a clip from the Designing Women and remembered how much I loved that show as a kid.  Damn, you could see the gay a mile away.  Mama Family and Golden Girls, favs.  Then when twelve, the only twelve-year-old in america I suspect, I was enthralled with Twin Peaks.  David Lynch had sucha profound effect on my vision, Balditini music so haunting and intruding with a vampires charm.  Later it would be Blake and the Romantics I would find my literary heart.  Conrad, the joy of complexity and symbolism.  Heart of Darkness is so layered and brilliant...  What the hell am I rambling about?  How did I go from Designing Women to Conrad?  LOL  I wish my mind had come with a manual.  Nah, this is more fun.

I know it gets tiring to my friends but I think about Josh a lot and hope he's fine when we're not together... He's a survivor and will be fine without my help, but I hope he knows its there...I know he does.  Every sond and movie, everything reminds me of him.  Dumbest connection?  There isn't one cuz they make sense to me.  But there are funny ones- barn dancers for one and babies.  Anyways.  Work is winding down and I'm off in a couple hours.  I need to run and go to the gym.  Don't know bout the gym, but its a great day to run and think about tomorrow."

Checked my email and there was a poem from Josh.  I've written so many poems for people, a poem slut I suppose because I love them and I toss them around, but never got one.  It felt like I did not inspire them like they did me.  Turns out the inspired feeling was just lonliness being distracted for a while.  Once it got wind of what was up I felt just as lonely.  Denis, my ex who I met in Germany, was the worse waking moment.  I had this tattoo on my shoulder with his name, dreams I could not speak aloud and nothing in common but a bed we shared on occassion.  There was so much missing and I almost lost who I wasa to him.  I never was lonlier then when I was with him.  I do love him and we have our moments I will cherish, but I can't live there in those moments forever.  He knew he had me, that I had to go to Germany, so he went back to his cold, uncaring self.  Calling only to keep me on my leash.  

Well Denis I woke up on March 13th.  I opened my eyes and I saw his face and knew what had been missing.  Loneliness left and made way for apprehension, an easier foe.  I can say love and it is filled with definition.  I have broken the hollow love.

Finally exhaustion set in and crashed around 0215 when my body finally yelled dumbass go to sleep.  It was the same body that decided my alarm clock was not going to get us to work on time either.  So I started the day off right with being late and made it better by reading Josh's journal.  I could hear the pain in his words and I want to be there for him.  There were things written that probaly have nothing to do with me, but made me wonder if they did.  I never want to tell him whats good for him or how to live his life.  He's to unique to try to steer in any direction.  Thats why when you find the person, that soulmate it just works.  Things flow like a river, the Tao man its all bout the fucking tao...

My bro doesn't have this, keeping men in all of his pockets and having me keep up his lies.  I'm tired of it and I wonder what the hell he's moving towards.  No longer am I going to play the intermarry for him and his toys.  Does he realize what he's doing?  Or is he just damaged by the heartache of an earlier time?  Who knows but I need to try to understand because I want him happy...

Meanwhile my hate for the military grows or at least my need to seperate.  My parents would be so disappointed and I don't know if I could go home for a while.  My Dad especially, he would be the most disappointed.  They don't realize the impact their opinion has...

Where are all my friends?  Busy with their lives and my stays stagnate through contractual hell (of my own signing).

Here at work I beg for discovery,maybe someonemonitoring the computer will read this and report me.  Finally the army could exponge themselves of my ""diseased"" self and I could go support Josh in the ways he needs.  Give this my all and a fair shot.

On a lighter note, I really want to learn to line dance.  I'm going to drop the suggestion to Josh and see if he wants to mosey on down to lessons.

Only two hours of sleep in two days and the Marshall hall floor beckons.  I'm taking my army ass to sleep on the comforting mildew till a general wakes my soon to be demoted ass lol  An Army of One?  No shit!!!"

"event","I just got off a 12 hour plus shift and I can finally sit and reflect.  No people, no distractions.  The last week has been an accumulation of all the things people love and hate about me.  My effect on others scares me and I wonder what good I do sometimes.  But when I sit back and all I can do is smile I know all is right in the world.

An amazing man was gifted to me by, well I guess it depends on what eyes you look at the world.  Call it divine intervention, fate, destiny, so many things came together to make this union possible between Josh and I.  He asks me contantly why I like him so much.  Anyone who has met this man knows he is unlike any creature, a spirit to feed off of without any worldly needs.  He makes me laugh, feel loved, he... You knoe in the movie As Good As It Gets when Helen Hunt asks Nicholson for a real compliment and he replied, ""You make me want to be a better man.""  That's Josh, only more!  He makes me feel like the man I always hoped I could be.  I feel I have all I need.

Today I thought alot about my life in the army, how its not for me and how I reenlisted for the wrong reasons, the wrong man.  The army makes me a one note joke and ultimately a lie.  Josh is worth what I think I will do.  While it is partially for him, to be with someone I have bonded with in ways I only share with him.  Watch us you'll pick up.  But overall, it is to free my soul and move on.  Move on in life and with him.  I think staying in the army would be too much for him.  You need someone there when times get rough and I would die if I couldn't be there for him when it mattered.  Right now it kills me I can't get in my car and see him because of work.  I love this man and I feel no need to explain why...I just fear losing him from the army!!!

I already turned down an early report date to my new unit so I can stay until NOV 30th, but I think I won't make that date.  I love Joshe too much and I'm ready to be free....

ooooo!!!!  I arrested someone today!  Cool!  But I felt bad because he was going to school.

Hmmm, thats it for now and it should be more but damn I'm tired and need to unwind"

"event","For those of you who know me you know what you're getting into.  As for the rest of you, its going to be a bumpy ride so fasten your seatbelts...

Today is the final day in a week that was never suppose to happen and not just to me, but to anyone.  The kind of week I have had only happens in soaps or the used paperback bin of an unfullfilled housewife.  But here I am to tell you it can happen.  Can I get an Amen?  Amen!!!  It feels scary, wreakless, dangerous and against the advice of those living behind picket fences with the SUVs parked in the garage.  Against the words of those just trying to make it and live the American dream.  Well, I'm not them and I never will be.  I'll never worry about a stock crash or the creditors calling.  A week ago I was reborn as an even stronger dreamer when I received the best birthday present- Josh.  Yes!  It was a week ago and yes I am the one and same Jason you might have read on his live journal.  What has happened between Him and I seems to explosive to keep contained, yet so intimate the details are for us to treasure.  For those of you who do not understand, disapprove or have dropped jaws in time you will see.  All I have to do is look in his eyes and all is clear and I can see where I am going.  For those of you who cannot or chose not to I'll send you a postcard from happiness and wish you were here...

Thank You Josh.  I've been wanting to scream this to the world, but the virtual one carries better: Josh, I LOVE YOU!!!"

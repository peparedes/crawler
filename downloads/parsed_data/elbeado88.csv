"event","Hello, LJ Folks. This blog is coming straight to you from the Whitcomb Computer Lab located at Hiram College in scenic Hiram, OH.
This will be the last blog I create from Hiram, OH.
Folks, I believe I have made a huge life decision. It's not final, but I think it will be soon. 
I am putting this here as opposed to Facebook because I do not want certain people (roommate, or just people at Hiram) to read this before my decision is final. I don't necessarily need reassurance in my decision, but most people who know me very well (i.e. YOU GUYS) know I have a great aversion to both decision making and change. Which is why this is a huge, huge deal.
I believe I am going to transfer.
I have been completely unhappy with my life at Hiram College since the day it began.
I have not made a best friend, or any ""real"" friends for that matter.
Sure, I have very friendly acquaintances.
But you know what?
I could walk away from this place tomorrow and never, ever look back. And not be overwhelmingly sad, either.
And that's just not the way I want to feel about my school. 
I love school. I love learning. That's why I want to be a teacher. But I have absolutely no attachment to Hiram. As a matter of fact, I don't particularly like Hiram. I would not recommend Hiram.
I am slightly happier at Hiram this year, but it is not for a good reason. The reason is mostly because I have a car and I can escape. Seriously. I'm happier this year because I can get the hell out of here. Not a good way to feel. 
This place is in the freaking MIDDLE OF NOWHERE. Rural like you could not even imagine. I have to drive 25 minutes if I want Taco Bell, alright? I have no idea why in the world I ever thought I would be happy here when I love my conveniences at home so much.
Hiram is for some people. In fact, Hiram is for the vast majority of the 1100 students that attend Hiram. Most of them love it. I feel no ties and no attachment. I want to love where I go and have pride in it. I want to feel like the school I go to is my home and not want to leave there every second of every day.
Frankly, it comes down to happiness. I am not happy here. As a matter of fact, I have been miserable nearly every second I have been at Hiram in my time here. I didn't tell anyone really, but my considerations of transferring started back in March. I applied to other schools back then but decided to give Hiram another chance. It was the wrong choice. 
So where will I end up? I'm leaning heavily towards Kent. If anyone doesn't know, my college decision my senior year came down to Hiram or Kent. Once again, I chose wrong. However, I'm also looking into BW, which would be obviously closer to the small school feel I'm used to, although the small school feel is part of my turnoff to Hiram, I suppose.
I know I have more to say on this issue. Maybe comments can prompt some of what I know I want to get out? Yes well, comments appreciated."

"event","INSTRUCTIONS:
write twelve things,
intended to different people.
never tell which one is to who.

some really obvious. some not so much.


1. i'm sorry you feel we have nothing in common anymore. i'm also sorry you feel it's all my fault. it's not. we both have contributed, both by changing and neglecting to change. you are still someone i love so much and i want to be friends with you forever, but we just need to accept each other as we are.

2. you are still one of the best people to be around. you're so kind, and i wish i hung out with you more. we had our fun times. then we grew apart. (naturally?) you're just fun. i don't give you enough credit.

3. i don't know who i'd be without you and your comic relief. you've kept me from going insane many times. i'd love to go to school w/ you next year, sadly there are other factors =( you are a true friend and i'm glad i know you as well as i do.

4. i miss you. insanely. you're truly the most fun person i have ever met. i love how we can not talk for months and then get together and be BFF again. i just wish there wasn't those periods of months in which we dont talk. hope you're having fun w/ the nuns!

5. i hate how you've changed. you think you're some ghandi-like wonderful human being. you're not. you ditch people who have stuck by you for years because of your own petty little problems. please stop being so fake. i can't stand it.

6. i'm sorry things turned out the way they did, seriously. i still think you are very fun and talented. but your head is too big. you think you're everything. you're not. i really can't deal w/ someone so cocky. it's okay to feel like you're doing well at something, but please realize you are not god's gift to the world. maybe some day things will work out.

7. sometimes i'm a bitch to you. sometimes you annoy me soo bad. but yet, you are my best friend in the entire world. i've never met anyone so genuine and caring. you've been there for me ALWAYS. never once did i have a problem that you wouldnt listen to. im forever thankful for who you are, who you always were, and who im sure you always will be.

8. frankly, i don't care about you anymore. you're the one who's isolated yourself from everyone, and yet you want to turn it around on all of us and say its our faults?? im sorry,no. you're the one who wants to be off in your own little world, never showing up to things people are nice enough to plan and invite you to. your problem at this point, not mine.

9. i wish you didnt always revert back to your old ways. i thought you changed. you really havent. i thought you would have so much more pride for yourself. you dont. please give yourself a chance. you're so much more than you let yourself be.

10. you're an inspiration to me. im sure you dont realize it. its not like we talk all that much. but you are. you did something i'd never be able to do. you overcame your fears and went for your dream. YOU'RE AWESOME.

11. why are you the way you are? you've truly ruined my life. everything i had going for me was torn down by you. i dont get it. you have so many problems you wont own up to. you're going to lead a sad life if you dont change. notice how we ALL left you?? everywhere was better than being w/ you. i hate you for the things you've done. it's all out of spite.

12. i'll always be there. i miss you. i love you. theres so much to say. im sad that all this stuff in my life happened and i cant be there with you. you're always my best friend. always. from babies to adults. my applesauce buddy."

"event","i did not go to school/the pep rally today. but im almost alright w/ that. cuz last night i got to do something much cooler.
i went to see MOVIN' OUT last night which is a ""musical"" i guess, except its all billy joel music. if you do not know who billy joel is you are either a. a big loser b. not my friend c. not my brother, sister, or anyone else who has my parents for parents or d. not a past or present student of mr saban. anyway, it was AWESOME. it was the best thing ive ever seen in my entire life!!!! it was soooooooo good. and we got really lucky, cuz you know how for a broadway show theres the people who do it on broadway and then theres the traveling group? well the lead vocalist on broadway, michael cavanaugh, just happens to be from middleburg heights and decided to take a leave from broadway so he could come here and do the show!! so we got the broadway voice w/o even being on broadway!! and as a side note, this guy also happens to be a member of my church and he came there to sing. being sick, i missed it. grr. but anyway, back to the show. so i got there and i figured the show was gonna be like, the guy sings a billy joel song, and then theres a scene w/ dialogue and whatnot, and then theres another song that leads into the next scene, etc. it was definitely NOT like that!! there was no dialogue at all, which at first i was worried about. but the lyrics and the dancing told the story good enough!! everything went along perfectly. the story was soooo good too. it was about how theres this group of friends: Brenda and Eddie (who are the prom king and queen but they break up), James and Judy (who are gonna get married), and Tony (who gets together w/ Brenda). well the guys get drafted to vietnam (scene: The Sky Falls. music: We Didn't Start the Fire, and it was such a cool version of it!!). while in vietnam, James gets killed, and Eddie and Tony get to come home. They're both really messed up when they come back. Tony keeps pushing Brenda away because he cant deal w/ everything thats happened. Eddie blames himself for James' death and starts using drugs. Then Eddie has this nightmare where he is back in Vietnam, and he is being led through the dream by Judy. Goodnight Saigon was playing, and the scene went sooo amazing w/ the music. At the part where its like ""We would all go down together"" Eddie reaches the part in the dream where James dies and Eddie just falls down next to him. Then in the end of the song all the other people fighting get shot at and fall over. it was such a good scene. Eddie sees Judy in the park the next day and kind of asks for her forgiveness, and when he receives it he ""attains grace"" (good music medley goes here). in the end they all reunite, tony and brenda get back together, etc. And then if you were smart enough to not get up and leave michael cavanaugh sang ""Cleveland State of Mind"" (new york state of mind). but these dancers were AMAZING. i couldnt believe it. my fave dancer was Eddie, and the weird thing is is that he was literally the understudy for the understudy for Eddie!! he was the best one though. i cant believe there were people better than him. he did a pirouette and got around SEVEN times. i counted. and the girl who played brenda looked like a brunette erika rylow, and she was in the ensemble on broadway. 
so me and my mom went to like 5 stores looking for the soundtrack of course. what losers we are. 
i feel better. i think my dad might let me go to sarah's party for a couple hours."

1. human beings suck.
2. $90 a month is not worth it to be sick all the time.
3. printers officially suck also.
ok, so we all know about my getting out of the driveway problems, correct?? well, we've reached a new plateau here. 
i was backing out today, trying to get to katie moss's house, and i was also trying to stay off the neighbor's grass for once. well, i guess i started going on MY grass instead and ended up w/ my left front wheel on my treelawn in a foot of snow...STUCK. i couldnt get out!! i was officially stuck in the snow. i did what i thought i should do, which is call my dad to help me, stay in the car, and turn my hazard lights or w/e they're called on. people suck. i was out there for a half hour, and a hundred cars musta gone by. and NO ONE stopped to help me or even ask if i needed help. and there were people who lived on my street who were just going home, not even going anywhere, who wouldnt stop and help me. there was one, single, solitary person who offered and that was zack starkey. i dont even know him but i know he goes to our school and i also know its ridiculous that adults call kids disrespectful when 99 cars w/ adults in them went by, and the one car that stopped had a kid in it. i told him he didnt need to help since my dad was coming though. a neighbor saw me about 20 minutes after that and helped me out. it just took some creative turning of the wheel on my part, and some wiggling of the car on his part. right after i got out my dad came, and he drove me to katies on account of i really am sick of driving after all of my fiascos (fiascoes? nah, fiascos. hmm...i dunno, help me out!). then i got this wave of sickness and found myself over the toilet nearly puking, so for the second week in a row i couldnt go to dance. i was gonna go to jazz, but i just didnt feel up to it. so then i go to finish my english project, and my ink wont work in my computer!!! its coming out weird, i cant explain it, but i hope if my mom writes a note mrs gausman will give me a little extension because its really not my fault and im gonna have to have my stepdad come this weekend to fix it for me. so im not in a great mood."

"event","not only do i like billy joel AND know that the 43rd word of ""we didnt start the fire"" is EISENHOWER (or possibly vaccine, if u count H-Bomb as 2 words...) but i realized that i may just make the same stupid mistakes he does. and as this may be a stupid mistake, it was done completely sober, as was billy joel's. yes, i ran into my house w/ my car. call me brilliant. call me billy joel, as i said. call me what you will. but nonetheless, i have no mirror on my car and must pay $100 towards a new one. and no one ever tell my dad!! i wonder if they'll sell MY dirt on eBay...i would be honored. i think it makes it worse that it was MY house, considering i know my house is there. i thought i did, at least. but there was just this dead 'clunk' and my mirror went all over the place. THANKS SARAH ITS ALL UR FAULT UR ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IF I DIDNT HAVE TO PICK U UP THIS NEVER WOULD'VE HAPPENED!!!! just kidding. me and my mom laugh about it though, thank god. she calls me ""Miss HitTheHouse"". and ironically enough, at church the day i told her, our pastor was telling us this story about how he borrowed his friends car and backed it into a pole and how forgiving his friend was...so i could tell my dad about this and only have to pay $40, but i'd rather pay 100 and not have my dad watch me like a hawk every minute of the day. my mom thinks so too. plus she says this will teach me the responsibilities of having a car. but my mom thinks they can have it done same day, which is wednesday. w00t!!
i havent studied yet...all the things i DONT know for chem are on my cheat sheet...so to be quite honest theres not much to study. band-pointless. french-know it. its the english Fahrenheit 451 and vocab stuff, and all of Alg II that im gonna have a problem w/. history-im screwed!! im just not soaking up anything in that class. i take the notes, i do half the work (lol), but im totally not getting anything out of it. i wont until we get at least into WWI. i love mr white but for some reason im not taking anything out of his class. so im tres screwed on that midterm...
i wanna do that 'styles for shelley' thing as long as i get my car back by thursday. i just dont know what i'd get done. maybe i'd just get my whole head dyed. no clue. but i wanna do it cuz i feel really sorry for that girl. 
anyway, those were my updates for the day. hope they were tres enjoyable.

umm...do i need a monologue to try out for the play? and uhh...where do i get one??? sarah, natalee, anyone???
my life is freakin boring...there was something else i wanted to say in here, i know it...
ooh i wanna do beths movie thinger!!
The Movie Meme
1. Pick one dozen movies that are special to you.
2. Pick a few lines of dialogue.
3. As people guess the film, strike out that entry.
4. After the film is guessed, explain why that movie made the list
and since i cant do the cool little 'cut' thing or w/e the hell its called, since im computer-retarded and dont have the stuff for it, im gonna type it right here and u can scroll.
1. ""I sure love peas""
""Don't eat too many...you might turn into one.""
2. ""If you're from Africa, why are you white?""
3. ""Hi, I'm Tom!""
4. ""Everytime a bell rings an angel gets his wings.""
5. ""It's a farce."" (i dont know if its the exact line, but its the gist of it.)
6. ""Did you know the concorde gets you there in half the time?""
7. ""I broke the fast thingy!""
8. ""I have nipples, Greg. Could you milk me?""
9. ""It's a liger. It's basically my favorite animal.""
10. ""I wear women's underwear."" ""It's a thong!""
11. ""Mysterious shadowy figure...""
12. ""We need a witness to our lives. There's a billion people on the planet...I mean, what does any one life really mean? But in a marriage, you're promising to care about everything. The good things, the bad things, the terrible things, the mundane things...all of it, all of the time, every day. You're saying 'Your life will not go unnoticed because I will notice it. Your life will not go un-witnessed because I will be your witness'.""

GOOD LUCK!! most are really easy i know...but im excited that i finally wrote an entry AND came up w/ 12 movies i could think of lines to. so please comment back and guess!!"

last thurs. was my b-day...i got a car!!! w00t. 
so umm...brandon and lauren are going out!!! hahahahaha. just makes me wanna shit myself. they dont know anything about each other!! literally!!! they dont even have each others numbers!!! come on, everyone has brandons number, i swear!! if lauren knew half of how brandon was, she wouldnt go near him. even her friends say so. he only asked her out cuz he thinks shes 'hott' or whatever, and she probably only said yes so as not to hurt his feelings. but i guess they were both at the swim meet and she wouldnt say a word to him! not even hi! and when he tried to hug her she pushed him away! all i gotta say is he made his choice...and thank god it wasnt me cuz lauren is in for a bit of time in hell w/ him. she'll probably be scared to break up w/ him if she wants to, cuz what if the psycho starts cutting himself again? oh but wait, she doesnt know about that cuz she doesnt know anything about him!!! im sorry, but it pisses me off that he couldnt go out w/ me, but he can go out w/ a freshman he doesnt know!!! argh."

"event","so yesterday was the OSU field trip. there were a lot of farm animals along the way, including sheep w/ green paint on them or something. green x's. of course there was drama, when isnt there drama? brandon threw all his words around at everyone, not taking a breath to even say something nice to anyone. hes joking, but he just overdoes it and it pisses me off. omg!!! hoopy is sooooo annoying!!! i seriously wanted to kill him the whole time!!! he was just driving me crazy! i couldnt stand him yesterday. the bus was sooo dead. on the way there when brandon was sitting in the back he was sleeping, and megan was like, ""this bus sucks and its all brandons fault."" so then on the way home, hoopy's sitting by erika (hmm...) so brandon goes all the way up front so we're all mad again, cuz now its really dead in the back. so we had to make our own fun while everyone else was sleeping on the way there, and watching ghostbusters on the way back. on the way there, they handed out gummi bears in this big bag, and we were all scared to reach in there cuz we didnt know where everyones hands had been. which got us on a conversation about this girl w/ 13 cats that doesnt shave or something, and i found out that im 'not worthy of a normal conversation'. also, it seems to be a general consensus that a. im the smallest person in the band and b. many people hate me, and that ones because 100% of the people voting agreed w/ that. the people voting: hoopy and brandon. megan says 'you can so tell he likes you.' and im just like 'holy shit, wouldnt that be grand?' it would be if he wasnt always a jerk. the concert was pretty good, the best part was the beatles medley. miss fenton (im sorry, i dont know her new name) was probably going nuts w/ my horrible singing of these beatles songs. we ate at this mall place that had absolutely no mcdonalds or burger king or anything like that in their food court. and no subway. but what the hell, they had Le Petit Bistro. umm, yeah, cuz i really need french fast food. the ride home i listened to a lot of music, and i got called a banshee a lot. and we kept yelling out to Row 6 and Row 4. lol. cuz of kristens secret haha. sorry, i didnt mean to laugh!! so i got home, went right to work and heard that scott peterson was guilty!!! yay!!! haha you asshole i hope you die!!! you deserve it! you killed someone you were supposed to love forever and you killed an innocent little baby in the process!!! i hope you burn in hell.
:D
so now im gonna go clean my room and then im off to my dads house for the rest of the weekend!"

B.say something to me once in awhile.(if this happens, its never anything nice). C.when i tell him im sorry for things i said, he just hugs me and doesnt say anything about the shit he said. D.deny that hes doing this all because of 'the note' and i cant try to talk to him about it cuz then im just being retarded about things, he hasnt done anything wrong, what am i talking about i shouldnt have wrote the note, and then he either A. turns around and talks to other people (what else is new?) or B. stomps off.

i got 5th chair in wind ensemble!!! not gonna lie, i wanted 4th, but its becca in front of me so thats fine w/ me!!! if it was someone else i'd probably challenge, but i dont feel like im better than becca or that becca's really better than me, we're about the same so its cool.
sarah's in wind ensemble!! yaaaay.
and then after school i made him smile :-D or i like to think i did. maybe he was just smiling, but he doesnt smile much. i asked him if he was going to OSU, even though i knew he was. just sparking conversation. but he smiled. and thats great. and for the first time in awhile my day was actually OKAY!!!"

Wembley Fraggle has never been good at deciding. In<br>fact, ""to wemble"" is a useful<br>Fragglish word meaning ""to go back and<br>forth from one thing to another without<br>deciding on anything."" Wembley usually is<br>wembling about whether to stand or lie down or<br>look right or left or straight ahead. In the<br>morning, he wembles about which shirt to wear<br>though he only has two and they're both exactly<br>alike.

Part of the reason Wembley has such a hard time<br>making decisions is that he is genuinely eager<br>to please. So he doesn't like to disagree or<br>decide something which might make someone<br>unhappy - especially if that someone is Red,<br>Mokey, Boober, or Gobo, Wembley's best friends.<br>Gobo is Wembley's hero, and if Wembley were<br>better at deciding, he might decide to be like<br>Gobo some day. In the meantime, Wembley is very<br>good at being Wembley which means he's a<br>cheerful, agreeable, easy-going Fraggle to have<br>for a friend.

so the lists went up for chairs yesterday, and even though i havent auditioned yet it provided me w/ some useful information. such as first chair in wind ensemble is a junior, followed by 4 freshmen!!! i say if i beat 2 of the freshmen thats good, so i have to be better than kayleigh jennings and alex mamone. im doubting i'll be as good as either of the wetula twins, but i'd prefer not to be last chair. so maybe i'll be 4th and becca will be last!!! lol. juuust kidding becca. haha and sarah might be in wind ensemble!! thats so funny cuz she wanted to be a 2nd clarinet in concert band!!! oh well, at least she'll realize that shes better than she thought and that she can play music she didnt think she could play. which would work even if she wasnt in w/e, but was a 1st clarinet in concert band, cuz she didnt think she could play that music either. either way, shes gonna have to play stuff she didnt think she could play. i just wanna be in w/e soooooooooo bad....but i know katie, who's first chair, is gonna be really happy cuz she thought one or both of the wetula's was gonna beat her. and btw, the wetula's are nice girls, not depressed like me and moss thought. i think they're all right.

KAT SAYS HI! anyway, im so lost at the moment. kat and jeff are sitting next to me and they are not helping me out!! garsh. and the substitute teacher is watching everyone like a hawk so its a tiny bit hard to type. so i got sick and threw up this morning. it was not cute. but i had to go to school anyway. we voted for quentyn for president today at lunch and they didnt announce it!! i was upset. he probably got almost as many votes as ralph nader! but i hate school augh!!! i really wanna be back in florida...and of course my moms mad at me...story time!!
so we go trick-or-treating last night. the group consisted of me, natalee, sarah, kelly, sophia, katie moss, quentyn, and rob eurle. halfway through t-o-t, natalee and rob decide to run away!!! which is really retarded considering natalee invited everyone to come over her house afterwards. what else is retarded is that natalee just decided to ""like"" rob cuz u know how she is w/ ""liking"" people. the first guy she sees and all of a sudden she ""likes"" him. yeah so that means she should run off w/ him in the dark while leaving the rest of the group behind!!! especially when theres someone else who has a thing for rob too. so she just pissed me off. then my mom calls and goes, ""what are you doing? natalee's mom told me that a group of u decided to just go run off to katie moss's house....!"" fuck that shit. im so happy natalee's parents think shes the little angel when shes the one who fucked everything up. and i dont care if i get angry, because natalee pulls shit like this all the time w/ me and i think its time that me and her just go our separate ways because i dont know how much longer i can put up w/ her shit!"

day one: magic kingdom. highlights: space mountain, splash mountain. dinner: california grill on the 15th floor of the contemporary resort. got ""beef"" aka steak. about the size of carrie cerino's. ""i paid $27 for a big mac?""
day two: epcot. highlights: mission space, test track, and FRANCE!!! i got to eat dinner at ""france"" in the lands omg it was the best food i eeevvveeerrrr had!!! soooo yummmy! i <3 the french!
day three: animal kingdom/magic kingdom. no matter what those disney people say, animal kingdom is totally a zoo!! they are such liars. went to magic kingdom again to catch up on the things we missed.
day four: mgm/lands at epcot. highlights: tower of terror!!! best ride...and rock 'n' roller coaster is good too. dinner: picked at things from different stands at the lands.
day five: typhoon lagoon. water park!! yeah...but i was alone the whole time. sad. dinner: fulton's crab house. yummm...crab legs, baby!
day six: mgm. highlights: tower of terror and rock 'n' roller coaster again. and the beauty and the beast show!!! aww...dinner: room service pizza, very yum.
day seven: pool/lands at epcot. highlights: meeting *tyler* at the pool. tyler=very cute boy from alabama. he was older though...a freshmen in college, but he looked a lot younger. and he talked to me first which made me feel good...but just a question, whenever i meet a guy that actually talks to me, why do they have to live somewhere like ALABAMA or even better SCOTLAND? why not parma ohio???? grrr...and i called katie moss and we talked for nearly an hour about senior show. aww...im sad i missed it! dinner: coral reef restaurant. good fish!
another thing i learned from this vacation is that i hate kids!!! if an explanation for this is necessary i shall give it to you some other time.
im happy to be back in parma, guys!!! i missed u all soooo much!!!! but i also miss the 90 degree sunny weather!!"

1. i hurt my jaw. again. wtf??? it hurts like a bitch and every time i close my mouth i cry. boy, isnt' this sweet right before vacation? i hope i can get surgery again!
2. mrs nicholson told me that since im going on vacation right before the end of 1st quarter, im missing 300 points next week that i cant make up when i get back cuz grades are due. so either i finish 300 points worth of work in the next day or i get a 0 out of 300 on my report card. how nice of her, huh?
3. a key on my piccolo is all fucked up. so i get to play w/ that for the next few days and possibly for a bit when i get back.
4. he wont talk to me unless i force him to. i wish i never felt anything for him. i wish he would just get away and i wouldnt have to look at him ever again, because i cant deal w/ all his shit. he doesnt even know hes pulling shit, im sure, but he is to me.
5. my cable internet is completely fucked up and it has fucked up my entire computer also. i cant do anything, im amazed im typing in here but i wouldnt be surprised if it didnt work. no one at cox knows how to fix it. so im getting pissed.
im telling u right now, something good better happen at the game friday or im done. w/ everything. i swear to god. and i mean w/ everything. i look forward to games to cheer me up but if it doesnt, je suis fini. i am dead."

speaking of lunch, i hope quentyn's not BLIND, sarah! u eye-poker! just kidding. 
sigh. 
so here i am, in another dilemma. what else is new w/ me, huh? quentyn says i should tell him. i say i dont want my tiny little heart broken into a million bitty pieces. im scared of rejection and i dont wanna embarrass myself. the odds are against me. quentyn says they are not and i am assuming. im sorry if im the kind of person that assumes the worst. i guess quentyn just assumes the best. but he's wrong and im right. so ha. 
today in band was funny. doug put on andy blackburn's goofy little hat thing...he looked funny. and sarah fell. i wish i woulda saw it so i coulda laughed. juuuust kidding. 
in history we made mr white sing to mike trompak like a pirate. it was funny. benze was the parrot.
at lunch the reese's machine was almost broken!!! but dont worry, guys, i got my reese's. 
in english we have to make comic strips. mines called ""kaylyn and elli's trip to....THE MALL!"" its about buying hair dye and PUNGENT! yeah...
then i stayed after school talking to katie and quentyn for like 20 minutes and my mom got all worried (of course) and called the house like a billion times. oh well. i didnt have enough energy to care cuz i wasted it all on my stupid tears. 
so then i left my house at like 4:30 to go copy my flute music for my lesson, then i had my lesson, got out of there at like 10 after 6, went to driving school, got out of there at 9:30, came home and i still havent eaten anything since lunch today!!!! my mom wont be home till after 11 but shes bringing me food. but i am sooo hungry!!!

so i got home and in the middle of the night i threw up. which is really funny cuz i wanted to play hookie today and i didnt have to cuz i actually got sick. even though when i called work christina says in her little accusing bitchy tone ""what? u got sick from yesterday till today??"" and i was like ""yeah i got sick in the middle of the night"" ""well, u've done this before (meaning ive called off last minute before) and i guess i'll let it slide."" fact of the matter is, i've never called off. ever. the only times ive been taken off at all is when they messed up the scheduling, like put me on a weekend i was w/ my dad. other than that, there was the one time when i called a week ahead of time to ask them if one day i could get off at 3 instead of 4 because of the swim banquet. i fucking hate christina. shes such a fake bitch. like, she says everything in this fake nice tone but shes constantly being a bitch. i cannot fucking wait till spring so i have a fucking excuse to quit.
i think im just gonna have to get up and do the frustrated dance. its very fitting at the moment. peace out."

'twas a good time. until i went to the bathroom and weighed myself. i got on the scale and it said 108 so i was really mad. then dee was like ""the scales broken."" and i was like ""well i hope it weighs light!"" and dee was like ""well lets go see."" and she weighed herself and she goes, ""it weighs about 5 pounds heavy."" so yeah...that means im back down to 103 and im the sickly looking anorexic girl once again. isnt this just a wonderful life i have??????"

"event","see that statement above? deep down in my tiny little pumping heart i believe it to be true. things arent quite going my way. im not sure why, to be honest. its just not happening for me. schools ok, except for a few little minor details. such as CONSTANT REMINDERS...so today in math natalee took a quick drink of her water and mr marcinowski told her not to...yeah so in the end natalee got written up and a detention and stuff all cuz she took a sip and someone told mr m. to write her up!!! so did katie cuz she called him a jerk...it was so ridiculous. then lets see...lunch was fun. we played candyland. i totally won. ok i totally won after i cheated a little. ok i cheated a lot. quentyn and rob sat with us. i helped rob w/ his spanish homework even though i take french. and again, i did not ""level"" with quentyn. quentyn's one of the people i cant ""level"" w/ at the moment. oh, sigh, if they only knew, huh? then i had english and we played literary terms bingo. it was pretty fun, even if i was only 2 things off of filling up my whole board for bingo and jeff klemm beat me for the second time. jerk. wait, i better not say that, i might get written up. when i got home i sat around. then my dad got me and we ate wendy's and i went to sarahs. me and sarah looked through the eighth grade yearbook and we saw all the freshmen when they were in seventh grade. some of them (i.e. tim leo) looked so funny. then we jetted off to dance, which, as always, was a total thrill. ballet is not that bad. im not that good, but its not that bad. jazz is fine. ""carwash"" was playing...it made me wanna get up and shake my booty. we were also listening to some weird japanese stuff that sounded like spanish. lol. i got home, washed up a bit, and then i talked to natalee. she called zak and they had a good conversation, better than sarah and ""cody's"" in 8th grade or w/e. he seems like a nice kid. not as silent as i thought. then i called my brother to wish him a happy b-day. hes 25 now. then i came upstairs and no ones online. so thats life i guess."

"event","hello children. so today was one of those days where deep inside people are getting on my nerves, but i just smile and say to myself, ""let it go."" which doesnt happen often, so i hope u all took advantage of it. i know my mom did at dinner today, but we wont get into that because then some people might think my moms way and...yeah...maybe kelly knows what i mean??? so i'll get into another conversation me and my mom had. it was about people with crappy lives and angry people. i told my mom i was one of the angry people. she told me she could never live with an angry person like my sister ever again and that i couldnt either, could i? i was kinda like...i dunno...i love my sister! lol. so me and kelly had a conversation about things today and she actually kind of cleared up the thing ive been pondering, and u people are probably sitting here going, ""what were u pondering???"" but if u really wanna know u can ask me :-D kelly gave me insight into the ways other people think and i totally got what she was saying. so maybe i'll just lay off a little...? i dunno. me and her were also talking about if i ever could date brandon cuz for some reason thats an issue at stake here and i really dont know why people are so curious about it cuz its really nothing. and she was like, ""what qualities does he have that would make u wanna date him?"" and i was like, ""i DONT wanna date him."" and she goes, ""yeah but what dateable qualities does he have?"" me-""umm....hes a nice guy."" kelly-""paletta's a nice guy...that doesnt mean i wanna date him."" me-""exactly."" so kelly may have let me see the other ways of thinking, but i also think some people arent trusting some of the statements im making...im sorry the STATEMENT im making so just believe me guys, jesus, cuz this is what pisses me off. and trust me on this too-u dont want me to be pissed off!
did i talk about moss's beautiful book she made me in here yet? it was the nicest thing anyone ever did for me. it made me cry. its this book of all these cute little phrases and pictures and things and i adore it as i adore moss! 
first ballet class today!! it wasnt that bad. i was the worst one in there but by my own personal standards i wasnt terrible. i liked it better than jazz tonight, w/ that evil lady who made us do crunches the whole time. wtf, this is dance, not dry land training. u evil whore.
i wasnt in band today cuz i had an orthodontist appt. and i realized how much fun band is! its my favorite class of the day! its the only one where u can talk like the whole time and only get yelled at some of the time. unless ur benze, in which case u get yelled at all the time. me and sarah realized tonight that the elyria game is away, so it should be a fun bus ride on the way out there...well, as long as im on the good bus :-D which this time moss isnt on mine!! i wanna cry my BEADY little eyes out...haha such a play on my ""name"". im hilarious. 
in chem today quentyn kept tapping this girl krissy's computer screen and he was pissing her off so she was like, ""who the hell are you?!?!?!"" i laughed. 
note to katie neylon- i need a more dependable paper flower. it kept breaking. so i gave it to brandon. so ur making me a new one.
in closing, im honest, im truthful, and i hate to lie so believe every fucking word i say."

"event","so tonight was the fateful night of dance registration. i kind of knew what was coming, but i thought i would be able to turn it down. i thought i would be able to avoid it. but alas, i could not. i was planning on going up there, signing up for my two regular classes and then another jazz class, but obviously things cannot be that easy. and so, and mind you not because i want to be, i am now a ballerina. yes, i was told i HAD to take ballet. or else it was two classes and thats it. and i also wasnt completely fond of bridget tonight, cuz lets just say she was not necessarily boosting my spirits. she basically just told me that im there to goof off, sarah is there to be a professional, and i would be fine taking two classes. boy, let me tell you that really boosts my confidence going into these classes where i will inevitably be the worst person and have no idea what im doing. plus, its now $100 a month, and we DEFINITELY do not have that kind of money. i mean, my mom spent $150 on me today, $40 for the fixing of my flute, and $110 for dance. in this part of our lives, my mom and i do not have very much money. and maybe i should just say this here since only a few people read this and i've only told one person. basically my mom and i are only going to have about half the money we used to have because my mom and jerry are getting a divorce. now i havent told anyone this except one person, so please no one freak out on me. but i feel terrible and i have a feeling im going to get so frustrated and get so guilty about these ballet and jazz classes that i'll end up dropping them. i have so much going on in my head. i dont wanna spend this money that we dont have. im gonna have to be working all the time and probably paying for some of this and i have no idea what to do. my mom started crying cuz shes really stressed out cuz her divorce is going to be final on tuesday. and i feel stressed out for contributing to her stress cuz im making her spend money on my dance, which bridget made me feel pretty crappy at anyway. maybe i shouldnt dance at all, never do anything for myself, and sit around on my butt. i would like that."

"event","hello world. hows it goin? well im doin ok here. today was a day like any other. a day when i woke up, ate a cookie and a push-up, and went to pick out a locker (1773 RULES!). i got home, and soon after i got my hair cut and highlighted. soon after that, i picked up my good friend natalee bielcassarino and we went off to the mall together. alrighty, so we're sitting in the food court, im eating my mcdonalds, shes watching me. and this kid goes by, and i whisper to natalee, ""is that geremy?"" and i meant geremy w/ the long last name that i dont feel like typing out that went to padua. and so she yells his name and he looks. so then he walks by and natalee goes ""hi geremy!"" and he just said this very vague ""hi."" but natalee's tale of events is a little different. she says she didnt say anything but he said very ecstatically, ""hi natalee!!"" and she goes, ""oh, hi geremy."" which is definitely not what happened but i guess natalee has some kind of terrible memory problem. she musta been thinking of some other time cuz i have no idea what she was talking about. so later me and natalee are walking around and we saw him again, this time w/ (drumroll please.......) MY BEST FRIEND!! yay!! and dan mcwilliams (was that him? i think. who cares i dont like him much anyway.). so geremy asks if i wanna buy a gold card. i dont. but i feel guilty cuz i know i have like $50 sitting in my purse so i say okay. and on comes the stampede. everyone is doing what they can to buy my gold card. dan puts his arm around me. erik is shoving the gold card in my face. but the winner is GEREMY cuz he actually asked me first. so i wasted $10 on this piece of plastic but oh well, i get free pretzels. and i supported my fellow redman in the struggle to raise money in this time of failing levies (is that the plural of levy? it was my guess). and so ends another exciting day in the life of kaylyn marie, and i hope u all enjoyed it very much.

MY BEST FRIEND! i almost peed. i had wondered why he never gave me a call or anything. i mean, we never got together once this summer! i was hoping we coulda gone shopping for shoes or something. sad. i miss him. hehehe. so we have band pics tomorrow. still havent found my spats and gloves and whatever else we need. oh well. and i also really dont feel like walking all the way around the school which takes like 15 mins carrying all the crap i need. then tuesday im working at noon and i have band till 11:30 but my mom wont be home and i have to take a bus and theres no way i can walk home, change, walk to the bus stop and catch a bus, and have that bus get me to work all in a half hour. not gonna happen. so im in a dilemma and i dont know what to do. oh well. i need to stop stressing for today i guess. cuz i got paid $15.75 for standing around drinking pop and talking about what kind of wedding im gonna have and how people everywhere else call pop ""soda"". and then i went to the swimming banquet where i got a medium shirt instead of a large!!! yay!!! but only cuz i traded, not cuz my coach actually gave me the right size. and i ate a cookie. and everyone liked my hair! even though it was the same way i always have it. now natalee's not picking up her phone even though she told me to call her back and augh!!!! alright, im going."

"event","ahhh it has been very long since i updated here ^^; let's see.

i just finished my english conversation test here and i made it ^^ so that's one test down...next week testweeks will begin agai and i ain't feeling a bit happy about it >_<

good part is: i managed to finally find a way to memorize schoolthings like kanji in my head witheout forgetting it within 5 seconds. i can now manage to memorize it for several hours! w00t! i hope this method will give good results in the test week @_@

recently i also started to dream ALOT! seriously i haven;t dreamth so much in years as i have these past days. mostly they were about dollfies, kate bush and other vague stoff....but especially dollfies @_@

must be because i have a new obsession or something... ( NO it's not some idiotic guy it's a new HOBBY) ^^

i also managed to save quite some money i must say. the only thing were i have spended money on so far was some sushi from albert hein and i still need to pay for an order...but it isn't in yet so...i even stopped buying money from the school cantine and the train station so i am quite proud of myself hehehe. plus i don't feel ashamed for even picking up money off the floor when i see it. it's MONEY people, not BUBBLEGUM that i would scrape of the floor and put in my mouth =_= ( ewww...)

also got quite a lot of comissions this month and already managed to make drawings for people this month worth at least 200$ in total ^_^ so i can't complain :D i lost my cleaning job for 4 months because my contract ended. over 4 months i can contact them again to work for them again.

damn health assurance...sucking up 112 euro worth of my little bit of money =_=....."

"event","just wanted to say that i enjoyed loraine's party last yesterday ^^ ( and yes i finally manage to writhe your name good! ) but before i start about the party, i will first talk a bit about what happened before it:

when arriving in leiden, we first decided to go shopping XD since i knew that leiden has about 3 great clothing shops that i like we finally got the chance to check all 3 of them :D

clothingshop #1: from the outside it had great shoes and gothicy clothing in the window so before i knew it i  dragged myself into it all happy happy and the rest followed me in of course....but something didn't feel right...after a while i noticed that a lot of clothing had the brand ''londsdale'' on them and i heard the lady behind the counter saying something to a customer about the dutch fighting so hard in the war for freedom and people like them ( me and long?) taking advantage of it witheout ever having done something for it? i dunno, she didn't exacly say it like that but that's what it meanth for sure. so slowly i told everyone that it was better for us to leave ^^: quite interesting though....and i can laugh about the fact that i just happily walked into an racist shop witheout me noticing it XD making the owners of it all nervous and what not lol...

shop #2: after that we got to the more friendly shops and shop nr 2 was a punky shop ^^ i managed to buy this cool shirt there and the owner of it asked me if he could take a picture of me with it ( oooh my first modelling job XD) when i putted it on he said that the battery of his camera was almost gone but he managed to make just one picture. he wasn't able to show it to me though....but he would put it on the website of the shop XD wheeee!

shop #3: was a gothic /metal shop but this time the owners seemed more friendly, since they friendly greeted me when i walked around and hardly payed attention to us. i felt more comfortable ^^i didn't find anything good though but they did had some interesting clothing...but maybe a little too gothicy for me yet ^^;

anyway! after that we went to loraine's party ^^ it was nice to see everyone back again ( although i didn't really see much of bert and sabine ;_;) it was also interesting to meet roel....although when he talked to me eventualy about a certain person he kept teasing me about it that evening occasionally T_T i hope he won't tell bad things about me to him. i also found out that my little present for loraine was quite populairsince patrick, long and rolf kept playing with it all the time XD

anyways...i would have liked to stay longer but most people had to go back and i did not wanted to go back the next day on my own T_T sigh...anyways...that's about it...got nothing much else to say...

have a nice day! :3"

"event","i recently started to watch the new anime series called paradise kiss. i noticed that the last anime series i have watched all had something to do with cultural stufff. ''beck'' was about music ''honey and clover'' about art and paradise kiss about fashion. i only watched one episode so far but it has already sucked me in :P i even have a favourite character XD the thing that surprised me the most of this anime was the ending song, wich wasn't a japanese song from some japanese band but one of the latest songs from franz ferdinant. uhu pretty cool :D

apart from that, my hair is straight again yoehoe!! and it is staying straight better than the first time. i love it hahaha XD  you can't imagine how much i enjoy the wind blowing my hair in my face and waking up and having my hair immedeately the way i want it to be hahaha XD

a shame the good snow went away so fast. i had such a long schoolday >< grrr and my presentation was really * puke* but i was surprised when lieuwe suddenly started to talk to me on msn saying that my presentation wasn't so bad at all 0_0;;

the crush thing...i could say i have made a little bit of progress as the ape has given me a few compliments and starts to talk to me on msn out of his own now ( thank god! ><) he keeps saying he is shy ( what he? shy? MY ASS! ) but i'll try a little longer...

my sleepover at this girl's place whom i know from msn was pretty fun ^^ i got a different view of cats now as her cat was a real sweetie ^^ the cat kept biting me like a snack  but i survived hahaha XD thank god it used it's fangs instead of it's nails. i am scared of cat nails >< and since i am used to dogs i didn't mind the cat biting me all the time :P we ate sushi and played videogames and watched charlie and the chocolate factory ^^ there was this one really cool game that she had. she had a device hooked on her playstation 2 with gloves attached on it. when you putted the gloves on your hand you had to move your arms and fight yourself against enemies hahaha really fun but also very tiring @_@

now i will go and eat me some bulgarian food. so...see ya later!"

"event","this will be justa  random post. i notice that all i have been writhing lately are tests and surveys, and after having seen episode 8 of densha otoko i feel like typing...

yesterday i went to a comicfestival again. i had better days selling my stuff. but at least i got all of my costs out so i guess that is good. i am glad that my new manga is finished so now i can rest a bit again and put more energy in my school for the testweek. however no matter how hard i try i keep thinking up new stories and idea to draw every minute. it's like a disease. once i infished somethig i want to start all over again. i am not sure if this is good or bad...i guess that's just the way i am. anyway at the festival i bought a few small things and i got quite a number of things for free wich is always fun. while spyoing on a certain doujinshi group's stand suddenly someone grabbed my shoulders from behind:

strange man: hey there! you want to participate in our small comic quiz?
me: well actually i ehm...
strange man: OKAY WE HAVE A KANDIDATE!
me: 0_0;

the prizes were not great at all ^^; suske and wiske the movie dvd? pokemon and luney tunes comics? come on! ^^; so yeah i let a little boy win. i also received a dvd from a friend of mine who visited the festival ^^ i was happy to see him again :) and the dvd was quite nice ^^ in japan a few years ago, there was this trend about cyberidols. what are those? well idols ( no not the tv programme!) are usually cute girls who sing songs and are populair like britney spears. except in this case they were 3d computer girls. so yeah they created computergirls and let them sing songs and become populair instead of real girls. this dvd was about such a girl and contained a videoclip and 6 short movies and some extra's of her. while it isn't as great as the final fantasy advent children quality, it was certainly fun to watch :)

densha otoko is so much fun ^^ i almost cried again with episode 8. it looks all so recognizable to me. it's also funny ^^ ( otherwise i would not have watched it) that series really makes me laugh ^^ ( no it's not an anime but a japanese life action series. though it does contain a lot about the anime/mannga fanculture in it) however in this episode nr. 8 there was also a bit of a dissapointment in it. while everything was great and funny as always...it was revealed that my favourite character has/had a girlfriend...T_T sigh...now i won't be drooling over him the same way like i did before...sigh...:( i do hope that i can meet someone like him in real life someday. it should be able to happen...half long hair, no make up and normal clothes...nothing extreme...but i guess not. 

*slaps herself* okay i won't go further into emo mode ^^; ik denk dat ik weer de nichtrijder ga kijken....zo een dome nederlandse nagesychroniseerd filmpje van de nightrider...als je de serie niet kent zul je dit filmpje ook niet leuk vinden ^^;

that's all :) bye!"

You say whatever is on your mind. Other people's reactions don't phase you.
You prefer a variety of friends and tend to change friends quickly.
You tend to dream big, but you worry that your dreams aren't attainable.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/howdoyouliveyourlifequiz/"">How Do You Live Your Life?</a></div>

If it's cute, you'll wear it. Fake and bake, hair bleach, and bright makeup line your bathroom cabinet.
As for clothes - anything that's short and cute (""kawaii!"").
You are the prize object of all sorts of men - but you are really looking for a rich foreign guy.
He'll find you out hanging out in Shibuya shopping at the 109, text messaging and sending photos over your cellphone.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/whatsyourjapanesesubculturequiz/"">What's Your Japanese Subculture?</a></div>

You take a while to fall in love with someone. Trust takes time.

You give and take equally in relationships.

You tend to get very attached when you're with someone. You want to see your love all the time.

You love your partner unconditionally and don't try to make them change.

You stay in love for a long time, even if you aren't loved back. When you fall, you fall hard.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/howareyouinlovequiz/"">How Are You In Love?</a></div>

........................................................................FINAL FANTASY ADVENT CHILDREN !! of course.

i saw it i saw it yes yes !! XD ( i already have seen it since monday...thanks long :D) thanks god it was better than i expected and i enjoyed it very much XD i already lost count of how often i have seen the movie XD was the movie perfect? no it wasn't. there were a few things that bothered me like:
-many main characters had too small roles ><
-the movie felt too short
- certain things in the story stayed unclear
-some people who seemed to be totally dead in the game were mysteriously alive in the movie
-people could fly and jump around so high without breaking anything ^^;
-camera movement go TOO fast in the battle scenes ><
-sometimes the animation was not fluent
-cid was not swearing and smoking a cigarette ><

apart from all this i LOVE the movie ^^ i even sometimes pink a little tear away when i see the ending ^^:

i also started to follow the series called witch on jetix. i kinda like it but i can hardly follow it because THOSE BASTARDS ALREADY STARTED DOING RECAPS >< even though the only aired about 4/5 episodes now they already started to recap >< urg! but yeah it's an nice series to watch.

ehm...that's actually all....^^: this tuesday my brother needs to go to hospital and then will be operated at his stomach in wednes day so i hope it will go well. i don't exacly know what is wrong with his stomach but...ah well...

that's all. mata kondo!"

"event","yesterday i went to amsterdam to see howl's moving castle ^^ it was nice. the movie was also very nice and omg, howl is the most sexiest miyazaki character ever XD bwahahahaha......ahem...anyway like i said it was a nice movie except that the ending was so....sudden? unlike spirited away and princess mononoke were the endings were worked out quite well, this movie...well...anyway in the end i also ended up buying a new manga named xxxholic from CLAMP ( chobits, card captor sakura) at the beginning of this manga there was a lot of talking and stuff and i was like: omg no this is one of those so typical manga's >_< but thank god later in the manga the story became more interesting...i am not too sure if i would buy the other books as well....hmm

at the very end i was sooooo sick...my legs hurt and my head hurted so much and my stomach hurted wich resulted in me feeling sick...=_= but i am okay now.

i recently downloaded more music ( as always :D) and ended up with two latest songs from gackt.......the first song: ''Todokanai Ai to Shitteita no ni Osae Kirezu ni Aishitsuzuketa'' (probably the longest song title ever >_<)........sucks....it really does...it's a dramatic gackt song and his voice soo fucks up in this song ...>_< am i the only one who has noticed that gackt's voice has changed?  it's not as strong and clear as it used to be >_< and in the videoclip that belongs with this song he looks like that harry potter teacher called snape or something? he really looks like him >_< maybe he will become a ''snape'' stand in in harry potter 3254325 :P  anyway his other song with a more decent title called, noesis was better. it has more rock in it like his songs used to be. the song is cool....weren't it that 60% of the time, gackt computerizes his voice in this song wich totally sucks as well....if he hadn't done that then it would be one of the good old gackt songs...=_= why do artists always end up screwing things up? hmm? it isn't just gackt who ends up like this but i have seen this so often. why? 

ehm...tomorrow i will go to another comic fest and am now preparing for it....nja...euhm...that is actually all ^^;  bye!"

"event","i am so low on energy lately...=_= i feel like doing nothing, i don't want to do anything lately...and i hate it since i am actually a very productive person >_< i didn't even want to writhe here but here goes:

it is going to be a busy week :/

today: went to my youngest brother birthday. i loved to see the dog again and playing ^^ it's suuuuch a cute creature but so energienic and wild hahahaha XD i just love that animal's face. i also bought myself a new playstation game...=_= bust a move 2 ^^; also known as bubble bobble. i haven't played it yet. hopefully my mother and/or brother will play it together with me from time to time. i really want to do things with them together more but they never want to :(

saturday: i noticed there will be a sort of concert being held in this stupid hole of a village here tomorrow so i might wanna check it out. some band called racoon wil be playing here....the name sounds familliar but i doubt i like their music :/ ah well, nothing ever happends here so i might as well check.

sunday: IF things go alright i might go visit howl's moving castle together with ruby ^^ but i do not want to force her. if she can't come along then that will be no prob...i'll just go by myself ^^ i have to travel all the way to amsterdam to see the movie though ^^:  but i love miyazaki movies so i bet it will be alright ^^

monday:.....nothing

tuesday: i will go to maastricht to go to a foto studio to let a photographer take pictures of me XD i always wanted to have fancy pictures and who knows...maybe i can start a ''portfolio'' for moddeling work XD although i doubt that the moddeling world will be something for me. i am too weird hahahah XD and not bimbo enough :P

aaah i just downloaded the big miyavi movie named oresama, i am going to watch it now XD so see ya! byeeeeeee!"

<lj user=""lacus_autumni""> said they wanted to hang out at the mall but they changed their mind :-(.  

And also I went to gaming group with <lj user=""longy""> the other day but my character got killed TWICE :-(.  That totally sucked!   
 
I feel so listless!  Why does <lj user=""angel_cross""> keep posting images in their journal?!  I keep telling them I'm on a modem! I'm going to unfriend them to teach them a lesson!!!!!!!!!!

I feel like I'm so furious!  <lj user=""theorah""> told me that <lj user=""zenithbv_21""> told folks that they saw me dissing on <lj user=""orangetornado"">. Whatever!    

Oh and I am so going to kick <lj user=""feeblefables""> out of the house. They wore my favorite furry shirt when <lj user=""catalina_marina""> was visiting.  I've never been so embarassed in my life!

<lj user=""shanra""> told me that <lj user=""theorah""> told <lj user=""fiona_judith""> and <lj user=""osaka""> that they saw me talking crap about <lj user=""denji"">. That is SO not true!     

I gave everybody my wishlist of computer hardware for my birfday, but nobody bought me anything :-(.  

Hey and know what? that bitter old queen <lj user=""zenithbv_21""> gone and said that they saw me talking to <lj user=""theorah""> and backstabbing <lj user=""shanra"">.   

And also I am totally going to ban <lj user=""angel_cross""> from commenting in my LJ for what they said about <lj user=""wee_free_man"">!!!!"

"event","yup it's been a while since i putted up some video clips here...i decided to put more than one clip here this time hehehehe....

first...since i know that there are a number of people here who like'l'arc en ciel, here's an old clip of them, blurry eyes. i really like the song but OMG! is it just me or does hyde look more female than i do 0_0 it's not fair! i also wanna be a japanese man, then i might attract more guys and look way hotter than i do now...=_= the clip looks old to me and cheap...still....a girly guy is always nice to look at hahahah i think XD
http://s49.yousendit.com/d.aspx?id=3IKXIKAWUELQF1WJBIF5VFXWWN 

second clip.....another rockband with female looking guys BUT....this is no japanese band but a KOREAN one...i thought it would be nice to put something like this up for a change :D i totally dig that ''blonde'' guy in this clip XD he looks scary but cool hehehe. i think this band is a mix between a dumb boyband and a typical Jrock band....i mean Krock XD
http://s42.yousendit.com/d.aspx?id=0APUH4NXV3CT93QTTTFX6GZ80L 

and finally another psycho le cemu clip. their songs are not so fantastic i think but OMG their clips crack me up everytime i see one XD each of their clips look like a bad episode of the power rangers hahahahaha and then to think that ALL 5 people in this clip are men. it's so gay mwahahaha XD para para!!
http://s49.yousendit.com/d.aspx?id=1NCEGOJIJ1MGW3FH0S9NVKF1D7 

oh and check this out! especially for the people who are familliar with QUEEN and like their songs XD
http://s42.yousendit.com/d.aspx?id=160A5WBNW1RG52F0MF0R2CZ6TS 

that's all....yeah i lead a stupid and boring life so i don't have much else to tell...."

Things you enjoy, even when no one around you wants to go out and play. What lowers your stress/blood pressure/anxiety level? Make a list, post it to your journal... and then tag 5 friends and ask them to post it to theirs.

5. playing videogames

List your 6 current favorite songs, then pick six other people to do the same.

"event","today...was it a strange day? not really. it was just a day with...variation.

i studied some stuff for the testweek...but not as much as i should. i was working on a drawing for a contest when suddenly my brother called and asked us to help him search for his puppy dog since they were not able to find it. when i arrived at his house the dog had already been found back. it seemed that the little thing had fallen asleep under a pile of laundry ^^ i stayed there a little more to play with their little animals ( who i will babysit this saturday ^^)

currently i am downloading morrowind since i ''certain person most of us know off'' ( yeah you know who you are :P ) had been talking about it so positive, so i became curious. 

god i love that anime honey and clover. this time it's no yaoi but a adorable romantic anime, not about highschool students, but people of our age :) wich is nice for a change :) i can reccommend it since it was really funny humor in it as well ^^ not to mention nice music too :)

the interview i had with christina with dybex last week was quite interesting. it was nice to see how the translating of making of a dvd works. it gave me a bit more respect for the people who are trying their best to get legal good anime dvd's here on the market as soon as possible.......doesn't stop me from downloading though....sorry guys...

and my DDR dance mat.....why....WHY!!!!!;_; the down arrow doesn't work properly anymore so i can never finish a song in a good way. the down arrow refuses to work when i have to hold another arrow on it at the same time....it sucks...really sucks...so now maybe tomorrow i go to the store to try if i can get a warrant on it....but i fear the worst ;_; i do not have money for a new mat...sigh.....

that's all now....bye bye!

p.s: anyone fancy a sadako like scary game? http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~chanhaor/darkness2.html it kinda freaks me out a little >_<"

"event","a new month has started and i feel blue, just one more week left for school and then the exams will start, and after that......what will i then do? i still don't know, it's all so hard :(
my brother recently bought himself two kittens and a cute little puppydog ^^ such a sweet little thing ^^ if i could i would take him home with me....but we still have that old dog...=_= my mom only wants to buy a new one when this one dies but i get the feeling this one is invincible...she already is older than she is supposed to be....sigh...


I recently went to the stripfestijn in Dordrecht ( Netherlands) This comic fest is being held once every two year. I was invited to come and sit at the stand of Stripster. Since this festival was being held outside I had trouble deciding wether I should come or not since the weather was so bad  But at the end I decided to come anyway 
I didn't think very much of it and didn't make so much preparations for this con as I usually do for other conventions. I had a little trouble finding the festival when I arrived in Dordrecht but when I arrived I saw fellow manga artist and old classmate ''Tze ting Chao'' sitting at the table where I was allowed to sign and draw  Later on I also met another Dutch manga artist like us, ''Marissa Delbressine''. And also a good old friend of mine who brought codes for me for my webshop to make a good webshop system ( Thank you so much ;_;) It was nice seeing known faces at that place and it had quite a nice athmosphere eventhough the weather still wasn't very good   A band was playing so there was some background music as well and eventhough it was held outside and there was bad weather, there were quite a lot of visitors 
I didn't really buy anything and I didn't expect to sell much. At first I indeed did not sell much   But later on I sold quite a lot of original drawings so in the end I managed to make enough money to cover the costs made for this trip and a new inktcardridge. Plus I also made profit  Now I managed to earn enough money to let my newest book get printed at a reall professional printershop 
What kind of manga that will be?
Well you just wait and see  

 and for now i will leave you with TWO clips from my favourite band XD KAGRRA, !!!! XD

the first one is a happy cute song were you see a bunch of pretty boys and flowers and they sing about spring ^^

"event","omg! i have hardly ever been so paranoid in my life as today >_< i had to work this morning wich means i had to clean a stairhouse in some appartments in the place were i live ^^; all fine and so....except for one thing......

cleaning is not the worst job in the world...sure, you gotta clean some dirty toilets and become frustrated because you gotta clean up other people's mess BUT if there is ONE thing that i definately cannot not take  by cleaning it's....

spiders.....>_< and that building was FULL with them >_<!!! OMG i was so freaking out in there! i tried to clean everything as well as i could but i also was supposed to clean away the spiders of course...=_= but i didn't, the mere thought of trying to wipe them away with a broom while they fall down and land on your body or crawl into my clothes just made me...>_<;;; so i all left them there..-_-; i even left those building sooner than i was supposed too but i just was getting really paranoia in there..>_< i can take one tiny spider...but a whole building full with small AND big ones....no thanks..=_=


before i leave, here's a funny movie i found of lord of the rings XD i was really laughing my head off :P i am not sure if any of you already saw this movie somewere but for those who like LOTR it's worth a watch :D for those who don't like it...don't bother lookinbg at it since you won't really get the joke and don't start commenting here like: OMG i hate LOTR...-_-

"event","yup...i feel like uploading another videoclip XD this time it's:

AYUMI HAMASAKI: CONNECTED <---- it's an anime clip, you won't see herself in it but i think the clip is okay but a bit confusing. it is also the smallest videoclip i have..though it is as long as any other clip i have, it is only 8 MB big..:D hope you like :)

http://s35.yousendit.com/d.aspx?id=0YWZGT6YCWQVQ3738CYBAJNG88 

here's a list of clips that i am planning to upload after this one in the right order.

*Kagrra: Haru urara + Kagrra: Kotodama
*Koda kumi ( FF10-2): real emotion
*The trax: Paradox
*Porno graffitty: melissa
*Onmyouza: nemuri
*Miyavi: pop is dead

that's the list so far. i have many more clips but i am not sure if i will upload them so....and maybe later i find newer and nicer clips to add to the list. who knows.."

"event","this weather makes me retarded ^^;  why? because i do  the strangest things when i have too much time. yesterday i found some old play clay that i last used when i was about ten or 12 years old ^^:  i thought about it and since i don't play with it anymore and it was just lying around i decided to make a little sculpture from one of my favourite videogame characters XD when it's done i will post pictures of it here.

what else have i done? oh yeah i decided to study REALLY hard for japanese.... i can't say i studied REALLY HARD but i did study. i decided that i should categorize and writhe down ALL the words of the green japanese book. i am already at chapter 9 so it's going faster as expected XD

i also am making new drawings ( of course :P ) and played some videogames.  and i HATE intevieuw techieken >_<;;;!!!! i think i have an idea who i could interview but i keep forgetting to send them an email >_< but i will do that right now!!

before i leave, here's a little something from me, another videoclip BUT this time not of a male singer or band BUT from a female singer that some of us know as: SHINA RINGO XD i find this clip very pretty. and for now this will be the last clip that i will upload here...unless people here want me to keep uploading? i still have quite a lot of clips on my comp.....

i actually hate having a birthday because it makes me frustrated.  there have been so many things that i wanted to do and accomplish as a 20 year old but i couldn't make it in time :/ all things take up to much time and we don't have much time :( sigh...

i'm lazy again, i try to make some stuff for school...and i almost fully typed out everything from mc carthy :D hmmmhmm...i should be doing more for school and i will try to start with that today otherwise this year will end very badly for me ...=_=;;

dunno much more to writhe again ^^;  i uploaded another clip and this time it's from MIYAVI: AHITA GENKI NI NARE <---seems that not all clips need to be big budget.sometimes a weird guy, an umbrella, a grass field and a big karbon box are enough :P anyway have fun with it...do with it what ya like...i dun care..:P

to those who haven't given their opinion yet, please let me know if you people prefer the thursday or friday to come to my birthday? for now, i will hold it on friday. and i still hardly have no idea what we could do there except for DDR and videogames >_<;; anyone any ideas??

and finally FINALLY after months i managed to progress enormously in that stupid videogame castlevania XD it is already taking me more than a year to finish it...=_= i am really bad at videogames.....but i love em XD!!

http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/starwars

friday the 13th.................this day really sucks >_<

#1: i hardly learned for business because i have trouble concentrating and i had to get up at 6 >_<
#2: i like listening to music in the bus/train because it sooths my mind, yesterday evening i made a new cd with these cool songs so i could listen to it in the bus and train............in the bus i found out i had the wrong cd in my discman >_< so that spoiled my mood
#3: i sat in the .....shop/cafetaria thing on the trainstation, reading business while waiting for my train. i sat with my back towards the side where my train would arrive. i heard a train coming. i looked forward and saw the other train ( the one i didn't need) arriving. i looked back and i saw no sigh of my train. then i heard the other train leave and looked back again finding out that somehow my train arrived unnoticed and left witheout me 
#4: wich caused me arriving to late at school
#5: screwing up the test
#6: on my way home, me and sander wanted to take the train but we found out that for the next few hours, no train would be leaving because some idiot parked his car on the rails and thus an accident happened.....

and now i'm home...

what more to tell??...i have no idea...i want to upload another japanese music video but i don't know wich one ( i want to do one from miyavi but i cannot decide wich one ^^; )

i went to the city today and stepped into the phone shop:

guy: can i help you?
me: i wanna have a phone
guy: what kind of phone?
me:..................a simple phone...one which you can make phonecalls with....
guy:........=_=;;

yeah well i am an idiot when it comes down to mobile phones okay?? but seriously now you can make video's, photo's, internetting and whatnot....in the future you probably can do everything with it except making phonecalls :/ so i don'think my question was that stupid...nja =_=

i also bought a new dancing game but i actually regret it...sure it has newer songs but it has even less options than the old game :/ i actually wanted to have dancing stage fusion but i grabbed dancing stage fever instead ...=_= the names look to much the same...damn...now i need to look very sweet to my brother ( wich will be hard because i hate his guts >_<) and ask if he wants to buy this game over from me so he will give it to me as a present for my birthday :D

strange day today ne? there are such weird vibes coming...what the hell am i talking?? okay i stop...BUT before i leave here's the link to the winning videoclip from last time:

"event","well you asked for it...here's my music taste -_-;; some think it's horrible,...other's think it's great...eitherway i don't care. and YES it's only japanese music now ^^;  that's all that i am listening too, doesn't mean that i never heard of bands like led zeppelin, aerosmith or whatever..and i appreciate them too...but right now i am just a little more in jap music :P


1. Total volume of music files on my computer?
let me see.....about 450 mb?

2. The last CD I bought was?
final fantasy 10-2 soundtrack XD

3. Song playing right now:
Siam Shade: shangri la

4. Five songs I listen to a lot or that mean a lot to me (in no particular order):

#1 Gackt - Vanilla
because it was my very first song i ever heard of gackt and the first song of wich i saw a japanese music clip from, plus gackt just IS my favourite artist XD he was also the first jmusic artist i ever knew.

#2 Maaya Sakamoto - kissing the christmas killer
there are only just a handfull of songs that can move me and maybe even bring an tear to my eye. and this is one of them. i find this one TOO pretty T_T sigh...plus maaya sakamoto is my favourite female artist.

#3 Rip Slyme - Super Shooter
this song is TOOO cool XD it makes me super hyper hehehe.

#4 Miyavi - Jibun Kakumei 2003
oooh just a GREAT song when i am angry or feeling hyper heheh XD i love the clip of this one too.

#5 Koda Umi: Cutey Honey
i just love the rhythm of this song XD very funky too :D

like most people i also could go on and on...but i can only choose 5 >_<

5. Which 5 people are you passing this baton to, why?
SABINE haven't seen her doing this yet :P
Long: eventhough i think i know his music taste i still wanna know :P
Orangetornado: i wanna know what you like of music :D
Angel_Cross: a good excuse to writhe something in your journal :P
Bert: lemme hear your music taste :D"

"event","hadden jullie ook een enquete gehad..een soort onderzoekje via telefoon naar studie enzo? ik net wel. toen ik de telefoon oppakte ging het zo:

ik: hallo?
enquete persoon:hallosagdjjshfaskjdfbahkhn jffhfbxhsvnsjhgbxhfzmhnd
ik: 0_0 watte?

zo ging dat zowat de hele tijd ^^;  die vent had volgens mij haast ofzo. hij vroeg me dingen over onze opleiding..zoals: wat vind je van de roosters. en dan moest ik een rapport punten geven op iedere onderdeel. ik heb zowat overal een 7 gegeven omdat ik niet verstond wat ie zei ^^;  volgens mij dacht ie dat ik doof was ofzo omdat ik de hele tijd ''watte??'' zei -_-;; nja

da's alles...ik heb nog steeds helemaal niks aan slb gedaan. ik ben zo een luie donder.=_=...

ik had gisteren nog een kadootje gekocht voor mijn penvriendin in japan die vandaag jarig was ^^: ik had haar een sleutelhanger met klompjes en ik wilde ook nog iets met nijntje kopen. ik helemaal naar een winkel gezocht in maastricht die nijntje spullen verkocht, liep ik uiteindelijk maar de expo binnen en heb me daar zo een nijntje ding gekocht waar je een foto'tje in kunt stoppen. ik weet verder niet wat je anders aan een japans iemand moet geven die 23 jaar word en nooit zegt wat ze leuk vind ^^;  ik liep de winkel uit, draaide een hoek om en ja hoor....ik stond daar recht tegen over de nijntje winkel die vol stond met nijntje spullen...=_= ach ja...

da's alles....mijn leven is zooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo saai >_<"

"event","my head hurts from all the learning and stress...yesterday i completely failed on my japanese..;_; kuso......i am such an aho...=_= and i had learned so hard for it..i even got literally sick from all the learning..=_= i now have to see if i can save business...today i finished my word test and p2o thing. i also finished recht...aaahhh..my head...=_=

i noticed by the way that more and more people on livejournal start sharing music and moviefiles....maybe i want to do that too but instead of music i rather wanted to try sharing moviefiles of videoclips from all sorts of japanese singers and bands every once in a while? since most people have trouble finding them and have hardly or never seen a clip of them...how about it? i don't know if it works tough...


almost finished downloading one of the malice mizer movies XD ( malice mizer used to be one of those ''guys with heavy make up and dresses'' bands but the group split up) from what sander told me the movie was horrible but i love horrible movies XD the worse they are made, the worse the acting etc..the better they are for a good laugh XD and i could use that now.....i wished people made more bad movies with bad acting and music and so on....like those old kung fu movies...they are so funny XD


okay i am going to continue business before my heads explodes...>_< itai!!"

"event","weer een periode voorbij, wat gaat het toch hard, het is net alsof, hoe ouder je word hoe sneller de tijd voorbij gaat >_< 

ik ben ECHT blij dat mijn presentatie voorbij was =_= volgens mij was ik echt een idioot en waarom moest ik nou zonodig l...a..ng....zaa.....m praten >_<;; en dan die R van mij >_< eewww..daar ga ik echt wat aan doen!

verder heb net een kleine tekening wedstrijdje gewonnen XD ( yaoi tekening mwahahah) ik teken dat soort spul nauwelijks misschien dat ik dat later wel doe? weet nog niet. de prijs was dat mijn tekening werd geplaatst in het eerste boekje van een nieuwe doujinshi ( amateurtekenaars) groepje. en het krijgt een ere plaatsje op hun site :P

verder komt een andere tekening ook nog als pinup art in een mexicaanse comic XD hoe ik daaraan kom? nja via iemand op mijn msn die in mexico als inkleurder voor comics werkt hehehe :D ik krijg als het goed is een paar exemplaren thuisgestuurd als dank :) ze zullen wel in het spaans zijn >_<;;

hmm verder..verder....ah ja..ik ben nu over de helft met mijn grote manga >_< ik zit nu op pagina 37..ik heb er dus nog zowat 23 pagina's te gaan en nog maar ongeveer twee weken...=_=;; ik hoop dat het goed komt.

een vrouwtje wilde op haar website ook een kleine tekening van mij plaatsen, wilde ze me 50 euro voor geven >_< ik schaam me dan echt dood als mensen me een groot bedrag willen geven voor een klein flutdingetje >_<;; ik weet ook nooit wat voor prijzen ik moet vragen. ik zei dat 30 wel genoeg was...ook omdat ze misschien later meer tekeningen van me wilde kopen XD

volgens mij is er echt iets mis met mijn haar >_< ik was het vandaag aan het wassen en besefte dat..aangezien ik ze in meer dan 15 jaar nog NOOIT had afgeknipt..ze nog nooit langer zijn geggroeid dan net bij mijn middel ( als ze helemaal recht zouden zijn en nat.)...volgens mij klopt dat niet. mijn haar groeit echt niet. ik denk dat als jullie je haar in 15 jaar niet zouden laten afknippen, dat het aan de grond zou komen toch? ik weet niet goed wat ik er daarmee aanmoet ik wil langer haar >_<!!

..dat was het XD"

"event","okay here is my top 5 of my favourite men who i like best at the moment :D if girlie looking guys make you blind then don't look :P

<lj-cut> 

sorry if some pics are big -_-;;
 
#1. gackt
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v697/noire-ciel/gackt.jpg"" alt=""gackt2"" /> 
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v15/shaded_mazoku/gackthnaotowhitesm.jpg"" alt=""gackt1"" /> 
whee i found a newer pic of him! looks like he finally got rid of that awfull haircut >_< the second pic is more recent.
ow come on! like you guys didn't see this one coming XD my first and favourite real life bishonen who i ever liked :P eventhough his age slowly starts taking his beauty away he still is pretty i think :D but his voice still rocks!! XD the fact that he has a weird personality and some mental problems and is very talented as well ( but his acting sucks >_<) makes him my favourite XD plus my favourite videogame bishonen was modelled after him soo...that's why XD 


#2. daisuke ishiwatari
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v230/bluemonika/daisuke.jpg"" alt=""daisuke"" /> 
sorry that the scan sucks >_<
now who the hell is this? well he is an music composer, videogame programmer and one hell of an talented artist >_< compared to his art my stuff looks shitty >_<;; yes it's the guy from who my new artbook is from and i already admired him because he managed to design a videogame, partly programmed it, did artwork and character designs and made the music all by himself...something that usually about 10 different people do so yeah if only i had his talent and energy >_<....but when i finally saw his photo's in the artbook i was sold :D oh and he likes western rock music...especially queen XD apart from that, i find it a shame that it is so hard to find info about him >_< i wanna know if he is already married or not!

#3. miyavi
<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v290/Sisilaya/miyavi4.jpg"" alt=""miffy"" /> 
believe it or not but 2 months ago i HATED this guy! i did not like his songs and his attitude but somehow i could help but finding him attractive ^^; so eventually his songs started to grow on me and i started to like them :D now i also saw 2 videoclips of him so far and eventhough he still acts a little annoying in my opinion, i start to like his personality more as well :) and his voice XD it's funny how a cute girlie looking guy can have such a rough low voice :P but his voice is verrry sexy too XD

4#. anji
<img src=""http://www.glay.per.sg/pierrot/images/aiji.jpg"" alt=""anji"" /> 
another one that most of you don't know. he is the guitarist in a band named pierrot. why do i like him? well..from all the bandmembers i liked his face best because it had something soft over it i think. i don't know much about him either but i just think he's cute ^^

5#. johnny depp

        <img src=""http://www.johnnydeppfan.com/portraits/p15.jpg"" alt=""johnny"" /> 
to be honest i had a hard time with this one because i do not have a nr 5.....so....well since all my fave guys have been asians so far...heeeeeeere's johnny! why? i think he is a good actor :) i like almost all movies that he plays in and he has an interesting character :) he might not really make me go WHEEEE when i see him but for a guy in his 40ties he is damn good looking XD!!!

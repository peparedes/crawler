"event","""In interviews, Democrats said the lesson of the Alito hearings was that this White House could put on the bench almost any qualified candidate, even one whom Democrats consider to be ideologically out of step with the country.""
<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/15/politics/politicsspecial1/15alito.html?th&emc=th"" target=""_new"">See Article</a>

As troubled as I am about the religious right's demand on our political leaders to strip away the enumerated rights of our citizens I feel that we (as a country) have handed them this opportunity.  By re-electing Bush our contry is about to enjoy the benefits of the leadership that we voted into office: an consertive tax agenda without the conservative spending agenda and the position of elimating Roe v Wade if possible.

The problem, as I see it, is that I have no real grounds for opposing Alito's nomination because that is not in our party's job description.  As the minority, the Democrats can only vette and rubber stamp candidates to prevent Bush cronyism (Harriet Myers) and extremely unqualified candidates from taking an office with a lifetime tenure.

You're a happy person - you have a good amount of self-esteem, and are socially healthy.  While this isn't a social dysfunction per se, you're definitely not normal.  Consider yourself lucky: you walk that fine line between 'normal' and being outright narcissistic.  You're rare - which is something else to be happy about.<br /><br />

I called the second that I noticed the error and had the vendor request UPS change the address.  Fine.  Done.  The package was then supposed to be delivered on Dec 15.  Well, apparently the damn package has been lost because it was ""out for delivery"" on Dec 14 but has not been scanned since.  WTF?  Now as I sit waiting for an order that was placed a around the same time I have just noticed that even though I paid for 2nd Day air the fuckign package is now two days late.  What THE FUCK!  UPS has some major issues, as a matter of fact they are about to have my cock rammed up their asses in a minute if my damn package doesn't srrive tonight!

Anyone up for firebombing a UPS hub?

So last Thursday Kate ad I were to fly out of DC to New Orleans to begin our whirlwind wedding extravaganza tour '05.  But Delta emailed us informing us that our flight time and airport had been changed two weeks prior to the departure.  That wasn't that big of a deal but they switched us from Dulles (much closer and better shuttle services) to BWI.  So now we had to leave at 2:00 pm to make our 7:30pm flight because traffic and such would be insane.

We get to the airport at 4pm mostly unmolested.  Then notice that all of the flights to Atlanta (we have a connecting flight) were delayed by hours...not 30 minutes but 3 or 4 hours.  We go up to our gate and ask to be put on standby for another flight that will be leaving in an hour and a half.  The woman tells Kate that because our flight has not been delayed there is nothing that she can do.  Fine, I am cool with that.  Then, 45 minutes later she announces that our flight has been delayed to 9:50!!  Our connecting flight would leave at 9:20 and we would be stranded!

We rushed up to the counter and offered no help.  We asked to go through another city...Cincinatti...Chicago...Houston...CAIRO!!  She wouldn't help...bitch.  So I ask for the manager and she gets on a walkie-talkie thing and calls for the manager.  Well thirty minutes passes and no manager.  I decided to investigate the possibility of flying through another airline because we had early morning appoinements and could not miss or re-schedule.  After checking with Southwest, American and U.S. Air I find another Delta employee and ask for his help.  Jeff was absolutly no help.  After explaining the situation to him he told me to, ""Sit down and deal with it.""  I was taken aback...I then asked for the manager and Jeff replied, ""the manager is too busy to speak with you...he has better things to do.""  I FLIPPED OUT.  I said that was the wrong answer asked for his manager's manager.  Thats when he gave me a phamplet for ticketing and said that if I don't leave and calm down he will have to call someone to come and calm me down.  I WAS SOOOO PISSED.  Kate came up and helped me make it back to my seat before I went insano and she dealt with another Delta person who was VERY helpful. So we get on an earlier flight and make it to Atl...but we missed our connecting flight.  SHIT!  We are stuck in Atl it is midnight and we need to be in the French Quarter at 9:30 am.  FUCK.

Kate's mom (a real trooper) comes to get us and takes us to Walmart to buy clothes (our bags were in limbo) and we get in a bed at 2 am.  We left Kate's house at 6 am to make it to the airport and made it to New Orleans in time for our appoiments.

So we have coined a phrase...instead of going postal on someone...I am going to go DELTA on their ass.

I just cannot believe how shitty Jeff and Mrs. Helpful were to us...PAYING CUSTOMERS!

FUCK DELTA!!!!"

"event","Our Godless Constitution

by BROOKE ALLEN

[from the February 21, 2005 issue]

It is hard to believe that George Bush has ever read the works of George Orwell, but he seems, somehow, to have grasped a few Orwellian precepts. The lesson the President has learned best--and certainly the one that has been the most useful to him--is the axiom that if you repeat a lie often enough, people will believe it. One of his Administration's current favorites is the whopper about America having been founded on Christian principles. Our nation was founded not on Christian principles but on Enlightenment ones. God only entered the picture as a very minor player, and Jesus Christ was conspicuously absent.

Our Constitution makes no mention whatever of God. The omission was too obvious to have been anything but deliberate, in spite of Alexander Hamilton's flippant responses when asked about it: According to one account, he said that the new nation was not in need of ""foreign aid""; according to another, he simply said ""we forgot."" But as Hamilton's biographer Ron Chernow points out, Hamilton never forgot anything important.

In the eighty-five essays that make up The Federalist, God is mentioned only twice (both times by Madison, who uses the word, as Gore Vidal has remarked, in the ""only Heaven knows"" sense). In the Declaration of Independence, He gets two brief nods: a reference to ""the Laws of Nature and Nature's God,"" and the famous line about men being ""endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights."" More blatant official references to a deity date from long after the founding period: ""In God We Trust"" did not appear on our coinage until the Civil War, and ""under God"" was introduced into the Pledge of Allegiance during the McCarthy hysteria in 1954 [see Elisabeth Sifton, ""The Battle Over the Pledge,"" April 5, 2004].

In 1797 our government concluded a ""Treaty of Peace and Friendship between the United States of America and the Bey and Subjects of Tripoli, or Barbary,"" now known simply as the Treaty of Tripoli. Article 11 of the treaty contains these words:

    As the Government of the United States...is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion--as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion, or tranquillity of Musselmen--and as the said States never have entered into any war or act of hostility against any Mehomitan nation, it is declared by the parties that no pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries.

This document was endorsed by Secretary of State Timothy Pickering and President John Adams. It was then sent to the Senate for ratification; the vote was unanimous. It is worth pointing out that although this was the 339th time a recorded vote had been required by the Senate, it was only the third unanimous vote in the Senate's history. There is no record of debate or dissent. The text of the treaty was printed in full in the Philadelphia Gazette and in two New York papers, but there were no screams of outrage, as one might expect today.

The Founding Fathers were not religious men, and they fought hard to erect, in Thomas Jefferson's words, ""a wall of separation between church and state."" John Adams opined that if they were not restrained by legal measures, Puritans--the fundamentalists of their day--would ""whip and crop, and pillory and roast."" The historical epoch had afforded these men ample opportunity to observe the corruption to which established priesthoods were liable, as well as ""the impious presumption of legislators and rulers,"" as Jefferson wrote, ""civil as well as ecclesiastical, who, being themselves but fallible and uninspired men, have assumed dominion over the faith of others, setting up their own opinions and modes of thinking as the only true and infallible, and as such endeavoring to impose them on others, hath established and maintained false religions over the greatest part of the world and through all time.""

If we define a Christian as a person who believes in the divinity of Jesus Christ, then it is safe to say that some of the key Founding Fathers were not Christians at all. Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and Tom Paine were deists--that is, they believed in one Supreme Being but rejected revelation and all the supernatural elements of the Christian Church; the word of the Creator, they believed, could best be read in Nature. John Adams was a professed liberal Unitarian, but he, too, in his private correspondence seems more deist than Christian.

George Washington and James Madison also leaned toward deism, although neither took much interest in religious matters. Madison believed that ""religious bondage shackles and debilitates the mind and unfits it for every noble enterprize."" He spoke of the ""almost fifteen centuries"" during which Christianity had been on trial: ""What have been its fruits? More or less in all places, pride and indolence in the Clergy, ignorance and servility in the laity, in both, superstition, bigotry, and persecution."" If Washington mentioned the Almighty in a public address, as he occasionally did, he was careful to refer to Him not as ""God"" but with some nondenominational moniker like ""Great Author"" or ""Almighty Being."" It is interesting to note that the Father of our Country spoke no words of a religious nature on his deathbed, although fully aware that he was dying, and did not ask for a man of God to be present; his last act was to take his own pulse, the consummate gesture of a creature of the age of scientific rationalism.

Tom Paine, a polemicist rather than a politician, could afford to be perfectly honest about his religious beliefs, which were baldly deist in the tradition of Voltaire: ""I believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.... I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church."" This is how he opened The Age of Reason, his virulent attack on Christianity. In it he railed against the ""obscene stories, the voluptuous debaucheries, the cruel and torturous executions, the unrelenting vindictiveness"" of the Old Testament, ""a history of wickedness, that has served to corrupt and brutalize mankind."" The New Testament is less brutalizing but more absurd, the story of Christ's divine genesis a ""fable, which for absurdity and extravagance is not exceeded by any thing that is to be found in the mythology of the ancients."" He held the idea of the Resurrection in especial ridicule: Indeed, ""the wretched contrivance with which this latter part is told, exceeds every thing that went before it."" Paine was careful to contrast the tortuous twists of theology with the pure clarity of deism. ""The true deist has but one Deity; and his religion consists in contemplating the power, wisdom, and benignity of the Deity in his works, and in endeavoring to imitate him in every thing moral, scientifical, and mechanical.""

Paine's rhetoric was so fervent that he was inevitably branded an atheist. Men like Franklin, Adams and Jefferson could not risk being tarred with that brush, and in fact Jefferson got into a good deal of trouble for continuing his friendship with Paine and entertaining him at Monticello. These statesmen had to be far more circumspect than the turbulent Paine, yet if we examine their beliefs it is all but impossible to see just how theirs differed from his.

Franklin was the oldest of the Founding Fathers. He was also the most worldly and sophisticated, and was well aware of the Machiavellian principle that if one aspires to influence the masses, one must at least profess religious sentiments. By his own definition he was a deist, although one French acquaintance claimed that ""our free-thinkers have adroitly sounded him on his religion, and they maintain that they have discovered he is one of their own, that is that he has none at all."" If he did have a religion, it was strictly utilitarian: As his biographer Gordon Wood has said, ""He praised religion for whatever moral effects it had, but for little else."" Divine revelation, Franklin freely admitted, had ""no weight with me,"" and the covenant of grace seemed ""unintelligible"" and ""not beneficial."" As for the pious hypocrites who have ever controlled nations, ""A man compounded of law and gospel is able to cheat a whole country with his religion and then destroy them under color of law""--a comment we should carefully consider at this turning point in the history of our Republic.

Here is Franklin's considered summary of his own beliefs, in response to a query by Ezra Stiles, the president of Yale. He wrote it just six weeks before his death at the age of 84.

    Here is my creed. I believe in one God, Creator of the universe. That he governs it by his providence. That he ought to be worshipped. That the most acceptable service we render to him is doing good to his other children. That the soul of Man is immortal, and will be treated with justice in another life respecting its conduct in this. These I take to be the fundamental points in all sound religion, and I regard them as you do in whatever sect I meet with them.
        As for Jesus of Nazareth, my opinion of whom you particularly desire, I think his system of morals and his religion, as he left them to us, the best the world ever saw or is likely to see; but I apprehend it has received various corrupting changes, and I have, with most of the present dissenters in England, some doubts as to his divinity; though it is a question I do not dogmatize upon, having never studied it, and think it needless to busy myself with now, when I expect soon an opportunity of knowing the truth with less trouble. I see no harm, however, in its being believed, if that belief has the good consequence, as it probably has, of making his doctrines more respected and better observed, especially as I do not perceive that the Supreme takes it amiss, by distinguishing the unbelievers in his government of the world with any particular marks of his displeasure.

Jefferson thoroughly agreed with Franklin on the corruptions the teachings of Jesus had undergone. ""The metaphysical abstractions of Athanasius, and the maniacal ravings of Calvin, tinctured plentifully with the foggy dreams of Plato, have so loaded [Christianity] with absurdities and incomprehensibilities"" that it was almost impossible to recapture ""its native simplicity and purity."" Like Paine, Jefferson felt that the miracles claimed by the New Testament put an intolerable strain on credulity. ""The day will come,"" he predicted (wrongly, so far), ""when the mystical generation of Jesus, by the supreme being as his father in the womb of a virgin, will be classed with the fable of the generation of Minerva in the brain of Jupiter."" The Revelation of St. John he dismissed as ""the ravings of a maniac.""

Jefferson edited his own version of the New Testament, ""The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth,"" in which he carefully deleted all the miraculous passages from the works of the Evangelists. He intended it, he said, as ""a document in proof that I am a real Christian, that is to say, a disciple of the doctrines of Jesus."" This was clearly a defense against his many enemies, who hoped to blacken his reputation by comparing him with the vile atheist Paine. His biographer Joseph Ellis is undoubtedly correct, though, in seeing disingenuousness here: ""If [Jefferson] had been completely scrupulous, he would have described himself as a deist who admired the ethical teachings of Jesus as a man rather than as the son of God. (In modern-day parlance, he was a secular humanist.)"" In short, not a Christian at all.

The three accomplishments Jefferson was proudest of--those that he requested be put on his tombstone--were the founding of the University of Virginia and the authorship of the Declaration of Independence and the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom. The latter was a truly radical document that would eventually influence the separation of church and state in the US Constitution; when it was passed by the Virginia legislature in 1786, Jefferson rejoiced that there was finally ""freedom for the Jew and the Gentile, the Christian and the Mohammeden, the Hindu and infidel of every denomination""--note his respect, still unusual today, for the sensibilities of the ""infidel."" The University of Virginia was notable among early-American seats of higher education in that it had no religious affiliation whatever. Jefferson even banned the teaching of theology at the school.

If we were to speak of Jefferson in modern political categories, we would have to admit that he was a pure libertarian, in religious as in other matters. His real commitment (or lack thereof) to the teachings of Jesus Christ is plain from a famous throwaway comment he made: ""It does me no injury for my neighbor to say there are twenty gods or no god. It neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg."" This raised plenty of hackles when it got about, and Jefferson had to go to some pains to restore his reputation as a good Christian. But one can only conclude, with Ellis, that he was no Christian at all.

John Adams, though no more religious than Jefferson, had inherited the fatalistic mindset of the Puritan culture in which he had grown up. He personally endorsed the Enlightenment commitment to Reason but did not share Jefferson's optimism about its future, writing to him, ""I wish that Superstition in Religion exciting Superstition in Polliticks...may never blow up all your benevolent and phylanthropic Lucubrations,"" but that ""the History of all Ages is against you."" As an old man he observed, ""Twenty times in the course of my late reading have I been upon the point of breaking out, 'This would be the best of all possible worlds, if there were no religion in it!'"" Speaking ex cathedra, as a relic of the founding generation, he expressed his admiration for the Roman system whereby every man could worship whom, what and how he pleased. When his young listeners objected that this was paganism, Adams replied that it was indeed, and laughed.

In their fascinating and eloquent valetudinarian correspondence, Adams and Jefferson had a great deal to say about religion. Pressed by Jefferson to define his personal creed, Adams replied that it was ""contained in four short words, 'Be just and good.'"" Jefferson replied, ""The result of our fifty or sixty years of religious reading, in the four words, 'Be just and good,' is that in which all our inquiries must end; as the riddles of all priesthoods end in four more, 'ubi panis, ibi deus.' What all agree in, is probably right. What no two agree in, most probably wrong.""

This was a clear reference to Voltaire's Reflections on Religion. As Voltaire put it:

    There are no sects in geometry. One does not speak of a Euclidean, an Archimedean. When the truth is evident, it is impossible for parties and factions to arise.... Well, to what dogma do all minds agree? To the worship of a God, and to honesty. All the philosophers of the world who have had a religion have said in all ages: ""There is a God, and one must be just."" There, then, is the universal religion established in all ages and throughout mankind. The point in which they all agree is therefore true, and the systems through which they differ are therefore false.

Of course all these men knew, as all modern presidential candidates know, that to admit to theological skepticism is political suicide. During Jefferson's presidency a friend observed him on his way to church, carrying a large prayer book. ""You going to church, Mr. J,"" remarked the friend. ""You do not believe a word in it."" Jefferson didn't exactly deny the charge. ""Sir,"" he replied, ""no nation has ever yet existed or been governed without religion. Nor can be. The Christian religion is the best religion that has been given to man and I as chief Magistrate of this nation am bound to give it the sanction of my example. Good morning Sir.""

Like Jefferson, every recent President has understood the necessity of at least paying lip service to the piety of most American voters. All of our leaders, Democrat and Republican, have attended church, and have made very sure they are seen to do so. But there is a difference between offering this gesture of respect for majority beliefs and manipulating and pandering to the bigotry, prejudice and millennial fantasies of Christian extremists. Though for public consumption the Founding Fathers identified themselves as Christians, they were, at least by today's standards, remarkably honest about their misgivings when it came to theological doctrine, and religion in general came very low on the list of their concerns and priorities--always excepting, that is, their determination to keep the new nation free from bondage to its rule."

I have just seen the most harrowing special on the effects of the Chernobyl disaster.

Every person in America should be made to watch this short documentary called ""Chernobyl Heart: An America Undercover"" which follows an Irish volunteer into the heart of the distaster zone to examine radiation levels and to speak with families.  But that was not the worst part...she is an administrator for an orphanage and she toured the ""mental asylum"" and showed some of the children that were afflicted with a plethora of illness(i).

WTF!  When this disaster happened, Russia would not acknowledge that it even happened let alone ask for help.  There are still people living in areas where the level of radiation is 1000 times higher than any place here in the U.S.

Here are some quick facts:
*Over 70% of the radiation fell on the people of Belarus. They have been exposed to radioactivity 90 times greater than that released by the Hiroshima	bomb &#8211; the highest known exposure to radiation in the history of the atomic age.

* Belarusian doctors identify the following effects from the Chernobyl disaster on the health of their people:
	* 2,400% increase in incidence of thyroid cancer throughout Belarus.
	* 10,000% increase in thyroid cancer in the Gomel region.
	* 250% increase in congenital birth deformities.
	* 100% increase in the incidence of cancer and leukemia.
	* 1,000% increase in suicide in the contaminated zones.

* 25% of prime Belarusian farmland and forests will remain dangerously contaminated from the decaying components of plutonium for the next 25,000 	years.

* 97% of the radioactive material from the Chernobyl plant remains inside the crumbling sarcophagus.

* According to a 2003 report by the Russian Atomic Energy Minister, Alexander Rumyantsev, ""the concrete shell surrounding the Chernobyl nuclear reactor is in real danger of collapsing at any time."" Russia's NTV network stressed ""the second Chernobyl disaster would be no less in scale than the first one."" If the protective shell crumbled ""radioactive dust would go into the air, pushing the cancer rate up.""

* To date, Belarus spends 25% of their annual national budget on Chernobyl relief.

* No compensation was given to Belarus, as there is no international law governing accidents of the nature that occurred at Chernobyl.

All I can say is WTF!?  There were children...could have been anyone's children...nick, wayne, me or even my future children...
Terrifying...

The wost part is that the people there have no choice.  They feel that this ""condition"" cannot be made better and that they must live and die in the contaminated aftermath of Chernobyl.  How fucking sad is that?

Damn we are lucky...everyone of us.

"event","As Republicans now have a mandate to prevent marriage between two people of the same sex, others of us have been busy drafting a Constitutional Amendment codifying all marriages entirely on Biblical principles. After all, God wouldn't want us to ""pick and choose"" which of the Scriptures we elevate to civil law and which we choose to ignore.

DRAFT OF A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO DEFEND BIBLICAL MARRIAGE:

* Marriage in the United States of America shall consist of a union between one man and one or more women. (Genesis 29:17-28; II Samuel 3:2-5)

* Marriage shall not impede a man's right to take concubines in addition to his wife or wives. (II Samuel 5:13; I Kings 11:3; II Chronicles 11:21)

* A marriage shall be considered valid only if the wife is a virgin. If the wife is not a virgin, she shall be executed. (Deuteronomy 22:13-21)

* Marriage of a believer and a nonbeliever shall be forbidden. (Genesis 24:3; Numbers 25:1-9; Ezra 9:12; Nehemiah 10:30, 2 Corinthians 6:14)

* Since marriage is for life, neither the U.S. Constitution nor any state law shall permit divorce. (Deuteronomy 22:19; Mark 10:9-12)

* If a married man dies without children, his brother must marry the widow. If the brother refuses to marry the widow, or deliberately does not give her children, he shall pay a fine of one shoe and be otherwise punished in a manner to be determined by law. (Genesis 38:6-10;
Deuteronomy 25:5-10)

* In lieu of marriage (if there are no acceptable men to be found), a woman shall get her father drunk and have sex with him. (Genesis 19:31-36)

Hopefully, this helps to clarify the finer details of the government's righteous struggle against the infidels and heathens among us.

"event","So I have decided not to push my children to go to college.  I know that I might get a few flame mail replies but just wait a second and let me finish.
After high school I got a job as a picture scanner/typist for News on Wheels.  I was stared at $10 per hour for 30 hrs a week.  After nine months I was making about $65k because I was the manager of the News of Wheels publications production.  I then started my own little business selling high-end printers, graphics stations, custom-built servers and software training.  I was doing well, so well that I thought my time was too valuable to go to school.  However I was unhappy with the 60hr work weeks and endless travel.
I resigned and sold my company and moved in with my grandfather and begged Loyola to take me back.  After sitting out a year I was re-admitted with 70% of my (originally 100% tuition and books) scholarship.
Blah, blah four years, two degrees and everything else later I am here in DC making shit money and I just feel cheated.
Why do we go to college anymore?  Only 25% of the population has a degree and only 10% has a master's degree.  After doing a quick fact check I found this quote, ""the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports the average annual wages in the U.S. as $36,764 for 2002. More recently, the White House reports that the average hourly earnings of nonsupervisory workers was $15.54 in March 2004.""  Guess where I fall in that salary range...I make around $30k and I have very little to show for my two very expensive papers that hang on my wall...I pay about $200 a month for those two fucking pieces of paper...
I am educated, motivated, intelligent, willing, what am I missing?  I am great at networking and I have been, hell that's how I got my damn job at NRL in the first place!  Is this normal?  Did our parents have this experience of being very poor with no job security and no real positive financial future?  
I have been unable to locate (in a very mercurial google search) any data on housing costs from 1975 as well as average wages from 1975. 
Weren't you always told to, ""GO TO COLLEGE!&#8221;? This next one is my favorite, ""Life will be easier for you, you will be able to find a better job, make more money and have a more full life...blah, blah...""

(I know that on average people with advanced education make more money over the course of their lifetime)

I just feel like I look forward to payday (so that I can take Kate to dinner or some small splurge) only to pay bills and become slightly depressed because I have no money to do the things that I should be able to do.

Does anyone else feel this way?"

"event","So I am enjoying my four day weekend by reading one of my <a href=""www.talkingpointsmemo.com"" target=""_new"">favorite blogs</a> and I discovered this quote, &#8220;Homosexuals are not monogamous. They want to destroy the institution of marriage,&#8221; Dobson said.  &#8220;It will destroy marriage. It will destroy the Earth.&#8221;

Who is this Dobson character?

I kept reading and I found this nugget of gold straight from this asshole's mouth, 'He also urged supporters in attendance to fast and pray on the Thursday and weekend before the Nov. 2 election and to go to the polls to elect Coburn to the Senate.
Dobson said a vote for Carson, &#8220;even if you think he&#8217;s right,&#8221; would be a vote for U.S. Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D.; Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass.; and Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont.
&#8220;Patrick Leahy is a &#8216;God&#8217;s people&#8217; hater,&#8221; Dobson said.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know if he hates God, but he hates God&#8217;s people.&#8221;

Ok, now I am really intrigued.

James Dobson, as Andrew Sullivan described him, ""the social policy director of the Bush administration.""

So I did a little 'investigate journalism' and came up with this.

What are the basic principles which form the foundation of Dobson's agenda? There are two which those close to him have observed. The first is the ""slippery slope."" In Dobson's world, whenever a person becomes involved in one vice or another, this will immediately send them into an inevitable downward spiral into depravity and sin. In this ""theory"" of morality, it isn't possible to engage in moderation in any activity Dobson regards as a sin - whether it's pornography or gambling or whatever is currently on his hit list. It is also clear that such activities will cause unavoidable and tremendous psychological harm to whomever engages in them.

Dobson's second principle is that once a person or an entire culture starts down that slippery slope, they are incapable of saving themselves. Since they weren't able to realize the danger they were getting into, apparently they won't be able to get themselves out of danger now. This is where James Dobson's role starts - to inform all of us just what we are doing wrong. In addition, it becomes the job of a ""Christian government"" to stop whatever it is that people are doing wrong and force them down the path of righteousness (as defined by Dobson, of course). Although we are blind, Dobson is not - and he will do everything he can to make sure that a new law is passed to save us.

And this is where the legislative efforts by religious-right zealots in the House of Representatives comes to play. For example, white children in white suburbs have shot other white children, the cause must be that the government of all has not promoted the religion of a few - thus, posting the Ten Commandments in school classrooms will stop the violence. It is curious, however, that Dobson never made similar arguments in response to the killing of black children by other black children all through the 1980s.

Agendas

And just what is Dobson's agenda, anyway? It is interesting that Dobson, like so many other religious leaders, has transformed his theological message into a political platform - implying all the way that in order to be a ""good Christian,"" you need to adopt their political platform and vote as they tell you. This is absurd on its face, and the attempt to identify conservative politics with conservative religion leads to serious contradictions. For example, Jesus' reported focus upon helping the needy and giving copiously to the poor might tend to align him with present-day Democrats. Jesus' message of sharing equally would even tend to place him in the camp of socialists, not capitalists.

Dobson's long-term goal appears to be to return America to the 1950s, when America was what he considered to be a simpler and more godly place. Many people on the religious right glamorize and romanticize the 1950s - this isn't surprising, since they are typically white male Protestants, exactly the group which was in control and on top in that time period. Clearly it hasn't occurred to Dobson that all of the tumult and strife of the 1960s - a decade loathed by people like him - got its start in the 50s. America's social problems in the 1950s were like an unlanced boil - ugly and festering, but politely ignored in the hopes of not offending and that it might go away on its own. The youth of the 60s, however, decided to lance that boil and treat the infections. This has made for an ugly wound - but one which has a better chance of healing right.

What is the status of blacks, women and other minorities today as compared to 50 years ago? Unquestionably better - but Dobson doesn't consult them when considering what is best for our country. This is a shame, but since his organization shows strong evidence of sexism and racism, it's not a shock. What is the status of basic freedoms and civil liberties today as compared to 50 years ago? Also unquestionably better - today people have much greater protection in expressing their opinions and ideas than they used to. But I'm not sure that Dobson really cares about that, since he seems to consider ungodly speech to be evil and worthy of repression.

The actual details of Dobson's agenda are perhaps too numerous to fully explore, but it's worth listing a few of them here for the sake of breadth. Dobson supports:

    * Right to Life Constitutional amendment
    * Christian teachings as a basis for public policy
    * Prohibition of doctor-assisted suicides
    * Constitutional amendment banning flag burning
    * Elimination of just about all civil rights programs and laws
    * More religion in public schools - like prayers, bible readings, etc.
    * Elimination of most environmental laws
    * Elimination of the Department of Education and the National Endowment for the Arts
    * More frequent use of the death penalty
    * Making divorce more difficult to obtain
    * Prohibition of pornography and anything with strong sexual themes
    * Women staying homes and raising babies instead of competing with men for jobs


We are seriously fucked if this guy is influncing duba in any way.  I could blame duba for our country going to shit but I am not.  I am blaming him for listening (or being strongarmed) by assholes such as this Dobson character...HA eliminate enviormental laws...HA...eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts...ASSHOLES!"

So wazzup?  There just hasn't been much going on here other than the daily routine: work, eat, sleep, repeat.  And the grind is killin me.  I really miss the student life but I am growing more accustomed to being responsible and shit.  Nevertheless I do hate the inflexibility of being an adult but I guess I will get over that.

On the job front I have been picked up at NRL for the remaining of my 50% of my salary!  So I have secured gainful employment until October 1 2005!  Anyway now that I am employed I have virtually no say when I have vacation time and now it looks as though I will not be able to go home to New Orleans for Thanksgiving...bummer man.  But, if I play my cards right I may be able to skip out for a couple of days at XXX-MAS.  I am such a tool..."

"event","So what is:
1) sloppy with green drippings
2) red and swollen
3) gets blown frequently

Survey Says!...
My nose

Yes, ladies and gents, my nose.  I have a sinus infection.  Must be due to the fact that I am experiencing my first Fall season.  See, in NO there were no seasons, just HOT and HOTTER.  So when we started getting temps in the 50s I knew I was in for a change.  With that said...I love the weather.  The crisp, brisk wind in the morning is perfect for waking my lazy ass up when I go outside.  But the day is still warm with highs in the 70s.  Beautiful.

Now onto more juicy news.  I went on a job interview Monday for <a href=""www.pharmsource.com"" target=""_new"">pharmsource</a> for the Research Analyst position...the company seems like a good fit for me and I would like the position.  There is only one snag, they may not be able to pay me what I need...they initially threw out $30,000 but that is really low for me.  After some discussion we agreed on a number but there was no outright offer of the job.  Alas, I think that I rocked at the interview and I think I have a great shot at the job!

and on a sad note all three of the contracts for the research at NRL have been terminated.  So there is very little chance of me securing a research position there.  So I checked with the Asst. Director of the center and let her know that I was now available for the IT job.  Maybe someone can tell me what to think about her reaction...She said (in a cheery, happy way) ""That's good to know!  Thanks!"" and that was it.  I really was hoping that she would give me more info.  I decided not to pursue it b/c I didn't want to piss her off and be annoying...yeah yeah I know.  

OH!OH! I have a gig!  And I may have an audition with the local semi-pro orchestra around here.  Check out <a href=""http://www.fairfaxsymphony.org/"" target=""_new"">Fairfax Orchestra</a> and see what they are playing...I am excited.  But I do not have a big horn.  They would want me to play on a big horn...so I called Doc this morning and got some ideas.  He suggested calling the Tuba Exchange and seeing if they would rent or rent to own because I have NO MONEY to buy a tuba...they are damn expensive too.  So I found out that Tuba Exchange has a Kalison CC Daryl Smith used for $4600 with a gig bag.  I have wanted that model horn since freshman year!  So Kate seems open to letting (I know what you are thinking but she is my fiscal conscience and I need that).  So let's see when they want me to audition and if I get the gig I will get that horn!!!  whew...I am out of gas"

Could it be the biblical deluge that is ensuing?  I guess it could be worse, like snowing or something like that but I am still holding out that people up here suffer from mass delusions when winter comes.

So Kate go ther car on Saturday.  Then we did the only thing a self-respecting new car owner should do.  We went on a roadtrip!  We went to Lancaster and Bird in Hand PA.  Oh ya, the Amish were cool.  We found a farm that sold fresh cheese and root beer and corn and shit. And we went to a winery and bought a shitload of wine!!!

On another note, this weekend was Kate's last (of freedom) before school starts.  We had a lazy weekend and just enjoyed being with each other.  Why do I get the feeling that this is the best part of my life?  I can't seem to stop my thoughts from drifting to our lazy days spent in bed, around the house, cooking for each other...I am a lazy bastard."

So a number of the staff (Eddie, Ellen and Terry) have been talking me up and the IT director is interested in having a formal sit down.  Pay you ask?  $55k with government benefits!

GO ME!"

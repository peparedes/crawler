"event","The oil company tugs would bring in a bunch of corpses, the work detail would offload them, the corpsmen would spray them with embalming fluid to keep them from falling apart, another detail would load them into deuce-and-a-halfs and the deuce-and-a-halfs would cart them off.  ""they're keeping them in some junior high gymnasium,"" Douglas informed Levine, ""ice all over the place.  Having a hell of a time identifying them.  Water screws up their faces or something.""  The smell of decay hung in the air, like vermouth, it seemed to Levine, after you'd been drinking it all night.  The death detail worked precisely, efficiently, like an assembly line.  Every once in a while one of the offloaders would turn aside to vomit, but the work flowed on smoothly."

"event","I can write the saddest poem of all tonight.

Write, for instance: ""The night is full of stars,
and the stars, blue, shiver in the distance.""

The night wind whirls in the sky and sings.

I can write the saddest poem of all tonight.
I loved her, and sometimes she loved me too.

On nights like this, I held her in my arms.
I kissed her so many times under the infinite sky.

She loved me, sometimes I loved her.
How could I not have loved her large, still eyes?

I can write the saddest poem of all tonight.
To think I don't have her. To feel that I've lost her.

To hear the immense night, more immense without her.
And the poem falls to the soul as dew to grass.

What does it matter that my love couldn't keep her.
The night is full of stars and she is not with me.

That's all. Far away, someone sings. Far away.
My soul is lost without her.

As if to bring her near, my eyes search for her.
My heart searches for her and she is not with me.

The same night that whitens the same trees.
We, we who were, we are the same no longer.

I no longer love her, true, but how much I loved her.
My voice searched the wind to touch her ear.

Someone else's. She will be someone else's. As she once
belonged to my kisses.
Her voice, her light body. Her infinite eyes.

I no longer love her, true, but perhaps I love her.
Love is so short and oblivion so long.

Because on nights like this I held her in my arms,
my soul is lost without her.

Although this may be the last pain she causes me,
and this may be the last poem I write for her."

"event","The time has come for sleep and things
to wait and see what dreaming brings.
Fret not, my over-anxious one,
someday the end will come,
and whether or not
you pray to have the lord your soul to keep
your heart will stop
and for your life they will weep
but you will rejoice in requiem
for finally being able to sleep."

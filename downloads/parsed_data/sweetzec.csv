i dont know what to think. i dont know what to say. i dont know what i even want anymore.
I thought i had it all. i thought that i had finally found something that was perfect. Yes the world perfect and how wierd is that to hear from me. but i dont know if i can do it anymore.
""If i'm so difficult that That has to happen then why why do i change around my world for this??"" i'm so confused and this weekend has been so horrible. i dont think i have gone more than an hour without sheding a tear. it's unbelievable teh hurt i have gone through. i just ache in every part of my body. i just want to talk to him. but then i dont. i dont know what i'm suppose to do.  i have reconnected with a lot of friends this weekend which has been good. One i haven't talked to for a while, she was soo what i needed at this time in my life. everything is so rough. i feel like my life is a secret and i feel like i never have anyone to talk to. everyone i think is my friend the second i feel sad or hurt ... where are they? They're never around. and that just adds to the sharp pains i have. 
Sometimes i wish i could go back home. but i dont really know what is there for me even there. i feel use less everywhere and i dont want anything. and nothing wants me. i hate these feelings i am having in my head. i wish for so much that i could make them disapear and get out of my head yet everynight they haunt me like the night before. its a lost cause and so am I. I cant handle this hurt
i just hurt so bad

Unwritten Law - Rest of My Life Lyrics 

""Am I the only one that feels alone 
Though, all is home 
Emotions flow 
Am I the only one that hears the tears run down my face 
Would anybody recognize at all 

Cause I know 
I'm so slow 
But I'm tryin 
And I'm still dyin to know 
Say you won't leave for the rest of my

Life's the only thing that deals the pain 
Like pouring rain down 
Breeding hate 
And I don't wanna do no wrong 
My God, it's been so long 
Please comfort me 
Before I go insane 

Cause I know 
I'm so slow 
But I'm tryin 
And I'm still dyin to know 
Say you won't leave for the rest of my life

I know 
I'm so slow 
But I'm trying 
And I'm still dying to know 
Say you won't leave for the rest of my life

I'm so slow
But i'm tryin
And i'm still dyin to know
Say you won't leave for the rest of my
I can't have you leave for the rest of my
Say you won't leave for the rest of my life""












Why wont you hold me anymore?!"

~Welcome to my life-simple plan~
""Do you ever feel like breaking down?
Do you ever feel out of place?
Like somehow you just don't belong
And no one understands you
Do you ever wanna run away?
Do you lock yourself in your room?
With the radio on turned up so loud
That no one hears you screaming
No you don't know what it's like
When nothing feels alright
You don't know what it's like to be like me
To be hurt
To feel lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked
When you're down
To feel like you've been pushed around
To be on the edge of breaking down
When no one's there to save you
No you don't know what it's like
Welcome to my life
Do you wanna be somebody else?
Are you sick of feeling so left out?
Are you desperate to find something more
Before your life is over
Are you stuck inside a world you hate?
Are you sick of everyone around?
With the big fake smiles and stupid lies
While deep inside you're bleeding
No you don't know what it's like
When nothing feels alright
You don't know what it's like to be like me
Welcome to my life
No one ever lies straight to your face
And no one ever stabbed you in the back
You might think I'm happy
But I'm not gonna be ok
Everybody always gave you what you wanted
You never had to work it was always there
You don't know what it's like
What it's like
To be hurt
To feel lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked
When you're down
To feel like you've been pushed around
To be on the edge of breaking down
When no one's there to save you
No you don't know what it's like
Welcome to my life""


why do i always see myself relating to these words,this song, i think i'm so happy,and i swear sometimes i am!! but there is always something pulling me down and i feel like i can never totally be happy anymore, and i hate it!! can't i stop these horrible feelings!?these horrible thoughts?they're ruining my life,ruining my relationships,ruining everything.

It's like i have a hidden life,i always have,but yet now it seems like no one actually knows anything about the real me, ive gotten so good at hidding it,people ask me how i'm doing, ""oh i'm great how are you"" but why cant i just say""horrible,i never sleep i feel like i always want to throw up and sometimes i just want to end everything,how are yoU?"" why can't i say that!? ohh probably because if i did people would think i'm even crazier than before. but honestly i dont care what anyone thinks anymore. I never know who to trust,who to confide in,and who truely cares about me or if they are just pretending for their own benefits anymore. All those friendship i thought i had.. well they were false but at least ive found out  now.

I'm tired of people blaming this on me,it's because you didnt' take your medicine,or you didn't tell the psychatrist everything  you should,but i cant help this, and believe me, if i could, i would in a heart beat. I see how i treat the people closest to me, and when i see it all again in replay and how i hurt them with my words,actions or short tolarance,i feel so bad but all i can do is try to defend myself even more. EHH. why is my life like this?

I've realized the real true people that are there for me, the people that call me everyday just to say hi,but really i know they are checking up on me. The people that even though it means i'll be six hours away from them look at my best interest instead of theirs, the people that will stay up to all hours of the morning when my hidden tears come pouring out.those are my true friends.

You- i told you everything, you told me things nobody else has ever known and i did the same, you always said you'd be there for me,but yet why now do i feel like just an inconvienance to you!? is that what a really friend is.. nO! and i've finally realized that. i love how your friendships and relationship are GREAT when it's convienent for yoU,but i'm tired of living on Your time and i've realized i have so many better people out there for me.. sorry for wasting your... oohh so precious time. whatever.

Wes- It's like you met this girl and  went to zips,some people had a little to much ""nyquil"" that night and acted like complete fouls and fell in love. Well i've never had so much fun in my life,and remembering those memories are my favorite thing ever. You found out about my problems and you didn't run. and i've put you in some pretty horrible situations but yet when i woke up in that hospital bed you were right there beside me,and i will never forget that. i appreciate you for putting up with everything this has put us through. I mean you're pretty stubborn but i think youve met your match in that catagory and i cant wait to continue on,thanks for always believing in me,and always pushing me on and helping me realize the important things around me.

Becca and Gina it's like we have been friends for years we've been through everything together awkward haircuts awkward boyfriends awkward""basketball talents"" but yet i feel like i have realized our friendships more in the last few months then ever before. you threatening to drive down and see me if i dont answer my phone and you always put a smile on my face and distract my mind from it's wondering thoughts and i am so greatful for it all, i feel like you guys are one of the only people i have anymore. and i love you guys so dearly.

This is a pretty pointless entry but i had a lot of things on my heart and some words i had to tell a few people.
Good Night and love

i appologize for any and everything i do."

"event","Things i've done (since i don't know how to BOLD!!):) 

Climbed a mountain 
Said ""I love you"" and meant it 
Hugged a tree
Stayed up all night long and watched the sun rise
Watched a huge sports game
Walked the stairs to the top of the Leaning Tower of Pisa 
Grown and eaten your own vegetables
Slept under the stars
Changed a baby's diaper
Gotten drunk on champagne
Given more than you can afford to charity 
Looked up at the night sky through a telescope
Had an uncontrollable giggling fit at the worst possible moment
Had a food fight
Bet on a winning horse 
Taken a sick day when your not actually ill 
Had a snowball fight
Screamed as loudly as you possibly can
Enacted a favorite fantasy
Taken a midnight skinny dip
Taken an ice cold bath
Seen a total eclipse
Ridden a rollercoaster
Hit a home run
Fit three weeks miraculously into three days
Danced like a fool and not cared who was watching 
Adopted an accent for the entire day 
Actually felt happy about you life even if it was just for one moment
Had amazing friends
Danced with a stranger in a foreign country
Stolen a sign
Backpacked in Europe
Taken a road-trip 
Been rock climbing 
Lied to foreign government's official in that country to avoid notice
Midnight walk on the beach
Been heart broken longer than you were actually in love
Alphabetized your records 
Pretended to be a superhero 
Sung karaoke 
Lounged around in bed all day
Kissed in the rain 
Played in the mud
Played in the rain 
Gone to a drive-in theater
Done something you should regret, but dont regret
Toured ancient sites
Loved someone you shouldn't have
Been Kissed so passionately it made you dizzy
Made cookies from scratch
Won first prize in a costume contest 
Ridden a gondola in Venice
Got flowers for no reason
Got so drunk you dont remember anything
Been to Las Vegas
Been on a cruise ship
Gotten into a fight while attempting to defend someone 
Called or written your Congressman/woman
Sang loudly in the car and didnt stop when you noticed someone was looking
Survived an accident that you shouldn't have survived
Broken someones heart
Ridden a motorcycle
Driven any land vehicle at a speed of greater than 100 mph/160 kph
Had a body part of yours below the neck pierced
Fired a firearm
Ridden a horse 
Eaten sushi
Had your picture in the newspaper
Changed someone's mind about something you care deeply about
Gotten someone fired for their actions
Gone back to school
Parasailed 
Apologized to someone years after inflicting the hurt 
Communicated with someone without sharing a common spoken language
Dyed your hair
Written your own role playing game
Eaten a lollipop as big as your face
White water rafted


wow.. all this showed me was how boring my life is ...dangit ha"

"event","ya that seems like the question i've gotten a lot. It's wierd, i haven't really written a lot since i've been here. A lot has happened good and bad, lets see if i can maybe sum it up...
Well FYI i come home on November 23rd yaya. and my birthday is on the 27th!!

Since i've been here, it's been pretty crazy, gotten myself into some things i really shouldn't have but i've pretty much been really good, even though SOME people didn't think i actually could.
The floor i live on is really close. Everyone is like family here, we wake eachother up in the morning eat and go out with eachother we do everything with eachother and it's really fun.
There's been a lot of drama, i feel like i'm back in high school, but what do u expect having this many people together 24/7.
I've met some really cool people, like wes.He's way cool and he actually makes me really happy
I haven't really talked to many people from home, some i really wish i could more, even though we had our little fight, and others well maybe  you and i WEREN""T suppose to talk anymore.
I love my sorority-Alpha Ahi- i havne't gone to a lot of the socials lately but i feel like it still takes up so much time, and it's really fun. Last night we had a costume part with the PHi delts.. i was definetly the nurse.
but honestly, there's all these times where it has been so fun, but i just had a total breakdown. And i actually ended up in the hospital because of my stupid mistake. My parents are very worried now and i might being getting sent home but i hope not, i'be been getting a lot of help... sometimes i just cant deal with it all.
I miss my family... i miss  my little cousin LIllian, she's the one person i just want to wrap in my arms and hold i love her more than anything and i hate being so far away.
P.S... it is soo totally cold here

well that's pretty much  my college expierence in a nutshell. i miss ya'll

oh ya and if anyone wants to send me mail.. haha i'm lonely :)(yes that would be ME begging.. how pathetic haha love ya)

"event","""Light In Your Eyes""
Blessed Union Of Souls

I can't remember the last time that we kissed goodbye
all our ""I love you's"" were just not enough to survive
Something your eyes never told me
But it's only now to plain to see
Brilliant disguise when you hold me
And I'm free

I've been thinking and here's what I come to conclude
Sometimes the distance is more than two people can use
But how should I have know girl
It was time and not space you would need
Darling tonight I could hold you and you would know
But would you believe

There's a light in you eyes that I used to see
There's a place in you heart where I used to be
Was I wrong to assume that you were waiting for me
There's a light in your eyes
Did you leave that light burning for me

Cards and phone calls and photograph pictures of you
Constant reminder of all the things you get used to
Is there a chance in hell or heaven
That there's still something here to build on
Or do you just pick up the pieces after they fall
But after all

There's a light in your eyes that I used to see
And a song in the words that you spoke to me
Was I wrong to believe in your melody
There's a light in your eyes
Did you leave that light burning for me

Should I keep on waiting or does love keep on fading away
Fading away

It's been a while since I've seen you so how have you been
Did you get my letter I wrote you, but I did not send
I tried to call your old number
But the voice that I heard on the phone
I recognized but she told me the number was wrong

There's a light in my eyes but it's too bright to see
And a pain in my heart where you used to be

Do you ever feel out of place?
Like somehow you just don?t belong
And no one understands you

Do you ever wanna run away?
Do you lock yourself in your room?

That no one hears you screaming

No you don?t know what it?s like
When nothing feels alright
You don?t know what it?s like to be like me

To be hurt
To feel lost
To be left out in the dark

To feel like you?ve been pushed around
To be on the edge of breaking down
When no one?s there to save you
No you don?t know what it?s like

Welcome to my life

Do you wanna be somebody else?
Are you sick of feeling so left out?
Are you desperate to find something more
Before your life is over

Are you stuck inside a world you hate?
Are you sick of everyone around?
With the big fake smiles and stupid lies
But deep inside you?re bleeding

No one ever lies straight to your face
And no one ever stabbed you in the back
You might think I?m happy 
But I?m not gonna be ok

Everybody always gave you what you wanted
You never had to work it was always there
You don?t know what it?s like
What it?s like

To be hurt
To feel lost
To be left out in the dark

What is with this!? why do i have to feel this way? I've tried to keep it hidden for so long from so many people, even the ones that i love, and it just seemed like hey if i pretend enough that i am not some deeply depressed person and just slap a smile on my face wouldn't that cancel it out.. maybe i would start believing the role i'm playing for everyone else. 
But you know it's hard and i can't anymore. and it did work, i felt great things were going great until the other night it all just seemed to hit me again. I can't explain how i feel, i dont' even know how i feel i just wish that for 5 minutes out of the day i could stop the tears from falling down my cheeks or the blank stares looking nowhere filled with horrible thoughts.
I don't know what started this all again. Maybe it's all the new stuff i am surrounding myself with or maybe it's the stuff i am now left out of, maybe the past, or even fear of the future. i dont know, and that is almost one of the worst fears ever.. not even knowing what is making you soo depressed, so sad you can't even go on with your day,so confused you sit there for hours with what seem like no thoughts running through your brain.
Maybe it's the fact that the one person that always helped me through this before, is gone, has left me and i don't think i can go through this alone.

""You're the lucky one
So i've been told
As free as the wind,
Blowin' down the road
Loved by many, hated by none

Not a care in the world
Not a worry in sight
Everything's gunna be alright
Cause you're the lucky one

You're the lucky one
Always havin' fun
A jack of all trades a master none
You look at the world with a smilin' eye
And laugh at the devil as his train goes by

Well you're blessed i guess
By never knowing which road your choosin.
To you the next best thing
To playin and winning is playin and losing

You're the lucky one i know that now
Don't ask you why, when, where, or how
You look at the world thru your smilin' eye

It's so wierd the mood  i am in, i feel like the only way to express my thoughts and feelings right now is through lyrics.
I hate this standstill point in my life it's soo hard to not try to unstick my feet and move.


""And i've lost my direction
Where do i turn?""

What if me wanting to go off and me wanting to be and do what i want to do is all a mistake and in the end i am going to fail terribly.. why can't i just know now before i have to deal with all the pain and heartache agaiN!??!

I need to leave and meet my new friends and see my old ones that are already gone. Is it bad that i want to get out of here so mucH and soo fast.. i feel kind of bad. I love it here but i hate it also in soo many ways for so many reasons. I will kind of miss being down here, i will miss some people soooo much!!! But then there are others, or certain others for that matter that i think would rather me leave. but whatever i guess it'll be a good thing.

""Standin 'round in a crowded room 
your face is here bring me back to you 
leaving town slips into my head again 
my friends say stay but I wanna go 
there's people here that I used to know 
to the situation that you put me in 
and I can tell myself that I will be gone 
you can rest assure that I will be home"" 

I hate the awkwardness between us.. when did it all go wrong like this.. i always htought we were friends now i dont even know you.

""I didn't know just what to say to you 
And didn't know just who to blame 
But I didn't want to face the days alone 
for the night I didn't get your name ""

Why do people always expect soo much more from me. I am what i am i can't be that perfect person you want me to be. I'm so tired of always pretending i'm happy.. because i am definetly not!!

""Fade into my life 
Never getting it right 
Risky fantasies 
Made for what you see, inside"" 


I love God so much and i love what he is doing in my life, but i always hate it because all it is causing is hurt and confusion.. eghh i'll get through this faze i know. I wish my friends would love you too...

""I've waited all my life
To cross this line
To the only thing thats true
So I will not hide
Its time to try
Anything to be with you
All my life I've waited

40 hours a week.. yuup that's me. I've never worked so much in my life!!!!! Somehow i went from ooh  10 hours to 40  like that, and it's crazy.

Tomorrow i work all day and night but my boss is letting me off early so i can go to Lsm weekend at least once.And I'm bringin my little cousin cuz i know she'd have fun too so that'll be cool.

I hate that you are gone and i want you to come back right now. I miss you guys so much. It's wierd, we didn't hang out much this summer yet i feel soo sad that you guys are soo far away now. I guess the realization that we are growing up and everyone is growing apart is actually kicking in now. You guys have fun bein Cougs. And come see me all the time.Is it wierd that i kind of feel left out that i'm not going there even though it was solely my decision.. sometimes i wish i just would have gone...
P.s. gina how did the breakup go?! oooh and it's not as fun without you spending hours at work with me everyday anymore.COME BACK!!!

On a good note.. my roomate and i have been talkin a lot lately and she is soo cool. We both dont knwo anyone at eastern so we decided we're just gonna make our room really cool and buy a big tv so people will like us.. hope it works!!

Life seems so wierd lately.I dont know how to explain it. My body feels numb like i dont even know who i am anymore. I almost feel really depressed like.. yet i dont know why i am so sad.

Sometimes i wish things could be how they used to be.. it was all so much easier back then.

So i'm  ready for our little beach escapade... let's do it!!!

I feel like i am being  pulled in all different directions and dont know if  I am making the right choices or not. IT seems like everything is just being thrown at me at once and all the sudden i'm suppose to get my act together and start deciding for myself for once..

I had a lot of fun also, it was really cool gettin to know all these new people.
and the worship... wow.. thats all i can say.

I got baptized yesturday morning and i think that was the greatest feeling i have ever experienced, words cant even describe how you feel those split seconds coming up from the water. It's like such a high.. or as becca would say.. like you're on christian crack .. ooh jeez.

WOw has the summer flown by soo fast, to bad everyone's leavin soon for college and i still have like eternity here, oh well i guess i'll try to make the best of it. I'm gonna miss you guys ooh so much!! cert cert.. does that still exist!??! ha

I just got home from Tahoe on sunday, that was pretty cool, i did a lot of things i had never done before. To me i think it's always good to try something at least once so then you don't have to be curious all the time. California was fun though and really hot, so i stayed inside alot ha.. what a loser. SO to bad but this summer is gonna be a joyous summer of me bein butt white the WHOLE time!! eh oh well.
I got to spend a lot of much needed time with my family which was really good sometimes i feel like we all come apart in so many ways and we just need to have time together to understand one an other. i also saw a lot of people i haven't seen for a while which was way cool.
OH man i went intertubing like everyday and my my arms hurt soo bad to even move OUCH!!

""Another sunny day in Californ-i-a
I'm sure back home they'd love to see it
But they don't know that what you love is ripped away
Before you get a chance to feel it

Back home I always thought I wanted so much more, now I'm not too sure
Cause sometimes I miss knowing someone's there for me and feeling free
Free to stand beside the ocean in moonlight
And light myself a smoke beneath the dark Atlantic sky

Another sunny day in Californ-i-a
I'm sure back home they'd love to see it
But they don't know that what you love is ripped away
Before you get a chance, before you get a chance to feel it

Everybody here is living life in fear of falling out of line
Tearing lives apart and breaking lots of hearts just to pass the time
And the eyes get red in the back of your head, this place will make you blind
Put it all behind me and I'll be just fine

Another sunny day beneath this cloudless sky
Sometimes I wish that it would rain here
And wash away the west coast dreaming from my eyes
There's nothing real for them to see here

Another starry night in Californ-i-a
I'm sure back home they'd love to see it
But they don't know that what you love is ripped away
Before you get a chance, before you get a chance to feel it"" -yellowcard

Last night i hung out with my ex boyfriend which who i haven't talked to in a while and it was soo good to just be able to sit there and talk and be real with eachother. I wish it could all be so simple and everyone could be real all the time.. why is that soo hard for some people?!

So my parents are out of town yet again.. kind of crazy because they are ooh soo anal and overprotective, im soo suprised they actually are letting me stay here, it's good to have a break and be free to do what you want without them breathing down your neck and telling you who you should be and how you should act instead of letting you make your own choices... and I LOVE IT!!

It is soo stinkin HOT here!! ehhh

So this week has been eventful i've had my all time low and high all in 5 days. I spent the week up at Gonzaga with my sister and her friends. That was pretty cool meeting a bunch of new people.

I learned soo much on that trip though, about people, words, actions and just life in general.

Maybe people do the wrong things sometimes but do u ever think that there is an underlying ( i think thats the word) message to all those actions, maybe other peoples actions lead them to those things...???

I hate how sometimes people are soo secretive about things and they end up lying to the rest of the world.. even their best friends, i just dont understand it.

I did my testing today up at Eastern, that was cool i got to meet a lot of the other freshman, it's going to be soo much fun next year i can't wait. and i got my classes... i definitly have a class everyday at 8 in the morning.. eeek!!"

When is it time that you can call it quits, throw the white flag up in the air and give up. I've tried so hard to not let everything going on around me to acutally get to me. Me being a sensitive person it was really hard and actually have broken down a couple times to my real friends.

I'm so done it's unbelievable. Why would i want to be around all those people if all they do is talk bad about me? and alot of the things that are said aren't even true. I thought you guys were suppost to be the nice people?


Everyone always talks about, love everyone no matter what, don't judge and so on. So why don't you guys practice it.. especially to fellow christians?
I never did anything wrong,nobody even knows my side, or my thoughts, or even me, but yet i'm such a horrible person and you can't talk to me and *shock* if someone actually does you guys like practicly scold them for doing so.

That is horrible, am i supppost to cry at night because my ""church family"" is so unbelievably mean to me? I mean no you guys don't hit or throw rocks at me or anything, ha thank God, but you're words and your actions towards me are killing.

And I'm totally done with all that, i can find somewhere, some other place where the people genuinely care about people and it's not just something they say.

""Actions speak loud, but so do your words""

It really sucks because i have never felt closer to God than i have through all the sermons i have heard and some of the people i have come across but i have also never been soo shun off because of hte people, that are following him.

Yesturday was my last day of high school.. i can't believe I am graduating.. i'm a college kid now.. eehhh. i don't think i can handle all that ""growing up"".
School was good. but really sad at the end when we all realized that it was the last time we'll ever really all be together, call us stupid but thats major saddness.
Then we went to Lewisville for beef day... man beef day.. something always goes down there its crazy.**Gina, I really missed you and matt not bein there, cuz of course you had to have your OWN last day partay.. thanx alot haha.. ciert ciert.
Then the girls and i just hung out all day.. ya ya that was fun.
Then i had to drive all the way out to freakin who knows where and hung out with lindsey and dustin which was fun... 
**someday i'm gonna be a drummer.. you just wait and see :)**

Graduation's on monday Ya ya!!


**Why do your actions and words never match up with eachother??Why do i fall into your traps so often? Last straw is coming near...P.s... you will never know what Ciert Ciert means.. hahah maybe someday.. if you're lucky**haha :)



I really want to go to the rose festival.. i dont really even know what it is but it sounded fun!!! i think i'm gonna go.


Gina : You mean so much to me  and i hope someday i am able to show you how much you really do mean to me, you are so great and i am so glad everything i have ever gone through is with you, i dont know what i would ever have or will do without you. 

So emotional i think in the last couple days i have seriously cried over 10 times.. why am i doing this!?!?

Something Corporate Konstintine makes me so sad.. it makes me remeber everything...

""this is because i can spell confusion with a K and i like it,it's to dyin in anothers arms, and why i had to try it, it's to jimmy eat world and those nights in my car, when the first star you see may not be a star, IM NOT YOUR STAR, 
Isn't that what you said?
what you thought this song meant
And if this is what it takes, just to live with my mistakes and live with what i did to you and all the hell i put you through,i always catch the clock it's 11:11 and now you want to talk, it's not hard to dream, YOU'LL ALWAYS BE MY KONSTINTE.
hey, maybe, baby you could keep me up in bed, my konstinitie
 you spin around me like a dream we played out on this movie screen,and i said  did you know i missed you?did you know i missed you? did you know i missed you? i miss you
and then you bring me home,
 and we go to sleep but this time not alone,
and you'll kiss me in your living room, and i know you missed me.""

But ya know.. maybe bein too high school isn't such a bad thing,i would rather have fun and enjoy what i am doing now before it's too late and i can't anymore because i was trying to be too grown up and proper.!!! I love it!!!

why do i want something that doesn't want me.. like does that even make sense, i dont know, maybe i've had my blinders on and couldn't see what was going on right in front of me.. it was pretty pathetic but that's cool i've learned from my mistakes and i think that was the underlining message for all that heart ache.

Ok so i heard this song today and it jsut brought me back to the good ol' days :

""He's a cold-hearted snake
Look into his eyes
Oh oh oh
He's been tellin' lies
He's a lover boy at play
He don't play by rules
Oh oh oh
Girl don't play the fool--no

You're the one givin' up the love
Anytime he needs it
But you turn your back and then he's off
and runnin' with the crowd
You're the one to sacrifice
Anything to please him
Do you really think he thinks about you
when he's out

He's a cold-hearted snake
Look into his eyes
Oh oh oh
He's been tellin' lies
He's a lover boy at play
He don't play by rules
Oh oh oh
Girl don't play the fool--no

It was only late last night
He was out there sneakin'
Then he called you up to check that you
were waiting by the phone
All the world's a candy store
He's been trick or treatin'
When it comes to true love girl with him
there's no one home

You could find somebody better girl
He could only make you cry
You deserve somebody better girl
He's c-cold as ice

He's a cold-hearted snake
Look into his eyes
Oh oh oh
He's been tellin' lies
He's a lover boy at play
He don't play by rules
Oh oh oh
Girl don't play the fool--no""

Man oh man that reminds me of dance class, i used to be obsessed with Paula abdul!!!


Last night was.. interesting. Trevor and i hung out all day after i got off work and we were so bored we just slept all day (ya.. we're REALLY cool). we realized we really don't have any friends haha. then nelea called and asked if we wanted to go to a movie and it was seriously a world record how fast we got there we were soo excited to actually be doin somethin haha but that was fun we sawthat day one.. day after tomarrow.. possibly.. it was actually good!! After almost gettin attacked at a minute mart after, we decided to head home.. yup that was my cool saturday.. ok no.

Um.. 4 days what?!:)

I think i'm gonna go to church and then ya.. gina i dont know if i am gonna go to that party at lindsey's or not.. it kinda depends on some things, maybe i'll just got for a lil and make my appearance ( ya that sounded stuck up) but anyways, hey are her parents there?

Nelea, so even though you have changed since your new mr. John i still lovve you lil' bean but it kinda makes me sad that we dont talk like every 6 seconds lately , but it'll all be good.

Summer... ya baby. Ya Gina i know we gotta get on it about Tahoe but i hate planning so i'm not going to. If you guys wanna go you plan it and call me up and i'll pack my bags.. just don't make me plan!!!!!:) just think, layin on the beach, gettin tan.. with cabanna boys!?(just a thought) ha ok well it's not some exotic beach but hey.. we could pretend.

why do i let people play with my emotions??

I'm goin to the dashboard concert on wed, i'm so excited!!!! (hey gina wanna go? 
""We're not 21, but the sooner we are the sooner the fun will begin, so get out your fake eyelashes and fake id's and real disasters ensue, it's cool to take these chances, it's cool to fake romances.. AND GROW UP FAST!!"" 
( remind ya of our lil' beach triP??:)

Pray for me, pray for you, pray for everyone!!"

Yellow card-
Broken this fragile thing now
And I can't, I can't pick up the pieces
And I've thrown my words all around
But I can't, I can't give you a reason

I feel so broken up 
And I give up  
I just want to tell you so you know

Here I go, scream my lungs out and try to get to you
You are my only one
I let go, there's just no one that gets me like you do
You are my only, my only one

Made my mistakes, let you down
And I can't, I can't hold on for too long
Ran my whole life in the ground
And I can't, I can't get up when you're gone

And something's breaking up 
I feel like giving up
I won't walk out until you know

Here I go so dishonestly
Leave a note for you my only one
And I know you can see right through me
So let me go and you will find someone

Here I go, scream my lungs out and try to get to you
You are my only one
I let go, there's just no one, no one like you
You are my only, my only one"

"event","What a weekend.. no.. what a week.
I'm so very exhausted but the day of tomarrow is greatly appreciated. day off whoot whooot!!!
I love my new job but it feels like i almost live there.. that actually would be pretty cool tanning 24/7 and a candy machine with Mike&Ikes.. i could deal.
Ok wait so i just lied.. they just called me in to work tomarrow... jeez louise

So lot has been goin on this week, i don't really know where to start, so i don't think i am going to at all. but it was goood!:)

""Never underestimate my Jesus 
You're telling me that there's no hope 
I'm telling you, you're wrong 
Never underestimate my Jesus 
When the world around you crumbles 
He will be strong He will be strong""

This song is  what's been on my mind lately because i was soo frusterated and fed up with everything going on around me and i didn't know what to do but then i gave it to God and i just asked him to do whatever his will was for the situation and it's turned out great so far.. YaY God!:)

So i met this new kid and i've actually been hangin out with him a lot lately..should i call him *bob* for hillary's sake...keep it a mystery haha :). But anyways, he is someone i never thought I would be hanging out with, but everyday i get to know him a lil more and i just think he is soo freakin awesome, i  love how my life is goin right now. I love meeting new people.

And i also love my friends that are always there for me, it kinda saddens my heart about the ""girls night"" thing.. nelea gina you know what i'm talkin bout, just cuz i do feel like now i don't have much time, and i'm not dating someone in the group so it's liek girls night.. but then its always with hte guys also and i just feel.. whats the words whats the word.. outta place almost, who knows. but i heart you girls and i always will... 12 days what what!?

I also love it when you finally just have everything out in the open with eachother and stop hidding stupid little things it just makes you feel better. ** I'm glad we had that talk saturday night, i think it was long over due and it helped figure out a lot of things in my head, i'm so glad that we're friends. And know that i am always here for you... p.s. I'm still mad you killed my fish, you stinkin loser!!!! 

So i decided toamrrow is going to be SSSOOOO hot.. well i can always hope.

Much love

Ciao Bella.. I think i wanna go back to Europe.. road trip girls?!( ok i know you have to go by plane but what else do you call it?)

P.s. if you ever wanna know, the way to a girls heart is ICE CREAM!!! Yum, i'm gonna go have some

Ohhh and bobby.. i made this long JUST FOR YOU!! since i know yoU LOVE it when they are soo long and you get to hear about EVERY detail in my preciously boring life.. YAY YOU!!:)"

Something Corporate - Hurricane
Shake down you make me break for goodness sake
I think I'm on the edge of something new with you
Shout out don't drown the sound
 I'll drown you out
You'll never scream so loud 
as I want to scream with you
Standing there with your smile blinding your eyes
From seeing my face as I'm dying to figure out a girl
But she drifts so far away 
I'm on her coast so maybe I should stay
 and map around your world
So dont say these currents are still killing me 
and you can't explain
 but the wind went and pulled me into your hurricane 
into your hurricane
Stand up don't make a sound 
your ears might bleed 
there's sweet flourescent enemies that live inside of me
The world moves faster than I knew 
not fast enough to not creep up on you 
and the space we put between
 so pull me under your weather patterns
 your cold fronts and the rain don't matter 
because a SUNBURNS WHAT I NEEDED
so don't say these currents are still killing me 
and you can't explain
 but the wind went and pulled you into the hurricane 
into the hurricane

you dont do it on purpose but you make me shake
 now ill count the hours till you wake
 with your babies breath 
breathe symphonies
 come on sweet catastrophe
 well maybe this time i can follow through
 i can feel complete s
top paying dues stop the rain from falling keep my ocean calm 
this time i know nothings wrong 
so dont say these currents are still killing me 
and you cant explain 
but the wind went and pulled me in 
and no you dont say these currents are still killing me 
and you cant explain but the wind went 
and pulled me into your hurricane into your hurricane 
into your hurricane 


Something  Corporate - Konstantine

I can't imagine all the people that you know
and the places that you go
when the lights are turned down low
and I don't understand all the things you've seen
but i'm slipping inbetween
you and your big dreams

it's always you
in my big dreams

and you tell me that it's over
wake up lying in a patch of four leaf clovers
and your restless, and i'm naked
you've gotta get out
you can't stand to see me shaking
no
could you let me go?
I didn't think so

and you don't wanna be here in the future
so you say the present's just a pleasent interruption to the past
and you don't wanna look much closer
cuz your afraid to find out all this hope
you had sent into the sky by now had crashed
and it did

because of me
and then you bring me home

afraid to find out that you're alone
and i'm sleeping in your living room
but we don't have much room to live

I had these dreams that i learned to play guitar
maybe cross the country
become a rock star
and there was hope in me that i could take you there
but dammit you're so young
well i don't think i care

and if i hurt you
then i'm sorry
please don't think that this was easy
then you bring me home
cuz we both know what it's like to be alone

and i'm dreaming in your living room
but we don't have much room to live
and konstantine is walking down the stairs
doesn't she look good
standing in her underwear

and i was thinking
what i was thinking

we've been drinking and it doesn't get me anywhere
my Konstantine came walking down the stairs
and all that i could do is touch her long blonde hair
and i've been thinking
it hurts me thinking that these nights
when we were drinking no they never got us anywhere
no

this is because i can spell konfusion with a k
and i like it

it's to dying in another's arms and why I had to try it
it's to jimmy eat world and THOSE NIGHTS IN MY CAR
when the first STAR you see may not be a star
I'm not your star
isn't that what you said
what you thought this song meant

and if this is what it takes
just to LIE in my mistakes
and live with what i did to you
and all the hell I put you through

I always catch the clock
IT'S 11:11
and now YOU WANT TO TALK 
it's not hard to dream

you'll always be my konstantine
konstantine, they'll never hurt you like i do
no they'll never hurt you like i do
no, no, no no no no no no

this is to a girl who got INTO MY HEAD
with all the pretty things she did
hey
you know

YOU KEEP ME UP IN BED
this is to a girl who got into my head
with all the f'd up things i did

hey
maybe
baby
you could keep me up in bed
my Konstantine
spin around me like a dream we played out on this movie screen
and i said
DID YOU KNOW I MISSED YOU?
Did u know i missed you?
did u know i missed you?
did u know i missed you?

oh god i miss you
and then you bring me home
and we'll go to sleep, but this time, not alone, no no
and you'll kiss me in your living room
i know

you'll miss me in your living room
cuz these nights i think maybe that i'll miss you in my living room

we don't have much room
i said does anybody need that room?
because we all need a little more room
to live
my Konstantine"

I hate it. i know the sayin "" let go and let God"" but for some reason it just seems so hard to not think about it.

I think i have the greatest friends, they are so sweet no matter what it is they are there for me to dry my tears to bring me cold stone or just to even visit me if i am scared. They are so great and i just wish i could give back what they have given to me but i dont even know where to start.

So my dear friend Nelea, i have been badgering and begging and prayin that she would come to lsm with me some night but it so convienently works out that she always has to work on wed. and that makes me so fetchin ( that was just for you gina ha) MAD!! i know that she would just love it and it would help her to get rid of all the stress and the hurt she has so please pray for my dear friend. i love her lots.

Tree 63 - The Answer To The Question


I'm growing tired of a mouth shut tight
When all I want to do is
Tell the whole world about the man sitting
At the right hand of the One in heaven
How could I sing
About anything but him?
CHORUS:
He is the answer to the question
He is the cure for the infection
He is all he says he is
He is the ultimate reflection
Of holiness and true perfection
He is all he says he is
How can I not cry?
Watching as the world dies
Without a prayer
Then run to their own gods, roughshod
Blind to the living God of earth and heaven
How could they sing
Of everything but him?

So, my favorite friend Gina got a live journal and i'm way excited cuz i love that kid to death. So ya if ya ever wanna talk to her her thing is ginamarie123.She's reallly really nice and pretty darn cute also. ha :) CIERT CIERT!!


SIDE NOTE: The other day Hillary wrote in her journal and someone seemed like they got mad and said somethin kinda mean and all hillary had done was write how she was feeling or what she was thinkin.. isn't that hte whole point of these live journals?! but it was pretty cool how many people stood up for her.. that was way cool!!

We'll i think i'm actually gonna start my homework *SHOCK*

Hopefully I'll see everyone tonight!! :)"

"event","Hey!!
I'm at work. Just realized i haven't written in a while.
So much has gone on in what seems like such a short amount of time.
So if anyone is wondering... i did end up going to Prom even though i wasn't really in the best mood. A lot happened that morning.
All the girls met at brewed to talk and of course nelea overslept and wasnt there and we all flipped out worried but it was all good. Then all the girls went to Becca B's because someone thought about the great idea of wearing fake eyelashes to the dance (not a good idea i'll explain later)
I had to go to work for Oasis so i couldn't hang out with everyone for that long but when i got to work i just started feeling way sick. I didn't know seeing someone could actually make you sick, i always thought it was just a saying.. who'd a known!?!? Anyways so i talked to *Joe* for a little while while i was there and that just made me sad and want to cry so i left.
My hair for prom was soo funky, there was like fake blond and maroon  strands in it.. dont ask.. i got a lot of compliments on it even thoug my dad said i looked like someone from starwars.. didn't get the encouraging kinda dad i can tell you that much.
While getting my hair done all i could think about was this one certain thing and it upset me so bad that i just really REALLY didn't want to go to the dance even though i knew i would have a great time.
Finally a lil bit before my date got there i decided i should get ready but i was still in the bad mind frame but i knew i would regret it and that would be hard core mean if i was just like oh sorry im not going anymore.

So my date luke  came and we got a million pictures takin.. i never knew your face could actually hurt from smiling to much.. proven fact!!
Then we went to the school and met all 24 people in our limo. we had the exursion limo it was soo cool. Even with all those people it wasn't crowded. 
We had a nice dinner at hte chart house and then went to the dance.
The dance was so great, everyone looked so beautiful it was a sureal how  magical everything was.
After a bunch of my friends realized that this was our last dance they started crying, even though they were probably good tears i always feel so bad.Because they always think that we all wont stay together through college even though we've been together forever but i guess i just think that we will so it doesn't bother me as much, but dang does my friend Nelea cry.. she sees a tassle and she starts crying.. how is she ever gonna get through her speech on grad night..we'll see.
After the dance we pretty much just drove around for a long time, then the driver took us to what i thought was a prison but it was really just a really nice outlook for portland. 
Then we went over to Gina's which sooo many people were there. i went for a lil while but then i just started feeling way sick again  and just felt like i couldn't be there anymore.. but it was pretty crazy.

So don't you wish that people could just be how  you first thought they were, when you think that they are so great and you want to spend all your time with them.. then what happeneds..?? I've been having to deal with all that a lot lately and it's really stressful.

I gotta close now though, so i'll continue this long novle later..

"event","what a day i am soo exhausted. i just want to curl up and go to sleep here. So i am definitly getting sick and i definitly have prom tomarrow that would suck if i threw up on my date, eh.

Today the girls and i went to all 5 periods at school.. Go US!! :) Then we went to the tanning place for one last chance for color but i didn't go. I dont like tanning anymore, it's too boring layin in the beds. But i did learn how to spray tan today, so maybe soon i can start doing that at work, kinda excited!!
Then we got our nails touched up and perfecto!!
Oh Boys soccer... beat Battle Ground tonight.. Prairie boys got first in district.. we're like the best at every sport jeez  (except for football but that doesn't count)
It was so cold at the game tonight.and we had to sit on the wet grass not to fun.
I also went shoppin tonight, and im not a big fan of shoppin so i'm a little worn out.

Prom's tomarrow and it's gonna be an ongoin stressful day. So the girls decided to meet at brewed for coffee to start it off right. Then i have to work, get my hair done, do more shoppin, pick up my dress and get ready eeek exhausting just thinkin about it, i dont even want to go.

After Prom we're all stayin at Gina's which'll be fun but also means no sleep and i have to work from 10-6 the next morning.. eeek!

Ok, i dont even know what i'm writin I'm so tired so yaa if you just read all of this I am SOO sorry :)
But have a  great saturday! can't wait till sunday

Muah Muah

I'm just not used to the whole goin to school the whole day kinda scene, haven't done it in over 2 weeks!! I've decided maybe waking up at 8:00 everyday just isnt the thing for me...
School was pretty cool though, nothing real exciting. We're watchin Jonah in Bible Lit, so that's fun 

And it was the prom assembly today.It's kinda a different prom court this year, none of my friends are on it and some of the people on it ive never even heard of, but i think that's way cool cuz it gives them a chance instead of having the same people win everytime, plus they get a cute lil crown!! :)

After school the girls and i went to the Doctor.. haha.. boy was that interesting.. Gina I can't wait to have C's!!! :) haha i really hope nobody else understands that.. :)

So I decided today was gonna be a day of pampering.. i mean getting all this stuff ready for prom can be stressful :)... so my mom and i HAD to go to the spa and we HAD to get massages  and hey while we were at it why not a facial and get the nails done the whole 9 yards ha, it was fun.
Then we went shoppin for some new outfits, summer just makes me happY!!

So Prom.. i was excited till i realized it's this weekend and nothing is ready... so i decided that they don't make dresses for short people anymore, mines getting fixed and its seriously 6 inches to long.. its crazy!! oh and I need some money... see im on this new high where im trying to pay for everything on my own except it's kinda hard considering the fact that i DONT HAVE A JOB!!! but i'm workin on that.. P.S... my dearest friend derek I still owe you 15 bucks but i promise i had it on sunday but noo you had to work.. someday friend i will get out of debt with you :).

Oh I have an interview on wed. I'm so excited. i want this job so bad!!It's at a tanning place and  It's just a fun place, like everyone that comes out is in a good mood i mean How great is that?!?!plus everyone that works there goes to living hope so thats fun. But my interview is on wed night so i have to miss youth group which kinda stinks,actually it stinks a whole lot!!

So there is definitly 30 days till i graduate and i am SOOO ready, but also a lil nervous it'll be good though. Ready to live in Spokane.. yaya :)

So um i decided i love it when it is nice out. Everyone is in sucha great moods and  I LOVE IT!! and i love you God.

Paul Wright- Your love never changes
""I'm tired of falling on my face Lord Get up tell myself 
 I'm tired of singing the same songs Na na na na  I'm so high I'm so low 
I'm so hot I'm so cold
 I'm so young but I'm feeling so old 
I'm at peace I'm at war 
I want less I want more 
I want it all but I don't know what it's for 

And all that I am is all that you see 
When nobody is looking at me I fall to my knees you're calling my name 
And you love me just the same
Because your love never changes
No Yea you love me just the same 
 Cuz your love never changes 

I'm back on the right track again I'm back hanging with the right friends I'm back on my feet again Kicking back
 I'm so high I'm so low 
I'm so hot I'm so cold
 I'm so young but I'm feeling so old 
I'm at peace I'm at war
 I want less I want more
 I want it all but I don't know what it's for 

Yea you love me just the same 
 Yesterday today tomorrow everyday 
 Yea you love me just the same 
 Yesterday today tomorrow everyday 

And you love me just the same  Your love never changes Because your love never changes  no! Your love never changes Yea you love me just the same whoa! Your love never changes Because your love never changes no! ""

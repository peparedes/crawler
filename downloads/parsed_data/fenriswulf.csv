"event","It's difficult when you love someone but you find you can't agree with them over core beliefs.  It's difficult because you <i>want</i> to compromise but don't possibly know <i>where</i> or <i>how</i> to do so since it's kind of like trying to remodel a house by removing the walls.  Who we are is who we are and while some things can be changed and modified, other things cannot.  I guess I'm writing this because I have someone very dear to me who is going through a bit of a difficult time with their significant other.  I see it happening and want things to be good for them both but just don't know how to tell them to make it so.  Oh well.  Sometimes life can really just suck."

"event","Well, it's been so long since I've written.  There's just been so much happening in my life, I haven't really had time to sit down and think about it all - much less write.

The biggest thing to happen (of course), has been Beth's moving in with me.  This has been kind of an adjustment for both of us (I think), but one which (I hope), has made us both happier.  For me, the hardest part has been learning to live in a suddenly non-Spartan home and having to watch Donald Trump's bad hair at least once a week.  For Beth, I assume the hardest part has just simply been having to live with me <i>because of</i> my Spartan ways.   (Before Beth moved in, the house was kept clean.....in virtually every sense of the word.  I had two paintings on the walls [one of two grouse in a wood and one of bears dancing in a wood - so obviously I just reak with artistic sensitivity], no carpets and good, solid Anglo-Saxon white walls throughout.  Now I've got a canary yellow bedroom, scarlet shades, paintings of sleeping women, wood nymphs and women in leather cracking whips [that'd be Bettie Page]).  Yep, life has certainly changed.

In other ""news"",  I'm still working at a Orlando-based law Firm it looks as if I will be moving further North in the near future after having had (what appears to have been) a successful interview with a Tallahassee-based Firm.  They seem much nicer than the people I am currently working for (who have a reputation throughout the community as being the most cutthroat Firm in the Orlando area).  (I have told Beth that the biggest reason for moving and taking the Tallahassee job would be to put us much closer to her parents - but in truth, I just want to escape from the yellow bedroom and figured I'd also ""accidentally"" lose a few of the more girly furnishings in the process of moving, lol.)

::laughs::  So there it is - three months of writing inactivity and all I can come up with are four crummy paragraphs.  Talk about laboring like a mountain to produce a mouse."

"event","I've not really written anything substantial in a little while.  Not because I've not had much to say (although that would certainly qualify as a reason), but because I was so offended by the fact that someone had attempted to ""hijack"" Beth's LJ that it sort of put a damper on my spirits.  Although this person posed as a <i>bona fide</i> ""hacker"", I saw little in the way of genuine evidence to support this conclusion (especially since he/she generously ""chose"" to return Beth's LJ to her control <i>after</i> she had successfully changed her password (all while the ""hacker"" was frantically attempting to find out what the new password was going to be).  Uh huh.  Oh well, past history.

Anyway, last weekend was pretty nice.  Beth and I went to see Big Yellow Momma play and I'll say there was some serious guitar work going on there.  Eric really is good (which I already knew since I've got his demo in my cd player - but live is different).  The surprise was Caleb.....::laughs::  I don't mean that at all the way it probably just sounded.  He's more important to the band sound-wise than I expected.  I mean, I pretty much expected the band to be guitar-driven and it was - but he was able to lay down a steady and discernable beat that more than held its own with the guitar.  There's little in the way of creative suggestions I could make apart from repeating what I said to Caleb that they ought to write their songs down (::laughs::...of course, not doing so doesn't seem to have hurt them any).  I guess this is a result of my having been a music major in undergrad (a major I loathed and quit), where you were taught that writing songs required carefully constructing the chords, rhythms, et cetera.  In fairness, it could also be a result of my own admittedly weak song-writing skills.  The only way I was ever able to do it <i>was</i> to sit there constructing songs note-by-note, phrase-by-phrase (and usually in c major since it was easier than any of the others).  I never had the talent Eric, Caleb or Patrick seem to possess.

Beyond the above, I'm home this weekend because of business stuff.  This really has me kind of depressed (a rarity for me - I can usually find something cheerful in a trainwreck....actually, a lot cheerful......actually, I might be a little bit sick).  The depression is not my own, but that doesn't make it any less real.  Wish I believed in drinking.  Oh well, time to go do ""he-man"" stuff (e.g., cut the grass)."

"event","Narcissistic Personality Disorder is included in the Cluster B personality disorders. Antisocial, borderline, and histrionic personality disorders are also part of this cluster. 

All of the cluster B personality disorders have an excessive sense of how important they are. Their demands upon others is excessive in that they expect admiration and thrive on praise. None of these personality disorders have the capacity to see other's perspectives. 

With the possible exception of antisocial personality disorder, the other diagnoses in this cluster are characterized by their chaotic lives, emotions, and relationships.  The presence of intense emotionality in these patients has led some observers to postulate a primary link between the Cluster B disorders and mood disorders. 

Hysteroid dysphoria, the proposed subtype of atypical depression characterized by narcissistic personality features and rejection-precipitated depressions, are also side effects of the Cluster B disorders. NPD is midway between the profound chaos of borderline personalities and the less destructive features of histrionic patients.

CLUSTER B PERSONALITY DISORDERS

	Histrionic: self-dramatization; over concern with attractiveness; 
tendency to irritability and temper outbursts if attention seeking is 
frustrated

	Narcissistic: grandiosity; preoccupation with receiving attention; 
self-promoting; lack of empathy; intense rage if angered

	Antisocial: lack of moral or ethical development; inability to follow 
approved models of behavior; deceitfulness; shameless manipulation of 
others; history of conduct problems as a child

	Borderline: impulsiveness; inappropriate anger; drastic mood shifts; 
chronic feelings of boredom; attempts at self-mutilation or suicide"

"event","::sigh::  Well, today I took my first day off from work in a little over three years.  Of course, it was all ruined when, at approximately 11:30 a.m., my secretary calls me on my cellphone to tell me my boss was demanding I be in his office within 30 minutes to be screamed at about something (something he does with a good deal of frequency to all his employees - as a result, turnover runs at around 50% in my office for attorneys).  Given that I was approximately 7 hours away at the time, this only served to further enflame my boss........who promptly called me up to scream into the phone about how I need to always be available and how he was going to ""get to me"" tomorrow.

I mean, it's usually never anything significant with him, but that doesn't change how upsetting and frankly depressing it is.  I'm so tired of working at a job where you're treated badly and made to feel worthless for no good reason.  It's extra hard since I don't want to be in this job (or location) anyhow, but am trapped for the present by circumstances.  One day off in three years and the lousy son of a b*tch couldn't even let me enjoy that.

Bah."

"event","For those of you that care about these things, today marks the anniversary of the Titanic's having struck the iceburg.  At a little after 11:00 p.m. on the night of April 14, 1912, around 2,500 people learned that ice could destroy a dream.  By 2:20 a.m. on the following morning, the rest of the World knew as well.

April has always been a time of death and remembrances it seems.  Titanic, Hitler's birthday (20th), Hitler's deathday (30th), my own Mother's deathday (21st).  ::laughs grimly::  Okay, no more <i>Johnny The Homicidal Maniac</i> or <i>Lenore</i> for me - it's making me altogether too macabre."

"event","I know I keep intending to update my Journal, but as they say the Road To Hell is paved with good intentions.  Trouble is, I've been kept so busy lately -- either working late or running from pillar to post -- that I've let life become a bit of a blur.  So I guess I'll just make this observation (already shared with one of you):

On Saturday, I went hiking through Sweetwater Creek State Park in Georgia.  I ended up on the Yellow Trail (after a short side hike up an unmarked old road where I stopped to start building a small dam on a little stream I found there).  This was perfect and a balm for my soul since this particular trail is apparently not that popular this time of year -- just me and the surrounding nature.

Anyway, I was halfway through the hike when I sat for a moment in order to enjoy both the beauty and the silence (i.e., lack of humans) all around me.  While sitting there, I began to feel a bit sorry for myself and kind of asked myself ""why must life be such a struggle?  Why can't I be free to enjoy days like this every day?""
As I sat there looking about me, I saw the answer.  All around me were trees -- hundreds of them -- but very few of them were large, impressive trees.  Mostly, the forest was filled by small, undernourished trees -- grabbing what life they can in the shadows of the greater trees that grew alongside of them.

Looking at all that, I guess it made me remember that life is a struggle simply because IT IS.  We're all organisms and we all face similar obstacles.  Whether it be a small tree in the shadow of a big one or a poor man in the shadow of a wealthy one, we all struggle to survive.  Most often, this is due to no other reason than the luck of where our particular seeds first took root.  Sometimes, the fertility of the ground plays its own part, but mostly, the challenges we face come from beyond our control and all we can do is struggle and hopefully persevere.  Perhaps the fates of trees and humans depend upon how we face the obstacles of birth and luck that face us.  Maybe that's how the big trees -- at least some of them -- live to grow to BE big trees.  And maybe it's the same for us.

::laughs::  Okay, I'm done philosophising.  (Should that be spelled with a ""z""?  I don't think so...)"

"event","So what's so bad about Saturday that the Beatles felt compelled to leave it out of not one, but <i>two</i>, of their songs?  Maybe it's because that's when most of us in this world are busy taking a ""vacation"" from our jobs only to concentrate on the work of our personal lives.  Maybe it's because Paul's mother died on a Saturday (don't quote me, I'm working on an urban myth here) and he swore an oath never to honor the day in his songs.  Maybe I really don't know any other way to begin this entry and rambling on about the Beatles and their being ""Saturday challenged"" seemed as good an intro as any.

I haven't written for awhile (yes, I know the world noticed).  Mostly, this has been because I've either been working like a dog or playing like a puppy (I'm running low on clever analogies today, as may be quite obvious).  My goal is to be able to move further North within the next 12 to 16 months.  This means I'll need to have a ""rock solid"" work history behind me in order to enhance my job/salary prospects when I get there.  

As a lawyer, I'm rated upon several criteria: (a) reasonably priced resolution of claims; (b) billable hours; and (c) reporting to my clients on a regular basis.  I'm pretty lucky in that I've always had the ""gift of gab"" and have always been relatively sensitive to the feelings and thoughts of others.  This has made achieving ""a"" relatively simple.  The most I have <i>ever</i> had a client pay out was $225,000 (and this was on a claim in which liability was clear and the Plaintiff was hospitalized and immoble for over 6 months).  As for ""c"", I'm probably somewhere in the top 20% in my Firm - not great, but respectable.

Where I've usually fallen down on the job is in regard to billable hours.  Mind you, prior to this year, my ""average"" weekly billables were around 55.4 hours (which is around 20 more per week than the average defense attorney bills in Florida), so I wasn't exactly out fishing.  It's just that all law firms - whether they be in Florida, Georgia or elsewhere  - look to how many hours you bill to see how valuable you can be to the Firm.  Anyway, to make a much-too-long story short, this year I've been working longer hours and have been averaging 67.8 hours per week.  Hopefully, any Firm I apply to in the future will look at this and say ""hire him.""

::sigh::  So that's 70% of the reason I've slacked off on writing.  The other 30% is because I've been taking trips up to Georgia recently to visit with Beth, Eric, Caleb, Heather, Chris, Kevin........::laughs::  Yes, the list keeps growing.  I half expect Jimmy Carter to be sitting there one of these days - I swear, they know everyone - both the living <i>and</i> the dead.

Okay, I'm not going to turn this entry into DeMille's <i>The Ten Commandments</i>.  It's rambled on quite long enough.  I am in a writing mood though, so I may just add a supplemental entry entitled ""The return of the boring journalist"", later."

"event","Yes, I know it's been longer than it should've been since I last updated my journal.  Mostly, this has been a result of my running around like a chicken with its head cut off during the day, followed by a preference for spending my time in other pursuits at night.  Also, sometimes I guess I'm just a pretty boring kind of person.  (I'm a lawyer, what'd you expect?)

About the only thing that's happened down in Florida recently is that I bought a Chevy Avalanche.  The thing is huge - and I mean huge.  If Noah had owned one of these instead of the Ark, we might well still have unicorns (the humor being that he didn't have room for them on the boat....yep, I know, not all that funny).  And I want to send a heartfelt ""thank you"" to Beth - since it was her eagle eye that spotted the exact vehicle I ultimately purchased.

::sigh::  About the only other things of note to have occurred recently have been a series of really weird - but also extraordinarily vivid and detailed - dreams.  ::laughs::  As Beth knows, mostly these are borderline nutsy <i>fantasias</i> ranging from harmless idylls in which I have found myself the owner of a pet moose (my personal favorite....she was such a nice little moose), to true night terrors in which I am being clawed open by a sorceress/witch (the infamous Circe, no less), turned female bear - before being transformed into a tortoise.  ::laughs::  I've seriously decided that if these dreams continue in their current fashion that I am going to start writing them down and will eventually attempt to fashion a Clive Barkeresque story out of them.......assuming, that is, I don't go crazy first.

There.  I've done it.  I've posted an entry."

"event","Well, as anyone who actually reads this LJ knows (::laughs:: all three of you), this past weekend was spent up in the Peach State visiting with Beth, Eric, Caleb and a Serta mattress (and it was the mattress which got the most attention).  It would be a trifle bit trite and self-serving to say just how good a time I had in overly great detail (since the people who I spent the weekend meeting will, in all probability, read this entry and I have no intention to use it as a forum to curry favor).  About all I'll say is that I really enjoyed meeting, and really liked everyone I met.  They're all intelligent, clever (important to me) and somewhat sardonic (also important) people and I'm glad I had the chance to meet them.

About the only thing I would change if I get to go back is to spend more time with everyone.  In a way, I felt somewhat guilty about sleeping so much (my excuse is that it was an 8 hour drive and I stayed up into the following day) and would like to be a bit more ""bright eyed and bushy tailed"" next time (although, I've never understood the necessity of having a bushy tail, who am I to argue with folk wisdom?).

On another note, Beth and I went to see the movie <i>Big Fish</i> and, while I kind of nodded off a time or two, I managed to see the more important parts of the film with a fair degree of clarity.  It was a very good movie, but also very sad.  It's funny, because Beth said afterwards that some of her friends who had already seen it didn't really think it bore too many hallmarks of a ""true"" Tim Burton film.  I didn't necessarily agree with this view, but it made me kind of look at the film critically.  In the end, I guess I became even more impressed because I kind of realized that what Burton has done is to have created a movie that is really two movies.  The first, ""non-Tim Burton"" movie concerns the sympathetic story surrounding the Albert Finney character and his son.  As he weaves his tales, the audience is drawn into the ""Tim Burton"" movie.  It's brilliantly done, but in a way, it's kind of sad too - because it seems as if the only way the general populace can actually see and appreciate Tim Burton's unique vision is to be ""tricked"" into it.  For the most part, I'm willing to bet that most of them don't even realize that they've been given a chance to see some of Tim Burton's finer work and will continue on in their own blind little ways to convince themselves that ""Tim Burton has finally abandoned his quirky approach and has made a normal (albeit fantasy) movie.""  Little do they know.  Good for him."

"event","So I go into work yesterday and try nicely telling my secretary that I need her to try working a little bit more efficiently.  Before I ever get to this point, I make sure to tell her how much I appreciate all she does for me.  I try to point out that we're a team and that <i>as</i> a team we need to work together to achieve out goals.  I point out that the day before (she called in, by the way), I had managed to bill 13.4 hours all by myself (I have set a daily goal of 13 hours for the two of us combined).  I also point out that I needed to come in at 7:00 a.m. and work until 6:30 p.m. with no lunch break to do this.  I attempt to appeal to her sense of ""well I can't let him carry the load all by himself"".  I tried really, really hard to make her feel like I was asking her to be part of the ""team"" and to help lighten the load for her teammate (did I mention that her desk area looks like a WW I trench because it's piled so high with backed up work?).  I do all that and all I get in return is her telling me I'm becoming a ""monster.""  (Which, if I'm a monster, the Easter Bunny is Satan himself).

Anyway, today I no more than sit down at my desk than my boss, John, knocks on my door.  ""Lafe Purcell, come in my office.""   Well, hearing these words from John usually puts most of us in the same mood that most Roman Senators probably experienced when receiving the fateful letter from Caligula ""summoned to Rome.""  In short, about all that's left to decide is whether it's better to slit one's own wrists quickly or wait until John can slowly lop your head off.  Being not quite ready to face the lions, I let a rare expletive slip out (yep, I cursed at my boss).  No sooner was I in his office than he goes ""close the door"" to which I reflexively replied ""Damn it John""...to which <i>he</i> replied ""what's the matter?"" to which I replied ""I hate coming in here since every time you call, I just know you're going to yell at me about something.  So what is it <i>this</i> time?""  ""I just wanted to let you know that you handled the Davidson case very well and I want you to cover a hearing for me on a motion to dismiss.""   Damn him.  Damn him all to Hell.  Why in the name of Sam Hill can't he be consistent?  Three friggin' years of yelling and he has to spoil it all with a compliment.

I suspect the Apocalypse must be approaching.  When people generally regarded as ""nice guys"" get called monsters and universally regarded ""monsters"" start acting nice, the World must surely be coming to some sort of end.  Bah."

I don't know why this quote kept going through my head today.  It's Hamlet's ""battlement soliloquy"" from - what else? - <i>Hamlet</i>.  I think it was because it was reminding me of a great many people - not the least of whom was myself.  We all of us want to be one person, but oftentimes find ourselves ending up somebody else entirely.  Why?  Is it because we never had the capacity to become the person we once hoped to be?  Or is it something more subtle - more discreet?  The ripple caused by a pebble dropped in the ocean that becomes a wave, the beating of an insect's wings that unleashes a tornado?  The stamp of one defect, from which - our virtues else be they as pure as grace - shall in the general censure take corruption from that particular fault.  That is who we all are and maybe grace lies ultimately in our ability to confront and destroy these faults before they dig under the foundations of who we once hoped - and often <i>still</i> hope - to be.

And that, being that, describes all of us to one extent or another."

You think silly things - like how good it would be to see her, her hair all messed up and with a grumpy ""it's too damned early"" look upon her face and you know before you ever actually experience it, that this will make you love her all the more.  You sit at your desk during the day just hoping she will find a minute - even just one - to contact you.

"event","I don't particularly feel like posting about my own life for awhile.  So today, I just want to write something which I suppose could best be termed ""sympathy for the Devil.""  Seeing Saddam Hussein on television did not fill me with the same sense of sanguine triumph which it seems to have the average ""armchair warrior.""  Instead, it gave me a sense of just the most profound sadness.  I don't look at a man's past when judging him.  I look at his eyes.  And whatever Saddam's failings and misdeeds may have been, his eyes look like those of a man whose world has ceased to exist....and of a man who has felt every blow which caused that world to die.

Is he a good man?  Clearly not.  Not, at least, by the conventional standards of the time.  Brutality seems to have been a part of his basic makeup.  But he comes from a brutal land and was raised in a brutal culture.  So is it any more right to judge him for his brutality than it would be to judge the wolf or the tiger simply for being a wolf and a tiger?  We are what we are raised to be and, for better or worse, this colors our world.

I don't love Saddam.  But neither do I hate him.  Mostly, I feel dreadfully, dreadfully sorry for him.  He is a man who has fallen from a great height to an almost unimagined depth and, not left alone to die in his hole, he has been delivered to his enemies by members of his own family.  Could any end be more bitter?"

I don't do it often and when I do, it doesn't take much at all to get me fairly tipsy.  Last night, of course, being a perfect example - both of what a true lightweight I am and of what an idiot drinking can make anyone.  I woke up this morning and started cringing at about 3/4 of the things I said last night - some of them because I was being overly honest (though these are the things I am least ashamed of since they were close to coming out anyhow - albeit in a slightly more subtle form), some of them because upon reflection through a sober eye, I could remember using words that were completely inapplicable to the night which preceded my tipsy babblings.  (I'll explain someday when my shame and embarrassment has receded somewhat.  For now, suffice it to say that....well, I'm an idiot - but not in a good way)  Okay, well that's it for now.  ::slithers back under the rock, pulling it down tightly about himself::"

"event","A fun day, a weird day.  A weirdly fun day.  First, I got in trouble with the Judge by calling my opposing counsel an ""idiot"" and then when he said ""no, I'm not"", I cleverly retorted with ""yes, you are.""  Eventually, the Judge (evidently concluding we both qualified for the title), muzzled both of us and then tossed us out of his chambers.  Fortunately, opposing counsel is a friend of long standing, so we both had a good laugh on our way out of the courthouse.  (His name is Mike <u>Falkowski</u> (underlined because it's important further down the road) and to give an idea of his personality, when I was first starting out as an attorney, I had a mediation with him.  His client was an elderly black woman, mine was a super market.  Mike hated (and I mean <i>hated</i>) my boss at the time and I suppose felt much the same toward me simply because I worked for him.  Sitting down at the mediation table, he glares across at me and loudly says to his client ""I just want you to know before we get started, this lousy son of a b*tch is prejudiced.""  Without missing a beat, I simply looked back across the table, smiled and said ""Yes I am.  I hate Polacks.""  ::laughs:: we've been close friends ever since.

In other news, Beth e-mailed me today during lunch.  This alone is always enough to make me very happy.  FOR ALL THE WORLD TO HEAR: <font color=""#ff0000""> I love Beth!!  I think she is the one and only person who comes closest to what a human ought to be!  </font> Anyway, we've developed a kind of Neolithic IM system that has allowed us to ""communicate"" with a fair degree of efficiency.....so the middle of my day was, quite appropriately, the high point.

Riding this high, my best friend from my old Firm showed up next and we went out to lunch to talk over old and new times.  I rarely comment on my own ""funnies"", but there is this girl who has asked me out that I wasn't interested in (and therefore, said - nicely - ""no"").  She's very pretty, but also very, um, unclever.  Anyway, Larry saw her and was telling me that my failure to be interested was a violation of the ""man code""  (I'm in trouble because I've not yet found a copy of this code and thus am probably living my life all wrong).  Anyway, we started talking about other girls we've known and hit upon Danielle, our old receptionist - who was also cerebrally challenged - and Larry suggested that I could doubledate with the girl in my office and Danielle....to which I replied that I would feel like Jane Goodall.  (yeah, okay, I just realized that this wasn't as funny in writing as it was when spontaneously delivered.....y'see, the joke is that Jane Goodall made a name for herself by living amongst and observing chimps and I was implying.....ok, never mind.)

Anyway, my day ended in a weird, Daliesque kind of way.  Tracy, one of the girls who's boyfriends just broke up with her, called me and was all upset (which she has been for a couple days now).  Tracy: ""Do you believe in God?  Do you go to church?"" Lafe:  ::shudders at where this is going:: ""um, well, not really.  I mean I believe in God, but I'm not a big church goer""  Tracy: ""No, neither am I.  Want to come over for dinner?""  Lafe: ""What th... huh?"" Tracy: ""Want to come over...maybe not tonight.  I meant just to talk about Mike.  I always felt better when you would talk to me.  I really need to talk about the breakup""  Lafe:  ::ignoring the tingling sensation at the base of his skull which warns of ""Danger!  Danger Will Robinson!""::   ""Well, yeah, I could do that.  But why don't we make it lunch instead - say next Wednesday.""  Tracy: ""Great.  We can go to lunch next Wednesday and next Friday I can cook you dinner.""  Lafe:  ::ready to self-eviscerate::  ""Well, let's see about Friday b/c I'm not sure of my schedule.  But Wednesday lunch is good.  It's a DEAL""  Tracy:  ""Okay, great.  It's a DATE.""  Yep, different worlds, same planet."

"event","Well, I intend to establish a pattern early with morning notes that are superfluous, short and utterly without any lasting value (as opposed to evening posts which are also without any value, but which tend to be longer).  Nice dream last night involving a woods, a waterfall a grassy glade and Beth.  Not a <i>sexual</i> one, but better actually.  It was one of those ""well, can I really tell whether this is real or have I gone to Heaven?"" type dreams.  On another note, I've promised to meet one of my friends for lunch today which ought to be a bit of an ordeal.  Oh well.  Anyway, as always, my first thoughts and first words go out to Beth: ""good morning you!!  Hope your day goes well, your tummy doesn't ache too badly, Shemeka....well, I'd say ""hope she croaks"", but God would punish me for that - so I'll just say I hope she has as bad a day as she deserves....finally, I hope I get to talk to you again (and again and again) tonight."

"event","Well, this was one of the stranger days I've had in a number of years.  So strange, in fact, I'm not even sure that I can write about it just yet (I may need a bit of time to absorb it all).  In essence, I had three totally unrelated people all call me within the space of 22 minutes to ask for ""emotional support"" for the exact same problem.  In all three cases, it dealt with a friend who had just been dumped by their significant other (is it the Season?  Good Lord, so much for Holiday cheer).  I know that changing relationships is one of the unfortunate possibilities of being human (yet one more reason I prefer wolves and elephants to people), but in all three cases, these were relationships that had lasted in excess of three years - so the statistical probabilities of them all ending at the same time and my being called on all three within less than half an hours span of time is just weird.

With all that being said, I don't know that I was the best person to be giving advice at this time.  Due to events in my own life, I've been reaffirming my belief in Fate and the idea that ""what is meant to be <i>will</i> be.""  Needless to say, this isn't exactly what somebody wants to hear when they're asking if I think there's a chance for rapproachment ::laughs::.....Ah well, at least I'm honest - if perhaps a little less sensitive than I ought to be.  (In fairness to myself, I'm usually a <i>fairly</i> good shoulder to cry on and will make it up to each of them in their own different ways).

Beyond the strangeness of above (which also strangely shares a tenuous link of sorts to other events in my life and the lives of those I hold dear), the day was rather boring.....of course, I suppose just about anything would be boring by comparison."

"event","There are so many things I want to write about this morning....well, that's a bit of a lie.  Actually, there's only one and it's concerning something and someone closer to my heart than anyone has ever been.   ::laughs as he suddenly remembers how very public this private LJ actually is::  Fortunately, I am running late for work (a chronic condition which, for me at least, is harder to overcome than AIDS...yep, that was a ghoulish analogy), so I'll have to wait until later to elaborate further.  Suffice it to be said that there is <i>someone</i> whose happiness means all to me and this person is always with me....even though (crypto-ironically...ooh a new word!!), the person never has been and never may be.  Okay, well this was a relatively stupid entry, but I promise to write something of more substance <i>and</i> interest in the future."

"event","Oh what would I do if I didn't have Beth out there?  For those of you who might someday stumble across this LJ (::laughs:: of course, that probably is only Beth...in which case, this entry serves no true purpose), let me tell you about her.  She is witty and clever (two different things), caring, sensitive, sometimes biting (in a way that I love), intelligent and creative.  Her username is xlxdrktouchxlx and I highly recommend you spend a little time with her some evening or two.  Most of all, she is - to me - the perfect person, in that the things she sees as being flaws are really the things which give her personality it's edge, shape and uniqueness.  I love what she sees as her ""flaws"" and only wish I could spend more time exploring them in person.......oh, and did I mention that I think she's ethereally pretty?  The beauty doesn't lie in her eyes, her lips, the shape of her face....but in all of it together and the way God, Fate or fortune has conjoined these elements into one.  Put poetically, ""she is as God intended her and I'd ne'er have another.""  Put a little more bluntly ""hubba hubba."""

"event","Well, hopefully, this time around I will remember my screenname and password.  Anyway, it's Sunday, December 7, 2003 a day which will live most comfortably I assume.  Beth went to see the Nutcracker last night and I'm hoping it was everything she wanted it to be.  As for me, for some reason or another, I was totally unable to sleep.  As such, it is 10:33 a.m. and I've still not hit the hay.  It's going to sound stupid, but I suspect that the reason I couldn't sleep was simply because I had Beth on my mind.  Everytime I'd begin to nod off, some thought would enter my head and it would keep me going until the next one took its place.  Anyway, I'm going to go try and sleep a little bit at least.  (And Beth, I again hope you had a good time at the Nutcracker last night)."

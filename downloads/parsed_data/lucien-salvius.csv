Right? So so far in this shit I can't quite get out of this fucking hole I seemed to dig for myself. And now that I am half way through and on the way down I see it is too late for that. And now the hole is so fucking immense that I just can't quite get up the steep sides. Could someone just get a goddamned shovel and bury me?"

"event","So we swim and we swim, right? And we fight to stay afloat. But we never get what we truly want because we get so wrapped up in all of this spoonfed braindead bullshit. Media tells you what you should be sweatin and what  don't really matter. And no one really sells out, Shit ask them, They just buy in. Earn yourself a small spot in the land of the dead where you can finally get some real peace and quiet. You know what the fuck I am talking about. Don't play stupid and with me of all people. They call em cemetaries. You work all that time and get all this shit accumulated and for what? For what. I'll tell you what. So while you live you can feel like the man or the queen <b>B</b>. Heh. And none of it goes back with you when you return what was never really yours (rented, at best) back to the mother. That's right,

And what? We got ourselves a religious war going yet? A regular Crusade and shit. That is another thing we seem to have gotten all out of order. This beast they call religion. An organization. A real moneymaker that one there. You see I myself am a very spiritual being and believe what feels in my being to be what's real. Not what everyone says is the real way to feel and ""worship"" And all that crazed ferver. What it is is what it always will be, you know. Matter is all that does. Not what you think should matter. If at all there is one particle of mattering to it it is and always never will be. You still there? Haven't written me off as some crazy fool who knows not the way of it? You just gotta think about it for a few of those precious moments you covet and grasp to like there isn't anything else. There is always something else. Energy is displaced (it changes shape, form, chemical makeup and all kinds of other neat stuff), it is sent from here to there and back again. But it does not ever truly die. 

And all these gods of yours and his and hers and theirs? Well you already know what it be. They are all truly one. Masqueraded about under many different guises and danced about beneath many other names. But one in the same it is. The highest power is but a thought from your mind and you can create the most wondrous things. As long as your mind sees it it is. You still with me here? Now what I mean to say is when you daydream is the thought and mental pictures drawn not enough supporting evidence that in some reality these things have become real? That they now exist? Just think on it for a time. Then you tell me what you think of all this bullshit. Right right? What what and Goodday.
Godspeed you in all things. Haha     (take nothing I say to be a mockery of anything.)"

"event","So yeah. I have been preparing myself for service. Military type shit I mean. Damn I just get this feeling that things are going to get fucked up real soon. And this is the best thing that I can come up with to circumvent the coming storm. My father is going to kick me out in a week if I don't get a job over his dog shitting constantly on the floor. Simply put, It is fucking disgusting there. No one cleans up after themselves. And he (good ole dad I mean) thinks I am still a child that he can make slave away for him or some shit. 

I will give you that back story before I confuse you or something. Alright, here we go. He has always been a fucking asshole. Used to deal with me much like he would deal with some motherfucker off of the street. I deserve a whipping, aparently I deserved a lot back then and was much too small to fight back. And I hauled ass when I turned sixteen. Gone for five years. Saw him and the rest of those fucks two, maybe three times in that whole time. 

Then some unfortunate things happened, I did some real stupid shit and ended up as a last resort having to take his help again. Well, as it turns out he is stuck seven years in the past thinking I am still a boy of fourteen or so and still his slave. The motherfucker is the epitome of lazy. Used to make me do everything he didn't want to do. Used to steal my birthday money and use it for his cocaine habits. You know the usual shit a kid should never have to deal with.

Except this time I am twenty-one and he can't put a hand on me without having his face smashed through the back of his head. I have been waiting for him to step up for so long now it aches in me. 

And now I will bring you up to present time. Now he thinks that he has his little slave back as I have said before. But I feel like fuck that. Though grateful for the roof over my head and such things I refuse to be treated the way that he thinks he has the right to treat me. No one should have to endure these things. well last night I got home late after spending the day JOB HUNTING all fucking day to find that my older brother had not taken the dog out at all. As you can imagine it was fucking nasty. He dropped several yuk bombs all over the house. Hmmmm. So what do I do. I go outside and sit thinking the whole while how fucked up it is that if I don't walk the dog he doesn't go out. And if he shits on the floor if I don't pick it up it just fucking sits and stinks. Well this to me is incredibly fucking sickening to the point where I really don't want to live with those fucks anymore anyway. But back to what happened last night. Now normally I would jump right on it and clean shit up off of the floor. It is to me an unliveable condition to have any type of feces just sitting around. But this night I had a point to make. And I'll be damned if it were not made. 
Anywhichwhat the motherfucker comes home from work (my ""dad"" i mean) and sees all the shit. Now he doesn't say shit to anyone else woh happened to be at home all fucking day about it. Not my little sisters and not my older brother. Straight to the room, opens the door and looks right at me, ""Damn Raymond, you been home for a little while now and you aint cleaned up the shit?"" Now something else you should know is it is his dog. He made that shit abundantly clear when he got it. I say no. I tell him that it happened before I got home And I was tired of motherfuckers deferring straight to me with this type of bullshit. Well he pretty much slams the door in my face and walks away for a few moments. Then he comes back and says that I have a week before he is going to put me out on the street. Haha. Then I said ""That is fine, I really don't care."" For you see I have come to expect this kind of nonsense from a man who would steal his own twelve year olds birthday money for a gram of that white stuff. From a man who would beat his own son like some man off the street as if he didn't matter to him at all. 

Hell I knew it was a bad idea to move back in in the first place. But we all slip and fall sometimes and need help back up every now and again. But I was misinformed by some of the other in the family. Untruly told that he was a changed man and that everyone deserves a second chance. Haha. 

Damn that feels much better. A load off of my shoulders. But I am still needing to tell him about himself one day soon."

So I have to use the computers here at the Middle(ofnowhere)burg library to get online because I don't have a computer at home and even  if I did I don't have a job to pay for internet service yet.

"event","So since last I posted I have had quite a time dealing with myself. Jess and I broke up a number of times. Got back together almost as many. Then I completely lost it last weekend and O.D.ed. Took twenty-seven xannax (did I spell that right? The better question is whether it matters, you get the picture.) And like seventeen or eighteen diladid. Drank a whole bottle of whiskey and then some. Went to the hospital. Died a number of times before coming to a rather rude awakening strapped to a     ing hospital bed with them pulling a tube out of my throat. Didn't know where I was or what I was doing there. No one I knew in sight. Tried to scream when they pulled the tube out. But all I got was a gurgle type noise before collapsing back into unconsciousness. The few parts I do remember are all warped and     ed up. All distorted from the massive amount of drugs I did. I stole some money too. Basically I pulled a Dr.         and Mr. Even more     ed up than that wnen I took my ""potions"". But I live. Haven't figured out yet if I deserve to or not though. Right? Gotta have broken some kind of record. Lucky as     . My mother told me the other day that I'm not a cat and I don't have nine lives. So I had better quit     ing around and get serious. Heh, kind of sad that it took this long for me to get it, but I did. I quit drinking and doing all that other     . Had to just quit it all. Can't deal with that sort of thing anymore.  

Jess and I are taking a bit of a break. I should guess that she needs it. I     ed a lot of things up real bad of late. Killed myself two or three times. Went to MHRC. Fooled my way out of that         . Moved to Middleburg with my dad and older brother and sisters and stepmom. A lot of ands huh. Almost distasteful writing. Had a few revelations too whilst I was at it. One of which was that after all this time I need to get off of my ass and start doing something for myself. Damn it there was so much more I wanted to add but I haven't been able to get online until now. Sitting at the Middleburg Library with my stepmom. Haha. Who the      knows where it came from though. Just out of nowhere. They have almost the same kind of PC that jess has at her house here. Set up everywhere. But what nots aside and yep."

And I missed it and that is why I can't get back to stupid. Because instead of Setting the shit to regression and no defiance to opression I slipped through the cracks. And when everything changes from year to year. ANd they can't remember that it didn't used to be like this. That information is fucking not what I learned two years ago. What the fuck is going on?

Something holding on long after the physical (and I mean the true physical, not this imitation) self has been gone on to rot. Something that can't quite accept that it is over. But it shouldn't feel that way. It shouldn't feel like everything I used to love is pushing away. Time and space bring about a divide of imeasurable proportions and I can't feel them touching me. Their collective voice holds no warmth for me anymore. But it isn't all bad. I am just over it if that is possible.

A conflicting weather pattern in the otherwise flowing regular system of it all? Something like that anyways not uuite like that. I had it mapped out in my head and when it came out as usual: CRAPPED IT OUT ONTO THE PAPER. Value of thought is deprciated by the words you try to use to describe it. That is why we need to find a way to link our thought. Some type of mechanical mind meld. Mechanical magic. Scientific approach to telekinesis and stuff like what people think as myth? I think it is pretty intriguing. May not seem quite as mystical as other approaches, but hey, who the fuck's complaining? 

I got some doctor bills in just the other day. Guess how much? Somewhere around about an infinite amount of something I couldn't hope to pay for in like ten years at the rate I am moving through this time and space. Well, right now I only have my bill. Which for them to treat me and make sure I was okay after the accident I had to pay them eleven thousand-three hundred and thirty two dollars. And I wasn't even in overnight. The guy who was with me is still in there. And he has been for at least two weeks. Wonder what that super uber mega fucking bill is going to run me?

And as soon as I can get a loan of some sort (which should be pretty soon if what I am trying to do comes through) we can start this shit up. We have been thinking and we decided that it would be sweet to start a small independant studio for a lot of things. I am not going into too much detail here and now, but I may fairly soon. If you are interested in anime and other forms of art and stuff like manga though, you should leave me a message and let me know. I am going to need a lot of help and hopefully I will have about fifty to a hundred thousand dollars to work with. We will know after the twenty fourth whether we get the loan or not, but that is subject to change. Anyone that knows anything about... ummmmmm, shit if you think you know something that would help start something like what I am trying to do you should leave me a message or something. I know I should elaborate and all, but right now I am tired and have an interview today at eight thirty and still don't know how the fuck I am going to get there. Let's just leave it at this.

"event","So there was a wedding yesterday. In brunswick georgia. Friend of mine (Andy) married my grandma'a husband's daughter (Tina). Guess who wasn't there for that shit? Whatever. Don't know what i am doing today, but i guess it won't really matter. Second halloween in a row free. Sweet. Gonna get high at least. got something for that definitely and i don't have to rely on anyone else for that. Could just go off somewhere by myself and get stoned. With Jess of course. But by ourselves like that one Valentine's day when i brought over the weed and we just got stoned and agreed that it really was a good V-day. The first good one. That holiday is so fucking gay. Ridiculous is what it is. So yeah. Jess is in the shower and i am bored as shit. Think I'll cal BigNiggahD and get him to bring his bowl so we can smoke. Other than that there isn't shit going on. I talked to my brother and he is bored as shit too, in Middleburg though, not here in J-ville where there is always something to be bored at. I haven't done anything in a while as far as uhhhhhhh...

Forgot where i was going with that. Chilled with Donnie and Kris for a while the other night. AThat was sweet as shit. Haven't seen Kris in a long little while so it was a treat. I am seriously the most boring person ever I think. The worst. FUCK. SHIT. ASS. BITCH. 

I have been thinking lately. I don't ever go to the doctor for checkups or anything for that matter. Wonder how unhealthy I am. Wonder how long I have before I die. Probably not that long from now. So my girlfriend's mom hates me and only puts up with me because her daughter makes it so. And I don't particularly like her too much right now either, so we are sort of even. Except for the fact that i suck and can't take care of myself apparently. So I live here, don't have a job, don't own shit of my own, and I just continue to drag this pathetic charade on and on. My dad keeps telling me to come home and let him find me a job and he wil take care of it if I just come home and admit defeat. 

And to an extent I have been thinking about it. What if he is right? What if I should have just stayed home when I got out last time? What if when it all comes down to it I can't hack it? Can't take the stress of living? But I just don't see this happening to me. I have always been alright. I always pull through if just barely. So it is whatever like I said before. 



And for those of you that think me to be immature or whatever flaw you find in my writing... Well, what have we here in this bag of goodies? huh, what have we got for you guys? Not much of anything at all except this apology for not being perfedt for you guys who are. You know the guys I am talking about. Fuck it. I have come to a revelation just now and it is none of you fuckers can tell me a goddamn thing. I really don't give one good fuck that you think the way that i write makes no sense. If it makes no sense to you, don't read it. If you think it is garbage then read some other shit that isn't garbage to you. Save your petty insults for someone who gives a good goddamn or two.

Nothing short of utter annihilation. Nothing better than the pain we feel from the emptiness in our hearts. it hurts down to the pit of our guts. 

We bleed from our ears. Every drop payment to the screams. The agony of selfdefeat. Giving up too soon. On myself, on my mom, on all that i try to care for but fail. And each time i lay in bed and cry for my lost soul to come home. I just cry. Because ""nothing can hurt you in the dark"". Unless you're three years old and he's in one of those moods again.

I know they wanted some time alone or something. but ellie was talking about someone coming to pick jess up and that they might want to chill too. And I was still like ""naw, it's cool. You guys need some time to talk ""alone"" bout some shit. Which is what i figure they wanted to do. But it's cool for ellie to have somone along. 

But whatever. If she comes home and talks about hanging out with people other than el, think I'm just going to leave. ""She just needed a 'girls night out'"" I guess. Gotta go get some glue. Mom wont answer the phone. Everyone left a little while after jess and ellie took off. So now I sit at this console and type. I have sicerely been thinking about moving of late. I mean a lot. Like I dream of it. I think about somewhere new constantly. If Jess would agree I would so pick up and leave so fast.

But these are the times that I see what bouncing a child from home to home can do to his life. No friends. The family I have I don't know about. Don't know if they except me. Since I got out of jail I've neglected to make any new friends. You know how that goes. You get locked up. For the first few months everyone sends you lots of pics and letters about how much they love you. How much they wish they could see you. Then, as the months progress, the letters become few and far between. Even from your beloved, who you think will write you as much as possible. Then you start to develop these feelings like ""hey, I guess they moved on. Guess they found something better. Something real. Something there in front of them. Tangible. Soft and warm. And all the while you are lying in your bunk in the concrete/stainless steel cage appointed you by the state of WHATTHEFUCKEVER and cry yourself to sleep. So cold. So utterly defeated. Longing for a good dream. Or at least a night of black thick sleep to engulf your soul. The sleep you do manage to aquire is riddled with bad dreams. Wishing to touch her face. Just once, if even through four inches of tempered, steel laced glass. 

And you are left behind as your life just simply goes away. You get bitter and resent them. You break up with the love of your life. And by the end of that third year you step out of those gates for the first and the last time. You get your beloved back. But it isn't the same. You aren't the same. And you only just begin to realize how fucked up in the head you are. And how fucked up everything is. And you're nineteen
with no experience. No real memories because you're life is so mixed up that you can't remember things as they happened. you lost three years of your life. Your memories are in shambles. You despise your mother for helping them to put you in that cage for so long. 

And the stress. It becomes too much. It gets to the point where you just can't deal with things. You snap at the first sign of trouble no matter how calm you attempt to stay. Alone and thinking of things you thought you were past. But you know that you'll never be past these haunted nightmares. Things like the scars on your arms. And how easy it would be to begin anew. To collect your thoughts through the beading red lifeforce running intricately down your arm. You know you will find forgiveness there. Some sort of grounding for the head that is in space instead of where it should be. On your fucking shoulders. 

::he looks up and sees the knife on the table just over the keyboard and decides to keep his fingers on the keys. lest he fail you. Lest he let you down again. 

A desperate attempt to live. A clinging to this hell. The fear. She told me that if I yelled at her like that again she was going to leave me. Find someone else who would not scream at her.

She is right though. She deserves so much better than what i could ever give. I don't think I am going to make it very far in life and that is fine if I ever seperate from this relationship. But I don't foresee that happening unless she decides to end it. I screamed that it was over right in her face today. Think I broke my wrist right before that. We were arguing and I kicked the door after she slammed it in my face. Then I walked in and she slammed OUR door in my face (door to our bedroom). I hit it with my hurt wrist a few times and now I think it is broken in some fashion or other. She yelled at me to ""GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY HOUSE!""

So before I left, I screamed that it was over and left. But as usual, we came to the conclusion that I was completely wrong and this was all my fault. And I came back and apologized for how fucked up I am. Now I an sitting here thinking about doing some stuff I haven't done in a long time. And it would hurt her. And she would be so disappointed in me. And it would be so selfish of me to cut my arms. To let my pain leak to the surface and wash away."

"event","hey everyone. how's it goin poeples (yes i spelt it that way on purpose, sound it out for yourself, it sounds funny ;/). Man.. been pretty crazy as of late, well lets see. I got my report card (2nd one) and well.. it honestly sucked the balls of a cow.  I hid it from my dad though, so its straight ;), and i'm really trying to get my grades up to go see jen up in new york this x-mas.  I'm thinking my parents will let me go, if i can afford it, which will be very very cool.  At home its been just sucky mostly, with my dad being the usual ass he is, my mom keeps it straight though.  She's the calm cool, sweet side of the parenting, and my dad's the bitch/ass/mother fuck with a frog up his ass walkin around complaining about how bad off he has it.. oh well lol.  (yes i love him so much ;/).  Me and my baby are going good, been alittle hectic. (you guys know that), but things will be good.  I know it deep in my heart that me and my baby will forever be together.. We we're ment to be, and we will always be.  At school, things are cool.. Keeping my good group of friends and what not.  I'm going to go see 8 mile this weekend with some friends, and then spend most of it talking to jenny.  Tomorrow at school, i'm gonna get $20 from this kid i'm selling some playstation games to, and also some nintendeo 64 games i once had.  Zelda: Ocarina of Time.  Loved it.. best game ever ;), and with that $20 i'm buying the new Star Wars movie that just came out.  Yes i'm a star wars freak.. not afraid to admit it, but hell i am.  I guess it just takes a bit imagination to get into it, and like alot of sci-fi stuff.  Well my baby girl is waiting for me to IM her so i'm gonna wrap this up.. with a final thought. And here it is....


Everytime you take your cup off, life kicks you in the balls.

And there you have it, see you all in a couple of days.. when I feel like writing again. Later's all. Love you my jenny<3333333333333333333333!!!!!!!!!"

It's been pretty crazy these past couple of days.  My old buddy Kablieb IM's me up on my old ass screen 'rem3g' which was great.  Me and jen are doin good, few args. here and there but we're straight.  You should hear our fights though, man.. Brutal on her side lol, but she is a sweety inside and outside, and I love her to death.  She is my #1 baby girl (and my only) always and forever<33333333333.  I got so much chores tomorrow, then i'm gonna probably try and get over to darins tomorrow maybe, and hang w/ him and my boi casey.  Monday.. back to school, and blah blah blah you know how it goes.

"event","well me and jen just got off the phone, she hung on me with a very very cheaply said ""love you bye"" type thing.  Life is so wonderful aint it?  You know.. things used to be so simple.. Love was so much fun.  We'd talk for hours upon hours just happy.. but now its changed.  in 1 day she started having a ""life"", she started ditching me more and more for her friends.  and i mean.. shit is just happening everyday. i'm not sure what to do.. its driving me mad crazy. i'd do anything for her, really.. but sometimes she really acts as if we don't even matter anymore. i mean .. for the shit she's said and done. liking this guy daren at school.. telling me to fuck you over and over. calling me names, bringing up my past constantly. making me feel bad for what i've done. how much more do i have to indur..
i love you jen.."

But hey! i can go do that at a local 7-11, if you know what im sayin ;) (the five finger discount) lol. well me and jen are doing good, had our bumps here and there but thats what love is all about.. right? she's got a new LJ btw, tears_.  I'm really impressed at what she's been doing with LJ as of late.  She is indeed a artist at this shit hehe. More so then i can say about myself.  My main project has been a game called: Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast (yes starwars).  Me and a buddy of mine just got a website up for it: http://www.guardians-of-fate.net ; i designed the site, he payed for the server.  So kinda like a far deal?  Man.. it's been crazy as of late.. alot of shit has happened.  But.. nothing really worth mentioning here, so ill leave it at that.  I love my baby girl jenny though<3333 (everyone knows that).  She is so perfect for me, and yes i still plan on marrying her and you know, just being with her foreverrrrrrrrr<33333333333333333.  But thats about it, everyone. Later all.

"event","well yea it's been awhile.  haven't updated in awhile but lets see.. a quick catcher upper here.  me and jen are currently going threw a semi-rough time, we agree'd on taking sort of a 1 week break, just to give eachother space.  i love her though.. so much.  i mean to those of you who are reading, if you have that special someone out there.  and you know about that feeling.. that feeling of overwhelming comfort each and every time you talk to that someone. just how they make you feel.. and the feeling you have inside of you.  me and jen have gone through some rough patches in our relationship, i wouldn't say this is a very bad one, but it isn't a good one.  but i know we'll pull through this.  i know we will.. i love her so much its unbelieveable.  i dearly hope she loves me atleast half as much as i do.  i do still intend to marry her hehe.  but as i was saying, yea i'm in school now (yipee) i'm doin alright, meeting old friends and makin some new ones.  i was asked to join track this year but i doubt ill actually join.. it's just to time consuming and i'd rather spend my time with jen and just chilling at home.. the usual hehe.  my site is basically dead as shit.. i kinda gave up on it. my creativity is basically gone with sites as well as my drive to make one.. oh well.  jen is doing great in school though, i'm very proud of her hehe.  highschool has treated her so well, and i'm glad she's having the time of her life.  casey (my bestfriend practically) moved away not to long ago, so that sucks.. but thats basically it ladys and gents.  i'll see you in oh.. say.. another month ;) who knows.. i might actually get into LJ again. and hopefully it'll last more then a few hours. well thats all everyone, later.

Me and Jen are doing great incase any of you are wondering.  Today she ran away from her home to a Park because of her asshole of a father.  It was like 5 miles away and the Cops came and got her.. Eitherway i'd love to kick the fucking bejesus out of her old man.. But oh well lol.  I'll be updating this journal alot more, so please people come back !! :).

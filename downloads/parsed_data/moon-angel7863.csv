"event","Okay, so I have a bunch to write. So first off, me and fish hung out on Sunday. It was fun and we saw Constantine and Final Destination (<the last one was at her house). And we were trying to figure out how we would survive if we ever cheated death and decided on diamond/plexi-glass cresent moon shaped bubbles. lol we're insane chicks. 

Yeah, we haven't hung out for a while....I wasted too much time hanging with my now ex, boyfriend. So we had fun and nothing was bugging me...not much at least. It was like the good old days where we agreed that guys sucked and they were a waste of time. And we wasted lots of time just chatting about anime and stuff. It was an awesome chick day. And we plan on having alot more of them...^^ 

But yeah I've been kinda slipping into a depression for like the past day or two. On Saturday my parents went out with a friend of mine's parents. So we all hung at her house...(me and my 3 sisters and her and her two sisters...all together, 7 kids) They went out from like 6:30pm to like 11:30pm. by the time they got back my sisters and I were tired and wanted to go home. As I anticipated, my mom was drunk, like always. 

I wanted to go home but she wanted to hang so I asked to walk how, with was 3 streets away. She said now and I asked again to leave. She started getting on me about how I never let her do anything and how I shouldn't expect anything from her again. I stood there taking the verbal beating without saying a word or making any movement. My dad called her name, trying to get her to calm down. And it got to the point where Karen yalled her name and told me to leave. 

And I was just sick of it. I went home and wrote two pades in a notebook that I have now declared my journal. Then I relized that everytime she gets drunk she says things that hurt me more than I've ever relized and I was just sick of it. I wrote her a letter and taped it to her stearing wheel on Monday and went to school. I avoided her that night by going to bed early and this morning by sleeping late since there was no school (snow day) And now it's bugging me and I don't know what to do... 

I almost started cutting but tried to keep myself busy by doing a puzzle. I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like crying but I can't and my friends don't seem to completely get how much this rips me apart. I want to run away, die, hurt myself and my mom.... I feel like my entire world is in shambles and there is nothing I can do. 

Maybe I'll go and do something stupid."

"event","Hey, mood swings rock! LOL. Anyway, yeah I can't figure out my mood... I'm kinda thinking, happy, sad, upset, nervous...thinking. I don't know, just so much shit going on in my head. 

Just, okay so my ex. wants to go out with me again. But I would rather not... just our relationship moved too fast and I can't hanlde something like that. I won't handle something like that again....

Another thing, I've found out who I am..kinda. I'm an insane lunatic Rabbit. I've decided that trying to define myself is not possible. I was always worried about who I was and who was the real me. Was it the insane hyper person that I showed to my friends, the perfect child to me parents, the strong, emotionless sister, or the violent, bitchy chick. And I'm finally relizing that each and every one of those traits are what makes up me. And I've relized in the past couple of months that I shuldn't have to compromise myself with anyone! <Okay so I've known that....

But I'm beginning to understand myself which is a scary thought. I don't know, it may sound stupid to you but I get it. And I've relized tat I love being how I am, even if others don't. And whether people classify me as a prep ('cause I'm hyper), a goth ('cause I can be depressed and I'm quiet), or a poser ('cause I do, dress, and act how I want and feel) is up to them. And I should take ever single title because I am preppy, gothic, and a poser...if being so makes me...me. 

I over think but I understand, but I think only I understand it."

"event","Another entry for the same day....I just got alot of junk on my mind. See, I still have feelings for my recent ex. I know I need to get over it and my friends are helping me but I can't ignore that I still like him. Not that i'm gonna act on it or anything 'cause that would be dumb and annoying. I mean I wouldn't like it if my I broke up with someone only to have they following me and trying to hook up with me again. Heh...I know from experience.

I don't know, t's dumb.... 

So I decided I needed a change. After all the issues and stuff going on I needed to do something different. So I did a bit of shopping and changed my style a bit. That and I did the unthinkable....I cut my hair. It used to be a little below mid-back and now that I've cut it, it goes to my shoulders....a little longer in front but it's a big change. I've never had short hair. And I really love it. I takes only a short time to brush and wash and it's light. Plus I feel like I look alot better. I'm kinda insecure about how I look, I don't act it but I am. I know i'm not the most awesome looking girl in the world but I try and I have a good heart. So I guess it's cool.

Yeah, I'm insecure and unsure and not confident like everyone... but I don't act it. I act cocky, strong, and unyielding.... I have to be, because if I don't everything cracks. I have family issues (mom's a drunk, a speed addict, and just mental) and so my mom fights with my dad and grandmother alot (<we lve with my grandmother becuase we can't afford a house). So when the fights happen my 4 sters all end up crying and taking sides and flipping out. I'm used to it so I don't act up. I just sit there and tell them it will be okay. unlike my sisters, I can't cry because if I do they get more worried and scared. I'm the oldest so they all look up to me. My 13 year old sister nearly worships me.

And it's scary sometimes...'cause I can't act how I feel. I can't be insecure or emotional because everything will fall and they will be tramatized. Seriously, I cried once because I had an emotional break down (I cried, couldn't stop, and didn't know why) and my sisters looked at me as if I was a monster or something. So I can't be enmotional. I have to be the happy go lucky, always smiling, helping everyone chick. And it's a pain at times....

So there's my random rant.... but I'm trying to be more open about howI feel and falling in love helped. It hurt but it helped..."

"event","Okay, So all my frienda have Live Journals and they keep telling me to get on, and finally I have some extra time so I am making one. ((Nah! Nah! To All of you who thought I wouldn't!!!)) Plus I've had alot on my mind and stuff and felt like I needed to create one....I'm bored don't mind me.

 Anyway so I'm just gonna use this entry to fill ya all in on my life. Since I have so much shit going on and you might need to understand that to understand me...if that is your goal. Maybe you're just bored like me and felt like checking stuff out.

So here goes....

Everyone who is my friend and even people who aren't, call me Bunny. It's a nickname I've had ever since I moved to Jersey which was like 3-4 years ago. See, my favorite anime was, still is, Sailor Moon. And my fave character was Serena, Sailor Moon...her nickname was Bunny so my friends called me Bunny. (They were also nicknamed after other senshi). It's cool and anime has alot to do with my past and my friendships. It's how I met most of my friends and a common thing that some of us still share. They're memories that will bind us together until the end of time....

Yeah and as you may have been able to see...I over think things. I enjoy to see the depth of thinks that most people brush aside. Heh... I'm wierd like that. And I'm a huge klutzy...my ex liked, still does, to torment me about being such a klutzy. I always end up tripping or falling but I laugh it off and smile. Most people find it funny and laugh with me. 

More About me.... i'm an over achiever. I alway have to do good at everything. I'm also in almost ever club in my high school. I'm a member of the marching band (I'm a flag twirling Freak XD), Debate Team, Robotics, Chess Club, Chorus, and The musical. I can't remeber what else.... Yeah, I'm a dork and a Geek, kinda goth/Punk, but a brain all the same. And I love being me even if others have an issue with it.

Recent Events....

Okay so high school is hard...sometimes. More emotionally hard than anything. I've had issues with my friends. I went out with a jr...big mistake...for a month, broke it off cause he was to horny...heh. Then went out with a nicer sophmore. That lasted about 3 months...until like 2 weeks ago and the break up was horrible. He didn't want to hurt me so he ignored me and blew me off in hopes that I would break up with him. I learned about him plan by reading him online journal and was shattered. He didn't have the courage to break it off and hurt me less... Instead he played a game and hurt me more. So I called him on the phone, called him a coward and hung up. Then I didn't talk to him for a week. Now I'm kinda getting over it but it hurt so much.

Instead of being sad and depressed he made me sad, depressed and pissed. Which those three emotions lead to an emotional break down for me... I was feeling a little like cutting but my friends snaped me out of it. I love them... And I'm getting ovber the guy, even though it still hurts and I still love him. I will get over it 'cause I have to! Can't hang onto the past forever....

Anyway....

So there's a bit about myself and recent events.... I will be adding more in a bit.... In a new entry cause this one is kinda full."

Maybe I'll just hook up with that kid. If it sucks, I'll call it off. I'm not getting attatched to anyone! Not anymore! I'll have my friends and my sisters, that's all I need. Fish, MasTas, and all them are all I need. Mouse Queen, join me when you feel like it. I'm back to the cold, heartless mode...when it comes to guys at least.

"event","Hey, so the title got your attention? Hmm...I donnu I kinda just feel completely surrounded. 

My family sucks as usual, my sister Kim's getting into her teenager stage and I've seriously thought of stabbing her. I have the most polluted mind I know of. T.T I'm such a loser. 

Anyway, yeah I've been trying to become better friends with Kamikaze, I don't know how I'll achieve that. But I'll try. It's kinda like a summer goal. Yeah, note to self, Aldrene has another girlfriend. (<Just some info I found out.) 

Oh, on that subject. I don't care!!! Yay! I'm so happy, completely out of love with him. (Well a little bit is still there but it doesn't matter it is a fragment. ((my whole theory of love applies unfortunatelyT.T))) My heart is healed...has been for like a while...a whole lot of months. But I miss the feeling of a close realtionship with someone. But I have my friends, who so kick ass.

That's all the love I need for now. Anyway...

So marching bands about to kick in. I'm really excited. I hope Kamikaze joins. It would be so much fun to hang out with him. (*koffplusimightgetachancetokisshimonthebandbuskoff*) <The reason I am a loser.

Heh...but marching band is my calling. I truely live for it. I've met the best people there and gotten in touch with different sides of me. Namely the perv and flirt within me. I don't knwo if thats's good or band but...he he. I like 'em. I dunno...I've kinda been spazzing.

Hmmm. I wonder what my sophmore year has in store. So much has happened already. I'm not worried though. love, heartbreak, fights, frendships, long roads, hard roads, short or easy...I know I'll always have my friend beside me. Plus I'm such a kick ass of a person I can handle everything.

As long as my friends don't to anything stupid...;)"

"event","Eep! I am bored as anything. Just sitting at the comp at school, I'm here til like 8:30 anyway.

On Saturday we had practice for the musical and I was suppose to pic up Aldrene, my ex. I called his house to tell him me and my mom were leaving to pick him up to be ready. His brother picked up the phone and said he wouldn't be home until Sunday. So I was kinda mad 'cause he didn't have the consideration to call and tell me. And he's an irrisponsible idiot so Mr. jewel cut him from the musical. And the musical is on less than a month and we have barely any guys to spare so he has to figure out who is gonna play him. 

I wish Aldrene was more upset about it though. He didn't really care which pissed me off because he may not have been a lead but he did have a part. And he should have shown up. so yeah, he's an idiot. Not like I care though.... *innocent whistle* Anyway....everyone thinks I like this Matt guy...which I don't. He's my friend, that's it! >> so don't think any more of it. 

Gonna change my layout with the help of Panda....add more later."

"event","Okay so the title is really long. Lets see if I can make the entry just as long. So I'm just hanging here in the computer room and I've had Hi-C which is the equivilant to coffee for me. Nothing much to do 'cept all my homework, my vocab story, and my world cultures project. None of them too fun so here I am just ranting about whatever. Hi everyone!

So schools the same same my parents kinda forgot they grounded me. A big part of that is because my sister got bad grades and they're too busy yelling at her. They still think I have an attitude but like I give a damn. Yeah, my friends think I'm a wiccan, gothic freak but I don't give a damn. I love them but... Yeah, most of the ones that know are cool with it. My dad and grandmother have no clue, for they would burn me at the stake. My dad would probly send me to a Catholic school and my grandmother would help. My mom is okay but she doesn't want me to convert, even though I already have...*koffthreeyearskoff* Yeah...some people are shocked by it but, of course, it's cool with me. ^^

Okay so my new fave bad is.... My Chemical Romance!!!!!

that's is for now...I gotta do some homework.... bai bai!"

"event","I'm just sitting in the computer lab at school. Justing killing some time since I got out of chorus. I have nothing better to do... Actually I do, it's called homework. And I have a ton of it, including an essay in english, some problems in algebra, some more in geometry, and some science questions. But I don't feel like it so I'll just spend forever on it when I get home...not like it's really hard or anything. I'm just too lazy to do it.

Anyway...I had like so many other clubs to go to but they got cancelled because of faculty meetings. I had robotics, gym (had to make it up so I won't fail), and chess but chess was moved to Thursday. So it's cool. I have alot to do tomorrow though....chorus until like 2:30, a debate to watch at Cherry Hill, and then a pizza party for debate at Cherry Hill, then I come back to the school and go to musical pracyice until like 7:30. So much to do...and I'm getting tired just thinking about it.

Purple i-pod sock!!!!! <(LOL JC) 

I have tons more to say but I gota check out my other sites....peace out <(curse you for that Johnny-brother)"

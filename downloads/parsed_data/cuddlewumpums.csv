"event","ok so I decided that after a few years I should give this a shot again.. so much has happened since my last entry.. first off I have 3 kids now 8,7,&3..Ariel, Skyler, & Riley.. they are my world.. I spent 13 months in a state prison that opened my eyes to the fact I better tighten up or I will miss more of my kids life.. moved to North Carolina for 2&1/2 years and now I and back in Florida. most of my family is dead and my mom is a lil sick, hence is to why I moved back home to Florida. I am a single parent now and trying to build my life back up. plan on starting back to school in the fall and hopefully by then be on my way to buying a big house for my kids, dog, 4cats, salamander and fish.. that is about it, for now.."

"event","well our lil ariel is doing wonderful. once i get my internet hooked up at the house, i will post pics. i bought myself a computer yesterday. so i can post more now, like anyone cares too much, but it makes me feel good to post stuff. 

ariel is maturing so fast. she will be 8 weeks thursday and is already flipping herself over in her crib. she has real good coordination, eye contact, and is very alert. she holds her head up real well for an newborn. i know she loves her daddy. if somebody is holding her and she starts crying, she will stop if she hears my voice or if i touch her hand, face, etc...

i love it when she mimics my expressions. she loves to play. i am so glad that we have a happy baby. i am just hoping that mine will be the same. my due date changed. this time it is final. i am having a c-section may 3rd at 7am. i am so ready for her to come out. this is the weirdest feeling ever. i feel like my stomach is mutating half the time she moves so much. i can't wait til i get to hold my skyler. 

well i am off now. i can't wait till 9pm. i am so ready to go home. i am pulling a double. i got here at 830am and leaving at 9. i am going to crash"

"event","well i found out testurday that i am 6 weeks pregnant. my family seems to be excited for me and says they will help me through it. we all seem to be coming together since my pawpaw died on sept 16th. the only thing i hate is that i got pregnant by force by somebody i only know him from his nickname. i can't seem to get anyone to tell me how to reach him. i do not want anything from him i just want a real name so i know what to tell my baby. another think is that my dr. told me my due date is 5/30/05. i am a number freak and this date means something to me. maybe this is a wake up call for me to get things together. like get a place to live, i am homeless right now, and get a job, which unemployement is helping a lot for time being.

 i have really screwed up the past couple years of my life, with some help at the end from another person. i am away from that person now, and i am not being abused anymore, nor will i take anymore abuse from anybody.

although this is going to slow down my transititon some, i still plan on going through it. i hope i have a boy. i am actually kinda excited thinking about it. my mom alwasy said she could not count on me for a grandbaby, but she is wrong. he is going to be beautiful.

my grnadma and i are looking at this nice ass house. we are thinking about buying it, so i will actually have something for myself later on. i will not fuck up on this."

"event","ok the latest about my wonderful life i created for myself.

i DID get my ass beat a couple weeks ago!

i finally got up enough balls to kick out a manipulative boyfriend and he seemed to convince people that i am pyscho.... which is partly true, but i was being abused by him and i have witnesses and pics of marks to prove it.

i am being locked up on the 8th (if you do not know the story i am not telling it), which i do deserve, but i think i have already received enough pain for what i did.

when i do actually go to jail i am looseing a job i have had for 5 1/2 years.
and will not beable to go to nursing school for another 5 years.

so far in the past two weeks i have received 34 death threat calls, two tires have been slashed, my system in my grandma's car was stolen (left with a smiley face on the stearing wheel(, two bullet holes in my kitchen windows after getting into a fight with a couple boys down the street because they wanted to show me what it was like to get my ass kicked by a ""real man"". so now i have two broke bones in my right hand, cuts all on my back, and fear to step outside alone.

my pawpaw is dieing at shands (one of the worst hosp. in the city)

my mom and memaw are having mental break downs and i am tring to stay strong for them. i just do not want to be in jail when he dies. it has been long nights and days. hardly any sleep, just work then to another hosp. to sit with my depressed memaw watching her lover die and i can't do anything to help her.

she told me she feels like dying along with him and she does not know what she is going to do when i go to jail, cause i am all she has to count on.

i have done more community service hours and tring to put in a different plea on the 8th. i hope the judge will except. (house arrest, longer proibation with more court ordered restitution etc....) i do not want to leave her right now. she needs me. my mom also, she is suicidal right now.

i received 24 hour eviction papers tonight before i left to go to work, with no place to go, or should i say no place to store my stuff. 

i have created such a wonderful life for myself and i deserve it all....to y'all who know what is up. trust me i am learnig from this and i hate myself for doing the stupid shit i did!!!!

karma is such a bitch!!!"

"event","ok about a month ago i did one of the stupidest things that i could have ever done in my life. i relize that i hurt a lot of people that are very important to me. i pretty much screwed myself in the ass with a 20 inch cock without lube. the people who know what i did hate eighter hate me or think that i am real fucked up in the head. some people probally do not believe that i am paying for it also. i i have done has caused me a great deal of stress and emotional problems. i was not myself when i did what i did. it was like another person inside of me that took over my body. to this day i do not understand what happened. 

i have started seeing a pychologist and he seems to think that i have a case of multiple personalilty disored along with bipolar. he said it will take a while for him to meet all the people within me, to try to be patient. 

i know that this is no real excuse for what i did, but i know that the real davin would not have done this. i have lost the only real supportive people that i had in my life, and will probally never get them back. it is all my fault and i deserve it. 

monday i go to turn my self in, that is if they do not move my court date again, to serve 6 months in jail. i am really not looking forward to this. i know that the only thing that could save me was if lindz and her mom dropped the charges. hell i still owe them a shit load of money and by me being in jail it is going to take me a lot longer to pay them back. i do not know what i am going to do with my animals. i know i am going to loose my apartment and basiclly everthing i have right now, but like i said, i deserve it.

well that is it for now. it is not like i update a lot, but i will try to beofre i go to jail for a while, if i do not kill myself first. i will be out of a lot of people's way if i do that.........."

"event","well i am hanging in there. i have found that i really like to smoke weed. my mom finally talked me into smoking some and now i do it when i get home from work to relax myself. it is great. atleast i do not have to spend money on it. i will never do that, if it is not free i will not do it...

one of the dr. her that i use to have a lil thing with like 3 1/2 years ago keeps making lil comments to me tring to get me to come to her house. tempting..... damn i just do not know what i should do....

i had a date the other night :) a girl named tashina, that i met a while back ago at a club. i was at plush with lindsey one night, after our break up, and this girl kept looking at me. we made eye contact a couple times. she was with a guy, but i do not think they were a couple. well on the way out she gave me her number. we have talked a couple times since. we finally hooked up wed. night. she came over, i cooked some good ol' southern soul food (that's what she wanted), we watched a movie then had sex. i really was not expecting anything, but she kept messing with me until she drove me crazy. it was not my fault, she started it all ;) i told her up front that i am NOT looking to get into any relationship for a long time, so i just hope she understands that. hell for the past 12 years i have been in one relationship after the other and all have ended in heart breaks, so i need a rest time to do some playing and relaxing. i am so over the relationships. i feel like i waisted 12 years of my life that i could have been doing stuff for myself. i have so much i want to do and now i am free to do it, first thing is to get the hell out of town!!! my goal is to be gone by the end of this year. i see it like this, i need to go to make my life better and stay out of other people's life that really do not want me around (atleast that is how i take it). so it will be good for many reasons.

ok, i am at work so i need to get off before i get caught."

it is times like that when i do realize how special i am to others and how much my help is actually appreciated. it is not very often that a nurse thanks her techs for a good job."

"event","while i was playing on the computer i heard a load meow. almost like a cat that was fixin' to fight. it was horible. so i stopped to look around and all i saw was sam, mom's cat. he would not come to me when i called him, which is unusual because he always comes when i call. so i kinda pulled him towards me for under the table. he let out the loadest cry i ever heard from a cat. it was so pitiful. so i check him over and pressed on different parts of his body to see if something did not feel right, i found nothing. no punture wounds, scratches, bumps... nothing. he just kept meowing. so i went adn told mom that i was taking him to the vet. when i got back down stairs he was on his back sprawed out adn crying. so i got down closer to pet him some and i saw his lil penis was out about 1cm and it was bloody. this freaked me out cuz lindsey just told me, the day before, how she had a dog that was put to sleep b/c it was bleeding internally. i pictured sam bleeding internally and i got scared. sam is the sweetest cat we have and so damn lovable. so i took him to my vet i have been using for like 13 years. come to find out he has a bladder stone and he can not pee. ouch!!! so they kept him to insert a cath. and break it loose ab=nd drain it out. so he will be home in a couple days. poor lil guy. in the car i was worried so much i started kinda cring everytime he let out a painful cry for help. he will be ok now though. i trust the vet i use. so"

I LOVE GREEN BOILED PEANITS!!!! they are the shit. i am cooking some now. the whole house smells like peanuts. i can't wait for them to be done. that is the part i hate, the 5-6 hour wait when cooking them.

"event","well it finally happened. the scholarship that i was awarded, the ceremony was last night. iwas so damn nervous. i had to do a speech in front of all these people i did not even know. i am a nervous person when i have to speek in front of people.

 one of the good things was that my grandmother came to support me. this is a big step for her, cause she still does not agree with my life  style. the scholarship was awarded to me from pflag (parents, friends of lesbians and gays) so she was surrounded by family. i thought she would be uncomfortable but she did real good. i think she even might start supporting them and getting to know more about the group. i hope she does. her first son, my uncle rudy, was gay. he passed away in 1989 from aids. she is scared i am going to get it. i have explained things to her about aids, but she still kinda associates it with the queers. so hopefully this will open her eyes with this matter and also help her to understand me better.

well when i did my speech i guess i did good. evertbody said i did a really good job. i know my voice was quivering alot. i am happy of myself because i did not freeze up like i have done in the past. it felt so good to get that scholarship for being queer *yay*. i am so proud of myself. i felt so loved last night, like i had the biggest family i have ever had. everyone was so nice that approached me. i met new people. i even had people come to me and tell me that they are in nursing and if i ever need any help i can call them. beth (a jasmyn volenteer) works in a local hospital as the head nurse of the surgical department told me that she would hire me when i needed to get the school credit for the nursing program and she would help me in any way. that was so fucking cool of her. i have never had so much faith and belief put in me. i am so thankful for everyone i have in my life right now. i have come a long way from where i was just a year ago. i am so happy."

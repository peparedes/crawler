"event","lisa got paid today. hecks yah. but when i was driving home from martins..i was coming down adams road, and right where it crosses with fir, if you look down adams, it's kind of like a big hill. and i started thinking about how when i was in florida, when you're on your way to the beach, there was always a hill before you got there..and then you go up the hill and, bam, you see the ocean. like-its no where in sight and then all of a sudden you see this gorgeous thing in front of you. it's almost overwhelming. well anyways, i've lived here for 5 years and never noticed that adams looked like that. and it reminded me so much, too much, of florida. except, there were no palm trees on the the sides of the road. god, it kills me that i cant go outside and see palm trees whenever i want. i think i've lived here too long. one second i was happy, and the next second i was homesick and crying.

im leaving for vacation monday, and the day we get back there's an honour recital show. double yay."

"event","boy meets girl.
boy loves girl. 
girl pretends to love boy.
ooops....

that's what this song is about.


""I Always Told You I Was A Real Clumsy One""

Laying in my room.
Your picture's on my dresser.
Staring back at me.
I can try and remember the days when we'd lay on my couch, whispering sweet nothings, 
and looking at each other like there's tomorrow.
Except there is.
And I definately woke up too soon.
Can you remember?
Please tell me you don't remember....

Do do do, what I do to you.
Pretending.
I'm sorry to say that all it ever was....
All I ever did...
Was pretend.
Whoever said honesty was a necessity?
Only for you.
Only for you.

I can't say sorry enough times for what I did.
Not that I would.
Well, maybe I'd say it to you one more time if I thought you'd listen.
I know you won't.

You know the pain will ease someday.
And I know the scars are forever.
If I could take it back, 
Maybe I wouldn't have let you waste so much time on me.
Even though you'll say you didn't.

Do do do, what I do to you.
Pretending.
I'm sorry to say that all it ever was....
All I ever did...
Was pretend.
Whoever said honesty was a necessity?
Only for you.
Only for you.

It's too bad loving you was so hard for me,
And loving me was so easy for you.
Hopefully it doesn't hurt to bad when you dream about me.
Because I know you do.
You gave me the only key to your heart, 
And I lost it along the way.
I always told you I was a real clumsy one.
Trust me with nothing, please.
I do it all for me.
All for me.

Whoever said honesty was a necessity?
Only for you, baby.
Only for you."

"event","i went to corey lake today with jessie. it was awesome. we went tubing and did all that fun water junk. man, being at the lake makes me miss the ocean so much. makes me homesick for palm trees, and laying out on a sandy beach and getting sunburnt only being out there for a half hour. then going into the ocean to cool off, and having a huge wave hit you and you get the salty water all in your mouth and eyes. and when you go home, you find all this sand in places you didn't know it was possible to get sand.
:sigh:
i really don't like indiana sometimes.

this is the perfect breakup song. kinda.

i heart hit the lights and omar hit on me lmao.

""Head Over Heels"" by Hit The Lights

I miss the way you make me feel so cold and alone so cold and alone. 
I miss the way you make me wait by the telephone to tell you
I'm trying to get by learning how to tie my own noose,
Cause you win and I loose it's been so hard but you've been so smooth...oooh.

So play it off and pretend you never knew what you got yourself into.
I'll play it off and pretend, I never meant a word I said.
Cause I'm starting to realize, 
That getting lost in your eyes, 
Was the worst move, 
Cause you win, 
And I loose.

And forever, isn't long enough, 
To get over giving so much up,
To someone who will throw it all away.
And a smile can only hide so much,
And I choose death over your touch, 
And fell head over heels straight to my grave.

I count my lucky stars, 
I thank God I've seen a smile like your's but don't, 
Take it as a compliment, 
And just know it's straight from the heart.
And now I'm driving around, drive to get lost, 
Just to find myself at any cost, 
If I use the breaks my heart will stop, 
We'll take a comfort in the dark.

And I keep sayin I know you're not mine,
But I'm prayin that you'll be alright,
Cause it's hard to let go of the ones you love.
And I keep hoping for the best, pass this wound who's in my chest,
I know one day my best will be enough.
Well I know one day my best will be enough.


I miss the way you make me feel so cold and alone so cold and alone.

I miss the way you make me feel so cold and alone so cold and alone.

I miss the way you make me feel so cold and alone so cold and alone.

I miss the way you make me feel..... alright.


And forever, isn't long enough, to get over giving so much up.
To someone who will throw it all away.
And a smile can only hide so much, 
And I choose death over your touch, 
And feel head over heels straight to my grave.
Well i fell head over heals straight to my grave.

"event","so nothing about last night was less than great. fall out boy was amazing. me and miranda were kickin it like chicago softcore. we're hardcore, just like jeff scott, lmao. just kidding. well, not really. so, before the show i definately met joe from fob. me and miranda were just sitting playing cards, and i saw him outside. yeh it was awesome. they played with the plain white tees, dont look down, and anberlin too. the first band can lick my butt because they sucked. the second band was borderline, and anberlin was..eh alright. i like them, not really, but they definately didnt do a half bad job. a lil to urm, babyish i guess for me. i dont know, they just arent my favorite. but fall out boy.
oh.my.gosh.
they rocked my socks. hardcore. it was nothing less than amazing. at the beginning of the show these little pussy chicks were like omg im so gonna cry when fall out boy comes on stage. i just looked at miranda and said if that chick cries im definately gonna punch her in the face. i hate people like that. dont go to shows if you're gonna be a pussy. oh yeh. then people were like, oh man if any of these people touch me im gonna freak out. wow. yeh. get away and dont come back is all that i could think at that moment. whatever. people like that are totally ridiculous. and to say one more time, yesterday was awesome and it was like the best show that ive ever been too. ill post pictures when i get them too.

"event","i hung out with jessie tonight. we had a ton of fun. we went to the mall in the afternoon kinda and i got a new purse. which i was in need of because my other one was falling apart. then we went to target,well because i had target money, and i got new hello kitty underwear and a hardcore shirt that says "" i love nerds"". ah god. luff it. so yeh then me and jessie went to steak n shake for some good food, haha yehhh, and she made a very important phone call in the car when we were done. hmm...because someone...who's name starts with an ""L"" and ends with a ""isa"", forced her too haha. its ok i love you jessie. well, then we went to the movies and saw the whole 10 yards and loved it. then again, you have to have the ""i think murder is funny"" kinda sense of humor lol. and now im at home with nothing to do. but i had an awesome day so its all good. the south park awesom-o 4000 was on so that made me happy. and im going to fall out boy+the honour recital next week. rock on. and getting my lip pierced friday, instead of wednesday because rebecca wont be there. which sucks, but what can you do? yeh nothing. im going to sleep in tomorrow and then go to where beth is babysitting. peace and love, to some people.

my nails are did. they look P-I-M-P. and i have pics to post but dont feel like it. and dood it sucks that no one comments.

"event","tears fall down my face tonight, because your voice has grown so distant. why do i feel the aching urge to make you part of me? why do i feel the aching urge to please you? Oh dear sweet dear one, do love what you do, or do you love what you do to me? Hide the lies among the others, so they wont pass through. You know you'll always be beautiful in my mind. i didn't know you had so many imperfections. I didn't see that coming. please want to tell me you're sorry. so long to our beautiful dreams. its like dust in the wind. the snowball effect is fully loaded. dont take my heart down with you. cant we be the ones standing up, while everyone else is sitting down? i think we're diluted by the misperception and complication. do you get this picture yet? obviously not to clear. im listening to you and only hearing static.

"event","i have never been more repulsed by something ive seen than today. jessie sent me the video of the man being beheaded in iraq, that her brother downloaded. we were both very hesitant to watch. do we or dont we? am i falling into line with all the disgustingly curious people in the world? have i fallen into the trap that those awful men wanted me to fall into? after much debate, we decided to watch. so i clicked on the link and waited impatiently as it downloaded. finally, the file reached 100%. the windows media player opened on my computer, and i quickly clicked play. if i could take it all back i would. i will never as long as i live be able to erase the images i saw today. it makes me sick to think that the men who commited that murder of an innocent man have no trace of guilt. they believe what they did was for the good of god. that god loves them more now for ridding the world of one less evil. one less american. well guess what? god hates you. not only do i hope that anyone involved in these types of crimes live the most unpleasant lives ever imagined, i hope they die the most unpleasant deaths imagined too. then be condemned to hell to burn there for all eternity.

i would definately would say tonite was incredible. the honour rectial was insanely good, and omfg, kids in the way rocked the fucking boat. i literally bumped into scott while i was ""moshing"". it was so great. i love shows. if it werent for shows, i would have no life. i love going more than anything.

i went to my moms tonight, and i was alright i guess. we didnt really get into any bad fights or anything i guess. so it was pretty smooth. 
im in pain from tonite. sigh.

people do crazy shit, and think that crazy shit is happening to them. personally....i dont really give a fuck. im sorry but im not going to be concerned about someone elses life. they are the decision maker in their life, therefore, theres nothing for me to be concerned about. its them not me. and when people try to make me feel bad on purpose, and have jealousy and possession problems...w0w. get some help, really. there's more to life than drama.




im going to see the honour recital, kids in the way, everyday sunday, garrgantua blardge, and union tonite at gcc. hopefully jessie will be going with me. its there last show before they start touring :(

rehersal today was a blast.
chris has a new girlfriend. that was fXing hard on me to see them together. i just kinda like starting crying when i walked past them. not for very long, just a little bit. it was more like shock then actually being upset. but yeh, it definately was 100% hard on me to see him with someone else. i was glad i worked out after i saw them, b/c i was so pissed i need to relieve that sheyt.

Is it possible to have what we had but start over again?
To be careful and take our time with it?
To fall apart but not quite give up...
To want more long after we've had enough...
 
AM I PERFECT...
FOR YOU, YET?
 
We walk away holding hands...
From the friends that met their bloody ends.
I'll set the whole town on fire...
If you only asked me to do it.
To give up everything...
If you'll be with me when we lose it.
 
Here we are again...
Breathing heavy and shaking violent.
Overbearing, you're breaking promises...
So many broken with just a simple kiss...
 
I'm over intoxicated with the scent...
The scent of your lipgloss mixed with the incense...
The sense of being alone, when you're right here...
The kiss remains, the resonance a stain...
On my very heart, the one you left to break.
 
AM I PERFECT...
FOR YOU, YET?"

"event","my dad called today. 
:sigh:
i dont really miss him or anything, i just want him to comeback because with my grandparents here i feel like i have ablsolute zero freedom. it makes me feel sick. ive got this amazing picture of palm trees that beth gave me from out trip. wow. it makes me cry. hard.

i hate english class. i hate school in general, but i hate english so much. not only does joe zens jump on my last nerve....but chris, just looking at him makes me so angry. i told crystal that i want him to be severely injured, just for my enjoyment. but i feel so terrible saying that....
i.dont.know.

i need some extra lovin right now, so if anybody's got some...feel free to let me know."

"event","<p>So yea back to what I was saying, last night was pretty interesting...Pretty much worked a full day at work and then decided you know what I am bored out of my mind, I need to go out and do something...So I decided fuck it I dont work 2marrow why not. I called up a friend of mine to see what she was doing, turns out her and a few friends are up to some hallows eve mischief...innocent stuff no smashing pumpkins, toilet paper...but we did decide to switch up peoples decorations so when they came out they would be extremely confused. Well that worked out well, lol. After all the shenanigans we decided to go graveyard ghost hunting...lol! Well needless to say sitting in a pitch black cemetary at 4am will scare anyone shitless, but it was all good. I mean sitting in pitch black darkness with hundreds of potential zombies laying around (aka deceased individuals) just staring at emptiness hoping to see something that resembles a ghost...is not for the faint of heart, but we did it and survived :D . Hmmm ok...Basically at this time I am working up an appetite, head over to the local marriott and grab some grub (courtesy of a coworker of mine, yea she worked there too), after the rub a dub grub I go home and take my ass to sleep...The adventure is a little better to explain in person but I guess once I get a webcam I can do videos...then all you fun people will see how puerto ricans talk XD</p><p><em><small>Posted via <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/cosysoftware_en/"">LiveJournal.app</a>.</small></em></p>"

"event","<p>So it's been a really along time since I posted anything up. Life is ok...I'm out of my parents house got an apt out in new britain. Still got my little blue scion but sold the nissan. I decided that it would be for the best, also shut down my drifting site (for now). I pretty much just work...go out every now and then to new haven to hang out with a buddy of mine down there, but it's usually just work. Been single since Feb ((that's a story in itself) but we are pretty much friends (and she lives with me). It's a pain sometimes but war can I say. Oh yea' I'm working for a good company, pays well and has awesome benefits. Do I like doing what I'm doing: no, do I deal with it: yes. Well that's just a small summary of what my life is like now. See you guys...</p><p>...oh and I will try to post more, especially since I have livejournal now on my phone (woot go iPhone)</p><p><em><small>Posted via <a href=""http://community.livejournal.com/cosysoftware_en/"">LiveJournal.app</a>.</small></em></p>"

"event","Well guys and girls it seems to me that I have been slacking in my LJ duties for a very long time. Well ill just give you the spark notes version then. Life here in connecticut is a whole lot different that it was back in FL. Im still working weekends, so that limits my abilities to go out and meet people alot, my days off roll in the middle of the week to the time everyone works and of course nobody goes out at night. The night life is weird, there are a couple of clubs but I havent been to any yet and they close early for my taste, im used to arriving at midnight to one am but here everything closes at 2am...whats up with that? Im not really a bar person and thats what seems to be in mass out here, eh. oh well! Havent met anyone out here yet that I would like to date, a majority of the ones I have talked to are too immature for me and its just annoying. I never seem to attract a nice girl but some young ""ghetto"" immature girl. So all thats still up there for review if you would like to say...I just want a nice girl for once...why is that so hard? Well the drifting thing you ask? its temporarily out of commission. The nissan is parked outside covered in snow with what im hoping is a screwed up fuel pump (Luckily I have a walbro in the garage to throw in...), the scion is doing good and its getting me where I need to go...Eh! well im off to work, today would have been my day off but I was sick for the past couple of days so I need to go in and make up some time...now that sucks!"

A whole year and my life still sucks, probably more than it ever did. I am working a good job and I have a brand new car but thats about it. No going out for me, no drinking, no hanging out with friends. Yea it sucks, but w.e. nothing I can really do about it now. Still single but thats my own choice, Im not ready to jump into a relationship that has kids involved and all the girls I seem to find or attract already have kids and well nothing against kids I like them but no thanks. I want to be able to go out anytime and do anything without having to worry about if the girl has a babysitter and then we have to be home before 9 and all that crap. That can wait for when I am in my 30s. So yea like I mentioned before I got a new car, picked up a 06 Scion TC RS2.0 lol sounds like alot but its the special edition I will throw up some good pictures when I get them. Oh well time for me to finish getting ready for work."

"event","So if all of you couldnt tell I went out and picked up a new car, no worries though I still have the s13. I needed something that was reasonable, reliable and something that could last the daily abuse that it will receive. So why not a Scion, I like it came with a bunch of options that makes my days a little easier...oh yea btw its my first car with a working A/C. lmao!

So yea im trying to start off on a new track. Im working hard long days trying to make that paper. I dunno it just seems legit work is too much work. Not enough pay for all of the work that is done, well if you think about it when is it ever. Oh well, im still trying to get my foot in the door and finally get hired full time during the week instead of working Fridays through mondays. The schedule is killing me mentally and I need to go out and have some fun, which if many of you dont know is impossible in the state of connecticut. App. there is shit too do mon-wed at night and all my peoples work during the day so thats out of the question...sigh! I need a girl.

Well my bday is up and coming in 2 months and Im going to be making a quick trip down to FL for a couple of days and just go buck wild. Then im coming back up with the cuz so that we can tear up CT. Hopefully when I go down I can see a few people I havent seen in a long time. Man sometimes I wish I just stayed back there. It seems im doing worst up here, even with the better job and new car. I have no life and very limited amount of friends which are all from the site. I dont go out and meet people so its hard. But then I really cant cuz of my damn work schedule...

Oh well hopefully things will work out for the best because right now life is just there. We will see and Ill keep my true peoples updated with whats going on."

"event","Wow its been a while since i updated this thing. But yea things have gotten pretty interesting since I moved from fl. Been trying to be a different person up here, more active person (basically not a lazy fucking bum). Not too long ago I started a drifting based site in the state of connecticut and in the process of starting it up and spreading the word I have met some really good people but I have also been stabbed in the back by a select few. These few wont be dealt with by me, why you may ask? well I have been developing a more professional non violent attitude when I moved up here so I will be letting karma deal with them. Well whatever you live and you learn and I learned that I wont be doing things that way again.

Oh yea for those who know me or have known me for a bit you will know that I have been slacking when it came to signing up for school and what not, but yea! I am officially back in school up here in ct. and yes I am trying to make something for myself. I amgoing to school for graphic design and yes thats my major, minor is photography.

Recently my cousin came up to visit me from FL. So I have been occupied with my time as of late, I did take a few days off from work and what not but other than that we have just been hanging out. He flew up on monday and I picked him up we went to the mall for a bit and just wandered around and drove around for a bit, I took him into ""town"" (if thats what you want to call it). So yea' he saw main st. lmao yes we have a main street, its like little town usa that you see in all the movies. Tuesday we headed over to New York, walked around times square for a little bit and headed over to chinatown and wandered our happy asses around there for the day! We bought a few things...lol more like alot. Probably 99.9999% of it was anime related, but at those prices who can pass it up. Wednesday we didnt do too much, I slept in a bit from the night before. I had to go to school at 1pm so I did that, got an A in the illustrator project that I am working on. We went to go see Underworld Evolutions (Kate Beckinsale is one of the hottest woman in the world, especially when shes wearing the whole vampire gothic look). Today we wandered around again, went to go play some lasertag and had to wait. So while we were waiting we headed over to a ""local strip club"" in the afternoon. Man was it boring! the girls just walked around like they were bored and they didnt even dance on stage, they kind of just stood there watching tv. Man was it boring...well my cuz got a dance, a wack one...so was mine but w.e. We got around to playing laser tag and that was ridiculous - we had a group of business people, another group of ""thugs"" and me and my cousin. Needless to say it was quite interesting, but yea thats whats been going on with me as of late. I have left out alot of other things that were either unimportant or I just didnt want to piss myself off..."

Well I started up my own drifting organization up here ctdrifting.com. Its pretty cool, met alot of good people and were trying to make this a big thing on the east coast. I work for an insurance company called the Hartford over in simsbury, its an ok job kinda' boring but the pay is really good and a lot better than my old job at the warehouse. Only complaint I have is the drive there, 45 min drive to be exact. It gets kind of boring after a while and thank god I just put a sirius in the car, the satellite radio makes the drive a little easier."

Things have been pretty good since I got up here. Launched my new site, met a bunch of people who are pretty kewl. So other than being jobless and broke I cant really complain about things up here. All I can say its no florida, im used to things being open 24 hours a day and it seems like if I want that I have to take my happy ass to downtown hartford, which is about 20 min away, but then again everything is."

"event","Well guys I havent been on here in such a long time I dont even know where to begin. First off I dont know if I told you guys but I recently acquired a Nissan 240SX. Its a 1990 hatch style, red with immaculate paint, good interior and good motor, only downside to it is that its running the SOHC KA motor. (Weaker motor for the n00bs that dont know). Then I finally got the nerve (and the cash) to move out and into a place with a friend and one of my cousins. It was pretty kewl while it lasted, but alot of shit has been happeneing that is causing me to leave. First off my parents gave me the choice to move up to connecticut with them and just go to school. Its a pretty sweet deal considering that I will finally be able to do something with my life, but the thing is that I didnt want to leave south florida. Its nice down here and this is the only place I have ever known. Like I said it was only a consideration, well that is until today. Today I go to work as usual, do my work and Im on my way to lunch when lord and behold my dickhead manager comes out of nowhere and gives me the I need to speak to you line! At first I was thinking to myself what did I do, is he going to write me up for calling in yesterday or something along those lines. Turns out that me and 2 other people are getting laid off for ""lack of meeting company goals""...wtf is that! It just sounds like some randomn bullshit to fire me for! But I cant do anything about it because florida has this little law that protects businesses from being sued for firing people. so in other words any company in florida can fire someone for any reason (excluding racism, sexism, dissability, etc.) and get away with it...so yea now I have to move out and move up to connecticut...gdamn esp. when I thought my life was going to be good for once!"

"event","hey guys well I just got my car back from the shop, it was missing like hell (not that i cant find it, but that it was having shuddering problems). So I took it too the mechanic and I got raped when it came to the money...ahhh!!! $400+ to fix an oil leak, change my distrubutor and something and new spark plugs. Yea' so now it runs better but still alot of cash.

I just got my bonus check (more like some change thrown at me) so I went out and bought Enthusia Proffesional Racing for ps2.
<img src=""http://img.gamespot.com/gamespot/images/2003/all/boxshots2/920586_54309.jpg"">

and Forza Motorsports for Xbox.
<img src=""http://img.gamespot.com/gamespot/images/2003/all/boxshots2/920720.jpg"">

both some pretty badass games, even thought I like Forza better because you can modify the cars and make them faster where as Enthusia is just nothing but stock cars, but its the most realistic driving game you could probably get!

p.s. - I still need to get the steering wheels for both systems and nothing will ever beat GT4.

Well now back to life, nothing new...im trying to have a more positive attitude towards work, its kind of hard because my manager is a complete asshole, but im not trying to let it get too me. I still dont know if im staying or going when it comes to me moving to conneticut from sunny south fl. Ahhhh I dunno...

anyways just got home from the junkyard. nothing good...just broke a few cars, took off a few parts and nothing new!"

"event","Well whats up people, sorry I havent posted in a while...havent been in an updating mood...Well I just recently found out that my parents want to leave florida to move to conneticut. I know they want to move up there because the jobs are a little bit easier and the its a change of scenery. I dont really think that im going though, I went up with my dad to help him move and its just not me, well not now. I had so much plans that now I have to put them on hold and it really sucks. For one I have been saving up money for months to buy another car with less problems (i cant buy a new one!) and that isnt going to happen now because im going to have to use the money for an apt. I could go and save the money but conneticut is just a big change that I dont want to go through right now! I just finally made some friends that I hang out with every weekend, there all good people and then now for once im in something that I enjoy. Well w.e., work is the same boring piece of crap that I always have to deal with. Nothing new there, we have a new manager but same old shit! Love life is still shit, havent found me a girl that I like yet! what else is new. I have started to advance a bit in photoshop, its nothing major but I have learned a few little tricks here and there. Im hoping to start school soon, it looks like if im really going to go back, im going to have to do it now, because once im on my own its going to be really hard for me to start school for awhile. I so much that I need to spend time and money on and not too much money coming in from my job. Its decent but not enough for everything I need to do before I leave. I need to fix so much on my car, cuz now I have to keep it...wont be able to get another one and I still have alot of things that need fixing...ahhh!!! I really hope things start to look up for once soon. This dreading shit all the time is killing me softly.

also im kinda pissed because I have been planning for a few months now to go to Ocala for a DD6(Drift Day 6). Which is a big drifting competition in florida. I couldnt go after months of planning and saving because my mom decides to tell me last week that shes going to conneticut to visit my dad and shes leaving my sister here and I have to watch her. WTF! I mean come on, not the same fking weekend im suppoused to go out of town....so yea! im kinda pissed..."

Its incredible because you never realize things until it happens. I feel sorry for his family and his closer friends, he was an all around good person and he will be missed!

You're a big girl. If it's up, put it down.

1. Sunday sports. It's like the full moon or the changing of the tides. Let it be. 

1. Shopping is NOT a sport. And no, we are never going to think of it that way. 

1. Crying is blackmail. 

1. Cheerleading will NEVER be considered a SPORT! Auto Racing is. 

1. Ask for what you want. Let us be clear on this one: 
Subtle hints do not work! 
Strong hints do not work! 
Obvious hints do not work! 
Just say it! 

1. Yes and No are perfectly acceptable answers to almost every question. 

1. Come to us with a problem only if you want help solving it. That's what we do. Sympathy is what your girlfriends are for. 

1. A headache that lasts for 17 months is a problem. See a doctor. 

1. Anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an argument. In fact, all comments become null and void after 7 days. 

1. If you won't dress like the Victoria's Secret girls, don't expect us to act like soap opera guys. 

1. If you think you're fat, you probably are. Don't ask us. 

1. If something we said can be interpreted two ways and one of the ways makes you sad or angry, we meant the other one. 

1. You can either ask us to do something or tell us how you want it done. Not both. If you already know best how to do it, just do it yourself. 

1. Whenever possible, please say whatever you have to say during commercials. 

1. Christopher Columbus did not need directions and neither do we. 

1. ALL men see in only 16 colors, like Windows default settings. Peach, for example, is a fruit, not a color. Pumpkin is also a fruit. We have no idea what mauve is. 

1. If it itches, it will be scratched! We do that. 

1. If we ask what is wrong and you say ""nothing,"" we will act like nothing's wrong. We know you are lying, but it is just not worth the hassle. 

1. If you ask a question you don't want an answer to, expect an answer you don't want to hear. 

1. When we have to go somewhere, absolutely anything you wear is fine...Really. 

1. Don't ask us what we're thinking about unless you are prepared to discuss such topics as baseball, the shotgun formation, or monster trucks. 

1. You have enough clothes. 

1. You have too many shoes. 

1. I am in shape. Round is a shape. 

1. Thank you for reading this. Yes, I know, I have to sleep on the couch tonight; but did you know men really don't mind that? It's like camping."

"event","Wow it just seems that everytime I try to get a new or at least a newer car something never goes my way and I never get it. WTF do I have to do to get a new car. Im just trying to get one soon because it feels like its going to die soon. I just hope that it happens soon because im really worried that something might happen to my car soon and then im going to be stuck carless...and thats the last thing that I need right now.

On a better note. I did go out yesterday for a bit, my dad came down from conneticut so we went to sawgrass yesterday and I actually bought something...lol. I went to the ecko store because they were having a ridiculous sale, $5hats, $10shirts, $25sweaters, and I even saw a leather jacket that I want to get...it costs $180 and it went down from almost $500. So I was like WTF and just bought w.e. I had enough money for. I didnt really spend too much though because my funds were limited and I came to the mall to get something else. I eventually found it at the Manhatten Jewelry Exchange. So yes I am a proud owner of some silver dogtags...lol Im strange and I know it...but oh well.

I went to the beach later on that night with my cousin, we were suppoused to go on Friday but I passed out at home and that never happened. So we just went to Riverfront and Las Olas too just chill out for a bit. So its all good, we bought some Gunkha cigars (cogniac cigars) and some coronas so we were good and then made our usual trip to IHOP. We got our grub on and just went home!"

I cant protect you without holding a sword...
I cant embrace you while holding a sword.

We are drawn to each other 
like drops of water, like the planets
we repulse each other
like magnets, like the colors of our skin

If I were rain,
that joins sky and earth that otherwise never touch,
could I join two hearts as well?

People have hope
Because they cannot see death standing behind them

(from BLEACH, for you non-manga fans)"

"event","Think about this... You may not realize it, but it's 100% true. *PLEASE READ THIS WHOLE POST IT'S SO DAMN TRUE* 
1. At least 2 people in this world love you so much they would die for you. 
2. At least 15 people in this world love you in some way. 
3. The only reason anyone would ever hate you is because they want to be just like you. 
4. A smile from you can bring happiness to anyone, even if they don't like you. 
5. Every night, SOMEONE thinks about you before they go to sleep. 
6. You mean the world to someone. 
7. If not for you, someone may not be living. 
8. You are special and unique. 
9. Someone that you don't even know exists, loves you. 
10. When you make the biggest mistake ever, something good comes from it. 
11. When you think the world has turned its back on you, take a look: you most likely turned your back on the world. 
12. When you think you have no chance of getting what you want, you probably won't get it, but if you believe in yourself, probably, sooner or later, you will get it. 
13. Always remember the compliments you received. Forget about the rude remarks. 
14. Always tell someone how you feel about them; you will feel much better when they know. 
15. If you have a great friend, take the time to let them know that they are great. add this as a comment to ten of ur friends tonight and at midnight your true love will find you. Something good will happen to you at 2:25 tomorrow. Get ready for the biggest shock of your life. Whoever breaks this chain letter will be cursed with 10 relationship problems for the next ten years......"

well on to other things, work has been ok things have been a little more laid back from before, this new position really lets me just hang out. Dont get me wrong its still work, but since I dont have to do so much pointless running around it just feels like its that much more easier. The holidays were alright, we tried to have a good family holiday but it was hard because my dad is leaving to conneticut soon so it was just impossible. For those of you who dont know already, my dad is like the only person that I get along with in this house. He is the only one that doesnt find all my ""art"" and ""drifting"" hobbies to be stupid and a waste of time. He is the only one that backs me up at anything I want to do. Well he worked for this electrical company that was contracted by FPL (Florida Power & Light). Well they lost there contract with them and basically lost all there jobs. There is no work for them so they are laying people off or relocating them to other states. My dad got a better offer over in Conn. but it would require him to move over there for some time. So well next week im going to go over there to help him move and then come back to this place called home (more like hell). I dont really sleep at night and I wake up early to go to work. So its just bleh 24/7, then on top of that Im babysitting a 15yr old because my mother doesnt trust her. So yea' right now I really just need to get away, I would like to move so hopefully that will happen soon. If not im going to pour everything in my drifting hobby and make it my life. I need something other than the stress of being here all the time."

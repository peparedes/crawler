we went to lilo and stitch first.....drag...it really wasnt that good.i dont see what the big deal is...then we went to hmm i think we went to phillar magic then to the haunted house then me and ale went on splash mountain by ourselves with out the two cousins

it sucks because there were these guys there...(i like nerdy looking guys) anywho they didnt even look at us we were just like DAMN! then there were these other guys at the exit and we were like ooh...but the only person who turned around was the little kid...we can only pick up little kids..isnt that sad we are like pedifiles...

anywho then we went to space mountain with out fast passes i taught them my little tricks with the fast passes it was great because me ale and my brother were able to go again...the first time we were going to give them four fast passes for 6 people but then i went to give them to him and they all fell i was just like OH GOD!
then the guy picked them up for me and he was like hang on for a sec but he also dropped one and it wasnt ours and i saw it on the floor so i was just like ...okay!! so then there were two more and me and ale went again but my dad made me take matt so we just got an error one...

in the line all of a sudden stephanie was like i feel like throwing up i was just like...oh God why do you hate me but it was just nerves i get that too.........sometimes anywho when she got off she was like i want to do it again so we were like hah! no! we are selfish and we need to go twice! and speaking of selfish i told matt that ale was going to go in the front this time and he was like no im going in the front and he made ale sit in the back ....selfish matt

anywho amy came to spend a few nights with us over here she brought her cat ella the people ovciousoly just dont care that there is a cat even though we arent aloud to have animals what ever i dont care i like cats accually i dont mind them.

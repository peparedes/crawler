"event","Are you KIDDING me? Seriously....wtf. I dont care who reads this.....I'm so angry right now I could scream.

Last night Dan and his friend Travis came to MD to look at cars to buy (for Travis)....then they were going to go to their friend's house (in ROCKVILLE....which is where I live....they live about 8 min from me).
Katie was over, and I told Dan that we would meet up for a drink in Rockville- considering I never get to see Dan....and havent seen him in a week. He says ok....and Katie and I are leaving the house for the bar/restaurant- and he calls and says he cant meet me. I was pretty upset, because the bar I was going to is literally 3 MILES from his friend's house. Dan said that his friend didn't want to go. Seriously, though......the place where katie and I were- is RIGHT next to where the highway starts. So it's NOT out of the way- at all. It is ON the way home, actually. They actually would PASS the place we were to get home. He couldnt even stop in just to say hi? Dan lives at least an hour away from me- I see him once a week- and he's moving to another state in less than a month. They are in my state- IN MY TOWN- and he can't get his friend to go 1 mile out of his way just to say hi? Neither of them had to work today....so its not like they were worried about being out late.
And if it is true- that his friend wouldn't stop for 5 min on the way home so that my boyfriend could say hi to me- and meet my good friend for the first time.....well, that's shitty too. Lets just say that Katie's first impression of Dan wasn't too fabulous. Katie says that any good friend wouldn't mind stopping for 5 freakin' minutes so that that person could say hello to their significant other that was EXPECTING them to be there.....and waiting. does that make sense? I know- I'm rambling. My thoughts are all so jumbled right now.
So, I tell him we need to talk, because I was clearly VERY upset about the situation. He tells me that he's going to bed because he doesn't want to deal with anything right now. NO WAY. That's now how I roll....I don't leave situations like this unsettled. I know that he didn't want to talk about it, and I didn't want to force him to do something he didnt want to do....but I wouldn't have been able to sleep last night not knowing where we stood.
I tell him why I'm upset and he says ""Well, I was going to see you tomorrow anyway...why did I have to come see you tonight?"". OOOOOOOOH MAN. That set me off. I'm his girlfriend- i didnt know that we couldnt see each other 2 nights in a row? That hurt me so much....does he not care at all? When I'm with someone, as we all know, I want to be with them every second of every day. I feel so worthless. So I tell him that if he's going to be like this, then I don't want to go to Baltimore....hoping that maybe he would say he was sorry for being a dick- and that he would say something like, ""I've been looking forward to spending time with you all week, I'd really like to still go with you. I promise things will get better tomorrow, I just need to clear my head"". Then he tells me he's upset because when his friend dropped him back off at his car, someone had hit it. I told him I was sorry and that I felt bad because he definitely didn't need that right now. 
However, this didn't settle things enough for me...and I don't know why.

So I call him back a few minutes later and he tells me that he cancelled the hotel room. 

We were supposed to meet our friends Nikki and Nick tonight- and stay the night together in Baltimore.

I guess that was the icing on the cake for me....obviously I'm not worth salvaging. He didn't even try to make things better....I took the first step by calling him...TWICE...to try and rectify things- by telling him why I was upset and how much my feelings were hurt tonight. There's not much else I can do.

Is it selfish of me to say -I just wish that he would put up a fight for me? When I'm upset- instead of being a huge asshole- to just say something nice? To at least TRY and make things better? Obviously I'm not worth it.

I feel like everything I have is slowly slipping away. Maizy has been hurt since October....I rarely am allowed to take her out of her stall and handle her. I basically get to sit with her in her stall and stare at her and groom her. I cry every day I go out to the barn. I wish I knew why she was hurting- and what I could do to make her better. I feel so empty right now- without her being well. I don't even know how to explain it. She's my world- and I don't even get to enjoy my time with her right now....she's in pain and neither of us can do anything about it. Bailey is for sale.....so that maybe I can buy another horse that is ready for high level competition. I have people asking me all the time- how is maizy doing? why haven't you been showing? Are you showing in florida again for the winter? I have to keep making excuses for us.....Allie and I have discussed everything- and we feel it is best that everyone not know about Maizy's whereabouts and what is going on with her. That's how rumors get started.

Can't something just go right for once? Can't I just find someone that feels about me the way I feel about Maizy? Unconditional love...no matter what. 

I'm leaving this entry public...because I just don't care what anyone thinks anymore. You need to know how I feel- since you won't listen to me when I talk to you about how I'm feeling. I tell you over and over again, but it doesn't seem to process in your brain.
I hope you find someone that understands you more than I do. Maybe I'm too hard headed, too sensitive, too selfish, too self conscious......maybe our personalities clash. I am a strong believer in the fact that- I can't change someone. Someone has to change themselves- because they want to. Because they want to see a difference. No matter how hard I try- I don't think I can get you to understand me- and in turn, I can't ever begin to understand you. You keep all of your feelings bottled up inside. 
I'm sorry things ended the way they did. I cared about you so much. I wasn't scared of the future. I planned on trying my hardest to make things work after you left for school. Maybe I should have tried harder while you were still here."

"event","Let me start off this entry with a little background info. Before I graduated from college, I realized that I didn't want to become and equine veterinarian after all and decided I wanted to go into horse breeding and genetics and have a nice breeding facility with world class stallions and broodmares. Luckily, my father was supportive and offered to help me start my business with my first stallion. I have an agent in Holland named Wout, and he helped me pick out some stallions. Instead of paying $1,000,000 for a  stallion and $20,000 to import him and put him in quarantine, I decided to buy a young colt with excellent bloodlines for a significantly cheaper price and only $7,500 to import. I bought Vocalando before he was even weaned from his mother, and he came over on a plane to America to meet me on July 5th, 2003. He was a yearling and probably the cutest thing I had ever laid eyes on. He was incredible- beautiful and stunning, excellent movement and a great tempermant. The vet gave him shots, the farrier trimmed his hooves, I led him around, I bridled him, put wraps on him, etc. without a fight. As he grew older he had begun to realize he was a stallion. I thought since I had handled him since he was a year old and since he was imprinted at birth and handled daily all of his life, that he would be easier to handle than the majority of stallions. I was dead wrong. He was so dangerous. He wasn't mean, he was just very bossy. And a horse that is 1,000lbs easily bosses me (110lbs) around. I sent him away to a trainer which was costing me over $2,000 a month. After a year, I took him back home thinking he would be better since he had been professionally trained. I was dead wrong, again. He mounted me, bit me, kicked me, you name it...I was in and out of the hospital with injuries weekly. I sent him away again and he kicked his groom in the head. They worked with him for another year until I decided that I couldn't afford him to be with professional trainers all his life...he was MY horse and I wanted him to myself. I made the very emotional decision to castrate him. My dad decided (since it was his horse, technically) that since he was of no use to me anymore as a stallion, that I would have to sell him. I refused. I don't care how many times he hurt me or put me in the hospital- I was not going to give up on him after 2 years. I got a job and my dad signed him over to me. He is the first horse I have TRULY owned (my dad owns all of my horses since he buys them and pays for them). I pay for his board, his shows, his vet bills, his shoes. He is MINE. He was gelded in April and as of June- he was a totally different horse. He is calmer than my 11 year old Start Showjumper mare. He is the most loving animal and is the kindest horse on the planet. He made a 360 degree turn around from his stallion days. He still cannot go out with other horses because he is too dominant, but he loves his grooms and he loves his mom. He is the easiest horse to ride.....walks trots and canters like a champion (he is SUCH a good mover). I started taking him to some horse shows and showing him in some hunter under saddle classes. At first, it was overwhelming to him since when he was a stallion he was ridden ALONE all the time. He had no contact with other horses. He was fine, very calm, he just didn't pay attention to me at all, especially in the ring. We still got some low ribbons in good company since he is a great mover...I guess they looked past his hops and minor bucks. haha. He has been to 4 horse shows....and at this 4th horse show Bailey (his barn name) won his first class. I was so happy and so excited- I cried tears of joy. I had worked my ASS off since I've gotten him and it finally paid off. I was so proud of my little man....and he knew he was a good boy- he pranced out of the ring. I am so lucky...I love my little Bailey and I am SO proud of him! Now that he has turned 3 years old, I have started jumping him over some small fences and he LOVES to jump! I can't wait until he's older."

"event","Back from the horse show and back to work. Bla.
The weather this weekend was absolutely amazing. The temperature was perfect, it was sunny, nice breeze....it was so lovely. Both of my mares were incredible. I showed Maizy in 2 classes on Saturday and Parmantha in one. Maizy won the first class and Parmantha was 9th...she was really good, but when I was 2 strides away from one of the fences, 2 of the potted cedars blew over and fell in front of the fence. I had to stop and they had to fix them. Obviously, it was unfair, but....there is nothing they can do. We told the steward and basically they told us: ""that sucks"". Oh well...at least she was good. Half of my class didn't even make it around the course. Maizy was great in the second class, but I was an idiot. Only 3 of us made it to the jump off....and I was being an idiot  because Ben Meredith was watching me (I LOVE HIM) and it made me super nervous...so I circled....but I was still 3rd. The next day, I showed P in one of the adult classes and was double clean- she was outstanding...and I was 2nd. Both mares were incredible in the classic. Maizy won the classic by like 3.5 seconds and I had 4 faults with P in the first round and was 5th. There were 3 classics that day- all the same course. My classic was last...the fastest time for the entire day was 30.54 seconds. I was 27.2. Maizy wound up being champion of the adult jumpers by just doing 2 classes.....she was fab. I won over $1,000 which was really nice- so I paid for the entire horse show (hotels, trainer, trailering, food, gas, classes, etc)

here- you can look at my results: http://horseshowsonline.com/HSSNet/ShowIntro.asp

Horseshowsonline.com also has my results from Upperville Colt and Horse Show (where I won all 3 classes), Loudoun Benefit (where I won all 3 classes, and Lexington Spring Premiere (I think I was 1st, 1st and 2nd).

Tonight I have a dinner date with drew. We'll see how that goes.

ok....back to work...BLAAAA."

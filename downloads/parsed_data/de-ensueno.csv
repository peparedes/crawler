i woke up this morning to check my schedule and found out that my math lecture goes until 5:20 monday, wednesday, and friday, so i went to hovde to get that changed.  i won't find out about that until tomorrow.

then i went to work from 12-4, and decided that i will work the 7-11pm shift tomorrow...that's going to be rough and boring.

i haven't seen brad since early this morning when he left.  he hasn't really called, or acted like he's wanted to hang out.  i'm really emotional lately, just crying over everything.  none of my friends are here right now, all of my close friends that are here are in brad's frat so now i feel like they are more of his friends than mine.  i just wish that he would call me and stop acting like such an asshole.  i just feel so paranoid about everything...if he would just call and let me know that it's ok then everything would be all right.  it's as if he didn't want to hang out with me at all today.


life's rough, i want classes to start so i can fill up my day with something other than boredom."

It was good and bad and informative, and I just don't know how to describe it.  I don't like being alone now, because when I'm alone I think about it.



I go to school tomorrow.  I am very excited but really I have just been hanging around with my family all summer and I know that I am going to miss them terrible amounts.  Plus, I'll be at school for a couple of days when nobody else is there.  This is insane.  I haven't gotten a hold of Nikki yet either, so hopefully me moving in early isn't a problem, and I'm curious as to when she's going to get there.

I really really really REALLY believe that I deserve to get good grades on these finals (and in these classes) because of the long amounts of work and long amounts of suffering that I have endured during this terrible miserable summer.

So, please, a little help?

Things are starting to look busy and stressful now that I am looking at the schedule for the rest of the week.

I just took my last Chemistry quiz, and I think that it went really well.  Tonight I have to do two C programming codes (well, one just has a bug and I need to fix it), and then I need to study study study, then tomorrow I need to do possibly two more programming codes and a take home math test that I need my brother and dad to look over to make sure that I did awesome on it.  I have nothing else to turn in for chemistry after today until I take the final on Wednesday.

BUSY BUSY BUSY, but alas, I am almost done!


Then on Friday I am going to Indy and that's going to be just plain fun...I'm going to the NASCAR race with Brad and his parents, yeah, we're trash....haha, no, it's going to be fun though, he said that usually there is a party the night before that race, although I'm never too impressed when we hang out with his friends.  Some of them are really cool but I never really want to get messedup around a bunch of people that I don't know.


Monday we are going to go to Six Flags in Louisville for my birthday, Brad's never been on a rollercoaster, so that should be fun for him.

Last night we went to Clybourne and just hung out, and it really was good to see people, because that could be the last time that I see a lot of them before I go to school.  Of course I wasn't messed up and everybody else was obliterated beyong belief, but that's ok, because I still had a good time.

I still had that little voice in the back of my head that kept lying to me and saying ""if you turn around then Brad will be there with his arms out to just give you that much needed hung that you have been craving for the past week and a half.""  And I just had to keep getting mad at that little conscious and tell it ""stop tricking me, you're making my life miserable.""

And I have found that it's not that I just want him around, it's that I NEED him around.  Something is always missing when he's not here, something is never meeting up in the middle like it's supposed to.  I can't wait to go there this weekend, I think that it will turn out to be one of the best reunions we'll have had this summer.

"event","Sometimes he says things that makes me feel like he doubts how much I love him.  Last night when I was going out to the bars with Lauryl for her 21st Birthday he said ""remember to think about me"" and he said it really quietly.  I don't know what he meant by that but all I said was ""i think about you all of the time, i hope that you know that.""  After I thought about it though I think what he meant by that was ""don't get completely wasted, hit on some guy, go back to his apartment with him, and cheat on me.""  If that is what he meant by that then fuck that, becuase I hope that he knows that even if we weren't dating that I am better than that.  i have never done that in my life and i never will.  and since we are dating i hope that he knows that i love him enough to never do that to him, becuase i expect him to never do that to me.  speaking of which, he's a million times more likely to do that to me considering his past.

so basically that was just a little rant about me being pissed, but at the same time, that sort of hurt my feelings and my dignity.  i guess that maybe i'll talk to him about it, becuase i don't need little comments like that in my life.

but i still love him.



other than that, lauryl was trashed last night, that was fun to see ands he had a good time, but today isn't such a good time for her.  hahahah....oh, my sister, i'd do anything for her."

it's everything to me
and he's everything that I am.
Unfortunate when he's gone,
like a long winter that's an eternity
brewing to take away the freshly appeared colors of spring.
Once more the bitterness and cold seeps in,
fading the life once born.
Joyful and happy,
but mostly in love.
Shy smiles that say it all.
Crowns of white flowers.
Revert back to happiness
in a seemingly endless circle.
Achieving solidarity
in a time and space of one.
The feelings never forgotten
once preserved and savored
until replenished.
Fully emersed in none other than hope,
a single friend in a life lived like so.
Waiting is my patience
relieved only by sight, touch, and reality.
A breath of the future,
a sigh of dreams comes to be known.
All to find the fate that I walk upon
and all to be lived as what I know as
a fulfilled life."

I think that the world should make an international rule where if you play Solitaire on somebody's computer and say you like to do 3-card draw but they like 1-card draw and you switch the options so that it's 3-card draw, when you are done you should switch it back to their original preference.  

Because really, there's nothing more devastating than starting a Solitaire game and it's going real good and you're working off of the cards that are already on the screen and then you go to flip a card from the pile and 3 cards flip over, because then you have no choice but to redeal in 1-card draw mode.

Come on people! Let's band together and get this done!  haha...ohhhhh i'm a loser."

We had a good time all together, for some reason because we're not together we easily get tension between the two of us.  We don't fight or anything, we just have periods of when we just get sort of sick of each other but not really...we still want to be around each other.

He gave me a gift card to hollister, burned me the Alicia Keys song ""If I Ain't Got You"" and he painted this incredibly amazing and beautiful picture of a rose and put the lyrics on it.  That present meant more to me than anything else in the world.  He really is just so talented.  The picture is pretty big too, It's nice to have to look at while we're away from one another.

Today we went to the water slide...that was pretty fun.  I hadn't been there in FOREVER but we were dying to go.  We just sort of swam around for a while and went down the slide a couple of times and then layed and dried off in the sun.

This year my birthday sucks a lot, I can tell it's going to.  I mean not that I am exceptionally looking forward to it or anything, but it's just that I have school all day, two quizzes to take, and then homework to do all evening.  It's not even going to feel like my birthday.  My mom is making me a cheesecake, I love her so much.  She helped Brad and I make cinnamon rolls from scratch this morning.  

I miss Brad already, this goodbye was easier than normal though becuase we knowt hat sooner than later we will be back at school togehter.....I can't wait...sigh.

I feel sort of lost here in Urbana, it's nice to be back and I'm always thankful that I have a place like this to come home to, but I need to be back with my Purduians.

Brad and I decided  that for my birthday we are going to go to Cedar Point instead of driving out to Colorado becuase time is of the essence.  That will be fun though, he's never really been on a big rollercoaster.


I fall more and more everyday and I know that there's no safety net at the bottom, but that doesn't stop me from taking that step off of the edge....it's worth it.


Oh, and I wanted to put this here so that I would remember.  While we were sitting in some grass I made a little flower chain but it was so small that I tied it into a ring and put it on this finger but it wouldn't fit, and he took it off and slid it on my finger and I think that both of us had fluttery hearts at that moment."

(1.)  My birthday is on Monday, and along wtih it being my birthday it is also my sister melissa's birthday, and the next day is lauryl and my mom's birthday, so needless to say I share my birthday with a lot of folks.  But my mom has ALways ALWAYS made each of us feel special on our birthdays.  There was a note on our whiteboard today that said ""Girlies, what kind of cake do you want for your birthdays?! ;)"" so lauryl and i were deciding on one and she was like ""you guys know you both get your own cakes...right?!""  

I LOVE MY MOTHER!

(2.)  My father rocks my face off becuase he stayed up wtih me until 1:30am doing computer science homewrok wtih me.  Whenever we would figure out a code he'd say ""all right!"" and give me a high-five!  He worked with me for like...5 hours straight.  He's just so determined to make sure that I understand things.  I wish I could take him back to school with me so that he could explain my homework to me, and so i could ahve my dad!

Me, Erinn, and Ruthie all got smoked up by Brad and SERIOUSLY, we were insanely messed up, but I was still concious, it was just the messed up where you talk about a lot of really deep stuff.  So me, Erinn, and Ruthie were sitting on Ruthie's bed and I realized that Brad still hadn't come out from the room next door where we had smoked.  So I walked into the room and he was sitting on the floor looking out the window with a candle lit infront of him that was lighting the room for us earlier.

We had put some James Taylor on earlier because we were all feeling it.

I sat down next to Brad and just rested my head on his shoulder, and he put his hand on my chin and lifted my head up to look at him, and he kissed me.  But not only was that just the greatest moment ever, right at the moment that he kissed me ""You've Got a Friend"" came on.

Every single possible lightbulb went on in my head and at that moment a rush and a wave hit me that told me that I really really do love this boy with all of my heart and I will continue to love him until my last breath...he really is my other half.

That moment is something that I will take with me forever, a moment that nobody else can imagine or remember, just a moment that I can replay in my mind over and over again so vividly.

Today I was talking to him on the phone and he said that he was going to this festival thing that he described as a carnival, so jokingly I just said ""ok, have fun!  win me a goldfish!""  because the first carnival game that I thought of was where you through the pingpongs into the water that has goldfish in them to win them.  So then later that night I get a call from Brad and I just answered and said ""Hello?""  and he goes ""I won you two goldfish!....and now I'm about to go and buy a tarantula!""

That boy always keeps me on my toes, and I love every minute of those balancing acts.

I swear, this will never get old.


Plus, I love that he takes something that I'm kidding about and really does it, because he just knows without knowing that when I say stuff and I'm just kidding that at times I really have this whole scenario about it all acted out in my head....and since he listens to me, REALLY listens to me he really does them because he realizes how much it would actually mean to me.

I think that's what keeps us together and so happy with one another, that we are always on our toes with each other in our moments of spontanaeity, we have selfless love where the whole time we aren't worried about what will make ourselves happy....we are worried about what will make the other one happy and doing anything to achieve that, and the fact that we really just listen to each other because we want to...not because we have to try hard to do it.  

That's three big things out of the thousands and millions of little things that really make us who we are and happy with us.

I love that boy, I really do!

"event","I surprisingly took this Monday pretty well compared to the other ones.  Usually it's the night that kills me, but it was the day this time that was bad.  All during classes I just felt like bursting into tears, I think that it was a whole big mess of things though.  I just felt so overwhelmed, overworked, and overachieving, and it's hard not to have somebody here to support me during that.  I got mad during Chemistry, I don't know why, I was just so pissed that I couldn't figure out the problem and every time that I tried to take a new direction with it it still ended up in a dead end and made me even more mad.

I need to study a lot.  I feel like I just go to school, come home and study and do homework and then go to sleep, but it takes a while for me to fall asleep because in my head I'm thinking ""i'm not done studying, i'm never done studying.""

I was talking to Brad on the phone last night and we had a really good conversation.  We both started talking about how we would love to graduate college and do something like the peacecorps or something.  I think that you can work for the rest of your life, but you really only get the opportunity to try something like the peace corps for a short amount of time.  I figure that after graduating from school (which i know is a lLOOOONnnnggGGGGGGGGg way off) that will be the time where I don't have much direction and can take the time off from working to do that.  I don't know, tha'ts going to take a lot of thought, we'll see how somehting like studying abroad goes first before trying something like that.

I am acutally understanding the computer science and other things lately, that's making me feel smart.  I think that it's just mostly that I am trying more than I have in the past couple of years, so I'm learning it all so much better.

I miss my friends a lot, bt I was talking to Abby the other day inbetween classes how we dont' really feel like this is home anymore.  I feel like I come back here to just sit and I want to be anywhere but here.  I'm thinking that it would be nice to get an internship in a different city for the next summer, and then it would be fun to visit all of my friends and such.  I feel bad that I havne't seen them in a looong looong time.  When I do see them I don't think that they understand how tired and exhausted I am and how nice it feels to just SIT THERE and do nothing.  I don't want to get dressed up and go out partying, I don't want to get fucked up, I just want to sit there and be with them and talk and hang out...just feel relaxed for once.  I mean and then when they all go out and I say i'm going to go home I feel like they think that I don't want to hang out with them, which isn't the case at all, it's just that I think our summers are SO COMPLETELY different right now that they can't really see my point of view on things.  I mean my full time job is being a student right now and that doesn't stop when I get home, it just continues.  I mean I did the work thing last summer and I am by far much more exhausted now then I was last summer.  I hope that eventually though I can catch up in all of the classes and stuff and I will have time to see them and hang out.

Wow, Steve Meadows just walked into the computer lab here and I haven't seen him in FOREVER, he looks so different.  He's a mentor in the peer tutoring center, which I think is really good of him.  It's funny to run into a whole bunch of people who I graduated with and it's funny to see how everybody has changed and how surprised they are to see how much I have changed.  I think it's great, so many people are growing up and no matter how people felt about one another in high school, those feelings don't exist anymore, nobody CARES anymore, when somebody says 'hi, how are you?' they actually mean it.  High school was way too petty, not once during this entire year have i looked back and though...""man i wish i was still in high school, i miss that place""

This past weekend I went to Indy again for the F-1 race.  I really really enjoy races, I think that it's something that I want to go to for the rest of my life, the crowd is so different and it gets your adrenaline pumping, I regret any bad thing that I ever said about racing.  I got SOOOOOOOOOo sun burnt though, my nose is blistery and my shoulders are just completely red and it hurts like a mofo when I put my backpack on.

I'm hoping that this weekend is open for me, I haven't seen Jake and Jordan in FOREVER and that needs to change.  So if either of you reads this, I want you to know that I ma going to get that homework done so that we can hang out!!!
Well, this was longer than I expected and I should probably go and work on my chemistry since I have a lot of work to do tonight.....but I guess that it's good that I am finally caught up in all of this."

"event","I feel so needy right now, and that feeling makes me feel like a greedy little bitch...but hopefully I'm far from that.

I just feel like I need somebody to be with me at all times telling me that I'm a great person and that I'm going to do ok and that everything will be all right.  I feel myself getting mad at Brad lately just because he's not here to help me with all of that, and then that makes me feel selfish and like one of those jealous girlfriends that tries to control their boyfriends...I don't think that it's really like that, maybe this is just a phase.

I haven't said anything to Brad about it, mostly just because I'm hoping that it will pass and I know that when we see each other again it will be ok.

I just get sort of upset about the smallest things, like how yesterday I called him three times and he didn't call me back until about 12 at night and he told me he had gotten the messages earlier in the day.  If he left me a message I would call him back ASAP.  I guess that sometimes I get sort of paranoid with him, I mean he hangs out with all of his old high school friends and he tells me that sometimes he runs across his old girlfriends and stuff and I know that he's not interested in them but I'm just scared that maybe old feelings will come back.

I don't know, I don't want to control his life and I don't wnat to be protective and paranoid, those thoughts shouldn't take over our relationship, but when we're away from each other I can't help but feel selfish and want him for only myself.

I don't know, maybe things will be looking up by tomorrow.

OH, which reminds me, I'm going to Indianapolis tomorrow to go to the race, and he doesn' thave to work at ALL tomorrow, so I didn't really understand why he didn't ask me to go there tonight...which isn't a big deal, but he didn't even mention.  That makes me wonder about two things, a.) maybe he doesn't want me there tonight (which could just be me being paranoid) or b.) maybe his mom didn't want me there.

I don't know what to think about a lot of things right now."

"event","Well tonight it happened, it hasn't even been 4 days and I already broke down and freaked out to Brad about how my life is going right now.  I am always so amazed at how irrational I get at times like those, and then an hour after it happens I just look back at it and think that everything that I said was ridiculous...I think that I get too caught up in the moment.

But it was nice that even though Brad is an hour and a half away that he can still console me and help me to realize that it will all be alright, it's just going to take some time and some hard work.  He was the only thing that kept me sane at school.  I guess that sometimes I get kind of confused by him though because he never freaks out, and I mean NEVER, he could be about to fall off a cliff and he would just ""ahh...it'll be ok!""  I'm so amazed/perplexed by that boy...but I love him all the same.


So it's 7 more weeks, 7 more weeks of hell, 7 more weeks of waiting, and 7 more weeks of doing what I hate most for 24 hours a day, but that's alright, because in the grand scheme of things 7 weeks is NOT the rest of my life and I am strong and I can make it through this.

Plus, then I won't have to take these classes later...so with all the negative there is always good...(i need to remember that more often)."

well, it's just an abrupt change from sitting on my ass everyday to being awake every second of the day and feeling stressed out.

i wake up around 7:30 and plan on going running but usually hit snooze, and wake up around 8:00.

i then get ready and drink some coffee to keep me going for the day and i head on out for parkland.  my class starts at 10:00 and i get there around 9:00 and i sit and work on homework and get help on things that i don't understand (which is a lot).

then i head off to my calc 2 class at 10:00 which lasts until 11:50.  then i meet everyone and their mom from high school in the hallway on my way to the peer tutoring center to work on some more homework until my next class at 1:00pm.

I go to my chemistry class at 1:00 and on Monday and Wednesday that class lasts until 3:50pm (hell).  on Tuesday and Thursday that class lasts until 4:50pm (even more hell) because of our lab.

Then I drive home and as soon as I get home I grab a little grub and crack open the books again.  I have to get on the computer and do my online CSC class.  So basically I work on homework until 10:30 or 11:00 which is when I go to bed so that i'm nice and refreshed for the next day (except not really) so that I can start all over again.

It has only been two days and already I'm feeling the stress of it.  This is going to be so tought but I know that it will be more than worth it if I get all of the credits and don't have to take them next semester.

Keep me in your thoughts so that I do good! ;)"

tomorrow classes start, i want to get the freaking chemistry class out of the way, but at the same time i have come to the conclusion that i HATE chemistry, i mean i dispise it!!!!!


This weekend I went to go and see Brad.  So far this summer we have seen each other more than we thought we would.  I would say at least once a week...it's definitely worth the drive to Indy.  This weekend was fun, yesterday we went and walked around in the mall and then Brad took me to the canals where he likes to go and sit and write.  They were so nice, it was just so relaxing.  We sat on this stone ledge and just talked for a couple of hours until it started to get a little cold.  For dinner we went to this expensive Italian restaurant, and I always feel bad having him spend money on me and I try to get him to save his money, but at the same time he just makes me smile with how much he wants to buy everything for me.  I wonder if he knows that i don't need anything material from him, I just need him...I think that he does know that, or at least I hope that he does.

Today we went to his cousins birthday family that was with his family and i got to see his grandma and grandpa and they are EXACTLY what Brad and I would be like.  They always make me feel so welcome and I'm so thankful for that.  That was the second time that I had ever seen them and they both gave me hugs goodbye.  It's nice to have figures like that now, since I never have.  They are just the cutest ever, they are still so much in love nad their love is so...fresh, like it just began yesterday.  It's nice to see that relationships do work out nowadays.


Now the aftermath begins, where i go into deep depression after seeing brad.  the day after is the hardest.  i hope that school starts to make the days feel like they are going by faster so that soon i'll be back at school.  i can't wait.

""But never have I been a blue calm sea, I have always been a storm.""

I feel a great lack of motivation.  Well, I don't just feel it I know that it's there.  I could count on one hand the number of times that I get my ass off of the couch in a day...one hand...that's pitiful.  It's not that I don't have anything to do either, I have plenty to do.  I have a book to finish, CS to read, Physics to read, Newell Instruments research to do...I just don't feel like doing any of it.  Instead I watch TV, nap, learn the occasional guitar note, and then nap again.  I think that it's becuase all day long my thoughts are filled of Brad, I feel so....captivated by him...I can't think of anything else but him.  When he's here I feel motivated, I'll cook, I'll clean, I'll actually get off of my ass and do stuff but when he's gone all I think about is him.  I think that I am sleeping so much because that's the only way to stop thinking about it.

I'm a lazy lazy beast.

I haven't hung out with my friends much either, but it's not that I'm choosing to do something other than hang out with them, I just don't feel like being social.  I feel like staying up late watching Conan and reading and listening to music.  I don't feel like getting dressed to look presentable to then be judged.  This summer hasn't become all it's been cracked out to be.

I know that I sound really depressed and all, I think that I'm just ready to go, what else is left here anyways?

Maybe I am a little sad....but I know that I am also happy, so what does that actually make me?

This weekend was so great.  I drove over to Speedway on Saturday and got there around 4:30 and of course I took a wrong turn and got lost.  Brad had to work all day even though he was supposed to get off early, so when he was giving me directions he sounded a little pissed off, which I can understand.  We just sort of hung out for a while in his house.  Brad drove me down by the racetrack so that we could see all of the people.  It was absolutely insane how many people had gone, people brought their campers and tents and they were jnust alongside the road sitting in chairs yelling at the traffic and trying to get girls to flash them for beads, it was hilarious and made me realize that it was going to be one big hick convention for th eweekend.  We went to one of his parents friend's bbq and just sat there and chilled for a while, it was pretty fun.  

Brad had planned on us going to his friend's graduation party where his parents had bought them THREE KEGS, it's so weird how different parenting is from town to town, all of the parents know what kids drink or do drugs, but they don't really care that much as long as they are safe wtih them...it was weird.  So all of the Speedway girls are bleached blonde, really tan, and look like they have had botox injected in them and they dress all in abercrombie or name brad stuff.  So they look perfect and put togheter in their white shorts or short short skirts while I walk in wearing my pink wife beater, jeans, and my birks, and i wa silke ""fuck it, i'm comfortable and i don't look like every other one of those hoebags"".  So for the most part these girls just want NOTHING to do with an ""outsider"" so they are all busy giving dirty looks and not saying hi or being friendly or anythign, which doesn't bother me so Brad and I just hang out.  Two of the girls were actually nice and said hi and talked to me, so I appreciated that.  one of the nice girls told brad that this girl named rachel was real shitty about me and him being there togehter becuase she and brad had a past together and apparently the bitch wasn't over it...but i knew all about ita nd brad told me everything and i figured it out too, so it wasn't a big deal, but when we walked out one of her bitchy friends yelled ""BYE BRAD"" and brad just waved his arm and kept walking and didn't look at them and then rachel yelled ""dont' cheat on your girlfriend with me again!""

at that point i wanted to whip around and have a few words with her.  it made me SO MAD, she doesn't know me at all and so I dont' know why she feels that she has to try to bring up some high school bullshit which brad and i don't want to be involved in.  obviously seh's the salty one in the situation since she was the sloppy seconds and then i ended up with brad in the end.  plus...brad and i weren't even dating when they had their little fling, so that blonde haired bimbo can shut her fucking face before i shut it for her.

ok, that wa sa little rage, but brad loved it that i was so worked up about it...which i guess was funny but i told him that i loathed that girl and i will hate her for the rest of my life.  i was like ""at first i hated all of the girls and then i was like no i don't really becuase i'm sure that  they are nice but look bitchy, but this one i actually do hate.""  she's going to purdue too...yah.  We just went back to his house and mde a firea nd ate marshmellows, so it was really fun.

SOrry i'm going second by second, but i want to remember this weekend forever becuase i had a really great time.

So then on Sunday we actually got to go to the race...whcih was incredible.  I haven't witnessed something that cool in a long time.  Morgan Freeman was in the pace car, Jessica Simpson sang hte anthem, and Nick Lachey waved the green flag.  We were in the grass by the fourth turn and everytime thos ecars whooshed around my insides would just vibrate and i Loved the noise and the atmosphere, it was so exhilarating, i would love to go again.

Basically the rest of the weekend we just hung out.  TOday we walked all around downtown adn talked about how much we are going to miss each othe rnad how next summer i'll have to get an internship in indy so we can be together becuase this just isn't bearable.

So all in all it was a great weekend and i have some ideas for his birthday...the shen chou poster and pulp fiction on DVD...don't forget those...AND, i wonder what he's getting me for my birthday, i'm glad mine comes first so i know the money range and what i have tolive up to.

A quick recap...

Brad came into town last Saturday and we sort of just lounged around and he met my friends.  That night we went to Toshi's and that was fun, Brad just has a way of sinking right in and being a part of anybody's group...he's versatile in that way...hahahaha...versatile.

Anyways...so that made me happy that he really gets along with my friends and he thinks that they are all really cool and they think the same about him.  I have only heard good things about him so far, so that's a plus that I really really like him and so do my friends!

Then on Saturday I had my girls over and we barbecued with Brad, I was the chef for the night...hope I didn't get anyone sick.  I loved being at the grill and just having Brad come up behind me and grab my hips and ask if I needed any help.  He's so fun, he's just so goofy with me and I love it, he's not afraid to play.  He helped me make a cake and he helped my cut up some fruit for my fruit salad.  I made him try green pepper for the first time and sourdough.  I love that he trusts me enough to try something new, it's always something else to look forward to.

So on Monday morning we left for Minnesota for our fishing trip, it was really fun.  Brad and I hiked aroudn on the bank of the river in the woods casting out lines out and sneaking a kiss everyonce in a while.  It was so relaxing.  We just got back yesterday evening.  It was me, Brad, my dad, Ben, Annie, Melissa and Carlos...and once again Brad fit right in.  One thing that I love about him is he's so polite, always up to help with the dishes or to cook or to do something for everyone, he really is the nicest guy that I have ever met.  We got back yesterday and we went and saw Troy and it was nice to be back and jut cuddle onthe couch and talk about weird and random things together.

He left today, and as I had my arms wrapped tight around his neck to let him know that I didn't want him to go, I almost cried....it was that close.  To the point where I just had to stick a smile on my face and let it shine just so that he would feel better about leaving.  I stayed outside until I couldn't see him anymore and blew him a kiss and waved goodbye, and then I went inside and just laid on the couch, and I thought to myself ""now what am I going to do?""  We had a true test with our relationship during this past week.  We were not seperated for a whole entire week, yet we still coudlnt' get enough of each other...and that let me know that this is true and selfless love.

I showed him around Urbana and he was interested to see where I lived and who my family is and who I hang out with...and it made me smile that he cares.  I don't think that I could ever love anybody as much as I love him...ever.  He just plopped into my lap and it's the greatest gift that I could have ever asked for, to love somebody and know that he loves me back jut as much. 


And a plus, my family loves him, my friends love him, and I love him...I couldn't ask for a better life right now (well, I'm sure that I could but no matter what happens in my life Brad always makes it better.)"

"event","I have one word for you, and even that doesn't sum up how I felt about the concert...that one word is just ""wow"".  I was sitting there waiting for the lights to dim, and it just hadn't really hit me yet, that in just a few short seconds four members of what I consider to be the greatest band ever were going to be playing instruments and singing on the stage infront of me.  In person, not on a screen, not on a CD, just right there, as if they were singing the songs for me.

They came out and you could see Stevie's long flowy dress breezing around as she walked up to the microphone, and the drums started, and the guitars started, and Stevie opened her mouth and let out the first few words to ""The Chain"" and I couldn't contain myself, I just started to cry...and I don't even know what the tears were for, it was the only way for me to express how I felt about being there...sitting there infront of somebody that I idol so much and I don't even know.  I was just so happy that I got to see them, and for a few split seconds I felt like my life was fulfilled.  And I just kept on crying throughout the song, and I couldn't help it, I couldn't stop, and I couldn't explain it, and I know that I will never feel that feeling inside of me again.

Goodness, just the concert was so...amazing...I was blown away and so honored to be able to say that I saw Fleetwood Mac play.  I will never forget last night, not in a million years.  If that's the only thing that I could remember for the rest of my life then I would take it.  Gosh, I felt so free and I felt like even though thousands of other people had gone to see them, that I was the only one there and the concert was just for me.  I could feel the music going through me and the words touching my soul.  That's what I love about their music, they wrote these songs because of things going on in their lives, but at the same time I am able to take the words that meant something to them and have it mean something else to me...and it means so much.  It helps me think through my anger, or bast in love, or laugh at my silly life, or helps me to remember that tomorrow will come and no matter what everything is going to be ok, that destiny will have it's way and I will eventually come into the life that I am meant to have.

Courtney asked me to call her during Landslide, she didn't answer the phone so I let the music play on her voicemail for a little while, but I knew right when John McVie and Mick Fleetwood left the stage that they were going to play the song.  From the first note that Lindsay played on his guitar I knew that it would be Landslide.  It all started with that song for me.  That song applies to so many different things in my life, I take it as my own.  I take it as something that explains so much to me, but at the same time I am still left puzzled and wanting more answers....while that seems frusterating I think that it's good, it leaves me wanting to find the rest of the answers, it leaves me wanting to live the rest of my life.  I just sat there and rocked to the guitar chords and mouthed the words with my eyes shut while tears started to flow again.  When I listen to that song I feel like everything is alright.



I really really miss Brad, I can't stand this....well, I mean I can stand it because I love him incredible amounts so I will stand it because I will do anything to be with him.  It just sucks just having the occasional phone conversation or the occasional IM conversation.  I just want to be with him.  I think that we are both pretty bored and miserable without eachother...which makes me sad but at the same time happy because I know that the feeling is mutual and real.  I get to see him on Friday though, I'm driving over to Speedway and then spending the night.  Then on Saturday we'll drive up here and then on Monday morning we're leaving to go fishing in Minnesota!  It's going to be fun, I'm glad that he'll get to meet my friends, see my town, and spend time with my family.  I gotta clean the house so it looks nice and spiffy for when he comes!

AHHhhhh.....counting down the days!"

This is the hardest, and I mean the HARDEST thing that I have ever had to do.  It's so hard to be away from him when, especially when you're so used to just being with him 24/7, and cuddling up next to him at night, and just having him there to smile with and laugh with and do goofy things with and just hang out with and to have somebody to hold you whenever you want...it's hard...so so hard, and it's telling me that this is real, this is it, this is true love.

AHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...all day I've been doing things to keep my mind of him...even though I don't want to not think about him, but it's hard when it's on your mind all of the time.  It's more that I want to hang out with him and I can't because I know that it's just not possible right now, that's what the worst thing about it is.  I went and got job applications, set up my computer and stereo, I'm trying to put my room together at least a little bit...it'll take a while though becuase I have so much random junk around me here.

But yes, I am very bored already and want to be back at school.  I already miss Megan and Sarah a ton, I never realized how weird it is to see people everyday for a looong time, and then already I'm feeling the effects of not seeing them.

strange, berry strange, i guess that i have adapted to college life a lot more than i was thinking.

Really I just need to kick the living crap out of my math and econ final, and I should be ok...but you know, I'm just a little girl, so we can see how much I can kick the crap out of something.

Umm...I just cleaned my reoom up so much, I have one card from my mom up on my bulletin board, some books, and my clothes.  We won't mention all of the boxes that are under my bed though.  But moving out is going to suck...I can't believe that I'm almost done with my first year of college!  CRAZY!


Yeah, I don't feel like updating but I have a lot to say so maybe I'll do it later.

but what's done is done and i can live without knowing or caring, easily done.




This weekend was really great.  Toshi and Matt came down on Friday to pick me up to go up to Chicago.  We decided to stay for a while and go to a party at Brad and Aiyman's frat, and it was with three other frats.  A lot of people went, Grand Prix week is just incredibly insane.  I would guess that 80% of the campus is drunk at all times during this week...SO funny.  A couple of things happened at the party, and that was crazy, but it was really fun...I had a good time.  I didn't drink because I was DDing up to Chitown, but it was still fun.

I had my hand on Brad's knee at one point when he was working security, and some dick faced guy who lives out of house that nobody likes came and yelled in a drunken rage.  We're going to drain him like the pig he is....hahaha.

We got up to Chicago and I got to meet all of Toshi's brothers and friends, it was really fun.  They are all so much fun, I had a blast talking to them all...they are all so interesting.  It's just so crazy to imagine a school in the middle of a big city like that, it's so different from Purdue.  I really want to work in Chicago after I graduate, that or Boston, it would be so fun.

On Saturday we got ready and all dressed up and primped nicely and drove to the suburb to the hotel.  There was an open bar and a really good dinner.  We danced and talked and mingled and it was so much fun.

After the formal we all went into one of the suites and just sat around and drank some beer ate 60 White Castle sliders and talked about some weird stuff...like measuring 7 inches out from the face when you slap someone.  Haha, that kid was funny, we had fun arguing about that and the angle degree.

We got kicked out of the room for being too loud, the security guard had to come to our door a couple of times.  It was fun to get all dressed up and everything, it had been a while.

That whole time I couldn't stop thinking about Brad, I had to call him and it felt like we had been away from each other for a loooooooong time.  When I finally got back it was so nice to just run up to him and have him wrap his arms around me.  Really, I am starting to realize how hard this summer is going to be.  He might be coming fishing with my family up to Minnesota, but my dad is still checking the boat situation, I hope he can, I don't think he's ever done anything like that, and I want him to meet my family.


Good weekend, good weekend."

It seems like there is always an excuse for me not to get an oil change. Two days ago, I went at 7:30am, except the place didn't open until 8. I didn't want to wait around. Yesterday, there was a giant Valvoline truck blocking the entrance. I didn't want to wait around. Today, there was bumper to bumper traffic heading south. I didn't want to wait around. Tomorrow I go to Tallahassee for a few weeks. Hope the car survives. 

Is there anything more horrifying than the ending to Looking for Mr. Goodbar??? (<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076327/"">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076327/</a>). I know the movie/book is seen as a cautionary tale (based on a true story), but why don't we focus on all the psychotic male characters in the movie and analyze our society from that angle? I mean she was surrounded by abusive male figures. Instead of wanting to correct her behavior, why don't we feel the need to correct theirs?

There are two fruit flies zooming around my apartment (and my face as I try to type this). I can't get rid of them and I'm certain they are going to lay eggs somewhere (so so gross, I know). I hate insects. And all the tips on this website make me feel icky as well: <a href=""http://www.wikihow.com/Get-Rid-of-Fruit-Flies"">How to Get Rid of Fruit Flies</a>, especially the magnified head shot of a fruit fly. Why would I ever need to see that? It will haunt my dreams forever."

I got my mom a Mother's Day card at the grocery store. And they didn't have a very good selection either. I'm kind of a terrible daughter. My main criteria was: 1. no flowery fonts or anything resembling cursive because my mom has a hard time reading English, 2. no excessive amounts of glitter (and let me tell you, these card people use TONS of glitter), 3.  nothing too long (for the same reason as #1), 4. nothing stamped with a bible verse, and 5. nothing huge, unwieldy or with a pop-up or musical element. I finally found one for under three bucks."

1. Eat in bed. Especially Doritos. Especially Late Night flavored Doritos. That's just sad.
2. Mindless internet surfing. Like Facebook. I honestly have no reason to have a facebook. The only good it's done me is to confirm my suspicions that attending my cousin's wedding reception would be the lamest thing ever. Thanks Facebook for those damning photographs of half-drunk relatives in a conga line.  
3. Wait to pay bills. I linger in case some rich anonymous donor figures out I'm awesome and chooses to endow me.
4. Save the dirty dishes for another day. I've become really bad about/good at this. Maybe because it is something I would never have gotten away with as a child. I grew up with an obsessive-compulsive mother. She would actually dump out our toys after we'd cleaned our room if everything wasn't perfectly put away. She's gotten a lot better, but I dread visiting her for a long period of time. The longer I stay, the more likely she'll have a crazy moment. 
5. Buy random shit from the grocery store, Amazon, or Target. And this includes food. Like Late Night Doritos I end up eating in bed.

Neither had I. Apparently, Orlando has two international airports, with the Sanford one technically being in Sanford, Florida about twenty miles northeast of downtown. And apparently, you can catch direct flights to Reykjavik. Good to know. We drove through the back roads from Gainesville. It was really lovely. I really liked Mount Dora--very hilly with beautiful canopy roads. I've got a framed Mount Dora Art Festival poster from 1986 on my wall, but I'd never actually been there (found the poster at Goodwill in Delray for like 2 bucks; it reminded me of Bob Masse's work). Now I'm going to plan some summer day trips to the little towns in that area (I love Winter Park and Eatonville, home of Zora Neale Hurston). I took the turnpike on the way back, and while passing Silver Springs, there were a dozen zebra grazing in a field with cows. Totally surreal."

I'm still confused about what's going to happen in terms of that second absence, but I think things have worked themselves out. I did meet with my professor and she was somewhat understanding about it.

So, it's about four weeks until the end of the semester. Summer used to be a lovely, airy time of complete slack between spring and fall semesters. I remember spending an entire summer between my freshman and sophomore years in Indiana with my Korean side of the family and not worrying about much. Now summer signifies a complete loss of income and a strange transitory period where I feel like I need to get major shit done. So, I'm not looking forward to these next four weeks going by. 

But here is a small list of strange and random things that keep me momentarily happy:

almond pillow cookies (so good)
late 80s, early 90s Johnny Depp (think 21 Jumpstreet; so hot)
bad TV like America's Next Top Model (aka All About Tyra) and Toddlers and Tiaras (super scary)
strawberry season (three cartons for five bucks at your local supermarket)
rainstorms (to wash the pollen away)
and reading about cleaning tips in the April issue of Real Simple instead of actually cleaning

I hate being sick. (Although, sometimes, I kind of like that weird fuzzy feeling--you know, when you are slightly feverish and your skin feels inside-out and you take NyQuil and feel a little buzzed.) I'm going to make matzo ball soup. Maybe. Except all I really do is sit up for about five minutes, grade one page of a student paper, and then collapse onto my bed and go back to sleep. It's pathetic, but I really want my mom. She makes this stuff out of rice called juk (or, I guess, congee), and it's oddly soothing. And I kind of want her, so I can hear her talk about seemingly inconsequential things, like how strawberries are on sale at Winn-Dixie and how she thinks the woman across the street should put her poodle on a leash. 

I'm just about finished with Dead Until Dark (trash read #1). I really like it. I like the main characters and their romantic tension. And the violence. And the mystery. There hasn't been much Eric yet (Erin :) but I'm looking forward to seeing more of him. I've already got the second one lined up even though I should probably be working on my HD seminar paper. I'm going to give it to my sister Erica for her birthday and make her read it even though she usually has about ten novels lined up for herself. 

Speaking of birthdays, the 25th is Kira's. But I don't think we're really friends anymore. This will mark the first time in almost 12 years that I won't be wishing her a Happy Birthday directly. That makes me really sad, but I'm not really sure how to deal with it right now. I honestly hope she is well and has a great birthday, even though I know I have no right to force my good wishes on her because she probably hates me (and maybe this is the NyQuil speaking?). 

I need to find a frickin' job. Or line up a summer project for myself, so that I can get some funding. But I do nothing but sleep.

"event","Happy early Valentine's Day! I'll be spending mine keeping my nose clean. Literally. I've been having terrible allergies for about a week which resulted in a sinus infection and slight fever Tuesday. I felt much better Thursday, but  last night developed this weird, annoying tickle in my throat. Kind of like when you choke on a blue corn chip and it feels like a sharp corner is stuck behind your uvula. Well, at least that's what I was doing shortly before I felt the annoying tickle come one. And now I find myself coughing excessively. Have I relapsed? Hope not.

On a sort of connected thought: uvula: sounds like a sexual organ, but so isn't! Well...it kind of has something to do with sex...

...which leads me back to V-day. Great day for two things: excessive chocolate eating and a Lifetime movie marathon. And sex if you happen to have a warm body. Or an electronic device. I'm going to go for the chocolate though.

This weekend is my designate find-a-job Saturday. I will be updating my skimpy resume and CV and sending out apps. I need to also ask some people for letters of recommendation, which is the equivalent of having my wisdom teeth pulled. I absolutely hate asking professors and such for this. But I will need something lined up for this summer because I don't know if Kenneth or someone else will be available for an independent study, and I doubt I'll get teaching. 

I'm going to officially be observed Tuesday. I'm SO nervous. I met with my observer and he turned out to be really nice and easygoing. But still... I'm just afraid of looking stupid. Or saying something completely dumb. Or coming across as unprofessional and unqualified. But somehow, I'll survive. 

In other news, I've been watching all this coverage on the devastating Continental plane crash. Really sad :( 

It makes me really anxious. I think I'll turn it off and finish my ""trash reading""* selection of the month, Dead Until Dark by Charlaine Harris (the series HBO's True Blood is based on). Review to follow.

*I label this trash reading, not because I think the books are necessarily bad, but because they are usually entertainment or genre fiction of some kind, which can usually be bought cheaply in paperback form at local discount stores or supermarkets and are culturally seen as separate from actual literature or high art. I am also making the personal distinction between books I am reading for fun and books I am reading academically. I like ""trashy"" novels and probably spend more time curled in bed with them than I do anything else. And I do think there is a very fine line between ""trash"" fiction and good, high art literature (inside or outside of the canon) in regards to a number of titles, including the entire genre known as young adult or even Children's literature in general (hence the often disparaging label ""kiddie lit"")."

"event","I'll start with some good news first: Tales from the Darkside is finally coming to DVD. Instead of watching the same episodes on the Scifi channel at 5am, I can actually freak out to the world's creepiest theme song any time I want. So that's a plus.

Bad news: crazy fires in Australia and koalas with burnt paws! http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/02/10/ap/world/main4788808.shtml

Other bad news (not that this even compares to the fact that nearly 200 people have died in Australia and poor Koalas need to be rescued): I'm being observed at some point (possibly Thursday) by the UWP. It's a routine observation, but I've never actually had one before. I'm super nervous. I meet with my advisor tomorrow. I think he's a grad student, but I'm not sure. The truth is, I feel like I'm a terrible teacher who doesn't really challenge my students enough. I look at other syllabi and reading schedules developed by other TAs and, well, their classes seem so much better. It's almost like I don't even have the energy to put more effort into it. Although I have been observed by my teaching mentor and by another grad student when I taught Poetry for the English Department, it feels so much more nerve-wracking coming from the UWP. Oh well. It's a necessary evil.

Other things that suck: students not coming to class and then emailing me apologies. Okay, I do this too when I miss a seminar, but when you email an instructor to tell her that you missed her class because you slept in, well, that just feels like a slap in the face. I don't care why you missed class; in fact, I wish I could of slept in too--but I didn't. And I feel like these apologies just serve to assuage the guilt of the writer and do nothing for me but clutter my inbox. Okay. I'm just in a bad mood because I have a slight fever and have been hacking up a lung for the past few days. I, too, have missed class due to a faulty alarm clock. But I had the sense not to mention this lame reason. 

I've been watching a lot of Boys Before Flowers--this new Korean drama based on the manga and anime Hana Yori Dango. I'm going to post a longer review of it later (AKA my personal opinions on why I think it kind of sucks and is kind of awesome all at the same time). I'm trying to figure out how I can take all this excessive TV/internet watching and work it into some research.

In my next entry, I will spend time griping about the Korean movie 200 lbs. of Beauty. I guess this means that I should actually finish watching it, which I find hard to do because it annoys me on some many levels. I will say this though: I ABSOLUTELY DETEST THE USE OF FAT SUITS IN MOVIES AND ON TV."

I go to expensive grocery stores and feel paranoid when I don't buy anything. A man in an apron gives me spicy guacamole to sample. I buy the container though it is five bucks. I eat greek yogurt with strawberry in my car and feel strange. A tiny accomplishment for me is making my own potato salad. I tried to make it Korean style. For some reason, I've been trying to learn Korean cooking lately. Why?

I was thinking about last year. One of the most important friendships of my life is seemingly over. Why? I tried to make a list. I feel like I cannot write in poems all the time and that was what was expected of me. I thought about how I tried to meet her for dinner when we were both in NY and how she purposely took a different train, went in a different direction. 

I don't think I'll ever be perfect. I like some of my mistakes. I take it personally when the sink gurgles up water from another apartment. I imagine my neighbors can hear me when I watch Korean variety shows. I imagine they are curious about why they can suddenly hear their native language. 

I'm terrified of singing in front of my classmates. I bought a cheap tape recorder. I had imagined or remembered my singing voice differently. It sounded muffled and congested when I played it back. It was disappointing. I guess I don't know how to play any instruments. I guess I'm bad about bank accounts and can't cry on the phone when it is expected of me. I wrote her a very kind email to explain, but she wrote back to tell me that she was feeling good about her life before I called her."

"event","I've been thinking a lot about childhood trauma--maybe because of my childhood and creativity seminar. I think Professor Cech makes interesting points when he critiques films. I remember how he hated Marie Antoinette (which I happened to like) and his points about Slumdog Millionaire being somewhat manipulative and disingenuous were well-argued. But...

I still really liked the movie. And I really liked it precisely because of the fast-paced ending. In fact, when I went to see it, I found the scenes of childhood a little too familiar. I also think that the romance was somewhat forced at times; I couldn't really understand why the main character had this almost obsessive attachment to the female lead. But I really liked the movie precisely because of how it ended. And I liked the dance at the end. And I think this mix of genres does seem counterintuitive, but at the same time, these children who live through that experience of poverty are capable of play and dance and fantasy. And humor and absurdity. And using both the adult actors and child actors in that dance sequence during the credits felt like this somewhat symbolic attempt at a revision of the childhood traumas we experience when we're very young. If you can find some semblance of happiness and security and love, isn't that inner child also somewhat nurtured and reassured? 

So, I was thinking of things that seemed terribly frightening to me as a child, such as Jack the Ripper. One time I came into the living room and my father was watching some special on Jack the Ripper. It had a scary voice over like Robert Stack's from Unsolved Mysteries (another source of many a traumatic experience), and I think it might have had a reenactment too. Maybe it was a segment of that show? After all, they never did find the killer. Anyway, that time period in London with its cobblestone streets and lack of sanitation still gives me chills. You had people struggling to survive, and rich Victorians living just blocks away. And, somehow, I think I conflated Jack the Ripper with Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. 

Anyway, I've been watching Jack the Ripper documentaries on Youtube. He still scares me. 

On a random note, I really wish the University Writing Program hadn't messed up our fee waivers. I'm still waiting for my financial aid to be disbursed, which is frustrating. I'm going to try really hard to maintain a budget this semester. 

I also hate that my upstairs neighbors make a lot of noise. I keep telling myself that it's the old building and that those people upstairs are not doing Riverdance or purposely trying to drive me crazy. My last neighbor made absolutely no noise whatsoever, so I'm not sure what's up. I feel like one of them does laps or something. I went up there to hand deliver an important letter from INS that was accidentally put in my mailbox. A Korean woman answered the door and seemed really startled and kind of annoyed that I had knocked. I also noticed that there was absolutely no furniture in the apartment. 

Okay, I'll stop talking about my weird neighbors now.

Of course, there are things that bother me. When will I have time to return all those damn library books? I try to take one book to campus per day to lighten my load. I suppose I could drive up after hours. Also, why do I constantly ignore things, hoping they will magically resolve themselves? I need to start apartment hunting. And summer job hunting.

Korean Sol-Na is coming up (lunar New Year); it coincides with my Mom's 57th birthday (58 according to the Korean calendar). I'm going to make one final trip to Tallahassee and make kyung dan rice cakes, miyeok guk (seaweed soup), and bi bim bap. You're traditionally supposed to eat rice cake soup, but we ate that January 1st. I love trying to cook Korean dishes.

I was sitting in my apartment Friday morning and heard a faint knock (one knock, that's it--and I do have an extremely loud doorbell), but it didn't occur to me for some reason that it was my door. So, later that night, about seven, I left to feed Phoebe's cat Sammy. Stuck on the door was an info-notice thingy from UPS saying they had delivered my book on 9/13 (it was 9/12--I can only assume that the delivery guy made a mistake) and that it was on my porch. Well, it so wasn't. 

I HATE WHEN THAT HAPPENS! 

Later that night I tried to check its status on the UPS website using the number on the info-notice sticker. Well, the number was not found. I called and made it through the extremely annoying automated answering service to discover the same thing. So I checked on Amazon where they give you a preliminary tracking number. It was delivered and signed for by PARK??? 

The next morning I went to the leasing office, assuming the delivery person had gone there to drop it off. Well, he or she hadn't and they didn't have the package. 

I'm super confused. And I can't compain to UPS; the sender has to do that. I'm in the process of contacting Amazon, but their main advice on the website is to ask neighbors. 

That's happened to me before when I lived in Tallahassee, but mainly because the delivery person made a mistake with the address. Why would UPS stick a notice on my door, the right door, and then give the package to another apartment? That seems so strange.

I asked the neighbors that live directly to the left of me and they have no idea where the package is. Now, I have to ask the other apartments and I feel like pulling my hair. This is ridiculous. 

What was the point in paying extra to have it over-nighted???

I hate UPS!

To make matters worse, I'm ordering another book that is being shipped by UPS next week. I'm in the process of making a gigantic sign that reads PLEASE LEAVE MY PACKAGE IN THE LEASING OFFICE, NOT WITH A NEIGHBOR I DON'T KNOW.

And if the delivery person had left it on my stoop and someone stole it (highly unlikely), then who the hell is PARK?


GRRRRRRR."

"event","Am I the only person on the planet who doesn't understand the function of a bathroom heating lamp? Is it supposed to give me a fake tan while sitting on the toilet? I SO don't get it. It's not like I live in sub-Arctic temperatures. It's often too hot and stuffy in my bathroom to begin with. 

While taking my afternoon nap today, I was awakened by the sound of loud drips coming from my bathroom. Lo and behold, there was water leaking from the fucking heating lamp, water dripping from the apartment above (probably from a direct pipe connected to the toilet of the mysterious tenant who likes Huey Lewis and the News). I started panicking (except in mid-nap panic mode I sort of just stand there dumbfounded). In that moment, I regretted not buying that 8 dollar stock pot from Ikea. At the time, I thought, ""Oh, you'll never eat that much spaghetti by yourself--why waste the money."" Now I realize that I have no real, deep containers to shove under leaky ceilings should the need arise. And I have no renter's insurance, should a tree branch suddenly fly through my window and shatter my TV. Or a wayward tornado come spinning into Gainesville. I hate that feeling of...insecurity.

I've been having a few plumbing problems as of late. It started with an unusual leak spurting up from beneath my living room carpet a few weeks ago, and now this. I'm ready to find a new place! I think my complex should give me a brand-new fridge to compensate. And maybe a gift certificate to the Outback or something."

"event","I love Wal-Mart mint chocolate chip ice cream. It's only $2.50 a gallon. That's less than: A. 4 sticks of butter, B. a gallon of milk, and C. a gallon of gas. I spent 53 bucks the other day to fill up my tank. I was traumatized. So, here is my GOOD THINGS THAT ARE CHEAPER THAN A GALLON OF GAS list. Because it feels damn good to pay a pittance for something that brings you a small thrill:

(in no particular order)

Movies at the library. COST: $0
They usually have a great selection. In the past few weeks I've rented: Babel, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Alien, An Officer and a Gentleman (ha, ha--not as good as it was when I was 12), L'Auberge Espagnole, Highlights from the Electric Company (a real snore--well, the cat seemed enthralled by all the psychedelic colors), Don't Look Now (see previous post with rockin' Donald Sutherland pic), etc.

Magazines at the public library. COST: $0
Yes, this is beginning to sound like a plug for the local library. I spend a fortune on magazines that get read once and then recycled (or kicked under the bed and then found a year later during a cleaning spree). Well, the library lends out all the latest mags for free. And the library in Tallahassee lets you take them home for a week. So, that's my new thing. But I would totally be up for a local magazine exchange with anyone who has a subscription to something.

McDonalds Ice Cream Cones. COST: $1 (plus tax)
I know those golden arches are evil. But they have good, cheap soft-serve. The end. 

DVDs at Big Lots. COST: $3
I was there recently and found a bunch of DVDs for waaaaay cheap. And I ususally think 10 bucks at Target is pretty good for that movie you just love and want to invest in owning. I found In the Cut and Almodovar's Talk to Her for just 3 bucks a piece. And I'm pretty sure the titles rotate.

The Dollar Bin at Target. COST: $1, duh. Though sometimes they have stuff for $2.50 (still cheaper than gas!). 

I'll add to this later--when I find more bargains! Things ARE more expensive, especially food.


SPOILER BELOW!!!!!! LOOK AWAY NOW IF YOU HAVE YET TO SEE THE SATC MOVIE!!!!!


Yes, I flung myself onto that bandwagon and recently saw the Sex and the City movie. There were all types of women packed into that theater. In fact, I have never been in a room with that many women before. It was strangely empowering and depressing at the same time (depressing that I felt like a part of the cliche known as ""chick flick""? Possibly). NOW FOR MY LAST SPOILER ALERT

...so Stanford and Anthony got together???? Whatever happened to Stanford's hot boyfriend Marcus? 

...and why did Mr. Big sort of gross me out? Especially that scene with his lacquered chest. 

...and why did Carrie get all pissed at Miranda on V-Day? I know what Miranda said to Big was mean and bitter, but she didn't ruin Carrie's wedding. Mr. Big did (and calling him Mr. Big is kind of...ew)! I know, I know. It was because Miranda kept a secret. Whatever.

...and was it me, or did they make: A. Charlotte a cartoon character, B. Miranda snarkier than usual, and C. Samantha the only totally reasonable one of the bunch???? 

...can you really get married in the NYC public library? That would be awesome."

That will be my summer project #2 (#1 is finding a job). So I went to the public library and checked out about half of what was in stock (much to the bewilderment of the librarians on duty--they either think I have a young, ravenous child at home, or am plain weird). I'm currently reading <i>The Truth About Stacey</i>. Anyone want to start a BSC Book Club with me???

I tried to do a Jedi mind trick and imagine myself on an iceberg in Antarctica, but alas, the experience of sitting at the bus stop with heat radiating into my jeans was too vivid to trick away. I need to go shopping. I love shopping, sometimes. Clothes shopping is okay, but the body hate sometimes gets in the way. I love pushing a cart through Target. But are they losing their touch? I don't see as many cute things. They need to hire a new shoe designer, I think. The Converse thing is a little strange. They are slowly transforming into a department store that sells deodorant. Maybe I'll get a job at Target? Oh, but then I won't enjoy it as much as a shopper. And what if one of my students sees me and thinks, ""Oh okay, so that's what you do with an MFA""? That might be devastating.

I want to watch all the Back to Future movies back to back (well, maybe not the Western one with Mary Steenburgen (sp??). She irks me. Plus I hate the ""wild west."") When I went to Universal Studios a few years ago with some friends, we rode the Back to the Future ride. I hate to say it, but it made me nauseous and sentimental--a lethal combination: you want to cry but you're ready to puke your guts out. The technology was outdated and the screen a bit scratchy, and it made me nostalgic for something--maybe that childhood infatuation with themeparks? That sort of early 90s Nickelodeon afternoon TV lineup with all the slime. And for the 80s. And the ET ride had this incredible smell--a sort of familiar, synthetic, pool-chlorine scent. I want to go back (though it's horrendously overpriced, overcrowded, and commercialized) before they yank out all those favorites and replace them with superhero franchises."

I wonder how long asparagus can keep in the fridge. There were some on sale at the grocery store and since I can never afford really good, exciting vegetables (like those brilliant gold and red peppers), I couldn't resist. Next, I will pay a little more for an extravagant pound of brussel sprouts (love them--they remind me of mini heads of lettuce, which is too cute).

I invent awkward moments for myself. Like driving home from the reading tonight and having to pass a slew of other MFAs walking to their cars. Don't know why, but that felt really strange. Someone much cooler would have just rolled down a window and let out a howl or something. I just crept by and wanted to duck down in the seat (as if a parent were dropping me off at the prom or something). I am far too self-aware. I will cease to be an MFA very soon. Should prove interesting. 

I love Maira Kalman's blog for the NY Times: http://kalman.blogs.nytimes.com/index.php?cat=12
And those Max Stravinsky books. But I don't think my art is anything like hers (I don't think my art is anything at all--it's not even ART. It's margin doodles, scribblings, curling lines, and small portraits of girls (because boys are too hard to draw). I also like creating brick walls and small geometric shapes). 

Phoebe Gloeckner (another artist I greatly admire) is speaking tomorrow at the Comics Conference. Should I drive home afterwards for Easter? My mother wants to barbecue, but the thought of driving alone on a Friday night makes me uncomfortable and sad. I'm so sick of that drive, back and forth, same sudden junction, a converging other highway, and large trucks that barrel through, glaring down on you with highbeams. I hate that I owe the Leon County public library 70 bucks because my sister lost a Gnarls Barkley cd. I hate the traffic in Gainsesville, the car accidents.

I composed a blog entry in my head yesterday while riding the bus home. But what I've just written is nothing like it. I forget all the seemingly important things I want to say."

I sat on the bus and heard this: ""I can't eat fried rice. I'm allergic to fried rice."" I'm the only one on the route who doesn't wear earbuds. I eavesdrop by default. I fell asleep, jerking my head up, afraid I'd miss my stop. Everyone is traveling back home for Spring Break. I browse the Alachua Animal Rescue site because I want to adopt a cat.

My thesis is nearly done--everything but the abstract and about two poems that Sidney feels need another revision (in my opinion, all 30 or so of my poems need about 10 more revisions each). I don't think there's ever a sense of completion in poetry--except maybe with publication? I don't know how to answer that since I've only been published once; I look at that poem now and see a million ways it is lacking.

In other news, I hate Smathers Library! It has about as much warmth as a video rental place: you're in and out. I've never felt like really cozying up in a chair and reading, or doing research at one of the tables, tables that are harder to get than seating at the mall food court on a Saturday. Once I was sitting at a table reading some plays by Frank Chin (for my Asian-American Studies course, not because I remotely <i>like</i> Frank Chin) and this girl came up to the table and said, ""are you leaving soon? Because this table is for laptop use."" She gestured to the built-in outlet. I was pissed. ""No,"" I answered. ""But you can sit down on the other side."" Which she did. I left shortly after--the moment had been lost for me. 

I know I'm ranting, but I would like to say one final thing about that disaster of a library (okay, the selection is pretty good, Dr. Van Hook is a great wealth of information, I do like the location/outside architecture, though the inside feels like a department store): the staff who work at the front desk are HORRIBLY MEAN. Well, there are a few people who are efficient AND kind, but there is one guy (hate to blacklist, but he's an asshole) who is such a jerk. I always, though I try so hard no to, end up being ""checked out"" (library terms, not type of social behavior) by him. He doesn't make eye contact, he doesn't smile, he rolls his eyes at some of my selections (what's with that?). And once he accused me of stealing when I walked through the anti-theft gate and my books went off. I HATE HIM!!!!!

If there is any justice in the world, that guy is going to get his just deserts (yes, I spelled it right--it's derived from the french verb TO DESERVE, not DESSERTS, as in cake and pie. Never title a poem that and submit it for workshop). Maybe he'll walk into a Blockbuster, rent a copy of Harold and Maude (because he so seems the type), have the clerk roll his eyes and be devastatingly curt, and then he'll walk through the anti-theft device to hear ""PLEASE RETURN TO THE DESK. PLEASE RETURN TO THE DESK."" He will blubber about: ""Oh, I guess you didn't scan the video on that sensor thingy."" And the clerk will snap, ""Or you just stole something!"" 

Okay, Blockbuster videos don't need to be ""scanned."" Maybe a better scenario would be a scene from that movie ""Brokedown Palace,"" or better yet ""Midnight Express."" Caught smuggling something and thrown into a filthy cell.

Well, I feel a smidge better."

"event","So I spent five days in NY and am back to relate my narrow-minded tale in the form of a stilted, less emotional diary. 

Tuesday:
Left Tallahassee and flew into La Guardia. Jenny and I had no problem finding our way to the taxi stand. I can't even remember my first view of the city. It was slightly chilly and gray. We got into a yellow cab (small SUV actually) and then were rushed onto a confusing, congested express way. The cab driver was listening to Latin American pop music (though the ""Rider's Rights"" plaque plastered in plain view said this was a no-no). He was nice though. He helped us with our luggage, so I felt obligated to tip him a few dollars extra. I was careful to get off curbside. I felt like such a backwards hick. Our hotel on the Upper West Side was tremendously quaint, in a rambling, historical building with tiny renovated elevators. Did I say tiny? Make that minuscule. I felt like I was in a mirrored coffin.

The room was on the 8th floor at the end of a few yellow-painted hallways. It was pretty spacious with a corner fireplace (pure decoration) and large geometric lampshades hanging from the ceiling. We regrouped and then decided to venture out to Filene's Basement, which Jenny could spy up Broadway through the slats of our blinds. She had remembered watching one of those bridezilla reality shows on Style Network where a bunch of women ransacked Filene's for discount, designer bridal gowns. 

The walk at first (about three blocks) was too much for me. Did I mention I had tuberculosis at the time? Well, maybe not TB, but something definitely related. Not to mention that I'm not the most gazelle-legged human on the planet. And I was afraid of being shot. Seriously. I'm crazy and paranoid. 

But we made it. Nothing really interested me. It kind of was like a basement--the clothes felt a little bit out of date and musty. Not to mention the upstairs/downstairs thing (A LOT of stores in NY have this set-up--I guess because space is so limited). And I guess escalators are for stores that cater to fat, Southern TB victims. Plus, they ruin the store's industrial feel. So I was beat.

By then it was getting dark. We had dinner and then crammed into our tiny little elevator to head for bed.


Wednesday:
Got up sort of early to venture to Parson's so Jenny could make it to the Fashion Department tour. This meant having to go into the scary part of NY known as the subway. We walked a few blocks to the nearest Metro stop. I assumed it was heading downtown because the traffic was moving in that direction. Figuring this out later on in our trip became progressively harder. Especially when dealing with a one-way above-ground street. We both bought unlimited seven day cards (I definitely recommend this--there's nothing more shame-worthy than a blustering tourist trying to scan a card with no rides left). Everyone around us looked pretty normal. For some reason, I was expecting a scene out of that 70's flick <i>The Warriors</i>. You know, menacing guys in bandannas with baseball bats. The ride downtown was simple, though I worried about trying to walk out the wrong side of the car and revealing my true tourist identity. Unfortunately, we got off at 14th Avenue, which is where Parson's campus is located, except for the Fashion Department, which is on Fashion Avenue (7th). We got back on the subway and rode it a few stops uptown. 

I was expecting a more fashionable building with tons of glass, splashy furniture in the lobby, and artwork. NOPE. Totally drab. There wasn't even anywhere to sit, so we stood against a wall, while all the design students filed outside for lunch somewhere chic. They were mostly girls, mostly Asian, and mostly wearing slouchy boots, boxy overcoats, and berets. They made me sick. I was wearing yellow sneakers and, like a dork, had double-tied my laces. All the students knew the security guard by name, talked about art house films, and then flicked ash into a row of equally drab bushes lining the front walk. I just stared, while Jenny adjusted her own beret. There was one other girl waiting for the tour. This Japanese girl from Kyoto. She looked kind of like Giada from Everyday Italian, except Japanese. 

Oh, and guess what? The tour guide never showed up! Yeah. So we left after 45 minutes and walked around the garment district. Of course Jenny took pictures of that giant button being pierced by that giant needle (yes, I'm being completely literal). She was disappointed, but super envious of all the girls in their slouchy boots. She kept saying stuff like, ""wouldn't it be great to live here?"" To which I would respond, ""Uh, no."" Then proceed to hack up a lung.

We spent the rest of the day shopping. Macy's is ridiculous. For some reason, I felt compelled to go up every floor, as if I would discover something really cool at the top--like a 90% off sale or a dusty attic filled with mannequins. Nope. Just the luggage and furniture departments.

We had dinner back near our hotel at this place called the New Wave Cafe. I have to say, after venturing in pure tourist territory, I really loved the Upper West Side. It felt kind of familiar and somewhat peaceful. And safe.

And now, an essay entitled ""What I Did Over Thanksgiving Break"":

This Thanksgiving felt rushed and mundane. The turkey just laid there on its platter and did nothing. The pumpkin pies cracked in their foil pans. The weather fluctuated from warm to hot to freezing. I watched a Law & Order marathon. The episodes switched from SVU (not to be mistaken for SUV--now that would be a riveting crime drama!) to Criminal Intent (um, what's the difference? doesn't rape or sexual assault involve criminal intent?). I actually had to look up the entry on SVU on Wikipedia (my new friend) because I couldn't discern a pattern after watching 6 episodes about sexual crimes. Yes, it's true. That entire series revolves around a special police force that only deals with sexual assault, rape, etc. And now you know more than you ever cared to about Law & Order.

I also played a lot of Viva Pinata on X-Box Live. I don't have an X-Box Live (thankfully--I would never get anything done--oh wait, that's how it is now). Viva Pinata makes absolutely no sense to me, but is sit-on-the-couch-until-you-might-pee-in-your-pants addictive. You basically have a little plot of land that you have to cultivate into a garden to attract little pinata animals (think Neopets) that have names punned after candy (like the oh so cute raisant or taffly). I sucked at it, of course.

I also went and saw the new Stephen King adaptation <i>The Mist</i>. It tried too hard to be allegorical and ended up making little logical sense (obviously). The monsters weren't all that scary (um, except for Marcia Gay Harden who plays a freaky evangelist). But for a Stephen King movie, it might be worth paying for. Then I tried to think of the best Stephen King adaptation ever--probably Misery. Or the Shining (BECAUSE it takes great liberties with the text). Or what about that version of the Stand where Rob Lowe wears overalls? 

I can't wait until Lifetime starts running great masterpieces like ""A Smokey Mountain Christmas"" or ""I'll Be Home for Christmas"" (I completely made that last one up, but I have a hunch it exists). 

If those aren't your thing, here are a few of my holiday favorites:
1. Gremlins--ah, who can forget Phoebe Cates revealing why she can't stand Christmas. I think I love this movie mostly because it has that early 80s feel to it--and involves fuzzy animals who turn into bloodthirsty monsters.
2. Die Hard--the one where Alan Rickman is a terrorist. This film captures the utter terror of the office Christmas party. Good stuff.
3. Black Christmas (the original 70s one, not the awful remake with Michelle Trachtenberg).

I'm trying to get my appliction for the Ph.D. program turned in (well, at least the letters of recommendation--how do you even complete this process with a professor who is on sabbatical, out of town, and insistent on doing everything electronically? I mean, I lost the freakin' directions to my scanner), and I have to turn in a prospectus for my seminar paper, and read Proust, and grade 20 student papers. I feel like I'm spreading myself thin.

SIGHHHHHHHH.

But there are good things: holidays! I don't really know what Veteran's Day celebrates (and neither did my thesis advisor--she was pissed when she found out she had to rework our entire workshop schedule) but I'm really looking forward to SLEEPING IN on a Monday FOR ONCE. My Mondays are complete torture because I'm on campus for nearly 12 hours. And then there's Thanksgiving! A holiday where it is socially acceptable to engorge yourself on drippy, delicious foods. Um, I'm planning not to though (I am trying to lose weight! <i>trying</i> is the operative word). 

And then there are down comforters and 50 degree weather. Nothing is better. I love burrowing down beneath my covers (ignoring the crumbs in my bed), pretending that there is autumn outside.

And window shopping! So so fun when you're poor."

"event","I'm having an awful Monday. I contracted something icky (um, like a cold--not a yeast infection, thanks). I was in bed all weekend but felt so much better yesterday. I even got my shit done (including two new poems AND reading a 300-page novel in in one day). But then I woke up this morning and felt super icky again. 

I went to campus and met with Sidney. But I felt (and, I guess, looked) so bad, she sent me to the student health center. They couldn't fit me in today. Guess everyone's down with something. I'm going to try and make an appointment tomorrow. 

I feel like I'm going to a have a mini-breakdown soon. I think everyone is feeling this way too. I feel like I can barely function, even when I'm completely healthy. I'm really disorganized, I sleep too much, play too much Nancy Drew, and avoid working on my thesis. I'm a mess. 

(My nose hurts--especially the right nostril. It's weird because I haven't really been sneezing. It feels like a piece of sandpaper is jammed in it. Ouch.)

I finished the Stolen Child (I hope Anja doesn't think I cancelled today's meeting because I didn't read the book--sighhhh). It was creepy. I think one critic described it well by using the word ""unsentimental"" in regards to the writing style. Or maybe the word was ""desensitized""? It did remind me of <i>Time Traveler's Wife</i> (even the main character's name was the same). I didn't think it was as good though. I don't think I completely understand the hobgoblins (or fairies). Were they really just feral children? Were they magical beings? I found that the contemporary setting of the novel complicated those questions. And the repeated sex between two of the hobgoblins? Disturbing.

Okay, so I'm super excited that the Office comes back this Thursday. I've gone to Target three times and raided their dollar section for all the great Office goodies (go now). It's so so cheesy, but I had to get an ""I Heart Jim"" mug. Hope I don't get lead poisoning. That would suck."

"event","So, I'm back from St. Augustine. I survived a slight case of hydroplaning (awful rainstorms right outside of Gainesville), a smokey motel room with a squeaky bed, and sitting in a dress for four hours. The wedding was really lovely and low-key. The bride and groom and friends made all the food (the food was <i>amazing</i>. Everything was really natural, fresh, organic, etc.) And the groom even played a great song about Y2K on his acoustic guitar during the reception. And Maggie got up and sang the Book of Love with the musician at one point. That made me realize that I should be a little more self-assertive and well, brave. So I decided to venture out into the city and have dinner by myself. Well, I ended up in the historic part of town and it was so unbelievably cute, I thought I was in Disney World or something. I couldn't find parking so I went back to my motel and decided to walk to a restaurant nearby. Bad idea. The only thing close enough was a really scary seafood restaurant. As soon as I walked in, I wanted to walk out, but I'm so passive, I actually sat through a whole meal. Remember that scene in Goonies where the gang is in the old restaurant that the Fratelli family is using as a hide-out? Well, that was my dining experience in a nutshell. 

So now I'm back and my apartment smells like stale soy-sauce and I haven't done any homework. 

And now I've heard that Madeleine L'Engle has passed and that girl from High School Musical took nude photos of herself and they're on the internet. Wow, the world is strange.

I love <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i>. I tried reading the other books in the series, but never got around to it. I think I will sometime. I did read one of her weird romances <i>Jackeroo</i>. I was so astonished that she wrote romances, I couldn't resist. I liked it, although I didn't understand the prince in the story was only like ten or something until halfway through the book. I kept waiting for him and the protagonist to make-out.

PS.
I found myself watching Tim Gunn's new show last week and discovered that all my clothes suck. At least the people selected for that show on TLC were obviously bad dressers. Now Tim Gunn and Veronica Webb are finding women who <i>dress like me</i> to badger into wearing sexy lingerie. Can I just say that Veronica Webb's haircut kind of sucks? It makes her jawline look masculine. I don't understand it. And what I don't understand, I fear."

"event","I'm having an awful week

But I'm <i>really</i> having an awful day.

First of all, let me say that I got some really cute brown flats from American Eagle. I normally avoid this store like the plague because everyone in there, from the mannequinns to the soccer moms who are shopping against their will, is dressed like a rugby player and of Aryan descent. But somehow I found myself in there buying these flats which directly resulted in why I had a bad day. Thanks American Eagle Aryans!

So, I went to Tallahassee over Labor Day weekend. I got a dress for my friend Annie's wedding. Shopping for wedding attire happens to be the worst thing ever, you know, after harpooning baby whales and being Paula Abdul's personal assistant. First of all, you have to find something that is perfectly appropriate, so you're not the only person wearing brown in a church full of pinks and lavendars. At the same time, you can't get anything too cute or pretty, or you'll outshine the bride. Plus, when you happen to be less than svelte (like <i>waaaay</i> less), your options tend to shrink exponentially. 

But I managed to find something perfect.

So, I drive back to Gainesville Tuesday at the crack of dawn, while, back in Tallahassee, my newly purchased dress sleeps-in.

That was the start of my bad week.

I had to drive all the way to Tallahassee yesterday and get it because no one loves me enough to fed-ex. 

So I drive back to Gainesville this morning to make it to my ENC 1101 class. I'm tired. It's hot. And there's so much traffic because of the football game tomorrow. I have barely enough time to pull into my complex and run to the bus stop. And then... the bus never comes! I'm not sure what happened. It's always late, but today, it was nonexistent. My class starts at 12:50 and by 12:38, I started panicking and planning ways to hitchhike or double-park on campus.

Instead, I walked to the corner of the block and caught the 20. Big mistake. I sat next to this Chinese student (who introduced herself as Ting) and barraged her with questions about the route. I think she misunderstood where I wanted to get off at, because she kept insisting I had plenty of time. After the bus went by the Reitz Union, I knew I was doomed. Ting got off at the same stop to show me in what direction to head towards. We were in front of the Music Building, which happens to be pretty far from the Stadium and the Florida Gym where my class is located, and she was walking really fast in the tiniest heels I have ever seen. 

But the worst part was that I had decided to put my new shoes on this morning. Having to jog across campus in 90 degree weather is a bad way to break in new flats. I could just feel the skin on my toes popping into blisters. Gross, I know. And I have to wear open toe shoes to that wedding tomorrow. Yeah, I'm having a really bad week. So I get to class sweating like I just climbed out of a gorilla suit and I'm already 20 minutes late and half my students are leaving.

I ended up screaming ""I had a personal emergency!"" Which is kind of true. Leaving a perfect wedding guest dress 120 miles away kind of IS an emergency. Okay and taking the wrong bus. And wearing the wrong shoes. All of those things are emergencies...to me (and my blisters definitely qualify as a medical emergency).

So the class was all sympathetic (I didn't, um, give them the details).

SIGH.

So in conclusion, I would like to dedicate this entry to Ting and her tiny heels. 



PS. I got the Office season 3 on DVD. That makes my bad day kind of okay."

"event","Well, fall semester at UF has just begun! What does this really mean to me? Well, whenever I think of the first day of school, I think of my birthday (which was two or so weeks ago). And whenever I turn another year older, I am sadly reminded of my petty, pathetic existence on this planet. Have I done one remarkable or fascinating thing in my 25 years of living? Well, no! Am I at least writing a literary masterpiece in my spare time or saving cats from the pound? No, siree! Okay, then, am I having hot sex with my live-in boyfriend who happens to dabble in gourmet cooking? EH, no!

So, I thought it would be appropriate to pen a quick and gritty YOU KNOW WHO'S HOT? list. Somehow, compiling a list of guys waaaay out of my reach makes me feel better. 

YOU KNOW WHO'S HOT???

Christian Bale! I totally love him. I do. I would <i>do</i> him in a heartbeat. Yes, I'm that shallow. I don't even care that he's an excellent actor who takes on really challenging (and, ahem, psychotic) roles. But then, when I really think about it, would I really want to be married to the guy? Not so much. He was just <i>too</i> convincing as Patrick Bateman.

Gerard Butler. Except when he made some sexual comment about Paris Hilton at the VMAs. That made me want to puke on my cat. I like him even better brooding in the Paris Opera House with half a ceramic mask on his face.

John Krasinski. Duh. Or is it really Jim Halpert that's sexy? Trick question!

Zac Efron. Don't ask me why. His singing is cringe-worthy, his acting is twice as bad, and he totally got that gap in his teeth fixed! But he's still cute.

Justin Theroux. Cute, indie actor with a shock of black hair and often seen in hipster glasses. Very appealing.

Honorable Mention:

Ian Somerhalder--a little too pretty for my tastes but I have a friend who would beg to differ
That guy who played the lead in Perfume. Okay, I can't remember his character's name or his real name. But he was kind of hot (and psychotic)."

10 things I'm going to try and accomplish in ten weeks or so:

1. learn a conversation in Japanese
2. use Flickr more
3. bring my lunch to school everyday
4. put 500 dollars into my savings account (saving for a trip to France next year!)
5. clean and organize apartment--especially closets
6. get to bed by 2am every night
7. keep my class attendance records nice and neat
8. read novels more carefully; write good response papers/annotated bibliography entries/general notes
9. refrain from buying magazines
10. take the bus to save gas and mileage!

good news! I got a sofa. It's a loveseat (terribly small--but space IS limited in maison de michele) with a hideous maroon palm frond pattern. But it was totally and completely free! My grandmother offered to drive it down here too, so now I really need to clean my shit up. 

I'm also super excited that Sara is visiting (don't worry--I'll take the couch--I wouldn't force a guest to sleep on something so cringe-worthy)! And I am planning to visit Kira sometime in August (or maybe September?) now that she has her own apartment. 

So I guess I shouldn't feel so sad about the next six weeks. I have good things to look forward to, although moving back to gainesville and campus is always a bit lonely at first. I need a cat...or a boyfriend?"

(Ignore the coy little bobble-head next to him. Also, this is a really bad picture. He's hotter than this) 

What's with Japanese guys and their effeminate ways??? Why do I find their choppy, bad-dye-job haircuts appealing, their tiny bird-like chests sexy? Am I crazy? Am I breathing in too much recycled air from my 1978 air conditioner that kicks in like a V6 engine? I have been cooped up in this shit hole for five days straight. I'm waiting for the rest of my ""teaching team"" to finish their seminar papers, so we can get together and grade. In the meantime, I've been watching cheesy Japanese dramas like Taiyou No Uta, about a girl who has some sort of allergy to UV rays. She falls in love with Tsukamoto's character and then *SPOILER* dies. But not before she cuts a cd debut. I have to admit, it made me cry and feel depressed. I mean, even girls with mysterious sun allergies can become popular singers and make hot surfers fall in love with them. And here I am, reading cheesy Christoper Pike novels and complaining about how my next door neighbors sweep the dead leaves on their porch onto my welcome mat (don't you think that's incredibly rude???). I should be traveling, getting drunk on trains--okay, nobody gets drunk on trains. I don't even know what I'm supposed to be doing because I'm abnormal. I just want to eat lots of chocolate cake and die.

Okay, enough of that.

I got my poetry grade--I did okay, barely. I picked my thesis advisor. I read eight student papers. I took a long shower and contemplated cutting bangs. Then I remembered what I looked like in 1992 and changed my mind. I checked my email. This girl Erin, my best friend in middle school and high school, sent me a Myspace friend request. It was weird because I had been thinking about her lately and how she would find effeminate Tsukamoto hot too. It's weird when someone ""friends"" you but doesn't really send you a message, etc. I left her a kind comment that was like ""yeah, let me know what you've been up to."" Maybe we can start communicating again, but maybe not. I'm okay with that. I feel tired when it comes to maintaining friendships. I want things to always be the same, but of course this is impossible. I hate it when things become unmanageable, when people just lose touch."

I think so, on some level. I can adapt pretty well in certain social situations and in others, I'm complete roadkill, terrified and frozen in a door jamb. I like kind people who ask me questions in return. I guess my answer is yes (but I'm still an EMOTIONAL VAMPIRE).

52. What is your favorite time of day?
That's easy--nap time"

1. Tattered Christopher Pike novels found only in the nether regions of some dusty Goodwill or the public library on one of those nifty swivel shelves. I love love love me some Christopher Pike and I'm not sure why. His books make no sense at times and he tends to kill off all the cute, witty guys. I spent part of my Saturday just wandering around the young adult section of the Leroy Collins Public Library and was delighted by the copious amounts of Choose Your Own Adventure novels that range from exciting titles like TERRORIST TRAP to the more bland YOU'RE A SOCCER STAR!  I also stopped a while to browse the FEAR STREET series penned by RL Stine. I have to say that I love great literature, but I get a little nostalgic kick inside whenever I think about how great it was to be a preteen, curled under the covers, reading about deranged killers and psycho babysitters. If you'd like your own slice of nostalgia pie, I recommend checking out Pike's Chain Letter, Slumber Party, and Last Vampire.

I used to assist the ESL teacher in high school and one of her Chinese students gave me some C-pop (Chinese pop music) tapes to listen to. One was of A-mei, an insanely popular singer from Taiwan. The music was cheesy but kind of catchy. It was also absurdly good for just listening to on your headphones at night, you know, when you just wanted to daydream about someone completely out of your league. Now, like ten years later, I find myself watching all these corny videos on Youtube instead of grading papers. I also think it's great that most Asian music video show producers know people are going to be singing along, so they include the lyrics right there for you. It's like ready-made karaoke. Another guilty pleasure is Coco Lee's Stay With Me (http://youtube.com/watch?v=w2yAGb2bXOU).

3. Vanilla frosties at Wendy's. Maybe they don't make me crazy, but they certainly make me fat.

4. J.Lo's Glo perfume. It actually smells really really good. I take secret sniffs of it in department stores when the sales clerks aren't looking. I tend to lean towards perfumes that have incredibly dumb names, like Escada's Rockin' Rio. I know these scents are geared towards teens and tweens, but can't there be a little more dignity involved? Nobody over the age of 16 wants to admit that they are wearing anything rockin'."

"event","Okay, so I'm not going to the poetry reading tonight. I swear it's because I'm sick. It has nothing to do with the fact that I've already crawled into my pjs and am planning on playing the Sims 2 for hours on end. I swear to Jesus. 

But I actually woke up this, er, afternoon and felt completely shitty. Instead of drowning my congested sinuses with a Netti Pot or taking Claritin, I just pray every night (""Are you there God? It's me, Michele...""). Jesus is my Claritin. 

But seriously, I went to the ""informal"" meeting with the editors today at the Reitz union and felt like shit. I basically held my breath the whole time because I couldn't breathe through my nose and I didn't want my fellow MFAs to label me a MOUTH BREATHER, which I totally am. And I couldn't cough either because they were sharing some important, secret, insider shit like don't forget your cover letter and don't send us a twelve page poem. So I felt like I was going to pass out. And there were only seven of us there plus this undergraduate fiction student who got confused and sat in the wrong room, and I think William Logan was put off. I just checked my email and he sent out a warning that we poets better show up for the reading tonight. But I'm not going and now I feel a tad guilty.

But I'm sick!

I am still meeting Martha Collins tomorrow at the ungodly hour of 10am. She ended up being really hilarious and approachable, but I still think tomorrow is going to be about kindly informing me that I'm just not good enough yet. I've fortified myself, wrenched my tear ducts shut, padded my fragile ego. I'm so ready to get a little beaten up.  

I totally lied during the informal Q&A session though. Martha was like ""how many of you have sent out stuff?"" and I raised my hand. I had to lie. It's like being the only virgin in a room full of girls gone wild. I'm <i>going</i> to send out my stuff, I just can't afford postage right now. I swear. I thought I could live on pasta but the stuff makes me hurl, so my postage money goes towards more yummy food. Sorry American Poetry Review. You know your publication has suffered because of my adversion to pasta.

But the other big reason I'm not going to the reading is because my sister is coming to visit tomorrow and my apartment is trashed. I don't want people thinking I live with a satanist cult, so I've got to clean my ass off tonight. 

Oh yeah, and happy Friday the 13th! 

Here's a greedy little list of things I'm dying for (please Jesus, give me some salt and pepper shakers!):

1. I'm dying to see this Korean movie The Host. 
<p><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/229/458192054_4db9a9c00a_m.jpg"" width=""170"" height=""240"" alt=""the host"" /></p>
In it, a young Korean girl is taken captive by this crazy monster that crawls out of the Han. It's gotten rave reviews. The movie, not the monster, duh. 

2. I'm dying for these little fuckers <p><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/207/458193926_ba6027c7b3_m.jpg"" width=""197"" height=""240"" alt=""wishingfish"" /></p>
<p>They're being sold at wishingfish.com</p>

3. And you know what? I think I need an owl lamp.

"event","These next few days are going to be ULTRA busy. First of all, this weekend is our editor's visit. Basically, the Department gets four editors, two poetry and two fiction, to come out and meet with the grad and undergrad writing students. We submitted a writing sample in advance, so I guess my meeting is going to consist of Martha Collins pointing out how much my writing sucks. I'm prepared for the worst. In true slacker fashion, I researched Collins only yesterday to discover that her writing style is nothing like mine. In fact, I don't think my own poetry is even like mine. I just haven't been happy with anything I've written this year. 

I still believe I have acute bronchitis. I spent the entire weekend arguing with my sister who seems to think bronchitis is the same as cholera. She was like, ""no, if you had bronchitis you would be dead by now."" I ended up printing out some things from the Mayo Health Clinic online. Finally, she conceded. I had won the battle, but I was still coughing my poor little lungs out. And that's how I spent my Easter holiday, propped on five pillows and clicking cough drops in my teeth. I'm going to go to the student clinic on Wednesday if I don't feel any better. I just don't have any time to get better. I've got papers to grade, papers to write, poems to revise, and money issues to stress about. GRRRR.

Okay, so I thought I had lost all hope in MTV when they came up with NEXT and Date My Mom. But while sick, I ended up watching A LOT of MTV and discovered a few shows worth tuning in to. First of all, I love Taquita and Kaui. Basically, two best friends who didn't make the band (Dannity Kane--stupidest name ever--sounds like an anchor from Fox News) decide to move to Las Vegas to make it big. First of all, the show is obviously staged--I'm sure MTV lines up the jobs for the girls and puts them in crazy situations. But the girls have such great personalities and really support each other, which is refreshing. I'm tired of seeing women on the Real World fall down drunk or talk shit about each other while sunbathing in a handkerchief. I want to see buffet dinners and trips to the laundromat and grocery shopping.

I also love Adventures in Hollyhood which follows Three 6 Mafia and their move from Memphis to the West Coast. The show is hilarious (and again, most likely staged--I mean, didn't they go to California to perform on the Oscars??). In the first episode, the guys have a barbeque to meet their white neighbors and no one shows up (well, except for one batty lady). I guess this show will have to fill my Entourage void, since I can't afford HBO.

PS. Wasn't Jim being pissy to Pam last Thursday??? It's not her fault Roy wanted to pound his face into raw dough. GRRRRR."

"event","Ok. So I have one of these crazy livejournals.  I wanted to make this because 1) I was curious as to what the livejournal featuers were.. and 2) there were things that livejournal users could do that I wanted to do too - ex. participate in community journals such as the one for my school.  So I up and did it.  I do have a regular online journal.. so check it out at <A HREF=""http://fiduciae.easyjournal.com"">http://fiduciae.easyjournal.com</A>.  We'll see how much I use this thing.  Ciao"

"event","So today was the absolute coolest thing I have ever done in my entire life...Tim Ritchie, I forgot how much I love you, back in the summer when we were together everyday was awesome and I totally forgot until today! 
So, Sarah comes and picks me up and we go and get Tim...Tim and I just harrass Sarah the whole time cuz she sucks at driving and we just made it worse then we drove past the carnival so, of course we had to stop and go on the ferris wheel(only white people there) but the Carney let us stay on the ferris wheel for like ten minutes...then we went to Sarah's house to  get a flashlight cuz we were gunna go and explore cooks pond...instead she got this neon blue lazar light but it was all good cuz i just happened to have a neon red lazer in my bag so Tim and I decided we would have ""groove sessions"" in the woods...so we did, but then we came across a fire and got scared so we left and went to Newton hill...we then spent 30 min. on top of Newton Hill dancing to our own beats with our lazer lights...Tim and I are friggin awesome...eventually we got Sarah to join...then we went driving and at every red light Tim and I jumped out of the car and had a groove session until it turned green when we would jump back into the car...so many people saw us! 
Then we went and crashed Lauren Cooks b-day party(3 people there) we ran in, danced for 5 min. and then danced out and left...they are gunna hate us...I LOVE IT!
 Then we went to friendlies cuz we had a 31 dolla gift card and got ice cream and danced some more...dance trains and circles are amazing!!! We then went back to Newton Hill and danced in front of the Divine tree(only cross country people will know what that is)Then drove Tim home where I stole Sarah's car and Tim and I drove around while Sarah chased us but then started dancing on the side of the street...pretty much we are just awesome and I love Tim Ritchie!"

So we went to Tortilla Sams to see Electris Snake 3000 play(ardie and teddy) mad ill and we drop Amanda off at her house.  On the way home down Moreland we almost hit, what we thought was, a snow bank.  We narrowly avoided it and realized it wasn't a snow bank it was a friggen dead animal but we couldn't figure out what it was cuz it was fucking huge!  So we turn around and drive back past it...we see another car go by it, slow down, and keep going but it didn't move.  As we drove past it the fucking thing looks at us and sits up so now we are flipping out.  We drive by it again and there is another car that drives by, slows down, and keeps going...still no sign of movement, just laying there dead.  Now we are confused as shit so we have to drive by it again...we do and it is still dead so we had to turn around to get back to my house so we do and drive past it and it is laying there dead until we get right next to it then the fucking thing stands up and comes toward us...holy shit I think I peed myself.  Kate just stepped on the gas and we didn't even look back...I am not going to be able to sleep tonight cuz that deer wanted to eat me...vegetarians my ass!

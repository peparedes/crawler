It's been raining all week, which is really nice.  We need it terribly.  We've already had a major fire near Payson, and they're saying this fire season will be worse than any before because of the drought.  

I want to live where it green and wet.  This week has reminded me of Denmark---the way it smells because of the rain.  It used to be like that all the time here.  It was wet 90% of the year.  I wish the drought would end.  ;("

"event","if you are a doctor, and you have a patient come in who, a year ago, saw another doctor, AS A DOCTOR, you cannot get involved in this patient's medical treatments or you can be ""fired"" from being a doctor.  
My doctor's on vacation, so I make an appointment with another doctor, because I am concerned about the fact that I've gained 25 pounds in a few months for no apparent reason, and because I am more anxious than usual.  When I mention to her that I had considered taking the Ativan I take to help me sleep--during the day because of my increased anxiety level---she completely loses all sensibility.  ""I cannot and WILL not get involved in Dr. """" treatment of you for this condition without his express permission--this is a dangerous drug---we do not step on each other's toes that way---I could get fired for that""  SEVERAL TIMES, she says this in different ways.  So I ask, well, I've never talked to him about the weight gain---can you help me with that?  ""NO--- I will not treat you in any way without written consent from him"".  ""yes, but HE'S ON  VACATION""  she says ""THAT'S NOT MY PROBLEM"".  I'm a little befuddled, to say the least.  What if I was dying?  Would she help me then?"

I have a t-shirt with the owl thing on it. For those of you who don't know, the environmentalists stopped logging, and clearing of our forests for the past 7 or so years ""to save the spotted owl"" here in Az.  We have logged our forests for the past 50 years here, and managed to remain the largest stand of ponderosa pine IN THE WORLD for a reason.  Because we do not log indiscriminantly.  The stupid enviro's that convinced our stupid lawmakers to outlaw logging are just that--stupid.  They need to do their homework.

"event","I had my appointment today with Dr. Bowman.  I'm feeling better back-wise because he put me back together, but I'm still pretty sore.  He said that my kidney had moved again, down into my groin area, and kicked my pelvic bones way out of kilter.  It's happened before but not to the extent that it did this time---unless you count the time 5 years ago.  Anyway, I'm glad to know what it was.  I was getting worried that it wasn't a structural thing---and that would not be good.  

He also told me that I have to prioritize my ""stress-triggers"" and weed out what I can and cannot do anything about, and then BAG the rest of it----or I'm going to die.  Stress is literally killing me.  I've been so on edge this week, and I don't even know why.

I think my biggest stressor is just the kids.  I constantly worry about the kids-about someone hurting them.   And the animals.  And really anyone's sadness.  It's hard for me to take, and I don't know how to let that go.  

My 2nd biggest stressor is self-inflicted, which only causes me to stress more, knowing that.  I have to get my health under control.  There's really no justification for the way I've allowed my health to deteriorate when I KNOW what to do.  

The 3rd one is also self-inflicted, I think.  I get really upset when I think of how much I have NOT accomplished with my life.  

I'll have to finish the list later.  I've got a killer headache."

======================

God populated the earth with broccoli and cauliflower 
and spinach and green and yellow vegetables of all
kinds, so Man and Woman would live long and healthy
lives.

And Satan created fast food.  And fast food brought 
forth the 99-cent double-cheeseburger. And Satan said
to Man, ""You want fries with that?""
And Man said, ""Super size them.""

And Man gained pounds.

And God created the healthful yogurt that woman might 
keep her figure that man found so fair.

And Satan froze the yogurt, and he brought forth 
chocolate, nuts and brightly colored sprinkle candy to
put on the yogurt.
And woman gained pounds.

And God said, ""Try my crispy fresh salad.""

And Satan brought forth creamy dressings, bacon bits, 
and shredded cheese. And there was ice cream for
dessert.

And woman gained pounds.

And God said, ""I have sent you heart healthy 
vegetables and olive oil with which to cook them.""

And Satan brought forth chicken-fried steak in the 
restaurant so big it needed its own platter.  And Man
gained pounds, and his bad cholesterol went through
the roof.

And God said, ""You're running up the score, Devil.""  
And God brought forth the potato, a vegetable
naturally low in fat and brimming with nutrition.

And Satan peeled off the healthful skin and sliced the
starchy center into chips and deep-fat fried them. 
And he created sour cream dip also.  And Man clutched
his remote control and ate the potato chips swaddled
in cholesterol.  And Satan saw and said,
""It is good.""  And Man went into cardiac arrest.

And God sighed and created quadruple bypass 
surgery.....

And Satan created HMOs..."

"event","It's interesting how God works in our lives--and others' lives as well.  I love that movie ""signs"" with Mel Gibson.  It makes me think of how there are no coincidences in life, and how things are always working together for us.  A week or so ago, I was at the video store and saw this stray dog when I came out.  I usually keep some food in my car for that, but I didn't have any, and he looked hungry.  I was compelled to go into the convenience store and buy a bag of dog food.  But when I came out, the dog was gone.  I called to him and looked around, but to no avail.  So I finally just left.  And the dog food's been just sitting in my car since then.  Well today at Wal-mart, there was this man standing on the corner with a sign about how God is looking for compassionate people, and did you have any, etc...I noticed he had a dog, and he looked like he was hungry.  So I stopped and asked him if that was his dog, and what he needed.  I ended up giving him the dog food (along with some cash) and a bottle of water that I also had left in my car.  I had seen that guy there a few weeks ago, but I was going by him too fast to read his sign, and I don't remember him having a dog then.  Anyway, I just thought that was interesting.  If you take the time to notice, you can see the little ways that He works in our lives."

We had the funeral today.  It was short and sweet.  Poor TLJ.  The family came up for it, but DF left in a huff (as usual) and didn't really talk to anyone.  I think he was upset because I didn't say hello.  I forget that he's so easily wounded (as is everyone in that family).  I was just concentrating on trying to walk on the uneven, muddy ground, without causing serious damage to my back.  I have such a hard time staying upright, and it was really difficult, plus it took every ounce of energy I had, even leaning on N for support.  I wish I knew what this is.  There's nothing about it on webmd.com.  Anyway, then we all went to El Rancho for lunch, just to get together in a different, non-sad setting, and DF took off before he knew about it.  I'm sure he'll find out and be even more butt-hurt.  That's an adjective that we reserve for DF, because it's his most common demeanor.  BJ is handling the loss of their child much better than TLJ, which is to be expected, I guess.  He's not the one who carried him.  But his strength encourages me.  I sometimes wish that N was more like him.  SURE, we would fight all the time, because he like his woman submissive, and I am anything but that, but at least he has set values that don't fluctuate according to convenience.  

I started the Clan of Cave Bear series again.  This will be probably 10 times that I've read the whole series.  Maybe I should have lived in those times.  Or medieval times.  I often wonder why I am here now.  I feel so out of place."

They were helpful, but I think I've become dependent on excedrin pm.  I don't want to kill my liver, so I want to be dependent on any kind of drug, blast it.  And what really gets me is that I KNOW what to do, and I don't do it.  I KNOW how to get healthy and happy, yet I lolligag and hem and haw and basically just DON'T DO IT.  I don't understand my own psyche, so how can I expect anyone else to?  It sure would be nice, though.  To have even one person around who really did.  

N went to Phoenix to help my dad with his addition.  He was supposed to call this morning when he left, but I haven't heard from him.  It's really windy, too, so of course I'm worried.  But I'm sure he's fine.  Probably just getting the rest of the stuff he needs for the spec house.  It will be done within the next couple of weeks.  This is a really neat house, too.  He did a great job designing it.  I wish we could move into it."

"event","""God creates through evolution, because it is intrinsic in the character of God to create persuasively and not coercively. God doesn't interupt the causal flow, so anything that is considered miraculous is within the confines of the ""laws"" of nature. It also solves the problem of evil, because God doesn't create ex nihlo (out of nothing) but out of chaos (more about taht as I read more), so it can't be attributed to him all the suffering in the world when you have free agents who are responsible for their own actions. 

I believe Jesus Christ was God's decisive revelation and died on the cross of Calvary for the sins of mankind, rose 3 days later and appeared to over 5,000. I believe He fulfilled the prophecies of the Old Testament. And that He is active in those lives who choose to follow him--although I always believe God is working in everyone's life, He just can't work in those that have blasphemed the Holy Spirit. I believe his impact on others lives is revealed in his character as recorded in the synoptics (mattthew, mark, luke) and that being God, was able to show that God's character is just as much feminine as it is masculine--I don't believe God is any sex, so calling God a him or a her is below God and a needless anthropomorphizing. 

I am monist when it comes to the mind-body problem--that is where the panexperientialist comes from--, because I believe that matter possess experiential qualities, and that our minds our not made out of experienceless matter--the common belief in metaphysics of the mind is: starting from the assumption that everything is contained inside a causal arena, there is no way that a nonphysical intervention can be used to describe things like beliefs, and fears, so physicalists will say that consciousness emerges from nonexperiential matter. I am learning that this view of mind-body interaction, although it is the dominant paradigm, could be utterly false because of the problems it raises which I am not going to get into. With the panexpereintialist view, it is stated that experience can exist apart from the brain, so this is a materialistc (not atheistic materialism) view of how one can continue existing after death. Ultimately, the panexperientialist view is not dualistic, so I don't believe whatever it is that survives after death is fundamentally different stuff from what we as experiencing humans are.""

a gift our loving God has given,
Vanity never shall near you, yet
Inside those great big eyes of blue,
Nests a little imp and an angel, too.

Read our minds, sweet child from above, and
Enter into the world of love.
Everlasting is our love for you,
Dear, sweet imp, and angel too.

Cease to bedazzle with your smile;
Everyone needs to rest awhile, from
Surrendering every whit and whim, to
See that little smile again.
Nobody on earth, but Heaven knows you
Are a little imp, and an angel, too.

It's just this little Plaque kind of thing with a man and a woman comforting each other, and a little book about what Heaven will be like when we get there.  It would comfort me--so I got it.  But I don't know.  I honestly just don't know what to say to her.  I didn't even get a card, because I don't know what to write.  You know?  I've told her several times in the past that she will get pregnant again---this was after a miscarriage of a pregnancy that was only a couple of weeks or so along.  This is a different situation, and I can't say the same thing. Maybe I'll just get a blank card and write on it ""I'm here if you need me"" or something like that.  Any suggestions would be welcome."

"event","TLJ lost her baby.  She's actually still carrying it, and just waiting for it to abort.  I can't even imagine the depths of loss she is feeling.  She has waited for so long for this, (not nearly as long as us, plus she already has 3, but that's beside the point) and passed the first trimester, with everything looking fine.  It's 4 1/2 months along.  I didn't go see her---honestly, I don't know what to say, plus I wouldn't want anyone coming by or calling if it was me.  They didn't even want to tell anyone until the first trimester had passed, so they were sure it would last this time.  It really sucks.  I offered to take the kids, but BJ said they were ""okay"".  Yeah, whatever. 

I hope he's not going to be a prick again and make her go through this alone---and not let the women of the ward help out in any way.  He can be such a jerk. 

I know how this next part will sound to anyone reading this.  But it is the truth, and sometimes it drives me crazy, and I NEED to get it out.  Everyone in my family knows, but they're so accustomed to it that it doesn't faze them anymore, so they're not helpful.  Heck, my sisters come to me when they think they might be pregnant---they ask me before taking the test.  

I wonder why I knew this miscarriage was going to happen?  Why do I ever know these things?  Like with N's dad having an affair, and that Elizabeth Smart girl---why did I know?  Am I supposed to be doing something with this information?  If I had called the SLC police and said ""look, this is going to sound weird, but I just KNOW she was married off to a polygamist---and her dad may even know all about it""--would they have taken that seriously?  Of course not.  Or Laci Peterson----if I call and tell the police ""um, she's dead, but I don't know where she is"", will it help them find her?  No. If I had told TLJ that she was going to lose her baby at 4 months, would that have been a good thing?  Of course not.  If I had called DRF and said ""I know you're having an affair with that lady at work"" would he have said ""oh my gosh, you're totally right, I need to STOP, CONFESS, and REPENT""?  Of course not.  SO WHAT IS THE POINT?

I have appreciated this little ""gift"" in the past, because it has been very beneficial.  But these things are not about me--and I could use some knowledge of alot of things that are about me---why am I getting everyone else's life in my dreams?  I really would like to know what I'm supposed to DO with that information.  

And it's so random---it's not like any specific circumstance---I can just look at someone and KNOW something---I have known before my sisters and friends (most of the time) every time that they have been pregnant.  I have known about every miscarriage, and sometimes the sex of the child.  I have known VERY specific details of some of the children's births.  I had never even met my ex-boyfriend's girlfriend, and I dreamt that she was pregnant before either one of them knew about it.  In fact, I asked him, and he said no.  Then 3 weeks later, he told me she was.  Wanted to know how I knew.  Yeah, ""I dreamt it.  I always know"".  That'll go over.  I don't even have to dream about pregnancies anymore----it used to be I'd had three dreams in a row about something (including people dying) and I'd know for sure that it was real.  Then it was two dreams, then it just went to none.  I can just look at a person and TELL---even if they're not pregnant yet.  The pregnancy thing is so hammered into my psyche, that I never doubt it now.  The only time that a pregnancy dream hasn't come true, is when it was about me.  And that's happened many times.  I guess it could still happen, but I'm almost 37.  

Like I said, sometimes this serves me and my family very well, but for the most part, I reiterate:  WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO WITH THIS INFORMATION??"

I believe that this is necessary, it's something that needed to happen, no matter how much it sucks.  But it really, really, really SUCKS.  I hate that there is even a NEED for war to be considered.  Man's inhumanity to man is VERY hard for me to take, or even to understand.  I know how many people's hearts are being broken, how many wives are losing their husbands, children are losing their daddies, etc.etc.etc.  

On the political outlook, I believe this is bad.  People in other countries don't live the way we do--I understand that now that I've been around--and they don't understand the way we think.  They don't KNOW what we're fighting for.  Because they don't have it.  They just know the reasons they hate us. 

I think Bush is a good man, and has good intentions.  But he needs to address the people more---to consider them more---I think there are more people against this war than are for it, and he seems to have completely disregarded that.  I understand that this is ""necessary"", and he really doesn't have a choice.  But politically, that's not good for him, or for us, as Americans. 

It's scary, and it makes me want to throw up (literally-that's how it makes me feel).  When I saw the video of the people on the buses leaving Iraz, the women with their children, I broke down.  This is EXACTLY the kind of thing that MAKES me want to be ""numb""."

I think I do these things in an unconscious attempt to not FEEL.  I've been trying to avoid feeling my whole life, and I think this is another tactic.  Seeing those kinds of things kind of numbs you.  I have always understood the whole ""desensitizing"" concept, but I never really understood that it meant ""numbing""---I think I just assumed it was ""hardening"" so that you can take more without being affected, you know?  But I really think it's an avoidance issue.

"event","with my hubby again.  I don't understand what it is I'm doing to myself.  Why do my feelings sway back and forth so much?  This isn't anything new.  I remember at least for the last 3 or 4 years that this would happen, though not to this extent, and I would just pray for my love to return, and it would.  But why does it leave in the first place?  Maybe it's never really gone--maybe I'm afraid of it--afraid that HE will give up on me/die/leave---and so I'm protecting my heart--again.  I have worked so hard to overcome that tendency, and to just trust, but boy I sure did a good job of putting that wall up around my heart when I was 16.  I think because I was so hurt by the people I'd lost (my dad, my grandpa, my first love, my friend, my animals, all died within such a short period of time) that I just didn't want to feel anymore.  I even remember a girl that I'd hung out with at school before coming up to me in the hall one day and asking me why I never talked to anyone anymore.  I didn't even know I had stopped.  It was a subconscious decision, I guess.  
Heaven knows, I've put my honey through enough tests to prove his love for me---he has definitely proven it, at least logically, in my mind.  So maybe my heart's just a little behind.  See, I think when I type.  Maybe I've figured it out.  hmm"

DRC is only 2---it isn't like he can talk about it.  The other night when he was here, I could tell his discomfort when I mentioned D's name, and he's been acting ""funny"" lately, according to his mom (my sister).  Tonight, he was upset about going home when they came back to get him, and he started crying and came over to me, and wouldn't let go, and kept patting my back, and giving me these little kisses.  His mom laid him down to change his diaper, and D was telling me about the ""bathtub incident"" and he seemed hokey to me about it.  Then DRC was looking at him out of the corner of his eyes, with a VERY unkind/hurt/unhappy look on his face, then he'd look back at him mom, and the look would disappear.

How can exercise ever really be bad for you?  I am totally renewing my membership after this month.  It's so much easier to work out when I know it's THERE, versus at home, because at home, it's so easy to put off.  When I'm at the gym, everyone is working out, and it's inspiring.  It's the atmosphere--you know that's what you're there for.  And the walking machines are great.  It helps to keep up a good stride when the machine never slows down.

"event","but sometimes you just have to say what you need, right?  That's what my hubby tells me anyway. :)

See, when we started dating, I wasn't active in the church and hadn't been for many years.  He told me he was serious about me, but he couldn't be with someone who wasn't serious about the church.  And I was, I just hadn't gotten around to it.  So that was the push I needed, and I'm grateful for it, BUT

what I had to do in order to be serious, and serious enough to go to the temple, was to stop hanging out with people who partied for fun---and with the exception of my family, that was EVERY one of my friends.  So I was starting fresh.  And it went well for awhile, in spite of the differences I had with the other women (background, and gossip and all that), until the whole ""children"" thing came into play.  Everyone my age was having them, but I wasn't, and pretty soon, it was just too much for me.  I quit going to Relief Society, and didn't even want my visiting teachers coming over, because even they mostly talked about the ""kids"".  I had nothing to contribute and I felt like I didn't belong anywhere.  So I guess I isolated myself, and it just became clearer how much I DIDN'T have in common with them.  

Since we've been trying, my sisters and friends have had 18 children between them.  Not to mention all the children born every year in the ward.  And I think that's really my biggest thing.  If I were pregnant, or at least getting close to adopting, I think I would feel comfortable enough to hang around them---at least I could think of what I had to look forward to, instead of just thinking of what I don't.  And I think if I just don't participate in the gossip, and try to make it clear that I don't want to hear it, that aspect may be tolerable too.
People just don't get it---about women on this side of the fence--my sister-in-law was just talking about how this new baby (she's newly pregnant) was NOT planned, and pretty much was not welcome in her life right now---right in front of us.  My hubby said ""well, if you don't want it, we do"", and she just said ""oh, right"" and shut up.  This is her little girl that she has been wanting (or so she says), but it's not convenient for her.  *tiny violins*

I didn't get to work out today---I was psyched about it too.  But I woke up at 4 am this morning and couldn't go back to sleep, until about 7am, so I slept late, and I had alot to do.  I'm definitely going to make more time for it tomorrow.  I feel so much better when I get the exercise.  I actually got a membership at the gym for a month just to see how I like it.  They have a pool, but it's only for laps, so I may sign up for a membership at the aquatic center too.  Water aerobics or something.

I get anxious on Saturday, about Sunday, and it makes the insomnia monster even scarier and meaner.  Why does it have to start that early? I don't understand how families, especially MORMON families, can be ready for church that early.  Most of the families I know consist of 4 or more children.  HOW DO THEY DO IT???
There are only 2 wards in our building, because it's old and small, even though they recent built on to it.  We couldn't even get everyone into the Relief Society room, because there were too many women, and not enough chairs.  People were standing, or just leaving and going to another class.  They fixed that problem, but our ward is still too big.  It's like 550 people large, and it's a small building.  I wish they'd split the ward.  It would be nice to have a couple of key people in another ward than mine.  I don't understand why they don't like us.  They sold us this house, after it had been on the market for like 2 years, and they were just the two of them, an older couple who couldn't really even make it up the stairs, so they didn't need this house.  I know how you get attached, and how it's hard to leave and all, but that's not a reason to dislike the people who buy your house.  HE is civil and pleasant to us, but SHE is not.  She won't even look at me.  She asked for the curtains (if I didn't want them), and I really didn't care for them--I made my own--so I packed them all up nice and took them to her.  She was EVER so happy and nice.  But the next day at church she wouldn't look at me.  We take them the mail that we still get after 4 years, and they're short with us.  SHE came by one day, just to see the changes we had made, and I, loving the older generation as I do, let her come in and see OUR house.  She just kept saying ""this is exactly what we wanted to do"" over and over and over....Then once again, she will not look at me.  SHE and HE decided at the last moment to not include the acre next to the house in the sell of the house.  We disagreed of course, but they got around it, and we relented, thinking a little bit of land is not that big a deal.  They said they wanted it to build a house on.  LIARS.   The Owens clan, lovely ladies that they are, have told us many times since that they want that land to stay clear and open so that the people in the trailer park CAN WALK THROUGH IT.   Okay.  So they stole this land from us so that the patrons of the trailer park, WHO LIVE HERE ONLY IN THE SUMMER can walk through it.  AND, how dare we suggest putting up a fence around our yard.  NNNOOOO.  This makes Joy very upset.  This causes Joy to come to our yard three times a week with her big measuring tape, spend HOURS in our yard, and then call and tell us that the  specs are WRONG.  She owns those trees, blast it.  She planted them.  And her son built this house, and it was never supposed to leave the family.  And if you even think about touching the apple trees that are technically on THEIR land, you'll get a scorching scolding.  And yet, I watch, as year after year, the apples fall to the ground and go to waste.  

We did offer, a couple of years ago, to GIVE her (Queen Joy) the 5 or 6 feet of our backyard in exchange for the same amount on the side yard.  But she wouldn't have it.  Becaues those are HER trees.  The trees are gone now.  Dead.  And cut down.  And yet, she protests at our desire to put up a fence because her sewer lines are running through our yard, and she may have to get to them.  

Alright, so maybe I do understand why they don't like us.  1.  We own the house that Jack built, that should have been theirs.  2.  They stole the property next door, and they KNOW this, and so feel strange around us, because, as it should, it weighs on their collective conscience.   Oh, AND because I love animals and try to protect them and take care of them, she assumes that it is MY fault that skunks are carousing around in her trailer park, and (doing what?) I don't know--I think they're cute, and they never hurt me.  But she calls and leaves a scathing message (and writes same in letter form) about how WE are solely responsible for the skunk problem in her trailer park, and now she has had to put poison out to get rid of this problem, and has killed about 240 skunks so far BECAUSE OF US, BECAUSE WE HAVE CATS. (I never leave cat food out at night---skunks are NOT carnivores, and I wouldn't want them eating cat food, so I do not leave cat food out, but this is what she says I do).  The woman is insane, and I have reported her to PETA.  I hope she gets a BIG FAT fine, at the very least, for killing all of those sweet, innocent animals, and a few of the cats that I have cared for.  

How does a person get so high up on themselves that they think they have permission to kill God's creatures?  I can't sleep at night, and I DON'T do these things.  How do they sleep at night?"

"event","N's been coming home early, since he can't really be working on roofs in this weather.  He's like having a kid around.  Only worse, because he's got to know everything that's going on---at every moment---the what, why and how of every little thing I do.  We watched a couple of movies and just sat around tonight.  DRC and JKC were here for a few hours, and we're going to watch him tomorrow night while she works.  He's learning his present-tense verbs.  It's so cute.  Whenever he gets mad, or really serious about something, he yells ""EVER!"" .  Tee hee

I ordered some stuff from Burt's Bees and got it today.  So far, I'm really impressed.  I really like the toothpaste and the beeswax moisturizing cream.  Oh, and the blemish roll-on, which I have had a sample of, I really like.  

I'm psyched that ""The Ring"" is out Tuesday.  Finally a good, scary movie.  

I'm reading a book of my ancestors who came over from England in 1665 or thereabouts, and settled in Connecticut.  I just started it today, and so far, it's really great.  It's weird to think about that far back in time, and especially that these are the people from whose loins I sprung.  Weird.  I know my ancestors are mostly from England, Ireland and Scotland, and I know that history goes WAAAAYYY back, but it's just a weird feeling to put yourself in that picture.  So 350 years ago isn't so long in comparison, but it seems like forever to me.  

When we were in England, and particularly in Dover at the castle, I felt such an affinity to that place, it was like I could FEEL the history.  I wanted to stay there forever, and now I just want to go back.  Maybe studying my family's history will help me in that department.  

Our basement is leaking again---onto the new carpet.  We had to pull back the carpet and padding and sop up all the water in them, and on the floor.  N thinks it's coming from this big crack in the front porch somehow.  Sigh.  It seems like we're forever fixing this place.  

DWP is in Las Vegas this week.  I didn't even know he was going, nor do I know when he's coming back.  He and JJ are always running off to Vegas. I'm sure N would have loved to go.  He loves to go to the wind tunnel, and of course, all the rides.  He might go skiing tomorrow if he can find a friend to go.  He's going to Florida to do that race-car thing in a few weeks.  I'm kind of nervous about that, but he really wants to go--has for a long time.  I told him he should just go and get it overwith.  

I just don't like the thought of him flying without me.  (my fear of airplanes since I was 11)  If we're going to die in a plane, I just want it to be together.  I know, I'm paranoid.  I can't help it.  I still cringe whenever a plane flies over my house, and we're right in the flight path of our little airport, so it happens alot.  I get anxiety just seeing a plane on tv.  sheesh"

Around twilight last night, it was snowing lightly, and the wind was blowing just a breeze, and it was cloudy and dark---just how I like it.  So I decided to go for a walk, and N was home early, so I asked him to come with me.  He thought I was crazy.  I had to remind him that I am a child of winter, and this is the weather that makes me happy.  He went with me, but we ended up coming back earlier than I would have because he was freezing and not having a good time.

How do people who are so different end up getting married??

We have next-to-nothing in common. I know I'm weird.  But so is he, which is good, except that he's weird in different ways than me.  I guess that's not so weird. heh

I don't think we'll be dropping the charges against Eric.  The police told N that if we dropped the charges now, we could re-file them, but they probably wouldn't really be looked into the 2nd time, and also that any subsequent charges we filed against ANYONE may not be taken seriously.  This police force sucks.  That is so wrong.  We would be punished for trying to do something nice for someone who stole from us.  And yesterday, someone stole the $2000.00 generator we had parked at the speck house.  They cut the chain and carried it off.  Why do people steal from us?  We don't steal.  What happened to KARMA???

I think TLJ thinks I don't like her anymore.  I actually have never really liked her that much (personality wise).  But I love her, and she has been a good friend.  It's just that she's so judgmental, just like the rest of her family.  And also, like the rest of her family, she lies, exaggerates, manipulates, etc. etc.  I realize that she may not know she's doing this.  But it's so hard to take.  I was pretty short with her a couple of weeks ago when she asked me to baby-sit because she just changed the plan and didn't even ask me if it was alright.  She just said ""Saturday morning, 9 am?""  When we had already agreed on 11 am.  She knows I'm a chronic insomniac, and I don't do mornings.  I would have made an exception, had she ASKED.  But she didn't.  She just threw that in there, just like her parents would do, and it just reminded me so much of them that I couldn't take it.  It's manipulative, and borders on deceitful.  And it's so hard for me to be around her sometimes anyway, because all she does is talk about her kids and her husband, or gossip about other people, or complain about how her parents didn't educate her.  Ya know what?  You're a grown-up now.  Go to the library.  Hire a tutor.  Do something.  It's YOUR responsibility once you become an adult.  You're 26 years old, for Pete's sake.

But I know she's upset because she apparently had some problems over a week ago, and I found out today from my sister, who had heard it from my mom, who had seen TLJ at Wal-mart.  She told my mom, but she didn't tell me.  And she was upset when I didn't call her when I broke my foot.  So I know she's upset.  

I just don't know if I want to mend the rift.  I do for N's sake, because I know he loves to go hang with them.  I'm just so tired of it."

I don't know if, when you actually drop the charges on a complaint filed, if you can reinstate them anytime later.  I'm just not sure what to think of that.  HMmmm.  Dilemma.

I slept from 11 pm last night until 12 pm today.  I think that's the longest EVER.  Well, except for when I used to drink.  But I'm still tired.  I didn't go walking today either, because UPS came by Saturday while I was gone and left a notice for a package.  So I stayed home to wait for it, and it didn't come until 4pm.  

YUM----I found these great fragrances on Gothrosary.com.  They're very different--not like anything else I've had.  Really different scents, and they're all organic with no alcohol or chemicals.  Grooooovy.

N's driving home from the valley right now, and it's supposed to snow 9"" tonight.  I'm stressed about it, and he won't be home 'til about 11:00.  

Little Britches called last night, and they're going to Disneyland next week, and missing a week of school.  She's so adorable.  I am, of course, worried about the kids in a place like that.  Eeeek.  I worry too much.  They're going to the Renaissance Festival with us Saturday.  That'll be fun.  As long as N's dad, DRF doesn't find out about it, because he'll invite himself and spoil all the fun.  Just like he has about fittyeight times before.  He has decided that he's the bomb, and whoever doesn't let him be who he is and consider him just and spiritually great, is not worthy of his attention.  He admitted to MMF a couple of weeks ago that he has a girlfriend, and this in spite of many former denials.  He even participated in ARJ's confirmation---knowing of course, I assume, that he should not.  He also went to MMF's wedding IN THE TEMPLE while he was still living with JF and seeing this other woman.  I am so glad we were on vacation and didn't have to go to that, because I don't think I could have kept my big mouth shut.

He's out on bail now, and has come back, sorrowful, and pleading for another chance.  Of course, we want to believe in him, but what kind of message will that send to the other employees?  

So, a punishment, perhaps?  A pay-cut, of course, restricted access to supplies, and absolutely no charging priviledges, as well as a significant demotion?  

That's probably what we'll end up doing---assuming he doesn't go to jail.

"event","It was so great.  I walked the trail 3 or 4 times, and did a little jogging.  I definitely am going to be doing that more often.  If you go at the right time, then there's no crowd.    The birds were singing and the squirrels were playing everywhere, and it smelled great because of the rain.  

Thursday night, I took a walk up to the cemetery.  As I passed by the Owen's house, I glanced over at it (about 100 yards away) and just kept walking.  I had to walk around the fence because I didn't want to jump it into the cemetery (respect and all), when I noticed that two teenaged boys were hanging around the other side of the fence, watching me, and generally checking out the area where I had just walked.  I was in the cemetery then, and just thinking ""if they try anything, I'll just kick their **** because I was really in no mood for anyone's crap.  It was raining, and it was really nice.  Then I turned around and noticed a teenage girl behind me, just standing there at the cemetery entrance, watching me.  It occured to me then that Carolyn, the hag that she is, had sent her children to check on what I was doing--walking around in the cemetery---I suppose because I had to pass through ""her"" trailer park.  Within a few minutes she pulled up in her car on the other side of the fence, and her daughter went running over, asked permission to hop the fence, and getting it, did, and they all drove off happily together, assuming everything was alright afterall.  I cannot imagine having nothing better to do on a beautiful Thursday evening than to send your children chasing after someone like me.  I had the desire to call her when I got home, but thought better of it.  I told N that I should get out my long black hooded cape and grab a candle, and go walking through the cemetery for a few nights, in front of her house, just to let her really get her jollies.  Meh.  Is she really worth the effort?  

I wasn't in such a grand state of mind, anyway, having had a recent disagreement or two with my better half.  I was seriously considering my options, and planning for a very near future of living alone again.  I was even pondering my next boyfriend.  Hmm.  
So Friday, Valentine's Day comes, and he, (my better half) comes home late with a dozen roses, (6 white ""because they're my favorite"", and 6 a salmon color ""because they're a cool color""), a large box of chocolates, and the absolute sweetest card you can possibly imagine.  And the sweet part was NOT what was printed on the card by the card-maker.  It was what he wrote.  It was practically poetry, and something I desperately needed to hear, and in my stupor, I melted.  So the plans have been waylaid--once again.

I often wonder if I am, in fact, two separate people.  Is it possible that I can feel SO incredibly strong about something and then in a moment's time, feel so incredibly strong about the absolute opposite?  And it takes such a small shove in either direction sometimes, that I become unsure of who I actually am.  Really, I scare myself sometimes."

I'd put one of those collars that doesn't have a peg and hole closure--you just put it in one side and out the other---and she kept pulling on it, trying to get it off, and tightened it so much that she could barely breathe.  I saw her in the morning, not being able to eat, but I figured she had a hairball.  Then I didn't see her all day, and I was worried about her, so I finally found her lying in the window, and noticed this huge lump under her chin/neck, and her collar was choking her.  I had to have mom hold her down while I cut it off, and it wasn't easy.  Poor baby.  No wonder I'm not a mom--I'd probably kill my kids.  She's been so lovey-dovey ever since.

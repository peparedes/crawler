"event","This year  is completely amazing so far. The parade was a blast. Weather has been amazing. Things are back to the usual times with folk I see everyday and have never been better. In a month I might be taking one of the first crossroad paths in my life and planning on enjoying every second of it and in return I get to come closer to what I want in life. Man this is gonna be a sweet year. I also plan on patching up things with an great friend I havent seen in some time. 



Predicitions for the rest of 2008:

- I will be ""nuts about you""
-Country might be the next love of my life
-I think I might find faith and reason (thats a shocker)
-People who complain too much will have the worst year ever
-There will be alot more fun drunken nights at Michaels
- I might make my parents proud of me (another shocker)
- I wil miss alot of people 


p.s.- This is to steph, I'm nuts about you!!

I was doing this and also spent some time reading up on canidates and watching videos up on ABC news. I'm liking John Edwards more and more by the minute. I hope he remains strong. He seems like the most stand up guy out there, his stances on issuses are the most sensible. also, he's done an incredible amount while facing critical times in his life.

Today, throughout the stuff I was doing and right here and now I've been taking a moment to reflect on my life and understanding a little more about myself that I feel to see and feel from time to time. I feel more mature about my life. I feel like its what gives me the edge sometimes. I think this what seperates me from everybody else. I think its whats going to make me successful in life. Its like learning from your mistakes except this times there are none. This time there are just a group of pathways and crossroads down at your feet. The ones traveled are hopefully mapped out through exmaination of how well you know yourself. Its the power you have to make the opprutunities endless and make your life worth wild. This way you look back and say, ""I did this, not regreting a single action and completely happy I did so."" This year has been great and to tell you the truth for the most part I havent lived this way and thats why I sit here regreting alot of the decions. They arent the most obvious if you know me but they are the subtle choices that took life out of my hands and into my peers. It was if ""jury of your peers"" casted every sentence and dictated every move you made. I'm really happy now that I am above that. I wsh I could go back though and do some differently. If that were to happen though than this wouldn't be life. This would be a game where we are already holding on the cards and cashing the jackpot with every choice in our life. I think a more justifing out look is instead of being judge God on your judgement day, I think people should look back when they die and be judge by ourselves and see if we met our expectations,recieved everything we deserved,match up to the respect of our neighbors, and if all we accomplished was brought out in the prosperity of ourselves and really worked to what we achieved"

I was trying to wonder why I always take care of my shit and put stuff back in place, but stuff is always the things getting fucked with. I also realized tha everyday when I come in I clean the downstairs and trying to figure out how people get it so messy. I'm just like damn.

I also have Alpha Dog on now and this is complete madnes.. Whoever though Just Timberlake could be such a bad ass? I mean, wasnt he in n'sync? This movie kind of reminds me of the kids from florida who killed one of thier friends and got a whole bunch of people in on it and wound up all serving extra hard time. It was based on a true story also. I wish I knew the name now. I think it had Sean Hunter in it.

I forgot to turn of my light before I went to bed last night so it was like a sort of stunning feeling when I opened my eyes. I had a dream last night of everybody turning thier backs on me, being kicked out of my house, and living on the street. It was really wierd. I think this might have been the wierdest dream I have ever had.

I been watching mostly the news, music videos, and sports highlights since I woke up. I think the news might be the funniest thing broadcasted over television ever. The stories that stuck out the most to me are: the  MLB steriod report, Beanie Siegel changing his ways to send anti-violence messages across the city,Joey Vento (owner of Geno's Seaks) being fined and orded to go to court for having the famous sticked ""this america, order in english,"" and also Hillary Clinton stooping as low as she could go against Sen. Obama. I'm guessing from what I view that these are the most notable problems and stories going on around the country. It amazes me. I can't imagine how we are viewed be countries around the world, can you sense the sarcasm?

After, we met up with Coof and some road runners for karaoke night at some bar. I got chumped for being 19 at the bar. Me and Bill then sung a little frank sinatra, I was also suppose to sing its raining men but Bill had to for me. We then met back up with Jen and Courtney and were all goofy.

There were a lot firsts, passes 2006 by far. Although, I have a really high expectations for  2008. I think its going to be the year that makes or breaks or me. A lot of things are going to be put to rest. Im starting to take some of the skeletons of out of my closet. I'm not totally sure yet if I'm just making room for some coming soon or locking the door and throwing away the key forever. The only thing I can say for now is that is that as of now the foundation is layed down and there is no turning back anymore 

On a better note, this weekend this was in insane. I got to see polar bears battle to death. A wanderer runing from the cops. Getting drunk on the sub and fucking around. We got a new collection of fun accesories. Hungout with a few bikers in a bar. I had the most delicious cheese fries at 3:30 am and didnt know until last night how much cheese I really needed for them. I also learned that Marlboro Reds are just disgusting. After, halfway through previews of a movie,long fights at a diner table the next night,then finally arriving home I realized what being just friends means. Also, how to actually still love a person but not too sure how I started loving this person. When I look back now on how I was then and how I am now is radically different, its kinda scary.

It seems like each day passes by with me finding another piece to the puzzle. Each day is just another a step closer into putting myself straight. Another day to get myself normal. I spend each day as just a learning lesson and not a chance to break free and see whats out there. Putting on a fake smile and a nice chuckle, this way anybody doesnt ask whats wrong. I wish sometime I could travel, leave everything behind, and not care. Find a distant land where nobody knows who I am. Start over, a clean slate. Right all the wrongs I ever did. Keep up with the things I use. Meet all these expectations that were drawn out to me. Make the best of every situation, not sleeping on it and wishing: I could have done this,said this, acted this way, gave this look instead of that look, gave this suggestion instead of asking this question. I wish I could use my jokes and sarcasm to make people instead of just trying to fill this emptiness. I wish I listend to things wise men said to me instead of learning my own mistakes. 

I dream that one day I'll wake up middle aged and happy. A wife, two kids, good job, nice house: The American Dream. Sometimes I dream that I was this random guy who just flows elgantly down the street with the cares of worl breezing off of his chest because he has his piece of the pie and nothing can break him down. Then, I think to myself and realized I was this guy not to long ago and it was taken away from me. It was taken because I was too worried what those wise men had to say and closed myself from the world so I could hold in trust close to me as possible and not give in damn. I didn't know what I was doing was wrong untill I found in myself that I'm just the monster bringing down myself. I curse god for giving me such an easy, self councious mind and not keeping me from wearing my feeling on my sleeves. 

I hope things dont go back to these ways, and then one day I'll live the way I want to and take advantages of life with the some attributes I have. I think tonight, the past few night, I wound somebody that I'm not afraid to be myself around and to know what its like to just be care free and handle my business and by myself. Im just scared to put myself completely out there because I'm afraid of being totally hurt and lloking like a smacked ass. I'm worried that if I screw this up then what can I turn to.

I'm also trying to take my school seriously, trying to act more maturer and caring about a lot more. 

A couple weeks ago I was drunk and locked out of my house and I went on adventure to kill sometime before getting my dad up. I walked form my hosue to market stret and then back and then through pack park. I realized that my life is just about over, pr the better part that is. In about 6 years roughly, I'll be out of school and starting my profession. I will be close to getting married with the love of my life. I'm going to start my family and live in my own house. I'm gonna witness some people leave me. I'm gonna remain tight to my family and the friends I have. 

One of the few things that scare me about this is that I wake up everyday and realize that my days seem like they are getting alot shorter. The day just breeze by. It feels as if time just is stuck in fast forward. I think that in the feeling of 10 years passing I'll already be lying in my death bed and ready to see the other side.

Tonight, hung out on the corner and then took the not senic/unusual route to this kids house to ditch this older guy who is all fieding for marijuana that we dont want to do with and some black bause called my friend fat and he had it and got into a rumble with them and was extremely out numbered and i was stuck in the middle of the street frozen and with no clue hwot to react and ran into his cousins house trying to find his cousin. Then after that all cleared up went over to a party with that boy Sean was at which was awesome and some chick form 267 that knows me some how. Then I got played by the girl preiously stated when she said she would meet me on my corner and had me chilling there for an hour before I finally got back in touch with her again and some dude on her chirp was talking to me.

P.s. - The opposite ends of both of my lips are busted, my jawn feels liek it about to snap off, i feel like a pussy, and i dont know whats going on anymore"

I think that I have no reason to be here which I thought I ha long ago and also thanks to Mr. Kurt Vonnegut and my brother I never really felt so worthless and shitty ain all of my life. Thats all I have to say for now I need to hurry up and get my ass out of here and go running so I can gain a little dignity I have left and try and start getting in shape. That is all."

I've been thinking alot lately and realized that I have barely if any notible attributes. Then in the midst of all my thinking I figured out my plan in life. Its that I fit perfectly into the service. Thats why by this time next year I'll be enlisted into the United States Marine Corps. I want to join sooner but I'm waiting for one of my best friends to finish school and joining with him. I dont have any problems with it at all, and has literally the world to give to me. If worst comes to worst, I'll die but I'll be getting a full paid burial with a free flag, and the honor of dieing for this twisted corrupted country. Also  the money from serving will be given to my parents. So thier really isnt that much to worry about just hope the after life is pleasant because I'm not really that afraid of dying. Also, I think once I get out I'm probably going to be an EMT or go to school to try and become a doctor. Then I really want to record and screw around with music as a hobby and while in the coprs I want to learn martial arts.  I really like the way that life sounds. Its just me."

"event","Coming in from a nice weekend with the thought of two parties for the next two days, feels really good. Listening to a song that captures your thoughts and expectencies for the past couple months it a hundred times, especially when this your favorite band already. If anybody wants a listen and can find it its called good news by Westbound Train. That band is so amazing.

So anyways tonight was really dead and boring. I feel so apathetic right now its ridiculous but I'm also so chipper and thoughtful now. I feel as if my dreams and the things i need and want so badly are right in my grasp with just a little working. I love my life and hate it at the same time. I'll always love you though


Peace,

Durring late Saturday night I was in my friends room and we were smoking a couple blunts and listening to The Skatalites and they were just one reallly great band. Burring a couple songs I could just picture them just sitting around and making up these songs. They have this really neat song called Simmerdown and it just reminds me of and ending of a really good summer night involved with some booze and some good times and all that really nice stuff. Also while listening to these guys I just want to setup a nice old fashioned ska band and get blasted one night and come up with the some tunes and let the people orgasm on the dance floor the way I've done so many times"

"event","Last night/this morning I had this dream where my whole family went somewhere with out me and left the house to me and I had the craziest party ever. There was dropkick murphys pumpin through the speakers, all of my friends that I ever knew was there, not the least bit of drama and vlad and back and tan stacked to hill. It was to put in simpler terms the fucking place to be. Like out of all the dreams this def. the one that like I just wish I could come true for once. I think that has to be one of things I just want more than anything,all of my friend i ever had with a bunch of alcohol and everybody just getting together having the time of thier lives in front of eyes with everybody problems and worries at the door. Like that and I think just nice gilfriend or just a chick to have and spend and endless amount of time and just have good times all around would make my life complete. I guess like what my mom said and probably countless outher people ""you can't always get what you want"" is just the way is right. 

After reading those lines I dont want to put you into the assumption that I'm bummed out at all becasue I think today is the only good day I've had all week and I feel like I'm on top of the world. I've been reading alot lately all over through myspace people saying that like my friends are the greatest and all and I just think that when my friends think of me cause I sure as hell think of everybody I know when that goes through my head. I also think thing that is just all I have to say.

-Peace
P.s.- I think I finally ended all of my self diagnosed depression and exteme anxiets. And if anybody wants to throw a enormous party with just an enormous amount of amazing people or can find an or is an awesome chick and would just want to do crazy stuff all the time and be complepetly awesome together please let me know, cause i'm trying my hardest to end this search."

Another pretty sweet thing is that my house is stocked with all kinds of nice and healthy food for once, I also talked to caufarri at lunch today and me and him are gonna start lifiting so I'm finally on the right track. ANother deal that is pretty sweet is I'm finally comitted to stay completely off drugs for once and go do everything it takes and stay strong and not give. The only exception is beer and alcohol cause you can never go wrong with those guys. To who ever reads this Flogging Molly is playing on Valentine's Day so like if I dont have a date or anything anybody wanna be my date and go with me? Thats all I have to say for now, I hope you have a good day!! :D ceacuase I sure will."

"event","I think that Sunday's might be my new favorite day. Thier verry chilled out and lay bak and not really to much to worry about. Also fills you with expectations for the week to come. For me its one the days where I can just spend the whole day getting one simple thing done and gan drag it out for so long and have nothign to worry about.

Another thing I like about today I'm just waking up and listening to Westboud Train, they are so descent. I wish I was a verry ""soul"" filled person. Also I just wish I could be living life without some of the worries that are always mind. Since I havent come up with a new year's resolution, that just might be it. I'm gonna live everyday like a Sunday

"event","I feel like my life is a movie when I listen to indie rock. 

There are alot of things I've been thinking about lately that have been needed to change along with appying to college and. I want to apply to some colleges that are far away and I want to get out of this city just to prove to people to people I can make it on my own and to show that I'm not like everybody else. I was thinking of applying to univerisity of wisconsin, uni of pitt, and some college up in boston but I really dont want to loose my friends that I have because I seriously think nothig can replace the times they provided and all. I also think that if I go away I wont find any friends and hate it. I also fear that when I do come back when I get out of college or come back durring breaks and all I want have ever the kind of bonds I have with them now. I'm just so split on the decision. Its so tough.

On a different note. If anybody checks this journal I highly suggest you listen to OKGO, they are really good. Some of thier songs are a little too inide for me and too experimental but some of them are sweet. Thay also have a few pop punky songs which are really good. I enjoy em alot and I know alot of you will. Thats all for now that I have to say. Have a good day"

Do you remember the cartoon show Doug and how the mayor would hand out lollipops saying sucker? That came to my mind cause I think I really am the worlds biggest sucker, and  I'm just really fucking tired of it. I wish I were cooler and crap. Its kind of an awakening again. I just cant wait to get out of school and off this week. I need to get black out drunk or soemthing I dont even care anymore. I really dont even care about anything anymore. I wish I could take a backpack and my bike and just be off and not have to worry about anything anymore

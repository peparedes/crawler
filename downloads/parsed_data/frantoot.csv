so then my dad went to a funeral.. his drummer wayne had his mom recently past away, i met her she was really nice.. and proud of her son =( may she rest in peace. so when my dad came back from the funeral we picked up my mom and drove to china town!! really stresses when driving especially when you have crazy ppl drive really fast in the oldest and 1st freeway here in LA... so then we ate, and i drove on the way back really stressed... oh and the night before i drove to tita tisay's house and back she lived all the way at ANAHIEM HILLS(really far)

hey i promised you a story about my camping trip right?? =) hehe well here is goes

friday night we left to my aunty claribel's house cuz tht's where we were gonna meet.. we rented an RV, it was great cuz i jst slept really comfy along the way. we left at around 2:30 in the morning and arrived at needles at 6:30 in the morning... it was fun, the whole day was nothing but swimming in the freezing water, and riding jet-skies all day long. the water was freezing because of the effect of the heat there, the temperature reached abotu 103 degrees.. it was crazy i got a sick ass tan. my parents friends were there and so was NIKKI!! a daughter of my parents friends.. things got a lil weird cuz of my lil ""history"" w/her which was really stupid because she over acted on somthing tht occured between us... and what made it really awkward was tht her BOYFriend was there... and damn, i look at least 100x better than him.. feel sad for her, she nevr gave me a chance... =( but it doesnt matter anymore, i met a new person =). so nywys on our way home we had to stop by the dumping site where RV's would dump the SHIT out of the RV's lil septic tank(really gross).... HAHAHA it was hilarious, cuz my parents and their friends didnt kno where to dump ""the SHIT"" lol hahaha.. and we ended up dumping the shit in the wrong whole... and the whole we dumped it into, well, we have no idea what tht whole was... so we jst moved the RV to the whole on the other side... it was crazy and GROSS..... but it was really funny and memorable!! =) so thts my story when we went camping, if its a lil boring sorry, cuz my sleepy na.  =) nyt"

today was sad.... my friend she told me tht she is getting a divorce w/ her husband. and it got me thinkin tht i might of been the cause because of a long and complex STORY!!! (dnt ya jst hate those?) she mentioned about how i was involve in the argument that she had w/ her husband, but it wouldnt make any sense... the only thing tht i did was offer to help her baby-sit her two babies... i jst feel tht their could be something for me to do but i cant because she said tht her husband might hold it against her during there divorce.... i jst feel sad for her =(, not only is she getting a divorce, she's taking care of to two babies and she doesnt have a job... she's what i would LOVE to call a house wife, jst staying at home and taking care of kids.. kind of lik an ideal family, but w/ out the divorce thingy well i gott rest now journal cuz i got work 2mrw and i dnt wanna pass out lik i did last week.... tht day was crazy!!! my boss Tim lectured me about how their were two customers who walked in and, how the register was right there and someone could of taken money.... so nyty nyt nyt journal!!! =)"

my dad is pissd at me because i supposedly thought i was ""yelling at him.."" its not my fault he's half deaf because of his MUSIC..... c there are many things y i dnt wanna be a musician, and trust me, i kno.... my dad is one of them, even though they may be very attractive to ppl because of there talent. Musicians have the most chaotic and crazy life, which suxs especially when tht musician has a family to support. This entre may seem to be a negative statement to my dad but...I STILL LOVE MY PAPA!!! =)  so nywys ya he asked me the same question twice, the 1st time i answered and he culdnt here me, so he askd me again.. so i raised my voice a lil higher so he can here me, and tht's when SHIT broke loose, he got mad at me because he thought tht i was disrespecting him.... and he went on and on.... so then i jst ignored him... so now i dnt talk to him and he doesnt talk to me... but its ok... he needs me more than i need him... =/ sad but true... so since he's pissed, he took away the lap-top, so now im being forced to use the ghetto library computers.... =,( y, oh y dont you librarians get a new keyboard for the damn computer.... m gonna stop now cuz im starting to get arthritis from this DAMN keyboard... later

yes tht girl i was talkn about....the one tht i was kick moi self in the butt, welll i saw her 2day... n i was lik AMAZED..but this time i didnt hesitate to ask her number!!!! lol so nywys this is crazy, i jst said to my self on my way over tht if its ment to be.. then im gonna see this girl sooner of later..lol  and so i DID!!!! lol YES YES>... m so happy i feel lik a billion/trillion bucks, which i am worth.. hahaha yup... 

so nywys today was the last day of summer school, and i said bye to the girls tht i would talk to all the time i was there during... there names were Denise and Marwa. they were nice... but UGGLY... sry but the truth does hurt..=( feel sad for them.... ya kno the girls from RAMONA highschool are not tht cute... only maybe a few here and there but not tht many..=/ ehhh.... so nywys after school i was doin my usual routine talk in to denise and marwa... until my bus would arrive n then i jst runn lik crazy to catch the bus.. but its alryt cuz i kno the bus driver.. his name is RALPH...hahahah (i seriously need a car) he's cool he drops me off anywhere i wanna get off and created a bus-stop for me... its the corner closest to JAMBA JUICE. i lik jamba juice, its not really a smoothie place its mor lik a fruit juice thing.. hard to explain i got into deep thought about the difference between juice...shakes..and smoothies..... EY IT WAS ONLY THT ONE WEEK BCUZ I WAS STARTING MY SMOOTHIE STAND AT SCHOOL. nywys i got my drive from my usual juice spot, n i took the bus goin home, and then along the way goin home. I GOT HUNGRY and i was craving for SIZZLING RICE SOUP..... HOLY MOTHER OF GOD tht soup is great. so then i ended up walkn about 7 blocks jst to get $20 out of the darn bank jst to eat my FAVORITe soup. and when i got at the place (wang's palace along myrtle in monrovia) ppl were all lookn at me cuz i had my back pack on and i was by myself =(..... n it feels great to spend money tht you earned ya kno.... not having to rely on your parents MULA... to do something you want. =) so i payed my bill and i was off to go home.... but then i missed my bus goin to the place tht would bring me to my house.. so i said.."".... damn it's to hott to walk home.."" so i jst watched a movie (i robot). it was interesting, it fits w/ the similar story line of terminator and the matrix. after the movie, i was waiting outside for my mom to pick me up... and you'll never guess who i saw.... i saw the ""el pollo loco girl"" as how my friend MARICRIS would call her!!!! >=( lol..... but its funny the wy maricris say's it. so back to what i ws talkn about.... ya so i saw the el pollo loco girl and i asked for a hug, and she gave it too me... and OHHH shanxus!!!! boy did i miss her... i jst wanted to see her another time...  and this time i asked for her number!!!!! YES.... whata gracious SCORE!! =)so m thinkn i could take her out to a movie say mayb monday before she goes on her trip, and i'll have her try my FAVORITE DISH!!! =) so tht was my exciting day..... being independent, now my next step is to take my PERMIT TST AND PASS... DAMN I GOTT FOCUS AND READ THE BOOK!!!!!!

nywys journal..this nikki girl is the daughter of my mom's friend, she's about 3 years older thn me, but the funny thing was tht i think she used to lik me?? until i actually talkd to her and she later found tht i was 3yrs younger than her...(many ppl think tht i look old) and then all of a sudden she gave me ""THE"" cold shoulder.... after tht i found her as a turn off bye the way she was acting.. bery childish...i dnt lik childish ppl its really a nuisance and i jst wanna slap them to get there mind straightened out..ya kno?? so back to the camping thing.... my parents and there friends are gonna split the expenses of renting an RV and its crazy cuz the RV is lik the size of the one they use in ROAD RULES!!! alryt ROAD TRIPPP!!! hahahaha... but w/ old ppl =/, but its cool i enjoy hangin w/ my parents friends, so full of life and experiences. =).....ok ok sry, back to the camping thing, so were gonna sleep over there for two nights friday night/morning cuz thts when we arrive there, and saturday night..... i love jet skiing, it fun and i LOVE IT... its lik riding a motorcycle except on water....hahahha (interesting??)

"event","hey journal,
i kno its late, but jst wanna clear my mind before the new coming week starts. i just wanted to say tht, ppl in general are confusing and complicated, and so are relationships. ppl in general are lazy and they most likely refuse to use there minds of thinking for themselves. you kno... its amuses me how one person can affect another just by the simple words that come out of there mouth.  jst think about it, there jst words right?? but what really hurts us or gets us thinking and acting with our emotions is when the words they use add a whole lot of meaning. its lik that saying... ""sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me..."" that saying is BULLSHIT, you can only use those words in defense if your against a person you dnt really care about. but using them towards a person you hav an interest in?? boy, did you jst dig yourself a big ass emotional HOLE!! nywys journal, i kno i had a lot of entree's today but i had fun, because i found all of those interesting things that would identify yourself... =)
  nywys journal, i alwys wonder why God made things so complicated?? why we are here in earth?? why life is....well, life?? and why life is full of ups and downs?? i alwys think about those things even though many my age never even thought about it.  most of the ppl my age are all thinking about how there gonna get laid, or how am i gonna talk to this girl, or jst basically trying to figure out how to deal with relationships and how to succeed in them... im somewhat the opposite, i dnt really care much for relationships, i jst care much for the ones who made me who i am today, and how i am who i am.  im alwys thinking about being a kid again, jst; eat, sleep, watch cartoons, and jst play with toys.... im now at the age when you have to be respnsible for yourself (which i lik), but at the same time, i dnt wanna deal with the problems tht ppl have.... now i completely understand why life as a young-adult is tough.. it is the age when we miss being a kid, it is the age when we wanna try the experience of sex, and it is the age when we want to explore new things.... and it is the age of the point of no return, the time when your parnets will not be there for you all the time, compared to 10 years ago when a problem would come about, you can jst say ""..MAMA..."" or""...PAPA...."" at the top of your lungs and let them handle the problem. now things are different your parents are no longer your teacher in life, because you already learned about it and is experiencing it day to day... i remember when i was little that all you would do is jst stay at home with the baby sitter, or if not you would be in the day care to play with toys and meet friends.... and now were goin out, making decision on our own, but with the approval of our parents... if i seem to have lots you journal, its okay.... this jst shows how life is complicated... nywys journal its really late, and i have school 2morrow, on top of tht, i have a test, and my homework is due.... i didnt even do it!! oh well, nyt journal"

i think its been months now since the lst time i wrote to ya. anywys summer is starting, so is summer school, and i have a summer job. its fun and everything but i wish i could work for more hours. so to day was a fun day, cuz at work it got busy at the end from all the students that needed there gear for there dives. btw i work at a dive shop. you kno what i miss, being with my cousins and relatives. i find my family a little weird mostly because of its structure or maybe its jst me?? i always thought of my mom as an older sister, my dad as a grandfather, and my lil sis as my daughter. i alwys feel that im being watched all the time and i sometimes feel very uncomfffy... on both my parents side they have a cool history, and my mom alwys tells me stories about them, but my dad isnt much of a story type of guy. for me my dad is lik a weird mystery, is if i dnt even kno him... i kno tht he loves me and all but he seems lik he's spaced out. im alwys interested when learning about my dad's history of life style before he had me and my sis. its either that or its part of the personality of being a musician. evry1 tht i talk to tht my dad has performed for alwys told me tht im a lucky kid because of my dad and his GREAT TALENTS IN MUSIC as a piano player. but i alwys thought of it as just another ordinary kind of thing. i find tht my life is a big mystery as if there something missing, lik as if my life is incomplete.... well nyt journal ill try to write back soon, besides i got to get some rest for summer school and my job.... (NOTE: workin at DOLPHIN DIVE CENTER.... takn geometry 4 summer)"

some ppl can be really stupid.... lik literally. Even if they are book smart they can still be very stupid. My problem is that, i hav a ""frend"" n she goes to la salle, i got her tickets to my bosco dance and she nevr paid me back. Not only did she not pay me back, she made a big deal about something so stupid and placed guilt on herself for no reason. I just wanna let this out cuz its soooo stupid that at the same time it is sooo fukn funny. But anywys, school s a biach, i hate it when they teach ya subjects tht ya aint interested in... so fukn boring n ya end up failing. Yup, tht's whats happenin to me, so far i got to retake GEOMETRY cuz my teacher cant teach the subject for SHIT!!!!! =( n i hav project deadlines for construction, problems to solve for the business club, and issues to deal w/ in the tennis team. And on top of all, i need my music for piano form the band leader n im jst gettin so fukn restless w/ evrything thats arond me. Hope ya understand journal, ppl can b so stupid that it either hilarious or just plain out said... what pisses me off is when they're BOTH. Anywys hopefully the rest of the year will turn out ryt maybe it would turn around after my birthday on the 30th?? hopefully......

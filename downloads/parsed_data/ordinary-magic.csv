"event","Moon's at perigee tonight -  it will be about 14 percent wider and 30 percent brighter than lesser full moons of the year. As a bonus, Mars will be just to the left of the moon tonight. Look for the reddish, star-like object.

According to Native American lore, the first full moon of the year is the Wolf Moon, so named because of the hungry wolves who would cry out to it during the long winter's night. Each full moon in the year is named for a different animal.

Even with the naked eye, the view will be spectacular.  So, for those keeping score at home, we closed out 2009 with a Blue Moon, and open 2010 with full moon at perigee. Yes, I'm a nerd because I think this is awesome."

The labour issues with The Witching Hour have been resolved.  Professor Snape, Miss Granger and the others returned to the bargaining table and we brokered an arrangement: I do whatever they tell me to do.  That said, things will be a little confusing for the next two updates.

The new chapter is actually in the beginning as the prologue here:  http://owl.tauri.org/stories.php?sid=6685

The next update later today will be chapter seven.   Some skipping around will be the order of the day.  Sorry.
Ash and FFnet should be updated with the new chapters sometime later tonight after work.

"event","SUPER FUNNY STORY FOR GIRLS.

Today i went to jays aunts house out in warren with Rita(jays mom) addison (jays neice) and jays aunt and of course Phoenix. Rita left all of us at Eileens house to go get grandpa and aunt barbie (jays aunt w/ down syndrom so she lives with grandpa). so i had to go change my tampon and i asked addison if she had to go to the bathroom b/c were trying to potty train her (shes almost 3), and she says yes. 

so I assume she'll go first and then i can do what i gotta do, and she says ""you go first"" so i grab some kleenex and i get rid of the old and put her up to do hers. and i was trying to go fast so i didnt have to explain to her what i was doing but i couldnt relax rusing myself so i couldnt get it in, and she gets off and sees me and says.... ""that goes in your butt?"" 

ha. silly girl!"

Whose smart idea was it to make everyone where MASK and have to be 21 and up? If you cant see someones face then you cant tell how old they are.

ANYWAY, I dressed up like a bat and I wore this black skirt and black shirt right? well i had to search for bat wings and take Phoenix with me so i had to lug around her car seat and hold my skirt down while the wind blew. It sucks.

anyway show was kinda sucky they only got to play 3 songs b/c this other guy was being a dick and right when Big Fat Kill played their last song the cops showed up and made the music stop. Ha so much for your band not getting ""cut short"" DICK HEAD! HA!

Then we left b/c the party blewwwwwwwwwww and we went to tgi fridays which made me sick. we wont go back there again. And then we picked up our baby girl from Kristies house and came home.

Moral of the story:

I NEED a baby backpack thing a ma jig.

And you know its funny b/c I finally got away from Phoenix for a while and all I did was talk about her and show off pictures of her and think about her. I really love her."

See at about 9:30 pm i had this super weird feeling in my stomach like the inside was contracting but the outside was normal. For those of you that dont know a contraction is basically a ""ontraction"" in a girls area(no mention of the parts for grossed out people) and what it does is it tightens your stomach. 
But last night didnt feel much like a ""contraction"" it just felt funky. Then I got sick at about 11:30 which is a very common thing for labor. Thats why most doctors dont let you eat anything except clear liquids such as juice, chicken broth, and jello.

"event","I'm like freakin out cause I dont have a my dresser or changing table yet. I'm not worried that it wont be here in time or anything, I just HAVE to clean, I HAVE to organize. I HAVE TO BUILD MY NEST. 

I have no clue when my changing table will come in since Jennie got it for me and I think they ordered it on the day of the baby shower. And it takes 1 to 2 weeks to come in the mail. Nothing like a last minute preasent huh?

I've had a total of four contractions in the last 3 days. and Nesting normally happens like a week or 2 before labor, so im close, and then I'm having a beer and some sort of mixed drink. I deserve it. yeah right.

gotta go for like a twelve hour jog or something. byeeee"

well i wont update often cause i dont use the computer often but you'll love it when i do.

Baby shower was sunday, Success if i may say so myself. It was very beautiful and like a million people were there cause were super popular ;)

nesting sucks. I really do feel like a bird trying to make something of nothing. I wish i could put everything in its proper place but nothing has a proper place. I dont even have that damn dresser yet, or my changing table.

I swear if this baby doesnt come tomorrow im just going to start pushing until she finally comes out. Im ready! I had a dream of holding her last night, she was wearing a little purple shirt and i just remember how little her wrinkly hands were. cant wait to kiss all over her.


oh and its offical i'm going to bring her home in the outfit my mom brought me home in, she gave it to me at the shower along with a note that made me cry in front of everyone. And shes going to wear DANIELLES shoes her mom gave me from when she was a baby b/c they are super cute and match the dress and are to fancy smancy for anything else.

28 days till due date and counting!"

"event","So I finally watched the 40 year old virgin last night... whew... my face hurt from laughing so much!!! ""Mantastic"" is definitly my new word... 

My husband is mantastic... strip clubs are mantastic... Hummm.. .I wonder if I am using that word right? He he I don't care... I'm going to have to watch it again just to memorize more funny stuff!!!

Have any of you ladies watched any goodies lately... I am thinking of renting Dazed and Confused as I haven't seen it for like ever!!! My buddy hasn't sen it so I think he'll like it cause he's from that era... 

Today was an okay day... I went on a lunch appointment with a guy from Intel... He was so funny when he told me this story about how he almost spent 5 years in prison... 

I have to tell you this story cause its almost too amazing to believe...

So this guy was dating this girl for a few months and decided to end it with her... She seemed to take it very well until 6 months later when he runs into a girl from the bank with a black eye... Turns out the ex had thought this woman that called from the bank to tell him that his checks were ready to be picked up, had been dating him... So the ex went and kicked this ladies ass that he had never met... This was crazy step one...

Step two he comes home and finds her in his bed and asks him why he was out so late and was he cheating on her... He said no, that they weren't going out any more... She starts freaking out and wont leave his house... She proceeds to kicking him in the balls.. He holds back with all of his streanghth and tries to push her out of his house... She runs back at him he calls the cops... She runs across the street to the neigbors house calls her dad and goes to wait outside... While outside she beats the crap out of herself and breaks her own nose with a 2x4... The cops show up arrest him and etc... He thought he was going to jail until he called a new lawyer, the one that his lawyer recommended and she drove out from SE Portland... Then she scares the court to drop the charges... The ex had made up the story and since then had started to date the DA... This is why they had agreed to charge him... It was a small town and things like that happen... 

Remember... Icould happen to you..."

"event","So yesterday I was so pleased with my 4.50 investment into my past... I have now listened to the CD like 4or 5 times and I am so not tired of it yet!!!

We had a ""sales"" meeting yesterday. We went to a place called the Taco House... Yucky... I love mexican food and I am so picky about it... This stuff was like taco bell but worse... No flavor... Anyway... I wasn't there for the food right?

We have this meeting... Oh, I should tell you a bit about my boss. Her mom used to own the company and she worked here for over 30 years... Her position was Vice President... Which means she knows jack shit about filters or sales... Okay...  Now that I've said that... So we have this meeting... I now have to have her ride around with me so she can learn how to sell filters... Problem is I don't want to spend more time with her than I have to... Let alone in front of my customers... I can't stand the people I work with... She is nice but just so I don't know the word... spoiled? Not good spoiled either... I mean super mean bratty catty... did I say mean... She has these random bursts of ""if you do this I'll fire you"" fits... Problem is she doesn't have the authority to fire me... hehehehe... Maybe I'm spoiled... 

So this is yes, a waste of paper... good thing its virtual trees I am killing...."

"event","I went shopping for CD's this past Friday. I bought four... Gwen Steffani, Korn, Pearl Jam, and Smashing Pumpkins... The latter is the one I am here to discuss.. 

Smashing Pumpkins and me in 93'. I was the age of 15 and lost beyond control.. What is it about music... But it seems to have memory... When I hear a song I can remember stuff I thought I had long forgotten... But today as I listened to the CD it had a different meaning... And gosh darn it!! It was such a great CD... I think myself very lucky to have grown up when I did... 

The music that rocks you to your soul.. The stuff you hear and it energizes you and makes you feel free... This is what the Smashing Pumpkins did for me... 

Remember the days when:

HipHop was the Sugar Hill Gang and LL Cool J
Country music was Randy Travis and Reba Macintire
Rock music was the Rolling Stones and Led Zepplin
Alternative music was the Smashing Pumpkins and Beck
Hard Rock music was Alice in Chains and Soundgarden

Not to mention Janis Joplin, The Beatles, Marshal Tucker Band, Primus, AC/DC, Steve Miller Band, Jimi, Black Sabbath, Pink Floyd, The Pixies, Depeche Mode, L7, Pearl Jam, Korn, Crystal Method, Fleetwood Mac( both bands..lol.. If you listen to fleetwood mac you know what I am saying here...),  My list could go on... Music is amazing... 

My point here is that good music lasts forever... Good bands are unforgettable... True musicians help you make memories!"

"event","Yes, I've felt so alone lately... But now I am back from my darkness. .It turns out I have been deficient in progesterone and have been producing too much estrogen... Now I am on a hormone treatment, very low dosage, and I feel normal again... Its nice to not wake up sad and stressed... I literally would wake up and feel like I was going to explode in my mind... But all is doing better now...

I've been playing my bass guitar a lot lately... I love it so much! Really helps keep me out of trouble...

I've also started to participate in my groups again... thank goodness they didn't kick me out during my down time... I really love those ladies... they are uber sweet!!!!

"event","So I just talked with my uber cool sis on the phone... I wish, she could know how very cool I think she is... (She does now :) Anyway, I always find it amazing that we made it out alive... From our childhood homes that is... Its been nice getting to know her now... We didn't talk much growing up... 

Yep, shes the one that did the art covering my walls... I would like to have more of her art someday... Shes also the one that spent an entire day with me on our almost recent trip to Seattle... First person to survive me that long... just kiddin... But seriously, we had a great time and It was nice to spend some real time with her... I wish I could be like her... The talent in her pinkie is more that I have in my entire body... She so totally rocks!!!!

"event","I loved John Wayne... I think its because he looked so much like the grandfather I never knew except through pictures and stories...

Its Monday... hummm.. I am tired as I have been up since 4:30 no thanks to my doggie... At least I passed out early last night, sans booze, thank you... 

Pilates was rough this morn as I hadn't been doing them for a week... Its amazing how quickly your body can adapt.. it goes either way, although sloth seems to be the fastest way...

I've been thinking of someone today.. I wonder what hes doing.. He seems to fall in and out of favor of me... Perhaps I am just muy loco... Doesn't matter... There is always time... 

I saw a horrible accident today. A range rover drove over the drivers side of a subaru. The drivers both looked real bad. Sometimes I wish I could be of more assistance in situations such as those... Unfortunately I tend to get in the way. So I called 911 and left my card..."

"event","I leave for Atlanta tomorrow...ugh... Gonna be hot and sticky... My boss already called to razz me... I must remember that red is a nice shade for me :)

I have been so bored lately... I seem to have more time in the day than I used to!!! Its funny cause I should be working right now but its hard to work when you will be gone the next few days... I hate leaving projects half done.

So over the past few weeks I have bought about 100 bucks worth of stuff from Janetstore... She has some old sticker sheets (Sanrio) like Pink no curisu and little cottonwood cottage... Man would I like to get some letter sets of the latter... Super cute elves...

Elves... why do I like them so much? Perhaps its the Irish in me (my father is Irish\Native American) So I suppose I like little people... and no I don't mean to sound crude but leprechauns rock... 

yep..."

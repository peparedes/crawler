"event","Today was boring as hell. In French we ate up most of the time in the lab, then the rest on journals. Fun...loads...of...fun... -.-;. In U.S. History all we did was a freaking time line for the entire class period. I wish I had friends in that class, it would be nice to have someone to talk to, pass notes with, to just have companionship with would be nice. I would die for a friend in that class. In English Mrs. Love let us listen to a slam poet on a CD that Kiki brought. He was actually very good, I enjoyed his work very much. The way he structured his poems and brought them to life on the mic was absolutely amazing...I can only wish to be even a fraction of that. I suck, though my family tell me how great I am. Pfft! Yeah right, family is supposed to tell you that because thats how it works. Anyway, in Physics we did practice TAKS, which wasn't too bad. Easier than I thought at least. Then Mr. Sanchez told us about how Mrs. Ferris took off and is changing his slides for TAKS tutoring because some kids were saying they are offensive. When he showed them to us I though: Heh..offensive? Yeah right, and I'm tan. They took off a monkey picture becuase some bubble-headed girl said it was offensive. She thought it meant that only monkey's can take the TAKS. Stupid.

After a week of being single I should be used to it by now shouldn't I? I mean, its what I wanted, and obviously what he wanted, but I still can't help feeling like it isn't over. Last night I was thinking about what should've changed when it ended. No more hugging, sweet-talk..blah blah, etc. The realization was that nothing changed because there was nothing TO change. Hugging? Nope. Sweet-talk? He did it to annoy me, I know it. Other stuff? What other stuff? We barely held five minute long conversations to begin with. Serves me right for saying yes too quickly. I should've gotten to know him better or something. Hell, we didn't know anything about each other but because of my stupid pride I let it drag on for nearly five months. Five freaking months and I still feel as if we are together though I know we aren't. I'm just crazy I guess. I don't don't want to be with him again, so why feel like I do?

"event","Today was an ok day. French was fun, we watched ""The Lion King"". Though I didn't understand what was being said I know the movie like the back of my hand, yay! Other than that my day has been pretty uneventful

Prom is just around the corner and I am so excited. I have my dress, my ticket, and a ride with my friend Candace. She is so sweet! 

Monday I'm going to be staying all day at my training site for Ready, Set, Teach! which I am looking foreward to. When we arrive I just won't get back on the bus. I'll get to teach a lesson plan I've been working on for about two weeks now. My fingers are crossed for everything to go well.

"event","Well, i'm back. I've decided to start writing in this again. Mostly cuz i'm back at my place in Blacksburg for the weekend and I have nothing else to do while I wait for my frozen pizza to cook. I just finished drill for this month and i'm too tired to make the five hour drive home.  We ran a Physical Fittness test this morning and I made the best run time in the company: 3 miles in 18 minutes and 26 seconds. So i'm a little worn out. I also just got more responsibility at my unit. I am now in charge of training the platoon i'm in on combat and fire tactics. I'm kinda looking forward to it, considering half the people in my platoon don't even know how to use a compass.
This has been some summer so far. I went to OCS for the first part of it, and now i'm spending my time working for some old plumber and working out at the gym. Iast weekend I went to a wedding down here for one of my friends. It was kinda fun but I didn't stay too long. I ended up going to some so called apartment party with one of my good friends. It turned out to be a ""gathering"" of three people. One of which I took home with me, which is so unlike me in the first place but hey, people do crazy things. Well now she wants to see me again, and i'm not sure if I feel the same way. I mean, come on...I slept with her the first night I met her...she's not exactly the type of person to get into a relationship with. Then again, i might be making a hasty judgment. I hardly know her and she might be in the same boat as me: doing something she hardly ever does. But for some reason I doubt that...
Aaanyways, my pizza is done. Dinner time. See ya"

"event","I'm the worst procrastinartor in the world. I have a take home final due in my Humanities class  a final in Greek Mythology tomorrow. My profecssor wants us to know the 12 labors of Herakles (Hercules is his Roman name) plus everything else that we have learned this semester. I haven't done a single thing for either one. I think that if I write down the 12 labours, that i'll remember them....hopefully

"event","Today one of my friends was telling me an interesting story about how two of her roomates, who are both married, are getting a separation because the wife had cheated on her husband, and is still in the process of seeing this person; even flaunting it in the husband's face who, I am inclined to add, knows the man. The reasons for the affair are trivial, and not even valid reasons, but from what I can gather the woman wants a divorce, but the man doesn't because he still 'loves' her. She shows absolutely no remorse for what she has done, and has decided to continue seeing this guy plus other men, despite the fact that they agreed on the opposite. Her logic is that it isn't any choice of his, so she can do what she wants. I can not blame the man for the situation, but I can blame him for not handling it like a man would; instead he just let both her and her lovers walk all over him.  First of all I would realize that the woman obviously does not have any morals, and I would divorce her before she realizes whats happening, and then i would provide her lover with an important lesson on why it isn't good to commit adultery. Of the many things that I have learned since joining the United States Marine Corps,  the ability to quickly and efficiently send a person to the hospital is perhaps one of my most favorite, and useful when I am angry and/or someone decides to make the mistake of wronging me. Ofcourse, I have more subtle, but just as effective methods as well: fear is a very powerful emotion and can be instilled by a variety of ways.
I think it would be best to stop at this thought,  lest it results in people thiking that I am a violent person. I am not for the most part. I am friendly, and kind, and generous to those who have proven to be  friends. It is only when someone has seriously done something out of malice towards me that I feel obligated to retaliate.

"event","It is interesting to me to think at times, when my mind is free enough to think of anything  besides class, of love and the confusions and misconceptions that people have of this very strong and influential emotion. There are those, it saddens me to say I was at one time one of who I speak, to whom love is that rush that one feels when they catch sight of someone they have a ""crush"" on. That feeling of butterflies fluttering in your stomach that people often call 'love' despite the fact that they may have met the person recently. There are those who fling the word love around carelessly as if it were akin to 'liking' someone, and as simple. There are those who think that just because they are involved in sex with someone that they must infact love that person, whether they believe it themselves or not. Love has been made into an 'every day' emotion, that is as easily experienced as anger, sadness, and joy. Society has lost the true meaning of love, i fear, and have made it, as I said previously, a synonym of like. Love, to me aslteast, is an emotion that does not happen at its full tilt in one instance, but is rather cultuvated, and nursed throughout the years. It is a tree that slowly grows through constant care and attention, but never reaches any fixed height; it is capable of growing as far as the gardeners wish it to grow. One does not start off, as love is concerned, with a full grown tree, bearing leaves and fruit and large roots that hold it steadily into the grown. Love starts out, as anything else which is good may, as a seed. It is not garunteed that this seed will grow to its fullest potential, or even sprout into a sapling.  Love between two people is developed not through sex or 'dating' for a year or two. Love involves knowing a person almost as well as you know yourself, knowing their good and bad points and liking them nonetheless. It involves being great friends with a person for, if you do not know them as you know a great friend then how can you ever expect to love them? If all that you have is physical attachment, then are you in love or merely turned on by that person? Love is not found or even sustained by sex. Two people who love eachother do not need to prove that love through physical contact. Love is a continuous process, that involves learning about a person throughout your lifetime together and through that knowledge growing more in love with them. Love is being willing to selflessly make sacrifices for that person. It is always looking forward to seeing that person and never growing tired of being around them. Love is wanting to be with a person throughout their live no matter where their road may lead. Love involves patience and dedication. Love should not be confused with infatuation. You shouldn't love someone because they are beautiful, they should be beautiful because you love them."

"event","It is not my intention when writing this journal for it to be a list of events that happen in my life from day to day, though an occasional event may find its ways into an entry now and then, but more to serve as a basin into which I am able to pour my thoughts, ideas, opinions, and perhaps an occasional bit of creativity. I have descided to make my journal open to the public instead of keeping it within the confines of a book for the reason that I hope some may take an interest in what I right, and, if not benefit from what I have to say (if one would be so bold as to say their thoughts could be beneficial to another),but atleast to walk away with something on their mind. I feel that it is my right to express opinions on such matters as one may think about from time to time, wether they are read by others or not.
 It is good for a person to have their own artistic outlet, and though I may not be the most skilled writer, I do feel this to be my way of expressing myself.  I look forward to continuing this journal, and to having it read and responded to as well."

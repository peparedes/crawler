Of a deluge of passers-by
I saw one gaze frozen in time
Watching me passing by
I swear I'll know your face in the crowd
And I'll hear your voice so loud
When you're whispering

Hey unfaithful I will teach you
To be stronger, to be stronger
Hey ungraceful I will teach you
To forgive one another

Here's my kiss to betray
Desperate to brush the lips of grace
Do you feel hollow when you think of how I've lied?

Oh sweet angel of mercy with your grace like the morning
Wrap your loving arms around me

saw my younger brother
for the first time in 
5 months. boy was that
fun. i miss that little

birthday was yesterday.
i pretended like i had
to work and went home to
suprise her. i love my
family a lot, and its
taken this last weekend
to make me realize how 
much they really mean
to me. i want to hit 
myself in the fucking
face. why do i still
think about you. it
doesn't happen that
much anymore, but 
every once and awhile
i think about how perfect
you were. i was lucky
to have met someone
like you. i just wish
it would've been in 
better circumstances.
why did i think of you
today? first time in a
month. i guess it should
be the last. you never want
to speak to me again. oh
well. moving on. i'm getting
a new apartment at the end 
of the month. i'm going to
live alone because i don't
want to deal with a roomate.
it'll be for the best. i
actually can't wait. i'm
failing out of school, i
got a job at sears again,
i suck at life. i shouldn't
have started typing on here,
because now i'm just bitter 
and depressed. i just wish
you wouldn't have promised
not to fuck me over, and then
done it anyways."

who they'll kiss before they get home

lie for fun

barely conscious in the door where you stand
your eyes are fighting sleep while your mouth makes its demands
you laugh at every word trying hard to be cute
i almost feel sorry for what i'm going to do
and your hair smells of smoke
who will cast the first stone?
you can sin 
or spend the night all alone

brass buttons on your coat hold the cold
in the shape of a heart that they cut out of stone
you're using all your looks that you've thrown from the start
if you let me have my way 
i swear i'll tear you apart
cause it's all you can be
you're a drunk 
and you're scared

got to sleep on the couch
because i let erika have my bed
got a cut lip from sparring this morning
didn't think when he said he was going to hit to make me feel it
he would hit that hard
ate lunch at olive garden
drove back to fort wayne with erika

I trusted you, trusted that you'd be different then most girls. Its ridiculous that you'd even believe bullshit like that. Its ridiculous the way you treated me last night on the phone. Calling me a liar, accusing me of destroying people's personal belongings. Its not fair. You expect me to be sympathetic towards what you've gone through this week, but you don't understand that it affects more than just you. Do you know how I've felt all week? Do you know what its like to be called a liar everyday, do you know what its like to be accused of destroying two people's computers when you haven't done a thing? Do you know what its like to tell a girl how you feel about her, tell her things that you wouldn't have told just anyone, and have her turn her back on you? Do you know what its like to stay up until 6am waiting for a phone call when you have to be up at 8am. Or not sleeping at all because a few hours beforehand someone you care about pretty said you meant nothing to them? I waited for your phonecall that was coming ""a half hour later"". I'm still waiting. I haven't slept yet. I can't sleep. All i can think about is how ridiculous this whole thing is. How i would never even imagine doing what's been done to someone, let alone someone as magnifecent as you. take what i've said or leave it. it doesn't really matter to you anymore. i just wanted you to know, i really do care about you, and didn't do a thing. oh, and my away message said ""it doesn't matter what you say, it never mattered anyway"". and no, it wasn't about you. maybe it was about me, did you think of that. because it doens't matter what i say, you won't believe a thing, even though i've never done a thing to break your trust. bye kayt.

i've been drowning in my sleep
i've prayed for your safe place
and its time for us to leave

time is running
its running on empty 
and the gas is running out
i've decided that tonight is the night
that i let love aside
full speed ahead this seems to be the place
i've seen this once before
planned perfection sought in my dreams
hoping this would take you home

my knuckles have turned to white
there's no turning back tonight
so kiss me one last time

around this turn where the cross will cast your shadow
the people will all gather
to remember such a day
where the flames grew as high as trees
and the world stopped for you and me

my knuckles have turned to white
there's no turning back tonight
kiss me one last time
(shut your eyes)
my knuckles have turned to white
there's no turning back tonight
(so hold on tight)
kiss me one last time
(shut your eyes)

i will now bring new meaning to the word alone
endless nights of dreaming of life
and the days we should have spent here

drowning in my sleep i'm drowning in my sleep
drowning in my sleep i'm drowning in my sleep

glass shatters and comes to a halt
i thought we'd be there by now
i thought it would be so much quicker than this

pain has never been so brilliant
i made sure you were buckled in
now you can walk hand in hand with him
hand in hand with him

my knuckles have turned to white
there's no turning back tonight
kiss me one last time
(shut your eyes)
my knuckles have turned to white
there's no turning back tonight
(so hold on tight)
kiss me one last time
(shut your...)"

"event","i really can't go without much sleep forever. third night in a row i was up until 6am. i guess its cool. gave me time to think about things. fucking ridiculous things.

what difference does this difference in age make
i know how it ends 
she'll kill me quick
so call 911
i'm already dead 
but someone should be caught
and held responsible for this bloody mess"

"event","the pressure builds
as the glass begins to crack
i've got one less chance to talk to you
once again he's cracked his whip
why do you stand around and take the abuse
when you know theres so much more for you
i've never understood whats going on
never understood why you let him press you under his thumb
but you can make your own decisions
so decide away babe"

"event","people can be amazingly stupid sometimes
i'm confused
sick

the time has come for colds and overcoats
we're quiet on the ride
we're all just waiting to get home
another week away
my greatest fear
i need the smell of summer
i need its noises in my ears
if looks could really kill
then my profession would be staring
please know we do this cause we care
and not for the thrill
collect calls to home
to tell them that I realize
that everyone who lives will someday die
and die alone.

and we won't let you in
though we're down and out
we won't let you in
you win

i wrote more postcards than hooks
i read more maps than books
feel like every chance to leave
is another chance I should have took
every minute is a mile
i've never felt so hollow
i'm an old abandoned church with broken pews
and empty aisles.
my secrets for a buck
watch me as I cut myself wide open
on this stage
yes, I am paid to spill my guts.
i won't see home till spring
oh, I would kill for the Atlantic
but I am paid to make girls panic
while I sing

and we won't let you in
though we're down and out
we won't let you in
and we won't let you in
we don't want what isn't ours
we won't let you in
you win

and the coastline is quiet
while we're quietly losing control
yes, we're silent but sur
we inventened the cure
that will wash out my memories of her
the harpoon is loaded.
the cage is lowered
the water is red
like you"

After I fucking opened up to you at seven in the fucking morning
You repay with a stab in the fucking back
Good luck with everything"

"event","i've been lost for words all week. my laptop is broke. this sucks. i'm on a school computer at the moment typing this. i never knew how true it was when my dad said that nothing in life comes easy and the best things have to be fought for. i chose my battles. i decided when its worth fighting for, and when things would just be better off given up on. i don't even have anything to say. i've been a fucking speechless kid all day. i just don't understand how the one person that actually needs to think i'm sincere doesn't, but everyone else does. things can be strange sometimes.

p.s.
i've always loved a liar"

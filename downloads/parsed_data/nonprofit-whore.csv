'Prove It'
POTC genfic
345 words
PG for certain implications and a naked Will Turner.

""And so there I was, entertaining not one but <i>two</i> Singarporian women as their maid watched and their servant boy took notes. I'll never forget it.""

Will could only laugh. ""Sometimes I have a hard time believing these stories.""

""Aye, you ever been Singapore?""

""Well, no.""

""I think you just proved my point, mate."" Will just shrugged, and Jack continued. ""Not that I'd expect you to have been there, considering..."" Jack's eyes shifted downward, toward Will's lap.

""What?"" Will asked, looking in his lap but seeing nothing out of the ordinary.

""Well, <i>you know.</i>"" Jack waved his hand.

""No, I don't.""

""Your, uh, little friend. Your little friend's little problem?"" Jack gestured at Will's general crotch-area.

""Wha... Jack!"" Will began to fume, much to Jack's further amusement. ""I told you, I am not a eunuch!""

""Prove it."" Jack's eyes glinted in the flickering candlelight.

""I don't have to prove anything to you.""

""Please? C'mon, just let ole' Jack have a little look-see.""

""Are you kidding me? <i>No!</i>""

""What I ask, I ask in complete modesty and chastity and virginity and all that, dear lad! I'm only curious."" Jack's wandering fingers reached for the ties of Will's breeches, but Will slapped them away furiously.

""You've got issues."" Will huffed. He took swig from the bottle of rum they'd been nursing all evening, all the while keeping an eye on Jack's hands.

""I do believe this has already been established, on numerous occassions. Don't change the subject!"" Jack attempted to crawl over him, his face coming dangerously close to Will's crotch. Will jumped to his feet as though he'd been branded. ""I won't tell anyone if you are!""

Will arched a brow.

""Well. Perhaps one or two people, but I can solemnly swear <i>their</i> utter honesty on this matter. And I won't tell Elizabeth. Though, I reckon she'll find out in due time."" He grinned devilishly and winked, now laying haphazardly on the bed as the Pearl rocked back and forth on unsteady seas.

""Fine! If it'll stop your pestering, here!"" Will untied his breeches and yanked them down to his ankles, standing there in all his half-naked glory.

Jack tilted his head to the side, and smiled. </lj-cut>"

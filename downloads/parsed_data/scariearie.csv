"event","well...on saturday (july 16th) myself, dani, simon, and my fasha went to ""comic con"" san diego. we were hoping to see tenacious d at 6:30 but we decided to go for the whole day. dani and i were waiting for the d all day and finally around 5:15 we left ""the simpsons"" panel to get in line early. we went to the lower level and there was a HUGE line. we cut the line. haha anyway, we got in there (this room can hold 5000 people) and stood in the back. on the large monitor in the front of the room we saw peter jackson talking about his new movie ""king kong"" starring jack black and naomi watts. i happen to adore jack black and was very excited to see him proform with KG (kyle gass). me and dani decided to ask someone if the d would be on next. they relplied: ""yes, but first is the ""king kong"" pannel. all of a sudden, we see adrian broddy, naomi watts, and JACK BLACK walk out on to the panel. me and dani get very excited and run to the front of the room only to be stopped by security. then, we sat behind a line of people waiting to ask the panel questions. a strange hispanic man approaches us and asked us to go up and ask jack to sing to us. soooo it was our turn to ask jack and he did...he sang to me and dani. seeing my face on those huge monitors made me want to RUN AWAY (haha) but we were so happy, we could not. the song he sang was very hilarious and will never be heard again. its called ""KONG"" and it goes a little something like this: ""KKKKOOOONNNNNGGGGGG!!!! IN THE JUNGLE HE LIVES THAT IS WHERE HE BELONGSSSSS!!!"" it was amazing. then i called simon with excitement and he said he saw us on the monitors. then we went to the middle area of the room and sat on the floor. we waited for the d to come on and got really crappy seats. it was so fabulous though. jabbles and rage kage were hilarious. all in all comin con was pretty boring but the end of the day is always exciting. and now i can say that jack black sang to me and it was the best day of my life. :)"

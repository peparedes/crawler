Loosely adapted from my NYR.

I maaay filter these too to avoid being spammy, not sure yet so feel free to sing out if you have an opinion either way.

Organise or plan something - planned my remaining DragCave Secret Santa gifts.
Cook (pantry/freezer) - dug some duck from the freezer and made my first duck ragu! Omnom.
Wildcard - didn't quite get to declutter territory, but gonna put this down for some much needed housework.

At this stage I'll probably pop back to edit through the week to keep track, and post a new one each Sunday for the coming week.

Final unfiltered post about the writing filter too, if you did the poll or commented somewhere asking for access, you should now be able to see <a href=""http://shopfront.dreamwidth.org/368353.html"">this</a> and <a href=""http://shopfront.dreamwidth.org/368788.html"">this</a> post. Any issues lemme know.

Unrelated but urgh I have been ill the last few days and urgh, brain fog. Starting to come good but urgh. However I managed to go through and thank all of my <span style=""white-space: nowrap;""><a href=""http://fandom-stocking.dreamwidth.org/profile""><img src=""http://s.dreamwidth.org/img/silk/identity/community.png"" alt=""[community profile] "" width=""16"" height=""16"" style=""vertical-align: text-bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;"" /></a><a href=""http://fandom-stocking.dreamwidth.org/""><b>fandom_stocking</b></a></span> stuffers and do a good chunk of my DragCave Secret Santa gift list and a few offline things besides, but still. Urgh. I think I need to send my body/brain back to the factory for new parts.

Summary: Nikki and Nora celebrate their first Christmas Eve in their new home by remembering a Christmas long past.

<lj-cut text=""Fireplaces and Stockings and Beds, Oh My!"">


<p>The booze combined with the heat spilling from their fireplace was making Nora feel pleasantly warm and silly as she raised her shotglass in a toast.<br />
""Here's to our very first, very Merry Christmas in our beautiful, new, and finally fully repainted home,"" she said, before tipping back the shot with a dramatic grimace and then holding it back out to Nikki for a refill.<br />
Nikki just laughed and took the glass back, blithely ignoring Nora's protests. She was curled up under the Christmas tree with a bottle of whisky in her hands, a Santa hat slipping down over one ear, and her hair was tangled and glowing in the firelight. She looked like all of Nora's Christmases come at once.<br />
""How did I get so lucky?"" Nora asked softly, leaning in for a kiss and somehow missing and ending up in Nikki's lap instead.<br />
Still chuckling to herself, Nikki just put the bottle and glasses aside and reached down to stroke Nora's cheek<br />
""I think you carried my bags for Christmas,"" she said, smiling fondly.<br />
Nora just hummed happily and turned her face into the warmth of Nikki's leg, playing with the hem of her pants leg.<br />
""Was just your bellhop,"" she muttered sleepily, closing her eyes and letting the warmth and the smell of pine pull her down towards sleep.<br />
""But what a wonderful bellhop you were,"" Nikki said quietly, voice tumbling down from above as her other hand settled in Nora's hair.</p>
<center><p>........</p></center>
<p><em>Years earlier</em><br />
""You have got to be kidding me!"" Nora grumbled under her breath as she wrestled their suitcases roughly through the too-narrow door frame of the suite.<br />
""Oh yes, I think this will do nicely!""<br />
Nikki's voice and twinkling laugh floated back through the room just as a suitcase wheel caught on the frame and very nearly sent Nora swearing head over heels.<br />
""I'm fine, just silently screaming under the weight of all this luggage, nobody help or anything.""<br />
Nora huffed and finally settled the suitcases upright against the wall by the entrance. She swung off the leather bag draped across her body, one hand rubbing at where the edge of the strap had pressed painfully into the skin of her collarbone, and then paused with the bag hovered in her other outstretched hand.<br />
She could just leave it there, but it would be precarious on top of the other bags. Or she could drop it straight on the rough wooden floor....<br />
Her fancy new partner seemed like she might be the type to be less than pleased though, and after a long morning that was the last thing they needed to deal with. With a sigh, Nora slipped the bag strap back onto her shoulder with a grimace and followed the other two, catching the tail end of the room tour.<br />
""There's only the one bed, mind,"" the hotel owner was saying. ""But this suite is big enough for a decent couch so one of you can sleep on that.""<br />
'That'll probably be for me then,' Nora thought to herself with a shake of her head and carried on past them into the bedroom. Behind her she heard pleasantries and reassurances dripping from Nikki's lips with a comfort and familiarity Nora could never properly muster for cases like these, while Nora surveyed the room and its one rather expansive but very solo bed sitting centre stage.<br />
""Don't worry, I told her we like to share,"" Nikki murmured throatily in Nora's ear, breaking her silent contemplation and making her jump.<br />
""You told her - wait, she's going to think...,"" Nora gaped but Nikki just smirked. ""You told her we were a couple?!""<br />
Nikki just shrugged and gave an airy sigh. ""She saw me flirting with Leon down in reception and seemed a little jealous-""<br />
""Of you? Miss Flirting-For-A-Room-Upgrade making someone jealous? That doesn't sound likely at all,"" Nora rolled her eyes while Nikki continued chattering away over the top of her.<br />
""- we might need her help after all, who knows how long it'll take to get a lead. Oh, my bag! You bought it in, thank you.""<br />
Nora couldn't quite stop herself smiling as Nikki's eyes lit up at the sight of her Louis Vou-whatever carefully laid out on the bed, even if being left behind to be a sweaty, overburdened bag carrier still smarted just a little.<br />
""Yes, well, apparently someone has to play the indentured servant in this sting.""<br />
Nora bit back her smile as she spoke and shrugged, popping her hands into her back pockets and hunching her shoulders, but Nikki just gazed back serenely without rising to the bait. A small smile was playing about her lips, and then suddenly she flung her arms around Nora and pressed her lips against her cheek, making Nora grunt softly in surprise and stagger back a step.<br />
""Thank you,"" she said sincerely, face close enough to Nora's that she could feel the warmth of her breath making the spot Nikki had kissed tingle.<br />
Nora's breath stuttered, just a little, and her hands seemed to come up automatically against her will to hover just shy of Nikki's hips. ""You're- you're welcome.""</p>
<center><p>........</p></center>
<p>""It was like you could see right through me."" Nora sighed, shifting lazily in Nikki's lap.<br />
""Hmm?""<br />
""That night, in that creaky old hotel on the edge of town. Our first case together...""<br />
""Our first Christmas together, too.""<br />
Nikki's hand resumed stroking through Nora's hair and glass clinked somewhere above Nora's head, rousing her enough to make an indignant noise.<br />
""Hey, why do you get to keep drinking but I don't?""<br />
Nikki's didn't answer but her chuckle was throaty with alcohol and amusement, nudging Nora into drifting back to half dozing memories.</p>

<p>""Don't be ridiculous, you can't sleep on that old couch.""<br />
""Oh, really?"" Nora cocked a hip and raised an eyebrow. Truth be told, she didn't really want to sleep on the dusty old thing anyway. It looked as worn and poorly kept as the beautiful if dingy old house that they were staying in. But sleeping in bed next to her smoking hot new partner?<br />
No, probably not for the best.<br />
""No, you can't. Ida is going to come bustling in here in the morning with a breakfast tray and you'll ruin our cover if you're sleeping out there like you're anyone other than my girlfriend. Now get on in here,"" Nikki said, pulling back the covers with a flourish.<br />
Feeling sheepish and just a little bit cornered, Nora carefully slid between the covers.<br />
'Be cool, dammit,' she scolded herself. Nikki couldn't possibly begin to guess that Nora was deeply closeted and even more deeply attracted to a colleague she'd met only a week ago. It was just a bed, and just sleeping on a mattress next to a totally unremarkable body.<br />
Nora had this.<br />
""Much better,"" Nikki said, satisfaction clear in her voice as she flicked off the lamp and wriggled further down under the covers. In the process she shifted across to the middle of the bed, curling up on her side barely a hands breadth from Nora and smiling at her like the cat that had got the cream.<br />
Nora so did not have this.</p>
<center><p>........</p></center>
<p>""You were tormenting me,"" Nora insisted loudly. ""It was deliberate and sadistic and rather like very slow, very pleasant torture."" Rousing herself enough to shift onto her back, legs almost singe-worthily close to the flames so she could look upward, Nora gazed happily up at Nikki's very indulgent looking face<br />
""Well you were a very pretty almost-stranger who I was oddly and immediately attracted to, and there <em>was</em> only one bed. A girl only has so much self restraint.""<br />
""Torment,"" Nora insisted, groping clumsily behind them for the whiskey bottle without breaking away from Nikki's gaze, and then holding the bottle triumphantly aloft before rolling back upright. ""I barely slept a wink that night, or the one after that.""<br />
""We didn't even catch the perp,"" Nikki said, voice soft with memory as her eyes drifted down to Nora's mouth.<br />
""After working on Christmas in that drafty old house and everything,"" Nora agreed, moving in. ""What a waste of time that was.""<br />
""Oh, I don't know,"" Nikki said, closing the gap with a soft kiss. ""Watching you squirm up close had its benefits.""<br />
""Merry Christmas to Nikki, then.""<br />
Nikki hummed in happy agreement against Nora's lips, and then shouted with laughter as Nora pulled her down to the rug before kissing her senseless.<br />
'Merry Christmas to me, more like,' Nora thought.<br />
<br />
<br />

Summary: Just when Clara is trying to forget about all things Time Lord, along comes a slightly odd blonde to liven things up again.

<lj-cut text=""Three Meetings and a Dinner Date."">





<p>After it happened - <i>Come on now. You knew I was going to regenerate eventually, Clara. I'm afraid it's just rather what I do, no matter how hard I try to avoid it</i> - everything seemed a little grey. A little more ordinary.</p>
<p>It was to be expected, she supposed. It was her decision and all that - <i>I don't think I can do this again. I'm sorry, I'm really, really sorry</i> - and she still had U.N.I.T., still had her students...</p>
<p>  <i>It's still me, Clara.</i></p>
<p>... but no matter how determined she was to stick to it, she was still a little, well, bored really.</p>
<p>  <i>I know that. I do. But I miss you. I miss both of you, really, or I suppose all of you is technically more accurate, and I can't... I just can't. Not after Danny. I'm right sick of missing people.</i>
</p>
<p>She'd had plenty of long gaps between trips in the TARDIS before, so part of her wondered why this really felt different. Granted, she'd thrown herself into travelling in a whole new way after Danny - gone native, the Doctor kept saying, whatever that was supposed to mean - so what might have just felt like a break before seemed a little more like a dead stop in comparison.</p>
<p>But this was the life she'd chosen now. School, and students, and U.N.I.T. and-</p>
<p>""Hello, gorgeous. I don't suppose you've seen a big blue box around here anywhere?"" asked a blonde girl with a grin who had popped up in front of her, eye to eye, with her hair in a pony and her eyebrows raised.</p>
<p>-people behaving suspiciously. Why did that never change, exactly?</p>
<p>""What? Nope, sorry, no blue boxes here. Um, who are you?""</p>
<p>""The name's Jenny, pleasure to meet you but don't mind me! I've gotta run, places to see and boxes to find and all that,"" she said, and then after a long appreciative look up and down Clara's body, she was dashing off.</p>
<p>Clara blinked, and then gave chase. ""Wait!""</p>
<p>But she turned a corner in pursuit and the girl was already gone.</p>
<p>""What on earth is going on?""</p>
<center><p>#</p></center>
""So after the war ended they all-""
<p>""Um, Miss? Miss there's a girl at the window, Miss...""</p>
<p>Clara blinked at Bradley's interruption and then turned towards the window. The very not-ground-floor window where the same strange -<i> Jessica or Genevieve or... no, Jenny. She said her name was Jenny </i>- girl from the day before was now hanging upside down in mid-air off what looked like some kind of cable...</p>
<p>""Hello!"" she called through the glass. All the students immediately started babbling at a hundred miles an hour and rushed to the window, but Jenny just hung there unconcerned. She was smiling just as sunnily as before and waving at Clara. Through the classroom window. In front of the students.</p>
<p>Oh, boy.</p>
<p>""Back to your seats, back to your seats,"" Clara cried, pushing into the middle of them and flapping her hands until they all reluctantly retreated.</p>
<p>Quickly, Clara flipped the latch and swung the window open. It opened outwards, but Jenny just did something with her legs and twisted her hips and then flipped right over and out of the way of the window pane. Clara couldn't help but notice that it had looked... very graceful.</p>
<p>She gave a quiet cough and shook herself out of her own thoughts.</p>
<p>""What on earth are you doing out there!"" she cried, reaching a hand out toward her. ""Get in here at once.""</p>
<p>""Ooh, authoritative!"" Jenny took Clara's hand. Her skin felt very warm against Clara's palm. ""And a firm grip! I like that. You are interesting, I thought so.""</p>
<p>Then she hooked a foot over the window sill and used it to propel herself forward, while unclipping something on the cables faster than Clara could track. Then with a bit of a dive and something of a twirl, she landed steadily on her feet in Clara's classroom - and in Clara's arms.</p>
<p>""Oh my god,"" Clara gasped.</p>
<p>""Lovely to see you again,"" Jenny said, unruffled and still grinning. ""Sorry, got to dash, not quite sure why I ended up at a school but... Well. These things happen.""</p>
<p>Then she was away again, just like in the street. Again Clara couldn't keep up. Although not because she was too slow, this time. Though perhaps a little because the sudden loss of Jenny's warmth from her arms was a little disorienting. Odd that.</p>
<p>""Miss!"" </p>
<p>The rabble were calling her name as she started to give chase. Dammit. She couldn't leave a classroom full of students unattended.</p>
<p>""Right, then,"" she said after standing in the doorway for nearly a full minute, torn with indecision. She gave herself another shake - <i>get it together, Clara</i> - and spoke over her shoulder while still gazing down the hallway. Jenny'd be long gone already, anyway. ""Back to work!""</p>
<p>""But Miss-"" </p>
<p>""Who was that?"" </p>
<p>""She must be a new teacher or something-"" </p>
<p>""Wasn't she a bit odd for a teacher?"" </p>
<p>""I wish she was my teacher!"" </p>
<p>""She was pretty young-"" </p>
<p>""So is Miss Oswald, though."" </p>
<p>""Miss, Miss!""</p>
<p>Clara took a really deep breath and then made sure her smile was firmly in place before she spun back around.</p>
<p>""Alright, you lot. That's enough! Open your books back up to page ten already, chop chop, it'll be-""</p>
<p>""But Miss-""</p>
<p>""-lunchtime before you know it. Now where were we...""</p>
<center><p>#</p></center>
<p>""Oh, you have got to be joking,"" Clara muttered as she saw the end of a perky ponytail disappearing into a storeroom. Just as she was about to leave at the end of the day, too. It might have been a few days since the debarkle with the window, not that you'd know it with the way the students had been harping on about it, but she'd still recognize that shade of blonde anywhere now</p>
<p>Clara strode over and flung the door back open. The stomping had maybe been a bit too much. But then you couldn't be too slow when you hadn't even been spotted yet, after all.</p>
<p>""Right then, what exactly do you want with that big blue box you keep talking about?"" Clara demanded, arm extended across the door to block the only exit.</p>
<p>Jenny looked over from a shelf, expression disappointingly unstartled and sliding back into that same - <i>infuriating </i>- easy grin.</p>
<p>""Oh, you know,"" Jenny shrugged, ""this and that.""</p>
<p>""I'm afraid I don't really know. So how about you,"" Clara said, pointing a finger and then stepping forward to poke Jenny in the chest with it, ""enlighten me.""</p>
<p>Jenny stared down at Clara's finger pressing against her skin, and then her grin broadened even more. It was already a big grin. Clara didn't really understand how that was even possible.</p>
<p>""You know it really is strange that I keep ending up back here. Are you sure you've never seen it? It's about oh so big-"" </p>
<p>Here Jenny stopped to step back and reach a hand above her head, stretching adorably up to the tips of her toes and then bouncing on the spot a little. Clara swallowed a laugh. She was effectively launching herself a short distance into the air in a comical failure to achieve the true height of what Clara was pretty sure was supposed to be the TARDIS. </p>
<p>""-and a really, really bright blue. With little windows, and some white writing on the-""</p>
<p>Shit. That confirmed it. She definitely needed to call U.N.I.T. now.</p>
<p>""Sorry, nope, no police boxes around here. Bit outdated, really, not sure where you'd find one.""</p>
<p>""That was it! Police box! What does that even mean, anyway, 'police box'? It's a very odd set of words, nobody anywhere in the galaxy has been able to tell me what it actually means yet.""</p>
<p>""Galaxy, huh?"" Clara nodded and made a series of quiet inquisitive noises while she took a careful, small step backwards. Toward the door really, but trying to make it look like she just wanted to lean against the wall next to it. ""I suppose it's a box for the police to use, seems rather self-explanatory to me...""</p>
<p>""Sure, but use for what? Donna mentioned something about it being really big, but I remember it looked really small before the rocks fell, so I'm not sure what-""</p>
<p>As she talked, Clara slipped a hand into her pocket, trying to find the right button on her phone without moving the fabric of her clothes too obviously. There was that little button on the side, U.N.I.T. had said. A funny little bit of repurposed alien tech. Just faintly telepathic so it couldn't go off accidentally, but requiring very little manual dexterity to operate. </p>
<p>Perfect for a silent alarm really, when you thought about it.</p>
<p>She pressed it. Nothing happened. She pressed it again. Wasn't it supposed to buzz silently against her finger when she activated it...? She frowned and pressed it again.</p>
<p>""-I'm really looking for. Oh, sorry about your little communications device,"" Jenny said, interrupting her focus and bringing her drifting gaze flying back up to Jenny's face.</p>
<p>Jenny producing a shiny gadget from her pocket and waved it in Clara's direction. It looked a little bit like the Doctor's screwdriver, actually, but bigger. More... rectangular. Still covered in buttons and lights though. Figures, for what was probably alien tech. It was always so, well, flashy.</p>
<p>""Multi-purpose jamming signal. Multi-purpose lots of things really, but right now just that,"" Jenny said, shrugging one shoulder like 'what can you do?' ""Built it myself, it's a handy little thing really. Thought it might be good for us to have a little chat uninterrupted - no, wait!""</p>
<p>Clara was moving back towards the door before she could really think about it. But Jenny was too fast, she had grabbed Clara's hand tight before she could escape. Clara thought about trying to break her grip and legging it, but they were pretty evenly matched in stature and Clara had never been much for throwing the first punch if she could avoid it.</p>
<p>""I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you!""</p>
<p>""I'm not scared,"" Clara said, lifting her chin. ""I just have no idea who you are or what you want,"" <i>and she didn't have any backup...</i></p>
<p>""I'm Jenny. I did say, remember? I'm looking for my father, and for some reason the readings on this,"" she shook the gadget again and it beeped alarmingly, ""keep leading me back to you.""</p>
<p>""... and who is your father?""</p>
<p>""The Doctor, of course!""</p
<p>Clara gaped.</p>
<p>Jenny smiled. </p>
<p>Then she rocked back on her heels while she watched Clara. </p>
<p>Then her smile slowly started turning into a frown.</p
<p>""Are you alright?""</p>
<p>""The Doctor is your father,"" Clara repeated hoarsely. ""That's... not possible. If you were, you'd be, well. There's no one else left... so you should be... that's just not possible.""</p>
<p>""I should be dead, is that what you were trying to say?"" Jenny asked, smile firmly back in place and teeth biting cutely into her lower lip.</p>
<p>""Uh huh.""</p>
<p>""Well, he probably thinks I am, really. That's why I'm looking for him. I did some exploring on my own, but I got a bit bored; my little quadrant of the galaxy didn't have nearly as much variety as I expected. So I had to find a time travel device-""</p>
<p>She could even ramble like the Doctor, Clara noticed distantly. She didn't look like him at all, but maybe she was born to one of his past regenerations. Different face, different genetics, all that. It wouldn't be the weirdest thing to ever happen...</p>
<p>Somehow that thought was enough to flip the switch in her head back from call in backup to be cautious, to regular old Clara curiosity.</p>
<p>""-which was not easy, let me tell you. And then I had to figure out how to use it, which was not nearly as intuitive as I expected it to be with our heritage and all. And so now, I'm here! Chasing readings, looking for The Doctor. But I found you, instead.""</p>
<p>""Guess I'm probably a bit of a disappointment, then,"" Clara laughed, relaxing just enough to lean back against the wall properly this time.</p>
<p>""Not really,"" Jenny said, putting the device away and leaning in, entwining the fingers of their joined hands and making Clara glance down in surprise. ""To be honest, I'm not in any hurry. Trying to see new places and do new things on the way to finding him again, and speaking of new things, how would you feel about dinner?""</p>
<p>""Sorry?""</p>
<p>""Did I get that right? I haven't been on this planet very long, and dating methods weren't exactly included in the download-""</p>
<p>""Hang on, download?""</p>
<p>""-but I've gathered so far that talking over dinner was a good way to get to know someone. So. Dinner?""</p>
<p>Clara could tell the surprised smile was a little fixed on her face at this point from the constant flow of information. She didn't know what to do in the face of a Time Lady asking her out on a date but- </p
<p>""I suppose it couldn't hurt,"" she heard herself say.</p>
<p>-huh. Dinner it was then.</p
<p>Jenny just grinned some more, squeezed her hand, and off they ran.</p>

Summary: When she agreed to move in with Peggy, Angie didn't realise she'd end up needing so many sets of keys... (A good agent sets up a secret place to retreat to in times of trouble. Peggy Carter is a very good agent. She has more than a few places.)

<lj-cut text=""Cupid's Bolt(hole)"">




<p>""Come on already, English, you're not afraid of a little cold are you?""</p>
<p>Peggy couldn't help but smile in response as Angie laughed, and then launched herself out of the car before Peggy could even turn the key to off. Her energy was, as always, contagious. Suddenly the grim frozen backdrop of their surroundings seemed to Peggy to be a little more magical than before.</p>
<p>""I'll have you know I have bedded down in snow behind enemy lines before without so much as a tent,"" Peggy called through her open car window as she fished around in the backseat for her bag.</p>
<p>When she looked back up, Angie had stopped still in the snow mid-twirl. Her hands were raised above her head as if entreating the heavens to open up and shower more snowflakes upon her, but she dropped them again as she turned back to Peggy with wide eyes.</p>
<p>""Gosh,"" she said, awe colouring her voice, before peering closer at Peggy's expression as she stepped out of the car. Then her eyes narrowed and a smirk spread across her face. ""You yanking my chain?""</p>
<p>""I don't know what you could possibly mean,"" Peggy replied with a sniff and a raised eyebrow. </p>
<p>Angie just kept staring intensely at her, and Peggy found herself fighting back a smirk of her own. As she walked she also pulled another set of keys from her bag and held them out. </p>
<p>""These are yours,"" Peggy said. ""You should open the cabin door to test them. The lock is a bit stiff and you wouldn't want to be struggling with it in an emergency.""</p>
<p>Angie just hummed under her breath and held out a hand with a twitch of her eyebrow, smirk still firmly in place. Peggy dropped the keys into her hand, and together they mounted the steps to the cabin porch. </p>
<p>""Not stiff at all,"" Angie said with a laugh as she opened the lock with a loud click. Then she flung the door open dramatically, ""our woodland palace awaits!""</p>
<p>Peggy snorted. ""It's hardly a palace. Certainly it's nothing like we have back home, either... but it'll do.""</p>
<p>""Oh hush,"" Angie said, and then bustled inside, running her fingers over walls and furniture as she went. ""Brr, it's a little cold in here, but it's lovely!""</p>
<p>Peggy couldn't help but disagree as she followed Angie inside, but she kept her thoughts to herself. She was mesmerized by Angie's smile as she carefully examined what seemed like almost every square inch of the room. </p>
<p>The furniture was worn, the drapes ragged, and there was a fair helping of dust across all the surfaces. The large bed in the corner sagged in the middle, from memory, and the pillows would probably make them sneeze. They would certainly have to clean a little before they left. But there was also a large fireplace and a decent basket of wood beside it, warm rugs on all the chairs, a large well stocked pantry full of canned goods, and a decent store of spare clothing and medical supplies.</p>
<p>Peggy had tried to make it comfortable as well as practical, but at the end of the day it was simply what it was - a bolthole.</p>
<p>
""Now are you sure you remember the route? I don't want to draw extra attention if we can help it... But we can double back and do the last part of the drive up again in the morning if you need to, just to be sure,"" Peggy said.</p>
<p>""Relax, I studied the map and paid attention during the trip like you said to,"" Angie said, throwing herself down into an overly large armchair with a happy sigh. ""You forget that I'm used to navigating around tiny unmarked streets to get to equally tiny auditions. I know how to handle directions.""</p>
<p>""If you're sure. Well, then. I'll bring in the bags if you want to get a fire started, warm this place up a little?""
</p>
<p>""... sure thing, English..."" Angie cast a wary look at the fireplace.</p>
<p>Peggy looked from Angie's cold flushed face and set jaw, to the fireplace, and back again. Angie didn't look up.</p>
<p>""Need me to teach you how to light a fire, too?""</p>
<p>""Pfff,"" Angie waved a hand distractedly, still not looking up. ""Me? The city girl? I've been lighting giant, open stone fireplaces all my life, I'll be fine.""</p>
<p>Peggy smothered a chuckle and backed out the door to get the bags, leaving Angie to her staring contest. She'd just have to change into pants that could survive a little coal on the knees, then.</p><center><p>#</p></center>
A few hours later, Peggy felt incredibly vindicated and rather amused.
<p>They were tired, cold and hungry - not to mention dirty with coal dust, and Peggy's ribs hurt from laughing so much - by the time Angie finally managing to keep a log lit. Angie's cheek sported a streak of black. Even with the fire still a small, struggling thing, Peggy felt like there was a warm contented glow already radiating out.</p>
<p>""I guess that early dinner's a bust,"" Angie said, forehead creased. ""Sorry.""</p>
<p>""Don't be silly. The whole point of this trip was to make sure you knew where to go and what to do here, I'd say lighting this old smoker is certainly part of that.""</p>
<p>Angie just shrugged, looking forlorn, and the movement quickly turned into a shiver.</p>
<p>""Are you cold?"" Peggy said, sitting up fast and reaching for a nearby rug.</p>
<p>""Don't, we'll get it-""</p>
<p>""Nonsense,"" Peggy said, shuffling forward on her knees until they were pressed together side by side in front of the tiny fire. She flung the rug over Angie's shoulders, and then pulled a corner around her own and leaned in close. ""You're cold. Besides, we can take it outside and shake the dust out before we leave.""</p>
<p>Angie pressed back against Peggy's shoulder and smiled, ""thanks.""</p>
<p>""You're very welcome.""</p>
<p>They sat there quietly while the fire crackled away. Peggy fed more wood into the flames as it grew, until it was big enough (and hot enough) to force them to shuffle further away. Still side by side, now with their backs pressed to the bottom of the lounge and their knees bent up in front of them with the rug over them, Angie eventually turned away from the fire and smiled a very small, happy smile.</p>
<p>""I told you it was lovely in here.""</p>
<p>""I'm glad you like it,"" Peggy said, smiling back. ""Though hopefully you never have to come back.""</p>
<p>""You worry too much-""</p>
<p>""You're my best friend, and with the life I lead...,"" Peggy frowned and twisted her hands together in her lap. ""You shouldn't need to know how to get here at all. Being around me, it puts you in danger and-""</p>
<p>""Stop that,"" Angie commanded softly, reaching over to slip a hand between Peggy's, halting the fidgeting. ""If it does, I'm glad of it. I know you properly now, English. You've got secrets and boltholes all over the city and some outside besides. I'm just honoured you wanted to show me a few.""</p>
<p>Peggy smiled back, reluctant to but helpless in the face of Angie's smiles just as she was starting to realise she always was. Gently, she freed a hand.</p>
<p>""How could I not,"" she said. Then she raised her hand to Angie's face, rubbing gently at the soot on Angie's cheek to disguise the way she was really just tracing the line of a cheekbone. She shouldn't, it was too obvious, but- ""You're very important to me, Angie.""</p>
<p>Angie just gazed back at her silently, eyes searching. Then she covered Peggy's hand on her cheek with one of her own, and leaned into it.</p>
<p>Peggy's breath caught audibly, and she froze.</p>
<p>Angie didn't say anything as they sat there, gazing at each other, but her eyes were sparkling. Then she dropped their hands back to Peggy's lap and slowly leaned forward. She paused, lips almost touching Peggy's, breath warm against her mouth, and waited a moment.</p>
<p>""Angie-,"" Peggy sighed, and felt more than saw Angie's lips stretch into a smile, before they were kissing. </p>
<p>It was just a soft simple press of lips on lips, but Peggy... Her heart was beating fast, she could feel in her chest, and this. This was everything. More than she'd dared hope for.</p>
<p>Angie pulled back with a smile, and shifted around until her head was nestled on Peggy's shoulder and Peggy's arm was around her. ""You're very important to me, too, Peggy,"" she said.</p
<p>Peggy just hugged her tight, and pressed a helpless smile into Angie's hair as they watched the fire burn.</p>

I've always wished Elena and Rebekah got along better in canon. This is my vision of how that works with an Elena who gets her hands a little dirtier a little earlier through non-human necessity, and a Rebekah whose walls are lower without a romantic-history-with-him reason to be jealous over Stefan and Elena and with slightly fewer intra-family threats to make her mistrustful. Plus, to be perfectly honest, I enjoyed implying Derek/Scott via fusion.

Summary: Elena's still focused on the moral and the true. Rebekah's still desperate for true friendship and loyalty. They still clash over everything. But somehow they bend a little more, too.

<lj-cut text=""Three Times Elena and Rebekah Disagreed About The Right Thing To Do (and one thing they found to agree on)"">





<p>""Are you completely out of your tiny little werewolf mind? He's an Argent, a hunter. His family lives for the sole purpose of killing people like us. You can't go with him to Prom for god's sake!""</p>
<p>""Stefan isn't like the rest of them. He's sweet, and kind, and he makes me feel safe. He'd never hurt me,"" Elena replied, dropping her voice into an undertone for the last few words and casting a wary look over her shoulder toward her bustling classmates.</p>
<p>Rebekah huffed. ""That doesn't make it any less of a terrible idea. It's too close to the full moon and your control isn't even near good enough yet. That gym is going to be noisy and stuffy with flashing lights and people constantly bumping into you and-""</p>
<p>""Jeremy will be there, and so will Bonnie and Caroline. They've been great at helping me practice my control and, besides, I'm lucky I even have the option to go. I'm failing everything at school. It's a miracle I'm allowed to go to Prom at all with my grades how they are, thank god my teachers are all so worried about upsetting the town orphan that-""</p>
<p>""That is so not the point! You're not going Elena, if I have to tie you up and sit on you to stop you-""</p>
<p>""I need at least one normal thing in my life right now, Rebekah. I'm going, and I'm not going to let you stop me.""</p>
<p>Rebekah found herself reaching out as if to grab Elena by the arm. She wasn't even sure why, maybe to try and shake some goddamn sense into her. But then the bell was ringing and Elena was pulling out of reach, and all the stupid human teenagers loitering on the steps were starting to stare at them anyway.</p>
<p>Damn her infamous face and last name. </p>
<p>Rebekah still practically looked like a teenager, hell she even remembered how it felt to be one well enough to understand why this was so important to Elena. If everyone didn't already know her as one of the last remaining Hales she'd be tempted sneak in herself. Just to keep Elena safe of course, nothing to do with recreating her own missed Prom, but-</p>
<p>""I don't want to talk about this anymore. I'll see you later, alright? Caroline wants to drive around the woods tonight, see if you and I can't get a lock on the Alpha that way-"" </p>
<p>""What?"" Rebekah was nearly shrieking, mouth dropping open. ""That is also a patently stupid idea! Not to mention reckless, why you listen to her I will never-""</p>
<p>""Later, Rebekah,"" Elena interrupted firmly, shouldering her bag and backing towards the school as the final bell started to ring. </p>
<p>""Elena!""</p>
<p>But she was already disappearing into the school, leaving Rebekah to roll her eyes alone on the fast emptying school steps.</p>
<center><p>#</p></center>
<p>""I'm so sorry, Rebekah,"" Elena said. Her voice sounded like it was breaking with regret, but maybe that was just the blood rushing in Rebekah's ears as the wolfsbane took hold. ""Even if she is the Kanima, Vikki is still Matt's sister. We can't let you kill her.""</p>
<p>Elena carefully directed Rebekah's descent toward the bed as she crumbled, and dragged a pillow down to place under her head. Rebekah could only gaze back helplessly at herself in the mirror as she was settled, unable to look away as blackened veins crept around and up her neck and down her arms - moving away from where Elena had jammed the needle into her back.</p>
<p>""You're going to be fine,"" Elena said as she tucked a blanket in around Rebekah's waist and got back to her feet. ""Bonnie found the recipe in an old lore books, and Alaric double checked it for us with the equipment he keeps down at the clinic to make sure it wouldn't hurt you. It lasts longer than the Kanima venom by at least a few hours so don't panic. You'll be weak for a few days if you try to fight it off early, so just stay here and relax, okay?""</p>
<p>""Elena,"" Rebekah croaked, trying and failing to lift her head or a hand or <i>something</i> to stop Elena walking out the door. </p>
<p>  <i>Wait. Don't go. It's not safe. You don't know what you're up against.</i></p>
<p>""I'm so sorry. I'll come back and check on you after we catch Vikki. I promise.""</p>
<p>Footsteps faded away and a door slammed out of Rebekah's line of vision as she watched just one of her fingers finally twitch and then go still again.</p>
<p> <i>Please. Wait.</i></p>
<center><p>#</p></center>
<p>The argument had gone round and round for hours after Katherine's - or should she say Katerina's - true identity had been revealed, before it inevitably came crashing to a rather rude halt.</p>
<p>""Look, I get that she... tricked you... or whatever,"" Jeremy had started to stay. Clearly the idiot was struggling for a polite way to refer to all of the now somewhat dubious sex Rebekah had been having in the very same loft they were all currently sitting around in.</p>
<p>""Tricked me? Oh just come right out and say it, Gilbert. You think my judgement is impaired because she crept into my bed and played me for a fool. Well she wasn't the first, and with my luck she probably won't be the last, but that's an irrelevant discussion in the face of <i>how incredibly dangerous she is</i>.""</p>
<p>""There has to be another way,"" Elena insisted, voice finally starting to crumble into tones of exasperation. ""Killing isn't the answer!""</p>
<p>Rebekah made a noise of disgust. ""Yes, yes, you're a saintly future True Alpha. I get it. We <i>all</i> get it already. But the world isn't that simple, Elena! We're up against both a Darach and a whole pack of Alphas with no workable battle plan, and it's going to get us all killed.""</p>
<p>""Rebekah, please. Now that we know who she is, maybe-""</p>
<p>""No!"" Rebekah interrupted, launching to her feet. ""Knowing who the Alphas are hasn't helped us because we aren't strong enough to take them down on our own, but for all her power Katherine's at least still human. We might actually have a chance if we throw everything we've got at her-""</p>
<p>Elena's jaw was clenched with frustration, but her eyes were wide and pleading and looking into them made Rebekah wish she could bring herself to waiver. But she could be just as stubborn, and she knew she was right about this.</p>
<p>""-but if we can't use every tool at our disposal then we're utterly outgunned,"" she finished with a sigh. ""And I have zero interest in hanging around Beacon Hills just for us all to get slaughtered in our beds.""</p>
<p>And with that she turned and walked out the door, desperately trying to block out the sound of Elena calling her name. She really needed to find a new apartment, the giant sliding door in this one wasn't nearly satisfying enough to slam behind her.</p>
<p></p><center>
<p>#</p></center>
<p>""You should stay.""</p>
<p>The words hung in the air between them. Rebekah stood poised for flight by the door with one of her bags at her feet, still lying where it had been dropped when Elena had shoved her way into the loft.</p>
<p>""I get that we didn't do it your way and you still don't think we should have trusted Klaus or let Vikki go or any of that, but we're all alive,"" Elena said, hands jammed awkwardly into the back pockets of her jeans as she rocked nervously on the balls of her feet. </p>
<p>""Katherine's gone now but you're still here, and so am I. And I think you should stay... I want you to stay.""</p>
<p><i>Okay</i>. The word hovered on Rebekah's tongue, but instead what came out was, ""Kol's waiting for me downstairs.""</p>
<p>Elena blinked silently for a moment.</p>
<p>""Right,"" she said. ""Kol.""</p>
<p>Like Elena hadn't just watched him wryly excuse himself when she'd walked in the door, grabbing Rebekah's other bag and adding it to his own slung over his shoulder, muttering about girlfriends and drama as he went. Like she hadn't help free him from the bank vault Or watched Rebekah's face go white as she recognized him and then they both watched his eyes turn feral.</p>
<p>""He's my last living sibling, Elena, and he's returning to his pack-""</p>
<p>""I get it,"" she said, tone brusque and eyes now averted. </p>
<p>Rebekah paused, searching Elena's face half hidden behind the fall of her hair. ""I couldn't keep Elijah safe when he returned to Beacon Hills alone and looking for Klaus, but at least I can make sure Kol makes it back to South America in one piece-""</p
<p>""I know, you're right, family is important,"" Elena said. ""Jeremy is everything to me. I understand.""</p>
<p>""-but it's not a very long flight,"" Rebekah continued, taking a step forward. ""All things considered, I'll be back soon.""</p>
<p>Elena's gaze flew back up to meet Rebekah's, eyes wide.</p>
<p>""You're... coming back?""</p>
<p>""I suppose I could be persuaded,"" Rebekah said, twirling a lock of hair around a finger for a moment and then taking a bigger step forward again. ""If you were willing to make it worth my while...?""</p>
<p>Elena moved to meet her part way, one hand rising to touch Rebekah's cheek and a huge smile breaking across her face.</p>
<p>""I'm sure I can think of something,"" she said, seemingly trying for coy but mostly just looking unbearably sunny. Rebekah could already see that spending time with Elena was going to require a whole new kind of endurance for enthusiasm now.</p>
<p>""Well, alright then,"" Rebekah said with a put upon sigh and a small smile of her own. ""I suppose if I must.""</p>
<p>""You must,"" Elena said, nodding earnestly and laughing as she slipped her hand from Rebekah's cheek to the back of her neck and reeled her in for a kiss.</p>

<a href=""http://archiveofourown.org/works/2807939"">Need Want Love has also been posted on Archive of Our Own</a>.

Summary: Berlin wishes people would stop assuming that the only way things are going to end is with a love triangle. Alternate ending to 2x06, pre-Tommy/Irisa/Berlin.

<lj-cut text=""Need Want Love."">




<p>Berlin had a thing for strength. She had never been ashamed to admit that, about herself or about the people she chose to share her life with for a time. Human or alien, man or woman, one person or two or three, all of that was extraneous detail. Strength remained the one non-negotiable in her love life. </p>
<p>She'd seen it in the fire of Irisa's eyes when Berlin challenged her over her weapons at their first meeting. It was always in Nolan when he took to the streets with the lawkeeper's badge on display, and in Amanda's stance day after day, whether she was playing the role of Mayor or Madam. It was even in the sadness on the lines of Tommy's face the first time he looked up at her, face splashed with droplets of soup and surprise colouring his grief.</p>
<p>It was the same strength that she looked for in the mirror, that intangible thing that shimmered when she looked at it and that straightened her spine and lit a fire in her belly. </p>
<p>""You'll just have to trust me,"" he'd said, and the words had hit her like the butt of a gun to the stomach.</p>
<p>Trust. Berlin didn't trust. She knew, she fought, she was completely sure. Trust wasn't a luxury she believed in anymore.</p>
<p>""Amazing,"" she had replied, and then stopped herself, sucking air through her teeth and biting back words. </p>
<p> <i>I hope she's worth it. </i></p>
<p>  <i>I thought we were partners, that we were equals.</i></p>
<p>  <i>I thought you respected me more than this. </i></p>
<p> <i>I see the same beautiful things in her that you do, let me help. </i></p>
<p><i>Let us help her together.</i></p>
<p>""It's amazing to me that you think that response is good enough,"" Berlin snapped, once she'd wrestled her tongue back into submission. </p>
<p>She didn't turn around to grace him with her gaze again, just straightened her back. </p>
<p>""Come find me when you're ready to try that one again,"" she threw over her shoulder as she walked away.</p>
<p>By the time she dropped down on the bar beside Nolan to wait for a drink, Berlin's anger and confusion had simmered back down into weariness. He called her Barbie Doll and she barely blinked, just volleyed the smart arse remarks straight back at him and gave her usual signal for as many shots as the barkeep felt comfortable giving her - it was always a small kind of pleasure when Amanda had stepped away from the bar, the loss of eye candy and intelligent conversation was usually made up for by the more liberal servings of mind bending substances from her staff.</p>
<p>""Where's Tommy?""</p>
<p>""Do I look like his keeper?"" Berlin asked, feeling her lip curl in distaste as she said the word 'keeper'.</p>
<p>""Having that kind of a day, huh?"" Nolan smirked, leaning into her space just a little like he thought he was being subtle. ""Maybe I could help with that.""</p>
<p>Berlin could study people in the finest detail as if through the viewscreen of a camera; she never could understand why people didn't think she'd be able to do the exact same thing outside of camera work as well.</p>
<p>""Maybe. But the faster I drink the sooner it'll be a whole new day, and I drink faster alone,"" she sassed back with a wink, gathering her newly delivered shots and standing up just quickly enough to make him jerk back but not to spill a drop.</p>
<p>""Y'know, I'm pretty sure I could help you with that too,"" Nolan drawled, recovering quickly and then shrugging when she smirked and brushed past him without a response.</p>
<p>She thought she heard him muttering you win some, you lose some as she walked away, but if Berlin was honest she didn't care for much more than blurring away the rest of her disappointing evening. The faster she startss drinking, the faster she could try and forget her entire conversation with Tommy had happened at all.</p>
<p>It took knocking back a few before the edges of things started to blur like she wanted them to, but Berlin got there in the end and then she kept right on going.It was nice in a sordid sort of way, much like many a night was in the NeedWant. The burn of liquid sliding down her throat contrasted with the beautiful women bringining her more drinks and the lovely gauzy fabrics that hid her pain away at her little corner table, protecting her from the other patrons curious gazes.</p>
<p>Leaving her little cocoon of cushions and empty shot glasses was hard, but eventually the bar started to empty out as dawn approached and Berlin felt able to once again square her shoulders and take on the world.</p>
<p>""You gonna be okay to get to work?"" Amanda asked with one eye on Berlin and one on the glass she was polishing as Berlin wavered past the bar toward the door.</p>
<p>Berlin gave a negative noise, and then had to press her lips firmly together and swallow hard for a minute.</p>
<p>""Off duty today,"" she eventually choked out before staggering on, continuing to talk as she went. ""Wouldn't drink... like that... if I wasn't.""</p>
<p>Amanda just chuckled after her as Berlin reached the door and paused to lay her forehead against the smooth surface for a moment, before flinging it open and then startling backward.</p
<p>""You!"" Berlin said, suddenly very proud of herself for slurring only a little.</p>
<p>Irisa didn't answer, just tilted her head assessingly and gazed straight back at her.  If Berlin hadn't been so close, she might have missed the widening of Irisa's eyes in surprise and tightening of muscles in her face and shoulders, like she was bracing for an attack.</p>
<p>Berlin had always admired that about her, even when it infuriated her. That unwavering dismissal of the world around - the beautiful strength behind it.</p>
<p>""It's your fault my head hurts,"" she accused, immediately wincing at her own words and the way her tongue was still loosened with drink before she had even finished speaking.</p>
<p>  <i>Great work there Jessica, real smooth.</i></p>
<p>""Somehow I doubt that,"" Irisa replied flatly, arching a pointed eyebrow at the NeedWant sign above their heads and then moving to brush past Berlin into the bar.</p>
<p>""No, you are."" Berlin flung out a hand and locked it around Irisa's elbow before she could go to far, her head spinning with the sudden movement but determined not to let go. ""I'm not talking about the pending hangover, I can handle myself just fine.""</p>
<p>Irisa wordlessly tried to tug herself out from Berlin's grip, growling under breath when she couldn't free herself easily.</p>
<p>""Let me go,"" she snarled.</p>
<p>""No,"" Berlin snarled back. ""No, we need to talk, and we need to talk now."" Then she planted her free hand in the centre of Irisa's chest and pushed. Hard. Hard enough to shove her inside the bar, past Amanda's surprised exclamation, and into one of the now many empty tables.</p>
<p>""What the hell are you even talking abo-"" </p>
<p>""Shut up, Irisa. I'm talking about Tommy, and about you, and about me.""</p>
<p>Berlin paused long enough to take a seat and rub weary fingers against the headache blooming behind her forehead. Amanda glided over to drop a pitcher of water and two glasses, and then disappeared into the back, and Berlin sighed.</p>
<p>This wasn't the ideal time or place, but then she'd found that ideal was never really much of an option in Defiance.</p>
<p>""I'm talking about whatever the hell happened to make Tommy decide he didn't want to leave anymore. I don't know what went on yesterday, he won't tell me schtako, and I'm telling you right here and right now that that's got to change.""</p>
<p>""... I don't know what you want me to say,"" Irisa finally said, after a long pause. ""You should really talk to Tommy.""</p>
<p>""No,"" Berlin said, dropping her hand down with a sigh and sitting back in her seat. She knew she looked like hell, her hair in disarray, but even on her worst day Berlin knew how to look intimidating when she needed to. ""You both need to talk to me.""</p>
<p>""I don't-""</p>
<p>""Irisa, stop. I'm not...scared, or whatever it is you're thinking, of what you two have together. I want in. I'm smart, adaptable, loyal... and I'm very determined.""</p>
<p>Irisa just blinked back at her.</p>
<p>Berlin sighed in defeat. ""Tommy and I have a good thing going and I'm not willing to give that up, but that doesn't mean this"" she gestured vaguely between them, ""can't work out too.""</p>
<p>Out of the corner of her eye she could see Amanda peering back around the corner, obviously checking if the coast was clear - and that made Berlin grit her teeth and wobble back to her feet. The NeedWant had been good to her, no need to presume on the illusion of privacy when Irisa wouldn't talk back, never would talk back, not without time to think on it and turn it over in from every angle in her mind first.</p>
<p>""This world we live in makes it necessary to keep as many people around us as possible, and I'm a good person to have at your back,"" Berlin said with a final decisive nod. ""Just think about it.""</p
<p>Irisa didn't speak up or follow Berlin out into the steadily rising glare and bustle of the morning, but Berlin didn't expect her too. Hopefully she'd planted a seed, and it would be enough.</p>

<a href=""http://archiveofourown.org/works/1096086"">A Promise for a Sweetheart has also been posted on Archive of Our Own</a>.

Summary: Teresa turns back for a proper farewell.

<lj-cut text=""A Promise for a Sweetheart."">




<p>Betty wiped the tears from her eyes and headed for her room, hurrying to hide herself away from the prying eyes of the other girls coming and going. Their voices were always loud and laughing, and where she'd usually chime in, tonight she couldn't bear it.</p>
<p>Slipping into her room and shutting the door behind her, Betty held her hand to her chest and sighed. It had felt heavy all day, aching away inside her with the knowledge that Teresa was leaving and such a short, public farewell in the common room had done little to ease it.</p>
<p>Betty felt the knock before she heard it, shivering its way through the wood and down her spine.</p>
<p>""Betty?"" Teresa called through the door, her voice low but still clear as a bell. A proper officer's voice, just like always. ""Did you come back up here?""</p>
<p>Teresa was mid-second knock before Betty could fling the door open again, even though it felt like she'd moved quick as the wind in a gale. Teresa's hand was raised, framing her bright if slightly strained smile.</p>
<p>""I couldn't just walk away. I still don't have long but... could I come in for a moment?""</p>
<p>""Absolutely, you can!"" Betty stepped back and dipped her head in an enthusiastic nod. She felt her cheeks heat as Teresa walked into her room, just like they always did no matter how many times she had crossed that threshold.</p>
<p>It would be easy, oh so easy, to forget that they might not ever see each other again. </p>
<p>Betty slipped her hand between the folds of her skirt and pinched her own thigh hard through the material. She couldn't let herself be distracted, she wanted to make the most of every unexpected last second she could steal with Teresa.</p>
<p>""I want you to remember what I said, this really is just the beginning for you,"" Teresa said, trailing her fingers across Betty's bedroom wall before seeming to come back to herself and straighten her spine, hands back by her side. ""But I couldn't walk away without a proper goodbye...""</p>
<p>She trailed off, every inch the soldier alert and waiting for Betty's response like Betty would be issuing orders, but her eyes were warm and the corners of lips were raised.</p>
<p>Betty heard a desperate, hungry sort of a sound come out of her own mouth as she kicked the door shut, and then she was flinging herself across the room, cradling Teresa's face in her hands and kissing her like she'd wanted to do in the common room. Properly kissing her, like she was underwater and Teresa was fresh air, like she might never kiss her again.</p>
<p>""Please,"" Betty said helplessly against her lips as she felt Teresa's hands come up to pull Betty's away from her face, ""please, please-""</p>
<p>Teresa made a gentle reassuring noise, still kissing Betty back. She didn't push Betty away like Betty had feared, but tangled their fingers together and brought their hands down by their sides. </p>
<p>""Just need to watch the cap,"" she laughed a little, ""wouldn't want to be giving anyone ideas now would we?""</p>
<p>It was all Betty wanted to do: give people ideas. If Teresa had to walk away from her, it was all she had in her to let Teresa do it without letting everyone know that she'd been Betty's. She wasn't going to be anymore, but she had been. </p>
<p>The part of her that wavered in the face of what other people might think shivered in horror at the thought, but for a moment it was like she was on the dance floor again, with Teresa warm in her arms and her cheek pressed tight against Betty's. Besides which, most of her was too busy already grieving Teresa's leaving to care.</p>
<p>So instead of taking to the rooftops, she pushed the feeling aside once again and pulled Teresa in by their joined hands and kissed her goodbye with every ounce of feeling she felt like she had crammed inside her body, fairly thrumming as it was with her grief and her love now that they were safe behind closed doors.</p>
<p>Finally, though, Teresa pulled away once again and Betty had to reluctantly let her go. </p>
<p>""I really do need to leave,"" Teresa said, breathless with another sad laugh in her voice, leaning in with her forehead resting against Betty's. ""But I am going to miss you.""</p>
<p>Betty felt her mouth contort as she tried to swallow back words - don't go, stay, stay with me, come back to me - but finally she repeated Teresa's words back to her. </p>
<p>She would miss her too, like a great big gaping hole in her chest where her heart used to beat. Betty didn't want someone new, or the old familiar uncertainty and loneliness of guessing and looking, she just wanted Teresa here by her side like she was right now. Solid and real and in Betty's arms.</p>
<p>""You'll turn pretty girls heads for me while I'm gone, won't you?"" Teresa whispered finally, when Betty didn't say anything more, a funny sort of parody of a soldier man leaving his girl behind but with all the wrong promises. It made Betty ache.</p>
<p>""I don't know if I can do that,"" she said with a biting chuckle. Betty shrugged a shoulder and moved to pull away, but Teresa held fast to where their hands were still anchored together.</p>
<p>""Honey, you can,"" Teresa insisted fiercely, ducking her head to follow Betty, to force her to meet her eyes. ""You can, and you will, and you're going to have a beautiful life with someone after I'm gone. Promise me?""</p>
<p>Betty bit her lip and shook her head. ""That's not fair, you can't make me promise that,"" she choked out.</p>
<p>""I can, and I will,"" Teresa said, eyes just as wide as Betty's felt. She leaned in to kiss her once more, quick and hard, and repeated the words against Betty's lips - <i>promise me</i>.</p>
<p>She did it again, and again, a kiss and those words, and again, until Betty broke down and flung her arms around Teresa's shoulders, burying her face against Teresa's uniform.</p>
<p>""I'll try,"" was all she said, struggling not to cry into her.</p>
<p>""Well, then I'm satisfied. I know you can do anything you try your hand at.""</p>
<p>This time when Teresa pulled away, she reached out and caressed Betty's face with her hand, wiping away a tear as it spilled down her cheek.</p>
<p>""I'm glad I came back to kiss you one last time,"" she whispered into the quiet of her room, and then she dropped her hand, straightened her clothes, and turned back towards the door. ""Goodbye, Betty.""</p>
<p>Then she was gone, and it was all Betty could do to stagger to her bed and collapse on the edge, tears overwhelming her. She let herself cry, just for long enough to be sure that Teresa was clear of the building, that she wasn't coming back for another heart wrenching kiss. Then Betty took a deep breath, slipped out to the bathroom to wash her face, and strode back out into the night.</p>
<p>It still ached and then the brisk evening air stung her eyes where she'd been crying and made it feel worse, but she had a promise to keep and she couldn't start on that till she'd at least sorted out apologizing to Mrs Corbett.</p>

"event","I haven't done this in aaaaages, and it always seems like a fun thing to do. Here's some stuff I hope to do a bit more of in 2016, mostly for my own mulling over and future reference.

<lj-cut text=""NYR 2016"">
1. Write more - I have a <span style='white-space: nowrap;'><a href='http://ladiesbingo.dreamwidth.org/profile'><img src='http://s.dreamwidth.org/img/silk/identity/community.png' alt='[community profile] ' width='16' height='16' style='vertical-align: text-bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;' /></a><a href='http://ladiesbingo.dreamwidth.org/'><b>ladiesbingo</b></a></span> <a href=http://shopfront.dreamwidth.org/363405.html>card</a> to complete by March, and I'm signing up for <span style='white-space: nowrap;'><a href='http://inkingitout.dreamwidth.org/profile'><img src='http://s.dreamwidth.org/img/silk/identity/community.png' alt='[community profile] ' width='16' height='16' style='vertical-align: text-bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;' /></a><a href='http://inkingitout.dreamwidth.org/'><b>inkingitout</b></a></span> for original fiction because I am sorely out of the habit of writing. Nano style word count not quality approaches have often helped me get past writing blocks, let's try it once more! (note to self: <span style='white-space: nowrap;'><a href='http://trobadora.dreamwidth.org/profile'><img src='http://s.dreamwidth.org/img/silk/identity/user.png' alt='[personal profile] ' width='17' height='17' style='vertical-align: text-bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;' /></a><a href='http://trobadora.dreamwidth.org/'><b>trobadora</b></a></span> has a daily writing challenge thing that's cool: <a href=http://trobadora.livejournal.com/575099.html>one sentence a day</a>.)

2. Schedule - I need to get a bit better about carving out a routine. I always like budgeting because I never have to think about where my money goes, and I'm getting a bit weary of working out where my time should ideally be going.

3. Cooking - I love cooking, but I sometimes bog myself down with being overly ambitious and wanting to always cook new things. I need to strip my cooking back to basics and focus on regularly making good, nourishing, easy food instead of bouts of fancy cooking vs. no cooking.

4. Photography - a specific thing I want to carve out some weekly time to focus on.

5. Re-learning piano - another thing I want to carve time out for.

6. Mindful spending - I'm generally very good at money, but between the wedding and a bit of re-prioritizing my time/lifestyle choices lately I think I need to get a bit comfy with actually spending money. Particularly on big ticket items. I need a new laptop for writing and media work and I want to hire a decent weighted keyboard and maybe eventually buy one, and I need to not feel guilty about spending that money.

Edit: 7. I totally forgot to put physical activity on here *facepalm* that's so promising! :/ things I would like to try and get back into: archery, swimming, long scenic walks/mini hikes. I also really need to do my damn physio exercises more often.

Not resolutions but notes to myself of things I might also like to try and do more of: knitting, playing games, reading, having people over for dinner, visiting areas of Sydney I've not been to, weekend markets, weekends away, eating down my freezer/pantry, getting a little more organised (at the very least my pantry/linen cupboards and also alphabetising my books properly), and maybe volunteering at a library or something similar.

"event","<lj-cut text=""General notes."">Dear Yuletide author, I'm so excited to read what you write for me! If past trends hold true, this will be a rambly, long post. I hope it answers everything you need it to answer, and please feel free to only take from it what is useful (excepting the squicks and triggers bits of course)! These are the characters and fandoms of my heart, and I want you to write the best story you have in <i>your</i> heart, even if it doesn't tick off a bunch of stuff here. I can't wait to read your story no matter what shape it takes!



To quickly get the must haves out of the way...

<b>Triggers:</b> as mentioned in my sign up optional details please don't delve into character death, mental illness, or suicide/self-harm. The only exception is where this is a part of canon (eg. people frequently die in Vampire land!) but please don't dwell - no main character death, no grief, no sadness. A girl with teeth might gotta eat, but I'd rather not risk triggering by reading about the negative side effects of eating people to death if that's okay.

<b>Squicks/Dislikes:</b> these are a smidge more flexible of course because they're squicks not triggers but generally speaking I dislike - unhappy endings, homophobia, sexism, gendered violence, dysfunctional/harmful romantic relationships, cheating, women deprived of agency, stories that focus all or primarily on the dudes in these characters lives (there's just so much media out there for that already), a plot focus without any accompanying emotional exploration.



Now some general notes on what I do like!

<b>Fic categories:</b> basically anything, please take your pick! Whether you're writing gen, femslash, het, or multi-ship, I'm basically all about the female characters. I'm down with high ratings if you like to write explicit stuff, but I am equally down with G rated platonic or fluff fic, so please aim for wherever you're most comfortable on the rating scale.

<b>Multi-ship:</b> I'm thumbs up on poly, threesome, triads, and etc. so if you would like to write my requested characters together in a way that doesn't contradict background canon relationships, or add another female character into the mix for extra femslash fun, then by all means bi and/or poly it up! I'd prefer a minimal focus if any on het/boyslash relationships if you're not down with femslash though (except for where I've specifically talked about het - ie. Vivian/Gabriel), just to keep the focus on the female characters and friendships.

<b>Crossovers/fusions:</b> I'm not huge on crossovers and merging characters from multiple canons (exception: when it's to ship multiple kickarse women, if you write femslash feel free to play with crossovers too) but I do love fusions! If you know any of the following (or see something about a particular fandom elsewhere in my tags/blog that you'd like to add), please feel free to fusion it up. I'm currently/always super into Teen Wolf, Agent Carter, Agents of SHIELD, Doctor Who, Stargate: Atlantis, Arrow, The Vampire Diaries, The Obernewtyn Chronicles, Dark Angel, The 100, Smallville, Legend of the Seeker, Carmilla (web series), and a bunch of other fantasy/Sci-fi stuff. Largely what interests me is the what if ripple effect - if you transplant one set of characters into another canon, what changes? It's kind of the subtle character exploration, plus questioning whether it would impact plot points, if you switched one set of characters for another that intrigues me.

Having said all that - if you're not into crossovers or fusions that is a-okay! I've included notes on each fandom for it, but please please feel free to disregard if it isn't your thing.

<b>Tropes/content:</b> make-outs and/or feelings, cute AUs (coffeeshop, human AU, and etc. I couldn't begin to list all the AU scenarios I didn't expect to love until I read a fic with them, so feel free to play), strong female friendships, women kicking arse, dorky awkward characters, smart characters, magic and myth and space and related fun fantasy/scifi stuff, superheroes, missing scenes that add new layers of complexity to canon, characters growing in confidence, women who kick arse (sometimes literally), women who support each other, look basically just all women all the time because women are awesome.

I also like partial canon rewrites/alternate universes/alternate endings/what if they didn't meet until later on/etc., historic fic (think like old old though, like ancient Celts or Rome or people in castles and stuff like that. Although I do have a soft spot for the 1920's too...), getting together stories (as friends or romantically), slice of everyday life, comic/romantic misunderstandings, and all those cute ridiculous things like magically bound together, forced to share a bed, fake relationships, people think we're dating but we're not - this can work either way for hilarious gen or for shipping, time travel,
and so on.



</lj-cut>
<lj-cut text=""Blood & Chocolate"">
<b>Blood & Chocolate -- Vivian</b>
This was one of my absolute favourite books growing up. I love basically everything about Vivian and her story, from the way she dropped all those stupid anvil hints about being a werewolf, to the rebellion against the pack and family and wanting to forge her own path, to the hilarious messed up revenge of tearing apart the pink bedroom in wolf form, to her joy of running in her wolf skin. Not to mention the yearning for love and friendship, the strength to show up even when she was ostracized by her schoolmates, the way she laughed in the face of the being chosen for the ritual even when she was terrified inside, and the way she fought so hard and took risks toward the end. I even loved the way she struggled with the half shift, and the cathartic painting.

Gabriel/Vivian is something I have mixed feels about. I was so very down for it, I shipped it massively and it was my OTP for ages, but as I've gotten older I've developed some problems with it. I quite liked that he protected her, that he was generally respectful, that he helped without forcing. But I now don't like the potential forced relationship implications with everyone insisting that they were meant to be, and some of the way that implies some gendered messed up power dynamics particularly the heteronormativity of that ritual with the women fighting women and men fighting men. I also don't want Vivian to be property, and the pack definitely treats her like that at times. I don't think the book resolved that particular issue very successfully. I still love that this book is significantly less messed up on this front than a lot of other books in the genre, but it's also by no means flawless either,

I'd love to see gen fic about her building her life how she wants it and finding a balance between her early dreams and including the pack after the end of the book. I want to see more of her running with the boys again, and more of pack life when they're happy and settled. I'd love to see more women in the pack so her friend group could expand a little. I'd also be down with an AU that respects her early choices, and allows her to build a successful future with a human (this could be a great spot for an AU or crossover/fusion with another werewolf or supernatural canon that does that better) - be it the same highschool relationship or someone new (bonus points for femslash!) - and what they choice would mean for her life. I'd be very happy with fic that's Gabriel/Vivian and maybe deals with some of the issues above to reframe the positive bits without the negatives, or something that inverts the issues somehow - I would so love a genderswap femslash AU with Gabriel(le) as a big tough leather wearing bike riding dyke if you're down for that. Or maybe you could re-write the pack leadership system as matriarchal, or maybe Vivian rewrites it herself because even if she fell for Gabriel anyway it was kinda messed up that everyone tried to push them like that. Feel free to be creative! If you're down with femslash I'd so love a bisexual Vivian with an OFC or a character from another fandom in basically any setting you could choose from, and Vivian as the centre of a poly arrangement ith Vivian/Gabriel and Vivian/female character would also be awesome.

AUs/crossovers/fusions could also be an ideal way to do Gabriel/Vivian without some of the gendered power dynamic issues that are often implied to some degree in werewolf romance novels, too. I'd love to see particularly anything with another similar fandom like Teen Wolf, The Originals, Carmilla, or anything like that.




</lj-cut>
<lj-cut text=""The Originals."">
<b>The Originals -- Hayley, Rebekah</b>
The tldr; version here is: I love Rebekah doing basically anything at all, and I love Hayley whenever they're not bogging her down in doomed het storylines. 

I would adore any femslash of these two or gen of them setting up house with baby Hope without the rest of their dysfunctional family. The wolf husband would maybe be okay to tag along in the second scenario, he's the least offensive romantic option to me. I also adore Elijah but seriously dislike Elijah/Hayley and his weird protectionistic masochistic streak when in a relationship with anyone ever, so if you can gen him in feel free but please no Hayley related tension or shipping. Marcel intrigues me, but again I've prefered his other romantic interests or his platonic relationships eg. with Devina to the weird half broken on off thing with Rebekah.

Hayley has had so many awesome moments in TVD and The Originals. I love her best when she's snarky and amoral and looking out for her own best interests, I feel like the show likes to sweep that away a bit whenever they write romance into her life, which is such a shame. Rebekah I always want to simultaneously wrap in bubble wrap and set loose to terrorize her enemies - I also don't actually think she'd be happier as a human, I think she just needs to get the hell away from Klaus and all his damage.

I'd be very down for an AU or fusion here, but preferably not one that humanises Rebekah too much. I quite like her vampire side, and I'd like that power/difference maintained in some way - maybe she's a superhero, a seriously powerful business executive, a (hilariously) werewolf or banshee or something else supernatural in another canon, a spy, etc. You could also do magical time travel (or AU this somehow) because I particularly love how much Rebekah loves the 1920's, if historic fic rocks your boat. Hayley would make a great flapper.

The Originals is a fandom I've requested before, so if you would like to know more please feel free to explore my journal. It's been pretty inactive so you'll see dear creator letters for Yuletide and other exchanges pretty quickly.



</lj-cut>
<lj-cut text=""Saving Hope."">
<b>Saving Hope -- Sydney, Maggie</b>
Oh Maggie, she's so adorable! And Sydney is so cute! I'm going to assume you're down with femslash if we matched on this, because it's part of their canon relationship, but I'd also be happy with gen for one or both of them, or with them and other female characters.

I love Maggie's flaws and her nerves and her excited triumphs and how much she cares about things. I also really love her friendship with Alex (and I'm totally down with shipping them too). Sydney we don't know as much about, I'm not very familiar with her faith and how that intersects for her with her sexuality but I'd be interested to see that explored. I also just love her dynamic with Maggie, and how surprised she was when Sydney made a move, it was super cute. Essentially everything I love about this is super cute.

One thing I would like to see explored, too, is Maggie's sexuality. Sydney obviously has her conflicts, but this was all pretty new to Maggie. I'd prefer it not get swept off as casual experimentation, it was too organic on screen for me to buy that, but what would realizing she's bi mean for her? Or (probably more likely) for other people, given Maggie just kind of rolls with stuff sometimes. If you are interested in some Maggie/Sydney, Maggie/Alex, perhaps that could be a stepping stone - Maggie's confused and wondering and Alex reveals past same sex relationships and Maggie finds herself wondering about them.

As far as AUs/crossovers, I don't have anything particular in mind here. I watch things like Grey's and Saving Hope for drama, not the medicine, so a non-medicine AU or fusion could be interesting!

Note: I haven't been watching recent episodes/season, but I don't care about spoilers so - make it understandable even if I've missed some stuff but otherwise don't stress abut referring to later canon. Basically.

Because <span style='white-space: nowrap;'><a href='http://femslashex.dreamwidth.org/profile'><img src='http://s.dreamwidth.org/img/silk/identity/community.png' alt='[community profile] ' width='16' height='16' style='vertical-align: text-bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;' /></a><a href='http://femslashex.dreamwidth.org/'><b>femslashex</b></a></span> has gone live and I have been gifted the most wonderful thing and everyone ever needs to read it so they too can bask in the glory of this story. It's women and world building and subtly layering AU consistency over canon consistency and ladies kissing and I know we've all missed Xena. Here's a chance for you to go revisit it, I promise it'll be worth it.

I am always so blessed when people write me my tiny little headcanon pairing for my really old fandom, and this fic is no different. I can't put more words around how awesome this story is without spoiling the good bits, but it's 14k of glorious Amazons. By which I mean 14k of awesome. Read it.

<a href=""http://archiveofourown.org/works/4913623""><strong>Pathways</strong></a> (14285 words) by Anonymous<br />Chapters: 1/1<br />Fandom: <a href=""http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Xena:%20Warrior%20Princess"">Xena: Warrior Princess</a><br />Rating: Mature<br />Warnings: No Archive Warnings Apply<br />Relationships: Ephiny/Gabrielle (Xena)<br />Characters: Gabrielle (Xena), Ephiny, Various Amazons<br />Additional Tags: Developing Relationship, Smut, Amazons - Freeform<br />Summary: <p>An AU that retells <i>Hooves and Harlots</i> in a world in which the Warrior Princess never saved Gabrielle and the other Potadeian girls from the slavers.</p>
(Sacrilege, I have no Xena icons. People on LJ will maybe I think just see Allison, but for context my icon on DW is LotS in honor of its status as the bastard stepchild of Xena. Also I really need an Amazon icon, what's wrong with past me and her icon choices seriously...)

I ended up writing three fics for it, so if anyone wants to play the guess the anonymous author game:
2 are from fandoms I've written or requested in the past year, 1 was from a fandom I wrote before that.
1 was a pairing I've written before, 2 weren't.
1 has a single fandom listed, 2 have double fandoms.
All 3 are under 3k.
All are tame on the ratings scale.

If anyone's (partially) right and on DW, I shall bestow some DW points after reveals. Or write you a ficlet or something, your choice.

"event","One day I will go back and crosspost my Yuletide fic and do a thing that isn't a random babbly non-fandom post, but today is not that day. Meme, letter from <span style='white-space: nowrap;'><a href='http://frayadjacent.dreamwidth.org/profile'><img src='http://www.dreamwidth.org/img/silk/identity/user.png' alt='[personal profile] ' width='17' height='17' style='vertical-align: text-bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;' /></a><a href='http://frayadjacent.dreamwidth.org/'><b>frayadjacent</b></a></span>.

Something I hate: Sub-ordinates! No not really, just today, I have had a heck of a week at work so far. The kind that makes one regret accepting a management role, blah. 'xcuse me while I bury myself in fic instead.

Something I love: Superheroes! Sci fi! Strawberries! Silverbeet (well, baby leaf at least)! Strong women, wait what that totally counts as an s and not a w! *cough*

Somewhere I've been: The Sunshine Coast, which is a spot in Queensland Australia nearish the Gold Coast and Great Barrier Reef parts of Aus if you're not familiar. Most of my childhood holidays were spent on the Gold or Sunshine Coast at the theme parks or the reef or on a beach/in a pool, so I have very fond memories of it.

Somewhere I'd like to go: Scotland! Oh to visit the England/Ireland/Scotland/Wales, I just want to go everywhere and see all of your castles and your green hills and your not-arid-landscapes and your quaint everything and your awesome history andandand. I narrowly missed out on funding to do a short term work project in Scotland last year and I was gutted. It was a long shot to begin with, but I got so much closer than I expected to winning the grant and then it was <em>so much more disappointing</em>, haha.

Someone I know: An invaluable co-worker has a name beginning with S and is one my handful of workplace rocks right now. Blah work and etc, but she's pretty cool.

A film I like: To lazily draw on my fandom list from on here... Secretary, Sense and Sensibility (1995), St Trinians, Sunshine Cleaning, oh gosh I'm not enough of a film buff to have a stand out favourite, I just tend to like a bunch of random things I see.

A book I like: Stone Key and Sending, both part of the Obernewtyn series by Isobelle Carmody. These were some of the most formative books of my childhood - well the early books, these came out later she takes a million years to publish anything - and I remain a devoted servant of Elspeth too this day. Funnily enough another formative Australian series of my childhood was the Silver Brumby by Elyne Mitchell, which I cannot recommend enough if you like wistful fantastical talking animals and would also like to read about the Australian bush. I have spent most of my life grumbling about the difficulty tracking them down after reading secondhand and terribly old damaged copies (they were first published in the 50s and didn't have a print run for ages while I was growing up) when I was young but they recently republished anniversary combined editions and I was so incredibly thrilled.

Summary: When Emma gets stopped trying to sneak into an event in that sexy red dress, and Regina needs some arm candy, it's a perfect match. Journalist!AU, fake dating.

""Oh hell no,"" Emma muttered under her breath when a firm hand hooked her elbow and pulled her out of the crowd. 

It was the biggest event of the year, and inside were countless political and business players just begging to be featured in a story by <em>Emma Swan, new reporter for the Storybrooke Daily Mirror.</em>

Plastering her biggest, dumbest smile on her face, Emma gazed up at the black suited security guard and subtly cocked a hip to make the skirt of her best red dress ride up a little further. ""Yes?""

""Name?""

""Mary,"" Emma offered after a beat, batting her eyelashes a little. Inside she gussed loudly over not having an alias name ready for security, but her smile never slipped. It was such a rookie mistake, she was better than that and it was probably going to cost her a story. Goddammit.

""Last name?"" was all the guard intoned flatly in response.

""Oh come on now,"" Emma smirked, and leaned in to flash some boob and press her hand against the man's chest. ""I don't need a last name, you can't really tell me you don't recognise me?""

The guard looked down at her hand, and then calmly grasped her by the wrist and pushed her away. 

The corner of her lip turned down into a tiny frown as he pressed his hand against his ear piece and repeated her fake name, as well as a brief physical description, and then listened intently.

Clearly her seduction skills had gotten a little rusty.

Sighing, Emma turned her head to watch at the crowd inching up the path and through the big double doors she'd been aiming for herself. She'd been so damn close. Carefully she noted down who was arriving as she waited, whether they were newsworthy, and who they were speaking to as they went. 

It wasn't much more than any reporter lackey behind the red tape could see. But if all she managed to get out of this damn dress was a closer glimpse of the handshakes and initial wheeling and dealings of the city's powerful, it would just have to do.

The guard spoke into his head set sporadically for a long time, long enough for Emma to visually sweep the slow moving crowd multiple times and then get bored. 

Emma gently tugged on her trapped hand, and then sighed when the guard didn't release his grip even a little bit. She looked around again, this time more casually, seeking anything interesting or out of place. A few new faces joined the back of the crowd, and she filed them away in her head.

Then she stopped, blinked, and frowned. A woman was gazing straight back at her from just inside the doorway, clad in sleek black with hair to match and an inscrutable expression on her face.

""Right. You're not on the guest list, so you'll have to leave"" the guard said, interrupting Emma's staring match and beginning to march her back towards the kerb.

""Wait,"" Emma cried. ""You don't-""

""Excuse me."" The silky voice cut through the noise of the crowd effortlessly, stopping them both dead in their tracks.

The guard straightened his shoulders noticeably, and tightened his grip on Emma. ""Ms Mills,"" he said, voice as stiff as his back.

""Sorry to interrupt, Graham."" 

It was the woman who had been watching. Emma gaped a little as she took in the smooth bounce of her curls and red of her lips up close, and the slightly terrifying smile that was spreading across her lips. 

""I see you've bailed up my date, so I'm afraid I'll have to take her off your hands. If you don't mind...?""

She offered an arm to Emma as she spoke, as slick as anything despite both of Emma's arms still being trapped at her sides by the security guard. Not that they were for long, as the woman sharply raised an eyebrow in query and the guard sprang back a step.

""I didn't realise,"" he said, manfully attempting to mask a discomfort that made Emma's inner reporter sit up and twitch. On the outside, however, she only subtly tugged her hemline back into place and edged towards her saviour. ""My apologies.""

Ms Mills inclined her head, and then turned her back on him completely. Her full attention was now pinned on Emma, who under the force of that gaze found herself busily resisting the urge to either defiantly raise her chin or melt back into the crowd.

""Shall we, my dear?"" She leaned in to murmur in Emma's ear, arm still aloft for Emma to hold.

And Emma Swan, who all at once wanted both a big byline and to see how long it might take to mess up the lines of that black dress or that perfect lipstick, breathed deep and reached out to take her arm.

<center>*</center>

The room they walked into was cavenous and sparkling, and despite her best intentions to stay focused on the job, Emma caught herself feeling a little overwhelmed by all the glitz.

""What do you think? Is it too much?"" the woman by her side asked, cutting through Emma's daze with a smug quirk of her lips that clearly stated she thought it was perfect exactly as it was. ""I asked for tasteful, discrete even, but there's just no stopping some people.""

<em>No stopping you,</em> Emma thought, but when she opened her mouth something entirely different came out. ""It looks amazing, Ms... Mills, was it?""

""Call me Regina,"" she said, pulled Emma close to whisper conspiratorily in her ear while she nodded polite hellos to other attendees. Her hand slipped from Emma's arm to grip her firmly by the waist as she guided them through the crowd. ""You are supposed to be my date to the ball, after all.""

Her breath brushed the curve of Emma's ear with each word, making her shiver, which in turn made Regina's lips quirk up further.

If Emma was honest with herself, she hadn't really considered the logistics when she'd grasped hold of Regina like a drowning swimmer grasped a lifebuoy. But if she had, Emma wouldn't have expected to spend the rest of the evening by Regina's side. What would Regina want with a sparsley clothed, somewhat uncouth woman at a polished social event like this one?

Sure, Emma could be charming. She was counting on it to ferret out a story or two, after all. But she usually only sustained it for short periods of time, and she fully expected Regina to get bored and cut her adrift. 

Just hopefully without calling security back to collect her.

But for some reason, she didn't. They spent the evening swinging between one group of important people and another (and another), introducing Emma as Regina's partner with each new greeting. 

Many people that she'd only previously seen in photos and their names in print included her in small pleasantries and confidences. So much so that she quickly found total strangers nodding hello to her during the short stretches she was apart from Regina.

Each time they swung close to the restrooms as they traversed the huge room, Emma slipped away. She shut herself in a stall and hurridly scrawled down everything she could remember in the tiny notebook she had tucked into her garter, then flushed the toilet and checked her hair before diving back into the throng.

""I just can't keep hold of you, can I?"" Regina had murmured after her third disappearance.

After that Regina had made sure to only steer them around the centre of the room. Emma had tried to excuse herself on the pretext of going to the bar to collect drinks for them both, but Regina had pinned her in place with an intent stare and imperiously beckoned over one of the wait staff instead.

""I can't bear to spend a minute without her,"" she'd laughed to their current circle of gossipy socialites.

Her eyes were fixed on Emma's lips and her hand caressed the small of Emma's back as she spoke, and for a moment the room just faded away. 

Emma'd had to shake her head to clear it, and then blush obligingly (and wasn't it a good thing Regina was still staring at her so intently, as if she wanted to eat Emma up like one of the many tiny, delicious canapes on offer) like she was shy and bashful instead of off her game and distracted.

It was everything she could have hoped for, and more than she'd dared to expect. Except for the way that Regina would then swing her off to greet someone else before she could properly grill the last person.

She had so many notes, but nothing of substance. 

There was nothing ground breaking, only fluff for an event piece in the social pages. She almost suspected Regina of doing it deliberately, like she knew what Emma was up to.... 

But then someone else was asking how they met and remarking on how delightful they looked together, and it slipped her mind in favour of clinging closer to Regina's side and smiling.

A cover was a cover after all, especially one as good as Regina Mills, well known yet reclusive planner of all important events in Storybrooke. And if she smelt nice pressed along Emma's side, what of it? It was a hard job, but someone did have to do it.

<center>*</center>

The party seemed to break up while Emma wasn't looking, quickly leaving them in a half empty room that was beginning to look a little worse for wear. 

""It was a pleasure seeing you tonight,"" Regina was saying, shaking hands and farewelling yet more people, before turning back to Emma with a satisfied sigh. After a beat, she peered slyly over her shoulder and then grabbed Emma's hand. ""Think we can sneak away without being seen?""

Without waiting for a response, she started for an out of the way corner, tugging Emma along behind her.

""Are you sure you don't need to say goodbye to anyone else?"" Emma asked with a laugh and a longing look back at prominent businessman Mr Gold who was still lingering at the bar. She hadn't even had a chance to say hello.

""No, I think we've spoken to quite enough people for one night,"" Regina replied, and then veered sharply behind a large decorative plant, nearly tugging Emma clear off her feet.

Emma staggered with a yelp, only to find herself firmly caught in Regina's arms, with one of Regina's hands across her mouth the muffle her cry.

""Not to worry, Ms Swan,"" she whispered, eyes sparkling. ""I've got you.""

Emma's heart was pounding in her chest; she felt sure that Regina would be able to hear it, they were so close. As close as they'd been all evening, but somehow without the constant burble of chit chat and the clink of glasses over the top of everything, it felt much more intimate.

""I feel like I'm 13 and hiding at a school dance,"" Emma confessed quietly as she regained her footing.

""I know, it's delightful.""

Emma ducked her head and peered through the leaves of their obliging plant cover. ""Are you sure you want to risk being seen back here with me, won't people talk?"" she joked, fingers clenching and unclenching at Regina's side.

""And what would they talk about? I'm simply enjoying the end of a successful evening with my beautiful date, who I've been telling everyone has been the light of my life these last few months. It's hardly a recipe for scandal, now is it?""

""I don't..."" Emma started, and then stopped herself. She could feel the edge of her notebook digging into her thigh at an awkward angle from the way she was pressed into the little niche Regina had found, but it somehow didn't seem so important in the moment.

""Don't what, Ms Swan?"" Regina prompted gently.

Emma raised her eyes to meet Regina's gaze head on, determined not to falter this time. She was a journalist, not a mouse, after all.

""I don't understand why you stopped them kicking me out.""

Regina smiled softly and raised a hand to tuck Emma's hair gently behind her ear.

""I like beautiful things,"" she said, ""and you, <em>Emma</em>, are a beautiful thing.""

"event","It's 3.5 hours to New Year here in Australia, and I am safely esconed with friends and vodka so happy new year before I get too pissed to post without embarrassment, heh. It's been an awesome year, I moved in with my girl early in 2012 and got an awesome job with a non-profit for a cause really close to my heart, so this year has been amazeballs and I can't wait to see what 2013 has in store for me. I hope you're all looking forward to farewelling the year as well!

It's awesome coming back to fandom too, I've had so much joy from easing back in here and doing the exchange thing, and it's lovely to have you all here to say hello to again. I look forward to getting to know the new people I've found on DW from that friending meme as well! Thanks for making my fannish life awesome again these last few months, it's been great <3

Happy new year everyone!

"event","<lj-cut>Make a post (public, friends/access locked, filtered, whatever you're comfortable with) to your LJ. The post should contain your list of 10 holiday wishes. The wishes can be anything at all, from simple and fandom-related (""I'd love a Snape/Hermione icon that's just for me"") to medium (""I wish for _____ on DVD"") to really big (""All I want for Christmas is a new car/computer/house/TV."") The important thing is, make sure these wishes are things you really, truly want.

If you wish for real life things (not fics or icons), make sure you include some sort of contact info in your post, whether it's your address or just your email address where Santa (or one of his elves) could get in touch with you.

Also, make sure you post some version of these guidelines in your LJ so that the holiday joy will spread.




1. Fanworks, particularly women or femslash-centric things, fill my life with glee. For more info you can see <a href=""http://fandom-stocking.dreamwidth.org/348390.html"">my fandom stocking post</a> or <a href=""http://shopfront.dreamwidth.org/500.html?#cutid2"">my giant list of my fandoms and ships</a>. This especially goes for fan mixes (need new musics, yes), and vids! I still clap so happily over a good vid, so if you can rec or make vids for my favourite fandoms, that'd be particularly awesome. 

2. Yarn! I have the urge to take knitting back up next year as a stress outlet during semester. Send me things directly, place an order online on my behalf, give me a gift voucher to somewhere I can order it, whatever floats your boat.

3. They say experiences make us happier than stuff. I have a <a href=""http://www.redballoon.com.au/"">RedBalloon</a> wish list, if anyone on my access/flist is interested in seeing it let me know (it's under my RL name), or maybe you can think of a creative way to engineer something experience-y.

4. A treadmill desk. I came across this concept while researching at work, and am fascinated by it. It could be a great way to stay moving while studying/reading/fandoming. If anyone is handy and can give their time to coach/advise me on how to create something reasonably cheap but sturdy myself, that would also be awesome!

5. A tripod. I took up photography while I was away from fandom, and it's awesome.

6. Photography related learnings... I want to take another community college course once I find the money, or perhaps there's an awesome photography network or centre that I'd find membership of beneficial, or an awesome book or online resource you can recommend. If anyone has experience and would want to give me free feedback or individualized advice, that'd be very cool. (Fair warning, I took one intro course and I imagine I'm still very much a beginner but anyone's standards!)

7. DW recs, I've been absent for awhile and things got quiet outside tumblr, huh. Know any awesome active people? Send their names my way! Or <a href=""http://kouredios.dreamwidth.org/226094.html?thread=1582894#cmt1582894"">I'm on the recent DW friending meme</a> if you want to have them to come to me themselves.

8. New games. I've been hooked on The Sims for years, Pokemon on and off, more recently fell in love with Rune Factory again, and adore all the little time management games like Ranch Rush and Time Builder's on iPad. Recommendations welcome!

9. Derek/Stiles related everything, I'm a total addict. 

10. Help out someone experiencing mental distress, which is a topic dear to my heart because it can be even more important around the holidays. There's so many ways you could do this:
- working for a non-profit has made me even more aware of how helpful long-term competent volunteers are, if you want to make a regular commitment;
- if you know someone who has a history of mental distress or is going to be alone over the holidays, make an effort to reach out to and include them;
- if you know someone who isn't very educated about mental illness, or you aren't yourself, make an effort to 
learn/teach more. Awareness, particularly about stuff like Mental Health First Aid, can literally save lives;
- if there's an awesome mental health charity in your community/country, make a financial donation or help spread the word about them. If you don't know any, go looking for one, I bet there's someone doing something awesome somewhere who needs your help.



</lj-cut>

If you happen to need my address for anything, you can email me at eleara @ gmail.com, or if you want it to be a surprise <span style='white-space: nowrap;'><a href='http://biodamped.dreamwidth.org/profile'><img src='http://www.dreamwidth.org/img/silk/identity/user.png' alt='[personal profile] ' width='17' height='17' style='vertical-align: text-bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;' /></a><a href='http://biodamped.dreamwidth.org/'><b>biodamped</b></a></span> happens to know me offline.

I've also probably missed a few links, please link me if you have a moment!

Kate had been home a week when she saw it. 

The house had that jaunty, bright look of fresh paint, with flowers by the path and brightly coloured curtains in all the windows. She watched from the corner as the mail man bundled a small sheath of papers into a picturesque letterbox, and suddenly a wave of longing overcame her.

<em>Betty.</em>

It was just like the home they'd spoken about, all the little details were there, the only thing missing was their names on the letterbox. The sun was rising high above it, and Kate just wanted to run to the door, and to the warmth of Betty's smile...

... but Betty didn't live there, and neither did Kate. As the sun rose higher, Kate let herself drift away past once more, and then away. But for the first time in one whole very very long week, Kate's heart was beating stronger than her fear.

<center><span style=""font-weight: bolder"">*</span></center>

She passed it again the next day, and the next, carrying scraps of food and hand me downs assembled by local church goers and passed along to a family mourning the recent loss of a father to the war. 

One of the ladies who attended service had insisted on having Kate's help with the Johnson family. She had sung the praises of how a daughter might help her community over and over; finally her father had grudgingly agreed to release her for the shortest possible length of travel time each day.

And so each day, as regular as clockwork, Kate passed by the little cottage with its flowers by the path. 

She delivered her basket, and squeezed hands, and loaned out a threadbare hankerchief. Then she turned around and walked back again, all the while trying desperately not to think of blonde hair and shy smiles and that swagger. Oh, that swagger. One day it would make her smile, and the next it would make her frown, but always - <em>always</em> - the gay little bobbing blossoms she passed each day would remind her of it.

Thus Kate's days formed into something of a rhythm, and, well trained by the routine of the factory floor, she unthinkingly fell into it.

Until one day, as she stood once more admiring the peonies, Gladys arrived.

<center><span style=""font-weight: bolder"">*</span></center>

""Betty didn't think you'd agree to see her,"" Gladys said, eyes wide and hand hesitantly outstretched.

""Why would I?"" Kate returned sharply, then clenched her jaw and turned her face away again.

""Please-"" Gladys started, but Kate raised her eyes to the sky and bit her lip and stopped listening. Gladys' voice dulled into a hum, raising and falling in agitation, until finally it stopped and Kate lowered her eyes again.

""You're not coming with me, are you,"" Gladys said, voice flat.

""I... I don't want anything to do with that life anymore. It's wrong, and sinful, and-""

""That life? That life? Kate, that was your life, every minute of it. It was yours and yours alone, you can't tell me you didn't love it and you can't just leave it behind!""

Kate pursed her lips, casting her eyes from Gladys to the flower bed to Gladys and back again.

'I..."" she started, then stopped and took a deep breath. ""My name is Marion.""

Gladys dipped her head forward to catch Kate's words, gaze intent and unwavering.

""I don't want anything to do with my sinful past anymore!""

Gladys sighed and pulled away. ""I can see I'm not getting through to you...""

She paused, and then reached out to grab Kate's hand, refusing to relent when Kate started and tried to pull away.

""Some money,"" she said, stuffing notes into Kate's fist. ""Money and the name of the hotel where I'm staying, I'll be there with a friend for the week. Please Kate, take it, I won't let you tell me no.""

Then she was gone in a swirl of skirts and perfume, leaving Kate with a basket of food in one hand, and a handful of paper and small notes in the other.

<center><span style=""font-weight: bolder"">*</span></center>

That night, Kate didn't sleep. She lay still and silent, her eyes closed and her hand grasping her pendant, the other casually laid across the corner of the mattress she'd stuffed the money and the note under.

The next night was the same, barely drifting off before startling awake to check her hiding place was still safe. She couldn't understand why it was so important to her - it was only enough change to get across town to the fancy hotel scrawled in the note. Just enough to stop Kate tracking Gladys down for the sole purpose of returning her money.

She barely breathed as she lay in the dark, but her mind had no such orderly quiet. It flitted from one thing to another, back and forth, never stopping. Except on thoughts of Betty. Always back to thoughts of Betty.

<center><span style=""font-weight: bolder"">*</span></center>

In the morning Kate left home as usual with her basket in hand and the money stashed in her clothes. She meekily agreed to hurry back, and then shuffled down the street until out of sight. Then she raised her head and strode, with strength and purpose and a little bit of borrowed swagger.

When she reached the Johnson family home, she dropped the basket on their doorstep and kept walking. She didn't even tarry to examine flower beds or look back over her shoulder at another certain cheery porch.

By the time she knocked on Gladys' door, she was gasping for breath with a laugh in her lungs and a piece of scrunched up note paper clenched in her hand so tightly it had torn.

""Gladys,"" she cried out when she heard the latch click. ""Gladys, it's me, it's Kate. I want to go with you!""

Then the door swung open, and Kate stopped stock still.

""Kate."" It was all Betty said, tears in her eyes and the edge of the door clenched in her hand till her knuckles turned white. ""Kate.""

Another voice came from deeper in the hotel suite. ""Kate? Did I hear you say Kate?"" Then the door was tugged from Betty's hand, causing her to waver for a moment without something to lean on, and swung wide to reveal Gladys' smiling face.

""Oh thank god,"" she said, throwing her arms around Kate. ""You came!""

""I did!"" Kate laughed giddily, words muffled by Gladys' hair. ""I did come, I'm here.""

""Well then,"" Gladys said once she had finally pulled back. ""Do you have your bag?""

""No. No bag, I don't have anything to my name,"" Kate replied, a smile still firmly on her face, her eyes drifting back to Betty. ""It's just me again.""

""Well that's perfect then! There'll be more room in the car and we can go shopping when we get back. You'll see, Kate,"" Gladys enthused, linking their hands and bouncing happily on her toes. ""It's going to be just like before, but even better.""

Betty didn't make a move forward to join them, hanging back in the shadow of the room. But she echoed Kate's smile so hard it looked like her cheeks must hurt, and even when Kate's attention made her duck her head and rub a hand across the back of her neck she didn't drop her gaze for a moment.

<b>Summary:</b>  Story within a story fic, with a side of timey-wimey fix-it.   <em>Lady Song reached for Reinette's hand and raised it to her own lips. ""You told me once that to wait forever is to have no purpose. That if you were to be stuck on the slow path, then I must make it not seem so, for life is too glorious.</em>

<lj-cut text=""Pick A Star."">







<center><span style=""font-weight: bolder"">PICK A STAR</span></center>


It all started one pleasant morning in Reinette's private courtyard in the Versaille gardens. Finally having shooed, cajoled and threatened away the last servant, she settled herself in front of her tea tray ready to enjoy a little peace in the sunshine.

Unfortunately that peace was interrupted by a flare of light - painfully bright to Reinette's eyes, even at mid-morning. Then a strange woman fell out of Reinette's favourite flowering hedge and crashed onto the delicate table set before her. 

The commotion sent Reinette jumping, hands attempting to press and swing her skirts clear of flying furniture and crockery as she went. 

It was a rather ineffectual attempt, all told. Reinette quickly found herself falling to the ground also, landing half on top of the woman to the tinkling sound of more crushed crockery.

""Sorry about that,"" the woman gasped, her red lips wide in a grin and leaves in her hair, and a warm hand steady on Reinette's waist. ""Are you quite all right?""

Lost for breath in the rigid grasp of her skirts and corsets, Reinette attempted to feign a somewhat convincing nod in reply and to gather herself, but the woman's eyes narrowed.

""Here now, let me -"" 

""-no, I can move myself."" Reinette attempted to protest as one hand became two, but she was already being manoeuvered about quite firmly and she heaved a small sigh as she was propped up such that the boning in her corset shifted into a more forgiving position.

""I insist. It's the least I can do, after pulling you down like that.""

""No - truer - words,"" Reinette said between pulling the deepest breaths possible back into her lungs. 

From her new vantage point on the ground, Reinette carefully scrutinised the woman as she breathed. She seemed to be made of flesh and blood, for she was solid and warm where they were still pressed against each other in a tangle. No monster in a strange mask...

Reinette shook herself slightly.

<em>Be less paranoid</em>, she scolded herself, <em>the Doctor's message was clear. Versaille is safe for yet four more years. </em>

The woman didn't appear injured. Her clothes seemed ragged and singed in places, <em>and perhaps a little odd</em>... Reinette thought. Then the woman kneeled up; Reinette's eyes widened, she couldn't help but let them linger a moment on the sight of a woman in men's trousers.

Reinette did not lift her gaze until her gasping began to lessen, and the woman held out her hands in response. Together they somehow managed to stuggle Reinette back to her feet.

""Thank you,"" Reinette said, tightening her grip on the woman's hands for a moment before releasing her. ""Well then, who are you to be stumbling so brazenly about the royal gardens?""

The woman's smile slipped, replaced by something efficiently curious that took Reinette aback, leaving herself now feeling the scruitnized one. But before she could take offense it was speedily replaced by a fresh smile.

""River Song,"" came the answer, with a little tip of the woman's head and a quirk of her lips.

""And what, perchance, is your errand here Lady Song?""

""Ooh, Lady, that's a new one-""

Reinette arched an eyebrow.

""- I'm looking for someone. Have you, perchance, seen a man about recently? Tall, young, a little bit odd. My guidebook told me he might have very unusual hair for the current fashions. A bit tall, sort of... spikey.""

Reinette's brow furrowed.

""Will you walk with me?"" she asked after a short pause, and began a slow pace away from the disaster of knocked down furniture and spoiled food.

When she wasn't instantly followed she motioned for Lady Song to join her.

""You must forgive my curiosity, but what is this <em>guidebook</em>?"" Reinette asked after they had begun walking side by side. ""And what sort of book describes a man's grooming without also telling you his name?

""A very special book. He's a doctor, if that rings any bells.""

Reinette asked sharply, ""a doctor? Are you injured? I'll call for assistance-""

""No need, I dont have a scratch on me, see,"" Lady Song suddenly did a little twirl and dropped into a deep courtsey, holding imaginary skirts wide. A laugh rolled out of her mouth and across the courtyard as she did so, but it could not still the fear that had gripped Reinette's heart.

""...I'm afraid I don't recall him,"" she said, lips pursed and eyes narrowed, but Lady Song paid no heed.

""Are you sure? I hear he's quite memorable, I suspect he might have a little bit of a swagger-"" 

The lady rose from her courtsey as she spoke, still laughing, but her voice died when she looked upon Reinette's face.

""I'm sorry, my dear,"" she said, voice quiet now and stripped of all gaiety. She raised a hand towards Reinette's face, but did not close the final distance when Reinette stiffened. ""I seem to have arrived too early. I take it the clocks haven't stopped again yet?""

""Who are you?"" Reinette demanded, then demanded again when her only answer was a heavy sigh. ""<em>Who are you?</em>""

""I am a... a friend.""

""A friend who knows the Doctor? How?""

""A story for another day, my dear."" Lady Song pulled up her sleeve, revealing a strangely thick leather bracelet with all sort of grooves and patterns on it. Reinette felt curiosity tugging at her. It reminded her of her glimpse into the Doctor's cold world, but she was not the sort of woman to be so easily swayed from her purpose. She refused to be.

""Explain yourself,"" she demanded, reaching for the lady's elbow, tightening her grip when she received no answer. ""You are from his world, are you not? Answer me!""

Lady Song sighed again. ""Reinette...""

""How do you know my name? Did he send you?""

""No,"" she replied at last. ""No, the Doctor didn't send me. I came on my own, I had something to tell you.""

""So the Doctor did not send you... yet you ask for him anyway?""

""Spoilers,"" Lady Song said with a lilt back in her voice, then lifted a finger to Reinette's lips to still further questions. ""That means, my dear, that I cannot tell you yet. You know already that there are things that cannot be explained or easily understood, that some things must wait.""

Reinette opened her mouth again, but Lady Song only pressed her finger hard against her lips once more until Reinette could taste the salt on her skin. She stayed still, leaning in towards Reinette, her eyes intense and seemingly searching for something.

""Then answer me this,"" she said ar last, once Lady Song seemed satisfied and dropped her hand, taking her silence for capitulation, ""you move through time as he does?""

Lady Song smiled wryly.

""Are you seeing my life pressed together in a single day, rather than a lifetime, as he does? Oh but you will not answer that either,"" Reinette felt tears build inexplicably in her eyes, and tried to turn her face aside, but Lady Song would not let her.

""Not a single day, never just a single day,"" she said, grasping Reinette by the shoulders, suddenly deathly serious. Then she pulled Reinette close and held her tightly. Her hair was soft against Reinette's cheek, the sensation only broken by the scratch of a leaf now pressed into her skin. ""I came too soon,"" she murmured, her tone angry, seemingly at herself.

Reinette pulled away after a moment, with a cough to cover her tears. Then she clenched her jaw and stood tall. ""You must see many wonders.""

""You'll see them for yourself one day,"" said Lady Song, stepping back with a smile once more.

Reinette frowned. ""I don't understand, do you mean with the Doctor? I'll see those wonders with him?""

Lady Song reached for Reinette's hand and raised it to her own lips.

""You told me once that to wait forever is to have no purpose, that only short stretches were truly tolerable. That if you were to be stuck on the slow path, then I must make it not seem so, for life is too glorious for all things to seem so slow. That is all I can say.""

""I don't understand...""

""You will. After the clocks have stopped and you have seen the Doctor for the last time, you will pick a star and I will come back for you."" And with that, she turned and began to walk away.

Reinette watched her hips sway for a moment before calling after her.

""Lady Song? ... River!""

Those eyes were just as sharp and those lips just as red, Reinette found, when seen glancing back over a shoulder instead of in close quarters.

""You said you had something to tell me?""

""How silly of me! I would have had to come back a second time..."" River smirked. ""Your childhood fireplace, the one the Doctor spoke to you in, you need to have it moved to your new rooms before he returns. Don't forget now.""

Then she raised a hand in farewell, before lowering it to her wrist and blinking out of existance.

"event","Dear Yuletider, I'm still adding things to this letter! I'm going to aim to have some more info on my up this weekend, Yuletide matching just kind of crept up on me eep.

<lj-cut>Optional details are optional, please only take away from this letter what is helpful to you, and most importantly have a great Yuletide! <b>The only exception is the following:</b>

These things may run the risk of being really distressing for me, and prevent me from enjoying your story: character death, mental illness, depression, self-harm or suicide, or similar themes.

Other than the above, feel free to utilise (or not) the following info however you like!



<b>General likes and dislikes</b>
I really like happy endings, romance, kissing, good communication and feelings, relationships built on mutual respect and caring, and stories that delve a little further into characters mental states and motivations. I'm much more character focused than plot focused, and love fic that can peel pack some of those layers for me.

If you decide to write femslash (or even female centric gen to some extent...) I like girl-on-girl chivalry, butch/femme dynamics (where applicable, femme/femme and butch/butch and not-easily-categorised can be really awesome as well!), and girls with swagger.

I also like poly, so affairs tend to confuse and distress me as needlessly hurtful to the other character(s). Feel free to make canon relationships open ones, officially break them up, just ignore them and leave them off screen, whatever. This isn't to say that I never come across good fics or believable scenarios around infidelity, but by and large it isn't my thing.

If you like to write higher ratings, fic kinks and acts I find interesting include D/s, bondage, fingerbanging, cunnilingus, strap-ons, kissing, breasts and things related to them, corsets, lipstick, sex against walls, and light painplay like spanking or clamps as long as skin is never broken. Mostly I like all of these as means of the characters having joyful, fun sex, or demonstrations of the trust within their relationship.

Some of this is pretty lesbian centric, please don't worry if you're writing Inheritance Trilogy! I do want to see fic for it just as much! It's just one of my only not-femslash-possible requests this fic season. I think the dynamic of all three of them in bed together could make for some interesting sex in and of itself, and I'd also be very interested to see some BDSM elements. Just be careful of power play if some of the emotional baggage around Shahar hasn't been fixed yet in your storyline, please.

I don't like power play if there's also a power issue within the relationship outside sex, but otherwise I'm not going to try and police my squicks here. It's way too hard to cover everything and they can change from fandom to fandom, so I just refer you back to my like!



<b>I Can't Think Straight (Leyla, Tala)</b>
<i>I'd love gen or femslash equally, so please feel comfortable to go in either direction! I like introspection, feelings, and happy endings. I don't like mental illness, character death, unproductive angst, or self-destructive acts. If you go gen, please don't rewrite Leyla/Tala as a friendship - if you go femslash, I like romantic gestures, girl-on-girl chivalry, power play in the bedroom.

Some possible story ideas: Leyla and Tala building their lives together post-movie, Leyla's life as a writer, missing scenes of Leyla's short relationship with Jennifer (the on-screen girlfriend - I would be happy for you to write about all three of my characters, or just Leyla, or just Leyla/Tala or just Leyla/Jennifer!)</i>




<b>Inheritance Trilogy - N. K. Jemisin (Dekarta, Shahar, Sieh)</b>
<i>I found the idea of Sieh/Deka/Shahar growing into their own three-god triad really intriguing. I like the idea of fated ships where everyone still needs to put hard work into the relationship, communication, and domesticity. I don't like mental illness, or character death (you don't have to re-write around canon deaths, but please don't focus on them.)

Some possible story ideas: Will they learn from the mistakes of the original three? How might they have come together as a three if Sieh hadn't started aging? What sort of life did Shahar live without them? What will it take for Shahar to feel integrated and secure after being apart from them?</i>


<b>Haven (Audrey Parker, Claire Callahan)</b>
<i>I find Claire and Audrey to be very interesting for the same reason - they can both be a little bit inscrutable. I've love to see that explored further as gen or femslash. I like women standing by and up for each other, and women who are strong and don't apologise for having their own agendas. For femslash, I like romantic gestures and butch/femme dynamics. I don't like mental illness, character death, or the canon het love triangle.

Some possible story ideas: what if Claire is not inscrutable not because she's new to the show, but because she knows she'll be leaving Haven with Audrey? What sort of long-term friend/relationship might they have if Audrey finds a way to stay in Haven? Claire and Audrey successfully handling a big trouble case on their own.</i>


<b>Tipping the Velvet - Sarah Waters (Nan, Flo)</b>
<i>Nan and Flo are my lesbian happily ever after story. I was particularly enamoured of them in the TV series, and then I read the books and still was quite obsessed. I love how real they are, how much they both throw themselves into their relationship (unlike Nan/Kitty for instance), and how they build their life together piece by piece. I even love the rag-tag brother(in-law) and adopted son domestic set up they have going on. I don't like mental illness, character death, or the idea of Nan not actually being committed to Flo (over another of her previous lovers) after all.

Some possible ideas: Nan and Flo meet someone intriguing and sexy at their local lesbian bar (I like poly and threesomes, if you'd like to go there, or they just get some ideas to take home with them), more scenes of their life together, how meeting Nan's family went.</i>

If you like to write higher ratings, fic kinks and acts I find interesting include: D/s, bondage, fingerbanging, cunnilingus, strap-ons, kissing, breasts and things related to them, corsets, lipstick, sex against walls, and light painplay like spanking or clamps as long as skin is never broken. Mostly I like all of these as means of the characters having joyful, fun sex, or demonstrations of the trust within their relationship.

I don't like power play if there's also a power issue within the relationship outside sex, but otherwise I'm not going to try and police my squicks here. It's way too hard to cover everything and they can change from fandom to fandom, so I just refer you back to my like!list.



Listed fandom requests:
<b>1. The Devil Wears Prada (movie), Emily/Andy</b>
Emily was my favorite character, followed closely by Andy, and I still wish that the movie had shown more of the relationship between them. I feel like Emily had a lot more promise to live up to, and would love to see some of that played out. When it comes to the Andy side of this pairing, I found her canon arc very satisfying, and I'd love to see her further along in that. So I guess in many ways this pairing is largely about seeing a bit of a spark there, and wishing for a happy ending for them both, preferably together.

<b>2. Doctor Who: ""New Who"", Lady Christina/River, Lady Christina/Esther Drummond</b>
Christina made me squee and clap my hands the first time I saw her on Who, and continues to whenever I rewatch her special. This is my most flexible request, if you think there's another character in New Who who she would work well with, please feel free to experiment and add additional pairings to either of the above! I like to think that meeting the Doctor sent Christina off on amazing and wild adventures, so feel free to send her spinning through time and space under own steam on the most flimsiest of pretences. I find her to be a really fun, really vibrant and unapologetic character, and just like to see her have fun, vibrant and unapologetic lesbian funtimes.




Wildcard fandom requests: 
<b>1. Lip Service, Lexy/Tess</b>
I love Lexy's generally swaggery no nonsense approach, and I love Tess's sweet bumbling uselessness, and I think they would make the most adorable complimentary couple. Lexy's arc at the end of the season is the epitome of many things I Hate in pairings, and I'd love to see something to counter that. Perhaps where she's on her way to being less destructive and more genuinely into Tess - don't feel obliged to stick to the happy ending of this, I'd also be very happy to read her getting underway with this sort of an arc. I'd also love to see something AU to fix it completely, or something placed well post-her sorting that silliness out.

<b>2. The Moth Diaries, Rebecca/Ernessa</b>
If you're looking for a quick backup fandom to consider, The Moth Diaries is a movie! You might need to be a bit careful with this one, as mental illness and self-harm, etc., is built into the canon. Some ways of avoiding that subject matter might be: a rewrite of the storyline, where Ernessa disregarded Lucie and focused all that intensity directly and obviously on Rebecca, building on seduction rather than their similar family history to try and win her over; a story where the vampirism mechanism ends up being different than Ernessa thought; a post-movie AU where Rebecca is already a vampire and thus the way she becomes one can be skipped; or a post-movie AU where they remain in the human/vampire configuration. Things I like about this fandom: vampires and all their sexy, kinky potential (please no blood play though), the intense emotions that tend to go with boarding school ships, and that Rebecca is a character I find to be very interesting in an adventurous, bullheaded yet somewhat introspective way. The small glimpses we get of Ernessa's personality beyond the vampirism (eg. the sweet smiling end of her exchange with Rebecca when looking at the photograph) really intrigued me as well.

<b>3. Out at the Wedding, Risa/Jeannie</b>
If you're looking for a quick backup fandom to consider, Out at the Wedding is also a movie! There are a lot of things in this movie that make me cringe a little, particularly the main character and her best friend. But if you can get past them and focus on the reasonably sizeable screen time of Risa and Jeannie, I think you'll find a really enjoyable story. I loved them as separate characters, I loved their dance together, I loved how quickly and seamlessly they fell together as an adorable perfect couple. Flesh out their canon story with the sort of scenes that wouldn't have been offscreen if they were the main characters, write something post-movie, write an AU where they're a magic wielding princess and a knight and have the same adorable dynamic. Just have them together and adorable and happy however you want to swing it.

<strong>Notes:</strong> I've been working on a full length vid to this song for TVD since January. It's a Bonnie/Caroline, Katherine/Caroline triangle vid centred around her season two transformation, and it just gobbled up my brain up for a little while so I started hacking it together from downloaded source. I tend to go back to it in a fury and then leave it alone for ages, and but enough time has passed that the DVDs should be out soonish in Australia I've decided to wait for decent source and rework what I have. But this section - sans the context of the rest of the vid - is my favourite and, well, just incase I never get around to posting the full vid... haha. 

Stand alone this vidlet also makes a good little visual companion piece for my Yuletide fic, <a href=""http://archiveofourown.org/works/143584"">When One Tomb Door Closes</a>. This is also a little bit rough, unbeta'd and from not the greatest source, mostly just for the fun of posting.

<strong>Summary:</strong> Katherine promises Caroline it's not going to hurt, but they both know that's a lie.

<strong>Lyrics: Girl With One Eye (Bayou Percussion Version) by Florence + The Machine</strong>
<em>I slipped my hand under her skirt
I said don't worry, it's not gonna hurt
Oh, my reputation's kinda clouded with dirt
That's why you sleep with one eye open
But that's the price you pay</em>

Don't worry if I can't be contacted at any point, phone networks are getting shakier as more people panic across the country. I have heard/seen that <lj user=""merihn""> and <lj user=""ellipsisblack""> are safe so far, as is travelling local <lj user=""shorelle"">.

If you have friends or family in Australia, the ABC 24 hour new service has apparently been opened up so it can be watched from overseas: http://www.abc.net.au/news/abcnews24/

I have a few family members in currently dangerous areas and a number of lives have already been lost, so your thoughts and well wishes for my country are appreciated.

"event","Firstly, I'm a festivids newbie, so believe me when I say I'll be easy to please. I decided to bite the bullet on my exchange vidding nerves early in my vidding years, because I remember how swept up by everything I was with my first Yuletide and how much I wished I hadn't let nerves keep me back. So, I'll be really easy to wow! Promise! I'm super in love with your vid already, just because it'll be all for me and part of an awesome exchange, whee.

If you've checked my journal for a letter more than once since assignments went out, you may have noticed I've been absent from fandom a lot lately. It's been health related, and I'm really super sorry for the delay! I hope my lack of festividder letter hasn't caused you any massive dramas! I've included my letter here along the lines of what I would have posted if I'd been on time, but if you've already started and anything here clashes with the work you've already done, please, you absolutely have my permission to ignore anything here even more than I would usually encourage!

As I said in all my music notes, I'd much prefer you to vid with whatever music moves you. I do have mix tags: <a href=""http://shopfront.dreamwidth.org/tag/fandom:+admin:+all+fanmix"">my fanmixes</a> and <a href=""http://shopfront.dreamwidth.org/tag/i+love:+music:+gen+mixes"">my genmixes</a>, but being new to vidding I don't feel at all qualified to be able to make song suggestions foe other people without inadvertently making things super difficult. Not to mention, there are plenty of vids I've loved made to music that I didn't like or wouldn't have expected to find likeable until I got to listen to it in the context of a wonderful vid. With any creative work I always prefer things that have clicked with the creator and their style over anything forced for the sake of fulfilling details that don't fit quite right, so please feel free to go wherever your preferred music takes you.

As far as tone and style and all that, like I said, I'm all new to vidding and everything. So I'm easily dazzled, and I'm constantly being surprised by the vids I enjoy! My preferences generally run towards female characters and femslash, as you've probably noticed from my request details, but I'm not adverse to boyslash or het as well. The way I fangirl is primarily via the medium of squee, so I particularly like character and relationship vids that are all about celebrating the awesomeness. I've also grown very fond of vids that cut to a strong beat and make me want to dance and laugh.

At the same time, I've seen a few amazing vids that construct a story that's different to the canon, and some wonderful critique and meta vids, and vids that are slow and atmospheric, and so much more. I still have so much to learn about what goes into a vid that wows me, so please feel free to expand my horizons! The most important ingredient in a great vid (or any sort of fanwork) is that you believe in it, so please disregard anything in this post that makes things difficult for you.


<strong>Covert Affairs</strong>
If you're not familiar with Covert Affairs but like to know the source footage details for potential back-up-ness, there has only been one season of 11 episodes aired to date, and as far as I'm aware no DVDs have been released yet.

Details: Pairings that make me happy: Annie/Auggie, Annie/Jai, and Annie/Joan. Plus anything gennishly Annie or Joan centric!


<strong>The Good Wife</strong>
If you're not familiar with The Good Wife but like to know the source footage details for potential back-up-ness, there has been one season of 23 episodes released on DVD and season two is still in the process of airing. If you'd prefer to stick to the first season because of the annoyance of continual new canon while being creative, that also wouldn't cause me any disappointment whatsoever!

Details: I love Kalinda oh so much, so she'd be my first choice for a vid. If Kalinda/Alicia or a general Kalinda/women femslashy vid hits your buttons, that would also be totally awesome, but anything women centric would be equally fantastic.


<strong>Hellcats</strong>
If you're not familiar with Hellcats but like to know the source footage details for potential back-up-ness, at the time of writing and posting this letter there are ten episodes of Hellcats aired, each around the 40 minute mark. It's still airing, so that will obviously increase, but you could also very easily vid with just the episodes already available right now and make me a very happy camper.

Details: I adore Savannah, find her completely adorable, and kind of wish for a show all about her. However, I would also love to see a Marti/Savannah vid, or an ensemble vid about the cheerleading team as a group, rather than the Marti+team perspective the show often gives us.


<strong>Kissing Jessica Stein (safety)</strong>
If you're not familiar with Kissing Jessica Stein but like to know the source footage details for potential back-up-ness, it is a movie and obviously, as a safety, under the 180 minute mark.

Details: The ending of KJS still continues to disappoint me, even years later. A happily ever after!Jessica/Helen vid, a vid where Jessica goes on to have healthy and fully sexual relationships with women, or really anything in the realm of fluffy shippy love, would delight me enormously.


<strong>Lost in Austen</strong>
If you're not familiar with Lost in Austen but like to know the source footage details for potential back-up-ness, it's a four part mini-series, and without checking the actual episodes myself, Wikipedia informs me each one runs to around 45 minutes.

Details: I found LiA's Caroline Bingley quite intriguing, and I'd love to see a vid about her and/or about her femslashy relationships (with Amanda, or without if you prefer.)


<strong>Young Americans</strong>
If you're not familiar with Young Americans but like to know the source footage details for potential back-up-ness, there are eight episodes in all, each I believe in the 40 minute bracket.

Details: Pairings that make me happy are Jake/Hamilton, Jake/Bella, and Bella/Paige. Gen things I'd also love to see would be something that plays up Jake as possibly genderqueer rather than just playing pranks on family members (whatever the angsty reason), or more focused on the female characters than the canon - especially Paige and/or Caroline.

<strong>Lyrics: Human Interest by Hooverphonic.</strong>
<em>You say this, you say that,
Smart but in a way you're sad.
Leave me alone right now.

I used to be in love with this.
Now I'm trying to get rid
Of all this human interest.

Don't you dare to point your finger at me,
Look at yourself.
I'm not the one you want me to be,
Look at yourself.

Some say no, some say yes.
Less or more or more or less.
Leave me alone right now.

I used to be adored each day,
Now it's time for to pay
The dreadful price of success.

Don't you dare to point your finger at me,
Look at yourself.
I'm not the one you want me to be,
Look at yourself.</em>

<strong>Lyrics: I've Heard That Song Before by Harry James</strong>
<em>I know each word because I've heard that song before.
The lyrics said 'forever more.'
Forever more's a memory.

Please have them play it again,
And I'll remember just when I heard
That lovely song before.</em>

<strong>\\Feedback</strong> on the mix is always gratefully appreciated, but not bothering to comment because you're just snagging music is a smidgen rude. Just say hi and that you downloaded something, it helps me keep track of when re-uploads might be needed. :D
<strong>\\Re-upload Policy</strong> I'm always happy to re-up zips at any time if both zip links expire (please check both first, or mention if you try one and are unable to access the other due to your location/browser/whatever!), drop me a comment and I'll jump on it a.s.a.p.

I'm very slowly trying to claw my way back to the land of the living, but so far my success has been limited.

I also can't seem to convince livejournal to load flist filters, so comments are open on crosspost if anyone wants to link-drop me. Until <em>all</em> of LJ works as intended, or I have the good health to figure out what the bugfuck is up with that, I probably won't be keeping up with LJ at all.

<lj-cut text=""The Many Ways."">






<center><span style=""font-weight: bolder"">THE MANY WAYS</span></center>



Claire sneaks into the dorms under the cover of darkness, scaling a ridiculously high fence in an isolated corner of campus - snapping her ankle back into place absentmindedly after she lands - to avoid being seen, and peering around every corner at length before rounding it. Once she reaches her own room, she backs through the door silently, keeping each step measured and soft and only letting the door slide back into its frame by the tiniest of inaudible increments.

Then she very nearly ruins all her hard work by yelling when arms wrap themselves around her shoulders.

""Hey, you,"" Gretchen murmurs sleepily into her hair, and tightens her hold. ""It's only me.""

Claire breathes in and out deeply, just once, to try and calm her racing heart, and then turns in the circle of Gretchen's arms and tips her head forward to nestle in the crease of her neck. Gretchen's arms slip clumsily down to her waist, and Claire lets herself go limp, just resting against her.

""I saw you on the news,"" Gretchen continues talking, half to herself, her voice thick and clumsy. Claire smiles against Gretchen's skin as the sound of her voice slowly fills the room, half-heartedly pursing her lips into something of a kiss as they stand there, leaning against each other. ""I was so proud of you, Claire. So very proud.""

They're cocooned in Gretchen's sheets not long after, Claire still dressed except for her jacket dropped by the door and her shoes toed off as they stumbled towards the nearest bed.

""It's only been a few hours and I already hate dodging reporters,"" Claire confesses, whispering, her head pillowed on her arm.

""Do you regret it?"" Gretchen asks, her eyes wider now, more awake.

""No,"" Claire says after a long pause. ""No, I don't think I could.""



<center><span style=""font-weight: bolder"">*</span></center>


<p align=""right"">
""I can't <em>believe</em> you did that!""

Claire opens her mouth to ask what the hell she's doing here, just inside the doorway of Claire's father's apartment, but then thinks better of it. The television is blaring in the background, playing the footage of Claire's jump over and over, and there's blue electricity crackling around Elle's hands.

""I thought you were dead,"" she settles for asking instead.

""I thought we were a secret,"" Elle snarls in response.

""Yeah, well,"" Claire shrugs and tosses her bag into a corner, out of the way, and shuts the door behind her. ""Nothing ever seemed to change while everyone was hiding.""

""Who says it needed to?"" Elle asks, her voice rising into a shriek.

Claire just cocks her head to the side and looks her up and down. ""The fact that you didn't bother to tell anyone you survived Sylar's attack, did.""

Elle's jaw works for a moment, but apparently she can't find anything to say to that because it snaps shut again without a word. She sniffs daintily and raises her chin, and the blue around her hands settles down into small sparks. Claire waits a beat, then shrugs and brushes past her. 

""Are you hungry?"" She asks over her shoulder when she reaches the refrigerator.
</p>


<center><span style=""font-weight: bolder"">*</span></center>



""Still no regrets?"" Gretchen asks again a week later, a smile on her lips and caution in her voice. They're huddled together in the backseat of a car staffed by Petrelli bodyguards, following the 'suggestion' that Claire temporarily vacate campus; ""to avoid disturbing other students during this period of media attention, you understand.""

""No,"" Claire replies through gritted teeth.

""Good, me neither.""

Claire glances at Gretchen out of the corner of her eye, lips twitching when she sees the cheery, determined expression fixed on her face.

""Are you sure?""

The smile widens, becoming more easy, and more genuine. Even the girlfriend of the Amazing Healing Girl! didn't attract as much attention as Claire herself; Gretchen had been more than welcome to remain at college.

""Of course,"" she says. Claire bumps their shoulders together and Gretchen responds by leaning over and kissing her enthusiastically.

She catches the drivers eyes glancing away in the rearview mirror as they break apart, and reaches over to the control for the privacy partition with a smirk.

""You know I'd always rather be with you,"" Gretchen whispers in her ear as they wait for the partition to hum its way up to the ceiling.



<center><span style=""font-weight: bolder"">*</span></center>


<p align=""right"">
Claire's phone rings while they're eating. <em>Gretchen</em> flashes across the screen, but Claire hits the ignore button after only a second's hesitation. She notices Elle is watching her, blatant curiosity on her face, but she pretends not to see. Peter and her father had ushered her away from the circus after only a brief talk with the reporters, and then everything had gone kind of crazy. By the time she'd been able to get through to Gretchen, she'd already gotten a message from college, asking her to please keep the media frenzy away from the other students.

Gretchen had sounded so happy for her on the phone. She'd kept repeating how proud she was, and Claire believed her. She really did. But Gretchen didn't deserve to get caught up in this particular whirlwind, and somehow, Claire talked to her less and less.

""Are you going to eat that?"" Elle asks, breaking into her thoughts. Her fork was pointed at the untouched bread roll beside Claire's plate.

""Go nuts,"" she says, wearily, and nudges it in Elle's direction.

Elle's fork clatters to the table and she quickly grabs the roll. ""What?"" she asks indignantly, when she notices Claire still watching her. ""It's a little hard to make ends meet when you're pretending to be dead.""

Claire tries hard to hide her surprise, and motions casually towards the kitchen, saying ""feel free to help yourself to whatever"" and pretending not to see the gratitude on Elle's face.
</p>


<center><span style=""font-weight: bolder"">*</span></center>



""Your grandmother is really nice, but she still kind of freaks me out,"" Gretchen says for the fourth day running after they hole up in one of Angela's city apartments, the sixth Petrelli property in their tour of expensive and heavily fortified lodgings. 

Claire just laughs and pulls her back into bed. ""I'm fairly sure that's the impression she intends to give.""

""Is this some sort of 'you corrupted my granddaughter' thing?"" Gretchen asks, pulling faces and pitching her voice low, making Claire laugh harder.

""I doubt it, I've never been especially easy to control. I think she's resigned herself to that by now.""

""I suppose going on Larry King against her advice rates higher on the corruption scale than taking a lesbian lover these days."" Gretchen sighs heavily, adopting an expression of abject woe until Claire hits her in the face with a pillow. ""How can I compete with Larry King?"" she asks, her voice plaintive and muffled.



<center><span style=""font-weight: bolder"">*</span></center>


<p align=""right"">
""Heard something interesting today,"" Claire says loudly from the lounge room in her best innocent voice when she hears Elle come in.

""Oh yeah?"" Elle calls from the front hall. There's a few crashing sounds and Claire rolls her eyes before Elle sticks her head into room, hanging off the doorframe with one hand and grinning like a lunatic.

""Yeah,"" Claire says, calmly continuing to fold laundry from where she's sitting cross-legged by the coffee table. ""Apparently you might have super powers, too.""

Elle abruptly pulls herself upright again, grin only slightly lessened, and watches Claire cautiously. When all she does is tilt her head towards the couch cushions, where a gossip rag is thrown open to a full page picture of the two of them, Elle just shrugs. Like she couldn't help herself.

""What? I got sick of the old headlines. <em>Does Claire Bennet have a live-in girlfriend?</em> Please."" Elle flips her hair back over her shoulder with a pout. ""As if that's the only interesting thing about me!""

""A little warning would have been nice, that's all."" Claire keeps folding, struggling to keep the grin off her face. ""My dad brought that around in a rage, and I've already had three calls from Angela to complain about shoddy public relations work.""

Elle drops onto her stomach next to the magazine, limbs sprawled and hair hiding her face.

""You're not the only one who can be impulsive,"" she mutters, the edge of a whine in her voice. 

Claire pushes to her feet and steps around the coffee table, nudging at Elle's hips with her knee until she rolls onto her side, making room for Claire to sit. Claire props herself up, leaning over her, and brushes Elle's hair out of her eyes.

""You're beautiful,"" she says, and kisses Elle, hard. She can feel Elle smiling again, into the kiss, and then suddenly she flips them off the couch and Claire's head hits the corner of the coffee table. Then they're just laughing - Elle straddling her stomach, and Claire healing - and making out like teenagers.
</p>



<center><span style=""font-weight: bolder"">*</span></center>



""It's a good thing we made that agreement with the Dean that we'd live off campus this semester,"" Gretchen says conversationally with her fingers twisting inside Claire, her other hand tangled with Claire's, pressing it into the mattress beside her head. Claire groans inarticulately, pulling helplessly at Gretchen's leg hitched up across her own and arching her hips. 

The sun streaming through the curtains is warm against Claire's breast, and Gretchen is also warm, stretched along her body with her lips at Claire's throat.

""Because you've been getting rather loud lately.""

She can feel the muscles in Gretchen's back shifting and then the angle of her fingers change, and her thumb brushes against her clit, and Claire arches again, practically screaming on command.



<center><span style=""font-weight: bolder"">*</span></center>


<p align=""right"">
Claire wakes quickly and stays perfectly still, listening, her vision blocked by the usual disarray of pillows about her head. She carefully tugs down with her hands and hears the clink of metal on metal.

""Good morning,"" Elle practically purrs from behind her, and hands slide up her spine. Claire shivers.

""Handcuffs? Really?"" Claire shifts awkwardly, trying to find enough leverage with her elbows against the pillows to take the weight off her wrists. She tries to rise to her knees as well, and to twist so she can look Elle in the eye, but the hands against her back press down when she moves, keeping her flat against the mattress.

""Happy coming-out-as-a-freak anniversary,"" Elle says with a giggle. ""I thought today deserved something special.""

""Is that what I can feel, something special?"" Claire asks wryly, and Elle laughs again and thrusts her hips, nudging something long and solid against the back of Claire's thigh. ""I don't remember <em>that</em> particular shopping trip making the headlines.""

""That's my secret to keep,"" Elle singsongs and settles in more firmly against Claire's back. Claire groans and drops her head back down in acceptance at the feel of Elle's breasts against her skin, and her hands slowly making their way to her legs, holding her down and wide.

""I want to see it,"" she mumbles, turning her head to the side to breathe deeply and gasp out the words.

""Mm,"" Elle hums. ""Maybe later, if you're good."" She eases Claire's legs apart and runs a finger along her vulva, making her buck against the mattress. ""But only if you're <em>very</em> good,"" she promises.

D: Yesterday I missed my train by seconds by going to the ticket booth on auto-pilot, even though there's rail strikage and it was free fare Monday (workers refusing to sell fares or check tickets, hee), so I was late to my appointment. When I went to pay after said appointment, I also realised I'd left my credit card god knows where. 

Oh, and today I managed to <em>genuinely</em> take an accidental seven hour nap, and miss pretty much all of the business hours in which I could call Centrelink, to sort out why they've cancelled my payments (and my housemates!) for not responding to correspondance <em>that we never got</em>. Oh and I'm also now deeply behind on the tute prep I'm meant to have done for classes tomorrow, and I'm starting to think I'm getting a stress migraine.

Aaand I've just found out that not one, not two, but a whole bunch of my emails have been lost by the internets over the past week. If you were expecting a reply to something, didn't get one, and don't get a follow up from me today either, drop me a comment or PM. =_=

In cheerier news, I finally got around to checking out Rizzoli & Isles, and oh my freaking god, it was everything you guys said it would be! New femslashy fandom time, hip hip hooray! \o/ Guysguysguys, if you're not, you <em>really need to be watching this</em>. 

<u><strong>Reasons you need Rizzoli & Isles more than you need to sleep, or eat, or, y'know, be alive:</strong></u>
1. The femslash subtext is through the freaking roof!
2. Even if you're not a femslasher, it has two fantastic lead characters - Jane Rizzoli and Maura Isles - who are brilliant together on screen.
--> 2b. And if you missed the names, they're both women!
-----> 2c. And it passes the Bechdel test both technically, and in spirit.
3. Jane's partner Barry Frost is adorable and awesome, and has loads of character potential. Aand is played by the wonderful Lee Thompson Young! Who you may know as Victor/Cyborg from Smallville, Al Gough from Flashforward, or Derek on Scrubs.
4. Barry and Jane's ex-partner, Vince Korsak, have this hi-ilarious odd couple rivalry thing going over who gets to be Jane's Partner.
5. Jane looks awesome in a dress, on the odd occasion that she wears them.
--> 5b. Maura likes to dress her.
6. Mama Rizzoli is ridiculous and makes you want to pinch her cheeks.
--> 6b. Mama Rizzoli, Jane and Maura have this amazing, side-hurting level of in-law shenanigans vibe going between the three of them.
7. Jane and Maura are hot. And subtexty. And make other people speak for them when they're fighting. And they don't take shit from nobody. Basically: serious awesome points.
8. If you need more convincing (seriously, is there something wrong with you?) here's a great little behind the scenes/promo thing to give you a visual introduction to the characters: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYl0rJmlQdk"">Rizzoli & Isles: An Overview</a>.

<lj-cut text=""Quick 1.01 warning note, spoilers for the pilot only."">Quick 1.01 warning note, spoilers for the pilot only.


















Obviously, this is a crime show, but I've so far found it to be on the lower end of confronting for a crime show (although I do lack violence related triggers, feel free to comment or email me - eleara@gmail.com - if you need to know anything specific), apart from the pilot. The show is fantastic in the way that the pilot just jumps straight into the deep end, with the central crime being related to a previous incident where Jane was attacked by a perp when she tried to rescue a victim. 

I was surprised by how unnerved I ended up being through the pilot, with Jane becoming a victim, again, and being under constant threat of being targeted by the same serial killer, again. Which is a big credit to the creative team behind the show because it's not something that normally bothers me on a reflexive gut level in fictional portrayals! I might yell at the screen, but it's not one of things that makes me want to cover my face/ears or leave the room for a break, at least not usually. The R&I pilot, though? Totally had me at that level of ack in a number of points. You might need to tread carefully with the pilot if you have any problems with women being stalked/targeted/attacked in a violent and/or particularly sadistic manner.

nb: there's lots of built-in spoiler space under the cut.

So! Who's watching R&I?

<strong>eta:</strong> So this might be old news to people who are not and thus have been around more lately, but OH. EM. GEE. THERE'S AN 'UPDATE DATE' BUTTON ON THE DW MAKE A POST PAGE. I THINK I MIGHT BE ABLE TO DIE HAPPY. :DDDDD

To my credit, my weekly edition of <lj user=""femslash_today""> is conveniently located on July 17, so I don't have to feel like a total slacker. I highly recommend the newsletter (it's multi-fandom) if you need a femslash fix to celebrate the date. <a href=""http://femslash-today-lj-feed.dreamwidth.org/"">Femslash_today also has a DW feed</a>.

Not an entirely idle query, but out of curiosity, would anyone be interested in a femslash specific fandom directory? Think something like a cross between <lj user=""crack_van"">'s fandom overviews and <lj user=""newbieguide"">, depending on the activity level for each fandom, only geared specifically towards fen who want to know where the good girlkissing is. I'm thinking perhaps a general summary per fandom aimed at giving a run down for fen looking for new fandoms with femslash potential, with perhaps additional page(s) for fandom/pairing run downs if the fandom is very active.

I'd do a poll but, eh, crossposting poll intricacies. Drop a comment if you like the idea and/or if you might like to do a summary of your favourite femslash fandom! 

I'll leave comments open on DW and LJ, although I'm most likely to set something up on DW if this eventuates into anything. Do pimp if you know any femslashers!

"event","You are welcome to contact me at any time if you are unsure about any of my works and would like clarification on the following, or have any additional specific warnings you may require which I do not refer to here.

I do not normally utilise methods such as highlighting text to read the warnings.

<u>I will list 'warnings: none' when the following content is not present or implied, as far as I am aware.</u>

<strong>Important note:</strong> I am still in the process of evaluating previous header use for non-written fanworks. Application of warnings to past fanworks that are not/do not include fic may be spotty for the duration that this note is present here.

<lj-cut text=""Regular warnings I utilise."">

I need to disclaimer that I am inherently wordy! The first section of this post (regular warnings I will utilise) is likely to be the most relevant/helpful if you need it short and sweet.

<center><strong>Jump links:</strong> <a href=""http://shopfront.livejournal.com/336661.html?#cutid1"">Regular warnings I will utilise</a> | <a href=""http://shopfront.livejournal.com/336661.html?#cutid4"">Additional notes: things I will not warn for, and multi-media or non-written fanworks.</a> | <a href=""http://shopfront.livejournal.com/336661.html?#cutid5"">Contacting me regarding warning issues</a>.</center>



<h3>Regular warnings I will utilise:</h3>
I will always attempt, to the best of my ability, to warn for the following content within my fanworks (keywords are in boldface for easy visual browsing for common triggers):

<ul><li><b>depression/mental illnesses</b>*<a href=""http://shopfront.livejournal.com/336661.html?#cutid2"">(1)</a> and related symptoms, or struggles with, are presented onscreen. This includes additional health struggles relating to the effects of internalised <strong>ableism</strong>.</li>
<li>additional specific warnings for <b>suicide</b> attempts, urges, imagery or idealation being involved in the fanwork in any manner.</li>
<li>specific warnings for physical forms of <b>self-harm</b>, urges for, etc. as above.</li>
<li><b>character death</b>: major or minor character(s), onscreen or off.</li>
<li>presence or reference to <b>dubious and/or non-consensual sexual activity</b>.*<a href=""http://shopfront.livejournal.com/336661.html?#cutid3"">(2)</a></li>
<li>explicit or implied <b>underage</b> sexual activity, whether all or only one/some of partners involved are below the relevant age(s) of consent.</li>
<li><b>incest</b> (biological, adoptive, step- or foster) in sexual and/or romantic activity, regardless of whether pairing list(s) make this explicit for those familiar with the fandom.</li>
<li>explicit, onscreen <b>violence</b>.</li>
<li>explicit <b>emotionally abusive onscreen relationships</b>, or lengthy reference to such previous/offscreen relationships.*<a href=""http://shopfront.livejournal.com/336661.html?#cutid3"">(2)</a></li></ul> 
</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Regular warnings note: (1)"">Further notes:
(1) I am most familiar with bipolar and other depression-presenting forms of mental illness. I will always attempt to warn for other forms of mental illness and problems which may arise because of them, but I would urge you to contact myself or another person to discuss any warnings you may require specific to other forms of mental illness.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Regular warnings note: (2)"">(2) I defer to the 'enthusiastic consent' school of sexual consent definitions, however I am prone to writing snapshot scenes and/or shorter stories in the four digit word count area and am also amenable to relationship dynamics that delve into power play, dominance and submission, etc. 

I will always attempt to make note when a fanwork may be read as containing emotional abusive or dubious sexual consent because I have left a key element establishing consent or absence of abuse (eg. a discussion negotiating consent guidelines for particular situations between existing sexual/romantic partners) offscreen. For various reasons, I judge myself as not always the most objective judge of whether it's clear in-text that this content cannot be read into the work. I recommend contacting myself or another person to discuss the content if you require stringent warnings for these forms of content.

<h3>Things I will not warn for:</h3>
I will not warn for the presence of any form of gender or sexual orientation or minority. <span lj:user=""queerlygen"" style=""white-space: nowrap;""><a href=""http://queerlygen.dreamwidth.org/profile""><img src=""http://s.dreamwidth.org/img/silk/identity/community.png"" alt=""[community profile] "" width=""16"" height=""16"" style=""vertical-align: text-bottom; border: 0; padding-right: 1px;"" /></a><a href=""http://queerlygen.dreamwidth.org/""><b>queerlygen</b></a></span> has an excellent breakdown of <a href=""http://queerlygen.dreamwidth.org/tag/mod:+rules+%26+guidelines"">what may be included under the definitions of gender or sexual orientations or minorities</a> in their community guidelines, if you require clarification.

Where consensual kinks may potentially push against common sex related triggers, I will endeavor to make such content explicit through other means, either through the fanwork summary, author's notes, or via a 'contains: ...' tag in the headers. However, please be aware that my desire to warn appropriately may sometimes conflict with the desire not to imply a connection between consensual kink and dubious or non-consensual sexual activities, or a lack of awareness of a consensual kink causing trigger issues. I am always happy to clarify on request.

I am happy to give individual warnings for anything I do not routinely warn for, excepting gender or sexual orientations/minorities, or to hear thoughts on anything that may be missing from my routine warnings.


<h3>Multi-media and non-written fanworks:</h3>
My content warning abilities are most reliable with fanworks that are all, or in the majority, written. I will always include content warnings on the above list where I intentionally intend to create or imply situations that require any of those warnings, however I judge myself as not always the most capable of picking up possible ambiguities in non-written forms - especially visual mediums - as I am more widely experienced with words.

I do not have personal experience with seizures or migraine triggered by bright flashes, or similar accessibility issues. I will always attempt to warn to the best of my ability if I am aware of such an issue in content I post or link to, but I encourage you to check with myself or another person if you have any concerns about the potential absence of these sorts of warnings.

Note: I nearly backdated this dear flist/circle, but then I realised I could always use a fail and/or clarification check from any of you so inclined. Also, if you've ever needed or wondered where I explicitly stood as far as warning usage goes in this journal, now you know. This has taken me a fair bit of time and space to be able to write out coherently after the last round of warnings discussion that I posted during, but it's been unintentionally timely in that some of the latest round of discussion has been informative in polishing this off.

<lj-cut text=""General stuff.""><strong><u>Some general info on me:</u></strong>
I'm super-excited about my assignment, so I really hope you're happy with yours as well and I haven't flummoxed you with any of my pairings! If I have, let me reassure you that I tend to ship because I adore both/all of the characters, so if you work from that premise you should be golden. 

As far as the bare minimum you need, there are things in fic that can harm my state of health <strong>(triggers: depression*/self-harm/suicide, and character death)</strong> that I'll obviously need you to avoid, but now I've got that out of the way you're welcome to stop here. I'd much prefer you write a story you can believe in than struggle to include anything I've written below, so please feel free to only take from this authors letter what will be helpful and discard the rest!

*I do, however, love it when characters in fandom represent a wider range of difference than we get in canon, so while I'd prefer you not write a story about one of my favourite ladies that dwells on the negative experiences of having a mental illness because I can't guarantee I'd be able to read it, I do love it when characters have a mental illness/monopolar depression/bipolar and it doesn't sum up everything interesting about them. So don't feel like you have to avoid the subject completely if you like to write that wider range, just stick to the positive side/portrayals. 




But if you would like more information about things I do and don't like, do read on... I really like happy endings because fic is usually my happy place. I don't mind angst but I really don't like unredeemingly dark fics (light at the end of the tunnel ftw). I love it when relationships tell us something more about the characters, I'm cool with mild bondage/kink if you write porny things, and I'm also cool with utterly non-porny things as well! I'm a big fan of fluff, I like it when characters don't believe in the whole ridiculous 'one true love' thing but they kind of feel that way about someone anyway, and I love it when characters are subtly physically affectionate with their loved ones. 

In regard to existing non-femslash relationships members of my pairings might be in: I like happy polyamorous situations, dislike sexuality labels, and really hate it when characters cheat for no real reason and handwave it like trust isn't a huge important thing in a relationship and listening to your downstairs brain is a good reason to sex up someone else without your partners permission. Sometimes people are flawed and mess up, and that's fine, but I like communication and acknowledgement if they do. I'm also totally cool with situations that allow for open canon relationships offscreen, crazy AUs, clearly very serious ideas like giving people amnesia to facilitate make outs without breaking up other relationships, or however else you might like to get around the things I don't like characters to do though! 

Basically, just respect the characters and their existing relationships in some fashion if you're writing within the current canon, and I'll love you forever. For instance, feel free to divorce Rory and Amy in Doctor Who so Amy can have lesbian make outs, I just need to believe that it was this huge difficult thing that acknowledges how important Rory is to Amy in canon first. But feel free to break up or not mention Larita/Mr Whittaker or Sarah/John in Easy Virtue just 'cause it's easier, because there wasn't really a chance for them to become serious, important romantic relationships. 




</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Doctor Who.""><strong><u>1. Doctor Who: Amy Pond/Lady Christina de Souza</u></strong>
What I really love about these women is that neither of them is shy. They both kissed the Doctor! Neither of them feel the need to wait for his permission or guidance! They're both very capable of confounding a 900 year old alien genius! My biggest lament about Lady Christina is that she met Ten, not Eleven, because she left us too soon and I think Eleven would totally have hustled her into his TARDIS like the clever thing he is. I pretty much love very similar things about Amy and Christina, and I'd love to see them adventuring together and leaving the Doctor all bewildered in dust (it's totally my favourite thing when the human characters gather and giggle about the Doctor while he waitwhat?'s in their general direction.) 

But I have to admit that I'm not a big fan of cheating!Amy or insecure!Rory. So if you'd like to perhaps AU it, divorce them, or write Rory being okay with an open relationship at some point in the future because they travel with the Doctor together for ages and he gets all secure while they do so, or maybe strand Amy somewhere with amnesia and have Christina ride to her rescue, that'd be totally awesome. But since the finale I also totally OT3 Amy, Rory and the Doctor, so if you want to Amy to psh-posh Christina's 'er, aren't you married?' by her saying Rory's happily entertained with the Doctor at that particular moment, you would make my little multi-shipper heart very happy. 

I'm afraid I have very little in the way of ideas and die-hard preferences to offer beyond that though, because I really don't mind what or how you write them, as long as they're both kicking arse and taking names and making out! So really, feel free to give them a moving monogamous relationship or just get Amy and Christina to have a heart thumping, adventure thrilled fling, or anything in between!
</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Merlin.""><strong><u>2. Merlin: Morgana/Nimueh</u></strong>
I'd love to see something set in a future where Nimueh didn't really die (because Merlin mastered the power of life and death instinctually? Really? Really really?) or an AU. Perhaps a history repeating theme with a Morgause who was originally opposed to Nimueh's more extreme methods, and - through Morgause - Morgana has now met Nimueh and is confronted with the same problem of ideological conflict with more experienced (hot!) mentor(s) already pushed to their limits by Uther. 

There also aren't enough modern Merlin AUs with girlslash instead of the boys, or it'd be really lovely and sweet to see something set in a world where Uther didn't go totally bonkers and Nimueh was free to train and guide Morgana in her magic and they could just be magical and awesome and happy and there was less burning people at the stake and general angst.

I didn't put Morgause/Morgana in my pairings list because, well, I do sometimes struggle with the hot vs. incestuous thing, plus it's an easier/more popular pairing and I'd really love to see me some more Morgana/Nimueh, hee. But I do also ship them like crazy and am totally happy with including Morgause in the femslash fun in some fashion if you like to write threesomes, triangles, backstory or multi-pairing fics, as long as there's still plenty of the Morgana/Nimueh for me to enjoy. So feel free to add her to the mix if you so prefer or it facilitates your particular plot bunny! I'm also totally okay with you including Morgause to more easily hook Morgana and Nimueh up (Nimueh as Morgause's magical mentor is very much my personal canon), but respecting the whole sisters arrangement and not incestuously slashing them, because I think Morgana and Morgause are adorable however you decide to read the way they smile and dance around each other.

<lj-cut text=""The Vampire Diaries.""><strong><u>3. The Vampire Diaries: Elena/Caroline/Bonnie, Jenna/Isobel</u></strong>
First up, I'm only familiar with the show at present, so I'm super sorry if you tend towards the books and got assigned to me for TVD because I have zip knowledge on them beyond the assumption that there's some degree of similarity with the television series. I don't mind at all if you want to write something that could fit in either canon though, assuming of course I can understand it without having read the books yet. A general squick I also have for this fandom is dismissing Caroline as silly, shallow, someone who doesn't need to be given as much consideration, etc. just because she acts her age - give her depth and emotional weight and importance without rewriting that she frequently acts like a typical teenager who hasn't figured herself or the world out yet, and I will totally fall at your feet and worship.

<em>Elena/Caroline/Bonnie</em>
I would be perfectly happy to take these three together any way I can get it! But I should warn you I have a bit of a squick for characters agreeing on polyamory and it ending up being more of a jealous triangle fic. Jealous triangles I can totally get behind though, as long as they're self-aware and admitted jealous triangles! Beyond that, go nuts. Feel free to write any pair out of these three as the romantic relationship and slip the third girl in in a flirty, past, or unrequited fashion. Or put a new spin on the romantic triangle and have them each crush on another without anyone reciprocating a crush, for an endless circle jerk of angst! Genuine bicurioisty, subtexty longing, functioning and happy polyamory, or really whatever floats your boat is also totally fine by me.

As far as canon relationships go, these three characters are an exception for me, in that I don't mind how you handle existing relationships. Feel free to just pretend they don't exist without working in a reason or engineering a situation that doesn't mean Elena or Caroline are cheating on Matt/Stefan/Damon! I am so totally behind you still doing so if you'd like to, it's just not going to ping any cheating issues for me if you don't address it.

If you'd like some more specific prompts to kick off with: Caroline's little joke that Elena's anti-vampire-compulsion gift was a lesbian love token makes me giggle forever and ever, I think Elena might appear all femme but she'd go all butch when it comes to courting girls, I find Bonnie going all macho bodyguard over Elena to be smoking hot, it's my own personal canon that Caroline gets snarky sometimes because she and Elena had the beginnings of a fling that got abruptly curtailed by Elena's horrid summer of horridness and she's totally bitter, and Caroline's insecurity totally needs to be fixed with ladysexing.

<em>Jenna/Isobel</em>
If I was feeling all confessiony right now, I'd probably just tell you that I find Jenna hot, and I find Isobel hot, and I want them to be hot together. If I felt like engaging my upstairs brain I'd also have to say all the messed up intricacies of Elena's new pseudo-mum and her bio-mum getting it on is more intriguing than I would ever have thought, and writer to writer I have to say that the question of how a curious Isobel might finagle Jenna into bed when she can't use compulsion makes me really excited, only, I'm totally stumped on the how. To be perfectly honest, as much as I love that the show gives us all these wonderful scenes between female characters, I kind of wish Jenna hadn't been the one to track down Isobel because it takes away my quick fix of Isobel being curious about Elena/her life, and Jenna being clueless about Isobel's identity. On the other hand, there's also nothing to say that there can't have been human on human college experimentation, or a vampire on human night of memory clouding drunken debauchery that might pop back up in Jenna's mind at the perfect 'oh shit' moment later on! 
</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""La Femme Nikita.""><strong><u>4. La Femme Nikita: Nikita/Quinn</u></strong>
While my heart is not totally closed to the wonders of Michael and Birkoff, Nikita is simply too awesome to be wasted on men. But I suffered the fate of the picky femslasher and couldn't find much in the way of pairings I could really feel for until the very end of the show, when they very considerately gave me Quinn!

Nikita is essentially my pre-BSG Kara Thrace. I consider her my own personal lesbian catnip, mmm. Quinn is cute, and devious, and everything all the people who were always pulling Nikita's strings wanted her to be, and I just love that contrast. How I see them together would have to include Quinn being the one to approach Nikita, and Nikita needing to be really worn down before she'd take that particular gamble. I also really love the juxtaposition of Quinn's emotions and her ambitions in her relationship with Operations, and I'd love to see that played out even more in a relationship with Nikita.

I kind of love the idea of Nikita forcibly making Quinn shape up, and Quinn sneaking around and being all sweetly evil anyway. I also don't really like the idea of Nikita and Michael waiting for anyone and being all lonely for so such a long time, not even each other, and I think Nikita would seriously need someone to keep her warm and have her back once he's gone. And we already know warming the beds of powerful people is so Quinn's thing, and Nikita is now officially the most powerful person within her circle of work acquaintances, hee. If going post-series isn't your thing, perhaps you'd care to share the story behind how Nikita managed to subdue Quinn so she could take her appearance, and perhaps her tactic involved sexy times. Or maybe explore Quinn being super conflicted once she realises Nikita is poised to become quite powerful and that she's totally played her cards wrong.
</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""One Tree Hill.""><strong><u>5. One Tree Hill: Brooke/Quinn, Brooke/Lindsay</u></strong>
The real key to understanding the way I femslash ship in OTH is understanding that I have a massive crush on Brooke Davis and despite the bazillion femslash options I struggle to settle on a girl ship for her. I was totally thrilled by Brooke/Rachel for a while there, but then they went and messed it up when they jumped four years, grump. But I basically think Brooke's the best thing since sliced bread and I really want to see a girl show her that relationships don't have to end up all doom and gloom like she's found with the boys, because I really want to see her happy and in my mind happiness requires life affirming lesbian sex. 

The core of my shipping Brooke with Quinn and Lindsay is that they're all awesome, and they'd be mind blowingly hot together, and I love that they have creativity in common. I'd really love to see Brooke connecting with Quinn or Lindsay over their respect creative loves, because I don't think the show really explores that aspect of Brooke very well. I think she gets short changed in favour of celebrating Peyton's creativity a lot, which is a real shame. It's all fashion is fashionable, and profitable, and fame and fortune and blahblah she loves it, but it never really approaches Brooke as a person who is simply creative or who makes art, and I'd love to see that rectified in fic. 

I also adore the whole Brooke wants to adopt storyline, and I'd really love to see that played out as something to soothe the shock of finding out she can't have children and validating that adoption is not greater or less than biological children, and because I would eat up happy domestic fic where Brooke's children have two mummies with a spoon. I also love the idea of Brooke with a long term female partner because I like to see storylines where women adopt because they want to adopt, not just because they're both women.

I think I definitely see Brooke as someone who would be straight until she met the right woman, but once she met the right woman she'd just sort of shrug and say screw the world, because she understands the importance of having love and family in your life. I also think she'd still be a total sexy mother who rocks her partners world, if you did decide to go the domestic happy family times route. Mostly I just want to see Brooke happy and fulfilled and in love, and building her family, and being awesome, however you want to put that together and whoever you want to write her with. :D
</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Easy Virtue.""><strong><u>6. Easy Virtue: Larita/Sarah</u></strong>
Larita is awesome and hot, and Sarah is awesome and hot, and once you take Colin Firth out of the equation there's really nothing better than the idea of them being awesome and hot together. I adore this movie, and I adore the idea of both these characters together, so you could basically just go nuts with it. Basically I like the idea of Larita being exactly like she is in the movie, and Sarah blossoming and fulfilling all that wonderful potential she has.

Some possible ideas could include Sarah being inspired to want something more than a convenient, friendly marriage after Larita's speech at the end of the movie. Sarah revealing that she could only ever have been friends with John if they married because she's really a die hard lesbian at heart, or a missing scene where Sarah agrees to forgive John for not warning her he was married if he let's her hit that (because the whole oh my goodness John, I totally forgive you, she's totally gorgeous thing wasn't subtexty at all!) I'd also love something along the lines of Sarah distracting Larita from all that boring country living, or Sarah finally rebelling against the understanding little future country wife mould everyone's always expected of her and going to find Larita in the city. If you prefer to keep Sarah more like she is in the movie, I'm also totally down with her remaining totally comfortable with living her life in the country, but perhaps she maintains contact with Larita and heads off for a girls weekend of wild times in the city with her every once in a while? I can't see her taking a no for an answer if she wanted to go post-marrying John, after all! Or perhaps she doesn't do the expected and marry John, but runs her future estate on her own and continues to be an English countryside BAMF, and Larita occasionally comes to visit for the weekend, etc.

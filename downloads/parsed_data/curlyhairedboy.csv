"event","i should have pictures of cumberland island up sometime next week.  they should actually be worth the effort of updating.

ok. so the update.

i wish i could write about trees. but it doesn't work.
instead, i find myself wanting to right about walking down cold streets with dull lamps after getting coffee alone.  my thoughts seem like cud.  the same shit over and over again.

recently i've been criticized for being too philosophically ecocentric at the risk of pushing away personal relationships.
and i think that's true.
i'm working on not being an ass.
i got to smoke a hookah with two anarcho-johnnies last friday night.  being around people who have an unapologetic desire to live in the 1920s made me realize how pessimistic and bitter i'd become 
their talk of *people*(not environmental) history and class economics helped me reground myself in my own species.  and i think i expanded their ideas to include the generation and distibution of electricity and food(more localized)  bah.  i sound boring.

it seems ridiculous that i'm thinking about the fact that i think about thinking too much.  

i felt really lonely driving home from the coffee shop tonight.  i was heading west and wanted a good reason to keep going.
i think i'm only going to school so that i can learn something to help people/the environment.  if i didn't care.  i think i'd become a bum or vagrant.  like the skibums in colorado.  i'd want to be a beatbum.  hah! excellent.  a dharmabum.  :- P  

i know i can get really good seasonal work with the park service or forest service.  and i would go around backpacking all over the place and take pictures and write about it.  and collect everything to show other people and try to figure out the most correct way to live.
what is most ethical about living.

but it would be difficult to actually have my work/life be a positive influence on anything.  i would just feel really selfish with that kind of lifestyle.  besides... i can only fit so many books into a backpack ... and i'm a book packrat.

do other people ask themselves if they are leading a good life?  i worry that i worry about it too much.
so ... redo:
1. brian thinks that cities are not as perfect as nature and thus fallible, which makes them easier to write about and to put ideas into context  -- it also makes the beauty easier to talk about b/c it inherently isn't as beautiful.
2.  cross-pollinitation of niche radical ideas is good.
3.  brian talks to much.
4.  cool pictures will be posted soon."

i hung out with stephen(my french friend) this past saturday night and some of his friends at a metal/hardcore show.
i don't think i'm built for that kind of music.
iron and wine next month!  (that makes me very happy)
i want to hang out in a moody emoish liberal art scene?
do we have that in bham or ttown?
does tuscaloosa even have decent espresso? (is cobblestone any good?)

for a college town, comparative to other southern college towns i've been to(mainly in georgia) - tuscaloosa is lacking.

has anyone been to the coffeeshop near montevallo? eclipse?
that's my new goal.  check out that coffee shop.

o yeah... poetry or spoken word.  where does that happen in tuscaloosa(b/c i know it does)?"

if this was your first election or you're a seasoned expert in molotov cocktails.  don't give up.  i'll allow the above experts to speak for me.

but we should use this build up of energy.  we should use our anger.  our disgust with this current radical militaristic approach.  

we live in the 'heartland' and share the same faith.  same morals and values of our southern contemporaries.  *we* can change the future by standing up for moral certainty.  true spiritual values.  what is right is what is good!

helping the poor! helping the elderly! helping our mothers and fathers and childern live in a society of love.  and kindness.  true compassionate politics.  from jesus to buddha -- democratic values, liberal values, community values!

it is not only a 'good thing' but our duty to society to help both politically and culturally to improve conditions for all humankind.

we *cannot* belive that personal ownership and individual hardwork has gotten us what you have.  that belief is based on an ungrateful attitude that everyone who's ever lived before -- family, friends, unborn children, homeless mothers, presidents, philosophers, workers --  ment nothing  

that we have no responsibility for society

i'll sum it up with this:

are mirror images
and when we kiss they're perfectly aligned. 

And I have to speculate
that God Himself did make
us into corresponding shapes
like puzzle pieces from the clay. 

And true it may seem like a stretch
but it's thoughts like this that catch
my troubled head when you're away
and when I am missing you to death. 

And when you are out there on the road
for several weeks of shows
and when you scan the radio
I hope this song will guide you home. 

they will see us waving from such great heights
""come down now"" they'll say
but everything looks perfect from far away
""come down now"" but we'll stay 

I tried my best to leave
this all on your machine
but the persistent beat
it sounded thin upon the sending. 

and that frankly will not fly
you'll hear the shrillest highs

 Just Don't Think I'll Ever Get Over You
By Colin Hay

I drink good coffee every morning / Comes from a place that's far away / And when I'm done I feel like talking / Without you here there is less to say 

I don't want you thinking I'm unhappy / What is closer to the truth / That if I lived till I was 102 / I just don't think I'll ever get over you

I'm no longer moved to drink strong whisky / 'Cause I shook the hand of time and I knew / That if I lived till I could no longer climb my stairs / I just don't think I'll ever get over you

Your face it dances and it haunts me / Your laughter's still ringing in my ears / I still find pieces of your presence here / Even after all these years

But I don't want you thinking I don't get asked to dinner / 'Cause I'm here to say that I sometimes do / Even though I may soon feel the touch of love / I just don't think I'll ever get over you

If I lived till I was 102 / I just don't think I'll ever get over you

would i still reach enlightenment breathing in bad air?
would the bodhi tree grow there? here?

where's my bodhi tree?
what path has heart...?

i'm feeling good now... is this heart?

i want to live beneath the dirt... 

i was gonna be all cool ... james dean style 
but that never works out

one step at a time...

the earth is ours ... 

diet cherry coke and library lawns... a cowpoke      with a cowpoke yawn... closed down books under a lazy     sunday       tree
mexicana mescalito ... to play a gentle song... a boook that smells like grass
yr
never going to find me where you look

call a phone you're never there
there you are... but what do i care
broken hearts and little nests
cold and empty
rest?

i was walking through a forest ... and i came across two diverging paths...
one with heart (maybe)... one with self-preservation and happieness(maybe)

what should i pick... ?

for living in a tent... there's never enough time anymore.
this summer is ... inten(t)se (pun-- laugh.)

how many trail crew members does it take to screw in a lightbulb?
trail crews don't screw in lightbulbs... they screw in tents.
(insert laugh here)

i'm a h00t and a half.  

the guru was awesome...
ken kesey style.

the ability to hold both a toothpick and cigar in ones mouth at the same time... 

maybe that's my bodhi tree... 
a mala of scuzzy boards.  

""loading buddy lists""  -- does it matter if it comes up?  what would i say to people...?

hi.  i'm not at all in your life right now... in fact... this is much like the movie ghost... and yr whoopie.  (did you see the yr?  that means i cool. <jk>)
and why am i bothering you?  b/c i might be holding too long... heart heart heart heart heart.... (melt wizard style)

idk... ramblin' joe shmoe down on the street said i need to stop tizziping.

i want to see my grandfather.
and my mom
and my dad
and scott
and part of me hopes chris lives with us in the fall
and i love all of them

and BAMA! w00t buddy.

the sticky hot stinky humid hot icky air...  
with the most beautiful forests.  and waterfallssssssssssss
and oysters... in not a vegi with oyoyoyoyoysterssss around
(or scallops and sushi... at sakura... by the window... and tears... so many wonderful painful tears... )

((o fishsticks... turn the page, wash ya' hands))

maybe i can drown my heart in ocean drops and trees. 

to be remorseful of what was... than to have what is kill ya'?

idk...(i always always ... couldn't stand... 'idk')

not even the benefactor of 'i don't know'  but idk.

lets speed type emotions.

bloop blibbity blop 

ok... end the typing.
now."

a week until i go backcountry for a month.

i'm having an ok time.

the disc in my back is acting up a little.

i'm not going to road trip.  

everyone should listen to 'suckerpunch' by pain.

i'm in a lot better shape.  

this is extrememly fragmented.

i hope everyone is doing ok.

it feels good to be quiet a lot.

i've started to enjoy the sound of children. (i didn't for a while).

things feel better.

when i poke myself i feel like me.

it is odd to look at my hands without gloves on.  tactile sensations have become increased.

except for my thumb.  there is a whole in the glove where my thumb is used to being on my right hand.  i don't have much sensation there.

the cuts on my arms (from the rocks) are getting better.  i'm stuck on the rock wall for another week b/c my crew is doing so well they don't want to move us to james' peak.

for some reason i just felt and feel really tired.

i'm looking foward to home.  though i don't know what i'll do."

:)

-start heading down the mountain when you see black clouds.
-marmots are cute... but do not pet them
-relationships shouldn't need too much 'working on'; being yourself should be work enough.
-don't think as much and just be...
-be confident... insecurities suck
-be yourself... and don't think too much about it.
-there is no good reason to be mean
-life's too short, why be mean?
-wash your nuckels
-experiment with out-of-doors pooping techniques.
-some work gloves are more equal than others
-no rocks are equal
-crush fill, eh?
-i have some moral problems with building trails
-practice not talking
-be flexible with life
-sometimes you just have to shove your hand into the frozen glove
-you waisted life, why wouldn't you waiste death?
-god is crying, he doesn't like our rock wall
-eat less
-go to the bathroom, it will warm you up
-sit up straight.

ok... i think i have some issues

i think that rain is more beautiful than mountains.
i think that tree shade is more beautiful than the sun
the new growth on the pines tastes really good.
i don't like bleak things.
i miss hardwoods.
my natural odour is strong but a little sweet.

colorado is full of want-to-be miners.

i think the valleys and storms are the most beautiful parts.  everyone disagrees with me.

i saw a snowflake ths size of my palm.

i'm suppose to climb 4 thirteeners tomorrow. i get up at 4:30.

town is odd.

chicks dig scars.

i'm gonna get a tonnes of gear from the continental divide trail people.  but i don't think i'll get to work in the wind rivers. :(

i haven't really 'bonded' with anyone out here.  but i'm becoming friends with some of the local y0kels.

i haven't really found a 'friend' in anyone i'm working with though(i'm pretty sure being a 'know-it-all' turning them off to me.  also... everyone is almost TOO laid back... if that makes sense?).

i get super home sick.  nothing out here is like bama. BAMA! and being 'liberal' is trendy so i get bad(?fake?) 'vibes'(a word that is very useful) from a lot of people.  i've become more proficient in spanish though. :)

and i've lost a good bit of wieght.  and have muscles i didn't know were there. (like in my tummy).

i drink espresso(when i can get it) religiously.  like right now.
and don't have aim or gaim or any fun thing like.  :(

and if you can read this... i miss you.

i miss the twang.

and the good vibes from people who have to really question what they believe.

and i miss MY music.  i've been listening to way way way too much 'hippy' music.  ugh.  no belle & sebastion.  no iron and wine.  no mogwai. radiohead. or pedro the lion or any other depresso music that i like.  no PAIN. or muddy waters.

but i did see a band last night... purple buddha.  they were a bluesy jammy bandy thing.  really good.  female lead. 

anywho. i'm gonna go get a veggie burrito.  adios. 
i'll update again later."

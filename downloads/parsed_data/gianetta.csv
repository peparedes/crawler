"event","We had a great vacation last week. &nbsp;

We spent 1.5 days outside Seattle with Adam&#39;s family, including his parents, grandma, cousin &amp; family, and aunt &amp; uncle. &nbsp;We had a really good visit. &nbsp;It was very relaxing, and I got to see eaglets hopping around on the edge of their nest getting ready to fledge.

Another 2 days were spent in Portland with college friends. We hiked at Eagle Creek (I think that&#39;s the name), which is lovely and has a waterfall at the end of the two mile trail. &nbsp;Unfortunately, some of the trail is up high with narrow ledges, which are not so good in my world, but I did OK. &nbsp;I have learned not to let people who are training for a marathon set the pace. . . &nbsp;We also got to see a bit more of Portland - yummy brunch, homemade ice cream - Strawberry Honey Balsamic with Black Pepper, ginormous fabric store (batiks 35% off!!!), and fabulous food-truck food court. &nbsp;It was nice to see everyone.

We spent our last 1.5 days &nbsp;in Florence, OR, visiting Adam&#39;s brother and his wife and new baby. &nbsp;It was stressful - parents-in-law had been there for a couple of days already, baby cries more often than not when not sleeping or eating, baby&#39;s mother isn&#39;t keen on letting grandparents hold the baby because he cries for anyone other than her, etc. &nbsp;It was very foreign to me. &nbsp;In my world, if a baby is crying, we pass around the baby and let everyone try to make the baby stop crying. &nbsp;We entertain it by singing or bouncing or walking around. &nbsp;If all else fails, the mother takes the child, but it&#39;s expected that grandparents and aunts/uncles are competent to help the baby settle down. &nbsp;At one point over dinner, Adam&#39;s dad said to the mother that if it was OK, he&#39;d like to hold the baby today because he didn&#39;t get a chance to hold him at all yesterday. &nbsp;In my world, the mother would respond, &quot;of course, you can hold him today - I&#39;m sure he won&#39;t be as grumpy as he was yesterday.&quot; &nbsp;The mother just looked at him without responding. &nbsp;In my world, baby&#39;s grandfather gripes about not getting to hold the baby because the baby&#39;s aunts (sisters and me) are being baby hogs - he&#39;s mostly joking because we live out of town and he knows that he can hold the baby any time he wants. &nbsp;When I first asked if I could hold the baby, the mother said that I could try, but that he always cries when Patty (Adam&#39;s mom, who was sitting 5 feet away) holds him. &nbsp;WTF - in what universe is it OK to say something like that to the grandmother of your child? &nbsp;I felt so bad for Adam&#39;s mom, who is so excited to be a grandmother. &nbsp;At least she has a niece (above-mentioned cousin, who has a flaky mother - Patty&#39;s sister) who is thrilled to have her involved in her son&#39;s life.

I feel bad for the mother because she&#39;s stuck out in the country in Guam (4 hours from where they lived before they moved to Florence) while her husband works long hours. &nbsp;She almost certainly had very little say in our/grandparents&#39; visit - grandparents hadn&#39;t even decided when they were going to leave - there is no way I&#39;d allow an open-ended visit from relatives, even without a 2.5 month old baby in the house. &nbsp;Her husband is a good guy, but a bit of a flake about some things. &nbsp;Baby was born almost full term, but only weighed 4.5 pounds and has had problems eating. &nbsp;He cries a lot. &nbsp;Still, it was downright unpleasant at times.

Overall, it was a good trip, but I am very glad to be home."

"event","I&#39;ve mostly given up recording this year&#39;s bloom times because the weather has been so crazy. &nbsp;Many of our plants started blooming weeks earlier than usual. &nbsp;I have coneflowers (in early MAY!) with buds on them. &nbsp;I pruned the roses a bit later than usual because I didn&#39;t want them to put out new growth at the tail end of our warm winter, so they&#39;re blooming at a fairly normal time, but a lot of other things are out of whack.

I&#39;m terrified of the thought of this 10-20 degrees above normal trend continuing into the summer. &nbsp;Twenty degrees above average is divine in March, but is not so good in July and August. &nbsp;As a result, the only plants we&#39;ve purchased this spring are half a dozen trees and shrubs that Adam really wanted and that he promised to water through the summer if necessary. &nbsp;We transplanted maybe a dozen plants that absolutely needed to move - if they weren&#39;t going to die over the summer in their current location, they stayed put and were added on the &#39;to be moved&#39; list for fall.

I so want to divide and spread around the perennials that are growing like crazy this spring, but I&#39;m being smart and waiting until fall. &nbsp;We have three trips planned for this summer, and worrying about new plants while you&#39;re away is a pain. &nbsp;We have timers for our irrigation lines, but they&#39;re not automated, so setting them up involves setting up a bunch of hoses throughout the yard. &nbsp;It&#39;s doable for a handful of beds, but we can&#39;t do it for the whole garden. &nbsp;Even when we are home, watering in the middle of the summer stinks. &nbsp;My mature, established plants only need extra water from me when it&#39;s really dry, but young and recently transplanted plants often need more help if they are planted or moved right before summer kicks in.

I&#39;m planning to divide more of the white cranesbill/geranium that came &nbsp;with the house. &nbsp;It does a great job shading out weeds and covering our roses&#39; &nbsp;ugly legs after the blackspot claims half of their foliage in the summer. &nbsp;The groundcover veronicas have also grown very well and keep down the weeds - I&#39;m hoping to help it spread throughout the entire rose bed and several other beds. &nbsp;Groundcovers like veronica, pinks, and creeping phlox are much less work than keeping a bed mulched every year and/or weeding by hand. &nbsp;We&#39;re hoping to replace almost all of the front lawn with beds of shrubs and groundcovers, with a handful of perennials, which I should resist because I&#39;m reaching my capacity for caring for them, but I love them so much, and the divisions are free, so I&#39;ll probably divide and spread them around too.

Some of the perennials are just too much work for their bang, and those likely will be pulled unless I really love them, but the Siberian irises look good over 3/4 of the year, as do the veronicas, pinks, and phloxes. &nbsp;The shasta daisies are quite vigorous in the front border - they&#39;ll need to be divided, and I like them enough to spread them around, even if they require a bit of work on occasion. &nbsp;Every year I say that I&#39;m not going to divide my favorite short (16-18&quot;) reblooming white German irises, but they grow so quickly that autumn rolls around and I can&#39;t resist digging them up and making more of them to plant all over the place. The deer seem to have no interest in them, so I can even use them in front of the house.

I may live to regret planting normal (non-clumping) obedient plant, which is anything but obedient in how it runs through a bed, but it&#39;s a native plants and is quite lovely en masse. &nbsp;If anyone wants some of the &#39;Vivid&#39; cultivar, I have plenty to share, but it needs a lot of space and doesn&#39;t play particularly well with other plants. &nbsp;It both seeds AND runs. &nbsp;The clumping white cultivar &#39;Miss Manners&#39; is a real clumper - it has grown quickly, but it doesn&#39;t run as most obedient plants do. &nbsp;I&#39;ve never dug up an obedient plant (other than pulling stray &#39;Vivid&#39; plants), but I think it&#39;s pretty easy to divide. &nbsp;We&#39;ll find out this fall."

"event","So I hate the title of this book because I don't like to call people fat and I don't think it appropriate to suggest that heavy people should do something about it.  That said, the research summarized in this book turns the convention wisdom about obesity on its head.  

I have the establishment's rebuttal & the author's rebuttal to that in PDF form - I recommend reading all of them & making up your own mind.

"event","I had a great time at Coronation.  We brought an old college friend to her first event.  I don't expect that she'll join the SCA, but I think she had a good time, and she might come to future events with us.  I was thrilled to see so many people I know and like at the event.  There are so many incredible people in CM - I do hope to become more active locally in the future.
 
M&S's last court was touching - it takes strength to apologize before several hundred people - although probably not what I would have chosen for a friend's first SCA court.  I think she got it that it was not the normal way of things.  TRM's court was excellent - they both have solid stage presence and know how to project.  I have a couple of favorite sets of royalty, and TRM are among them.  We got there early because 1) we were tired of standing, and 2) wanted to be able to hear, so we got good seats and had a good view and could hear almost everything.  M. Gaston's Pelican ceremony was very sweet, and S. Bryce's Non Pareil well-deserved.  I don't know the other people (I know who Moe is, but I don't actually know him personally), but I'm sure their awards were well-deserved as well, and it was cool to see the first equestrian grant-level awards given out.  It seemed to be the day of manly men crying in court, which was awesome.
 
I was quite inspired by all of the cool clothes and other A&S at the event.  My wrists have been bothering me a bit lately, so I think I need to focus on machine sewing, which is easier on the wrists, for awhile.  I owe Adam a new outfit anyway.  I wore my new red wool outfit yesterday, and it was pretty comfortable.  I need to finish and attach the sleeves, but it was far too humid for sleeves yesterday, so it's all good.  I need to make a shirt with a higher collar/ruffle - the one I was wearing kept slipping because it is too short for the doublet collar. I have some nice white linen from Pennsic that will be perfect for that.
 
We're hoping to get back to Italian rapier in the near future.  Adam's shoulder is recovering nicely - he's pretty much done with physical therapy sessions and will continue at home after this next week.  While Adam has been recovering, I've been focusing on gaining strength so that I can hold the stance (and the sword) for longer periods of time.  I've made some progress, but need to continue to work on it.  I don't have much of a competitive soul, so I don't have a lot of interest in SCA rapier tournaments, but I'm very interested in studying rapier as A&S and 'competing' against individuals in informal bouts.
 
After seeing all of the nifty A&S displays at the past few events, I sometimes think I want to enter a competition, but I'm not convinced it would make me happy.  I don't like to win and I don't like to lose.  Getting feedback on my projects would be good for me, I'm sure, and I appreciate all of the time judges put into judging (they looked very serious when we were in the A&S tent yesterday, which is why I didn't stop to say hi), but I don't know that written comments from unknown judges would help or hinder my desire to make cool stuff.  Maybe I'll do a display at KA&S this coming year, although I've been working on so many different projects that I probably would have to put a lot of new work into putting together a coherent display other than 'stuff that has amused Gianetta in the past year' (aka 'projects that Gianetta decided to get around to finishing while y'all were at Pennsic.'
 
I've been thinking about what I'd like to teach in the future.  There are a few things that I could teach the basics, but I don't have the depth of knowledge or experience to be a great teacher.  I'd probably be comfortable teaching these things locally (e.g., if the locals wanted to try card weaving), but not at a university.  Sadly, the card weaving seems to be hard on my wrists, even if I wear my braces, so that's a no-go for now.  I'm hoping to have the garage cleaned out and set up as a workshop in the next few (or many) months, at which point I'd like to get some basic pewter casting gear.  I really want to start lampworking, but I fear that turning the beads for long periods of time would be hard on my wrists, so I think that needs to wait."

"event","I was shocked to learn that the pants that match my&nbsp;hand sewn&nbsp;red wool doublet fit me just fine. &nbsp;I hadn't gotten around to finishing the closures, so I can add them now rather than moving them.
 
I'd forgotten that I was unhappy with how they turned out (it has been YEARS since I started this project). &nbsp;I had been trying to make them shorter and fuller than my other pants, and the shorter-than-usual lining pulled them up too much, making them bunch up in a bad way. &nbsp;I think that I can fix them by making a new lining, which shouldn't be that much work. &nbsp;It'd be less work if I sewed it by machine, but I think I'll baste it by machine, check the fit by pinning it into the pants, then sew it by hand. &nbsp;I don't want an all-but-the-pants-lining hand sewn outfit.

Not sure if I can get it done by 30-year, but I think I can have the doublet done by then if I get off my butt. &nbsp;If I finish it, we're guaranteed to have 95F-in-the-shade weather for the event. &nbsp;Maybe I should plan to wear the new Viking dress instead so that it's cold enough to wear the new doublet."

"event","Apparently it is still scandalous to say that a particular food is bad for you. &nbsp;No, eating dessert every once in awhile will not kill you, but there's evidence suggesting that eating it regularly might. (see Gary Taubes's books). &nbsp;

The latest research (below) just says that eating more of particular foods is associated with greater weight gain. &nbsp;This should not be shocking. &nbsp;Drinking sugar water (i.e., soda and juice) will not make you feel less hungry, but gives you a lot of calories. &nbsp;More calories plus not feeling full after drinking it equals eating more calories and gaining weight. &nbsp;Consume the same number of calories of fat and protein and you will feel less hungry and eat less later in the day.

A researcher is quoted in the article as saying she was surprised that potatoes were associated with a greater weight gain than were desserts. &nbsp;Not rocket science. &nbsp;A potato is sugar wrapped in some fiber if you eat the skin, which most Americans don't. &nbsp;Most people don't eat desserts regularly *and pretend that they're a healthy food*. &nbsp;Even people who like their sweets know that they're not a health food and should be eaten in moderation. &nbsp;People have been taught, though, that potatoes are good for us, so we eat them all the time and serve them to our children without feeling guilty, as we would if half of every meal we served were cake or pie.

http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304791204576401951936407230.html?mod=WSJ_hp_mostpop_read

For the past few months, I've been avoiding large amounts of added sugar and empty carbs (potatoes, bread, rice, etc.) and have felt great - no hypoglycemia. &nbsp;I spent all of yesterday at a work meeting. &nbsp;I had some yogurt (fatty and full of protein, no sugar) in the morning, but the parfait I had on the trip up there and everything they had at the meeting for breakfast&nbsp;was practically pure sugar. &nbsp;I ended up pouring myself half a cup of cream and topping it off with a bit of coffee so that I'd have something other than sugar to eat. &nbsp;Later in the day, I ended up drinking orange juice to keep my blood sugar up and eating a sandwich (at least it had mozzarella on it) and cookies for lunch. &nbsp;I felt horrible last night and woke up this morning with a blinding headache.&nbsp;

After seeing the difference in how I feel if I cut back on sugar and reading Gary Taubes's summary of the research on the relationship between sugar and chronic disease and obesity (and the commonly accepted biological mechanisms that could be responsible for the connection), I'm becoming more and more convinced that fat isn't bad for you, although some kinds are better than others. &nbsp;Sugar - by which I mean carbs, on the other hand, seems to be poison if you convince a population that there are no 'bad' foods - so they can have dessert every night - and give them permission to eat lots of bread, rice, potatoes, and fruit juice because they are good for us.&nbsp;

I haven't given up carbs completely. &nbsp;I still eat whole fruit, but I try to eat it with protein and fat (in yogurt is awesome), and I eat things like pasta and bread the way I eat sweets. &nbsp;I don't eat any of it at home - if it's in the fridge, I will eat too much of it because I don't have a lot of self control when it comes to eating carbs. &nbsp;I'm not going to pass up the sesame pasta or really good bread at a friend's house or restaurant, but I take a little bit instead of the big gobs I want because I know I'll feel better if I don't binge on carbs."

"event","Semi-annual rant about separation of 'church' and 'state'* in the SCA:

It is my personal belief that the appropriate role of a kingdom's royalty is to serve as beloved figureheads for the kingdom. &nbsp;They lead us into battle, praise the troops and artisans, give awards to deserving people, and kiss babies. &nbsp;These are 'in game' functions that contribute to the ambiance of events and make the SCA more than a bunch of weirdos in funny clothes. &nbsp;These are not 'easy' duties - not everyone has the acting and public speaking abilities (or ability to make a heart-felt, if awkwardly delivered, speech) required to do it well. They need to be able to see who is deserving of awards and be capable of handling delicate situations diplomatically. &nbsp;&nbsp;

In my ideal world, Their job is to be respected and adored by Their populace. &nbsp;It is our job to respect and adore Them (or skip court if you can't stomach faking it). &nbsp;I expect that it is similar for other segments of the SCA population, but I was taught as a beginning rapier fighter that we fight for our Queen (yes, we love our King too - blah, blah, blah... but we all knew that we belonged to Her) &nbsp;Being able to recognize and show proper respect for HerRM was important - the last question in an authorization was 'What is the Queen's name?' &nbsp; I want to adore my Queen.

I don't want to see TRM (not referring to the current ones in particular) at an event and roll my eyes because of a dumb-ass policy change they implemented. &nbsp;This crushes my dream (heh). &nbsp;We have kingdom officers to deal with making our modern non-profit educational organization run smoothly. &nbsp;It is their job to know if a policy will get us sued, result in an inability to get decent sites for events, or discourage embezzling of local group funds. &nbsp;These are 'out of game' functions that are essential to the organization, but add little to the magic of the SCA. &nbsp;These are the people who should be praised in court by our beloved royalty. &nbsp; It doesn't crush my dream if I think the kingdom seneschal made a stupid decision because adoring her is not an integral part of my SCA experience.

Atlantia is unlikely to change policy such that royalty can't change kingdom policy. &nbsp;Crowns might want to consider, though, if They serve Atlantia better by having preferences that Their adoring masses can respect during Their reign (maybe with a small roll of the eyes), or by implementing policy changes that almost certainly will piss off half the populace. &nbsp;There seems to be a trend toward asking for feedback on proposed changes now that we have more convenient means of communication across the kingdom, but I wonder how many of the proposed changes really need to be considered at the policy/law level. &nbsp;If we do have too many court baronies or it confuses newcomers to see huge baronial coronets that dwarf our gorgeous Atlantian crowns, could TRM post a letter online explaining why there are fewer awards this reign and wait until the end of the reign to write an essay on the importance of regalia and appropriate giving of awards in the SCA?

Ten years ago, foils and epees were commonly used on the rapier field. &nbsp;There is not a single word about banning them in kingdom law or policy, but you never see them on the field today. &nbsp;There were many factors at play, and they were slowly on their way out anyway (this didn't come out of the blue), but a royal *request* that tournaments at royal progress events use heavy rapier blades seems to be the major impetus for the rapid change to more authentic blades. &nbsp;There was some grumbling from some of us who didn't own (or have authorizations for) heavy blades, but people were allowed to use epees for pick-ups and at other events, and it's much harder to hate TRM for making a request than for imposing a ban.

*also a useful analogy for the difference between the marshallate and the Academie on the rapier field.

"event","I get so frustrated sometimes when I see people post 'We must find a cure!' and things like that on FB because I know that we HAVE cures (or at least, extremely effective treatments) for many types of cancer. &nbsp;My mom and older sister were both successfully treated for early stage cancer in the past two years.&nbsp; &nbsp;Both are effectively cured. &nbsp;My favorite person in the world died of cervical cancer, which is almost always curable IF a person gets pap tests and the standard treatment while it's in an early stage. People really don't want to spout quack medicine at me because they wouldn't like my response - y'all have been warned. &nbsp;For a lot of these cancers, a legitimate cure is there if you'll take it.

Then I am reminded of the cases that aren't cured. &nbsp;My company's big boss's executive assistant (it's a small enough company that big boss knows peon me) died this morning after a 15-year fight with breast cancer. &nbsp;Fifteen years is a good run for a lot of people after a diagnosis like that, but she was still far too young. &nbsp;I didn't know her very well, so it's not so much a personal loss, but&nbsp;Juanita worked for my company for almost 20 years, so this will hit our company hard. &nbsp;Treatment gave her 15 years, but these are the cures we still need to find.

I participated in the breast cancer walk in MN on Mother's Day this year - it's one of the biggest in the country - over 55k people. &nbsp;I didn't get around to asking for pledges because I hate talking about it - my mother, her sister-my aunt, my grandmother, her sister-my great aunt, and my great grandmother (all on mom's side) all have had breast cancer. &nbsp;My sister asked me if I wanted a 'Walking in honor of/memory of' sign to pin to my number, and I just couldn't do it because I didn't know if I could make them all fit and suspected that trying would make me cry. &nbsp;That's not counting my older sister and paternal grandmother, who both had (and were cured of) &nbsp;endometrial cancer, and the aunt who died of cervical cancer.

I've been reading recent research on the effect of diet on disease, and the work on carbohydrates and heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, and CANCER is scary stuff. &nbsp;I think we don't have definitive data on the issue yet, but the preponderance of evidence I've seen so far suggests that sugars, not fats, are the real culprits. &nbsp;The misinformation that has been disseminated fills me with rage, and when I looked for a good rebuttal of the carb hypothesis (playing devil's advocate that the status quo is correct), I found drivel from one of the leaders in the field, who poo-poo'ed the author by misstating the contents of his book instead of presenting evidence that contradicted the actual contents of the book. &nbsp;This did nothing to reassure me that the people in charge of telling us how to stay healthy know what they're doing.

I've cut out all breads, rice, potatoes, and sugars (except for the natural cough drops my honey (no pun intended) accidentally bought for me yesterday). &nbsp;I feel much better - no hypoglycemia. &nbsp;We'll see what the bloodwork looks like this summer..."

"event","I was wrong.&nbsp; Like most of the planet, I&nbsp;bought it hook, line, and sinker when respected institutions like the AHA told us that saturated fats are killing us and increases in dietary fat in general are causing the obesity epidemic.&nbsp; <br /><br />They said that they had decades of research supporting their position.&nbsp; It turns out that what they actually had were decades of propaganda based on studies that didn't show what they claimed to show.&nbsp; <br /><br />I cannot express how shocked I&nbsp;was to read about how medical researchers (these are MDs) misrepresented the evidence on heart disease&nbsp; to support their theories and destroyed the careers of anyone who challenged them.&nbsp;&nbsp;They thought they were right and were saving lives, but they set aside good science and probably killed a lot of people. &nbsp;We all know people who have dropped dead from heart disease.&nbsp; Almost assuredly, they were given bad advice by doctors who trusted their authority figures to tell the truth about how well supported their theories really were or weren't.&nbsp; My blood boiled more than a few times while reading Good Calories, Bad Calories.&nbsp; You (and your windows) have been warned.<br /><br />They based their initial position on a study that looked at differences in dietary fat and heart disease among 7 countries and reported the results.&nbsp; Sounds fine as preliminary research, until you learn that they had data on TWENTY-TWO countries, but cherry-picked the ones that fit their view of the world and tossed the ones that didn't support or contradicted their hypothesis.&nbsp; No, really.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is THAT bad.<br /><br />A study that reported LDL (I remember is as 'Lousy') cholesterol to be a 'marginally significant predictor' of heart disease was cited BY&nbsp;THE&nbsp;AUTHORS a few years later as 'strong support for the hypothesis...'&nbsp; <br /><br />They found that statins lower cholesterol and also lower risk of heart disease, so they assumed that lowering cholesterol by eating less fat would have the same effect.&nbsp; <br /><br />They did get around to testing some of these notions eventually.&nbsp; The big, expensive, relatively well-designed studies found that total cholesterol doesn't predict jack - many of us know that by now.&nbsp; The only significant predictor of heart disease for women was HDL (good - I think of it as 'Happy' cholesterol).&nbsp; LDL is important for men, but it depends on what kind of LDL you have.&nbsp; Big, fluffy ones are harmless; small, dense LDL (I think of them as 'the dense little f'ers') are what clog your arteries and kill you.&nbsp; Your doctor probably hasn't analyzed the size of your LDL, and I bet most of you don't know that number (Adam didn't know his).&nbsp; Triglycerides are bad and inversely related to HDL which is good.<br /><br />Guess what <strong>lard </strong>does to your arteries?&nbsp; 47% of it is monounsaturated fat, which lowers LDL (good) and raises HDL (good).&nbsp; 90% of that monounsaturated fat is the same oleic acid you find in olive oil (good).&nbsp; Just over 40% of lard is saturated fat, but a third of that is stearic acid, which will raise HDL (good) and not change LDL (neutral).&nbsp; The rest of lard is polyunsaturated, which lowers LDL (good) and has no affect on HDL (neutral).&nbsp; So over 70% of the fat in lard improves your cholesterol (compared to eating a high-carb diet).&nbsp; The other 30% will raise LDL (bad), but raise HDL&nbsp;(good). - Tauber, p. 189&nbsp;&nbsp; Somehow this tidbit didn't make it into the food pyramid.<br /><br />Note that the government's brand-spanking-new dietary guidelines don't mention that the Atkins diet outperformed a 'balanced' diet, a low fat diet, and a very low fat diet in weight loss, as well as control of good and bad cholesterol and blood pressure (a risk factor for everything bad in the world).&nbsp; SBD rivaled Atkins for weight loss, but didn't see the same positive changes in cholestol - this broke my heart.&nbsp; It's gauche to say that an Atkins-type diet is good for you because most of us have been trained to believe in our heart of hearts that eating butter is a sin, but I'm more interested in the numbers than in the rhetoric, and the numbers say to eat the butter and ditch the bread.&nbsp; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eREuZEdMAVo (lecture from the vegetarian Stanford researcher who did the study - his numbers broke his heart too)<br /><br />Guess what increases prevalence of the dense little f'er LDLs that kill you?&nbsp; A high carbohydrate diet (remember 6-11 servings at the bottom of the pyramid?)<br /><br />Know which hormone facilitates storage of fat?&nbsp; (this isn't even the tiniest bit controversial)&nbsp; Insulin, whose level is directly related to how many carbs you eat (also not controversial - you all know diabetics...), tells your body to store fat.&nbsp; If you eat too many carbs, your insulin levels are chronically high, and things get out of whack (technical term that means f'ed up), and you store too much fat and can't burn it as fuel.&nbsp; There is more, but this is the punchline.<br /><br />Gary Taubes (a writer for Science magazine) spent a decade pulling together everything he could find on nutrition research.&nbsp; I&nbsp;would recommend his latest book (Why&nbsp;We Get Fat), except that it cuts directly to the topic of obesity, and I think that *I* wouldn't have believed his notions about obesity if I&nbsp;hadn't read about how f'ed up the 'scientific evidence' for heart disease has been for the past 50 years.<br /><br /><strong>For the layperson's version (a quick read, except for a chapter or so of light science - if I know you, you can handle this much science):</strong><br />http://www.amazon.com/Why-We-Get-Fat-About/dp/0307272702/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1302124995&amp;sr=1-1<br /><br /><strong>For people who want to read the full evidence for themselves - this is quite a tome, but you can read this if you survived Psych or Bio 101:</strong><br />http://www.amazon.com/Good-Calories-Bad-Controversial-Science/dp/1400033462/ref=pd_sim_b_1<br /><br />What I love about Taubes is that he is open to anyone proving him wrong.&nbsp; He actively tells his readers to think about whether what he is saying makes sense.&nbsp; I&nbsp;think that he would accept it graciously if someone showed him empirical evidence showing him that he is wrong, but in a decade of reading over a century's worth of research, he hasn't found that evidence.<br /><br />(all of the above numbers and info from Tauber, 2010)"

Black tulip magnolia has buds just turning pink.&nbsp; Redbuds are just starting to get pink/purple buds.&nbsp; The Palibin lilacs have purple buds.&nbsp; The Blue Skies mostly have green growth so far - seems to be doing OK in its pot.&nbsp; The Miss Kims aren't doing much, although the one in the front yard is greening up because it's in full sun right now.

The Little Lime hydrangea has lots of growth buds; the other paniculatas are a bit behind, but I think that's because they're sprouting mostly from older wood after being pruned.&nbsp; The old-fashioned and Endless Summer hydrangeas have new growth on them.&nbsp; Roses are leafing out at various rates.&nbsp; Alice oakleaf hydrangea has lots of pale green growth; the oakleafs in less sun are growing, but much more slowly.

Baptisias are just starting to sprout, as are the herbacious peonies.&nbsp; No sign of the new peony yet, but it's in a shady area that's a week or so behind the rest of the yard, and the peonies that get more sun are just starting to show buds.&nbsp; Most of the obedient plants, Siberian irises, perennial foxglove, salvia, and veronica have greened up.&nbsp; Both bleeding hearts have sprouted and have nice, leafy growth.&nbsp; The toad lilies are just sprouting - I'm hoping for no more frosts because they'll get nipped if they get too cold.&nbsp; Columbines are looking good - not sure if the new seedlings have all sprouted, but most, if not all, of last year's plants are back.&nbsp; Most of the hardy geraniums are growing again, but not sure about the Rozannes - wlll have to look again.&nbsp; The sea holly survived the winter in a small pot.

No sign of life yet from any of the weigelas, crape myrtles, balloon flowers, lilies, or hebe (and probably more).&nbsp; 

Casualties: 1 Little Rascal holly in long border, 2 tickseeds in cherry bed, and 3 siberian irises (same variety - planted late in shady area).&nbsp; Siberian irises in sunroom bed look iffy at best, but still have a tiny bit of green.&nbsp; A couple of little perennials in various places rotted away, but I don't remember what was planted in those places - probably salvias - I think we lost a few in the front yard (covered by sprawling artemisia).&nbsp; Pretty sure that two of the old roses in pots are goners, but they were looking pretty sad last fall."

"event","<strong>Diet</strong>: down 4 pounds; 4.5 to go to hit my target.&nbsp; It might take more than that to get me back into my newer suits (conference in early May), but we'll take it one goal at a time.<br /><br /><strong>Exercise</strong>:&nbsp; I've been a slacker.&nbsp; Adam and I have been walking a bit when it's not raining after work, but the lifting and cardio has flopped a bit.&nbsp; I hope to pick it back up now that things have calmed down at work and life in general.<br /><br /><strong>Garden</strong>:&nbsp;<strong> I LOVE&nbsp;LOVE&nbsp;LOVE perennials.&nbsp;</strong> Annuals make a lot of sense for people who want flowers all summer long and can't or don't want to deal with coordinating lots of different perennials to get a summer of blooms. &nbsp; Even the hardest-working perennial blooms only a month or so out of the year, and most do less than that.&nbsp; Annuals can go all summer if you keep them from going to seed.&nbsp; The drawback to annuals, of course, is that they don't return the following spring (unless they reliably self-seed, in which case they're in a different category).<br /><br />Perennials, on the other hand, generally are more expensive and more work to plant and tend, but they (should) come back year after year.&nbsp; Coordinating them in the garden so they bloom nicely together, or so that the area that is screaming yellow one month can be soft pastels a few months later, is challenging and fun for me.<br /><br /><strong>The real joy for me, though, is walking through the garden in early spring, looking for my favorite perennials, and rejoicing when I see that they made it through the winter.</strong><br /><br />Right now, the <strong>German irises' </strong>foliage is growing like crazy.&nbsp; I divided my favorite white ones, which grow only to about 18&quot;, and spread them all over the garden last fall, and I can't wait to see them all in bloom this year.&nbsp; They'll likely be small, but it's going to be fabulous in a year or so.&nbsp; The <strong>daylilies </strong>are several inches high - I swear they're growing an inch or more each day.&nbsp; The <strong>crocuses</strong>, which were not eaten by Mr. Bunny or Bambi this year, are blooming in the sunny spots and just starting to open in the shadier areas.&nbsp; The <strong>squill</strong> and <strong>muscari </strong>are just starting up.&nbsp; The early <strong>daffodils </strong>are opening in the front yard, and a few in back opened yesterday.&nbsp; MANY&nbsp;bulbs - the giant <strong>alliums </strong>(which have reproduced!), <strong>daffodils</strong>, <strong>hyacinth </strong>(not reliably perennial - Adam plants new ones for me each fall because I'm seriously allergic to the bulbs) - are sending up foliage and looking great.&nbsp; The <strong>daphne </strong>all have flower buds that are thinking about opening, and our smaller <strong>viburnums </strong>just started blooming the other day.&nbsp; The stinking <strong>hellebore </strong>is blooming, and the regular ones have nice flower buds on them, although the foliage really took a beating this past winter.<br /><br />Lots of plants are still sleeping - only a couple of my <strong>Siberian irises</strong> (out of a dozenish varieties and three times that many plants) are up yet.&nbsp; We went to Sandy's Plants, a wholesale nursery in Mechanicville that sells to the public, last year and I bought one each of the nine varieties I didn't have.&nbsp; I divided all of them into 2-4 pieces, so have about 2 dozen (tiny) Siberian iris clumps throughout the yard, plus half a dozen or so divisions of the ones that came with the house.&nbsp; Most aren't up yet, but the ones I've checked are firmly in the ground (didn't pull up when I tugged on the old foliage), so they're alive.&nbsp; Like the German irises I divided, they'll be small and probably won't flower much, if at all, this year, but they'll be incredible in a couple of years.&nbsp; Yes, you can have divisions then.&nbsp; I can't wait to see how the <strong>baptisias </strong>did over the winter, but they are still sleeping.<br /><br />That's another thing I love about perennials - you can <strong>divide </strong>many of them and make more to spread around or share with friends.&nbsp; I love pass-along plants from people I know.&nbsp; If you ever need a gift for me, a chunk of something from your yard - even if it's something I already grow - is much better than a purchased gift (although I'll never turn down a purchased plant unless it's kudzu)...<br /><br />Speaking of Satanic plants, I have lust in my heart for <a href=""http://www.whiteflowerfarm.com/68970-product.html"">this </a>standard (tree form) <strong>Chinese wisteria</strong>.&nbsp; Asian wisteria are invasive in VA, so I would need to keep it from going to seed by deadheading it, and I'd have to make sure we could deal with it if we ever have to move.&nbsp; I could put it in a ginormous pot or just be ready to nuke it with brush killer if we ever have to abandon it.&nbsp; They sell native (floribunda) wisterias that are pretty, but they're just not the same.&nbsp; It's not a horrible thug like kudzu or purple loosestrife (the latter is ILLEGAL to sell or distribute in VA), but it's capable of enough damage that I couldn't plant one without having a plan to keep it (its seeds, actually) from getting loose.&nbsp; If I buy one, I'm going to have to get someone to promise to nuke it if A &amp; I are killed by a meteorite or something. . ."

I haven't been doing any serious working out lately, but we've gone walking in the neighborhood, Jefferson Trails (near Monticello), or Ivy Creek Natural Area most days this past week.&nbsp; It was 20+ degrees colder today than it was yesterday, but with a heavier coat it was just as lovely.

I have a diet goal, but my primary objective is to start eating healthier meals so that I stop gaining weight.&nbsp; I don't do very well with real dinners with a lot of carbs.&nbsp; Even though we banished refined carbs (white breads, regular pasta, potatoes for the most part) ages ago (other than banana bread a couple of times), the whole grains are a problem for me if I eat them beyond moderation.&nbsp; I loves me some rice, pasta, sandwiches, etc.&nbsp; I&nbsp; just need to eat them in smaller portions so they don't muck with my blood sugar.&nbsp; I feel much better on the SB&nbsp;diet than I do eating a lot of carbs.

Class for university (THIS&nbsp;SATURDAY!!!) is coming along.&nbsp; I've been working on it for several months, but am finishing up today and tomorrow.&nbsp; I have my notes pretty much done, and the handout (sans pictures) just needs a bit of editing.&nbsp; I think that integrating the pictures into the text would be nice, but given my lack of layout skills, would not be worth the effort at this point, so the pictures will be on a separate page(s).&nbsp; I need to run through my notes a couple of times to make sure the length is OK, and am hoping to have time at the end for questions and discussion.

My third (and last!) big project at work finished up today.&nbsp; The other two were due last Thursday and last Friday.&nbsp; Yes, the past few weeks have been a bit crazy, but I started working on these projects (writing the reports, making the graphs, etc.) when I had some down time in December - before I'd even started analyzing (or in the case of the survey, before collecting) the data.&nbsp; It's good that I made good use of that time - it made the past month much more pleasant for me.

Two work trips coming up this and next month, then a conference in May.&nbsp; I hate business travel, even though there are occasionally fun bits.

Visiting the family in MN&nbsp;in May, then Adam's family in the San Juan Islands (Lopez Island, to be exact) in July.&nbsp; Busy.

Garden is starting to wake up.&nbsp; The crocuses are blooming, and the squill are just starting.&nbsp; The early daffodils have buds forming.&nbsp; Our tree peonies (finally) have flower buds this year.&nbsp; After a hard year last year, they're looking much better and should have some gorgeous flowers.&nbsp; Many of the perennials and shrubs are still sleeping, and the herbacious peonies haven't sent out new buds yet.&nbsp; Given that we had a mild winter, I suspect that everything will come back and do well this spring - I can't wait!"

Thursday: got in late, hung out on balcony in beautiful Animal Kingdom Lodge (Kidani Village) - gorgeous weather.

Friday: Hollywood Studios - not my favorite park, but we went on several new-to-us attractions - backlot tour was good, toystory mania ride was uber-cool, American Idol Experience was better than expected.

Saturday: Animal Kingdom with 10 year old niece and Adam - It was a cold day, so numerous animals (including the monkeys!!!) weren't out where we could see them, but it was a good time.&nbsp; My niece is a serious whiny butt when she's around my sister, but she didn't whine once all day when she was with us - crazy how kids are so different when their parents aren't around.&nbsp; As usual, the safari ride was awesome.&nbsp; The African and Asian walks through the animal habitats were cool - we saw a baby gorilla crawl around.&nbsp; Sadly, the bats, monkeys, and komodo dragons weren't out because of the cold weather.

Sunday: Adam was pretty sick that morning, so he took a shuttle to a CentraCare clinic to get antibiotics.&nbsp; We met the family at Magic Kingdom that afternoon after Adam and I walked around for a couple of hours.&nbsp; Ate pastries and ice cream, and bought a cool glass vase that was made at the glass shop on Main Street.&nbsp; Went on Pirates of the Caribbean - not high excitement, but it amused the kids.&nbsp; Dinner was at Ohana at the Polynesian Resort.&nbsp; It's a meat-lovers fantasy come true, but the noodles, shrimp, and dessert were fabulous for us.&nbsp; After dinner, we froze our butts watching the MK fireworks from the beach at the Polynesian.

Monday: Adam and I took everyone other than my sister and brother-in-law to SeaWorld to give them a break from the kids.&nbsp; We saw all three shows (dolphins were best, although the baby orca was unbearably cute).&nbsp; We went through the shark aquarium and fed sharks, then went through the penguin area.&nbsp; My niece correctly answered a question during the animal handlers' educational presentation, and the reward was getting to meet (and pet!!!) a king penguin named Fisher.&nbsp; We even got to go into the side area of the huge cooler where the penguins live, and the kids were able to pet a baby penguin.&nbsp; Petting the penguin was the highlight of the day.&nbsp; I wasn't overly impressed with the park overall, but the animal handlers were all fabulous.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think I would have thought more of the park if I wasn't comparing it to WDW - the non-handler staff were fine, but not like WDW 'cast members', and the park itself was nice, but not Disney nice.&nbsp; WDW's landscaping generally is perfect - I was shocked to see a topiary (one, out of all I saw in the MK)&nbsp;that needed trimming.&nbsp; Dinner was with Adam at Boma at Jamba House (the other Animal Kingdom Lodge hotel), which is within easy walking distance of Kidani Village.&nbsp; OMG - I ate so much.&nbsp; It's a buffet, and it's wonderful. *burp*

Tuesday: Epcot with 7 year old niece - we did 1.5 of the countries for the Kim Possible alternate reality game.&nbsp; Norway has REAL Viking swords and a 1:20 scale model of the Oseberg (I think) ship.&nbsp; Niece drove me a bit batty with constant questions, but she's a pretty cool kid - complete opposite of her older sister, who is a rule keeper and much more reserved.&nbsp; We left Epcot a bit early because there were storm warnings in effect and the sky was looking ominous - I didn't want to get stuck at the park with a 7 year old in a serious (and large) thunderstorm.&nbsp; We made it home before the storm hit and had a tornado warning that night - has happened two of the three times I've been to WDW.&nbsp; Bread/dips and desserts at Sanaa were fabulous - entrees were disappointing.

Wednesday: I was very sad to leave, but we were happy that the weather only delayed our flight home by an hour.&nbsp; Flights farther north were canceled that night.&nbsp; It took us over two hours to drive about 75 miles on the interstate in the snow to get home, but it wasn't as bad as I feared.&nbsp; We had to do 45 mph for 30 miles or so, but we got home.

We stayed at the Animal Kingdom Lodge's Kidani Village, which only has villas that have kitchens or kitchenettes (no regular hotel rooms, although the studios are similar to a hotel room).&nbsp; My sister is a member of the Disney Vacation Club (Disney's timeshare program), and she was able to upgrade from a one bedroom to a two bedroom villa for an extra $90 a night by renting points from other members.&nbsp; The villas at Kidani Village are gorgeous - theming is very cool, and the building is surrounded by savannahs full of zebras, various antelope-like critters, birds (ostriches!), and giraffes.&nbsp; We had four giraffes on the savannah closest to us - they were SO cool, and they came within about 30 feet of the observation platform outside the hotel.&nbsp; They feed them by putting their food in baskets high in numerous trees (for giraffes) or on rocks or the ground (for other animals) where the guests will be able to get a good view of them, so we saw a lot of most of the critters.&nbsp; I was happy to see that all of the animals seemed happy - no nervous, pacing behavior that I've seen in other settings - even nice places like Maymont (they have the most neurotic bears I've ever seen).&nbsp; They're clearly used to having people around them all the time - they didn't seem to notice us much at all.&nbsp; I could watch the giraffes for hours.&nbsp; We got to see the two young ones take off running when it started pouring in the late afternoon - very cool to see giraffes run.

I suspect that my sister will want to try all of the other villas before going back to Kidani Village - I doubt any of the other themes (beach club, old key west, boardwalk, wilderness lodge, etc.) will be as cool (no giraffes. . .), but for $90 a night for Disney's 'deluxe' accomodations (not very deluxe by non-Disney standards, but nice and much cooler than most modern hotels), I can't complain too much - rack rates for this time of year for a studio start at $345, and we also had access to the living room and kitchen in my sister's attached one bedroom villa.&nbsp;&nbsp; We can come back to the lodge to eat at Boma and arrive early enough to watch the late afternoon feeding of the critters on the savannah before dinner.

Overall, a great trip.&nbsp; I miss WDW.&nbsp; More thoughts on Disney later."

"event","I rode the exercise bike and lifted weights last night.&nbsp; While I'm not really sore (stretching properly afterward prevents that), my whole body is TIRED.&nbsp; I've been running around the house most of the morning cleaning out closets, doing laundry, etc., and right now I just want to sit.

I'm getting a lot stronger.&nbsp; I'm using dumbbells and wrist/ankle weights and riding an ancient exercise bike that we have in our TV room. I ride the bike, then lift weights while watching an episode of Heroes (season 3, which is so-so compared to the first season).&nbsp; My goal is to continue to increase the amount of time I can ride the bike (I really don't push myself on it yet) and increase weight and/or reps with the weights.&nbsp; Doing one more rep or using a heavier weight than last time is progress.

I had wanted to lose about 10 pounds, but have decided to shift my goals.&nbsp; My BMI is 21.8 and I wear a size 6.&nbsp; In no reasonable universe do I need to lose weight.&nbsp; I might be happier with my body if it were a size 2 again (not unrealistic for me - some people are big-boned; I'm little-boned), but it's not worth it right now.&nbsp; I am getting more physical activity and trying to eat healthy foods.&nbsp; Adam and I are starting to cook (real cooking - not just dumping Classico into a pot) regularly, and I'm trying to cut out as much processed food from my diet as i can.&nbsp; If exercise and healthy food result in fitting into my size 2 jeans, fine; if not, so be it.&nbsp; My clothes will fit and look better if I'm buff regardless of my size.

This cooking thing is quite novel.&nbsp; I knew how to cook in high school (not well, but I could feed myself), but got out of the habit in college while living in the dorms, then lived with Adam, who is a very picky eater and hated a lot of things I liked to cook (anything with vinegar, mustard, onions, etc.), so I quit cooking.&nbsp; I decided recently that I wanted to start eating more real food, and I told Adam that I was going to try to make things he'd like, but that he could fend for himself if he didn't like it.&nbsp; 

Our diet really wasn't all that bad.&nbsp; We don't keep sweets in the house most of the time, and we don't eat a lot of heavily processed foods, but we weren't doing a lot of real cooking beyond things like scrambled eggs and salmon.&nbsp; I bought Adam a wok and a new cookbook for xmas/birthday, and he bought me a new set of cookware.&nbsp; I splurged on a reasonably nice set of knives, some better mixing bowls, and a few odds and ends that I didn't have.&nbsp; We dug the stand mixer and food processor out of the closet.&nbsp; We're learning to start thinking about dinner before we are hungry, and we're planning ahead before shopping and keeping an eye on what's in the fridge so that we know what we're eating the rest of this week (obvious to you cooks, but not non-cooks do).

Have been lazy long enough - need to go make lunch so that I don't end up eating banana bread again. . ."

Americans have an interesting definition of 'rich'.&nbsp; Everyone in the US is either 'middle class' (whether you make $25k or $250k) or a tycoon.&nbsp; People don't think of themselves as 'rich' unless they have a yacht or private plane.

How can a couple make 6 times the average US&nbsp;household income and not consider themselves to be rich?&nbsp; It's true that even in low cost areas of the US, $250k/year isn't going to pay for a Paris Hilton lifestyle.&nbsp; All of the trappings of being an 'upper middle class' American - work clothes, day care, saving for college and retirement, student loans, etc. -&nbsp; will eat that $250k pretty quickly.&nbsp; These people are not leading lives of luxury and leisure.&nbsp; That said, the fact that a couple can afford these things says a lot.&nbsp; Sure, it's important to save for retirement, so people in that tax bracket think that they 'must' save $16.5k/yr in their 401ks.&nbsp; That's more than someone making minimum wage MAKES in a year.&nbsp; To help with defining 'necessity' - there is a big difference between not being able to max out your 401k this year and not being able to pay your mortgage payment this month.&nbsp; Quite a few truly optional expenses become 'necessities' - things like a bigger house in a better school district or a more reliable car - it might be a perfectly reasonable purchase that they can afford, but it's not a necessity.&nbsp; They are *choosing* to spend more money on these things, and as a result, they don't feel like they have a lot of money left over at the end of the month.&nbsp; They're not tycoons, but six times the national average income is rich by any reasonable definition.

On a related note:
The guy who wrote The Millionaire Next Door points out in his newer book that the biggest factor in how much you spend is where you live.&nbsp; If you choose to live in a fancy neighborhood where all of your neighbors drive BMWs and hire help to take care of the expensive houses, you probably will spend more on *everything* (to keep up with the Joneses) than if you'd chosen to live in a more average neighborhood where people drive Hondas and cut their own grass.

It's a decent book.

My grandmother always used to remind us of the anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor.&nbsp; Like most grandchildren, I rolled my eyes behind Grandma's back and really didn't understand until September 11th how a date and event could be seared in your memory like that.&nbsp; Like Pearl Harbor, it wasn't just the single, horrible event - something that was over and done and cleaned up relatively soon.&nbsp; It was the years of fallout from the event - in our case, two wars over nine years, and no real end in sight.&nbsp; We've always been at war with Eastasia.&nbsp; The thing that breaks my heart is that 17-year-olds today probably can't remember a time when we weren't at war.&nbsp;&nbsp;"

"event","It's finally cool enough to work in the garden again.&nbsp;&nbsp; We (by which I mean Adam) sprayed the 'lawn' (weeds) and tilled and amended the new bed a few weeks ago.&nbsp; We planted most of the shrubs last Wednesday morning - before it started raining for several days.&nbsp; We planted the perennials yesterday.&nbsp; I overused my wrists digging in the soil, dividing perennials, and loosening root balls (ouch), but it's all muscle pain and not carpal tunnel or ulnar nerve problems.

I'm done shopping at Great Big Greenhouse in Richmond.&nbsp; It used to be one of my favorite nurseries - they often had great shrubs, and their perennials usually were almost as nice and a bit less expensive than Strange's.&nbsp; Sadly, the owners sold to a regional chain this past summer, and the place has really changed.&nbsp; They now have a person at the door to check your receipt as you leave the store (like Walmart-type stores), and the selection stinks.&nbsp; They had large numbers of generic plants.&nbsp; You could create a beautiful garden with those plants, but if you're looking for a particular cultivar, you're probably SOL.&nbsp; We were lucky and found 9 of the dwarf weigela we needed, and we picked up some perennials. &nbsp;ALL of the weigelas' rootballs had massive damage - the plants looked healthy above the soil, but it looks like someone failed to water them sufficiently such that the roots died back, then watered them enough to nurse them back to health.&nbsp; 

In happier gardening news, we finally got around to visiting Sandy's Plants in Mechanicsville.&nbsp; They grow many of the perennials sold in Richmond's local garden stores.&nbsp; This isn't the type of nursery you want to visit if you are just starting out with gardening or need any help with your selections - it's a working farm - they have people working there, but they're not salespeople who have time to help you choose a coneflower.&nbsp; It's a massive farm with a zillion aisles of potted perennials - they have dozens of each variety and hundreds of the really popular ones.&nbsp; They have golf carts for customers to use to get around the place - it's that big.&nbsp; If you know what you're looking for, you can look up the plants in their directory and drive the cart to the plants you need.&nbsp; If you don't know what you need, it's going to be a LONG day - aisles are numbered, but plants aren't labeled as they are at garden centers - by this time of year, the plant signs are so faded that you need to get off the cart to read them, and they move things around - they might have coneflowers in three different aisles.&nbsp; You really need to have an idea of what you want before you go - at least the species, if not the particular cultivars - unless you like wandering around a lot.&nbsp; They had DOZENS&nbsp;of cultivars of plants like echinacea - practically every color you can imagine.&nbsp; They have volume discounts, and everything was 20% off this time of year, so prices were comparable to what you'd pay in local stores - probably a buck or two cheaper than at Stranges for some things.

I got one of every type of siberian iris they sold (now I need to find places for the last four...) and two types of low-growing hardy geraniums, along with a bunch of other stuff.&nbsp; I divided each of the geraniums and irises into 3-4 pieces for the new bed and to scatter around the rest of the yard.&nbsp; I'm a plant collector at heart, but I like to use some semblance of design in putting together our garden beds, so I split a perennial into pieces, then put all of the pieces within sight of the others because our eyes like to look for repetition - I have pink irises in front, blue by the chimney, purple around the lawn, a different blue near the fence, etc.&nbsp; After seeing how fast everything grew over this past summer (which was TERRIBLE for gardening), I was confident that even the small pieces would be fabulous by spring.&nbsp;

The key is dividing new perennials to pick the plant with the healthiest (usually biggest) crown - you don't want tall, you want wide.&nbsp; We were able to find irises with multiple fans that are good for dividing - siberian irises can be pulled apart with your bare hands.&nbsp; I do it without gloves so that I can untangle the roots without damaging them.&nbsp; German iris rhizomes can be broken apart as long as each section has roots and a fan.&nbsp; The low growing geraniums often have multiple rosettes in the crown - each can become a new plant - G. macrorhizum is stupid easy to divide - the stems will grow roots if you plant them.&nbsp; Daylilies and hostas are beyond easy to divide, but require a bit more strength (or a couple of garden forks) if they're rootbound or large.&nbsp; &nbsp;You can get great deals on perennials at the end of the season - I've bought pots of roots with no plant above the soil line.&nbsp; You need to slide it out to check out the roots if you do this, but I've gotten great deals on hostas, daylilies, toad lilies, etc.&nbsp; If it has lots of white roots that aren't completely rootbound&nbsp; - you're golden."

"event","Metalsmiths' Symposium was a lot of fun.&nbsp; We saw many people we like very much, and I met several very cool new-to-me people.&nbsp; Classes were great.&nbsp; 

After Chris's fabulous pewter casting class and with his very thorough handout, I think we can order a couple of things and start casting.&nbsp; Adam even tried pouring a mold after the class so that we'd be confident that we could do it without supervision.&nbsp; I've very excited about the possibility of having custom buttons and such.&nbsp; Adam's not likely to be keen on mass producing anything, but I am sure that he'd be happy to have friends over to cast a batch with his molds.

The sand casting class was good.&nbsp; I did some brass/bronze/silver casting in a jewelry making class I took in college, so some of it was review for me.&nbsp; The college class used lost wax instead of sand casting, though, and I've only done actual sand casting once at J&amp;L's house a zillion years ago.&nbsp; I think that we're going to start with pewter casting and decide whether we want to work up to brass casting. If we decide we want to do it, I will get a tip-n-pour furnace - I'm not keen on the type where you have to manipulate the 2000F+ removable crucible with a pair of tongs.&nbsp; 

I went to the open-torch lampworking station after lunch and got in a bit of torch time.&nbsp; I've made a few beads at a University class about 5 years ago, but never did anything with it after that.&nbsp; It was much easier this time.&nbsp; Our teacher insisted that we all make three beads because you need to make that many to get the hang of it.&nbsp; I'm planning to order a starter kit in the near future, but I think I want to figure out where I'm going to set it up first.&nbsp; I'm hoping that I can clean out the shed well enough that most of our gardening stuff can live there, and half of the garage (currently dumping ground for gardening cr@p) can be a workshop.&nbsp; If we can build/buy a long table to run along the left wall and cover it with a heat resistant surface, we'd be able to do casting and lampworking there.

I missed the herald's call for my spinning class, and when I went looking for it 15 minutes late, I couldn't find it&nbsp; - not sure if it moved or was canceled, but it wasn't where it said it was going to be.&nbsp; :(&nbsp;&nbsp; At that point, I was pretty tired, so I found Adam and headed home.&nbsp; Spinning and enameling will have to wait for another day.

Since we're supposed to get rain and storms most of tonight, I'm hoping to work on a few projects - I want to start a new Viking apron dress and finish the red Bocksten tunic I started before Pennsic.&nbsp; The tunic is later period than Viking era, but the correct underdress (they've found very few garments from this era, so take with big boulder o'salt) is actually more sophisticated than the tunic, and I'm pretty confident that they wore geometrically patterned (cutting pattern made up of geometric shapes) dresses as well as the ones with the set-in sleeves.&nbsp; Also need to warp my cards for a new tablet weaving - I'm getting better at it and won't make the same mistakes I made in the last one.

Need to go shower so that we can hit Lowes before the storms roll in. . ."

The MR has an archive online, so you don't need to be subscribed to check for last minute announcements the night before an event.&nbsp; If something truly noteworthy happens, you'll hear about it here or on FB and can go watch the train wreck on the archive if you like.&nbsp; If you MUST&nbsp;respond, write your response in Word, tell yourself I&nbsp;TOLD&nbsp;THEM!, then close the file without saving (or sending) it.&nbsp; I gossip *with my friends* on FB and LJ because I know who I can trust to be sensible and have an intelligent disagreement online, but I use group lists only to determine who is bringing the coleslaw.&nbsp; If anyone brings up something more controversial than whether the potato salad should contain mustard, I laugh a lot while hitting delete and saying DELETED in my best StrongBad voice.<br /><br /><strong>Pop-up ads</strong> - when in doubt, close them with the task manager rather than by clicking on them.&nbsp; If you are told you need to do something with your anti-virus software, close everything (with task manager if it looks remotely sketchy), then open your virus protection software and deal with it there.&nbsp; Don't set up your main Windows profile with Admin privileges - you will have time to THINK about it before downloading something if you have to switch profiles to install something.&nbsp; Same with credit card calls and emails - hang up and call the number on the back of your card.<br /><br /><strong>Depression </strong>- while I don't agree with Tom Cruise's assessment of depression treatments (I believe in better living through chemistry), I think that many of us often can make ourselves feel better by getting off our butts and doing something active - doesn't matter what, but many hours on the computer/TV/video games don't count.&nbsp; This does not apply, of course, if we're talking suicidal or can't-get-out-of-bed depression.<br /><br /><strong>True Blood</strong> - first season was good, second season was great (you'll never think of VIkings the same way again...), third season was gratuitous everything - way too much gore for my taste, which is a funny thing to say about a show about vampires.&nbsp; All will be forgiven if they give Alcide a more prominent role - they spared L from death, so they should be able to write some good bits for Alcide.&nbsp; Oh, and the show is in no way appropriate for children - I'm more liberal than average, but I wouldn't watch it anywhere there was a remote chance a child might catch a glimpse of the wrong scene.<br /><br /><strong>Vikings rock!</strong> (self explanatory)"

"event","The new burgundy weigelas (smaller than the old-fashioned kind, with dark rose pink flowers and burgundy foliage) are a cheap way to spiff up the garden.&nbsp; Wine and Roses (~4'x4' - possibly bigger in the south) is awesome and available for reasonable prices at Lowes.&nbsp; Midnight Wine (a harder-to-find dwarf) is great for small spaces.

Clethra is awesome.&nbsp; Hummingbirds are great mid-sized shrubs that smell wonderful when they're in bloom.&nbsp; Sixteen Candles is a Hummingbird seedling that has upright (rather than drooping) panicles.&nbsp; Both are very good.&nbsp; Ruby Spice is an upright cultivar with pretty rose pink flowers.

Abelia rocks.&nbsp; I like Rose Creeks, and we just bought some Silver Anniversary abelia that look cool - I hope they do well.&nbsp; The Mardi Gras didn't do well with the snow this past winter and had a hard recovery.&nbsp; I don't like how they grew back - variegation is much more yellow than when we bought them.&nbsp; They might need a new home.&nbsp; We have some of the taller stuff too (came with the house), but I don't know their exact names.

Ninebark is fabulous for larger spaces - gorgeous dark foliage.&nbsp; We like Seward/Summer Wine, but Diablo is nice too.

My hydrangeas have had a rough summer.&nbsp; Some of them are planted in too much sun, and even the ones in the shade are drying out far too much.&nbsp; They do NOT&nbsp;like afternoon sun.&nbsp; I'm hoping next year is cooler and wetter.&nbsp; Our paniculatas are doing well, except for the standard that died to the ground and is resprouting from the roots - no idea what killed it - probably a combination of weak root system and drought.&nbsp; The oakleaf hydrangeas are doing well.&nbsp; They really like shade.&nbsp; Our Alice supposedly can take full sun, but although she's doing OK, she looks notably less happy than the others that are in the shade.&nbsp; I think she'd be doing better if it were morning sun, but it's the nasty southwest-side-of-a-wall-of-trees sun.&nbsp; If a tag says 'morning sun only', they probably mean it.

The roses have been real troopers this year.&nbsp; I cut them back hard after Mr. Bunny nibbled on most of their branches during the winter.&nbsp; I didn't spray at all this year, so the blackspot defoliated them and the Japanese Beetles ate them in the middle of the summer, but they've recovered nicely from both.&nbsp; I planted hardy geraniums (a white-flowered cultivar that rambles two feet or so into other shrubs if they're nearby) at their feet last week.&nbsp; I hope that this will make them look better when the black spot and beetles hit next summer.&nbsp; Several of them are blooming again, so apparently they liked their fertilizer. . .

May Night Salvia (or Snow Hill if you prefer white flowers) and Veronica spicata (Red Fox did well for us if you want rose pink (no, they're not really red)) repeat bloom on and off through the summer if you deadhead them.&nbsp; Becky shasta daisies are built like rocks and will rebloom, and Magnus and/or Kim's Knee-High coneflowers are very good - and the birds love the seed heads.&nbsp; The new coneflowers in exciting new colors are SO tempting, but from several sources and personal experience, I know that they do not come back reliably the next spring. &nbsp;Let me know if you have had better luck with them, but one gardening author said that she heard rumor of *one* surviving a winter in this area.&nbsp; If they weren't so expensive, I'd plant them as annuals - Twilight makes me swoon (cultivar, not the book/movie)

Bluestone Perennials sells TINY, but exceptionally healthy perennials.&nbsp; If you water them properly, their growth during the first summer will amaze you.&nbsp; I can't believe the current size of the teensy tiny pieces of Siberian Iris I planted this past summer, and the obedient plants are huge.&nbsp; I wouldn't order any common varieties from them because you can get big potted plants of the same type for the same price locally, but I was very pleased with the less commonly found plants I ordered this past spring.&nbsp; Why is Caesar's Brother the only Siberian Iris most stores carry?&nbsp; These are the easiest plants on the planet. . .

Much of this stuff is native to North America, but even the stuff that's not gives the local bees and birds plenty of nectar and pollen, and none of it is invasive or seriously thuggish."

"event","So I'm working on a Viking Women's Clothes 101 class, but am thinking of adding &quot;:CSI&quot; to the title.&nbsp; There was some incredible sleuthing that these researchers did in putting together a Viking woman's outfit out of tiny bits of thousand year old fabric, the metal bits in the graves, and the notes from the archaeologists in 1873 who dug everything up, but were mostly interested in boats and the shiny bits.&nbsp; One note refers to a pair of brooches 'one cleaned' - clearly they didn't think there was any value in the gunk surrounding the pretty metal object- they scraped the layers off and washed away the residue to get at the shiny bit.

Sadly, gaudy tablet-woven trim brocaded with metal threads was stylin' back then.&nbsp; I like the gaudy bling, but gaudy trim is, well, gaudy trim.&nbsp; I'm going to chart out the really easy and not-too-tacky bit of one of the tablet weaving patterns in the Hagg chapter.&nbsp; I can do that with just string, and I can do it with a threaded-in pattern (I think).&nbsp; I'm not up to turning cards individually yet.&nbsp; There are people with videos on YouTube who do some amazing card weaving, but I need to get my general technique to a respectable level (even tension and such) before trying anything fancy.

I'm finding that I can't do this 6 days each week.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't do the workout AND do any serious work in the garden in one day - there's not enough time, and my muscles vote no.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not giving up the garden, so Tony will just have to be a little bit flexible.&nbsp; Given that my muscles are seriously sore the day after a day in the garden if I don't stretch well that night, I'm not too worried about it.&nbsp; I think that doing the workout every day that I don't have another physical activity planned is a reasonable compromise.

Diet is pretty easy so far.&nbsp; Blew it with cheesecake on Sunday, but I planned ahead and didn't eat an entree, so it wasn't a complete loss.&nbsp; I'm a grown-up and can each cheesecake for dinner if I like.&nbsp; I also snarfed a ton of fruit and veggies that night.&nbsp; Yum.&nbsp; 

I've found that if you bring a fruit and/or veggie tray to a social gathering and put it where people can reach it easily, a good number of them will nibble on it - much better for us than a bowl of M&amp;Ms.&nbsp; When I buy them for at home (yes, I'm lazy about food preparation), I toss the ranch dressing that comes with the veggie tray without opening it, but even with the dressing, it's better than snarfing a bowl of chips or cookies.

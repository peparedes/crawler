"event","<p><font size=""1"">Goddamnit! Frightland is now closed to all volunteers. Along with the majority of the Frightland staff, I just lost my job. Because I'm too young to be a volunteer. Now it's only paid workers, 16 and above. And anyone between 16 and 18 have to get out of the attractions by 11.<br /><br />It's just not fair. Thursday night was spent bawling because I couldn't work anymore. I know that sounds pathetic, but Frightland's like my second family, I've got friends and human pillows and hubbies there! D: That I only get to see during Frightland.<br /><br />And now, poof. Gone till I'm 16. Possibly they might bump up the age to 18 too. I don't even fucking know where the hell I'll be at age 18.&nbsp;<br /><br />I'm pissed off, moody, and able to cry at any mention of Frightland. It's just not fair.<br /><br /><em>And does anyone notice<br />And does anyone care<br />If I had the guts<br />To put this to your head<br />But would anything matter<br />If you're already dead?<br /><br /></em>*Kassi*<br /><br />PS. A volunteer put up a petition to sign. I'm posting it everywhere, MySpace, AIM, the works. If you see this, would you please sign?&nbsp; <a href=""http://www.thepetitionsite.com/1/let-volunteers-work-at-frightland"">http://www.thepetitionsite.com/1/let-volunteers-work-at-frightland</a></font></p>"

"event","<font size=""1"">&nbsp;I know it's going to take a while to build up on what I had before. Like, all the friends and stuff. I wish it didn't have to, but it's going to and that's kind of annoying.<br /><br />But, in the meantime, I'll post a little journal cause I'm bored and nothing's going on.&nbsp;<br /><br />My dad's off doing something somewhere, I've begun to forget where he's going, who he's going with, why he's going there, etc. He got this new job and he's always traveling so I only see him every now and then, which is really weird. What's even weirder is when he comes back after being away for a while, it's almost like I don't know him anymore. That's ridiculous, seeing as he's my dad, but I just feel that way sometimes.<br /><br />Thank god he's giving up that beer.<br /><br />Methinks this is going to be an actual journal, like blog journal, instead of a writing journal. I might post some writings but it won't turn into a complete writing journal. For some reason, I have a feeling this will come in handy when I start school. Maybe because with I'm always having some sort of drama going on. Last year, it was Noah and Kristina, with little things on the side. This year it'll probably involve Noah too. -_-&nbsp;I just wish he gets a clue. And soon.<br /><br />My mom and I borrowed the first disc of the first season of House! :D See, I love House. (in real life I jokingly call him my husband, but I'll refrain from doing so here seeing as this is a journal, therefore nobody can hear my joking tone and I will be called a teeny) So this makes me very happy, almost as happy as knowing a new season will be starting soon!! *dances*&nbsp;<br /><br />Well this is getting long and there's nothing else really to blog about so...I bid you adiue, journal. (is that how I spell that? =/)<br /><br />Going Insane,<br />Kassi.</font>"

"event","<font size=""1"">Hi guys. I'm back, because the site I dumped LJ for turned out to be bad for me. Like, I was getting ignored, and no one was reading my writing, you know, shit like that. =/ So, I decided I probably shouldn't have been so harsh to my LJ and came back, and now I'm nurturing it back to health. And yes, I do plan to stay. ^_^<br /><br />I might make this journal Friends Only, we'll see. For now, I think I'll let it be free and open. It hasn't been used in a while.&nbsp;<br /><br />Sane for the moment,<br />Kassi.</font>"

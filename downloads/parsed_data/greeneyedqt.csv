just to add on to my bad week i just found out that my X boyfriend cody still likes me,and that he wants a second ( actually its a third chance, yes im counting). a little late dont you think? i hung out with him yesturday with courtney ali and some other guy jole. and then we went back to courtneys later that night, it was fun but other than that cody just layed there and didnt talk to me. he said he was confused on why i wasnt with him. but what do you expect when you dont talk or see me in almost 2 months and all the sudden you want that person back and you expect them to go right back to you, uhh no. i would like to be friends with him still and talk to him, and maybe regain what was lost. what do you guys think i should do about this? ignore him or start over again and get to know him better?? i dunno.

i have a lot going on right now, and im so stressed out, GRRRRRR. well im gonna go get ready for the baseball game!!! whoo hooo cant wait! ( NOT )

<P><FONT color=#ffccff>i guess you could say that i messed up BIG TIME. last night. wasnt to pretty. ill shorten the story cuz its a long one. Let me just say that i have almost lost all my moms trust in me. it sucks. yes sure i hate it when i hurt people period, but when i hurt my MOM and i see her cry and me knowing that the reason shes crying is because of me and me lying to her, it kills me. my mom says that im not allowed to see the guy i like or talk to him and that im grounded for a month, but then she comes&nbsp;to me&nbsp;like 5 min later and says that she doesnt care who i hang out with or who i talk to and leaves again, so idk what exactly my punishment is right now. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffccff>its going to take some time to gain all that was lost from me and my moms relationship but eventually it will work out, i hope!! i guess this is what i get for for lying to my mom and telling her that im somewhere that im not and then she finds out that im hanging out with someone she doesnt want me to hang out with, ouch.&nbsp; i just hope she understands that NO ONE is perfect including me lol. everyone messes up and they make mistakes and in time those mistakes are forgiven, its all the same. this is my first time me and my mom have ever faught, and i hope that its the last. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ffccff>ill get through this, i have great friends who will help me ( hopefully ) lol. All i need is time and good advice. im just glad im not grounded from the computer. or else id surly die of bordom. </FONT></P>

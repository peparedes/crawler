keeping from their many stares
the now silent automobile hum

Curl up, shriek, then slowly die
Love is gone I'm feeling cold
Shivering, mad lonely, so old
Love for me, will not return
My hearts desire will never burn
Misty visions cloud my eyes
Rivers of sorrow, torrential lies
At the dance of life, I'll only sit
My heart is broken, I'm sad as shit
It will burn forever; my lover's scorn
Today, tonight, tomorrow morn
Somehow again, I'll walk in the sun
But my time as two, is finally done"

"event","Life sings in my wooden fingers.
I will drop what I have never held, 
The fruits of my desire -- success
And reap loss and despair in the shadows.

Even my grasping hands will never grasp
The Horn of Plenty, instead
I hold much more, without a grip,
Universal Truth and Stark Awareness.

What ego grasps and tightly holds
is quickly lost to time.
But an open heart hears the truth,
of love and pain and war

So I guess that ego's not triumphant,
Perhaps I'll leave it here -
Along with anger, things I have hated,
And all my doubt and fear."

Yes, I feel your gaze with jaundiced eye
My myriad shades of beauty
Penetrate your mind
While scrutinized I fall and
Cry as a child
For I know you'll never have my heart
Believe in receiving my own identity
I fall
Into some kaleidoscope of heaven
Angel eyes refine me
Still with clenched fists
I wither away the inner spear cutting me
I've pushed it away for as long 
As my own eye refined mind can takes me
With a choice I could hold an angel
Or be held
In a world of easy, difficult, and meaningless decisions
In this world I could break down my own heart
And conceive myself
But with this pain I'd rather turn away
Though they call it life..
..I remain to suffer this phoney pain
Some say when someone does a selfish act
After a while the act gets meaningless
I finally believe whoever they are"

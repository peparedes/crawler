Then, when I was about half way over the line, moved back into the right lane -- I'm not sure why! And once I was back in my lane, the car that had been in my blind spot moved past me. Weird that he did not honk or anything; I'm glad I stopped merging before I collided with him though."

""MY CORPSE and I"" by Nicanor Parra (tr. Liz Werner)

MY CORPSE and I
understand each other marvelously
my corpse asks me: do you believe in God?
and I respond with a hearty NO
my corpse asks: do you believe in the government?
and I respond with the hammer and sickle
my corpse asks: do you believe in the police?
and I respond with a punch in the face
then he gets up out of his coffin
and we go arm in arm to the altar"

"event","From <a href=""http://ludditerobot.livejournal.com"">The Luddite Robot</a>:

<em> I know very little about some of the people on my friends list. Some people I know relatively well. I read your journals, or we have something else in common, and we chat occasionally. Some of you I hardly know at all. Perhaps you lurk, for whatever reason. But you friended me, and I thank you for your interest in my words.

But here's a thought: why not take this opportunity to tell me a little something about yourself. Any old thing at all. Just so the next time I see your name I can say: ""Ah, there's so and so...they enjoy the savory aroma of monkey brains a la mode.""

I'd love it if every single person who friended me would do this. Yes, even you people who I know really well. Then post this in your own journal and see what gems of knowledge appear.</em>"

Over the next month and a half, the bowl was repeatedly refilled, and the chocolates were eaten quickly each time. Since mid-November there has been a big bowl full of Tootsie Rolls and Bit-o-Honeys in the breakroom."

Make up my alabaster soul -- and
Sigh, I've heard it all before, and
Drop your papers in the in-box on the floor.
Escape! My scarlet memory is
Too short -- it's decrepit, really
Gone, I'll never guess til it's too late."

Mind-blowing to watch."

"event","<ol><li>I was having breakfast the other day at Verona Diner and I noticed a clip-out coupon on the placemat for ""Buy 1 bagel, get 1 free"" at the nearby Bagelwich Deli. Ok, so that's a little bit funny -- then I looked at the fine print, which said ""Second bagel of equal or lesser value"", which struck me as pretty hilarious. -- As my brother put it, ""Dude, don't try to get the special bagel for free.""
<li>The Verona Diner is an excellent place to go for breakfast if (a) you like home fries cooked just right, and (b) you like being the only person under 60 in a fairly crowded restaurant. Both (a) and (b) apply for me, so I'm golden. (I used to always order fried eggs or scrambled eggs when I ate in a diner -- lately I've been ordering poached eggs.)
<li>DiPaolo's Bakery (right across the street from the Bagelwich) is a seriously awesome thing. Go there early in the morning and get Ciabatta still warm from the oven. Do it!

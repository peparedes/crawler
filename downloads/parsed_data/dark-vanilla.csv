Why I am I posting here after I very clearly and explicitly said I wouldn't? Partly for spite and partly cause I am very tired and there for am disinclined to follow my previews rules.

At any rate I figured what would be a more fitting tribute to my dead journal and the true spirit of me then to doing something after I had expressly stated I never ever would again.

But what I had thought of as long dead tendencies are drawing me back to the familar grounds of online journals, to shout aimless frustration into the black hole that is the interenet.

As for my initial comment that started all this...

... you know what, screw this shit.

I am making this officaly my last journal entry, and calling the time of death for journal writing of any form in my life as of 3:00 am, Monday 4, April 2005. I am sure it is a day that will be lost to memory only a short few moments after I fall asleep tonight.

Any ways... umm... bye"

"event","Well it's been what, like a month sense my last real post? Probably. And you know I think it is mostly because of how my journal some how got messed up. Now it seems I only used LJ to read others Journals and post. Which is actualy fine cause I really don't have much to say.

So then why am I posting if I have nothing to say, well... mostly just got the urge. Old habits die hard and all that.

I guess the only thing I have to day that has really been on my mind lately is how it seems that nearly every one I know is losing their minds. It's hard to really say exactly what every one is doing, it's just a general sense of over complication, confusion, and nonsense that I never saw in these people before. Like some how over the past year every one finaly went off the deep end. Though I do think that part of this is due to the fact that now that I am no longer so obsessed with myself and my problems, and am mostly just living life and taking it easy, that I am just now noticing problems that where already there. What I have yet to decide is if this could account for 100% of the weirdness that has been going on.

Now of course in my usual fashion I am not going to name any names. Mostly I'm just glad that soon I will be living on my own and can start fortifying things in my life so that I don't have to be dependent on any one. Cause more then any thing I can't stand having to be dependent on some one. Not sure why, but I have always had abit of an independent nature, and it's really gotten stronger sense I spent so many months living in near total isolation. I guess I have just grown very used to having total control over my environment.

*laughs* of course now I am really starting to sound like an ass ^_^
But truth be told I actualy never felt more like myself then I do these days, despite how out of place I am compared to how I used to be. I guess when most of your personality is made of dormat traits, it can really be weird when they all get woken in relitivly short order.

But in the end I think the point I am trying to make, is that I am doing good and can't wait to FINALY start my own life. No having to get help from my parents. No more having to depend on others for stability. No more waiting for things that will never happen. I can finaly just enjoy being alive and get on with doing things my way. And it certianly doesn't hurt that I have found the will and the aditude to back of such plans. The days of just coasting through life will soon be far behind... yup...

It'll be nice...

... though there is still the matter of every one being crazy... *shrugs* oh well, I'm sure in time I'll get used to it.

** ok I know I was just writing here earlier, but some things that have just come to my attention have really... accented what I was saying about every one seeming to be going crazy. Now of course crazy is just a rash, generalized word. To be more accurate it seems every one is, well to avoid getting too obvious, succumbing to their paticular psychological maladies. Of course I also feel some how that it's not actualy that new of information. That some how I was so internaly conflicted that I was able to be almost totaly blind to so many things in those around me.

*laughs* Of course now I am starting to sound like some crack pot conspiracy guy, and I don't mean this to sound so harsh. I just can't get over how little I seem to know about those I thought I knew.

Well I suppose all I can do is keep watching and see how things progress.

Seriously though *laughs and shakes his head* I always though I was weird, hahahahahahahahahaha. Oh world and it's people, how thy keep me infinitly amused ^_^"

A kind of person you will be attracted to in a real life situation is obedient and warm.

In the process of courtship, the approach that makes you feel irresistible is being moody. Blowing hot and cold in love is exciting.

The impression you'd like to give to your lover is stylish.

One reason that would make you break up with your partner is his or her being ruthless, cold-blooded or ironic.

The kind of relationship you'd like to build with your partner is that you care not only about the present but also the future with your partner. A long-lasting relationship that you can grow with is important.

Would you commit adultery? Society and morality worry you. You wouldn't do anything wrong after marriage.

About marriage, you think marriage is a precious thing. Once you get married, you'll treasure your partner very much.

About love, at this moment, you are quite self-centered. You think of love as something you can get and trash anytime you want.

That is mostly because I am currently testing the strengthe of our latest batch to see if it really is 92% alcohol, nad it is... gezz am I wasted, and only on 2.5 shots...

..................

I feel sick... I wish some one else was here cause this is starting to feel alot like the time I drank to much and had to hold my own hair as I pucked...

this of course is proof that I am not perfect as I still have moments of idiocy and regret.... though mostly those two feelings are only founded in that I am alone when this is all happening...

...



I am at that point where If I let myself puck I could go to sleep soundly, but I am sober enough not to wan to puck even though I'll be up all night if I don't....

"event","So it's been like what, 2 weeks sense my last post, I think that is a record for me, well unless you count the time I commited myself to the mental hospital for 2 months.

Any ways, things have been really interesting sense my last post.

The first big thing is that I am now officaly hired onto a game project as lead (and only designer). The project is an online game that my brother Joe is making, only he sucks at design so that is where I come in. The game is simply a country building sim, though it is more interesting and fun then it sounds. Sense it is all online there will be lots of other players with contries of their own to interact with trough trade or war. And as far as a time scale, Joe intends to have this thing all finsided and ready 2 months from now, so needless to say we will be hauling alot of ass. But his wife Jung is helping me with the art work, so it'll actualy be not that hard of a project. In any case it'll definaitly test my design skills.

And once this game takes off and we start making money (as it will be a monthly charge of $5 to play on the network) then I can start working on a new game, something I want to make this time. Which is not to say that I don't like working on this game, it's just not my first pick for games.

But yah, so that is what I am doing right now work wise, and if it takes off quickly I may not bother going to NAIT and just move to Edmonton so I can have my own place, get high speed interenet, and be close enough to sexualy harras Michelle on a daily bases ^_~

In other news I am sore, very sore, from working as a brick layers helper for a while. Yes it is going to be a while before my back muscles heal up properly cause damn that was hard work. But enough of my wineing.

I am so tired that I can't really stay here and say much else, though I am not sure there is much else of any importance to say.

So I guess I will go, and sleep... yah

Good night every one, I'll post something better some other day, hopefully soon.

"event","So it would seem that my Live Journal has magicaly transformed into a pile of shit. I mean one day it was just fine, and then the next POW! it's all fucked up. Of course I am too lazy to fix it right now, I'll leave that for another day when I have more time and by then it should be pissing me off enough to be proper motivation.

But yah that last few days having been hanging over me like a heavy sweater that you got at christmas from your grandma and have to wear while your there to be nice when it actualy really itchs and looks really dorky...

heh, ok getting off track with the metaphor not with standing, it's been weird these last few days. It's like all this free time and playing video games has finaly made my mind start acting on it's own. By this I mean I'll find that now and then through out the day depsite what I might be doing, I'll start thinking like I used so many years ago. having deep thoughts about life and the world in general. I have also had the ""pleasure"" of a strong resurgance of game ideas lately. It seems no matter how hard I try I just can't stop my mind from thinking such things, which is to no end annoying because right now there is nothing I can do about and game ideas I might have because my life is in one of those annoying In-Between phases where there is nothing going on and all I have to do is keep living until I get to then. And let me tell you that is never end fun :P especaily for some one like me that can just barely keep still long enough to what the LoTRs movies.

And of course when I get in this sort of way I start doing things subconsiously to make it worse. Like just now as I dug through my music for something to listen to that I haven't in a while, what should I grab but the CD Michelle made for me. Not even thinking about it any more then ""Hey I haven't listened to this in like for ever"", I started listening to it and went back to my fumbling and wondering on the internet. Shortly after, some 4 songs into the CD I start to get really nostalgic of the days of hanging out with Michelle, Shantel and Stan. Though that should have been expected I guess, but I was busying doing sweet fuck all online.

*thinks* you know what is weird, the strongest connection to my memories always seems to be made with music. I have known this sense grade 8, and yah it's just weird. I mean I can sit and think back to past events and get an ok picture of what happened, but if there was ever music present and I listen to that song(s) then the memory gets really clear. Yah, just another one of those odd things...

You know in the last few days I have had several moments where I thought to myself ""You know, I think I would really like get into the science of studying the brain"". I have always had a strong fasination with the inner workings of the human body, just as strong I guess as my fasination with the workings of human society. But more often then not I tend to get more into the inner body stuff, and lately it seems especaily the brain. Just to try and probe the depths of the brain, to root out the elusive human consiousness and discover it's secrets. To find out trully what makes a person who they are. Is it trully some spirit, or perhaps simply the product of several complex brain functions all going at once.

*laughs thinking* you know I must come off as being one strange character. At times I can act hyper and almost childish doing what ever seemse funnest and giggling at damn near every thing. Then other times I'll just sit and space out and think about things that would make most peoples heads spin or have long conversations with some one about the greater causes behind human behavious. It's like I'm some kind of bizzare hybrid of achient Greek philsopher and a hyperactive 10 year old.

I guess that only solace I can give others is that I have developed a highly tuned sense of when it is best to do which.

Another thing to note is that there are times when I some how end up being both at the same time, or as close to it as is possible. And let my assure you, such a thing is as bizzare as you might imagine.

*thinks* Though another more recent thing I have noticed is that, with my recent attempts to straiten out all my childhood issues, because what would childhood be like with out issues, I found that I am more and more often settling into a state of being not really either hyper or deep, but still a fair mix of both. Which has been nice as it has all but eliminated my previous emotional imbalance. Though as I said I do still get moments of one or the other very strongly, which is always fun, because those are my two favourite things to do: mess around and just have fun for the sake of having fun, and sitting and just thinking/talking about life in general.

Yah... my fingers hurt and I blame the games I have been playing, they really get my fingers hurting ^_^
But they are fun and help pass the time as I wait out another awful snow storm :P

You know with all this snow constantly coming and trapping me at home I get an odd feeling that is a mix of freedom and isolation. It's like yay I am stuck so I don't have to worry about doing anything important cause I can't do anything any ways, but then I think that geez it would be nice if I could go some where and enjoy my freedom, but then if I could go some where I wouldn't be free anymore cause then I'd have to get back to work...

heh it seems I can work any thing in my life into some bizzare oxymoron of opposing parts, and yet this is how I am most comfortable, living in that thin space that devides one oppossing thing from the other. It's how I have always lived, making my own way by taking what I need from the world and making it work for me as I have always in one way or another been left to fend for myself, and as such I just got used to it. Right from being a child my life has been my own with very little outside influence because by the time there where influencing forces my self was pretty much set. All though this did also have the double effect of making me very unstable and gave me termanly low self esteem for a few years untill I learned to deal with being very seperate in thought and method then most other people. But as I said, I am now just fine with that and have mustered the inner strength to hold my own against a world of people with ideologies that are general all going in an opposite direction to mine.

Yah actualy through all the messed up times I've had just learning how to cope with being me, I can honestly say I have now found inner peace. I can't really say why I say that, it just feels the right way to describe how I feel. It's like I've met and handled every issues I've ever had and now I just sorta feel good in general about everything. Not to sound like I've turned into some silly opptimist, no I am still a strong realist, but now I am just happier and more content with who I am and how things are.

Though I know this will never stop me from introspection as I know there is a great deal I don't know about myself still. Though I mean that is a scientific sense, not in a ""Bad line out of movie where the main character has grown despite the hardships and is now a better person but still has many person demons to work out"" sense. Mostly I would just like to get a better understanding of what makes things work inside my head the way they do, and perhaps get some solid answers to some very old questions.

But yah I think I'm done for tonight. As per usual I have talked much more then I intended to and on topics totaly different from what I started with. But then that is how I tend to think, so no surprise there right ^_^

Any ways, Later days every one,

"event","So here I sit and am ever so proud of myself I can't quite put it into words.

Now some of you may not be aware of the experiment that I was doing with a friend of mine. You see where had decided to attempt to make our own hard liquor. Now of course you with think when two guys that don't know much about anything try and do something like this from scratch, that the expectations are for it to be just non lethal and non water.

But after the first batch was officaly tested last night I can safely say it was a huge success. In fact it turned out so well that it was better then anything I've had from the store before, and I am tried my fair share of different alchols.

You see what we ended up with was something that is about 80% proof that is also the smoothest hard liquor I've ever had. Now I am not just saying this cause I am trying to make the result of out meager efforts sound better then it was, cause any one that knows me knows I am fairly picky about what I drink. I am very big on having something strong that doesn't taste strong.

And well that is just what we made. It seems that even though it is twice as strong as most normal hard liquors it's taste and kick (which is how rough it is) is quite unnoticable if you mix it with Coke or Root Beer (I highly suggest Root Beer myself cause then you can bearly taste it at all).  Now one would think it would be contradictory that something this strong would be this easy to drink, which was what I thought, but it this is what I have reasoned so far.

--You see when we started distiling it, it was harsh as you would expect. It burned worse then wiskey and in general was unpleasent just to be around. But then after wher had distilled it three times and cleaned it through the carbon filter twice it took out all that made it hard and just left the strength and the slightly odd smell and taste (which I will add mixes exelently with root beer). So yah, you could say it is very nearly a perfect liqour, You don't have to drink all night to get a good buzz, but it easy to drink and seems to absorb into the body in a very gentle way so you don't feel sick. I mean it's just... well lets just say best case scenario sums it up very well.

So yah, just thought I'd let you all now of the huge success our little experiment was. And by that time I see any of you again, we will have finished the second batch and I'll safe some for you to all try.

Any ways, later to you all, Jason Out"

"event","[A warning from the end: I have just finished this entry and it turned out to be a long devel into my past and mind so if you are interested in such things then carry on, if not you might want to save yourself the trouble cause it's super ass long.]

So here I sit, not tired, but with out the effort to do anything constructive, so instead I turn to the bottle, and then to LJ.

Tonight was nice, back online, had a nice chat with Kori and Chris.

Shit, I almost blew it, jeez maybe drinking and Posting isn't a good idea. But then again I don't usualy have begin secrets that need to be kept.

So I guess on to news that I can talk about. My talks with Chris continue to fill my pour head and heart with doubt. I mean on one had I don't feel attracted to guys any more, but on the other hand Chris is so totaly perfect, but then I always get mixed signals from him as to weather he feels anything for me other then friendship, but then again I just can't think of any one that would be better to be with (woman or man). It's so confusing, but thus is the game of love. The only solace I have is that I won't really need to deal with it untill I move to Edmonton, which gives me time to try and delve deep into his mind and see what he thinks. Too bad I don't have some one that knows him that could ask for me... then again to bad I am too much of a pussy to just out right ask him myself. But then again it's very likely better to wait on that untill I move to Edmonton, cause long distance relationships suck ass hard core, and the biggest failing I have had in my past relationships is making commitments in a long distance relationship that I find I can not back up once the relationship gets face to face *he coughs suggestively*. Oh well lesson learned I guess.

But well, this time it's really different. I mean well... it's kinda scary how similar we are, yet we are still quite different, in that cool sort of way.

... yah and also I think it would be good to hang out with him lots in person before I say anything, you know, just because it's always easiest to gage a person when you see how they react to real life every day situations.

[And on a side note I can't beleive how well I am typing considering how fast I am finishing off my bottle of Polar Ice Vodka, which by the way kicks Smirnoff Vodka's ass]

Love... the one thing in my life I can't nial down, examine fulling, and plan out intracitly, which is how I like to handle the big and important things in my life. Which is funny how contradictory that is to my day to day life, which is comprised mostly of just flying by the seat of my pants.

But you know, I just can't help but be mildly obssesed with love, which is weird for my cause normaly I am so laid back I bearly even get concerned let alone obssesed. I just... well being lacking of a second half has been on my mind ever sense I was a little kid. Back then of course I was only thought of it as a super best friend, but now as I mature so does the thought, but the need is the same. My life is actualy fairly interesting most of the time despite what I say, and well it can kinda get depressing when I have a great time, but then realise it was all on my own, that there was no one to share it with. But I guess that is a big catch for me, I like having others around to share experinces with, I don't know why, but things always feel more fun, more interesting, more real when I have some one with me. And I mean not just some one along for the ride, but some one with a real interest in it, even if that interest is root in the idea that they are only interested because I am, cause that is cool. I do that alot, take an interest in something that I normaly would care about because some one else is interested in it alot, but I guess that goes back to my sharing thing, I just like to share life even sharing others lives with them. This I think is why I make friends so easily, cause of how quickly I take a real interest in some one else and there goings on.

*laughs* actualy it's kinda funny, I have a hard time remembering answers for tests in school and things like that, but when it comes to random facts and tid bits about my friends, well they stick like glue and almost seem to carry as much importance in my mind as if they where personal things of my own. This of course has always been abit of a sore point for me in the past though, be so inclined to be good friends, for it was often not reciprocated in the earlier years of my life. Whic of course had the effect of really messing me up, but I am getting over my beleif that no one thinks about me when I am not around, this is mostly because I now know it's not true. Mostly because if I ever think other wise Kori will do lude and scary things to me ^_^

But all of life is a learning proccess, it just gets harder as you get older cause the brain at this age is already well set in it's ways. As such it takes a strong mental effort to make old habits and beleifs that are untrue go away. But nothing worthing doing is ever easy, or at least never as easy as it could be. But in a way that is good cause if you just got everything you ever wanted handed to you on a silver plate, well you don't get the bond that you would get had you worked for it.

Another habit I am working at fixing is my tendency to always look at myself as a mature child. That started way back in elemetary school, roughly grade 3, when I found that though I enjoyed having fun like other kids I was also more serious and thoughtful then them at times. And as I grew up like this it became more apperent as I became better friends with my school teachers then my peers. By the time I was in senior high school it was really set in that I was exactly what I said, a mature child. I still thought of myself as a child, which let me let myself get away with alot of stupid things. At the same time I always tried to act very mature and responsible, and as I later found too responsible for someone of my age. So in a sense I both missed out on being a kid in some ways and did it too much in others.

This of course is what I blame for the eventual down fall of Jason. It started when I didn't really give any thought to post-secondary schooling and just went with the easiest option, not really thinking about it. Later it all came down on my like any poorly thought out plan does eventualy. I flunked out of university severly, which started my depression. 

Then there was the small vacation over to B.C. with Holly and Eric. I say vacation because that is what it ended up being. While there I really let things fall apart. For some reason, though I had been jaded already from pervious experince, I let my imagination get the best of me (which is easy for me becuase of how strong it is) and started to not only entertain, but live out delussion. Needless to say none of that was good, though I won't get into details. Mostly it was just my need for companionship hitting me like a tonne of bricks and being unable to cope with it properly in my current state.

So by the time I came back to Alberta and moved to Edmonton I was very much messed up. I started work at Convergys which was a bad idea from the start although I don't reget it because of the friends I have met there (which seems to be a constant in my life, all my poor decisions alwasy end in me meeting one of my better friends). But any ways at the days turned into weeks at Convergys and I went through serious issues as the extent of how much my former life in Breton had desolved (wathcing my brother start dating and having less and less time to hang out was the worst). Then it hit me as I went from training to actual work in Convergys. I panic worse then I did back in University and feel apart totaly, and I can safely say that that was the turning point, that was when everything became irriversible.

After that I couldn't hold a job, I went through 3 after that. Maple Leaf Metals, Artic Spas, and finaly The computer store one (name of store escapes me as of right now). But I am getting ahead of myself here. As I looked for work things got worse as I hung out with Michelle, Shantel and Stan. At this point I basicaly just let my emotions run rampant, and I am now saying for the first time (to be fulling honest and acurate) I became desperate for attention. I couldn't help my self. My self-esteem was all but zero and my need for acceptance became all consuming, making me do and say things that make me ashamed now. As the job at Maple Leaf Metals fell apart I tried to seek help, though I admit I was not really looking for help deep inside, no I wanted quick and easy answers, fast relief from my inner problems.

That is the time that Bob came into my life, which was at best a mixed blessing (no offence intended). I know I was ready for a relationship then, but I was no longer thinking as I said. My emotions where in control of everything and pushed me to try and do things that I should have know where not possible. So in the end the relationship ended some what poorly, but I think all hurt feelings are ok now.

It was during this time that I recieved my car with the promise of being able to go back home and drive to work some where clsoe by. So I went to work for Artic Spas (they make hot tubs). To my shame I only lasted 3 days there before I gave up. This is when I snapped and finaly decided to make the biggest cry for attention I could (as suicide has always benn thankfully beyond my capabilities). I check myself into a mental institute under the premise that I was suicidaly depressed. Of course this was all a dual attempt to hide from my life and gain attention and pity. I stayed there for a few weeks, in which time I met a very nice nerotic fellow by the name of Mike. Wether or not the fantastic stories he told where true, it helped in a way to have some one to talk to that I didn't feel would judge me (seeing as his supposed life was much worse and dispicable then mine). Eventualy though my mother convinced me to leave saying that I could come home and spend some time at home to just rest and think things through.

Of course it wasn't long after this that I decided I was much better and ready to tackle life. I still do not understand why my mind cycled like that at this time. Rising high and getting me into something I was not mentaly stable enough to handle at the time, only to drop me as soon as things got a little hectic. But none the less I though I had it all figured out and went back to Edmonton to find a job I could handle. After a month or so of trying I never did find something I could muster up the guts to stay with, and when Michelle left Edmonton I sort of lost my desire to try and find work.

So back home I came, which was about 5 months ago. In that time I have spent alot of it alone, with more time to think that I could have ever thought possible. I made myself as usefull as I could, helping my mom work on her new house and look after my younger siblings for her. And well some where between the seemingly endless nights talking to myself and watching as my mother went through hell and back to hold her life together trhough her divorce, well something finaly started clicking in my head, and sense then each day seems only to serve as nother step out of the hole that I dug for myself.

I have regained alot of my former zeal for life and with a newly forged understanding of myself and the world I find everything almost seems to be brand new. Some days I feel as though the difference is so large that I could draw a clear line between how I was before and how I am now. If ever there was such a thing as a second chance at life, then this would be it for me.

*laughs* and now this has been quite abit more from me then I intended to type tonight. But is felt good, very cathardic, and perhaps informational for any who stuck with me and read this long draw out thing ^_^

But I should get to bed, the bottle is empty and I am quite tired now. Funny how just an hour of typing could be so tiring, but then the booze is at just the right amount in my system to make me sleepy.

So good night to all, and hopefully you don't have to go through an up and down life like I did just to figure yourself out, though I think for all my friends it is already too late for that, so then I guess good luck is more appropriate.

Later all, 
Jason Out

P.S. some where in there I lost track of my point, which was that even though my early child hood left me kinda messed up, I think I am by and large through the worst of it now."

Finding a decent place to work has been hell and so has taking care of this damn house and the people and other animals that inhabit it and it's grounds. Seriously though, I feel like I am the mom of this messed up group. Always cleaning up after then and shaking my head when they do something stupid and going tsk tsk. Pretty soon I'll be going to sleep with curlers in my hair and bitching every one out about how we never spend any family time together any more... *shudders*

Other then that things have been going good as usual. My experiments in making alchol having been going well, though my partner in crime and I have yet to test our first batch. The offical test date is this sunday, so if you want to come get smashed on some seriously messed up home made booze drop by Breton.

I ahve also been having lots of really deep and thoughtful moments lately, more then usual any ways. I chalk this up to my lack of having any one intelligent to talk to unless I come online. Though I did have an ingaging talk with my dad the other week. He has some very... dark world views, and just when I thought I knew the guy *shrugs* Just goes to show you never really know some... that is untill you're on the same plane when it crashes in the mountains and you are all forced to draw straws to see who gets eaten first... ahem, but I am getting ahead of myself.

But yah, I think it is safe to say I am having one of my ""jezz to I miss every one alot"" spells right now. Just that last few days I can't help but think how much life sucks with all my good friends living so far away. I mean it's like all the people in the world I trust are living in whole other provinces. Damn I curse my inability to shift time and space and move instantly from one point to another.

Well I am done spanking the monkey... I mean typing this ingaging journal post. I'll talk to you all later.

Nah, I know it's nothing like that, I am just curious as to why my brain is so full of funny thoughts for no apperent reason. Perhaps it is just because today is a good day after having a few bad ones, and I slept really well. Yah that is likely, just some release.

I hate these things, they are stupid... :P

I just never enjoy them cause most of the answers possible are not even close to any thing that relates to me. I mean they are at the same time too general and too specific. Why did I do it them? Mostly cause I am bored and it was in Micheals journal.

Any ways onto important matters.
*sits up strait and makes a drum roll on his desk with his fingers*

I AM JOB! YAY!

That's right, I went to my job interview today and was hired before it was even done. And the best part is, I just dropped off my resume 4 days ago, then got a call for my interview the day after that. So in 3 days I got a job, that is a kick ass record, though I would like to have a job hire me on the spot once, just for fun.

But yes, I have now officaly joined the racks of Grocery Clerks every where, and I fill my black heart swell with pride. I shall bag and carry groceries with pride, and stock shelves with great vigor and procision. I will learn the art of Clerking, and soon will have the strongest Clerk-Fu IN THE WORLD!

Oh and my car kicks ass, though I wish it had a CD player instead of an cassette deck cause in this cold weather my cassettes get cold and then play kinda crappy untill the deck warms up.

But other then that all is great.

I am kick names and taking ass!  *dances happily* joy joy, I am content

And this weekend promises many fun things, some interesting alchemical things, and perhaps a few drunk things. And then tonight I will punch my self in the stomach untill I start writing the story I have planned. Which will either result in me getting lots of writing done, or... well lets just say I'll be sore for a while. You may bet on which you think will happen.

Then on monday, well what I do then will depend on what happens on Sunday, but I am thinking mostly reading, writing and hanging out. Then to bed early for I start work on Tuesday. And after that...... INSANE MONKEY INVASION!

or maybe just more work, which ever I guess ^_^

Oh you know, I should update my web page on monday too... yah!

.... You know what, my life fucking kicks ass... IN YOUR FACE!

.......... ahem ^_^;;

Any ways my plans for the future are so going along as planned... minus one week actualy, but one week is like nothing... nothing compared to my AWESOME MIGHT! ... did I mention that my might was awesome?

So yah if your waiting for me to stop being weird, you might have to wait a while, cause I am so fucking stocked with how well things have been going that I am like super charged with the power of ass kicking. I swear if it keeps going like this I'll have enough power to shot lasers from my eyes... thats LASERS! ... from my EYES! .......... EYE LASERS!

*runs around in a tight circle making laser sounds untill he gets dizzy and falls over*

.... ow...

Hey you know what would really kick ass?! If I got off my lazy ass and made some more comic strips for my web page so that I have more stuff to update... yah... that would kick ass.... but, I am soooooooo lazy right now... and typing is FUN!

YAY TYPING!

"event","Heh, it's been a long night and keep running into all these songs that Kori burned on a CD for me.

*chuckles* damn you Kori, I can't listen to these songs now with out missing you ^_^

... and even though they where rough times in my life, I miss them, mostly cause I miss hanging out with Kori...

It's still hard to beleive it's over some times. I mean for as long as I can remember Kori was in Edmonton, now she isn't and well, it's just as dramatic a change as saying losing half of down town...

But she did want she needed to do so it's cool, she is just going to be very hard to replace. Not that she ever will really be replaced, I just mean I'll need some one else to hang out with all the time now that she has moved...

And it really wasn't that long ago... if I think hard enough I can still vividly remember her apartment. I remember her and shantel and stan, though I guess I can still hang out with stan, it won't be the same...

... the worst part is at the time I was so messed up I couldn't really be as good a friend as I should have... alot of time was wasted (I feel) because of my stupidness. Though I am not sure what I would have done different had I the chance... well other then one or two really stupid things like the knife thing and... umm... other stuff.... man, now that I think about it I am so embarrased. What a glutton for attention I was.

But I guess it's best this way, so that should we ever get back together some day some where so that we can hang out again it'll be some where new. I find that helps alot, being some where new when you are trying to start fresh...

...

Damn... I think the worst part about the future is that is does not come fast enough. Especaily right now. it will be 8 months from now before I get back to Edmonton, and then one whole year of classes at NAIT, but then that won't be as bad a wait cause I will be learning lots of new stuff, and will at least be back in Edmonton so my free time is not always wasted doing nothing alone.

Of course there are several reasons for why I can hardly wait to get back to Edmonton... heh in fact it seems my whole life begins then. Everything I am doing now is all just pre-life set up. And while I can handle that, it's so....... so long :P

...

In some ways I feel bad that it took me this long to get my life in order, but when i think about it, it doesn't make a huge difference. I mean really, I would have only gained 2 years, and lost so much else.

I mean if I had not of done what I did I would never have met... 5 or so good friends, and would have missed out on so many things...

But then i guess that is how it goes... no regrets...

*sings along to his music*
I've notice how much you've changed,
Even if you swear you're still the same..


heh... it's funny after listening to enough different songs all in a row, how my emotional state just sort of levels out. Then I end up feeling something that really isn't any paticular emotion, just sort of the feeling of just being...

I enjoy being like this mostly because it is the one time when I know everything is as it is. Everything I see is real, no distortion, no delussions... just unaltered life.

it also seems that it's at these times i get the most thoughtful... well perhaps not the most, but definitely the most serious. These are the times when I wonder about the meaning of life. When I think deeply about being me. When everything becomes possible again. it is at these times that I wonder why I ever felt the way I have in the past. Years and years of living come back nearly crystal clear and I watch with mild interest for the most part. In a way it's like being asleep, yet wide awake.

*thinks and half smiles* though I would think it would be kind of scary to always be this way... I don't think I could function. Everything I do in life is strongly connected to one emotion or another. With out that well... there is just raw life.

...

You know there have been so many nights like this overmy life. Ever sense junior high I have found myself, every so often, sitting at a computer, just typing what I think, while music slides by in the back of my mind. At such times all I really want to do is talk, just wax intellectual with some one for hours untill the sun rises and I can't stay awake any more...

...

You know, I was just thinking, I always found it hard to find some one that would stay up as long as I do. Most every one seemed content to get up and sleep at certain times, but I never really had that drive. I mean I can do it with the aid of an alarm clock and self disseplin, but if I don't have to worry about time, well it just seems to slip past me unnoticed. I tend to sleep almost as much as I am awake if I get the chance, 12 hours asleep, 20 awake, which is a good reason why my sleeping pattern does not fit well with others, seeing as it is not 24 hour based. Though I will admit that many of the hours I am awake toward the end of every day are just  made of my pure refusal to goto sleep. I never knew why I do this, but as long as I have been alive I have fought sleep. Always trying to push the edge of sleep as far as I can before I finaly give in, trying to cram as much into one strech of awakefulness as I can. Though not much ever gets done in the last hours.

But I should get back to my work, I have already typed much more then I had planned

"event","Well another year down... and you know I think on the whole this has been my best year so far.

Sure it wasn't full of the most good things, but in the end it did me the msot good, so it's all good ^_^

Other then that though, I think every thing else I want to say about this new year has already be said, so I won't blather on about it any further.

In other news the thought struck me just a few minutes earlier, that perhaps I may be too much. By that I mean that most people who know me only have to be around me for small periods of time. And well I am not sure how easy I would be to handle on a more daily basis. Now I am not saying I am intolerable or anything... I just get the feeling that I might get... annoying ^_^;;

This thought came to me of course as I danced across the house (yet again) while singing some song off the top of my head and in general acting bizzare.

Now I don't do this sort of stuff all the time, but it happens frequently enough...

Or maybe it's just all this isolation has finaly gone to my head and I have forgotten what the rest of the world is like, and in that that I am not really all the weird...

Though it might also seem more prevelent because I am almost complete free I'm my previous shyness, and so the weird things that I normaly only did when alone, I now do all the time despite present company... well almost, there are some times and places that I know to shut up and behave myself... sort of like a little kid but with a better sense of timing ^_^

*thinks about this*

....... you know I spend so much time thinking about other poeple and other things, that I never really think about me. I mean sure I thought about me lots in the past few years, but that was all clinical thinking as in ""How can I stop from being a depressed loser idiot. But not very often to I just sit and think, what kind of person am I? What do I beleive? What do I want to be and do?

...

*chuckles* I should have guessed I'd end up thinking these kind of thoughts tonight seeing as ealier I was staring at myself in the mirror trying to force myself to look at my reflection subjectivly (because normaly I only look at my reflection if I need to do something to my face or hair, never just to look).

Yah, it's an odd sort of thing to think about, but now that my depression is gone and my self esteem returned, I'm starting to remember that I too am a person like every one else (yes for a while I forgot that, it was not pleasent). And well I find myself asking myself questions like ""What sort of person am I and what roll do I fill in a group?""

Am I the serious person that always has a plan? Am I the leader who centralises everything and makes it all happen? Am I the cynical pessimist that every one puts up with? Am I the joker that always tries to make people laugh? Am I the greyish background character that mostly just hangs out with others to make the group look bigger? Am I the smart but quiet one that others look to for technical help? Am I the boistrous reble who enjoys getting into trouble?

... and come to think of it, at one time or another I have been all of these things... well except for the reble one, I'm not much of a reble. I'm saving up all my naughty points for the time when I have to do something REALLY bad ^_^

And also over the years every one I know has seen a different me for one reason or another. Either it was one of my old mask I wore to hide the real me, or maybe they saw the me-in-progress. I mean almost every one has seen a different me... or at least I would think so, though I can never be totaly sure how others see me... well except for Kori, she never fails to tell me just what she thinks ^_^

yah... some day when I have more time (and am less tired) I should maybe write some of this stuff down, just as much for me as for any one else.

... 

now I am stuck wonering all this........ who am I?

I mean I think I know, but then I also know that my view of the world is greatly skewed from the norm, so does what I think I am mean anything..?

Of course I don't just have what I think about myself to go on. There are the words of others which are often much more valuable, though also more scarce...

... All I can really gather from what others say about me is that I am a nice guy, that is funny, smart in certain areas, and uncommonly creative. One thing I notice is that there are not so many negative things said about me, which most would take at face value as them just being a good person, but I know that there are alot of things people think about other people that never get said. Also many of the things that people have said that where faults I am currently working hard to fix, and am more or less successful with all of them.

Now I guess that is a good start..... but more negative things about me would be nice... not that I think I a full of flaws, I just would like an outsiders opinion on some of my lesser qualities, and I have a few.

... I guess I would just like to know what others think of me and what kind of person I come off as when I am around.

...

Yah I think that is it for tonight, just some odd ponderings.

Later all, and happy new year

"event","Damn, I really wish I knew what it felt like to be in love.

So many times I thought I knew, but these days I am not sure that the things I thought are not what I thought they where... which is even more confusing then it sounds ^_^

I mean I know what love for family and friends is like, but well, I've never really felt anything other then that, even for the people that I considered (at the time) to love in the romantic sense.

and... the most confusing part is that I think I might know what love is like, but I don't trust the last few years of my life enough to be certain.

...

*sighs* Why might I bring all this up you might wonder... well cause I find myself in the situation where I think I might be falling for some one. Well actualy I know I have a crush on the person, I just don't know if it's any thing other then a crush and silly flirting...

*makes a face* I wish I wasn't so helpless when it comes to this stuff... I'm used to being in control, knowing what's going on, having a plan of some kind... but love isn't something that can be handled that way...

and you know I won't be so nervous if it wasn't for the fact that I have stumbled a few times in the ways of love already. One's willingness to do something that is not entirely certain tends to weaken after a few foulled up attempts. 

*makes a crooked smile and laughs* The one thing in life that I really want just had to be the one thing I can plan out :P

...

back I am getting off track. What I really need to know is if love is always going to be like this. Will there ever be a point when I do know what I am doing?

I really doubt it. Given the nature of love it seems that you are only certain at the last possible moment...

...and I have been wrong before...

And I wish I could wait, but I am not sure if I should... I mean if I don't really want to say anything untill I can spent more time with this person, but it'll be quite a few months before that can happen, and well alot can happen in that time. I would just really regret if this person found some one else before I got a chance to speak my mind... but right now I am not totaly sure if I am sure of what is on my mind... if that makes sense. I mean if I say something now, what if I am wrong, but if I wait untill then what it it's too late...

*makes a face*

And there is one other thing... I haven't really told alot of people, but even though I am Bi, recently I had grown... disinterested in men, in that way any ways. This is with one exception of course, the exception being the person I am speaking of. And so I am just... unsure what this conflict of feels means. I mean on one hand I am starting to feel very strait as in I no longer have any sexual interest in men, but on the other hand I having very strong feelings for this guy, none of them sexual, but all of them much more then friends... and it just doesn't make sense... and I don't want to say anything when I am unsure like this, I owe him more then that...

*hands his head backwards and makes a odd noise of frustration*

Perhaps love is something that you have to make... it doesn't just exist in full complete form. You do get something to work from, feelings. ideas... but ultimately it's up to the couple to make it become more...

and so on that thought, if there is a foundation of sorts, then there could be something, you just have to work at it...

.....

Damn I wish I could be with him in person more...... and damn him for always saying just the right things at just the right time, making it impossible not think about him...  

and you know I think that is the biggest issue I have. He is so perfect right now that I am afriad that if I do anything I might ruin it some how... and then I won't have him...

But damn it, if I don't do anything then I'll never have him... I mean It's better to take the chance and fail then to never try at all, cause then at least you know for sure that you did all you could, and then you can move on...

but it nearly makes me sick to think that this might not work out...

...

I wonder, is that love... feeling that way about some one...

... well I guess only time will tell, and I think in time I'll get the nerve to do the right thing. And untill then I'll just continue to have to do my best not to be too transperent in my feelings... though I think my flirting kinda gives me away pretty good :P

Well I guess that's it for now, later all
Jason

"event","So New Years nears and I have not a one decent New Years party to go to, oh well I can party on my own, no big deal.

Though on the subject of new years. Normaly I thumb my nose at the whole new years resolution thing, but this year I have to admit I am not as quite all I would like to be, so I am making the resolution to work out every day. I just can't handle it any more, looking in the mirror and being able to make the magority of my torse jiggle :P

But seeing as there is no point in waiting untill friday to start I have already started working out as of last monday. So far it's been going well, though my body is still sore as it gets used to weight lifting and jogging, but that will pass soon, and the best part is that even though I've only be at it for the last 3 days I have already notice my gut is not as prominet. Hopefully by this time next month I should be rid of most of the unwanted jiggling and be back in shape. My ultimate goal is to just get back to how I was as a kid, so not muscle bound or anything, just skinny and firm, and be able to run a fair ways with out getting tired.

One thing I would like to say, something that is abit of a person gripe, is how immature alot of the ""adults"" I know tend to act. Perhaps it is just the magic of of the holidays that makes every one so juvinile, but it is upseting to have to deal with. I not saying that I never act this way, but only under extreme cercumstances... well lately any ways, half a year ago I was kind of mental myself. But any ways my point is is that every one needs to grow up abit. Cause it's alright to argue now and again, but when you can't go a ful day with out turning something into a problem, well you need help.

And I am not trying to sound like the king of perfect or anything, I just think every one takes everything to seriously. *shrugs* but I don't expect to change any ones ways just by saying this, mostly I just wanted to say it so that it is said, it helps me let go of it. Which means that I shall not say another word about it after today (unless some one really starts acting like an ass). Mostly I just wish every one would calm down more for their own sake. Being so angry and defensive all the time isn't health for your mind or body (hell it damn near killed me). So... I don't know, think twice and talk once might be a good idea.

*makes a face and then smiles* You know I can't beleive I still talk like this. But then I wouldn't want to give any one the wrong message by saying all this the way I would really like, but then I guess that would not look so good, if I flew off the handle and yelled aat some one because they can't control them selves. yes... self control, it does wonders.

Any ways I'll just say one last thing and then I'll bugger off for tonight. To who ever might read this, if you think this is directed at you, it isn't, it is just a general outward thing towards alot of people. 

But yah, here's to hopeing that all this stupidness is just another side effect of the holiday season.

Talk to you all later (some sooner then others)

"event","I am here to anounce that after a life time of playing video games, I am done. Done what? Done having anything to do with them that's what. Normaly I am fairly tollerant about the medicroity of modern entertainment, but tonight I finaly found myself thinking something that just pushed me over the edge.

I was reading some game reviews online trying to find a good game to spend my holiday cash on, when I read this one review that said the game in question was fun, but not quite as fun as Zelda, and I laughed. The zelda games are not fun, not any more any ways. The glory days of gameing on the SNES and Genesis are long gone, with only the very odd glimmer of hope. But in the end even the games that are above the curve still fall short of anything worth while. And I am not complaining because of money wasted on the game, but rather the time. I just don't get that satisfying feeling from games anymore, the feeling that I actualy performed a task of some skill, inteligence and difficulty.

It seems that modern games are lacking in verything except exessive eye candy. Creativiy in game play is at an all time low with only Catamiry Damashi (Sp?) and a few other games to show any sighs of intelligent life. Now I would not be so quick to complain if we where still stuck with 90's computer technology, but with the power of computers these days there is no excuses for the lack of quality in games. It's almost as if the developers have no contact or active interest in the public that they produce for. I find myself, to much dismay, wondering if the developers of some games even played the finished product before shipping.

Many say that video games are not quite on par with movies as far as cultural acceptance, but nothing could be farther from the truth. With every new year of games there are more and more over used ideas, worn out genres, and oh gawd the sequels... is there not a single person left with original ideas. These days what passes for orginal is simply the careful remixing of old ideas with some fancy accessories.

I remember a time when gaming was blowing, when out of ever 5 games at least one was pushing things forward, creating genres, sstarting trends. But then perhaps it is that which has now stunted the industry. Now that things are established, everyone just works with what has been established so to make the proccess easier on them. I mean how many games in this latest generation of games has made you think ""Hey, that's sweet. I never would have thought of that."". How many games these days are inventive enough to require an ajustment to the genre titles so that it can be labled?  These days developers seem to think they are doing good as long as they can list a game under 2 or more pre-existing genres. Adventure/Shoot, Action/Adventure, Puzzle/RPG.

I mean I don't want to sound like a broken record, but Katamari Damashi is the only game in recent years that really resounds in my mind as worth while. I mean when you look at it, what is it? Not action, or adventure. Little or no puzzle. Certianly not shooter or fighting. It is just weird ass, and all the better for it.

I would also like to say that any one that says that it is too hard to come up with orginal, genre creating games these days, should be check for criticaly low imagination and creative thought values. I can say with out a shadow of a doubt that the range of games possible with todays console and computer technology is so vast that what we currently look at as a very rubust selection is only a small percent. But then nobodies needs to think any more. The game industry has grow fat and lazy with giants like EA simply feeding off of gamer marker that largely has forgot the glory days, or in many cases where not alive for them. More and more developers, not only get away with but even profit from bland ideas.

With things in this state I no longer feel bad that I have all but forsaken my plans to design games. The masses of gamers are growing complacent and stupid (sorry if that seems harsh). They have dumbed down to the level of the games, with all traces of skill long gone. I remember many times hear friends talk about games and how they ""needed"" a players guilde or online walk through to complete the game. I am always caught half way between weeping openly and uncheck rage when some one says how hard a game was and how long it took them, when I myself was easily able to complete it (this is taking into consideration that I am not even a very good gamer). I am certain there are some people out there that must be even more agast then I at how such games could be considered challenging, when they can breaze through the came with virtualy no effort. And how could you not when every other game uses game play that is so old it's practiacly mythology. I mean it's not hard to finish a game when you can anticipate every move, when ever turn can be seen ten turns away, when there is no surprise other then how quickly the end of the game is reached, when the level of skill and intelligence the game is designed for is rock bottom, when a small handful of poorly done ideas can be considered in any ways a complete game.

The only possitive thing I have to say is to all the studios that still bother to put an honest effort into a game so that they can say that they did the best they could with what they had. That they took the time to make sure theire ideas where completly fleshed out before they tried to make a game out of them.

Any ways I have ranted for much longer then I had planned. All I wanted to say is that untill the game industry starts to smarten up, I am not spending another penny on it. I'll buy something worth while with my money, like some good books (very likely Terry Prachet books), new head phones, tasty candy, and who knows what else. And the time I save not playing these games I can spend going for walks, reading, writing, drawing in Photoshop and Illistrator, perhaps even putting the finishing touches on my latest board game idea.

Well I should get going, I really want to read this online comic Jack.

Later every one,
Jason"

I think I have changed more then I thought I did. I mean all my efforts where honest enough in that I just wanted my self esteem back and all that jazz. But it seems the route that I took to change may not have been the greatest plan ever.

For I thought that it might be easiest if I just let the other side of my personaly slowly take over, while tempering it with my normal one, and for a while it worked.

But now more and more I am get the urge just to be sardonic for no reason other then it amuses me at how some people act. Some times I wonder though is that is so bad, I mean I don't do it to be mean (most of the time), but in the back of my head my need to be nice still nags at me when I feel the need to laugh at some one just because of how they act.

Though I think on the whole I'm going to need to let go of alot my old hang ups. I need to accept that I am a little bit evil now. I know that is kinda vauge, but really I don't think any one wants the details as to why I am a little evil.

Oh well, guess I just need to go with the flow. And it's not like I'm a bad person. If anything I am a better person now then before. I mean before I wasn't really good or evil, just sort of there. But now I am mostly good, a little evil, and all the rest is filled in with grey stuff.

In other news my brother is still super cool. Last night we talked on the phone abit, he wanted my opinion on his online work portfolio page thing. Then we just shot the breeze for like 2 hours.

I have also officaly decided on my 2 most favourite things in the world, and the results may surprise you... that is they any one was paying attention.

The final verdict is, I really like playing card games, and listening to music.

Some things that almost made the top two are eating/cooking, video games, hiking/waking, visiting with friends.

In other news my web page is doing great. I never thought I'd be able to stick with it, but it's been 2 weeks sense I started it, and things are only getting better. With the addition of my comic the page looks to be lots of fun to maintain, and should give me lots to do.

Part of me likes to fantasise that this story will become wildly popular and I'll gain some amount of fame from it, perhaps even becoming the next JK Rowling. No doubt that would be cool, but I highly doubt such notariety would ever come my way for anything I write. Which is not to say that I don't beleive in my ability to write. Rather it's what I am interested in writing.

All my life I have been interested in the under dogs, the small cult classics, the oddities. And just as long, I have had little interest in books that win prizes, and are claimed to be deep and enlightening. In my experince I have liked very few of these type of books that I read in school. The only one I liked infact was ""Lord of The Flies""... oh and I also really liked Hamlet.

So because of this I have extreme doubt that anything I would be interested in writing about, is going to gain much (if any) popularity. I just see the world differently, I find myself drawn to the taboo, the horrific, the ideas others fear to ponder. Because of this the ideas that form my story are an attempt to prob the depths of humanity through events many are uncomfortable just saying, let alone give any serious thought about.

The truth about life, I beleive, can best be found in the middle of the most extreme situations. When things happen that are never supposed to happen... of course I can only imagine how people would react to such situations. I can't even acuratly predict how I myself would handle such situations. But I have spent many years carefully watching the habits of people, and have a good understanding of the human mind.

*laughs* of course now that I have gone on the record and said this some one is going to tell me that the characters in my story are not realilistic.

But all I can do is my best.

Another thing I want to do with my story is creat a true evil antagonist for the story, something that goes beyond good and evil.

Oh, and I think the biggest thing I want to do with my story, is that the main characters in the story are no the hero'sof the story. They are just people who are caught up in the events of the story. The hero's fight with the antagonist will simply be background to the evnts of the story. Because lets face it, there have been so many stories about hero's over coming evil, that there is very little left to say about the subject.

Any ways this is all just here-say right now. But soon I'll have some story to go with these words. So if any one is interested in reading a story that isn't about hero's saving the world, but rather just ordinary people living through unbeleivable times, while exploring issues about life and love that many would rather ignore then think about; then this might be worth looking into.

Now even though I doubt any one that doesn't already know me, and there for has my web page address, I'll post my web page address.

www.sunsetdesigns.ca/madworld/surreal.html

Though I should say that there won't be anything to read untill probably Friday or Saturday. Though I will be posting a large amount of story and character info tomorrow to perhaps, intice future readers...

*bursts out laughing*

Man I kill myself... hehehe

Any ways, I have work to do, and The Spider Man movie isn't going to watch it's self.

Later to all,
Jason"

"event","Ok ok, today was such a great day, and I'll tell you why.

Ok so I was in the kitchen fixing something to eat, when this mouse just walks right across the kitchen and starts poking around on the floor just next to my feet. So as I laugh in my head at the apprent stupidity (or extreme guts) of this mouse, I grab a plastic container from the dish rack and quickly trap the mouse with it. Then I put a heavy plate on the container to keep the mouse from getting out, and finished making something to eat (hey I was almost done and I don't like being interupted). So after only 5 - 7 minutes max I look down at the trapped mouse to decide what to do with it, and to my surprise the mouse is laying totaly still on it's side. Now at first I was just thinking it was in shock, but when I lifted the container and had a good look, the thing wasn't breathing any more, it was in fact DEAD! And so it turned out that I had scared the mouse to death. That's right, scared him so bad he DIED! It was awesome! I still can't get over it. Though I can't really take all the credit, I mean that mouse would have probably died no matter who trapped it, but still SCARED IT TO DEATH! YAY!

Now I know many might think of me as evil for taking such joy in this *shrugs* well I ams what I ams, and I happen to be at least a little evil. And really it's not that bad, I mean I was going to kill it any ways, probably would have let our dog eat it, she likes mice, it's fresh meat, YUM!

well that's really all I have to say for now... yah, just the mouse story... man I need to get out more :P"

I am mostly just posting cause it's way late (or way early) and I am so tired I'm getting hyper. I've never figured out why that happens, but it just seems when it comes to staying up late, my second wind always involves me laughing at everything. Though that has calmed down abit as of right now mostly because typing is never very funny.

I was thinking about posting an offical review of Metroid Prime 2 here, but then I thought two things.

Thing 1: I'm not done the game yet and I could probably right a more accurate review when I am done the game.

Thing 2: I honestly don't think any one would read it if I did write it.

"event","The day after is almost never a good thing, no matter what it is in reference to, that just seems to be the conotation attached to the phrase.

But I'm not here to ponder the meaning of words. No I'm just here to report on my birthday.

Another year of my life come and gone, and what a year it was... to think I wasn't even half the person I am now on year ago...

I'm not used to that much change...

Of course I exagerate, the change has not been that big, it just feels like it is.

But big or small, there have been changes and despite that this past birthday didn't have the emotional impact birthdays usualy have on me. That could largely be due to the fact that not much or anything gets me very emotional these days. That an it hardly even seemed like I had a birthday. I mean sure there was cake and candles and all that, but in the end it just felt like another week end with the only things worth noting having nothing to do with my birthday... so it was more like a good week end then a birthday...

*shrugs* oh well.

I am still determined to do something for myself for my birthday, even if it takes me untill next birthday to figure out what I should do.

Oh, and as for news of my life, it seems my summer Job will be at the lumber mill in Drayton. It's not a glamorous job but it pays well and at this point in my life I can't really be too picky about wether or not what I am doing is fun. Some times life means sacrifices, doing things that are kind yuck so that you can get on with life. But the good news is that the pay will be astronomical so I'll be rolling in the money, and sense I need to apply for another student loan any ways I might just be able to get away with spending a thousand dollars or so on my self, just because I haven't done anything greedy, selfish and materialistic for me in a long time.

*thinks*

And on a totaly different note, how stupid does some one have to be to not know they are doing something stupid? That question came to mind when I was watching TV earlier, can't remember why though. It just seems that alot of people like to blame ignorance for the stupid things they do, but if you know it was a stupid thing to do, why did you do it any ways?

Now I am not saying I haven't done my fair share of stupid things in the past, I just wonder why we do it. Though I think the answers are rather obvious, we just like to pretend they are elusive to save face, or at least what little there is left to save.

But yah... the world is a funny place. Just when you think you know people, things change, and just like that your allies are your enemies and you enemies are your strongest supporters...

*shakes his head* At least in the end cards saved the day. Yup, nothing like a few games of cards to make everything turn out ok, and considering we played cards for over 2 hours that one night, things should be awesome... at least for awhile.

But when the shit does hit the fan again, I'll be fine cause I am burried eye brows deep in Metroid Prime 2. So if any one what's me just leave you message in a Space Pirate Computer Terminal and I'll get around to it. It might help if you mark it red.

...

I have this deep feeling that I have some unfinished bussiness... not sure what... just feel like something should have been done that wasn't...

I think the only thing about my birthday that was disapointing was that I never got a chance to get drunk... I miss booze...

but that is not what is bugging me... it's more like... I should be angery or sad or upset or something, but I'm not... it's weird...

Well I don't know, and right now I don't care. I want to sleep in my bed again (gawd I loath sleeping on the coach at my Mom's).

Good night every one, and 2 years bad luck to every one that didn't wish me a happy birthday yet (yes I can do that, I am the master of luck).

Later days, Jason"

Horror Show By Third Eye Blind

 Since i was a little kid I tried to get out of my head
 Trapped on the playground I would stare at the sky...
 I didn't even know why
 But daily life
 It took an evil shape
 Some conformed
 And some tried to escape
 And those are the misfits that i've known
 Like a sock in the eye
 They feel it to the bone
 It's a joke that we all know
 We're the bait in a horror show

 Yeah, we are alone
 In a horror show

 Banish me and mine to outer space
 I'd shoot there in a second
 Just for the breathing space
 I'd put the punks on the moon
 For head-room, mods rule the galaxy
 That's the way
 I think things should be
 The creep in you
 Is the creep in me
 The gravity presses down like a lie
 We want wild sex
 But we don't wan ta die
 Do you feel there's no where to go?
 We're the bait in a horror show

 And we're all alone in a horror show...
 Yeah, we are alone in a horror show

 Ooeewww , if I spoke in words of only hate
 Tell me would you know?
 Could you relate?

 And I, I wish I met Lou Reed
 Woo, out on his darkened sea
 'cause I felt it when his blood would flow
 It doesn't take a thousand years to know
 That ship burned a long time ago
 We're all alone in a horror show

 We're all alone
 We're on... our own
 In a horror show
 Yeah"

"event","There comes a time in every mans life when he must ask himself ""Am I really bisexual?""

Ok this time may not come in every mans life, but lately I have been wondering about myself. As I find myself becoming less like I used to be and more like I am becoming, that blurry line that defines my sexualy has been doing odd things that I am not sure how to interpret.

In the past all my relationships have been with guys, though this is mostly due to the fact that all the woman I have ever been interested in where already with some one, or shut me down.

But lately I have found that what little interest I had in men is waning, and more often then not when I long for some one to be with I think of some one female.

Though I think I may just be over analizing this. I mean in the end it doesn't really matter. I am sure that this will all sort it's self out when the time comes.

And while I am on the subject of hard questions, I still have no idea what I could get myself for a birthday present. What I would really like is a cohort, some one who can be my partner in crime, and I can be their partner in crime. Because lifes just no fun when you have no one to share your missadventures with.

But I am begining to think that finding some one compatible with myself and my life style is going to be harder then I had first thought. And I can imagine why, I mean I'm just like every other guy... well except that I'm not. But you'd think that would help considering that most women are sick of normal guys. Or maybe they just say that to mess with every ones head...

...

Damn it! People confuse me *signs exasperatedly*

Oh well. At the very least I can say that I am at least not broken any more, that's a pretty good birthday present. And now I can go bolding out into the world kick ass as I go.

*shakes his fist at no one in paticular*

This is boring... you're all boring... I'm leaving to go shoot Nazi.

"event","I really do, and if I knew how to make cake that is likely all I would eat ^_^

So I guess it's a good thing I don't know how to make cake.

But these thoughts of cake fill my head because my birthday fast approachs, and for some bizzare reason I am really excited about my birthday.

It was only one month earlier I was so bitter that I was planning to skip my birthday... ah those where the days *gets the look people get on TV when a flash back is going to happen... but it doesn't*

Damn it! I need to get that fixed, haven't had a decent flash back sense I ate that bad tuna sandwich... ah those where the days. *does the flash back thing again... and it doesn't work*

Oh well.

The important thing is that the day when every one that knows me will pretend to care and give me $10 because they have no idea what I like even if they where going to buy me something, and then all stand around and sing happy birthday (badly), and then let me have the first peice of cake as empty symbol of love, and maybe even go a whole day with out reminding me I screwed my life up... ah it's going to be grand.

But I'll don't really care what they think, I just want cake. LOTS OF CAKE!

And all those empty $10 bills will fill my wallet nicely. Perhaps I should fake a disease, then I could get more money... AND MORE CAKE!

*thinks of something* You know, it's kinda silly to think that for one day every one will put their lives on hold just because you where born X years ago on this day. But some people do it any ways, out of tradition mostly.

I think once you're no longer a kid (13+), birthdays (much like halloween anad christmas) just become empty gestures that people do partly because they are used to doing it, and partly so they don't feel guilty for not doing it.

Of course my cynisim of such things will not trully take root untill the day I get money for christmas.

Though that doesn't really bother me, just like my birthday. Cuase money is always good, and I would rather have some money then a gift that was bought at London Drugs on the way over with all the care and thought as you put into which brand of canned corn to buy at the grocery store. Besides birthdays always leave me with a sore feeling inside, like I should have done something with my life by now, but yet again have not. And christmas, well that just the magic of corporate greed and bad parenting for the most part. I will admit that some families do it right, and just use the time of as much needed time to be with their family.

And then halloween... hehehe... I loves it... hehehe... And I think perhap it doesn't really fit in with the other two, cause no matter the age or person, the candy you get is always a sort of empty gesture, just a reflex to seeing small kids in costumes. But no, I like halloween cause it really is a good holiday for all ages. The kids get one night of candy, and then when you grow up you have one night of bizzare drunken partying YAY!

But to get back to what is important, MY BIRTHDAY AND MY CAKE! ALL MINE!
I want to do something specail for myself this birthday, not sure why, but I do. I also don't know what I will do. I won't get alot of opportunity to do something sense my mom is taking me to a movie with my siblings for my birthday, which would have been a nice gesture had I not had to organise the whole thing myself. So with that eating up the better part of my evening all I will have is the morning and late late evening...

*thinks* well I am sure something will come to me to do to me... that sounds dirty... YAY!

Though I think the best thing I can do for myself this birthday is to just not get caught in the usual post-birthday self loathing. Instead I will buy some cake mix with my B-day money and have a big party all by myself. There will be music and dancing and lots of cake... and then I'll CRY!

... well maybe not... maybe not any of it... humm... this is tough, I mean what to you get yourself when you have no money and have already given yourself everything you can... again that sounds dirty hehehe.

Well something is sure to come to me in the next few days up till my birthday.

And before I go, I am reminding everyone (for those that actualy read this) that my webpage will be up either tonight or tomorrow night. And then once they are up I'll start working on and post chapters of my story and pages of my comic thing. But until I do there is other stuff on the page the you may or may not have seen yet, so dispare not loyal readers..... AH HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA loyal readers hahahahaha that's a good one... hehehe I kill me some times...

Well I need to go,, my bladder is making terrorist threats that I can no longer ignore.

"event","No I'm not a mean person, but quite often I find myself wanting to say things that are... perhaps too direct, and overly sardonic. Not that this is a problem for myself personaly, I just find it is getting harder to hold back from talking and acting in this manner toward the people I know, which of course I can not do because peoples feelings tend to get hurt...

*thinks back* Yes, we even made some one cry once... ah good times (by we I mean myself and my cousins, we are the nasty trio of sardonica)

But really, it isn't my fault that every one takes everything so damn personal. I mean it's not like I mean the things I say, well I do mean them, just not as harshly. It's just funner to be extreme. I mean most of the time I could careless about the things I comment on, they just strike me as funny and my sense of humor can be at times sharp-edged. But like I said the point is I never really mean.

*makes a face* Not like I need to explain myself.

Any ways, the reason I can started on all this is cause I found myseld tonight deleting another e-mail I was going to send and got to think how annoying it is to have to censor myself. Now of course I don't HAVE to censor myself, but like I said, for the sake of everyone else precious feelings I usualy keep quite.

Of course I will likely be having rants like this one for years to come as sadly I will soon be losing the few people that I could truly be at ease around with out having to rein in my humor. But such is the transition from youth to adult. Too often does the past break apart, every one going their own direction, as everyone's dreams and goals are different. But I salute those who could keep pace, who where mellow and intellegent enough to just take fun for fun. Yes it will be sad to lose them, but perhaps in the future I can find some one new to laugh at the word with me, and remember a big part of laughing at the world is laughing at your self and each other.

...

yah... mostly I just wish I could yell at a few people right now thought... good natured yelling of course...

*makes another face* You know I'd be nicer if every one tried being smarter. I mean I can't make fun of you if you stop acting like a moron, so there you go. But I guess in the end every one will just have to get used to the more opinionated, boisterous and sardonic me, just remember if I laugh at you, it means I care ^_^ ...

When it's done I'll post the link to it here, and e-mail it to any one that I know doesn't read my journal (which just may end up being every one :P ). Of course the veiwership of my page really doesn't concern me as it's a personal project.

Other then that, and my little rant about feelings (and the stomping there of), I think I good for tonight, and probably the rest of the week. That is unless something really cool happens to me............ hehehehehe like that ever happens.

"event","My thoughts about horror video games, and more specificaly Silent Hill have been resurfacing.

Perhaps it is that halloween has come and gone and I am still semi-filled with the (largely contrived) spirit of halloween. Perhaps it is also that Silent Hill 4 was just released and as such the TV has been showing several things about it.

Either way my thoughts and interest have been turning back to the realms of the evil, the dead, and in some case the Evil Dead (yes that is a purposeful Evil Dead Movie reference). And well I have always felt there is something lacking in horror video games that you just don't find in some of the better horror movies.

It is in my experince that most horror video games follow, at least in part, the formulas of the more Hollywood horror movies. By this I mean: there is a large amount of good and evil judgementalism built into the plot, there is a large amount of gore and grotesque things, the ambience if often excessivly horror show (dark, decrepit), and several other smaller things.

Now just to say now, I have nothing against these styles of horror, infact they are quiet entertaining, but can also grow old through over use.

The other type of horror I think would be nice to see work more into games is ambigious villian with no good or evil alignment, simply a destructive force. Such things I find are oftem more scary because there is no ""good will prevail"" assurance. Also it seems much more of a threat because even evil has things it will not do, lines it can not cross for fear of destroying it's self. And to be very frank I often find the whole good versus evil thing to be very egosentric, that there even is such a thing as good. Perhaps it is just my point of view, but more often then not in most conflicts it is rather lesser evil against greater evil.

But I digress. What I am getting at is that I think a more grey area horror game would be a nice change, where your character isn't really good or evil, just a person doing what people do (save their own ass), fight off an opponent that is niehter good or evil but simply destructive.

Other things that would be nice are, as I said, a break from all the excessive blood and gore. I mean I love cutting off virtual heads and watching virtual blood cover virtual floors, but after a while it just gets to be campy, no matter how it's done. It would be nice to have the game attempt to scare you on a deeper level, to get into your head, to not just cause pure fear but rather to set up situation from which fear naturaly comes. Of course the only example of have of what I mean is in ""Eternal Darkness"". While the game is still very cliched for the most part, there are moments of deeper fear as the game explores the effects of insanity on people. Now I am not talking about the insanity effects. What I mean is depicted well in the games story about Dr. Maximillian Roivas. You see he does not mearly fight off demons and the such, but has to face the fear of his very home become a dangerous place. This slowly evolves a deep fear of being alone and that not only are you not safe, but infact you lost your safety, which can be very troubling.

I would also like to post an example of what I mean by an opponent in the came the is not good or evil but simply destructive. Now I have no games to illistrate this and as such will use the move ""The Ring"" as I feel it best illistrates my point. In the movie at first you are led to beleive that the reason the girls spirit is killing is out of anger and saddness for what was done to her in life. But in the end you find out that she does not care about her past treatment or following murder, and infact being killed has only played to her advantage. She is not mearly evil, but in fact is the embodiement of killing just because one can. She does not care who watchs the tapes, she kills them all, only holding back if some one passes on the curse to some one else, and she does not herself have to worry about retrebution because she does not really exist. And in this you have the makings of something that is truly scary, at least to me.

I think now would be a good time to clear one thing up and that is what I mean when I use the words good and evil, because the intended deffinition of a word is important for context. The dictionary defines good and evil very vaugely and as such many people derive their own meaning for each word. So as for my veiw of the words, good is the quality of being kind, selfless, helpful, working to help others. Where as evil is the quality of being selfish, cruel for the sake of pleasure, mean.
To this end both good and evil have a purpose, something they want to achieve, and because of this they are completely invincible, because as soon as you starting doing things because you want something, you have a weakness. For if you want something you are limit in actions to only doing things that help you get what you want.

Any ways I digress again. Another thing that would be ncie to see is a game that steps outside of the normal settings for horror games. A nice example of this is the recent ""Dawn of the Dead"" movie in which much of the movie is in normal looking city locations during the day, and yet there is still the sense of danger and dread. I think the fear is even amplified because most the average movie going public have been fed the idea that as long as it is day and you are in a nice neibourhood, bad things can't happen, so when all  monsters start attcking people at a down town strip mall in the middle of a sunny summer day it has the affect of shattering their feelings of safety.
Now I do understand why dark places and night are often used in horror. The darkness helps conceal the evil creaturess, and also makes the places seem more closed in and isolated.
But personanly I would be more afriad if the threat happened durring the day because you no longer have the assurance that this will all work it's self out by morning.

One other idea I have for horror in video games that is some what unrelated to my other thoughts, is that is would be nice if the game was not so linear. Now I know horrow games are not the only ones that would benifit from being linear, but I think there are some things that non-linear gameplay that would work especaily well in a horror game.

You see in most all horro games it is all heavily scripted, and at some times the path that you need to take is painfully obvious. This of course flies in the face of one of the key elements of fear, and that is not knowing what is going on, what you can do, and even if you can do anything. To put it in fewer words, the fear of being powerless and lost is one of the strongest forms of fear. So to encorporate this into a game would greatly increase the horror effect. Of course to effectively work in non-linear play into a horror game would need one to largely recontruct the game play of a horror game. But I am 100% certain that if some one could effectively impliment this idea into a horror game you could make a horror experince that would be unparallelled by any game or movie that came before it.

Just imagine, no keys to collect, no conviently place guns and ammo, no cliched horror plot that hold with in it's self the method to stop the evil, no way of escaping to safety or even no remaining safe places. Nothing to do but cling to sanity and defend you life.

Now of course any game designer worth his salt will note that while this is a good idea, there is one, some what large, problem that is inherent in such a game. The problem is that, well, the game needs to have an end right? Now if part of the game is infact that the character you play as can not stop the evil that is threatening it, then how do you decide when the game ends and the player wins.

Now off the top of my head there are a few ways to deal with this that would work.
1. While you are defending yourself, some outside force is working against the evil as well, and it is all just a matter of surviving long enough for them to complete their goal, and perhaps you can aid then as they do.

2. Who says you have to win? This is just an implied thing in all games, that there is a way for the player to ""win"". What if instead you simply keep playing untill eventualy one of the situation in the game kills you. Now of course the problem with this is that while it would be interesting at first, I would imangine it would lose appeal quickly as players almost by nature require something to mark their progress by. So that if now matter what they do, eventualy in the end the game will kill, might turn alot of gamers off.

My self personaly would go for the first idea. This gives you a very open roll in the game as a player. You can either hide out for the duration of the game, and in doing so miss all of the events (and fun). Or you could go out and simply destroy as many monsters as you can while staying alive. Or you could aid the NPCs. Or if you even if you felt like it you could destroy the friendly NPCs and in doing so doom the world of the game. There are so many opptions, and if done properly, with a good story and game world, this could be a very rewarding, and scary game experince. And it would very accurately emulate what it would be like to be in this kind of situation. That no matter what you do, other things are going on around you all the time, and your cooperation is not a requisit to experince the game world.

In fact you know what, all this talk has inspired me. I have a most delicious game idea brewing in my brainium.

*laughs evily*
I think I may have just come up with something brilliant. I must begin developement at once!

*he then looks around suspiciously* And no one better not steal this idea, cause it's mine! ALL MINE!

"event","So today it would seem that I am very energetic which is nice, but at the same time kinda sad cause all this possitive energy and nothing to do, well I have lots of things to do, but their all just sitting at my computer working things. I want get out and be busy and active and have fun with friend things.

*makes a face then laughs* oh well soon enough, soon enough and I will be off to Burnaby to embrace my destiny... AND BECOME SUPERMAN!

*laughs again* Seriously though, going to the Art Institute is going to kick ass! I mean finaly I will be among my people, fellow game designers. Just thinking about it is enough to make me hyperventalate! WOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

*cranks his music so that it's loud enough to feel in his teeth* Today is a good day, yes indeed. And more so it is a good day in a whole string of good days. And with each one I grew stonger, my power returning from deep hybernation, looking for something to do, craving action. I know that tonight I will likely have to take a long walk or else I'll never get to sleep.

It's times like this that I feel I could take on the whole world, that is if I wanted to *laughs* I'd much rather just get some candy and go missadventuring instead though, cause life is too much fun to waste worrying. All the difficult parts of life shrink away, and the very fabric or reality warps around me. In a way fart beyond any physical sense I am free. And as reality warps I become greater then the sum of my parts, with every part of me charged with energy to the point of glowing. My mind races so fast that I no longer feel it thinking, as all it's proccess blur together into something all together different...

*takes a deep breath as he gets abit dizy feeling the familar feeling of floating in a void, with out any physical body*
I don't know what happens when I feel this way, but my visions blurs, and in extreme cases blacks out abit. And I lose all sense of physical contact from my body, so that I don't just not feel the chair and desk, but I don't even feel my body. And I feel like I am floating, as if in zero gravity or deep under water, with down and up losing all meaning. To say it is a disorenting feeling is an understatement, but as much as it scares me I enjoy it, which fits well with the duality of my nature, the Oxymoron state as I have called it previously.

Of course all this flies in the face of all I know and beleive in, well not all of it but alot of it. One would think that if I feel so amny odd things I would be more open to the more peranormal side of life, but after previous experinces with such things I have come back more sceptic, and yet still interested. So to say that I don't beleive in the peranormal is not really accurate. I beleive it is possible, but I don't actualy beleive in any of the specific peranormal occurences.

But I have gone on talking more then I really should. I am very busy today, and I plan to put this energy to good use to get as much done as I can.

Later days, Jason"

...

... if your still here I'll just pretend you have already gone and voted. Oh and if you live in the states Ohio, or Florida, try not to cause to much trouble *winks suppicously*

You know for me, this election is like an early christmas... except I won't get any presents... ok just never mind. But it's funny that it woulc be a US election that would get me interested in Politics, though I still don't think I'll be voting in Canada any time soon hehehe.

One good thing to come out of all this though is I have now fully accepted my lack of caring for the world around me, yup, I just don't care. Of course this does not mean I activily try to make things worse, no that would just be mean. Lets just say I have no emotional investment in the future, or the present for that matter...

*smiles and thinks*

Perhaps it is selfish to live like this, but I just don't feel the global comradery that most do, nor do I feel every much local comradery either now that I think about it.

I just look at it like here is earth O-----------------------> and here is me... or maybe think of it like this, I physicaly exist on Earth that is true, and physical I am human, but in general this physical connection only serves as an anchor for the less tangible aspects of myself.

Of course this explanation doesn't even make alot of sense to me as I don't beleive in alot of the things I need to explain how I feel *laughs at that* Only me, only I could find myself in such a situation hehehe, the great Oxymoron Jason.

You know, understanding and embracing my oxymoron state was the greatest advancement I have made in my personal life. Of course to fully understand it will take years, and I will need to aquire a great deal more information too.

But untill then I will just have to be content with the thought that I will at times act a certain way that requires a certain beleif that I don't currently beleive in... and you know that works for me. I enjoy the uncertainty and choas in an odd way. And in the end I know who I am and what I stand for, so everything else can be all fussy and unexplained, cause no matter what I learn in the future or what happens, I'm never going to stop being me... and I think that is what gives me the peace and state of mind to live in the middle of a vortex of unknowns and randoms. No matter what the world around me turns out to be, I will always be the same.

Of course it also helps that the things that I know I am are for the most part helpful and positive character traits, then again depending on how you handle yourself, most all character traits can be positive or negative, and it is through this process that the seven deadly sins and the seven(#?) cardinal virtues swap places all the time in our world.

Well I should get going, I have food to prepare and eat and some more forms to fill out ( I despise forms ).

Well nothing I really want to say to any of you any ways ^_~

But I was online anyways doing some ""important"" stuff and figured I'd say something so that everyone knows I am still alive.

As far as news there is nothing much to report. The only big thing is that my interest for going to the art institute has been coming and going lately, and some times I think it might be better to just go to NAIT and drop all this gaming nonesense all together, but then I watch a game review on TV and go into Anaphylactic shock over how retard it is and decide that my good ideas and mean spirited nature are need to get people in the industry thinking again...

But then maybe that is all just a bad delussion of grander.

Either way halloween fast approachs and the TV stations are playing tones of horror shows and related shows. I even watched a show on the real story behind the Salem Witch Trials, as in what was really wrong with the people that where claiming to be cursed by witchs, turns out it was propably just one big bad acid trip for the lot of them, hehehehe and I am not joking.

In other news I watch this great movie earlier today. It was called ""My Dog Vincent"" and it was great. I won't say anything about it other then all should go rent it. To help out it will like me in drama, or maybe comedy, but it was likely only funny to me.

Well I should go now, Star Trek: First Contact is going to be coming on TV soon and I want to watch it, and I still need to down load a whole slew of disturbing images from [ http://zed.cbc.ca/action.ZeD?POS=9&action=watch&CONTENT_ID=52339&type=acquisitionCMS&FILTER_KEY=290616 ]. This girls art work rocks and also scares the crap out of me, I highly recommend it.

Oh wait just 2 quick questions before I run off.
1. What does every one really think about ghost and spirits and the after life? It's a converstation I never really had with any one before and am interests.

2. If you are American, who are you going to vote for next week? And if you say Bush I cry, I swear I will, I cry and then I'll murder a small animal in protest. That's right murder a small animal! Screw peaceful protesting! AAAAAAAAAAAAARGH! For just one day I want to be american just so I can vote for Carey (or however you spell his name).

Any ways, good night and becareful cause I hear tell that right now is the time between the old year and the new year and the after life gets real cosey with the pysical world and if your not careful you could get your fool ass stuck in the after life... not that I care or beleive in that, but then again I am a jaded cynic so what do I know,

Alas all my drinking compatriots are out of reach.

But even if I can not toast my victory with a bottle of vodka I can still gloat about it. Oh that's right, say good bye to the usual modest me, for I AM THE WINNER!

And just think with all of my Illistrator playing, Photoshop playing, and newly accuired Dreamweaver playing, well Flash just fits so well.

In other news I am really starting to realise how much of a socialigist I am at heart, well socialigist/philosipher. It really hit me today when I ended up watching a documentary about something that normaly would not interest me at all and was in fact getting right into it. I mean I have always found humans to be very interesting animals to study, but I never thought it would go beyond just an interest. Of course along with an increase in my interest in social issues I have noted an increase in my need to think philsophicaly as well. Which sucks actualy because of my lack of discuss companions. Not that having no one to talk to has ever stopped me before ^_^. No, I just talk to myself instead, though it is not very satisfing as I rarely put up decent arguments to the things I say *laughs* But yay split personality any ways!

All in all I am mostly just putting an entry in today because of my deep rooted instinct to do so, not that I really have much to say. I guess my journal was just looking a little put off with not being update in so long.

"event","MY TIME HAS COME! *evil laughter*

Years ago my dreams where smashed when I was unable to afford to attend school at CDIS. But now several years later, my life in subdued crisis the answer has come.

You see recently CDIS was bought out by the Art Institute of BC because thery afford better courses in specailized areas. So now with CDIS under new control it would seem that things are changing. One of the many changes is that they have found that the two seperate game courses where not enough apart, so they have combined them. Which means I can now afford to go there because I will only need to pay for one course instead of two.

and so to reiterate, MY TIME HAS COME! BWA HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!

*runs around in tight circles untill he gets dizzy and falls over*

Untill now I had explored all other options to getting to where I need to be and all have come up dry, but now, NOW! It's has all come together!

With renewed hope I can feel long lost energies and ambitions flowing back into me like water flows over a small village that lays just bellow a massive dam.

If only I knew that all I had to do was wait for the right time, but then much of the advice I recieved to this point was contrary to that. But it would seem I was right, now if only I knew this before all those misadventures of mine. But then again I do not regret my past life, even if it has severly weakened my finacial situation. I would not take back all that time because I met so many great people.

But then I guess that is how life goes, you really can tell what is going to happen next, so you just have to get out there and do you best and try not to lose your mind and keep looking for what you need and sooner or later you will find it, (wowo I feel like an after school specail)  and in my experience it always seems to come right at the end when you think there is nothing left you can do but give up and just accept a mediocre life. Like Jesus in the desert when God was testing him, I have survived my trials and am now award what I seek... not that I am comparing myself directly to Jesus, just his situation... hehehe I mean really Jesus and I are so not ther same. I mean if I could turn water into wine I would be so drunk right now hehehehe...

Any ways I need to go, my Web Page work calls and then... PARTY! WOOOO!... damn, this makes me wish I could have a party. It would seem approprait though that when I finaly get my day, I would be alone, but that won't dull the party any. I shall have spagetti and meat saunce untill I puke, and then! ...well I can't really have any drinks... damn my self imposed rule to never ever again drink alone. Oh well.

Well, time to get gone and get going.

"event","I was thinking of posting the lyrics to Next Time by BNL, but you know no one ever realy wants to read them, so instead I am just posting that part that best reflects my mood...

When you die they make a list,
Of every love you never kissed.
Of each regret and each mistake,
Every choice you failed to make.

Oh well, oh well...

It's a shame I have to wait until the ending,
Everything I've yet to break is surely bending,
Every vow I ever take is just pretending,
That this mess I make is worth defending.

*takes a deep breath*

They say life never goes as you plan, so true...

...I'd like to say that I am not bitter or angery... but... this is just too frustrating to stand...

heh, I'd keep going, but I think any one that might read this know where this is going and would rather not hear about it again...

I thought even I had out run my old self... but with no where to run to that didn't really work well. But it's not all for not. I have all but conquered my depression and now really only have intermited spells of bleakness, which is a considerable improvement over daily battles with my will to live.

It's seems though, that the hardest part of my new life is that nearly everything I know about how to live is wrong. I grew up niave and self isolated... and even though my childhood very likely made my intelegince what it is today, my near total lack of life skills was not what could be called a good trade off...
*sighs* and this is one of the great problems of life. To have one thing is always to forsake another... *makes a face*

And I really can't say which I would rather have. I have become so dependent on my ability to thinking quickly and deeply that it is hard to imagine life with a simpler mind... sometimes I think it might be better... no, not better, just easier, if I was like my high school class mates. Another one of the crowed. Then I would be well versued in life skills, be confident and emotionaly strong.

*laughs* But of course wish for such things is only a pleasent dream, reality requires a more direct and litteral solution. So I have to make what I have work.

All I know for sure is that some where along the way I stopped being me and just starting being what ever worked best. That combined with all my harmfuly niave highschool years makes for a hefty plate of personal issues. But as I stated before I have over come my depression, but it'll take alot more work to get to a point where I can claim to be stable... and some nights I fear that some of my issues will be impossible to solve on my own. I only fear this because in my life right now that only person I can count on is myself...

*sighs and shakes his head* I feel so ashamed to be living such a trite and tragic catch-22 life... but in a sense it is fitting justice that I should have to endure the very situation I once mocked and parody, beleiving myself to be infalible and infinitely distanced from such a situation...

But it is said that difficulty is needed to build character... *laughs* and I should think I'll have character enough for several people once all is said and done...

...

A rather sobering event happen a few weeks back that has been riding at the back of my mind. My great grandmother died. Her death was not more then indirectly sad for me as I never really knew her. I was sad that she died, but not sad for any real lose. But it was not the sadness of lose that hit me the hardest, infact it was it's absence that did. You see in the days after the funeral I got to think what it will be ike when I am dead, who will be around to mourn, will it be comprised of so many people attending only for decencies sake... death is the thing I fear most in life. I fear running out of time, I fear not knowing how it will end, or not knowing what comes next... and well there was just something about my greatgrandmother living and dieing like that, a whole life concluded in an instant, and then just a cold body and a bad funeral... is that all that life is... so much, and then just Game Over, thanks for playing... and how much wieght does any one persons actions carry? In the end will you only be remember for what you did, with who you where dieing with you... that is all assuming you did anything that will be remember...

I mean I am now 20, soon to be 21. This is 1/5 of my life expectancy gone bye bye, and I am only now getting my life started... it's upseting to think that I could let this happen, but when life comes one day at a time it is easy to let things go unnotice for so long. Just as your hair grows too slow to watch, but will sure enough grow into excess if not maintained, an average persons life advances at a pace that is unnoticeable untill several years down that road they have lost who they where and forgotten the meaning that started them going so long ago...

*stares out at the night sky* So many thoughts in my head... too many actualy... like always...

*then laughs thinking* and yet with this constant uncertainty and thought driving and undoing me simulteaniously, on the odd occaisson that my mind does seem to quiet and pause it is quiet frightening... like losing all the small back ground noises you grow so accustomed to all at once... it is a silence almost louder then any noise could ever be.

... I just wish though that I had something to do with these thoughts. For now I try my best to keep myself on track and at the task at hand... but so much of my life is empty now... it really is amazing how large a whole losing a close friend can leave in your life. Which is not to say I have lost any of my friends, but every one has moved on life to different places for different reasons, as such things go... and all this leads me back to the one thought and wish that has prevaild through all my life, that I could find some one to take with me in life, so that when I have to leave I don't have to be alone again...

... I can't count the number of friends I have lost in this manner on one hand, perhaps not even on both...

*sighs* but sadly circumstances can not be helped, I jalways wish though that there was more I could do to keep my friends, but of my few skills and meager resources I am often little help at all...

I have always thought that the greatest thing I could achive would be to help some one through life, not just offer moral support and kind words, but to really be there in all aspects... for trully the only thing really worth doing is helping the lives of others... but damned if it's not hard enough just helping myself most of the time... which I know is the reason few have ever really realied on me for any form of support... and I don't know which hurts worse, that my help is often not request, or that this happens because I trully can not be relied on...

But such thoughts are only wallowing in self pity which has already stolen away too much of my life as it is. But is suppose on a night like this, with sleep all bu in possible and tommorw bearying no importance, I can induldge myself and just let go abit... after all it is far to hard being strong all the time...

on that note I think the hardest part about making my life work right now is that I do it with out any substantial purpose. All the time I work and push myself and am strongly only for myself... which is hard for me because my life does not feel very really when I am doing things only for myself by myself...

I am not ashamed to admit that I need companionship, that in fact the company and love of others is my only driving goal. All things else in life are just a means so that I might be able to spend more time with friends. Perhaps I am overly dependent on others, but I spent the first 15 years of my life very much alone, and so I have seen very clearly the depeths of solidtude, and perhaps that is what drives me to be with others so strongly.
But there is something else... even though I can do things and live me life indepently quiet well, everything just seems better when there is some one to share it with. Every moment seems more alive, more real...

...and that idea has always gone hand in hand with a very disterbing thought that is often prodominent in my mind. You see over the years I have always felt that I myself, and infact my very physical existance, carries less weight then it should. To give a good metaphor, it is like walking in snow, you leave foot prints and other marks in the snow, signs that clearly show that you have been here and have done something. But I feel that some how I am often too light to leave substantial marks in the metaphorical snow, that some how everything I do vanishes into the flow of time much faster and easier. I have never really know where this idea came from or why it seems to fit so well in my mind, but it is why I always rather be with others then alone. That some how simply being in proximity with others might help make my existance more real... well it's more then just being in proximity, no it's more personal then that, there is a certain conection needed as well...

*thinks of something he heard once on TV* It is as though ever persons life is their own TV show where they are the star, but for me I have noe show of my own, and so I only exist when I ""make guest appearances"" in other peoples shows(lives)...

but... no matter how you say it, this feeling of being very detact from the world around me, and some how not as real as every one else, has been with me a long time in one form or another and no matter what I have done in life it seems impossible to shake...

*rests his head on his desk a moment* and in the end everything here has been said before... same thoughts in perhaps different words... with no way of really knowing what of it is truth and what is simply self manufactured delusion... so hard to so ones own true self it is...

*chuckles softly thing thinking* but I think I have long sense past my maximum allowable amount of writing for one entry.

Well to any one that might have read this far, thanks for listening and putting up with my rambling.

Good night, or sense the sun is now rising, good morning

Of course it was then that I realised I had been talking to myself for several hours while laying on the floor higher then a kite while listing to old U2 albums. It was in a way, a pleasent moment but short. Yes that short second between drug induced inner peace and reality.

But that is not so much important any more as all fuzzyness has long given way to long ignored hunger and a slight chill... and hours of interent dibauchery (hope I spelled that right).

And here I sit, comtemplating life, my future, my lost hopes and dreams. Any one who knows me well knows I think too much, it's my greatest fault... *laughs* and is also my greatest strength. How you ask. Well on one hand I tend to over think small thinks and make a larger ant hill out of a much smaller ant hill. On the other hand my constant access to high speed thought processing has saved my ass more times that I care to count. So it is as all things about me, an uncertain but fairly even matching of pros and cons.

In other News Jon (can spell his last name) kicked Bush's ass in the debate today, it was fun to watch, not that I expected any less from Bush, but Jon was surprisingly with it for the debate. His usual vaugeness and wordyness for the most part was gone, and he really cleared up his positions on all the discussed topics. In general, this is the first ray of hope in the fight to keep Bush from a second term. Now you may wonder why I would care about an american election given that I am canadian, well you see canadian elections don't really interest me, there is to much stupid fighting in the parlement, and none of them really do anything other then fuck up any ways, so I don't see the need to think about it for now. But the US election, well it has been said by many political analists as the most important election our generation.

So naturaly being the politicaly minded person I am *sifles a laugh* I am interested to see how things turn out. This way I know if I should sigh with relief of shudder in horror.

*shivers* is it cold in here or is it just me?

But it would seem it is that time of year again, every one is back in school. The temperature drops daily... and... and... I have lost my train of thought. Well not so much lost, as Kegel stole it from me... damn your humour and the sexy body of Argus, DAMN YOU!

Well I should go, I was planing on saying some insightful and intelegent things tonight, but it seems my lack of sleep is finaly eating at my grey matter... my poor poor pants... DEMO'S DONE *vanishes in a cartoonish puff to go check out the freshly downloaded Gish game demo*"

"event","So I have decided that the movie ""Donnie Darko"" holds the meaning to life, and now that I am officaly obsessed with the movie I must now buy it and watch it several times to fully unravel all that it holds with in. I very much so wish I could talk with the people who wrote and worked on it to see why they did the things they did in the movie.

It's odd though, normaly I never get this into movies (or books for that matter), but DD just draws me in and leaves me asking new questions every time I watch it while answering old ones.

At times it is almost to much when I start to think about it, all that there could be hidden with in the movie. And given that I just now relised the possibility that the movie might be metaphorical (don't ask why it took me this long to think that) it just opens the whole thing up anew... yes there us much thinking to be done.

But still, from what little I have gather from this master peice movie, I still stand firm that this movie holds the knowledge of the meaning of life. Some of it may not be direct, so the movie is more of a Rosetta Stone for life then an full bible.

This is one movie that I realy wish there was a book too so that I could read it endlessly.

*laughs thinking* but knowing me I won't really get too into it. My personality doesn't allow me to get caught up in silly obsessions, so I am not at all worried about losing my life to DD. But still, I recommend this movie to all who have not watched it, and for those who have I say, watch it again.

Well I need to go finishing baking buns (yes I am batchelor that can actualy cook many things well, shocking!).

"event","So I was thinking just now, as I sit here in the middle of another Crisis Watch. I was thinking about all those people who work really hard in high school and university, and are always like really nice to the teachers and profs but no fun to be with, and always do a shit load of community service, and have had a part time job in ever work environment. I know every one knows some one like this, they are hard to miss, mostly because they think they are hot stuff. And I don't have a problem with them doing all this stuff, but it's their attitude that makes me want to beat them into a coma. I mean just because they have devoted their lives to this insan quest for greatness that may or may not mean anything in their years to come, doen't make them better then people like myself and my friends who only past high school with an average grade, who dropped out of college (or never went), who never did a day of volunteering and never plan to.

The richness of a person's life can not be measured by your resume. I myself have every little worth mentioning on my resume, but that doesn't mean I haven't led a good life and that I am not as good as those who do have a thick resume.

I mean maybe I would have a bigger resume if I didn't have to spent so much time taking care of my younger siblings for my single mother who has had a single day of rest for years with her trying to make a good life for us. Or maybe I woudl have a bigger resume if I didn't spend so much time with my friends helping them with problems big and small in their life. Or perhaps it was all that time I spent doing artistic work (writing and drawing), maybe that time should have been spent flipping burgers for $6 an hour.

I don't regret what I have done in life, and just because it doesn't look good on a resume doesn't mean a thing. Besides the most succesful person I know among my peers never even went to college let alone did all that other crap. And he still has time to go hang out at the bar and have fun. And just think in a few more years while your all in university still he'll be the head of the place he works at, not because he did all that meaningless crap, but because he is a damn hard worker and a good person.

Any ways I am done now... that actualy ended up being longer then I had thought it would, oh well.

*gurgles and sits back in his chair* I feel abit bad though for writing this. Not because I don't agree with what I said or how I said it, but because I should be doing something more worth while with my time.

*makes a face* But alas I am living in limbo right now, nothing going wrong or right. I won't be here long, but when you have more free time then work, and no human contact for a few months, well time seems to stretch considerably.

But I must bide my time for now untill the time to strike comes around, which is sadly half a year from now, but once it is here I will strike, and in one fell swoop be back in the thick of life again. And you know I am glad I had this time alone. I may complain about the lonelyness daily, but in the end it has helped. For through the long empty days I learned alot about myself, and I think I have finaly found the answers I have need and am at peace with myself. Which is quite remarkable considering that only 4 or 5 months ago I was in a mental hospital (long story). But it's strange and amazing what a few months vacation from life in general can do for a person.

Well I should go now, I have things to take care of, and later sleeping to do.
So good night, and if all else fails start kicking ass
Jason Out"

WHOOO!

I am reaching whole new levels of monotiny, and also WHOO I just finished my first web design job. Though it was pro-bono which is kinda crappy but it was for family so it's all good. And it's not like I need much money right now any ways.

You know what's sad though, the high light of my week has been the swelling in my hand from my hornet bite.... hehehehe so puffy hehehehehe

In other more sane news I am considering for now totaly ditching my game design efforts and in their place perssuing some very tasting writing and graphic novel ideas. Also there are severl advantages to doing these two projects in place of games, easier, don't need programing, faster results, more outsider interests. Now of course when I say more out side interest that is just projected interest based on previous experince, but thigns are looking good. And with the soon to be birht of my personal web page it will all be easily excessible to every one. YAY!

Now if you will excuse me I need to shot of my head as it will be the easiest way to quell this ehad ache that I have only been making worse so far.

Well that's it for me for now *falls over out fo his chair*

GOOD NIGHT!"

"event","Well it is 12:30am and I am up late as usual working on Mad World. As it stands I should be able to upload it tomorrow, but that means I have to get everything mostly done tonight because I want to devote tomorrow to getting the skeletal part of Secret Earth done so I can start writing as soon as the page is complete. All of this will be hard as I battle my newly acquired Turok addiction. I tell you that game is actualy pretty sweet. A nice mix of stealth and total crazy killing.

*makes a face* yucky, I have a head ache *leans back in his chair* stupid cold, oh well it's nearly gone.

... *remembers his Ketchup Potatoe Chips and wonders if he should attempt to watch the Dune mini-series tonight*

Nah... I need to get Mad World done quickly before I get more really web page work to do... though I could really use the money ^_^;;

Oh well, win some lose some.
Either way I am checking out for now.

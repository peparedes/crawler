LOS ANGELES - A three-day sting operation targeting foreign nationals who prey on children has resulted in 25 arrests in the Los Angeles area, federal authorities said.

[b]All of the suspects have prior convictions for sex offenses, and four of them have previously been deported from the country, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials announced Thursday.[/b]

Eleven of the suspects were found to be living in the country illegally. The other 14 were legal permanent residents but face deportation for their criminal convictions.

""These pedophiles pose a serious threat to the well-being of our children, our families and our communities,"" said Robert Schoch, special agent-in-charge for the ICE office of investigations in Los Angeles, said in a statement. ""We can not only take them off the streets, but we can seek to have them sent out of the country.""

Among those arrested was Jose Angel Pakas-Murcia, 46, a Honduran national who was deported in 1995 after serving time for sexually assaulting a 9-year-old girl in Florida. He faces prosecution for re-entering the United States after deportation - a felony that carries up to 20 years in prison.

Gabino Chavez-Rosales, a 43-year-old Mexican national with a prior conviction for lewd acts with a minor, also was arrested on suspicion of attempting to kidnap a girl playing in a laundromat parking lot. The Glendale resident faces deportation.

Also taken into custody was Jose Luis Rodriguez-Lucatero, 41, who entered the country illegally from Mexico after his conviction for the attempted rape of a 15-year-old girl.

The arrests are the latest to be announced as part of Operation Predator. Since July 2003, the program has led to the arrest of more than 8,200 sex offenders nationwide, including 1,100 in the Los Angeles area.

[i]ALL of these people have been convicted and 4 previously deported.  WHY were they let back INTO the country???[/i]

"event","They gathered around the fire.  What had been a friendly argument had escalated into something more.    They'd been wandering for years, had accumulated knowledge, and managed to put away some gold as well.  

The debate got heated, with both sides demanding they were in the right.  Some wanted to continue, some wanted to stay here.  It was finally Alexander that put a halt to the fighting.  ""Here we shall stay.""  He pointed to the east. "" There, a river.  It will provide fresh water for us.""  He pointed again, this time to the northwest and to the south.  ""Hills, we can dig into the earth , get metals to build more.""  He lifted his bronze sword.  ""If there is bronze, there must be more metals as well.  Better, stronger, and they'll help us build our cities and weapons to defend ourselves, and to attack if need be.

The others went silent, nodding.  their leader had made valid points, enough of them to sway all but those who  were the most determined to press on.  ""Tonight, we sleep under the stars as we have for ages.  Tomorrow, we build...

Late that afternoon, some of the peasants returned from the fields excitedly.   ""Alex, there are spices to the southwest!  We can use them for our people!  They will be happy!""  Alexander nodded.  They will do good for the beginning, but people will still become unhappy.   ""He motioned towards Heros' tent.  He was one of the few that did not want to settle here.  With our first garrison built, I have decided that we will build an expedition.  We'll expand.  If there are these ""spices"" as you say, there are more resources out there, other things we can use to make our people happy, and possibly other resources as well.  It will take time to put together this expedition, but it will be worth it.  Heros thinks that running a city is so easy? We'll give him what he needs, and let him wander to find his own home and his own lands, and we'll see how he does..."""

"event","In the section on Interests, I put ""Computer Games"" in.  First and foremost, what I've played is the ""Civilization"" series.  Going all the way back to Civ 1 and on the PC at work and going over to a friend's who had it where we'd strategize and plot for hours how to torch the Zulus and Aztecs through Civ 2 with the diagonal tileset then on to Civ III with culture, resources, leaders and the like, it's been my favorite game series of anything I've ever played.

I do have Civ 4, unfortunately on this computer it's running slow and buggy due to me needing an upgrade, but I'm happy sticking with Civ 3.

The story of Alexander of the Greeks is from an ongoing game of Civ 3, where I'll be playing 20 turns at a time then updating it here.  I'm hoping it will be done every day, but sometimes it might miss a day or two, but don't worry.. I'll update frequently and make up for missed days when I can.


With that said, we're off..."

The possibility exists once some of my other stories get up and going to have more than just myself posting and doing the writing, with one (at least in mind now) and maybe more contributing to an interactive story.

I know this has been done elsewhere with success, and interested in trying it here, and maybe migrating it elsewhere if it takes off.

But that's to be determined.  What other projects you ask?  Here's the list:

The Infrared house
Sutter's Tale (name to be determined)

Ghost Ride
The Mad Doctor

... each will  be done bit by bit, a chapter here, a few paragraphs there, sometimes out of order, but I'll try to avoid that but will make it clear when I'm backtracking.

So Enjoy!!!"

"event","You want to go in, and find out what's inside, but it's just too creepy.  there's something about the house, but you can't figure out what it is.  You think you see movement behind one of the curtains.  

Is someone home?  Is it a waiting family pet wondering where the owner is? Is it your imagination? You've gone by this house many times, wondered what was inside, but you've never seen any one coming, going, or even in the yard.  You think you've seen someone at the windows before, but they've always disappeared before, faded from view.  Not this time.  They're still watching you.

It's a relatively normal house, except for the creepiness factor of it.  Every neighborhood has a house like this one: the one all the kids stay away from, even on Halloween.  It's the ones parents warn their children about, just as yours have warned you.  It's a gorgeous day though, what evil could happen on such a nice day?  You take a look up and down the street to see if anyone else is around.  You'd hate to hear the talk and the looks from thge neighbors, how you'd gone to the ""House that was off limits.""  Even though it's early afternoon in a bustling neighborhood, there's no one around.  You decide why not, you'll just walk through the gate, up to the sidewalk, knock on the door, and say ""Hello, I just thought I'd stop by and see how things were.""  You open the gate, walk through, and close it behind you.

You suddenly feel you're in another place, sure that you are, but unsure how that can be.  You'd seen the yard from the street many times, and that it was always well taken care of and manicured, mulched and edged, but you'd never seen it worked by anyone during the day, nor heard anyone running equipment during the night.  The sidewalk is also clean, and has the look of fresh cement, even though for years nobody has seemingly set foot in this place.  

As you approach the porch,. flowers adorn boxes at the sides of the porch.  The blooms are familiar but unidentifiable.  You take a deep breath, almost tasting the aroma.  It is an odd mix, the scent of fresh cut flowers combined with smell of those that have been in the vase way too long.  You pause for a step, unsure whether you want to go on or not.  Suddenly you know that you want to turn and go back, that this is just too strange, too eerie, but you can't.  You've come this far, and you have to press on.  You've gone into the yard, past the point of no return.  It's too late to cave in now.  

You reach out, take the handle for the screen door, opening it.  The black metal handle is cool to the touch, strange for this time of year, but not so strange considering that the porch itself is in the shade.  Another inconsistency, along with the well groomed yard and the aroma of the blooms.  You knock on the door, Tap, tap, TAP, tap.  There's no answer.  You knock again a little bit louder, but still no response.  Someone had been in the window, you're sure of it, where could they be?  Probably not out the back door, since you'd have heard them. You wait a moment, and knock again, this time a little bit louder, Tap, tap, TAP, TAP, tap, tap.  Strange, but nobody's answering.  You decide to try the handle.  You turn it, but it's locked.  A sudden sense of relief comes over you.  You don't know what might have happened if it had been unlocked.  You try again, just to be able to tell yourself that you honestly did try to see if everything was alright, to absolve yourself of blame should something be wrong in the house.

This time it opens."

From a friend to a friend:
  There are no words to describe, i've left my smile behind. a ribbon tied around the wound: you're safe from bleeding today. a fashion statement so confused, but they won't notice either way. you're right im wrong there's a consistant key to this melody. when the sun is out the stars still shine, from a friend to friend, keep shining. you dance for them, for them you dance so beautiful."

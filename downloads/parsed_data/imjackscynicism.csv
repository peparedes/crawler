"event","So, I know that my posts lately (when I do post), have been very whiny, emo, bitchy, depressing, etc (or whatever other word comes to mind for yall). I know I've been down or whatever lately, but yesterday I made up my mind to let things go and move on. Before this, although I wouldn't have admitted it, I wasn't letting myself let go; I was making a conscious effort to hang on to things that weren't there anymore. Not anymore. I've realised that I have to cut my losses. Yeah, things suck sometimes, but I can't let that get me down and keep me down. I'm deciding right here and now to quit all the things and people that cause me unnecessary pain and stress. I know that certain things and relationships are supposed to be stressful or difficult, but those things are *worth* it. I'm not talking about the latter. I don't need to focus on the people and things that don't deserve my attention. I need to let go of the bad things, and fix the mistakes that I have allowed myself to make this past semester. Maybe this isn't the right way to go about it, but here it is. I'm saying good-bye to all the things this past semester that have caused me to lose focus. 

Tyler, I won't do this anymore. You don't deserve me. I suppose I hate the way things turned out between us, but ya know what? I accept it. You can play your game if you want, but it won't be with me. I didn't come with dice, so don't play me. I'll talk to you occasionally, but anything more than that, you don't deserve. 

Travis, you obviously don't respect me, and that's fine. My only request is that you be upfront with it. Don't insult me by pretending to care and respect me as a friend. Give me fair warning so I have time to ready myself with a new and clever way to tell you to go fuck yourself. 

Dominic, I looked at you like a brother, and I was sad that you were moving. But you promptly fucked that up by telling someone something that wasn't true. I know that may be juvenile to be upset about that, but you had no right to say the things that you said. 

Late semester I really messed up. I wasn't focused, and I made more than my share of bad decisions. Instead of wallowing in self-pity, I'm choosing to do my best to right my wrongs. I'm not going to allow myself to wake up late, skip class, and just generally have a lax attitude about school. I have to completely change the kind of student that I was to the kind of student that I know I can be.

I quit. Not in the whiny way that I've mentioned before. I'm quitting in the way that you would quit smoking. I'm quitting the things that I know are bad for me. I'm not allowing myself to be dragged down. I'm freeing myself from the negatives."

"event","I'm not quite sure how I want to start this entry, but I guess it's too late now; I've already started it.  Let me first start by saying how much I really love you guys. If you can read this (which, no worries, all of you can. No one was excluded. :-)), I'm talking to you. Being at Sam has made me realize what great friends I have. I've met some friends here, and they're all well and good, but they're not you guys. Erin, I'm almost jealous that you have found such a great set of friends up at Tech, but I know that they are now my friends too. For that I am grateful. I'm proud of you and your friends (this actually goes for all of you, except Tram-I'm proud of you, I just think some of your friends are bags of douche. They're mostly Karens- I hope you get that reference :-)). I have good friends at Sam, but I still feel a bit out of place. I keep bouncing from one group of friends to the next depending on the guy that I'm talking to or have moved on from. It's a stupid thing to do, I know.

Next semester, I've made the decision to do better, to be more focused. As I told Nadja tonight, ""Screw boys next semester, bro. I just gotta learn!"" I have really let myself slip this semester, and it can't happen again. I'm gonna have to work my butt off to get my GPA to where it needs to be, but if I work hard enough, I'll make it happen. It won't be easy, I know this. I have no dillusions about that, but I will make it happen. If I actually want to make something of myself, I'm gonna have to do this. I refuse to be my sisters. Yeah, they're fine now, but they've had to struggle so hard to get there. Why? Because they didn't do well in school. They never went to college (well Darlene did *try*). John (Darlene's husband) is over in Iraq now, working as someone's bodyguard. He makes a crap-ton of money, and yes, the job is admirable. It just doesn't seem worth it though. He's a good man and wants to provide everything he can for his family-I'm not disputing this, but <i>Iraq</i>? I mean, if that's what he loves, then by all means, go ahead, I suppose, but to me it just doesn't seem worth it. I'm constantly worried for Darlene, Kim, Sean, and Ms. Lindsay (as well as the rest of us), that he won't come back.  I know it's morbid, but it's also reality. 

Reality is not all flowers and sunshine. Sometimes it fucking sucks. No one ever thinks reality applies to them when something bad happens. ""I just failed my class for the semester. This isn't happening to me; this happens to other people."" That's the thing, we always assume that reality will happen to other people, never to us. When it does, some of us just lose it, while others pick up the pieces, put them back together the best they can and move on. I'd like to think that my parents raised me to be the kind of person that does the latter. I want to be strong enough to not break down at every little thing that goes wrong. Maybe I shouldn't, but I also want to be the person, that when I do break down and cry, people are surprised. I want to be a rock. Rocks don't have feelings. Rocks don't care if they're cast aside. One rock can stand alone and not care. Unfortunately, rocks can be changed by the other element. Water can erode them. The bitter wind can turn a rock to an almost ice-like formation. The blazing sun can cause it become too hot to touch. I don't want to be those things. I don't want situations to have an effect on me. I know that's unreasonable, but it's how I feel. I don't want other people to have control over how I feel. Maybe a rock is not what I want to be. Maybe I would like to be the wind. Going where I want to go, moving what I want to move, flowing around what I can't. No one can contain you, no matter how hard they may try. I decide when I want to wreak havoc, where, and upon whomever I choose. I also decide when to lay low and let things smooth over. Yeah, I think, that's more fitting. I would love to be a rock, but I think the wind suits me best.

I'm glad I have you two there. Y'all will never know how truly grateful I am to have there, and I regret that. I wish I could put into words how much I appreciate you both. I think I'd be halfway crazy if I didn't have yall there to talk to. Okay, well maybe I'm halfway crazy anyway, but atleast I know I'm not alone. ::laughs::

I know that things are not always as bad as they seem, and that given enough time, things will turn around and get better. I understand this, but what I don't understand is how certain things can get so bad in the first place. How do things go from being perfectly fine to being complete crap? How do feelings just disappear? I mean, I know where thoughts come from, but does it work with feelings and emotions? And does it work when they leave? Do they just evaporate? Tell me, how does that work. There's only one person that can help me out with this one. So, tell me, how do you have feelings for me one day, but then decide the next that those feelings are no longer there. Feelings of attraction and wanting to be something more, replaced by something far more convenient and depressing? We're friends? Yeah, right. We're friends because you let it happen. Too much time passed without anything being said or done? Who's fault is that? Not mine. I've put myself out there before, and I was shot down. So, excuse <i>me</i> if I'm not wanting to put myself out there a second time. Excuse <i>me</i> for thinking that you could man up and tell me how you feel after learning what had happened before. Things didn't happen when I said how I felt before, and now that I've kept my feelings a little closer, my discretion has bitten me in the ass. I'm damned if I do, I'm damned if I don't. I give up. I don't know what you want from me. I know what I want from you, but I suppose it's too late for that now.

Sorry this entry has been so ranty. I didn't intend for it to be this long and incoherent. Thanks for reading anyway."

<i>Addendum 1713</i>

I *realize* that I said take it if you want it, but let me rephrase: For all of you who have not taken up my 'offer', do it. Right now. I mean it. It is no longer an 'offer'; it is a, how do you say, take it right fucking now 'cause I command it? Oh right, that's a demand. I was bored. I am bored. I will be bored when I get back to that hell hole that people 'lovingly' refer to as Huntsville. If you don't want me to start killing people that don't deserve to die, ie. you to alleviate my boredom, I highly suggest you hop to. Have a fantastic day. I love you all, but I *may* be forced to kill you if you are disinclined to acquiesce to my request. Just thought you might like to know."

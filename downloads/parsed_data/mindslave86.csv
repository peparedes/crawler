"event","It is a little know fact that the holy roman empire actually started out as a baseball team for the Roman Holies, a minor league baseball team in the EBL (European Baseball League).  Over the years, however, history has been twisted, mostly due to Pope Benedict II, who was such a big fan of the Holies that he granted saint-hood to the entire team, which gave way to the nickname the Holy Roman Empire.  Thus, whenever the Holies won the championship the masses, including local newspapers, declared that the Holies won the War.  One of the most notable wins in the Holies' history was their defeat of the Ottoman Otters, who were considered huge favorites.  
    Unfortunately the Holies did fall,however, when it was discovered that the entire team, led by Saint McGuire, took steroids."

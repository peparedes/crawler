I looked outside the door and saw two white kids playing in our neighbor&#39;s yard. (Take note, if you know anything about living in a black ghetto, this was a major &quot;what the &amp;@$% moment.) &nbsp;Mom then said something about needing to help someone, said that she would be back, and disappeared. &nbsp;I immediately started suffocating again. &nbsp;I woke up soon after that.</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6px;"">Take note, this all happened after I went to bed at 12:45am, then didn&#39;t get to sleep for and hour and a half. &nbsp;As you can see, my day is NOT going particularly well...</span>"

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">This is all after a dream where my friends and I were kidnapped and placed into some kind of military school compound where the teachers expiremented on us for no apparent reason. &nbsp;They tried to convince us that we were alone and tried to steal something fom us that apparently I had stumbled upon earlier in the dream on my laptop. &nbsp;I remember running throught school either to explore, or to look for a way out, but a pain in my knee woke me up before I could finish the search.</span>

<span style=""line-height: 19.6000003814697px;"">All of this shit happened in my head the night before Thanksgiving. &nbsp;The night before we go celebrate being thankful for everything we have, I had two dreams about something being taken from us. &nbsp;The night before we are supposed to go enjoy time with our family, I have a drem of being isolated from my own. &nbsp;Can anyone explain to me why God would do something like that? &nbsp;Because this is utter bulllshit.</span>

Perhaps I should start with my student loans. No, no, that won&#39;t be interesting. &nbsp;I know, I start with my insecurities. &nbsp;Nope, wait, too bland. WAIT, I KNOW...

<i>&quot;Hi, I&#39;m Homestar, and this is a website!&quot; </i>

Yeah that did it. &nbsp;That made all of my problems go away. &nbsp;Student loan debt that my grandkids may still be paying off? No problem. &nbsp;In ability to get a freakin&#39; job that pays well? No biggie. &nbsp;Having to rely on my mother for everything again after having had a taste of independence? <b>NO FUCKING PROBLEM AT ALL!!!!</b>

No, none of it bothers me, noooo. &nbsp;Not the student loans, not the joblessness, and certainly not the &quot;return to a state of complete and utter uselessness and dependency!&quot; &nbsp;No, none of that bothers me at all. &nbsp;It&#39;s all good. &nbsp;Everything&rsquo;s perfect. Just perfect. <b>JUST FUCKING PERFECT I TELL YOU!!!</b>

I mean, what could be wrong. &nbsp;I have clothes on my back. &nbsp;I have shoes on my feet. &nbsp;I have food to eat, water to drink, a roof over my head. &nbsp;So what if the only thing keeping me from losing all of that is my mom having to pay for all of my shit again. &nbsp;That&#39;s how it used to be, right? &nbsp;It&#39;s no big deal. &nbsp;No big deal <b>AT ALL!!!</b> &nbsp;I&#39;m perfectly fine. &nbsp;Perfectly fine with it mind you. &nbsp;I have no problems with it AT all! &nbsp;Okay, maybe a smaaaaaaall problem. &nbsp;I mean, I&#39;m not keen on the whole &quot;stuck at home with mom&quot; thing. &nbsp;But hey, everyone&#39;s gonna end up like that, right? &nbsp;So what&#39;s there to worry about?

My student loans? No big deal. &nbsp;So what if I owe $70,000+ in student loans. &nbsp;It&#39;s no big deal. &nbsp;I mean, it&#39;s only gonna follow me around for the rest of my life, right? &nbsp; It&#39;s no big deal. &nbsp;People get crippled by debt all the time. &nbsp;It&#39;s nothing new. &nbsp;People have been trying to fix this shit for years. &nbsp;It&#39;s not like this is anything new, right? <b>RIGHT?!</b>

<b>And my mental emotional issues!</b> &nbsp;Hoo boy, how worthless are those things. <b>Am I right or what?!</b> &nbsp;Not like anyone really cares about that shit, after all. &nbsp; It&#39;s just me whining, or being stupid, or taking shit too seriously, or not thinking things through, or, my personal favorite, me <b>not being POSITIVE ENOUGH!!</b> &nbsp;But hey, what&#39;s the big deal? it&#39;s just some loser negativatard focuses too much on the bad and not enough on the good, right? &nbsp;You should focus on the silver lining. &nbsp;It doesn&#39;t matter that the dark clouds are essentially blocking out the sun. &nbsp;Oh, look, there&#39;s a silver lining. &nbsp;Torrential rainstorm flooding the area? &nbsp;Doesn&#39;t matter. &nbsp;Why? Silver lining. &nbsp;Hurricane winds ripping what little remains of my &quot;house&quot; that never got past the foundation?&nbsp; <b>JUST LOOK AT THAT FUCKING SILVER LINING!!!!!</b>

And don&rsquo;t get me started on the girl I keep obsessing over.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve mentioned her once or twice in t few previous posts.&nbsp; Oh wait, that&rsquo;s right.&nbsp; Those are private.&nbsp; I guess I shouldn&rsquo;t talk about those then.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s move on then.

<b>TRUST ISSUES!!!</b> Yes! That&rsquo;s it!&nbsp; Trust issues.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s look those.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s talk about the fact that I can&rsquo;t seem to trust anyone anymore.&nbsp; Not, scratch that.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t seem to trust anyone&rsquo;s attitudes anymore.&nbsp; Not wait that&rsquo;s not right.&nbsp; AH HAH!! I&rsquo;VE GOT IT!! <b>I CAN&rsquo;T SEEM TO FORGIVE PEOPLE FOR LYING TO ME ANYMORE!!!</b> YES! &nbsp;THAT&rsquo;S IT!&nbsp; <b>IT&rsquo;S ALL ABOUT THE LIES!&nbsp; </b>A neighborhood &ldquo;friend&quot; turning traitor and robbing me of my small bit of contentment that was my home?&nbsp; FUCK! YOU SIR!&nbsp; FUCK YOU! AND THE HORSE YOU RODE IN ON! AND THE STABLE IT CAME FROM! AND THE FARM ON WHICH IT WAS RAISED!! AND THE LAND ON WHICH YOUR FUCKING CRAPPY-ASS ANCESTORS BUILT THAT SHITHOLE ON!!!! <b>ROT AND DIE YOU FUCKING FUCKUP MOTHERFUCKER!!!! ROT AND FUCKING DIE!!!!!</b>

And then there&rsquo;s <b>you</b>, best friend.&nbsp; Yes, <b>YOU</b>.&nbsp; The one who decided that I was to be his mortal enemy and emotional punching bag.&nbsp; Not because I was actually at fault, mind you, but because <b>I POSTED ABOUT OBAMA!!!</b> WHO GIVES A FUCK YOU RETARD!!! WAS I THE ONLY ONE WHO POSTED OBAMA?! NOOOOO!!!&nbsp; You knew that?&nbsp; Really? <b>THEN WHY THE FUCK DID YOU SINGLE ME OUT?!!!</b> What&rsquo;s that, you lost your mom and have decided to take it out on me?&nbsp; BOO FUCKING HOO YOU ASSHOLE!!!&nbsp; I lost my granny and had to carry her casket as my 16<sup>th</sup> birthday present, <b>BUT I DIDN&rsquo;T TAKE IT OUT ON YOU DID I?!!!!</b>

And lastly, the girl.&nbsp; Yes. <b>Her</b>.&nbsp; Why am I obsessed with her, you ask?&nbsp; It is it because I like her?&nbsp; Well, yes. And no.&nbsp; You see, I can understand being shy.&nbsp; I can understand being selectively social. &nbsp;I can even understand having trust issues with the people around you.&nbsp; <b>What I cannot understand is this idea that you have to screw over, lie to, or otherwise hurt your closest friends JUST TO MAKE NEW ONES!</b>

So yeah.&nbsp; Those are my problems.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s all good.&nbsp; After all, a good laugh should make it all better, right? Ha ha haaaaa. &nbsp;Just think positive.&nbsp; Just think positive.&nbsp; Just think&hellip;<i>positive</i>."

Just imagine this: my cousin and I are at the house and something goes horribly, HORRIBLY WRONG! &nbsp;Yes, I had yet ANOTHER nightmare dealing with that FUCKING HOUSE!!!!!  

First off, don&#39;t ask me how I know this, but whatever was going on had something to do with my PlayStation 1. &nbsp;(The original, not the portable version) &nbsp;At first, it was just us playing a game or something. &nbsp;At least, that&#39;s what I&#39;m assuming was going on. &nbsp;I highly doubt we pulled out the damn thing just to what we did next with it. I don&#39;t know why but we had the GENIUS IDEA to put the PlayStation under the bed and sit on it. &nbsp;Somehow that made the WHOLE BED VIBRATE. &nbsp;At first, it was all in good fun. We enjoyed it. &nbsp;(I don&#39;t know why, but we did for some reason.)  

Then things got...painful. &nbsp;I don&#39;t know what went wrong, or how it happened, but the next thing I knew the vibrations were getting worse and worse. &nbsp;What was a fun and stupid idea became the most pain I had felt in days, years even. &nbsp;Jason managed to get off the bed and, thinking it would help, unplugged the controllers for the system. &nbsp;Unfortunately, that didn&#39;t stop it. &nbsp;In fact, that made it worse. &nbsp;The vibrations got stronger...and stronger...and stronger. &nbsp;It felt like my whole body was gonna burst open. &nbsp;I kept trying to scream &quot;Help me,&quot; but the words wouldn&#39;t come.  

...Okay scratch that, the words came alright, but there was now sound behind them. &nbsp;No matter how much I tried, I could never get enough sound to get any more volume out of my scream than a weird little squeal. &nbsp;I kept trying over and over. &nbsp;My cousin knew I was there. &nbsp;He could see me. &nbsp;HE WAS STANDING NEXT TO THE BED FOR FUCK&#39;S SAKE!!! &nbsp;But every time I tried he said &quot;it&#39;s not that simple&quot; or &quot;it&#39;s complicated.&quot; &nbsp;He kept saying that over and over and I kept trying to scream at him, begging him to help me.  

All the while I had this picture in my head, and the more he refused to help me, clearer the picture became. &nbsp;What was the picture, you ask? &nbsp;And image of the power cord being pulled out of the PlayStation. &nbsp;Maybe this is what I was trying to convey to him. &nbsp;I don&#39;t know. &nbsp;What I do know is that the pain just kept getting worse and worse, and I couldn&#39;t even move because of it. Imagine a drill and vibrates instead of spins. &nbsp;Now imagine that was your bed. &nbsp;That&#39;s what it felt like. &nbsp;My whole body hurt, and the more I tried to scream, the worse it seemed to get. &nbsp;Jason wouldn&#39;t help me, and no one else could hear me. &nbsp;Everything just kept getting worse and worse until...it happened. &nbsp;What happened? I don&#39;t know, but it was enough to have me waking up and nearly screaming my friggin&#39; head off. &nbsp;As you can imagine I won&rsquo;t be going back to sleep for a while. &nbsp;Especially not when pain, pain, and more pain seemed to be all that&#39;s waiting for me. &nbsp;Think I&#39;ll go watch the news. &nbsp;Listen to some music. &nbsp;Something to help me remember that the dream was just that: and dream."

What is hatred, really? A strong dislike? Fear having gained aggression? An excuse for those with power to mistreat those whom they perceive to have none? Or maybe, nothing at all? A worthless ideal with not true value. The first step on a path to destruction or a state of being in which someone who has sunk into despair seeks to justify their actions with prejudice and anger?

What does hatred really accomplish? Nothing. Nothing at all. It only leads to more hatred, more despair, more destruction. It just breeds more of itself, consuming all in its path.

Those who have been consumed often lose all sense of self, willingly or not, and seek only to bring others down with them. They do not seek reason. They seek only to cause conflict, to awaken the disease known as hatred in others, and to watch all who do not fall into the pit of hatred parish into the abyss of despair. They do not seek value in anything. They do not want to know about truth, reality, or anything of merit beyond what they can feed their all-consuming sickness. They seek only to fuel the hatred inside them. They believe it to be a source of strength, when in fact it is a weakness. It is the greatness weakness of those with hearts, feelings and souls. It is the father of mistrust and the son of fear. A creature that should not have born unto this world, yet it lingers in us all.

We seek to bring an end to hatred, but we fuel without knowing. We wish to rise above the hatred, and yet we seem to seek it daily. Even know, in a time of great strife, peril, and death, we claim to overcome hatred with religion, reason, and understanding, yet we constantly use those very tools to justify its existence. We are fools. To think we, who pride ourselves on our intelligence, are too blind to see such a simple truth. We call ourselves a peaceful, intelligent people, and yet we thrive on the violence and hatred of this word. Where there is peace, we bring conflict. Where there is love, we breed hatred. We turn to one another and accuse or neighbors of being the cause of our pain, if only to justify the hatred which had already been brewing in our hearts. Hatred&hellip;is a dreadful thing.</span></span></span></p><p style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><span style=""font-size: 10.5pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,sans-serif;"">However, this should not deter us from seeking to abolish hatred. Though it may seem pointless, though the effort may prove fruitless, we must rise above this disease known as hatred. We cannot continue to be enslaved to that which seeks to destroy us. Yes, it may seem futile, but if we as people are to survive in this world, we must seek to bring an end to hatred, and all that it breeds within us. And though it may seem foolish, fruitless, even na&iuml;ve of me to do so, I pray for the day that the word &ldquo;hate&rdquo; no longer exists in this world. May we all seek to be free of this all-consuming menace once and for all, and live in the peace that God has ordained shall come to us.</span></span></span></p>"

Best friend, huh?  Let me see.  If I had to pick, I'd say I have three of them.  Two of them are guys like me, andof them is a girl.  

The first one (on of the guys) I've know since we were in Second grade together.  That would put us at about 16 years of friendship.

The second one (the other guy) I've known since Middle school.  He was a year behind me since I'm a year older than him. My friendship with him has lasted about 11 years, al most as long as the first one.

The last one (the girl) I met in college during my thrid semester.  We've know each other for about 4 years now.  Strangely enough, everyone we know thinks we should be dating.  (the only exceptions being her girlfriends and her parents)

So there you have it.  My list of best friends.  I'm not going into too many details about them because I want to keep them as anonymous us possible."

By the end of this year I hope to be in a new house, in a new neighborhood, with a new life.  I hope to be back at school starting on a new degree, and working my way ever closer towards graduation.  I hope to have put the hell of this place I currently call home behind me, and to be free of all the crap it has brought.  

On top of it all, I hope to be able to sleep soundly, and have some form of peace of mind. I want to be able to sit in the house knowing that no one is coming to the door in the middle of the night looking for whatever type of cash we may have lying around.  

In short: I hope for some very big changes to occur this year!"

Let's see, I'm gonna be put into a box where I'll be living out the rest of my natural life staring at the same 4 walls.  I could either does this alone, or I could befriend the only other thing in the room: a cockroach.  I don't know about the rest of the world, but I'd do it.  Even if my only friend was a ball of dust or a piece of stone, I'd make it my friend.  Anything is better than dying alone."

"event","Have you ever had that one friend who you just can't understand.  That one friend who seems to be your total opposite in every way possible.  That one friend who you look at and think ""WHY THE HELL AM I FRIENDS WITH THIS GUY?!""  Well, I have finally found that friend.

His name is...um...I think it's Shawn or...something.  Well, whatever his name is, he's plucking my last nerve.  The guy seems to be a total party animal who only went to college to hook up with girls and make himself ""stand out"".  He doesn't seem to think about the consequences of his actions (he said himself that he ties his best not to) and he seems to take pride in trying to be better than everyone else.  On top of it all when you prove him about something he sticks only to the part of the statement or conversion that makes him look good.  It's as if he's totally focused on his own image.  

I've also noticed that he has a habit of telling me how I'm ""buggin'"" when I tell him how I did something straightforward, but he doesn't think anything is wrong with doing stuff behind someone else's back.  For example, when I told him how most of the students in Dr. Johnson's Calculus I class were having difficulty and went to his office for help, he thought that that was ""showing weakness"" and ""saying you're the dumb one"".  I told him that you're more likely to get results if you talk to the teacher one on one, but he thought it would better better to make a spectacle of it and stand up in front of the class telling the teacher it was his fault that we couldn't pass the class.
 
He also seems to have a habit of saying stuff without thinking about what effect is words will have on people around him.  For example, he had the nerve to say that the entire marching band ""doesn't do real work"" and that the conductor of bands ""does nothing but stand up there and wave there hands around"".  Is this guy serious?  He barely has one year of musical experience, has NEVER been on a marching band, but he thinks that hardest thing that a marching band member does is ""learnin' da notes"".  I told him to go say that to some people in the music building and see what they'd say.  He told they ""wouldn't do nothin'"" knowing full well he'll never do it.  Even if he did do it, I already know that my response, which was one step short of calling him an idiot and a jerk, would be the MILDEST reply he would get.

I've also noticed that he has a habit of calling me ""B"", which I highly doubt stands for ""bro"" when he tells me how I'm ""buggin'"".  What also irritates me is that I KNOW he's been using me to pass our US History course.  It's probably the only reason he talks to me.  Hell, the first time we met was because he saw how fast I typed during Dr. Williams's lecture.  He even had the gaul to com looking for a copy of my notes at 2 O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING!!!  SERIOUSLY, WHO DOES THAT?!  

Just why am I even talking to this guy?  Have I completely lost my mind?"

I can't concentrate, I feel sleepy all the time, I get headaches, and when I look at the computer screen and think about coding I suddenly get sleepy and can't keep my eyes open.  It's as if I've run out of energy. I don't know why, but suddenly I can't seem to do anything right.  It's as if my brain has decided to shut down and I can't turn it back on now.

Am I losing my marbles or what?"

I actually came up with the name for something other than LiveJournal.  It was originally the name of a character I made up in 7th grade, but I liked the name so much that I decided to use it here.  There's not much else to it really.  I would put down soem stuf about the character, but I've made so many different versions of the character that I don't feel like picking on."

If I found out that I only had 6 months let ot live, I'd probably just give up on life at that point.  

If I did have to find something to do, then this is what I would do with my time:

-continue learing how to program computers
-buy and play a PS3 and Wii.
-get a job
-yell at my grandmother and make her listen to me and accept how I feel (OR hit her over the head with a hammer if she doesn't listen t words)
-study more Spanish
-study more Music
-cry like a baby....

that's about it."

"event","Well I finally joined the mind consuming, overly praised creature known as Facebook.  To be honest, I hadn't though much of it (and I still don't).  It just seemed like it must suck to me because everybody and their god-father says it's awesome, and whenever I asked why all they could give me was ""cause it's Facebook!!!""  If they didn't give me that they gave me something that wasn't unique to Facebook, such as:

""a way to contact your friends""- I looked down pretty heavily on this response.  This is because I felt that you could do the same thing by getting a cellphone, an email address, an Instant messaging service (YIM, AIM, etc...), or just meet them in person.  There are many other ways to make contact with your friends and family that don't require Facebook.

""the games are fun""- There are plenty of Flash games sites I could go to with higher quality games than what Facebook has.  

""It's the first site to do this kind of stuff""- I knew that this was wrong the moment it left their lips.  Facebook is just a Social Networking Site with a lot of gizmos attached(chat, games, etc..), and the Social Networking Site has been around for a long time; longer than I've been alive.  In fact, I think the Social Networking Site may even be as old as the internet itself.  I have to check this later...

""Everybody has a Facebook""- This was the reason that made me want to choke someone.  I can't STAND ban-wagon mentality.  It made me so mad that I labeled Facebook as nothing more than a fad and figured that there was no point in joining after this.  Seriously, if the only reason you join something is because everyone else is part of it, you need to rethink that decision 

Despite all that, I ended up joining Facebook anyway.  I'm still not too found of the site (even though I have already spent half a day's worth of time on the site since making my account on Friday) and am not looking forward to using it all that much.  Unfortunately I don't have much of a choice as many of my friends have yet to give me their contact info and I won't be able to see them once they graduate college. (Yes, my reason ended up being ""a way to contact your friends.)  So, Facebook, I'll just have to make the most out of you.

Well, that's the end of my rant...toodles."

Benadryl had drowsyness, Prilosec fucks up your digestive track; if that pill were able to influnce control over your whole body, then what ever side effect it might have would definitely cripple you.  I'm not saying there are not benefits at all, I'm just sayings that, in this case, the ends may not justify the means.

In addition to that, I don't like the idea of being able to ""pop a pill"" for everything.  Taking medicine for sickness, aches and pains and so on, is acceptable.  Having t take a vitamin or a supplament everyday is fine too.  But to pop a pill simply to get the same exercise you could get by going outside and jogging?  No thanks.  I'd rather get my exercise the old-fashioned way."

"event","It's almost the end of the school year, and I'm slightly excited.  Though i don't look forward to getting a job this summer, I do look forward to ESCAPING THIS PLACE.  It's not that I don't like the school, it's just that I'm tired of dealing with this crap.  The constantly changing moods, the tv being on all the time, THAT FACT THAT I HAVE LEARNED MORE ABOUT BASKETBALL IN THIS SEMESTER THAN I KNEW IN MY ENTIRE FUCKING LIFE!!!!

What is the source of this crap I'm complaining about you ask?  MY ROOMMATES!!!  Seriously, I'd rather have to room with a dog and a cat than these two.  One of them Is so unpredictable with his outbursts that he always finds a way to get on my nerves.  He also has a weird habit of standing in a corner for no apparent reason and is highly prone to breaking into song and dance at a moment's notice.  Normally i wouldn't care, but he has been doing this sort of thing a) all semester , and b) anywhere between 11:00pm to 4:00am!!!  That's annoying!!!

The other one is a piece of work.  He's the one who I said in my last post was leaving the tv on ALL the time.  He's also the one whose constant obsession with basketball has started to make me hate the sport.  He also has a habit of leaving his tv on at as high a volume as possible when he is watching his games.  This usually means that the tv will be so loud that no one in the room can think (not that I think these guys try to do that to often).  He's also prone to to have the tv on for nothing more than background noise.  I've even had to deal with moments where he had his tv volume turned up REALLY loud (usually for a show I can't stand) while texting on his cellphone with and Ipod plugged into his ears.  And this at THREE IN THE MORNING!!!  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!!!

...Well, there is ONE good thing I can get out of this.  You know what it is?  I'm NEVER gonna have to room with these two again!!!  AH HA HA HA HA HA HA HAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!

"event","Bout time I did one of these.  Seriuosly, I've been a member of Live Journal for 2 years, but I only have like five posts?  Goes to show just how much I value talking about my life online.  

Anyway, it's 5am and I'm bored.  I'm thinking about using my roommate's tv to wath adult swim, but I haven't checked to see if he's sleeping with his remote tonight or not.  (Seriously, the guy keeps his remote next to himself on the bed and then just goes to sleep without turning the tv off.  I've lost more sleep in the past two weeks than I got all winter break.)  I'm also wondering if he'll wake up and get mad if I take th remote away and try to watch his tv without his permission.  He gives the impression that he's trying to be ""Hawd"" or whatever you call it.  I mean he watched a guy on Comedy Central who spent his entire act talking about ""bitch-ass niggas"" and ""when ya fuckin ya girl"".  I'm thinking  should say something, but I'm batting 0 for 2 on the ""roommate caring about the tv causing others to loose sleep"" thing and don't feel like being 0 for 3 in the argument department.  (The second roommate I had actually threatened to throw me out the room for being up before 6am, but had no problem leaving his tv on all night and causing me to loose sleep.) Did I happen to mention that he has the tv set up so that the only way you can watch it is the be on his side of the room?  REALLY irritating.  And since he's taken up the only cable hub that we have in the room  can't plug in my tv and watch what I wanna watch.  Therefore I am stuck listening to whatever's on, which usually tends to be REALLY LOUD INFOMERCIALS!!!  

On a side note, WHY DO ALL THE GUYS DOWN HERE LEAVE THE TV ON WHEN THEY GO TO SLEEP?!!  Seriously, almost all the roomamtes I had before this guy did this and now he does this.  I've only had one guy who didn't leave the tv on everynight and tHat's because he was always out with a girl every other night.  Why couldn't I get a roommate who understands the meaning of courtesy?!!!  Just once I'd like a roommate who notices that he HAS A ROOMMATE!!!!

Well that's all for my rant.  I'm gonna check and see if he's holding the remote or not and decide what to do from there.  *looks*  Yep, he's got it....right on his skin....(I did mention he sleeps in nothing but his boxers, right?)

I swear to god that if I get another roommate like this I'm gonna.....AAAAAAAARGH!!!!"

I think I'd rather be trapped in an elevator with Eeyore for several reasons.

A) We're both pessimists
B) We're both quiet
C) Everyone I know says I'm gloomy

Personally, Tigger's endless supply of energy would eventually get on my nerves.

"event","I'll explain it in stages so that I can make sense when I talk.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Day 1: Friday

You ever had to wait for a plane that was hour late?  How about having to wait for the plain you have to trasnfer to when you're in the middle of NOWHERE!!!!!!!!  Well that's what happened to me.  The plane (which was already going to get me to Charleston, SC late anyway) was late by AN HOUR!!!! Because of that, i got here so late that I couldn't even eat dinner!!!  (All the restuarants were closed)


Day 2: Saturday

Not much to say here, except the fact that I couldn't get ANYTHING DONE!!!  i was expecting to be able to register for my room, but nooooooooooooooooo!!!!  NO ONE WAS HERE!!!!!  So basically, i spent the whole day walking around in the heat from building to building in the heat for nothing.  


Day 3: Sunday

Otherwise know as : ""HYTERICAL NATHANIE DAY!!!!""  Seriously, i hadn't been that upset in a long time.  Here's how it was looking to me: At 11:00am, I was going to be put out of my room in the hotel.  Therefore, I had to get my dorm room before then.  Unfortanetly for me, NO ONE WAS HERE AGAIN!!!!  Of course I freaked. If i didn't have a dorm room to go to from the hotel, I might end up on the street for the night.  But if I paid for one more night in the hotel, I might not have enough money to get my stuff out of storage.  I tried to call mom for advice, but...I got a busy signal.  I said ""what the heck"" and figured I have to call back later.  5 minutes later, I call again.  Busy signal again.  I think ""I must not have given enough time"" and decide to wait a little longer.  10 minutes later I call again.  Busy signal...again!!!  I start thinking ""oh shit"" and begin to call repeatedly.  1 hour and 30 minutes later I'm STILL getting a busy signal!!!!  WHAT THE FUCK?!!!!  So, I ended paying for anothe day in the hotel.  Come to find out, the reason i couldn't find anybody is because nothing school related opened till 1pm!!!  ...I felt soooooo stupid after i found that out.  So, I FINALLY got my room, which I was told was room 306, but I still had a day to spend in the hotel.  SO I spent it in the hotel.


Day 4: Monday (Part 1)

...I'm not sure where to start.  Today was officailly won the ""WORST DAY EVER"" award from me.  First off I get up in the morning, eat breakfast, sign out of the hotel, and expect to go to my room.  I forgot that I had to carry ALL OF MY STUFF across the PARKING LOT and around the duck pond which was bigger than the SWIMMING POOL!!!  Of course, after than long-ass trek through the heat and humidity (THEY WOULD HAVE HUMIDITY TODAY OF ALL DAYS) I go to lok for my room.  Guess where I end up! come on, GUESS!!!  Fine, I'll tell.  I wound up looking for my room in THE GIRLS' DORM!!!  I spent no less than 30 minutes trying to figure out how I was placed in te girls' dormatory.  When i finally got help for the residence life people, I found out that the number I was told was WRONG!!!  can you guess what my room number was?  Yes...that's right... it was 3(FUCKING)60!!!!  I got people helping for an hour over something as stupid as that?!!!  ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!!!!  


Day 4: Monday (Part 2)

Well, after that...um...mishap (yes, let's call it that...) I finally got to my room.  I expected to be the first one there, and therefore thought that I was going to get to just hop on te nearest bed and call it mine.  Boy was I wrong.  Not only was I the last one here, but I also had to climb onto the top bunk in the back!!!  (GODDAMMIT!!!)  Well, I got SOME rest at least, but then I remebered something:  I never called Mr. McGinnis to see if he could come get me!!!!!  So I had to walk aaaaaaaaalll the way back to the hotel just to use the phone.  When I talked to him, he said he would be here in an hour.  So I sat in te lobby of the hotel for an hour trying not to fall asleep.  So when he got there, We went to the storage unit.  When we got there, I realized something important: I don't remember where I put my STUFF!!!!  Thus i got him helping look for my shit for a good ten minutes.  ...VERY bad day.


Day 4: Monday (Part 3)

Ah, finally.  I got all my stuff that I'm gonna need for the week.  My bed sheets, my computer, my phone, and the clothes i left down here.  So I figured ""timne to call mom and let her know I'm alive"".  Once again, I have a problem: can't...reach...phone jack.  I figure ""ah, what the hell, I still have my internet"".  ...Riiiiiiiiiight.  Come to find out I have to get an NEW set of login crap that the scoll thought up.  Here's the catch.  You ready?  THE INSTALLER WON'T OPEN ON MY COMPUTER!!!!  So I have to walk to another building to find out what's wrong.  It took them an hour to figure it put. (Mostly because my computer was being stubborn)  
-------------------------------------------------------------

Well, As you can see, I finally got it to work.  On the bright side, I have no classes tomorrow.  (WOO HOO!!!!)  And I got t post this for everyone to see.

PS- Did I mention my computer froze several times while I was typing this?"

MY ROOMMATE!!!!

He always leaves the tv on at 12:00 am when going to sleep (waking me up of course), and whenever he walks into the room and I'm watching tv, he'll turn on his tv and try to drown mine out! (DAMN my good upbringing, I could soooooooooo out do him if I turned mine up.)  What really pisses me off is the fact that when i left my music on ONCE he THREATENED TO HAVE ME REMOVED FROM THE ROOM FOR MAKING TOO MUCH NOISE!!!  He also kept turning off my alarm EVERY morning, which made me late A LOT!!!

Has anyone else had this sort of thing happen to them?"

Picture this:

You're in an school auditorium that you've never sen but for some reason you'e sure you know.  you're minding your own business when this...thing comes out of nowhere.  This thing, it was wierd, ugly, and something I'd never want to see again.  I still can't beleive I was actually dreaming about this.  

A brain, a fucking brain.  It was floating, with tentacles.  and on top of it all, it was whit, with black stain-like spots all over it.  At first, it appeared to be no larger then my chest.  I went in to hit it, (apparently it was the third one I faced) and found it to be bigger than me. (almost like a bed.)  I climbed on it and we flew around the room.  I fought, I bit it, torn of peices of it, but nothing worked.  It just keep going higher, and higher.  

Finally, started screaming for mom.  I couldn't think of anything else, it just wouldn't go away!!!  while I was flying around, I could her.  She was outside running towards the building.  

....I don't think she made it.  

After that i woke up, grabbing at the air as if there was something there.  I was scared, still am.  I'm trying not to go to sleep, if I can help it.  It was too scary.  I just don't want to deal with it again."

And somehow, I got to the question ""would you rather be a born winner or a born loser?"" (connect those dots why don't ya) Well, the natural answer would be, ""I want to be a born winner"", but that's not what I chose.  Instead, I came up with this...

""I would rather be a born loser.  The problem with being a born winner is that you have o keep winning.  If you so much as lose at one thing, you lose the status of winner and hit rock bottom.  You become a loser indefinitely, and no matter what you do, you will never get the same glory you had before; even if you start winning again.

""Being a born loser, however, let's you start from rock bottom.  That way, You can work your way up to being a winner instead of being forced to be one.  And because you are a born loser, you losing in the winners' circle would just make you average as opposed to useless.  And so, If I were given a choice, I would rather be a born loser than a born winner.""

"event","Well, at the beginning of this summer, I had originally planned to have more time off to do other stuff such as help around the house and perform such other chores. This would have also allowed me to update this journal more often and appear online more.......but noooooo....certain people were just bent determined on getting me to work this summer as well as take two online classes at the first term. One of them is college algebra. Now, while I am OK at math..I had discovered something about it. I believe that the reason a lot of people had trouble with algebra is not because they're not good with it, but because they try to use the traditional study method for it. I believe that it requires it's own study method, weird eh? Well, two more months before school after this month of June and I'll be back at college taking even more classes since I plan to achieve a Bachelors. I'm going to have to fix a certain laptop, because for some reason it keeps unexpectingly shutting down on me when I am performing intense operations on it. Or if I just leave it on for awhile, it just shuts down automatically even when it is plugged into the wall. It doesn't matter if it is running off the battery of the power adapter, it will just suddenly shut down. What's weird though is that it will only shut down when I'm using the Windows XP Pro operating system. But when I am running it on Linux, everything is fine. Hmmm, perhaps Linux just doesn't put as much preasure on it as Windows does? I dunno.....beh. Oh, and I found this cool website a long time ago, www.knoxskorner.com. It has some really funny dubbed movies and clay animations. Quiet awhile since I been there though since the arise of work and online classes. Well, I am about to end this journal entry here, but before I do, I have something to say. Irene and Michael, please do not ever think that just because I don't come online often doesn't mean I have forgotten about you two. As my best freinds, I always have missed you guys, and always will. And no, I'm not assuming that you thought that of me, but I was always afraid that you guys would think I just flat out forgot about you two because I didn't come online as much. I know that I have trouble keeping in touch, but believe me it's not because I mean to. Just please don't ever forget that I care about you people, ok? I will be off for now, since study time is here, so I bid everyone farewell for the time being until the next journal entry."

I still hope though to visit my freinds plenty, and that is that. A lot of people are having trouble with Jonesborrow (please forgive for misspell), but it's Arkansas. I'm hoping to find one of those Japanese peasent hats, those are neat. Well, that's all I can write for now, but yes."

"event","Ok, went to Chinese resteraunt and ate tonight with some freinds. Ummmmmm, it seemed to have been wild last weekend at the boy's dorm, from people being covered with germex to someone being chased by the mother of a 13 year old for getting the mother's daughter high. Hmmm, glad I was not there at that time. And of course, this involved a John Deere boy,hmmm indeed. Oh, and since it's become warmer, these beautiful trees appeared with their nice-scented white flowers ^-^ Ahhh....... :) Anywho, I miss all you guys that aren't here with me, and you know who you are! *shakes fingure*."

Of course, this is why I haven't been back to this journal for awhile. Not what I planned though... Anyway, while I was waiting to take this exam, I had been studying as well as keeping up my studies with school work. However, a few days ago I passed! :-D Yay, now I have the MCP, which mean I now have for certifications. Hopefully I'll have a lot of them in my pocket by the time I finish this associates degree. Anyway, back to other things...let's see.... Oh, *does a little dance* I only have one more thing to say......It's penute butter jelly time!!!

"event","Ok everyone, sorry that I've been gone for awhile, it's just that right before and after thanksgiving has been really busy for me due to schoolwork and helping my parants around the house. Other than that, life's ok. I like being happy, it feels nice and fuzzy! :) Ok, so let's see....Oh, and the Cisco and English 2 research paper went well, I just forgot to use a different IP address for the each VLAN 1 on multiple switches, because I thought I had to use the same ip address. And that's why the trunking between the two switches in the skills test wasn't working,but....it did work for the router. However, I am off to finish this week up with a whooo!!!!! *sighs* Oh, and for this dinner,me and some country boys were talking about world domination and how the zombies could come out and get us. Weird....dinner,hmmm. I should've not played Resident Evil too much in the past,oh well. I believe I shall take a nice and warm shower, and then have a quiet study session in my cozy lil dorm room ^-^. lol. Oh,and I haven't forgotten about posting those pics, but hopefully....I will be able to post them early at Christmas Break. Although, I'll also be trying to earn one or more Microsoft certfications during that time, so.....yes. Oh,and sorry that the thanksgiving meeting couldn't be planned,I kept meaning to get into more discussion about it when thanksgiving started,but I just got all caught up in helping around the house and getting ready for physical science tests as well as my final skills tests in my computer classes. It would be cool if they would FINALLY come out with a Macintosh class,that would indeed rock like a fresh clean sock. And that is in a good way,because fresh clean socks smell good! :D"

My stomach is very demanding today. I believe I shall go now and enjoy a cup of coffee alone in that cafferteria until lunch comes around, that sounds good to me.

"event","Well folks, it's almost sleepy time. It's been quite a day, going to visit savior, meeting wanderingbeauty (I don't know if I should be saying actual names online or not...)going to arbyes (Or however you spell it, too bad the little talking mitton wasn't there...), watching a kenshin movie (I think it was called, Kenshin Redemption...or something like that, however I still can't get over on the fact that the movie didn't reveal whether kenshin when he turned into the battoutsai killed that traitor or not,hmm...), oh and listening to weird Al, animie, old cartoon, and much other variaties of music...and also that asian store. I am so envieous of savior, his dorm has his own bathroom and shower for goodness sakes! *cries* I always wanted one with a shower and own bathroom, instead we just have a community bathroom...and it always smells bad in there,sheesh, the things these people eat. Although at least the showers aren't shared, otherwise I would forget living in a dorm there at all,lol. Anyway, I had to wake some people up in order to contact savior about my arival since I was too stupid to bring my phone numbers with me from my dorm room. But come on, it was after 10 and getting close to 11, I didn't think others would sleep in that..late. *shrugs* But then again, it was saturday. But sorry to those who've I woke up, I know how fun sleep can be, and so yes I would't like it either if I was sleeping and then a phone ring jolted me back. But yes, to all who is reading this, I would suggest sleep to be a hobby,because it's fun, yay! :D Anywho, I need to find some time to get my cloak made, I believe I shall make it similar or if I can exactly like the cloke worn by Anakin in the Revenge of the Sith movie...that was a pretty nice cloke,yessiriee...man my spelling tonight is crap. So later on after my visit, I went to my uncle's new house because some of my family wanted to see it, and so therefore I went with them. He got such a good deal on it as well, the laddie left all these expensive curtains, and such other items behind. My favorite room was this green one, I believe it was light green...hmmm. Well, after visiting with my uncle and eating some asian food (which the resteraunt people put in so much of this food in this to-go box, that I couldn't eat it all, and the same went for my mom, so I suppose my uncle will have a good portion of food to have for awhile since he has all this left-over asian food), we went back home. Oh, and he has this cute yorkshir who is quite,well,unique. He'll stare you right in the eye, and then he'll always wait until you're in the car with him, and then go sit in your lap and fart. My uncle isn't sure if he's doing that on purpose or not, but I believe he is 0-0 Anyway, uncle gave him a taste of his own medicine one night, and apparently that drove the yorkshir off of his lap. I suppose it is a battle of the force after all... Speaking of dogs, Angel was quiet pleased to see me when I came back home. Tommorow mourning I'll probably see a lot of items chewed up in the yard,which is something she'll do when she get's bored. Poor baby, didn't have anyone to play with. But I shall try to play with her tommorow, Kenshin is just too tired tonight, these eye lids keep getting heavier. Well, I'm off to bed, and I wish everyone a good night, so catch ya later."

"event","The other day, I was walking back to my dorm accross a field and I saw this pretty red flower. What made this rare though is that no other flower was in this field of grass. Only this bloomed and pretty red flower was there. I wish I had a camera at that time to take a picture of that exact moment while it was alone in that field. It was nice day also, everything blooming. But that flower, it was just so amazing to watch it like that. I at first thought about picking it out and putting it in a glass of water, and taking it to my mom. But then I decided that it would be best to let it be, to exist in that same still and rare moment. Sort of like a painting. Oh, and then another day I was walking back and I saw this big and green catapiller. It was the biggest one I believe I ever seen,heh... The poor thing though was crawing across the street, and I was afraid that if I just left it there, then someone was going to step on it, probably most likely purposely. Either that or it could somehow get run over. So, I took a stick, held it right by the little guy, and he climbed on. Then, I just took the catapiller over to a safer place away from the road. He climbed a piece of grass,and I believe right when he climbed onto it, he started eating. I waved goodbye to Mr.Catapiller and then went on home.

 Well, the tests now so far have been successful and I believe I'm going on the right path. Still have a long way to go though. I guess that's just like the catapiller, except hopefully I won't get stepped on ^-^ Halloween is approaching the corner now, how nice. Decorations and such all over the place. Right now I'm pretty tired, I'm thinking about going to bed, but I still need to finish more work. Oh well. The Gamma Betta Phi meeting was cancelled last monday and will take place instead next Monday. We're trying to find a way to help victimes from the Katrina Hurricane, and most likely what we'll end up doing is using a fund raiser. I hope we'll be able to come up with enough money to help those people. We'll also have to figure out a way to send what they need to them. Not only that, but perhaps a source that we can get information from in order to find out what they need. At first Red Cross was suggestted, however other sources are also being investigated. And also, hopefully more members will join the club. But it's hard sometimes because people have classes, tests, and homework to get to, and that goes for a lot of people. After all, college is pretty much like a bee hive. *mummers under breath* Well, I'll take that back, for a lot of other people college is pretty much Disney Land to them. Funny, I didn't see a Mickey Mouse Sign anywhere, not really big ones that is...

 Ok, now on to personal life. Well, my puppy is doing good. Poor baby....though :( She has to stay home outside all day with no one to play with. Ohhh...., poor baby. I feel guilty over that, I mean yes I have to go to school for the whole week, but I wish my puppy could come with me instead of being alone for almost the entire day each day of the week. Because my parants have to work all week and usually a long period of time. My mom really worrys about her job a lot, and at home she's still real stressed about it. At least now I know not to work at high schools...but I never really liked them anyway. We almost go the wooden fence put up around the house, and painted most of the tiles in the house. It looks real nice.

 In other news, I'm not quiet ticked off right now and I'm fixing to smash a certain cell phone if it doesn't stop ringing. Oh, and I had some things,..well, wouldn't say some, but they were pent up inside, and I just threw them in their heap of mess into this poem that probably is poor. But oh well, I wasn't really concerning myself with making a decent poem, I just wanted to release it all onto the keyboad, so here's the heap of mess. And yes, I just free styled on almost everything in it, and even put words together that can be understood,but aren't correct by dictionary terms. And Now I'm off to read the rest of a certain book and curl up and go to sleep. Maybe I'll get to travel to Disney LAND! Yay!.....umm,yeah,huh. Goodnight.

{HEAP OF MESS}

 I wish,
 That you knew,
 That you could view your mirror,
 And from there see,
 Just who you really are and,
 Just what you're really doing,
 That you could know that you're not the only living being,
 Knowing that you're not the only one that can feel.

 I wish you knew that,
 I'm not an object,
 I'm not something you pick up out of a store,
 and that,
 I actually do mind when,
 you think that no one's individuality exists,
 except for yours.
 That no one's feelings,
 no one's self being,
 no one's tears,
 years,
 hurt,
 and freedom
 matters,
 except for your own.
 You anger when someone
 is curious of who you are,
 yet,
 for some reason I'm not
 entitled to myself,
 not to have a soul,
 just like yourself,
 not to be capable,
 Of any talant,
 Of any respect,
 Of any love,
 Of any reality
 Or truth.
 But yet all of that,
 Only belongs to you.
 That I'm an object,
 And I can just be replaced,
 And such is justified for your tastes.
 But if I refuse to just,
 surrender all of me,
 Then you choose to burn and hate.
 I suppose that's why you're angry,
 Because me being just an object,
 In reality isn't the case.

 And yet,
 despite that I actually am,
 an individual,
 a living being,
 flesh with sweat,
 flesh with blood,
 flesh with perception,
 That seems to bother you.
 It bothers you that,
 I don't bow to your feet, 
 That,
 I don't submit to your command,
 And that I do mind,
 When you manipulate,
 My own thoughts,
 My own view upon,
 my position in the world.
 And I do mind when,
 I'm supposed to be one of the many,
 fooled and naive,
 with false hope,
 such pathetic,
 And futile hope,
 In love from you being returned.
 And Yet of this many,
 Just like the rest of the objects,
 I am to be on your shelf.
 An action figure, ready to play with,
 then after passing of time,
 broken through,
 from flesh to bone,
 and thrown away.
 And since I'm inferrior,
 with no sense of the world around me,
 Or knowledge of what you're by truth,
 Doing to me,
 Then to you that's just ok.
 Then let me burn,
 Let me fall,
 Wave goodbye to,
 all of me.
 Wave with a smile,
 To your own property.
 And then come back,
 And reuse what doesn't,
 Come equal to your aristocratic existence.
 Besides, it has no sense of self,
 No reaction inside,
 To your inconsideration of,
 My place in the world,
 Of the fact that,
 Just like you, 
 I feel with looking to the floor,
 eyes down and drenched,
 To your expectence of my ignorance,
 To your mentallity that,
 Pretend and lies,
 goes to decieved numbers,
 Of freinds and Unaware,
 Temporary lovers,
 All those poor people,
 That you've taken away from,
 destroyed them from whole,
 Their emotions and sense of pride,
 Their future days of sunlight,
 Now only to be covered by dark clouds of rain,
 All because of your selfish ways,
 All because you put the word, ""I,""
 Before the decieved that think you'll hold their hand,
 All so that you can fulfil your own pockets,
 Your own greed for the word, ""Me,""
 To you,
 Just let everyone else sink down into the dark sea.
 
 And yet,
 you speak of having to fight,
 having to always fight,
 to be happy,
 But you see,
 You're only happy,
 When you take the happiness from,
 Everyone else.
 After all,
 You're of a superior race, right?
 Certainly no one deserves this happiness,
 except for the almighty you,
 except for all your dark clothing and so-called,
 needed material possessions.
 And yet how miscule I am,
 for all the glory of my raggy blue jeans,
 and yellow shirt,
 So that I may be sweeped off my feet,
 by your so-called snobby ways,
 and that you dress up as if you're,
 going to a wedding or funeral,
 every single day.

 I don't care,
 just what,
 or who you are,
 Or what happened so many years ago,
 Fought between our sides,
 I'm not and never,
 Will be,
 Your servant,
 Or allow you to dictate my mind,
 Because I'm my own idenity,
 And your wrong that,
 without you I don't have any chance,
 That I'm alone at the table,
 That I can't make it without a master,
 That only you will be surrounded by understandment,
 Surrounded by deceived groupies,
 All because to you,
 I'm just some low-life animal,
 But it's just like your kind,
 With your aristocratic nose in the air,
 With your snob behavior,
 To overlook anything that can,
 Step up to your face all of a sudden day,
 And by the way,
 Just to shove it in your pale face,
 Identity, Mind, and Freinds
 Are something that I do have,
 And unlike you,
 Which I'm very grateful of,
 I don't treat them as pawns.
 
 I'm not, ""ok,"" with your,
 perverting actions towards me,
 I'm not, ""ok,"" with constantly being provoked,
 Because you're pushing me to show you,
 Just how mean,
 Us so-called, ""pet,"" wolves can be,
 And I will bring you down with me,
 your neck ripped from my teeth,
 before you ever,
 EVER,
 PUT ME UNDER SOME LEASH.
 I don't ever,
 With a group,
 Try to bring you to hurt,
 Or make you feel like dirt,
 Or make fun of you because you're different from me,
 Because all I just try to do,
 Is make it,
 To survive,
 To make it someday,
 To what could only be found in sleep,
 And yet you can't even face me without,
 Little High School Freinds,
 Because Coward is the very,
 Definition of you,
 So what did I ever do to you?
 What did I ever do,
 To be treated this way,
 When really I just wanted to be equal,
 I just wanted at least to be more than nothing,
 I just wanted to have,
 Specs of consideration here and there,
 And maybe just seen for who,
 I am inside,
 By Soul,
 Loved by soul,
 And not by blinded outside view,
 As a person,
 As a living being,
 And not rolled up paper,
 To be reused ever day,
 Not as someone meant to be,
 A slave,
 Nor as some absent minded beast.

 I hope you know,
 That more than anything in this world,
 I hate you with such passion,
 Because I know that you've helped take,
 the lives of those people,
 And You did so with only care to yourself,
 And that is not by any means the way of a pacifist,
 no matter what you try to hide behind,
 A coward such as yourself,
 A hypocrite,
 So never mind that they had a family,
 Someone that loved them,
 Someone that needed them,
 A mother,
 A father,
 A brother,
 Someone that lost what you've,
 Out of cold veins from your body,
 You've helped taken away.
 All so you can waste the rest of the month,
 The Rest of the Year,
 And all more days,
 With your playing,
 And rantings,
 Of not getting your own ways,
 But I remember what you did,
 Even though everyone around you,
 Thinks you're so harmless,
 So pretty,
 And so...so... wonderful,
 I know what you did,
 And you know it to,
 And you may laugh now,
 with your little high school drama,
 above all the blood,
 from the lives you assisted in stealing,
 I know and someday,
 I hope you meet the loved ones,
 The ones you've,
 When you had no right,
 Taken so dearly from them,
 family away."

"event","""I'm just a dreamer, I dream my life away....oh yeah,I'm just a dreamer....who dreams of better days...."" - By John Lennon

    My roommate had me listen to a revision of that song done by Perfect Circle. Apparantely, it's been twenty years since the original that protested against the viatnam war, and so Perfect Circle revised that song to express that nothing's really change since this original, that everything gotten worse. It's sad isn't it? That isn't all though today. For the first time for awhile, I looked up from my work and noticed how much really changed in my whole life. I'll be 20 years old this saturday, and I'm wondering how much I've accomplised. How close I'm coming to my dream. Did you know that dreams can actually be brought into reality? However, most people regard dreamers as those who just sit around all day, seperating themselves from reality and just trying to live in that little cozy perfect home in that perfect world. Well, despite such claims, it is true, however the passage way is made up of two parts, imagination and science. When either one is left without the other, dreams can't be brought into existence. For example, if someone were to just have imagination, then the imagination has very limited existence, for it can either dwell in one's head, a piece of writing, or art. But also, if someone were to just work with science, then that person would just be assuming that nothing else can be possible or discovered because it's all known. But imagination is the key that allows the mind to go beyond just the known,see? So then,probably science would only go as far as intelligent design (read the news) or basically to the limits of a bank account person, taking into fact that a lot of mathmatics are in science of course. However, if both are put together,than there would be not very much limitations for the dream,for it could intergrate itself in reality with dreamers. Ahem,ummm,yeah,I sort of got off track didn't I? Wow,how did I get there.... Ummm,ok...well, back to whereever I was, sheesh I wish my mind could function properly. The point is, when I walk through these crowds of people, I see a lot of dreamers, but they keep going over a one-way path. It's either science or imagination,but rarley do I see the two combine. Oh,and I need to get my act together in my cisco class, I only made a 90 on that last exam,*sighs* I need to push harder, there must be something I'm doing wrong,just need to find out what it is, I can't feel like I can do anything right anymore. And yes, I know now that it sounds like I'm just complaining, but it's been quiet awhile since I ever did, so perhaps I have that right. And then there's this group of people which I've made clearly to that I wanted to be left alone, and apparently now they just don't get that message. I don't know what it is,but it's like a wave of negative feeling when they get too close to me. I just don't feel comfortable being around them. Something keeps telling me that something is wrong. It's weird, I know. Anyway, I had a good freind here last sememster, but is most likley at New York, of course,lol,I probably would go there too if I had the chance. But then again, it could be a dangerous place,except for the outskirts... I need to install Suse 9.3 Linux on this computer during Thanks Giving Break, and maybe,if I really can't find enough supported drivers for the Windows 2000 Pro for this laptop, I'll install XP on it,although I wonder if XP may have too much junk on it. But you know what, when I finally came back to the dorm today, I realized I really missed living at my true nature. I miss going out at night and dancing in the moon light amongst the trees and running through the wet grass. I miss playing and romping. I miss being happy instead of feeling nothing. Oh well,I suppose there's some sacerfices to make if you want to have a large difference take part in this world. Perhaps if I ever have children, they can have that happiness...in a better world then this one I'm in right now. I better go, I need to read the rest of that physical science book. I like learning, but I just don't enjoy the cement and cigerett smoke as well as society deteriroate. But as Spike Spiegal said, ""I'm living in dream."""

I'm hoping that after the test today I can get enough time to finish my essay on the anaylisis on the story of Young Goodman Brown by Nathanien Hawthorne. A lot of people had a common interpertation on it. Mine is well,slightly different. It's a good story. They also had an Edgar Allan Poe story called The Cask of Amontillado.

"event","Hello everyone, how is it over there? This week, I have tests from LAN 1 and English 2. Already took the LAN 1 today,but it's not fully graded yet. The english 2 is thursday. Goodness...I almost forgot, my cousin is wanting me and my family to come over to the State Fair Thursday and see the animal he's raising. I heard that the animal is a goat...or was it a sheep...? *thinks* Bawh, anyway,he seemed happy that we were going to go. I hope I'll be able to come Thursday, my last class, which is Cisco 3, ends at either 3:00 or 4:00....I'll have to ask,because usually I get so busy in there that by the time I'm finished all I can think about is food...mmmm....food. Anyway, speaking of food,I think I'll head over to lunch at the cafferteria. Hopefully they close lunch at 2 instead of 1 pm. And sorry that I didn't make contact any this week, because when I came back to college last monday, I forgot the text file that held my account information for this site. I got it now,of course as you can see :) Ohhhh, and an old freind came by and visited me yesterday. He's still in the high school that I went to, but I feel sad because here I am at college and he's still over there in that...that dreaded place. Poor guy, I feel guilty... But....I do feel hungry,off to dinner! *runs off*"

"event","I know...I know..I'm late....*sigh* again. I just had a lot to sort through and it took me awhile to settle in at college with all the school work and such. Not only that,but I also didn't set up my computer over there completly for chatting...until now. On good note though, I've been through some very interesting classes, including physical science. My teacher in there talked to us about Einstine's Theory of Relativity. From how it sounds, it seems that time is not actually independent, but together with space. This is somewhat what explains the gravity around the earth. Apparantly, the earth's large mass coupled with its speed creates some kind of ripple in the spacetime fabric. Think of it as a flat piece of foil that push a round object in. When I do this, wrinkles across the foil take place. So, when I place a small round object,such as a little ball, near the place where the other round object was placed, that small round object will sort of rotate around this place. This anology holds true for the gravitational force the sun exerts on the earth. The sun's mass and speed combines to create some kind of ripple in the spacetime. Well, according to Einstine, planets in space are supposed to travel in a straight path. However, when one of them crosses in paths with something as big as the sun, such as the earth crossing paths with the sun, then while the earth tries to move in a straight path, the ripple of spacetime caused by the sun's mass and speed makes the earth move in a circle or some kind of rotation around the some. The same would hold true for the moon that circles around the earth, and other planets that go around the sun. Even the previous anology that I described awhile ago would follow that same law. However,I'm not sure if that anology was such a good example,but I tried. Anyway, this theory also stated that when something travels as fast as the speed of light, the observer of the object traveling that fast see's it as going slow. However, let's just say for the purpose of this journal entry, that a person was traveling this fast. Well, to the person, he or she would actually feel like he or she wasn't moving at all, and instead everything on the outside of this speed would appear to him or her to be moving instead. It goes deeper than that though. Apparantley, time either slows down or just becomes non-dominant within the area that the speed of light is taking place, while time is dominant and moves faster for the person outside of the speed of light. That said, the person traveling at the speed of light could arrive years later and appear just as he was when he first traveled at light speed, while the person outside of the speed of light would be older. This being said though, I'm not sure if the time for that person traveling at such a speed would feel very very slow or just at an instant, since it was stated that time moved slower or just stopped when the lightspeed took place. *shrugs* beats me on that one I'm afraid. Anyway though, scientist have used devices such as atom smashers to break up protons into different combinations of smaller particles and had them go almost as fast as the speed of light. But, just when the speed would get so close to the speed of light, the speed of those particles would slow down to the point where they just stopped. Apparently,according to Einstine, during the course of speed of light, the speed of light never chances. I believe..the speed is something like,umm...3.8 times 10 to the eigth power,or something near that value. Anyway,while the speed doesn't chance, the mass and length does!!! Isn't that neat!? :-D It in a strange way defys most of the laws of the Universe as we know it. I thought about that part for awhile,and never asked my teacher about that one, why normally mass and length would stay the same while speed changes, but in speed of light it's the opposite. But then I suggestted that the speed of light is actually sort of like a thresh hold upon speed. And so, when speed goes over this thresh hold, some sort of major change takes place where speed becomes the dominant variable. It's so exciting!!! :) Anyway,someone will probably come along here before too long and correct me on some mistake or misrepisintation that or made...including on my bad spelling,lol, but I couldn't help it, I just had to share this discovery,hee heee hee!! *dances* But yes,on a serious scale,if I did make any mistake on this interpritation of that theory, then please feel free to critique. As for me, I'm going to bed. But I'll be posting here for now on weekly since by Monday I should have everything chat-ready. Later for now everyone."

HAHAHAHH!!!!!!!!!!!! *does flips* Ahh....that felt good. This has been insanity that I've kept locked up inside,and I just had to let it out somewhere ;) Ok, so anyway....ummmm, hello everyone. I'm going to visit the journals of all of you and give a shout of course. Nothing much else going on here except for just trying to get ready for a second time of college and of course taking care of some,ahem, persoal matters. Why can't the past just stay dead? DIE ADAM's past, DIE!!! *stab stab stab* Great, now I'll have to wash all its blood off. The blood, it's everywhere. Anyway, I'm off to my quest on world domination. Oh, and yes, finally got that intro CCNA INTRO cert done and passed, YAY!!!!!!!!!! AHHAAH!!! Ok, ummm,hey, look over there! *quickly runs off*"

"event","Hello everyone,what is going on? Since I..again,posted late,I changed my calander and my clock to a earlier date and time so that my post would be actually early,yay! No,I'm just kidding,but wouldn't life be nice if it worked in such a way? Anyway, I got the network+ certification,now I'll be studying for the intro part of the exam. Oh, and I changed my e-mail address. It's, ""windroll3@hotmail.com"" Oh,and Michael and Irene, (and anyone else who wants to come since people have freinds,lol) I hope we can be able to meet,umm,somewhere sometime this summer, I just don't know when yet. I've talked to Michael about it,and he seems to have some very interesting ideas. At first though,I'll have to admit,the situation looked hopeless since either almost no one has a driver's license or does have one but is a beginner. I already know that my driving skills are poor. *sighs* If only I could fly...perhaps I'll jump out the window and see if it works! j/k Anyway,if anyone else has ideas,please share them,because the more ideas the better. I'm gone for now,but I'll fight my way back to this computer later,lol. Anyway,as always,farewell for right now. Famine sighing off."

"event","Yes,the first post here indeed. Welcome all, please feel free to browse through this page,ummm,even if it's kind of empty right now,heh...heh? *shrugs* Let's see.....where shall I begin, oh, ummm, Hello michael and irene! *waves* And,ummm, the journal is now open I suppose. I'll start working this Friday, going to be an assistant to a network administrator. I'll also be studying for the introduction part of the CCNA exam,already got through the Novell CNA, I just hope they'll know who to send the package to. Let's see,oh yeah! I was at my uncle's last weekend,and he has this cool yorkshure. *please forgive for the misspelling,I know it's wrong! hump! ;) * His name is yo-yo, but my uncle like's to call him yosi-boy sometimes. He even cooks for him,but what's wrong with that? Dogs are living beings too, there's nothing wrong with it. Of course,my grandma get's onto him for it, but oh well,he can cook for him if he wants. Anyway,when yo-yo is on his back, if I wave my hand,then he'll wave back at me,hee hee hee, that's so cute! :) He's like, *hiiiiii* Let's see,what else...oh yes, haven't seen star wars 3 yet,been too busy. I'll have to go see it soon,perhaps next weekend,who knows. Oh,I bought this cute picture where it has a picture of a bull terrior (full grown) in a lether jacket, a spike collar, and a ear ring on his right ear, lol, and then it has these buttons on the lether jacket,like one button is an anti-cat button (no offense to a certain someone who reads that, cats are cool too) and other buttons. Lol,when my mom shown it to angel (my dog), she started growling and barking at it,lol, I suppose she didn't like that look for her. By the way,angel is a bull terrior. She tries to act like a big security dog,but she's still just a baby! :-D However,sooner or later she'll be grown up....*frowns* they grow so fast,*sniff sniff* Anyway,that's about all right now,I'm off to another planet! *ZOOM!!!!!!!!!*"

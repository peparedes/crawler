"event","<font color=#CC6699> i was gonna prank call claudia...

so i dialed her number.

it rang.

she answered.

then i realized that i forgot to dial *67.

so i just said ""ahh shit. nevermind. bye!""

she thought it was HILARIOUS.

i thought it sucked.

i was so excited... :[ </3



....so i called her back 5 minutes later & did it anyways.

she knew it was me though :/

but i still thought it was freaking funny! :P"

"event","<font color=#CC6699>I had a good day today :) i woke up early. ate breakfast. went to church. after church we went to BEALLS cause my mom got the shirt she was wearin dirty with the newspaper and she wanted a new one to put on. so we were there for lik 45 minutes and in the end she came out with NOTHING AT ALL. what a waste of time! so then we went to the mall to pay some payments and so i could buy jim his valentine's day gift! i'm so excited to give it to him! he's gonna like it :D after that we went to applebees and jim met up with us. he was supposed to work but he didn't have to after all so yeah. we ate then went to petland. there was this little fish dying :[  i said a prayer for it cause i love animals and i hate it when they die. so i hope it's ok <3 then we came home.  the boys watched the game. i took a nap. then jim went to andy's house for a bit. then he's coming back over here.

i just had this GREAT idea!...i have a book to read :D yesss!

today...i was walking in my art class to put my stuff away. and i was like ""gosh it doesn't feel like friday"" and then like all of sudden it felt like friday again. i got all happy. it was super weird? and i told aaron my WONDERFUL story [he says that i have the weirdest most pointless stories] and he's like ""friday just slapped you in the face huh?"" and i thought that was super funny so i laughed :D 

i have a little ""somethin somethin"" in my purse ;) ;) lol..

i'm in my DASHBOARD mood. which means i sing. which means i hate to be bothered :P

awwwhh i forgot to mention that my stepdad's dog BUDDY died this morning. he found him and his fellow kanine friend dead on the street. it's TRAGIC :/ and i feel all bad cause i never even really liked him. he was annoying but cute! awh :( i love animals and it makes me sad when they die. everytime i see them like on the street i pray for them. but at least he died with his friend <3 and they got buried together too! stupid stupid people who run over dogs!! >:/ gosh! and how can you run over two dogs??? maybe they wanted to commit suicide? cause that's all weird how they died together...??

today when we left from the mall. claudia was like ""i think they only hire pretty people at abercombie"" and i said ""naw uh cause i saw some fat ugly guy with big boobs"" and she started cracking up then i did too. it's contagious or something. i like making people laugh..and when people make me laugh :D i love to laugh...it's my favorite <3

"event","<font color=#CCCC00>I think this is gonna be a long entry cause i'm really bored and i feel like talking but there's no one to talk to so i'll just be a loser and talk to my journal :)

let's see what happened in school....
first period we watche napoleon dynamite. i fell asleep though. i figured ""i can watch that movie anytime i want"" and plus i was sleepy. second period we had a test & i missed claudia :/ my fffrrriiieennd! during lunch me and the girls were sitting at this table but it was really dirty right? ok so i saw my brother and i was like ""i'm gonna ask him to give me a napkin"" but i never did but i was SO thinking about it. and it was kinda weird cause later on during the period he came to us and asked for a napkin! i was like ""WHOA! i was gonna ask you for one!"" and he's like ""gosh, we must be related or something!"" the walks away. hah. then aaron came and asked us for a calculator. i was all excited that people were asking us for stuff! :D i missed claudia during 6th period :( i was all quiet and actually paying attention. and then ms. prestia asked me to read all randomly. i think it's cause she thought i was sleeping cause i had my head down. AHH HAA! :P but i was paying attention! seventh me and gene were out of class cause we just graded papers. first we went to the restroom. then after the bell rang we realized that our fellow classmates kevin and john weren't there yet to so we went to find them. then stayed in class for a bit. THEN we got bored and me and him got up and i was like ""i have to use the restroom"" and gene was like ""i have to go drink water cause my fingers bleeding"" i was like WTF? lmao. but our teachers awesome and she doesn't care so we get away with alot in that class :) 8th period we had a test and i didn't study AT ALL and i wanted to skip super bad. and i called isbel to see if she'd go with me but she didn't answer. so we both had to take it and we both failed. and eubin over here with his ""masterplan"" and he passed. lol. oh well. i have to retake it on monday. me and isbel had a serious conversation too :) i love those.

so after school i told my brother that i was thinking about calling him cause i didn't wanna go to 8th and he told me that he skipped his class too. he's like ""you shoulda called me. me and marcus didn't go"" i was like ahhh! i shoulda. i was all happy cause like, first the napkin and then skipping. wow! so i went to my mommy's work and jim was there all weird? so me and jim went to stars cause my mom wanted a coke then i ate and he took me to claud's house. then we went to stacey's so i could see the girls practice the dance for her sweet sixteen tomorrow. i missed her mom so much! it's cause me and stace used to like, INSEPERABLE! so that was fun. and beto was there. then beto dropped me and claud off at home and we went to the mall with her parental units cause she wanted pants. she's soooo picky i swear! lol. then we went to eat at TACO PALENQUE. we had a serious conversation about like family and friends. and it made me think alot. i love my friends and family sooo much. like, ahh its crazy. and just yesterday i was saying that i hate rollie. but when i think about it...he's super cool with me. aside from our stupid little arguments about nothing. like me and claud were talking about how when me and him are older we're gonna be alot closer and stuff since we're only a year apart. and i'm like yeaaaah :) i love my brother. then we started talking about our parents. and how we don't have like ALL the freedom in the world but it's ok because we're still young and stuff. ahhh...i love everything & everyone :) i'm in a super good mood! and claudia's my best friend! <3 even though we fight alot. lmao. 

so then i came home and i'm here. jim's working late today. 

i wish i could wear my underwear over my pants :D 

THE END! later bitches <3"

i'm not going to school tomorrow. because i have cramps, and because i don't want to. jim will pick me up at nora's in the morning. and i can sleep and be babied all day :) cause my boyfriend loves me alot & is extra nice to me when i'm not feeling good.

"event","<font color=#CCCC00>School on friday was ok :) same old thing. and me and claudia saw this little kid bust out an umbrella all randomly after lunch. we followed him. it was super funny & really cute! i wanted to take a picture. lol. awwhh! that's about the only thing i remember. 

after school my brother dropped me off at the bank and me and jim went to hastings to pick up his check, then to wal mart to cash it, then to chick-fil-a where we WERE gonna eat, then we got in an argument so we didn't eat, then we went to wal mart again for my mom, we picked up eric, took him home, then he dropped me off at home. i was crying. like CRRRYYYIIINNG. it's hard to explain. anyway, so my mom talked to me about it i kinda calmed down. :) she was going out to eat with my stepdad and she didn't want me to be home alone all sad and crying so she called up my cousin christina and she was at Flamingo Bowl and she told me to go then sleep over. so my mom picked me up chick-fil-a then took me to the bowling alley. i saw eddie. and i played with calista and the kids. then we went to their house. watched tv. my uncle and aunt visited. then i talked to jim and fell asleep. 

i woke up today around 12. colored with calista. watched cartoons with her. ate with her. and then watched more tv with her and christina. christina is almost due. she could have her baby any day now! it's so exciting but kinda scary! rollie picked me up, we got home around 2. i showered, ate, and watched tv. jim's coming over.

"event","<font color=CCCC00>First of all,the parking kinda sucks at school. me and rollie left at 8 and didn't get parked and in school until 8:20. boo that. oh yeah, and someon did take my locker so i chose my own and it's right next to clauds! :)

1st: we had an assignmet & had our own sex ed talk :D hah..funny stuff.

2nd: note taking. chats. sad, sad news about claud not being in there with me no more 
because of drivers ed :[ 

3rd: work. confusion. spanish. :/

4th: helped Mr. H with stuff cause i was bored. then i named his songs on Media Player.

5th: lunch. blegh:P i'm gonna eat pizza like everyday! haha

6th: english is always fun! not the actual class but the people in it :) we did and essay thing. something about THE ULTIMATE MEASURE OF A MAN blah blah blah. and i can't understand Mrs. Prestia's handwriting so i thought the word was ULLIMATE and i was asking people what it meant..then i figured it out :)

7th: chats and work. i forgot to mention that i discovered a very interesting pen. only ""USERS"" would know what i'm talking about. it's super duper weird! everyone was like FREAKING OUT. it's cause it smells ;) you wouldn't know though :P also, i learned that you get paid to live in alaska...

8th: i played with a gerbil. chatted and did some easy stuff.

i thought the school was like a million halls long but there's only ONE reall big hall. the 100's and the 200s. i thought there was like 500s and stuff? i was let out of my third period class early and i was like ""let's go discover things cause i've never been to the other side of the school"" and everyone was like..""this is the only side"" i was like..AHH HAAA!...i see :P

after school me and that guy i had a fight with a couple days ago are back to being friends :D it's normal again, just the way we were before! then we went to the pool but didn't swim :P  me, aaron & coach seggie just talked to whole time. after that me, aaron, fonz, rollie & darnell went to Burger King. i didn't eat. but i will here at home :D 

that was my oh so wonderful day <3...really it was:P

"event","<font color=#CCCC00>I went to nora's in the morning so all of us could go to school together. and we were all wearing green on accident! whoa! :D anyways, the traffic was horrible! and nora was letting everyone & their mother's go in front of her! jeesh, we were all telling her stuff. lol. i think they shouldn't count tardies first period because alot of people are bound to be late cause of the traffic. we're planning a skip day soon :P but we're not gonna like GO TO SCHOOL and then leave, we'll just NOT go to school :)

it seemed like a normal school day. but i haven't decided if i REALLY TRULY like the school. like, it's kinda OK but i miss the old one :/ and there's so many doors and they all confuse me cause i don't know which one to go through or were i've already been. luckily all my classes are in the 100 hall except for one :P and i don't know where to go in the morning or after school. like at the old school i would just wait for the girls at our usual spot but now if like no one's there you look like an idiot cause there's no where to sit so you're just kinda standing around. and it takes quite a while to get from one class to the other so even if like you WANTED to go to your locker you wouldn't have enough time. i think we should get more time in between classes. speaking of lockers, i forgot my lock at home so i couldn't claim mine...

the cafeteria is odd. it seems so crowded and i really like the old one:( but i like the lunch lines and stuff :) also, my favorite room is the lecture room. it's so fun!

i have a new spanish class and it pisses me off because for some reason i'm always put in SPANISH 2 BILINGUAL PAP. uhhh..hello! i'm NOT exactly bilingual. ok ok i kinda understand spanish but i can't speak it fluently. so yeah. i think i might have to change my schedule. but the class seems fun and i don't want to. haha. and some guy [i'm guessing he's like really cool & funny] was telling the class a story in spanish and EVERYBODY was laughing..i mean EVERYONE, including the teacher. and i was the only one who wasn't laughing cause i didn't understand what he was saying. i was sad cause i love laughing. and john was like ""erika, if you understood you'd be cracking up!"" i'm like SHUT UP :) i know it was something about a car crash and stuff cause i understand a little....cause i'm cool like that :D

i had to take NYQUIL last night cause i couldn't sleep. and after school i was trying so hard to stay awake but i couldn't help it and i fell asleep. so now i'm like wide awake. it sucks.

i learned a few things today :) 
  - NEW MEXICO & MEXICO are two completely different places. i thought new mexico was somewhere way in mexico...
  - manhattan is in new york. i thought it was like in louisiana or it was a state by itself.
  - south padre island was an ACTUAL island and the bridge is what makes it connected to us. that's so cool!
  - that TSUANMI thing. oh man :/ and that there was no animals found cause they knew it was coming or something? and my teacher said that the force of the wave is so strong that no one could out swim it but then did the fish swim? or did they just like float around?
  - paris and all those places aren't states or i donno what? ok...this confused me badly. stina was explaining it to me but i didn't get it so whatever...

jim came over after school and he got me a new book. it's funny :) i like it. but the name is weird. it's called ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD. i don't get it? but oh well.

you know what i wondered? why do people choose the bathroom stall that they choose? like..i think that's weird? my mom was laughing at me cause we were in the restroom and like i go ""mom, why'd you choose that stall?"" and she started laughing and never answered.

speaking of restrooms...i like ours at school..minus the window. cause i don't wanna look at myself in the mirror anymore cause people can see and then i feel conceited. :/ like, at the old school i wouldn't look at myself if there was other people in there. i would only do it if i was the only one. haha. maybe it's just cause i'm weird. but i feel funny looking at myself in the mirror when other people are around. unless it's my friends, then i don't care..but people i don't know..NO. and now even if i am the only one in there now people in the hall can see. so i guess i'll just never really look at me again :) hehe. also, we don't have those LONG mirrors no more. i loved those!

i have practice tomorrow and i lost my shorts. now what?

jim brought me whataburger a while ago since i didn't get to eat here cause i was asleep. i didn't finish all of it though so i gave the rest to the housekeeper. gosh, i'm so nice :)

how come i never ever get more than six comments? and it doesn't count cause it's my replies also..humph...

ok this was the longest entry in history. goodnight <3"

i don't remember what i was doing or whatever the last time i updated but oh well.
yesterday i went to claud's house for the day and then she slept over here. we had lotsa fun :D 

today me, claud, kat's mom & kat went to the high school. it's waaaaay too big for me! i'm gonna be super duper lost! ugghhh :X but my locker is kinda next to kats & claudia's :D haha. i should just steal someone else's locker right? or be like ""wanna trade?"" oh gosh, the football player's lockers are big enough for two people. we know because me and claudia went into one. hah. and kat had to go to the trainers to get treatment or whatever so me and claudia were playing alot of games with the rolly chairs and the heavy balls. haha. after that kat's mom dropped me and claud off at claud's house, we ate, watched SERENDIPITY, slept, then jim picked me up. we went to the movies to see CLOSER. i thought that movie was gonna be all great but it's like all perverted? :/ after the movies we came home. we were supposed to have swim practice this morning. but we didn't go. coach seggie called and told me to go. speaking of her, we found her classroom and wrote on her board! haha :)

tomorrow is school. i can't sleep! ughh, and i'm gonna get lost alot! i'm not really looking forward to it. anyway, i'm going to nora's house in the morning and me and the girls are gonna go together. i feel like it's the first day of school all over again! and also, cause everyone's gonna have new clothes and stuff cause of christmas so that makes it a little more like the first day!

Snow on Christmas Eve, in the valley. GREAT!! :)

Today was pretty good too. i got clothes, money & make up :D me and rollie and jim went to my other grandma's house on my dad's side today. we practically spent the entire day with them which was nice since i don't see them very often. then we went to my daddy's house for a bit. and we met up later with my cousins & stuff to see MEET THE FOCKERS. that movie is hilarious! after the movie we came home and jim left a while ago. 

everything was just so perfect & i'm all happy & stuff :D

ok where was i?...me and claud woke up all late and stuff yesterday. i showered, jim picked me up, we came back to my house so i can change and get ready really quick then we went to the mall so i can buy claud & nicki's gift. it took me forever to choose :) heh. then we went to HASTINGS cause jim needed to buy something for my cousin cause we're doing a gift exchange and for his cousin too. i was gonna go to nicki's house but my boyfriend was being all stubborn & he was like ""IF YOU GO OVER THERE THEN I'M GOING OUT"" and when he goes OUT he goes OUT. so i was all pissed off and we were mad for a while. cause i was just going to her HOUSE to watch movies and he wanted to go OUT OUT. i was like that's not fair! so i ended up not going and we came back to my house. i ate burger king and he ate my mom's tamales. then we just chilled here. he left around 2. 

I woke up at like 12 today, took a shower then jim came over. he was supposed to help me make the deviled eggs for tonight but like my stepdad wanted us to go to HEB for cokes so we did that, then we dropped of clauds gift. nicki wasn't home so i still have hers. jim was being super funny. he's all excited cause there's some ice in places. lol it was so cute <3 and he had some on his window and he ate it. haha. it was hilarioushe was being all cute & silly :] <3 :* anyways, by the time we got home it was already like 2:30 and jim goes into work at 3 so i'm doing the eggs alone :/

<font color=#CCCC00>...i hate sushi! well i've never even tried it but i bet that i don't like it. i just dont like seafood...period.

so i'm bored. sort of. ok not really. i just say that i'm bored cause i have nothing to do. which is boring. but i'm not. ok. lol. i don't know.

today was UNeventful unlike yesterday. i woke up at like 2. claud woke me up earlier and i was still sleeping so we hung up. then aaron called me and he said he just called cause he wanted to wake me up. then claud called at like 2 and that's when i officially woke up. so i called jim and had a quick chat. i showered and helped my mom make tamales up until now. i was supposed to go to youth group with aaron and claud but we didn't have a ride [which is exactly why i want a car] so we decided not to go. but when aaron gets out of youth group him and claud are coming over and we'll have a napoleon party! haha. i called nicki & beto to come too, & i told aaron to invite his cousin julio. so we'll see what happens later. 

jim's mad. he works till 12. he's mad cause someone's coming over. so i wouldn't be surprised if he decides to be rebellious and goes out after work instead of going home. fuck it :) 

me and claudia are obessed with lobsters. heh. BIG ONES that you can carry in your arms like a dog & cartoon ones too. lol. 

i feel like updating but i have absolutley nothing to talk about so this will just be a whole bunch of nothing updation. :D

my brother got this awesome CD. it's the singer from the early november and it's just him. it's just great! but like it doesn't say his name. it just has the albums name as the artist too. weird? i think so.

i like spreading that tamale stuff on the tamale peeling or whatever. it's fun. i finally helped my mom do something in the kitchen.

me and claud feel like dumbasses cause sometimes [once in a while] we feel like running and we run in our backyards because we feel dumb running around on the street. lol. i would run on my VERY long driveway but then i feel stupid cause there's cars passing by. so i run in my backyard. lmao. and claudia gets embarassed running in her neighborhood so she runs in her backyard too. we were laughing about that on the phone earlier. so we made a plan to actually go to a park and run when we feel like it. yipee!

i'm not wearng a bra and i feel funny. sorry :X useless information.

there's this empty pack of blue sour punch straws next to me and it's making me want a NON empty pack. mmm...sounds very good.

there's nothing on tv today that i wanna watch. i should rent a movie on those movie channels. or watch napoleon dynamite for the 50th time. it never fails to crack me up. i love kip :) he's so funny. wanna know a part that i like? when kip and rico are eating at that little place and rico is like ""what about your girlfriend?"" and kip is all like ""things are getting pretty serious. we chat online for like 3 hours a day so i guess you can say things are getting pretty serious."" lmao :D and the way he talks is just so cute! ahhhh....napoleon dynamite<3 what an awesome movie. the best EVER :D

ok well this entry was like a bunch of nothing. i might update later.

"event","<font color=#CCCC00>Yesterday was me and jim's 1 year anniversary. i woke up around 12, got ready and all that stuff then he came to pick me up. his mom got me a little gift basket from Bath & Body Works :) and she bought my mom something for her birthday too. so jim opened his gifts then we went to applebees. he didn't know but his mom payed for our dinner :) how cute. i knew but he didn't. and i told him afterwards and he was like ""awwhh mom!"" hehe. i got him a sweater and a cap from american eagle. so we ate then he gave me a promise ring <3 awww, i was so happy! it's really pretty :) then we went to PETLAND. there was a baby mouse in the snake cage thing and it was so sad :( it was still wiggling around. awww :( then we went to the movies to see OCEANS TWELVE which was kinda dumb cause i haven't even seen OCEANS ELEVEN. but i don't care cause i liked it. even thought the whole time i was hardly paying attention cause Brad Pitt is just way too gorgeous. everytime he would talk i would just be thinking about how cute he is and i wouldn't listen to what he was saying. and jim thinks im weird but i think george clooney is pretty damn cute also for an old man. ok but yeah. the movie was good :) then after that we went to hastings to rent alien movies. lol. i was so scared :X and then when i was alone in my room i started to cry. i hate aliens!! alot of people think it's funny but it's because they're all scary and stuff. 

today we had swimming practice at 8 but my darn brother didn't wanna go so i didn't. i wish i had my own car damnit! me and rollie went to pick up our check at that workforce place then we picked up his friend amanda and now i'm here. jim's coming over. and i think i'm going to claudia's later on.

Then i took a shower, then she took a shower than we started to get ready to go to the bobcat EXes game. jim was supposed to pick us up but he freaking FORGOT. i was so pissed off. so we had to beg my brother to take us. and jim calls me all dumb ""where you at?"" I'm like ""uhh, no..where are YOU at?"" he's like ""im already at the game"" i was like ""grrr, HELLOOOOO!!!"" lol. i was mad. anyways, they lost which i think is kinda funny :P after the game i went with jim to peter piper with him and all his guy friends. i seriously don't know why he took me with him. i was the only girl. but it is pretty entertaining watching them. they're really funny. so yah, i wasn't totally bored. after that we came home and watched tv.

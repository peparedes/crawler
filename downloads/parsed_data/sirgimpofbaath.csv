"event","The townsfolk moved with a purpose that belied their circumstances. Their homes had been taken from them so recently, and they were moving into an uncertain future. But the intimate closeness the town had--plus the assurance that a highly skilled troop of soldiers was watching their every move--gave a certain levity to their journey. They talked, and speculated, and gossiped as always.

On the edge of this, a tense confrontation was breaking out between two of the swordsmen sworn to protect the village. It was not a battle of steel, but of keen observation and heightened senses, a mental duel of awareness.

&quot;I spy, with my little eye...&quot;

&quot;A tree.&quot;

&quot;Aw, come on, Dar. No fair!&quot;

&quot;Seiryu, you've been cycling between tree, dirt, rock, and sky for the last twenty rounds. Not much else out here. I think we need to find another game.&quot;

&quot;Errr...&quot; Seiryu scratched his scalp thoughtfully, sending shivers of motion down the long smooth strands of his hair. &quot;I'm not sure I know many games that we can play as we walk.&quot;

&quot;It's true, most of the boredom relievers out there are meant to be played sitting down.&quot; Dar clicked his tongue on the roof of his mouth, a pensive habit that he had picked up from an old friend. &quot;Oh, I've got one. Have you ever played Green Gnome, Red Gnome?&quot;

&quot;I've heard of it.&quot;

&quot;Okay, so it's a sort of mental dice game. First, you think of a number...&quot;

His explanation was cut short by a shriek from in front of the two men. Dar and Seiryu, already on edge, drew their swords and raised them in unison, all sinew and muscle and focus.

A dark-haired feminine figure in white robes, ahead of them, was falling to the ground. In the moments that it happened, Dar knew something was not quite right, and not quite dangerous, about this fall: the woman fell ever too slowly, and a pointy rock on the ground in her area of imminent impact seemed to scoot itself out of harm's way at the last second. As it was, she was able to catch herself on her hands.

The trip slowed her on her journey momentarily, and so Dar and Seiryu caught up. &quot;Ma'am? Are you okay?&quot;

&quot;Oof. I'm alright. And don't call me ma'am, I'd like to think my youth isn't quite over.&quot; An attractive woman in her early thirties, Petra Moran turned to face the pair of Legionnaires and looked them up and down approvingly. &quot;You're both quite the dashing sorts, aren't you?&quot;

&quot;Both?&quot; Dar chuckled. &quot;Usually it's just Ladykiller here who gets the attention from women.&quot; A few seconds later than he should have, he noticed her unique style of dress. &quot;And isn't that a little out of place for a priestess to be saying?&quot;

&quot;Dashing?&quot; Seiryu mumbled under his breath, not really following the flow of conversation.

&quot;I'm a priestess of Tymora,&quot; she explained, as if that was the only explanation necessary.

&quot;Haven't heard of him. Her? It?&quot;

&quot;Her. She's a luck goddess.&quot; Petra reached inside her robed and pulled out a talisman on a chain. The talisman was a coin, both sides of which bore the profile of her smiling deity. &quot;And as luck is one of those things that follows those who live full and fulfilling lives... My order isn't particularly keen on restrictive strictures.&quot; She winked at him. &quot;Unlike your line of work, I'm sure.&quot;

&quot;Hey, now,&quot; Dar began defensively, &quot;if we did nothing but follow orders we wouldn't be here.&quot;

She laughed again. Dar thought that she had quite a nice laugh. Must be all the luck she lived with. &quot;I figured as much. You look like a bit of a rogue... more so than a rank-and-file hack-and-slash fellow, anyway.&quot;

&quot;He was a rogue, once,&quot; Seiryu chimed in. &quot;Ran away from home to work for the mob and everything.&quot;

Petra raised an eyebrow.

&quot;Thank you, Seiryu,&quot; Dar muttered in mild irritation. &quot;Hey, don't look at me like that. My parents were horrible, and I didn't hurt anyone who didn't need hurting.&quot;

&quot;Hey, I wouldn't be one to judge. My father was a mage of some renown, and... well, let's just say you know you're a strange sort of teenager when your idea of rebellion is to run off and join a religious movement.&quot;

&quot;Well, at least she's a luck goddess, right?&quot; Seiryu grinned. &quot;You could have done a lot worse things!&quot;

&quot;I wasn't brought into the fold of Tymora's grace until much later,&quot; she said regretfully. &quot;This was a... different sort of religious movement.&quot;

Something about the domain of Petra's goddess finally clicked in Dar's brain. &quot;Luck... That's how you avoided that fall!&quot;

&quot;Tymora's grace does occasionally protect me from harm without my conscious intent, yes. One of the little perks of taking up the oath.&quot;

&quot;Oath?&quot; Sei asked. &quot;But I thought you said your order wasn't restrictive.&quot;

&quot;The oath mainly binds us to worship Tymora and spread good news and good fortune wherever we go,&quot; she said. &quot;Also, we're not allowed to gamble, but that's more of a fairness issue than anything.&quot;

Dar started to say something, but Seiryu's hand on his shoulder quieted him. &quot;Dar. Something's happening.&quot;

Dar had long since learned that, as a sergeant, trusting his men's senses was the best way to keep them all alive. In addition, Seiryu's ears were famously sensitive. &quot;What is it?&quot;

&quot;Sounds like a fight. Something else going on, too, something strange.&quot;

Just then there was a loud swooshing sound and a flash of light, like... well, like something strange.

Four fighting men and a balding mage in a blood-red cloak stepped out of the strange something approximately twenty feet away from Dar and Seiryu's position.

&quot;Oh, hey,&quot; Dar quipped tersely. &quot;A fight.&quot;

Two of the fighters pulled off to the sides to allow the other two--archers, they saw now--to pull back and take aim. Dar and Seiryu saw this happening and feinted to either side. The arrows went wide. Clearly the archers had not been expecting this level of sophistication in their opponents, but that was sure to change.

The swordsmen made their rush to cover the archers, who were nocking their next rounds, and the mage, who was chanting. Rather than do the smart thing and gang up, one went at Sei and one at Dar. Dar muttered a couplet under his breath--it was very unpolished and spur-of-the-moment so he wasn't keen on saying it out loud--and stabbed his blade along the length of his attacker's arm, hooking it under the elbow and using the blade as a lever to torque the sword into the ground. Before his assailant's eyes could even widen in shock, he stepped on the middle of the other man's sword, bending it and tugging the man down into the dirt in one action, before kicking the bent sword off where it could do no harm. Having mostly neutralized the threat, he neatly quickstepped over the fallen soldier in the direction of the mage.

Seiryu didn't take Dar's precise approach to the problem, instead favoring a more direct approach. He brought his sword up for a chop, leading his opponent to attack his undefended midsection, but instead sidestepped and rammed the pointy, heavy hilt of his blade into the goon's nose. The soldier dropped like a sack of cement and Seiryu rushed onwards.

There was a flashing, sizzling noise and Dar's view of the world exploded in a shower of sparks and fire. The lightning bolt forked from the mage's fingertips to both Dar and Seiryu... as well as the two archers and, curling back in an improbable way, the mage himself. The trailing shower of sparks in the wake of the bolt showed its path--it was also heading towards some of the villagers and Petra, but twisted backwards. Dar and Seiryu, both wearing metal chain maille, couldn't have been spared by any amount of luck.

Even though every one of his nerves was on fire from the electric onslaught, Seiryu staggered forward. Fortunately for him, the archer was just as twitchy in the aftereffects of the bolt as he was, so he didn't have time to aim for a chink in Seiryu's breastplate. Unfortunately, the arrow struck dead on, dead center, transmitting about a hundred pounds of force like a good solid punch to the breastplate.

Dar's archer was smarter, and aimed for the head. His aim was heavily disrupted as well, and the arrow grazed Dar's ear.

Both archers, being otherwise unable to defend themselves, fell quickly to the enraged Legionnaires. Soon they were facing the red-robed mage, all three of them blackened and crispy.

The mage, not having another spell that he could use safely, took a step backwards away from the two men. His foot caught on the ground and he tripped, hard.

Dar could have sworn he saw a very dangerous-looking rock appear under the man's head as he fell, twisting, faster than gravity alone would have allowed.

The two swordsmen looked up from the fortuitously incapacitated shaman to see Petra Moran in the thick of battle, holding her two-headed coin out in front of her like a ward.

Seiryu's jaw fell open, partially in shock and partially to catch his breath. &quot;That was you?&quot;

Dar laughed as much as his spasming muscles would allow. &quot;Let me guess. Tymora's fortune doesn't visit itself on those who are trying to kill her servants?&quot;

Petra smiled widely as she put the coin away. &quot;Lucky guess.&quot;"

<![endif]-->  <p style=""line-height: 150%;"" class=""MsoNormal"">Dar, Seiryu, and August leaned against trees as Meis and Cross paced uneasily in front of them. The briefing was done, so nothing needed to be said. The anxiety in the air was palpable.<br /><br />The tension broke like an old bowstring when Cailyn dropped out of a tree in the middle of the crowd.<br /><br />&ldquo;They&rsquo;re off safe,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;All of them.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Any indication where they&rsquo;re headed?&rdquo; Cross continued to pace.<br /><br />Cailyn swallowed, and looked at the trees around her as if to draw a bit of strength. &ldquo;South.&rdquo;<br /><br />Cross sighed. &ldquo;We know they&rsquo;re headed south. Anything more specific?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;South to Dorman&rsquo;s Folly.&rdquo;<br /><br />Cross and Meis narrowed their eyes in disbelief. Dar grunted, and August whistled. Only Seiryu gave no sign of recognition. &ldquo;Is that.. bad?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; August said in his typically laconic way. &ldquo;Maybe not.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;The Folly&rsquo;s a ghost town,&rdquo; Dar said. &ldquo;Dried up, nothing left. It&rsquo;s been deserted for hundreds&hellip; thousands&hellip; of years.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Despite people&rsquo;s best efforts,&rdquo; Meis said. &ldquo;Bandits and highwaymen and the like have tried to use it as a safe zone or hiding spot, but either they died there or they&rsquo;ve been very secretive because I&rsquo;ve never heard of any of them coming back.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;In short,&rdquo; Cross said, &ldquo;Either they&rsquo;re going to have to deal with a bandit hideout that&rsquo;s been hidden for fifty years, or whatever presence killed the village that was there to begin with.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Or neither of those things,&rdquo; finished Dar, &ldquo;because who knows with rumors anyway?&rdquo;<br /><br />Seiryu nodded. &ldquo;Ghost town. Right.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why<span style="""">&nbsp; </span>they&rsquo;ve chosen that, though,&rdquo; Cailyn muttered. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t make any sense. Why would they pick that spot instead of somewhere more&hellip; inviting?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;No choice,&rdquo; Cross realized. &ldquo;Can you think of anywhere else in the forest that they&rsquo;d consider themselves safe from the forces without? Dormand&rsquo;s Folly has a reputation, and&mdash;as much of a last-ditch effort as this is&mdash;that reputation can work in their favor.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Not only that,&rdquo; Meis continued. &ldquo;But we have to make sure they&rsquo;re safe from the forces behind us, too. This may not have been their best plan.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;And ensure their security.&rdquo; Cross scratched at his goatee in a rare moment of flatfooted vulnerablity, a few curly red hairs coming out and spiraling invisibly to the ground. &ldquo;Which means that we either have to kill the invading force, or misdirect them away from the abandoned village.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;But if there really is something dangerous in Dorman&rsquo;s Folly, we can&rsquo;t let them just walk in.&rdquo; August took a sip of tea, from a cup that he had apparently summoned out of nowhere. &ldquo;So do we trail them? Lead them? Give them a miss entirely and just misdirect the attacking troops?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;And we don&rsquo;t have sufficient forces to spare for any sort of splitting up,&rdquo; said Seiryu. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s together or die.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Maybe&hellip; not.&rdquo; Meis ducked behind a nearby tree. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s lots of cover in here,&rdquo; came his voice from behind. &ldquo;If we can hide&hellip; abandon the battle strategies that the Samaelian military drilled into our heads in command school&hellip; then splitting up can still work.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Ahhh&hellip; Street thuggery.&rdquo; Dar cracked his knuckles. &ldquo;Now this, I&rsquo;m comfortable with.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Dar, my friend,&rdquo; August said as he beaned him over the head lightly with the teacup, &ldquo;this is forest thuggery. Although I&rsquo;m sure the principles are the same. I think I&rsquo;m sufficiently flexible in mind and blade to pull off this sort of guerrilla work.&rdquo; August put his tea away. &ldquo;So I take it we&rsquo;re going for defeat of their forces, rather than misdirection?&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;If the good people of the village have no choice but to turn to a ghost town for their self-preservation, perhaps we have no choice but to resort to uneven warfare to protect them,&rdquo; said Meis. &ldquo;If that means killing Samaelian soldiers&hellip;&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;I wish we could tell who&rsquo;s really bought into their lies, and who could be convinced not to attack&hellip; or even join our cause.&rdquo; Seiryu polished his sword absentmindedly. &ldquo;Attacking indiscriminately just isn&rsquo;t like us.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;It might have to become like us. And we can&rsquo;t second-guess our foes, either.&rdquo; Cross sighed. &ldquo;All we can hope is that they&rsquo;ve been informed of the atrocities we were ordered to commit&hellip; and, knowing that, are attacking of their own free will.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;What free will?&rdquo; Dar quipped. &ldquo;This is the military.&rdquo;<br /><br />There were a few tense laughs. Cross cleared his throat.<br />&ldquo;So, now that we&rsquo;re all up to speed, let&rsquo;s catch up with Ms. Denen and her crew. They&rsquo;re waiting for us.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;</p>"

Fine, whatever.<br />The problem is the other things that were being voted in while everyone was focused on the Presidential election.<br />AZ-102 passed.<br />FL-2 passed.<br />The Arkansas gay adoption ban passed.<br />And most horrifyingly of all, CA-8 passed, rendering thousands of legal same-sex marriages null and void.<br />The cause of freedom took four huge steps backwards yesterday. We're going to look back on this day in shame. Just like we see &quot;Whites Only&quot; bathrooms and cringe, we're going to see &quot;straight only&quot; marriage as a historical <em>embarrassment.</em><br />"

It was really interesting to see the two groups communicating, but ultimately it was like everyone was trying to set everyone else on fire with their minds.<br />The three anti-102 panelists were rad, though. The fact that there was an actual LGBTQ&nbsp;person on the panel seemed to <em>really</em> unnerve two of the three pro-102 panelists, as did the fact that Neal Lester kept alluding to the parallels between the racial civil rights movement and the sexual civil rights movement. As did, for that matter, the fact that there was a <em>very</em> well-prepared cultural anthropologist on the left side of the table.<br />Body language is a funny thing.<br />"

YEAH!&nbsp;GO&nbsp;MATT! Brain-mojo ftw!
Sylar, you're either an idiot or a master strategist. I&nbsp;can't tell which.
Mohinder, what the hell.
Arthur is killing off season 2's villains like he had a personal grudge. I wonder if there's a writer on board there?
Peter, this is the first step you have to being less than a total idiot. Don't screw it up.
Nathan? Dude? Enthusiasm is great, but you gonna get yo'self killed.
And finally... Daphne, Matt can STILL&nbsp;READ&nbsp;YOUR&nbsp;MIND. Why are you trying to play him? Whose side are you on?"

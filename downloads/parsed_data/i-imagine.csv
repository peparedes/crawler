so in the dream i fall madly in love with this guy. i don't remember anything about him other than i was entranced by him. so entranced it seems that to be with him, i let him gouge my eyes out with a piece of sharp steel. he did this at this gathering of my friends and family where this whole weird ass dream took place. i think it was a steak house.......no.........maybe it was his house, because there were pictures of all his ex-wives on the wall. amongst these photos was a series of a thigh and one buttock of a&nbsp; obvious corpse mostly buried in sand or mud. i think that was when i started getting suspicious (of course for some reason i wasn't suspicious when he gouged out my eyes). my eyes must have healed a bit even though they were big bloody caverns because i certainly saw those photos and even the description underneath of them that said she died in a bicycle accident. anyway.......i suppose i must have not acted as lovey dovey after i saw the photos of his murdered wife because he killed me...with a metal rod down the throat......in front of my friends and family. they did try and warn me that he was a douchebag beforehand. did i listen? nooooooooooo! i really need to stop reading rotten daily news. so yeah. that was last nite's dream.


oh, we've been youtubing the past week or so.....you should check us out. well me and the lo that is......not some ficticious (i hope) homocidal eye-gouging seducter and me.&nbsp; look us up kytiffy and IamLolaDC 


peace and sweet dreams.&nbsp;"

"event","i got the cabin! yipee!!!! i got the call today and i sign the lease on monday. the landlord said his girlfriend fell in love with lola. thanx, baby! now all i have to do is come up with about $800 in two days over a holiday weekend. anyone need a blowjob? crack cocaine? okay, so it's not real crack cocaine, but i can get you lots and you can fool your crackhead friends with it. everyone loves a great &quot;haha, i got you&quot; when they go to buy crack cocaine. hey, i wonder how many times i can casually mention crack cocaine in this post? laugh out loud, as the kiddies say. 

so dungeons and dragons tomorrow. i get to try out my new dice. they are sweet.&nbsp; i should really pack and clean also. i'm going to move. i'm going to move. 

oh yeah, it's snowing like a son of a bitch right now. we've got like a foot so far. it's pretty trippy if you ask me. i know you didn't though. oh well. we had a bear of a time trying to get our bikes through it this morning. hopefully this time next week, we'll be just walking across a parking lot. hahahahahaha!!!!! oh death, cast your shadow not here against my jubilant face!

hmm....i think that may have been the weirdest thing i've said in a while. perhaps i should lay off the crack cocaine for a while!"

*counts on fingers*

14 years since my last confession

ummmm.........so i did something that goes against my values and i find i have been doing it a *lot* more lately. 

so here it goes.........


sometimes i take showers, just so i can sing in them

*pouts*

i know it wastes water, but the acoustics, the freedom, the privacy it affords, is fucking priceless!

sometimes i actually shower like 2 or 3 times a day just to try and get a song out of my head!

tonite i got really frisky. i sang rocky horror songs. i time warped. i tap danced. then i moved on to janis joplin and my death metal version of mercedes benz. i wasted gallons of water in a desert region. i need to say hail marys and our fathers, i know it. 

no!!!!!!

i need to go to confession, for rizza.

i started obsessing about this around leap day. you see, i think every leap day you should do something you wouldn't do but once every four years. i never made it to confession, it seems i had family issues at the time. but damnit, i want to! what i really want to do is have a contest amongst my friends and everyone go to confession and see who gets the worst penance.&nbsp; really i just want to hit on a priest while in a confessional while a couple of mormon missionaries watch. maybe a nun too. grrrrr...

good nite!"

"event","or is that just a fast moving train? 

so my lease here is up on the 25th. i just went to look at a one room cabin today. the housing here is uber competitive, i.e. nobody can find affordable housing, so any rental that opens up, everyone jumps on it. well the cabin is over $100 cheaper than what i'm paying now. when i first found out the address and peeped in the window, i was a little discouraged. it was not very big at all. the thought of sharing a room with lola scares the crap out of me. how the hell am i ever going to get my groove on with my kid in the room?? but then i took the tour. lots of nooks and crannies and.........dadadada............access to the storage space. the garage!!!! that damn thing is as big as the cabin. simple, yo! i just put my extra futon matress out there and viola! instant privacy. plus there's a work bench, shelving, hooks.....one could think of some pretty kinky shit to do with all that. best of all, no little neighbor girls to cut my screens up, shit in my yard, steal and ruin lola's recital dress. now comes the hard part.....waiting for ol' dude to make his decision. will i get it or no? stay tuned for tomorrow's episode of&nbsp; &quot;how will the tiffany overcome the financial crisis?&quot;"

"event","misery loves company and it seems i will have a lot more friends once the economy collapses, or should i say&nbsp; once people realize it's already collapsed. ahh.....even as i type this gw is on the radio reassuring everyone that it's going to be okay. rolling on the floor laughing my fucking ass off, as the kids say. hey, how often do you hear about countries going bankrupt? i shouldn't be so chipper about all this, i know. common people are going to be hurting more and more in the next few weeks........months........years. right now it's the pholks who needed to be checked feeling the crunch though. i read a story about a guy who took out his family because he took a big hit and lost his company. i'm sure there'll be more stories like this. i should really boycott the news right now considering my own financial prediciment, but i am curious. i feel like i have the proverbial camcorder rolling on one of the biggest train wrecks in u. s. history. good times good times.<br /><br />the truth is i am worried though. how long before <em>we</em> become one of the causualities of hard times? it's the snow. it started snowing this morning. i started to think about how far from home i was on the ride home from dropping lola at school while the snow was stinging my face. we're in trouble. the one advantage that i think we do have though is that we are so used to doing without. it is just going to be tough as hell until i can come up with a solution. i need to either condense my apartment and take on a roommate or move. i can't afford this anymore. here's my ad for the new york times of lander - lander talk<br /><br />financial crisis special!<br /><br />howdy lander! just like the economy, i have found myself in a financial crunch. maybe you are in a similar situation. the solution: let's move in together!! i'm laid-back, eco-friendly and have a 6 year old in tow. i have an apartment that is tiny, but would be willing to share. your half would be $250 a month or we could find another place or share your place. the key here is reducing bills.&nbsp; my girl and i can share a room or we could get a bunk bed. i am a bit eccentric, but look forward to finding a compatible roomie.<br /><br />so, what do you think? you think it'll work? i should probably post it and see what kind of hits i get.<br /><br />brrrrr........i'm waiting for the snow to let up a little so i can go and start my day. why does snow have to be so quiet? i feel as if a zombie outbreak is immenent. i was pedalling on my bike and listening to the slosh of my tires on the road, looking and not seeing the usual cars on the road and thinking, what would happen if a zombie came out of that house there? what if the school was attacked? how would i get lo out of there and where would we go to hold up during the impending chaos? we are in wyoming though. i guess there are plenty of places to escape to, but where with enough supplies??<br /><br />well, i hope you make it out of this on top. i am still snickering at the news.<br /><br />peace, love, and happiness<br /><br />tiff<br /><br />"

is it a money issue. don't you think it would cost taxpayers more money in the long run feeding all those hungry mouths? is it because they are poor and you don't want to insult them? you're not trying to force them right? shit, i wish i had a chance to collect a check for getting my tubes tied. it's a lot easier then raising a flock of snot nose brats, even if you do get more for welfare. at least it would give the women an oppurtunity for education and better employment. <br /><br />i say take it a step further. cut some money out of this fucking war fund and offer the men money to get vascectomies as well. while your at it give all the violent sex offenders vascectomies. <br /><br />i wish it were possible to council people before they started trying to get knocked up. you know?<br /><br /><em><span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 255);"">i want a baby. i would make the best mommy in the whole wide world.........i would dress it and bathe it and feed it and love it and name it george.</span></em><span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 255);""><br /></span><em><span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 255);""><br /></span><span style=""color: rgb(255, 102, 0);"">well, ma'am, we do have this kid here who has never had a good mommy to feed it and bathe it and dress it and love it and her name is suzy, but you could rename her george if you like. you don't have to have morning sickness, or go through the pain of child birth and you get to be a mommy to someone who despretely needs it.</span></em><span style=""color: rgb(255, 102, 0);""><br /><em><br /><span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 255);"">but i want it to look just like me</span></em><span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 255);""><br /><br /><em><span style=""color: rgb(255, 102, 0);"">if you spent as much on plastic surgery on this kid as you did on yourself, it would look just like you</span></em><span style=""color: rgb(255, 102, 0);""><br /><em><br /><span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 255);"">but i want it to have the same blood as me</span></em><span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 255);""><br /><br /><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">*pulls out gun, shoots stretchy faced woman, blowing blood and brain tissue all over everyone in the room*<br /><br /><span style=""color: rgb(255, 102, 0);""><em>haha now we all have your blood, stupid cuntwad. come on kid, let's get a milkshake!<br /><br /></em></span></span></span></span></span></span><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">oh if only i ran the world. <br /><br />just to clarify. i'm not trying to be sexist by making it seem as if this is a women's issue only. yes, men do need to be concerned about the population explosion. when it comes to sex though, it is much easier for a man to get all worked up, get his nut and walk away. he doesn't have to carry the baby, he doesn't have to make the tough choices, so therefore it falls upon women to own up and take responsibility for what, biologically, is predominantly our concern.<br /><br />to summarize.......sarah palin is a dumb cunt.<br /><br />the end.</span><br /><br /></span><br /><br /><br /><br />"

"event","ok, i remember my dream from last night and it's not blatently sexual and it doesn't invove many people i know so here.

what i remember is that i was looking for some mangoes at the co-op (in reality my brother served mangoes for breakfast when i went to visit him and i have been craving them ever since.) well, i looked in the regular spot and all the mangoes had some fault. i probably could have cut off the rotten spots, but i wanted a good springy mango. i noticed that they had a whole bunch of mangoes in this deli type area (which they don't have at our co-op). the girls behind the counter (fairly hot) were really busy, so i waited. i felt bad for inconveniencing her. i really wanted some mongoes though. finally she comes back to me and points out there's mangoes in their regular place. i insisted on getting some good mangoes. i think she was nice and picked out a few good mangoes for me. i don't rightly remember. 

hmmm.....my interpretation: the whole situation made me think of my shyness and not wanting to ask too much from anybody. the fact that i refused the bad mangoes indicates that i have acknowledged my own (however temporary) assertive attitude. the fact that i was getting mangoes is indicative of my want for a healthier lifestyle and the hotty behind the counter is representative of either my desire for my own hottie or as a contrast to my own poor self image. i don't know. maybe i was just wanting a mango.

more later. peace."

"event","well, i skipped movie night friday. :o( i played magic and risk for about 12 hours straight. wow. i did build a pretty nifty red deck though. it's weird for me using red because i always love slow games, but i managed to do it with very few quick death cards. we drafted as well. i made a pretty kick ass deck then too. i drafted a solarion that got up to 320/320. i never got to use it however, because my bitch friend put a stasis cocoon on it! that's ok though, i also drafted a beacon of destruction to ensure i did not get decked. everybody gave up when there were only about 5 cards in our libraries. i hate it when people wuss out on games. i'm pretty hard core into the slow death. 

i wish i had got to go to movie night. it would have been fun. maybe next week. 

yesterday i went to lunch with my parents and the youngin. i thought we were going to a regular restaurant, but we ended up going to sal's chop house. my dad was celebrating because he's finally done with a huge project at work. he's been working long hours seven days a week trying to get lexmark iso whatever certified. sal's was pretty good. i wasn't dressed, nor do i have the disposition for fancy places. i had chicken in some strange goat cheese sauce and asparagus. my favorite though was when we went to baskin robins afterward. note to self: the chocolate dipped cones aren't worth it.

today i went over and rummaged through my sister's bags to go to goodwill. i got a couple of fancy business girl type outfits that i thought were pretty flattering. i helped clean for a few hours and now i'm back here.

oh yeah, also yesterday, my back started itching something horrible. it's like a painful itch. like i'm allergic to something or something. still itches. maybe it's the weather. 

just as a note, dreams have been getting more vivid. one of these days i'll figure out the pattern. i'm expecting a good one tonite. i may go to bed early. i wanna get some more dink in though. i'm working on cast awakening. i haven't figured out how to get past the electricity in the dungeon accessed through the bar. i might play kill the hippies though.

"event","wow, i have been out of my house more in the past two weeks than i have in a long time. yesterday was something else. i wore my cheap plastic sequined tiara everywhere. i went to see blade trinity with my bud. wtf, right up until just now when i went to make sure it was jason lee in the movie, i thought it <i>was</i> jason lee.who the f*ck is ryan reynolds and why does he walk, talk, look and act like jason lee. i thought he was hot in the movie because i thought it was jason lee and that he'd buffed up. now that i know this other dude has *never* starred in a kevin smith movie, but he starred in a cheesy sitcom, i am sooooooooooo disappointed. i think i'll still stalk jason lee. screw this other guy, hot or not. jason lee is the real thing. this really saddens me. 

blade trinity: *** out of 5 *s. eh, it was a movie it was entertaining, but the jason lee thing really messed me up. other than some cool weapons and hottie shots, it was about average. it disturbed me that they highlighted the dracula(drake) actor's cleavage. i've never seen this kind of attention given to a man's bosom. he wore lots of shirts open to expose his manly pecs and even a bustier / corset at one point. disturbing

ok, moving on. after the movie  we went to don pablos (still wearing the tiara). yummy food.

on to the 2nd annual john lennon memorial thingie at the dame. now, i've never been to the dame. as a matter of fact i've only been to three bars now.i had no idea that you have to wear something sexy. my friend promptly reminded me. well, i had the tight jeans on and i had the tiara, but i had this horrible loose sweatshirt on. here's my quick solution. remove shirt, put leather motorcycle jacket back on, zip half way. it works! we harassed one of our friends before we left. i think we scared him. it was very...interesting. there were <i>some</i> good bands playing at the dame. i liked some of the more traditional lennon tributes and the heavy metal-esque tribute. the country version, the hispanic version, and the blond pretty boy who got up and sang old beatles tunes written by <i>paul</i> i could have done without. 

maybe i'm weird, but i hate paul and i love yoko. yoko i can understand. she was crazy, she was a bad girl, and she worked for peace. paul was a dick, tried to manage the beatles and was a f*cking goody two shoes. paul was the one that broke up the band, not yoko. john was better solo anyway.

the other thing that greatly disturbed me about the tribute was the military presence. i guess the show was put on by marines trying to raise money for toys for tots. seems a little strange to me. i doubt they were anti-war marines. i thought they might storm the place when the band started playing ""give peace a chance."" nobody played ""imagine"" or ""instant karma"" either. how disappointing!

anyway, after begging my hubby to give me a ride home from lex and a quick stop at the house of waffles (where i actually tried a basted egg), i got home at 5am. 

today i went with the hubby and youngin to aranda's mexican restaurant in frankfort (mexican to the maxican for two straight days). we then ate at my in-law's where my hubby lives after watching jeremiah johnson (good movie). i tried to build a magic deck, but my dad gave me a ride earlier than i had hoped. i'll finish building my red equipment deck tomorrow. i'll probably be the only one playing type 2 tomorrow, so i'll probably get slaughtered. i just haven't played red in a long time and figure i'll give it a whirl. who knows, i might build a black deck as well.

i wonder what it's like being someone else? wow...i just realized the date. it's the anniversary of john lennon's death tonite at 11:08. i'll have to see if there's anything out on the town to do. i went to a little shin dig on lennon's birthday in 2000 at alfalfa'a and met all the nader folks. i wish i had kept in touch with them. if wishes were fishes, my life would still suck. i need to go fishing.

so i'm reading the bad girl's guide to getting what you want. i don't know if i qualify as a bad girl. i guess in a sense, yeah...i'm definitly a rebel, but i'm not into the whole girly thing. i like a lot of the bad girl philosophies, but i don't know if i agree with all of them. natural deoderant rocks! i love tom's of maine! dreads rock! (still waiting for my dread hero). i just hate love and i hate relationships. maybe if i was happier with myself i could fully develop into a bad girl. 

i have a horrible craving for warm pecan pie (derby or trackside would be even better). i about took my parents truck to waffle house tonite to get a piece or two. their hot cocoa sucks though (as does much else at waffle house) i should make a cup for myself, but i don't think there's any chocolate chips and whip cream. mmm...whip cream. chocolate syrup. cherries. 

today was fairly uneventful. well, except for some hard cor bad news in my sister's life, but i shant write about that on line. i guess i should go now.

"event","hey, i already wrote a journal entry tonite, but i got kicked off. basically i just reminisced about dan and his funeral today. i'm sad, it's weird to think i'll never talk to him again.

"event","hmmm...i have a headache tonite. i'm a bit nauseated as well. it could just be all the excitement good and bad this weekend. oh well. i'll go in order.

hustler was...err...interesting! ;o) the make your own dildo kit puzzled me. what really got to me though was that they sold chocolate cake. my friend and i came up with a wonderful recipe for chocolate sushi. 

movie night was fun. there was lots of yummy food. the veggie lasagna was delicious. i was a bum and didn't bring anything. i feel a little out of place when i go there, but the people are truly fascinating so i have something to motivate me through my discomfort. we watched <u>harvie krumpet</u>. it was a groovy little short film. one of the guys at the film night really inspired me. when someone asked him how he was he said ""flawless, as always!"" i wish i could have an attitude like that. i always say something to the effect of ""miserable"" or ""not so good."" i guess i've been a real downer for a while now. god, i've got to get better. 

next day rocky. rocky was a blast. i faked virginity (again). the security guard was a complete dick. he told people to stop throwing stuff. it's rocky for christ's sake!! people are going to throw things. i'll post pictures when i can get them off the camera and figure out how to post them. it may be a while.

i later embarrassed the husband at his place of employment by showing up in my rocky gear. i went to bed way too late.

then there was today. i went to dan's visitation. i was very proud of myself because i did not break down, which is very surprising considering how many times i've cried since i found out. i am really going to miss him. i didn't visit him as much as i should have, but i wasn't expecting him to just up and die. it was closed casket because his son doesn't quite understand what's going on (he's mentally handicapped).i wish i had got to see him one last time though. i saw lots of pictures. i think maybe this headache sprung from trying to hold back all the tears today. this was a guy who got my daughter a playhouse and me a cracker barrel rocking chair. he was a truly great guy! tomorrow's the funeral.

well, i was in the middle of a download, now i'm done. peace."

"event","i figure i'll post a short post tonite. i got a full weekend ahead. movie night tomorrow, rocky sat., visitation sunday, and then a visitation monday. god, i'm exhausted from all the images of dan running through my head. i wish i would have taken the youngin over there for halloween. i know he would have loved to have seen her. i guess wishing isn't going to help much. i keep thinking i'm going to wake up and call him and tell him the horrible dream i had about him. i'm so sick of not calling people. i need to stay in touch with people more.

i got a dress for rocky. it's a short black crushed velvet number with long sleeves. i got some pink and black striped tights to match the shoes i got the other day. it's weird wearing tights. i feel like a grizzly bear stuffed into a sausage skin. i saw a fabulous boa at paisley that would have matched perfectly. $50, man. i din't even spend $15 for my entire outfit! the makeup will have to make up for the rest. 

may friend returned the christmas trees he cut down the other day. was that yesterday? his girlfriend's mother said they were too sparse. yep, he cut down cedar. i think they are fabulous. they were going to tie them together, but instead they dropped them back up here. seems wrong to me. then again, i'm not much in the mood to raise a stink about it. 

well, i'm exhausted. i'm a wreck. i've got to get out of here.

peace."

"event","ok, i was in a good mood today, but right after i got off the internet earlier, my sister called and said that my old boss was found dead at his house today. they don't know the cause of death yet. he wasn't old, he was in his 40s. she was really upset because she talks to him all the time and had just been on the phone with him last night. he was more than just our old boss, he was a very good friend of the family. we had fun times together and he loved my daughter dearly. i feel bad because i know he was going through hard times and i haven't got in touch with him. i forgot to take my daughter trick or treating at his house this year. i spun till i about fell over tonight. i hope my ""prayers"" reached him and his family. i have been super upset since i found out. i called my husband but he was taking a nap. my friend stopped by to get a christmas tree, but he didn't say much about it when i told him. i don't know what i'm expecting. i don't think that i should be entitled to comforting, but it did hit me really hard. i can't bring myself to believe he's gone. he was quite a character and i can't imagine what it is going to be like knowing that he was here and now having to deal with the fact that he's not. last years scare with my dad's heart attack really got to me. i'm constntly scared to death of losing people. now this. i wonder how it was though. it must be exciting finally figuring out what happens. i hope he's doing well where ever he is. cheers to you dan. you were a great guy and i'll never forget you. i can't believe you're gone.

i'll miss you dan!!!"

"event","the wind is howling at my window. when will it snow?? again i have insomnia. found a groovy salvation army in frankfort today. i had been going to the goodwill in frankfort forever because it was the closest thrift shop too my folks house. they are way over priced. the salvation army had wonderful prices though. i got a funky pair of hot pink and black pair of high heels reminiscent of a pair of tennis shoes. i'll probably never wear those. i think they are the only pair of high heels i've owned in years though. maybe there will be another showing of rocky horror at the kentucky soon. i got some zebra stiped pillows and a string game book. The youngin got about ten board puzzles and a barbie *winces* van. she doesn't own a barbie, but she begged her nana for the van. maybe i'll make her a feral cheryl-esque rag doll with body hair, a couple of extra pounds, henna tattoos, and dreads. i've been in a sewing mood, but i'm too damn lazy to sew. seems i got something else, but my mind's blank now.

my friend called tonite. i feel so guilty cause i haven't called or emailed anybody in a while. it's winter and everybody's down. i've been so damn down, i can not fathom how i will be able to pick myself up again. but anyway, my friend has been trying to get a hold of me since the beginning of the month. i've had a crazy month, san francisco then tennessee, now back at my parents. i need to go home, but i really don't know where that is. i want to put myself up for adoption. i wonder if crazy hippy folk would want to adopt a 25 year old and her daughter. anyway, i know others have problems too and if i do convince you to log on, i'm sorry, sweety, for not getting back with you earlier. i know you're going through a rough time. we should hang out and burn stuff and smash old tvs with sledge hammers.  

i've been finding communities on here. i really want dreads now. please, someone read this post and come to kentucky and dread my hair!!!!! hell, if you're close enough (within 1 state from ky) i'll come to you! lots of great communities. i doubt i'll be able to keep up with them though. i need to be healthy and be able to do things like normal folk. maybe i'll go hiking soon. camp out in the cold hard rain. play naked in the whistling wind. burn things. hmm.....maybe that's why i haven't been in a good mood lately, i haven't had a bonfire in ages.

i'm so tired. i wish i could be content. i missed the sale at the five and dime today. i need some friggin fleece to make hoodies. i got patterns i just never use the damn things. i also need to go up to paisley and see if they still have that one armed shirt. i need to look at it again to figure out how the hell i'm going to make it. wow, temporary deafness in my left ear again. i need to get back to my ear candles. maybe i'll try to get to bed early tonight. sleep is good. lalalalalalala..............yep that should do it."

"event","you don't know me. are you really reading this? don't you feel the least bit of remorse reading someone's journal? i won't feel guilty for posting it if you don't feel guilty for reading it i guess. 

why are all these people keeping journals on line? what is all this crap about? all my life i've been scared to death to keep a journal because my mother always snooped and found anything i wrote. journaling is good for you, though. it cleanses the conscience. so now that i'm on the brink of insanity, i have lost all will to hide inside myself. i still am not going to tell my mother crap about my life, but i guess if someone is nuts enough to actually read journals online, they can read about me as well and i can get some crap of my chest. 

i found this site today. i was doing a search on hairy womyn, trying to figure out how to actually go to a water park and not get stares (i went to king's island's crocodile dundee water park thingie this year and it was quite an experience). anyway, after filtering out all the wierd ass porn and mail order bride crap, (i kind of wonder if i can get a nice hairy mail order bride - oh yeah, i'm still married to my husband) i finally found this place and all its wonderful hairy goodness. what wonderful folks. still didn't find out about swim suit designs. perhaps i should just do a search for nude water parks. not like any of it matters anyway, we're in the middle of friggin winter! 

i wish i could choose more than one mood. i really feel like crap tonite. oddly enough though, i feel as if over all my depression is lifting a bit. i think i've been hanging out with my husband a bit too much though. i need to get on with my life and finally convince myself that i can make it on my own. i get so damn lonely though and he took all our friends with him. i love the youngin' to death but i'm scared to death to take her hiking or camping without someone else there. not like my hubby ever wants to do those things anyway. already the youngin is three and i still haven't got over the ""i'm gonna break the baby"" stage. i just want to get my life back in order. i just want to scream. i can't honestly expect to get out and meet people and hang out if i mope all the time and i mope all the time cause i'm stuck in this friggin shithole.

sorry, done with my derpression rant for tonite. now it's time for weird rant. bubbles are round and beautiful, hills and mountains too, the world is a big beautiful ball, and cows go moo. moo.

moo.

i always wanted to steal a cow from a pasture in the middle of the night and put it in the back of a truck and drive it into a big suburban subdivision. i'd tie it to a tree in someone's front yard and put a tape recorder around it's neck that says ""moo, moo, moo"" very angrily. 

why isn't there a ranch where you can go and hunt cows? i think every carnivore should kill at least one animal that they eat themselves. it was once my job to steam a live lobster. i remember looking in the big steamer and looking into those beady eyes as the lobster slipped away. at least i could own up to what i was doing. i still want to go hunting since i'm still a carnivore. i need to find someone to hunt with that would show me how to field dress a deer without being insensitive about it. i wish i was a vegetarian. i wish i was a vegan. i'm getting there. i think really what i suffer from most is not depression, it's a classic case of white liberal guilt. oh well i'll still go on thanking my meat for giving it's life so that i may satisfy my taste buds. it makes more sense than thanking the invisible man in the attic.

quick god rant. christians say god is neither male nor female yet they still refer to it as ""he"" and ""him"" and *never* ""it."" most christians agree that we are all part of god, but they do not accept their own divinity. how can one man be the ""only son of god"" if we are all sons and daughters of god? how can anyone say there is only one messiah? would he only appear in one part of the world briefly? what about all the other religions who have similar figures? are they just heathens? i am not struggling with my beliefs. i just think it's completely ridiculous that people are afraid to question god. there are a few things in my life i was terrified to admit. yes, i was terrified to admit i no longer believed in god and i no longer accepted jesus christ as my personal savior. jesus is an ok dude, don't get me wrong. i love the j-man.  but  i choose to have more than one prophet to draw inspiration from. as for god, how the friggin hell can anyone put a name on something that has no beginning or end? the everything, the all, the infinite from which all things are? not only do they name it, but they personify it. if i believed in sin, that would be the ultimate blasphemy. yep, if all these guys are right, then maybe i am due for a visit to a lake of fire, but that's like saying that all the republicans may be right. both groups, christians and republicans (wait - i think they are the same group) may have an occasional point about some things. maybe we can all be right. maybe there's more than one truth. 

ok, god rant was longer than i expected. let all take of our boots and scrape all the shit in the compost.            peace out."

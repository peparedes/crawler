"event","Friday me and Kerri went out with these guys Jesse and Andrew...best just to leave it at that. Then Saturday i went out to dinner with this guy from Battisions Dan and we went to a party after. It was at this house where three of his friends live and it was so awesome inside. There were so many people. They were all really cool and sexy. The only problem was we were worried his girlfriend might show up, but she didnt. Yeah sunday i had to work and i did something else but i dont remember what. All i remember is taking leconche to the gas station because i owe him a ride and he needed cigarettes. Monday made me angry and i had to work and i had alot of shit for school to do. Tuesday was good, i went to a car show and then i went to visit Christian and he is always so nice to me and he always understands everything and says what i want to hear. I told him my problems and he made me feel better. Hes such a good guy. Today made me really happy, it was field day. Me and Tracy ate lunch together, and then Tracy went to play basketball while me and Kerri and Kristine sunbathed on the blue thingy with the freshies. My friend brooke was all over one of the guys in her grade and she kept waving to me from the other side of the mat. We got some great videos of pitacco and his golf cart. That was funny. Lecco and friends were playing some game with these plastic balls and you throw them or something, and one rolled over so i got up and grabbed it and Eric came over looking for it and i was like laying on top of it and he asked if any of us had seen it and everyone said no and then he saw it and was like 'Jen yes you've seen it!' like pryed it out from under me and it was really funny. MS was in the parking lot on trick bikes trying to do jumps. Let me tell you that was bad. Dan came over to our mat to say hi to me and crew and he had an extremely matchy outfit on. Then I called Ilya and Dennis over, and i asked them if they wanted to sunbathe with us so they came and sat on the mat with us. Ilya gave me his gold ring with a diamond in it and Dennis said we were married now. Then Kerri asked Ilya if she could wear his gold necklace and he was like 'sure'. He could care less and it was so great. So Kerri and i were blingin. We wanted to make an interview video of Ilya but Kristines cam was out of memory. That was unfortunate. Then MS came over and they started playing frisbee with Ilya and Dennis. Then Manuel came over. They kept purposely throwing the frisbee near us and we were gunna get up and grab it. Yeah the mat got really crowded once they all sat down because there were like 15 people and manny kept going 'hey maxima girl! hey maxima girl!' and being creepy as usual. Then we took pictures of them all playing hacki sack with a plastic bottle. Then i told MS i wanted some pictures of them so they came over and posed doing ghetto things. Man that one is going on Kristines webshots. Dave Garcia kept getting in the pictures and trying to ruin them. Then once they all went back to playing frisbee Mr. Fell came over and wanted to take a picture of us three girls for the yearbook or something i guess, and he was like 'okay you girls get together' so we all bunched together and then Ilya popped out of nowhere right when Fell was taking the picture and he was like 'Ilya that was supposed to be a picture of the GIRLS' and we whipped around and Ilya was like one inch away from us. It was funny. Dave wants me to go to some party this weekend at Rob antolinis house or something...but now he says its at the other Robs house. Anyways, after the day was over we all went to the parking lot and they asked us to pop our hoods and stuff, so we all did and lemme tell you that engine that rob has on the jeep is absolutely pathetic. Mine blows that piece of crap outta here. Kristines turbo does too, but it got made fun of for being 20 valve. Man MS thinks they are so hot with such hot cars but they have absolutely nothing. Ill take on Dave #2 any day. Anyways when we had all of our hoods popped and revving our engines everyone started coming over...like ALOT of people...someone was starting that 'assasins' game in our school where you get assigned a different person emailed to you every week and they dont know who you are and you have to try to get them with a squirtgun during the week and you can like go to their house and stuff and everyone was getting water poured like down their shirt and they kept getting squirted but it was awesome because the weather was so nice. Then we closed our hoods and me and Kerri and Kristine and Rob and Dave burned out of the high school parking lot. I was right behind Rob and Dave was in his car and i was tailgaiting so bad because he always trys so hard to get away but the jeep def doesnt cut it, and Dave kept leaning out of the passenger window like all the way...like about to fall out, and talking to me and blowing kisses and waving and it was really funny. Then of course once we got to route 3 i did the pass, at like 75 mph in the 40 zone to pass out Rob and Dave. Its so funny to weave in and out of traffic to give Rob the diss. Then Rob pulled off the road and was driving through lawns to get to his driveway when we were on his street, and we all pulled into his house. Dave just then realized my car was stick. Yeah anyways i went to Kerris after that and helped bake cookies for Alex and Jason because shes working with them tonight, except my helping consisted of eating the batter, but i am going to go visit her at work now after boring the crap out of everyone reading this."

"event","Agg im getting fucking attacked by pop-ups. Its probably the most annoying thing in the world. Yesterday was pretty messed up. I went on a walk with Kerri first, and she made the foolish mistake of talking with a child. It just lead to an extremely annoying situation. Anyways me and Kerri were walking around with sticks we found under this tree and we passed mark shmelters house, and his girlfriend was there and she hates us because we always yell 'MARK I LOVE YOU!' out of our car windows, so she totally 180'd in her chair and stared us down, and we just stared back because we are so bad like that. We were supposed to go to this bonfire and party that night, but it was supposedly 'cancelled'...but somehow we feel like we were the only people invited...So anyways i went to Jamie's birthday instead. There were tons of awesome people there. He had this pathetic little ice cream cake for like 1 person and it had to be split between like 25 people. Chris is home from college tonight. Yeah so the party was cool, i wanted to sleep over and not have to leave and have everyone else having fun, but fucking sat's were today. I couldent find a parking spot in GHS...so i had to like park in the janitors spot at the very back of the school. GHS was really disgusting. I took my moms car because mine had to get the emmisions test. Of course it failed it and now its gunna be 2000 bucks to get the cat converter's replaced. Well at least once i fix it the 'service engine soon' light will stop taunting me every time i get in the car. After sat's i did stuff, and went out to dinner and freaked out. Im so broke and im really scared about it. I dont ever want to ask my mom for money because it makes me feel really guilty. My dad wants me to put 100 bucks a month into this thing, and i just dont have it. I work all the time, but i dont have any more money. Im trying to save so much. I dont know, tomorrow i have to wake up at 6 to go to work. Im used to not sleeping these days. I want to go out so badly and have some fun like a normal person. Actually i do...on weekdays...and weekends too i guess. I really dont sleep more than 4 or 5 hours a night. Did i mention that miss Antol wrote up me, Kerri, Megan, and Kristine for going outside during study hall? Anyways, ive gotta go."

"event","Last night Ilya left 16 messages to my away message. Hes asking me how my day was right now. Anyways, it was the same as it usually is. Went to school, painted, interacted with you know who in the p lot. Man o man. The plan was to pull right in front of him and stop for a really long time and then finally have Kristine get out of the car. They had been throwing around a tennis ball, and then one of them threw it at my car. So, i got out and whipped open his door and yelled at him, and he looked scared and blamed someone else in the car. Then i said 'look buddy, i know that you keep that car outside and if you ever do that again ill personally dent it. Then he said 'trust me thats happened before. Then i slammed the door shut and steph was sitting in the drivers seat of my car looking cool. Maggie came out of no where and said 'Jen!' and threw me the tennis ball and i threw it at his windshield. Then everyone got out and me and Kerri started to peace. I gave him the peace sign and he peaced me back. Man fucking weird. Then we followed someone home, while Bill followed us. Yeah i saw him in my rear view mirror hanging out behind us for a real long time. We harrassed peds, then i went to Kerris house like always. We made fries and tried to get our science project to work. Obviously it didnt work. We went online and did stuff, until her dad came home and told her to 'get that crap off the wall'. Then i went home, and ya here i am."

"event","Today was pretty kick ass, as most days are. Ray called me at like 12 last night because he wanted to talk. That was weird, but whatever i guess...car season is coming up out of the blue like a dirty whore. Well today i came home from escuela, went to Kerri's house, Kristine was there, and we ate french fries and bothered Kerri to cook the whole darn bag, but she didnt. BTW Kerri im apparently a better dancer than you and have a bigger ass...you know who just told me...but we all knew that already ;) Haha that was so creepy, im just kidding...but he did really just say that to me. Anyways back to my day, Kristine peaced and Kerri and i went to pick up my paycheck, Kerris got a thing for Andrew at my work so we'll have to hook that up. Acutally Andrew's friends showed up and they were really damn hot and they had a hot fucking car, and they were staring at us the entire time and talking to Andrew and pointing at us...so hopefully they were saying something good, and not 'hey look that girl has a booger hanging out of her nose' or something. Andrew did one of his weird pressure points on me because i spilled lemonade on him. We made him get us bagels, and Kerri hated the jalapeno cream cheese. I like it though. We went to visit Dan next door, and Kerri didnt think he was that hot, just cute or something, but i have no clue how she can think Andrew is hot and not think Dan is hot. I think Andrew is not hot and Dan is, but whatever. We both agreed andrew's friends were on fire. So yeah, i showed Dan my prom pictures, and at my sexy pose i did that me and Katelyn and Rick were joking around at subway taking, Kerri said he stared at the pic for a really really long time. Thats amusing and que bueno. Afterwords, we went and ate our bagels outside, and when andrew's friends left they said bye to us, and got in their hot car and revved the engine...oh god...wanted to faint. But i also got a picture of that extremely hot person from our school...which was just great. It came out really nice too. Then i went to the mobil station...or whatever the one with the gorillas is...i thought it was citgo, but yeah, its the mobil i guess and Christian works there, and i finally got to talk to him again. That made me happy, hes such a nice guy. Anyways, gunna go to bed now."

"event","Prom was great! I dont feel like getting into it though, richie keeps bugging me about it. The day after i had to work, which wasnt very fun...but at the same time it was because me and Tara were going insane. Brian came in and stuff. Jimmy came in and he was like all over me being creepy. He started giving me a back massage but it was a really great massage. He got the oil paint stain out of my shirt from his battisons technology. I forget what else i did that day, as i always do. But anyways, Italo claims he saw me and almost pulled my hair or something. I think i might have done something with Kerri yesterday but oh well. Today was pretty cool...had to get up to work though. Garrity came to my work. She got a dozen bagels. Andrew was annoying me. Brian came today after we were closed and acted like a big rapist. Then i went to visit Katelyn and Rick at subway, Rocco showed up and so did Steph. We hung out for a while and i called Steve-o on Rocco's cell phone and told him to get his butt over to subway. Rocco said he was at some party or something. Then Rick got me a doughnut at dunkin's. I had katelyns jacket on that i guess i wore out of her house or something. So, i got another and came back and then took a bunch of pictures of Rick and Katelyn doing weird poses and a few of myself to finish off my prom film. I went to citgo and the thing is like redone and Christian isnt there. I thought i might cry. Then i went to Kerris, steph decostis is back from Costa Rica i guess. But anyways, me and Kerri looked at prom pics and stuff. Now im home, obviously."

"event","Today sure was interesting. School seemed like a dream or something, like it was summer and i was at some retard place. In art Kerri wouldent stop doing the pinky thing to hassan, and it was funny. He thinks Kerri is so uncivilized, its great. Im sure you are all happy to know my rubber duckie painting is coming along just great. Anyways, the battery light on my car has been on for a few days, and different lights keep popping on. So today, i was driving home from school and everything just started shutting off, like the stereo shut off and so did the clock, and then all the guages went off and i was like fuck i hope i make it home, but of course i broke down right in front of route 3. Yeah it was great. To top it off i looked like crap because it was raining and i was freaking out and i had rolled out of bed in the morning so i looked like total shit and everyone was beeping and my car wouldent start because the battery was dead and everything...so i just got out of my car and stood on the side of the road. Yeah people were so retarded, they like still stopped behind my car even though it was like 80 feet away from the light and it was obvious no one was in it and the emergency flashers were on. Yeah then Megan pulled up behind my car and looked really pissed and beeped her horn, and i screamed 'MEG' because she couldent contemplate that flashers and the fact that no one was in the car meant it wouldent drive itself somewhere, and then she waved and started cracking up, and asked if i was okay or something and i was like yeah, and then meg left. So anyways, i crossed the street to the gas station, and the guy helped me call triple A since i freak out when im stressed, and then they said they would come. Thankfully, Bill Leconche passed and stopped and asked what was wrong, and i told him and he said he would be right back. So he came back, and him and his friends pushed my car into the gas station, so nice!! Then he stayed there and noticed my car was manual and took out his jumper cables and jump started my car, we got back to the same place on elm street right before route 3 and we had to like stop in the middle of the road and jumpstart again, then i got almost to my house and we had to do it again, and then finally we made it to my house. Thank fucking god he was there because he saved my life. I had a hair cut thing and no car and Bill said he would drive me to it! Hes so nice! He missed some of school at good old rh alternative for it too. So anyways, we went to the place, and i realized i forgot my money, so he drove me back to my house to get the money and then we came back. Seriously NICE GUY!! He said my ex boyfriend got a real hot eclipse...which is seriously like my favorite...and he put tons of mods on it and he said that maybe tomorrow they would stop by my house. That would be interesting. I wonder if they will. Anyways, now my hair is shorter by three inches and most people wont be able to tell. Well my dad's getting a new battery for my car, because right now its sitting in my driveway with the window open that wouldent close. I hope so much that its not my alternator. Aaron of course offered to help. I think ill try to just fix it myself though. Ilya thinks its okay for him to refer to black people as nigger...he like thinks its not offensive. I told him hes going to get beat up and he was like 'who's willing to beat me up' He tells me that people are peaceful..yeah...Now he said 'by the way' and then 'nevermind' like he was about to tell me something really important and i asked 'no what' and now he says 'do you know how to put equations into a graphing calculator?' Now he asked me if i know someone that might be able to help him put equations into his graphing calculator.


Well, my car is getting rained in and im blocking it with beach towels grounded by my dads gigantic discount bag of raisins. Im going to go have something to eat though...no school tomorrow wooo!"

Ilya wont stop saying 'fuck fuck fuck fuck' because im telling him theres probably people in our school with aids. Hes freaking out because Courtney Mcdermott spit on his face and he thinks he has herpes from her now. He's telling me how hes going to cry. He just said 'i need you right now' and hes being creepy. Well mothers day is coming up and i have yet to buy a present. Anyways, me and Kerri and Kristine went to the local scoop today, and asked the worker if he took a dump or something, then me and Kerri went to walmarto to try and find a voice changer. Guze is getting on my butt about harrassing the hall moniter whenever he passes our door for art. But thats my form of entertainment. Plus the guys kind of a jerk...stopping everyone...mr siedman yelled at him for it. Now Ilyas refering to mcdermott as 'that blonde bitch' and saying he beat her up today.

Im going to borrow crystal's really short skirt so i can entice him. Yeah he wants me. Its so funny. Hes 21. He knows eric jensen from here.

Actually, i was about to leave, but then Lisa called me and told me that there was no school. So i went to her house and ate chocolate. We hung out and stuff, and Brooke was over. Then we went to Brookes house. She has this evil little dog. It kept growling at me and Lisa. We put it in the bathroom. Then we watched part of muppet treasure island and it was pretty good. I went in the message chair though. I really want to go talk to angie now, because right now im just talking to sandy and shes trying to make something work. But i want to go talk to her now. 50 Cent makes vitamin water."

I had to get rides home with Katelyn for the past 2 days. Yeah im getting one today. This will actually be my second day but whatever. Katelyn rules alot. Yesterday we had a mole encounter...and it was very very creepy. Mole is weird. He thinks we are his friend i think. Moving on, Mags and Kerri and Katelyn and i are going to the scoop for ice cream afterschool. That will be a nice kick off for vacation. Im staying at Katelyns for vacation, for i live there. The michalskis are going away though, to maine, which is sad because now i wont get to see THEM. My car will be done by today though, which is very good, so i will have a mode of transportation to Katelyns. I cant wait until that pool of hers opens up again. Oh ya.

I was at her house and it was like 11:00 and she was like 'okay call your mom and tell her that we are just starting to watch a movie. And i was at her house until like 3 in the morning and it was really dark and scary and we were in her basement, except it was different. It was like the brookmans basement. Yes, well there were like 50 other people in the dream too. And they kept morphing into other people. Some alarm is going off, and im scared for my life. Angie isnt here, i think that she has gym today. So does Lisa. So instead i am talking to Kate Miesner, because she has the computer next to me. This guy that was one of the people in my dream last night, he is in here and he keeps walking by me, but of course he doesnt know that i dreamed about him. Ya that was a weird ass dream. Im going to stop talking about it now. Okay Ilya and i are going out now, which is definately great. Im giving him a ride home today maybe. Today i also have to go to Brueggers to talk to the guy about working there. Im glad that i will be able to take their food when i get hungry, i like bagels alot. Agg i wish that Angie was here because she is my light and joy. I saw Dennis driving to school today when i passed him in my car. I waved to him. I dont know whether he saw me or not. I would ask him at lunch, but im not in that wave today. I wish i was. I want to see Ilya. Anyways, i have a spanish report thingy to do, so im going to peace. I hope Kristine brought the PEACE-at to school today."

Oh my gosh this really big George Bush fan just came over here. Lisa wooed him over. Oh my god im really angry. I asked him why he liked George Bush and he said that he supported everything that Bush said. And i asked him does he enjoy seeing our troops over in Iraq getting killed and he was like ""Yes, i view it as freedom for the middle east"". Then i told him to go away. He eventually did, but it took him a while. Anyways i went to the mall this weekend. It was really nice. I got tons of stuff. I got richie a orange wife beater with a heart on it for valentines day. Richie im going to borrow that for a while though. You can have it after im done borrowing it. I really want to give steve dizigikjdfklajkldfja a wedgie because he loves Bush so much. Jeeze Louise. Letgo wouldent get that one though. Anyways, today is v-day. Thats pretty cool. Ilya invited me to sit at his lunch table again today. So im going to. Im gunna give him a ride home from school too. YES. Haha okay anyways, Boris was talking to Ilya and he was like 'Jen thinks im hot'. I got very angry. Lisas lips are still really chapped. Ya we had this great chat room thing with me and Ilya and Dennis. That was really funny. Dennis was bustin out. Anyways, im going to go, the only valentine i got so far was from senora garrity.

I went to school and there was a pep rally, and the dance got cancelled. Thats kind of a shame, because i found out Ilya was planning on going to the dance because he knew i was going. But oh well. Randomly in the hall i walked past Joe Shanti and he was like 'so i hear your going out with Ilya tonight, first date!' or something, and i was like uhh no and he was like 'oh he said that he was going to ask you if you wanted to do something tonight'. But then he didnt, and i didnt see him all day. That was sad. At the pep rally, this girl did really great flips and i put on Linda's lip gloss. Then afterschool me and Maggie went to starbucks. I love mags, she rules. We had some banana bread that kicked ass. I went to Mandy's after. I went two days in a row...but thats because i didnt have enough money the first day. This time i did, and i bought pants and two tank tops and cool undies. Then i went to Marshalls and left because the entire store smelled like ####. Then i came back home, and my grandpa was here, and he got me a stuffed bear with a heart on it that was sooo cute and a box of candy for valentines day! Hes the best g-pa ever. Haha ya and then Kristine reminded me of the time 'crutch peaced in' hahahaha. That was hilarioso. I saw richie driving la impala to wrestling practice but he didnt see me. I forgot to visit Lori at work yesterday. Im sure i was sorely missed. Im going to the mall tomorrow because im a shopoholic and i need new clothes. I also have to go to that bruggels place or whatever so i can see if they will hire me. If you would like to join for the mall feel free. Peacin out."

Garritys class was okay today because we just did diarios and it wasnt a weird complicated discussion in spanish. I probably did it all wrong though. I feel like talking to Dennis because he is always so freakin blunt and it makes me laugh. Last night he gave me advice and it made me laugh...ya Dennis i bet your happy about being in my journal. Lisas got a hat on. Pittacco just got some award and it said it over the loud speaker. I think i might start my lab report now.

Im upset im no longer in his gym class, and instead i have drug ed where we watch movies and every class i lay down on the bench press and fall asleep. Its not my fault that the lights are turned off and im conveniently in the back. Who can help but fall asleep?? Sometimes i worry who uses it...but sleep is good. Richies pal is being weird. Poor guy. Im dressed in all pink today because I went to Kerri's house and we were being weird and i tried on this shirt she had and it was weird and pink with black ribbon and it has this french on it and this french woman with a dog and it says 'oh la la'. Then I have that pink Boston Red Sox hat on and i have this pink purse that she gave me. Its Erins. I put some ball that we found in Erins drawer in the purse, and Kerri gave me her fluffy pen in Spanish. By the way Spanish sucked so much. I failed the test i think. I kept sneezing too. I hope that i contaminated the paper and Garrity gets sick. Then at least my sickness would be worth something. Then she could be absent and i could be happy for the lack of having to do real spanish. I found this perfume to show Maria. I did and she loved it. She said it smelled very pretty. I saw Ilya in the hall. He looked hot. I wish that i had second wave more so i could go visit at that table. Its a great table.  I feel really weird today. I dont think that we will have school tomorrow. Ilya hopes we have a day off too. I wish he was in library study so that i could talk to him right now. Im really bored. Ya you probably think im insane. Well guess what, I AM. Ya im really creepy like that. Im already getting attatched and its weird. I like talked to him once and then online a few times. Okay enough, really, i need to stop being weird. Anyways, i hope things work out for you richie pal and she goes to prom with you. That would be cute. I got cough drops, and Sandy is sitting next to me. Then theres this guy and then Lisa. Lisa is the only one besides me with a hat here. Boris is in here. Bublick has a feather hat. Im faking that im typing a report. Im not. Its in word and i keep clicking back to it when bublick comes over. Its from freshman year. Im really bored if you cant tell...im probably going to end up taking another quiz. I have to do something tonight or im going to die. Boris is staring. Im going to go slap him. He wont stop staring and im pretending i dont see him but i do."

Whoever uses the computer next will get sick, and i hope its someone stupid. Not much has happened lately...actually it has. Me and Kristine and Kerri and Boris and Maggie went to the local scoop. Boris was weird as always. I SAW CHRISTIAN AGAIN!! I havent seen him in forever. Ya hes the guy that works at the mobil station on route 3 if you didnt know. Hes so nice. Ya i havent seen him since like the end of summer. He told me how Louis moved to Mass because thats where his lover is. Ya Ilya is really fucking hot. I like him alot. Last night i was talking to him online for like 2 hours...just because im weird. Hes so cute! He was talking in proper english. Haha he fucking rocks. Ya hes really funny too. I would tell you what he said...but ill just tell you later instead of here if you really want to know. Aka people like Agatha. I love her! Dennis got a haircut and his ear pierced. The library is so creepy...and i hate it. I had to cough so bad a few seconds ago and it wouldent go away and i felt like i was gunna puke. I hate being sick so much. I dont like all the people. I wish i just had a sane computer. Some people really overdue pajama day. But i like my pajama pants..they are nice. I burnt my tounge last night. I sneezed just now and the guy sitting next to me said bless you. Que nice. Moving on, Mags is going to prom with Buananata or however you spell it. Yep shes very happy. Hopefully i will go with Ilya. Maria is in his science class and she said he was talking about me and she told him he should ask me to winter homecoming and she said he was nervous and he said maybe. I kinda hope he does...but at the same time i dont know. Dances are creepy to go with a guy. But i wouldent mind going with him. Then all of my friends could meet him. Im rambling on and your probably really bored...im going to take a quiz and then put it in here maybe because im that bored."

Ya so anyways im in the library...its second period...im really scared because i left my drink unattended and boris might try to put something in it, knowing him. Ya him and all of his friends are crowded around this table. I went to the swim meet yesterday. Ya that was great. I hate my new schedule so much. Anyways, yesterday Maria handed over those apology cakes. Katelyn was sick, so i went to her house to go visit her afterschool. I kind of hoped that Dennis or Richie would be outside for some reason...probably because i was extremely bored...but they werent. I dont even think that Dennis was home. I bet Richie was. Ya Kristine sent me this pic of her lover as a child. Then she sent me a picture of Richie when he was in elementry school. It was great. Lisa is typing her spanish homework and trying to put it in a really big font so it looks like she did alot. Its not working...its like one sentence. Ya so Dennis said that this kid thinks im hot. He was supposed to call me last night or something...Dennis gave him my cell phone number. I dont know...i was very busy last night...he may have called...except my cell phone was off for a really long time, or maybe he didnt call. Im supposed to sit with them at lunch next time i have second wave. I dont think that Dennis's girlfriend will like me sitting with him very much. Clyde looks like hes in the mafia. Big time. Ya im staring at him right now. Since Dennis couldent tell me the guys name, he kept spelling it Eilileia and i was like how the fuck do you pronounce that...so ya i had to ask Boris sinced hes Russian and he knows the names like bubs and he said that its Ilya. That was a hell of a less confusing than whatever Dennis said. Wow boris is great. He made me put in my profile how much he wants to bang kerri, so i did and kerri didnt like it very much. Im going to buy school supplies right after school, concidering i need them. My mom has been a total bitch lately. Shes just a bitch. I hate her. I wanna go shake my ass on block...but i have to wait until summer. I cant wait for that though...with me and Kerri and Maggies plan and all. Erik Lecco keeps iming me in case you wanted to know that Kristine. He asked if i told you about what he says in the conversations. Hes probably reading this right now. He seemed pretty happy that the whole plan for winter homecoming with surrounding cwutch and me and you and Kerri dancing with him at the same time was off. I dont know where Boris is...i cant see him and im afraid hes touching my stuff. Im really afraid bublick will get her hands on this journal entry for some reason. Garritys fly was unzipped today and it was gross. Time to go work on my spanish essay about the secret transvestite Gypsy."

Katelyn and Maggie and Lisa Smith and Dave Garcia were also getting their licenses. So anyways, when i got there, Sebby said the DMV people were running late. So me and Lisa and Katelyn and Maggie decided to go to Bobs and eat stuff. So we went, Katelyn didnt have anything. She was nervous. But ya the rest of us pigged out. Vicky just looked at my computer and thought i was talking about bobs discount furniture and she was laughing. Nope it is bobs coffee shop. Ya so we went there, and then went back, and then Dave and i had a pencil war and Sebby got mad. There were these people that were foreign that smelled bad. Ya Dave showed me his fake birth cirtificate. Hes so cool. SO anyways ya we all passed but all the foreign people failed. I felt bad for them. They were trying to cheat. Then the DMV guy got them in trouble. Ya so then we drove and got the license, and then we were supposed to go on friday to get it. But it was closed. So all weekend i had to continue risking my ass driving without a license. Me and Kerri went to starbucks friday night and Dave and his friend showed up and we played cards with them. They got these really weird coffee shots and i made fun of them. Ya i said they were gay because they came to starbucks. I was only kidding though. Ya then Kerri came over, and we hung out. Ya we found my dads counterfeit money. That was pretty cool. Ya it looks so real. You cant tell the difference. Um ya so we went through his stuff and found this possible drug mail from Brazil. Ya it was cool. Then we did other stuff too. Uh ya then alot happened this weekend. I wish i could remember what happened but i cant. Im going to get the oil in my car changed today. It needs it. My mom was being kind of bitchy this weekend. Ya everyone keeps wanting me to come pick them up since i have my license now. Well im only gunna pick up people i like. Which is everyone. So anyways, Dennis says i write about Richie in here too much. He didnt like my Richie entry. Sorry Dennis, ill try not to write about him so much. Ya i have to go to gym class now."

It made your breasts mysteriously dissapear
Raggedy shirt of disgusting colors

low cut but somehow concealing cleavage

'stop looking at my boobs' you say
but the shirt caused the action, along with many other horrors

But now they are off and shes still cracking up. alot. In gym class me and Kristine kicked the boys asses...ya we scored 8 goals and the stupid boys only scored 2. HA HA HA.

Ya then i went home and i forget what happened. Something did though. Ya then a desk fell on my mom and stuff. Then i went back to the school to put a book away because i had an insane amount of books. So i put one back. And the wrestling team was weird. Ya i was walking past them and they were in the window and then they all started looking at me and Derek started to grab his boob. It was funny. I laughed at them. Ya then i went home. I dont really like driving in the rain much though. So ya i went home and then i went to driving school. Ya im not supposed to drive alone...but i dont have time to wait for parents. So anyways i went to driving school, and i saw Josh Gootkin!!! Holy crap i havent seen him in forever. He said hi to me and i said hi back and omg i havent seen him in forever! The kid rocks. Ya i love him. Then Sebby called me sweetie again. Seriously. Come on buddy. I really dont like him. Its enough to have him talk about me on all of his driving appointments to everyone in the car. Its just fucking creepy. I dont want to know him. Ya Maggie was there and i took her bracelet. Then i went home and got confused and called Kerri. Ya then she asked Richie what chapters the test was on, and he said 9-12. He was right, of course, and i was wrong. Then i did some other stuff. Ya then i studied for my test. Not really though. Ya then i went online and imed shuberth and he got all surprised when i imed him...he always does. And he asks me weird stuff like 'oh my god did katelyn go to the hospital or something??' like i wouldent normally talk to him or im a bitch to him or something even though im not. Oh well, hes a nice kid. nice kid. Then i asked Richie what was that whole deal with the wrestling team and he said that vendetta just said 'oh look its jen craig' and then they commenced being weird. Thats okay. They are way cool. Anyways summer peoples...i was reading back to my journal in summer...ya you should go to the bottom of the page and hit earlier mags and kerri...because theres pretty memories. I miss them. Summer really did kick ass. Ya today in the car my dad was being a fucking retard as always. Ya i made a 20 buck bet with him and we did the whole hand slap thing and i totally won the bet. Ya i did. Or will. God hes so retarded. Then he told me not to have anything to eat because if im hungry i will be more alert in classes. And he said if you eat the blood goes from your brain to your stomach and you cant think. Hes such a retard. That doesnt fucking happen...it just doesnt.

"event","Ya Kristine and Vicky just came over and they really liked my Richie entry...but who wouldent. Ya vacation fucking rocked. It was really really good. Especially new years. It reminded me of summer...when everything was better. I have been thinking about summer alot lately...I really miss it. I had such a good summer last year. Even when i was in school and it was summer out...i remember the night where i went to that thing with Maggie at like 8 at night and we were only supposed to stay for like an hour but we ended up playing kickball at elm ridge with malony and held and crew until 5 am. I dont think i have ever gone that long without sleep...and i wasnt even tired at all. I wanted to stay. Ya...im actually good at sports when i FEEL like playing them and i am with cool people and not in gym class (richie). Ya so anyways that was kickass mags... Ya i miss staying up from when the sun came up to when it went down and then came back up again with no sleep. And then going to sleep at like 7 in the morning and sleeping all day and waking back up at night for awesomeness. I miss Block...that was so great...i miss the guys at Champlins who wrote all over his pants...i miss all of them...and i miss the skatepark, and i miss the guys on the boat that had the beerbottles and that were looking hot and telling us to come on over. I even miss that creepy woman that never has appropriate clothing...or just no clothing at all...i think shes cool. Ya and i was also remembering the Korn concert and how fucking awesome it was. I remember making out with the random person who was really really hot and going from lawn seats to pavillion seats to getting front row seats all thanks to guys. But ya im not hot enough for these extremely hot people in Rocky Hill. Ya i really want to get out of this town...and this library with Bubs peering at me. My dad made fun of my James Marsters calendar that Lisa got me for christmas. He came into my room and was like ""WHOS THAT FLAMER??"" and i was like ""dad hes not gay""...and he doesnt even look gay...he just looks insanely hot. And ya then my dad started cracking up in a sarcastic way and moseying away. I really liked Jack's away message. It was talking about the rock doing nothing and it was like ""you rock, rock"" Ya im looking forward to my next Jack encounter...but it probably wont be for a while since the erin/andy thing ended, and they were usually always together in there 3...or so thats when i ever got to see Jack. So ya i dont know now. But ya hes extremely hot too. Christmas rocked...i got an x-box and some halo 2 game and grand theft auto 3 and vice city. Ya its really good. I like it alot. My new years party was extremely fun. Ya...well im not going to talk about that here. Other stuff bothered me, only a few of you know about that...but thats just unnecessary to speak of. And plus its dealt with. I went to panara bread with Maggie and Angie last night and it really was good. We talked about stuff...ya i borrowed Angies ring today because its cool. I dont like being back to school at all. Im going to fall asleep. I had a really busy vacation...there wasnt a day that i went without seeing my friends. Literally. Ya we did stuff everyday...i love them.

I wish Jeff or Geoff or however he spells it was in the library today so i could make him play hangman with me....beanie beanie beanie beanie beanie beanie"

Pops might get rotating rims...OOPS I SHOULDENT HAVE SAID THAT...i wouldent want anyone to be annoyed or offended. Darn.

I think one of them is Jackies brother. The other one i know...but ya, Jackie since you read this i think your brother is staring at me. So maybe you should go yell at him now. I just cracked my knuckles in a weird way. Kate was here today! I saw her. I was walking through the hall spacing out and someone pulled my arm and i turned around and it was Kate. So i said hi and then she was taken away by the current of bodies. I dont know what shes doing here...concidering she graduated...but it was awesome to see her even though it was only like 2 seconds. I will have to ask her about it later :) Anyways, i hope that Kerri is okay...she stayed home from school today and she had a temperature last night so idk...but she said that she would def come clean the car and stuff. So i really hope that she is alright. Ya they keep staring at me.

Okay ya...this entry is getting really boring so i think im going to go and sit at the table or something and continue blowing my bubbles...or perhaps i will just talk to Kristine for a while.

Vicky just gave me  a weird look from across the library. Anyways, even my dad cried, which he never does. It was so sad. She died at home and we were all petting her. I miss my dog :( So ya, on a happier note, my dad got a new car. Its so creepy. It resembles and escalade much. He loves it. Its so creepy, its like a 50 cent mobile. Its really huge...and its all chromed out. The grill is huge and completely chrome with this weird design...and the wheels are like these gigantic monster truck 40s with chrome rims that are like blinding to look at. There is tons of space inside and it has dark wood interior and he LOVES it. I was like whoa dad thats a very very obnoxious car. And then he was like ""ya...it has a great engine too"" and then he said that it was BETTER than a caddilac but its definately not. He always tries to make everything he sounds so great even though he doesnt need it at all. Its just like all souped up. Its so creepy. Seriously. And it has really really dark tints too. So ya, we drove to school and he put on the stereo and the bass was SO big and he played his music so loud and the whole thing was shaking from the bass and it was weird. My mom finally got a new car too. I dont know how we are affording all of this. But whatever. Now the maxima is mine and mine only. That makes me very happy. Me and Katelyn have concluded from Rhabanis tapes that she makes our class watch that she is part of the mafia and she is using the tapes as a form of torture to make her enemies confess information. Yes...she ties them up and makes them watch it until they cant take anymore. At driving school Sabby told me that he thought it would be fun to spank me because i didnt bring in my 40 dollar check to the DMV. I was really creeped out. One of the subs keeps hitting on the students and like putting his arm around them and giving them hugs and stuff. I think its the one that jackie likes. Im not sure though. I confronted Eduardo this morning about being too obsessed with wally ball and he got all like ""well you guys! you just stand there!"" so i told him that i was never going to try again just to make him angry because i hate him. Trevy is in the lib today. He just walked by. Um ya other stuff happened...but i cant really remember all of it right now. So maybe later.

And then since my car is stick, it gets kinda loud if you give it too much gas and i did and then she thought i was like revving my engine at her and i really really wasnt.

Barb and I kept mooning and flashing passing cars. Oh god though, at Wendy's me and Genilla were sitting on the back of the car driving through the parking lot and i spotted my neighbor's car. Oh god you may have guessed i flipped out. So anyways, the bags were being used. It was so hot. The blue glow and everything else was on, and the gauges had this blue light cycle and it was so hot. The trunk was open, and it had a sound system in it along with a nos tank and a digital guage. It also had glow in the dark petal covers. The thing also was packed with nos in the back and on the side, and had a laptop hooked up in the dash. 4 extra guages on the side and attatched to the top too. So freakin hot. i FLIPPED. So i went up to him and i was like ""your my neighbor"" and this guy tried to pay me to tell me where he lives, but i wouldent because i <3 my neighbor. So then he was like dont say where i live and i didnt. And then we talked and i found out that he is 19 and he lives with his parents, totally contrary to me and Kerri's previous belief. Then he said that he always sees me and Kerri walking around and he wants to hang out with us because we are the only people in the neighborhood close to his age, and he ended up asking for my cell number and i gave it to him. Then we went out and flashed more people. We took the top off the convertible and shit. It ruled. I flipped off coach the other day. Time to get back to the party and never stop. Bye."

"event","Crystal and Jamie are going out now.

Jamie said that during math class Caspirino said the following about me referring to my broken computer:
syko5195: ill fix your computer
syko5195: ill give it some RAM
syko5195: all night
Thats just creepy. I have to confront him now. Hes going out with courtney mcdermit i think. All of this is disturbing to me. He also thinks Kristine likes him and wants him. Thats surely not the case.

I was supposed to tell someone off today for some people, and then beat someone up for someone else. Niether happened.

But what DID happen is i put Nicks backpack in the girls bathroom, and i had 3 encounters with weatherby. Hideous encounters. The worst was afterschool when i was walking down the hall, and he was walking down the hall too and we intersected and he was like ""hey jen how are you doing today?"", and i gave him a dirty look and made no verbal responce, and he was like ""oh really that good?"" and he started his heavy breathing like he did in class after he says something really preverted. And then he took the turn i had to take, and he walked all the way down the hall right next to me, and nobody else was there. It was terrible.

I found out vicky has a livejournal, and will now commence to reading it."

Today was good, even though most people wouldent think so if they were just looking at me. I liked it though. I had alot of laughs...to myself. And then i laughed with Effie about a bird. And it was really hilarious to me for a really long time and it still is even though it probably really shouldent be. I saw Juan again, but this time he waved at me. He put flame stickers on his car and it looks hot. 

I want to go to the gas station tomorrow and get that free drink the guy i went on a walk with promised me next time i went there. This was lame, i have nothing to do except homework now."

"event","Okay so here is my Sunday night. Luke broke up with me because he said he thought it would be better to be just friends since he is back to collage and he doesnt want to be an ass. Some people told me that he dumped me to go out with this better chick, but Bill said that it was because i could never see him because of school and my mom being a retard. And i believe Bill more than these people i have never met. I didnt really mind at first, but then i went home and it kinda sunk in and i was sad. 

Okay but anyways, Sunday night was cool, i went to Emilys house and we attempted to go to ferry park fair but it had closed at 5...and it was like 10. So we went back to her house, we were gunna go to Andrews, but then her mom said she couldent, so Andrew came to her house. And we hung out and ate pizza...but Andrew ate the last good piece and all that was left was this artichoke medly. Then there was sexual whipped cream that we ate. They kept injuring themselves. I dont remember what else happened.

Then the next day came and events occured. Lisa called and we did stuff like go to Maxwell park, then we walked to Jamies house and went on the trampoline...and we all went on even though only 2 people are supposed to be on at once. Chris has a new lover...how terrible. But then I ate food, had the iced tea which was grand, and they hit on eachother. Then we went back to Lisas house. Lisa wanted to start our own labor day party, so we did. We used people close by, like ashley czapcouskis sister...i know thats spelled really wrong..but its difficult...and then zack came, and then this guy matt, and then this Colin charectar, and some girl whos name i couldent prenounce. But anyways, we played manhunt, and matt was my partner, and he had B.O. And he was really into the game and it bothered me alot. So after we had hid in the woods, we went yonder to play freeze tag, which i did not participate in. Then i left to go find Boris to beat up. I ran into Anthony L. and some kid. And the kid said ""are you gunna beat up boris?"" and i said yes. Anthony said he didnt like boris, but the kid said that boris was his friend. And then he said why and i said go away and the kid was like ""just because he wrote something in your journal??""...but he didnt know the half of it. So anyways, Anthony wanted the kid to tell me where boris was. So the kid did, that rhymed...but ya the kid said he was out riding his bike with Jim. So i searched and searched and went back to his house continually but i couldent find. And then i started just walking around, and i saw these guys. And they said hi to me. And one of them...i forget his name, but he works at the gas station and he said he had seen me there. I totally didnt recognize him...but now i will! And then i asked if they saw 2 guys on bikes and they said no, and then i told them my story. And then one of the guys names was Luis, and Luis said that he would beat him up for me. And he gave me a keychain from Puerto Rico. The guys were 20 and 21. And they went to collages. Luis is gunna go to uconn after he finishes this place hes at now. But anyways, they asked me if i wanted to go to the pool with them, so i said yes. And we went, but it was locked, so we hung out by the lake instead. It was really nice, we just layed down and talked. The gas station guy went spear fishing and it was hot. I dont think there were any fish in that lake though...but apparently there are. So me and Luis talked, and he gave me a car freshener. And then i said something about needing a cell phone, and then i said i could ask Anthony to use his, and Luis was like Lafrancis! I havent seen him in forever! So then we went to Anthonys door and rang the doorbell and nobody was home. So he didnt get to see him. But then we did run into the Eza's, and apparently Luis is friends with the older eza. So they talked. Then i had to go home. Then i came back out later to find Boris, but he was still missing.

So then today came, and first i presented my spanish poster and it apparently had something to do with me saying i masturbated to music on a walkman. The teacher said T.M.I. to much information. It was funny. I had really painful cramps all day, it sucked some major ass. I went to English and Tina came up to me and asked if i talked to Italo online on saturday and i said ya and she asked what he said and he had said that he had broken up with her. And he apparently had not. Why does he say retarded stuff? Thats really weird. I dont get the point.

But anyways, i missed volleyball because my cramps got so bad that i threw up...i had to miss some of 8th period just to be in the nurse because it was so bad...it has never been this bad. But anyways, i went home. Then i talked to Boris online and he bothered me so i went to his house and started throwing the punches. At first he had come out at me with a gun...that was never actually loaded...but it was a paintball gun, and as soon as i threatened to release his pet parakeet into the wild he backed off. But ya, there were issues, and finally he agreed to let me punch him in the stomach in exchange that i dont send more people to beat him up. So i did...and it was a big punch. And it got red immediately and it got all these little blood spots...yes, he had been defending with his shirt off so the punch came easy. He was so worried i was gunna go for his balls though. But now it is probably a lovely shade of purple. Now he talks to me more than i think he ever has..well just like tonight since i got back from this fight thingy. But now hes being all talkative and nice...its odd. Oh well, i guess he isnt that bad. 

Tons of people are asking me for Crystal's screen name...its queer."

"event","Yesterday kicked ass. I wore my 80's shirt. With the leapord print and flowers. That was made in Greece. Tracy told me leapord print was coming back. Oh well, it will just never be as nice as my 80's tank top. Then Lisa's parents picked me up to go to ferry park. They were nice...or her dad was...because he said hi jen to me. That made me happy. Their car smelled like pizza. I smelled like hair spray. I guess that kinda made me even more 80's. But anyways we got there, and Tracy was there. So Lisa went off into her friends group, and me and Tracy set out to find some money. We got some from Caspirino, and then the rest was mostly from random people whom we asked. The guy who was supervising the kiddy playground thing wouldent give me money so i went in and threw all the balls out onto the grass and made his job harder and he had to pick them up. Im not nice. But anyways, one of the guys that ran the ride was nice enough to give us a bottomless supply of tickets that he collected from the customers. He had a twin. But then that didnt work because his boss started watching him. We hung out with Tracy's sister Crystal, and she was all cool and hot and better than when i met her a few years ago. I thought she was annoying back then. But now shes cool. Casperino thought she was hot, and she dissed him but later used him and his friend for money. We saw Daves friends and a bunch of other people we knew and Tom and Jamie were there and we hung out with them for a really long time. People kept touching my butt. My anger was to no avail. One of Dave's friends kept picking Crystal up. I cant even remember the order of things. But anyways, we talked to a clown. And boys with bowling pins that they were juggling. Carny guys are cool. Except Wayne. But we all hung out and stuff, and then it started to rain and we ran under a tent. I kept using this stef girls phone, i felt kinda bad asking her so many times. It was nice of her to let me use it. Then i kicked the boyscouts tent. Then the police guy came over. I almost got removed from the park because i stole the cashbox from the car stand. But anyways, me and Tracy and Crystal tried to sell magazines that we picked up off the information stand for 25 cents each, and the only person who bought one was Barbara. Haha Barbara rocks. Then me and Tracy and Crystal went on that spider ride that goes up and down using money that we got from other people. I feel like im part of this group of people. I dont know if i like it, but at the same time its nice because i like them all. Usually i dont like a few people...but these people actually seem decent. But anyways its not like im close with anyone, they just dont bother me and i could stand being in a room with all of them at once. Then some guy said he would give Crystal 5 bucks if she kissed Casperino. But she thought he was too gross, so i told her to kiss Jamie instead. So she did. But the guy didnt pay her. But that was okay, because she liked Jamie. Awww. So she said that she liked him, and i asked him if he liked her and he said to walk with him so i did, and he explained this whole thing about liking someone else too and bla bla bla. So he said he needed to decide. But eventually they ended up handcuffed together, and walked past Casperino to make him jealous. It was great. Then we left by bus, and Crystal really really REALLY wanted to sleep over my house and she said i was her best friend. It was funny. And she said i was way cooler than any of her other friends. Flattering. Tracy got really mad at her. But ya, her dad said she couldent anyways, and then i said that Tracy could sleep over my house tomorrow and Crystal could come. So they are sleeping over tonight i guess. We are going to Jamie's house even though his mom banned me from the premises. Thats your heads up Jamie, so be home."

"event","Yesterday was interesting. People kept giving me hugs again....and again and again. But i guess i like hugs, they are nice. Um, i dont really remember much of what happened. I remember in Gym class we played volleyball...kind of. I dont even remember who was there...except i remember Katelyn...and Agatha...and Jackie...and Kristine...maybe that was it...i dont know. Richelski kept coming onto our court and i yelled at him to leave many a time. I did this creepy dance, and everyone got obsessed with it and made me continue it forever and they kept making me do it again and again. It feels weird to do though. The rest of the day i dont remember...but i do remember how Maria is getting on everyones nerves because she sits with us at lunch because she wants to be cool by sitting with juniors and all of the boys and all of her friends will think shes cool. Its not as if im guessing this, she actually said those words to us. She said that she sits with us so she could look cool, and detail was added to the statement. So i told her we werent ""cool"" and then she was like ""oh are you guys geeks or something?"" and then she asked if we had boyfriends because that apparently makes us cool if we do. It made me really upset at how stupid it was. It really REALLY pissed me off. Stop it. Anyways, Kristine told her to go sit with her freshman friends, hoping to get rid of her, and then after lunch Kristine was like ""wasnt it nice to sit with your friends Maria?"" and she was like ""no it sucked im sitting with you guys forever"". No. It wont make you cool. And if you want to sit with us just so you look like your friends with juniors and you arent, no. The only reason she sat with us in the first place was because shes Anas sister and she wanted to sit there so we said okay because we thought that she was just getting used to school. But then she said it was because the whole cool thing. Okay im making a big deal about nothing but shes just retarded and nobody will let me be blunt. They dont want to make her feel bad. But i think its deserved. Anyways, then other classes occured, and then school was out. I went to the soda machine and it ate my money, so i kicked it really hard and a soda fell out...but i also knocked out all the power on the machine and the lights went out. And everyone stared. And people were like ""jeeze"". Well i wasnt going to sit around while i lost 1.25 on a cheap ass soda that should be priced at 75 cents. I was extremely thirsty. But i could have held off on the swearing...i was just swearing to this random guy behind me about the soda machine. Oh well i got my worth. And then i saw Dave! He is on football now i guess...i hadnt seen him since like the first week of summer. He doesnt have his mohawk anymore...now his hair is all bushy and longish. I liked the mohawk. It was hot. But anyways i got another hug...like the millionth that day...but ya. Then the football team started kicking down all of the soda machines until they were all broken. There were only 3 to destroy so the loss wasnt huge. Well actually it kinda was. Oh well. Then Daves creepy friends came up and they gave me hugs...even though i didnt really know who they were. And then this other guy came up to me and he was like ""remember me??! the park??"" and i realized it was that guy whos bike i stole at moshier! He was so nice in me taking his bike though. What a good sport. But anyways i was like ""ya hey your the guy whos bike i stole!"" and conversation commenced. And then as i took my exit, everyone kept hugging me again and again. It was kinda creepy. Pelletier wont share her wheat thins with me anymore. Now i have to mooch food off others. Then i went to volleyball...i dont remember too much of what happened there. But then as i was leaving i saw Daves freaky friends again. They were all done with their football, and one of them wanted a hug. They are creepy people...like i think im kinda scared of them. But anyways i told him he smelled from football and no. But then he said he changed and he did so i gave him a hug. And then the other one wanted a hug but he was disgustingly sweaty and smelly. So i said no but then he like grabbed me and he started humping me. It was a scary moment. So then i went home, and had a family birthday. With relatives. Aka 2 people...one that isnt even related to me. But ya my grandpa came over. And then we ate stuff, and i got a bracelet and a necklace and other stuff. I got a table lamp too. And i dont remember what else right now. Then they left eventually. My ac sounds like its about to take flight. Reminds me of my second home at the Kelleher household. But moving on, i called Kerri, because we were supposed to go to Atlanta bread. But her family was ordering out. Then Lisa called, her parents were going to the casino all night and she wanted some time on the town. So i drove to her house, and my mom still wont let me drive with her in the car because its illegal with the permit. But at least she still lets me drive it alone. Actually only once...shes all into law abiding now that permit occured. But ya, we picked up Lisa, then me and Lisa walked to Kerris house and called her when outside her door and said that we were gunna go see without a paddle and ask if she wanted to come. She said she would call. The movie was at 10 so we had time. Then me and Lisa walked to Carvel and i got cake batter ice cream with hot fudge, and then we walked to Dunkin Doughnuts to get Lisa some plain bacon. Then i called my mom because we wanted to go to the Ferry Park fair. She picked us up, and away we went. Then when we got there, i saw Dave and who i think was his girlfriend, and Dave was pulling up his shirt and gesturing and it was funny. But anyways, i ran up really fast and jumped and he caught me and did one of those things where he picked me up and spun me around, and i bet it looked awesome. Anyways he introduced me and Lisa to his girlfriend. I forget her name...even though i forgot it 3 times last night and was reminded. But anyways, i gave her a hug. I later learned that she thought i was drunk, although i was completely sober. Then Lisa started talking to her creepy friends, and i drifted to find other people. I saw none for a while. Then i returned to Lisa and picked her up. Then we went to the childs mcdonalds type playground part of the fair. We went in the start of it, and it was a ballpit, and Jamie Perry was there with people and he was like ""hey its the girl with the nice ass! whats up?"" and i said nothing and he tried to get me to take my pants off so he could get a better view of my ass, but was obviously denied. Then me and Lisa started climbing through the thing and then Jamie started chasing us and Lisa was going really fast but i wasnt, and she got really far ahead and then he caught up and he was like ""your ass turns me on so much"" and then he slapped my ass and it was freakadellic. So i went into this other part of the thingy and i think someone puked and the floor was all wet. So i went down the slide. Then i told someone, and they went up into the part and they tasted the ground to see if it was barf. And they said it was water. Then Kristine and Vicky ran up to me and Lisa because they were there. And they were like ""who is that guy sitting over there"" and they pointed to Jamie and i was like ""Jamie Perry"" and then they wouldent reveal why they had asked. They were working there and they were bored. Me and Lisa bought a ticket, or Lisa bought 2 tickets and gave me one, and we went in search of a ride. The tickets had costed a fucking buck each...it was insane...and the rides were 3 fucking tickets. So thats 6 fucking bucks for me and Lisa to go on a ride. We went in search for tickets, but everyone had these fancy wrist bands that gave them unlimited rides. Then me and Lisa saw Egor and Dennis. So we went up and i said hi to them and then asked if they had any tickets that they would want to give us. Egor said he had just given a 20 sheet to some Dave Hale guy. So then they told us what he looked like and to ask him for the tickets. But we couldent find him, and they came back in like 3 minutes and told us to follow them, so we did, and they brought us to Hale. And then this weird guy was doing magic and he made me be his assistant. And he made me look smart. But anyways, after that fiasco, i finally got to talk to Dave Hale and i asked him to give us the tickets. He said he had given them to some Justin guy. So dave bought us tickets of our own. With wet money. And me and Lisa went on the ferris wheel. Then we left, because we had to leave in order to get to the movie on time. On the way out Dennis aimed his little fake prize gun that he got at the fair at us and was firing it. Then i told Egor that he was looking hot today. Then me and Lisa went to see without a paddle, and Louis was nice to me. Then at 12 she called her dad and he was still at the casino. We went home, and i went to sleep. I had a volleyball scrimmage today, and we didnt do too bad, although we didnt win. Me and Lisa are going back to the fair again tonight since we didnt stay for very long last night. Okay this entry is really gay and out of control. It was too weird. Im going to drive now."

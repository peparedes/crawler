"event","i joined the gym again today this time im only doing month to month its more expensive but less hassle in the longrun. it feels good to work out and definately keeps me focused. if i can wake up in time tomorrow im gonna try to go to the dmv so i can take my motorcycle written test again hopefully i pass this time i didnt study at all last time and i think ill read the book before going to sleep tonight that should help i passed the regular driving test first shot but id hate to have to lose my motorcycle endorsement and have to test for it all over again. i got back from the gym today at 130 am and my brothers inlaws and their son just got here and their son was sleeping in my bed which i kind of expected but somehow i got the bed back
i definately need to get a place soon though i dont want to over stay my welcome. my brothers in laws are nice people but we are definately not on the same wavelength at all. i miss jeremiah and luis  speaking of luis he made a suprise visit to san diego which makes me miss san diego more
and i definately miss my girlie girl speaking of her i hope she takes a drivers training class soon so she can get her license sooner but then again its only two and a half months left till she turns 18 id like her to come sooner but i think it would only be by a couple weeks if she took the class
ive been taking it easier at work which is both good and bad i could use more money and i have been spending a little more than i should but then again i am keeping my sanity and im gonna need a couple days off here pretty soon to look for a place. next month im working 12 noc shifts and only 9 night shifts which is nice it makes my schedule mostly noc shift and thats a lot more chill. im done typing"

"event","I didnt go out tonight and im glad i could use a break it can get so exhausting i just hung out all night cuz i went to a show last night it was kind of small but the bands werent too bad i was going to start looking for and apartment but my i figure i should hang tight through this month so i start out ahead of my bills instead of behind. I hear im getting transfered to night shift at work which is cool by me i dont feel like dealing with the drama that goes along with the people on dayshift my brother and his wife are always fighting about the stupidest things ive gotten good at ignoring it and staying out of the middle and my nieces friend was over and they were being brats if it wasnt my nieces friend i would have attacked her grrrrr. i want to apply at st lukes now that i have my idaho cna license i think my chances will be pretty good and the pays not too bad but im not making any plans just one day at a time. the waiting is killing me but i realy dont have any problems at the moment except i miss my girl and i realy wish she would get serious about taking her license test and probably sign up to take her ged she can do it in january i dont mean to be a pain in her ass but i feel like an asshole if im pushing people to do things i have a hard enough time getting myself to do them. but she is saving money she says and thats good i think she does well when her mind is set on something but it takes a lot to get her to decide to actualy do something. i miss her a ton and i wish she was coming sooner. i feel like right now im waiting on too many things like: my girl, starting school, getting an apartment, i have to remember to sit back and enjoy life for what it is that way i dont get too anxious about things. my brother said i can go take one of his guns out and shoot it if i want and that sounds fun id rather wait till he can go with me but it might be a while because of my schedule. i wish i could talk jeremiah into moving out here he is a lot like i am sometimes : he is afraid of change so i think he sets himself up in situations where he gets forced to make a change instead of doing it when he has a good opurtunity but oh well you know what they say about trying to remove the mote from your brothers eye. 

I need to watch out with my bank acount like 24 dollars in overdraft caused me over 130 dollars in fees thats one of the main reasons i want to wait a little longer before finding an apartment because it seems the farther in the red you are the more the system is designed to keep you there but once im in the black i should be able to do well

Some guy named blake was writing in his journal that he had a crush on my girlfriend and i should of let it go because i trust carissa but i said somthing anyway and he blew it off then she told me that he started saying all these things about how i would cheat on her. but ive been being good everytime i see a girl it just makes me think of her.

ive gotten in trouble twice in 3 days at work but i think its 50 50 my fault and the fact that the facilty i work at is kinda strange but anyway i need to use that as a wakeup call so that i dont get sloppy i sometimes have a tendency to excel right away and i wouldnt say get lazy i still work hard but i start using shortcuts


well ive typed my fingers to pieces but i kind of think that this journal thing is a good way to get perspective and evaluate the things you do and the more i write the more i like it and since i know my pretty girl will be reading it i hope it helps to give her an idea of how i feel and what im up to and thinking i love her so much

night"

"event","Iv'e just been going out a little more than i need to lately. I cant stop thinking about getting my place and grrrll and jeremiah coming up everything has been going well and i feel like i havent been doing things wrong. Im starting to understand why my brother was so sold on Idaho it's not just the money its the pressure off you to work yourself to death just to get by it makes life a lot easier to enjoy. ive been taking my niece out a lot she's ten and pretty cool for her age i realy like getting to spend time with my family. i get anxious about my grrrlll coming up because it seems so far away even though it realy isnt there are just so many things that could change i know that i am set on her coming and im pretty sure its what she wants but a lot of things can change when theres that kind of distance for that long. on second thought maybe im not as nervous about that when i realy analyze why i feel that way i think im just getting impatient. but once i get my own place it seems like everything will swing into action I can : save money, jeremiah can visit, grrrlll can come visit, and i can start thinking about applying to go to boise state which is a trip for me because state university seemed like a dream in california.I wouldnt mind trying snowboarding here pretty quick either. If your reading this beutiful girl you have nothing to worry about on my end i know how i feel about you and that wont change."

"event","In starting to get agro in this desert i miss san diego i miss carissa and i miss jeremiah im proud of him hes been sober like 74 days its a new record

i think carissa is getting kind of irritated with me but i feel bad calling and talking to people just to tell them that nothing new at all has happened that its just the same bullshit over and over since ive been here but oh well 

I need to get my ass back to san diego before i lose it here the little 2 day vacations down there help but i cant realy afford em my mom came up here about a week ago but i wish carissa and jeremiah would come up

all of my room mates friends are coming up here and theyre all polish so everyone will probably be drunk this weekend i have to work but if tomak shows up they will just be getting started by the time i get off work.

I need money and it sucks i need to pay my smog and registration and i have to pay mike like 350 dollars in back utilities i owe him i cant afford to pay him as much as i am but i will cope i am gonna have to tell him i cant pay him this much when i get in the LVN program

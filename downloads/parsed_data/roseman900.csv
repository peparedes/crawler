Man we use to hang out like everyday after school. Then my parents come in and are all like, "" Andrew we're moving."" Its like what the fuck. So i had one week left to spend with her. it's like someone telling u u have one more week to live. i felt bad for her to. her dad hated her. this is the part where i but my nose in and do something so stupid it throws me in juvy. the last weekend i was in seekonk, i rang her doorbell, and punched her dad right in the face. i just didn't know what else to do. Damn was she fly though. at least from my opinion. i cant stop dreaming about her. i just cant stop thinking about her. i wonder what she looks like now."

It was pretty cool, i met some pretty cool people like Josh, Joe, Adam, Roland, and of course the human squeaky toy(Muhammed). The evening started off well. It was really awesome. Only one slight tiny problem. I felt completely out of place. Like seriously you have no idea. I mean i went on a walk with jasmine, brianna and adam. And i just couldn't relate to anything. They had all of these inside jokes and all these people i didn't know. I tried to peak my head in a couple of times but i realized it wasn't worth it. One i had know idea on what they were talking about, and two I would just end up making a total fool of myself. It's not there fault and im not trying to make anyone feel guilty. im just clearly stating i felt extremely out of place. Thats all. Well i guess that pretty much som"

"event","Then Andrew, the fucker, stole the notebook I need for our English class/homework. And the best part is he lost it. Asshole....

I mean everytime me and him are cool he has to do something to screw it up. He's gotta do something to piss me off. Always something....

quoted from jasmine's livejournal. You know, i think its the funniest shit ever when she tells the part of the story that makes her look good, and me look like shit. If you wanna know the real story, it goes a little something like this. Jasmine stole my pen a couple of days ago. i asked for it back and she said no. so a couple of days(which would be today), i ask for it back, and she says no. So i steal her notebook and said, ""You will get your notebook back when i get my pen back."" So what does she do? She throws the pen down her shirt. so i hide her notebook behind the curtains of the stage in the cafeteria. That's what happened. Then, she has the nerve to blame me for losing her notebook. Whether someone told her i did or she assumed it. i dont really care. it just pisses me off that i get blamed for it. So at the end of the day i was going to get the notebook and give it to her. but no, she storms off down to her bus, while throwing her hissy fit. Real fucking nice huh? yea i thought it was awesome. I realized its not me who ruins things jasmine, its you. Yes i know your ego is to big to admit but your the one who actually ruins things. so stop throwing your bitch fits, because im not dealing with this shit anymore.

P.S. Actually this is quite funny. Zac said he was going to keep the pen to jerk-off to at night.lmfao."

Perpously, i may never know. She was and still is beautiful inside and out, yet it was like she never saw me. i tried to hard which ended up making me broke with a husky on my hands. i loved her but she didn't feel the same. i should of realized it from the beginning and given up. But no i had to be the one soul who tried, and it really didn't come to a good ending. i wrote a note to explain it all and now everyone gives me dirty looks as i walk down the hall to class. its obvious she has shared it, though it wasn't something to be shared. it was and explanation to her not to everyone else. it pisses me off and yet i can't stay mad at her. i don't know why but i can't. i can't call her house anymore seeing as though her mom is getting annoyed. i can't hang out with her in the mornings because barry is there and i don't want to be a tag along. i can't talk to her during class or in the halls anymore because it feels to akward. something is missing. Scooby Doo, can you solve this mystery. it hurts to let her go, but it hurts even more when i lose her because of my ego. i'm there if she falls, but it's up to her whether she wants me to catch her. Maybe she wants someone else to catch her, or maybe she just wants to fall, get up, dust herself off, and keep walking. I honestly don't know but i am there for her if anything, anything once so ever happens to her or some problem, and no person, or fight could ever stop that.

Because he just didnt see a point in living anymore. He wondered what was the point of living, and no one could give him an answer that made sense. So the boy took the easy way out. The boy was a coward and took the easy way out. It might have been stress from school work, it might have been the math teacher. It might have been a girl, it might have been his friends. It might have been that everyone underestimated him,or it might have been to throw sorrow into everyones lives that he knew. Whatever the reason, it didnt matter now. The boy was dead and there was no way to change his mind. The note stated that he didnt want anyone to greif, but i dont think that it really mattered. He left in it that his friend Boisvert was not to be forgotten and he left all of his belongings to that family. Why? The world may never know."

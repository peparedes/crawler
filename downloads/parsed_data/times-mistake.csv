"event","<font face=""century gothic"" size=2>So it has been a little while. That's because I really haven't had much to say that couldn't be considered a major downer. Really. See what I mean? That was a downer in itself. 

I've been keeping a real journal. I've actually been writing my thoughts down as they come, on actual paper, in an actual leather-bound journal that I had neglected since this past March. I've had a lot of thoughts lately and a lot to say. But some things you can't say or think to anyone but yourself sometimes. It's funny how that happens. But the point is, when you write to yourself and look back at it later you can learn so much. And it can be...awakening. Sort of like little mini self revolutions.

If I was going to be completely honest with all of you, which I'm going to be right now, I would say I'm in a downward spiral. Or I was. I'm not sure anymore. Somebody said some things to me last night that were just so dead on...it was scary. But I've come to expect things like that from this person, who will remain nameless so don't even ask. :) In any case, since August or maybe even a little before, everything has just poured on at once. I think the best way to express myself right now is metaphorically. Say you're standing on a rug, and someone keeps just whipping it out from under you without any warning. You would fall right? So you get back up. And you're ok for a moment, but it happens again. Each time you fall that fall is going to hurt a little more. That's how it's been. Sometimes you're ok in between for a while. And sometimes it's just a second. But you know the next fall is coming. You're expecting it. But you can't stop it. That's how it's been. I'm not going to go into a lot of specifics because most of the falls have been pretty personal. There are a few of course some of you already know about, like Whitney, and Luke. And all too recently my grandpa passing away who had been sick and fading since October. My problem came in the fact that I was focusing on that. On all the bad, because I got so used to expecting the next fall. I should be focusing on the good things. 

It's great when someone knows you so well they know exactly what you already know but can't admit to yourself. There was a big thought sort of buried under all these other facades and prefaces. It was almost a rush just to finally face it. And it was one of those ""AHA!"" moments. So, I think I'm going to be ok. I'm not saying it's going to be easy, but it's going to be better. You can't just sit and be terrified all the time. And you can't filter out every impulse. That's not living at all. Some impulses have to come out. You'll just hurt yourself with the regrets and the rationalizations. And you still feel unfinished. 

It's foggy out. And grey. And beautiful. I'm going to go for a walk by the river. I wish everyone the best. And thanks for reading. Comment if you feel like it. Or don't. It's up to you. 

Peace."

"event","<font face=""century gothic"" size=2> Well today was good despite me feeling like crap again. I hopefully will be back at school tomorrow because I am feeling a decimal better (if that even made sense.) I'd like to thank L^3 and Jennabebs for leaving that adorable message on my phone. I was sleeping everytime you called but when I got the voicemail it really made my day.

That and the fact that Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire came out today and my mom went out and bought it for me when she went to pick up some stuff for me at school. I'm so excited. I have to finish my homework (make up work rather) first though before I can watch it. And I really want to have some people over when I'm feeling better and we can watch it and be nerds. So excited...can't wait to watch the extra features either. 

I think I have to do my speech tomorrow so I'd better do that too. It's on John Lennon so I wouldn't really consdier it a chore. I'm more worried about finding some non-website sources rather than anything else. Ah Well...

So see everyone at school tomorrow hopefully. I can't wait until I'm not sick. AHH! Peace Out."

"event","<font face=""century gothic"" size=2>I've been pretty sick for about three days now. Left school on Friday with the chills really bad. I just couldn't concentrate on anything so there wasn't a point in me being there at all. Came home and have been sleeping, reading, eating soup, and watching movies. Speaking of movies umm...

GOBLET OF FIRE ON TUESDAY! I'm so RIDICULOUSLY EXCITED! I think I'm going to change my banner to a new H.P. graphic just for the upcoming occasion. And I thought it was coming out in April! (is that the UK release maybe?) 

Anyway. I always get kind of depressed when I'm sick. So I've been trying to keep my spirits up by not thinking about all the stuff I have to do for school. It's not working very well though. I was going to have some people over on Friday too but then I got sick. It seems like that always happens to me lol.

Anyway, got to get a move on this homework. We have CF class tonight too. *sigh* It never ends. 

Peace out."

"event","<font face=""century gothic"" size=2> Well, I'm in school right now and I really don't want to be. Tomorrow is our Fine Arts Extravaganza Day and I've been trying to get on the Mac in the Photo Lab which is connected to the EPSON printer for about a week and a half now and finally during 4th hour it was free so I was just about to go on and print my crap when Mr. Juran said that it was out of ink. I was so pissed. Now I'm going to have to print all my crap after school today in the room next door. And hopefully I can finish it all. And get some of them matted. And the rest mounted. And put up on the display boards. 

Tomorrow should be pretty sweet though since I can miss all of my classes to be shooting portraits in the senior lounge so people can buy them later for fun. We have to move the entire studio in there tonight including some of the lights and the backdrop....so again basically the whole studio. I'll probably be stopping into Choir during 6th since we will be performing and I'm considering going to AP Euro since we are covering Russia tomorrow and we have our objective test on Italian, German, and Russian Unification and development on Monday. Ap Euro is pretty much insane this week. So far we have fought The Crimean War and unifed two countries and its only Wednesday. *wink* Me and my busy schedule... 

I was reading HBP last night again and I got to the part where Dumbledore *ahem* and I completely lost it again. It's just so depressing! He can't die! He's Dumbledore! I'll probably finish it tonight when I get home if I can accomplish some ID's and questions for AP Euro first. Somuch to do, so little time. 

I need to practice my solo for Solo & Ensemble and guitar since I have a lesson tomorrow night and I want learn the solo for Landslide. But I have to get the second riff down first. Sweet. I miss drawing too. I never have time right now. 

I know this is a ridiculously long entry and everything but I am really in English right now and stalling because I don't want to research for my speech. *sigh* The end. El fin.

Peace out."

"event","<font face=""century gothic"" size=2>I'm pretty tired again. Tomorrow is opening night for the Madrigal Dinner and I'm feeling a varied mix of emotions. We only had practice (which was really working on the set today) until 4:30 because of the inclement weather and CRAZY snowstorm we had today which dumped a sick mixture of slush, hail, snow, and rain on everyone. It's really strange to have a thrunderstorm while its snowing...anyway! I don't think Women's Choir is as good as it could be because some people are still waving what I like to call the ""bad actor flags."" That is, the random stiff arm motions all bad actors seem to make when they don't know what to do and aren't comfortable just standing and speaking. And we need to make sure we have a pitch pipe and BLAH BLAH BLAH our tempo is still lagging and people need to actually show up for rehearsals.

Practice would have gone until 8 p.m. or later which means I would have missed my guitar lesson but since I got home at around 5-ish I was able to go. Since I haven't had time to practice for about a week my finger picking on Landslide was a little rusty so I began learning ""Over the Hills and Far Away"" (which is an amazing song). Sounds pretty good I guess. It's fun to play.

And now to end...a quote...

Me: I would never go to a tanning bed. I'm too scared of getting cancer.
Melness: Well you've got to die somehow...
Me: So basically by that principle I shouldn't worry about things that give me cancer because we're all have to die somehow...
Melness: If you're gonna die you might as well go tan.
^^^ not quite what she meant I don't think lol Yes, ladies and gentlemen, sarcasm runs rampant still in our society."

I'm at school right now and I'm updating from the Photo Lab. Normally I would have Honors English 10A (speech) right now but we have a sub and I got a pass to come down here since I have nothing to do there and they were just having a quiet study hall. I feel a little bit like I'm schkipping class. 

If I had a car I would so just leave school right now since I signed in at class for attendance and don't have to check back in. Nobody would miss me! But alas, I don't have a car yet and I have rehearsal after school. First day of hell week! Rehearsal from 3:00p.m. - 8:00p.m. They provide us dinner because we paid a monster check at the beginning of the production to cover the cost of meals all this week and costumes (which look amazing from what I've seen). Tomorrow is our first dress rehearsal (I'm going to try and get a camera so I can shoot for Yearbook at Rehearsal) and then costumes all this week and the actual dinner is on Friday and Saturday.

Otherwise today has been completely ordinary and boring. Shot Jazz II this morniong for Yearbook. Turned in some photos for the Photo Club page in the yearbook. Had a health test this morning that was a complete joke. Chemistry quiz which I think went really well. Geometry; easy and boring as usual. AP Euro is going well I think. Can't wait to get my test back and see how I did because I think it went well on Friday. Then choir, we used that to rehearse our madrigal song and some other random stuff. Spanish was tiring and now here I am!

Rumor has it things are a little unsettled between certain people right now. (Not saying this to provoke anything I just hope everything falls back into place and get solved if there even is a problem.)I miss  Lauryn and happy birthday to Carolyn! 

Bell is going to ring in about 7 minutes. Peace out."

"event","<font face=""century gothic"" size=2>Well, this is hell week for the Madrigal. Rehearsals every night from right after school until 8pm. It is sure to be a week packed full of fun, laughter, sleep deprivation, stress, and slowly declining positive attitudes. I would just like to apologize in advance if I'm extremely grumpy.

I'm trying to get ahead on AP Euro right now. We got some questions and reading to do and it would be really awesome if I could get it all done early. And we have our information speeches coming up this week too I think. 

This weekend was fairly laid back. We had that AP Euro test on Friday which I think I might have done really well on because I actually studied for it this time. *crosses fingers* My parents went to a dance together at the Milwaukee Art Museum on Friday night and I wasn't feeling so hot so I just stayed home and started reading Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince again. Then Saturday night I didn't do much either, helped Brad get ready to go to Senior Ball. Yay! Watched Two Towers before bed. It made me very nostalgic. I love Tolkien. Now I want to watch Return of the King again too. ANd the series all over again....for like the 8 billionth time. It inspired me to write in one of my fanfics again too...but I didn't. Maybe if I have time tonight...I better do my AP Euro then for a while if I want to.

Peace out. 

P.S. How does everyone like my layout?
P.P.S. I started learning Landslide by Fleetwood Mac on guitar. Sounds pretty cool so far. Lets hope that continues, haha."

"event","<font face=""century gothic"" size=2>But it is killing me. I just want summer. Really really really badly. I mean school can be good but there is a lot of shit going on right now. I can't even think of one hilarious thing that happened today and that's not a good sign. I'm sure something really funny happened but I feel so exhausted it just won't climb to the front of my brain. 

I finally got my schedule for next year picked out and signed up for classes. It pisses me off that I can't take any classes during the summer so I only have two free semesters for electives which means I'll have to take Photography and Digital Imaging senior year as well as Art Seminar or Art Independant study. And that can only happen if a.)i don't need math or science or b.) I take PAD and Econ over the summer after junior year (which I will most likely be doing). So here's the plan;
0 Hour PE 11
Algebra II
Spanish 3
Ecology / Marine Biology
Choir
Painting I / Painting II
Research and Composition / World Lit to 1900 
20th Century American History 

20th Century US History *grins* Gonna be so easy after AP Euro. Yeeeeees. No way in hell I'm taking AP US. I prefer European history and I don't really want to kill myself because I heard it's 2 times harder than AP Euro. World Lit might change to Lit Studies II if i don't get it 2nd Semester. We shall see.


Well, onto AP Euro. We have a test on friday on Liberalism, Conservatism, Nationalism, and Socialism. Peace out."

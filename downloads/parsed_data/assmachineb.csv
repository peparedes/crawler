I called them and asked if they were hiring, because Christine told me they were, and they said come in tuesday between 11 and 6, so i guess thats a postive reaction, right?

a=1
s=19
s=19
m=13
a=1
c=3
h=8
i=9
n=14
e=5
b=2

2. add all of the numbers together to create a kind of super number.

94

3. add the digits of the number together.

13

4. find the post of this number in your LJ. If you don't have that many posts, add the digits together again

http://www.livejournal.com/users/assmachineb/2004/05/14/

5. take the digit you noted in step 3, and count that many words into the post

""Start""

6. use the resulting word in a google image search, and select a picture from the first page and post the results.

"event","today was very nice.
i had the house all to myself.
moms and pops and lil sis went off to Six Flags, and being the party pooper that i am, i decided to stay home.  Gabe, of course is off with Chelsea.

I finally finished painting my room, now all i have to do is finally clean it.
it's nice spending a hot day alone in the house in only your underwear with the fan blasting on you.

I've been internet stencil surfing.  There is so much i want to do.  I really need some money so i can buy something to stencil on.  It's really driving me mad crazy loco.

Ok, so there are 2 stencils i want to put on my wall because even though i painted them i still think they're too plain.

so here's <lj-cut text=""numero uno""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v385/shannons_stencils/surfergirl.bmp""></lj-cut>


and <lj-cut text=""numero dos""><img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v385/shannons_stencils/windflowers.bmp""></lj-cut>

i really like the first one, which i also want to put on a shirt.  But opinions are needed.  Although i dont know why it matters, i'm the only person that sees my room anyways.
But, whatever.


I don't know yet if i want to go to school or not.  I change my mind alot.  I have to get one of my classes changed and if i dont get the art class with Christine then i'm going to be all alone this year.

So for IS with Mr.K i'm taking:
+Current Life Issues (yeah, i know)
-U.S History (i hate u.s history! please put me back in world history the u.s is so boring!! last year was the only time i ever learned about what was going on in the world other than the damn revolutionary war!).
-P.E (i'm hella stupid and didnt take p.e last year. whatev, i'm knocking 2 years out in just one.)
English 3 (meh)
+Psychology ( also, meh)

For EHS:
Art-Haber eww i hate him!
P.E-Palley...hmm, dont know who that is.  Probably the person replacing that other P.E teacher that got fired for being a lesbo. I'm just glad it's not Saunders.  

and i have to take a 3rd elective at EHS.
I'm just glad i get to be in IS again.  Hopefully i can try and be in it next year part time.  i just dont want to go back to school full time again, i swear i'll have a nervous breakdown or something.

ok well, that was a bunch of nothing.

"event","Gabe got back from Mexico yesterday!
i missed him alot.
He brought me back a poncho, i am sooo Mexican!

But of course it doesnt really matter that he's back cause hes gone all day anyways.  

I went on a successful shopping trip today.  A very rare successful shopping trip.  i actually found stuff, that i liked, that was cheap or on sale, and i still have 5 dollars left over.  I bought another canvas bag and some cool fabric for the inner lining 
which reminds me, i should probably send out Isabelle's bag before school starts.  I hope she loves it, she better.

I also got 
1 light green polo lookin type shirt
1 green t-shirt
1 yellow t-shirt
and 1 really cute brown tank top.

I plan on stenciling on all of these, and the bag, except for the tank, it's fine by itself.

I always thought that Rainbow store was useless and only for cute little asians (because those are the only people you ever see in there)
but they have alot of cheap plain shirts, which i found out today, is hard to find.

well, i better get started on those stencil's."

"event","I got my snake today!  
Gabe got his passport in San Fran and then we drove around for a long time and then we went to this redwood forrest and that was alright and then we drove to San Anselmo and found Rachel's house and got my snake.  I was picturing her as some ugly ho, i guess cause she pissed me off, but she was really pretty and her house smelled like incents and she had cute cats and a giant iguana.  I'm gonna post pictures tomorrow so you'll probably see them before you read this.  

Oh yeah, on the way there we were trying to think of names and i saw a street sighn that said Sir Francis Drake and i thought the snake was going to be a boy so i said that would be his name but when we got there Rachel said she was a girl so my mom said how about Lady Francis Drake so thats her name.  Isabelle wanted to name her Cutie so everyone just calls her Cutie or Lady for short.

I am so happy!

Hahaha, now i just have to save up money for the next pet i want;
A $400 Great Dane puppy.
Yeah, i know, i'm crazy. 
Whatev!"

"event","I have found a black and white striped king snake for very cheap and i am looking to buy it.  The only problem is i am flat broke and my parents sure as hell arent going to chip in.
So that said i am looking to all my lovely generous kind hearted nice friends to donate whatever money or spare change they have burning holes in their pockets.  Really, anything would help, even as little as 5 dollars.  I have already hit most of you up for money but so far all i have is 2 dollars from Chelsea.  Pretty sad i know, but please, this is for a good cause and i would appreciate anything.  Just instant message me at IRule0YouDrool or e-mail me at My_bra_itches@yahoo.com.

Your favorite Nicaraguan,
Shannon

This is not how i wanted to start this post.

So in these weird dreams they either contain an animal talking to me

or

myself suffocating.
I'm suffocating but i'm still alive
and i can't die
but i also cant breath.

So, in turn, i just live with it.
For this eternal feeling of suffocating.
I dont even try to breath anymore.

I've been accepted to graduate school at NCSU.  Yay.  I think I'm going to defer my admission for a year though, and save up some money.  Take some general classes at the CC.  Classes like... Spanish.  So I know a useful language, instead of Sign.  Cause lets face it.  They don't write journals in ASL.  

 I can't decide if this is a good idea or not, but my employer is investing a great deal of money in me in the next couple of weeks, and I feel I should stick so they get their moneys worth.  

Blah.  Back to the books (or rather the website lol)"

Let's talk about deodorant.  Seriously cool stuff.  Especially when mixed in with an antiperspirant.  Fuck all its an amazing invention.  So when is it OK not be wearing this amazing invention?  Never.  And yet, people do.  I understand forgetting maybe once or twice a year, say if you're late and in a rush etc.  But there is no excuse to come to work every day with stains on your shirts.  Gross.  Antiperspirant.  Amazing.

Craisins are the shit too.  

So, I was planning on going to the SAA's this year, which if you don't know are sorta a big deal for archaeologists.  Sadly, I have no money to fly to Atlanta, live in a hotel for 5 days and still manage to feed myself, pay rent, etc.  This bothers me.  I feel some legislation should be passed along the lines of, if your a student it's 75% off everything, no matter what, no matter where.  

In other news, iLife '09.  Amazing.  Faces however, is useless.  Apparently I am my friend Frederick, he is my english friend Madeleine and she is my sister, Annie.  Yeah.  There's some improvements that need to happen there.  The Garageband guitar lessons are interesting, except I've really lost my interest in learning how to play.  

So, lets talk about iPod's.  specifically the iPod touch, and it's sister product, the iPhone.  Amazing devices, these.  Expensive as hell, but also a device that you really can't live without once you have one.  So why, pray tell, would anyone take an iPhone near a pool, in the shower, or otherwise watery location, proceed to dump the phone in a liquid, and then expect the warranty to cover said external damage?  What the hell kind of warranty covers you fucking up your product?  Accidental damage protection like you get at Best Buy, sure, but its NOT a warranty.  Manufacturing defects, that is what a warranty is for.  None of this, you're a fucktard and took your obscenely expensive phone into the SHOWER with you cause you can't bear to not be texting for 5 freaking minutes, and now you expect me to have your phone fixed?  You can't fix stupid.  It's just not possible with current technology being what it is.  I find these people vaguely offensive.  They find me vaguely offensive to hehehe.  

With that said, having said for sure nothing of import, I bid you all a good day, week, month or whatever unit of time you wish.  Except a picosecond.  Fuck those."

In other news.  Phoenix is hot as hell.  I'm choosing the graduate schools I will be applying to this fall.  I'm totally picking based on weather.  UC Santa Barbara is my holy crap I want to go there school.  I may apply to Stanford just cause if you get accepted you get 5 years guaranteed financial aid.  University of Tennessee in Knoxville of course... the body farm.  Maybe North Carolina State, cause I will be working with several of their staff this summer at my field school.  Also, Texas State in San Marcos.  It's going to be a busy fall.  I have no idea how to write a Statement of Objectives... or a Letter of Intent, whichever they want.  

I'm taking my last Sign Language class right now... makes me sad, because I haven't found a school that offers more advanced classes.  I'd like to learn more and maybe try translating, but I need to focus on Anthropology or I'll become a wandering scholar for the rest of my life.  I've been kicking around some ideas as to the region I want to focus on in graduate research... I have decided the Andean archaeological cultures are most interesting, especially prior to the rise of the Inka.  gasp, yep there are lots of interesting things before the Inka, who knew?  

I'm at work... I need to go do... work things.  Like checking my email, swapping lies and discussing the state of the union."

Now, over the first part summer I have decided to commute with it to work and back with it.  It shall be interesting.  It's roughly a 15 mile trip, so it's not to bad.

But thats not the half of it!&nbsp; In July and early August I will be participating in a bioarchaeological field school on Carriacou, a tiny island just north of Grenada.&nbsp; We will be excavating pre-columbian skeletal remains and material culture and attempting to determine their origins (yay biodistance analysis).&nbsp;&nbsp;

Whew,&nbsp;5 weeks on a&nbsp;Caribbean island, whatever am I going to do?&nbsp; I'm thinking about getting SCUBA certified through Arizona State before I&nbsp;leave, apparently it's one of the cheaper&nbsp;way's to go.&nbsp; And yet, as a desert rat, the thought of being immersed in water scares the living crap out of me.&nbsp; Hell, just the thought of being on a tiny island scares the living crap out of me.&nbsp; Especially since it will be the beginning of hurricane season.

Over Spring Break I helped out with some surveying and mapping of a site called Perry Mesa in Northern Arizona.&nbsp; It pretty much confirmed that I have chosen the correct major.&nbsp; Mostly because the statistical analysis part using GPS data was WAY to much fun, but also, seeing where people lived right near my hometown, but over 1000 years ago was interesting.&nbsp; We were surveying for Agave knives.&nbsp; They used these knives to cut down an agave to its heart and then they roasted the heart in underground firing pits (which you can still see today!) to make it stable for long term storage.&nbsp; My mom has actually been to a reenactment of the roasting ceremony, and says it doesn't taste all that bad.&nbsp; Course, you can't beleive her, she spent an entire year as a vegeterian, and she likes lentils.&nbsp; bleh.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Dr. F who is a forensic anthropologist, a subject with which I am most fascinated
Dr. R who focuses on human origins and paleoecology, also fascinating
Dr. B who studies Bioarcheology and human osteology.  

I have some more but these people are the ones who focus in areas I am interested in studying and probably teaching.  

So I have a question for all you out there...  How does one go about interviewing a person to find out if what they are specialized in, and what they do for a living, is something you want to do?  

The only person I have ever interviewed is a funeral home director in Huntsville, and the questions I had were given to me by my instructor in Death and Dying: A Cross Cultural Perspective.  

Any ideas?  I mean, I have some obvious questions, like do you like what you do and all those ones, but is there anything any of you wish you had asked someone you interviewed about your potential future, something you thought of after the fact?  Or even a little bit of advice about interviews in general?  I'm socially inept!  Thanks if you do!

My prof is crazy!!!  we have like...6 novels to read and the anthology...its a hellish amount of reading...especially since ""The Tower and the Hive,"" Anne McCaffrey, is waiting for me...but it looks like it will be summer before I get to read it.  

History 110 US history from 1865 to the present kinda sucks.  we have to read this book and Edison that is written so poorly that my eyes want to jump out and kill the author, and to top it all of its like...Bible print and big.  grrr it was supposed to have been read by last week...oops... :-D

hmm...Physics...grrrr

Chemistry...suprisingly...easy... a we bit o' memorization...and some basic algebra skills...and its kinda fun.  I have test tomorrow and much memorization to do 8-/  damn polyatomic ions and their charges are gonna be the death of me.  but acids...now those bitches are fun...

I have applied to go back to Space Camp in the summer.  They will make decisions sometime in April, i was told... I caused a lot of trouble there over Christmas Camp...so im not sure i'll be welcomed back :-|   oh well."

I wore my NASA shirt around today...hoping someone would acknowledge the fact that it was an important 20th anniversary for NASA.  but no one did. but on my drive home yesterday the radio announcer on the country station was like I'd like to honor these people and he named them all and everything.  it was awesome even if it was on the wrong day.  i think im doing to send him a free lunch to somewhere or something.  sadness

I am most definitly changing my major though.  I can't go through this for the next 2 years.  im thinking Antrhopology(Linguistics) and Global Studies...concurrent majors... not sure what career i'd have with an education like that though...but at least life would be interesting!  anyway I must go to a school district and videotape the teachers being taught to be better teachers.  :-D  muhahhaha theres something insanely satisfying in watching teachers be students...just so long as im not the one teaching them!  hehehe

"event","So...once again I've come across a subject I can't stand.  Apparently this is to be something of a regular event in my life.  As many of you know Physics is my chosem major, well was my chosem major.  However prior to this semester I have never taken physics in my life.  Yeah yeah, i know it was probably stupid of me to choose a subject like that to major in, but really, it sounds interesting from the outside.  and then you get stuck with these fucking labs, that have nothing to do with what your talking about in lecture, and yet your responsible to know this lab shit, that you haven't been taught.  GOOOOODDDD DAAAAMMMMMNNIIITTTTT I'm sick of the bullshit and inconsistency that goes on in the realm of science.  I'm switching to Anthropology, Linguistics.  maybe ill do both.  
I almost walked out of physics today i was shaking pissed.  like...Lyn remembers how pissed I was when dad was like omg your watching gothic satanism, pissed.  here were are...starting in chapter 37 of the bloody Physics I book, Special Relativity...which...i dont give a shit about.  and were doing some math...and then all of the sudden he's like okay group work here's a problem from Physics II.  WHAT THE HELL?!!!  At the very least give us something useful god damnit.  damnit damnit damnit.  damnit.  we never get lab explanations more than whats required to be able to use the fucking vernier calipers...cause its not like i knew how to use those.  so.  i may actually even drop it.  I can't put up with this bullshit all semester long.  I have to meet with my lab group to write the lab report for our first lab.  which has nothing to do with anything we will be discussing for another oh 13 weeks.  S 'ok tho...cause I've taken enough english classes to bullshit my way through anything.  

GOD DAMNIT.  Fuck school.  at least i know i like Anthro and Ling.  I like Literature too.  I can be smart and major in a non-science.  thats allowed.  right?"

It was the return trip of my first airplane flight and I was, once again, stuck in the Houston airport over night...I was sitting in those wicked chairs just waiting for the night to pass...freezing my ass off...I was wearing my light blue flight suit, and my space camp sweater over top...I must of looked funny as hell... anyway I had my Pilot dog tags (for those of you who don't know there used to be an award for the pilot track that was the dog tags...it was GNC I think) on and this guy in the Army or Marines (at the time I had no clue what the difference was so...lol) came over and talked to me for a while...he thought I was in some branch of the military, but I was like..noo....I'm just a nerd.  I was pretty nervous...first time away from home an all...first time airplane trips...9/11 having been the week before...I had no social skills...I picked up all the ones I do have working at Space Camp so...that tells yah something.  It was also the first time I had ever seen a real uniformed military person...ouside of movies.  I was probably rude...not intentionally but I didn't know how to talk to people back then...I still have trouble with it.  but..I dunno...it was nice to have a person around who made me feel like the airport was safe.  and he was really nice...I think he sat with me for an hour or two.  I don't remeber they guys name...or rank or anything...but here's to hoping he's still all right and not dead..."

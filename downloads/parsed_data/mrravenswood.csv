Now before I get started with the same non sense that keeps readers wanting more, I just have to let it be known that I was dumped yet again. I know exactly what ur thinking, how could this guy get dumped again? or, This has got to be some kind of record. Anyways, I got the glue and peiced together my broken heart, it didn't turn out good I was never really that great at building stuff, but at least the pain of the heart ache, is gone, yea boo hoo, tear, sniff, whatever. Now on to the juicy stuff, k, I know I've been talking about this florida thing for a while now and how great its gonna be to see all the chicks beggin for a peice when I take the shirt off and start doing push ups on the beach, but get this, I'm having trouble trying to figure out how much money I should take, Money should be the last thing on this guys mind, but guess what, its like a mystery I just can't figure it out. but to end the entry on a more serious note, Yesturday I was thinkin of how great it would be to reward myself for taking the road that I've had to take the last week so well, and I did, a nice fat chawski. Thanks for reading, fuck bitches, they lie."

"event","I know its been a while since I've updated this peice of shit, but for anyone who has been wondering, hey what the fuck is matt doing right now? Here it is, I got a new job at KOA that I am starting at this summer, I get to work outside again which is sweet as candy. Gas has gone up, but I didn't have to tell you that you probably just got done bitching about that with one of your friends and or family members. Summer is almost here and that means we are getting closer and closer to the florida trip this summer which is gonna be the shit, and not to mention I am finally gonna  have an excuse to take my shirt of so everyone can see how much muscle I have, a lot. But don't get to excited ladies, the bathing suit is staying on. Anyways, enough about my little weaner, on to bigger things, like the fact that I have a seven page research paper due in a week, and the fact is I did start it yet I still don't have a very polished final draft which will probably cause me to get a very shitty grade, but fuck that a grades a grade right. 

                        Matt- Just so we're clear about one
                           thing... Dick Ravenswood and
                           Matt Kliemann are totally seperate
                           people. I don't mean to freak you
                           out, but Dick is a little bit of
                           a perve.


                      Dick Ravenswood- You bastard, the only 
                           thing I'm guilty of is being an 
                           extremley good looking man, and an
                           extremley good lover, so ladies if
                           you want a small taste of love, then
                           talk to that skinny matt bitch. But 
                           if you want a huge fucking plate of
                           of love, just ask for dick.


I'm sorry I am bored."

"event","To all the regular readers I have, which probably only includes myself, you have noticed that I have been on a sort of writing hiatus lately. Well the truth is I'm so lazy that I have trouble actually clicking a few buttons to get this far. Its amazing that my brain can even produce enough energy to move my fingers. Any way I went up to state on sunday, that was pretty sweet. Right now I'm stoked about going to Florida this summer, so far it's just me bob and derek, but my sister is lobbying to my Dad to get a seat the car. Wouldn't matter to me if she went but eh, its gonna be a blast. But on to the real good stuff, today in class I counted every tooth in my mouth using my tounge only, sounds easy dosn't it, well it was hard for me so BACK OFF. Right now I feel as though all my classes are going horribly bad, even though nothing is going wrong in any of them it just dosn't feel right. So yea sorry for wasting your time again, but hey it was your choice to read the damn thing."

"event","Now the other day I was debating to myself on what the greatest invention to ever be created was. I was awake all night debating on whether it was the light bulb, telephone, porn, or soap. But then I got to realizing other things like maybe the greatest invention ever was never created by man, like the bermuda triangle. Thats when it hit me, BOOBS! Boobs are the best thing to be made by god's hand. They are round and glorious to look at, even better to grab onto. I love boobs and I thank god every night I go to sleep for creating such beautiful objects and giving me something to look at when I'm bored in the middle of class. Yes, if it wasn't for boob's I would probably like looking at a girls ass more, but boobs do in fact exist so I look at those way more. So that is the greatest invention, thank you god."

"event","As you all know the Oscars are tonight, and as most of u know I've never actually been in a ""real"" hollywood movie. But none the less I want to encourage you all to lobby the academy voters to vote Matt Kliemann in 2005 for the best actor award. After all life is one big movie,eh? If u help me I might thank you at the podium, that is if the house band dosn't cut me off. Well this weekend was pretty good, didn't get hammered at all but hey life goes on. Today I kinda just hung around watched the race and watched harold and kumar go to white castle. So while I was bored most of the day I had an idea. Ok, so lets say that I ,Dick Ravenswood, were to run for president. I would act like a hard ass, not really like Howard Dean, but maybe more like Teddy Roosavelt. Do you guys think my slogan should be, vote for an honest hard DICK. With that slogan I just don't think I would lose. Anyways the taste of chaos concert is coming up quick and I am pretty stoked about that. So bye.


If anyone wants to be my running mate, then give me a few reasons why you would wanna run side by side with a dick. If I choose you then my first order of business will be to give you a new desk for your office."

"event","So today was another day full of wensday fun. I know thats not how u spell wensday but thats what it sounds like so thats how I'll spell it from now on fucker. Anyways today I was thinking of a way to invade canada. That's right I refuse to capitalize the first letter of canada, those bastards don't deserve that kind of respect. I thought about it all day but realized if I invade canada then we (America) will probably end up having to bomb it somehow and change its drinking age to 21 which would suck because what would be the point in going all the way across the river if drinking there is illegal too. So it just made me realize that canada is good for one thing, drinking legally. Other then that it is just a huge waste of land. And all that was just during speech class. The rest of the day I was pretty bored, I went to barnes and noble to pick up a book, I decided I would try to read the Illiad since I liked the movie Troy. But it was too damn thick, there's no way I'm reading a book thats thicker then my English book thats for sure, so I just put the book back and used my money for more useful things, like a 24 pack of bud for the weekend. After I left the bookstore I went to the bridge, but it didn't feel the same without a chawski, and since I don't do that anymore I felt a little empty. So I went to Tim Hortons to get an Ice Cap. and mmmmmmm was it good. If the all mighty himself were to have a cappacino machine and made it every morning then froze it, then handed to the mortals it would be known as an ice cap. Anyways now I'm here typing shit so you fuckers can read about my day.



If anyone has an idea on a way to invade those dickheads to the north let me know. We got to do it in a way that the government won't mess up our good time. Random fact of the day is that John Kerry played for the Yale hockey team, just goes to show that he can make a good decision if he tries."

"event","Okay so I started up this journal because it seems to be a good waste of five minutes, when I need that five minutes to be pushed out of my life. Today began like any other day I woke up, went to class, got abducted by space aliens, invaded Wisconsin, and then came back home. But the weird thing that happened was when I got home and went upstairs to try to sleep before work and I couldn't find my remote, it just disappeared. So yea today I gotta go to work and sell car audio equipment at best buy. Still kinda don't know what I'm talking about back there but I think people buy stuff from me anyways because of my good looks. After work tonight I'll prolly just be bored, maybe I'll invent something, not really sure what I'll invent or where I'll start but I definatly feel that tonight I will invent something that will change the world. Maybe like a way to turn invisible or or a way to fly. Maybe I'll invent both of them. But I'll prolly just end up finishing some homework or something.

If you have any idea's for an invention leave ur idea's here. In return when I make millions off your idea, I will send you a christmas card for 5 years until I get too famous to talk to you."

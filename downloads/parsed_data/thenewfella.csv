"event","It's been a while. Lots happened and i really dont feel like writing it all, so i'll just give the low down. March 6th was the Subways concert. It was an amazing show. We met both the bands and talked to them. They were pretty rad dudes. It was probably the best show i've ever seen. 2 days later was The New Porn/Belle & Sebastian concert. It was a pretty good show. New Porn played without Neko Case which was a serious downgrade, and their whole performance kinda sounded off. Belle & Sebastian made up for it though. They played a great hour and 40 minute set. Stewart even let me speak in the middle of the show (if you want to check it out, go to NPR and download the whole concert webcast. I'll be the one who yells ""SUCKS"" when he asks me to say something to my boss? yeah i know, i dont have a boss). The rest of the week was confirmation preparation. We had our retreat and our mass both in the same week. Saturday was confirmation. I guess i feel more holy? I really dont know. Mickey came over a little later to crash for the night. We had an encounter with a fox that wanted to say hi. It was the scariest shit ive ever encountered. It just jumped out of the middle of the water in the creak. That was enough to make us just sleep for the rest of the night. Thats pretty much all thats happened lately. V for Vendetta comes out friday. Getting excited about that. The Arctic Monkey's show is also approaching. Less than a week to go."

"event","A 3 day weekend eh? No complaints here. so far its going pretty good. Friday night, sullivan and I went to the Hunan Chef to chow down on some chinese food. After, we proceeded to play GTA for 3 hours straight. Crazy black people... what will they come up with next? This morning sucked balls. My dad was having a power crisis. He made us do every possible chore that needed to be done. I then had a basketball game at saint james which didnt go too well. Came home and too a quick nap. Headed over to the D's for a night of cranium and chinese food. Hadn't hung out with them for a while. Tomorrow should be fun. Mr. Lyons and I are supposed to be hanging out.

Here's to your 3 day weekend."

"event","This thing is already really hard to keep up with. The past week was the same old. Today was great. Classes were short (thank god for fridays) and there was a basketball game played between the teachers and the student representatives. It was great fun. We cheered J Dubs on the whole time. The rush at the end was a memorable one. A mosh was started and wasn't too bad at all. After school Mike, Mick and I biked up to Wendy's, where we consumed all the items in the restaurant. When full, Mike returned to my house to ""hang"".. and hang we did. Watched alot of ""That 70's Show"" and played some ping pong. It was great fun for all. Mike left and I took a nap.

On another note, I made this nice looking framed poster of my KC shirt with some of the pictures with the band.

"event","What a drag of a week. The End of the quarter was today and the whole week i scrambled to find all my late homework. Bunch of science fair stuff i didnt turn in and such. It's all in and i can finally relax for the first time in a long time. This week did have its ups though.. Such as... THE NEW PORNOGRAPHERS ARE COMING TO THE 9:30 CLUB! Sad part, tickets are already sold out. But No fear, theres alot of time between now and March. In other music news, my Killers 7"" Vinyl set has finally come in.(Thus the Killers avatar)

What a joy to have. Its one great song after another... but on record. The Sleeves are really neat. The rest of the week was really just bleh. And now i have science fair breathing down my neck. Should be another great week ahead."

"event","So I was just siting at school on the computer and I remembered that I even had this thing :P
So how is Megan?  WAAAAAAAAAY too pregnant.  38 weeks on thursday...I am so miserable and I hurt more and more every day, I just want this whole part of being a mom to be over with.  Besides that...well there really is nothing besides that.  We finished the nursery about 2-3 weeks ago and it is SOOOOO cute.  The ceiling is blue, 2 walls are yellow and two walls are green.   I didnt really want a theme because there was really nothing that I liked.  I had to register at diff places and it seemed like everywhere you looked for bedding, it was either winnie the pooh or farm animals, neither of which I wanted so we just stuck with doing colors. I have gained 30lbs but you cannot really tell that I have gained that much...all of the weight has gone straight to my ass, but since my belly is so huge now it kinda even outs the ass...I had a dream last night though that I had the baby and afterwards I was really concerned about all of the weight that I had gained because I was no longer pregnant and I just looked fat.

I am still in my microbiology class and English.  I have had 3 tests in micro... 2A's and 1B.  The B kinda sucked but what can ya do?  I didnt study for it like I should have.

I am not sure if I already said that I had been excepted into the nursing program, but I have...It starts June 6th, Riley wont even be 2 months, but we will figure things out.  luckily for the summer the class is only 2 days a week , 4 hours a day, and it does not last the entire summer.
anyhoo I suppose I should get started on what I came here for... to work on my english paper."

Things are going good right now.
We still have not gotten the nursery ready but we do have everything we need to do it.  We are just slow to get things done.
I had the worse kidney stone the other day...They gave me 3 or 4 shots of morphine and a vicadin and It still hurt REALLY bad...they were about to wheel me into surgery to implant a stint in my ureter, but right as they came to get me, I passed it! yay!  it was HUGE! it came out in a big ol blood clot and it was 4mm.  I will find out on thursday what it causing me to get these...this was my 2nd one since I became pregnant.  Hopefully I do not get anymore.  My belly is getting huge...I should post a picture but I forgot my disk that has them on it...maybe I will try sometime tonight or tomorrow night when Kari is at work because there is internet access up there.
Anyhoo, I have gained 24 lbs...They say that is the perect wieght for me to gain at the point that I am at, and that 35 shold be the max by the time he is born.  They say since I am going to breastfeed that I should loose most of the weight really quickly...I hope that is the case.  My butt is HUGE, Kari says I have a mommy's butt :P
Oh well I should do some homework."

I was able to feeling him moving his foot up and down the side of my uterus, it was CRAZY, the way it felt and the fact that I was even able to identify what part of him I was feeling.  At one point it kind of tickled and hurt at the same time and it made me jump. I was neat though.
I jsut wrote an awful paper for english.  I suck at writing.  I am better at classes that I have to memorize stuff for.  I am more of a black or white person I guess."

"event","mmm...my belly is getting big.
I have gained 15 lbs so far, my doctor says that I am right on track as far as weight goes...I was PRAYING that I would not me one of those pregnant women who claim they are eating for two and gain 50lbs.  I am not sure if I already put this in here, but we decided on a name. 
Riley Osten Pele ( with a little mark above the first e) Karisson (with a mark above the a)  That is how they do last names in Iceland, and since our baby is half viking, we decided that we would follow that tradition.  
He moves all the time.  You can tell he is starting to get crowded in tehre because instead of feeling pokes and prods, I feel his entire body move, sometimes I can feel his hand or leg just run across my abdomen. Its very neat.
I am taking 3 classes this semester, Developmental Psych, English and Microbiology.  When the baby is born I will only be in Micro so that will be nice.  That will be for about a month or two, then I have two weeks off and Then I start the nursing program.  Next summer I will be a LPN and the following a RN.  VERY exciting."

This semester is almost over...THANK GOD!  It has been the semester from hell.
I received my letter of acceptance into the nursing program last week, so by next summer I  will be a LPN, and the following a RN.  :D YAY!

All Riley does these days is kick.  He kicks really hard and its fun :P  My mom bought us a crib, dresser and changing table which we got in the mail a few nights ago and I now have blisters all over my hands because I spent all night building them.  Then I laid Gracie in them and pretended she was my baby :)  it was fun, but she no likey it.

Life is going pretty well, besides money problems I can not complain.  Kari will be going back to work as soon as classes end next week, so we should be better off then.

I should go do what I came to school for."

We have pictures of his profile, of his little butt and arms and legs. so freakin cool.  at one point in the ultrasound he looked like he was boxing. :D  He does kick all the time.

My baby is kicking.

3 days until we find out if we are having a boy or a girl.  SO EXCITING!!! Then next tuesday we get my blood results back...but they said if anything came back abnormal they would give us a call, and that was 2 or 3 weeks ago, so I guess that means the baby is OK, even though the results are only about 85 percent accurate.

"event","Soooo I got a few kidney stones on Friday night.  Horrible horrible.  I had to go to the emergency room, and I was so freaked out about taking any drugs, but they gave me morphine and said that it was safe for my baby.  When I got home at about 1am, I was beat so I laid down...and my baby must have been STONED because I never have felt it move the way it was moving that night.  Usually it is just little taps, but I swear I felt the entire body do a flip, for like 3 minutes.  It was very cool. :D  Now that I have felt it move and kick though, I am a nervous wreck when I have not felt it move for a while.  I suppose that is normal though.

I will find out what we are having Nov. 17th.   WooHoo!

I have a exam in physiology in a little over a hour... not looking forward to it."

Life is kinda blah right now.  I have been feeling really depressed.  I never realized how many people stop calling you when you get pregnant.  Its like all of a sudden you have a disease. HELLO, I am pregnant not handicapped.  I can still go out and have fun WITHOUT drinking.  What do I expect though?  All of my friends are alcoholics anyway.  I can not wait to start my classes.  I will meet people who have things in common with me... Like having a parasite growing inside them. :P haha, j/k.
Seriously though, My mom is like the only person that calls me these days.  Joni calls me everyonce in a while, but I think it is just to make me feel better...I do no not think she REALLY wants to parade around town with a pregnant, girl.

School SUCKS this semester. physiology is SO boring.  I can not wait for it to be over.  I am taking Microbiology next semester, I hear that is way more interesting.

"event","this is my last week of the spring semester.  I have a month off and then I start the summer semester... anatomy...i will have no life for 8 weeks.  I am going to visit my Grandma on the 27th, AI can not wait to see her, she is wonderful.  She is making me a quilt right now...and I know that makes her seem like a boring old lady who knits all the time.  She is awesome thought.  she has a salty mouth and likes to talk about sex... its kinda disturbing but funny too.
I am excited about seeing my sister, and I will most likely spend one night with my dad, just becasue I will feel bad if I dont.

I am on pain meds because of my accident, so I have been constanley stoned :)"

When I got out of the car, I immediatley went over to make sure everyone was OK, and there she was, sitting there crying with two babies in the back seat...she was not even checking on them.  She was under 18, no license, no insurance, and the front of my truck is a mess. Then she left after I got her info, and I called the police becasue I did not know hwta else to do...to bad I have no idea what happens next.  My head hurts."

Because I do the nude modeling for the class, and I know what my boobs look like and my belly button ring, I am very confident when I say that the paintings/drawings of the nakid body are mine.

Last week... Or maybe two weeks ago, Kari and I went out with Missy and JD.  It was weird being aroudn Missy because after that shit she pulled my last week at Hope Haven, I had basically written her off.  I think because I still talked to JD that drove her crazy.  HaHa, Like I would ever have anything to do with him other than be friends.  I like thin people.  That is so vein.

My dad called me on Easter after looking at an Email that I had sent my grandma.  He wants to buy that picture that I painted of that lady ... I posted it on my jounal a while ago...I think it is still there.  I dunno if I will let him have it...he is a jerk and I do not know if I want to give him what he wants.  I want to denie him shit, like he has done to me.

It is in the 70's today.  This makes me very happy.  Winter and snow brings me down after a few weeks, althought I must admit that I look better in winter cloths than I do in summer cloths.  such is my luck.  I would say it is because my legs are so pale and pastie.  If I could wear my pantyhose in the summer with my shorts, I would be sexy :P... I guess that I will just wear skirts and dresses all summer, so that i have an excuse."

I went to look at Karis work last night and was told that Ic ould come swimming anytime I want when she is working, that is happy news, I love to swim...covered completely that is.  I used to be self conscious becuase of my wieght, and I wold not let anyone see me in a sui, but now I am worried about how pale I am.  It is icky.  Last night when we went to the grochery store, we looked at our selves in the video camera, and i was like a ghost.  Being almost translucent is some kind of punishment.

At a place where she helps take care of the mentally disabled and one as a night clerk at a hotel.  This means that i will have to do all the house work now, but that is not  a problem I guess, at least we can pay our bills again.
I signed up for an Anatomy class this summer.  That is the only class I will take.  This fall I will be taking Developmental Psych, Physiology, a CNA class and a sociology class... that is a FULL load concidering that Physiology is one of the hardest classes given at this school, besides Anatomy ( not that one I am taking, the one Kari is in now)
I went and got my eyes checked today, seems as thought I am far sighted and I am going to need to get glasses.  Lucky me, but seriously, I am kinda happy about it because I have been having so many headaches these last few months, and it is because my right eye is giving me so many problems.
Kari looks really hot today and everyone has been saying how hot HE is
I agree, very sexy. we are a cute ass couple, what can I say?

I am wearing pantyhose today, have been for the last week.  I do not like to weat underware with them, so my pubic hair hurts at the end of the day, I am sure everyone wanted to hear about that.  I shaved today :P"

In order to get into the Mortuary Science programm, I have to complete 4 more classes...but I have two semesters to finish them because the program does not start until the Fall, which is next semester and I have to finish those pre reqs.  Oh well this means i get to take 4 classes that I do not need but I would like to take, like sociology for the family, enviormental science, US government and uhmm... probably abnormal psych.  I love school :D

I ended up getting a B on my chemistry exam... I was really upset about this because I was so sure that I was going to get an A, she put up the grades in the class though, ( without names ) and 4 people got an A, 4 people got a B, 11 people got a C, 2 people got a D and 2 people got a F... so when I saw that, I did not feel that bad about my B, but I will get an A on the next test.  My goal is to get a higher grade than Kari got in this class, which was a B, but on her first test she got a C... so far I am doing better :P

I wrote the first draft of my new paper for English, it's a Persuation paper... I think this one is going to be very good.

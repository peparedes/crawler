"event","Seriously.  Nothing important here beyond what I'm writing for me.  If you value your time, you'll skip it.

Alright, so I'm having people continuously paint a picture of me that I think is not quite representative... I'll be fair:  I think they grab a portion of who I am, but they expand the one small part they're aware of to represent the whole of me.  I made that mistake not long ago with a friend's girlfriend, and he promptly argued with me about how it was wrong to asssume that my experience of the person represented the whole of that person.  The resentment I had for my friend because he had proved his point to me made me more aware of when this is happening to me and when I do it to others.  

It's an odd feeling when people consider you to be something that you're not... I have a few good examples of this;  People will continue to say that I'm smart.  I know better than most of you on that issue.  I have potential.  I can understand many things with proper attention and guidance.  I am not, however, SMART.  I have honestly made some of the dumbest mistakes I've ever heard of (short of what you'd see on COPS, of course...) and fail to apply rationality towards many decisions I make.  I am confounded most of the time, and, while I may think, that doesn't mean that I do it well.  

I also have a poster that my fellow members of Phi Gamma Delta made for me, listing constructive criticisms (everyone got one, and everyone commented on everyone else) now hanging on my wall.  Some of the things listed on it are laughable, simply because I seriously don't think that I quite fit the bill.  Many people have seen me fitting these actions, but I seriously think that they represent only a small fraction of me.  

This is what's on said poster:
1)Relax on weekends more
2)Come to more events
3)Don't overanalyze life
4)Conceding points shows an openness to think critically about onesself
5)Be more confident.  You're too hard on yourself.
6)Relax and enjoy life; go to more parties
7)Try increased/varied involvement outside of FIJI
8)Don't take all arguments seriously
9)(Perhaps the most interesting) Dead people's opinions shouldn't matter as much as your own thoughts and ideas, which are gained by living life, not reading about it.

Why this annoys me is that, if you'll notice, there are 4(!) references to argumentation and philosophising...  equally, there are another 4 that reference my involvement with people inside and outside of Phi Gamma Delta... The only other one tells me to boost my confidence.  From this, I appear to be 1) A recluse who doesn't like parties, 2) an argumentative sonofabitch, and 3) a person who lacks self confidence.  Now, those images together paint quite the picture...  I have to admit, I don't like that picture much, nor do I agree with it as the whole of who I am... few know my musical tastes, few know of my past, few know my distaste for books or why I am trying to make human-level artificial intelligence (indeed, nobody has asked any of these questions, either).  People are apparently content knowing only a portion of me...  I'm willing to be honest (to an extent... I'm not about to tell you about my sex life if I just met you on the street...) if you just ask. 

Anyway, I know that I've done things like this to people in the past, some of the more memorable ones being Chris and Pat...  Sorry, guys.  I'm trying to get better.  

Try explaining yourself to someone else honestly in your entirity sometime... my best is smiling, and having them live the whole of my life.  Realisitically, that ain't happening though.

"event","Well, that sucked.  I typed up a nice and remotely intellectual presentation on how many recent movies have been themed around man vs. society, then linking the success of such movies to the empathy of Americans towards the heroes due to their own situations.  There was then some ranting about how we have been relegated to working machines that get thrown away when used up and how we're afraid, undereducated, and not-quite-blissfully-unaware of our situations.  

But, I accidentally closed the window.  So, screw you all, you get the annotated version.  Here's a short list of movies that strike me as detailing what I've said:
The Matrix
Existenz
the Thirteenth Floor
Dark City
Donnie Darko

"event","Well, my friends, I saw it.  Today, the truck, aka THE BEAST, was driven to Pekin High to be ripped apart by any car enthusiast who has a penchant for destroying things.  In a very real way, I'm sad to see it go, and it's not because I now lose my sole means of reliable transportation, but because of the memories associated with the thing.  Recalling such memories almost brings me to tears as I write this, because, as many of you know, my father died some 3 years ago, quite unexpectedly.  To see this truck go is kind of like the last nail in his coffin for me... The memories that remind me the most of my father are those of him driving that truck around to work, taking me places in it; school, fishing, to help other people move shit, etc.  I dearly love that truck as it is my last living daily reminder of my father, my last visible vestige to him...  I know that I have my memories and other petty trinkets, and most certainly, the rest of my family, but the remarkable truck that he left me was something that I always associated with him, as though his soul somehow lived on in that noble rusting form...  I swear, that thing would never die on me, regardless of how low on gas it was, it was reliable as all get out, was falling apart but still running, it's as though the thing were giving the whole of its essence to aid me, just like its previous owner had.  I'm going to miss that truck, and if you're somehow capable of reading this, I miss you too, dad.  Would have been nice to tell you  that I love you, to talk with you whenever I had troubles, have fun as you watched me grow into a real man...  There's a lot I've missed in my life, and a lot that I still have yet to remember.  I do hope that somehow, I can live up to your image in my mind, dad.  Thanks.

"event","Well, every time I have some sort of idea or 'revelation', I just have to put it here.  The idea to throw out there today, kiddies, is one that I've been playing with a while;  Ever since seeing Serial Experiment Lain, a fascination with some of the ideas present in it (and the people mentioned in various episodes) have led me to find out what the f*ck was meant by this anime.  After a while, something came to me.  Prevalent within the story line is the thought of the collective unconscious, and mentioned within are a few key players; Jung, Leary, and Turing.  Turing has just been interesting to investigate, as his work led to the concept of the computer, and his life was more like a fairy tale than reality... But I have been focusing more on Leary and Jung.  One of the most interesting things that I have gotten out of Lain is that one of the 'bad guys' tried to activate what Leary would call the 7th switch, gear, minibrain, etc.  This is, in the mind of Leary, the part of the brain that houses the 'collective unconscious' and allows communication through telepathy.  During Lain, the fabric between individual reality and collective unconscious reality were blurred, and something that proved to be of interest to me was the concept of having one COMPLETELY shown;  By this, I mean that the masks that we adorn ourselves with would LITERALLY be thrown off as our bodies would become things of the past, and the whole of our consciousness would be accessible to everyone;  in this situation, one couldn't hide a single thing.  For many, this would be horrible and awful, but for anyone who's studied buddhism, this experience is very much likened to nirvana, the total cessation of self and the embracement of the whole of the universe.

All that is very interesting (to me at least), but a thought occurred to me recently, and I think it is built off of the previous idea:  that the more information about others that we're exposed to, the less and less that we value or contemplate the individual;  The concept of individuality has dwindled lately, spurring many to express themselves as individuals in any way they can find.  I am reminded of the concept of 'infornography' or the desire to be flooded with information (presumably about someone, but that's my interpretation); the desire to break down the barriers between us all.  I somehow liken this to one being completly 'honest', in the sense of one not hiding themselves behind secrets and answering any question posed them when asked.  Purity of intention seems a byproduct of this. 

Will keep on thinking, kiddies, and I really do need to form my thoughts, but for the sake of not forgetting, here they are.

"event","I write not for anyone who reads this, but instead for posterity, because, God willing, the earth will NOT be completely destroyed in twenty years and the Internet will still be alive and well so that I can access my wonderous treasure-trove of memories that is my Livejouranl.

Sarcasm aside, And not straining my brain too much (I've been doing only that lately, so I probably should be doing at least something else in its stead), I figured I'd write down some interesting connections that have popped up during the past few weeks.

1. Existentialism, Buddhism, Wu Wei:  There are some themes in these that one sees continuously in examining media nowadays (major motion pictures especially).  The one I find most often is where the budding hero 'finds himself' and liberates his will, throwing off some kind of oppressive ideology/power/giant evil computer that is trying to make him or her think like it wants him to.  Way back in the day, stories seemed to be about the standards: man vs. man, man vs. nature, man vs. metaphysical power, etc.  Now, a large focus is being put upon man vs. society and man vs. self.  Give it a thought sometime how often you see something pertaining to man following his will instead of anyone else's in this day and you, too, will be amazed.  Oh how the mindsets have shifted.

2. Forgiveness, Time, Meaning of the moment:  Thank C.S. Lewis and perhaps the many years of christian schooling, but I think I've finally gotten this forgiveness thing down.  If someone transgresses against you, the first thing that should come to your mind is 'was this an accident, will it happen again?'  If the answer is 'yes', then your efforts should be towards trying to show another why your methodology or way of thinking is right (no taking the moral high ground on this one, folks...).  If your answer is 'no', though, you should forgive such a transgression against you;  Holding a grudge when someone is genuinely sorry for their action is pointless:  What does it do besides cause more problems?  In reading Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse, another thought presented itself to me:  The past is past, the future is uncertain, and where we are is in the moment.  We can peer into the future trying to figure where it will go, but we ultimately must start working towards that future in the present, or else that idea will remain only an idea.  The idea of past goes with forgiveness, the idea of the future being nonexistant is very real, and the idea that we have to focus on what we can do to make our ideas reality makes a lot of sense.  I would say that, if you're looking for strange connections, the idea is present in Nietzsche as well...

At this point, it would be fair to state that I'm starting to have a strangely Murakami-ish feeling about these connections... for any who haven't given him a read (I recommend it, fun writing style and imaginitive worlds), one thing he'd do for 'Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World' would be to have a title for a chapter that named three completely unrelated things.  Through the chapter, you would see how these seemingly unconnected items became woven into the story, all being bound by what happened to the main character.  Just something to think about.

3. Truth.  Thank you goes out to Keith Sewell who wrote an interesting paper about the nature and usage of the concept Truth.  In abbreviated form, truth is used as an independent information source.  To claim that one has found truth, one presents evidence.  The disciplines that can show consistent evidence that can be observed and understood are Science.  The disciplines that cannot are Religion.  The problem with Religion is that the basis for making a truth claim is born from something that is inherently unprovable;  be it your mystical book, dream, or startling revelation, one cannot explain clearly the reasons why one believes as they do.  As he stated, 'someone had to have initially bought the damn thing'.  For me, this coincides with my desire to understand why people think as they do.  I STILL do not understand why people accept some assumptions based off of something that, when carefully analyzed or subject to scrutiny, does not make a great deal of sense...  

4.  Desire.  We all have 'em, they're not the same within every one of us, but we have our own desires.  This will be somewhat along the lines of #1 up top, but I'm thinking now that people are unhappy whenever their natural desires (the ones they come with, inherent desires, if you will, NOT to be equated to survival instincts) go unsated, and a large reason that they go unsated is because people have been taught to accept something else in their stead:  The desires and ambitions of society, of friends, etc.  A lot of this enlightenment stuff (again with Siddhartha) appears to be a person finding what makes him happy (for some, it may be a large house and lots of money, etc. whereas for Siddhartha, he could not STAND that lifestyle) and doing it, but he has to know WHAT MAKES HIM HAPPY.  So much of this movement towards the individual has been people seeking to live their lives and fulfill their desires, and so we enjoy seeing them finding themselves and devoting their beings towards their desires once they've found 'em.  Next time you feel mopey, try and find something that is important to you, and I guarantee, you'll find the energy to do it.

5. Wasn't quite expecting a 5, but since we're here, The Ego.  Freud did a nice job of giving a visualization for its workings, and it just seems to work for me.  See below for more detail on that.  In Siddhartha, one thing that Siddhartha finds is that he needs to live his life without ego to be happy and completely sever himself from the world.  YOU EITHER CAN BE IN THE WORLD OR YOU CAN DECIDE NOT TO BE.  I throw this in because this would be number 6, except that's pretty much all it is... You decide how involved in the world of others you're going to get, and so you control how much the world affects you.  Back so Siddhartha;  So, Siddhartha finds that he can sever himself from the world all he wants (he became an ascetic and tormented himself until he could escape his self for a period of time and feel nothing...) but he had not been able to sever himself from his ego;  When he was an ascetic, he looked upon everyone else who was involved in the world as 'child-people' and thus demean them, putting himself always above them.  When he BECAME one of them, he could not stop his self-loathing because his life had become meaningless.  Once he realized that he wanted to be rid of his ego instead of the world, he then found his peace.  I am not quite sure how to go about this, I've always thought that a person's view of themselves in relation to others was somehow intertwined with their being, but, hey, what do I know.  Still and interesting idea, one that I wouldn't mind trying sometime.

7. (guess I might as well go on one more since I already did 6) - The world really does work in mysterious ways.  We DO NOT understand them all, but that does NOT mean we should STOP TRYING...  Try and learn a little Jung or perhaps some Timothy Leary, or maybe magic does exist, or Evangelion got it right with the AT Field thing(!), etc. etc. etc..  Thinking something is impossible only limits your capacity to imagine that it might be real...  If you can understand why something isn't, that's fine.  Do NOT, however, ASSUME something isn't based on something you DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND.  I trust anyone who's reading this (including myself) to be capable of thought and rich in imagination.  Try and come up with your own all-encompassing belief system and prove how you're right.

(Andrew already got a head start with How Santa Claus is God, so Good job, Andrew!)


That's it for the rants today, hopefully, something to think about, and also, something to remember for when I'm feeling old, gray, and tired.  God knows I'm feeling that way when I'm only 21.

"event","Since my previous rant was interrupted (see below), I will continue the second point here:

2. There are only three ways in which a belief can be formed.

This might seem a bit out there and inconsequential, but my line of thinking is that the differences in people can be attributed to a difference of their beliefs.  This led to me asking what exactly caused such a difference in these basic beliefs, and so far, I have only come to one conclusion:  There are three ways in which a belief can be created, but it is so far unclear which of these or which combination of these is correct.  

The first way in which a belief can be formed is as an extension of desire.  Imagine, if you will, a large ball of glowing energy that represents your self (this will start to sound like Freud, and that's perfectly fine.  So far, his is the best likeness to this process that I have found).  Now, from that energy that is your self extends tendrils which represent your desires.  These desires, if unstopped, will cause you to take action to satisfy these desires.  Understand, your desires form their own form of repression of other desires (such as your desire for companionship will repress your desire for sex if you're married or your desire to eat is repressed because your desire to have enough of an appetite for a good meal overpowers it).  In this view, desires and how you sate them or repress them form your belief structure.  

The second way in which a belief can be formed is through behaviourism.  If the previous argument was the likeness of ""Nature"", then this one is ""Nurture"".  As has been said before, one could simply 'learn through blows' the right and wrong of the world as well as what to believe.  An example of this would be the person who makes a joke in a school cafeteria, recieves laughs and praise for doing so, and so continues to do so until he does not get any more chuckles from pulling such stunts or the person who believes religion primarily because it makes his parents happy that he does so.

The third method in which belief can be formed is something that has been puzzling me for a while.  The last option, as best I can tell, is through the use of 'free will'.  We decide what basic beliefs to adopt and adhere to those beliefs.  To me, this does not make sense because (and I realize this prejudice) I think that if you believe something, it has to have its causes.  The only way that this 'free will' argument for the creation of beliefs makes sense to me is if the choice is completely arbitrary in the mind of the chooser, as when one decides whether to have tuna or ham when one feels hungry, yet craves neither.  This, to me, would be the most disturbing means of all for beliefs to be formed because this would suggest that our beliefs are ARBITRARILY CHOSEN and our actions that arise because of those beliefs are founded upon beliefs that are arbitrary.  If anyone has another interpretation of free will that allows, without reliance upon the other two means, a way of forming belief, I'd be happy to hear it.  

So far, that's what I've got.  This thought is still in its infancy, and I'm trying to think about it more, but your input is welcome.  Thanks for reading (I know this is a lot, though the thoughts are relatively simple), and I hope to have given you something to think about/argue against.  Please enjoy, and have a happy holiday season-time.

"event","Alright, break has begun and I am thoroughly enjoying the fact that I now get about double (maybe triple!) the sleep that I did last semester.  I have been thinking on a lot of things, and as such, I'd like to impart some of the results of this thinking to provide some spark to the thinking of others.

1.  We are losing our concept of humanity.  

Let's face it, people.  With the advent of the internet, we've become infinitely more close to each other.  There was a time when we were in our own little secluded worlds and all was well and good, we could believe as we wanted, think anything we wanted abouit anyone we wanted.  Then the world got a little closer... Enter the radio.  Suddenly, we can hear the opinions and ideas of others from around the world!  Our interconnectivity jumped at that time.  Enter somewhere around 1940-50 (not sure when exactly), and the Television makes its debut.  Much like the radio, this invention connects us to our fellow men, but, unlike the radio, it does so with sight as well as sound.  The radio was practically a man speaking out of a box.  With the television, you saw the man AND you heard him speaking.  A new level of connectivity is thus reached.  Now, this leads to some interesting things:  First, we see something like the Civil Rights movement.  People had, up to this time, thought little of their fellow humans being oppressed because, while they were remotely aware of this oppression, they had not seen nor experienced it directly and in massive quantity.  The television and literature of the time now bring this issue into focus, as people see other people bombarded by water cannons, attacked by trained killing dogs, and beaten mercilessly by policemen.  This is a bit of a shock to a person, because, after seeing such an event, you CANNOT deny that such things are happening without being delusional.  As a result of this media attention, many people's minds were swayed towards the suffering of their fellow humans (if one thought about it, there was little to seperate the black man from the white one, either mentally or physically, though that didn't stop some people from trying to find such differences).  Thus, on a national scale, we see a movement towards respecting one's fellow human beings, and a good deal of that is thanks to this new interconnectivity breaking through the apathy of years gone by.  Flash forward a few years to the Vietnam War.  Few knew what was really going on over there, and, frankly, few cared.  We were merely fighting another war, just cause or not, and our soldiers were fighting and doing their duty.  Enter the media again.  People were happily living their lives inside a bubble, thinking that nothing too bad was going on over in Vietnam until journalists and cameramen went over and brought back real footage and a persistent body count.  The sheer loss of life and anguish on the battlefield was enough to shock people out of their dormant existence and cause them to realize that war isn't great, grand, or nice.  As the body count soared, people began questioning the motives for the war;  After all, if you're spending so many American lives on a project that doesn't seem right in the first place, somebody's got some explaining to do.  People demanded either a GOOD reason for the war (in their eyes, mind you... fighting to keep some Vietnamese independent was a little too far out of the scope of most, which only serves to show that apathy for others around the world had already set in, but I'll get to that later) or that the suffering of American soldiers be ended and that the soldiers be brought home.  This sense of connectiveness brought about by the newscrews over in Vietnam grasped the American public and wrenched them from their simple lives and forced them to realize how brutal the war was, how REAL the war was.  After that, we saw a movement towards humanity again as many fought against the government to 'bring the boys home'.  The soldiers were only young Americans, after all, with their own lives to live and their own hopes, dreams, and desires.  These were people being put into harms way, and the reasoning behind this was insufficient to warrant the risk. Many such examples can be seen in modern history where a people are completely apathetic about something until they become fully aware of what is going on, until they are exposed enough to an event to become empathetic to the people being oppressed/sent into danger/persecuted, what have you.

So, this brings me to the thought that because of our vast interconnectivity, we've become less and less empathetic towards each other.  

With the dawning of such great interconnectivity in time, we have continually been exposed to more and more people.  With the advent of cities and suburbs, we've become exposed to more people than in the days of vast country and farmland everywhere.  This exposure to so many people has caused a DEvaluation of people in general in our lives.  Think about this:  How many people do you pass each day while walking around that you wouldn't even give a second thought to?  You realize (and perhaps say to yourself) that they're people, but you do not even try to get to know them.  They BECOME stereotypes, generalizations, simple mockeries of themselves, all because you don't have the time to get to know each one individually beyond their stereotype.  What I am saying here is that we are assaulted with so much information, exposed to so many people in our day to day workings that we HAVE to stereotype, else we'd get overloaded on information (and not get too much done).  Here's a thought exercise.  If you were trapped on an island with one person, would you get to know them?  Would your desire for human contact drive you towards that person even if they're a jerk, someone completely unlike you, etc., and would they in turn not be driven towards you?  Would you AT LEAST get to know this person well enough to say ""I genuinely don't like this guy and would rather spend my time alone than with him"" ?  I say that we would.  Now, imagine yourself alone on an island with two people.  Same outcome, right?  How about five, ten, twenty, two-hundred?  The higher we go up in number, the more we realize that we begin to shrug off our feeling of sympathy and empathy towards one another, that we instead form close friends and leave everyone else out of our little circle.  The problem with this is that 200 people is maybe a small community, and we could agree that you might get to know each person in great detail if exposed to them enough times, but imagine something like a city, a nation, or perhaps, the world...  You're suddenly looking at 1000+ people that you're NOT going to get to know well.  You DO NOT feel connected to this large mass of people because you don't know many of them (nor is it really possible to get to know many of them).  So, what do you do?  You stereotype.  You also do something else;  A desire we all have is to be a part of something, to feel connected to something, so we find ourselves a group of people like ourselves and we try to fit in.  In our desire to have friends and fit into something greater than ourselves, we ultimately form a basis for others to stereotype us as.  If you're a ""churchie"", for example, you go to church all the time, you stay with the people from your church, you define yourself by that relationship, and that is precisely how others will define you as well.  In your desire to feel connected to a group, you find your group, be yourself (for the most part), and enable others to form a blanket stereotype of you.  

Admittedly, this is interesting, but this leads towards another point:  Since we all form stereotypes of each other outside of our own tiny group of friends, we BEGIN TO SEE OTHERS AS LESS THAN HUMAN.  

This will seem an odd comment, but if you consider whether you value your friends more highly than you do any other human, you're devaluing the rest of humanity.  If you were the CEO of a company and your close friends were working under you, would you pull some scam to make millions but leave your friends in the dirt?  If your friends were being governed by you, would you accept bribes and oppress them?  The point I'm making is this:  We, being exposed to so many people, have lost our sense of sympathy and our ability to put ourselves in others' positions.  Apathy has overcome us all, and we're not even trying to break free.  Only when someone comes up with something so shocking that it chills us to the bone do we even consider that maybe, MAYBE we should have done something different.  

My last tidbit of advice is to Be aware of what you do.  Think about others and how they think about you, and maybe, just maybe, you can change the world.

Okay, so I'll admit that I might want to flesh out the latter part of that a bit more, I do have more to say, especially to recommend what people can do to help with this situation... but, it being Christmas and all, Andrew just came over and we're getting gifts, so I'll get to this later.  Have fun.

"event","Well, I've been at this a few minutes, and it appears that it's evolved from a simple poem to someting a small bit grander... I'm actually going through what I can envision and figure a couple of different views about life and what it means... interesting concept, that...

Human, too human after all...

questions for a meandering mind:

What does it mean to be human?  
Is it something quite trivial or grand?
is it simple, or hardened, or yellow or purple,
is it as solid on the ground which you stand?

What does it mean to be human? 
We're all only human after all...
so what does it mean to be caught at the scene
breaking this unscribed and far-fetched law?

What does it mean to be human? 
perhaps it is something that only time can tell?
perhaps meant to be shrouded behind the mists of our minds,
protected from prying by untouchable shell.

What does it mean to be human?
A sleight of fate and a twist of hand?
A nonsensical ride throughout the land?
a tortured plight which none can stand,
A place without answers yet not lacking demand?

What does it mean to be human? 
A view for a vagabond, a spectacle of spectacles,
each of us crafting our own,
but whatever light we see through our eyes,
reflects only a shard of what's shown?

The answers that present:

So, what does it mean to be human?
To fight bravely for our cause!
to enjoy the battle, and when the day is won,
to carry on without a pause!

So, what does it mean to be human?
To wither and waste away...
to spend our lives seeing others die,
and callously languish the day...

So, what does it mean to be human?
A sacrifice, life given of self, 
A living of life towards God,
in that lies a true life's wealth.

So, what does it mean to be human?
The pursuit of that which men value
is only what interests me,
without businessman, briefcase, and banknote, 
what other life could there be?



Wow, that really could use some amount of development, but I rather like where it's going...  The concept of trying to understand why people believe as they do still amazes me... I'm still trying to understand it all.

People find meaning to life.  Do you find meaning in meaning?

The world is still a very creepy scary funny fantastic place, and I, while having my very rough moments, am thoroughly enjoying myself.  

Oh, and existentialism is a fun class.  Gotta love the mentality. Neat thoughts too...

I'm also considering starting on something that felt quite strange yet necessary;  something much akin to Thus Spoke Zarathustra, but voicing the opinion of a boisterous fellow who isn't nearly as laid back as Z.  This fellow is a Nihilist in the darkest sense of the word;  He's out to destroy, and only destroy.  A madman kamikaze suicide bomber of thought... just sounded fun to me, and would certainly be a hoot to write.  Character would be named Ezekiel, methinks.

Anyway, share thoughts/comments/life/anything with me, and don't be afraid to add to that poem thingamabobber I started with some view of your own.

""I am the cannon, my word is the shell.  You can either rebuild as I destroy your foundations, or feign ignorance as the shots whistle past your head!""
-Ezekiel"

"event","If Scholastic bowl taught me anything, it is that jonas salk created the vaccine for polio (the only question I ever answered correctly) and that there are two kinds of Truth.

This is an excerpt from the notebook;

""There are two distinct kinds of Truth; That which is meaningful in that it contributes to the goals and advancements of humanity and society, and there are those that are meaningless beyond being mere gossip or the satiation of some trivial curiosity.""

The next line of thinking was ""Now, what is the meaningful truth"" followed by ""What is human advancement"".

A line I rather liked from the sleep-deprived ramblings was the thought that, in this light, ""One can fill up on truths and still know nothing.""

I started pondering the dog chasing his tail again, and decided I like direction.  (Good old vectors) :D

Anyway, I'm having fun in the philosophy forum, and hope you're all doing well.  

Mark:  ""I'm alive and doing fine!""

Peace out."

"event","Disclaimer:  In no way, shape, or form is Mark, hitherto called 'the writer', through measures of pressure, coercion, or blackmail, forcing you to read this document.  The writer assumes no responsibility for you being pissed with what he writes, nor does he apologize for anything he says until proven wrong.  If you agree that you can't hold any of this against the author, proceed with caution.


Well, kiddies, I'm having a good time.  I have become sick with drama (almost to the point of humor, but I've been seeing waaaaaaaaay too much of it lately), and as such, respectfully request that you all stop fucking life up for a short while so that I may take a nap.  

That aside, I've decided that I will go forward with my writing project, but I will put it together piece by piece in a writing style not unlike Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra.  What can I say?  I like the concept of a character being put into a world and then telling his side of the story, acting the mouthpiece for your humble narrator.  

If I have become all that I have hated, (namely, if I'm starting to force my views upon everyone else), We're all screwed anyway.  Perhaps this is the ranting of a madman, but I figure that I can either really help the world out, or really fuck it up.  Hopefully, you will not have known the next Hitler.  

I still have no clue how this beautiful thing called a human works... I really think it is directly tied to his belief, but I haven't gotten much further with that.  

I've probably turned into the liberal hippie douche.  If you have sand in your vagina, just gimme a call.

I am a very critical person.  I still miss many problems with myself, and I still fail to realize many more things.  I'm trying to become more self-aware so that I might not be doomed to my fate of ignorance of self.

Being Mother Theresa isn't too hard;  Simply adapt her beliefs.

It will be a neat thing when I die (and please, do not assume anything bad will happen as a result of this statement;  I'm not exactly suicidal) because then I will see the answer before me to so many questions;  It's rather like not knowing how to do a problem in math and, while still trying (again and again), the answers book happens to flip right to the page you need and you catch a spread-eagle view of that elusive answer you've been seeking.  

I'm scared when I think that, without absolutes, one could very simply switch out his morals and codes like clothing, adorning his new robes to fit his situation;  I know that someone will question this, so, in this statements defence;  One's concept of self is much like an absolute;  I am this way because of this or that.  I believe this way because of this.  If your reasons for believing something are called into question (which isn't too hard) then you become capable of believing something else;  If you believe also that your beliefs aren't absolute, then you become capable of trying out different perspectives, of believing different things because you can.  You can then make yourself into any creature you want by simply choosing the beliefs that are best for your situation and goal.  Thou shalt not kill?  Killing is fine if they're opposing your God.  Thou shalt not steal?  Stealing is fine if one is successful enough to rule the world.  Thou shalt not lie?  The truth has no place for you if you can make a political career out of lies.  Even the most devout of people do the same... Thou shalt care about thine moneys and seek more of it for the power it brings;  One can give to the poor so that they may live.  Look who's making the rules, people.  

I've had to seriously rethink my story thanks to Chris and an ongoing debate regarding forcing people to think for themselves.  I eventually have to agree that it is much easier to wait for people to show an interest first, but I still think that few are even aware there was a choice, let alone knew their options.  As to whether one is justified in trying to spread their ideas and forcibly jolting people out of their lives so that they might see the message more clearly, I'll answer with the most agnostic of phrases possible;  I don't know.  Just know, that hasn't stopped me from thinking.

I still ask if the dog chasing his tail is enviable.

For Chris;  Moving from supergrass is an awfully fun song.  Look it up if you haven't already.

This has been fun, and I am trying not to get philosophical on people in normal life and am slowly succeeding.  Just remember, you read this of your own volition.  

Goodnight."

"event","Well, I can say that the 24-hour attempt was a LOT of fun for both myself and andrew (and I can't top his ranting skills, so I'm not going to try).  I'll post those pictures soon.

Thanks to andrew, I'm shutting up about philosophy.  Chris tried telling me this earlier, but my ears tend to be dulled by years of classical concerts (those damn classical fans!).  Anyway, from here on in, I'm not going to argue philosophy with people I know UNLESS THEY ASK FOR IT (and, arguing about something philosophically is asking for it;  be forewarned).  It has led to too many people getting pissed off at me and generally not wanting to talk.  I love talking, people, I love joking, I love poking fun, but I have my own hobbies which apparently few people share.  I'll keep the arguments where they belong.  Consider yourselves safe, and enjoy yourselves.  

If ever I figure something out, You'll be the second to know.

So, thanks to everyone for wheting my curiosity, at least as long as you have. I'll seek my answers elsewhere.

"event","Well, good readers, (all 4 of you) I wanted to apologize.  Methinks that I've been playing both sides of the field as of late and have only come to recognize my problem within the past day or so.  

Earlier, I went on quite the rant about how people should search for Truth (with a capital T) and how that should be the most important goal in their lives besides survival.  Then I posted a thought on how how people percieve themselves is how they really are.  

For those of you not seeing the error, I'll explain. (Chris, I imagine you can skip this part)

First, I claim that people should search for Truth.  This alone seems fine, but many arguments can be raised against it, namely that people do not need truth to live and in fact, many enjoy not having it.  Point being, gang, that one does not need Truth to live.  I merely advocate it.  Thanks to talks with Chris, I figured out that I have a great curiosity towards it (coupled with a skepticism of the word of those who proclaim to have it).  So, Truth is a plaything to me, something I like and I actively search for, but it is not necessary to much of anything.  I still think that people should at least be aware of whether they're representing Truth or truth.  I will likely never waiver on that.

Second, I posted the other day that I thought that the man who thought he was a butterfly was indeed a butterfly, as no-one else could really disprove him and it was only his perspective of himself that mattered to him.  I might have to retract this statement, simply because, once I got to thinking on it, this makes no sense if one values Truth, placing it above all else.  Psyche buffs, beware!  Carl Rogers, one of the noted Humanist Psychologists, had the idea of the Self and the image of the Self.  The Self was who you are in terms of reality (by my definition, cap T Truth).  For example, I am only capable of lifting maybe x lbs with one hand and have green eyes.  The Image of the self was what I called a person's avatar.  This is the image that one has of himself.  Furries would imagine themselves as animals, some men may imagine themselves as women, women imagine themselves as men, etc..  Well, Rogers stated that the problem lies when your image of yourself is not in line with Reality.  I am superman and can reflect bullets off of my manly chest and leap from 10 story buildings and be alright because I can fly.  As you can see, that idea of self is something that is very dangerous to the individual and is highly incorrect when compared with Reality as we know it.  

Problem arises for me when I think that I praise Truth above all, yet I am more than willing to allow that people may delude themselves into thinking they are something that they are (as best we can tell) not.  

My head now hurts.  The only thing I can figure is that one needs objectivity to accurately claim one way or another.  I know, I know, people claim that one cannot see things objectively.  

<<Aside to chris>> if you think I'm an alien, then, to you, I am an alien.  Now, is that true, I cannot answer you certainly, nor can I imagine a way to find out an answer.  In order to obtain an answer, I would need objectivity in order to know certainly the Truth of the matter.  Thanks for the thought project.  <<aside over>>

By the way, a disturbingly good movie (one which has intriguing parallels to the search for Truth) can be found in the anime A Wind called Amnesia.  Look it up sometime.  Fun for the whole family!  Thinking, memory loss, ideas of curiosity, Truth, and pointless nudity!  Seriously.  Those Japanese have a strange want to put bare breasts in places where they really aren't necessary.  Anyway, look it up.  If you want my interpretation, let me know, I'll post it later.

On to more thought projects, figuring the vectors before travelling them, more remaining stationary and quickly descending into a scary kind of removed.  Boy, I need to hear what he means by that.

Have fun, kiddies."

"event","Just a few fun thoughts and observations:  

1.  The man who thinks he is a butterfly/woman/anthropomorphic creature could very well be right... Who are we to say otherwise just because we can percieve the physical interpretation of the person?  It does matter who/what you think you are, not just what you appear to be.  The concept of the physical being the defining characteristic of who we are has been obliterated in my mind.  Levinas, you douche.  I'd murder you, except that you'd claim that's what would happen. <Levinas is dead>

2.  Religion is a nasty little subject at times, but I'm really beginning to understand what it means to repress one's own desire for the sake of showing love to your diety(s).  It seemed funny to me that when Nietzsche claimed that morality is the anti-nature that any religious person would not contest it in the least.  Morality and one's adherence to it is a sign to one's diety(s) that one is willing to show strength by overcoming their own desires and, by their actions and repressions, prove their love.  Now, it in no way means that their belief is correct (and the religious who understand their religion realize this), but, since they believe what they do, they find their own way to 'worship' their diety(s), one that isn't based on fear and loathing (cough, catholocism) but on a genuine love of their diety(s) and what they think their diety(s) has given to them.  If you'd like a more comprehensive view on this, catch me online.  Also, see the story entitled 'The cookie-cutter life and the third house on the left' from earlier to help explain the whole concept.  

3.  Wow, people's beliefs affect everyone.  I'm still stupefied that so many people fail to realize that what they have are beliefs, not Truth.  I really would like to make the world more aware of this somehow.  I personally think it would cause people to respect each other more, but, hey, even that is just a belief.  Next time you get peeved or happy or sad or pissy, ask yourself what belief is behind your feeling and causing you to feel that way.  If you dare, then question your own belief and ask whether that represents the way things really are.  

4.  I'm agnostic, but not in a post-modern sense (stupid philosophical definitions).  Go figure. 

5.  People are very interesting, almost akin to baubles, but I wouldn't want to degrade everyone so, yet, you're all so curious to me!

6.  Upon introduction, one states their name.  ""Who are you?""  ""I am Bill Smith.""  Have you ever thought how pathetic a response that is, how little it actually explains about you, how much it ties you to a label of a name and a face to be confused with the rest of your being?  I envision an amorphous blob turned avatar inside everyone, and they form it up however they please, and it doesn't necessarily have a damned thing to do with their face or name or anything besides being able to tell one blob from another for distinction.  ""Blob a, come over here.""  ""Blob b, get me a screwdriver.""  How little we think about such things.  Someone asks you who you are, how are you going to respond next time?  ""I'm Joe Schmo"" or ""I'm an entirely different being capable of holding beliefs and thinking of my right mind and possessing numerous amounts of traits and skills and hopes and dreams and desires, but you can call me Bill.""

7.  Stupid Levinas.  I'm beginning to think like him.  In describing my amorphous ball (avatar), I'd have to say that it changed quite rapidly with what I learn and feel and what's going on at the time.  I have an odd ability to see things from anothers' perspective, and in doing so, begin to understand their perspective.  I only curse Levinas here because some of his stuff is starting to make sense in the context of certain beliefs.  

From one amorphous blob to another, Hi.

Have a Good one, kids, and ""Very merry un-birthday toooooooooo youuuuuuuuuuuuu!"""

"event","Two thoughts have come to my mind today, the first being something funny and sad at the same time.  The other, simply a thought experiment.

First, while talking with Claire, one of the starters at work, he began recounting the way things used to be before world war II.  I rather enjoyed hearing him speak about being able to pick  berries, gather walnuts, hunt for food, mother bakes nine loaves of bread every three days, etc.  We finally came to the point of him getting a job.  He was twenty-four when he got his first non-farm related job which payed him $33 an hour.  This, he said, was relative to  about $800 a week by todays standards, and this was minimum wage. He also spoke about how one could walk anywhere in Peoria without being afraid of being robbed, shot at, or molested.  Well, thought I, sparked by what he was saying, that was the american dream that everyone always keeps searching for?  Eventually, I figured that it was the idea that if a person worked hard and lived honestly, he could have a wife, house, car, and 2.4 children, all living comfortable lives and he and his wife could retire and live comfortably the rest of their lives at some point.  The observatin that I made at this point was that the american dream was dead!  Anymore, due to globalization and the desire to 'be competitve,' which generally puts profit above human welfare, job security is at an all time low.  The dream of being assured that your hard work will provide for your family and that companies will take care of their hard workers has ended with outsourcing and cheap foreign labor working its way into our country. As a result, things are cheaper, but at what cost to the lives of our fellow countrymen, indeed, to our very dream of security?  The snake in the grass has bitten the heel of the United States, and we, as a result, have forgotten that the very reason that so many came to our nation in the first place is being continually destroyed by shoddy business practices and profit goals in an effort to be competitive.  Our grand golden idol has won out, people, and we're all going to suffer because of it.  I hope you're happy, because on this issue, I am not.

Secondly, 

Do you envy the dog who chases his tail?

Andrew's birthday is tomorrow, and I need MC Chris' Birthday song lyrics so I can rap his ass off at his party :D

Peace out, and thanks for listening, even if you didn't."

"event","Just so you know, I'm going to try and finish writing that story that I began barebonesing earlier, and as such, I will post what I've written when I write it.  Any and all comments and criticism are welcome (I know I'm not the best with words).  Here goes the story:

Story of the World

	I walked solemnly up the brick path to the small house, marvelling as I went past at the diverse foliage surrounding the place.  Most greenery was kept in small domes interspersed in public parks through the dense, cold cities, defiantly contrasting, but invariably bound to, the cold glass, concrete and steel all around them.  The plants around here were growing calmly, unhindered by regulators, trimming mechanisms, or anything else that would stop them from growing wild and unkempt;  to me, this wild vegitative haven was beautiful.
	As I approached the house, I was confronted with a simple wooden gate;  I was amazed by this, so little real wood existed outside of the parks that to see some employed elsewhere left me awestruck.  I pushed aside this small bit of amazement and continued up the path towards the house;  This too seemed a little out of place, as the world was covered with large skyscraper apartments, each invariably looking like the others around it.  This house was small, only a single floor, and it was ornately decorated outside, adding to the air of oddity around this place.  ""Such an inefficient use of space,"" somewhere deep in my mind told me, but I ignored it like I always have.  Wandering up the steps, I was met with a quaint white door with a single window and an intricate brass handle, another far cry from the other parts of the City where lifeless steel intelli-doors greet you coldly wherever you travel.  Mustering up my courage, I pressed the doorbell and waited.  After a few seconds, a shuffling of feet echoed through the door, and an almost pained grunt signaled that someone was coming to answer my call.  The door creaked open slowly (""strange,"" I thought, ""that there was no lock, for surely I would have heard it."").  A wrinkled face greeted me, the face of the man I had come to see.  
	""Who are you, and what do you want?"" asked the wrinkled figure through the crack in the doorway.  Carefully and cautiously, for I had practiced this many times before, I replied:  
	""Who I am matters not, but I come here with great reason;  I yearn for answers to questions.""
	""What do you seek, good stranger, in regard to your questions?""
	At this, I became noticeably nervous;  I had been told to expect the first question, but had not been wanred about a second. 
I began fumbling for answers. Eventually, I accepted that I could only be honest from there on in, and hoped that my answers would carry me.  ""I seek Truth, and simply that.""
	The old man's eyes took on a look of suspicion, and with a voice shrill and cold, he said ""If you seek entertainment, I can dance and sing and tell stories until the sun has set and risen a hundred times.  If you seek enlightenment, perhaps I can help you along the path, playing the role of both guide and tutor aiming towards peace and happiness.  But if it is Truth you seek, then I'm afraid you've come to the wrong place.""  
	At this, he began to close the door.  I quickly began to speak, pleading with him to allow me entrance.  ""You once searched for Truth, and I have now undertaken the same journey.  Please allow me to learn what you know, what you've experienced throughout your life;  I don't want bastardizations, I don't want hype and misinformation, I just want to know what you really think!""
	His brow curled even more, but his voice betrayed a certain hint of curiosity.  ""What does it matter what I think, young one?""
	I thought for a second, and simply replied, ""What you said and did changed the world, but so many have failed to realize it and have forgotten about you.  I only try to understand why you thought, said, and did what you did.""
	A wry smile creeped over his face at my utterance, and he asked, ""and what good will this information do you, young stranger?""
 	I again had to stop and think.  ""It will do me little good beyond satisfying my curiosity and perhaps aiding my journey with another perspective to view the world with.""  I had answered honestly, and I hoped he would accept my humble plea."

"event","Well, I recently went to see the Andrew Lloyd Weber play, Cats.  Now, I have seen it before, heard it MANY times at home (someone in our family really liked the music), and have watched it on TV.  It NEVER occured to me to listen to the lyrics and think about it.  HOLY CRAP!  The play is fun to watch and the music is very catchy (and you have to love some of the characters) but I think I had a bit of a trash-can revelation while thinking about some of the lyrics;  I took notes at the performance (decided to have a little fun and the program came with a notes section... what kind of production does that!?!) and made a couple of interesting connections.  This stuff is rather obvious, so I'm not patting myself on the back too much, but it has given me something to think about.  

1) The Jellicle(?) cats have 3 names:  Their home name, their fancy proper name, and their individual name that is unlike any other's.

One can equate this to humans;  We have our birth name, what everyone knows us by, then we have formal titles like doctor, professor, etc., still accepted, and then we have our own individual name unlike anyone else's... To me, this is our selves, the special combination of thoughts, actions, experiences that make us us.  There will only be one us, and that us may very well never be known to anyone but ourselves.

2) The frequent mention of the meaning of what happiness is and reincarnation (living another life).

 Well, I haven't completely figured it out yet, but the connection made in the play was that once one knows what the meaning of happiness is, he can start life anew.  Methinks this means that once has found happiness and their means of attaining it, they can begin life frequented by happiness instead of misery longing for fleeting moments of happiness that one had in times gone by.  More on this later:

3) A crack by the Theatre-cat about the young'uns being able to jump through hoops and patting themselves on the back about it

I had to laugh at this (no one else did), primarily because it's quite the true observation;  (warning, rant ahead) We as a people are beginning to think that because we are capable of earning degrees and learning methodologies (thus the jumping through hoops) we are some kind of great beings;  My friends, I think that it is not method but means of figuring one's way there that makes one great.  Of course I'm using borrowed words, but curiosity is better than knowledge.  

4) The concept of MaCavity (he's a mischievious cat who does bad things) intrigues me;  As his song suggests, he was never at the scene of the crime which could mean he was fleet of foot to get out or that *he never actually was there*.  Everything bad always happened, no-one saw macavity do it, so I began wondering if he was perhaps an explanation of random causality  (blame it on the cat, so to speak).  Also, if Macavity did in fact not exist, then he was merely an explanation of all the bad that happened around;  He became the embodiment of evil, much like the christian concept of the devil.  Or, he was just a sly cat who did bad things.  That's likely the case.

5) During the moving song Memory, it appears as though happiness is explained (Touch me and see what happiness is!) as lending a helping hand out to those who are downtrodden and despised;  The cat who sings Memory used to be beautiful, now she's ugly and despised.  I'm wondering if Weber's interpretation of this is that people need to help each other out, relieving our continual loneliness and pulling us out of our ignorant misery and self-hate.  Think about that sometime.  Love=happiness?  Helping others achieve and bloom like self-made seeds, breaking out of their shells to enjoy the wonderful sunlight that they've been hiding themselves from all the years.

Finally, 

It appears that cats are NOT dogs (an odd lyrics, but one that really hits home).  Cats, in this sense, are really People.  We are all quite diverse in our mentalities and personalities, but we all deserve respect until proven otherwise (I don't hate him because he's another skin-tone.  I hate him because he's an asshole!).  This play has alerted me to an interesting thought (trashcan revelation) that people are diverse and interesting (each cat could have had an entire play written about its life).  One can assume things about people by looking at them (rum tum tugger comes to mind), but, love them or hate them, you can only really love or hate the characters when they explain themselves to you!  Check out the last song to see what I'm saying. 

Listen carefully and you'll see that Andrew Lloyd Weber's play actually has some interesting philosophical thoughts.  Keep on thikning, kiddies!"

"event","Well, I've been working on a story for a science fiction honors class that I took last semester, and I have yet to turn in my story... hehe, I will do it by the end of summer, but I do find it funny that he took my (excruciatingy) rough draft and graded it (noticeably only about 1/4 the story...), still giving it a B which meant an A for the course.  Anyway, I thought that to get the creative juices flowing, I'd post some things here relating to it to spur on my desire to finish it.

Here's the website with the world description:
http://hilltop.bradley.edu/~rcc/sheehans.htm

I also have a rather jagged but workable outline.  As silly as this sounds, I liked the world I made, and it has become a vehicle for explaining my thoughts as of late.  Perhaps I will eventually get this finished and be happy enough to try and publish (or not).  Read the world description first or else you'll be quite lost.

-Discontent (?) - this is a little shady even now
IV. Book III - Relative
-Old Man's Love (the young lady)

Proposed Conflict throughout the story:
Religion: Faith Vs. Truth
Leaders: Law Vs. Truth
Businessmen: Pleasure and Money Vs. Truth
Poets: Bastardization of Concepts, Verse Vs. Truth
Science: Close Mindedness/Lack of desire to Teach
Nihilism: Belief Vs. Truth
Guards: The Death of Curiosity

I still need to mix in some conflicts (methinks that a mock trial will make for an interesting Guide conflict) but I like where the story is going.  Even if I royally f*ck up on the philosophy aspect of it all (which I may, we'll see), it should make for a good tale.

"event","Well, for my own amusement, I got around to trying to think in the vein of Rationalists (egged on by a section in Sophie's World describing the great differences of opinion between Parminedes and Hericlitus).

First, Rationalists (to my understanding) are people who believe that the rationalizations of the mind are what is real and that perception has a nasty tendancy to give misinformation.  I used this as my basis for a fundamental thought experiment that had a funny outcome in, oh, 6 easy steps or so.

Here goes, kiddies (thought up while waiting in line at Taco Bell after a good day's work):

First thought:  I think, therefore I am.  
The most basic of principles, if I am capable of pondering my existence, I exist in some way/shape/form.  It is interesting to note that this appears to be where the concept of respect for the 'other' comes from;  Our only way of judging that which is 'real' in this world is that it is capable of thought (We are, we exist).  Since 'others' are capable of thought as well, they should be respected for that ability and their existence.

Second Thought:  The World around us is Real
Well, I know I'm usually a proponent of us all being tied in a machine somewhere running computer programs in our sleep, but rationally, this one makes sense.  According to our sense data (relying on perception...), our world  has existed and will continue to exist independent of us, in other words, it is consistently real.  Admittedly, this could be a delusion, but for all intensive purposes, if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's reality, folks.  (Take that, solipism!)

Third Thought:  The World around us is bound by rules
It's not hard, folks.  Our world is one of grand cause and effect.  If we do something, there is invariably a rule behind it governing what effect it will have.  Science is us trying to figure out these rules.  It is, as I am wont to say, very much like a game.

Fourth Thought:  God is claimed to be the Cause of the World
Now, here the trainwreck arrives, my friends...  Either we've made a mistake beforehand (Our second thought is incorrect in assuming this world is real or our third thought is erred in that we think that all things have a governing cause) or God cannot be the end all be all as claimed by so many... Interestingly enough, many have asked the question of where God came from, and it is amusing to envision God willing himself into existence... But the problem still stands;  The very notion of God as root cause (nothing above him) appears erroneous.  However, an interesting dillemma of equal proportion arises in asking where the laws governing the universe that we know of (namely physics, mathematics, chemistry, biology, etc.) came from, what their cause was.  

All in all, that's about as far as I got before my food arrived.  It was very tasty.  Surprisingly fun time, trying to think from someone else's perspective.  

Anyway, That aside, I've got another thing a' coming, but that'll be for the next post, scheduled to happen... now."

"event","Well, this is probably long overdue, and hopefully that will be reflected in the breadth of thought and the crazed ravings of ideas that I present.

First, I've got a bit of a writing to present: 

I got to talking with Chris earlier today, and something that he mentioned really sank in to me deeply...  We began arguing at some point about living 'the correct life' and the desire to find such a thing.  After mentioning that I would like to live the correct life whether it be in service to some greater goal or if it was to pursuing happiness and fostering happiness in others, and to this he laughed.  As much as we talked about being 'thick skinned', this response tore at my thoughts;  He explained that he would not care if such a life existed, he would simply live his life that he never asked for and accept whatever consequences he earned.  Somehow, this blatant lack of will to find the Truth stupefied me...  However, his observation that religion was the thing that incited this feeling of longing, of need for some spiritual answers (which I admit that I am having trouble with right now) forced me to think.  What if it is so?  What if I do not need such spiritual answers and in fact could be quite happy accepting whatever fate I earned but not bowing to humility of self, being free to do as I felt and being happy doing so.  Interesting thought, that...  Still, I can only see his view as a certain apathy, that he has gotten to the point of not caring one way or another, simply tired in his pursuit of the Truth.  The question needs to be asked, though, of why I need to seek out such Truth...  Why I find it to be the most important search that I have forced myself to undertake.  My only real response (which I likely failed to properly communicate) was that if I knew there was some conscious force guiding the universe, I would like to sing my praise of it, thanking it for my existence.  This trip really has been very nice, though I have the absurd tendancy to abuse it.  If I knew the moral boundaries of such a conscience, (I could only assume that free will exists) I would choose to live by them and teach them to others, so that I might be able to please this God(s).  Why would I live a 'cookie cutter existence'?  I would like to show my appreciation, my love of this entity, if it does exist, and I would do so by shirking the easy path of fulfilling my desires to instead repress and model myself so that I may sacrifice for the betterment of others or an end goal.  I really wonder if God(s) would care if you got your beliefs wrong, so long as you restrained yourself for the purpose of showing that you're willing to sacrifice of yourself for it...  maybe intention does count.  

Rather interesting thoughts those, I thought.  As a bit of spite, perhaps, and perhaps trying to explain my rambling to myself, I wrote out a simple story, (not finished, by any means) which went like this: 

A cookie-cutter existence and the Third House on the Left
Mark Sheehan

I had been searching for him so long that it seemed almost unreal when I had finally found him.  I now stood outside of a modest hovel on the outskirts of town, eyeing the quaint well-kept bushes that ensnared the simple brick structure.  The windows were smudged and dirty and I could not see anything inside, but I could tell this was where he lived.  Holding back my elation and swallowing my pride, I pushed the tiny ornamental gate open and followed the welcoming path up to the front door.  The gate creaked as I passed, slipping into its past position, and I admired the breadth and beauty of the garden that overwhelmed the front yard.  I was getting lost in gardenias, remniscing in the roses, and before I knew it, had made it up the wooden stairs onto the porch, standing squarely in front of the door.  With an audible gulp, I pushed the doorbell, hearing a quaint chime emenating from the other side of the door.  I heard footsteps and my heart jumped.  I had waited for this moment for so long, and I cradled my surprise in the pocket of my jacket.  I thought it funny that this man had deserved this, all these years, and here I was, ready to give it to him.  A creaking of the handle almost made me jump;  I was so nervous that sweat was beading upon my brow.  My breathing was irregular and heavy, and as the door creaked open, I pulled the object out of my coat pocket, hiding it behind my back.  ""Hello,"" I began, spying the wrinkled eyes that I remembere so well hiding behind thick spectacles.  ""I''ve been looking for you for many long years now,"" my eyes flaring and coming to bright life as my excitement overtook me, ""and here you are.  I'm sure you know why I'm here... I'm hoping to repay you for what you did to me fifteen years ago.""  A sly smile creeped across my lips.  With the completion of this statement, I pulled the object from behind me quickly, noting a startled look on the old man's face, his mouth suddenly agape.  ""Here you go!""  

He outstretched his frail arm, taking the trinket from me.  It was nothing more than a simple bauble, really, merely a jewel encrusted broach whose monetary value was nonexistant, but the man smiled upon recieving it,  knowing full well its true value;  his eyes welled up with tears, and I mused that it was not unlike looking into two overflowing fishbowls when peering into his eyes.  The broach, as he knew, had belonged to my mother and was the last thing that I had to remember her by.  ""I wanted to thank you for saving my life earlier.  Without your help, I surely would have died.  I never asked to be saved and in fact had not wanted to be, yet you still did.  I cannot say that this life that was given to me has always been pleasant, but I can tell you that it has been quite the experience. After you saved me, I had to think about why you had done so... certainly you had gained nothing as a result, but instead gave of yourself to help me.  I concluded that this could only have been a genuine act of love, to give me back my life.  I wanted to let you know that I have been helping others as you have helped me, I am that thankful for your intervention.  I wanted you to know how much love I have shown humanity because of the love you have shown me.  I will continue to devote myself to helping others with their predicaments, helping save them from their own problems, but I primarily wanted to simply say 'thank you'.""  With this, he reached forward and hugged me, a warm embrace that I have never felt before or since, rubbing his watered cheeks into my jacket.  I smiled and he, looking up, returned it.  His embrace loosened, and I waved a silent goodbye to his joyful form.  I turned and walked away, ready to continue in my servitude of this grand love that this man had shown me. 

I was truly happy as I walked away, spying another person wandering the street carefully examining the housenumbers, an excited expression on his face, his right hand shielding some treasure.  I looked at him and smiled, saying simply, ""Third house on the left.""


**I know this is a little 'catholic' or 'christian' for some, but it really can help explain why one would devote themselves to something beyond their grasp, like, say, a religion or worship of a diety, choosing to live a restrained lifestyle as a means of respect and thanks to someone/thing/whatever.

That aside, Pat and I finished Chobits yesterday, and here is a rundown of what I thought of the last few eps (sorry to Andrew for him having to live through this rant rather than merely reading it):

Solreaper910: btw, finished chobits yesteraday (with pat... I was a busy bee)
RagingPantsKing: hehe
RagingPantsKing: what did you think of it?
Solreaper910: rather interesting, that series... somehow I think I had a much different interpretation of the ending than pat did
RagingPantsKing: you don't get much more shounen than that show, imo
Solreaper910: but to me, it's rather obvious
Solreaper910: oh, heck, I didn't care about that too much...
Solreaper910: although some of those dresses were rather short on the front end...
RagingPantsKing: true, true
Solreaper910: I did, however, find it to help explain the concept of the other, but I had a problem with it...
Solreaper910: people continued to fall in love with another entity, one with which they shared memories, but people kept falling in love with things that technically weren't human and, since programmed, were likely didn't have any amount of free thought of their own
Solreaper910: (in my own little mind, that last program of chi's was something that rewrote their programming to allow for them to freely love/do as they wished, to become full 'other' entities, human if you will.
Solreaper910: capable of doing things of their own volition (like loving because they want to)
Solreaper910: not because programmed to do so
Solreaper910: but that whole falling in love with programming rather annoyed me...
RagingPantsKing: yeah, I never really enjoyed the thought that people loved the persacons rather than people
Solreaper910: agreed, the persocoms were another entity, but were they an entity with anything along the lines of free will?  could they love you back because they wanted to, or simply because they were programmed to do so (to make you happy)
Solreaper910: I am reminded of the bakery guy's persocom
Solreaper910: she actually did something out of love for him... that was interesting...
Solreaper910: she was willing to save him and instead sacrifice herself for him... to me, an act of love...
Solreaper910: which she did freely, something that I don't think could be programmed.
Solreaper910: perhaps in that instant, you see the beginnings of the notion of the persocoms as full 'other's...
Solreaper910: I don't quite remember how pat interpreted it, but I remember that he got something a bit different out of it, like chii never completed that program
Solreaper910: (I think she definitely did)
Solreaper910: so, I'm left pondering what constitutes humanity at the end of it...
Solreaper910: *whew, rant done*
RagingPantsKing: hehe
Solreaper910: a fun show, imho, and strangely thought provoking 

Note to Chris; you really took the brunt of what pretty much happened with me rambling/thinking, so thank you for the good hour/hour and a half of conversing

That aside, I was also reading into the idea of curiosity when I came across the article at http://www.leaderu.com/marshill/mhr03/curio1.html, and to that, I had to think ""hey, if I only opened up a little more and spoke honestly with others and myself, I might just be able to develop quite well.""  The comment Chris made about me using big words in completely unnecessary situations comes to mind.  I'm really going to try and take these things into account.  (I really do wonder if I'm a textbook masochist sometimes...)

The other thing that piqued my interest lately was a passage by Lewis Carroll in Sylvie and Bruno saying ""I think it is love, I feel it is love, therefore I know it is love.""  This was Carroll's favourite passage, and I think I understand why;  in 3 lines, he has described humanities' limitations in their entirity.  We are only capable of knowing anything based on the logic behind it that we understand or the feelings we have towards something.  Now, I have a bit of a problem with each, primarily because no-one has found any objective perspectives yet, thus negating the Knowing part of things like, say, metaphysics or even the certainty of the absoluteness of our world (there's a matrix reference in here somewhere).  Equally, feeling cannot always be trusted (ask your resident OCD patient or anyone with Schizophrenia), so claiming it is an absolute determinant of Truth is just silly.  After nicely knocking both legs out from under us all, I'm left confused (as always) and wondering.  I'm wanting to hear ideas about if this reasoning is correct (if there are only those 2 methods and if their negation makes sense).  

I'm quite dried for the moment, but I will leave you with some definitions (and for you, Chris, Good Job, keep up the good work, etc. :D) [I define things so that others might understand to what I reference by my speech and so that I can understand their context]  I will attempt to use other phrases aside from 'Define it please', but I'm afraid I won't ever stop trying to understand others.  Stupid curiosity.

Love: willingness to sacrifice of self for the assumed benefit of self/another/some organization/endgoal

Faith: Taking belief as Truth regardless of substantiation

Truth: The objective outlook on the universe, how things really are outside of our minds (Either God exists or does not, etc. unless I've really fucked up my notion of what truth is).

Well, kiddies, keep on looking, get your heads out of your asses, it's a bright new day for all us lads and lasses, We might find our dreams, we might find our fear, we might find them far, or we might find them near, While it might be nothing more than a jagged little pill, we'll keep on looking until we find it, we will.

Peace out."

"event","Well, I've resigned to myself to actually list online (for the express purpose of not forgetting anytime in the near future until all of humanity is destroyed or the internet decides to become a supreme being) what I believe.  Perhaps, you can consider this an insight into my soul, or perhaps a reflection of hypocrisy, whatever you want:  but against all noddings of OCD I have, here are my basic beliefs, and why I hold them.  Enjoy, masses, and understand, friends.

Quoted from my Economics Course notebook (What can I say, I got intorspective and bored):

What do I believe?

Good/Evil:  Can be defined relative tto those outside myself; Good, helping people; Bad, hurting others.

Religion: Very confused; Beliefs are Equally unfounded, I still fear death (socrates can't help- catholicism paints 'hell', an option he didn't even consider).  Want to help people; Life feels unsatisfied without [helping other people]; Apathism viewpoint, admittedly, though, I don't know.  Apathism:  The belief that absolute goods exists, defining ones own good/evil, not caring if God exists, seeking to find [meaning of] good/evil and do good.  Not believing because of fear [of death, damnation, etc.]

People: Inherently good, [this belief] leads to a naivatee on my part.  Everyone has problems, I can help a little.  People often form their own beliefs and stick to them religiously.  They don't even know nore care if they are right (I could just be a bit pessimistic here)

Politics: What a farce.  Someone has to do it, the running of a country, but people are swayed by people who aren't necessarily the better option;  politics is about decieving and pursuading, veru usually not by legitimate means.

Self: Be true to it.  You alone define who you are and what you think of yourself:  Others may not understand, but you must not stray for them;  To be a tortured soul alone is better than making a joke of yourself;  One day, you may find another like you and you can rest in the knowledge that you would not compromise yourself.

Goals: Self-actualization [good luck, buddy...], Accumulation and refinement of knowledge, making some differences in the world for the better.

Wisdom: Subjective. can be found everywhere, shaped and interpreted by life and knowledge.  Necessity for a basis of beliefs.

Friends: [Left blank, but I'm going to paraphrase myself]  The friends you make are the best things in this world you will ever have:  They are the ones who will support you when you're at your worst, who will share the burden of life with you always, and will still lend you their ear for your stories or their shoulder for your worries.  They are the people who will help you shape your reality, helping work it with you, helping you understand more about the world and yourself than you alone could ever hope for.  They'll be there, they will, but they'll do something infinitely more profound;  Becase of your association, you will help shape their worlds, and they will help you question yours, leading to a clearer understanding of just about everything.  Friends are more valuable than gold, more precious than silver, and those who possess even a few really close ones are richer than any man with money alone.  

Those are my beliefs, friends, and I hope you realize how much I value you all.    Thank you, and keep up the questioning, and keep on smacking me over the head with ideas and thoughts, and if you ever see the gears stop turning, just give me a playful jostle, and make me think again.  Thank you so very much."

"event","pat (nekoshonen) and I just finished watching Haibane Ranmei, a wonderful anime focusing on redemption and forgiveness (and, yeah, there's much more to that, but I'm lost in thought about other things...)

Anyway, I actually empathized with a character who was always donning a happy smile for the masses, yet hiding pain and sorrow underneath her exterior.  She had black wings (and was thus called sin-bound) and, well, I won't spoil the end.  Long story short, I feel like that sometimes, as I'm sure we all do, but I feel especially strong now that chris (brona) has forced me to start thinking about morals and right and wrong...

I'll let a convo with pat shortly after watching help guide my thoughts...

Solreaper910: I wonder...
S V  Calculus: You wonder.
Solreaper910: I feel really good right now... wholly neutral... Solreaper910: chris, during these past few weeks, I have begun to understand what you meant when you said that the question was the most beatiful thing, not the answer.
Solreaper910: To an extent, I understand that.
Auto response from RLGLDBorYSGOS: around

Solreaper910: The questions we ask are reflections of ourselves and how we view the world...
Solreaper910: the answer to anything is not relevant, as you may think anyway about anything...
Solreaper910: however, understanding why one attained that answer proves to be the defining point of ourselves...
Solreaper910: we define ourselves not on how we answer, but by the questions we ask and the observations we make...
Solreaper910: in questioning our answers, we find ourselves.
Solreaper910: the question is an entity unto itself, not right, not wrong, devoid of any sense of either...
Solreaper910: and in asking, one begins to understand onesself.
Solreaper910: that, chris, is beautiful.
Solreaper910: and that's what I sent to chris.
Solreaper910: somehow, it feels right...
S V  Calculus: Well, yes.
Solreaper910: regardless of if there's a god or not, I'm living my life to help humanity and better understand myself...
Solreaper910: So, I'm wondering if it matters to me if there is a god or not...
Solreaper910: if I should be afraid all the time of 'good' or 'evil', 
S V  Calculus: Deistic apathy?
Solreaper910: the question arises of why do I care...
Solreaper910: the answer is because I'm afraid...
Solreaper910: yet, I would act the same irreguardless
Solreaper910: regardless... whatever.
S V  Calculus: Or, generally, curiosity is part of human nature.
Solreaper910: I like to think that is true...
Solreaper910: however, curiosity is a pointless circle if there can be no real answer.
Solreaper910: I'm asking whether there is or isn't a god.
Solreaper910: But I'm really asking if it matters.
Solreaper910: would I live any differently?
S V  Calculus: With some religions, not caring about said god means you'll spend eternity in a world of hurt.  :D
Solreaper910: would I still regard human life?
S V  Calculus: Meh.
Solreaper910: would I still be me?
Solreaper910: I like to think the answer to these questions is 'yes'.
Solreaper910: I don't know if there's a god out there.
Solreaper910: I'm living my life for others.
Solreaper910: I'll be good to my own definition
Solreaper910: helping others and causing the least damage as possible.
S V  Calculus: Yes, though as we just learned, knowing when to seek help of others is also a good quality to have.
Solreaper910: that much is very true...
Solreaper910: however, as I've well learned, you cannot force a person to ask for help.
S V  Calculus: True...
Solreaper910: that is their own battle...
Solreaper910: I can only help afterward.
Solreaper910: I don't know if this is a revelation or a reaffirmation...

To summarize (in case anyone missed the relevance of all that):
I was raised in a christian home.  I was sent to a catholic school.  I was taught much about how to live and pray and worship, and what values exist in the world.  My parents were wealthy.  I live quite nice.  I really haven't been forced to face much in this world. There is much for me to learn.
So, I wonder if god exists or not, and if that really matters... I wonder if everything that I learned way back when, getting golden stars for, was just indoctrination, as I now think most of it a shadow of thought.  I wonder why I haven't thought too much (and still fail to do so, on most occasions) and if religion is true and I should be fearing for myself.  All of these questions, I've been wondering.  I'm slowly finding my answers."

"event","Well, a few interesting things of note have happened in the past few days of my life:  First, I went with Chris Ashbaker to see the Peoria Civic Center's Boo!, a performance by the Peoria Symphony Orchestra with hauntingly fun music.  I rather liked the theme from the Batman movies and the typical Danse Macabre, but there was an added twist in this performance, one that cost friend composer a standing ovation.  An off-beat oratory, a simple reading of dark children's poetry set to great thematic music with constant playing of toy instruments;  I couldn't keep a straight face, thinking that the PSO and a respected opera singer were performing this piece...  I rank it about 4 on a 10 scale;  I'll try it once to said I've tried it, but it was so different and discordant that I could nearly stand it!!!  I like the music of progressive composers like Aaron Copland and Philip Glass, but this was out of even MY league, and that says something.  On a much more positive note, the child's book it was read from was HILARIOUS!  Overall, though, a great performance, one that I thoroughly enjoyed.

Anyway, that was all saturday.  When I got back and dropped chris off, James and Erich (and donovan) all asked me to join them in a good game of Paranoia.  For those not in the know, Imagine 1984; except instead of a government, the world is run by a computer.  This game lets you die 6 times, leading to high fatality rates and excessive backstabbing, and, BOY, do you have to watch what you say! Anyway, I asked chris, and he politely declined (try it sometime, chris, it's so much fun!) and so I went to play.  I stayed unti 4 a.m. and generally enjoyed myself, but ended up being an ass because I had it out for James (btw: James will kill you if he can, but he'll do it only if he has good reason; Erich will kill you if you get in his way, but usually, he won't let you screw with his plans.  Thus, James is the most dangerous, not only because of his mentality, but because he is quick-witted and VERY good at role-playing his characters, especially in this horrible distopian mess... Gosh he scares me sometimes) and trying to kill people for no reason tends to, well, get you killed.  4 times in fact.  Good news: I have yellow clearance now, and erich has orange and james, red.  I doubt I'll survive long enough to enjoy it.  Still, the fun of the game is had in the deaths (gotta love catch-22 sitches!).  

So, I guess I'm doing fine, wanting to play more paranoia, and am enjoying myself (gotta watch being an ass, though... it stinks)

"event","Well, it was bound to happen, but BOY, do I HATE it when I lose at diplomacy.  For those of you not in the know, diplomacy is a simple game that forces you to trust other people and be ambitious (and backstab) other people in order to take over half of Europe.  Well, today the mighty Austro-Hungarians have fallen... I really hate it that I play this game with people I would normally trust (Fraternity brothers), and it really hurts being betrayed by any of them...  I of course forsee some of this happening (I try to, at least) but a few unorthodox things happened this game to screw me royally.  In the beginning, I wasn't in control of A-H, and lost some ground at the start there.  Next, my friend, Robert Schiach, thought that the game had gone on too long and defferred his moves to Jesse Smith, my arch-rival in this game.  (it should be noted: He was Italy, so, providing you know your 1914 era geometry, is RIGHT NEXT TO A-H!  That sucked.  The fact that Rob's 4 fsking armies (that's a LOT, btw, doubling Jesse's Military) ALL attacked me.  I can deal, I guess, especially if I could survive until they disbanded (jesse gave up all robs bases so he could take 'em).  Well, thanks to 2 turns of skullfucking like you wouldn't believe from ALL 3 NEIGHBORS (4 counting Rob), I was utterly obliterated.  I don't mind the whole losing thing so much as the thought that, firstly, jesse got those armies, which I think is just not right, and that EVERYBODY turned against me towards the end... I could have at least remained a puppet piece (and thus possibly survived the game), but now I'm out... I can rest assured, though, that the gains for the parties involved in the 3 way A-H orgy will all lose, seeing as how Capo (the only experienced player) controls about 15 of the 18 areas he needs to win, and even the 3 remaining players, providing they work together, Capo will still beat them all.  Oh well, it's a stupid game, but WHEW, does it stir the brain and emotions... Not to mention, it does provoke backstabbing and quesitoning of loyalty... Great brotherhood building activity, I tell you... But, as fuming angry as I am right now, I'll still jump in as Baron Von BisMark in a pinch, just because I love diplomacy.

These are my thoughts, and I'm sticking to 'em."

This person has, rant after rant, made me laugh, cry, sympathize, empathize, and generally feel good about myself.  I know that I rarely post, and that when I do, I act the dour sourpuss.  I'm sorry to drag you all down sometimes, but it should be known that I generally post only when I'm feeling bad or something exceptionally good happens... Sorry, guys, but my life is just mundane except for the special, notable moments.  Ah well, I'm gonna continue to post whenever I get the nerve, but until then, keep pulling.

"event","Well, I just saw donnie darko, which, for any who haven't seen it (and apparently there are very few of you out there...), it was a great movie!  Let's look at the recap.  Schizophrenic teenager is persuaded by evil looking bunny, told that the world will end, burns down a house, kills another teenager without a thought (stupid frank...), and eventually decides to take one for reality.  Wow... I really like those mentally troubled movies out there, and I especially have a penchant for fate and time... this one hit the spot, though I know I will have to watch it again in order to get it.

anyway, I'm in a rather happy mood (though that is likely to change at some point, but hey, what can I do about that? :D)  and, honestly, Chris, I completely forgot that you went to Bradley too... sorry buddy, call me sometime at 840-0043 (YES, I ANSWER THIS!!!)

stupid society and preconcieved notions of being 'correct'.  

I was just thinking to myself how those porno mangas are an artform unto themselves: someone took the time to concieve and draw these, and, on a wonderful, rare, occasion, added plot!  For those who were wondering, yes, I do read these, and, yes, I love sappy romantic plots.  I'm not talking the borderline stupid dialog like, ""Yes, deeper, harder, lick my *bleep for the kiddies*, suck my *bleep* kinda crap... I'm talking about the GOOD stories like the tale of GATT (which, to my knowledge, has no conclusion... I'm unhappy at that...) or the Alice in sexland story.  These have, in my opinion, quality plots with interspersed, perhaps even unnecessary, nudity and sex, but most is handled in a tasteful way.  Look up Slut Girl sometime and examine the characters sometime.  You'll be surprised in a pleasant way.  Simply put, if you can wade through the mindless crap out there, you might find a story you like or characters you can identify with... I happen to favor the self-actualized (if horny) women portrayed in the likes of Secret Plot and Slut Girl. 

Yes, I've figured out that the world doesn't work like those stories, especially the rampant reverting to animalistic behavior on a whim thing... silly Japanese... still don't get women =3

Is it scary to think that for all of us guys not getting any, that there is an equally sexually challenged japanese guy learning to draw to ease that purpose?

Anyway, people, have a good one, be who you be, and don't take crap from anyone who puts you down...

"event","Well, if anyone is rampantly interested, I was thinking earlier today... 

My life is in a relative slump, and I have fallen with it.  Right now, I am in college.  This seems to be the first problem.  I love the thought that I am in a fraternity with people whom I am happy to fraternize with, but I still seem to be lacking something fulfilling in my life... Perhaps bry was right when he told me (in reference to online games), ""you only get out of it what you put in.""  I seriously am pondering if this applies to life as well, and my only answer is yes.  I seek not to rampantly disavow the friends I know and love, but I was just watching an episode of Lain (in english... yech.), and I watched the opening.  I had to think, why, WHY can't I just be like that, so secluded in my own life, transcending this world?  I then wondered how it would feel to jump from the highest building, with noone to catch me, yet not fearing the end, knowing that I could stop myself whenever I please.  I would love that.  I used to think I could do anything, that I was a superman, but now even my intelligence has come under fire;  I can't seem to study or figure out anything put in front of me anymore! reading has become a chore.  I love to find things out, but I don't even have the patience or persistence to hope to learn, let alone do anything productive.  For any out there who didn't know this, I am horribly obsessive compulsive, and this is making my time in Bradley nigh impossible. I also haven't decided upon a major;  I don't want to limit myself to business (too simplistic, even though interesting,) but I can't hope, with my reading problems and OC realities, to ever hit the Mechanical Engineering pinnacle of my life. to put it bluntly, My life sucks for the moment, though I seem happy.  I really need to work things out, as I am easily overwhelmed.  

I'll work on my problems, you work on yours.  Good luck, to you and me both, brother.

                                                                            M.S."

"event","I sit here listening to 'Clocks', a vain thought upon my mind.  I love all of my friends, but rising tensions and various tempers kindled by senseless pondering have led to many disputes, each more severe than the last.  I have been a' meddlin', and I know it.  Pat, a friend of mine, may not be my friend much longer.  Somehow, I know that he will read this and likely respond, though, with hatred or understanding I do not know.  Pat has been ridiculed as of late by myself and a few of my friends, and we claim to be poking fun in his general direction because of his choice of hair color, clothing, and rather isolated lifestyle.  He ends up taking it seriously.  I, for one, know the pain of being taunted, even in jest, so I do know what he is going through.  It can be a harsh business being mocked and suspecting your friends of everything.  The unfortunate downside of this is that Pat has outright reverted to an infantile/cynical state (and, yes, I know the meaning of cynical.  I'm using the 3rd definition from www.dictionary.com).  I, quite frankly, am getting sick of the 'I won't play any more because I have no chance of winning' or the constant 'Woe is me, I haven't found anyone to goto the mall with, so I'll get bitchy about it,' and I'm not the only one to think that.  I here offer some advice to all parties involved:

Friends (not pat): Leave Pat alone, he doesn't need to be insulted, even in jest.  Realize that he doesn't think it's a joke and remember how much it hurts to be humiliated even around friends.  We needn't insult him, so lets just stop.  Also, when doing stuff w/ friends, try and remember Pat and his thoughts.

Pat: Two words.  Grow up.  If you lose a game, don't get pissy.  If something isn't fun, Don't do it.  If other people can't make time just for you whenever you feel the need to do something, don't feel that they hate you.  The world does not revolve around you.  

Me:  Ah, myself.  What can I do, you may ask?  Well, I know for one that I need to psychoanalyze less (One day, I will have a degree, then I can do it).  I also need to stop lecturing (don't count this), and try getting along better.  

Pat, you're cool, you really are.  I want to see things work out, but that hinges a lot on everyone making some major changes.

There it is in wonderful plaintext, my mind spoken.  If you, the reader, want to bash, feel free.  Get defensive, feel free.  If you want to send me webcomics, by all means feel free.

Fraternity life is going well,
school is, well, school, though I push the gpa envelope with a steady 2.5

I DID, however, get someting from all this: I do not need to fear death.  I can run from it ONLY by choosing wisely when it comes to activities and food, general lifestyle (no thuggin, guys) etc; when you face death, though, you need not panic.  If you die, it is simply meant to be.  Our futures are out there, if in probability alone, and yet we will follow a single path towards the future no matter, our choices already made.  If I am to die right now, so be it. I won't struggle, or deny it, or haggle, I'm simply dead.  I do not fear death now, and think it all for the better.

I am not looking forward to any amount of school, and quite frankly, I have looked forward to the end of the week for some peace and solice.  I'm also going to see about having donovan and andrew over here in the next few days to help clean the basement, the ever scary job *insert creepy howl noise*.  I feel pretty lame right now, as I am not used to having my glasses on yet.  that and I suspect the septic system outside my window is letting in noxious gasses *gets high just thinking about it*.

In the dark and rustic night, atop a building made of stone,
The wanderers keep vigil sight, and there they wait, all so alone.
Each one watching, waiting, so, and when their time comes, they will go.
Till that hour, they will await, gargoylesque, they grasp their fate,
and if the world calls out its cry, they will descend, and then they'll die,
they know not what they're meant to do, but still they wait: 
                                                             how about you?

Yesterday, I went out with the fraternity (Phi Gamma Delta for you who do not know) and we had the ceremonial pig dinner. This is a gathering of undergrads and grads at alexanders bar and grill to get up on the fraternity buisness.  (Pat- there were NO sacrificial virgins there, so don't even mention it.) We grilled our own steaks (20 dollars per meal and we cooked our own food?) and sat and drank (heavily- pepsi for me) and discussed stuff.  It was pretty boring from there.  Afterwards, we went to Ol' Chiccago on the river bank, and proceeded to drink even more (water for me this time).  The grads (and undergrads, who I mention are mostly under age) drank 110 (!) beers from around the world.  After that, some people were readily sloshed and we decided to go to the off campus for *gasp* more drinking! I decided I'd had enough (The steak I undercooked and pizza from ol chicago caught up to me) and I decided to get a game of 'drunken monopoly' going.  Joel joined myself, kessler, and one of kessler's friends (I like this girl- funny, and she gets drunk off of water!!! She sure acts that way at least- she had to be walked home after drinking tapwater at a party...) And I ended up winning after a very stupid 1 hour tally up your assets with houses worh 1/2 and prop worth mortgage value (Poor Joel! 3 rr's and each mortgages for less that 1/4 it's price).  After that, I decided to go home and hit the hay.  It sure was quite the day, and aside from me figuring out at 1:00 that I had missed an online chem quiz posted from 7-7 the morning before, I had a pretty fun day.  Note: I just sat and drew stuff at ol' chicago, so you guys may want to view it sometime.

This is supposed to be a challenge, so here I go.  

With a spoon: gag yourself on the spoon as you hurl your body into oncoming traffic off a bridge in the northeastern side of pittsburg, and if you survive the fall, some guy will come over and shoot you and take the spoon.  Death done.

with a piece of string: This one was fun.  There is the conventional, like strangling yourself, but I would put it over a giant stairwell and *intentionally* trip on it and fall to my painful death. d^2

And lastly, a can of raid.  I know what you are thinking... it explodes, right?
well, take that idea and KICK IT UP A NOTCH (tm) you shove that can right into your mouth, and punch a hole through the bottom.  Now, like the good kids you are, you take a flame and put it near the hole.  One of two things is going to happen. 1. the can will jet straight through your skull, making for an interesting demise, OR 2 the thing blows your skull to itty bitty pieces.  Either way, you are going out in style.

That was this edition of deathstyles of the rich and infamous, (excluding all the drug overdoses... damn things) and gimme a line; you hate this, you love this, etc.  Oh, and mechanical engineering will be the death of me. It is the best suicide one could hope for   GNIGHT!"

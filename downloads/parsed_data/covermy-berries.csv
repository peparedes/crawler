"event","It's been a pretty long time. lots of things have happened but it doesn't seem that anything is worthy enough to be mentioned.

so this year is the first year that i got everything i wanted. it was very exciting.

i even got some things that i wasn't expecting to get =) 

it is really sad that christmas is over though. but i'm really glad it came.i felt very much like i needed it. some things weren't the same though. i guess that can be expected.

sometimes i manage to get myself down but then at the oddest times i get the feeling that everything's going to be alright. and i guess maybe that's worth it. but i'm not too sure. 

i don't know. i think i'm just some silly kid.
but i'm not sure you would want to laugh at me because for some people who laugh, they'll be gunned and knifed and for others =) well they'll just have to wait.

and then of course there are the people that think i'm invisible. they're the ones who will be cut? 

but oh man, my legs and my shoulders hurt so bad today. grrrrr. that could be fixed =)



that's all i guess. maybe this was pointless. i don't know. maybe
i'm out. bye"

"event","my goodness, i haven't updated in such a long time. i would say that i feel bad. but i really don't

lots has happened. mostly happy stuff

i'm kinda sad the play is over because i really don't know what i'm going to do after school since the play is over.

i guess a safe bet is to say that i'm probably going to go home.

Halloween was probably the best halloween i've ever had. although erin's party last year was pretty good. that was one comfy recliner.

Thanksgiving was a really good one this year. i'm very excited that i didn't get yelled at. because i usually do. 

i really can't wait until Christmas. we already have our tree up. how crazy is that?

i'm also looking forward to Sunday, and i'm having my family guy party tomorrow. it should be fun.i'm excited

so erin, i've got a little bus.

and it goes like this...


that's pretty much it

bye"

"event","i loved my weekend. except for this morning when i cried.

since i did lots of smelling over the weekend. i have to ask 


What's your favorite all time smell??



mine is when someone goes outside when its cold and the way they smell when they come in. i also have another one. but thats none of your business.

so mom and kaylie decorated for halloween this morning and speaking of halloween, i dont know when im having my bash. it seems like that weekend is full. and it sucks because halloween is on sunday so... idk

this saturday is Sweetest Day. Seiously if there's anyone you want to thank or just let them know you appreciate them, or if theyve been having a bad time. SATURDAY IS THE TIME TO DO IT. im really serious about this. this is really the first time ive heard about it myself and i thinks its a cute little holiday.

so friday i had chelsea over and we just hung out and watched tv and the potterpuppetpals. then saturday was a kinda messed up night at the game. then sunday was my favorite day. except for the gay dancing in the morning. it was really really great. but then i freaked myself out this morning and it wasnt cool. so yea

strings tomorrow. i have a feeling im gonna bone it. and im sscared that the younger kids will whoop my ass because i havent picked up the violin since may. so yea. and i wont be home till about 8 thats gonna bone. 

and i rock the apache indian socks. im actually kind of proud of my report. it flows for the most part. and i think its alright for what it is. 

well w/e im out 
let me know about the smell thingy.


p.s. ive got this part of the song in my head and it sucks so yea im gonna write it out and maybe itll go away. i mean its not like its bad or anything its just there
so ...

i've gotta be honest, i've been waiting for you all my life. 

tada
love y'all

i'm still very upset and worried about this whole uncle david moving thing. and i feel selfish that i have to be reassured that everything happens for a reason and that it will all be ok. 

i should really start trying to believe that. 

this weekend should be happenin. can't wait.

im tired. tomorrow is gonna be such a teaser. only because its thursday...

then friday!!!!!! partay!!!!!!

ok question of the day...
i got 7 nuts
how many do you get? 

or because no one really answered except for that hooty girl chelsea.

seriously what do you think of me?? 


i love you all. seriously.

"event","ok so yesterday sucked really big balls. i'm not even going to elaborate. but today was fun i guess. 

if i had to break it down it would go like this... 

friday= great
saturday= bad balls 
sunday= alright/pretty good

i got to wear man pants!! and my god they are sooooooo comfy. i was all pimpin in these mothers. 

band tomorrow = most likely balls. 
then i have piano. i havent practiced at all for like 2 weeks. grr she's not gonna be happy. and then i'll feel really bad. 

1. she's old 
2. my mom is like paying for me to sight read every week.


after 2 months, my uncle david is leaving to move back to virginia. i'm going to cry. i love him more than anything and he's always someone i can go to. im going to miss the tubs, and all those little sunday trips. im gonna miss the late night talks on the front porch. im going to miss the laughs. grr im going to be a mess. 
i was so looking forward to christmas. it would've been the first that he'd be here for. i made him a shit load of ornaments for his tree because he doesn't have any. and i wanted to see his face when he opened them. and i was just so excited. and now im sad. like really sad. 
i guess the best i can do now is to right one of my letters. and let him go. because it's just for the best. and that's that. 
if he got aggravated after only 2 months... how did i manage for my whole life.i should just remember everything good that happened. and that he's not dying.
i just have to tell myself its all for the best and that everything will be ok.
is it really bad that i constantly need the assurance of everything being ok??

so i was thinking and wondering... 
 honest to god what do you think of me?? like seriously. 

(if it's really bad, try to be as gentle as possible)

this sexy texan is out for now.  i love you all. like for real."

"event","ok i was thinking and i though you might take interest in  certain things that i think if guys did this for me it would be amazing.

1. dance with me for no reason
2. flowers
3. show up at my house to make my day better

thats basically it. it would pretty much melt my heart. idk. w/e

so here's what im asking...
if you're a guy, how much of this would you do? 

if you're a girl,would you want a guy to do this for you?


oh and im having a movie party on the 8th. come if you think you're cool and if you're not a witch or gay.youre not allowed to just show up so youve gotta tell me in advance if you're going to come."

WHY CAN'T ANYONE EVER UNDERSTAND THAT I LIKE TO BE QUIET SOMETIMES? I DON'T ALWAYS HAVE TO TALK!! JESUS
just because I want to be quiet sometimes it doesn't mean I'm depressed. ok. that's enough of that no one has any idea. today was stupid i don't know what the deal is with school anymore. it seems so much longer when i count the days. i just can't wait until summer.

tv all shopped a little on saturday then went to elise's house. that
was fun i got hit in the shoulder by chelsea. damn that hurt. i really
felt that when my monsignor was commenting about boobilism yes many
teenage girls succumb to anorexia and boobilism due to the pressures
put on them by their parents.yea that was pretty much my sunday because
then i went shopping a little more and i bought some flowers to plant
to make up for last years lack of flowerness. but that was mostly due
to my mom's arm and there was really nothing stopping me from weeding
but hey.... it then became overrun with snakes and toads for the rest
of the summer. but this time its gonna be alright. i'm feeling quite
lonely lately. yes lonely and discarded. extremely i mean its like no
one wants me EVER or at least hasn't within an excess of 6 months.im
such a loser. idk ever since that night i had the o-so-perfect dream
there hasn't been anything good that i could remember. how could i
forget all the dreams i've had? it's kind of wierd. i'm kind of wierd.
dave wore spandex today it really creeped me out. his arms almost
looked.......womanly?... well i guess that would be creepy also. he
wants to be a woman named davina.<br>
<br>
davina the most womanly woman<br>
<br>
like um...........the wierdest thing i guess it would be that if he
gets to be more womanly than the girls at school. well maybe they
aren't womanly, slutty is more like it but they tend to be feminine.
maybe one day he might be beat up and that will make him straight. or
at least get him to move.&nbsp;&nbsp; o well i need to go shower. bye<br>"

"event","<font size=""3""><span style=""color: rgb(102, 102, 204);"">well it's
friday and i'm at home pretty much as usual&nbsp; but hey what can you
expect? i'm feeling kind of lonely and like a loser. i just can't seem
to find anyone who's interested. not like i'm that wonderful of a
person anyway or attractive. it makes me feel sort of left out
everyone's around me with their someone and here i am, all alone and
wishing and waiting and hoping. <span style=""font-style: italic;"">although...</span>
the other day something happened it was quite personal but it just
brought my hopes up a bit and i actually felt like someone wanted to
care for me it was quite wonderful. and when i say personal i mean like
not sex or ""sensual"" stuff. but hey . i know it sounds&nbsp; kind of
corny but i just want someone that will hold me and give me my dance. a
dance that is for no apparent reason at all. just on the spur of the
moment when a beautiful song comes on, he'll take me up into his arms
and dance with me and it will feel like i'm flying. <font size=""5""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">YEA RIGHT</span></span><font size=""3"">&nbsp; that's when i wake up and i have to go to school to be bored to death. although that would be extremely <span style=""color: rgb(204, 0, 0);"">perfect. <span style=""color: rgb(102, 102, 204);"">it
really would be. o well i know that will never happen so whatever. on a
better note, i got a 95 on mr. kreheley's quiz and hes like o this is
one of your best efforts yet. IS THERE A REASON FOR THIS. is it gonna
keep happening like forever and ever alleluia? i was the wierdest thing
ever but i was really extremely happy about it. and i know i got 100 on
mr. faust's quiz so eat that. i'm going to go day dream or read books
where everything has a happy ending because i know i sure am not going
that way. <br>
goodbye <br>
P.S. i heart you katie and erin and there's nothing that would ever change that and i would never take anything away from you. <br>

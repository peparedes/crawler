"event","Amazing quotes I found.... 

"" I wanted a perfect ending....Now, I've learned, the hard way, that some poems don't rhyme, and some stories don't have a clear beginning, middle, and end. Life is about not knowing, having to change, taking the moment and making the best of it, without knowing what's going to happen next. Delicious ambiguity.""

- Gilda Radner

""I still believe in paradise, but now i know it's not someplace you can look for. Because it's not where you go, It's how you feel for a moment in your life. And if you find that moment, it will last forever.""

-The Beach"

I'm already counting... 13 days 'till I see you again.... 'till then I'll be thinking of you, and I'll see you every night in my dreams. Princes forever.....

I miss you.
I see your picture; I smell your skin on, the empty pillow next to mine
You have only been gone ten days, but already I am wasting away
I know I'll see you again
Whether far or soon
But I need you to know, that I care
And I miss you

"event","OK so there is only one problem w. being friends with abby and garett..... I feel somewhat depressed when I'm away from them, and since I go to boarding school much thats pretty much all the time. But i want to promise you guys that you will always be a big part of my life, even if we don't see each other very often. But this spring is gonna be awesome..... I cant wait for june, we're gonna have some more, awesome SISTAH time... and we'll plan a few weekends here and there to keep us sane ;)
anyways... back to school tomorrow. I can't say I regret going to exeter. The fct is that It's the top high school in the country and when I get out I'll have soooo many options...but right now I feel terrible. It's also been the reason for my relationship w. abby and garett, and that alon e os worth it. I feel like the people the really matter in my life are so far away. Abby, Garett, Rebecca, Emily, and my family. You are the only people I ever need and I barely get to see you. I feel like the people I really really care about keep getting taken away from me.

 It's like the wizard of oz:

***HUUUUGE TEARY HUDDLE FOR 1 DAY MORE***

*Stephen cries the whole time*
*On My Own... Abby & Stephen & Garett die from suffocation b/c their breath was taken away by Diana Kaarina & her brilliance*
*On My Own cont... the sound of fire engines & such is heard outside... *GRRRS AT NYC*

-- At the stage dooooor.... IT'S KEVIN KERN!! Stephen & Garett melt, Abby melts a little . We have a CONVERSATION about NH!!!! He did stuff at Peterborough PLAYERS! We decide to invite him to come and visit us sometime. HE TOUCHED ABBY (NOW MINE) PEN!! *Abby tries to take the pen away & go to Randal Keith, Stephen & Garett yell: ""GIVE KEVIN THE PPPPPEEEEEEN"" -- WE get CALLBACKS for MARIUS in LES MIS b/c he CALLS US BACK to borrow our writing utensil!!!!! *hahaha*
-- We meet Randal Keith!! So good!

She was the cutest thing EVER, & SO NICE! WE HAD A CONVERSATION! We're BEST FRIENDS NOW! She thought we were *THIIIIIIIIISSSSS* nice!! 
-- We go *back* to Terrance Mann to get his autograph, b/c, he IS Terrance Mann, but go back & say goodbye to ""Di"" before we go.

Then we had to say goodbye to Garett.... *frowns* HE HAS A 2nd CALLBACK FOR OLIVER TODAY AT 12!!! AAGHH! 

Ride home. Nuff said. Let's just say, the high from NYC wore off... & there was sadness.

CONCLUSION:

anyways... yeah i've had a shity few days... nothing in particular, but teh end of winter term was SOO stressful, and now I'm back in my empty house... but leaving for the caribbean tomorrow.... YAY!!!
I don't know what to do anymore. I know that I really can't have a relationship w. a guy till i come out to my parents. But I am so scared. So scared. This is going to be the hardest thing I've ever ever done, I don't want to live with the consequences if there are any. Even being around them now and knowing that I'm keeping this HUGE secret from them... it really hurts. I can't deal with this for much longer....
And then there's abby..... i want her to get better so badly, I've been there before, not as bad, but i still know how it feels. I feel like a terrible person, I think she might be mad at me, but I don't know why. 
Looking forward to NYC--- <2 weeks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

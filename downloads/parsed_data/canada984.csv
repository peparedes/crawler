"event","what the fuck am i doing?  i am fucking up my senior year.  thats what im doing.

i always thought it would be ok for me to be selfish once in a while cuz i always thought i was the type of person that tried to please others before myself.  i wanted to do something for ""me"" for a change.  just this once.  so did she.  but now i know why being selfish is such a bad thing.  cuz when youre selfish, you are always hurting someone else.  but what makes it worse is when you know exactly what youre putting that person through cuz youve just finished going through it, and it was one of the worst experiences of your life.  that just isnt me.  i dont do shit like that.  whyd i do it this time?  i knew exactly how he would feel, but i still let her do it.  i knew it would be even worse than what i went through.  what the fuck was i thinking?  i was somehow able to justify it to myself.  ""don't worry, it's ok cuz yadda yadda yadda and yadda yadda yadda and so on,"" but no matter how many ""good"" reasons there were to go through with it, none of them were really that ""good.""  in fact, all of them were shit.  it sucks knowing that i just went through the shittiest time of my life, and it's not even as bad as what they are feeling right now.  she should feel horrible and he should feel betrayed and crushed.  you know what i feel?  nothing.  cuz i am fucking done with everything.  im done with prom, im done with school, im done with myself.  i cant believe i let her go through with it, twice.  youre a horrible person, Brady.  youre fucking horrible.  but the sad thing is, you arent even the worst.  you didnt even make the decision.  you didnt tell him ""no,"" twice.  i'm so disappointed with you, Brady.  you make me sick.

and that is why i have decided not to go to prom.  this decision isnt final, but its looking pretty definite.  seriously though, whats the point of going.  im going to have that overbearing feeling the whole night.  i wont be able to have fun.  so i might as well have that feeling by myself in my room where i can cry for the whole night and let everything out than feign happiness in front of a bunch of people but really be tearing myself apart on the inside.  seriously though, whats the fucking point?"

"event","this might seem like a boastful or braggy entry, but you know what?  i worked hard for this shit and i need to put it into words, so eat a dick.  anyway...

so where am i going to school next year you ask?  well, thats quite a question and it has no for sure answer.  in my mind i am going to UCLA, but there is this little thing called ""money"" that might affect that decision.  so here's the low down...

i really really really really really reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeally want to go to UCLA.  i think it is the perfect school for me.  when i visited it, i got really good vibes from it.  the vibe was ""We get our shit done and we do it well, but we are gonna have a kick ass time while we do it.""  and its in bel aire for crying out loud.  however, being a state school, they give out very little money.  so little that i didnt even get any.  so that means tuition and room and food and all that shit would be $20G's a year.  now for those of you that know me, i live in el cajon, which means paying for that is a big problem.  not to mention my brother is in his last year at a $30+G school.  the money is the only thing holding me back, which means i have to take a look at my other options, which arent at all bad.  most people would love to have these choices.  but nonetheless, they are not UCLA, so i dont want to go there.

the university of southern california is my second choice.  i really liked the look of the campus and i got a good feeling from it too.  it feels like what an east coast school would feel like, even though ive not been to a school there.  its weird, just trust me on it.  but anyway, the vibe here was ""Yeah, we get out shit done really well, and we might have a good time on the way,""  which isnt as appealing as UCLA's.  at first the ""all business"" attitude was what attracted me to USC, but then i went to UCLA and i decided ""all business"" wasnt for me.  also, the surrounding area was sorta sketchy.  thats not a problem for the first couple years, but it would be my third year when i live off campus in some ghetto ass neighborhood.  so thats two strikes against USC.  however, there is a BIG plus.  tuition and room and board and food and books and all that comes to a total of $40 grand.  now there's no way i could afford that, but USC made it very affordable and appealing when they gave me $31,000 to go there.  thats a hard offer to turn down.  if only it were UCLA.

and then there's my third choice, Notre Dame of South Bend, Indiana.  ever since i was a kid i wanted to go there.  its such a prestigious school.  not to mention their football team kicks ass.  but anyway, its in Indiana and i dont think i could move there unless i couldnt go to USC or UCLA, but they definitely made it more of an option for me.  tuition alone is $27 thousand dollars.  thats not even including books and room and board and food and condoms.  then the bastards decide to give me $26 thousand dollars to go there.  the nerve of those people.  so pretty much i just pay to live there and go to school there pretty much for free.  ill be able to pay that difference for all four years by the end of this summer.  but regardless, its in Indiana.  what the fuck would i do there?  its still cool to think about it though.

and then there's my fourth choice, Loyola Marymount University.  it's in LA and its where my brother goes.  i could care less about this school.  it was my backup, but i dont even need a backup now.  Notre Dame is my backup now i guess.  not many people can say that.  but anyway, theyll probably give me a full ride or close to it seeing as better schools have offered me more and my brother goes there.  it's still a great school, its just not for me.

so i've decided im going to UCLA, but i need to convince my parents that now.  we are gonna sit down with all the financial information from each school and talk this shit out and figure out how we are gonna pay for everything.  can you say ""fatty loan""?  but seriously, i want this all to be over with so i can send in my UCLA housing request ASAP so i can get the housing complex that has a ping pong table.  but seriously, im just stoked i got into four great schools and they gave me great deals, except for the cunts at UCLA.  Go Bruins!"

work sucks a really fat cock.  i had to work 10-6:30, which is open to close.  not only did i miss the superbowl, but i worked the whole time with my gay boss.  we seriously had about 10 minutes total worth of conversation in the 8 and a half hours we were working.  im not even kidding.  lets just say the store looked really clean all day and the customers got way too much attention.  but what makes it really gay is i had originally gotten Leah to work for me from 2-6:30 so i could go home and watch the superbowl.  then she calls me today at work with some bullshit story about how her mom threw her back out and now she has no one to watch her son and she cant come in.  yadda yadda yadda, i dont care.  whatever.  now im gonna ask for this friday off becuz that is the day we play valhalla, and i reeeeeeeeeeally wanna go to that game, and they better let me have it off, otherwise im gonna quit.  but its ok, i stole some socks and gel inserts to make up for the injustice.  haha, down with morals.

theres a fatty hole.  hopefully itll be patched up without any remaining damages.  tomorrow shall be devoted to filling that hole, if schedules allow it.  and if not tomorrow, the next day, or the next day, or the next day...you get the picture.

i havent had anyone to seriously talk to in a while.  all this stuff inside me is there, but i cant get it out.  a lot has happened in the past couple weeks and ive had no one to vent to.  and knowing me, the time when i do have a chance i will have forgotten most of it.  fuck.

this is a decent entry for me.  its been a while since ive had a lj entry of any substance.  well, i guess thats my entry for the month.  until next time..."

but anyway, about the rest of my life.  oh wait, that doesnt matter cuz my arm has finally healed and thats the only important thing."

lj sucks.  i wish i could record my thoughts and then transfer to my computer cuz this is not at all what i was planning on talking about.  oh well, so it goes.

changed the voicemail on my phone.  its cool now.  a little D12 anyone?

5 periods tomorrow.  sweet ass.  and i have an orthodontist appointment, so its really like only 4 periods.  but 5 consistently now.  that is way rad.  i cant wait to see what my new english class will be like.

my brother stopped by this weekend for a day.  that was pretty cool.  its always cool to see him.  one of these weekends i need to go up to his house and get alcohol poisoning and a girl pregnant.  how cool would that be though?  a high school guy getting a college girl pregant.  i'd have bragging rights for life.
""you know what, Brady?  You're an idiot.""
""whatever dude.  how many college chicks have you gotten pregnant?""
""well, none right now, but-""

"event","YAY FOR FINALS!!!  had biology and calculus today.  in biology, mr bailey lectured for two boring hours on speciation and whatnot.  good fun.  then i had the big calculus final.  i need an 82% to keep and A in the class.  i studied soooooo much.  i studied by myself for a couple hours, studied in a group for about 2 hours, and then studied by myself for another hour and a half.  i must say, the final was easier thani  thought, but i still dont know if i got an 82%.  im gonna check tomorrow.  if i donthave an A, im gonna be soooo pissed.  all that hard work for a B.  i could have done a lot less and still gotten the same grade.  but its not about the work.  its about me getting an A in my math class cuz i need it so it will look good to colleges since i might be a math or science major.  ""the waiting is the hardest part.""

tomorrow is econ and oceanography.  i could take a crap on the econ test, turn it in, and still get an A.  oceanography is simply standing there while kerry does all the work for our project.  oh, and did i mention, I'M DROPPING OCEANOGRAPHY!!!!  i called the universities and they said it was ok.  my counselor has already taken care of it.  its gonna be cool getting out after fifth.  watch out chani, cuz im about to cause some drama in your class.

this weekend is gonna be fun i hope.  time to let of some steam for the one final i had to study for.  senior year is a joke."

worked 10-6:30 today.  it sucked.

i finally got to study for spanish.  it was actually really fun.  i havent studied for spanish in a while and it was good to finally do it again.

C&P has been read.  wait.  i mean C&P summaries have been read.

first day of finals i have calculus.  im hella nervous about it.  i need an 82% on it to keep my A.  it'll be tough.  hopefully ill learn a lot at the study party.

"event","let starts serious while everything is fresh.

do i seem like the sort of person who would use someone else for my benefit?  i didnt think so.  but after i was accused of this, i looked at myself again.  so lets say i did use someone to get what i really wanted and they got really hurt.  i dont think i could do that.  i would feel too bad.  so i keep telling myself that i wouldnt be able to do it cuz i cant stand it when i hurt someone.  but when i really look, i think i might be doing it subconsciously or some shit like that.  i know that sounds corny but whatever.  although i dont mean to do it, i could be telling myself i couldnt use someone just so i can continue doing what im doing and actually end up using them.  here's another crack at that last statement.  maybe my intentions now are not to use that person, but in the end that is what might happen, and i tell myself i couldnt use that person just so i can use that person in the end.  and that thought just makes me sick.  i really do think i am a good person despite the stealing and drug use and cheating.  i am sensitive to others feelings, and i do care about how i make others feel.  and that fact that someone accused me of using them is not ok with me.  it makes me not like myself.  and it sucks cuz i dont even know what the hell im doing.  i might not be able to use someone or i can but i just tell myself i cant so i actually can in the end.  i need to figure out what the fuck i'm doing cuz the longer i wait the harder it is to change plans.  i just need some definite answers so i can make some final decisions, but i dont think i'll get those answers anytime soon.  so it pretty much comes back to me making a decision.  if only i could read minds.  but yeah, so saturday and sunday night should be very interesting.  lets hope i grow some balls before then and do something about this.  cant i just have both???

but anyway, lets get to some happy news.  i bought some shoes today.  i actually bought them.  with money and everything.  it felt weird to buy shoes for a change.  but anyway, i got these sick as shoes from hanger 94.  they are DVS's and they are cream colored with brown laces.  what was that?  you want to see them?  ok, click on this link.  http://sk8shop.hypermart.net/products/shoes.html.  the shoe is called DVS Team - Prophet Cream.  click on that link and a pic will pop up.  the pic is ok, but it doesnt do justice to how cool these shoes really are.  youll have to see them in person to know what i mean.  but yeah, they were $69.99 and worth every penny.

happy things today.  econ GSE was easy.  spanish final will be VERY easy.  no work accomplised in calculus.  the oceanography ""final"" (if it can really be called a final) was really easy.  and the english assessment essay was bullshit.  

bad things today.  no work accomplished in calculus and shit caused.  realizing i have to do oceanography makeup work over the weekend.  work.  being accused of using someone.

things to look forward to.  saturday night plans, whatever they might happen to be.  sunday night studying for spanish final and having dinner with someone.

things not to look forward to.  saturday night plans, whatever they might happen to be.  sunday night studying for spanish final and having dinner with someone.

ah jeez.  now i have nothing to do, so that means im gonna start thinking and shit and get al upset.  whatever.  im outty."

"event","so its 1 am and i just got back from mishka's rocking b-day party and im playing music as loud as i can right now cuz my parents are still out partying.  they are fucking crazy i tell you.

so today was a solid day.  made some money at work, got some closure on the whole affair but not sure if i'm over it, and had a good time at michelle's.  you know, it's weird.  i dont seem like the type of person to dwell on something, but i just dont want to let go for some reason.  i thought i was actually over it until it was actually said.  oh well, im moving on, and rather quickly i might add.

so im assuming most of you already know about the new season, seeing as i was bombarded with a bunch of questions and dirty looks and glares tonight.  this eminem lyric comes to mind: 
""Cus what you say is what you say, say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin' it/just remember how you said it when you was sprayin' it, so who you playin' wit, huh?""
go ahead and talk all the shit you want.  i dont even care.  but if you get to do it, then i get to return the favor to you.  sounds like a fair deal to me.  and no this isnt directed to anyone in particular.

so much homework left to do.  read 60 pages of C&P, do an econ packet, do spanish assignments, and do bio shit.  luckily i am working 10-6:30 tomorrow with jon, so ill be able to get most of that done hopefully.  if anyone wants to come visit me tomorrow, that would be swell.

well, its 1:30 and my parents just got home.  my mom is so drunk.  its funny.  she came in my room and was talking to me, and she said she wasnt leaving my room until i told her this certain thing.  so i just sit there saying nothing and she stands in the doorway.  so i ask her about her night and then she leaves.  and i say ""i thought you werent leaving until i told you,"" so she comes back in and stands in the doorway.  then she gets distracted with my pez dispenser and plays with that and leaves and forgets all about it.  drunk moms are funny.  anyway, goodnight.  and happy birthday michelle."

so tomorrows plans are as follows.  go to the immigration office for some papers i have to fill out cuz im mexican, take a trip down to the famous footwear in alpine, maybe stop by bread basket, maybe go to hanger and buy the coolest shoes ever, depending on how the famous footwear trip goes, and maybe hang out with the best season of all.

"event","it seems like a fitting day for me to FINALLY update my lj, being friday the 13th and all, although today was actually a good night.  so lets get this party started...

so as you have probably noticed, i am still wearing my splint even though i was supposed to get it off yesterday at my appointment.  so the doctor tells me that there is really no change in bone since last month, and its healing really slowly.  so she tells me to come back in one month and keep wearing the splint.  arg.  it could be up to 3 more months in the fucking splint.  and if its not healed by the 3 months, then they will rebreak my arm and do a bone graph from my hip and fit my arm back together with pieces of my hip in it.  so then i would be back in a cast again and repeat the whole fucking process.  lets pray that doesnt happen.  shit that would suck so badly.  so now i am gonna quit soccer becuz there is no chance for me to play any games this season, and that was my whole incentive before.  so no more ""light"" practices.  to hell with it all.  im gonna do it monday.  fuck that is gonna suck.  i never thought i wouldnt play my senior year soccer season.  what a bad day it was yesterday ;(

today was pretty cool.  i woke up hella early and bought breakfast burritos and brought them to bio.  then we watched a funny movie in econ.  in spanish i didnt fail the test, so that makes for a good period.  calculus test was sort of upsetting, but hey, it happens.  oceanography is a joke and im gonna drop it next semester most likely.  and english was gay cuz i didnt know the answer to my question cuz i havent read that far.  so i think the good outweigh the bad thus far.

work was ok.  nothing great.  my friends eric and dane from grossmont visited me, which was pretty cool.  the day didnt go by horribly slowly, so that was good.  set a new record for closing the store.  normally supposed to be out of there by 9:30 according to store procedure.  previous record was 9:06.  fucked that up with a time of 9:02.  it was great.  on the drive home i saw geo and lindsey driving along.  i called your cell G, but it said your voicemail wasnt set up or something and it wouldnt go through.  oh well.  then i came home and watched fast and the furious.  although it doesnt sound better than the day, tonight was much better than the day.

so the big weight has been lifted off, and now i am free to do my thang.  and it wasnt awkward, which was good.  good timing.  hopefully there are many more to come.

so tomorrow is winter formal.  soooooooo looking forward to that.  should be a fucking blast.  good times, good times.  hopefully i can get off work early so i can go home and get all sexy and shit.

time to rest up.  goodnight ya'll."

i have a feeling this week is going to go by so incredibly slowly.  i think its cuz i have so many things to look forward to.  tomorrow i get to wear something ive been wanting to for a little while.  wednesday i am gonna start soccer practice.  omg that is gonna be so nice to be able to do that again.  and then this weekend i am looking forward to getting the pussy lips off my face and finally getting a definite response.  i am looking forward to that the most, and its at the end of the week.  dammit.  i wish i could do it tomorrow.  whatever, as long as i get it done before its too late.  oh man, if its too late...

"event","so i just got back from the lovely lauren's house.  i was supposed to work from 1-6:30 tonight, but i arrived at lauren's at 3.  now you may be wondering, ""Brady, how can you be at laurens house at 3, if you are still supposed to be at work at 3 and you arent on your break?""  well, ill tell you if youll shut your yapper already.  well, it all started when i started to return shoes.  ive returned one, maybe two, pairs of shoes at the parkway famous footwear, and the lady that did the return was the main manager named gladice.  so jon tells me today that gladice is coming in around 3 or 4, and that she cant see me.  and i cant hide in the back room becuz she can walk anywhere in our store and she'll see me.  so instead he sent me home at 2:45 and wont clock me out until 6:30.  an hour and 45 minutes of work, 5 hours of pay.  good shit.  so i went to laurens house cuz i cant go home 4 hours early from work cuz that is too suspicious.  so i had the pleasure off spending a couple hours of playing ps2 and talking to lauren about stuff.  good times.  lauren, we need to lay up on your roof one night and look at stars and stuff cuz your house is perfect for that.

my stomach just got really weird and is hurting me.  ouchies.  maybe i should stick my finger down my throat and get it all over with.

this weekend was ok.  friday i spent the night at jordan's which was fun.  saturday brittanie and tyler visited me at work and we went to tyler's house and souplantation after i got off.  then tyler was an ass so i went over to sean's house and a group of us saw the new 007 flick.  i must saw, it was a big let down.  good effects and stuff, lousy writing.  but anyway, that night coulda been a lot of fun, but it turned out to be just ok.  oh well.  then today i ""worked,"" if you can even call it that and then chilled with lauren, which was long overdue by the way.  so that makes up my ok weekend.

youd never know it, but i took a 2 hour break in that paragraph to lay by the toilet waiting to throw up, take an hour nap, eat dinner, and shower.  ah the wonders of lj.

so yeah, winter formal's in like 3 weeks.  it should be a sicbrotight good time.  looking forward to that.  still need to get my tux and a large sum of money.

i got paid on friday, and i have decided that it will not go into my account like the rest of my checks.  i am gonna cash this bitch and go shopping or something.  $220 to blow on whatever the fuck i want.  sweet.

i feel like i should tell you whats on the up and up with me cuz you are livejournal and i tell you everything.  lets go in chronological order, which is the order i remember it in, not when it actually happened.

so my arm is still broken.  it sucks.  i was hoping that when i went back to get my cast off, they wouldnt put anything else on and i could go straight into physical therapy and be back doing light practices by the end of the month.  but here's how it went:
""doctor, can i play soccer soon?""
""fuck no.  my job is to make you as miserable as possible, so how bout i slap this gay little splint on your arm for four fucking weeks and crush your dreams of being back by januray first by saying it is highly doubtful youll be playing by then.  MUHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!! I HATE YOU!!!""
""ok.  well thanks for ruining my life.""
fucking doctors.  i hate you.

on a lighter note, i am going to winter formal, and no im not going alone.  i am going with brittanie mccloskey.  yeah, i know like half of you reading this hate her, but you know what?  i dont care.  im looking forward to it.  its gonna be a lot of fun.  but tell me how pimp this sounds for my tux.  i'm thinking ill go with a black shirt and vest, with a silver tie (not bow tie) and black adidas shoes with the shiny silver stripes on them.  so what do you think?  yeah, im hot.  but it all depends on her dress, so its wishful thinking for now.  but yeah, itll be fun.

i bought a playstation 2 for $63.02 yesterday.  i went to trade in all my old gaming systems, and the lady told me i would get 144 bucks.  so im like ""sic,"" and i thought i could come back later with my credit to buy it later.  but i cant do that cuz the store wont allow it.  so i either need to pull $78 bucks out of my ass or lug all the shit home that i brought and then lug it back when i have the cash.  so im like ""fuck.  i only gots $63 dollars.""  so she's like ""let me see what i can do for you cuz you are hot and i want your nuts.""  so she goes in the computer and magically changes the prices on some of the stuff that im trading in and she says itll cost me $63.02 after tax.  so im like ""sic.""  so i buy it right then, but now i am completely broke and i dont have any games for it.  CHANI, STEAL SOME GAMES FROM YOUR UNCLE!  but hey, i bought a brand new ps2 for $15 cheaper than anyone else.  that lady was really nice.  and she was like 30 something.  i think she wanted me.  cuz you dont go out of your way to help ugly people.  someone buy me a game.  preferably fifa 2003 or tony hawk 4.

ja rule's album dropped today.  sic.

i wrote my first draft of my UC personal statement essay, and i took it in to get looked at by ms mccurry at lunch.  so she's giving me feedback staright to my face, which is a little weird, but whatever.  so she pretty much reamed my asshole right in front of me, but its cool.  its good feedback.  and anyway, i got her back good over the summer...oops, ive said too much.

so overall, my life is going really well, except for the whole soccer thing.  we'll see how i feel in a couple weeks.  whether ill have gotten over it or crying my eyes out at 5 pm every night (thats when practice starts), i dont know, but it should be interesting to see.  so i think i must go and shower and finish my ink stained personal statement so she can kill it again tomorrow.  lates yo."

typing in lj just doesnt do it for me anymore.  everytime i have something of actual substance that i want to type here i dont feel like typing it once i get to the site.  oh well.  doctors suck.

hey, tell me if this sounds cheesy.  i was thinking about right a song about my arm for reflections, since its for extra credit and all.  i was thinking i would set it to the beat of ""the way i am"" by eminem.  leave me comments about what you think."

its been a while.  i get my cast off in 9 days hopefully.  i had an orthodontist appointment today.  hopefully i'll have my braces off in december.  thats what they told me, but then again what do doctors know about due dates?

""he's dead.""
""no im not.""
""well, hes gonna die soon.""
""no im not.  i think im getting better.""
*CLUNK*
""ok then.""

sorry if i butchered that scene from the holy grail, but it expresses how i feel.  im sick, but im getting better.  its all about the liquids and pills now.  today was pretty miserable.  an all day headache/runny nose/sore throat.  and i had two tests today.  napes on that bro.  but there was some relief in english today when we watched a movie for part of the period and 6 magical hands put me to sleep.  mmmmmmmmmm, sleep.

i have nothing witty to say, so why i am writing this entry?  oh well.  so it goes.  indecisiveness is key.

maybe ill go to a therapist for an unbiased opinion, chani."

"event","HOLY MOTHER OF GOD I GET MY CAST OFF IN 12 HOURS AND 30 MINUTES!!!  i have had this blasted thing on for 6 weeks and two days, as of tomorrow.  and what a trip it has been.  lets count the ways it temporarily changed my life:
-i couldnt shower at any time i want cuz i needed to have someone awake to wrap my arm in a trash bag, so thats y i only showered 3 times a week.  haha, jk.  it was 4.
-i couldnt wear undershirts comfortably (its hard to explain)
-i had to do my hair with one hand, which is harder than it sounds.
-my mom wouldnt let me drive anywhere that required the freeway cuz i could only drive w/one hand, but little does she know...
-it was extremely difficult to put deodorant under your right arm with your right arm.  try it,  its fun.
-i couldnt eat anything that required cutting unless someone was home to cut it for me.
-it was hard carrying anymore than 2 objects at the same time.
-i couldnt do much work at work, but i guess i shouldnt complain about that.
-i experienced the absolute worst pain i have ever felt in my life.  ouch.  i love you morphine.
-it was really hard to get dressed sometimes and really hard to tighten my belt, especially at school.
-it scared girls away and thats why i havent had a girlfriend recently.  at least thats what i tell myself.
-i couldnt go swimming.
-i couldnt open my juice box during lunch (thanks j-rod)
-i had to wear my backpack over one shoulder, which got really old really quickly.  i dont know how some of you girls do it.
-i had to have a broken arm on my birthday.
-i couldnt play soccer or tennis.
-and an unlimited number of other small annoyances that escape me at the moment.

i m so happy i m getting it off tomorrow.  but i m still scared about whether the doctor will say its ok for me to play soccer.  God i hope so.  that would be the biggest disappointment.  yeah, ywah, i wont bore you by going on endlessly about it.  but i wont get much sleep tonight becuz i will be thinking of my plan of attack to ambush the doctor with so he will let me play soccer.  anyway...

in case you didnt catch it above, I M GETTING MY CAST OFF TOMORROW!!!  anyway...

i have nothing else to say except:
""for all the weed that i smoked (yo this blunts for you)
to all the people ive offended (yeah fuck you too)
to all the friends i used to have (i miss my past)
but the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass!!!"""

so i worked 23 fucking hours this weekend.  i could not have worked one more hour.  that is the most i can work.  my maximum.  i maxed out at 23.  the good thing is i will have a FATTY paycheck.  the bad news is it is really hard to make any sort of plans.  oh well, so it goes...

i did all my homework at work today.  the advantages of working with jon.  oh, and i ""bought"" another pair of shoes this weekend.  hey, dont hate.  you cant prove i didnt buy them.  i got the receipt and all.  muhahahahaha.

so many things i want to buy.  mainly clothes:
-this sicbrotight volcom hat at hangar 94
-a cool snap button down shirt
-a blue or black jacket
-a blue or black hooded sweatshirt (depending on the color of the jacket
-a belt (maybe)
-a blue adidas jacket to match my pants and shorts
-maybe a few more t-shirts from rider's house
-fifa 2003 when it comes out
-a ps2 to plat fifa 2003 on
-a manicure (lauren and christa, you take care of that one)
-a life

and so ends the list of things brady wants.  feel free to give me any of these things, especially the ladt one.

the newest eminem song is good.  download ""lose yourself"" by eminem.  it has chani's approval, so it must be good.

my birthday is on wednesday.  hooray for me.  i turn the big one seven.  wow, im old.  ill be able to see rated R movies!!!!!  even some juniors are older than me.  whatever.  i m happy.  it makes dating freshman not look so bad.  haha, just kidding.  i dont care if you think it's bad.  haha.  joking again.  i'm good.  in the words of tyler, ""SOLO UN CHISTE"" (spanish for ""ONLY A JOKE"").

i need to sleep now.  goodnight my lovelies.  oh.  possibly birthday bash on saturday.  i'll keep you posted.  oh, one more important thing...

<b>WET BRAIN</b> (my brother's band) <b>IS PLAYING AT THE SCENE ON THURSDAY.  <u>ALL AGES</i>!!!!!</b>  its 8 bucks to get in, but its worth it.  seriously.  i'll keep you posted on that too.  lots of people will be going.  contact brady stevenson at 1-800-hot-guys for further info.

itchy itchy itch itch all day long
itchy itchy itch itch please dont last
itchy itchy itch itch i sing this song
itchy itchy itch itch in my cast

i know.  that was brilliant.  my album comes out this december, so keep an eye out in stores.

my arm itches sooooooooooooooooo badly right now.  i cant stand it.  and when i stick my finger down my arm to scratch.  i always come up with a little dead skin.  not to mention my left hand has such dry skin on it since i cant get it wet very often.  i cant wait to see what my arm looks like when the cast comes off in 2 weeks.  hopefully jared is wrong and i wont have to get another cast.  that would suck.  hopefully kirby is wrong and i wont need to shave my arms.  hopefully i will be able to convince my mom to let me play soccer.  hopefully this paragraph will end.

i didnt get the expected call tonight, and i couldnt do it cuz i dont know where to call.  oh well, sometimes people are just too busy.  its still a bummer though.

<B>MY BIRTHDAY IS IN <BLINK>7</BLINK> DAYS!!!</B>  i still dont have any plans for it.  someone give me a good party idea.  oh, and i expect a cool gift from EVERYONE.

good luck with your job chani.

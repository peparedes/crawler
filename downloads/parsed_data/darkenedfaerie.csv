<h2>You'll Get Caught Doing it At a Party!</h2>
You're a total party girl who likes guys just as wild you are.<br><br>
You don't try to, but you always seem to draw attention!<br><br>
You love to have a good time, and you're likely to get it on at a party.<br><br>
You love to flirt, tease... and of course have sex!<Br><bR>
It's just so exhilerating to have sex in a strange, semi-public place...<Br><br>
With someone you've just met!<br><br>
Plus, at a party, you can always reinvent yourself into a lesbian - <br><br>
or group sex star!<br><br>
Whatever you do, make sure you look your best at parties...<br><br>
And take that object of your desire upstairs.<br><br>
Just make sure the next horny couple doesn't burst in and catch you!

<h2>You Are A <a href=""http://www.quizdiva.com/kissquiz.html"">Juicy Kisser</a>!</h2>
<b>About Your Kissing Style:</b><br><br>		 
Your lips are totally kissable baby, and you know how to use them.<br>
You are the perfect  - with the right combo of lips and tongue.<br>
It's important to flaunt it, so kiss early and often on dates!<br><br>
<b>What Your Kissing Style Says About You:</b><br><br>
You're 100% hot, and you know it. You're all about being sexy, all the time.<br>
You have no trouble scoring dates or kisses ... <br>
Just trouble getting rid of jealous people trying to show you up!<br>
You attract attention from every hot guy and girl... even before you show off your kissing skills.<br><br>
<b>Your Personal Kissing Matches and Mismatches:</b>
<br><br>
Go out with another Juicy Kisser and you'll be the power couple of the party. Sure, you'll have a ton of
hot kisses, but only after everyone there has checked you guys out. Hook it up with a 
Romantic Kisser and you may have found your soulmate.
Romantic Kissers will be attracted to your appeal, and you'll appreciate their loyalty.
<br><br>
Keep away from Carnal Kissers! They'll just try to play you for sex, and 
ruin your reputation in a heartbeat. And Freaky Kissers are way too wild and 
rough for your style. You prefer pleasure to pain, thank you very much.

<br><br>
<h2>You Are Always Horny</h2>
You are naughty, and your mind is almost always in the gutter.<br><br>
When you get horny, you want it fast! You're not into wasting your time playing hard to get.<br><br> 
Whether you've got a willing partner or not, you are going to give yourself a blast of a time.<br><br>
You aren't like most girls.<br><br>
You like porno, you are forward, and you are willing to experiment with both guys and girls.<br><br>
You are a rare breed. It isn't just your sex drive - it's your open mind as well.<br><br>
It's hard to being a horny girl in this world, but you handle yourself well!

"event","yeah i had work tonight.. i got home about an hour ago... yes an hour ago... i hung out with Bryan a bit after work... it was awsome... i think im starting to like him alot... im getting the feeling Jordan is over me.. as much as I love him im so confused... i want him so bad! i need him... i love him... and im still in love with him..

*Spare a little candle
Save some light for me
Figures up ahead
Moving in the trees
White skin in linen
Perfume on my wrist
And the full moon that hangs over
These dreams in the mist

Darkness on the edge
Shadows where I stand
I search for the time
On a watch with no hands
I want to see you clearly
Come closer than this
But all I remember
Are the dreams in the mist

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away

Is it cloak n dagger
Could it be spring or fall
I walk without a cut
Through a stained glass wall
Weaker in my eyesight
The candle in my grip
And words that have no form
Are falling from my lips

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away

There's something out there
I can't resist
I need to hide away from the pain
There's something out there
I can't resist

The sweetest song is silence
That I've ever heard
Funny how your feet
In dreams never touch the earth
In a wood full of princes
Freedom is a kiss
But the prince hides his face
From dreams in the mist

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away*

yeah i like those lyrics.. anyways i have work tomarrow toooo! 10-6:30 Bryan's working 10-3 *tear tear* maybe he'll be able to hang out after, if he wants... i wanna see him again... <333"

Too much is not enough
Nobody said this stuff makes any sense
We're hooked again

Point of no return
See how the buildings burn
Light up the night
Such pretty sight

Adrenaline keeps me in the game
Adrenaline you don't even feel the pain
Wilder than your wildest dreams
When you're going to extremes
It takes adrenaline

Sail through an empty night 
It's only you and I who understand
There is no plan

Get closer to the thrill
Only time will kill
What's in your eyes
Is so alive

Adrenaline keeps me in the game
Adrenaline you don't even feel the pain
Wilder than your wildest dreams
When you're going to extremes
It takes adrenaline

Run through the speed of sound
Every thing slows you down
And all color that surrounds you
Are bleeding to the walls
All the things you really need
Just wait to find the speed
Then you will achieve 
Escape velocity

Too much is not enough
Nobody gave it up
Im not the kind
To lay down and die

Adrenaline 
keeps me in the game
Adrenaline 
you don't even feel the pain
Wilder than your wildest dreams
When you're going to extremes
It takes adrenaline


Adrenaline
Screaming out your name
Adrenaline 
you don't even feel the pain
Wilder than your wildest dreams
When you're going to extremes
It takes adrenaline


You don't even feel the pain
You don't even feel the pain
I'm going to extremes
There is nothing in between
You don't even feel the pain
You don't even feel the pain
You don't even feel the pain
You don't even feel the pain

Turn your anger into lust 
I'm still here, but you don't trust at all

Take what's yours and leave the rest 
So I'll survive

And I'll - I'll be waitin' 
Livin' like a house on fire 
What you fear is your desire 
It's hard to deal 
I still love the way you feel

Drownin in this petty world

a convo that i even learned from...and i was the person saying it..

eleCtRONICliquid: hi 
SurvivingPunk: hows it goin
eleCtRONICliquid: slow
eleCtRONICliquid: u?

SurvivingPunk: its going slow i guess too
SurvivingPunk: lotta shiz is happening in my life at once
eleCtRONICliquid: sucky
eleCtRONICliquid: yah same here but its not anything good
SurvivingPunk: hows school
eleCtRONICliquid: sucky
SurvivingPunk: heh
eleCtRONICliquid: hows school 4 u
SurvivingPunk: its okay... some classes are lame, and i dun like my friends, but its live-able
eleCtRONICliquid: ...yea
eleCtRONICliquid: hows the girl thing goin?
SurvivingPunk: girl thing? heh
eleCtRONICliquid: lol natalie
SurvivingPunk: oh, heh, yea, so shes back from rehab.. and i dun even love her anymore, but shes more obsessed over me, and im telling her that my love has faded for her, and she doesnt want to accept the fact
eleCtRONICliquid: :-(
eleCtRONICliquid: did u ever love her?
SurvivingPunk: yea..
SurvivingPunk: yeah, sorta..
eleCtRONICliquid: well love never dies
eleCtRONICliquid: shes infatuated with you....and u use to be infatuated with her, you got past it she hasnt, shes upset and going insane...but she'll get over it, and u feel bad...
eleCtRONICliquid: life fucking sucks huh?
SurvivingPunk: totally man
eleCtRONICliquid: lol 
eleCtRONICliquid: its something that we'll all go through many many times....u just gotta figure out the tricks to getting around all the pain
eleCtRONICliquid: once you've done that you're good to go....but eventually u will fall in love and i guess you'll know it...i dont think i have fallen in love yet...not enough to kill me...i have loved and i still love the people i have loved..but i kno now that if they ever loved me...than they still do 
SurvivingPunk: really? u dont think u have fallen in love with tom? that it was all infautation?
eleCtRONICliquid: ..i was more in love with jordan than i was with tom
eleCtRONICliquid: i loved tom...i wasnt in love with him 
SurvivingPunk: i get it
eleCtRONICliquid: i was obsessed and dependant 
eleCtRONICliquid: i learned to be more independant
eleCtRONICliquid: being independant is the key to EVERYTHING 
eleCtRONICliquid: live your life on what you believe and do what u want to do and how you want to do it...live for yourself not others
eleCtRONICliquid: because you're the only person who really honestly knows you
eleCtRONICliquid: lol
SurvivingPunk: dood, u should write a book
SurvivingPunk: thats some serious good stuff
eleCtRONICliquid: but dont feel bad about what you did because natalie will get over you...and soon enough she'll be ""in love"" with someone else.....
eleCtRONICliquid: and then you'll see that everything gets better with time...
eleCtRONICliquid: but i know u do feel bad because she feels like she wants to die....and shes depressed...
SurvivingPunk: ya see, i knew this was going to happen
eleCtRONICliquid: live your life, but with caution of others feelings
SurvivingPunk: from the day we first went out
SurvivingPunk: she is like... i dunno
SurvivingPunk: has too many problems in her life
eleCtRONICliquid: oh and listen to your first instincts 
eleCtRONICliquid: they  are usually true
eleCtRONICliquid: i know this from experience
SurvivingPunk: and i wanted to be more of a bestfriend than a boyfriend
eleCtRONICliquid: you should have done that from the start
eleCtRONICliquid: you do what you need to do to be happy with out stepping on other people
eleCtRONICliquid: its the best way to get around situtions
SurvivingPunk: yea...
eleCtRONICliquid: its just a hard thing to learn how to do....we all know how...we just are scared to do it sometimes
eleCtRONICliquid: talkin to you right now...sitting here....listening to this music reminds me of when i was obsessed with tom 
eleCtRONICliquid: deja vu
SurvivingPunk: those were bad times huh?
eleCtRONICliquid: yes.and no....they will be times that made me stronger and smarter
eleCtRONICliquid: i wouldnt take back anything thats ever happened to me
eleCtRONICliquid: there will be timed where i wish they never happened...but in the end im glad it all did
SurvivingPunk: so u could learn lessons from those expiernces
eleCtRONICliquid: yes...and then when it comes down to it in the end....you know exactly what to do...it prepares you for the day you actually fall in love, and then lose it forever 
SurvivingPunk: yea..
eleCtRONICliquid: sad but true...
eleCtRONICliquid: living is trying than falling and then getting back up and trying again...the day you die, is when you become to weak to stand back up
eleCtRONICliquid: always stand back up...
eleCtRONICliquid: thats the best you can do 
SurvivingPunk: true..
eleCtRONICliquid: blah im so awake... i drank 6 shots of espresso last night and its finally kickin in 
SurvivingPunk: haahha
eleCtRONICliquid: oh and theres one more piece if advice i can give you...love is the slowest form of suicide...the more you fall in love, the more of your heart you give away...and let me add, you need your heart to live, only ""fall in love "" when you know the time is right...think about it....it will eventulally make sense
eleCtRONICliquid: i think 
eleCtRONICliquid: well it did for me
SurvivingPunk: yeah... I dun think its the right time for me
eleCtRONICliquid: i promise...you WILL know when the time is right 
eleCtRONICliquid: so hows alex
SurvivingPunk: no clue, he stays indoors all the time
eleCtRONICliquid: poor little alex
SurvivingPunk: hahah
SurvivingPunk: hows ur ddr set?
eleCtRONICliquid: well as soon as i get my lisence in gonna cheer him up 
eleCtRONICliquid: its cool
SurvivingPunk: hahah
SurvivingPunk: well doodie, thanks for the talk, helped a lot, ill talk to ya later, i need rest
eleCtRONICliquid: okies good luck 




things will be ok in the end...."

Something I can't charge
I'll live around it

I won't say anything at all 
So why don't you slide 
Mmmmm slide

And I'll do anything you ever
Dreamed to be complete
Little pieces of the nothing that, fall
May put your arms around me
What you feel is what you are
And what you are is beautiful
May do you manna get married
Or run away

And I'll do anything you ever

Open up as lonely as the space between the stars

Of ugliness and emptiness 
And gently touch your face 
But every time that I touch you
You feel so far away
And every time that you need me
I feel so far away
As you lie silently beside me choking back your tears 
I wonder if you recognize 
That silence now defines us
Desperately I try to fight this overwhelming sense
That I may never find 
The strength to change 
How hopeless we've become
And every time that I touch you
You feel so far away*"

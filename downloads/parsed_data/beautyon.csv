Things are moving really fast, but we've not yet had ""the chat""...the boyfriend/girlfriend chat.  I think it maybe coming...but he's made it clear that he's not dating anybody else right now.  I know he's crazy about me.  I'm so crazy about him.  I'm at the stage where I really miss him when he's not here.  Every weekend that we spend together, gets better and better.  He wants to go somewhere next weekend, for Easter weekend.  I think we might just go to Loch Lomond for the day.  I wanted to go up north for a couple of days, but neither of us can really afford it right now.

I am being observed by the head teacher twice next week though, which is incredibly nerveracking.  I've taught in front of enough people not to be nervous by now, but when its your boss, its a bit different.  I'm sure it will be fine...I'm just a little nervous.

The show was sold out so we were lucky we were able to go. It was such an awesome show.  It was so laidback.  There was such a strange mix of people there.  Pete did a nosedive from the stage WITH his guitar.  Ouch.  He was in good form though.

It was such a random night that shona and I just couldn't stop laughing all night.  So strange.  That's why I love living in a city like Glasgow.  You never know what's around the corner.

He seemed nice enough...he said he used to be a teacher, but now he happy to be ""in the band"".  I asked him what band he was in and its friggin' Babyshambles.  So, we drink and we go onto firewater where there are apparently more free drinks all night.  I am getting drunk with Babyshambles.  Strange.  For free...even better.  Shona has to leave because she has to work the next day.  I got us on the guest list for tonight.  They're doing two sold out shows in Glasgow at Barrowlands.  I am hoping we really are on the guest list and that they didn't just say that.  I don't think they'd do that...but if they got busy they might forget.  We'll see.  I'm exhausted after partying with them all night.  And I have to work tomorrow, but it'll be fun."

Mairi and I have been talking and we would really like to live alone from now on.  I'm telling you now so you have enough time to move out.  Ben"".  What the fuck?  I don't get it.  I've lived there a MONTH.  I have been the best flatmate.  I always did my dishes and theirs.  Bought my share of supplies.  I was quiet, didn't have parties and basically barely even saw them.  I don't get it.  I think he's a coward to wait until the day after I left for Canada.  That's not cool.  I called Jen and Laura in tears and they are going to help me.  Jen said I can stay with her for free till I save up to find a new place ('cause now I'll need a deposit on a new flat which I don't have).  Laura said I could just move in with her and Shona....they live around the corner from me and they said we'll just turn the living room into my room, or we could all just move into a three bedroom flat.  I'm just so upset and really don't want to deal with moving when I get back to Scotland.  I also didn't want to deal with this over Christmas.

Another thing.  I got my first teacher paycheque deposited in my account.  I worked 9 days and we make nearly 100 pounds a day.  So was expecting about 800 pounds...it was going to be my Christmas present money AND rent for when I get back.  It was only 400 pounds.  I don't know why or what I'm going to do.  And I can't find out until I get back and look at my pay stub.  I'm so frustrated.  I can't afford Christmas gifts for anyone.  I don't know what I""m going to do.  

I just don't know how I'm going to manage with any of this."

I don't know if its because of the holidays or what.  I'm a little discouraged, but I am also only on one supply list so far, so I know that it'll be better after Christmas when I'll be on 4 or 5 different lists.  Things will pick up. 

I am excited to go home for Christmas.  That will be so nice to be home with Josh and Shelley and to spend time with my parents.  I am quite looking forward to it.  I leave Wednesday at 830AM our time and arrive 1030AM Canada time. So weird how that works.  

I am really getting into Yoga.  I go every week now, and I love it!  I am hoping to catch a class or two in Canada while I'm there.  

Its really late.  Because I'm not working this week I'm in the habit of staying up so late and sleeping in so late.  Just because I can.  It doesn't help that I have those really thick dark curtains that block out every single bit of light.  I also have a dark blue carpet in my room, so at noon...it feels like its the middle of the night.  I hate sleeping in so late though, because it throws me off my day."

"event","Today was a crazy day and I am so so glad its over.  I had to go to a brand new school today.  It was in the mountains in the middle of nowhere, so I had to take a 9 pound taxi ride there from the train station...and another one back to the station.  I arrived and realized it was a Catholic school and  I'm not Catholic.  The children had so many prayers to say during the day, I kept forgetting them.  Horrible.  I also discovered that I had primary 1.  28 five year olds.  

I also then realized that I have one autistic child and one child with severe behavioural issues.  And we had a fire drill.  It was a complete nightmare.  The Autistic child crawled under his desk and wouldn't come out.  The other difficult child wouldn't do any of the work and at one point pretended he was the teacher and all the kids started bringing their work over to them.  WTF??  The child wasn't nasty or mean, or anything like that...he just wanted to do what he wanted to do.  So much so that he totally did not respond to anything.  Not threats, not praise..nothing.  He seemed to ignore me the more I called his name and asked him to do things.  AND to top it off, I discovered that there was a camera in the corner of the room and that the head teacher can watch us at any time.  Adding to my stress.

I've never been so glad to see a work day finished.  

I am going to Spain Sunday to Tuesday.  I thought I was out of luck because tickets had gone up to 300 pounds if I left Friday...so I'm going to go later and still got them for 60 pounds.  Not too bad, just a shortened trip.  I will however, miss Hayden.  So so sad.  I see he's doing a Canadian tour in January, but I won't be there.  

This Saturday is the big Scotland football game.  If we win it'll be the biggest party ever.  Jen and I are going out to watch the game at a pub with Ewen and Bob and maybe Christian.  Stuart will actually be AT the game, which is incredible.  It should be a very fun time."

I feel good being back in Scotland.  I haven't had a moment of panic yet.  I still am a little bit numb about it.  But I spent nearly a week resting and trying to sort things out.  I love having dinner parties with my friends and having busy weekends, and going to yoga with laura tomorrow.  I love it and I've missed it a lot.  I have a full life here.

I am still waiting on my visa.  I don't know why its taking so long.  Maybe it will come today.  Rebekah is leaving on Saturday.  She applied a week after me and has gotten the visa back and booked her flight all in the time I'm waiting on mine.  Ah well.  I may have to push back my leaving date.

i can't wait for Radiohead's new album.  They are brilliant.  They aren't signed with a record company so they're releasing the album on their own website theirselves as as digital download and are letting their fans decide how much they will pay for it.  Its incredible really because nearly 100% of the proceeds will go directly to the band.  And I known I would pay a lot more for an album knowing that the band gets it all."

I will have enough money for the trip once I leave, obviously, but the visa people want to see the money now.  I don't have it, so my dad has said (on paper, not in real life) that he will ""fund"" my trip and has given his bank statements to prove it. Thing is, that doesn't prove anything.  That's what we did last time though, for my student visa and it worked...so hopefully it works this time.  I should find out in a week or so.  I'm nervous.

I saw Julie Doiron last night at the Jane Bond.  It was great.  She's so cute and funny and awkward.  I love her.  It was so cozy at the Jane Bond with my red wine and the music and the coldness outside. 

I am soaking in this fall because its the one season I've missed so much while I was in Scotland.  They don't have fall like we do.  The leave don't change...they just fall off.  The weather doesn't gradually cool down.  They don't have thanksgiving.  I love this season.  I talked my grandmother into having Thanksgiving at the cottage this year, since she has the best Thanksgivings.  

Work is good but I keep buying way too many clothes that I don't need but are too cute and cheap to pass up.  I think it comes from years of having a mediocre wardrobe...now I am stockpiling.  I remember those days of not being able to afford to buy anything...not like I really can now, but at 3.50/shirt...its not so bad.

I'm looking forward to it. 

I saw Damien Rice for the third time on Monday.  I went with Crazy cousin Greg.  He was nice.  I thought he'd corner me and ask me about Shelley the whole time but he didn't even mention her.

It was so nice being with family in the middle of the holiday, but at the same time there was family drama which I could have done with out.  My two uncles were not getting along.  But my cousin Tarah and I had a blast!  She's so sweet and funny.  I've missed her.  Barcelona was incredible.  It is such a busy city with entertainment around every corner!  Street performers and musicians everywhere.  And the Gaudi Cathedral was stunning.

I got back to Glasgow and had an awesome last week.  We went to Jez's party which was fun.  They set up DJs and a screen to shows films on.  There was a hot tub and we went camping.  I met so many wonderful people.  It was in Dumfries which is a beautiful part of Scotland.  Just gorgeous among the mountains.  

So....after the last week, Scotland just felt so good and right.  I got to talking to some people and I discovered that I can make over $50,000 teaching in Scotland.  A company called TimePlan organizes jobs for Canadians who want to teach in the UK.  Of course, I wouldn't go this time without having a job lined up.  But, I've applied today to see what happens.  If I moved back, it would probably be in Dumfries...which is about an hour from Scotland and its where a lot of Stuart's friends are from.  So I already know a lot of people from there.  

Who knows...but I do know that I can't go any longer without teaching, and it doesn't look like Canada is going to be offering me a job any time soon.  Scotland is really where I want to be.  I was miserable before I left, but that was because I worked at a call centre, making minimum wage with not enough money for food.  As a teacher, it would be different...I could travel and do stuff.  

I love being there and being surrounded by friends every minute.  I love being busy and having things to do every weekend.  I need a balance which I do not have in Canada.  My life here is not complete...I need to find a way to complete it.  A job in my chosen profession would be a good start.  

So...that's where I am at for the moment.  And it makes a lot of sense.  I think I was afraid to consider going back, before...because I wanted to pretend that I'd made a good decision in coming back to Canada.  I'm not sure I did."

I went into London today to make funeral arrangements with my parents.  It was a rough day, but I thought it was better than sitting home alone...having flashbacks that I keep having. I couldn't sleep last night because I just keep getting flashes of how my grandmother looked when I found her.  I just wish it would go away, but it won't.  Its better me to find her that way than my parents.  I'm glad my dad didn't find her...nobody should see their mom like that.  

The funeral will be Friday at 130.  She didn't have a lot of friends or know many people so I think it will be very quiet.  

Its not really a surprise to me.  She was 84.  She was healthy for the most part, so it was a shock that it happened yesterday...but I'm not surprised she's gone.  Its just the shock of finding her on the floor.  That's the hard part.  But, I'll get through it.  I'm fine.

There was talk of maybe meeting up with Clif in New Orleans while I'm there.   He's been crazy busy with the pipe band and since it's St. Paddy's season, he's still not sure if he'll be able to.  I'm crossing my fingers though, 'cause it would be nice.

"event","So I was wanting to get a tattoo for a long time.  But I had no idea what to get or where.  I finally went and got it yesterday!  

I had always wanted artwork of some sort for a tattoo...and after living in Glasgow, I decided that I really wanted something Scottish.  I decided to get a Rennie Charles MacKintosh Design.  He's a Glaswegian architect who designed tons of buildings all around Glasgow.  The Glasgow Art School being one of them.  Anyway...I then decided that I wanted to get it in the middle of my back.  

I went to Lucky Souls tattoo parlour in Cambridge with my brother's girlfriend Shelley who was getting one, too.  We were getting our tattoos done by Angela.  I decided to go first since I was pretty nervous and I didn't want to sit through Shelley's before getting mine done.  I sat down and I prepared myself for it to hurt like a bitch. 

She started and it actually wasn't that bad.  I mean, it hurts...but nothing unbearable.  Much better than I thought it was going to be.  Actually, I think I started to get kind of cocky about it.  I said to Shelley ""this is a piece of cake""...and then she hit a spot on my spine.

  Now, I knew I was SUPPOSED to eat beforehand...but I just can't eat when I'm nervous...I can't even make myself eat.  I tried, but could only manage two bites of my croissant from Tim Hortons and half of my apple juice.  I thought that would be enough.

As she hits my spine, I start to black out...just like when you stand up too fast.  I was waiting for it to clear but it got worse and worse...and then the buzzing in my ears started.  I have no idea what happened next.  Shelley said I slumped right over in my chair and twitched. She thought I was being really dramatic...or else having a seizure.  She wasn't sure which one.  

At first it felt like I was sleeping in my bed....then it felt like I was doing summersaults in a dark pool of warm water.  Then I started to think I was in the hospital or something.  I had no idea where I was or who I was with.  My first thought was that I was in an accident and I was coming out of a coma. (okay so I'm a wee bit dramatic, but I did wonder that).  Shelley said I grabbed her hand and looked confused.  The tattoo lady said ""just prop her up""....I turned around to look at her and she said ""hi there...you came back"".  

They gave me orange juice and told me to let her know when I was ready.  I was a trooper....I only needed about a minute.

She finished the tattoo in about an hour and a half and it was fine!  

It was then Shelley-Jo's turn.  She got a ""dad"" tattoo with a heart and two bluebirds holding it up.  She loves her dad.  It turned out really well.

I have a phone interview in ten minutes with the agency that does teaching placement throughout the states.  Meh.  I can't turn it down if I don't apply for the job, right?  Who knows?"

I now have a bit of money, so I took Shelley along, who was wanting to get one, too...and we booked appointments for Monday!  I am getting the Glasgow Rose on my back.  Charles Rennie Mackintosh is an Scottish architect who did all kinds of buildings, etc in Glasgow...he's known for the Glasgow Rose...it's sort of his signature.  You can find the Glasgow Rose in all kinds of art around the city...from stained glass windows in old houses, to the backs of chairs that he designed.  I'm pretty excited to get it, because I wanted some Glaswegian...but I also wanted a piece of art.  It's so pretty and I can't wait to do it.  I'm going to get it in the middle of my back...between my shoulder blades but slightly lower.  

Shelley is going to get a Dad tattoo in a heart.  So cute!  I'm a bit nervous, but I've wanted it for awhile, so it should be fine."

"event","There are so many teaching jobs out there at the moment!  It's making me excited/nervous.  I am going to try to get on the Waterloo supply list for the rest of the year, but right now they're hiring for the supply list for next year, so I think they may be full for this year.  See...in the waterloo board you have to be on the supply list first before you can even APPLY to permanent or maternity leave positions.  

If I can't get on the supply list this year, than I can apply for Maternity leave positions in either the Peel board or the Grand Erie board (brantford) and work full time till June.  

I still have to wait until my reg number comes back but it should be here when I come back from Florida.  Yay!

Still not sure what to do for next year.  I've applied to VIF which is a program that places teachers in the states.  They only do a few states though...I think my choices would be Florida, California, Georgia, North/South Carolina and Maryland.  I applied thinking that I can always turn it down if they hire me.  My thinking was that Florida, California or Georgia is a change of scenery without the culture shock.  My friend Erin lives in Georgia, so that would be another plus.  Who knows?  

I don't want to live at home next year, but part of me is thinking practically today.  I might just stick it out six more months or so, so I can work full time and pay off my student loans and save up some money.  That way, I won't be struggling to stay afloat in my own apartment.  It's a huge sacrifice, but I think long term it makes the most sense.  I may set up my own apartment downstairs.  It's pretty much a self contained apartment...that way it's not like I'm living with my parents.  Argh."

Shelley and I decided to go to the cinema tonight just to get out of the house.  I didn't want to see anything too heavy or depressing, so we decided to see Music and Lyrics.  It was really cute.  

So, I was driving down our road.  I saw a soldier talking to a lady in a car.  I thought that was strange, but I kept driving.  You always have to drive really slowly as we live out in the country, near a river...so there are always tons of deer around.  Well I got up to our driveway and I saw something moving by our mailbox.  It was thrashing around.  I stopped the car and turned on the highbeams.  I saw that it was a deer and that she couldn't really stand up.  I pulled in the driveway and woke up my mom to see what she thought.  I thought maybe I could call the Animal control people and maybe they could help it.  So, we got back in the car...thinking that maybe the people down the road were looking for the deer.  I pulled up so my mom could see.  She couldn't see her at all, because she wasn't wearing her glasses....but I could see her perfectly.  She was a really fluffy deer...kind of a greyish brown colour.  She was just laying there...breathing heavily.  She broke my heart and I started crying and crying.  I turned out of our driveway so I could go talk to the people down the road...maybe they didn't know that the deer was here and were looking for her.  As I turned I saw her baby .   He was lying in our driveway already dead.  I was hysterical at this point.  I drove to wear the soldier was and asked him if he was looking for the deer.  He said that somebody had hit her and that the police were coming.  I asked if he knew about the one that was alive by our fence.  He said they did...and that the police would help her when they got there.  

My mom and I went in the house, and I just kept crying.  My mom opened the from door when the police pulled up.  She said ""oh look, he's going to help her...look, between the trees, you can get a better view"".   

Then we heard four gunshots.  

So sad.  I wasn't expecting that tonight at all."

I resisted getting one for awhile, but then I realized it's a good way to keep in touch with my friends in Scotland.  

I was going to make a big pot of tea, but decided to go for the bottle of red wine.  

I feel much better (not because of the wine) because after speaking to my friend Rebekah, I realized that it is normal to have itchy feet after coming back to Canada.  She's in the exact same boat I am.  The only difference is that she has a teaching job, but she actually doesn't even like it.  It's easy to forget that your friends may be experiencing similar feelings.

So, I know I'm meant to be here right now for whatever reason.  I'm not going to make any drastic decisions...I got an email from Jen who advised me to just ""ride it out and see where life takes me"".  I liked that.  So, that's my plan.

I've been feeling such urgency to make plans and decisions, but there is no urgency.  These decisions will be here in three months or a year.  There's no rush.  And the good thing about teaching is that you can do it absolutely anywhere in the world at any time.

Okay, so why ask me how much I think I should make?  Anyway...she also said that the training is unpaid!!  My time is worth more than that....and because it's part time hours, I could only be working 2-3 hours/night.  It just seemed like Sylvan takes advantage of teachers.  They charge the parents 45.00/hour and the teachers (you HAVE to be certified to work there) only get 10?  I understand that it's tutoring, so there isn't any planning, or prep work. But I just found that to be strange.  So, I declined in the hopes that Oxford Learning centre will call me.  They have hours available during the day.  I would take the job at 10/hr if I was getting more hours...then it would be worth my while to drive all the way there...

It was such a beautiful, magnificent building...and I was so inside my head during it...that when I came out I couldn't talk.  I didn't want to talk.  I didn't want to take away from the experience of what I had just seen, so I spent some time alone.

That was how I felt leaving the Damien Rice show tonight at the Danforth Music Hall.  It was truly truly an experience that I have never had before.  I have never before heard someone sing their songs like it was the first time they had ever sung them.  He took his own songs and made them 100 times better than the CD (which I didn't know was possible).  He usually has a few people play with him, but tonight he was completely solo.  Just him, some guitars, a keyboard.  He was surrounded by candles and I wept when he played Cold Water.  

The best show I have seen in my life and I don't say that lightly.  Wow.  He played the Professor and I looked over and my brother was in tears.  I have never seen my brother cry before.  Nathan and Shelley both cried at different times throughout the show.  I was sad that it had to end."

"event","I spent the day driving everybody around today, beginning at 7:30AM and not stopping until 6:30.  I drove Josh, Shelley, mom to her dr. appointment, then to work, then took granny to her appointment in london.  Then picked everyone up. Blah.

I am sleepy.

I'm not sure what's happening with the party.  I spoke to Steve last night, and he's not sure either.  He isn't really free that much before I go.  He invited me up to Muskoka for a pub night, but that's a long way to drive for a few pints when he has to work the next day.  It would be nice though....just the two of us. 

I can't believe that I am going back to Glasgow in two weeks.  I have such mixed reviews about it.  I want to go back...I miss it, and staying here isn't doing much for me right now. I would get antsy if I stayed here too long.  

I have a lead on a full time job when I get back...until I start teaching that is.  I would be working with an Experiential Marketing company, doing promotions for EA Games.  I would get sent to events, etc...on business trips around the UK, promoting EA Games.  It sounds like a lot of fun. The lady that my sister works with...her daughter is hiring.  I should find out about it soon."

"event","It's been nice being home.  On Saturday, Josh, Shelley, Becca and I went to Olympic Island.  We got there a bit late, but we only missed Raising the Fawn, who I would have liked to see, but it wasn't to be.  

Feist was awesome...we met her afterwards because Shelley wanted to get her autograph.  She introduced us to her parents which was pretty funny.

Becca and I got up nice and close for BSS.  It was such a great show.  Apparently they sold it out this year.  I can't believe how well known they've become.  When I left that summer they weren't nearly this popular. Crazy how that happens.

So exhausted today.  I had a crazy dream.  I had a dream that I was at a family gathering, and I gave everyone a hug, but my dead 2nd cousin was there (she passed away last week at the age of 28!  Just out of the blue...a virus attacked her heart with no warning), and she wouldn't let me go.  She just kept hugging me and hugging me.  And then I got to my grandfather (who died a few years ago) and he did the same thing.  He just would not let me go.  It was so strange."

"event","So my parents arrived last week.  They've been entertaining themselves, taking trips, etc. while I've been finishing up my last few days of school.

Our graduation was yesterday.  It was lovely!  It was a short but sweet ceremony complete with wine and strawberry tarts on the lawn.  My parents were there, and they came out partying with us afterwards.  Steve was a sweetheart.  He spent most of the evening talking to my parents...chatting them up and telling them stories...some of which I wished he had not told them....(cheating, barfing, smoking, etc).  yeah, he painted himself out to be a good catch, but they actually love him.  They loved all my friends.  My parents PAID for everybody's dinner...all 15 of us.  AND bought us champagne.  That was so sweet of them. 

It's quite emotional because I can't believe the year is over.  Some of those people I may never see again, and I hate that thought.  The ones that matter, will be my friends for life, however, and I can't forget that. 

Afterwards we went to a pub and sat on a lawn for about 4 hours.  Then we were just so tired.  We went to Oran Mor, this old pub in a church, but we left after an hour because we were so tired.  

My parents surprised me with a trip.  I am now sitting at the Hilton hotel in FLORENCE!!!   It is absolutely beautiful.  It has a million different smells.  I love love love it here.  The art is incredible.  Tomorrow we go to the Ufizi gallery.  Today I had gelato and pizza and wine.  We strolled down the alleys listening to someone playing the cello.  It's surreal.  

Anyway...I am exhausted after three hours of sleep last night, and travelling all day today.  I am going to go upstairs and have a very hot bath, and then go to sleep."

"event","Slightly hungover today.  We started drinking yesterday at noon...and didn't stop until 3AM this morning.  Laura's boyfriend Greg...he just finished his five year engineering program along with his friends.  Kenny is so beautiful. Jen bet me that I wouldn't go sit beside him and talk to him (because he was with Ian who I made out with once), but I did...we had a proper chat and we shared a bottle of wine.  It was lovely.  

I woke up to Steve calling me.  I miss him...I haven't seen him in ages...he wanted us to go out to Helensburgh today, but I'm trying to talk him into coming into town first because its Shona's birthday.  I don't think he's going to.  

Tomorrow we'll go to Helensburgh.  

Tonight I guess we drink more."

"event","I went to the movies yesterday by myself.  I love doing that.  I am having this feeling lately where I love being single.  I am actually embracing it for the first time.  I haven't been single in a long time and I think its just taken me awhile to adjust to it.  I am even getting used to being a third wheel around my friends.  It just means that they care about me.  

Anyway...yesterday I took myself on a date to see the DaVinci code.  I don't get how its getting horrible reviews.  It's exactly like the book and everybody raved about the book.  If Ron Howard had done anything differently with it, critics would have complained about that.  I thought it was good...slightly predictable but then...so was the book.

I can't wait until Thursday.  This week is going to drag.   I have only 3 days left of this placement...the kids are being horrible and not listening to me at all.  And Angela is being strange.  She made me stay to do marking today just because she was planning for next week.  I could easily do my marking at home, but she didn't want me to leave ahead of her.  Strange..."

"event","Went out last night with Walker, Iseult, Doug, Jen, Laura, Shona and Rebekah.  It was a lovely evening.  We went out to the union and then to ABC.  It's always so much more fun when a group of people go out.

Laura and I had such a nice day today.  She really is a great friend.  We went out to look for dresses...Laura has a grad ball to go to and I want to find something to wear to our graduation.  So we tried on clothes, then went to look at new makeup.  We got lunch from Mark's and Spencer's (the best food ever) and then had a picnic outside.  It was delightful!

Now I am home and I think I am going to have a quiet night in.  I am going to give myself a pedicure...have a hot shower, get my pajamas on, have a glass of wine and watch a movie.  I haven't done that in ages."

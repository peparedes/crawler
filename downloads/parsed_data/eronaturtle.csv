"event","Just letting everyone know that yes, I still am alive.  I'm in the process of moving for the zillionth time, due to my stepdads mother dying in december, and his brother committing suicide last week.  So technically, no one owns the house, and my parents aren't going to step up and pay off the huge bills that the previous owners left them.  I'm also getting a new phone, with a new number, so anyone who wants the new cellie, comment/email/AIM (if I'm on) do whatever :-p and I'll let you know what it is.
In other news...
My car is *gasp* still working, my kitten is now a cat and doing fine, and my girlfriend is still stealing my DS games from me and won't let me play with her Wii ;)"

Also, it says there's a ""Keyboard error""  on the boot screen before the OS loads.  Also, I get the blue screen of death every once in a while when the computer actually goes on.  It only comes up for 1 second, so I can't read it.  I think it's a driver error, but I don't know which one it is.  I know I need to do a reinstall of Windows on there (unfortunately) but I was wondering if anyone knew of a way to at least power it on long enough for me to get my files off the hard drive and back up the last months stuff."

She laughs and says ""I just wanted to say I think you're really cute, and we should hook up sometime""

I asked her if this was a prank or someone I knew playing a joke on me, and she sounded sincere in refuting my doubts.  So, I gave her my cell number.  I mean, what's the worst that can happen?

We will, however, use your resume as the basis for comparison for all other applicants. But, we're going to hire somebody who is far less qualified and is probably an alcoholic.

TODAY!!!!TODAY was awsome!!! ok not really just tons better then yestuday.Okay well first of all i dont wanna tell u about all my classes so ill just tell you about all the kool stuff.Okay in science we all got assigned seats so i sit behind roman and diagnaly from this dude that my freinds think are hott (im not egsactly sure yet) BUT ANYWAY its awsome i get to sit near roman (hottie) Then in drama we had to make up a song wiht a rule and another song already made up for ex (our song was 3blind mice and ourrule was stay in ur seat)so our song is all (stay in your seat, stay in your seat or you'll get beat....etc) lol ya something like that but it was pretty kool (YES FINALLY COMMUNICATION DURING CLASS!!!!!)lol so today was lots cooler.

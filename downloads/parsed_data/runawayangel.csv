"event","Well I have ALOT of stuff to cover...I got to stay at Thomas's for a week and 2 days. That was the best time I had EVER had with anyone!! I miss him alot..For Christmas he got me beautiful earrings from Tiffany's they are silver and their called the circle of eternity...he got me a white teddy bear and I named it the 5th cause Thomas is the forth, insences from New orleans and Some Mardi Gras beads!!! I was so excited!!! I abs. loved it all :-D Thanks sweetie :). I had the best time though. I miss him alot its kind of like missing a piece of ur self :( I feel like hes my half I've been missing

Concerns:

I'm afraid we are going to get to serious and ruin our relationship. I love him more then I love or loved anyone in my whole life and I'ms cared that one day things will get way to serious..and we'll break up :( thats why I'm going to low down a bit and not talk about the future so much...yes I would love to grow up and go to college together and be roomates but thats a ways away and I dont want to scare him into a long term relationship. I love him more then I love myself and I dont want to screw anything up..I dont want to end up acting like we were married and something go wrong..and I'm trying to make it to where I dont get to serious on him...get what I'm saying? I love him and  dont want to lose him over something like that. I lvoe having him as my best friend...I honestly can tell him anything and he always fixes it or makes me feel better. It makes me cry to think about that he just cuddled up against me while i was sleeping and listened to me breath...I have NEVER had that b4 I'm so grateful for God bringing us together. Hes the best thing that has ever happened to me. I seriously cant think of another relationship that I hav eever been truly happy in..he respects me and thats the best thing and the most important thing..he doesnt hurt me on purpose and he always puts me b4 him. I'm just really scared that one day soemthing will happen and all my joy and happiness will fade away. I know that if something goes wrong I can say I have my dream come true...I've been loved by someone that truly cared about me and my feelings and that was my best friend and wasnt with me just cause he thought I was pretty...that he was with me b/c he truly loves me no matter what. I never thought I would ever say this...this relationship is a dream come true...

Thomas, I love you with all of my heart and soul...please always remember that :)"

"event","I dont know ne more.. I just dont know..I spent the weekend at Thomas's house..it was amazing..I had so much fun

Friday- I got there and looked allllll over for Thomas..finally found him but then he had to bring me back cause *lol* he had to bring augusto back and he didnt have any room for me :( but then he came back and got me and all was well..I had to judge first, second and third round..Thomas got a fort. so he came and chilled with me which made me happy. Then we left there and went out to eat at Applebees..then went to his house and I met his mommy..shes so sweet! then he ""showed"" me my room LMAO and then we cuddled until umm about 3:30 it was so nice and made me soooo happyy!!!

Saturday-- Well Thomas's mommy came and woke me up.. and I got up and took a shower and got ready..I didnt have to judge 4th round (thanks to Seth) so I got to be with Thomas..then I judged 5th round and as soon as i opened up the door to leave Thomas was right there it was really cute..went to blimpies got some subs (yummy) and waited on breaks to come out..Went in to the first one it was Vestiva vs Fayette...one of the judges was from houston co. and he really upset me..(thomas doesnt know this) he kept talking about how Elizabeth (Thomas's ex) missed him and that made me feel like I wanted to get up and walk out..but I didnt..I just sat there and didnt listen..so ne ways that round was over then we had another break round..go through that one..it was Columbus vs. Fay..bad round but ne ways..then we and Thomas went off and disappeared for awhile it was really nice to be away from everyone and have him all to myself. So ne ways then we went and cleaned up and left and got pizza for Bracknell. Then  went back to his house..*stopping here*

Sunday...woke up about 9ish..Thomas's mom cooked breakfast and I went and woke him up (nice suprise uh?) we got up ate breakfast..they showed me the backyard...it was really pretty. then we took showers got dressed and went and saw Harry Potter with his mommy, Courtney, and Cam. It was kewl. Then we went back to Thomas's house (and my mom was there waiting on me :()so we stayd and ate dinner..then I had to leave..*cries* so that brings me to now.. I love him and I miss him sooooooooooooo much and it hurts alot cause I cant be with him...is it worth all this pain to stay together or should we break up? I lvoe him and I want to stay with him for forever BUT it hurts... All I want is to live where he lives then we would have the perfect relationship"

2nd block- We had a sub and had to read Julius Casear..ugh to complicating *lol* j/k me and Kristen chilled and talked for a while..then we watched a movie but me and half the class slept through it! It was great.

3rd block-- Debate, I talked to mrs.r for a while and then i broke down crying..Today was my breaking point! I was just sitting there on top of a desk with david and I layed my head on his shoulder..and i burst in to tears..he didnt know whether to hug me or to freak *lol* so I cried and now I'm fine. I just needed to realize some stress...cause I know alot of ppl have noticed that I had a bad week! I feel bad for likeing putting my problems on other ppl but I just couldnt hold back ne more. I guess to being overwhelmed with Thomas and my grandfather dieing and us winning JV.. that my emotions got out of whack...but whatever good thing is that I'm fine now!

"event","This weekend was great. I got to spend time with my babe Thomas! It was great! I miss him already and I wont see him till my mommy takes me to Carrollton to see him. The more I fall for him the harder the distance gets. But it would be a lot worse to be without then to be hurt by distance. Well ne ways..Me and Elissa broke we were second team going into Octos. I wish we would have broke to Semis instead of Octos but ne ways.. we went against Pace first round. We spanked them..the judge said we were to good to be running JV that we needed to move up. so ne ways we hit Lakeside next and beat them on some BS. We should have went for T but oo well...then we were going debate Lakeside but the forfeited so we got Co-Champions..are record was 7-1 should have been 8-0 but oo well it balanced out..Elissa to a speaker award also... 3rd place! I'm so proud of her she deserved it. WE took our first tourn. I was so happy..Thomas dropped in Semis to a team he had already beat I feel so bad for him. He got his all state bid at NS though but he wanted another one. I hope he gets it to. Hes a very good debater. He deserves it..It was so funny we were walking down the hallway holding hands and Bracknell yells at Thomas ""keep ur hands where they belong!' It was hillarious! Columbus shares Co-Champions with us! :-D Here is a run down of our rounds

I know we hit Lakeside(won), Lakeside(lost), Columbus (won), Douglasville (won), and TCC (won)

Then in breaks we hit Pace running dealert (won) then hit Lakeside running North Korea agreement (won), then we were going to hit lakeside again but they forfeited"

I'm so scared of having a LD relationship..I cant wait for Friday cause I'll be with him and all my worries will disappear. Just talking to him on the phone or on AIM makes me so happy.

He treates me like a Queen. I'm so glad we found each other and that we are together.

"event","ok - update needed! to start off - I MISS EVERYONE SO FUCKING MUCH! marist as a school sucks but i love my friends up here and i'm going to miss them so much when i graduate.  lynda and i are officially over - thank god.  the  bitch has no clue what a relationship means. jeff and i are on a break and apparently i have SINGLE tattooed on my forhead b/c i have had soooooo many guys ask me out.  said yes to few - hey, y'all know how picky i am.  

lets see.................i am now working at probation in a special units program - sex offenders.  its so frustrating.  the big joke in the department is that in this county you can rape your daughter and get away with it with a slap on the wrist but sell 20 dollars of crack to someone and get thrown in prison for 1 to 3.  

ok - off that topic - i'm getting agitated! i am scared to graduate and enter the REAL world. its life i guess. 

i miss my sister soooooo much.  i need her here with me.  she makes everything better and forces me to see things in a different and usually correct light - i guess kristina will have to do for a little while.

two friends of mine - one really great one up here and aaron - are going to be daddy's - seriouslyscary.  they'll both make great daddy's but are they ready? my cousins now husband was deployed to Irac, my best friend will reenlisted in the marines, another Great friend of mine got deployed - its all so fucking frightening.  

anywho - i konw that this jumped around and only touched on a few things - for those who care to know more taht don't already - drop me a line - i miss you all!! 845-527-8763

love you all"

"event","god its been too long and for that i apologize!! things in my life have continued to be chaotic.  i failed at my goal of a 4.0 for the semester adn ended up with a 3.9 which was truly discouraging. xmas was great except for the fact that i was away from my daddy and that crew as well as my mom's side of the family.  i also missed the colby x-mas party, a party that i have always attened without fail so that was tough.  jeff was with me in switzerland and i was gratful for his presence.  new years was also a blast however i drank too much too soon and by 130 i was attempting to pass out and avoid throwing up.  this past weekend was hard.  you all know the kind of person that i am and how bitchy i can be, its nearly impossible for me not to be a bitch.  my mom's boyfriends kids came into town and the words rude and ill-mannered does not even begin to describe them (mainly the daughter, sonya)however, that is an awfully long and very detailed story and needs to be written later. 

i'm at work now, if you can call it that and i'm bored as hell.  i will write more later mainly detailing the past weekend, my girlfriend and the issues surrounding that, my up and coming frightening internship, along with many other stories and issues that i need to vent about.  

love to all!!

Scud - i'll see you on FRIDAY!! (and i'll call you today sometime!)"

"event","i've had an interesting last few days.  got in a fight with kristina about her driving herself home on thursday (she was trashed).  i had to go and get her keys from lynda (who i havn't really spoken to since haloween) and i immediatly got attitude from her and christa when i walked in the door.  then i had a guy we know follow us as i drove kristina in her car and then he drove me back to my car after we dropped her off. to tell you the truth = i was very nervous.  this guy is a bar friend.  a guy that we hang out with at Noah's, i don't even know his last name.  as i'm drving her home she's yelling at me asking me why i care and who's to say that she won't drive anywhere after i drop her off.  i then screamed back that i had no idea why i cared so much, especailly at that moment but i did.  we havn't spoken this weekend.  i needed some time to cool off.  

my roommate is home for the weekend and it was nice to have the room to myself, but i miss her.  we're coming up on the one year anniversery of the inccident (her rape) and i'm open for ideas about what to do. meghan and i had an idea about just having a girls day/night (movies, junk food, drinks!!) but i want to do something special for her w/out celebrating the day (there is no need to celebrate that awful day). 

jeff and i are doing a little better.  we had date night last night and it was great.  movies, drinks, pizza.  i called off another date (with jay) for him, he was happy.  i'm not his girlfriend, but i'm trying.  we got our tatoo yesterday - it looks amazing.  its my last one - a little sad.  i promised myself only three - so now i'm done.  

its time to get back to work - that 4.0 is looking better adn harder as the semester goes on.  

love to all."

"event","this past week has been eventful to say the least.  i am so exhausted, mentally and physically.  one of my best friends (i just realized that is the first time i called her that) kristina is dealing with a lot right now.  she's the kind of person that pushes things under the carpet and when it gets full she moves to another room (another carpet) and now there's no rooms left.  also one of her best friends, and a friend of mine (to those of you who were around my freshmen year of college - its the girl who beat up maeve at the end of the year) was sexually assaulted and is now threatening suicide.  its all really hard.  i've also spent the last few weeks stressing about school (i set goals that are uneasonably high) and spending most of my time in the library.  

i'm still single, however, jeff and i are talking.  i want so badly to work through all of this but i don't know how to.  i havn't even begun to deal with will yet - another thing that's hanging over my head.  i keep telling kristina that she is a strong person who can deal with anything that comes her way - i wish i could turn my advice towards me."

"event","so - i was in the library trying to get all of my shit done and i was asked to leave b/c for some bizarre reason the library closes early on sat. nights (probably b/c there aren't any other losers in this school that spend their sat. nights in the library).  so....i come back to my room and was immediatly reminded of why i went to the library - i am now sharing a room with romeo and fucking juliet.  i can't get work done now b/c they have to watch some stupid ass movie now and i have no where else to go and get this shit done. AHHHHH!!! maybe i'll just go out a drink. (i'm sure jay isn't busy - oh yeah - havn't talked about him yet - later when i'm not as pissed)

"event","still heartbroken, still stressed, and still missing my friends - but i'm managing.  i talk to scud butt today (god i miss her) and realized as i was telling the story of thursday night again (and to someone who really makes me think about what i'm saying) i'm realizing just how hurt i am.  i'm not sure if i'll ever be able to put all of the pieces of my broken heart together again (humpty dumpty sat on a wall....)  but i am willing to try b/c jeff is the man that i want to be with.  its just going to take a lot of time to heal.  have i told him this yet - no.  i think i went right to sad and heartbroken and completely skipped the whole pissed off and angry stage - its time for me to enter that stage of feeling.  i'm pissed at lynda more than i realized before last night (i went to the bar with christina and we both bitched about lynda - we both have individual issues with her but they are relatively the same) and i am truly pissed at jeff for not moving her hand away and for shoving me.  

i am so afraid that i am going to disrespect myself for breaking the promise i made.  after gary and john (the hyena laugher who liked to take his frustrations out on my family physically) i swore to myself that i would never again put myself in a situation with someone who hurts me - and the question remains - is jeff one of those guys??"

quick update - i promise a longer entry later.......lynda and i are aparently fighting (i hurt her in some way - i think), jeff and i are good (still apart), there is drama in my house (hey - does my life ever contain anything else), my car is beautiful, my sister is amazing (i couldn't imagine how my life would be without her), and school is slowly killing me.  i miss my friends (brian - i owe you a phone call - i've been sooooooo busy) (Jimmy may not be in geneva when i get home) and i miss having free time - i don't even know what that is anymore. there are MAJOR concerns about my bro and his life at school (i couldn't bear to live one moment without him). 

i feel like i'm in this limbo period of my life - things are about to change in the most drastic way i've ever known and i haven't decided if it's going to be bad or good.  i feel like i'm slowly losing friends i once had and gaining the most drasticaly different group of people as other friends.  

angela - i just got your email - pls. don't think that i am for one second ignoring it - adn don't assume that ""we"" (your friends) are only there for you when you need help - we are ALWAYS here (i can speak for myself - not sure about the rest of them).  i love you.  call me later?

this past weekend was amazing!! i got home (DC) thursday night and i was greeted with the image of my NEW CAR (a BMW) - my daddy is great! then i walked in the door and was greeted by my loving dog moonie.  sadly my brother was sick and is still recovering, so that was hard to see.  my step mom and my sister joined me at chilli's for margaritas and then i went to bed trashed (this is becoming a habit for me).  friday night was filled with some exotic drink that i can never remember, in DC.  sat. was eventful to say the least.  emmy, kay and i woke up a little hung over and went to Five Guys for some recovery food and then on to shopping (i think my step-mom has a serious shopping problem:) ) we did finally get emmy all of the odds and ends that she was in need of for the ball - i really wish that i could be there to see her off. then kay and i headed down to old town where i proceeded to get my hair chopped off - 6 inches.  but it looks ok.  sat night was la placetas night to see ivan and drink margaritas and eat la placetas salad. we all went: kay, emmy, jane (my step mom's best friend and my third mom), matt, katie, and tre. i met this really cute airforce guy, david, who is going to help me figure things out for when i sign up.  we made indefinite plans for sunday but they fell through. then off to a bar on Penn. Ave. there were wall to wall hot marines (yes - i think it is the idea of the uniform).  when we got there i immediately went upstairs to the club part - i forgot how much i miss DC clubs. there was no one dancing but i somehow convinced everyone upstairs in the club to dance - a side of my that my step mom has never seen.  it was a huge ego booster - a lot of the guys asked for my number and got a little upset when i said ""lets just dance and have fun"" (two of them had hard-ons). i taught my stepmom, jane, and emmy the well known stripper move and i was having a blast!!  i think one of the guys took the fact that i wasn't into hooking up with them too hard and ""lemon dropped"" me (a cheap form of roufies).  the drug hit me as i was walking with my sister to the car. suddenly i couldn't see straight (my eyes felt like they were moving back and forth a 100 miles and hour) and i felt really shaky (like i had had about 12 pitchers of coffee) driving home was interesting.  there were cops everywhere - mostly b/c there was another shooting and i don't know quite how i got home. when i was home i threw up for hours after only having five drinks - those of you of who really know me knows that i can easily have ten drinks over the course of five hours and dancing and not feel it.  it was freaky.  

i'm fine now - a little shaken up - but i'm ok.  

today should be interesting.  i have an endless amt. of shit to get done, and tonight its a girls night out with lynda and christina.  (there are current fears that christina is contemplating suicide) but lynda wants to spend time with me b/c she ""misses me"". i'm so tired and all i want to do is crawl back into bed and not wake up for a year or so.  

love to all!!"

"event","i'm BROKE!! this is not an exaggeration - i am seriously broke.  i have been this strapped for cash before but not for awhile.  it is nearly impossible to get used to having money and then having to deal with the HUGE hole in the wallet.  i've tried getting jobs - and i have one - but i only work an average of two or three shifts a week - there are about a million girls that work for express.  i miss having money - I HATE THIS SHIT!!  

the brokness aside - i really did have a great weekend.  my one year anniversary was friday (10/4) and he couldn't have made it any more perfect.  we were both suppose to work on sat. for this photographer anna lebowitz but it fell through so we decided to go down to the city.  it was unforgettable.  we went to a bar (now our favorite) in washington square/ greenwich village and watched the yankee game in a bar filled with yankee's biggest fans.  they lost the game and later that night jeff lost his lunch - it was priceless.  walking around the city getting back to our hotel - i was drunk and jeff was obliterated.  i have no idea how we did it.  when we got back to the hotel - jeff threw up - everywhere.  i love that boy - the entire time he was puking he was apologizing and telling me that he loved me.  it was awesome.  

more later - i have a million things to get done - wish me luck.

my one year aniversery is this friday - i'm terrified.  every other relationship that i have reached the one year mark in has failed.  i truly don't want this one to fail.  i have never in my life experienced such a wonderful relationship.  if my only problem with jeff is that he refuses to fight with me - i honesly consider myself to be lucky.  its just - i dunno.  after gary and i hit a year it went even more down hill - if thats possible and after joey and i hit a year - i nearly doubled my number of sexual partners (bad sign in a relationship).  i dont' want anything to go wrong btn. jeff and i.

"event","so....at school, besides jeff, i have two serious best friends - my roommate emily and  my housemate meg.  i have friends and acquantances(too tired to spell that) but those two girls are my wld. up here. not anymore - meg and i aren't speaking and i'm a little confused as to why. it is a very long drawn out story but to sum it up quickly - comments by her were made about taking a shower (by the way - it should be noted that i had been sick for a long time) and how it made her late - cursing was involved.  so - i was pissed then days later, after i got out of the hospital, she decides to come in a FINALLY ask me how i am - i mumble some shit off and she closed the door.  the next day - we have the same math class - she ignores me like an immature child and hasn't spoken to me since - its been a few days.  i swallowed my pride (for those of you who know me well - that was nearly impossible) and IMed her - told her to tell me when she has a min. to let me know - days later she still hasn't.  now we don't speak, barley look at each other, and whenever i walk into a room she leaves.  i need advice.  normally i would say fuck it (or as my loving sis said - just punch her) but i can't - i don't want to give up on our friendship.  one more thing - i think she overheard a conversation where i was running my mouth - lets just say - there weren't any nice things coming out of my mouth.  i need help.

other than that - i guess i'm ok - i can not wait to be back in dc = permanently!! i hate poughkeepsie, if it was the city i'd be fine - but its not - it sucks!! i miss my friends, but coming back to dc means that i'm an adult and i have to deal with a whole bunch of responsibilities.  scary shit!!

if anyone has any advice about my housemate - or an idea of what to get jeff for our one year aniver. - let me know.

"event","i sitting in my room waiting for jeff to arrive with food and drink - and realizing that i am not keeping up with the promise i made to myself that i would write as often as i could.  i just get so distracted (i've always thought i had ADD but i've also realized, and come to terms with, the fact that i am extremely lazy).  i miss my best friend - who is in london as well as the one in GA. i hate that i am so far away from my friends.  my mom left yesterday to head back home and it was horrible - luckily i had jeff with me to keep me calm.  seeing how emmy already explained the jewelry inccident i don't have to go into it - all i have to say is that it seriously sucks!

i just went over all of the work that is expected of me for my capping course - it is seriously scary.  i have no idea how i am going to get everything done.  i want a 4.0 and that idea is looking bleaker and bleaker.  

for all of those who don't know yet - i have finally decided my life goals (subject to change based on the fact that i always change my mind) - Air Force after graduation, DC cop, and FBI when i turn 28 (reason - i did drugs and i have to wait ten years). now this could all change if i decide to open my own bar in dc - you never know.  

love to all - please know that i miss you all!!!!"

"event","i'm sitting in class right now - searching for something to do............i'm tre bored!! i'm leaving to go to VA today after my first two classes - it's going to be really wierd not having scud's silly ass around to chill with.  i'm starting to believe that i have a really shitty habbit of taking advantage of what is around me and who is near me. for all of those who have been effected by my lack of acknowledment - i apologize.

yesterday was 9-11 - and after all that i went through that day - with my dad, mom, kay, driving past the pentagon two mins. before the plane came down, will, not knowing how to get anywhere (the roads were closed) - i still didn't feel the need to attend the candle light vigal that was led by my school.  how ever shitty this sounds - 9-11 was a minor (and yes shitty) distraction from what i was dealing with with scud and the death of her mom - so i dealt with it all later - on my own. one of my roommates felt the need to sulk around all day about that afwul day. she didn't even lose anyone - and i understand that she felt the need to think about all of those who were lost - but damn don't make me feel guilty about not going to the vigal.  i honestly believe that she's the kind of person who psychs herself into believing that she was really there or really lost someone.  it may be b/c she hasn't had any major tragedy in her life so this is her substitute.  i dunno.

yesterday after a huge scare about my mom's plane (thanks to em - who didn't call me when she landed), a NICE (and tiring) visit with jeff (whoo hoo! go me!), and massive amounts of homework - i am struggling to stay awake in class - wish me luck!!

love to all!!"

"event","well i just got back from talking to my boss - i still have a job but b/c of her fucking errors i'm on probabtion - my luck lately has not been very good - ughh!!

i went to my express interview today and this really cute girl - the manager (dude she's only 21) basically offered me a job - she's going to call me tonight - only down side - it starts at 6.9 an hour.  oh well, money is money. at this rate i may have to resort to stripping - i hate not having daddy's credit card like most of the students at marist.  

i have a question for all of those who live in DC - are we all synical??

more later - and heather - i promise to try and keep up the long entries!!

*ang - love you too!!"

"event","well - i just got back from work - bartending at lil sue's.  right now i feel like i felt the night that i got fired from excaliber. again - i know that i haven't done anything wrong but i feel like i have.  the night was slow - and they didn't buy very much - so now my boss thinks i did something wrong - what? i have no idea.  almost the exact same senario at my old bar.  my luck hasn't been great and it sucks.  my last boss fired me and hired someone who would sleep with him - the links (for those of you who don't know is the country club that i bartended at) basically let me go b/c he got someone better looking.  i can't lose this job - i need the money.  

aside from the job shit - i miss everyone.  i miss my sister who is five states away, along with my dad and little bro - who became a teenager today - well monday - and i wasn't able to be there.  my best friend is moving out of the country which means its going to be that much harder to see her and my other best friend lives in georgia and i never get to see him or dance with him (he's my life long dance partner). jeff and i are great but i miss the newness - meg may have been right about me staying with him for the summer - which scares me to death.  my mother is across the ocean and i would give anything to have her near me.  i never thought i would miss her this much.  the turd she's dating is just that - a turd. don't get me wrong - i am thrilled that she's happy but she's turned into a ""we"" person - ""we"" liked the movie, ""we"" don't enjoy that restuarant.  she has always been such an independant woman, a woman that i have always looked up to (and still do) its just that i don't like seeing her like this. 

i find out tomorrow - well later today - what went wrong with the tape at work - which means tomorrow i find out how distressed my bank account will be in the next few weeks. i have two interviews set up this week - one with express (angela will dig that store discount) and the other with american eagle (jeff and i will love that discount) but both are retail and i seriously hate that shit - but what are you going to do when everything in this materialistic driven country requires your bank account to be able to handle the quickly changing styles of the world.  

i know that it may not be proper journal edikit (i have no idea how to spell that shit) to bitch on the first entry - but i need to and everyone that i could bitch to is asleep.

i'm watching one of my secretly favorite movies - renaissance man - with danny divito - who makes me laugh just based on the way he looks. but its not helping.  not even marky mark who is also in this movie is cheering me up. this shit sucks man

good night to all"

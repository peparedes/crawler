In other news... I WON A FREE iPOD MINI! And no this isn't one of those pyramid schemes, it was a real contest run by Papermate. That's right, a pen company is giving away not one, but 457 iPods. They're having a daily drawing for one, and I figured ""who goes to a pen website? "" So I entered every day for about a month, and sure enough, A Winner Is Me!

At ShopRite I FINALLY get to do some fun work. Starting Friday, I get to work in the office and use the computers to type stuff up. Work that is fun!

So yeah, nothing else new on the gaming front. Nothing on Revolution or Zelda...

DAMN YOU NINTENDO!"

I went to lake george a week/2 weeks (I forget by now) ago and had fun. I found a big bag of tickets then beat the system at a machine to net 1200 tickets within 3 days and 10 bucks. I got a bunch of stuff like a Homer Simpson plushie, a lake george mug, and 100 real poker chips. I also got Kirby Canvas Curse for the DS before leaving. That game is freakin' awesome! Controlling Kirby with the stylus works like a dream. Especially when you can lead him right into lava (http://www.vgcats.com/comics/?strip_id=152)!

In other news, I met another bitchy customer at Shoprite! I was off duty (my apron was behind my back and reversed as a sign) and getting ice cream before going home. I din't see Tin Roof Sundae and went into the back and found someone to help me. As I came out from the back with mine and a few extras for the shelf, some woman asked me to get her regular chocolate. It seemed obvious that I was off duty seeing as I wasn't wearing my apron as a regular employee would. Out of curtosy though I went to look for the guy who helped me before but couldn't. When I came back the woman just went balistic about how I got my flavor and not hers. She then asked for a manager after again asking for me to just get it. I couldn't understand how she couldn't comprehend how I'm not responsible for helping her through the store even after I told her I'm off the clock. I tried to find the guy for her as a customer helping a customer, and I found the guy the first time as a customer getting help from an employee. No matter how many times I (and my father) explained to her I'm off the clock and not working she kept acting like I'm an employee 24/7 and had to help her regardless of my schedule. These are the kinds of people we need removed from the Earth. People lacking common sense and rational thought.

And there's my rant for the time being. Working 6 days in a row (I hate the computer at Shoprite) has been getting on my nerves latley, but now I have a Saturday off to relax..."

"event","Well school's finally officially over for the year. I'm a little uneasy about the Physics test (We all agreed it was a pain in the ass) but I'm sure I at least passed. Time for another 2 months of relaxation before 10 months of more agony and then freedom from controlled school in the confines of Hicksville.


I got Kirby Canvas Curse today and it is awesome. It's the first DS game that shows what the DS can really do that's not an expanded tech demo. I'm glad Nintendo can put out great games such as this. 

On a side note I saw Spaceballs today.

Best.
Parody Movie.
Ever.

I'm not kidding. For so many gag refrences and just overall gags, the movie delievers grade A comedy gold. Go see it NOW!

And on another side note I borrowed a DVD of Batman TAS. This show was so awesome when it was on WB 11. I miss it so much. There's so much drama which added to the show more than the disgrace that is ""The Batman."" They just don't make animated shows like they used to..."

"event","I didn't feel at all well today. I tried working at Shoprite, but I was on the verge of collapsing after every order. I went home and went from bad to worse to better. Hopefully I'll be fine for tomorrow's shift.

And on a completley unrelated side note (and I need a place to hotlink), here's a link to the trailer for The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess. This game will be GOTY without any contest.

"event","Well this will be my first real entry now that I have everything set up (more or less). No sense in describing my life story, so just today then.

I had my first half of my English regents today. Mostly easy, but annoying. The first essay was on some lady who beat the ""Around the World in 80 Days"" record and the second was on pedestrian saftey of all things. Hopefully the third and fourth essays will have something more reasonable or interesting to them.

I went to beat Zelda: Ocarina of Time Master Quest again, but remembered I restarted my file a few months ago. Oh well, OoT is always a fun game to play through. Twilight Princess will own its soul though. *Sigh* October/November can't come any sooner...

I guess thats it for now then."

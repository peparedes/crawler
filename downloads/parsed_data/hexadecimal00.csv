Riese: Kingdom Falling

The concept is a fantasy standard, royal relative overthrows royal family, slaughters royal family , the solitary survivor is a princess, princess is being chased by evil people yaddda yadda yadda. It doesn't stand out in any particular way in terms of plot. And I can't say I'm infatuated. I will however say that I do like the steam punk cyborgs. Yes, that is the only way I can think of to discribe them and they're diconcerting and cool. They also make creepy sounds when they move or scream which is a plus. The internal politics and the religious sect that is in the mix does make things interesting. I do like the visual they're attempting with the costume designs. One thing that bothered me is the voice over. Voice over's are not necessarily bad, they offer a lot of quick explanations so can be useful, there was just too much. Half the plot and back story was explained in several VOs and that amount of telling rather than showing tends to take away my ability to get into the show they do get points for using Amanda Tapping. My overall response to the first episode is muh.


The Killing

The Pilot, The Cage & 

When this was initially advertised and the tag line they were using is who killed Rosie Larsen I had this fleeting flash of hope that there would be someone with an eye patch and a talking log. Alas, so far, no eye patch and no talking log. It has been however fairly interesting. It's a slow moving murder mystery so far and does some very interesting character focus. I like the lead female cop, Sarah. She's not exactly beautiful but she is intersting looking. She's smart and seems competent. The former narc kind of makes me leary. He's a little creepy but I admit he is decent at what he does. It definitely doesn't feel like most of the procedural dramas on TV right now. It reminds me of a show but I can't put my finger on which one. I think I will continue to watch and form an opinion."

"event","Yes, I know, I'm far, far behind. I have to say this, I love this show. It's hilarious. It took me the entire first season to determine my favourite character and finally, I've decided...

I WANT PARKER TO BE MY BEST FRIEND FOREVER! &hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;


Now, this isn't to say that I don't love Nate, I do. He's an evil super genius thatI believe <i>could</i> take over the world with a con. This fact alone makes me approve of him. 

Sophie amuses the crap out of me simply because she can be <i>anyone</i> during a con but couldn't act her way out of a paper bag on stage.

Hardison <strike>is hot and no, I'm not superficial.</strike> gives me geek happiness. Between the gaming jokes, the Star Wars references and the general technology whoring, I want to eat him.

Eliot is a man with pretty hair that kicks the crap out of people. How can I not want him as my man pet? He needs a collar. :D I want him to massage my feet and then I want to brush his hair. Yes, I have messed up priorities. Sue me. <small>Oh my, the man candy!</small>

Despite all of this, I still love Parker best. Why? Because she is bat shit insane and she makes me happy. She is ridiculous and strange and lives in her own bizarre little world. She is flat out great. I'm in love with this show. &hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;"

"event","You know, going into the Habs vs Caps game last night, I was a little indifferent (Nearly six years in the Okanagan has officially turned me into a Canucks fan.) but DAMN that was worth watching. First two minutes of the game and its tied 1-1? That's nuts! :D

Ovechkin spent most of the game just flat out shut down, which in and of itself was fun to watch even if I have a small he-looks-like-a-Russian-thug crush on him. And ninth straight win for the Caps. Impressive.

The Habs, despite losing, played a decent game. They lost control of the puck more often than they should have in the third, probably due to fatigue, but Carey Price played really well. That boy can read a puck. Yes, he let in four goals, but the Caps had 41 shots on goal. Some of which just shouldn't have happened. There were a few bad turnovers *cough*TravisMoen*cough* and really, the Habs are going to need to get it together a little better if they're going to make it past the first round. I know they've been hit hard by injury, but so has everyone else. I really hope they make it. 

I would talk about Carl Johansson, but really, what is there to say? He's awesome and the league is already cooing over him, so I won't bother. Instead, let us discuss John Carlson. The kid is going to be a <i>monster</i>. He's going to be dangerous as a defencemen. You can already see it. Chirst, I'd love to see him play for the Canucks... but that's just me. He plays fairly aggressive off the blue line and he moves well. A few years and he'll be a high priced defencemen, I'm sure.

I just realized something looking at the Caps roster, 17 out of 27 players are Canadian. Holy crap, we're invading Washington. XD

I'd also like to point out that the ads on NHL.com are starting to piss me off. It's annoying as all hell to try to watch a 15 second clips and get 45 seconds of commercials first.

11 more games until the playoffs. WOOT!"

Here's mine:

Quatre found himself moving slowly to the gentle regular beat. Schubert. The hands at his sides twitched. The left taking position, moving in seemingly random patterns, pressing into imaginary strings. The right flexing, aching for the weight and shape of a bow, the feel of the back and forth that made song.

Without thought, Quatre's upper body shifted, his shoulder moved and his chin dropped. He could almost feel it, his violin. He let himself have the moment. That instant in time where he steeped himself in longing and he resented the high rise office. A prison of glass and concrete. A prison in which a violin did not fit.

The door dinged and he stepped off, the moment gone. He made his way nodding and greeting as he had to. Safe in his office, he tucked himself into his computer and began his work. After a minute or two, the want for his violin still running through him, Quatre clicked on his music files. Holst. And The Planets spun through his office.

Quatre sank into the music, the joy of the listener, not the player still within his grasp."

"event","I am looking after my nieces and my nephew this weekend while my sister and her husband go to a ringette coaching clinic. Now, my youngest niece is a klutz. She always manages to get hurt. Yesterday she managed to lose her two front teeth in the most bizarre way possible and make my culpable all in one swoop.

I was going up the stairs with my nephew who is about a year and a half. My niece came up behind me and launched herself at me. She smacked her face on my backside and caught her wiggly front teeth (which were loose due to taking a hit to the face during gymnastics this past week) on the back pocket of my jeans. Both came out. 

So there I was on the stairs with my toddler nephew and a bleeding, giggly (yes, she was giggling madly as I tried to figure out where her teeth were. Checking my pockets were her suggestion.) six year old checking the pockets of my jeans to make sure I wasn't going to sit on her baby teeth. And still my knee jerk reaction was, ""Go tell your mom that all you want for Christmas is your two front teeth.""

My sister laughed and told me I still had to baby sit, even if I did make her kids bleed."

"event","Tonight, Travis, Darcie and I all decided we wanted to watch a movie. After a little deliberation we decided on the new Robin Hood starring Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett. I admit it was nothing spectacular, although I did enjoy the portrayal of Marion. What had my attention, fairly early into the movie was the singing voice of Alan A'Dayle.  

Me knee jerk reaction was ""That guy <i>really</i> sounds like Alan from Great Big Sea."" 

Because I am an IMDB junkie, I love Great Big Sea and I was really, really curious as to who this guy was, that sounded so much like Alan, I looked it up. This is what I found out: 

<big>IT <i>IS</i> ALAN DOYLE FROM GREAT BIG SEA?!?!?!</big>

Now, as soon as I read that online I had a minor fit of disbelief and spent the rest of the movie giggling myself shitless instead of taking it even remotely seriously. It wasn't as if he had a large amount of lines or was important to plot at all. The bits he was in were fine. I just found it extremely distracting. AND HILARIOUS! 

It also explained why during one of the scenes while he's singing, I had the overwhelming urge to start singing a Great Big Sea song.

I just - just - I don't have the words to describe the way I feel about it. I just thought my Flist should know he's in that movie so those that are GBS fans can experience that same sense of WTF vertigo that I did. Sharing is caring."

Also, Jonas Hiller looks like he's twelve despite the fact that he's only a year younger than me. I find this irritating. Here, look at him:

He <i>is</i> absolutely adorable I grant you but he still looks like a freaking tween. Which makes me feel old.

"event","To start things off, I've quit my job and I'm moving :D

A rather ridiculous amount of garbage has happened at work in the past two months. I won't bother with the details but in a nutshell they have: 
-Fired my boss with no notice. Just five weeks severance pay and thank you very much leave now.
-Hired a guy that has worked with us before but quit TWICE because he wasn't getting his way. 
-Convinced all of the other managers to kiss my ass. One of whom hasn't been on speaking terms with me for MONTHS and is now trying to stick his head so far up my ass it's making me gag. This is the same person that convinced his entire department not to participate in any of the store's social events or potlucks for the past half a year because he's an ass.
-Still have not had a review in two years
-The latest addition to our work place family is my fourth manager in four years. 
-Told the company owner two years ago that if the rate of ridiculous unprofessional shit that was going down didn't change, I would leave. Nothing has changed. 

All of this = I quit *tosses confetti*. I can see the panic setting in around certain people as they realize there is no way I can train someone to do my job in less than two weeks :D And that there is no one to organize the Christmas party this year.

Travis, a guy I work with, who's wife Darcie is one of my best friends has found a new job in a town about two hours away from where I live right now. She made pretty eyes at me to move with them, so I am. 

My last day will be the Friday of September long. I am looking forward to it very much. The following weekend is my sister;s wedding. After the wedding chaos has died down, I'll be officially settling into my new place. \o/"

I have nothing intelligent or useful to say. Without further ado,


Random GW Christmas fic in February. 3X4 with innuendo. A writer in an awkward phase...

<lj-cut text=""I am, occasionally punctual. I promise...."">


""You do realize I don't observe your backward Christian holiday."" Quatre eyed him, a smile curving soft, pink lips. ""I do practice a different religion entirely.""

With that Quatre took the small box wrapped in glossy paper from Trowa's hands. He worked his thumb under the piece of tape and pulled it up without leaving a mark on the paper. Trowa rolled his eyes.

""Christ wasn't born on December 25th. It's more likely the birth of Christ occurred in the late winter or early spring, experts believe some time in March."" He popped open the other end of the paper and attempted to tug the box free. He frowned in irritation.  ""The date was changed to coincide with a pagan holiday to protect early Christians from persecution."" He began to peel the tape carefully away from the other seams. ""So, realistically it's no more significant than any other day.""

""And I notice that hasn't stopped you from accepting the gift,"" Trowa retorted. ""And for Christ's sake Quatre, you're a billionaire. You don't need to save the wrapping paper.""

""But it's lovely. And really Trowa, blasphemy?"" Quatre said, a small pout curving his lips downward. Trowa simply stared at him as if he were insane. ""Oh fine.""

With a look of pure mischief, Quatre tore the paper to shreds, his tongue peaking out the side of his mouth. The expression on Quatre's face became blank when he pried the box open and saw the contents. He wrapped his hands around the small globe and let the box fall to the floor. He flipped it upside down, shook it, then righted it and watched as the pieces of shimmery material swirled then settled over the little glass covered scene.

""Snow."" Quatre said the word reverently. ""In Paris.""

Trowa had planned to give his explanation of what he felt had happened two weeks prior and meant to demand the same from Quatre. Their two steps forward two steps back routine was getting tired and Trowa wanted and need, to know everything. He had organized his thoughts, reflected deeply on his tightly guarded feelings and had meant to express them all clearly so there could be no doubt about what he wanted from and with, Quatre. While he watched Quatre shake the snow-globe again, to watch the ""snow"" settle over the Eiffel tower once more, all of his carefully gathered thoughts evaporated.

""First kiss."" It was a fairly accurate summary although it lacked some depth, description and emotional flourish. Quatre laughed and before Trowa could fully brace himself, Quatre was on him, giving him a deep kiss. Quatre smiled happily at him when the kiss broke.

""Good gift back,"" Trowa breathed. He had worked his arms around Quatre and wasn't prepared to let go.

""Oh, you haven't unwrapped your gift yet,"" Quatre said, a look of evil delight on his face.

""You're teasing me about blasphemy when you're offering, well /you/ as a return gift?"" Trowa hoped he sounded almost flirty rather than a horny, brain-dead idiot.

""Like I said, I don't observe your holidays and I certainly don't practice your religion. I don't think you should either, because what I want to do to you would definitely be considered unholy."" Quatre's tongue ended the statement by drawing a red hot line up Trowa's neck.

""We're leaving."" It was the only thing that Trowa could think to say. 

""Thank God.""

Something intelligent or at least witty, finally popped into Trowa's head but he held it in. He hoped to convert Quatre into praising God on a king size and he felt wit just might rob him of the chance.

"event","I'm alive and well equipped with a new nephew, a remaining thousand dollars worth of debt (It's shrinking! HOORAY!) and I should be a getting a new car within the year. If not, then I'm buying a laptop. Yes, yes, I shouldn't go racking up new debt, but I've held out for three years. I want a laptop, damn it.

My nephew, (Leo) has just hit the smiling and flailing when you talk to him stage. It's my absolute favourite baby stage. It's just so much fun, or at least I find. And I like baby nonsense noises. Sue me.

I'm steadily trying to sort out my next two trips to Winnipeg despite the fact that my family can't seem to make up their minds about when the hell we're going. I'll be attending my great grandmother's 100th birthday celebration. As to whether or not we will be going in February for her actually birthday is still being sorted out. The April trip for the wedding is essentially set in stone short of me actually booking my ticket. All that remains is to see if Darcie will come along or not. She's offered to be my date. I persist in calling her my arm candy, especially when talking to her husband. 

I'm going to attempt a trip to Vancouver to visit Tim (a good friend from the Peg) as well. Darcie has offered to go down with me so we can split a hotel room. For the most part I think she just wants to go shopping without dragging her husband along.:p We won't make the trip until after Haraamis has come through. I can't wait to see her. :D

And because Cait has asked, the Glenrosa fire is over a 100km away from where I live and on the west side of Okanagan lake.  I'm a very safe distance away, although I do expect the haze from the fire to settle in and hover over the area like it did during the worst of the Litton fire earlier this year.  And, to be blunt, with the fire level at extreme, the dry weather we've been having and all the pine beetle kill in the surrounding trees, I'm surprised there aren't more fires. On the positive side, nearly half the fire is contained.  A day or two with rain but no storming would be really be helpful though. 

Anyway, I'm going to see Half-Blood Prince tonight and I plan on eating lots of popcorn. I will harass you all later!"

Jabberwocky by Lewis Carroll

Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
  Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
All mimsy were the borogoves,
  And the mome raths outgrabe.

""Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
  The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
  The frumious Bandersnatch!""

He took his vorpal sword in hand:
  Long time the manxome foe he sought --
So rested he by the Tumtum tree,
  And stood awhile in thought.

And, as in uffish thought he stood,
  The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
  And burbled as it came!

One, two! One, two! And through and through
  The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
He left it dead, and with its head
  He went galumphing back.

""And, has thou slain the Jabberwock?
  Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!'
  He chortled in his joy.

`Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
  Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
All mimsy were the borogoves,
  And the mome raths outgrabe."

"event","So I've made it. The flight was a little bit of a disaster, but that seems to be the norm when I travel internationally. Nothing ever goes smoothly. I've decided it's just like that for me and have given up any other expectation. 

It's been over cast for the past few days and not all that warm but it's nicer than the weather at home and that's all that matters. I've harassed Anne and have begun attacking her house. I scrubbed half the kitchen. I wasn't feeling energetic so I didn't get to the rest of it yesterday but I will. It's put me in firm mind that the girls, as much as I like them, do sweet piss all. But then again, they are teenagers and at least they're working now. I've decided the kitchen is my project and then maybe, if we have time, I'll attack the living room. It all depends on whether or not I feel that vicious =)

Anne and I are exchanging heaps of anime and TV shows. I've watched a good chunk of season one of Doctor Who. I'm patiently waiting for Jack to appear. Tosh has shown up which amuses greatly. And I plan on stealing season 2 of Torchwood. ZOMG kisses XD!

W're now panning day trips now. Up the coast and over the Rumatakas. And a day trip to the south island. 

And the next time someone complains to me about the BC ferry prices I will laugh in their faces. With a vehicle to the south island one way, is $273 NZ. $80 - $100 is not so bad, eh? And a day trip for three, no vehicle is $273. *falls over* I should have expected that. I know how the pricing over here works, but holy hell. Or not so holy hell as it were. 

I will update with more later."

I want to say I'm here to tell you all about my trip in fine gory details but actually, I'm lazy and would prefer to sum up.

Disneyland and Universal Studios were tons of fun. The flights however, blew.

The trip there: We were fogged in at Kelowna airport. We took a later flight out, had half an hour to pre-clear US customs in Calgary before getting on the flight to LA> That was awesome with five adults and four children. Yes. <i>Awesome</i>. On the way back I had food poisoning. Hurray for being ill in airplane washrooms. 

Disneyland is amazing. I loved it to death. I'm a fairly big Disney movie fan so I enjoyed all of it. The rides in and of themselves were fairly basic. The execution, the <i>theme</i> part of the theme park was wonderful. The ones that stood out the most to me were Peter Pan's Flight. Soaring over London in a little pirate boat was fantastic. I also really liked Mr Toad's Wild Ride and The Roger Rabbit Ride :D My littlest niece loved Gadget's Go Coaster, Splash Mountain (which she referred to as the Zipitty Do Da ride) and Space Mountain. My oldest niece loved Space Mountain, The Matarhorn and the Princess Fantasy fair. Oh yes, the danced with Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty and Snow White. They got autographs and pictures with; Ariel; Jasmine; Belle; Mulan; Mickey; Minnie; Donald; Pluto; Goofy; Chip and Cruella Deville. 

I have to gush a minute about the parade. It's an amazing display of just how much is invested in the park. The floats are impressive, the dancing simple but fun and the costumes are intricate and <i>pretty</i>. I really, really likes the costumes. Just PRETTY!

In California Dream park, the highlight for me? Turtle Talk with Crush. It was hilarious and amazing. The girls loved it. <i>I</i> loved it. 

The Muppet's 3D shows was great and Monsters Inc ride gets bonus points because it's Monsters Inc. My six year old niece went on the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror. She loved it.I went on it twice :D We rode the big coaster with my sister but no one would go on the Maliboomer with me so I went on my own :P I thought my stomach was going to come out my nose. It was great. And Toy Story Midway Mania? Great fun :D:D!

Universal Studios was great fun for me. I really enjoyed the tour. The best part was Jaws, hands down. The best rides was the Simpson 3D ride though. I loved it. As good as the Mummy and the Jurassic park rides were the Simpsons ride was extra special. :D

It was a go, go, go sort of vacation but I enjoyed myself. I only wish we had gone to Knott's Berry Farm. Next time I suppose, because I definitely want to go again :D

Anyway, now I have to start getting ready for New Zealand. YAY!!"

Here is my example: 

Travis had a twenty minute conversation with a customer about the following. I shit you not.

Travis: answers the phone with our usual little shpeel.

Customer: I was overcharged for my tires.

Travis: All right let me look up your bill on the computer.

Travis: *hunts for billing info.* Ok, you bought four of tire X and they were $150 each.

Customer: Well, the flyer says they are on for by one get one half off.

Travis: Yes, that's right. Full price on those tires is $200.

Customer: Well, that's not buy one get one half off then.

Travis: Yes, actually it is because regular price on those tires is $200. Instead of giving you one at $200 then another at $100 we gave you four, each one being $150. It's easier to enter the sale in the computer by giving every tire a discount of 25% rather than one full price and one half. 

Customer: You're ripping people off. You're not giving them the sale price!

Travis: -____-;;; No we're not. Four tires at $150 is $600. Buying two for $200 and two for $100 is still $600. 

(Travis actually attempted several different version of the math in a fruitless attempt to teach this person basic math over the phone.)

Customer: I want to talk to your manager right now!

Travis: You'll have to call back tomorrow. She's away for the day.

Customer: I will. I'm completely unsatisfied. 

Travis: That's your prerogative. *hangs up* 

Travis to me: How can people go through life not being able to do basic math? How do they pay their bills or balance their bank accounts?

Me: With varying degrees of difficulty? :D

Travis: This is why I can't quit smoking. AND HOW COME I KEEP GETTING ALL THE STUPID PEOPLE?!?!?!

Me: Do you remember the guy that I spent half an hour explaining THE EXACT SAME THING TO?

Travis. -__-; Yes. HOW CAN THEY BE THIS DUMB?!?!

Me: I don't know!

Yes, it's been an AWESOME few weeks at work. My vacation can't start soon enough.

In other news, I've watched all of Slayers Revolution. Happiness isn't a warm gun it's a powered up dragon slave. I had almost forgotten my love for this series it's been so long. The animation is a little bit different which isn't surprising since season one is from 1996 I believe so I was a little distracted for the first few epsiodes. Overall, I totally enjoyed it.

<lj-cut text=""More comments of the spoiler variety here"">

The opening to the new series was hilarious and <i>perfect</i>. Lina taking on pirates because she had hunted bandits to near extinction. And the stuff with the fish girl almost killed me. It was a  throwback to season one for the big fans, but presented in an amusing enough way to give new fans the giggles.

Amelia and Zelgadis' entrance was great. They did an excellent job of presenting the relationships of the characters involved quickly for people that were unfamiliar. Zel and Amelia's relationship is still a little ambiguous as is Lina and Gourry's. But it's always been that way with the series, one step forward one step back.

Xellos did not disappoint. His overwhelming need for mischief and going about his orders with the sort of vindictive glee only a mazoku could have made me miss him so. He will probably always be one of my favourite characters. He should some great insight into Lina with the trap coliseum and the ""Don't Push"" button and the ""push"" button traps as well as the romance trap, the slimy things trap and finally, the death blow, mentioning Lina's family. Although, I'm not still completely sure what he was up to. But you never can be I suppose.

There were no surprising revelations in the series but some excellent cameo's with a few fan favourites like Prince Phillionel and Sylphiel. Although there was no sign of Filia.

I was at first amused with the Zanafar references though a little annoyed that Lina seemed to have ""forgotten"" that the Sword of Light was made famous by slaying the demon lord a thousand years earlier. I mean, in the original series that was WHY she wanted the sword of light. But I suppose it's another case of sacrificing characters for plot. Which often times, pains me.

It did bother me a little that they re-used the Zanafar monster but that they presented it in a different way and made it out to be something different than presented in season one actually managed to really entertain me. The idea that Zanafar was created by humans to destroy mazoku I found really intriguing and makes me want to read the Slayers books despite the fact that they scare me (DAMN YOU TOKYOPOOP! I mean Pop...). If only I could read Japanese. Overall the re-use of the monster wasn't bad because it wasn't executed in the same way. Then again, Slayers is one of the most repetitive animes out there and yet it is still fantastic every time! :D

I was not very fond of inspector Wizer. He had a quirky sort of personality that was entertaining but I just kept waiting for him to die. I <i>wanted</i> him to die. He helped move the plot along but otherwise I didn't have much use for him. Zuuma on the other hand interests me. The colour and shape of his eyes put me very much in mind of Copy Rezo after merging with Zanafar. However, I don't think that's who it is. My money is on someone from Sairaag who's family was killed in one of the two times Lina levelled the great city. Although it wasn't her fault the first time, it was just because she was there. It's an easy guess as to why Zuuma wants her dead I just would like to know who he is and why he has the vase that holds Rezo's soul and more importantly, <i>how</i> he got it.


I would LOVE to know who's soul is in Ozel. I really, really, REALLY want to know! I thought it might be Eiris, because she's dead, but I don't know how her soul would have ended up in the doll...

My only real complaint about this series is that it was only thirteen episodes long. Rumour has it there will be another thirteen episode season of Slayers called GLORY! But it's only a rumour.

The series also gets bonus points for managing to keep almost all the original voice acting cast. The only one I know for sure is different is Phil :D Megumi Hayashibara sure has grown up!

DAMN I MISSED THIS SHOW!! :D:D! HURRAY REVIVAL!"

"event","I can't really remember the last time I posted so I'll sum it up quick. 

July was hot, stressful at work and full of cherry eating. I was eating pretty much a pound of them a day.

August was attack of the visitors. My cousin who spent most of July with us went home. My Auntie Colette and Uncle Terry came out. The house they're building is pretty much ready for winter now. I'm hoping they'll be done building by the fall of next year. I want them to live out here. Terry is never dull :D Auntie Nina and Uncle Todd, Robert and Amanda came out at the same time as my cousin Shauna and her baby came up. This also happened to be the weekend I was OUT of town AND K was here. I could have smacked them all in the head. Of all the times to come out. They had all decided to visit about two to three weeks before coming. It was special.

September is still stressful at work. The guys are miserable because work is very thin until the change in seasons. Travis has hurt his back and I don't know when he'll be back to work. Wes quit which makes me want to cry. And if they give his job to Chris I'm going to beat someone to death. Not that I don't like Chris, I do. Actually, I adore Chris, we spend a lot of time being assholes together, but the fact remains he could not manage Wes' job if his life depended on it. He's barely reliable being Wes' underling, never mind his own boss. They're talking about offering it to Travis which would be fine, except I doubt Travis would take it. And I don't want Travis to leave me, not that he'd be going far, but it's the principle of the thing. No one has the balls to offer me the job because my manager would kill them. And I wouldn't take it anyway. I can make more money where I am working less hours and not have to babysit a bunch of lazy boys I can't verbally abuse regularly. I'm mean to the guys I work with. :D

My sister bought us a Wii and I've bought WiiFit which is stupidly fun. And Soul Caliber Legends which is pretty entertaining, but it's more of a quest based game. There doesn't seem to be arena fighting which irritates the piss out of me. I think I might try to find it for the game cube, because I know I like that one. I haven't done much other than work and be lazy.

Travis' wife is making me a purse that I'm very excited about. I couldn't find anything I really liked other than a hundred dollar purse that wasn't even leather. If I'm going to spend a hundred bucks on a purse it better be leather or damn special. Since it was neither, I didn't buy it and instead enlisted Darcie to make me one. It's going to be a grey-purple, cloth, messenger style purse with an Asian style dragon print liner. I do not like the glam style purses. I think they're fugly and do not suit me at all. 

I can just imagine it. Walking down the street some silvery, gaudy glam shoulder bag on my arm while I'm wearing my jeans and NASA T-shirt with my messy, boy style hair cut. Yeah. It would be awesome. And very, very wrong.

One of the cats had escaped the other day (we keep the cats in doors. There are too many coyotes, bears and people who own large dogs in the area. to let them wander) but it came back this morning. Sara is stressed out and lonely for petting (Which is surprising, she's from the SPCA and she's very skittish of people. She was hiding in the bushes by the house meowing and wouldn't come out. I had to bring the dog outside to coax her out. She loves the dog even though his favourite thing to do it chase her around the house until he can pin her down and clean her) but otherwise she seems OK. Our other cat had missed her terribly and they've been spending their time chasing each other.

It's thirty-two days until I leave for California. YAY! DISNEYLAND! 

Sixty Days until I leave for New Zealand. YAY! ANNE! YAY! CAIT! 

And eighty-six days until I leave for Australia. YAY! KAREN!

I thought I would share pictures (My camera is new and I've been screwing with the settings, ignore some of teh weirdness if you will) :) The falls aren't huge or anything like that, but they're running fairly fast this year and it's a pretty little place. Cait can vouch for it. A lot of trees have fallen since autumn. 

And yes, I am alive. Who knew? :p

We also went shopping. We both bought 500 gig external hard drives. What, they cost $140? Couldn't pass that up. *pets it*

And I bought four CDs. I am in love with Metro Station's self titled and Dragonette's Galore. And I caved and bought Panic! At the Disco's Pretty. Odd. and Mindless Self Indulgence's If.  

In other news, there was a bear wandering around our neighbourhood yesterday. He walked into a yard four doors down while their four boys were playing outside (traumatizing the father beyond all possible methods of repair.) and then wandered up to cross over the lawn belonging to the neighbours across the street. I didn't see him but apparently he was a rather mangy looking male. 

My guess he's been kicked out of a territory outside of town by a larger bear and made his way into the city looking for food. It is hard to say though, as there was a female and two cubs on the other side of town in Darcie's backyard. And I mean literally in her backyard. Their neighbours mentally disabled son came face to face with the female and was terrified (he apparently screamed hysterically) his brother came around the corner and there was BIG MOMMA! She put herself between the boys and the cubs then went up on her hind legs (NEVER a good thing). During the ensuing chaos with the family and a few neighbours the bears wandered off. 

Apparently there have been quite a few bear sitting this year. The growing season is a little behind this year because of a late snow and cooler weather so I'm sure there are quite a few hungry bears wandering around. It's a little intimidating. I have been going for walks with the dog lately but now I'm a little paranoid about doing so."

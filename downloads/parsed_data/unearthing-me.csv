"event","jackie, you make a good point about having faith, but faith,to me, is believing in something no mattter what. even when everything is telling you not to because it just isnt rational or just seems impossible.  well at least thats how i look at faith now. i really never thought about it before.  i didnt realize what it was, or what i had, then it just sorta left me, slowly but uknowingly, and yet consciously and abruptly.

and now i need answers. ive always inquired about things, even religion, butnow i just need solid, tangible answers(whether that makes sense, i know not,but its all very coherent in my mind i just cant seem to articulate it).  telling me ""it's true, it's in the bible"" just dont cut it anymore. but now im more comfortable with church and i need to go every now and then simply becasue it was part of me since i was little(thought it was never anything major, just sumthing instilled that was expected to be asked about and then followed).

ok, so i called carlos cuz i realized i;d been pretty curt with him lately. 

carlos:it's cool,i'm over you

carlos:no, but you taught me to go for it if i want it and not to dwell on things.

so i was supposed to go to six flags with carol and ale yesterday, but i had a doctor sappointment and i didnt want to ditch practice, imissed my swimming peeps. so i went and i got there(brace yourself) EARLY! my arms felt like jello. i saw melissa! and roberto and nancy.went to doctors to get a refill on my medicine. then i walked to hugos house for band practice.  it was kinda boring. edward was in tj and hugo didnt know his part to bri's song. what instrument is he gonna play when they perform? but scars weere given! haha, so they dont have a cymbal stand so hugo hung it to the ceiling with a rope and it swings! melissa feared for her life while playing. so she swung the cymbal and BAM it sliced hugo in the chin! it looked painful but we were all laffing. morbid? just a tad.

so after practice no body wanted to go home, so me, melissa, and bri went to the thrift store.  fun, i'd never been to that one and i could have spent all day there. there were some hideous things but we filled our shopping carts. i found a bunch of t-shirts in the boys sections, but alas, sum were too short or small. but i got my stomp shirt! so i had to go home to take care of franie, but bri and mel said i could bring her along. i talked my mom into bringing her to the thrift store and we moved out to the mall.  lol, you should have seen us scarfing for money to buy fries! luckily franiie came with money. saw a few ppl from skool including jackie, aww i miss her in 5th. and there was this cuuuuute guy, but meliisa didnt  see him. oh i met bri's prom date, he seems cool.

""it touched the line!""

no practice on friday, but we got parkas and bags!sure they're so faded they're orange but they are warm none the less.

"event","""Turn to the left no a little more chin up hand on your waist shoulders towards me perfect now smile""...hmmm,the ever repetitious words of photographers. yep, so the swim team   took pictures yesterday.  everyone was running around fixing their hair and makeup, i just put on lipstick, stuck a few bobbypins in my hair and i was good to go.  the team picture was ok but the sun was i nmy face and i think it looked like i was cringing.  i took buddy pix with jennifer, lorena, evelyn and nancy on the diving board and was very tempted to push them all in but then i figured it'd be hell to pay, so i refrained. :) sandy and andrea did the bay watch run lol.

i took my math test over, i think i did better.

i should have gone with the drumline to rancho, but they were gonna be gone the whole day and i felt like sleeping in today...sorry carol:(
maybe ill go to the quince with daisy and liz, ehh i dont feel like dressing up.

my grandma is fine *huge sigh of relief* and out of the hospital, life at the moment is ok."

"event","hey hey hey toast slice in da housssse! lol that was for u brianna.  go aQuadons! so the swimeet went ok today.  girls varsity won, jv (us) lost but it was close and we did great.  guys sadly lost by 5 pts but they did awesome. gabriel was all bummed out and me and belicka were trying to cheer him up but he insisted he was alright.  damn guys and their pride. oh and i got fist in th 50m butterfly!! melissa got first in the 50 or 100m(i dont member) but she got first in her backstroke relay! ,me and sandy made up a new dance for ""hit that"" lol, for sum strange resaon swimmeets release our ""inner ghetto""lol, that and being with ace, my lovable ace. pictures are tomorrow (uggh) i dont think ill buy any. last thing on my mind is owNing a pic of me in a bathing suit. 

i looked ""numbness"" up( courtesy of merriam-webster.com, yes now my comp is working *hurray*) and apparently it is a word, a noun actaully. i guess thats the only word that can come close to describing what i feel.  i was thinking about it today and everytime i triedd to write my feelings down there were absloutely no words that seemed fit.  but i dont know what r why im like this.  maybe cuz of what steph told me is going on with her or my grandma i dont  know.  then theres the ongoing fear that pops up every now and then.  the fear of who i am going to become and whether or not ill ever restore my faith. who knows it was just really on mind in 5th.  that class gived me too much time to think but thankfully i had Pinkerton to remind me of better times :)damn proctors, i was gonna ditch fourth, i really needed to just realx even tho foruth is a kick back its too loud, and that damn procotr looks at me and carol whrn there like 20 other ppl around us. royally bombed my math test, a whopping 48 % my alltime low.  make up is tomorrow or next week
doubt ill have time to study tonite tho. aargh i have an essay due for spanish and bio up the waa-zoo. so better go peace out.

p.S. bri, i love ya"

"event","well im here in skool, and my comp at home is being stupid and not letting me go any websites.

i agree with the age for legally driving to be 16. i am a hazard on the road! my mom let me back the car out of the garage  the other day and i got nervous and hit the accelerator and the car shot backward ( no, no lives were taken) and my mom screamed/laffed. so yes, im assuming that i will now be confined to the passenger seat until im 20

boredom=death unless josue is with you, in which case he causes a rukus. so we have a sub for sixth and he's like ""im confiscating this *grabs my cd player* andim gonna tell the teacher you called me fat"" i stared puzzled at him as he walked away towards the teacher. i can see him telling her something , but i cant hear what and i see him pointing at me. the he screamed out"" she called me fat!""  i was busting up and he came back looking smug and mildy entertained. lol

yesterday was steph's b-day thing at gamework's which was ok but got boring after a while.  before that was the league relays swimmeet.  it was fun except my eyes burned form the chlorine since my goggles kept falling off every time i dove in!  no doubt in  3 months !! wooo hooo!!"

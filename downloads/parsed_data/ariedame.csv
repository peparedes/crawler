"event","Not much interesting.  Today we had a motocross assembly first hour.  Pretty cool stuff.  Going to go to Kirksville on wednesday to see some motocross stuff.  Pretty sweet.  I wonder if I could ever do motocross.

I really want to box.  I know that's horrible of me but it gives me such a dive, adrinaline.  My mom says I'm too sweet for a sport like that.  She says I have a personality that brights up any room I walk in and that it would ruin that appearance if I started a career of hitting people in the face.  Lol.  I see where she's coming from to an extent, but I still love boxing.  

But yea, my hands are all bruised and swolen from hitting on the wall.  Call me dumb, lol.  I probebly am, but I just want to fight so bad.  I'm a little proud of my purple knuckles.

So this week is totally booked.  Well, for my mom.  I just have to babysit for her.  She volunteers for too many things.  She's going to be gone everynight this week for one thing or the other.  Thursday night I might go to Gordy's church with her.  Last Thursday mom said they had a guest speaker who preached in a jumpsuit and handcuffs!!  How awesome does that sound?!  So I may go this week.  Then Friday night go to my daddy's.  Then Saturday night either I'm going to be at Bevier helping with the Fall Festival thing at the church, or watching my nefu for the night.  I would take him to the church with me but he is so hyper-active.  So I don't know what I'll do, I'll have to talk to my mom.  I need the spending money though.

So, today was nice.  It wasn't a bad day.  In Accounting we played the board game Monopoly.  I one in my group.  My assets were higher.  w00t!  But there was another girl in the class who was playing on a different board and her assets were in the 3000s while mine were only in the 2000s so she got the candy bar  :(     Maybe we'll play again tomorrow and I'll do better.  Who knows.  

OH, I'm making a C in Pre-Algebra!!   I am soooooo excited! When she, Mrs. Gann, showed me my grade I almost jumped out of my body with excitement.  That doesn't mean I won't get a bad report from her though.  Parent-Teacher conferences are Friday I'mma thinkin.  Let's see, from my point of view, this is how I'm doing:

World History:  probebly bad.  I might get a good report from Mrs. Sudtholt because she knows my family AND she likes me BUT I haven't turned in notes yet and they were due last week so I don't know if I'm her good side or not....probebly not.  I know my grade in there has gone up from a D though.  It's probebly a C or C-.  Hopefully.

EnglishII:  Excellent!  I've done mostly all my work in there.  I wrote a really good memory paper and got an A+ on it so no worries about my grade in there.  I told her I didn't want her to show my mom the paper I wrote though.  I mean, I'm proud of myself for writing it so well, but my mom wouldn't care and I don't mind that.  I just want to keep it to myself.  But, yea, I know I'll get a good report from that teacher.

FrenchI:  Meh.  I don't know.  My homework is horrible in that class.  But I'm sure I have a C or above.  She might comment on how talkative I am, in english and french, lol.

ChemCom:  I hate that class. I never do her stupid bell ringers so I know I'm slacking there.  I never have my text book and I'm always sleeping.  But I've turned in most of her boring homework crap so I'm sure I've raised that grade from the D it was.  

PhysEd:  I'm very active in that class.  And there has only been a couple of times I haven't dressed out for her.  So the worst my grade could be is an A- which I can handle.  :P    I love that class though.  And I don't think coach has a problem with me.  I'll surely get a good report from that class.

Pre-Algebra:  Mrs. Gann hates me.  I don't even know what I did.  And she's a christian. I thought christians were supposed to have some sort of connection.  Anywho, I NEVER due my work in that class.  I'm always doodling in my notebook instead of taking notes.  And there's a test on wednesday coming up and I am so not prepared for it.  But, like I said, I've got a C in that class and how far can it go down in 3 days.  Probebly a lot, I'll study, don't worry.  I know mom will get a horrible report from her though, because she doesn't like me.  Lol.  She's just jealous of my nice body!  Haha!

Accounting:  Mrs. Shoemaker LOVES me.  I know she does.  And I know I'm doing excellent in that class.  I'm a little behind with the homework and stuff but I'm good at the journalizing and the posting and the tests she gives.  And I'm very awake in that class and give funny remarks that she likes.  I'm sure to get a good report from that class.



And that's it.   All fairly good reports.  Mom will only be disappointed in me for math.  But only because i don't put my all into it.  Which I will when I get a job.  And actually, starting next semester I will start doing better.  Because in march I'll be getting a job and I won't be able to with bad grades.  So yea, that's my promise to myself.

Anyways, mom's home.  Full of love and joy.  :(  I hate it when she's home.  She should go back to working 24s at the ambulance.  Anywho, she's kicking me off now.  It's 9:30, bedtime.  Freaking sucks but it's fine.  I'll drown the world away with Metallica and Alice Cooper.  

So, sorry for another looooong entry.  Not like anyone cares anyways.  Goodnight, England!

"event","I have been very down lately.  But slowly, with time, I feel like I've been rejuvenating.  I feel more at ease with things.  I'm not crying as much.  And I'm growing more and more interest.

I still feel a little upset with some things.  Like my mother not being able to listen to me. I tried telling her about my visit to the guidance counselor's to talk and she kept asking what all I said.  I didn't want to tell her, it was MY visit.  Anyways, I started to think that maybe it WOULD be good to tell her all I said and talked to the counselor about, so maybe we could grow closer.  So, I told her all that I had said, about her internet relationships and how they bother be and how her three marriages and divorces and how I'm starting to become confused of my own guy-girl relationships and if I would be able to handle one...and some other things of not as much significance.  Well she huffed and puffed and blew me away.  I couldn't believe her reaction. I thought she would say sorry I've been so horrible, lol, or at least, maybe, some kind of comment.  Instead, she grunted at me, and heavily sighed, and told me that she didn't want everyone knowing our business.  (isn't that what counselors are for?  does she not think that what goes on in her life effects me as well?  did i not go to the counselor to get stuff off my chest?)  So she got mad and I started crying and she goes ""WE'RE NOT GOING TO CRY TONIGHT!  SO STOP BECAUSE I NEED YOUR HELP!""  She yelled this at me but in a whisper, so that no one would know that we were disputing.  So, I did as she pleased and wiped my tears and cleared the table.

My mom's mean.  But things are a little back to normal.  She's just been mean to me.  

Also, I fell down the stairs the other night.  FELL.  No one falls down the stairs, lol.  So I felt stupid and just laughed at myself.  It did hurt and I scraped my elbow.  Well, I have a mark on my elbow from the crash and boom and my sister, Abbie, says, ""What's that from?""  So I answer her saying, ""From falling down the stairs."" And she dares to say, ""You mean HURLING yourself down the stairs?""   WTF?!!!!!!!  That hurt my feelings.  I feel like crying now because of it.  A few years ago, yes, I may have thought of doing such a thing as ""hurling myself down the stairs"".  But I've changed, SO MUCH.  I taken 3 steps a day for a year now.  I know I've been falling away from spirituality lately, but I'm working on it.  I have been saddened lately but I'm working on it.  I'm working on it so hard and NO ONE HAS NOTICED.  I feel like giving up.  Why shouldn't I just go back to the way I was.  I already sometimes feel that way.  Going back to cigarettes and parties and lying to everyone and hating myself so much and trying to ignore God.  I hate that.  I'm proud of my progress so far, why does everyone have to be so harsh about things?

I did not hurl myself down the stairs.  I really feel that's true.  But I have been losing myself lately....and maybe...possibly...I DID hurl myself down those steps.  Maybe subconsciously I wanted to hurt myself without cutting my wrists like I would have done back then.  Maybe I DID hurl myself down...that scares me more than anything...

I miss Chris.  He's gone from me.  Distanced himself from me.  I hardly understand it.  ""I just need some space"" he says to me.  I hardly understand.  It was too sudden.  I feel alone.  He's my only bestest friend.  I long for the day we'll chat again.

So many things at school.  I always lose my mind the most when sitting in ChemCom.  Such a horribly cold class.  And I always look around and wonder if it's real.  If I'm really of any existence at all.  I want to jump up and scream. I want to start crying and fall to the floor. I wanting to start freaking out about invisible birds or people trying to devour my spirits.  I want everyone to know what I'm feeling, like things aren't as they seem. 

It's also scary to walk in the halls.  I always feel like someone's going to attack.  I start breathing heavily and think I'll surely be attacked.  It gets so crowded in those halls.  Pushing and shoving.  Today I was walking along with Whitney and I grasped onto her sweatshirt, tightly I squeezed so that she wouldn't leave me behind.  She didn't say anything but I felt foolish afterward.  I thought maybe she would find out my fear of the crowded hallway.  I hate it there.  I always ALWAYS feel on guard of myself.  

Sometimes I imagine certain things as well.  Like the teacher hating me so much, they start choking me.  And I die and everyone just goes on with their school work.  And I lie there, dead and alone.  Or that demons will come from people's eyes and attack me or just dance joyously about the room and the ceiling.  Those demons would scare me...even not seeing them literally, they put fear in my body and make me cold inside.

I write too much. I'm sorry.

A demain!

"event","I broke down at school today.  Couldn't stop crying so I went to the guidence counseler and let it out there.  I'm glad we only have lady counselers.  I don't even know why I'm so sad.  And it's probebly because I don't eat enough or get enough sleep.  I'm also a 15 year old female and my hormones are going crazy.

So it was a sad day for me.  Depressed with my black painted nails.  They're growing out.  I pray I won't bite them. I want them to grow.  And I want to lose a lot of weight, enough to where people think I'm on something.  Then I want to move away and change my name to Suhna.  A nickname my muslim friend gave to me.  Her religion scares me but she does not.  She's not a very depth thoughted person so it's a little hard to talk to her, but I try, lol.

I've often thought of what it would be like if I were musilim.  Killing christians and burning the american flag.  What would people say if I suddenly became a muslim.  Just popped up one day and started on my muslim prayers.  Or fasted for a whole month like the muslims do.   Crayzie thoughts, sorry.  :P

I haven't eaten all day.  I had a few tiny pieces of hamburger.  Fattening but it was delicious.  I'm a little shaky as well.

I love English.

I finished my book tonight.  ""Serious Girls"".  GOOD BOOK!  Like I said, I entirely recommend it!!

Anyways, I'm tired.  Good night.  <3<3<3
I heart you, too, Matchooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Thanks for putting up with me tonight and all the other millions of times.  I'm so lucky to have someone like you...  :)

"event","""Would you lie with me and just forget the world?""

Snow Patrol introduced us to a more perfect way of saying how we feel about eachother.  But words weren't enough and the way we felt wasn't enough.  Maybe that's why I've been so depressed.  Maybe, self consciencely, I'm hurting more than I thought I would be.  Even though I knew this time would come.  No one could hold out for 3 years.  I didn't expect anyone to.



The book I am reading is excellent.  I definitely recommend this one!!  ""Serious Girls"" by Maxine Swann.  Excellent excellent writer!  Deep thoughts are contained in this book.  Thoughts that have inspired my own thoughts and made me want to be with coach more and more each time I see him.  In the book, Maya (main character), startsa love affair with an older man in his 30s.  I am Maya's age, almost 16.  And coach is Arthur's (30 year old love affair) age.  Coach and I would make the cutest couple...and the thought of being with him romantically makes my head tingle!  I know we would be able to hit it off if it weren't for his wife and son.  I do laugh out loud about my crush on coach, but inside I'm serious..and if I had it my way, me and him would have been together a long time ago (on his office desk!)  HAHA!!

But yes, like I say, ""Serious Girls"" is a great book.  I'm still not done with it.  I have only 7 more chapters to read and it will surely be finished tonight when I get off of this computer.  

I also have two other books waiting in line.  One book, ""Things Hoped For"" by Andrew Clemments is one that my mother checked out for me.  At first I had decided not to read it because it has to do a lot with the bible and religion...but I know I need to hear more stuff like that..AND I've only read one book in my entire life written by a male.  And that was ""Cujo"" by Stephen King.  So I may or may not read it, we'll see what I decide.

The other book waiting for my eyes and thoughts and comments is ""Born Blue"" by Han Nolan.  A book about a girl who almost dies and is brought back to life and she wants to be a singer or something.  Haha!  maybe I'll understand it better after I start reading it.  But tonight, I really need to finish ""Serious Girls"".  Because Maya just got grounded and can't see Arthur and Roe just had sex with her boy Jesse.  I LOVE IT!  It's like my own dramatic soap opera.  It makes me want to be them so bad.  I desperately want to be Maya, in all her fanciness and sassiness with just her looks.  She can attract any man she pleases and she knows it.  I want to be able to attract any man I want, just for the pleasure of containing beauty.  

What would happen if I WERE to suduce coach.  I know he'd fall for me, I know he'd be like John Procter and I'd be Abigail Williams.  And we'd fall madly for eachother but he'd be loyal to his wife like the good man he is.  And I'd accuse her of witchcraft and have her hung.  And instead of coach being accused and hung, he'd agree to run away with me.  And him and Mickey (his baby boy) and I would live happily ever after in a far away beautiful land together.  

...I really need to snap back to reality.  But my imagination and desires are too addicting! :P


So, I'm off to see if I've recieved any important emails, then finish that book that diing to be finished tonight.

I'm not such a psycho.  I know I freaked Whitney out yesterday, lol.  And today when I tried taking out her eye.  LOL. She freaked out on me when I actually touched her eyeball.  I just couldn't stop laughing.  Although I didn't actually AIM on touching her eyeball or dig it out for that matter, haha.  But I won't tell her that.  Best to keep these people scared of me, I like the feeling.

We also got a new girl in English class today.  Her name's Kaitlyn (probebly spelled wrong but I like that spelling) and she's moved from South Carolina.  She looked sad to be there.  I want to be her friend, or at least see if she's a deep thinker like I am.  Or if she has some of the same psycho thoughts.  As long as she doesn't cut herslef for attention like LeAnna does.  Or as long as she doesn't punch walls until she bleeds like Nicole, lol.  I want her to be normal yet psychotic, like me.  I want a best friend so bad.  A best friend who DOESN'T want down my pants, lol.  Seriously, the bus rides with Corey and Cody are starting to get old.  Their ill manners and low respect for me and my body is starting to make me sad at them.  :(

But really, I want this new girl to be my friend.  Unless someone else has already gotten to her.  But if she'll be mine, all mine, then Whitney can run away with wonderful Katie Sue and leave me alone forever like she wants it.  :P   

I'm also finding myself to be more and more attracted to this one woman.  Her names Hannah.  Everyone says she's lez...and she is attractive.  But that's wrong for me to say! :P  So, I'll get over her quickly, haha.  Before I freak everyone out and make them think I'm a lezzy!  haha, I'm not lez, just bi.  HAHA, just playing.  But what would explain this attraction for chics that I have?  :P 

LOVE YOU, BABE!  LOVE YOU, OTHER BABE!  Haha.

"event","Reality takes its roll as I go through the motions of home then school then home then sleep.  Getting caught with tears in the school bathroom stall isn't my idea of an excellent day.  I forget why I'm crying and maybe nevver had a reason in the first place.  I miss home, Bevier, I miss my friends and jumping in mud puddles and staying up watching commercials at Steph's place.  I miss everything about home and I see it in my families eyes as well.  They, however, don't hide their pain like I do.  They blurt it right out and boldly, too.  ""I HATE IT HERE!"" or ""IT'S ALLIE'S FAULT WE'RE HERE!""

I know it's my fault.  And I love Macon as much as I can.  But after what I did to myself and everyone else that summer...I couldn't stay.  I broke my word to too many people and I messed up.  How could I have walked those halls?  With eyes on me.  Staring right through me.  I would have killed myself...I promise you that.  I feel like diing now, but I'll control myself...until I'm older and away from here and in New York.  I'll be free in that big city.  Staying in some small apartment all alone.  Not to be bothered by anything or anyone.  And working for my money as I please.  Doing as I please, anytime I please.  I know with that sort of living style, though, I would more than definitely be crying so much more than I do now.

Sometimes, like now, I just want out.  I want out of reality because I look around me now and it's already so faded.  Either that..or I am faded.  Faded away into nothingness, just deep desperate thinking and darkness.  I hate the dark, I fear it. 

When I laugh, I feel like I've got a demon inside of me.  Not just a giggle, but when something is really funny...or when I just can't stop laughing...I feel like I'm demon possesed.  I hate demons, I really do fear them.  I'm scared they'll come out of my cieling at night and devour me slowly in their darkness.  But if I saw Satan in his human form...gorgeous, irrisistable..I'd probebly fall to my knees.  Not in worship HAHA, but in fear of him.  I fear Satan...more than I fear God.  Because even though I know God has more power over Satan...I feel like God's given me up to him..to the devil.

This is only sometimes.  Other times I truly feel like God cares and wants me on His glorious side.  But most of the time He hates me because my thoughts are too deep and jumpy.  Curious about the dark side and what all I could do.  I hate myself for thinking those things.  So I'll stop now.

I wish I could have gone to Bevier church yesterday.  I wanted to sit through Clark's teachings, he's so wise.  He's in college and a Pasotr's son so of course he's going to be so much more...more something that I desperately want to be.  But I'm too trapped inside myself to give myself up to God like I once have before.

I hate the MEGA church in Macon.  Their smiles are so fake and unnecessary.  They talk like they're so happy but on the inside they're falling apart.  They say my name so cheerfully, like my name is such an honor to say..just once..  Then they walk away with a small delicate wave and a ""God bless"".  I hate going there.
But there's always free food, lol.

There's no such thing as monsters.

I really miss Josh.  I don't know where Jonathan was today.  Probebly with his mother.  If she would just disappear everything would be fine.  I don't want to take anyone's side but I love Josh more than I even know Christina.  She doesn't even seem like a real person to me.  Josh is wonderful and bouncy and talkative and random like I am.  For a time I thought I had a crush on him, lol.  But what I was feeling for him was ENTIRELY different.  I love him.  He's my mentor and hero and everything I look up to.  I love him so much.  In a way I've never even thought I could love someone.  If it were just him, Carrie, Jonathan, Ruby and I...just run away together to New York or somewhere just far away from here.  We'd just play video games together and me and Josh would have deep and meaningful talks about life and logic and the controversies of spongebobsquarepants.  I would love that sort of life.  Me and Josh and Jonathan with Carrie and Ruby.

Carrie is so psychadelic.  (now that I know what that word means).  She may be a drug addict but she has the most awesome personality and big red hair!!  I love Ruby, too!  Her new born.  She's a few months old but I can't quite tell.  Ruby is so sharp for her age, though.  Watching and analyzing everything already.  The way she follows my hands but pays more attention to my left.  Jonathan's ambadextrious.  He throws with his right hand and punches you with his left, lol.  But honestly, if he is ambadextrious that would be so awesome.   I want him to stay tiny forever, but I can't wait until him and Ruby can talk to me and share their child-like thoughts.

Okay, I'm always making my enrties so long, lol.  I just have so much to say.  And these thoughts of mine are never ending.  But Abbie wanted the computer tonight and I took it longer than I should have.  Plus, mom will be here in any moment and I won't get paid if I've been sitting at the computer.  

So, thanks for reading, anyone who does.  I need this journal thing...to keep me from killing someone..or myself, lol.

Peace out, holmes.  And I'll try not to cry so much.  I know it freaks people out, it freaks me out too, haha.

Another booooring Saturday at home.  Loved the bomb threat we had at school yesterday.  And then how they let us back in for our last hour.  Authority definitly has it under control here.

I keep playing the same song over and over.  Chasing Cars by Snow Patrol.  Good song.  Mezmerizing lyrics.

I've always wanted to snort something.  Just once, or twice.  I never want to get hooked on one drug.  If ever hooked on anything, I'd choose cigarettes.  They look cool between my fingers.  And they make me feel like a person.  Cocaine looks beautiful.  I've never tried it, don't worry.  But I wan to..desperately.  I'm a rebel at heart...but I'm a rebel with heart.  I know I'd never do cocaine or any other drug for other's sake...but...it's tempting.  And I've been offered cocaine...but always put in on..rain check.  Lol.  Our school is big, and Macon is a druggie's paradise, beside Amsterdam, lol.  But it's expensive, cocaine is.  I wouldn't be able to afford it.  But someday...maybe in the big city...I'll try some.  A new determination.  And I'll never let anyone actually know about it, beside Chris because he understands.  I dunno...cocaine fascinates me.  

I am a Christian.  And I know I'm struggeling...and it's still hard to pick up my bible... Honestly, I feel hatred toward it.  I don't want to be a Christian anymore.  I want to serve God and live a clean holy life and lead others toward Him...but deep deep deep down inside of me...I hate everything about church and religion and the bible and sundayschool and christians and sometimes....sometimes I want to hate God Himself.  But I know I still hold respect and care for Him because I see how I capitilize the H in Him when refering to God.  I'm just dead inside more than anything.  I feel demon possesed sometimes and want to scratch out my eyes.  But I never I do, life is well, and I'm slowly being pulled back into the motions of being a Christian.  

I want to be a person though.  But I've got to look further than what I've been seeing around me.  I've got to look deeper...

Chasing Cars by Snow Patrol


That is possibly the best written lyrics.  Repeat repeat repeat that song in my head and on the speakers.

My head is full of not just that amazing so-me song, but of...that one guy...that makes me spin in the rain, makes me chase the bus, makes me stay awake for hours on end when I need to sleep, makes me want to walk on water, makes me thrive to be a pirate, makes me sing in the shower, makes my heart beat faster in odd places, makes me want to fly, makes me want to fly, makes me want to fly..preferably to him..

He's amazing.  He really gets me..for who I am.  He really knows how I think and feel, and still he claims that I'm so mysterious.  I throw my entire gand canyon of emotions at his feet and all he can say...is how amazing I am.  He's amazing, lol.  He's also obsessed with me.  But it drives me crazy, psychotic, I love him.

Hmmm...

I think I want to start painting.

"event","What a day.  Yet another date that should be recorded.  I test drove my new car today.  I get it Friday and cannot wait.  She's an 88 Dodge.  Red chipped paintjob, the struts are being replaced and the temp. gauge needs fixing.  There are a few tiny rock cracks in the windshield but not bad.  Also the left back door doesn't open at all.  I love her so much.  The first time I set eyes on her I knew we were meant to be together.  I love her so much I keep forgetting I have to share her.  Abbie is such a careless driver, I fear for my baby's life.  She's old and runs a little slower, but she runs and that's all I want from her.  

I know she's got to have a name but I'm just going to let her tell me after I drive her for a while.  But gollie, when I drove her today, at first I was a little tense because I wasn't sure how both of our reactions would be, but instantly I warmed up to her and she ran so smoothly.  Every fiber of me tingled and I couldn't wipe off that goofy smile when my dad wrote that check to buy her.  She was only $700 but we'll have to pay an extra $150 for the struts and gauge.  Less than $900 which we would have had to pay if we had come just a week earlier.  very good deal, I'd say.  I know she's gonna grow on me, I know she will. 

So that's been my day so far.  I watched SAW 2 with Anna and dad.  She shouldn't have watched it.  I know that but what could I have done.  Dad should have been the bigger man and turned it off at the begining when the guy gosh his head busted up and blood spilt everywhere.  What was I supposed to do?  Anyways, I liked it.  I thought the movie had a very good psychological point and the gore just forced me to see it.  Good movie, I thought.  Just not for middle school aged children or anyone younger.  Or Matthew.  I am so paranoid because of scary movies and my imagination is morbid.  I never want my babe to be like that.

I wish Chris would have gotten on.  He's throwing a party at his place tonight.  It's around 10 pm there now so he's probebly drunk and lovin it by now.  Me and Chris have had some pretty deep talks about that stuff.  Parties and all.  I told him I never wanted to see him drunk unless I was drunk.  Which I think sounds like a perfect plan being as I don't drink.  :P

America will prevail to be the most ignorant country but as lost as I've got my dodge to pollute the air with, nothing else matters.  Happy day for me.  Until mom picks me up at 5:00.

"event","I do feel so drained but it's been a good day.  This week was only a 4 school day week but it just seemed to carry on so long.  Donny is such a goof ball.  I know he likes me and for a while I was a little...crushing, I guess.  But I so have my amazing boyfriend.  So when I was writing this guy (my great bf) at school, Donny was standing behind me and I think maybe he saw a little of the email.  Maybe that will back him off a little.  :P
I also was asked out a couple days ago.  Oh, I can't even remember the guys name, all I know is that he is horribly loserishly ugly.  Lol, I don;t want to be mean, it's just...I have my rights, don't I?  I wanted to be nice, I wanted to explain to him that I am TOTALLY taken, lol.  One of his friends came up to me while I was trying to empty my lunch tray in the trashcan and this boy says ""this is from so-n-so, he wants you to go out with him"" and hands me some kind of bling-bling neclace LOL.  Oh how thoughtful, lol.  I just pushed it away, and he like, threw it on my tray and I picked it up and was like ""please, take this.""  He finally took it back but my goodness, what a scene it was.  I felt wierd.  This boy that likes me is a little freshman, lol.  And plus, I'm hott..and, well, he's..not, lol.  He needs to find his little loser place in the world and know who all's in his league because I AM NOT.  lol.  
Gosh, I know I sound like an itch but my goodness.  I was just a little wierded out, lol.  So now everytime I see this kid he gets this broken hearted angry look on his face.  He's probebly one of those kids that'll bring a gun to school or something crazy like that.  I remember being made fun of for being a loser in 5th and 6th grade.  Two years of my life totally in humiliation, lol.  But I can look back now and laugh at myself.  And I'm greatful that happened to me, it really toughened me up and taught me how to make up a good appearance and what-not to become ""popular"". And now I have great friends because I'm clean, I dress nice, good heigene, clean silky hair, great breasts (not that THAT means anything), and I'm just an overall great person to be around.  Okay, maybe I'm being a little cocky but for realz, I do have a good personality and I should be able to have the right to state that.
ANYWAYS, enough about how wonderful I am, lol.  My day today was good.  It has been a while since I've had a good day but today was one of them.  It started out with World History.  Mrs. Sudtholt is my absolute most favorite teacher!  Well, we did this play today ""Antigone"" and I got to play the part of Antigoni.  I did a very well job and I didn't even volunteer for the part. Mrs. Sudtholt was asking who do people think should play the part of the smart allec, outspoken Antigone and I looked around the room and everyone's eyes were on me (i must have turned red) so I kind of slouched in my seat a little and Mrs. Sudtholt goes ""Why THANKYOU Allie!  I knew you'd love to have this part, you can take this chair right up here!""  So I sighed and smiled and grabbed a chair on the ""stage"".  So I played a very well part as Antigone and was very much complimented afterward.  Mrs. Sudholt says to me ""You did a very well job, you are a good actress."" And I go ""it was a little hard being as I'm usually very shy and humbled"" and she says to me ""and NEVER sarcastic""  HAHA.  I loved it.  She makes my day, I swear.  But then the next hour where we are also acting out the crucible playwrite Mrs. Sudtholt came into the room and even boasted to the English teacher that I did a very well job at acting.  I felt very good and appreciated. Yea, it was great.  THEN I had a good lunch, I can't even remember what we ate but we have the most people at our table.  Like 10 people when there should only be five, yea, it's that bad.  Lol.  But we're cool, what can we say.  And I was the last one to arrive at the table (beside Hannah who had already saved her spot, I should start doing that) but I was just going to find somewhere else to sit since there were already enough people sitting at that table but they all were like ""nooo"" and Ryan (hilarious guy and the only straight one at the table) says ""okay, guys, we can do this"" and they all moved around stuff and situated everything and made a spot for me to sit.  yet, ANOTHER moment of speciality.  I was happy. :D
French was great. More me picking on Jesse for ""smoking too much pot"".  He really does though.  Him, Big Jon and Frankie all share a big blunt EVERYDAY before school.  Then they come in all red eyed and spazzin.  Jesse more than anyone though, he's crazy, I love him.  Jon's just hilarious but he's been mean to me lately so I haven't talked to him much.  
ChemCom was as fine as science gets, lol.  I actually paid attention, took my notes, and didn't zonk out.  I finally understand what a compound is, lol.  And she let me look at my grade.  It's still a D but it's 64% now so it is coming up.  Just...slowly, lol.  I got a B on my test but it's because I cheated off of Jenn.  She said it was fine. She's just as dumb as I am except she listens more.  I have a hard time doing that because the teacher talks to us like we're kidnagardnrs.  haha, I can't even spell the word.  Maybe I need to be spoken to like that, lol.  Anywho, prgress in that class.  Played some more basketball in PE which I LOVE.  I love getting hot and sweaty and stinky and run run run up and down the court and stealin the ball pass it to a mate get it back make and shot and SCORE!  The adrenaline I get from basketball is amazing.  I know I should have stuck with it and I would kill to try out this year but I'm not nearly as good to make the team and I would be crushed when rejected.  Yea, that's my story, lol.  But basketball is great and that game made the day a little better too.  Math sucks as usual, lol.  But I did do my work when I wasn't ""zoning out"" and the teacher didn't yell at me today.  Yea, me and her don't get along, and she's supposed to be the lady over FCA (Fellowship of Christian Athletes) and I was going to join but I'm not sure because I don't want my clean 5 dollar bill (dues) to be put in her old cranky lady hand.  Man, I am horrible.  
Then I ended my day with a great class of Accounting.  I hate the work in that class.  To much math even though it's ""only"" addition and subtraction. Trust me, if you're dumb in school, addition and subtraction is hard enough.  But I love that teacher.  Mrs. Shoemaker.  She's great, and we have a good time.  
With all that, I got on the bus, didn't have to listen to constant swearing and boobage talk, but instead listened to a little Metallica before my batteries died, then I talked to Brandon and Felicia, great people (except Felicia smells gross and she can swear a lot but I didn't hear anything today).  Brandon invited me to his church thing on Friday.  I don't even know what he's talking about but I might go see what it's all about.  He goes to the Crossroas Christian church out by the new Pizza Hut.  So, I might go check it out.  
I really just don't want to see Josh Stucci ever again.  I never want to hear about him or talk to him and see him ever again.  Who can you trust if you can't trust Josh (youth pastor and very good friend, I thought).  His divorce is really killing me inside.  I often questioned if maybe that's one of the reasons I've felt so dead and it is.  He means so much to me..andd he has lied so many times.  My own youth pastor, taking his baby away from his own wife.  Yea, Christina (wife..soon to be..not wife) had to beg to see Jonathan (1 year old baby, being effected by this just as much as I am).  She gets him on Friday and keeps him until Monday morning.  HER BABY!  He sucks he sucks he sucks.  I don't care if that's like swearing, he makes me so mad.  I love him so much, I looked up to him, he was my mentor, I hung on to every word he ever said.  How much of it was real.  I don't even know him now, I don't even want to know him.  I cry too much.
I'm not going to let that ruin my day though.  Today was great and even greater being as I got to talk to my AMAZING boyfriend a little bit before he went to CHURCH.  See, how awesome is that.  No one gets a guy that great.  I'm lucky.  And I'll be cocky about him as much as I am myself, if not even more.  I love being with my bf.  I can't WAIT until I get my car.  As soon as I turn 16 I'll be permitted by my mother to go out on group dates really.  But she knows how much of a good christian boy Matthew is (even though sometimes she does get paranoid about us having sex, but usually not because of him but because of me :P) but anywho, not the point, lol.  I'm sure she wouldn't mind if me and him went out to the lake together and chilled.  OOH, I can't wait to see him again.  I miss him sooo very much. And I know he misses me too.  Like he hasn't mentioned it enough, lol.  I know I keep saying ""next weekend, next weekend, we'll see, maybe, we'll see, sometime soon, I promise I promise""  But it's been forever, my fault I know. 
I guess I have been a little afraid lately.  I know I've been edgy, and Josh's divorce hasn't made things easier.  My mom's three divorces hurt enough..why another one.  Why another one so close to my heart?  It's hurting, it really is.  And I hate being around Matt when I'm hurting.  Cuz I don't want to be touched or spoken softly to when I'm angry or upset.  I want to be shooken, I want to be hit...I want to sleep mostly, and cry, a lot.  I don't ever want Matt to try to help me, it makes me feel needy.  Which my mother's been accused of being so I'm trying to stay away from that.  
Wow, I talk/type way too much, lol.  I do.  But it makes me who I am and I love who I am....most of the time.  Sometimes, I do get a little self conscience about how much I talk, but really it's good to get stuff out. And this is my journal.  Don't ever feel like you have to read this, I know it must get boring.  So, I'll stop now, lol.  Mom's home and will be kicking me off soon anyway.
LOVE LOVE LOVE.  I'm not entirely dead, not entirely ""zoned out"".  :P

"event","Okay, so I'm sitting in my desk in EnglishII, and it was a free read day so I've got my nose in this pretty good book called ""Catalyst"".  So anyway, I read a while, then sang in my head, then read a little more, then sang in my head.  And I don't know why I'm doing this because I really was trying to finish that book.  My thoughts are spuratic (sp?).  They come and go, and most of them are pointless.  
So, I didn't finish my book and I got in trouble for ""zoning out"".
Also, it sucks.  My thoughts in the hallway, it's just not me.  I think like I'm writing a book.  But then I start thinking about the pace I'm walking.  And I thought on the pace for like 30 seconds.  Then I was a little closer to the ChemCom door and about to go in when I start thinking about how wierd it was to be thinking about the pace.  And I'll walk through the halls and unless my mind is totally blank (never) I'll be thinking in sentences that you'd read in a book.  Like ""His shirt's green, and it reminds me of puke.  have you ever seen someone elses puke?  I did once at a party.""  YEA.  I'll be thinking all that, like I'm talking to someone.  Telling them about my hallway experiences.  haha, I know I sound stupid.  But I do this everyday.  Maybe I read too much.  Maybe I'm not satisfied with reality so I'm putting myself in this whole nother world, where I control everyone.  Everyone is under my power.  Booya.
I don't know.  I think too much.  Too much on if this is real or not.  One thing I thought up is if the higher forces JUST NOW put us on earth.  With a memory of childhood and everything.  Like JUST NOW.  or....NOW.  With memory and everything happening.  Does that make sense?  I don't know, just another pointless thought.  Or if we saw ourselves differently in the mirror than what other people saw.  And I've talked to Amy (19 aged aunt) about that.  if we were entirely different people than what we think we are.  If everything we said was totally different to everyone else.  You could be leading a perfectly normal good life.  But in everyone elses eyes, in their own little world, they see you as some psyched out criminal or something.  I don't know, yet another pointless thought.
Tomorrow is the ASVAB test for sophomores.  It's suppose to be the test that tells what career would be best for you.  Everyone says it's boring and they hated it and all, but I'm excited.  I really am.  I've always wondered just what career would be just right for me.  I mean, I'm not very good at a lot of stuff.  And the stuff I am good at, I don't want to do for a living or it's not aloud to be done for a living.  If I could make money by writing in a journal everyday, I'd do it.  But I can't.  And I don't want to work at Taco Bell the rest of my life.  Which is where I'll be working starting March.  if not there, then I don't know where.  I don't want to work at McDonalds though.  Too fattening, and my x works there.  Taco Bell, I know a guy that works there.  He's pretty cool and would give a good word for me.  I don't know, I just need a job.  And a car, I have NO patience.
I wasted my money.  I could have spent it on something better.  Like my FCA dues.  I got 5 dollars from my pops.  Instead of putting it toward something useful like tithing, or dues for FCA, I got junk food.  Junk food.  That sucks.  But this pepsi is good.  I think I'll let mom pay for my FCA dues though.  My dad paid last year and if mom finds out I've been skipping the meetings she'll have a cow.  A cow.
Ya know, I had a stuffed cow.  For years, then this guy Derrick murdered it.  It was my fault for taking him to school but it really sucked I loved that cow.  There are a lot of things I love.  Like stuffed animals.  I'm really attached to this black bear one of my girlfriends bought me.  I know a girl, and she's always flirting with this guy that sits next to us in Math.  And I always get jealous.  But I never know if I'm getting jealous of him or her.  Lol.  That sounds wierd, but the more me and her talk...the more I sort of...start to like her.  Okay, sorry for grossin you out, Matthew.  I'll go read my bible now.
Ya know, church is a kind of funny place to be.  And most people think Christians or anyone who goes to church is supposed to be perfect, so when they mess up (like humans do, and that's a song).  
Yea, I just totally lost track of what I was getting at.
Maybe I'm on crack.  And I deny it in my head because it's messed me up so bad.  I've had a lot of dreams about me being on crack and all.  But it makes me deny it in reality.  Can you smoke dream crack?
It takes me so long to write these things.  I mean, not even because it is a long post, but because I stop and ""zone out"" every five sentences.  Sometimes I can get a whole paragraph in before time runs out.  My friends at school have caught it.  Me ""zoning out"".  I don't know why I do that to it.  ""zoning out"" the little wee wee things on each side.  Just looked cool when I did it.  Like someone else said it.  It's just me.
""zoning out""
:P
Kind of funny.  I get letter things from NotReligion.com and this one is called ""Reality Check"".  I guess God knew I needed one of them.
I'm really not as bad off as I make myself sound.  I'm not losing it, my mom wouldn't allow it.  I'm not going psycho, I'm too self conscious for that to happen.  And I am not on crack (or a whore).  I'm just bored, with all this.  I just want to drive.  I can't wait, I want to drive so bad.  With a cigarette hangin out my mouth, no one to stop me, no one.  Me and Hope used to steal cigarettes for us and her mom.  And she never got mad and I always felt good about myself for doing that.  Like I did a good deed for someone, gettin her some cigs from the store.  Today, me and hope stole some candy from the shack at school.  It was easy, and quick and simple, and we wanted it, so we just...took it.  I don't even feel bad about it.  I said I did and in my head I'm like ""that was wrong, Allie"" but I really don't feel anything.  Maybe I'm going to hell....for real.
Last time I talked to God...I told Him I hated Him.  I told Him He wasn't fair.  I told Him sorry and that He's a just God.  I asked Him not to strike me down.  I told Him I was confused.  I told Him to strike me down.  I told Him I took it back.  I told Him I didn't believe in Him.  i told Him it would be easier without Him there.  I told Him he was there.  I told Him to let me live.  I asked Him to let me live.  I told Him I was sick of living.  
I cry a lot.
Sorry, for rambling, just got a LOT on my mind.  Only one person is reading this.  I'm sorry to you too.  What is wrong with me.  I swear.  Like I usually don't slip.  I usually swear when I mean it and mean it.  But today, I said a a word with hole at the end.  I told a guy he wasn't one.  And then I thought, and I was like, oopse. I just swore, out loud.  And sometimes I swear online, like typing it.  It sounds worse when it's said out loud.  
Sometimes, like right now, I'm scared to death that God's gonna strike me down.  I know He can...and I feel like He's not too fond of me.  Cuz I'm constantly questioning and driving myself crazy.  And I'll be so fulfillingly devout to Him one week, then claiming atheism the next.  It's wierd.  And crackish.  And challenging and annoying.  I wish God would just tell me I've had enough then take me home....to Heaven of course.  Because, hell is not a home.  It sounds and IS horrible.  I don't want to go there, even if Heaven is boring, I don't want to end up in hell.  I really don't want to end up in hell.  really don't.
I've noticed that I repeat myself a lot.  I don't know if that a new taken on bad habit, or if it's because I never feel heard and deep inside I know that and so unconsciously I repeat myself a few more times than I should.  I know I shouldn't talk so much.
I know I shouldn't think so much.
Matthew, I wanna makeout with you.  But not for natural just wing it reasons, so don't makeout with me.  Well, unless you want to.  I just feel like, if I makeout with you...I'll be like..deflowering you, LOL. I'm sorry.  I know you're not perfect, I know that.
What makes us who we are.  Why am I the way I am.  Matthew is my boyfriend if anyone else ever decides to finish this looooong journal entry.  (doubted).  Matthew, he's great.  And he knows exactly what I need at exactly the right time.  Even if I think not, it is so.  I really feel for him.  It's been how long together?  I've lost track.  Not too long, not too short.  Long summer with you.  Never madeout.  It's coming up though, I feel it.  Me getting a car in a few months.  Just a few months and we'll be at the lake together, with taco bell and chocolate, yum.  Me and you, boy.  And guess what, you're hott.  Even with the low self esteem.
I should go to sleep.  But Corey said he wants to talk.  Nah, I said to him I wanted to talk.  I'm really just waiting for my mom to pull up so I can quickly exit out of everything and act like I've been asleep for the last hour or so.  She hates coming home to see me still on the comp.  Especially since that's where I've been since she left 3 hours ago.  And I've only been doing a couple things.  Writing this entry, talking to Corey, and occasionally clicking over to my hotmail to see if Chris has sent me anything yet.

"event","My mom.  Gosh.  She is definitly not like other moms.  And maybe that's why I'm like the way I am today.  Not like other girls at school, or anywhere for that matter.  I am different, and it makes me feel like an outcast even if I do have tons of friends who say they love me.  I just never know who I really am.  Or if I am who I really am and just trying to put myself in denial by saying I'm not who I was and am.  Who knows, I'm probebly just digging myself a little more deeper than I should.  
Anyway, wow, I got way off track, haha.  Me and my mom were talking last night.  Yea, every month when we're closer to our cycles we get all emotional and have a late night girl talk about everything that's everything.  Well, last night we talked a lot on her love life and how it's effected us kids.  (there's 9 of us)  Anywho, I realized something last night that I had to admit to myself and my mom.  That my mom's last divorce, really affected me.  In ways I can't explain.
I miss him.  They were married 5 years, his name's Curtis.  And he's married to this new Baribe named Kim.  It's been almost 4 years since the divorce but it feels like he just traded us in for a new better family.  I'm hurt, and last night...I cried a lot.  My mom also admited to still being in love with him...after all these years.  I cried so much.  More than I should have.
It was a good cry.  At least I know I can still feel emotions, lol.  I'm just exaggerating really.  I mean, I have a lot of crap in my head.  So when I try to get it out, I try to make it sound more ineresting, it's really not.  
Maybe someday, someday far from now, I'll learn not to talk so much.  I'll learn how to hold my tongue.  That'll come in handy when I'm married (if ever).

"event","I've felt like a blob all day.  Disformed, discolored, misplaced...blob.  I'm moving along with the motions.  Wake, shower, dress, eat, church, home, eat.  I watched a movie with my mother today.  Can't remember the title but it was about terrorism.  My mom wants to save the muslims as well as the whole world.  How could I ever help..when I feel like such a misfit?
I never want to shove anything down anyone's throat.  Not politics, not religion, not food.  I think everyone should have an open mind about everything.  The posibilities are extremely varied.  I'm trying, I really am.
Church, wow, church.  I wish my attention span was longer.  We went to the MEGA church today.  Big church, big people, big music, big WORD OF GOD.  I like sitting there, in church I mean.  I like listening to the old people sing songs of praise.  I like watching the preacher pace the floor while shouting out ""Jesus IS here today!""  or ""Have YOU accepted HIM as YOUR LORD AND SAVIOR?!""  I like the tones in their voices.  It's like they have all the confidence in the world, but they know that more than half the people are in their zone, and what they're saying is going in one ear and out the other.  
It's kind of sad when you really sit down and think about it.  These people spend their whole lives deticated to one thing and one thing only.  Whether it be God, church, missions, etc...they are truly devout.  I wonder if I could ever be so devoted to one thing.

"event","I hate first posts.  I get so nervous.  Like I'm going to mess up or something.  

Well, I'm 15 years old.  I'll be 16 in March.  It's coming up and I'm dying for that license and my new dodge.  Once I can drive myself to where I want to be (school,work, dad's, etc.) life will be much more fulfilling.  Right now, I just feel useless.  Stale.  With a car and money, life will make more sense.

I am a teen of faith.  I mean, I know that there's a God.  I do believe in the Christian God but in my faith I know that just believing isn't enough.  Heaven and Hell seem so far away right now, but you never know, you really don't.  I get so bored thinking about that stuff.

I listen to music.  Lots of music, I love it.  Metallica mostly.  Metallica is the athiest's god, lih.  If I didn't live with such a controlling mother, Metallica would be blasting in my ears 24/7.  I'm also in love with Norway.  I know a guy that lives there and he said to come down anytime.  I'm planning to visit there after graduation in 149 weeks.  Maybe even move there, who knows.  Gots to save some money first before decisions like that.

I love my family.  I love my friends.  But most things seem so faded anymore.  I wish I was a little more alive.  But I'm too lazy to do anything to actually make that happen.  I'm just too lazy.

I'm sure in a few years, things will have changed.  A lot of things.  And life will be better when I have a car to get away whenever I want to.  School will save me from home, work will save me from school, and the lake will save me from everything.  When I get my car, the lake will be where you'll find me.  Writing poetry or snapping pictures.  The lake will give me peace.  Some kind of version of it.

Peace

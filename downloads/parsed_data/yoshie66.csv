"event","In New York, there is a real problem with homeless people. They are now such big a problem that Major Bloomburg is willing to pay bus fair in order to send them anywhere else they may want to go. Well, thanks to Obama claiming that Vegas was an evil place and that companies should never book trips there, there are now a huge number of empty hotels. So, why not send the homeless people to Vegas and they can stay in all the empty rooms. Plus, Mayor Bloomburg appears deadly afraid of guns, so lets give all the guns to the homeless before they leave for Vegas... because in Vegas you are allowed to have guns. Maybe the homeless people will be so irresponsible that they will kill each other with the guns - solving the homeless problem, and the gun problem, and proving Mayor Bloomburg's claims about how dangerous guns are, except in another far away state! - Glen Beck (Paraphrased)"

"event","Back in October 2008 during the peak of the election season, our kids asked us who we were voting for. They each had been in an assembly that day in school to discuss the president, voting, and why it was important. We regularly spoke about who we liked and why, as well as who we didn&rsquo;t like and why so they knew exactly where we stood. <br /><br /><lj-cut>Well, both kids came home one day with basically the same story &ndash; that Mr. Obama was the best candidate, and that everyone loved him and would vote for him if they were able. This confused our kids, as neither of their parents felt this way about such a wonderful guy. We sat them down and explained to them like this:<br /><br />It&rsquo;s Halloween time. You decide to maximize your candy collecting this year by walking up and down many of the streets in the neighborhood ahead of time. You figure out the best way to get to each house, how to approach them, and cross off ones with dangers like barking dogs to dark yards. You make maps of what streets to walk, how fast, and which ones aren&rsquo;t worth visiting because there aren&rsquo;t many houses on those streets or the people are just out of town. You spend a week figuring out what costume to wear in order to amaze your friends and make it entirely by hand. When the big night comes, you cannot be more prepared and it pays off &ndash; you wind up with a huge pile of candy of every type and color. At the end of the night, a man comes to the house and tells you that for every two pieces of candy you have he will take one and you have no choice. When you ask him why, he says that this candy will be going to all of those kids who didn&rsquo;t feel like going out for Halloween &ndash; it was too cold, or too much walking&hellip; or they didn&rsquo;t feel like making costumes. But they deserve to have candy as much as you and since you have plenty, the man has come to take their share.<br /><br />At this point, both of my kids are wide-eyed and on the edge of tears. Why do lazy kids deserve to get their hard earned candy? My son even comments that if he was sick and could not go out for Halloween he would be sad, but wouldn&rsquo;t expect candy to just show up&hellip; so why would anyone else? The next day they each share this story with their classmates, who all agreed that giving to anyone who doesn&rsquo;t work hard is crazy and that if that is what Mr. Obama is planning, then they refuse to ever vote for him or anyone like him.<br /><br />:)</lj-cut><br />"

"event","Saw &quot;Monsters vs Aliens&quot; in eye-popping 3D with our kids today. Of the experience, I have two reviews:<br /><br /><lj-cut>Review 1: The movie was pretty good. We went to the IMAX theater near us (big screen, comfy seats). The story was very simple - girl gets hit by rock, is turned into giant. Aliens want what made her that way. Girl saves everyone. Very funny cast (it's from the Shrek people, so no surprise there).Plus, the 3D technology they used was much smoother than those of other recent films - I remember the inserted &quot;breaks&quot; from 3D all through &quot;Sharkboy and Lavagirl&quot; and &quot;Spy Kids 3&quot; due to the glasses causing migraines. I noticed nothing like that this time. Also, unlike most 3D which just looks like sheets of flat paper at different distances, this film has actual depth.. very slick.<br /><br />Review 2: Now, the theater scene was a whole different thing. See, I haven't been to a movie in a theater environment in about a year (my last film was &quot;Prince Caspian&quot; on opening day) so I haven't really been exposed to the ticket &quot;sticker shock&quot; in a while. Well, let me tell you... for six people, the ticket cost was $45.75. Then, because the film was in 3D, they attached a &quot;service charge&quot; to cover the glasses. Another $25. But wait, we have kids, so I have to hit the snack stand as well. Three medium drinks and two large popcorns... try another $35. Yep, if you are adding up everything, we're already over $100.. for six people!! WTF?! I've been hearing a lot in the news that the movie theater industry is in trouble, and may need a bailout very soon. If this is how they recoup for the BS paychecks (unless you sh*t gold bricks, there's nothing you can do that's worth $40 million for a two hour movie.. sorry) they've been handing movie stars as of late, I say let them fail. I could have picked up a dozen movies for the kids for less than what we paid today. Do these people not realize that?<br /><br />Overall, everyone had a good time and of course it didn't hurt that the movie was really good. But just like last year, it'll be my last box office visit for the year. On my way home, I picked up a dozen new releases at Blockbuster and I can already her my comfy, rude patron-free couch a calling me home..</lj-cut>"

"event","Every day that passes now, I&nbsp;feel more and more disgust. What ever happened to the great uniter, who was going to bring the country together?&nbsp;He did get elected, right? I'm no longer so sure. Where is the country I&nbsp;grew up in, where neighbors were neighbors and if I&nbsp;needed help, there was a line out the door ready to lend a hand. What happened to US against them, not us against... ourselves... and what is this crap with double standards?

Bush sends troops to Iraq, he is a war criminal. Obama sends troops to Afganistan, he is a savior.

Under Bush, Guantanamo Bay is a chamber of horrors where men are treated like animals or worse. Under Obama, the very same place is humane? Hell, if I&nbsp;went by what the news says, prisoners are now begging to be sent there. Funny, since absolutely nothing has changed.

Bush pisses away over $400 billion.. he's the devil. Obama pisses away twice that.. he's the next coming of Christ. BTW, not one of those in our government has read more than two pages of the latest pork sausage bill that Obama just put his name to. And I'm supposed to be happy about this?

And on and on. I'd like to see a whole lot more US (since we are all in this together, much to the dismay of so many) and a whole lot less ME&nbsp;ME&nbsp;ME and this business about taking of each other's stuff, and other entitlement BS. Screw stuff. I'm willing to turn over every last cent I have now as well as all I will make for the forseeable future in order to put things right (and absolutely not to fill the pocket of just one more f'ing two-faced politician), are you?

Anyone who actually believes Obama's plan is good idea needs to be committed - rewarding hard work and planning by taking away what is earned to give to the guy who sits on his ass all day watching TV is pure insanity.&nbsp; Create more jobs?&nbsp;I&nbsp;don't think so. This way of thinking will actually result in significantly fewer jobs (because every new job = more taxes to the companies and why work when everyman is rewarded the most for doing the least).. and very likely lower paying jobs at that, since someone has to cover all the additional money the &quot;rich&quot;&nbsp;companies will be forced to pay - and we all know it won't be them.<br /><br />&quot;<span class=""sense_break""><span class=""sense_break""><span class=""sense_break""><span class=""sense_content"">[...] distinguished by unequal distribution of goods and pay according to work done.&quot; - <a href=""http://mw1.m-w.com/dictionary/socialism"">Socialism</a>, Merriam-Websters Dictionary</span></span></span></span><br /><br />&quot;We Conservatives can claim to have foreseen, predicted and explained this collapse almost from the beginning, when socialism was merely an intellectual theory. But the more it was put into practice, the more we could point out its inevitable flaws and inherent unworkability. In the 1970s we saw this failure in a system of high taxation and suffocating regulation that discouraged hard work, deterred enterprise and imposed stagflation on our economies. In the 1980s we saw this failure in an educational system that couldn't teach all children the essentials of language, maths and civic virtues. And today we see this failure in a welfare system that keeps millions of people hooked on dependency.&quot; - <strong><a href=""http://www.reagansheritage.org/html/reagan_luce_thatcher.shtml""> Claire Boothe Luce Lecture</a> - Margaret Thatcher (September 23, 1991)</strong></lj-cut><strong><br /></strong></lj-cut><br />Socialism has been tried over and over around the world throughout history and every single time it has not only failed horribly, but also destroyed whole civilizations in it's wake. While I agree that Obama does put forth some interesting ideas which could bring positive change to our floundering country, his (along with all those tricked into believing that what he plans is &quot;positive&quot; in any way, shape, or form) willingness to embrace a system of society that will absolutely (and provably) bring about the very end of everything we all know and love is the only reason needed to toss this dirt bag out of not only the presidential race but also every other position he now or will ever hold in our government. If you honestly believe this is the way we need to go, I recommend you tear your fat ass off the couch long enough to read about any of the dozens of nations now in ruin from believing as you do. At the very least, take some of the free health care that you're about to receive and use it to get your head examined.<br />"

"event","As expected, THE HAPPENING has done less than stellar in the theaters. While I'm not big on killer trees, I have no real complaints about this or any of M. Knight's films. I think the reason for his continuted failure to recapture audience attention has to do with the content of said films and the state of our nation. Just look at the <a href=""http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?view2=worldwide&amp;yr=2008&amp;p=.htm "">kind of movies</a> that are grossing big right now - nearly all are action packed, dreamy romance, or fantasy epics. <br /> <br />Each of M. Night's films leaves the viewer with truckloads to think about long after the final credits have rolled (one of the best part of seeing his films imho), but that's just not what theater goers are looking for right now. I see his problem being that the majority of folks still willing to pay for the theater experience aren't looking for ""brain food"", they are looking for escape. They want iron-clad, hulking green, arrow shooting, whip cracking fantasy worlds where they don't have to think about the next terrorist attack or who's the least likely to ruin the country after the next presidential election. And sadly, the high quality and robust flavor of meat packed into M. Night's films matters very little with an audience that's gone vegan."

"event","<i>&gt; What Would You Like To See?<br /><br /></i>What I really liked about the original film was how the humans and dinosaurs were able to co-exist to a degree, in the modern world. Ok, most of them were locked in cages, but there were buildings and the technology that we are all so familiar with (who didn't want their own Trike after seeing the sick one in JP up close?). They touched again on this for a very short time at the end of JP2 when the T-Rex is running wild through San Diego (by far the best part of the movie, imho). Without the stark contract of dinosaurs interacting with our modern world, the second and especially the third films were little more than limp shadows of the original. <br /> <br />I'd prefer to see JP4 bringing us back into the modern world (rather than just another jaunt through the jungle), perhaps with humans realizing that dinosaurs are there to stay and instead of trying to contain/kill them, we see them in zoos, used as work animals (police on gallimimus-back?) or as pets? Then just when people are used to seeing them everywhere, the dinos start to become sick or even die off. The movie could focus on why this is happening. Is it related to the cloning that brought them back in the first place? Is it related to what drove them to extinction the first time? Lots of room for science, lots of room for action, and nothing like the other sequels.<br /><br />Originally posted <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0369610/board/thread/108084616?d=108846574&amp;p=2#108846574"">here</a>."

Over on the Republican side, we've got the war hero John McCain. Yes, I agree that he's a hero.. but wait, why is he running as a conservative Republican? The guy is nearly as liberal in everything he believes as Satan herself. So why is he suddenly the front runner for a party that won't even vote for him - yep, 85% of registered Republicans have said flat out that they will not vote for the guy, so what gives? Who else is going to fail so utterly that the Democrats are literally guaranteed a win..

<lj-cut>Meanwhile, over in the Democrat camp all hell is breaking loose. While at first Hillary was the obvious front runner, that is no longer so. In fact, Obama and Billary are nearly equal in delegates with no chance of a tie-breaker via the tiny number of delegates that are left. So the final decision is going to come down to the mighty Super-Delegates. Will they place their votes with Obama.. and steal away the chances for the first woman president (along the way losing the female vote)? Or, will they place their votes with Billary... and steal away the chances for the first African-American president (and kiss goodbye the minority vote in the process). With choices like this, the Democratic party is just about ready to implode. Funny, how both candidates continue to claim to be ""uniters"" when in reality they are everything but... 

The more I watch Punch & Judy going at it in debate, the more I think the real plan is to bring in Al Gore in the final hour to save the day (and believe me, he would.. hell, with the choices we have now, I'd even consider voting for him).

For a very short time in 1987, our school bus driver had an AM/FM radio installed on her bus (basically, she'd mounted small speakers on the front wall of the bus and connected them to a small boom-box next to her on the floor) - which she was nice enough to play each day during her regular runs. A few days later, the song ""Pour Some Sugar On Me"" first began regular rotation on pretty much every radio station (for those who don't remember, it was HUGE during the summer of 1987). An awesome song by one of the best rock bands of the 1980s (IMHO anyway). I saved every penny, nickel, and dime I found on the ground from that day on, until I had the $12.00 needed to buy ""Hysteria"".. the first album I ever owned."

On the surface, I agree that it sounds like good idea and arguments that 16-17 year olds can volunteer to go to Iraq to fight, or drive a car seem to back it further... yet, I think the real reasoning behind this is far more sinister. I see it as little more than a means for Democrats to gain more votes, especially now that it looks like any hope of getting those valued illegal immigrant votes is not going to happen. Historically, it's the poor and oppressed that vote for Democrats... can you think of a group that's poorer or more oppressed than 16-17 year olds?"

I find this to be very unusual because we don't see too many raccoons around my house. So I'm staring at this ""stranger in a strange land""... enthralled not only by it's willingness to be seen out in the open lie this, but also because the thing was actually managing to keep pace with my car (I was barely doing 15MPH, but still). I looked over at it, it looked back... and so it went for about a mile. Then it was over, as the beastie veered off into the woods and was gone. Even a day later, it still seems so surreal.

"event","A few days back, I got involved in a disagreement about the pledge and it's ""under God"" content. While I personally don't see what the big deal is, I can understand how it might bother those of certain religions that worship [fill in the blank] instead of ""God"" and wish to not speak that portion of the pledge. I see our country's pledge as part of an American tradition that really has nothing to do with religion and everything to do with patriotism. So others don't.. clearly there's room to debate.

<lj-cut>On May 8, another bill (""The Easter Bunny Bill"") surfaced in my state that has to do alot to do with religion in school that came to be soon after Schools Supt. William Rearick of Tiverton (RI) prohibited a parents group from sponsoring a photo booth featuring the Easter Bunny as a fundraiser at a middle school craft fair. Instead, Peter Rabbit attended, which angered quite a few people. The bill is still under consideration, so I'm not going to get into details about it here. If you're curious, an article about it can be found <a href=""http://www.projo.com/news/content/BUNNY_9_05-09-07_3B5IMQD.343abf5.html"">here</a>.

All of the recent talk about ""God"", religion, and school has me concerned because it really feels like the beginning of a much bigger issue. Ok fine, let's eliminate every last drop of religion from public schools - I hate to tell you folks, but it's pretty much done already. What's next, putting an end to Halloween or Christmas all together? After all, if it can't be displayed in schools, why would it be ok to display it at the mall, or on television? Where is it going to end? 

There in lies my problem: so many of the holidays that are now celebrated in the US were originally founded for religious reasons, but have since mutated far beyond that (with Easter, Halloween, and Christmas being the biggest examples). Yes, there is still a small amount of religion attached to them, but there is also a huge amount of tradition... American tradition. I was raised Catholic, but have since stopped practicing, because I no longer feel that it does anything for me (enough about that already). I still celebrate most of the holidays though, because my family always has.. and so do 99% of those around me. It pains me to see how just because a small percentage of the public is unhappy, they feel the need to ruin it for the rest of us, by trying to take away that tradition... and over of petty religious differences of all things. 

Is there really no reason why the various holidays can't co-exist? Why set about destroying what we have, especially with all of this talk about diversity when what we really need is more holidays, not less... a melding of cultures, not alienation. What happened to the days when we all used to just get along?</lj-cut>"

"event","First, it was well worth the $38 I spent to see it (tickets for the afternoon show were over $10 each!!!) and our theater was lucky enough to be able to show it in high-def (absolutely the ONLY way to see it!) Now onto the comments:

<b>The Story</b>: The movie was paced oddly for some reason. The first 45 minutes were very fast, and full of action. Then, the story sort of ""crapped out"" and got very depressing. I actually think that were they to simply cut this part of the movie out (from when Harry lost his memory to when Peter started acting aggressive), it would have made little difference. Plus, my kids were very bored towards the middle of the movie... leading me to think that they might have missed part of their target audience (easily more than half of the audience in the theater with us yesterday were under 10).

<lj-cut><b>The Characters</b>: I felt that they might have gone a little overboard with three (well, 2.5) villains. The thing about it was, unlike The Sandman who turned out to be crazy (this is a good thing), and Venom who had nowhere near enough screen time, I didn't think that Harry brought much to the story. Ok, he tormented Peter towards the middle of the movie, which was needed to pull off the evil costume story, but still... most of the scenes involving Harry were drawn out and dry. As supporting cast goes, Bryce Howard as Gwen Stacy (is it me, or has she put on some serious weight since ""Lady in the Water?"") was a welcome addition as MJ's rival and Bruce Campbell was a riot. I was a little sad that James Cromwell didn't get more on-screen time. The guy is a legend.

<b>The Effects</b>: Another thing... I think Hollywood has about reached the limits with the CGI. There were some fantastic scenes (the fight between Harry and Spiderman between the buildings, and most of the Sandman stuff) in the movie to be sure, but ultimately, so much CGI was used that it made the movie feel ""cartoon-like"", especially towards the end. Plus, the Venom shots with Brock's human face looked terrible. While I do like a bit of creative license when it comes to filming technique, some of hand-held camera shots were choppy (the worst being when the cops found Sandman in the dump truck) and very amateur looking for such a high-budget film.

<b>Plot Holes</b>: The worst part about the movie was all the plot holes. Lots of stuff happened (or didn't happen) that really made no sense. Take the scene where Spiderman rescues Gwen. He arrives to find a crane falling off a building, and tearing apart another building across the street (the one with Gwen in it) as it does. So Spiderman goes in, rescues Gwen from sudden death, and then leaves. What about the crane? 

Or the Venom costume - they introduce the fact that the costume was actually an alien early in the film, along with it's symbiotic need to stay attached to it's ""host"" at all times.. yet the costume spends a large chunk of the film in a trunk. Wtf?

Overall, the movie was great. I just wish that if they plan on spending so much money on a movie that it soooo long (2 hours, 33 minutes) and so anticipated, that they would at least do the audience a favor and watch it a few times before it goes out. Sam Raimi is great with the comedy (lots of very funny scenes in the film, including an excellent one with Bruce Campbell) but when it comes to heart-wrenching drama... he needs a little help.

My two cents.</lj-cut>"

"event","I opted to take the kids to the special preview of ""The Last Mimzy"" today (they've been talking about wanting to see it for months). It's surely amazing how we manage to forget the important things... like how much of an production it is to take two kids to a movie. Good grief! Thankfully, I didn't have to kill anyone this trip (not that the option wasn't considered several times), because I'm running out of places to hide all the bodies. =)

<lj-cut>The movie was pretty good, and the kids seemed to love it (along with the thirty or so other kids in the theater - it was nearly all kids). Sadly, it could have been better. The movie was peppered with problems and a dozen things that were never explained (like what was up with the boy being able to open wormholes). 

In a nutshell, the movie was about a future civilization that managed to corrupt their genes to the point where they'd lost their humanity. In an attempt to save the race one engineer sent back a series of living dolls (humans could not travel in time as it would kill them) called ""Mimzy"", along with several devices (to the kids, these looks like ""Star Trek""-type gadgets, while adults only saw rocks... also never explained) that were to be used to send ""uncorrupted"" DNA back to the future. After having all of his previous attempts fail, the engineer sent one final doll back. It gets found by a girl and her brother while they are on Easter vacation at a beach house. Over the next week, the devices appear to unlock potential in the two children (it's never really explained what's going on with this or why) that eventually allow them to build a wormhole to the future and send the last Mimzy there (with a single teardrop from the girl as the sample of DNA). In a 20-second montage, the future is saved and so on...

The kids end up doing lots of cool things thanks to the effects of the device, including talking to spiders and opening wormholes. Unfortunately, the director  thought that including all these effects (""Intel"" etched on the computer parts of Mimzy) would cover up the many plot holes... like why the kids went 80+ miles to their beach cottage, yet ended up at the same school several times over the vacation week. Or what the point of the ""looking glass"" was, because having the girl see into the future never really did anything for the story (this was supposedly related to Alice from ""Alice in Wonderland"" who also had a Mimzy). One thing I thought was cool was the theme of technology in the present as a way to show how we become corrupted, but other than showing a ton of scenes containing video games, iPods, Blackberries, and a home with plasma TVs in every room, the theme never really went anywhere  - too bad for a decent setup.

The movie is based on a 1943 short story called ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mimsy_were_the_borogoves"">Mimsy were the Borogoves</a>"", which appears to explain many of the film's plot holes.</lj-cut>"

"event","<i><b>HOLLYWOOD</b> - Executives of the ""Big Three"" networks got together this past weekend for what can only be called a ""summit"", in an effort to find solutions to help curb the rising costs of producing new shows each season and the demand for bigger and better stories and effects by the viewing audience. Nina Tassler, one of the network executives at CBS said Sunday, ""We have reached a time where effects simply cannot compete with audience expectations."" Concerns have been raised about the cost to produce a show that is likely to die during focus group testing anyway, or after two to three episodes have aired. ""They drop off the TV as fast as they air..."" said Dawn Tissuck, head of Market Research for ABC's New York branch.
  In an effort to bring the cutting edge in storytelling into each and every home, all new shows in the Fall of 2007 will likely be produced as high-end radio plays - relying on the nearly limitless imaginations of audience members rather than on costly effects that are mostly unappreciated anyway. ""If the viewers don't like the kind of effects produced by their own imaginations, it's not our problem!""
  As for new ideas? Early talks suggest tapping a new source: five-year-olds. ""Children at that age come up with the most imaginative story ideas,"" said Bob Wright, Vice Chairman at NBC/Universal. ""I guarantee that the kind of stuff we're looking at right now is both fresh and original!""</i> - <a href=""http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19620843/"">Source</a>

"event","Raising the minimum wage is being done with only one goal in mind: buying votes. The increase isn't going to help much because it's so small. True, the people it will affect won't be feeling the pinch from taxes due to their bracket (anyone paid less than $10.00/hr pays little to no taxes anyway). It's more aimed at those of us who do make money, and I for one don't see why I have to flip the bill for everyone else. I've worked my butt off just to get where I am (I spent four years on the front lines in the Middle East and then went back to school nights while working a 40-hr a week job during the day and raising our two children), and honestly I don't feel compelled to just hand my hard-earned money to those too lazy to do the same.

<lj-cut>True, the idea behind raising minimum wage is to get the employers to put more into the system, but we all know that it doesn't work that way. Instead, they're just going to crank up the prices of their products to offset the difference. So sure, Mary has an extra $20 a week for food or whatever, but now everything she buys has increased in price, along with most of the utilities, effectively eating the profit and more.

Instead of raising the minimum wage, what they need to do is persuade those it would affect to instead increase their skills base, either through further education or similar training. I'd rather send half of my paycheck to a school than give it to someone who couldn't be bothered staying in school in the first place. Hell, why not set fire to it instead? How does the saying go... ""Give a man a fish; you have fed him for today. Teach a man to fish; and you have fed him for a lifetime"". As far as I'm concerned, except a very very small section of the population (there's always exceptions, like those coming back from the Middle East with horrible injuries), if you aren't willing to work hard to keep your skills and education current and viable, then you don't deserve my money.

<lj-cut>This morning on the ride in, they were talking about Lost's ratings last week - how the show dropped to #10. While I was surprised, it didn't bother me one bit. In fact, I think it says a lot about the show and it's writers: they aren't giving into public opinion and selling out their souls like so many other shows, just to artificially crank up ratings (ok, so they have sunk to those levels once or twice, but it's rare - see: A_L & Libby's deaths for more on that). Seems funny that so many complain about how Lost isn't what it used to be - and then in the same breath compare every other show to it (much like they'd compare every reality show to Survivor). Lost is just as good as it ever was, writing and all. What's changed is that now there are twenty plus other shows out there that have tried duplicating Lost's successful formula (most ending in monumental failure).

And while I do agree that it sometimes feels like the producers are pimping out their show (books, interview upon interview, podcasts, and so on and so on), I'm willing to give them a break - after all, television isn't what it used to be. With TV on DVD all but eliminating the need for reruns, DVRs cutting into commercial profits (I haven't watched more than a half-dozen commercials in nearly a year), and higher production budgets over on the cable networks (anyone see the budget on an episode of The Sopranos? Holy cow!), these guys are literally fighting an uphill battle to keep their show afloat.

How about instead of posting thread after thread of complaints, we start showing more positive support. Believe it or not, the folks who work hard to bring Lost to our living rooms do read these boards every so often. I dunnos about them, but if I was reading about what others thought of my hard work and all I found were negative comments... I might not be so inclined to work as hard... or heck, why bother at all. An outcome that's not pretty no matter how you sugar-coat it.</lj-cut>"

"event","Ah, beloved LJ community. Haven't had much time to post lately, with work becoming a real problem, and our fruitless attempts to find a rental closer to my job ending in.. nothing. Life has quickly become a depressing shell of what it once was. When I think of all the hours of my life I've given up in the past year (something like 4.5hrs x 190 days = 855hrs), it really gets me down. Plus, I'm beginning to think that someone is trying to tell me that I need to quit. If it's not the dozen or so people who have recently asked me if all this driving/headaches/loss of family is worth it (to which I have no answer), then it's to ""odd occurrences"" that keep happening: 

- On Oct 16, my car's alternator died, stranding me in Boston. The nice guys at work paid to send me home on the train. I finally got home around 10PM. Took another four days to get the car repaired.

- Oct 20, the day I first drive my car to work after having it repaired, I blow a quarter-size hole in the front driver-side tire. Stranded again.

- Oct 24, car won't start again. This time it's a problem with the fuel line.

- And every single day since that I've driven home (about 9 days), I have been stuck in the most horrific traffic jams. The worst being the one on Halloween. I left two hours early to get home in time to take the kids out TrickOrTreating. Thanks to traffic, I didn't get home until nearly 8pm - 30 minutes past their bedtime.

- The boss has decided to relocate, so I am losing my nice window-seat to a f'ing cubicle. Enter more depression.

I hate to say it, but I think that very soon I may have to quit the job. As nice at it is, it's not worth all the headaches. Not by a long shot. :("

"event","Ben mentioned to Jack last nite that he'd lived on the island all of his life, and that he (and The Others) were all there for a reason. So, check this out:

A group of scientists form this organization/cult, let's call it Dharma, on an island in the middle of nowhere. They have an idea that the world may end and even have a way to calculate it down to the day. They do alot of research into different ways to first prevent it (zoology, telepathy, regeneration, cloning, etc), but eventually determine that there is simply no way to prevent the inevitable, they change their focus to devise a means to simply survive it. There were many crazed cults in the 60s&70s who believed a wide array of insane things (like riding on comets, etc). Perhaps this was simply a group of those folks.

<lj-cut>A short time later, they have an outbreak at one of their labs, which ultimate drives all of the adults insane - to the point where they all die (Danielle's talk of illness, Adam & Eve). But, since this group lives on the island, it's safe to assume that at least some of them have children who also live there.

These kids manage to survive on their own, and eventually begin to investigate the island. They discover all of these scientific structures as well as the research therein. Figuring out what had happened, they decide to continue their parents' work... not realizing that their parents were part of a crazed cult. Fast forward fifteen+ years.. and we have the island as it is now. The children of the original Dharma group know only what they have seen on the island... and thus could believe exactly what their parents did. They could be seeking the solution for the end of the world (even if it doesn't exist), seeking a cure for a disease that is long gone, etc.

If this was what happened, it could explain a very large chunk of the ""weirdness"" we've seen. There seem to be alot of automated systems still running on the island - like the smoke thing and several hatches, yet no one is monitoring them. If everyone is dead, the system would still run.. for a while, especially with a continuing flow of fresh bodies (Desmond, the Losties)...

It would also explain the antisocial behaviors of The Others. Everyone seems to agree that it was odd that Ben asked for a list of survivors, and has been so secretive.. rather than just rescuing them outright. If he is still working on the original Dharma's goals.. then wouldn't the Losties be a contaminant to their efforts (as well as providing new bodies to research on). It might also explain why they have no interest in leaving the island... it's all any of them have ever known. Not everyone in their village need be born their either. We know that there have been many visitors to the island over time. This may explain the violent nature that both Goodwin and Ethan expressed, as well as Ethan's skills with plumbing and basic medicine.

The Others may ultimately not be evil in their own eyes (""we're the not the bad guys"") and actually believe that what they are doing will eventually save everyone based on what they have discovered on the island, but I'd say they are definitely a threat.</lj-cut>"

"event","For about a year now, rumors have been circling about a new and more devious plan by the radicals in the Middle East (aka ""al Qaeda"") to bring America to it's knees. Unlike the previous plans, this one is BIG. And the worst part... it's already in motion.

<lj-cut text=""Don't Open If You Don't Want To Know"">The plan, lovingly named ""America's Hiroshima"" by none other than Osama bin Laden himself,  calls for two separate waves of attacks timed several days apart with the intent to kill around four million Americans (with at least two million of those being American children). It's been suggested that between these two days of doom, al Qaeda may call for the surrender of America to Islam by denouncing Christianity and Judaism as well as our Constitution. At the top of the list for cities to get nuked: New York City, Miami, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Chicago, San Francisco, Las Vegas, Boston and Washington, D.C. with NYC and Washington at the top of the preferred target list for al Qaeda leadership.

Recently it was discovered that as many as a dozen of these ""backpack nukes"" have already crossed the Mexican border and into our country, where they now sit in waiting for the word from al Qaeda to detonate them - with the most likely trigger being the invasion of Iran by US troops.

While this plan may feel like a ""Chicken Little"" of sorts, know this - two of these bombs have already been found inside the US:
<blockquote>""Each suitcase weighed between 50 and 80 kilograms (approximately 110 to 176 pounds) and contained enough fissionable plutonium and uranium to produce an explosive yield in excess of two kilotons,"" wrote Williams. ""One suitcase bore the serial number 9999 and the Russian manufacturing date of 1988. The design of the weapons, Tenet told the president, is simple. The plutonium and uranium are kept in separate compartments that are linked to a triggering mechanism that can be activated by a clock or a call from the cell phone.""</blockquote>Thanks to the war on terror, we at least know of this horrific plan, although no one seems willing to do anything about it... even when handed hard facts: When Khalid Sheikh Mohammad was arrested on March 1, 2003, the CIA dug through his laptop. What they discovered was this:<blockquote>""The terrorists are in at least seven metropolitan areas, which have been identified as New York, Miami, Houston, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Washington, D.C. The attack will occur simultaneously at these seven sites. al -Qaeda insists that over 4 million Americans, two million of them children, must die for the sake of parity. They are intent upon realizing this objective and the doomsday clock by all reckoning is very near midnight.""</blockquote>In 2004, the Israelis captured a Pakistani at a border crossing (south of Ramallah) who was coming in from Jordan with a backpack that set off radiation detectors. A close inspection of the device determined it to be a plutonium fusion device with a maximum yeild of up to 10 kilotons - the same capabilities as the bomb we dropped on Hiroshima.

<lj-cut>And I'm still not convinced that Bush's motives for sending our finest over there were not altogether honorable (as so many claim - ""oil, oil, oil.. it's all for oil!"" If you've ever been to Iraq, then you know that they love us - especially after freeing them from Satan (and sons) himself. And through Bush's efforts, we've brought many real terrorists to justice - one way or another. 

The problem is that the enemy we are currently fighting is without a ""head"", as with every other enemy we have ever faced. Kill off the current leadership, and a new one literally springs up over night. As sadistic as Saddam was, he may have been the only one with a strong enough army to keep some semblence of peace. Now that he's gone, every Tom, D1ck and Mohammad is fighting for their little piece. I don't forsee us ever being able to pull out of the Middle East, as the moment we do, the radicals see our withdrawal as success and then step up their efforts to kill us all.

I'm curious to know what would happen if we took our war budget and dumped a large chunk of it into developing alternative fuel in an effort to nullify the value of oil outright - and eliminating a large chunk of the nearly limitless resources our enemies in the Middle East now possess.</lj-cut>"

And yet no one seems worried that the guy who knows all of our country's secrets is going to be in the same vicinity as the #1 most hated human on the face of the Earth. WTF indeed!!!

All this while everyone is more concerned about a movie. Shame America, shame. And to all of you on the ""this movie is fiction"" bandwagon...

In late 2000, a group of CIA operatives had chased down Bin Laden and were staring at him through high-powered scopes of unmanned Predator drones. The only reason why the couldn't kill him: the Clintons refused to permit munitions on the Predators. They were more afraid of losing face by using armed spyplanes thsan of taking out a known killer.

Clinton also poo-pooed a plan to put air marshals on planes, and highened security at airports that would have easily stopped the hijackings on 9/11. And so on and so on... The movie is far closer to the truth than the folks in power want us to know..

For lack of anything else to watch, I decided to to take a chance and put on ""'Til Death""... and was pleasantly surprised. It's so refreshing to see a comedy that revolves around a happily married couple (in this case, two!) Plus, Brad Garrett's dead-pan shtick worked so well as the more experienced husband trying to help his newly married neighbor (and boss) through his ""Honeymoon Years"" - I laughed through nearly the entire episode.

I only hope it appeals to others enough to avoid cancellation - based on the other popular sitcoms, I suspect that it's days are numbered (I had very similar feelings while watching the few episodes of John Goodman's forward thinking ""Normal, Ohio"")."

"event","Well, it was an interesting Labor Day at our house. On my way home from Boston on Friday, I got inspired (the start of all evil in the world). Hurricane Ernesto was supposed to hit over the holiday so rather than just sit inside with the kids, I thought it might be fun to go out and do something different. Anyone who knows me also knows that when I say ""something different"" it can't be leading to anything good.

<lj-cut>After getting home and making a few calls to a good friend whom I haven't seen in ten years, my crazed plan moved into an ""active"" status. We ended up driving over to see him (mostly because finding plane tickets literally last second is well.. insanity). Now keep in mind, I live in RI and he currently resides in Illinois. Ok class, how far away is that? :)

If you guessed seventeen hours by car, then give yourself a cookie because that's exactly right. Yes the drive was hell (and screaming kids in the back of the car did not help) but seeing his face when we got there was worth it. He really didn't believe that I was serious. Obviously he doesn't know me very well, no (yes, I do this sort of thing all the time - much to the dismay of family, friends, and complete strangers).

The ride over wasn't bad, although i wish I could have taken more pictures. The last time I was that far west, I was still in grade school. Plus, the weather was perfect! No hurricane. Heck, no rain at all - just sun and 80s all weekend. I do have to say though, that the number of corn fields we drove past - well, it was a little unnerving (and seeing kids popping out of them here and there didn't help either). 

The holiday went well enough. Other than some serious digestive issues thanks to the buffet they took us to  on Saturday (which served food coated in more fat and grease than I have ever had before), I'd say it was an overall success - plus, the kids are still alive, which in itself is a feat! And they say that living by the seat of your pants only leads to disaster... I say, it leads to adventure!</lj-cut>"

"event","On the radio this morning, they were talking about the things that people do at work (as opposed to actually working). Lots of folks called in with crazy stories about sleeping at work or surfing th web for hours. I thought I'd add my own entry to the list:

<lj-cut>About ten years ago, I worked for one of the largest computer companies in the US, at their helpdesk. We basically just sat in this huge room, in cubicles (about 200 cubes) and waited for dumb people to call in with their dumb problems. According to the contract we each had to sign at the time of hiring, we were expected to complete between 30 to 50 calls every day (I was averaging 47 when I left). Now this doesn't sound like much, but I can tell you... it's a ton - considering the questions ran the gamut from the mundane (my PC won't reboot) to the impossible (the VPN is rejecting my hardware address). It was much more stressful than it sounds.

One of the guys I worked with (we'll call him Bob) was up for his yearly pay increase. Due to massive losses thanks to the approaching Y2K scare and e-Commerce blitz, the manages often ""passed over"" workers for pay increases. This was the case with Bob, who was passed over for the fifth review in a row. Deciding that it would be fruitless to fight it, he instead came up with a better solution. 

He set up a porn website using the company servers and Internet connection. Over the next six months, he told us frequently about the money he was pulling in on the side (at one point, he had over 9000 customers - at $29.99 a month!!!) and no longer cared about being ignored for pay increases - I suspect because at that time, he made substantially more than most of the rest of us. 

Around his tenth month mark, he got called into the bosses office. It seemed that they'd noticed his Internet access increasing steadily over the last year, and were considering laying him off because of it. Well, Bob had an ace up his sleeve. Before they said another word, he pulled out a rather large printout from his porn business. It seemed that (1) both of the managers currently lecturing Bob was spending between 9-12 hours every day on Bob's porn site and (2) one of Bob's other customer's had let him know (in exchange for free access) that the regional manager was embezzling from the company to support his gambling addiction. Needless to say, Bob was never fired.

The last I heard, he was celebrating his website's fifth anniversary and still going strong. ;)</lj-cut>"

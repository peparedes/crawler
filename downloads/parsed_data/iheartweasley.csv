"event","ok, so i am on day 2 of this diet.  which sucks, by the way.  tonight my kids ate kraft mac n' cheese for dinner.   remember that old commercial for it with the kids singing about the blue box blues?  well, thats how i felt because i love love love it.  once when i was pregnant i was eating mexican food with a good friend and even though we were full, we kept stuffing our faces.  so you know what she did?  she spit on it.  what a friend."

"event","tonight we ate chinese food for dinner.  this was my fortune:  you will soon reach a personal goal.  that is great news because i am starting a diet tomorrow.  its this wonky thing my mom told me about where you are supposed to lose 40 lbs. in a month.  although, im not sure how i am going to track said weight loss since someone in my house got mad at the scale and punched it.  maybe if i feel like it's working i will be motivated to go back ww.

"event","Imagine..

Your driving down a long rural road in the middle of nowhere.  Nothing is around except farm land... you can see the horizon.  Its the type of place where your actions have ABSOLUTELY no consequences.  

Beautiful.

As your driving you see an object in the road... as you approach closer and closer you realize that it's not an object, but rather, a small animal.  Probably a dog.  But before you can hit the breaks you run the animal over.  You know that you have killed it instantly.  You feel the thump while going 80 mph over top of it.  

Do you stop the car to check on it?

Or do you keep going?

You know for a fact that the dog is dead.  There is nothing you can do to bring it back to life, so why even bother checking on it?  All you would be doing is mourning the loss of a fucking dog that you had never seen before up untill now.  

Now imagine the same scenerio, only its not a dog this time.  It's a hitchiker.  An actual human being.  Living, breathing, just like you. 

Is it the same?  
Are your actions still the same?
Are you still the same weak, walking ball of human emotions?

Now take this lesson and put it into prespective with your everyday life.

Your welcome.

<hr>

She's lost in coma where it's beautiful
intoxicated from the deep sleep, deep sleep
do you wonder what it's like
living in a permanent imagination?
sleeping to escape reality, but you like it like that

[Chorus:]
guilty by design 
she's nothing more then fiction. 
she dreams in digital, 
cause it's better then nothing. 
now that control is gone, 
it seems unreal, 
she's dreaming in digital. 
she dreams in digital.

and your pixel army can't save you now
my finger's on the kill switch
i remember i used to compose your dreams
control your dreams
and don't be afraid to expose yourself
before i shut you down
you made some changes since the virus caught you sleeping

[Chorus]

I have seen the eyes of my inner most demons for all they are worth. 
I have walked down the stray corridor of shame and hit myself in the ass with each passing door.  
Then I had a sandwich.
Red paint on my hands, it represents blood.
Because tonight I died and was again reborn.  
Tonight.. I became an artist.

"event","First I would like to say that out of all the ""cliqs"" I have associated with in the past, this is by far the best and most favorite I have ever had the privalage to be with.  All of you make me feel so comfortable and its so easy for me to open up and express my true feelings and personality.  I've never really done that before now and it feels great.  I don't need to act so fake around you like I have done in the past.  

However..

I think I am loosing something about myself.  I don't really know what it is, but it bothers me. What I am asking for is real simple.  I guess this is kind of sterotypical, but I want the truth.

When you first met me what was your first impression of me?
Was this first impression correct or incorrect?
Have I changed since you first met me and if so, how?

Thank you, if everybody would comment I would greatly appreciate it.  And dont be shy.

Now here is the thing, I have alot of stuff to put in this entry and alot of it shouldnt be mixed into one entry, but Im gonna do it anyway because I'm Mo'Fuggin god damn it.  Just try to excuse the blasphemy.

<b><i>THOUGHTS ON WAR AND THE STATE OF THIS COUNTRY...</b></i>
Last night while I was at work, my friend Jack told me that he saw what he descirbed as an ""Iraqi"" standing outside of the store and it scared the hell out of him.  Im guessing it probaby wasn't an Iraqi, but none the less, probably someone of the Islamic faith.   Later that night, the muslim guy who cleans the trash came by, now keep in mind that he doesnt speak a word of english, infact, the only thing he can say is ""hey buddy"".  I don't know his real name, so we just call him ""hey buddy"" seeing that is all he ever says.  So anyway, this guy Jack goes up to 'Buddy' and says 

""Hey, I saw one of your friends standing outside earlier.  Whats going on, you guys planning somthing?""  

Buddy proceeds to give nervous laugh and walks away.

This scares me. 

I would also like to state that I have nothing but complete respect for the Islamic faith.  As some of you may know, I have an uncle who is from Jordan.  Not to mention that I took a course on Islam last semester, I know more about it than the adverage ""American Pig"".  In addition, this morning I found out the my cousin is no longer being shipped to Kuwait next month.  No, instead he is being shipped to Iraq on Thursday. :/  

Yay.

Go war!

<b><i>WRESTLEMANIA XIX PREDICTIONS & SYNONPSIS...</b></i>
Just keep in mind that I havent had a chance to watch RAW or Smackdown in the past few months on a regular basis, so I have NO idea what the fuck is going on anymore.  I just got the card from wrestlemania.com

Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. The Rock
Rock is a bad guy?  WTF when did this happen? And why the hell is Stone Cold back?  Didnt he get arrested for pulling an OJ Simpson or something?  Anyway, this is basically gonna be a remake of the Wrestlemania XV main event, except its not for the title.  I give props to The Rock for goin heel again.. (I like him better that way >:) and also for jobbing to the Hurricane the other week.. yeah I saw that Rocky.  Im expecting Stone Cold to win this one after overcomming somekind of interference.  Bischoff probably, but I did hear roumers of Goldberg.
<b>Winner:</b>Stone Cold

Hollywood Hulk Hogan vs. Vince McMahon
I hope Hogan does his trademark moonsault!
Lol.
<b>Winner:</b> Who the fuck cares as long as SOMEBODY has a stroke.

WWE RAW HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH
Triple H (c) vs. Booker T
This is way to predictable.  Im guessing Triple H will parade around for a friggin hour with his ""Evolution"" Stable consisting of Ric Flair, Batista and Randy Orton (boo!).  Batista is the fucking man, he should be in a match, not H.  Then Steiner will probably involved someway or another with Booker T.  Triple H, being the no sell aristocrat that he is simply will NOT job to the Booker man.  Never.  And if Booker does somehow win the title it'll be in a cheap way.  I wish that nigga would do a spin-a-rooni on H's fat ass. 
<b>Winner:</b>Triple H & Evolution

WWE SMACKDOWN HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH
Kurt Angle (c) vs. Brock Lesnar
Holy fuckin splooge!  This is gonna be a great match, possibly match of the night.  Both are deserving of being in this match, they're great athletes.  And unlike alot of people on the card *cough*Triple H*cough*.. they both have somthing called TALENT.  Its hard to say who is gonna win, but Im guessing Lesnar since Angle has been holding the title since November.
<b>Winner:</b> Brock Lesnar

Chris Jericho vs. Shawn Michaels
Jericho is the fuckin man, and Michales uses to be the man, but then he broke his back, retired and came back to action very recently.  In other words.. HBK doesnt know when to DIE!  I hope Jericho cleans his fucking clock.
<b>WINNER:</b>Chris Jerichof

The Undertaker & Nathan Jones vs. Big Show & A-Train
This woud be a great match minus everybody except Nathan Jones.  Taker is too damn old. 
Show is a heart attack waiting to happen.
ATrain needs to shave his back.
No way Taker is loosing his win streak at Wrestlemaia.
<b>WINNER:</b> Undertaker & Nathan Jones

WWE SMACKDOWN TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH
Los Guererros vs. Team Angle (c) vs. Chris Benoit & Rhyno
WTF?  I don't even know who the hell Team Angle is, but they have the titles.  I think they're the two Ametur fags who hang out with Kurt Angle.  Whatever.
GO0000000000000000000000RRRRE! splooge.
<b>WINNER:</b> Benoit & Rhyno

WWE RAW TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH
Kane & Rob Van Dam vs. Lance Storm & Cheif Morely (c?) vs. The Dudley Boyz
What happened to Regal?  I dont even  know if him and Storm are still the champs or not.  And wrestlemania.com did a hell of a job explaining this match for me.  It says Kane and RVD vs. Storm and Morely with the Dudley Boyz.  Does that mean the Dudleyz are just gonna be there to watch or are they actually in the match?  Who knows, who cares.  This one is easy.
<b>WINNER:</b> Kane & Rob Van Dam

WWE CRUISERWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH
Matt Hardy v1.0 (c?) vs. Rey Mysterio Jr
Since when does Matt Hardy qualify as a Cruiserweight?  Im not even sure if he is even the champ, but Im guessing he is seeing that Mysterio just came back.  Mysterio's got this one unfortunately for Matt.
<b>WINNER:</b>Rey Rey

WWE WOMEN'S CHAMPIONSHIP
Victoria (c) vs. Trish Stratus vs. Jazz
Once again...
who cares.
<b>WINNER:</b> Nick Hart

*SPECIAL ATTRACTION*
THE SYNDICATE BATTLE ROYAL
FEATURING... IN NO PATICULAR ORDER
Tom ""The Butcher""
The Beast They Call Kuhn 
Timmay
Kippy
Nick ""Child Of Satan"" Hart
Mark ""Der Furher"" Lombardi
and of course...
THE DELI MAN!!!!!!!!11
WINNER: All of a sudden, Spike Dudely comes out of nowhere and POWERBOMBS KUHN!  Lombardi calls on his Ghestapo bodyguards to clean house.  Meanwhile Tom is playing with his swords infront of the announce booth and making obscene gestures to the crowd.  Timmay is distracting the referee while Nick humps Kippy.  Deli Man is on a turnbuckle smoking a butt.  Then Scott Steiner comes out and kills everybody.  The end.

Unnesesary death
Matador corporations
Puppeting your frusterations
With the blinded flag
Manufacturing consent
Is the name of the game
The bottom line is money
Nobody gives a fuck
4,000 hungry children die per hour
From starvation
while billions spent on bombs
creating death showers

BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
Everytime you drop the bomb
You kill the God your child has born
BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!

Why must we kill our own child

BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
Everytime you drop the bomb
You kill the God your child has born
BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!

Everytime you drop the bomb

"event","Okay, trying to clear this up...

I should have been more clear in my last entry.  The pedistol comment wasnt' about you tim, it was about KUHN. The reason?  Lets just say that I know when people are talking about me behind my back in a negative context and I don't appreciate it.  Not to mention, I dont enjoy being waked up in the high school parking lot to a Kuhn humping my car, and then biching me out, then blowng me off later that day.

Not to mention the fact that he brought Jameson with him.  

Sorry for any misunderstanding.  

As for the whole ""mentos"" comment, I could personally give two shits.  Tim, you were with me when Lombardi was giving me shit too, it didnt bother me.  I didnt over react with that comment, I just shruged it off, possibly said ""fuck you"", can't really remember.  Fuck is every other word out of my mouth to begin with, so I don't know why you would take offense to it if you know me.  If you still think I overeacted, the I guess Im sorry for that, but whatever.  

And lets not talk about hypocrites right now *cough*kippy*cough*.

Ok, im done.

Around noon I went to the mall with Cait.  We rented Signs and hung out, then I dropped her off at her friend's birthday party.

Then I ate a meatball sub.

Around 7:00 I was sitting in the Roche Bros parking lot, after buying cigarettes and more lottery tickets.  I am now addicted to the Massachusettes state lottery. (Does that count as a tax write off?)  I called Kuhn and then met up with him at the mall.  Everybody was there.. Kuhn, Tom, Nick, Tim, Boris, Jackie, Amber, Shaker and Hewie.  Then we go to TGI fridays and I ordered dinner (forgetting that I had already eaten.)  I wasnt hungry when I got it, so I ate half and gave Nick the rest.  Then I went outside and had a cigarette and talked to Cait on the phone.  After TGI, we all went to Amber's house for a bit.  Then I left everybody because I was tired.  It is weird being the first person to leave.. Im usually the last.  I hate it too because like Dave Attel once said... ""All of the fun stuff happens like 10 minutes AFTER you leave.""  Well fuck it.. today was a good day.  I was extremely jovial for some odd reason.  I probably didnt really show it too much.. seeing that I have no emotions.. but that my friends is another story.

<b>JAMARIQUAI; VIRTUAL INSANIY</b>
Oh yeah, what we're living in (let me tell ya)
Well it's a wonder man can eat at all
When things are big that should be small
Who can tell what magic spells we'll be doing for us
And I'm giving all my love to this world
Only to be told
I can't see, I can't breathe
No more will we be
And nothing's going to change the way we live
Cos' we can always take but never give
And now that things are changing for the worse see
Whoa, it's a crazy world we're living in
And I just can't see that half of us immersed in sin
Is all we have to give these
Chorus:
Futures made of virtual insanity now
Always seem to, be govern'd by this love we have
For useless, twisting, other new technology
Oh, now there is no sound, for we all live underground

And I'm thinking what a mess we're in
Hard to know where to begin
If I could slip the sickly ties that earthly man has made
And now every mother, can choose the colour
Of her child
That's not nature's way
Well that's what they said yesterday
There's nothing left to do but pray
I think it's time I found a new religion
Waoh, it's so insane
To synthesize another strain
There's something in these
Future's that we have to be told

{Chorus}

Now there is no sound
If we all live underground
And now it's virtual insanity
Forget your virtual reality
Oh, there's nothing so bad
Oh yeah
I know yeah

I know I can't go on

Of this virtual insanity, we're livin' in
Has got to change, yeah
Things, will never be the same
And I can't go on
While we're livin' in oh, oh virtual insanity
Oh, this world, has got to change
Cause I just, I just can't keep going on
It was virtual
Virtual insanity that we're livin' in
That we're livin' in
That virtual insanity is what it is
Yeah

{Chorus}

Futures made of the virtual insanity
Now they always seem to be govern'd
By a love of this useless, twisiting other new technology
And now there is no sound, for we all live underground
Yes we do

Livin' in, virtual insanity
Livin' in, virtual insanity
Livin' in, virtual insanity
Livin' in, virtual insanity

Virtual insanity is what we're living in, yeah

Where to start...

As always, the center of controversy is Tim.  Tim, I understand that you are upset about the whole situation with Celsa.  I've tried to help as much as I can.  Maybe I care too much.  Thats the problem.. I care too much about people who don't fucking deserve it.  If you want to be upset then thats fine with me, but don't fucking take all of this out on me, Cait or even Kuhn.  What, you don't want other people to have what you can not?  Thats fucking childish and you know it.  You claim to think on another plane of intelligence than everybody else.. that is fucking arrogant.  Keep your shit away from me.  Im sure Cait and Kuhn feel the same way, but im gonna let them speak for themselves.  You fucking depressed me to all hell last night.  I couldnt fucking sleep.. I just stayed up all night and listened to Paperdoll on repeat.  I didnt even realize that you were fucking with me until later on this morning.  I was too fucking tired and distressed to realize it.  I prefer NOT to get back into the situation we were in a few months ago, but once again.. you are letting are ignorance get the best of you.  When it comes to my relationship with Cait.. stay the fuck away from it.  I've tried to help you in the past, and you dont give a shit.  You think your helping me, but you just want me to be in the same fucking boat as you.  Fuck you, your misery loves company.

<b><i>Until The Blood Runs Clear</b></i>
Just hit me.
Beat on me.
Brutalize me all you wish.
Until the blood runs clear...

For at this time
on this day
from my soul flows fourth happiness.
Until the blood runs clear...

I enjoy the pain.
I embrace the tourment
even though it makes me feel like shit.
Until the blood runs clear...

So do as I ask
Please.
Don't stop.
Just please don't stop.
Not until...
The blood runs clear.

<b><i>When Dreams Become Nightmares</b></i>
I sit alone
as I do every night
not sleeping or dreaming
just comprehending
the meaning of life.
I think and I ponder
Just for a bit
then I look in the mirror
and I bite my lip.
I can't see myself.
I am not there.
Nobody.
Nothing.
I am ashamed.
What have I become? 
My dreams have become nightmares."

I had a brief discussion with Tom tonight.  It felt good to get my thoughts out to him.  About everything.  And I am glad he believes and supports me on one such matter.

There are still things that I am trying to grasp onto and deal with.  Its hard and it worries me.  I want to make everything work out, and I hope it will.  I am almost certain it will.  I just haven't been in this situation in such a long time.  Its still hard for me.

Don't forget Manhattan keep makin', Brooklyn keep takin'
Shook ones keep shakin', no time for fakin'
Know what I mean, I ain't choppin' no bars just risin' like cream

B-Boy posin', punk rock chicks, kids are alright but I need my fix
If you diggin' the mix, feelin' the drugs, if you keepin' it real
If you livin' like thugs, I spit kisses and hugs like forty five slugs
Come back on the run and kiss my love gun
Got a look that'll kill, voice that'll carry
Half a dozen women that think I want a marry
I got trouble on my mind, I'm refusin' to lose
But still I got a find someone to abuse, I'm gonna run spread the news

<i>""It's bishops all the way down""
;Tom Walsh
</i>
Today was good.  Picked up Nick and Kevin from school, then went and got Cait in Mansfield and went to an art supply store in Avon.  That was fun, I was in a state of euvora for about a 1/2 hour.  Then me and Cait hung out at her house for a little while, she convinced me to call in sick to work.  After that I went and picked up Tim, met up with Tom, Kuhn and Kippy and thats about it.  Drove Tom home and my tire shit itself about a mile from my house (boo!).  

Tomorrow seems to be even more interesting...

Getting up early so I can change my god damn tire.  Then Im picking up Tom, Kuhn and Kippy and we're getting McDonalds breakfast.  I'd imagine we'll probably meet up with Tim and Nick at some point.  Then I might be dropping off everybody at the mall and I go to work.  Eh, whatever.  At least I have Saturday off, and Im going to the movies with Cait. 

I hate writing about my god damn daily plans in my livejournal.  It sounds so.. boring?  Cliche?  Uncreative?  Yeah, whatever.  

It's funny how only a few short weeks ago I was constantly feeling like shit.. and now Im so... happy?

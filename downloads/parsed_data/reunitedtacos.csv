"event","It's amazing how sad you can get about the stupidest things.  I mean I'm depressed over something that isn't going to ruin my life or really even alter it in a huge way, but things just didn't go my way.  Meanwhile, the world is in chaos after the natural disaster in Southeastern Asia.  I mean seriously, my sister was in the thick of it. She was in Thailand and her and all the friends she went with are ok, without being injured in any major way.  And I'm still sad over this?  I am seriously wired wrong. I should be grateful for the mere fact that my sister's still alive, let alone practically unscathed.  And yet I'm pining for a girl.   What a fuckin doosh.  (Me that is)  And hanging out with friends helps to make me happier, but then my mind always wanders back.  I think that's what they call the wanderlust.  Or maybe not.  I think the thing that irks me the most is that, well I don't actually know.  A lot of things are irking me right now.  I feel like I just don't really fit in anywhere, like I don't have a firm place.  This sounds like a sob story and it is, but it's interesting to me because it's my sob story.  Gah I don't really know what's goin on in my head.  I should really figure that out.  This is all the emotions I feel right now: betrayed, sad, angry, disappointed, hopeful, confused, stupid, longing, excited, content, relieved, and stupid again.  I'm real kinda pathetic right now, but don't worry.  I'll pull through. No biggie."

"event","Reminiscing is a fun thing to do.

I just talked to Meagan and we talked about all these high school crushes and how we felt like dooshbags most of the time.  I had forgotten all those humiliating times where I felt like the most cowardly boy alive and the times where I felt like I was flying in Leonardo's arms.  But in the end, now that I'm through all of it, I wouldn't change a damn thing.  I think that's the common consesus because I mean really, we wouldn't be the people we are if we didn't go through all the crap that felt so important at the time.  

So I'd like to take this opportunity to say an internet thank you that won't be seen by most of the people that I thank.  
So thank you to 
those who were nice enough to let me dance with them even when I was a creepy little kid, 
the guys that let me hang around and watch them race snails even when I wasn't cool enough to be around them, 
the teachers that didn't care that I was a shy shy kid, 
the friend who sang with me in English class, 
the girl that made me learn what it's really like to want someone, 
the teacher that let me make stupid movies with my friends for a grade, 
a certain fatheaded kid for being, well, fatheaded,  
the counselor who didn't make me feel weird for having to ask for a discount to take AP tests, 
the teacher that made me feel like I was smart enough, 
the girl that let me go with her to a dance (probably out of pity), 
the friend who saved me from doing the most embarassing thing that I would have ever done,
the friend who made schoolwork fun again,
the friend who turned me down, twice, 
the band who I played with as my crowning achievement of high school,
the friend that I had a great time with at Senior Ball,
the best friend for being the best friend,
and most of all, all my friends for being my friends.  That is what I'm most thankful for.

It was a little belated thanksgiving, but whatever.  Why not make everyday Thanksgiving?  Well besides the pileup of leftovers.  $5 to the person that can name everybody that I thanked(excluding the ""all my friends"" because you know I have SOOO many friends.)  Ok enough sentimentality.  Ima go play with poop."

"event","So I woke up today with the intention of creating an artful masterpiece.  In the end, I guess I succeeded.  My day began with a rude awakening at 9:00.  And then another one at 10:00.  So I took a shower and went to class. I don't understand anything that's going on in my physics class and I don't really know what's goin on in my Material Science class or my Statics class.  Basically that leaves me in my current state of mind: constipated with knowledge.  Alright time to tell the truth. I have no idea what's going on, my mind is going crazy, I can't tell if I'm hungry or thirsty, or worse yet, BOTH.  ......Ok I'm collected.  So the masterpiece that I created.  It was blue and sparkly.  I made it with the leaves that I gathered on the way home from class.  It tasted of cinnamon and vanilla and smelled like roses.  It was a pidgeon."

"event","WITHA POCKET FULL OF BELLS!!!!  I love that line! It's so freakin crazy.  Why are ""they"" rallying around the family with a pocket full of bells of all things? Seriously.  I don't get it. QUIT IT NOW!!!!  Speaking about music, I was sitting down before my class listening to John Frusciante - Shadows Collide with People and it made me think, wow, I want to listen to this at night on top of my roof and just contemplate life while staring at the skyline. It made me think that everything would somehow be beautiful with that combination. ....Uh, poop?  So I have learned today that I am behind in my studies.  Yet again. So I don't know why I'm here. The only reason why I'm updating my liveJournal is because the monkey told me that he'd stop throwing his poop at me if I wrote something nice about him.  Well you know what, he can suck donkey nuts! *SPLAT*"

"event","So Paula Cole presents an interesting question.  Where have all the cowboys gone?  In my humble opinion, I believe that they left for a cattle run somewhere in 1995.  But with the unfortunate occurence of the Dust Bowl, they were stranded on Donner Pass and were forced to eat each other.  To make sure that none of them tasted bad, and confident that no information would be leaked, they decided to wrestle each other in olive oil.  1) To get the meat tender and 2)because what's more fun than oily wrestling? Honestly. 
 I believe I've answered that question thoroughly. Now I must move on to the topic of why I am typing such gibberish at 12:49a.m.  It has to do with procrastination, but that's not exactly it.  I was doing my music autobiography project when I realized that, *gasp*, I don't have a liveJournal.  Why not? Why have I neglected my happiness for so long in not obtaining this precious webspace so that other people could look at it and feel relieved that their lives have so much more purpose than mine?  So really, I'm doing this for you guys. I love you guys.  Even the guy that flicked a booger at me today. (It tasted delicious!)"

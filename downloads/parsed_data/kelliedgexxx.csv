I go to school and i do school work then i come home and My mom has me writing essays and doing all kinds of studying for the SAT. On top of that i have homework. So Pretty much the only down time i have is to 2 hours before i go to sleep, where i get online and relax by myself and txt the people who matter most to me. The sad part is since i havent been in band lately, my parents except me to be home 24/7 and i am just not that kinda person. Yes i would LOVE to go out and party. Get wasted off my ass with the people who i love, but i cant. Cause i am under constant lock down. I was lucky to be able to stay out til 12 the other night to see my friends play. I am so sick of school and the worst part is the time that i am supposed to be having fun. i'm not. I'm 17 years old....I wanna have fun.<br /><br /><b>The Single life</b> really sucks. I like this guy who is one of my best friends. I want to tell him but i know that like always i will be shot down. Everyone always tells me that they dont know why i am single. They say that i am beautiful, and have the best personality, If this is all true then dont ya think i wouldnt be complaining. I have been broken hearted, lead on, played, and used. That i am almost to the point of forgetting about it. Hell maybe ill just whore around. That seems to be all that an guy wants.<br /><br /><b>My friends</b> as amazing but they havent really been there for me. Some of them have but the others havent. Ones that i thought that i could count on forever adn always. We made plans together, and they changed alot. But not cause of me. I dont know what to do. I love my friends and they are forgetting about me. I am busy and i dont have time to do anything. And because of that they get mad at me.<br /><br /><b>The Ex </b>is following me. Looking into the same colleges as me and taking the same classes too. He wants to be friends with my friends. He is trying to be in a band just like my besties. Then he says that he wants to beat them up and all this stuff. The worst part is that one of my so called friends told him all the stuff i say about him. So he gets a big head thinkin im scared of him. Which is far from the truth."

"event","Since this is my first entry i will start by telling a bit about myself.

I am a senior at my high school. Im not the smarted kid there but i manage.

&nbsp;Music is the only thing in this life that keeps me sane. I live it and i love it. I am in the marching band and i am also on the winter drumline at my school. My two best friends are members of a underground metal band and i try to go to all there shows that i possibly can. My favorite kind of music is metal. But i pretty much listen to all of it.

My friends mean the world to me. Though sometimes they drive me completely insane, I love them with my whole heart. I would o anything for them and they know that i would. My 3 best girls are Saranna, Steph, and Kira. They are amazing. Since band is over i dont get to spend as much time with Saranna and Kira but i know that they will always be there for me. My 5 Best guys friends are Timmy, Austin, AJ, Paul, and Jarrett. [And No i will NOT put last names] I like to hang out with guys. They dont have nearly as much drama as girls and they take care of me. I love my boys.

Sometimes i write things, like poems and random quotes about how i feel. Most of the time they suck. Sometimes they are good though. It all depends on how bad/good i feel.

I am an Animal lover. I own a cat and a hamster. I did have 3 fish, but 2 of them got eaten by the other one. I have also had 4 african dwarf frogs. =] they are so cute. lol When i move out of my house i plan on getting a Dog, A second cat, and a ferret.

I am a sporty girl. I play volleyball. when my brother lived at home i would go out and play football and baseball with him. When i was younger i played Basketball, Soccer, Softball, and i was a cheerleader. But that was all before my music stuff happened. =] I love watching football. Clemson tigers are my fave &amp;&amp; So is the Carolina Panthers.

I love my family, but as of lately they are driving me crazy.

I dunno much else to say about myself, so if you want to talk to me or know anything else just message me."

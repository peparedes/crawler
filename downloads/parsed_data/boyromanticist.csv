"event","The theme of my page is romanticism. I know that is irrelevant to my recent entry. Anyway I wrote this entry to let others know about the theme of my site, I already said it. Since that is the theme I chose the colors of valentines day as dominant. Little did I know that I would have to fix a lot of things since there is too much pink. BUT don't be curios I am not gay. As time passes I will surely remove all the pink in my page."

"event","This day is great. First I noticed that our classroom was not in it's usual desired temperature. However I'm fine fine with that. Our class adviser re-announced that the fifth-week status of our grade will be released within the week. That was something to wake me up, as I am aware that I'm failing some of my subjects. I'm not satisfied in my performance in school-work. Starting to-day I must triple my efforts and prove to myself and to others that I can achieve great things as everybody else could. Now I'm really aiming high if I am to survive this school-year and to study in a renowned university.
  During our biochemistry period, our teacher just started discussing about alkynes- carbons with triple bonds. Hell it was easy, its like playing or like walking in the park. The problem with that subject is that you have to remember everything, well I guess that will be easy if I do the write thing which is to listen to our teacher,copy all notes, and and to list important details that he mentions. That is not usual to me but if I must do it. 
  During lunch I noticed that one of my friends did not attend school, so that's why it has been less noisy at the moment. Anyway I ate lunch with classmates, we connected two long tables to do that. 
  After lunch my next period would be for philosophy. As I expected I passed the unit test. I regret waisting my time on entertainment. I was suppose to study it's the only thing I should do in my young life. I mean I don't have to work for my living. The result was low and my status grade in that subject is passing yet low. Anyway I was amused by my teacher's discussion. He discussed the answers of the essay questions. My favorite question is can God create a being exactly like him? My answer was yes since God is omnipotent. However I got no point for writing that. Since the answer should be no. Why no? God is perfect, and if he is to create a being exactly like him that being would come from nothing, and that's already an imperfection, and imperfection is not a characteristic of God. Our teacher also told us that it is a metaphysical impossibility.
  During our class in History a lot of us failed the quiz, so much for tripling my efforts. 
  During our last period which is math I got a bad news and calculated a good one too. The bad new is that I failed our unit-test. But that's nothing to me now since I calculated the status of my math grade- the result is passing. That was a relief. But I'm not to relax, since I only passed with a little help from my average in  home works and seat works. But today that has gone so low as I did not submit my homework, and my grade for that is zero not sixty.
  
  This is where today's entry ends. I know I have grammatical errors but I'm not going to bother correcting those as to be honest I don't know how."

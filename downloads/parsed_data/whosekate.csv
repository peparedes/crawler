zeidman called me today to make sure my day went well. it didnt, but thanks for everything

sean even gave me a little kiss on the cheek before school ended. everything that anyone did even a little smile, helped me :0)

i dont want to make him feel like shit. what he did was totally his decision. right now i know it feels to be feeling MORE then shit, and i dont want him to feel that.. its bad enough having me have it, shouldnt he be happy that he doesnt have to worry then more then himself right now? yes, he is an asshole for dumping me, but honestly, it was his choice. thanks to EVERYONE and i mean <b> EVERYONE </b> who was there for me today, you hoenstly saved me..
<i> stacy, niki, lexi, caitlin, justin, quinn, andrew, james, caitlin currin, kristine, garrett, killian, Jenny, Alex and other people.. </i>
^^ <i> why did i say this, the way he is acting is showing that he doesnt care.. why should i care then? it makes me weak thinking bout you, and what i should be doing is learning to make myself stronger and make myself know that i will get through this.. i will be ok. ((sooner or later))</i>

ill get through this, right?

<i><b>edit</b></i>

you call me cuz ""we're friends?"" you call me more, now that we are friends more then you did when we went out! now i know why you are now ""mr. in consistant, u havent even liked me for that long. thanks for everything, ass..."

alex, thank u. youve made me relize how i feel bout friends and boyfriends. and i shouldnt just break things off with my friends cuz my boyfriend is jealous. <b>andrew, if you read this, i feel soo awful and ive been soo stressed bout everything, and sorry for ending things becuase im messed up. please, can we just talk? i know that i go between like u and killian, but i can just clear up, things will be better...</B>

but maybe me being sick is a sign to make me think think and think.. ive relized that im going to regret everyday i took for granted in hating this school, and when the time comes where i start getting attatched to everyone, highschool is going to take everything away from me that ive grown up with, well atleast in my teen years. 

<marquee>i never expressed myself on how much i love you guys.. without u guys, i truely dont know where i would be, so thank you for all you have done!! </marquee>

Well it's all so overrated
In not saying how you feel
So you end up watching chances fade
And wondering what's real

And I Give you just a little time
I, Wonder if you realize
I've been waiting till I see it in your eyes

If I just breathe
Let it fill the space between
I'll know everything is alright
Breathe,
Every little piece of me
You'll see
Everything is alright
If I just breathe
Breathe"

well- things are clearing up again. everyone saying that maybe a break would help us, obviously- no one knows us. the best thing about our relationship is that we work things out the way they truely need to be treated and they arent pushed aside by just taking ""breaks"" and just letting everything try to clear up. its just very hard when he doesnt take you serioulsy cuz you usually are very happy and non-worriable. well, things are cleared up and now i have relized that i wont be seeing alec out of school for another 2 weeks, and im just happy and truely lucky to have him in my class and let me chill with his friends.. it makes me feel important to know that he cares enough bout me to fit me into his life with his friends. 
--i brought my lovely throw away camera to school today, and by the end of lunch, i indeed had the throw it away without developing it cuz of SOME PERVS in the 8th grade... well hopefully CAITLIN will bring her pics tomorrow so i can decorate my binder over! well, i hope to get together with stace and the twins this weekend, i dont remember the last time i had a sleep over with them!! and im invited caitlin too. this will probably happen friday night cuz caitlin has church on sunday, well hopefully plans will work out! :-D"

I am thinking it's a sign 
that the freckles
in our eyes are mirror images 
and when we kiss they're perfectly aligned
and I have to speculate 
that God himself did make us into corresponding shapes 
like puzzle pieces from the clay
true, it may seem like a stretch, 
but its thoughts like this that catch 
my troubled head when you're away 
when I am missing you to death
when you are out there on the road 
for several weeks of shows 
and when you scanthe radio, 
I hope this song will guide you home

they will see us waving from such great heights, 
""come down now,"" they'll say
but everything looks perfect from far away,
""come down now,"" but we'll stay...

I tried my best to leave this all on your machine 
but the persistent beat it sounded thin upon listening
that frankly will not fly. 
you will hear the shrillest highs and lowest lows 
with the windows down 
when this is guiding you home"

"event","this is all freggin B-S! this shit with alix and shawna has GOT to stop! stupid argument bout them quieting down on the bus. everyone is wrong and right here. alix and shawna do have a right to have fun, be loud and do whatever they please, but there is a time where you need to quiet down and think about other people who are around them. On the other hand, all kate, stacy, lexi, niki and caitlin had to do was ask them quietly to settle down and tell them that they were trying to rest. it was wrong of them to talk bout alix and shawna behind their backs. But-- we also had a right to be pissed. some people should know from common sence that you should be quiet if you look around and you see people passed out from exhasution from earlier that day. Obviously, some people arent like others and need to be told that their lines have been crossed. obvioulsy, things are clearing up, yes, people still have anger and hurt inside them. but these stupid arguments get around everywhere! and serioulsy, if you have nothing to do with the people who are fighting, just stay out of it. no backups please, becuase we are all strong and can handle things on our own. yes we know you are trying to be good friends and help, but sometimes, people just need to fight their own battles and go through them the best they can.

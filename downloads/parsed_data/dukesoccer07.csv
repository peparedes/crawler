School starts up tomorrow, and yeah, I'm not going to explain the whole situation with that...

I'm just really sick of life right now... no matter what I do, im never apperciated, always being looked down on... and im sick of it... my parents have no respect for me... people always say they'll do shit with me and they dont... its driving me nuts...

I settled my differences with Julie and we are going to hang out during christmas break, I really havent told anyone but I really do hate how things ended between me and her... Its odd cause I still have feelings for her... 

Breanne apologized about how things ended between us, which is awesome... but hey it happens sometimes... at least we are all cool now... and at least you are trying to be nice, just kidding, you are nice... hopefully we can hang out soon???

Yesterday sucked because Eric and his fucking idiot ass girlfriend are talking shit about me behind my back... the stupid part is they are doing it to jennifer, so she is telling me everything... sucks when your best friend starts talking shit about you... and i told shannon to go fuck off... so its all good...

Hmmm finals are coming up, I got a take home final today, which I'll finish tonight at work... I got a final saturday which I'm spending all thursday to study for.... and one on monday, and then I'm done at 10am on monday, well except for turning in my take home one in... then its christmas break.... which means PARTY!!!!

Well time for some poker, this break is going to rock cause I'm just going to play poker, work, and spend time with jennifer....

Well lets see, the month of december... I have earned $2000 playing poker online, and then another $1400 at KFC cause we get paid 3 times this month... So I'm getting paid this month which is good cause I gotta save for my road trip to florida this summer, plus I'll be spending a lot of time in VA this summer... 

School has been going ok, I wasnt prepared for the full time student and work... but I think next semester ill make out a schedule so I can use my time management for school, work and poker... My schedule for next semester sucks cause there are classes i wanted to take but cant cause they were full... I really wanted to take webpage development, but I gotta wait til next year... I'm taking beginning to bowling, calculus and analytic geometry (whatever the fuck that is), english 102, comp sci and crime/criminal justice.... should be easy....

Hmmm, me and jennifer, well things are ok... I dont know if I have time for a relationship right now, cause so far it has just been a big headache.... but we will see what happens during christmas break.... only 10 more days!!!!!

I heard from Chris last week and this week, he has been on AIM a lot, he is doing really good.... and I cant wait til may when he comes back!!!

I got no sleep at all the other night... I stayed up til 1 doing a paper... and then from 1 to 6 i was playing Halo 2 with Jer... then he wimped out and went to bed, so I played poker til 9 when my class was....

Class was pretty gay and pointless, but I went nonetheless, since I said im not missing any this week...

After class I went out to Taco Johns with Liz... then came back here and played halo 2 and poker til 3ish...

Once 3 came, I drove to North and picked up Jennifer... and we just sat around talking for about 2 hours... then I dropped her off at home, which I dont mind cause she is a really great girl and i know she isnt going to pull any shit on me....

And then me and Jer went to Erics then went to the Green Day Concert...

We got there and noticed they had a screen and it told you the number for sending text messages and pictures to appear on it.... so i tried to send some messages such as ""I am god"", ""You dont want it with Hov"", and ""HURRAH BEER"" but none of them got on their... Well Eric decided to send a picture of a naked girl he had on his phone, hoping that they just put anything up there....
Well sugarcult got on stage, started with Stuck in America, played some songs such as memory, champagne, and pretty girl, then finished with Bouncing of the walls.... it was really good, a lot of energy....
Then New Found Glory came, and the mosh pits started up, after a few songs i told Eric im going into one... so I did.... and it was crazy.... Another mosh pit started during the next song, and i told Eric he is coming with me... so we both went in, some fucker knocked me down, so I got back up and jacked him in the face... it was awesome.... NFG put on an absolutely fucking amazing concert....
Well as we were waiting for Green Day, people started to cheer, and i look up at the screen, and the picture eric sent was there... it quickly changed to another one... then changed back... then changed again... then changed back... everyone was cheering... We showed the people around us the picture on Erics phone... We were definetely gods among them, haha.... good times, made the night so much better...
Anyways, Green Day is the most amazing band ever... they never cease to disappoint me... there was so much energy and adrenline... i wasnt even tired... i was jumping and getting excited about it.... they played a bunch of their new songs to begin... and then went into their old stuff... it was well played... I was so pumped about it.... they always play Good Riddance at the end as their final song... after they played it, they said ""Fuck it, lets keep fucking playing""... and they played 4 more songs

Today could not have went any better.... this whole week has been absolutely amazing... unfortunately the string of concerts are over...Thanks Eric for being a great friend and going to them.... Thank you everyone who went Sunday, although good charlotte sucked, we had a blast, and some things happened during the concert that made the night 100 times better... I am really happy right....

Well time to go to George Webbs with the sister-in-law

Lola Ray, well never heard of them.... and really didnt like them

Hazen Street, I bought their CD about 2 weeks ago, and it was an amazing CD, and the show they put on was fucking amazing as well...

About 2 years ago I saw Sum 41 at summerfest, and it was absolutely amazing, and so was this show

Good Charlotte, what a disappointing performance... they played mostly new songs, and they played half of the new song i like... they only played one old song, and it wasnt even little things... such a disappointment...

Although the concert ended band, overall it was good... The people I went with made it amazing... Especially one person... Definetely worth going for that....

Tomorrow is Sugarcult/New Found Glory/Green Day... It should be an awesome concert... I cant wait....

Found out some interesting news the other night, which I'm quite happy about... and now I just gotta see where that current situation goes... it could be very good... 

School is going GREAT, getting an A in all my classes but philosophy... and well, would expect even a B in that class... I'm finally getting all my homework caught up on... despite working so much lately... which is good, school first right now....

I can't wait for Simple plan, that means that 5 days after is Good Charlotte, and 2 days after that is Green Day!!!!! What a great line up...

"event","As a child you never think about the future, you never think about what could be. You live without a care in the world, you do devilish acts like vandalism, thief, just minor things that you learn from, or at least your parents hope you learn from. Grade school was breeze, and you didnt know that it was the fundamentals at life that you were taught there. And then comes high school, the first big step in anyones life, the thing that will shape you the most.

The drama starts after the first week, you are finding your true friends, you are losing friends you once had. You discover things that you never knew about yourself, such as, who you really are. Your teachers challenge you to think about the problems in life, they make you think about what you are gonna do with your life. You start to form an idea about your career and you work from there, you start to plan for college, you do as much as you can to get into the college you want, either that or you just take the easy way out, and go for a college you know you dont have to do jack shit to get into.

You also realized that you wasted high school, you past up opportunities that should have been ceased. You feel alone, you feel like you will never be anyone, or anything to anyone. You try to fit in, but then you just don't feel like yourself anymore, you second guess who you are, and you lose close friends because of it. You are willing to give up friends for something that you know isnt you and you dont want.

Then high school ends, and everyone goes off in their own, you rarely talk to anyone anymore. You find yourself with a new group of people. You also realized that the time in high school you spent, you were actually really depressed, you know you made many mistakes, and you wish you could go back and change them so that you could be happy, but you know you cant, and it brings you down even more.

Your 19th birthday comes around, you hang out with a few friends the night before, thinking you'd spend time with your family, only to find out that your parents hate you, that they arent proud of you, that you have changed. You find yourself at a friends house, you thought they were a good friend, but then they let you take the gun, they let you point it at your head, you sit there, crying, knowing it is the end, knowing there is nothing left, then you remember...

You remember about the girl that you just met, the person that is unlike anyone else that you have met. You hope and wish that maybe something would happen, that if you just try to spend time with her something would develop. Weeks go by and you start spending a lot of time her, you hang out almost everyday. A connection is made, and that one night, after bowling, you finally kiss her, and thats where it all starts.     You never felt this way about anyone. All through high school you were never happy always depressed, and then you find someone, someone that made you forget about all that, someone that made you happy. You forget about everything, you dont care what peoples opinions are, you are happy, its something that hasnt happened in many years, so you cease it for all its worth. 

And then it ends, so abruptly, without warning, without trying to work anything out, it just ends. You pray  that maybe it wouldnt, maybe things will work out, maybe its just that you needed time apart, maybe you needed to relax. And thats where you stand now, hoping that things will work out. But you know deep down inside that you are hurt by all of this, you know you cant be happy without them, its just the depression stage all over again, except this time worst. This time you have multiple thoughts of suicide a night, you think of ways to do it, you slit your wrist at night trying to cause physical pain instead of emotional pain, but it wont help. Now you just have to lie to people about has happen, you say a cat scratched you, or something like that. 

There are two people that matter the most in your life, one is the person that you spent your summer with, and the other is your aunt, someone who has always been there for you. You tell her whats going on, you beg her not to tell your parents, but she doesnt listen, she tells anyways, and things get 100 times worst. You tell her not to cry and tell her that something may happen to you. You dont sleep for days, you start to have an emotional break down, you are told your brother is going to Iraq for 6 months, another person that means the most to you. You pull out your Bible only to find old passages that you would read every night, and you read them, and you cry. You wonder where you went wrong, why things are the same, why you feel so empty inside and why it doesnt seem like you are living anymore. 

All you do is sit in your room, listen to the emo and punk style music, hearing bands that are mad at their dad, and some songs about relationships, and you quickly turn it off. You turn on the TV just to see people and their relationships with others. Its the basis of life to establish a relationship with someone, but the only person you want to be with right now you can't.


*That is my life, thats what I have went through. 

On June 13th, 2004 I had a gun pointed at my head, by me. My friend didn't even think about stopping me, they saw the pain I was in, and everything was flashing before me. And I thought about you, I was hoping that something may happen, and was willing to wait and see. And something did happen with us, and it was the best thing that could have happened. I had the time of my life this summer. It made me smile to wake up next to you, to feel the warmth of your body next to me at night. I would do anything to be with you. I really wish I didn't hear the news about my brother because I would have never pushed so hard to do something with you, because I knew that you could make me happy. I was hoping you'd be there for more, but I know your sorority is important to you, and I'm sorry for everything. I miss you, and I always will, its going to be a while before I get over you, and I really dont want to do it this soon."

"event","So last night I was SUPER close to committing suicide but then Kerry called me and talked me out of it... I'm glad there are some people who care and understand what I'm going through, instead of having this be an inconvience to them if though it matters the most to me that they would care... I now have to call the doctor today about going on anti-depressents because Skye thinks it may help, I dont think it will but we shall see... Everything got really bad last night... Played poker horribly, people got pissed at me for no reason, got pulled over, the person I wish would be there for me wasnt cause she was to busy with some other guy, and now all I want to do is die... its just one perfect life for me"

Edit:
Summer air reminds me of all the feelings of your love,
And what it was like when we were together,
Walking all along the beach, you were never far from my reach,
And you held me through the stormy weather,


And I want to fall in love tonight,
And I remember when you said ""everything's gonna be alright"" 

Laying in the summer grass, you told me not to talk so fast,
As I told you how I feel,
You made me feel right at home,
You told me I was not alone and you knew just how I feel,

And I want to fall in love tonight,
And I remember when you said ""everything's gonna be alright"" 

I know we talked about it, I just can't get around it,
I just want one more night with you,

And I want to fall in love tonight,
And I remember when you said ""everything's gonna be alright"" 

October air reminds me of all the seasons of your love,
And what it was like when we were together
The smell of fall is everywhere and though it seems,
I just don't care, 'cause now you've gone away,

And I want to fall in love tonight,
And I remember when you said ""everything's gonna be alright"""

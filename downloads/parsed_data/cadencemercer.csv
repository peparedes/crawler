"event","things as of late are really quite... interesting.  although, i have to say i'm not impressed with how slowly my writing is progressing.  i'm sensing very little evolution, and i'm disappointed in the lack of growth my poetry and prose is presenting.

on the other hand, maybe that gives me something to concentrate on?"

You are the observer. You see everything but are a part of nothing. People usually come to you for information, or general advice. You are not afraid to help them so long as they do not involve you in their situation. You handle your own dilemas well, but when faced with others you may freeze. You form your own opinions on everything, and see life as fairly simple. Troubles may arise, however, from not acting quickly enough. No matter, though, patience is a virtue.<br><br><center><a href=""http://quizilla.com/users/Elblai/quizzes/Which%20Classic%20Story%20Role%20Do%20You%20Play%3F""><font size=""-1"">Which Classic Story Role Do You Play?</font></a><BR> <font size=""-3"">brought to you by <a href=""http://quizilla.com"">Quizilla</a></center></font>"

"event","y do things bad happen to me?.....
alright...what happened was i was throwing a ball around with my friends brit and danusha and danusha had the mit....so she and i were throwing the ball....and me and brit were busting on her at how she sucked at softball...and she didn't really suck...but she was busting on herself so we added stuff to....actually we were busting on all of us together...like i busted on myself on how i can't run for beans...and they joined in on that...and we did all this other stuff also....then when brit wanted her mit back to throw with me...i said ya danusha give it to someone who can catch...and i MEANT it as a joke...not for her to take seriously...and of course she did....wich usually happens to anyone when i say something as a joke -__-...so now im pissed and going on a guilt trip and have no idea why she is mad and all this other crap....
maybe i should just like take a vow of silence :-P...that way...no words would come out of my mouth and everyone will just be happy...but i don't know how long i could keep that up since i like to talk...

"event","so i went to the block party after all. but i only stayed for an hour... yeah, guess who was there. sigh.
now that this has happened, i don't know how much longer i can take this town. what i really wanna do is get in the studio, record, get back on the fuckin road! at least there i'm not so lonely. there's fans, boys willing to make out with me at my every whim. and i don't want to sound like some sort of slut, because really, it's not like that. i just get lonely.
sure, how can me, donna a, the girl with the three most awesome best friends in the world get lonely? i don't know...
i've been looking through pictures a lot tonight and i've noticed one thing. i'm hardly in any of them. i'm always the one taking the pictures, its always me behind the camera. i don't know, i just kinda guess it symbolizes something or whatever. 
don't mind me. i'm in a REALLY strange mood.

but i got AIM! ... IM me: LJ DonnaA .. :) i like friends."

"event","tonight there's a block party up by the bay bridge and a few kids invited me to go. i really don't think i want to go. but i should get out of the house right? that's the remedy to a broken heart. but i hate these parties. everyone gets all fucking trashed and makes out with their boyfriends and girlfriends and that was FINE with me when i actually had a boyfriend. but now that i'm single for the first time in two years i dont think i can handle it. i've got some Arbor Mist in the fridge with my fuckin name on it. classy, i know.

"event","So I was hanging out with Donna R. today and like, she wanted new socks and well, we live in fucking Berkley right, so we find a shopping mall. I go in there and the place is filled with Hot Topic adorned preteens and I just want to VOMIT! I even go in the store AND THEY'RE SELLING OUR CD! UGH! Yeah. Whatever makes me money. It's cool. Who wants to go out with me tonight? :)"

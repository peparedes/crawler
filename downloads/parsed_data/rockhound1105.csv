Yum! Then we went to get some drinks and put them in a cooler for after the dance. We went to the dance and stayed there until about 11 o'clock.

<P><FONT color=#c0c0c0 size=2>It is much more than going around in circles and turning left.&nbsp;Many people think that NASCAR racing is not a real sport. IT IS, believe it or not.&nbsp;The drivers and the pit crews are just as athletic as any other person in any other sport.&nbsp; Yes in other sports like football, baseball, or hockey, they are more built<EM>&nbsp;</EM>I will give you that. However, drivers and their pit crews all work out everyday.&nbsp; In order to handle the G-forces that you get while you're in a car goin at speeds up to 200 mph, you have to have endurance and strength in your arms and legs.&nbsp;Think about it.&nbsp;The driver's are in their cars for about 4 hours every Sunday.&nbsp;As for the pit crews, they have to carry tires that weigh about 70 lbs., and the tire changers have to handle an air wrench that would probably fly right out of your hand when you pull the trigger because it carries that much power.&nbsp;As for the crew chiefs, they have to make sure the car is set up correctly for that specific track.&nbsp;They have to make sure the tires are at the right angle, the engine is set up for that track, they have the right amount of wedge put into the car, the right set of shocks for that track, etc. For anyone that still hates racing, I challenge them to attend a NASCAR race.&nbsp;It might change your mind.&nbsp;I know it changed mine.&nbsp;I plan to go to the Pepsi 400 at Daytona next summer on July 5th, and tickets are not that expensive. Anyone who wants to join me, your more than welcome to come along. </FONT></P>

This is the third time this has happened. Once at school and twice at work. This is another reason that I want to by a lid cover for the bed. Who the fuck does that anyway.

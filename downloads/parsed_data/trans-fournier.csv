"event","<P>Yo son.. mhmmmm ... i painted my room today. It's pink, purple, and lavender, and maroon and yellow. It is very pretty, like Rhiannon's eyes. I wrote a wicked pretty love ballad today and I sent it to Ashley H. online.. and then she stopped talking to me. It was so funny. I would've played my guitar along with the love ballad but Jimi B, Kenny, and like 300 hndred other people trashed the shit out of it. Yeah.. Kenny punched it in half, it was so nuts. Yeah, approxiamtely two weeks until I start work with ThunderGuillermo and Jimi B. We're moving to Connecticut to go plow tobacco fields. It's gon' be slave labor. I drank lemonade and it made my throat burn.. and it made me feel like I was going to die- it felt like battery acid. Speaking of drinking, I was accused of drinking at school today because I was carrying my guitar and fell on it in the hall. Mr. Kelly said I was, ""Under the influence"" so I went down to Nurse Gould's office where I stayed for like an hour. I missed first period and then I was threatened to not tell anybody else or something bad would happen.. And then later at lunch, I threw a hot dog across the cafeteria and hit some faggot girl in the back of the head, good times. And of course, Mr. O'Brian came over and yelled at me first. Whenever something bad happens, it's always my fault. .. But the whole table denied me throwing it, so no one got in trouble. Yesterday Kenny, JImi B and myself brought exlax into school. We&nbsp;filled up a fruit2o bottle with it and got Jordan Lemay, Brian, and 40 other people to swig from the bottle of no returb. I guess we have dud shit juice because it didn't work and no one shit their pants. And that's all I can think of.. Oh, and I painted my room, again. The end. </P>

My mom is yelling about pots, and being very annnoying. I went to the library. I managed to find a few good books and a Dinosaur Jr cd, so...eh that was good. 

Leah wants to set me up with her friend Dillion. I hate boys. Blech. Well...I hate the boys that I know. They're grr. Yes, they are grr. That's the only *nice* word that I can think of right now."

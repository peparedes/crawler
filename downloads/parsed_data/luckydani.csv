i don't really have much to say except that it's now almost 430 in the morning and i'm not even tired and i can't wait to go to denny's in a little bit...
yeah so midterms week sucks, friggin hate it, but it's almost over right? i said right?
i really have nothing to say, i'm just killing time till bonnie's done with her paper so i can print it and we can go...i'm starving!
i think i'll be living off coffee today, if living could be the right word...maybe i just won't go to my 815 and sleep...no then i won't wake up for the class which has caused me to lose a whole night's worth of sleep, relaxation i got, but not sleep...can anyone tell by my freaking run-on sentences, jeez i hope my paper doesn't read like this...
but anyways just thought i'd post a little hi to everyone, and welcome myself to the livejournal galaxy!
see you all a little later!"

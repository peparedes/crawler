"event","Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. 11Put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes. 12For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. 13Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand. 14Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, 15and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. 16In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. 17Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. 18And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the saints."

"event","Being Black is a state of mind
Its not the full hips or big behind
Its not the nappy hair or the funky talk
Its not the way we act or the way we walk.
Being black is not a choice Its let freedom ring in a manly voice.  Being Black is bravery and determination. Its having strength to overcome in a color conscious nation.  Being black is full time work. ""Acting""Black is considered a pleasure. Our smooth Black skin is a treasure.  Its fleshy noses and big juicy lips. Its tight curly hair and full brown lips.  Being black is a different thing, cause being Black is the thing you bring.
Happy Black History Month

celebrate your blackness."

"event","well, i thought since i'm listening to madonna's hoilday, i should tell you guys about mine...it was fab!

here's what i love about PR. the second i get on the plane, i of course sit next to the dude that wants to chat me up. he was pulling lint of my shirt, and telling me hot spots in PR. he was like, i should get your # so i can show u around. i'm thinking, what are we bf now? anyway plane lands and everyone claps. i loved that. 

 in PR the maddness continues. We go bar hopping see same guy from plane...can u say stalker? but we were drunk so we were with it...he buys us drinks and i make out with his friend. the end. 

 from then on it was some drama, some tiffs, stupid stuff that could have been avoided if we planned the vacation out better, but hey, we're kids, we live and learn. after that we just relaxed and chilled. got up at noon, went to the pool, went to chilli's ( Ok, if you've been to chilli's in NY your like, ok what's the big deal, but in PR that shit was fucking amazing...the corn.. mmmm compliments to the chef.) with Diana & Jack aka DJ service was shitty, when Laura and i go by ourselves they treat us so nice. lol.

 after we would eat we would disco nap or shop or have some more drinks...(see when we were swimming we had drinks in the poolbar.) then go out at night...old san juan or a cute bar aka Barlovent or driving in G's car lol don't ask.

 bacardi factory i got drunk and like, mac'd it to the tour guide i was later told...i don't think i mac'd but u never know. ;) copped a few bottles for home, laura copped mad bottles and dj got away with a few too.

all in all we had a good ass time...i strutted around most of the time in my tropical outfits. i was HOT ya'll!! and the aerobics insructor caused alot of laughs...lol it was like some 17 year old kid they paid to drag me into everygame and contest they were having. fucking ultimate twister. made me mess up my hair rap!!!. damn u! and had the never to drag me away from my drink. pepito the bartender gave it to him the last day though...i know more english that u! i speak it everyday! LOL pepito...who hooked up the pina coladas with 151. what's really hood?! ahh so many memories...but i won't tell you anymore...i'll just leave you with the best memory...me asking georgi if he saw the animal in the bronx zoo. his reponse? !!!!!!!!!!!!!!LOS ANIMALES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

"event","hello. thursday was fun. jamie came in from boston to do her job as a nanny, an thursday was her night off, so i had to hang out with her yo! we went to red lobster for dinna, and she had never been to red lobster. i was like ""holy crap! you've never been to red lobster! that should be a crime!"" so we went and had lobster and shcrimp.

 then we went to webster hall for ladies night, and they had some strippers for our enjoyment ;). lol that was fun. then i took jamie back to her hotel and said goodbye, and walked approximately 1 block away from her, when this group of middle aged men goes up to me and says, ""hey, are we right?"" and i'm thinking what? but i recognized one of them from a the movie Waiting to Exhale, not that he's a huge star, but i knew who he was so i stopped and chatted for a bit, they were drunk so it was funny. they invited me to the premire of a new play that they are producing, and then i stopped talking to them and left. 

then i'm walking to the subway at 1:00am and i decided that it wouldn't be safe, so i took a $30 cab ride home. i got home and had like a 3 hr convo with her about just stuff. it was fun. i told her i went to a strip club and she was like, where is it and when does it open, cause i want to bring my girlfriends. i think it would be so funny if we went there together...hahaha. then i went to sleep and woke up at 10:30 to do it all over again. hot damn."

i went to work, only made one sale. i made two yesterday though, it was only my first day. wow for me. it's is from 12 to 5 my job, and i spend my time selling vacation packages to people from the midwest who go to things like, great american rv shows and big barbeque cookoffs in there spare time. they sign up to be qualified for this vacation, and then wham! i call them and tell them how great it is, they should go blah, blah, blah. these people actually listen too. i'm thinking, if this were a new yorker, i would have gotten a hang up before i could say ""hi, my nam..."" but whatever. as long as i gets paid baby.
i have been making mad plans lately...hanging out with jamie tomorrow, then with jamie and sal sunday, and next weekend (drumroll please) i will go to BK to stay with giz and dani and see siren fest! but i am mostly excited cause i get to go to nathan's and get myself a nice wienerdog. wienerdog! wienerdog!

"event","today taryn picked me up so that i could go to her house, chill and then go to the mall with her and nia so they could find baby shower gifts for a shower they are going to sat. we are sitting in her house posively melting because of the humidity, so i suggest a drive to get an application from bay terrace, get food and blast music and shout at random people. (for you see, this is what we do) what ended up happening was far from the lazy afternoon drive i had anticipated we would have. the storm started, and at first  we were like, ""oh just a little rain"". then the thunder showed up, which made taryn jump, then the rain began to just dump itself out of the sky. it was crazy...she could barely see the road, and we almost got into two accidents. we screamed like dion and cher in clueless when each near death experience looked us right in the eye and then turned and looked away. needless to say we said ""fuck an application and fuck food"" and went back to her house. her mom was there and gave us towels when we came in. later, nia got off work and we went to get the baby stuff. we acted crazy in the macy's baby section, and then we went home.

"event","hello! what took me so long! i finally have a live journal. now i can tell it the good news...and the bad news. the good news is that dee and majda invited me to PR!!! yeah! ready for the bad news? i have no job so therefore i have no money to be able to afford this trip. damn. oh well, guess i'll go to the puerto rican day parade and get molested instead.i am really not feeling this job search...it is not working out. I have landed a job selling knives, but i'll be damned if i'm going to go up to people and be like ""hey, wanna buy some knives?"" that's just not going to happen. well tomorrow the search continues...in the mean time missing my girls and brooklyn...even with your rats and crackheads you are so awesome...don't ask me why, you just are. 
                               -night, turn out the light."

"event","lets see here... its 16 hours before the organc final... and lets see who hasn't started studying???  you guessed it. me. i dont know why i do this to myself. its like im a masochist or something. taking pleasure in pain--pain being the fact that not studying actually DOES hurt me... in the long run... and brings a whole mess of emotions to me (makes me sad, feel stupid among others).
friday was remembering m4 night... where the suitemates +4 did something soooo m4 and smirnoffed it up at the suites. needless to say, it was a ""crazy"" night...  i guess not doing shots for a loooooong ass time really decreases tolerance. when did we get to be such pussies?  morning after i realized i was done after  5 measly shots. like what happeneed to me? oh well... i dont forsee myself really drinkin for a long time anyways. it is fun for the time being.. but the aftermath isn't worth it.  and people throwing up isn't good. wtg jeanie for successfully doing it (all over her bed)  after everyone called it first... maybe it was more of a  self-fullfilling prophecy (<~~~~ it's come up in conversation way too much lately).  it was a nice night. and drunken guesstures was fun. haha one of the words i had to do was ""worm""... so of course, me in my state, i got down on the floor and tried to do the worm... haha i hit my chin and now whenever i press it it hurts. oh stupidity. but yay that was the only stupid thing i did. [[no cartwheels on my forearms or backbends. ]]

i can't believe this semester is over. it flew by so quickly and im actually really sad its over. 'twas fun. next semester better be better... (although i won't be able to waste half the day in bed napping because my schedule will suck-- having back to back classes had its perks)

since x-mas is coming up....
i've been thinking... the best gifts areound realy aren't the tangible pricey things... (even though those are nice too). its cheesy, i kno, but its the abstract things like love, understanding, happiness, and forgiveness that probably are the most satisfying things to get. but when its fake... there's no point in any of it at all. -- the only real things in life are genuine.

"event","I can't help but feel like i'm losing it... well everything really. I guess that this just has to happen eevery couple of years in my life... but i really didnt' think it would happen so soon after uhm the last time... I thought this was was for good... but i guess i was wrong. I don't know how to make sense of the situation, except that it was my fault and i should have never said the things i did... I was just annoyed i guess...annoyed that people were accusing me of these terrible things, when i wasn't-- remotely at the moment... and here it was happening in front of me... but i shouldn't have judged and i should have been happy that someone was fortunate enough to be that... and I'm sorry.  I really am. i miss you. i'm falling apart. 
I know i'm being vague here... really vague. but if you are reading this.. you know who you are and you know exactly what i'm talking about.... and I'm sorry!!!!


but my parents need to go away more often...

this weekend instead of going home on friday, i went home on thursday instead. it allowed me to just bug out at applebees and eat mad food on the thursday tradition that i normally miss out on. Friday I woke up decently early, got my eyebrows done, went to the band to depositi a few checks, then went to bring icky food for lunch (how great am i?). i spent the rest of the day spending money.  I found some good deals especially at the GAP.  I was upset and borderline depressed though that i coudln't find anything i liekd at Arden B.... I need to get rid of that credit pronto!  But i also bought more shit that i ended up not liking.. i really need to stop doing that.. it's a friggin constant cycle--- buy shit, then go back and return it, only to se something else that i ike while i'm at the store and end up buying that with the money that i just go tback from the return... plus a few exctra dollars... and then go home to find out that i dont like some of the shit i bought... and i think you see what i mean...

friday night was nice.... people over my house with the screwdrivers and rolling rock, playing poker and singing... haha fun times. everyone slept over which was kinda interesting. and all of my brothers friends thinking skeet skeet was going on. 

Saturday i worked from 12-6... such a long day for little kids.... with merely a 15 min rbeak at 4pm.. i was starving... after getting out of work... i got into my car but it wouldn't start!!!!  Luckily, I thought of calling my summer employment to get me out of the bind... Yay, Honda of Essex to the rescue.. I called up Matt (haha i remembered the extension) cuz the receptionist wasn't picking up (it was after 6) and cried to him... and he sent over Shawn right away. It was nice seeing Shawn again.  I love that i can count on Honda.... hopefully i can work there again in the winter and summer and make mad money like i did this summer. :)  Icky and i had dinner at panera and we finsihed off the night with Fever Pitch,.... which was sadly a disappointment.

Sunday i went to church and lunch with my love and his fam. and spent the rest of the day not really doing much of anythign at all...

it was a good weekend. my parents really need to be away more often."

"event","i have to say that i'm proud of myself.  i (so far) have not missed any classes on purpose. . how many of you can say that?  on the downside however, i think i might have failed my first quiz of the year.... -- hehe. just a start to the year of organic chem, genetics, intro to microecon, intro to financial accounting, and social psychology... and many more failures to come.

my room is looking better than it did in the beginning of the year... for one, i have my most important stuffed animals here now... including my large bear and dottie.  and the walls are adorned with posters of a serene beach with a hammock, a half naked boy asking everyone to put him on his to do  list, 2 kids kissing (appearing to be saying goodbye, with the little boy holding a suitcase and a train in the background), duckies (cuz i love duckies) and the movie poster for the notebook... and of course, a whole bunch of quotes.  what is missing however, is all the other familiar faces i have grown to know and love (and ifyou knew what my room looked like last year with the collage on the wall.... i want to put pictures back up again).  

what sucks about this year is that i never see anyone. all my classes are back to back between 12 and 6. depending on the day. and everyone else has classes until later in the night.  so i usually sit  by myself in my room.... it could potentially give me a lot of time to catch up on work and stuff (but there's one problem. i dont have books yet).  so. i've been lounging around, not relaly doing much of anything. since i have so much free time, i have even contemplated getting a job around here... but thats just it, just contemplating, i'm just too lazy to do such... even though this summer has gotten me addicted to making money. 

... i've also been thinking... so yea college kids party... people out of college party.... when does the partying stop? as much as it is fun, it kinda gets a little redundant. dontcha think?  3 times a week * all the weeks we're here in school. then all the times over the summer. thats a lot of partying. like we have nothing better to do. which is the truth.. we dont. its sad. i feel bad for ourselves. that our existence is defined by our weekend. that all we look forward to is thursday where we can ""have fun."""

"event","Whoo Rutgersfest happened this past weekend.
The drinking started at 1pm by me and my cronies.  2:45 rolled around, and i made myself a bottle and headed off to class.  It was probably the best calc class ever.  The concert was kicking-- at least of what i saw of it. Elephant man's music was banging, and i heard the pit at dropkick murphy's was insane.  Too bad i was going around falling and trying to look for the porta-potties, which by the way are not fun....
That night, mad heads came down for the afterparty.  We hit up Lambda, which was perhaps one of the best nights out.  After Lambda, was Cluck then waiting for the drunk bus for forever.  
... Saturday we woke up at 3.  And wasted the day.  Then more peopel came over at night.  We finished some of the leftovers playing circle of death.  It was a good time."

"event","update about this weekend:

Jolenne and steph came over on friday night, and we were accommpanied with the boys [wayne, jeff, jon, timmy, and pete/icky]. first off, i wanna say im sorry to everyone that i was with on friday night.  i didn't mean to get carried away, and im sorry if i ruined all the fun.  i'm sorry for the way i acted, for the events that happened, for the things i said, and for the poor bus people.   i hope you call can overlook what happened, and we can do it again sometime, just to a lesser extreme (at least for myself). icky, thanks for being there that night. im mostly sorry that i acted that way and treated you like that...  

Jolenne and Steph slept over, only to be awakened at 8:30... which was pointless cuz Six Flags didn't happened... stupid rain. guess you can't plan things that far in advance.  

But it was cool cuz me icky, maryl, and gaelan ended up just watching Guess Who... a pretty cute movie.. it almost made me cry--- i've turned out to be such a sap lately, its pretty sad."

"event","I just finished re-watching CLOSER, the movie with Natalie Portman, Judd Law, and Julia Roberts.  I thought it was better this time.  To think that there are some people in this world that lie to that extent.  I don't quite understand it.  But in the end, they got what was supposed to happen, justice prevailed, or at least karma did.  It's so poetic in showing reasons that motivate people to live their lives without truth.   The characters are just displayed beautifully, not wanting to get hurt by the truth, too unhappy to own up to it, but too proud to.  Julia Roberts's character, Anna, doesn't know what the hell she wants.  Jude Law is too fickle in his romances.  Clive Owen's Larry is brut and strong, yet you just feel sorry for him.  Natalie Portman's character, Alice, is just a nieve girl, trying to find her way.   

After the movie ends, its just liek ""whoa"" what happened.  And its so sad because it gives such a realist/pessimist view on life/love.  Like you come out thinking that no relationship will ever work.  

One really great set of lines:

Dan: I owe you an apology. I fell in love with her. My intention was not to make you suffer.
Larry: So where's the apology? Ya cunt.
Dan: I apologize. If you love her you'll let her go so she can be happy.
Larry: She doesn't want to be happy.
Dan: Everybody wants to be happy.
Larry: Depressives don't. They want to be unhappy to confirm they're depressed. If they were happy they couldn't be depressed anymore. They'd have to go out into the world and live. Which can be depressing.

and then this one

Alice: It's a lie. It's a bunch of sad strangers photographed beautifully, and... all the glittering assholes who appreciate art say it's beautiful 'cause that's what they wanna see. But the people in the photos are sad, and alone... But the pictures make the world seem beautiful, so... the exhibition is reassuring which makes it a lie, and everyone loves a big fat lie.

it was refreshing to see this movie again. I caught details that i didnt see the first viewing.  It's truly poetic. Everyone go see it, especially if you feel like being sad afterwards."

"event","so the update about the weekend this memorable weekend since its finally over and all...

lets just say friday was probably the most scared i've been in a while. we pre-gamed in my dorm room for nick's b-day celebration. and then went off to platinum to dance the night away.  lets just say justin had a little too much to drink and he was all staring at nothing and when i would smack his face, he wouldn't respond. i was scared shitless and probably was the only calm one that was almost-sober... so i took care of the drunk guy.  i haven't done that since caitlin back in like sophomore year. whoa. but this time was scarier and definitely more intense and dramatic. its crazy how like just instinctual all that can be. its like  i went into mom mode and needed to just make everything better. he keeps saying that hes been a jerk to me in the past and has apologized for being an ass, but i don't see it as that at all. yea i may not have felt completely accepted by him or his mom for that matter, but i guess its hard to accept when you're unsure of alterior motives, or when you see someone who you're close to gettin so affected by the new person.  no matter what has happened, i will care.  no matter what will happen, i still will care.  like i said im glad this friday night happened. and and justin bonded, he told me a lot of stuff that hes kept in i guess for a while, even though he may have not been aware of it at the time (or still may not know or remember), i still know and he told me. that has to count for something.  it gave us a chance for a new beginning, if you will, even though i was oblivious to the fact that one was needed. new beginnings are always a good thing. a clean slate, a tabula rasa. where everything that happened is in the past and everything that will happen is what counts. friday although dramatic, scary, and not as much fun as i hoped it would be to end my week was a good night and also as i said before it was a good experience that i wouldn't trade for anything else. 

saturday was another story... Score! i thought i would have forgotten everything, but holy begeesus, its friggin second nature, ingrained into my skull for all eternity... greeting people when they walk in, name game, high fives, b-ball shots, score cards, enthusiasm, and smiles all around. yaay score! although a lot of the kids didn't remember who i was even though i remembered them.  and that made me sad. saturday night was chill, starbucks how it used to be (sorta)  but then icky went to the hospital, and yet again, me doing the comforting and taking care of... well at least on the way there, not liek i did much. i knew it could't have been that serious, but i was still scared outta my mind.  i cant imagine how it feels like to have no clue as to waht the situation might be, just waiting for some answer to calm down, get a glimmer of hope, to know the truth. its scary that experiencing that type of uncertainty is bound to happen in life. i just dont want it to happen anytime soon. 

so its been a lesson learning weekend. i didn't get to catch up on sleep, nor did i do much studying (or any for that matter), but its those important life lessons that i got to learn, and i can't really complain about that can i?  its what ive been waiting for."

"event","ok.. so taking a break from writng a 4-5 page paper the day before school lets out.. how insane ((haha Ike has an exam tomorrow morning though, so i feel bad for him)).  [this might just be the thinking that i haven't done in sooo long]

I know I do it too.. but i guess i never really understood how people masked their feelings. (haha like the public and private transcripts -- oey!).  maybe that makes me a hypocrite.. since i do it too, but i dont get how it happends...  are they trying to protect themselves by doing it? are they trying not to seem vulnerable?  vulnerability is a big thing-- i believe it is the reason guys don't cry in public-- in order not to seem vulnerable, to be deemed a feminine little bitch.  but liek emotions are such a big part of who people are.. so why can't people just express exactly what they are feeling-- instead of trying to distort it and junk.  i dont really know why i do it. perhaps its because i never really know what im feeling.  or maybe at times i just really dont want to feel anything. i could be in denial of my feelings-- is that even possible?  

i also dont get how people get judged... or even more, WHY people judge.  does it make them feel better about themselves??  does it somehow put justice into the world.  and then where does first impression cross the line where judging reside??

true friends:  i'm beginning to think that i dont know what that word means... i used to think i had my good, true friends.. but over this weekend, i guess i've realized that some that i perceived to be true, reallly aren't.  and that makes me mucho sad.  ok maybe.. this doesn't go to the whole ""true friend"" extreme... because i know thse people will alwyas be there for me.. but it does definitely go to the ""good friend"" thing... you think you know someone and they just surprise you. right???  wow previous thoughts coming into light again.  hm.. things change, people change-- wow haven't i herd that one before...

which brings me to ther whole i miss those that were formerly such a BIG part of my life.  i know it definitely was partially my fault... and maybe in some aspects totally my fault.. but then other times it just didn't seem to work out in the end. and although i thought i was ok with it, im not.. -- the holdiays really bring these ideas into my head... when i just want EVERYTHING to be amazing and awesome and have everything the way that i want it-- and in some aspects the way they were.  

there are soo many feelings of longing that i have.. not necessarily regret. because you only regret things when looking in retrospect, and you obviosuly would not have that option before you do the action... no one knows what is gonna come out of people's actions in this world, so how can you regret???  you will not know what will happen.. so as long as you can sleep at night, knowing what actions you have completed, then you shouldn't regret...

well i thnk thats all i gotta go write more now. peace peace

oh yea-- Happy Thanksgiving y'all... eat madd turkey and get uber stuffed."

uhm.. well yeaa im at college. I've let low on the whole yaay we're in college thing...and im currently juss tryin to make the best of the whole chillen in dorm thing. its goin aiight, EVERYBODY is damn crazy soo much. its all good times though, and i aint complaining. 
i had a psych exam a couple weeks ago, and that wasn't too bad.. all multiple choice out of the study guide, so i was kosher... but tonight was the chem exam, and although i didn't get raped as i thought i would have, im not happy. :( 
i must say though.. despite all the crazy and aweome times that has conspired through the course of 4 sum odd weeks that i feel like i've been somewhat holding back.. that im not maximizing my time here for some reason. liek even though its great and all... i know it can be better. could it be the lack of extra-curricular activities form my schedule as compared to my long list from hs? maybe its the lack of those deep bonds with people here after only knowing them for 4 weeks...  maybe its just my own psyche telling me to be cautious because no one else is opening up... i need a way to get organized and actually organize my time and stick to a schedule so i dont have to stay up every mo fo-n monday to do and finish my expos paper (which this final draft will probably be a NP). i need to stop spending money, becuase my bank is depleating in funds.  i need to call friends more, because i feel lost and out of touch with like almost everyone. i want to make this experience MINE and not anyone elses... i want to do things because i want to, and not because others want me to. i want to live like i want to. i want less homework. i want more easy grades. i want it to be highschool again. i want to visit the mount and be greeted with those ever-so friendly hi's and smiles that i have grown so accustomed to for the last 4 years of my life.. i want the smiles and hi's i get now to feel the same as they did last year. i need more sleep. i need to put down my thoguhts more.. ebcause there have been soo many almost-xanga moments.. that i was toof rightened to post online... i need to stop being scared and just fuck what everyone else thinks... right??  hmmf. i need to stop wasting food at the dining hall. i need to refrain from eating cheese fries every friggin day cuz then im gonna get fat.. i need to start going to the gym more religiously as i said i was going to.  i need to STOP FORGETTING. i need to stop fucking things up. i need to study more. i need to start doing my homeowkr and raeding the chapters. i need to stop procrastinating. ha. i need to stop telling myslef that procrastination is the cool thing. i need a sappy love song cd, i need to get more money... i need to find a job- maybe. i neeed an alarm clock. i need to get better at super smash brothers.  so its all comes back to change.. the persistent change. i'm beginning to think its a friend, and not so much an adversary (at least not at this point)... i dont like being sad. i dont like being mad at myslef. i dont like ahving someone disappointed in me. i dont like being disappointed in myslef. i dont like when i dont understand things. i dont like when i dont get the purpose of the game. i dont like not being able to figure things out. i dont like being less than perfect. i dont like gettin dirty looks. i dont like when people are left out. i dont liek when im left out. i dont like when things chnge that i dont want to change.  i dont like going all the way to douglass campus... i dont like making 2 trips to douglas and 2 trips back to bush every thursday. i dont like not being able to be on bush all day on tuesdays and thursdays. i dont like having 8:10 lab on douglas on thursdays. i dont like 8:10. i feel inferior to soo many people here. i feel stupid compared to everyone else about 75% of the day. i feel like im not good enough. i dont revere my ""accomplishments"" to be as great anymore. i dont think im the super-tine as i was once looked upon. everyday i feel more and more as my bro describes me as- worthless/useless... i think i just take up space.. its like my purpose. i do like the chocolate waffles. i like the lack of supervision. i like staying up doing nothing, i like sleeping in until like 11 or later. i like not being the youngest. i dont like not being able to get into clubs (yet). i like everyone cuz they're nice. i like mooching for food from everyone. i like metger 3. i love icky. yea i gues thats a little venting.. cuz i dont know who's still there.

"event","ahh holy shit. the concert was awesome. DJ Logic opened which was mainly techno, but while that was happening, the girls and i were talkin to Romeo and Nikko, Z100 djs , and we got on the radio... yep yep the screaming and shout outs were made by us at around 7:30 on tuesday afternoon.  so now i know that whenever people are screaming... it probably isn't a ton of people-- just like 3 or 4 girls that scream loud as fukk. [even worse if they're mounties]. but yea.. maroon 5 was aiight- i didnt really know their songs before hand besides the ones on the radio.. but there is this one song that was great by them live that i liked a lot. hehe. but i wouldn't be able to tell you which one is actually was... then during the set change to john i tried gettin food with katie and we were gonna cut this couple or at least add our order with theirs.. but then i realized that it was someone from my past- and.. yea i didnt want to do that or go there. and i was scared to. lol-- ahh im soo immature and i need to get over it , i know. but then john came on, and i ran-- fast and then in the 2nd row right before the VIP sections was empty-- so yet again we went seat hopping and turns out that they were maroon 5 fans cuz no one showed up for them. Granted, John WAS better this year vocally and all, but his songs were better last year... there's just something about ""heavier things"" that i don't like... i hope his next one is better. but yea.. there was this one part when he wraped his arms around his guitarist and played on his guitar.. and vice versa- it was really cool. i was impressed. .  erm. then the lights went out and they thanked everyone.. and but of course the screaming jersey fans wanted more.. so he came back on and did 3 more songs, one of which was 3X5 so it was aiight.. but there was no comfortable or love soon. ahhhhh!!! i was dying cuz that's all i wanted to hear. but still when he sang ""come back to bed"" i was all up for it. lol. [j/k icky]. oo also during his encore set, i went past security and got into the vip section.. but it definitely wasn't as good as laura's 3rd row seats. damn bitch. ha ilu laura!!! after the concert, we went to 6 bros and ran into katie and kaelan's friend, chase... who is amazingly funny. =)

Wednesday... i had the car and the house all to myself for the day cuz the rents went to atlantic city.. but nothing really wild and crazy came out from it.. too bad. i visited icky in his lockdown. and we wated boys and girls, which was aiight i guess. i also tried frinding the perfect bathroom caddy, but i just can't.

thurs: bella was over, so i coudlnt' do much.. but then dinner with the girls at none other than cloverleaf (what better place to reminisce and say goodbye). and lisa told me about this bathroom caddy that is mesh and folds.. so i gotta hit up bb&b to find it. 

  **i can't believe we're goin to college-- some already there and some leaving sooner than others. it's a big change and we're all going to be forced to live differently. for those of us who don't liek change, we'll get through it i promise, but at least we'll always have those that have been there along the way and will continue to be there for those rough times when all you wanna do is go home to a familiar place and familiar faces and bitch about your life. --i luv you girls.. i'm gonna miss you sooo much. now we're gonna have to go back to being polite and stuff at least at first until they get to know the real us. then we can let loose and have a wild time. live it up gurls. we've deserved it. 

today: went nectarine picking.. then thai fooding... then ac meeting (ha juss me n charles)... then ac outing... then met up with ppl at starbucks... then to yan's to say goodbye...
sigh... yan's leaving & im sad as helllll!!!  boo. i hate goodbyes."

anyways... college is soon away and just liek the rest of the crowd, i've done most of my college shopping... i still have yet to find a perfect bathroom caddy but other than that i think now i just need to talk to my roomie again and figure out what we're sharing/what we're not. seems simple right? but naa its not... there's awkward silence and i dont like that so although people have had hour long conversations with their roomie.. mine was only 6 minutes long. and i still dont know anything about her except that she plays GOLF and is from CONNECTICUT.. does anyone sense a problem here? lol. am i gonna hate my rooming situation? i can't help but feel liek im judging.. but wait, i am. shocker.
i was talking to a friend yesterday.. and after my dry spell of completely unimaginative and stimulating thoughts.. i finally had one. (props)-- age is merely a number it doesn't mean anything. a 30 year old could act 21 because they have never matured and ""grown up"". or a 16 year old could act 50.. or at least be as wise as 50 depending on the experiences he/she has and what he/she has taken from them. -- so ok maybe its not original and that thought has been previously thought, but i dont think by me. so doesn't that count? but i also got back to my analyzing people stages... cuz somehow i just miraculously ""read his mind"" or so he says. so hm... is the old me coming back?"

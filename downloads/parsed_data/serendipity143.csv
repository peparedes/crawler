"event","today is the one day that will not go fast enough i did not get to see any of my friends i am really fucking sick and can't make this fucking headache go away and i did not get my reeces. other than that i slept till 1 and then could not leave the room because the man of the house was on his lunch break for about 3 hours so i really had to go to the bathroom and couldn't for a while. so i finally did and it was like niagra fucking falls. i found out my teacher is mad at me becasue i was supposed to run sound but did not go to school today. today is just one of those terrible horrible no good very bad days. on a good note i have started to write again like one of my stories and am now attemting to write poetry again. my storie only has like two paragraphs in it but that is a start and i have written very few poems but again its a start but what can you do. i am fianlly updating this thing becasue i have been asked to repeatedly but hey thats life. ask enough and people will say ""fine, fuck, whatever"" but that is my life today fine, fuck, whatever. later"

"event","i keep having htis reacurring dream and its violent and i know why but i still don't understand...


     i am nice and famouse my career has kicked off big and i am rich and throwing a huge party all my freidns from highschool are there but none of the celebs i now know. the alchohol is flowing and the pipes and bongs are being passed in every direction and my angel walks up to me completely fucking drunk and says the guest of honor just arrived. by this time i am more than a little fucked up but i notice that there are baseball bats in everyones hands, and he walks through the door, he steps about ten feet into the house and a big net comes up from the floor and sweeps him into the air suspending him above everyone. it slowly lowers and people start to cicrle the net and rasie their bats and take swings,blood spills onto the floor as the ""guest"" gets hit and they keep swinging then they all stop after beating the ""guest"" for like five minutes and my angel walks up with a bong in one hand and a lead pipe in the other and says take a a real good hit, the take another. i hit the pipe and feel the smoke enter my lungs and i start to let it out  but she tells me to hold and to take my next hit and hands me the pipe. she walks me over to the ""guest"" and the smoke is still in my lungs and i am now getting a little lightheaded but i put every thing i have in to my hit and nail him, i hear his skull split wide open and see the blood gush onto the floor and everybody is cheering and having a great time, but i don't stop. i swing the pipe again and again and i hear him moan, hes not dead, i put everything i have into and nail him right in his face and watch his teeth clatter to the floor after that i release the smoke from my lungs and they drop the net to the floor and it is carried outside and the dogs atack whats left of him, the party continues nobody thinks anything is wrong. the last thing i think is that is the end of Josh Knight.

then i wake up same dream for like three weeks now, kinda disturbing"

"event","the love of my life says i have changed, yet everyone changes. me and her had this talk at the begining of our relationship. yet that doesn't seem to change the fact that people change. of course not. i am the one who is always wrong. she is telling me over and again how she does not believe a word i tell her. or that the feelings i have for her are not true. but they are yet, and she refuses to believe it. she tells me to prove it, how do i prove feelings, it takes time you can't just rip your beating heart out of your chest and hand it her and say hear is my heart. but that probably would not be enough proof right. well then what the hell am i supposed to do? i am running out of answers all the time. if i don't have the answers i am not trying if i try to answer but am wrong she is mad... its like a double edged sword, damned if you do damned if you don't

what does it matter, she is a beautiful girl who can have her pick, but she does not beleive that, she tells me another guy likes her adn i have nothing to worry about. i believe her, but does that mean i have to be ok with it. i can't stand the fact that this guy knows me and her are going out yet he still has to make it bluntly clear that he likes her. i al most got into a fight with one guy last year because of that same thing yet it is ok.why?????

my friend asked me to more in depthabout my journals but how these are the thoughts that i am thinking they come out this way but i will try for the novice out there. 

this is the end of another day in my life so yeah...

"event","i am now sitting in school being bored out of my mind with all kinds of thoughts racing through my mind. a revalution is planned but who will really take part of course most say they will but that most will be reduced to few by sheer cowardice. its not a big revalution or anything just something i believe in it is incredibly hard to find a way out of this miserable existance yet even harder to make it all any better. friends will come and go and as has been proven so does my family so who will be left in the end or will i be completely left alone to wander and not know. always wondering what if... that is why or how or when, i reach that age that so many can't wait for soon and i feel as if i am beyond in my mental capacity feeling as those so many are begining to forget about who i am or what i do and why, but nobody knows why i do not even know why anymore i have become a droid in my own oblivion continuosly going but never knowing why and just trying to make it. thats all we are really tring to do is make it, but so many of us fall short but never even realize it. why continue to set your self up for the dissapointment that you know will come. but this must end before i reapeat any more.
the questions come and go but the answers are never there."

"event","another day another way. well today i realized yet again when you plan things out things go wrong and when they finally start going right a wrench gets thrown in to throw everything into a swirling oblivion.
the world will never be quite what it seems all those always there for you will soon be gone it is that dark realization that we all have to succomb to at one point which is terrible enough. but to then have to move on and continue a pitiful existance almost seems to much if you are making one person happy you are pissing ten off it fucking sucks thats why we do what we do
sex drugs rock and roll
well i guess i have exsplained my emaotional state for the past five minutes so onto the rest of your existacne
too much to bear

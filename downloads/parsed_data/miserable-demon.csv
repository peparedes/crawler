"event","Well things haven't gotten better since my last post. But at least people are sooo into their Myspace that they don't really read this. I could say anything and I still probably wouldn't get a response...lol kinda cool. So I'm sitting at work listening to the Greatest Hits of the 50's and 60's! 
This whole thing with Barbara is getting to be too much. I'm really starting to like her and I get upset if I don't hear from her. How pathetic am I? She's never going to leave her boyfriend...he treats her like she's inferior to him and she likes it. I wish people knew how much I treat the girls I'm with. Maybe I'd have people liking me...So school sucks and I'm sick all the time b/c I'm so depressed from all this shit..not just Barbara but everything. I don't have any friends except Jenna and I love her to death but I want someone to love. I want someone who likes me and who I like and who actually wants to be with me. Someone I can hold at night and just be happy. If only people knew how I really am. I believe my personality and attitude has completely turned around since all of this. I don't talk to people or make an attempt to be funny like I used to. I'm not blaming this on anyone just saying how much it sucks that I have to feel this way. I start my day happy and end my day happy and for one reason, I just wish the middle was happy. I wish I could make people happy again. 
Oh well enough of that sad stuff...I just wanna say Happy Birthday to Jenna!! 
I'm off to help the old people!

"event","So its been almost a year to the day that I last wrote in my journal...yet I have the same problem as before. 
Alex and I broke up about 2-3 weeks ago...She is now going out with Eb and in case no one knows who that is, she's a journal and has a really big nose! Well anyways...so this month has become hell not only did my girlfriend break my heart and start dating someone not even a week later but when we were going out, I gave up the majority of my friends while we were dating. 
Anyone seeing the problem????
So now that my only friend is Jenna and I like Barbara still, I mainly sit in my room and sob. Barbara and Maynor have been dating and then not dating and so on since Alex and I broke up so everytime I think things are going well, they get back together and I'm back down to nothing. So now what do I do?? I am thinking of just giving everything up. I'm so sick of people thinking that they can just use me and then get rid of me whenever its convenient for them. I envy you guys not still in school b/c you can just break up with someone and not have to worry about seeing them in different classes or try to stop liking someone without having to see them in the halls. I can't wait to get out of school and move away to some place like Iowa, really now, who lives in Iowa...no one so I don't have to worry about people hurting me like they do there. I can just sit in the corn fields and wait for a UFO to come and abduct me and do funny tests on my brain! It beats the hell out of getting hurt all the time! Anyone think I should continue bitchin? I didn't think so...well if anyone wants to hang out or laugh at me write me back...

"event","Ok incase everyone didn't already know, I've had a really weird like month. lol But just recently Alex and I broke up again (my fault of course) and I've been going back and forth between Barbara and Alex. Many of you would look at that situation and go umm..obvious decision right? Well I do love Alex and I love every moment I'm with her and everything about her but then there's Barbara. I like her too but not the same way I like Alex but is that because I've been with Alex for longer? hmmm...this is what my head has been doing. This weekend is going to determine ALOT like ALOT ALOT lol I was with Alex last night for like an hour sitting in my car crying..doesn't seem like we should be apart huh? And then tonight I went over there and we sat and talked and it was awesome cause it was like just us. Noone there to hide from and I feel like thats what I have to do with Barbara. I don't like being very open about my relationships like infront of the world. And we all know that shit spreads like a wildfire in band. EVERYONE has a mouth on them. So my question is what do I do...? I really miss Alex but is it fair to keep doing this. Maybe I'm not good enough for her anymore. I don't know whats going on anymore. I just feel like crying all the time and I don't thats normal for someone who broke up with the other person out of the blue to be feeling does anyone know what I mean? It sounds like I already know my choice lol but I want to make sure that if I beg for Alex back that I have no feelings for Barbara and I do so...WHAT DO I DO!?

I know I barely write in my journal and when I do its all me bitching lol and asking for help. But I figure thats what its for. Well if anyone can help me please reply,e-mail, or IM me

Love you guys,

I can't believe everyone made such a big deal including myself over that hurricane and then we got like NOTHING! I was so worried b/c Alex was supposed to go up to her dads in Ft. Pierce and the hurricane was like bad up there. 

Oh well everyone's fine! YEY. I don't really like the classes I'm in but I heard that they weren't doing anything about them. I can't believe how many people are in our school there's like 900 something people in one of the lunches and like 800 something in the others. Thats nuts! Whats really sad is that I'm still not in either of Alex's lunches!

I'm excited but then I'm not b/c I've enjoyed being able to do whatever I want everyday all summer. Like I've hung out and stayed with Alex for 3 nights in a row and last night I didn't and it was like damn...school starts and I can't hang out with her everyday. :( 

But then I get to go back and see all my cool band buddies..ok well I don't have many band buddies but oh well. For some reason I'm not like totally objecting to going this year I guess is what I'm trying to say. 

This is a time to enjoy people! Don't let little things get in the way like the ""I like her or my life is going by so fast"" this is your prime! Enjoy it whatever your going through will pass. Don't ruin the times you have now b/c in a few years all your life will be is an office building everyday 9-5 and noone likes that. 

I guess I just wish everyone would just be happy cause I am damnit! lol Oh well its time for me to go sit at Ed Morse Honda for an hour hopefully its not 3 like last time. Bye everyone!

Wow I wish that Alex could have been here to see me make a total fool of myself at the talent show thing. I guess I didn't have much talent! But I do have to thank ONE PERSON! KELLY! YEY! She helped the stupid me find my love. jk that sounds so like...brittany spears doesn't it. Anyways it was fun and I'm glad I looked really stupid.

I can't believe Sanz actually made me and Chelsea both section leaders but I'm glad. She keeps mentioning that she doesn't want to play mello but that its too late and I really wish that she would say something to Sanz b/c if she doesn't want to be there then I think she needs to say something. Aren't I right? Maybe I just want to have control of the section but I really just want to do things the way Anthony did it and the way its been done and not have to ok everything with someone else first. I feel like we're both kinda fighting for power if anyone understands that. 

Anyways now that everyone knows my life is revolved around band I think I'm gunna go. Not that I care who knows b/c the only people that are really going to be reading this are people in band or gaurd but oh well. I'm out. I'll update soon I promise!

Tomorrow is my 5 month anniversary with Alex. Wow 5 months I never thought it would last this long but I'm soo happy it did! I'm glad I picked her! It was a good choice. The only problem is that I still have Barbara on my back like a monkey! She'll get over it sooner or later!

"event","Hey I people complain that I never post(Nat)so here it goes! I had a great weekend! I hung out with Alex on Saturday we went with Jeff and Chris to see Matrix then she stayed at my house. :-D Then on Sunday she came with us up to Melbourne and the whole time I was just sitting there staring at her beauty. And the whole time we were coming home my mom was talking about Danny and the day he died and everything that happened and I just couldn't stop holding onto Alex she was like my savior at the time..she helped me get through that ride home whether she knew it or not!
We then had school on Monday and it was ok b/c it was an Alex day even if she was bein a brat b/c she was tired and then I got home and was talking to Nat on the computer. She asked what I was doin b/c we had no school today(Tuesday) and I said nothing so she kinda got the thought of going to see Alex again in my head so I did. We went and saw Radio and I cried like a little baby! Oh well it was really good and I stayed at Al's house. 
Jenna called and kinda invited herself over today after Alex got home from babysitting her neighbors at 8 in the morning till 11. Then proceeded to get mad when we stay in Alex's room and slept while she sat out on the computer. She left without a word to either of us. Nice! She comes over to a house with her two friends who are going out and noone else is home did she expect us to not be with each other the whole time? HELLO!?!? Wouldn't you?
Oh well I'm like dyin I'm soo tired. I came home from dinner with my dad and did everything to avoid my mother b/c of this hicky I have on my neck so I went STRAIGHT to my room and started practicing Jupiter. I love that song! Too bad I suck and it sounded like shit. But hey all I can do is try my hardest and practice and try to impove in anyway possible right? My dreams for going to U of M are kinda down the drain right about now. They're a music school and the only chance of me even coming close to getting in is to hope they're having a dry horn year or becoming a music major. I dunno if I want to major in music though...I think I need these two more years of high school to help me figure out my life more. 
Well this week will hopefully go by fast! I'm going with Alex this weekend to her dad's! A whole weekend with my love I can't wait! I hope everyone else is having a good week. I'm outy

I haven't really had anything fun or exciting goin on that you haven't already read in some other band geeks journal...they keep people updated more or less. lol 

My mom just had a friend who's son died of a herione od and its like my mom says ""dredging everything with us back up."" I haven't really thought about him that much and this is the time of year when I get emotional with all the holidays. I miss him like no other no doubt but I kinda let it go until its brought up and its comin all back now. We're tryin to help her through everything and I'm just remembering the shit I went through when it happened and how I felt and its startin to suck. I know that alot of people don't really care about a word I'm sayin but this is a journal and I'm gettin shit out. 

Anyways new not so depressing topic! lol Marching band is like pretty much over for us. No more practices but we still have 2 games. I'm kinda happy b/c I'm more interested in French Horn then Mello. I like playin real music and gettin into it and feelin the beautiful sound rather than marchin around and playin a horn thats NEVER in tune! lol 

Well I think I've updated you enough in my life everything else is pretty much the same. I'm still gay and still have Alex...so incase you were wondering thats all the same. Still can barely stand Jenna. Like the rest of the world. lol She's still tryin to get me and Alex apart so she can get in my pants...AINT GUNNA HAPPEN! lol You can have her Nat if you'd like...haha! PLEASE SAY NEVER TO THAT! lol

I also have the freakin Mrs Packman song stuck in my head b/c Melissa was playing it the whole time. Well anyways. I feel asleep on a double waterbed at like 4:30 with 4 people on there. Not easy! Jenna ended up getting off but it still wasn't that comfy. 

Then we went to the mall today. I HATE SHOPPING. But Jenna had like 200 dollars to spend so...I went and we spent like all but 5 bucks! It was fun running around from store to store but since I didn't get a lot of sleep I like passed out in the car on the way home. Yea I'm like dying! 

We have competition next weekend! Hopefully we don't suck as bad as last time because it was embarrassing having the worst band in our division! Oh well I'm gunna get yelled at again no matter if we do good or not. The 18th is my one month with Al and I know she's gunna bitch again that I'm not with her....LIKE I COULD HELP IT!?!? lol alright well I'm falling asleep on the keyboard! so I'm out!

People are so worried about themselves to realize all the good they really do have. Like band... the freshman are worried about the heat or the bugs or how uncomfortable they are to realize how bad they make the band look and sound. Even the seniors are doing it b/c they don't care anymore. 

I wish people understood that this is life! I'm not talking to the few of you that have EVERYTHING wrong in their lives but the one's that complain ALL THE TIME. Your the one's that piss me off. I used to be part of that group and I guess this year has made me realize how many there actually are. There are soo many things to be happy about. Like new babies coming into the world..sounding good as far as band goes..seeing your friends..knowing you have people that love you(like me if your reading this!). 

Well I'm actually in a good mood even though this letter doesn't sound like it. I just saw my sweetheart even though it was only for like 2 hours...hey seein her is seein her!

We both we're grinning from ear to ear. Then Friday Jenna and her missed their bus so they walked to my house with Amanda,Gabby and I. 

Well Kayley asked out Jenna. Now I don't have to worry about Jenna liking me that much anymore. But Barbara was kinda upset today. She like bitched me out b/c I didn't tell her I was going out with Alex. Well who cares!? I didn't like tell anyone Alex told everyone. Not that I mind at all, but whatever.

"event","Wow last night was the best! As most of you know, Alex spent the night last night so I'm not only happy I'm estatic! I love that girl so much but I feel bad b/c I have to tell Barbara how I feel. If you didn't already know. Alex and Barbara both like me(god only knows why) anyways and I've been having this battle in my head on who I really like. I've known all along that I cared about Alex more but didn't think she was as interested as Barbara was so I kinda held back what I was feeling. News flash she does like me as much as Barbara! 

Now how do I tell Barbara that I want to be with Alex? Here's the 411 on Barbara...her mom and her mom's boyfriend just broke up. He said he couldn't live with someone who's a bisexual so of course her mom's blamming everything on her. Now not to mention her mom says she doesn't like it here anymore so they're moving back to Tampa before the end of Barbara's Freshman year. Which is this year...So what I'm worried about is that if I tell Barbara that I want Alex, even if its in a nice way, that Barbara will be distrought!

I don't want to hurt her but I also can't continue acting like I haven't made up my mind b/c she's going crazy. I've known like since I met Alex that I liked her more but I didn't think she was interested like Barbara is and I think she is. When I'm with her, I'm in a totally different world! And its like being on cloud 9 the whole time. 

Now another thing...Yesterday Alex almost didn't come over b/c Jenna was at her house and she felt bad b/c Jenna wanted to stay the night with us(yea she doesn't quite get it) and I was like I just want to be with Alex. So Jenna was like crying in Alex's room. Of course everything worked itself out and we hung out with Jenna until like 7:30(which felt like forever) and as you know Alex spent the night. NOW the thing that I'm worried about is...is Jenna going to pull those tricks all the time even if Alex and I are going out and try to be included on EVERYTHING? or do you think she'll get over it and I won't have to worry about having her there? I don't mind her there its just that Alex and I can't even like kiss when she's there b/c I feel bad. Jenna used to be and still is 120% in love with me. And I feel like I'm breaking her heart so thats why I don't like to have her with us when Alex and I are together..ya know? 
Well now that I spilt my guts out and let EVERYONE know all my problems I'm gunna go...I'll check in later PEACE

"event","I seriously don't know what to do. Today was great! Well it was playathon so it can't be that good...but I was with people I like all day. Well and the fact that I love playin my horn and I love the feeling of doing a good job when we play/march. Yea I know I'm a HUGE ASS band geek! lol But I was also around the person that I kinda like all day. But I don't know what to do! Sarah's telling me to just go along with it and see what happens but I'm the most impatient person in the world! So who do I pick? I guess now isn't the time to figure it all out. Anyways on to a different subject... I got to see my DADDY TODAY! He was showin off his feminine side today in his lovely pink shirt which he thought was orange but whatever. Oh yea and my mom,Chris,Eric and Nicole were all there but they aren't as important as my dad and Leanne. Eric had his video camera so he thought he was cool but whatever! Oh yea he thinks Kramer SUCKS! thank you finally someone not in band noticed! I think Anthony should just keep takin his notes and playin them to piss off Andrew! I got sooo burnt today! My dad's like omg your like PURPLE! I felt like saying oh YOUR FAVORITE! Well I gotta go talkin to someone important....PEACE

"event","Ok this is weird! I have everyone telling me they like me and I don't know what to do. Do I go for the person I've been liking or do I go for the new one? They both say they like me but one seems more interested than the other. I never thought this would EVER be a problem for me! I know it doesn't seem like something I should be complaining about but its kinda confusing because what happens when I get with both of them and then I can't decide who I want and I end up loosing two really great people? HELP! Chels"

"event","I think there is a mouse in my house.  Thank goodness I move tomorrow.  Rowdy is going nuts from room to room sniffing.  Currently she is clawing at a closet door while whining.  I am afraid to open the door and find out what is in there.  I hate mice.  I really hope it stays here and doesn't move with me.  

Well today I became a homeowner.  I closed a few hours ago.  I immediately took Rowdy over to the new house.  She ran around, looked out every window, and pooped in the yard.  She loves it!  Now I need to build a fence that will hold her in and we will be set.  The house needs a bit of work, but that will wait until Eric comes home.  I have already met the neighbors.  They seem nice and were cool with a privacy fence.  It is the only thing that will hold Rowdy in.  My sister-in-law is coming down tonight to help me clean the new house.  It needs a good dusting and freshening.  

Wedding plans have come to a screeching halt.  The ceremony is booked for Las Vegas at Mandalay Bay.  The reception will be in Kansas City later, but I have nothing booked.  I need to get my butt in gear.  I haven't had the time or desire to do it, but now that the house is finished I can start again. I thought maybe when I actually could plan I would enjoy it.  I hate it.  I see why people elope so much.  The planning process is draining."

"event","&nbsp;I decided to stop by the animal shelter today because there were a few dogs I was interested in.&nbsp; They have a German Shorthair Pointer that is solid liver.&nbsp; She is 3-4 years old, and adorable.&nbsp; She was running circles in her kennel which is exactly what Rowdy does.&nbsp; I think my lease states only one dog is allowed, but I really want her.&nbsp; I think she and Rowdy would get along great.&nbsp; It says she gets along great with dogs.&nbsp; She was given up because the owners didn't have time or something.&nbsp; She was really skinny, but I could fatten her up quick.&nbsp; Maybe if she is still there next week I will have Eric look at her and give his input.&nbsp; I would be outnumbered for a few months, but I think I can handle it.&nbsp; Maybe.&nbsp; I also switched Rowdy's food.&nbsp; I couldn't choose between an organic type or holistic type so I am going to try both to see which one she likes more.&nbsp; It is definitely more expensive, but I supplement her dry food with human food so I think I can stretch a bag of food.&nbsp;&nbsp;

I guess I should start cleaning.&nbsp; I'l give someone $5 if they do it for me.&nbsp;"

Rowdy went to the vet Tuesday because her tumor hadn't&nbsp;completely&nbsp;go away.&nbsp; He decided it&nbsp;was small enough to treat with meds again so&nbsp;surgery was not necessary.&nbsp; She is on the peeing meds for the&nbsp;next 3 weeks.&nbsp; At some points during the day she has to go every 20 minutes.&nbsp; I am glad she didn't need surgery.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Today I was driving home from work and I was sitting at the stop sign.&nbsp; All of a sudden my car died.&nbsp; There was no weird noise, nothing.&nbsp; It was like I turned it off.&nbsp; I desperately tried to get it to start and it wouldn't.&nbsp; I turned my hazards on after trying twice so the people behind me would know I had problems.&nbsp; I could see the old people in the car behind me throwing their arms in the air in anger that I was blocking traffic.&nbsp; They went around along with 6 other cars. Nobody stopped to see if I needed help.&nbsp; Finally my car started, but I have no idea why it died.&nbsp; I tried to check my oil tonight, but I have no clue.&nbsp; I tried to get the cap off to add more and I couldn't get the cap off.&nbsp; I hope that it doesn't happen again because I can't afford any car repairs right now.&nbsp;&nbsp;

This weekend I have to clean clean clean.&nbsp; Do you want to know why (other than the fact that it needs to be cleaned)?&nbsp; Because Eric is coming home for his 4 day pass!&nbsp; He told me that he was mentally prepared for Iraq so he didn't want to come home and he didn't want me going there so I thought I wouldn't see.&nbsp; He changed his mind though.&nbsp; The idea of sleeping in his own bed won.&nbsp; I am sure he can get back in the frame of mind.&nbsp; He's a good soldier.&nbsp; I am so excited though.&nbsp; I have never cried out of happiness until I read that IM from him.&nbsp; I started crying because I was so relieved to see him one more time before he goes.&nbsp; Plus it will be here.&nbsp; I don't have to drive, I won't have to kennel Rowdy.&nbsp; It will feel like before left.&nbsp; I am going to video tape the moment he walks in and Rowdy spots him.&nbsp; Ever since he left in January every time she seems him she jumps up and literally gives him a hug. Paws on shoulders and kisses all over his face.&nbsp; It is so cute.&nbsp; She is never that happy to see me.&nbsp;"

I hooked her up and left.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;am driving home&nbsp;and I am on&nbsp;my street when I see this&nbsp;dog dart across the street.&nbsp; A white dog that is similar to Rowdy's size.&nbsp; I get this sinking feeling knowing that she got out somehow.&nbsp; I park&nbsp;really fast and hop out of the car. My&nbsp;neighbor said she had been out all afternoon and they&nbsp;tried to get her, but she was too fast.&nbsp; She also didn't have her collar on which I thought was odd.&nbsp; The lady across the street was also out yelling for her to come back. She was&nbsp;behind some house when&nbsp;I was talking to the lady.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rowdy comes running right at me and just runs into me.&nbsp; I grab her as fast as I can and hold on.&nbsp; She usually will run at you and then turn away at the last minute so you will chase her.&nbsp; The lady told me that she had been trying to play with&nbsp;dogs who were out on walks, and she even&nbsp;went into her house.&nbsp; She had Rowdy&nbsp;in her house playing with her cats!&nbsp; She fed her and gave her water.&nbsp; I guess someone tried to put her&nbsp;back in the yard.&nbsp; I said she had a pen and did you put her in the pen.&nbsp; She said yes but she jumped the fence and got out.&nbsp; Her pen is six feet high and I know Rowdy can't jump that.&nbsp; I think they put her by my back door&nbsp;that is bordered by&nbsp;the yard fence and some chicken wire that was&nbsp;put up&nbsp;in case Rowdy bolted out the back door.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&nbsp;was not constructed to hold her for hours, only a minute or so.&nbsp; So she got out again.&nbsp; I thanked them for&nbsp;watching her and taking care of her.&nbsp; I felt horrible though.&nbsp; They commented on how she is a sweet dog and just was out wanting to&nbsp;play.&nbsp; That makes me feel worse because I am doing all I&nbsp;can, but I am only one person.&nbsp; I&nbsp;can only play with&nbsp;her&nbsp;for so long before I have to get stuff done.&nbsp; It made me feel crappy because she is horrible for me, but sweet for other people. &nbsp;"

I was going to drive back to Salina Thursday night and work yesterday, but then Eric told me there was a memorial service for his dad.&nbsp; I decided to skip work and go to the memorial.&nbsp; I kept getting so angry during the whole deal.&nbsp; People would stand up and talk about how great this guy was, how loyal he was to his family, and how much he loved his kids.&nbsp; If he was so damn loyal and loved his kids then why did leave them?&nbsp; He didn't contact his kids for the last 5 years even though he would be in KC every few months helping other family members.&nbsp; I wanted to stand up and say he sounds like an asshole.&nbsp; He had no clue Eric was even in Iraq.&nbsp; Or if someone told him, he never bothered to contact Eric.&nbsp; What would he have done if something had happened to Eric over there?&nbsp; I understand the guy was messed up with drugs and alcohol, but he left a daughter that had the same problem and leaving her increased her alcohol problem.&nbsp; I don't know...it just made me mad.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Speaking of Iraq, a unit close to Eric's is deploying and they don't have enough guys for a certain MOS.&nbsp; That just happens to be his MOS so they asked his unit for a list of soldiers with that MOS.&nbsp; So I guess right now there is a possibility he could be deploying soon.&nbsp; He has deployed before while others in his unit have not so I am hoping that will help him stay home.&nbsp;&nbsp;

There is a great dane that is&nbsp;a month younger than her but twice the body weight.&nbsp; She is by far one of the more energetic and mouthy dogs.&nbsp; She has to move, sniff, look in the mirror, and whatever else she can think of.&nbsp; The leaders seem to take it in stride since they always say, ""oh she's a pointer, it's okay.""&nbsp; To me it is kind of embarassing because I can't control her.&nbsp; She is doing better on the leash, mostly because she has a new collar.&nbsp; It is&nbsp;a prong collar.&nbsp; It doesn't choke her, but kind of pinches her neck so she behaves.&nbsp; We tried sit/stay tonight.&nbsp; She will sit, but she will not stay.&nbsp; All these other people have their dogs sitting perfectly still while mine is jumping up trying to bite my hand.&nbsp; Then we had to work on down and she wouldn't do it even though I know she does.&nbsp; She finally does it 5 minutes after the exercise is finished.&nbsp; Everyone thinks she is so cute and adorable so no one gets mad for me screwing up all the time.&nbsp; One of these days she'll get the hang of it.&nbsp; Of course tonight she fell asleep on the way to class which I know didn't help her behavior.&nbsp;&nbsp;

This is the part of my post where men drive me crazy.&nbsp; I get home from class to find all the lights on in my house and the back door wide open.

I bought some Halloween decorations today.&nbsp; The best part is they have muffin molds in different shapes.&nbsp; I bought ghosts and pumpkins.&nbsp; Yay!&nbsp; I am going to make some Halloween cookies AND muffins this year.&nbsp; Dude, I am tired.&nbsp; I think I could go to bed right now, but I will at least wait until the sun sets plus I have to watch Feasting on Asphalt at 8.&nbsp;"

"event","The one advanatage to waking up at 4:30 in the morning for work is I was able to see the lunar eclipse.&nbsp; It was pretty cool.&nbsp; Now it is off to lovely work for 8 hours where I get to cut people's nasty, bloody body parts.&nbsp;"

"event","I am currently watching Bridezillas.&nbsp; There is one woman on here who has been on for the past 3 episodes.&nbsp; Most women get 1-2.&nbsp; This girl is just a complete bitch.&nbsp; I would even call her a worthless human being...seriously.&nbsp; She is so self centered she doesn't realize how bad she is.&nbsp; She just got mad at a bridesmaid on her wedding day because the bridesmaid's daughter is in the ER with a high fever and is really sick.&nbsp; She didn't think she would be able to make the wedding since she wanted to be with her daughter.&nbsp; The bride is upset because this bridesmaid is providing transportation to the wedding.&nbsp; She actually had the nerve to say she didn't give a fuck about the woman's daughter.&nbsp; How horrible!&nbsp; I couldn't believe she would even say that.&nbsp; I really hope karma bites her in the ass one of these days.&nbsp; She is a complete whore.&nbsp; She's not even amusing like she thinks.&nbsp; I hope she watches this show and realizes just how awful she is.&nbsp;&nbsp;

This brings me to the craziness that I see going on in a few communities.&nbsp; I am in a few military communities since the army is going to be life now.&nbsp; I am amazed at some of these girls who are 15 or 16 years old and claim to be engaged to soldiers or marines.&nbsp; Hello, you are 15 years old!&nbsp; How can you know what love is at that age?&nbsp; I was trying to drive at that age I didn't care about love.&nbsp; If I had married the guy I thought I loved in high school I would have been divorced within a year.&nbsp; No joke.&nbsp; I don't know...maybe I am cynic or maybe I am not a romantic, but I want to shake these girls when I hear their stories.&nbsp; I guess it is not an easy concept to grasp that these 15 year olds are engaged.&nbsp; Have I become so old and bitter?"

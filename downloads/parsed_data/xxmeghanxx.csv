"event","So I never updated on how my therapist wanted to tell my parents that I smoke. Eventhough she isn't really allowed to do that, due to patient confidentiality laws... Anyway I was forced to go there today, after not seeing her for a month (Thank God). She decided she wasn't going to tell them... I'm thinking it's cuz I outsmarted her. Anyway I'm definitely not going back to her. She makes me feel more fucking depressed, and that like everything is hopeless.

This means the parents will be looking for someone else to send me to. Blah.

Tomorrow I think i'm going out with Emily and Krista... I have no idea what we are going to do. I just want to get outta this house.

Friday:
    Went over to Brittany with my sister around uh 7pm. We decided to go miniature golfing and go karting. Got to Mulligans around 9pm with Shawn, Brittany and my sister. Played miniature golf, and lost. Then we went to the batting cages so my sis and Brittany could hit for awhile. Even though they hit everyday at practice but whatever. Then Shawn and Christine went Go karting and I just chilled with Brit for awhile. Decided to go inside and get a soda and play air hockey. We left there and got home probably around 11pm. We decided we wanted to make a fire with the new pit thing they have in their backyard, so we did. Then we set up everything, and played dominoes and cards. Decided we wanted to drink.. And since there is always alcohol their, we just kept going back to their dads truck to get anything we wanted. I think I had four wine coolers and three beers. My sister who has never drank before decided she wanted to. She got pretty drunk off of nothing, and it was quite amusing. I couldn't stop laughing at her. She kept saying the most random shit. Anyway we went inside after awhile and I was tired so I went to sleep.

Saturday:
     Woke up and watched SWAT with Christine, Brit, and Shawn. Checked my cell and Kelli had called. She found me another hook up. haha yea, so I told her I would come pick her up around 4. Went and got her and came home and changed clothes and got ready. Chilled at my house for awhile and then called Bix. He said he had run out but was getting more around 7pm. We decided to go see Morgan while we waited. Went over and said hi to her, and talked for a bit. Then left, because her drunk friend was annoying me. I hate obnoxious drunk people. Anyway we left and headed towards Santa Monica to kill more time, and went to Coffee bean for ice blended mochas. Finally Bix's guy gave hime the stuff. So we went by his house and got that, and he hooked it up good. Decided to go get some dinner. Went to go get pizza, and sat around for awhile, looking at stupid people. Then I wanted to go to Venice beach, eventhough everything was closed. We went home and got some warmer clothes and went back to Morgan's to rescue her. Went to the beach and talked for awhile, but then it got too cold. So we dropped Morgan off and came home and watched comedy central. Smoked some, and chilled and watched movies and listening to music until I knocked out.

Today I havent done anything but chill. Im tired, and I don't want to go to school tomorrow. Blah."

Didn't go to school until second period because I thought we would be having another sub for first period, but noooo he decided to come today. So now i'll have to get a re-admit. I am soooclose to my 12 absent minumum per semester for senior year. Hmm.

And since Sarah stayed up all night working on her term paper for AP government, she is going to go home and sleep. Which means we didn't go do something. I don't really care though, because i'm tired and I didn't want to do anything today in the first place, so oh well.

The rest of the day was boring and I didn't really do much except read the short stories in third period.. And of course in fourth period we got her talking which always = no work. Yay for teachers getting off track.

And now im home and I want to go to sleep, but I should not, so I will try to stay awake. I have nothing interesting to say, I wish I could write about todays adventure but there wasn't one.

Oh my grandfather and his alzheimers. Ick. It's getting worse, he told us the same story today three times. He just kept circling and repeating himself. He looked at the newspaper like five times just to see what the date was. I don't think he remembers anything past like 2 minutes. It makes me feel uncomfortable...

So yea. I should go find something to do now, or see how my virtual stocks did for econ."

"event","Ok so I'm watching Real World San Diego, Cuz I have nothing better to do. Let's go over my day.

First period: The teacher is still done and he won't be there tomorrow either. She doesn't have anything for us to do, so we have just been sitting there. Now usually I would not be complaining that there is no work to do but it is boring as fuck. She doesn't even have the role sheet all we do is sign our names on the paper. I figure since tomorrow is late start anyway, I can sleep in until 9:30am and have Sarah sign me in. Sounds good to me.

2nd period: Nothing happened at all. Boring, and I wan't to leave that goddamn class before I step into it. Fuck Mrs. Wexler.

3rd period: We didn't do anything at all. Nothing, except go and write some stupid shit. Fuck that class too.

4th period: That class was funny. We placed bets on if Ms. Bisson's kid was going to be a boy or a girl. Then we talked about the most random shit. If you get her talking, we will never be doing any work.  

Sarah and I are going to go somewhere tomorrow after school, I'm just not sure where that's going to be.

After this show, I have to go to Barnes and Noble and pick out a short stories collection for my final project in english. Then I think im going to watch American Wedding so I can give it back to Kelli tomorrow. So yeaaaaaaaa"

First period teacher wasn't there so we had ragsdale for our sub. It went by incredibly slow because we had nothing to do. I don't even know why I bother going, because we never do anything. Talked to Sarah about her crazy winter break. I wish she would stop doing meth and coke. It's so bad for her...

Second period she piled on the work. Mananged to get some of it done, but I just sat and talked to Skye the whole time instead. Man he is hot. But he is like a man whore. Sad. I heard all about his crazy winter break. He should not drink so much, but oh well. Some how we ended up talking about showers and how he likes to take long showers or something. I dunno, I though guys got ready quickly in the morning.

Third period we got assigned our stupid final project. I have to find a short stories book so I can write an essay comparing three of the stories. What the fuck is that? Then we also have another two hour essay to write on the day of our finals. What is that crap. I'm obviously not looking forward to that. But anyway that class was a waste of time.

Ran into Kelli after 3rd period, and Im gonna borrow American Wedding from her tomorrow, so I can watch it.

4th period was spent in the computer lab working on our virtual stock exchange thing. We never do anything in that class. I talked to Neal and Krista about their winter breaks. Krista got drunk with Emily or something.

Came home around 1pm, and I was so tired so I just went to sleep... And woke up around 6pm with nothing to do. Had to drive my mom somewhere and now im sitting here watching Viva La Bam. That's a good show.

Anyway now I think I'll go take a shower and hope something fun and exciting happens in my life."

New years eve: 

   Decided to go hang out with Brittany, Niko and Shawn. Justin came home from college for winter break, so we got to hang out with him too. It was fun, I haven't seen him for months. Anyway we went to eat dinner at their grandparents house because it was her birthday and we had to make an appearance. It was cool though because we got to hang out with their cousins John and his friends. He was drunk off his ass though, it was funny shit. Watched some movies and shit, then decided it was time to leave. This was about 10:30. So we decide to go see Aaron at his house and play pool and domino's. Justin drove us over and we basically just chilled all night. I had some drinks, but didn't want to get drunk. Played a lot of pool and hung out. Finally we left around 5:30am, and went home. Then me Christine and Shawn watched X-men 2 and fell asleep.

New years day:

     Woke up around 12pm and was tired as fuck. Mostly just chilled and watched college football. Had some very funny conversations with Justin about all these random girls he has hooked up with and shit like that. I can't really remember anything else, except we went back and raided the grandparents refrigerator for food cuz there wasnt any at the house.

Friday:
    Didn't really do anything except watch movies and play PS2. Chilled with Justin, and had some funny conversations with Brittany. We all acted real goofy. Did a lot of nothing, but hey its better then school.

Saturday:
      Went minature golfing with Brittany and Christine. I lost, cuz I suck. Justin came to get us and took us to McDonalds cuz we were hungry. Then we went home and watched the Real world marathon all night cuz there wasnt anything else to do.

And then there was today. Woke up late said bye to Justin and all of them and had to come home. Because fucking school is tomorrow. Damn Damn Damn. I hate school."

Come on, who is that sheltered. Sarah went to Catholic school with them back in middle school. Nikki and Paris were cheerleaders. I didn't believe her but she showed me the yearbook. Every picture of Paris she has that ""oh the camera loves me look"" like she is so in love with herself. I bet she could sell those pictures for money or something. Anyway.

I was thinking of this movie I watched when I was way younger and I finally just found out what movie it was. It was Labryinth with David Bowie. It's such a freaky movie. 

"" You remind me of the babe""

I havent seen him in at least a year I think, since he didn't come down last year. That should be fun.. At least it's something to do.

Winter break is going by so fast though. Its already the second week and then I gotta go back on Jan 5th. Blah. I gotta remember to buy my class ring, yearbook, and order my cap and gown. Hmm. Better remember that.

Uh yea. I have nothing to say, because I am that incredibly boring.

Except Sarah is a total meth head now. I cannot stand seeing people being so fucking tweaked out. It's making her nutty. A funny drug Joke: What is the difference between a meth head and a crack head? They will both steal your wallet, but one will spend five hours helping you look for it. Heh though that was funny. Lets hope Sarah doesn't get to that. She was telling me how she was so spun, that she organized her spice rack at 3am. What the hell? Then she organized her book shelves but ended up with Stephen King next to Jane Austen.. And she thought they wouldn't get along,So she reorganized. This is why it isn't good to do speed people. That is not my idea of a fun time.

I hate my chemistry teacher, she is a bitch. She needs to die now. If she gives me anymore shit im gonna blow up in her face. She hates me, and is constantly taking points off my work for dumb shit. DAMNIT.

Last week I was flipping through the channels and stumbled upon Britney Spears... With I think Diane Sawyers or something. Britney could not be anymore fake. Talking about yes I was a virgin, but then lost it to Justin. Blah. She should just scream I WANT ATTENTION, LOOK AT MEEEEEEEEEEEEEE.

A friend gave me some Vicoden yesterday. Sadly over my lifetime I have taken so many that 4 would not do anything. Damn my opiate tolerance.

Moving on. Our principal is a hardcore bitch. She cancelled pep rallies... Because they are dangerous or something. She has ruined the school. She has certainly fucked over the senior class in every way possible

I complain too much. I think I will just end this now."

"event","Oh god, first day of school. This is how it went:

1. Intermediate algebra- Thank god Sarah is in this class because I don't know anyone else. The teacher seems ok, but it's going to be a hard class. I suck at math.

2.  Chemistry- With Wexler. I had her back in 9th grade and she was nice to me. She gets moody though and I know she is strict and mean. She acted overly nice and friendly it was sickening. I don't really know anyone in there, except it's full of druggies. Atleast im not the dumbest one?

3.  English, short stories- Everyone in the school is in that fucking class. The dumbass counselors over filled the class, and there were not enough seats for half the class. The teacher seemed ok, although I've heard bad things about her. An essay a week, but its in class so it cant be that bad. She is very sarcastic and negative. She said we wouldnt actually be writing any short stories because people are horrible writers and she would be bored out of her mind. Then she went off on  a tangent about that. ""Im already forty, and close to death, reading your short stories could kill me. Ever heard of crap fiction, its like pulp fiction, only people at our school are good at writing crap. Please dont show me a story about your boyfriend cheating on you.... blah blah blah.""
Dear god. I have Tamara in that class. She gave me a dirty look. She better not fuck with me or talk shit, cuz ill break her big old nose.

4. Economics- The teacher seems really nice. Darryl, West, Neal and all the fun stoners are in this class. It seems like it will be bareable.

And then I get out at 1pm on wednesdays, and 12:30 on every other day. It's only four classes but it's already depressing me. I don't know how im going to deal with school this year. I barely got myself through last year."

"event","Interesting.

Hmm. Bored. Took a shower, got ready... Now im sitting here.

I have to go to Dodger stadium later to watch the game because my sisters team is going to be recognized as national champions. Hopefully baseball isn't as boring as it is on tv? hmm. I should really stop complaining though... At least it's something to do. I can wear my comfy new Billabong sweatshirt. yay.

My dad is in the process of hooking up a new computer. The horror. If I don't update it's because he fucked up.lol. Hmm. At least I get to move this one to my room. But then I gotta get a wireless DSL thing or something. Everything has to be complicated.

I hate going clothes shopping with my sister. She is so fucking picky it's ridiculous. Like 3 hours and many trips back and forth, to get 2 pairs of jeans and 3 shirts. I'm definitely not going with her later.

Queer eye for the straight guy is the funniest show. I love watching it. They really do help some of those guys out.

Ok nothing else to say."

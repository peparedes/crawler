Only A simple sign of comfort.
Comfort leads to lust
lust leads to passion
Passion leads to love.

"event","I miss Eberly and Chelsea. and all my other friends as well. I just haven't had time for anyone. its such a shame because soon Chelsea leaves me behind...all alone...to deal with everything by myself. Well not completely, but it might as well be since shes been across the street since i was 5. I had a dream a couple a nights ago that she got hit by a car right in front of me walking across our street to my house. Wow, ive never been so scared in my life. It was one of those dreams that no matter how hard you tried to wake yourself up, it wasnt going to happen. Pretty much how a lot of kids feel in reality as well.

Vin is sick. ALl because of me and i feel so bad since he has a tournament this weekend. I want to be there and take care of him but because this week is hell all compressed into 7 days, its going to be rough. 

I need a break from all this ""young adult"" stress. I think it's bullshit and I shouldn't be complaining because it only gets harder. But the lack of freedom and being tied to a family is making it so much harder. 

This is why my future involves no one else. I made all my plans starting June 17, 2006 when i graduate all the way until i die. Every detail is planned, cept there are a few flaws...I left out all other people in the world. So basically I planned a life of me on a world all by myself. Yes i know, bad idea. imean right now it sounds good and it can only work with no other people in my life. but the more i think about it, the lonelier i get....So....back to the drawing board.


love
jlove"

"event","Don't make me out to be the criminal. 
Shine that off my face, its much too bright. 
My motives aren't yours to question.
My alabi doesn't fit in place.

I'll never learn from my mistakes.
So wake up, and press record.
Every night we dance along the shore
Kissing rough and wanting more.

If the dead talks and we listen
All the lovers left done and assured.
Those nights we drank til the sun rose
until we'd vomit up every last word.

So don't take my hand
and lead me around in circles.
Don't resist every urge of passion
even if you know you will lose
because in the end we all die
as our own recluse."

"event","So I take things too lightly. Big deal. So you tell me I need to grow up. Maybe you're right. But it's another year and I have a million more chances to do all that. New Years Eve was better than I thought it would be. I couldn't go out (asian mother remember?) so i stuck to a quick round of poker with the usual boys. An hour of joking eachother, pretending we're in Vegas, laughing, deciding if COOL ranch doritos ever existed, a 7-11 run which turned into an additional ice cream run into even better things and forgetting the rest of the world. Then it was a night at Nats. Young (mother) let me go since all my other friends went out, partied, chugged til the wee hours of the morning, and finished things off with some puking their insides out. What i call.....""extreme fun"". yes Hence the sarcasm. But it doesnt really matter because things went well, everyone had fun whereever they were, the ball dropped, and drama was started. First thing on the first day of 2005. But thats how you start the year off right. 
Schools here. Im not excited. you're dreading it, who isnt?

"event","So as we look back on the entire year,
       nervous and weary about what's to come near,
from cute relationships and ones gone bad   
       it looks like love was 2004's fad.
To girls who can't keep their mouths shut
       and the boys with the famous beer gut,
thank god we keep eachother sane
       even those with sex on the brain.
All those nights up late on the phone,
       too scared to admit we can't be alone.
With tears and laughter filling everyday,
       from all the gossip they have to say.
All the shit they talk and secrets they pass,
       no quick comeback here except ""kiss my ass.""
All those surgeries, you've become a sure fiend
       for any high from vicotin and morphine.
This is what 2004 is all about
       making any girl or boy want to shout
""Thank god that shit is over,
       I can't handle this sober.""
So let's all make a toast
       a resolution of the east coast,
No more crap or gossiping on others' lives,
       or I'll kick your ass asian style in 2005.






****** i love you guys, Happy new year. lets make this count********

"event","So the whole world is staring at me. And i have this image that keeps flashing in my mind but i have no clue what it is. I wonder if thats why theyre staring at me. Maybe they can see it, its flashing above me in bright, Vegas, showgirl lights with an arrow pointing down at me illuminating that ""i am the fool."" I keep doing that whole continiuous, seizure blinking thing hoping the more i blink, the faster things will disappear. I walk by everyone like usual shouting my usual 'hey love' and nodding, waiting for a cute ""hey jen"" or any other predicted response. I wait a little longer, still nothing. Well theres something, but it isnt the usual. the predictable. the expected. Instead, its a quick look down, staring at their shoes, PRAYING i wont make any more eye contact. Or else its the suspicious, ""what the hells your problem"" glare. yes, glare. Id have to say its the worst ever. But this is me, Jennifer toi valentine. one who tries so hard to make a situation lighter, so without thinking, i blow them a quick kiss hoping theyll laugh at me pathetically. nope, i dont even get the pathetic laugh...i get the ""walk away"". I wonder why im so paranoid today.

I cant really remember anything that happened the past 4 or 5 days. I know what happened, but i dont remember how i felt about it or how i feel about it now. i dont really care to be honest. I want to move away. Maybe LA or Vegas or NYC...wherever young teenage girls run away and sell their bodies to keep themselves off the streets. No, not really. i just want to be somewhere where no one knows your name. But youre that person they constantly shoot looks at questioning you and who you are, but they would never dare to come up and ask and learn about you. No, thats too risky. I like risky. I like new. I like no one knowing me and being a question to them. So theyll shoot glances, whisper among one another deciding what they think. But who cares what they think. Thats not the fun part, especially if they approve. Its the game that i live for. the part when they whisper, the part when they watch me for mistakes. The part where i just pretend im ignoring it, but am secretly addicted to it. Yeah, secret addictions make everything more fun. 

I have friends that are secret addictions. but its not a secret anymore, which is so disappointing because its more thrilling when no one knows. The type of human being that they dont just walk down the street, they parade... showing off every heavenly feature and god-like characteristic in their perfect, greek-statuesque figure. Everyone either gawks or stands in disgust. Everyone has a different reaction, but thats not the point. The point is everyone HAS a reaction. My favorite and most popular is ""ugh, who do they think they are? it disgusts me how perfect they are""
yeah well i think its fucking hilarious. it disgusts me how jealous you are. You know you'd kill for that person or else kill to be that person. Thats right, its time to question your morals when you have blood all over your hands after commiting the perfect murder.

Everything seems to amuse me now-a-days. Not sure why, I just know i cant stop laughing at the dumbest things. Its more of a giggle though, the annoying kind that you'd just want to hold the person head under water for atleast 4 minutes until you can feel their chest inflate filling with deadly waters. i giggle at everything, not trying to be cute, but because im trying to hold in one of those loud, obnoxious ones. I love life when everythings funny. because everything smells so much sweeter.

I dont really like christmas. Actually the only part i like is the snow and the break. I hate decorating, its such a hassle (except for my hannukah bush...but thats because its my baby). I hate the smell of christmas, i hate eggnog, im just your modern day Grinch...asian style. I hate the holiday because its so publisized. Media has eaten it alive. I dont like the people that celebrate it and know nothing about it. They just play into the typical Christmas shopper lacking any knowlege on the religion at all. Its not a religious holiday anymore, that was just a legitimate excuse to get a few days off work and drink til your blue in the face. Wow, sounds like every relgiious holiday.

im not ready for anything. itjust cant happen. its less what people think and more whats happening to me. ive dealt with alot (well id say so) and everyone knows what ive been in and stuff, but i wish theyd understand how its not easy to just rush into something again. i wish i would have understood that earlier. then i wouldnt be here now. im the one to blame as well, for thinking i could handle more on my plate than usual. i pushed my self to handle it and in the end i fell apart. stupid stupid girl.

why am i explaining myself? no one ever should have to explain themselves....unless u kill someone, like how we killed the seniors last night. but i wont explain. its too brilliant to explain.

""Perfect people never fall"" and thats when it happened. the mockery slapped me in the face. You turn your back and run away, your only wartime strategy. I've gotten so used to the avoidance that i just smile because it reminds me of you. Put on your seatbelt, its going to be a bumpy ride. Stop laughing at me thinking I'm a joke. Maybe im demanding because im sick of not getting what i want. Maybe im controlling because Im tired of slamming my head into the windshield. My ears are ringing and my head is splitting. Your voice is killing. And then we drop like flies.

Your pants are down and you look so lost. Its hot in here and im ready for anything, anything. We flinch at every quick gesture, at every implied movement. We both know whats happening, we both know its inevitable. and Im ready for anything, anything. I'm staring down the barrel and the safetys no longer on. We both know whats happening but we cant admit it. Thank god they don't have an opinion. your heat pressing against me is putting me in flames.

""we have to because todays our last day."" youll never stop, ""We have to because well be gone tomorrow"". Thank god I don't have an opinion. Your hand won't let go of me, it has a mind of its own now. Your eyes wont let go of me, they have a mind of their own now. your mouth wont let go of me and youre biting too deep. Thank god for guns.

Its quite pathetic when you resort to talking to something that doesnt listen or talk back.

So chelsea is 18 today. a nice bday shoutout to her, lucky dog. she got 5 lotto tickets and played those. Yeah stupid 1 out of 3.72 odds. Hers one, mine lost horribly. Thats not even the bad part. the bad part is im addicted now. a gambling fool. Itll never end. Ill end up going to rehab for it and itll headline all the newspapers... ""Out-of-control teen looses millions to Luck and Rehab"". Saweet. So in order to fulfill my lotto cravings...we went and got a 5 dolla ticket...yeah big money there. more like a big WASTE of money. Since shes 18 she could have bought her first legal porn with that five bucks. silly girl.

I saw the Grudge on wednesday. I dont recommend it. When people say ""dont waste your money,"" theyre usually not lying to you. the plot sucked. it wasnt THAT scary, i mean i jumped but thats cuz i was with a sexy mexican that would pretend he was a PART of the movie. odd kid. it wasnt that scary but if youre asian, be careful because it fell a LITTLE too close to home for me.

atleast im keeping myself busy...enough to not stress out about everything. I gotta get into UCLA. i just decided.


OO i came up with the best idea for a movie. its going to be good.

<h2 align=""center""><font face=""Verdana""><b>You are The Empress</b></font></h2>
<P align=""center""><font face=""Verdana"">Beauty, happiness, pleasure, success, luxury, dissipation.</font></P>



How true this can be: I am really a creator for things since young, mostly happy, though i can't speak of beauty and luxury..... hahhahah ain't that luxuriously associated nor beautifully dissipated lah.... ;P




<p align=""center""><font face=""Verdana"">The Empress is associated with Venus, the feminine planet, so it represents, 
beauty, charm, pleasure, luxury, and delight. You&nbsp;may&nbsp;be&nbsp;good&nbsp;at&nbsp;home 
decorating, art or anything to do with making things beautiful.</font></p>


<p align=""center""><font face=""Verdana"">The Empress is a creator, be it creation of life, of romance, of art or business. While the Magician is the primal spark, the idea made real, and the High Priestess is the one who gives the idea a form, the Empress is the womb where it gestates and grows till it is ready to be born. This is why her symbol is Venus, goddess of beautiful things as well as love. Even so, the Empress is more Demeter, goddess of abundance, then sensual Venus. She is the giver of Earthly gifts, yet at the same time, she can, in anger withhold, as Demeter did when her daughter, Persephone, was kidnapped. In fury and grief, she kept the Earth barren till her child was returned to her.</font></p>

"event","Hahhahaha... I had such a great time today in class - not listening to the speaker but playing and chiding with the ""tai-Tai-to-be"" in class.....  everyone calls her tai-tai as she is so young pretty and gorgious and who is marrying a man 8 years her senoir who is an indonesian businessman and currently doing up her house in Sentosa....  really love going shopping at Blum with her and the gang of gals in class.... of coz as usual they trust my fashion sense.... Blum really must pay me commission as I brought them so much business......  

It's so funny how Tai-tai actually ended up talking about our sideline if we don't make it in citi....  hahhahaha  set up a gigolo service..... hahahah  Apparently, I am suppose to be in her eyes a prime prospect for best performance in the tai tai arena.... which I do subtlely do agree with her opinions to a certain extent from my consumer banking experience... I do have some charm towards the ladies in question.....  hhahahahah  But apprently when I try to shift the focus on the other men in the class.....  she apprently said I will be the one who will be most popular with the tai tais... and that she does know of someone who has done it b4 in HSBC..... apparently been given a house and a car......  wow!!!!  I know it will definately not happen to me lah... thought such things only happens in the movies... but apparently coming form someone in the circle who had seen such happenings..... ahem.... i sorta believe her..... wouldn't it be kinda fun if some tai tai really will give me a lucrative offer....of which most probably i will reject... but can't say say more if it's the tai tai's hubby loh.... hahahahahahhahahha ;P


Well, so joking and playing along was fun loh ... it was so funny.... to even fantasies on expanding the business regionally and to cater to all market segment..... hahahahah  ie.. the aj sector....  ahem....  which I know I wouldn't have any hope in..... hehehehehhehhe guess the tai tai sector wil be better for me......  it was so funny really... she even says the taiwanese will love me..... plus the hong kongers.....  hahahhaha  wonder of there is really any truth in the priority banking business in citi....  will be really fun if I really get an offer... hahahahhaahah


Really wouldn't take up the offer lah... even she offer me a few millions loh.......  but then again tai tai really don't think so loh.. she is so adament that I will succumb to the temptation......  how devilish of them to instill such thoughts in me...... heheheheheheh  ok if the offer comes with a Lamborgini plus a house at Sentosa cove under my personal name fuly paid.......  I might just think about it......   hehhahahahahahah  ;P


Hope everyday will be as fun as this..... ;)


Seriously!!!! I really do have a KEPT BOY LOOK meh???? This is so misjustified... whatever I have I bought for myself with my hard earned money ok???  I don't depend on my parents for anything I buy for myself.......   hmmm.....  OK lah what to do? I have the easy to bluff, pampered look loh...... so sad...... plus my siao bai lian look lah......   resoundingly popular among tai-tais.......  siao liao!!!!!! I am here to earn com leh not to go into sideline underneath the table leh......  ;P"

I really feel a bit safe... but I also feel a bit lost......  this is not a dept I wanted to be in..... besides, then why now you send inuovi to come knocking on my door for a job offer as an operations branch manager now?????  Why did you also send another head hunting firm to offer me another structured products sales job to private banks????  what do u really want me to choose????  Are they mere temptatiosn from the devil or what???

"event","Every year at this appointed time of the year... I would be there sitting waiting for you...... wondering if u would remmeber what I told u before... and literally sipping my coffee away while I wonder around to catch a glimpse of u....... yes I will keep doing this for the many years to come..... I will still be here on this very date every year..... as I keep all my promises to u.. never breaking anyone of them.... and not especially this very simple one which I promised to do and could do with very little effort...

Being here alone, lightens my load every year,....... very soon I wll spend less ime waiting for u..... even before long... I might also bring someone along with me ......  I would also not know how u would react to the new guy at the table... i suppose, u won't have much feelings...... yet I know every other year as I pen my feelings over for u.... it will be amounting to a greater load of disappointment........ yet I know every year... these disapointments will render me less pain...... to a point where... it will never matter to me anymore...... yet I will still keep coming........


U never will know I am doing all these for u.. neither would u be bothered..... just as u would not even lift a finger to msn me or yahoo me even when u see me on line...... i suppose I know how much I am to u.......

It can't be yr way of preventing more hurt in me.... it also can't be your loving heart at work anymore.... i know after 6 years together and another 3.5 yrs apart, it all meant nothing to u...... plus those misunderstandings and misconceptions u had of me till now......  u were not even inviting the thought of having me back as a fren.....


I chose not to explain anymore... I chose not to be bothered anymore..... I chose not to mention it anymore...... I chose not to thread the pathe of love anymore.... yet everytime I choose to lighten up my way..... I just still kept giving u excuses...... 


Somehow in my deepest heart.......  I am still just waiting for that fateful day that u would just walk right up to me and to chat up with me about life's past and present in total honesty... but somehow I know the day would never come..... your guilt and pride will not lead u to me.......  yr wilfullness and disappointment at yrself would also prevent u from coming to me.........  I donot know what will lead u to me... so the only thing I could at least do for u is to appear at this same cafe..... same table..... at the same time........  same tenure.... same pair of jeans and shirt.......    to hopefully catch u walking past and still be shocked to see the same old wee kim.... who is still waiting for u all these while without fail....... with every sigle promise made right.......  if it swells a tear in my eyes now.... I hope when u see me, a tear of appreciation could also be shared for my last efforts in remembering my simple promises to u.........."

"event","When tears flows as memories flood our senses, It is always easy to indulge in the most beautiful images of life that brings more pain.

It really cuts as a knife lietrally as the love stories will tell u.... but to me such pain tears my soul far more strongly as a knife slits through my throat.......  when a knife slits our throat, we wil mix air with blood, suffocates and gushes for air to live and in less than 10 mins die a horrified death,.......  but when  love tears my soul, it tortures my brain, suffocates my heart, and bears eternal existence within my revolving memories......  


I cant stop it, I can't get rid of it... so I had to find a way to numb myself, numb my skin, stop my heart.....  stab myself.....  

How funny... only the ones who trully loved before would understand.. only the ones who passed by this path would know the way to the exit... only the ones who knew how hard it is to go through this journey would appreciate life in a greater perspective.....

I thank God for this..... I love God more for this hurt......  I rest within his warmth as I punish myself through sleepless nights hang over by tearful eyes........  


I believe such pain and hedious memories will flood my brain waves at specific points in life as we move forward... but I know as each day passes, my life picks up greater momentum and my feelings for u will fade with the days as with those promises I kept even up till now......  they will still be fullfilled but I know the outcome would never be what I envisioned...... 


If u went thru a hard time, when u couldn't sleep, just rmemeber, after every shower, there will be sunshine... so after the last drop of tear u shed, u must bring back the smile.......  it is always more worthy for those who love u to be smiled at then to place yr smiles and hopes on someone who never trully loved u till the end of time........  


remember my words, oh sleepless one.......  if fate brings u here to chance upon this... i suppose, it must be God's way of telling u how much he loves u too........  so remember to smile!!!!

Each of us carries in our DNA the<br>ability to be the opposite of what we think we<br>are. Often our romantic attachments grow out of<br>awe and respect as we see in another the<br>characteristics we repress in ourselves.<br>Society often presses us into molds of what it<br>thinks masculinity and femininity should be. As<br>a result, many of us associate with our gender<br>certain positive characteristics and call<br>others negative, when if these same qualities<br>were held by a person of the opposite sex, our<br>attitude towards them would be reversed.<br>Getting in touch with our inner animus and<br>anima, (Jung's terms for our inner male and<br>female), allows us to see the whole of our<br>personalities in a positive and constructive<br>light. When you draw The Lovers card in a<br>reading, you are working with balancing these<br>forces. Depending on where the card is, you<br>have either achieved balance or need to. The<br>Lovers could indicate a romantic or even a<br>platonic relationship. Ask yourself is this is<br>a positive relationship that contributes to<br>your growth as a complete human being, or if it<br>fills an emotional craving within you that is<br>actually detrimental to your personal growth.<br>Image from: The Iranian artist Riza.<br>http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/view1.asp?dep=14&item=50%2E164

Your friends see you as painstaking and fussy. 

They see you as very cautious, extremely careful, a slow and steady plodder.

It'd really surprise them if you ever did something impulsively or on the spur of the moment.

They expect you to examine everything carefully from every angle and then usually decide against it.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/howdopeopleseeyouquiz/"">How Do People See You?</a></div>"

At your darkest moments, you feel frustrated.
At work and school, you do best when you're organizing.
When you love someone, you tend to worry about them.

In friendship, you are emotional and sympathetic.
Your ideal careers are: radio announcer, finance, teaching, ministry, and management.
You will leave your mark on the world with organizational leadership, maybe as the author of self-help books.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/birthorderpredictorquiz/"">The Birth Order Predictor</a></div>"

Spent $1799 i think it's a steal as compared to the nicer looking acer which has lots of bad press even though the price ws higher.....  nearly just went for the loks of it... ok I finally listened to everyone else's suggestion and bought the compaq in the end... though i still think the grey keyboard still looks super uncool as compared to the acer's cool black key board.... ok lah it's cheaper by $200 bucks and I got better specs than Acer..so I better stop complaining....

So cool it's working sooooo fast...i love it.... finally I can be fast and cool again.... ;)  with my lap top works i mean.... ;P


The Ritz Carlton buffet was qite a let down today.... standard never go up but drop leh.... ;P Maybe it's the company I went with.... kinda boring.... trying so hard to entertain all those at my table with all those boring stories of mine... but then again they were really entertained.... and laughing all the way... the girls were all sooo happy or should I say, my table was the only one with the most laugther........ if i got a choice not to go for this makan with the top acievement bankers in the bank I would have just gone home... but too bad, the big boss is there... so i gotta be politically correct and ive my usual star appearance.. ;)  ok lah... for the free makan and brief entertainment and to get to know afew more top bankers in the bank... hopefully would be good for me in the future...... ;P  as if I bother... ;P  hahahahah


Before that went to buy the lap top....just pop into one of those shop and walla God sent this cha and gave me a swopping discount.. it was suppose to be 1999 instead he said he wil offerme at 1799... so good so i made a decision on the spot at Funan... no questins asked....;)


Hope this lap top will not die on me again soon.... ;)



LEO sms to say that we will go for movie and chocolate lava cake this Sunday after church....  well... really don;t know what to do with this chap....  I also don't know if it would work out.... but all I know is that he totally reminds me of him...... exactly..... which is causing me great fear.....  even his voice sounds the same, the sporty outlook, even the height and size......  it's just so similiar.. even his educational background and all.....  hmmm..... just let it be lah.... see how it goes... but one thing for sure, he wasn't as fervent as Jason was previoulsy when he knew me.... so I won't be that touched then..... too bad.....  ;)

think he just might not be the one afterall...... just maybe another passerby then i suppose......"

So confused by my own feelings..... don't know whether it was just symphathy, love or just plain caring....  diff to pin point my true feelings.... somehow, everything is clearer now as I try my very best to learn from what God wants me to learn from here.... ;)


1) I need to forgive myself and remove myself from self blaim 
2) Learn to love and give love to everyone
3) Give trust
4) Open up myself to new friends
5) Be happy
6) Give thanks always


What I learnt and has been reinforced again by my Sis, Peace and Chee meng:
1) A man who leaves u never loved u
2) Be yrself, go for yr dreams - if he loves you, he will love and support yr dreams
3) Be happy for yrself and live happier than the one who leaves u
4) Let God melt my heart
5) Plan your dreams
6) Ask got for clarity and direction



I will try my best to learn to leave with this fear of pain that I experienced 2.8 yrs ago.... the tears and pain in the heart every morning when I wake up and before I sleep..... I fear this pain so much I hate it.....  guess u r trying teach me to get over this fear and to slowly accept it's reality...

With this boi's leaving, I will finally sense a loss of a fren... someone whom has been with me every single day for the last 2 months..... I hope i won't cry over it.......  just feel a bit lost and a vacuum maybe... but life will definately go on....

I need to get used to this loss feeling and pain in order to finally get over this fear... that's why Chee Meng said....


I will live life better than it was previously I hope.... everything will be fine.... I need only God's presense... finally learnt that men don't satisfy... only God does... men will never be with me for good.. only God will......  I hope to find that Godly man who loves me and whomI would love till eternity soon..... wonder if such a man trully exist.... I am still waiting and am trying to be hopeful...

well, everyone told me to pray and I did... ok i see somethings happening but still not the right ones soooo far..... am not picky but there just aint chemistry I suppose.....


Hope God will really bring that right one along... ;)


Really need to plan my Goals for this Life soon.....  have been dwelling on it for too long and not doing anything about it... it's high time I do something about it soon... I dont want to be  hopeless pauper at the end of my life....


Guide me lord..... be with me..."

"event","Well, woke up quite late at near 11 plus and went to pick up Mark for lunch... well... Did I even mentioned that yesterday after while in the car to lunch, he actually gave me a jazz CD that he cut in the morning before he went for gym. Well, quite surprised when I asked him to join us for lunch yesterday he said ok.... well, everyon ethinks I striked a cord with him.... but frankly, with my usual suspicions and all, I suppose I had value to him... as I am able to intro him a job in my bank....  ;) as he was gonna come back this November.... well, so at least I was highlighted something, I still do have value if I only flaunt it....  ;P hahahahah  that's what Johnson told me and highlighted to me......  but then of course johnson also was shocked to know that Mark actually would spend so much time talking and even invited himself for lunch and all with me,..... hahahhaha beats me too...



Well, guess My listening power and my attentiveness still hasn't deteriorated......  I still could get people to talk to me if I really wanted to.... ;) hahahahah 


Well, yesterday he actually sms Johnson to ask about the lunch with me today... to fix the place and stuff.....  at least he is quite sincere in eating with me,.... ;)

Then again , at lunch today, I didn't really talk much with him....he just kept on babbling..... well, egoistic people are thus lah.... i guess... they don't listen much and all....  well, but at least this guy is not so bad... he didn't leave me with a bad impression though..... ;)  quite frendly of him....  for giving me the CD and all....  wonder if I really could keep him as a fren..... I didn't ask for his email though..... but he got my name card... guess he will definately email me with regards to the job thingie..... ;)



Yesterday night while waiting for Johnson to pick me up from town, I took pictures at the studio again.... hahaha.....  so last minute but quite fun lah... Hair not combed nor gelled... so unkept but it's real natural looking... just wanted to wear the winter clothes and take a pic for memory.....  turned out quite ok.....  ;)  so cheap also... only aus$29 bucks... ;)

"event","It is super cold this morning....  now I wonder why some people hate the cold weather even when its not that cold.

Well, I love the cool breeze... kinda feels good on my skin. Fingers really cold and my ears are also freezing. Shopping here is quite good but all the sizes are too big. Besides, its so cold I don't feel like peeling my clothes off to try them.... Good for me too!!! Save lots of money. Think all the money will be spent on food.

Everything is big... ;) Love the juicy fruits... even vege seems to be so much more crunchy and juicy... ;) love it!

The night was sweet.... I am still thankful to Ck who drove me to the airport.... though he doesn't have to.. yet he offered even without me asking.... I am very very very touched.... thank God you are attached... if not I would have eaten you up alife! hahahahahahah  if you are reading this, don't worry, I am more ethical than whatever you think I might not be... ;)


Well, time flies.... its been a day and nearly over. It's a good feelign to be alone standing in front of the calm waters at the harbour... eating my strawberry and banana crepe while the breeze washes my face... ;)

Life's not too bad for me.... till now it's been 9 men from Oxford st to town that has smiled and looked back at me while I striked it out on my own into the streets......  kinda fun... love the attention... seldom get such attention back home I suppose.....  ;)  All thanks to my happy face and light footsteps maybe....  plus all my thick out fit... ;) however, only one was 2 was real cute to me at least.....  Guess Sat at the clubs will be better... ;)


Oh yes!!!! thanks you dear for calling me in the morning.....  CK lah!!!!  Love hearing a familiarvoice from afar... at least I didn't feel that lonely after that.... ;)

Am trying to book the tickets to Melbourne now as I type.... 

Ok gotta try go church later on sunday... must be an alernative church... heheheh"

OK i went down and made a fuss and I got to get it changed,,,, seriously, when customer don;t get worked up, the people really would want to take advantage.. thank GOD i learnt to be more demanding now.....  so i got a new set changed... hope it works,.....


Worst, the other guy erased 3/4 of my numbers......  now I am lost..... i lost so many people's numbers... anyway not like I need all their numbers too anyway......  but then again.. i am quite surprised, I wasn't even  very angry over his terrible sily mistae plus the fact that he tried to shift the blaim to me somemore.... what customer service.. if not for him being the helper after being arrowed by the 1st idiot, I would have gien hima big smashing.....  thank GOD i am a good wise and fair consumer.....  was still very polite with him... ;)


Then again if u call me and I still donno who u r or sms me.... pls understand hor,... yr number might be the ones he erased off...;(

Beautiful and smart, you are still just beginning<br>to fulfill your potential.  You have a strong<br>sense of right and wrong, but are open to<br>discussion and changes of opinion.<br>Unfortunately, when it comes to love you are<br>often torn between two options, and can never<br>seem to make up your mind.

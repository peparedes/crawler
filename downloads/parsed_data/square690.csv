"event","<font color=""#ffff00""><font size=""1"">tonic water may very well be the most disgusting beverage that ever happened upon the world</font>.&nbsp;<br /></font><br /><br /><br /><font size=""5""><strong><font size=""6"">YUCK YUCK YUCK YUCK<br /><br /><font size=""1""><font color=""#c0c0c0"">motivation would be awesome. n the fact that my stomachs turning does not make me motivated, o no sir it does not.&nbsp; im feeling some strong hatred for the lemon floating in my drink right now.... who does he think he is... he isnt making the tonic water taste any better; it STILL tastes like robitussin amd most likely would with or without the lemon.&nbsp; so if anyone was wondering if there was a difference between seltzer water and tonic water heres the answer: <font size=""4"">YES. THERE MOST CERTAINLY IS. </font></font><font color=""#c0c0c0"" size=""1"">and iwill tell you why.... selzter water is carbonated water, which, yea, still tastes like trash BUT! tonic water is carbonated water pumped fulla quinine and THAT my friends is what makes it taste like u got hairspray in ur mouth.<br /></font></font><br /><font size=""1"">a word from the wise: if u get cramps in ur legs, bananas work only to a certain extent, so drinking this garbage juice is supposed to help--ive yet to see the results seeing as how i just started this tonic water diet today, but if it works ill let you know. (but to tell u the truth id rather never move again in my life to avoid a cramp than drink this.)</font><br /></font><br /><br /></strong></font>"

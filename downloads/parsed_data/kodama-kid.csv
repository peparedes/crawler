"event","well, i havn't written in months.  Most likely because i don't really care, and i'm writing write now because it is late, i have alot of work to do, and i don't want to do it.
	I have been completely slacking off the last few weeks, and i'm not sure why.
i'm bored with school, but i always am, i got halo2, but i don' think thats it.  I havn't even been workin' on the website,which is weird because i used to work on it like all day. well time to sleep, work on my science project, reading project, and read a book.  sleep first, then turn them in and then work on them has seemed to be my schedule lately.  maybe i'm just bored with my life. i've sorta just stopped caring

I don't think of the future, it comes soon enough  -einstien


(i agree)"

"event","finally finshed my website, www.kodamastudios.com   it is really cool, but it need alot of work. 
	at school i also got assigned a video project that is really cool.  it's on a book called the pigman, and the video is like a big summary. one of the characters is a girl, and im in an all guy group. soooo we made a cartoon girl. the kissing seen is hilariouse(however that is spelled).  it will probably be on the website under ""cartoons"" so be sure to check it out
	so not much is going on now except for the movie, but ive got a bunch of cartoons in my head. i sorta abandoned the stick action cartoon cuz it was takin to long and i wanted a fully animated cartoon."

"event","yea... well you know that whole ""im gonna write sooner than every 2 months""  thing, well i kinda lied, it was more like 3. well ive started a website(kodamapage.com) and the cartoon im makin is goin ever so slowly. Other than the website nothin has really happened.
	I did go to a lan party (halo) and owned at slayer, and did ok at ctf. When we played with only shotguns and no sheilds i did absolutely horrible. It was pretty fun all in all. BUt Brandon's brother, the host of the lan, was the biggest loser i have ever seen, and i say this not caring if he reads it.
	yea well whatever. Ill write another later"

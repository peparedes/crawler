"event","""fucking bitch"" and ""selfish, ungrateful child"" are the names that stick out in my mind tonight. Suprisingly, I'm calm. I don't care anymore what she calls me. She's called me these names before, yet their sting is no more than a tiny prick to me. None of it matters. I simply appologise and put on a sweet face for a few days until I do something else that pisses her off. You know, truthfully, I think I'm getting better at this. Maybe it's just that I got a lot of sun today, or maybe it's the fact that none of this is new, but I have a feeling that this summer will be different. I can take it now, sort of. I can take it better than I used to be able to. My mother can call me whatever the hell she wants to, but it won't hurt anymore.
When I was little, actually, that's wrong. Up until this past December, I used to be so afraid of losing my mothers approval over my life. It's not like that anymore. I don't care. My life will be the way I want it to be, she can't govern over me like I'm something else. There are times when I hate her, and then there are those times when I just want to hug her and tell her I'm still her ""Little Angel"" like I used to; but no matter what, she won't ever control the road my life is meant to take. It's nice when you can come to this kind of realisation, now if only I could actually follow through with it.
No matter what I say, no matter how strongly I feel like this, one of these days I know she'll eat away at it until she breaks me. It won't take long either. She knows how easily she can guilt me. I could never be a spy."

This little chicky might actually make something of herself! Who knows, someday you may look at a magazine and find my face one the cover....thats a scary thought. Meh, the futures fun to look at.
Meh, I'm tired and probably shouldn't have done half the things I did today. There's no energy left in me now:( So much for staying up late. Oh well, night my dears. Love ya'll lots

"event","HONESTLY! I fucking dont matter to her! All I've ever done was shown her that I'm the best freaking kid she will ever have, yet its not good enough. I guess you have to be a slut or a big time bitch to be on her good side. All she's ever done was told me to get the hell out of this town and make something of myself. When I tell her I may want to go to Toronto for my under-graduate schooling, she tells me it would be better if I chose Kamloops instead! SHE HATES KAMLOOPS! What the hell goes on in her mind? She's twisted. She judges everyone of my friends, everyone she meets. She has not heart at all! I don't know why I missed her, I don't know why I wanted to come back. Carlea, I need you! I don't know what to do anymore, she's a bitch and I hate her. My dads never home anymore, too many meetings and golf championships. She told me I wasn't allowed on the phone today because Lindsay needed to call her, but the thing is, she's been on the phone to the ""Slut"" for half an hour. What the fuck?! What did I ever do that was wrong? NOTHING! Thats the thing, I don't drink, I don't do drugs, I've never smoked, I'm still a damn virgin! Lord knows Ashley sure wasn't when she was my age! I want this to end, I want to get out! I'm sick of her, she always bitches at me whenever she thinks I'm having a good time. Before concerts, all the way through my summers, and I never get recognition for the things I do well. I could win a Nobel Prize and she wouldn't care. But no, if Lindsay does something well, then she gets praise for the rest of the whole damne week! I absolutely can't stand my mom! I want out of this god damn house! I wish I was back there, she and I atleast got along..."

The only problem, is that my stupid ways have made you change, and my stupid mind makes me feel like I'm losing you. My best friend and I think you're slipping away. Things are better, I'll admit that. We're closer than ever and I couldn't be happier, that is, if I didn't have that hidden thought. Maybe it's nothing, maybe its just me over anylyzing things once again. Who knows? Who cares? Just let me spend a minute with you, a minute alone. Let me forget this feeling and never let it return.

"event","It's fun you know, being back. There's just one problem, its all the same.
I saw Dean and Amanda last night. Deans the same old person hes always been, but it was awesome to see Amanda. She has to be one of the sweetest people I know, even when she's drunk. But she talked to me a little bit about being home and such, its actually nice to know that someone cares. A lot of people that I've seen in these past few days don't really seem like they truly want to hear about my trip, its just not interesting. Things stayed the same here and my trip is the biggest thing on my mind, I can't help it if a stupid memory comes out. Hell, when I don't know something I'm still pulling at ""Alien"" as my math class would call it. Life just doesn't seem the same back here...meh, it'll return.
Went to look for a job yesterday, viel Spass. Actually it was. Was too many people thought I'm heading into my second year in college and such, and a lot of the guys I talked to practically interviewed me before even really checking out my resume. I was pleased. Still have to get my L though, and scared shitless too. I'll do it though, I'll repeat it as many times as it takes to get it...I guess I should actually go in first and write the test once. Then I'll know the answer. 
Anywho, I should probably get going. My cousins are coming into town today and I need to scrounge up an escape. I refuse to entertain them......maybe I'll just throw them in the pool.

"event","I've gone and done it. I've finally proven to myself that I'm her. I've spent all my life trying not to be her but its just goes to show you that no matter what, I am bound to disappoint. Mind you, my Dad doesn't know, and he never will (pray tell mom doesnt open her big mouth). I've always tried to be better, never screwing up, never allowing myself to turn into the fucked up slut she became. Yes, ok, that's a little harsh on her part but Lord knows I've right. I just don't want to disappoint them. That's why I'm gonna get a stupid job, that's why I'm going to pass that test, that's fucking why I try so damn hard. My parents approval means everything to me, everything down to even the way I dress. I'm just so scared of failing.
If anyone asked me what my biggest flaw is, I would have to tell them that it's my will to please. That's probably why Chris called me ""The Family Rose"" at Auntie Patti's funeral last year. He told me that my will to please is so strong, that the family just wants to put me on display. That's the problem right there though, the expectations are too high and I've afraid to fall. Hell, I'm afraid of a stupid drivers test. I know I'm going to fail, because that's just what's going to happen. It will take me atleast two tries to pass it, only because I'm in capable of achieving the things I want. I want them to be proud of me, and they may be right now, but who knows in time.

I woke up this morning not feeling right. I'm not at home, I'm in some other world that seems so strange to me. It's passing, I know it, but it is definately not going as quickly as one would hope. I want this stress to be gone, I want to accomplish some things and just stop worrying. I want that life I had back there where I didn't have to worry about the way I felt or to make someone proud. I didn't have to worry at all, it was all taken care of me and I could do as I pleased. But then thinking about that, I realise, this is just another part of growing up. I'm starting to face the reality of life as it truly is and I'm starting to see the world as an adult. I may not be an adult yet, but it sure feels like it. Too many expectations and things needed to be done. I'm scared."

Sad though, I've been saying goodbye to my friends, It's hard to just...say goodbye. It's knowing that I will never meet them again. It's also scary not knowing when I'll see Nadja again. 
On the up side, there are so many people I miss and I can't wait to see. My mom cried when she first saw me, I didn't know what to do. We're a lot closer now, and I'm glad for that. I really missed her, hell I still miss her and I havn't seen her for one day! I'm a loser but who cares.
Went to Die Toten Hosen on Saturday. Best concert ever! I was in the mosh pitt all night, and I have the bruises to prove it. Word of advice: If your small, don't mosh. I was carried away at one point, far away from Nadja. Then I fell and couldn't get up. Thankfully some guy picked me up and helped my back, otherwise I would have been screwed. Oh oh, get this. EVERYONE SAYS MY GERMAN IS AWESOME! So stoked. According to Nadja (who met all the other exchange students in Bremen while I was away) I'm the only one who really speaks German! Score! My fears are completely abolished and I can't wait to speak with you Jesse. How awesome is that! I'm sorta bilingual. hehe, ok, excitement is gone.
I'm off to take a nap before lunch, see you all on....well, I guess saturday.

Oh yeah, forgot to mention, you all come back on Friday from Richmond so if you want, I'm thinking of doing a party at my house Saturday night. If anyone wants to come, just give me a ring or mail me."

I've made an amazing life for myself here, I have friends, I party, and I have a new sister whom I actually get along with. 
Bremerhaven won last night in the basketball game, their now the top in Germany for their league. Awesome eh? We partied till about 12. I can actually talk to people too, like we saw Carston, Arne, Malze, Malte and Mike, Amile, and Nikole. I talked to all of them and didn't really have to ask Nadja for help. I even saw Tommy there, though I totally forgot who he was, then realized he's from Canada aswell.  But I've made friends here, and I'm so much more confident. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I don't want to leave. This is my new home and I love it here.
Kamloops is great, my friends and family are all there. They're the people who know me best, but I can't help feeling like I don't want to go back. I'm scared in a way, my life has changed so much over here and I know things will seems so different at home. Things change in three months whether people like it or not. I've changed a lot, my family's changed a lot, and I have no doubt in my mind so have my friends. My priorities have changed and I am beginning to realize what truly is important to me. My life here has given me something I will never let go, it's given me an understanding. It truly will be a bitter-sweet end."

All tests and courses are graded on a scale of 1-15, 1 being the lowest and 15 the highest kinda thing....I received an 8.25! What the hell! I'm an amazing student when it comes to English, what on Earth has happened to me? Schmeh, I don't care anymore, it's become more amusing than it is aggravating.
Only 9 more days and I see my mom. I'm so excited, which is very odd. As most of my friends know, I don't get along well with my mom, especially before concerts. For some odd reason she always finds a way to call me a bitch or a whore or some other thing an hour before hand. But honestly, I don't care anymore. All those times that I've slammed a door in her face or stormed out of the house is behind us and I miss her more than anything. She's my mommy and I can tell her everything, anything. Well...ok, some stuff she honestly doesn't need to know but you get the picture. Odd how some time apart can truly make you appreciate someone else. It's true what they say, distance makes the heart grow fonder. I even miss the little kid. It's odd how sisters are, we can be separated for the longest time, but nothing seems to change. We still talk, only when something exciting happens though. If we talked other times we would boar each other to death. Yeah, so I admit it, I love the kid and miss her deeply.
But as much as I miss home, I find that I've come to love this place as well. This is my new home, and in some way I'm sure I'll be ""Homesick"" when I get back to Canada. Odd how that is, though it's simply human nature. You become attached to something because it becomes familiar. Even smells, soaps, perfumes, food, they all turn on a sense of comfort. I know that when I smell baked bread it reminds me of my Grandma. When I smell Wrigley's Peppermint Gum I'm reminded of Vancouver (odd eh?). And sounds! The other day I was listening to one of Nadja's CD's and it just so happened to have a song on it reminding me of last winter/2003. Singing on the chair lift with Tracy, Carlea, and Katie D. I miss times like that and can't wait to make more. Even animal noises remind me of the Shuswap! Sigh....good times there too. 
Sorry for reminiscing. Just in a very good mood and can't wait to see my friends. 21 more to go! See ya,

Have to say, it was great fun and all, but my God what a dirty city. I would never recommend it to anyone for a visit. It was good though, did a little shopping and got to see a lot of stuff. I even went to a windmill museum (and no, that wasnt the highlight). But I have to say, I'm glad to be back home (German home that is). Apparently Erik had another sleepover with his girlfriend this weekend, he didn't come so he had the place to himself. So not fair. The kids here are allowed to have sleepovers with their boyfriend/girlfriend whenever they want. I like some of the traditions here..hehe.

It hurt some feelings and for that I'm truly sorry, but my feelings have taken quite a beating and what was done felt good. I'm sorry. It wasn't meant to hurt anyone, it was only meant for the purpose of my voice being heard. I love the people I was talking about, and after some talking with, there are new hopes that those friendships will be ok. They're very improtant people in my life and I care very deeply for them. And Garet, he was the one thing in my life that's gone right. He's made me the happiest girl I know and we've managed to make it through 5 months, which includes this long time with me here. 
I think me being away has opened my eyes to whats improtant in life. My friends. I know what I want out of life, and I also know who I care about, and it's most definately them. You guys have seen all the sides of me, from the little bitch to the sappy 2-year-old eating 1/6th of a medium icecream cake. Each of my friends means so much to me and I miss you like a duck would miss its feathers. I need you guys and I'm sorry for the fact that I too haven't been around a lot. But I do think of you guys, hell, I sometimes go to call you and then realise you're at school! But I will be home soon, and when that time comes, you guys are going to be at the top of my list. Well...maybe just under family (and boyfriend) but I will be there. I love you and miss you all. There's too many girls nights and horror films to forget. One thing I've noticed about you guys is that you're always there when you're needed. You are my support system. You are my family. And you guys are what makes my life worth it. To my friends.

"event","Ok, so here it is. The rant that's been living inside of me for 5 months. 5 months! So if you're up for it, read on. I've tried, I really have. I had at one point thought that there was a friendship there to salvage. I was wrong. There isn't anything left. 
It was one small rejection, one rejection. I tried my hardest, I had told him 3 times that it just wouldn't work. She promised that she would stay friends no matter what, that got fucked up too. She was my best friend, and he was close to me aswell. I didn't think it would happen this way. For the past 5 months I've felt like I got in the way of some amazing master plan for them, like I broke their destinies. I wasn't meaning to intrude on some personal level, I just liked the guy. 
When I started dating him, I was told lies that scared the crap out of me: ""He's only using you for ass Steph"" ""He's just desperate, he's not really over his last crush."" ""Everyone thought that we would end up together, not you two"". But I just said fuck it. I went ahead and did my own thing and I found that this guy I was dating was the best thing to happen to me in a while. I was happy again. Unfortunately, for my happiness, I lost what I thought was an amazing friendship.
They didn't talk to me for a long time. The sister ignored me and threw my feelings in the trash for the longest time. She finally got over it, saying that it was ok but it felt like I was intruding. I didn't know that I couldn't be friends with him, since when was he cattle? The brother still didn't talk to me till the day before I left. I thought things were finally gonna get better and they would go back to the way it was before all the shit.
I was wrong. Half way through my time here, the brother had invited me to be his grad date. I thought this was a way of rekindling the friendship, so I agreed to go. I even asked my boyfriend if it was ok. He said it was fine, but wished that the other guy would say something. I'm not exactly sure if he did end up saying something, but I do know they talked at some point. This is where my rant gets confusing, even for me, I'm sorry. But I do know that a few days later I received another letter telling me that my escort wasn't needed. That's alright too, I don't mind. After all, it is the boys decision. Unfortunately, I got a letter today from the sister, telling me that it was too bad about me not going and acting as if it were me who had rejected the brother, once again. 
I've only ever wanted to stay friends, I absolutely hate burning bridges. I even hate that I've made an enemy of my ex, it's just not right to cut people out completely. Unfortunately, I'm not quite sure what to do. As much as I would hate to lose even a chance at a friendship, I believe it's already gone. This bridge has been burning since this all began, and sadly, I didn't notice until now. I hate having enemies, so I won't look at him as one, but the bridge is gone.
I do appologise once again. My rant has been long but its something I've had to get off my chest. I hope people understand that this isn't something I'd like gossiped about. Most of you have probably figured out who the people are for its oh-so-obvious, but what I need you to understand is that this is my life. This is a major problem for me and I'm only ranting. Advice would be nice, but nothing more, please. I love you guys, and I know I do have true friends. Possibly in the brother and sister there is a friendship that I can rekindle, hopefully in the sister. I miss her, she was a great friend of mine, I'd like to think she still is. Life goes on and there are always friendships made and broken, I have never believed in a ""Friends Forever"" scenario because truthfully, it doesn't exist. People have flaws and that tends to get in the way. I just wish that there was such a thing as a ""Friends for Highschool"" scenario, but sometimes, that doesn't exist either. We'll see, I still have you guys after all. If you've taken the time to read this, then you do care. Thanks for being a friend.
Steph"

"event","Well hello there. Yes, another uneventful journal entry from me. First off, wanna say that I'm sorry. My last entry made me sound like such a whiny bitch. If you know me, I'm not like that all the time...just some times. As for my mood at the present, its actually pretty good. I had to bike in the rain to school today, for one moment I was actually blind be my hood. Very amusing for me. 
Tomorrow I'm headed off to Hamburg for a Saturday full of sightseeing. I'm not quite sure what exactly that includes for I've never heard of it being that entertaining, but anywhere in Germany is fun. Went to Nadjas soccer game last night. Her team is so good, they've asked me to play with them, and sure I'm stoked, but cmon, everybody knows I'm not the greatest. My team used to say that it wasn't a game unless Steph fell. And sure enough, every game I fell atleast once, and it was always me who went home covered in the dirt. Meh, it's still fun. I'll see, they're giving me a try during training on Saturday....can we say nervous?
Heard from some friends yesterday, that was pretty good. But it seems the more I hear about Kamloops, the more is the same. I'm reminded of why I was so happy to leave, and then I'm reminded of why I can't wait to come home. I know that my school and friends always have some kind of drama going on, and the break from the ""Band Room Soap Opera"" was nice, but it seems as my time here winds down, that I kinda miss it. Sure it's nothing like the OC or the Desperate Housewives, but it's our stupid little story that makes every day exciting. So I'm actually admitting that I miss it. And I miss my friends. Here I'm often ignored, some people don't even think I can speak any German at all (though it gets better everday, and Jesse: past tense is SO FUN) German gets easier to understand and speaking it is too. But even my teachers ignore me, which is actually very nice so dont think I'm complaining. I just can't wait to be home is the point I'm getting to.
Though I'll miss a lot of things here. Like Nadja ofcourse, and Malze. And Imo and Janna. And a lot of the people who actually have acknowledged my existence. And I'll miss the Peanut Butter Flavoured chips, and the bread. Oh, and the saunas. But I'll bring home every memory with me, and maybe even some day come back. I'm glad I came here. If Jesse remembers, there was a I time when I almost backed out. I'm glad I didn't and I'm so happy that I took the plunge to come here. I may have gained a little weight here, and missed out on a lot of things at home, but it was worth it. I wont ever forget it.
Anyway, I should get going, I've babbled on mindlessly long enough.

"event","Hey guys,
So here I am, at school. What fun! Actually, I don't mind the system, I came to school at 8 and I'm leaving at 1:15, it's pretty great. But I'M SO BORED! Found out for sure that I'm going to Hamburg this weekend, which is pretty awesome. Apparently I'm going into a dungeon thingy or something. Stoked. AND my parents will soon be in the same country I'm in, 20 more days! That's so great. Then they come up here after a few days in Frankfurt. They plan to whisk me away for 2 weeks and take me to Luxemburg, Belgium, Holland, and France. I've already decided on saving my money for chocolate in Belguim. mmmm...chocolate. hah, went shopping yesterday in Bremen. Cluadia (Nadja's mom) was having coffee there with all the other moms from the exchange. K, so get this, I've been going for little over a month without any help except from Nadja's parents to learn this language. Every other kid gets to go to the meetings but I don't really have a way of getting there. And all the moms were saying that their exchange students aren't even interested in LEARNING! How screwed up is that. They're all wasting their time partying and getting drunk. If the police crashed one of the discos here and found a Canadian drunk, that student would be sent home IMMEDIATELY!  We signed a contract that banned us from drinking. Ok, I'll admit I've slightly broken that rule, but mind you, I didn't get drunk. A glass of Champagne or a beer with the parents isnt going to kill you, but when you end up having major hangovers every Saturday morning, they will most definately send you home. Urgh, pisses me off. Why would people waste there time in here like that. This is an experience that very few can take part in, and who knows when you will get the chance to go to Germany again. It's stupid.
And what the hell is wrong with my parents. They're always saying stuff, getting mine and my sisters hopes up, and then changing their minds. First they pissed me off with the notion of moving. Then got me excited for the renovations. Now they're cancelling all renovations and just deciding that ""a new coat of paint would be nice"". Assholes. I wish that they could stop saying every stupid idea that pops into their heads because my reaction ends up making me look stupid. No wonder Ashleys so fucked up. She grew up in a sucking dream world where things just seemed so happy. My ass. God, this explains a lot. Glad I'm not home, otherwise I'd be ripping out my hair. I never realized how flaky my mom is either until I left. All she ever has to talk about is the latest news about the Royal Family or what the neighbors have been up to. Apparently, (well, according to my mother) the neighbors are out to get us. Does she think they're derranged lunatics? Honestly, the woman needs to grow up. And my dad never talks to me. The moment I call home, if he picks up, its like ""Hi, hang on a moment....KATHY!"" and then I'm talking to my mom about the latest gossip in Kamloops for a bloody hour. Don't get me wrong here, I love my parents and all, I just think that they need to grow up and realize what retards they're making of themselves. They're just really dumb.
Anywho, thats my rant, take it or leave it. I'm out.

"event","Hey guys;
Good news! I'M NOT MOVING!!! Lindsay blew the whole thing out of proportion. Yes my parents loved the house, but...they love our house better! I get to stay in Aberdeen. Though I would have gotten a car out of the deal...meh. So we're just going to renovate our house! I get to meet with the designer and everything. So stoked! Anywho, Germany...yeah. So, totally lonely here right now, but I'm actually ok with it. Nadja wanted me to go with her to some party that everyone was planning on getting drunk at, so I didn't go. Proud, though she got really pissed off at me and didn't talk to me for half an hour. meh, it's alright now. Oh, and yes, I know who you are Jordan, I happen to have acknowledged your existence atleast once or twice. And Jesse, thanks for the offer on the driving thing, really sweet. But I'm so stoked I won't be needing to take you up on that! hehe, IM NOT MOVING! 
Oh, k, was gonna talk about something.....ugh....my minds gone blank....oh yeah, Erik's coming to Canada in the summer. Nadja's little brother. He got the exchange for this year so he's going to live in Kelowna. But, because he's Nadja's little brother and my unofficial little brother, he may be coming to Kamloops for a weekend or something. So, if he does, Jesse seemed to really hit it off with him and hes a nice guy, maybe we could have a party or something. It doesn't sound like his exchange partner is really planning on doing anything with him so we could even go down to the beach or...I dunno. It's just a thought. So yeah, just thought I'd mention that. Anywho, I should probably go. Still waiting for those emails guys. Don't you love me no more? I should hope you still do.
Stephie"

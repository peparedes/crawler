Death Cab for Cutie- AMAZING. period. 

I am praying for this last month of school to just be done already.
I want to go home. I want to work and make $$$.
I want to randomly go to Chesapeake and see my fave person.
I want to just enjoy the sun and the beach.

But for now...I have a 7 page paper due tomorrow, and I am 
procrastinating as we speak. 
I have to go look at a one-bedroom apt. on W. Grace at 12:30.
yeh...I won't even go there.

I had a blast over Easter..got some funky homemade jewelry from
the decoy show. Hung out with my sis and bro which was awesome.
played some put-put golf. chilled with my much missed friends.
that about sums that up.

I'm in <3...and I don't care who knows. :)"

"event","and why would they? I only update every two weeks apparently. 
But my life isn't that interesting anyhow.
  Last weekend I saw my sister for the first time in two months. Thumbs up to that.
RJ came with. -awesome- :o) Winston fell in love with him. Now RJ wants a bulldog.
I can't blame them. I looovvvee them. 
  Other interesting happenings of the week:
-the big storm mesmerized VCU students in the dirty gurk. Everyone were on the balconies
watching the lightning. I, however, would like to assume that Bryan, Ben, and I had the
best time. Bryan brought out the guitar and freestyled a song about the rain really
loudly. awesome time. Then we played scattergories for awhile. fun game. buy it.
-I can't even remember what I did yesterday. Sleep wasn't one of them. 
-TODAY:
-Walked to a potential apartment to rent. Guy didn't show. He's ill, so he gets a reprieve. 
we're going back again on monday.
-Bryan had a conversation with a kitty named Bravo. Kitty needs to see a vet. :(
[just a side note...if you are going to have a pet, at least take care of it! geez,
I just don't understand how people can do that and neglect them.]
-Ate at Panda Veg w/Bryan...then walked to the TiTy Lounge ;) and got a mango slush with boba.
Now I'm suffering from a severe case of the itis. Couldn't even watch a movie. Had to go home &
pass out.
-My arm is stained yellow from a tofu rose. Sweet!

AnD....I'm coming home tomorrow [briefly] and then heading to SU for the night to stay with
the coolest chickie Leah..then on saturday, driving to NJ with some old SU buds and seeing
Death Cab for Cutie!!! soooooooo excited. hopefully I'll update this thing a little better next
time and let you know how it went! PS- seeing Mute Math and The Working Title again on Monday~!!

I feel like I'm rambling..but who cares. I don't. soo yeh...I have a boyfriend and he's great. 
He makes me smile..a lot! and he got my sister's stamp of approval. always a good thing.
I honestly value her opinion more than my mom's. If you knew her, you'd know why. I call her
mom sometimes b/c she's harder on me than my own mother. gotta love older sisters. I've noticed 
that things come to a person when they least expect them and in the unlikeliest of places. It
 really makes the experience that much greater <3 Okay I'm done. Adios!

PS- i REALLY miss my best friend :("

 but I will name the main places and people I spent it with...

*OC- everyone!
*the bury- leah
*d.c.- whitney
*and then back to fist city
overall...710 miles of traveling..what a week.

Saturday night I went to see Mute Math, The Working Title, 
and Too Late the Hero with Kerry Anne and Bryan. 
I sometimes wonder how they put up with my ridiculous road rage outbursts.
Anyways, the show was Grrrreat! Apparently it was my first show,
because locals shows don't count and neither do festivals, so I was told.
Everytime Kerry looked at me, I was taking vid-clips of the bands. 
I couldn't help it. I'm obsessed with my new phone. I should
also mention the crazed obsessed Mute Math fan that was standing
next to me. Reaching way back into memory, I once told Bryan I 
would die if I was in the same room with Mute Math. But clearly
I was mistaken, because this girl took the cake.
Yesterday I saw the Hills have Eyes...I am thoroughly disturbed. 
It was a good movie, but also gory and I can't count how many times I jumped. 
Today SUCKED...guess what guys...looks like I'll be living in Richmond and
taking classes for the whole summer basically. So I'm royally pissed/upset. 
June 12-August 11. I could cry...wait, did that already. Now I can't enjoy the
beautiful beach and my friends and I can't make any money! W-T-F ??
Oh and the icing on that cake is that I tried every college I could think of
(ESCC, SU, Worwic, UMES, and even online courses) and none offered the classes
I have to take. AWESOME."

"event","I haven't written in this thing for like a week, so I figured I should go ahead and do that at 1:30 am...because let's face it, I never sleep. I came upon two revelations this weekend: 1. Spontaneous= weird and 2. I am the procrastinating queen. I have two papers, a novel, and 5 exams this week before I can enjoy my spring break...So, the weekend would have been a great time to study. But no...I didn't study at all. Oh well. I did spend ALL day in the library today, hoping that makes up for some of it. but probably not. 

And..I got my nose pierced on both sides with cute lil pink studs. Bryan, Steph, and my roomie Sarah joined me to River City Tattoos on Sat. night. And Bryan thinks I'm weird because I randomly decide to do things like that. But it's cool :) Then we saw the Chapelle movie *thumbs way up* you must see it. I also watched Walk the Line and Elizabethtown this weekend. Both good. I honestly cannot stop thinking about Friday and coming home. It is ALL I think about. Booking it the hell out of 'fist city' and home to the 7 mile island that most people don't appreciate until they move away. 

Ohhh yeh, not that anyone calls me, but if you plan on it...change your mind. because my phone is JACKED!
getting a new one next tuesday. It was already semi-broken, but I got mad at it, and now its done. So, now that I have spewed the contents of my weekend out here for everyone to read, I am suddenly tired. Spewed is a gross word. sorry guys. 

Night!

p.s.- still sick :("

"event","So...12 days until I come home. I can't wait to see all my friends. I miss them like crrrazy.
On other subjects, I spent the weekend in VA Beach...I watched a lot of Family Guy & Chapelle's Show. Can't go wrong with that. 

It amazes me how someone can figure me out pretty easily. Am I that easily readable? I don't like that. What I don't like even more is how close that person was to being right. I'm not trying to say I want to be mysterious or so complex that no one can understand me, but I got pegged. and it sucks.



I wish I was strong.
I wish I could fool you.
I wish I had no heart.
I wish I didn't care.
I wish I knew me...like you do.

maybe one day...maybe one day. 


...so confused these days :/"

"event","Okay...So, I nearly don't wake up for class, because for some unknown reason, I can't get up after having more than 7 hours of sleep. I guess I'm so used to a lack of it, that it has a reverse effect.
Then, I'm struggling to pay attention to history, but the lights are off...and for God's sake, who can stay awake at a 9:30 am class when the lights are off? not this girl. So I failed another pop quiz.
Then I'm walking to the bookstore to buy a chem solutions manual. It's like $80! great.
Here comes the kicker...I go grocery shopping at Ukrops because the only thing I had for food
was pasta. And I ate that last night, with no sauce haha. But I came out of there with a ton of food.

Heavy bags + 10 minute walk = muscle spasms
so now when I lift so much as a paper plate, my whole arm shakes. 


Amidst all this complaining, 
I just ask one thing...
Someone, please...just make me smile once today. 


I miss home :("

"event","soo..last night was my first night ""out"" in Richmond. Bryan, Kerry, Ben, and I went to Sahara (hooka bar) to listen to some bands. There was an all girl band, which is awesome(flat tailed rats). My fave though was Channel 43. So, then I'm back at Bryan's and Whit calls me from D.C. I went out to visit her a few weekends ago, and I met this guy at Platinum. Well, she has this guy on the phone! I guess she randomly found him again or something? I don't know, but it was kinda weird. It wouldn't be weird if she was at the same club and saw him again, but they were at a bowling alley? hah

Anyways, this morning I am awakened by Kerry & Bryan---kinda nice having a person alarm clock :) ...had to go talk to the rents for her. I had to seem 'awake' and bryan had to seem 'tired' even though we felt opposite. But apparently after acting that way, it made us that way. So, he's probably sleeping now and here I am. wtf?
Wow, the more I sit here, the more things fall off the walls in my room. because tape doesn't like to stick to cinderblocks. Gosh I love the dirty gerk. So, the rest of my day will most likely consist of shopping with kerry and bryan at short pump and then listening to his radio show at 6...and this time he can embarrass Kerry on the air instead of me!! yesssss! Oh yeh, and I got my first visitor yesterday! Even if it was only two hours..so worth it. I'm still waiting for 'someone' to visit so we can spoon [j/k]"

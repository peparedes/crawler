When living this down makes so much sense, we collide. Onward, until we hit again. I kept your picture just behind the eye those weeks when our distance grew. I Drove north where I found you waiting in Des Moines. Thank god I am  not losing 
you. And I hope you're not alone and sleep through this weather. And I hope you're whole again - back home we'll sleep better.

you're boring me.

love, 
jenny


p.s. my mom's house feels good today. i had an interview in manhattan yesterday at a fine arts studio and gallery. i got the job! i'm really excited. during my interview heather, the manager who interviewed me said that she really enjoyed my emails. she said it's cute how i use a lot of exclamation points! i had a bag of clothing, and a bus ticket to boston. i met up with sashi, and somehow, i had a change of heart. i just couldn't bail on my mom. her nurse works monday through friday and she needs someone for the weekends. that's where i come in. i'll be making money in manhattan at the studio and gallery, but a girl's gotta pay her rent! and buy shoes! my step dad somehow worked out a deal with the MS society, and now i get 200$ a weekend to take care of my mom. i've been doing it since highschool, so it's pretty much second nature by now.

i've been doing a lot of fashion illustration for fun. i've also been working on t-shirt designs that hopefully i'll turn into actually t-shirts using the print making studio at school. i want to make a special t-shirt for all my best friends! i already did some jots for one for kaitlyn, kristina, katie, harry, peej, nicole, and alyssa. it's a surprise though. 

i've been doing a lot of retail therapy whenever i feel sad, but it has really done wonders. my hair is really dark and purple. i don't want it to fade anymore. my mom gave me my brother's old bedroom since he no longer lives here. somehow within the last week, it more or less consists of victorian furniture, but it's nice. i'm kind of into having a table in my bedroom, and having a walk in closet should have occurred a long time ago! i've been hanging out with steph a lot, which is kind of ironic. i'm really surprised we ever disliked eachother. liz lives in the same development as my mom, so she's always down for constant hang. i miss katie! and harrison! i have a lot of stuff waiting for me in allston, and some unfinished business."

1:39 am, and i'm not sure what to do. there's lots of boxes, there's nothing in the fridge besides celery and philadelphia cream cheese, theres some ants, a locked door, a sense of comfort, a scent of honey, another scent of stale smoke, my brother telling me to shower, my conscience telling me to put down my drink, friends telling me that i'm frightening them, and a voice in my head telling me, ""do not stop creating. it's coming, i promise.""


i've been back on Long Island since around 2am on thursday night. I got to my stepdad's house. it was really upsetting that my room had no furniture. my drawing desk was still there, with everything on it. my blankets and pillows were still there as well. i guess my mom and brother didn't need those. they took a lot. i think i panicked the most when i realized they took the coffee maker. my stepdad wasn't generally nice, to say the least. when i went to go sleep at kristina's, he grabbed me shoulder and wouldn't let me. how old am i again? i went outside to smoke a cigg, and he came outside and tried to confiscate them! i slept on the floor of my bedroom with my dog, on top of my blankets, and he yelled at me the next morning! what was i supposed to do? i was sad, and it was about more than them taking my furniture for themselves, my stepdad not keeping my room, and sleeping on the floor. i lived with my mom and my brother my entire life. and now; now i don't have that option. the house was empty and depressing. on top of that, my stepdad was acting like a drunken nightmare. 

friday morning, i layed in ""bed."" and by ""bed"" i mean my arrangement of pillows and blankets on my wooden floor. it was really the only thing there was to do. once i got up, i threw whatever clothing i could fit in my handbag, found out my mom's new adress, told robert i was going out for coffee, and came here. 

on my mom's place: it's in the southpoint community, across the street from Berner. it looks kind of trashy outside, but it's really nice on the inside. my brother is living it up. he has my comfortable bed, my computer chair, my curtains, my cds, my stereo, and i guess anything that he wanted from my room. he has his own bathroom, 800$ worth of decor from linens and things. he has my moms debit card consisting of all the money she has left, which he seems to have no problem using constantly. he's basically being rewarded for being a 22 year old loser, who lives at home with his disabled mother, and takes complete advantage of her, and her money. it's not even like he's taking care of her. he ignores her, as he always has, and makes her nurse, Colleen clean up after him. i devoted the majority of my time and effort to her, moved to boston to persue art school, live off of bread and cereal, never ask her for a penny despite being absolutely broke; and while i'm doing the mature thing by starting my own life and making something of myself, she nurtures the loser? not only that, she gives him all my fucking stuff? couldn't i have atleast been informed so i could have perhaps salvaged a few photographs, knick knacks, or stuffed animals? i'm sorry. i'm not one for utterly ranting, especially to this extent. but c'mon?

in the last few day: i have rearranged my lifestyle to one a lot similar to Johnny Depp in ""The Secret Window."" i have been drinking like a sailor, smoking like a chimney, scribbling thoughts and sketches in a beat up composition book like a lunitic, in seclusion. i decided rather than getting completely shitfaced at night for a few hours, i would just stay tipsy all day and night. still going about my day normally, i drink a beer, i drink coffee, i drink spiked coffee, i shower, i drink a vodka tonic, i hang out, drinking sprite with vodka, eating drinking wine, watching television,drinking vodka, drawing, seeing my friends, never apart from my flask. i didn't start to really feel like shit until this afternoon. it's definately taking it's toll. i made this commitment, and i intend on keeping it. i sleep on my mom's couch. i think i'm going back to Boston tomorrow to see John before he goes back to VA. all my clothing is at my stepdad's. he's not speaking to me. I don't care that much. I feel really comfortable here, in the sense that I am no longer constantly walking on eggshells. I know my stepdad isn't going to bark at me for breathing incorrectly. Then again, this place is bumblefuck compared to his house. My friends would stop by and come and go as they please because the location was convenient. also,  it was a large, beautiful house, and i was in love with my bedroom. here, i don't even have a place to be alone. There's the couch, in the living room. there's no other room. my brother treats this place like his bachelor pad. so, when him and his girlfriend kick me off the couch to watch a movie, where do i go? 


i'm done ranting."

"event","<center><b>i need to stop trying to post an entry and then becoming side tracked. so here's a draft from finals week when i was still in Boston</b>

yes, hello. i'm back. i haven't written in here since before halloween. so many things that don't matter have happened. i was forced by the state of new york to go home one weekend. i got evaluated for all the wrong i did when i was seventeen. i told them i don't drink. clean piss, clean slate. 

onto better things. <b>thanksgiving</b> came and went. i hung out with kristina, nicole, and sashi a lot, and drank more than jesus. seriously, the extent to which i drank every night was uncalled for. i didn't see kaitlyn, alyssa, kathleen, or mike d. i'm sure i'll see them eventually. i didn't get to spend thanksgiving with my family in brooklyn or st. louis like i usually do. they had other plans. instead, i was dragged to new jersey with my stepdad. his family was throwing a party at ""the mansion."" yeah, real original. well, i ate a lot of seafood since i don't eat meat, and it was open bar. it was open bar. the bar was free. they didn't ID at the bar. guys, did i mention it was open bar? i'll stop.

<b>John</b> and I are good. he wants to buy me a kitten. if he does i'm going to name it ""Stella."" he's been pretty wonderful. i love him.

<b>My Mom</b> and my brother, kevin moved. they moved into a two bedroom condo. yeah, i know the score. i don't really care that much, it's just that kevin's almost twenty three years old. he shouldn't live with mommy anymore. i could understand her having a guestroom or one room we'd both share. whatever, i really don't plan on ever going to her and kevin's place. so, the part that's really fucked; kevin is the one who told me they moved, VIA TEXTMESSAGE. then, he proceeded to tell me that they took my furniture out of my bedroom because they need it. so, my mom took my bed. my brother took my dresser. they probably auctioned off the rest. sometimes, it feels like they go out of their way to hurt me. so, i don't really know what's going on for break.

<b>finals</b> are brutal. katie and i have been pulling all nighters, barely eating, rarely showering, and definately not sleeping. i kicked ass at my final portfolio review for my drawing class. i'm pretty happy about that. i got a call from a co-worker back at novoarts in nyc, and it turns out, i've been requested to be in an upcoming gallery in downtown manhattan in january. i'm flattered but nervous, and as always, impartial. color psychology is the only class i'm really nervous about. 2D is annoying but i'm not worried, and Literature is literature. i spent hours upon hours on my research paper. ""Muses are unknowingly sacraficing themselves"" was the most difficult point to try to prove."

A breakdown of what's been up with me; I started wearing my hair down again. My shoes are too big for me. A lot of my clothing is too big. My clothing could be growing, or I am shrinking. I'm always pretty broke, so someone needs to feed me. I have a boyfriend, John, who I completely adore. I have absolutely no desire or even drunken thought of cheating, which is incredible, and a first. My best friend, Nicole might move into my apartment and transfer to the same school. My best friend here already lives in my apartment. My apartment building is 18 apartment complexes consisting of college students, all of which are so much fun. Including my boyfriend, who only live eight carpeted steps below me; the Sid to my Nancy. I have a conscience list of amazing friends to see back on Long Island. I'm clinching my teeth with aggravating, redundant, yet enlightening assignments. I meet the best people at parties, on the train, and in fine art lectures. I think I can only name three people here that call me ""Jenna."" Everyone else thinks I look more like a Jenny. I go by ""Jenny"" now. I carry a bottle of wine with me most of the time. It's 2 for 10$ at the liquor store down the block.
 
Today was 65 and sunny. I spent a good portion of the morning sleeping in, and watching saturday morning cartoons with cutiepie. I kept looking out the windows and feeling bad that I wasn't taking advantage of the weather. John was real tired, but I wasn't. This afternoon I ended up taking advantage of the weather in the best way possible. Steve, Jess, and I walked along the Charles river, down to the dock, and watched the sailboats, gondalas, and the entire city from the best perspective ever.

Instead of going back to New York for Columbus day weekend, seeing a bunch of my friends, going to Anglin's super awkward football party, seeing my family in Brooklyn, and going to court; I decided to stay here an get drunk with John for five days straight. I'm officially the worst person ever. I just couldn't go home. It didn't feel right yet. There were so many sick parties though. It was an intense weekend. I thought about going back this weekend because Kaitlyn is home as well. I didn't. Boston's really fun, harder to feed myself, easier to get around, harder to afford anything, easier to sleep, higher standards. Since my mom is moving into a two bedroom, I suggested a bunk bed to my brother, Kevin. It's not like I'd be there much. He wasn't into it. He's 22 years old. That is entirely too old to be living with Mommy. He can have it all. I'm building a life here.

this weekend was good because anglin came to visit. we decided not to sleep last night, and after britney's party i drank in john & tyler's room until 2pm this afternoon. it's really not as awesome as it sounds; i think we just drink too much. i would have napped, but since this summer, napping feels like dying in the afternoon. i have a lot of assignments to do, as always. i don't even know why i am posting to my livejournal instead of painting, drawing, and writing essays. i really want to finish a lot of my personal art. however, i never have time to do my own thing, other than assigned art projects. i understand the importance of assignments though. i want to go to chicago, baltimore, prague, paris, and munich. someday? winter? chyea, right. nicole really likes boston. she's reapplying to suffolk and hopefully she will be here this spring. there's a bunch of festivals near me today, but i'm too drunk, tired, and downright beat to do anything. maybe i'll do something. to anyone who read this, i'm sorry for wasting your time."

"event","<center>Yesterday(friday) Katie and I went to Newbury commons with Steve and Hannah. however, before we met up with them, we bought 70 fortune cookies. we walked around newbury commons, gave people cookies, read their fortunes to them, and introduced ourselves as ""Stella and Stella."" i'm pretty sure people are going to start tripping us on the street. last night i went to a rave in cambridge. i know, a rave. how ridiculous is that? glowsticks, neon, flashing hoolahoops, drugs, and more booze than i could expect. i gave my number to a 28 year old woman, who i was pounding tequilla with. this morning i found sandles in my handbag, beer i didn't buy, and cigarettes that i don't smoke. after the rave, we went to a party in allston, in my area. I saw Liz there. Hey, Liz, sick life. Steve got mad at me first for walking in before everyone, and then again for leaving to go to a different party with Mike. I woke up with a huge ciggarette burn dragging down my arm. I ate beerios this morning, because coffee just wasn't doing anything. i'm sure i left many things out. So since I really don't feel like explaining myself; friends, after reading this, i am alive and well in Boston. oh, and still so wasted. here are pictures of my room.

"event","boston is so far, the greatest place i have ever lived. philadelphia was fun to get drunk in, and it was sunny. it wasn't a place i could see myself living after college, or building a career. the new england school of art and design at suffolk university is absolutely beautiful, practically one big gallery. where can i possibly begin? i have been struck by the sniffles again; an annuel gift from the changing seasons. we grip eachother for warmth one minute, and lay lifeless to avoid the heat, the next. a hack here, and cough there; moving past eachother with an aching head. (and sometimes an aching heart.) he made me laugh until my insides played outside. 

my apartment is the luckiest thing that has ever happened to me, if that doesn't sound sad. it's two other girls and I. one of my roommates Katie, is the best. we straight chill, get drunk in mid-day, and tell eachother how much we love another. Heather is really cool, but we don't have as much in common as Katie and I do. Each of us have our own huge bedroom. we have an even bigger common room, which we are turning into Asia. Asian art, asian table, floor pillows, bamboo curtains, bamboo plants, and a great wall of china created the other night. My room is Happy Blue Year. I bought the pretties blue comforter, among other unique things. I bought an Andy Warhol print. it's also blue, with a cat. I framed a picture of his factory and hung it above my desk for inspiration. I purchased five Kurt Halsey canvases, and hung them above my bed. It's crazy how expensive Kurt Halsey's work is now that he is emerging more than ever, but it's so worth it.  What's also so comforting is that the lease on the apartment is for a year. finally, somewhere I can rest my head that is actually mine; something that cannot be ripped out from under me, or torn apart beyond my control. Last year my stepdad had to bride me to come home for thanksgiving instead of going upstate to Rob's. I never <i>have</i> to go home. I payed for this, it's mine. I purchased all of the furniture, dragged it across the city, and put it together myself. Heather, Katie, and Mike said it was hysterical watching me build up determination, strain myself, give up, go at it again, mess up; the whole process. Finally, something that is mine. 
I hang out with steve gruber entirely too much. Berklee parties are awesome because there's always really interesting bands playing. by Wednesday my feet already felt like they could fall off from dancing so much. Thursday we ate pot brownies, split a bottle of wine, and watched finding nemo at Ellie's. i talked about the film in an extremely philosophical way. I talked for ten minutes about why it should be called, ""Ressurecting Nemo."" I'm really glad Steve's here too. It's just comforting to have someone that familiar around. today he's coming over, and we're going to splatter blue paint on my walls. I have so many assignments due. The assignment for my painting class is basically what i did every day at NovoArts in Manhattan. I kind of wanted to rip my eyes out when he was doing demonstrations, and thuroughly explaining the process. After class I stayed after to tell him about NovoArts and what I did there. Then we talked about Jasper Johns for about thirty minutes. I'm really glad to be surrounded by people like that.

i have so many art assignments due this week. yesterday i spent 300$ on art supplies. i didn't even get everything i need. that's one of the downers of fall semester. there's no escaping how much money you need to spend on supplies; every year. i hung out with john for 35 consecutive hours from friday until about an hour ago. i am completely captivated by his spectacular views. a conversation with him is unlike anything else.

i'm thuroughly enjoying myself."

"event","<center>my mind is drifting, and i'm moving to boston. my mother hates me, i have the slightest clue as to why, and a shoe addiction. someone needs to buy me the entire new marc jacobs jewelry line. last night was brigid's birthday at amanda's apartment in manhattan. it was my first time rollin'. it was different, but i definately feel like a train hit me this morning. i was so under control that i almost wasn't into it. i changed my mind every ten minutes. water out of solo cups soon shifted to tequilla out of shot glasses. i met spiderman, and woke up with hello kitty stickers on my skin. i started working on two new sketchbooks. one is photo-illustration, and the other is more or less literature. i get utterly stumped on them constantly. i guess that's what i get for going about sketchbooks as if they were novels. i grow more uncertain as to where i'll end up by the day. my biggest fear is that the worst is yet to come. and no, i still don't know how i am going to feel once my mother passes. i act like a saint, but i think like a sinner; or is it vise-versa? i'm just trying to make it out of this alive. oh, and i learned that i'm drunker than ecstacy."

"event","it's finally starting to feel like summer. sometimes, at least. i've been taking it easy with the workload, and giving myself some days of the week off, i've getting drunk real early in the afternoon, i've been staying drunk for long periods of time, and i've been pretty much acting like a drunken monster. i guess it's summer. last weekend i threw a suprise party for kathleen. that was the moment it felt like summer again. i'm pretty sure i stayed drunk for longer than ever. if i had to estimate, i would say a good 30 hours. sad, right? yesterday i went to peej house early in the afternoon. i was already drunk, so i gave her some brews to get on my level. there was paulapalooza, and then jesi's graduation party. i'm wearing my black day dress. i think it's officially my hangover dress. i cleaned my room this morning, or this afternoon, since i slept late. it's nice. i have a wall filled with post-its, drawn on by my best friends. since, i can't damage the wallpaper ever since the room was repainted. it's what i use for decoration. i like it. i'm fucking around with newspapers and vanilla folders, being a creep. it's coming out pretty funny. kathleen and i went to rockaway beach on friday morning to visit jimmy. i swear to god, he brought us to the house of wax. i thought we would be axe murdered for sure. 

so, my two most selfish thoughts lately. i kind of hope anglin doesn't get into new paltz, so she will go to suffolk university with me. it's so wrong, because she's one of my best friends and deserves new paltz. she worked hard this year and now has a 3.9 gpa. also, last night ed told me that he quit his band. i'm kind of happy. he's always at band practice and maybe now things will go back to normal, and we can hang out like we used to. i know; i've never been so selfish or so selfless in my entire life. i cried beer tears last night. not like, the kind where you spill your heart to someone. i just like, was crying because i was cold, i think? i don't know. 

yesterday peej read me a note that she wrote when she was on shrooms. it sounded a lot like how i write sober. i write the same sober, drunk, on drugs. i think it's quirky. 

fuckkkkk life. my poloroid camera broke. i really need to go to AC Moore. i need a tiny sketchbook for my next project. i need glue. i just looked out my window and saw that paul is home. i think i'm going to ask him to lend me a movie. it's so nice out, but i'm pretty sure all of my friends are at work. i really don't have the energy to go out. oh, and my spacebar works again? fucking, randommmmmm. i'm typing like a teeny bopper. i'll write more later.

oh, and here. pictures.

"event","i'm almost laughing before posting. what more is there to say? I can talk about my job. I am dying to see where I end up a few years from now because with working in the art industry, it just keeps getting better. I still work at Novo Arts, only now I work in the studio. Let me take a breath before letting this one out. I love love love love love love love it. I paint for eight hours a day. The owner of the company isn't breathing down my neck, I get to chain smoke, read magazines, and actually conversate with people as free spirited as I am. oh, and did I mention that they don't make me come in 5 days a week and work overtime? Well, I should've. I did a lot of shitty, good, bad things this weekend. I am now a resident of the real world. (hahaha) I'm doing some writing, somewhat about one of my best friends, Eddy. It's not lovesick poetry, still he inspires me. Recently, he gave me the idea to take public transportation, draw everything I see, and afterwards, make an exhibit of everything from that day once I get home. I remember writing a letter, and actually posting an entry with a picture of Rob, back in December. I still cannot believe that I was able to dig that far down, in terms of Literature; or that he made me write like that. Justin Balwin, while reviewing my portfolio told me that all of the issues with my family, my mother, my health, and struggle is going to drive me to continue with my techniques. He said that he as time goes on, as much as it hurts, the deeper that I dig, the better my work will become, and that I'm going to carry this with me for years. It's fucked up, but one day i'll get it out somehow; i'll dig deep enough. There's a link to some writing that incorporates into art pieces that i've done. I only have a few, because I'm not very consistant, but rather delicate with it. It's going to take me a little more time to write something for Eddy, or say what I need. Sometimes I know that the age difference will destroy our friendship completely; yet, I have this feeling in my gut that years from now, I'll meet someone spectacular, get engaged, have a springtime wedding, and leave him at the alter, for him. How not only unrealistic, but rude is that?

"event","so, things are undecided. i have or had these big, big plans. i don't know my right from my left lately. yesterday during my lunch break at novoarts, i was just walking around; walking around, looking up at the tall, manhattan buildings, and it's almost as if i was pondering my existance. i was thinking about not going back to school. i know, it sounds irrational. however, maybe school just isn't for me. that happens right? I thought maybe i could just intern long enough to get a job at Novo Arts. afterall, i truely like it there, so much. it's such a step up from Stark Design, which was also good. 

Then again,


""Wow, you're only nineteen? You're so young. I wish I could have gotten that early of a start in the business,"" everyone says to me. ""i'm too young for all this,"" is the thought drilled into the back of my head. when i'm standing in a court room, when i'm walking around an office in my pencil skirt and heals, when i'm checking out apartments in brooklyn; it's all i can say to myself from the back of my head loud enough for my heart to hear. i've got my entire life. Why am i acting as if my time on earth is limited; as if I am a bomb that will go off if I don't have my future and career planned out within the three months? however, sometimes I feel like i'm going to explode if i don't do these great things. Basically, my heart and my head have a love/hate relationship.

Then Today,

I found out that I have been accepted to my second choice school; Suffolk University, in Boston, MA. I have imagined moving to Boston in my daydreams. I can finish interning this summer, and be off to Boston in the fall. However, It's 18,000 per semester. Should I take out more student loans? I'm broke as a joke. Should I take my time, clinch my teeth, and go to Nassau Community, followed by a Scholarship to SVA?  Should i forget about school, continue interning, and see where the wind takes me? Should I move to Boston, and go to this great, but expensive school, with this fear of feeling as i sometimes did in Philadelphia? I need advice. Any advice? 

It's really too bad they don't make pamphlets for the road less traveled. I was smoking a ciggarette on my little roof before, and before climbing back in my window; i stood up. I had never felt so tall. I mean that in every sense possible.

ADVICE, PLEASE."

today is my second day interning at novoarts, as an art consultant in the corp. office. i am going to be spending some days at the studio painting and photographing. so, i liked stark design. so far, i love this internship. first off, in stark design; it was mr. stark, julia, the german intern, and i, in an office for ten hours. though there were hysterical visits from blaise, and i met a lot of really awesome people, photographers, and artists, it's dead silence beyond julia's ipod for a good portion of the day. here, it's this awesome loft soho loft office, with about 15 other people, maybe more. it's huge with a lot of nooks and crannies. everyone's upbeat, friendly, and surrounding me. my stepdad made me a powershake this morning with fruit and i brought it to work. he used a lot of fruit and protein powder because i don't get any protein. it's kind of.... chunky...

oh, well. oh, and i finally joined the blogisphere as i was supposed to a month ago. it's good to have that up and running. wouldn't that be cool if i actually got some pieces done tomorrow? yeah, i don't think anyone should get their hopes up. one thing that's better about stark design is the dress code. besides the time that i wore a bandtee the the day that calvin klein was coming for a meeting, i was pretty much allowed to wear the majority of my wardrobe. (ie: short day dresses) yesterday i wore a pink colored daydress, black cardigan, and black pointy flats. before i left andrea told me, ""this is extremely corperate dresscode. so, starting tomorrow, skirts no shorter than knee-length."" bummer. 

i started reading ""invisible monsters,"" another novel by Chuck PalaHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHniuk. In this one the first person narration is potrayed by a female supermodel. I think it's really great that C.P. can use that angle and still make his writing so gripping. as always, he gets in the reader's head, regardless of gender. 

back to work."

my internal clock is set to 6:48 a.m. on the dot. even on my days off, it's 6:48 a.m. not a minute before, not a minute after. how strange is that. monday night after work i met up with my stepdad and his friend, whom i'm pretty sure is retarded. for serious, straight up retarded. i really enjoyed the russell young section of the gallery, since i've been a fan of for some time. the gallery didn't consist of a lot of his photography, which is amazing; it consisted mostly of his blown up potraits of icons. they're pretty great. there were mugs shots of Jane Fonda, Sid Vicious, Steve McQueen, Frank Sinatra, Martin Luther King, Charles Manson, Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison, Snoop Dog, and James Dean. 

Last night Eddie picked me up from the trainstation, and we rented Borat. it was hysterical, and somewhat offensive. The open approach of expressing opinons towards the gay community was a little too bizarre. I find it so strange that my horoscope yesterday was so true. and the thing with horoscopes being true; is that is always the next day that you look back and say, ""wow, that couldn't have been more of a bullseye."" I guess that's what it takes to make the connection. My friend Erin from back in Philadelphia signed me up for horoscopes. I get about 13 emails a day, including dogoscopes. Awkward, right? I'm going shopping with Alyssa and Kathleen later. They'll have good outlooks on this situation. 

So, since I am up early, and once you drink as much coffee as I do; there's no turning back. My ideal day off consisted of sleeping until real late, playing video games, and smelling like crap until 9pm. Alas, my eyes are forced open by routine. I guess i'm going to have to do something productive today, aren't I? I created an account for an art blog, but I am yet to do anything with it. I need to do that. I have an interview for a paid summer internship on friday afternoon, and i'm nervous. I need to clean my room, I need to do still lifes; i cannot believe i haven't even finished those yet. I'm so mad at myself, but what can i do? I'm never awake and home for more than an hour. I look really scary. i've developed this really awkward shade of black & purple around a two inch perimeter around my eyes. I need sleep. That should be the first thing on my to-do list. neeeeeed holga camera film. oh god, i've become a zombie.

today at 1800flowers they made me do the billboard outside. for serious, that shit is so much harder than it looks. it's not like you stand on a ladder; you use a suction cup on a pole. so, the billboard is supposed to read, ""Don't forget Mom- Sunday, May 13th."" I couldn't even get it done. 


So, when you all drive past 1800flowers on merrick road and see a big sign that only reads the words, ""GET MOM"" you can all blame your good pal, jen."

"event","it's wednesday, windy, in DUMBO brooklyn. monday at stark was a monday. i was cranky, rained on, dizzy, and tired. regardless, i love it there. i'm so lucky to be there. this week is pretty much taken care of. stark design is my first priority. it's not until i confirm my schedule for the week there, that i set my hours for the gallery in brooklyn. this week is slow so i don't have to be there until monday. alas, here i am. i have work at jenbekma', the gallery, in brooklyn. yesterday, today, and tomorrow. i'm supposed to put in 2-3 days a week. i made that commitment before i started working full time at stark and started working part time all weekends. today, i let my friend elizabeth cut my hair while we were supposed to be working. we didn't get caught in the process, and   we cleaned up any trace of evidence. however, then i walked out of the backroom with noticeably shorter hair. the gallery is so chill, i don't even think anyone cared. seriously, i do inventory sometimes, answer questions about the pieces, walk down the block to pick up everyone's lunch, and answer the phone occassionally. well, then again, they aren't paying me. it's time to find a paying summer internship.

yesterday and today were good. i'm always relaxed on days i work at the gallery. i don't rush, i come home pretty early, and now that i have a room again, i'm able to do whatever i please art-wise. i still need to get a move on with the potraits, still lifes, and landscapes. i'll say it again. i dread landscapes. it's so boring. i started a marie-antoinette potrait. i'm not sure if i'll add that to the 4-6 new pieces. my art teacher from BOCES, Rae, called me and asked me to do the upcoming alumni gallery. Brigid's participating so i might. if i do, i'll use the potrait for that.

it's friday at stark design. Julia is on her lunch break, and Mr. Stark is at a meeting. I have seriously no work to do. I have been slaying my ass off with the prints for the last two weeks. This week has been so different. Well, besides the fact that Stark design owns the majority of my week. I guess things have been taking turns for the best in a long term sense. Somedays I decide I'd rather walk a few miles than take the subway. Tuesday was one of those days. I acted on Impulse and the outcome was good. On Wednesday I was sent on a specific errand to deliver old prints and pick up new ones from Patrick McMullan, the one whom we are publishing the new photography book for. I had met him breifly, last tuesday when i was sent on an errand to his office. He was older than I had expected, given the nocturnal life he lives. However, on Wednesday I was sent to his apartment. His assistant asked if i had wanted to meet him so of course i was delighted to. It was unreal. His walls were paintings; framed pictures hung up of him and Andy Warhol in the process of painting his apartment. He told me that he couldn't bare to move out considering Andy helped him painted. After introducing myself, He poured me tea, sat me down, and offered to show me some of his earlier work, then after finding out i was nineteen, showed me pictures of his nineteen year old son. He wore snoopy pajamas, had a bunk bed that he built, books stacked all over, and coo-coo-clocks; lots of coo-coo-clocks. I had so many questions. He only had about 10 minutes. However, he asked if i'd like to come with him to shoot photos within the next two weeks and assist him. I'm more than physced. 

My room is finished, and green. I have my drawing desk back. The new works are going alrght. I don't have a lot of time to work; especially the nights that i work for Justin as an artist's assistant after i get out of stark. Since I now work at Stark full time, I told Justin I could come in for an hour every day after I get out a six. Unfortunately, some days, most days, I am too tired. I have a lot of pieces to get working on pronto. Landscapes, Potraits, and Still Lifes, strictly from observation. 4-6 to be precise; for that same job. I hate doing landscapes. The new sketchbook is mostly used on the train. I usually read on the way there, and draw on the way home. It's a good process because it's persistant. I never used to finish books because I'd get distracted, not to sound illiterate. 

I miss my friends. yesterday i got out extra early, around four. So I got to see kathleen, mike d, and adam. I made a deal with the devil, and finally found a way to pay the budget. The check was overnighted last night, and my transcripts are finally going to be sent out. I am only praying to god it is not too late. I have struggled and fought too hard for this to be taken from me. Securing my future has been such a drag; you know, this whole two internships/one artist's assistant job for no pay, totally teeth clinching. I'm working on weekends just to afford my train tickets. Fortunately, I've been doing so good at Stark Design, Mr. Stark is going to start paying for my train tickets weekly as of Monday. I'm going to go out for a ciggarette break. 

Bon weekend!"

<b>MONDAY:</b>
it's monday, 10a.m. at stark design. i've been up since six, walked 4 miles, and brought muffins for my boss, and for julia. julia's ipod is broken. it's new, and she's yelling her little german ass off, cussin' in german n' shit. this week is going to be productive. i still haven't done anything about the balance to the art institute and my transcripts. i hope it's not too late. going to college was kind of the ideal plan for the fall. kristina has my cellphone, i hope that doesn't hurt my agenda too badly. i have to create an actual website for the gallery so i can blog, but why? i guess it should be fun, or interesting, and different. my room is being painted green. i chose the color. i'm not going to put anything back in. i don't really care for anything other than a desk to draw on, and a bed to sleep in. my mom snores; i don't know how much longer i can share ai overheard my stepdad telling someone that after the divorce is finalized, he might be keeping the house so he can spend the summers on long island. i wonder if he is going to keep my room."

"event","<center> ""is new york city really like a graveyard?"" they all ask me. I say, ""well it was last week. but, man, that was in the past."" see, i stopped going to the places where the people act so nasty and pretentious 'cause i'm happy sitting with my friends on sidewalk singing songs. and some people are still standing in the way of where i'm going. so i say ""please excuse me, step aside, or keep on moving."" and i guess they sensed that my momentum meant that i was winning, but i'm only just beginning  and i'd rather go with friends than go alone."

"event","<center>yesterday was my SVA interview. my portfolio was accepted once again only with higher standing than last year! they said with a 3.0 gpa i shouldn't have any trouble getting in. the last obstacle i need to overcome is getting the guts to call up my uncle and ask him to loan me 8,000 dollars. [dear dignity, i'm going to miss you. we had a good run.] one of my loans didn't go through. the art institute is refusing to send out my transcripts until i come up with the cash. no transcipts, no tranfering, means no college. i was almost ready to give up.

today i recieved a phonecall while i was hangin' with anglin from Daniel Stark of Stark design. he informed me that i got the job for the photography book publishing internship; my top choice internship! i start tuesday and i'm so physced! 

I'm doing good things; my house is being repainted. there's boxes everywhere, i no longer have a bedroom. since i don't have any room to make art pieces, doing some photography in the meantime will probably help keep me sane. i learned a lot and became even more intriqued, being that my roommate is a photographer. i just got back from eddie's. i went over there to borrow his holgaroid. we tested it out and took some triple exposures and he showed me a few good techniques. afterwards, we made a trip to ACMoore. it looks like i'll be able to get started on that french sketchbook. thankgod, the ideas were practically spewing from my brains! wow, so long island, go figure."

"event","<center>i just watched the movie, ""Winter Passing"" and saw myself in six years; and also my present self for the most part. it made me depressed, humored, terrified that it really doesn't get better, and hopeful all at once. look me up in six years and i'll let you know if it ends up that way."

on friday night i was the most wasted girl in Philadelphia. i proved a lot to myself, and felt a lot. I also told someone at a party that i had down sindrom. now, i am the most indifferent girl on Long Island."

"event","<center> I am really going to miss Philadelphia, and of my beautiful, unique friends i've made. I've assured them all i'll be back to visit all the time. It's starting to sound like a broken record. I don't think i'm going to even have a chance to visit any time soon, let alone breathe. Tomorrow I have my English Composition final. Afterwards, an interview with a representative from Hartford. I'm pretty anxious, and curious as to what it's going to consist of. Thursday's my last class until the Fall. I'm getting so fucking wasted, i'm not even going to write about it! On Friday Sashi is coming here and i am going to still be wasted and unshowered. By Sunday i'll be packed, moved out, and driving home with Sashi! Monday I have an interview for a publishing book design internship. It's one of my top choice internships. It's for a photography book. The hours are long, strenious, and unpaid. But, i'd learn a lot and i'd get credit in the book. If i end up landing the part time job, then I should be starting Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays. Thursday is my personal interview with SVA. i'm nervous, anxious, content, and apathetic all at once. I'm not quite sure how that's possible. 

Right now i'm making my digital portfolio into slides on power point. Alyssa helped me take pictures from my portfolio on Friday after my job interview. It took a lot longer than i thought. I re-looked over the portfolio requirements. There were a lot. Basically, I'm not going to sleep tonight. I'm working on my power-point. Fuck life 05'! My Life Drawing teacher tore me a new asshole in the Critique today. My final grade is a C-. I was on the verge of tears infront of him. I understand that Art School is Critical and i'm going to have to get used to it; but god fucking damnit, he was so mean! Oh, and getting the highschool, this school, and BOCES to send out my transcripts is the biggest pain of them all. Guh!

So, When I first moved to Philadelphia, it's almost like I was running. Then, When I was completely and utterly alone, the majority of the things i did were all for my Stepdad. I'm still not quite sure if I was trying to prove him wrong or make him proud. I'm going to go with ""A little bit of both."" Then, Finally, The internship, the job, the transfering schools, and the temperary move back home; I did it all for me. I did it to create a name and a life for myself. To get my foot in the door. I'm on the LIRR last night coming back to Philly, and he calls me and tells me ""We miss you already. You've been making so many good choices recently. I'm so proud of you."" I told him, ""I'm a work in progress."" 

If i find time; I'd really like to go camera shopping, and get started on my French Sketchbook. Oh, and i got to see Jasper Johns' Gallery today. I'm going to take pictures of it on Thursday. He really makes me want to try sculpture.

My rant is done. Oh, and I'm 19 now. Booya!"

tyler durden stated in fight club that it's only once you lose everything that you are free to do anything. that's true. i also found that once i stopped doing everything to please others and started doing things for myself; that's when things really start falling into place."

lately, i have been going absolutely crazy. seriously, i've become a maniac. growing up, i always thought it was black and white. ""she's crazy."" ""he's mentally ill."" however, now, i can honestly say, i know that ""crazy"" is much more complicated. the deprivation of sleep, the all-night partying binges, the hysterics, the drunk-dialing, the confessions, the ups, the downs; sometimes, i will lift up my shirt infront of the mirror and it seems the more i eat, the thinner i get. other times, i feel like i'm hybernating and sloth-like. it's gross. that doesn't make sense! sometimes, i feel great. i want to create and never stop, other times i want to die and i'm not afraid to. the quitting, the un-quitting, it's all crazy. i'm crazy. and i'm dragging you all down with me. next sunday, i am going to be nineteen years old. i am hoping i will be on long island with my best friends for st. patty's day and my birthday the following day. my stepdad doesn't want me home. things in general are crazy. i'm applying to three schools, i'm getting an internship, and i'm possibly going to be transfering to school in fort lauderdale on april first. things are so up in the air! 

on a completely different note. i have a new favorite artist/illustrator. i have been thinking of brooding a series of paintings and exploring different languages. Latin & French were the two I was going to emphasize on. So, i went to a small, underground exhibit downtown near south street and saw some illustrations. they were humerous, and held some sort of meaning. i fell in love instantly and identified. the only problem was, there was no signiture on any, no artist editorial, no biography; nothing! when i finally found some writing about the artist, it was in french! maybe i am going crazy, but i think that's a token or sign! by ""it"" i mean the coincedence that i was contemplating doing pieces in french, and then i discovered this french illustrator! He is from Montreal and has done several Illustrative pieces on Caravaggio. Caravaggio is my favorite baroque 17th century painter! I did a research paper on him for art history last year! all i know, is i have been looking over all different kinds of work from this artist, and i feel earnestly moved and ultimately engrossed. I'm going to do some serious headwork. 

Today in english comp. i did an oral presentation on the Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs. I wore Blue's Brothers sunglasses. I'm going to ask my professor to write me a recommendation. I need to do my Painting assignment for tomorrow. Oh, and guys. My birthday is soon. Let's do something weird."

"event","<center>When you're young, your whole life is about the pursuit of fun, then you grow up and learn to be cautious; you could break a bone, or a heart. You look before you leap and sometimes you don't leap at all because there's not always someone there to catch you. And in life, there is no safety net. When did it stop being fun and start being scary?"

"event","<center> lately, it feels like i'm taking crazy pills. i'm doing tons of work, as i've said. i have great friends here, and of course, the best at home. there's one thing in the back of my mind. ""I DON'T WANT MY CARTOONS TO MOVE."" i hate anime. i'm not web-savy. then, why on earth am i in media arts and animation. i don't like feeling so ambivalent. i looked into switching my major to Illustration. afterall, that is my dream career, and also what i was going to go to SVA for. I thought about transfering to SVA. although, Manhattan really isn't the place for me. I've heard a lot of bad things about SVA as of recent, also. anyway, i looked into simply switching into Illustration here. an Illustration Major is offered at the Art Institute of Boston. Boston! Clean Air! Grass! White people! and most importantly, Illustration! i am beginning to apprehend that maybe i was so caught up in getting the hell out of my living situation, that i didn't sit back and breathe. I ran, faster than i thought i could. Well, here i go. I am going to transfer to the Art Institute of Boston, or SVA. wish me luck. oh, and dear friends, please push me to do this. i need to do this for me. 

Alright, now that i go that out."

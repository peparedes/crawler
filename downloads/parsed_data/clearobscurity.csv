"event","<b>Fandom:</b> None -- This is entirely original fiction. (Whoa.)
<b>Character(s):</b> A businessman and a random man on the street.
<b>Word Count:</b> 420
<b>Rating:</b> PG (mild language).
<b>Notes:</b> This was written during a warm-up exercise at writers' group. The idea was to take two random personality extremes pulled from a brainstorming flowchart, and in ten minutes, write a dialogue between the two individuals. The extremes I drew were ""paranoid"" and ""bad."" This is the resulting ficlet.

The suited gentleman sidled over to the agitated man balled up on the steps of the office building.

""What's going on, sir? You look like you've seen a ghost.""

""Ghost?! Where?"" the rabbitlike man yelped, looking about him nervously.

""Nowhere,"" the suit said incredulously. ""I just said you looked like you'd seen one.""

""Oh."" The other man swallowed. ""I don't think I did. But I might have. Stuff like that always seems to happen to me.""

""It does, huh?"" the businessman murmured as he felt in the inside pocket of his suit jacket for a cigarette.

""I have the worst luck ever,"" the other man pronounced as he wedged himself tightly into the corner of the doorjamb. ""Although <i>they</i> say it's the best.""

""They?"" the businessman cocked his head as he ignited the found cigarette with a small fart of flame from his lighter. ""Who's they?"" he inquired from the side of his mouth.

""I don't know,"" the lump of a man whispered hoarsely. ""They're probably with the government or something. But they know how lucky I am, and they want me to come work for them. They think I can help them win this war that's going on.""

The suit said nothing, just sucked in a lungful of smoke and released it in a rapidly expanding gray puff.

""You probably think I'm nuts, don't you,"" the other man whined. ""Everyone does.""

""No."" The businessman shook his head. ""I don't.""

""Really?"" the other man looked up from the doorway hopefully. ""Then you'll --""

""They're definitely after you,"" the businessman said decisively, cutting the other off mid-sentence. ""But I can't help you.""

""W-why not?"" The other man trembled as he tried to back even further into the doorway.

The suit crouched down uncomfortably close to the other man, who flinched at the proximity.

""Because I'm one of them,"" the businessman growled as he stabbed out his cigarette on the concrete step next to the man's hand. He grinned -- a leonine, predatory smile.

""No, no, NO!"" The other man whimpered, propelling himself away from the wall and jackrabbiting down the steps of the building. ""I won't let you get me!"" he screamed as he fled down the street away from the businessman.

The suit stood and dusted himself off, chuckling as he shook his head. Damn crazy people. They were nuts, all right, but they sure were fun to play with.</lj-cut>"

<b>Character(s):</b> Jayne, with mentions of other characters. Hints of Jayne/Kaylee, if you glance at it sideways.
<b>Word Count:</b> 440
<b>Rating:</b> PG (suggestive themes).
<b>Notes:</b> Written in one quick burst for <lj user=""bansidhe"">, who insisted that I needed to write Jayne!fic at some point. I hope you're happy, dear. It's even got a hint of Jayne/Kaylee for you. I am, however, horrified that Jayne suddenly spoke up in my head like that. I blame you for this. Posted unbeta-ed. I also don't speak Chinese, so my apologies for any errors in translation of the Chinese used in this ficlet.

He'd thought maybe once it could've, but the captain shot that idea down faster'n he would Patience on a bad day. Something about not messing with the crew, 'specially if that crew meant the mechanic.

Then the doc and his nutcase of a sister showed up, and any chance was all over.

Not like it was doin' her any good, neither. The doc wouldn't know how to use his gorram pecker if it was handed to him like one them fancy tools outta that <i>shiong mao niao</i> bag of his.

And Jayne wouldn't force a lady or nuthin', no sir. Even if he had to pay 'em, it was better when they wanted it.

So here he was, with what had to be the bluest balls in the whole <i>luh-suh</i> 'verse. A man had <u>needs</u>, gorramit.

And it wasn't like he was askin' for the moon. Or any moon, for that matter. He weren't interested in what Wash and Zoe had goin'. Sure, it'd be shiny to have someone around to keep him in clean socks and drawers, but he hadn't got no interest in all of that 'wife' <i>go-se</i>. He already had the most important woman in his life. And if they could figure out a way for a man to be wed to his gun, well, he and Vera would be at that altar like Reavers was on their tails.

Wouldn't solve his problem right now, though. He supposed there was prob'ly a way Vera could help him outta that'un, too, but he weren't too keen on risking it. He was kinda partial to pissin' upright. Not to mention, he liked 'em warm and moist, and Vera was kinda frigid when she wasn't blowing the hell outta someone.

...Gor<i>ram</i>it.

It weren't <u>fair</u>. Wash had Zoe, and he was more'n welcome to her. The cap'n had his too-small pants that left the womenfolk swooning. Mal could just <u>sit</u> there and wind up with a women ready to ride him against the nearest wall. And the doc, for all his pansy-assed ways, could belch right outta his nose if he felt like it, and still have females linin' up to fan the fumes away with their ti -- er, hair. Little Kaylee included.

But he, Jayne, a perfectly good-lookin' guy, with plenty'a muscles and the stamina to match 'em, well, he got nuthin'. It just weren't <u>right</u>.

All he wanted was a lil' bit.

Maybe he oughta start lookin' to Vera anyways. At least he knew she was well-oiled, since he took care of that himself. And he'd fired her enough times, after all. Y'know, returnin' favors and all that.

...It just weren't right, gorramit.

"event","More Milliways matters. I swear I'll get off of this track eventually. Of course, 'eventually' could be years down the line. :D

A post was made to <lj comm=""ways_back_room""> yesterday, asking about the feasibility of characters traveling into other characters' canons. Of course, there's nothing like a question of that nature for spawning a whole mess of meta discussions. Given Liz's existing plotlines, I've had plenty of reason to think about this particular topic, so I figured what the hey and wrote up the following. I've posted it in a series of comments to the post <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/community/ways_back_room/228253.html"">here</a>, but I've also decided to post it here, simply because this is my writing journal, and I can. Given that it took me several hours and nearly four single-spaced pages of Microsoft Word to write, I'm parading this puppy proudly.

The long and the short of it? <u><b>Canons <i>can blend</i> to some extent outside of the Milliways environs. However, it does not work for any mix of canons, and only under certain conditions.</b></u>

<lj-cut text=""1. People cannot move into other canons where their actions would disrupt future canons."">1) People cannot move into other canons where their actions would disrupt future canons. Example: Liz is from 1811. Peter is from 1996. If Peter were to go back in time with Liz, he would disrupt the course of history, and potentially fracture his own canon out of existence. Paradox. The universe explodes. Or something like that. Tom Riddle's involvement with Door doesn't fall under this, because it simply forms an alternate plot line for the character. If Tom Riddle does not become Voldemort, the Potterverse will still exist, simply under happier conditions. Harry may still have his scar, and Sirius may still die, but if those things happen, it won't be because of Voldemort. If Peter Pettigrew goes back to a time over one hundred years before his own birth, he could alter not just his own future by actions done there, but the future of the entire Potterverse through a butterfly effect. For the same reason, Door shouldn't be able to go back to the 1940s with Tom. To wit: going back in time equals BAD under any circumstances.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""2. It is possible to move forward in time, but only if it makes sense for the time-traveling character to be in the canon."">2) It is possible to move forward in time, but only if it makes sense for the time-traveling character to be in the canon. Liz could potentially move forward in time to Peter's 1996. She'd have a very difficult time doing it, as the world would be very different for her, but she could do it. It wouldn't change history. Of course, this is also possible because Peter-mun and I are playing our characters as real people in time. The Harry Potter books and <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> are simply an author's renderings of the events in their world. (And believe me, if Liz knew about <i>P&P</i>, she'd have a few things to say about it.) If Liz or Peter were being played as fictional characters, it wouldn't work, because you can't interfere with the plot of a book. It's written already. It's under Destiny's domain. If Liz were being played as having been ripped from the pages of <i>P&P</i>, as I think at least a few Milliways characters are doing, she couldn't advance into Peter's real world. If Peter were being played as a fictional character, and Liz real, she still couldn't advance. If both were fictional, she couldn't advance, because she'd be the creation of a different author than Peter. Unless Peter's author wrote her into Peter's canon, allowing her to move into that world, she's stuck in 1811 or Milliways. Milliways is exempt from these limitations, being outside of the space-time continuum of <i>any</i> canon, therefore people are able to meet regardless of their fictional/nonfictional status and year of origin.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""3. Even if a character has the technical ability to move into another's world, that doesn't imply that it's a good idea for extended periods."">3) Even if a character has the technical ability to move into another's world, that doesn't imply that it's a good idea for extended periods. Raph, for example (if I'm remembering correctly), has been to Diagon Alley for a day before. That's one thing. A brief visit is just that, a visit. It would not, however, make sense for Raph to remain in the wizarding world and live there permanently. There just aren't giant talking turtles in the Potterverse. It would be easier for Raph to blend in there, however, than, say, Glorfindel (the only elves in the Potterverse are house elves - Glorfindel's kind simply does not exist). People could possibly write it off as an experimental charm gone wrong. However, being that Raph has no magical ability, it would be damned difficult for him. Liz, on the other hand, could possibly manage it. She's a ""normal"" person, just from a different time. Given that she could make the adjustment in era, she could pass as a 20th century Muggle. Liz could potentially bring Ulfin forward into 1811, as he is from a prior time period, and Ulfin could probably learn the ways of the Regency period, and pass nicely. Bringing the Merlin from Ulfin's canon forward, however, not such a great idea. There is no magic in Elizabeth's 1811. The character could visit, but remaining would be problematic, as Merlin's activities would surely raise eyebrows.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""4. Some characters existed during the same times as other canon characters. This does not mean that they can go back in time to that period."">4) Some characters existed during the same times as other canon characters. This does not mean that they can go back in time to that period. For instance, Hob Gadling was certainly around during 1811, and in the same England as Liz. The Hob Gadling at Milliways, however, cannot decide to travel back to 1811 again should he get the urge to go be nostalgic. The Milliways Hob Gadling is post-Sandman canon, from the late 20th century. There is <i>already</i> a Hob Gadling in 1811. Two Hob Gadlings in one place equals Very Bad Indeed. Had Hob Gadling arrived at Milliways from 1811 as Liz did, he could certainly go back with her, tour Longbourn, and have tea with the Bennet family. But he didn't. This Hob Gadling already lived through Liz's time. The opportunity has passed.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""5. Some canons just are not compatible together, and even a visit should result in drastic changes within the visiting character while it is there."">5) Some canons just are not compatible together, and even a visit should result in drastic changes within the visiting character while it is there. These pretty much concern the various magic users. As mentioned, Glorfindel could not remain in the Potterverse, because Tolkien elves do not exist there. The only elves are house elves. Potterverse wizards/witches could visit Middle-Earth, but they would not be able to use magic while they were there. There are only five wizards in the LotR canon, and all are Maiar. There are no witches. Not only that, the culture clash between the two worlds would be so great, that it wouldn't be advisable for the characters to remain there, or even visit in the first place. Buffy and company could not move into the Potterverse, not even Willow. Willow's magic is very ritual-bound and Wicca-based, which is not compatible with the Potterverse magic at all. Wheel of Time characters could arguably move into another canon universe, but they'd make life extremely difficult for those living in that world, based on their unusual views. Given the nature of the True Source and the One Power, however, they may still be able to use <i>saidar</i> and <i>saidin</i>, if a reasonable explanation can be given that allows them to access that power. Willow could visit the WoT world, and get by, although she'd stick out like a sore thumb unless she learned the ways of the people there. There are Wise Women that use herbs for mystical purposes in WoT canon. Other magic users, however, could not function normally in the WoT world, as for most, magical power is inborn, and resides within the person. In the WoT world, magical power is drawn from an external source. And it has already been established within Milliways that the One Power and the other forms of magic are NOT the same. A character may be able to blend into a different canon, but that does not mean they will do so intact. If the canon doesn't have a way to support a character's powers or abilities, the character can't use them.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""6. Various Milliways characters are currently residing in the House of Arch, all from very different canonical backgrounds. This is really okay."">6) Various Milliways characters are currently residing in the House of Arch, all from very different canonical backgrounds. The House of Arch is decidedly <i>Neverwhere</i> canon. However, it's contained. In a sense, it has assumed the same qualities as Milliways. What happens in the House of Arch does not affect the rest of the <i>Neverwhere</i> canon. It stays within the House of Arch. The only other area it will affect is interactions within Milliways Bar. Characters living in the House of Arch cannot exit the House of Arch for London Below. They can only go between the House and Milliways. Also, if I recall correctly, all of the characters living in the House of Arch, including Door and Ingress themselves, are played as actual people, and not as though they were ripped from the book. Hence, the <i>Neverwhere</i> world would be accessible to people meeting the proper conditions for successful interaction there - namely, being an actual person, and not being in a position to cause disaster simply by being in the world (which none of them are, as the House of Arch is sealed off from the rest of the world, as already noted).</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""7. If a character is played as fictional, having been ripped from the pages of their book, they are bound to the events of that book."">7) If a character is played as fictional, having been ripped from the pages of their book, <i>they are bound to the events of that book</i>. While Liz's current actions are based upon the events of <i>P&P</i>, those very actions would make the events of <i>P&P</i> very much an alternate universe. In the book, Elizabeth Bennet is very much in love with Darcy, and is overjoyed at his second proposal. Liz at Milliways obviously is not. However, these alterations can occur because Liz is being played as though she were real. Obviously, Liz is a character from a book, created by Jane Austen - but that is not relevant to the game, other than her non-OC status allowing me to play her. As far as Milliways and its patrons are concerned, she is real. Even with the changes in the character that have occurred since her arrival at Milliways, if the bar were to give her a copy of <i>P&P</i> for her perusal, it would have the exact same plot as any copy a mun could pick up from the library, complete with the double wedding at the end. Liz does not come from the book. If she had, she would be bound to the events described therein, because her fate would have already been written. She may have fallen for Peter still, but she would also have fallen just as equally for Darcy, and there would be no question or discomfort regarding that engagement. In the book, Liz is thrilled to be marrying Darcy. That would not have changed. To wit: If a character is played as stepping from the book or movie into Milliways, that character's fate is already laid out for it. Whatever that character does at Milliways can't affect events in the character's canon. Even if alterations are displayed in the character, those alterations stay at Milliways. The author is God, and for fictional characters, predestination does exist. There's no avoiding it, much as it might be wished otherwise.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""8. A character's status as fictional is not determined by how other characters react to it."">8) A character's status as fictional is not determined by how other characters react to it. The character in question determines their own status. For instance, last night, Luke Skywalker walked into the bar. Jaws dropped, people stared, and various statements about Luke being another fictional character were made. Luke, however, is a real person to himself. He exists outside of <i>Star Wars</i>. It is entirely possible that another character already recognises, or will recognise, Liz's name as that of a character from <i>P&P</i>. However, should they mention it to her, she will tell them quite emphatically that she is a real person. They can believe her, or disbelieve her, but as long as she maintains that she is who she says she is, and is not someone pulled from the pages of a book, she is not the character from the book. Another character's reactions do not determine her status as a person. Only she can do that. If a character believes he or she is real, he or she is. One universe does not determine the nature of all others. All it means if another character believes a ""real"" character is fictional, is that the story of that character has somehow spread to the first character's world.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""9. The Endless are largely exempt from these restrictions, although there are exceptions."">9) The Endless are exempt from these restrictions, as by their nature, they are everywhere, in every place, in every time, regardless of canon or universe. ""Journeying through time"" for them simply means manifesting the appropriate aspect in that time or place. Time is fluid for them. Morpheus is restricted, because of his deceased status. He could potentially go back to the periods where he was the reigning Dream and affect matters (since he has done so already), but this has not been done or determined yet. There is a distinct possibility that he could not manage it, thanks to the Endless' fluid sense of time. There is absolutely no way he can go forward in time, or affect matters in the nine years between his death and his appearance at Milliways. There is already a Dream of the Endless, Daniel, for that time period. Two Dreams cannot coexist. Likewise, in Sandman canon, Despair was killed and replaced with an aspect of Desire. The current Despair has all of the memories of the former Despair, but is unable to manifest herself in the time of that first one, because it wasn't <i>her</i> who was there. All of the rest of the Endless can move freely, provided they hold to the rules of their positions. Even they, however, are subject to #10.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""10. A character cannot go back in their own canon and change events."">10) A character cannot go back in their own canon and change events. The only possible exception to this is Marty McFly with the DeLorean time machine, or a Potterverse character with a Time Turner. If a character does not have one of those particular means, that character is SOL. Even those who <i>can</i> go back into their own pasts, really shouldn't do so, because screwing with events in the past could very well lead to the altogether disappearance of the character. What good does changing events do, if they lead to the character never being created? And some things just should not be changed. Much as Peter would undoubtedly like to take back his decision to betray the Potters, he's stuck with it. There's already a Peter in the past making that decision. Outside of interacting with himself (which is really not kosher in time travel), there's no way for him to change it. Characters simply cannot influence their own pasts directly. It screws with nature, and nature doesn't like it. For fictional characters, this isn't so much of an issue, because they <i>can't</i> change their pasts, directly <i>or</i> indirectly. Their pasts have already been written in the book or movie they're from.</lj-cut>"

"event","Hokay. So. I haven't updated this thing in weeks. I'm well aware of that. This is not the time or the place to berate me for it. I'll be remedying it soon. 

I've taken up with a new RPG, <lj comm=""milliways_bar"">. I've actually been there for around a month now. I am insane enough to be juggling four characters. This is neither here nor there. What is important is that I've spent a lot of time around the joint, and have seen a lot go down. 

Based on our experiences with the game, three of us (<lj user=""clearobscurity"">, <lj user=""gehayi"">, and <lj user=""twintailmadb"">) have collaborated on a helpful list of rules for the wannabe RPer. These are based on Milliways experience, but are highly applicable to any form of RPG you want to try. Learn them, know them, love them. Your fellow players will thank you. At least, the three of us will.

And for those of you who are not currently playing at <lj comm=""milliways_bar"">, I feel I must ask: <i>why the heck not?</i> Get yourself over there now. It is teh crack, and you will&nbsp; be assimilated happily.

<b><u>Rules for RPers to Live By</u></b>

1) Your character is not you - you are not your character. If you feel that you are being picked on or victimised because your character is hated, quit the game now.

2) Relationships between characters do not equate to relationships between muns. Do not make presumptions. If a mun tells you OOC-ly to step off his or her metaphorical nuts, they do mean it. It would also be advisable to avoid that particular mun's characters in subsequent IC interactions.

3) No one here is obliged to coddle your ego. Deal with it.

4) You are not the star. No one is THE star. This is an ensemble show, like M.A.S.H. Everyone gets a turn in the spotlight. The story is the star.

5) The game is not a dating service. If you're only looking to get yourself off or feel romanced, try the Romance rooms on Yahoo! Chat. You will surely be able to find something suitable for the occasion. If you are entering your character with the sole intent of shipping or hooking up him/her with another unsuspecting character, you will find yourself sorely disappointed, as such people are just as boring as characters as they are in real life.

6) Arguing with the mods is not a great idea. Arguing with the mods publicly is a very bad idea. Trying to get everyone else in game to fight with the mods as well is downright stupid, and counterproductive to fun. You know- the reason we're here?

7) Do not spam the boards complaining about how no one wants to play with your character. All it does is make people less likely to march their puppets over to you, as no one wants to deal with a prima donna. If you want to play, and no one responds to your initial posts, haul your character's arse over to another post and comment. If you are not comfortable simply jumping in blind, ping other muns and discuss setting up a plotline. If asked nicely, and treated with respect, the vast majority will oblige. Do not expect such treatment, however. The other players' characters do not exist solely to serve as your personal playthings. You want that, go get some dolls, and make them interact.

8) Learn to spell. Learn grammar. Learn to punctuate and capitalise correctly. In a text game, how language is used will weigh heavily on how the character is seen. Do not bitch that this is not English class and that you don't want to bother. If you don't want to bother using the language correctly, leave the game and pray to be reincarnated as Paris Hilton or Britney Spears, who are blonde, thin and rich enough not to care when people note that they are abysmally stupid.

9) Be wary of choosing a virtually omnipotent character. Since Milliways is a cross-section of fandoms, most of the players play powerful protagonists and antagonists. If your character does not have limitations and problems and goals, as well as power, he is not going to be very entertaining.

10) Please know your character before you subject the rest of the cast to him or her. Know your character's canon, know your character's habits and mannerisms. Know your character's background, and have some understanding of how this background will affect your character's interactions. You don't have to write out a detailed explanation for every facet of your character (although you'll find it's infinitely easier to RP if you do), but at least have enough comprehension of your character's basic development that your character's actions MAKE SENSE. You are playing a canon character for a reason, that reason being because said canon character is fun and interesting. Nifty, if you will. If you change everything about said character - well, you've got an OC with a canon character's name. And not only is that not kosher, it's also probable cause for your eventual death by sporking.

11) You have a character. Congratulations. We'll throw you a parade, complete with ticker tape. Woohoo, you're special. No, we're not impressed. And why are we not impressed? Because having a character is not sufficient. You also need - listen carefully - a PLOT. What is a PLOT, you ask? A PLOT is your character's driving force. It's why your character is in this environment. It fuels your character's actions, and influences their interactions. Without a plot, your character, however nifty he or she might be, is going to be dull as dishwater, and is only going to make the game suck. Plots can usually be derived by combing your character's background for hot buttons that will affect the character, and expanding from there. (See above rule regarding character development.) This isn't to say that you need to have a full storyline plotted out for the character, or even know where the character is going ultimately. It just means that you need something to talk about. Have a backstory. Have IC friendships. Interact with other characters meaningfully. Even if you never have an actual storyline running, you can still add to the flow of the game with strong character interactions. If your character has no thoughts, drives, or alterations, it's not going to contribute much. A plot doesn't have to be anything elaborate. Just have something interesting for the character to talk about.

12)&nbsp; Actions have consequences.&nbsp; If you are unwilling to have Bad Things happen to your character, don't go running around maligning other characters.&nbsp; Remember, almost everyone is playing someone with great powers.&nbsp; With great powers come great consequences.&nbsp; Poking hot things is a good way to get burned.

<b>DISCLAIMER:</b> These aren't really ""rules"", just guidelines. There is no one way to successfully RP. We do not claim to be the RP experts. We've just been around the block, and seen a lot in our experiences. We don't claim to be exempt from these guidelines. Chances are we've broken one or two in the past. It happens. It's when it becomes chronic that it's a real problem. This list wasn't written with any specific RPer in mind. It is a generalisation of things we've witnessed during RP, from many quarters. If you think you see yourself reflected in the list, you're just recognising that you've been guilty of one of these things yourself. This list was not written with malicious intent. It was written to be honest. It's snarky, yes, but so are its authors. In the end, however, we're just trying to be helpful. Happy RPing.

""Ron, are you <i>mad</i>? You'll be killed!""

""You need time. It's the only way.""

Ron plucked a hair from Harry's head and dropped it in the vial. The potion inside blazed a brilliant red. Before Harry could stop him, Ron tipped the liquid down his throat, grimacing. A moment later, green eyes met green eyes as Harry looked at his best friend, now wearing Harry's own face.

""Now hurry,"" Ron said shakily. ""I've only got an hour, y'know.""

""Ron, <i>don't</i>,"" Harry rasped as his friend turned to leave.

Ron paused. ""Harry?""

""Yeah, mate?""

""Take him down.""

And Ron was gone."

Ron saw the green flashes across the battlefield, and raced over to where his father and brothers had stood.

""Percy!"" Ron exclaimed when he saw his brother. ""What happened?""

Percy smiled coldly.

""Hello, little brother. And goodbye.""

""What --""

<i>""AVADA KEDAVRA!""</i>

Ron slumped to the ground next to the twins and Arthur.

Percy calmly polished his glasses on his robes, ignoring the bodies at his feet. A shame, really, that they had betrayed their blood. Purebloods were scarce.

Percy replaced his glasses and collected his mask from the ground, before going back into the battle. Four down, four to go."

Ron slung the dormitory door closed with a bang, and threw himself onto his bed.

<i>""Ask me before someone else does -- ""</i>

<i>""Vare is Herm-own-ninny?""</i>

<i>""Viktor's just gone to get some drinks.""</i>

Hermione and Krum. Krum and Hermione. <b>Viktor.</b> Gods. She was calling him <b>Viktor</b> now.

Ron snatched up the figurine he'd purchased at the World Cup. He glared at the plastic Krum scowling up at him. <b>Viktor!</b>

Ron's vision blurred with tears as he clenched his hand around the figure and hurled it against the wall. A tiny arm broke free and bounced across the floor.

""Dodge that, <i>Vicky.</i>"""

"event","Mark Evans is NOT the Half Blood Prince.

Mark Evans is NOT Harry's long-lost relative.

Mark Evans is NOT related to Harry in any way.

Mark Evans is NOT even related to <i>Petunia</i> in any way.

Mark Evans is NOBODY.

The question won JKR's FAQ poll, and is answered on her webpage. Just go to the ""Poll"" section of the FAQ. She admits that Mark Evans is just someone she name-dropped to add depth to the world. He's just <i>there</i>. She's even said that she is kicking herself fiercely for naming him what she did, because of all of the rabid fangirling that's been going on regarding the kid. The fact is, people, Evans is a pretty damn common last name in the UK. Pretty damn common last name anywhere, actually. It's not inconceivable that several families might share the same last name and (gasp!) <i>not be related</i>. 

Personally, I think the nitpicking has gone too far. <i>Not everything has to mean something.</i> If you're looking closely enough, you can always make yourself see connections or evidence for something you believe. I've certainly done it plenty of times myself for English papers. Not everything is symbolic, though, and even if everything is, there's a damn good chance that the symbols you're seeing are rather different from the symbols the author intended. For crying out loud, <b>give it a rest</b>. I like theorizing as much as the next person, but when I find myself scraping the barrel for evidence, or splitting hairs over insignificant words to prove my claim, I step away and breathe. Stick to canon, folks. It's all there, and most likely <i>not</i> hidden behind layers of mystique and smokescreen. There's reading between the lines and then there's rewriting between the lines. Give over the rewriting. Chances are exceptionally good that the last two books are not going to prove your bizarre (but in your eyes ever-so-convincing) theory correct, and you'll be left scowling and puling about how JKR didn't know what she was doing. In short, you'll end up like the more psychotic Hr/D shippers who refuse to buy or read the final two books because JKR sunk their 'ship with regards to HBP and Book Seven. That's just stupid. Trust JKR. She'll come through in the end.

And if you MUST continue nitpicking the books and developing increasingly outlandish theories, <B>at least know what the bloody hell you're talking about</B>. I have left so many HP discussion communities over the past few weeks because of frustrations with individuals spouting off their ideas as the epitome of brilliance, without the slightest attention to acknowledged facts. To wit: Harry Potter is a half-blood. Tom Riddle/Voldemort is a half-blood. Tom Riddle/Voldemort has no magical brother (likely no Muggle brother, either), and is the last of his line. Neville Longbottom is a pureblood. PUREBLOOD. Lily Evans was Muggle-born. Deal with it. And dammit, much as I love the little buggers, Slytherins are mean, nasty, rotten little prats. They are not just misunderstood. Some may have redeeming qualities, but we haven't seen them. As a whole, they are not nice people. Draco Malfoy is not going to instantly renounce his ways and become a friend of Muggle-borns. That's not to say he could <i>never</i> be swayed, just that it's <i>extremely</i> unlikely. He's a spoiled, blowhardy, bigoted, bullyish git. So stop squeeing over Tom Felton and adjust to the idea. Snape ain't a nice guy, either, much as I adore Alan Rickman in the movie role. Furthermore, you do NOT have to be pureblooded to be Sorted into Slytherin. If the presence of Tom Riddle and Snape don't convince you, consider that Millicent Bulstrode is also a half-blood, along with Tracey Davis. (<a href=""http://www.fictionalley.org/harryandme/"">Check JKR's notebook if you don't believe me.</a>) If you can't resist the siren call of analysis and theory, at least do your research. Half-assed analyses aren't brilliant. They just suck.

But back to the primary purpose of this post. <i>Mark Evans is not the Half Blood Prince.</i> He's nothing. He won't be reappearing in the story. Stop turning him into the next Blaise Zabini. And stop complaining that JKR has dashed your hopes (random rabid fangirl on the BB, I'm looking at you). You've barely had a week with this little theory. If you were that caught up in it, it's your own damn fault. 

In the <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/community/m15m/2237.html"">immortal words of Cleolinda</a>, EVERYONE SIT DOWN AND SHUT THE GODDAMN HELL UP. If I hear one more person go off on a theorizing binge regarding Mark Evans, I shall disembowel that person with a spork. A dull and rusty spork. With rounded tips. Better yet, I'll use a spoon. A dull and rusty spoon. It'll hurt more. I promise."

""Mister Flint.""

Marcus Flint's shoulders twitched, the only sign that he had heard Remus. The burly Slytherin did not look up from the book he gingerly held.

""You are not in my NEWT-level Defense class. I would be very interested to know not only why you are in the Restricted Section, but how you obtained permission to be here.""

Flint turned to Remus, an impassive expression on his face. ""Snape gave me permission,"" he said flatly.

'Like stone, this one,' Remus thought. The ghost of a grin flickered across his lips as he realized his unintended pun. ""That does not answer the question of why you are here, <i>Mister</i> Flint. Researching a future career, perhaps?""

Flint stared coolly at Remus. ""If that were the case, <i>Professor</i>, I hardly think that I would share that openly.""

Remus knew he would be seeing this young man across the battlefield someday."

A delicate bluebird fluttered gracefully through the sky above Hogwarts, chirruping merrily.

<i>Bluebird, flying high, tell me what you sing?</i>

It paused its song and hovered in midair, listening intently to the mysterious voice. 

<i>If you could talk to me...?</i>

The little bird cocked its head to the side and gave an inquisitive chirp. 

<i>What news would you bring of voices in the sky?</i> 

It twittered in acquiescence and flapped its way over, opening its tiny beak to... 

<b>THWAP.</b> 

With a satisfied rustle, the Whomping Willow reordered its leaves and settled back into place. Blue feathers cascaded down. 

<i>Damn birds.</i>"

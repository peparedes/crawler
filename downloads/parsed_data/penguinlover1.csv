"event","oh my friggin god iam soooo pissed but now i am relieved!
ok here goes ok i was leaving my aunts house at 6 thirty this morning and 
 than my grandmother let the dog out without his leash and he ran away 
and i love him and i was like crying because we didnt get him back 
and then i got to the airport and they had already finished boarding cause 
rio (the dog) ran out and it took  like a half an hour until we gave up and left cause the airport was
an hour away and i cried the whole way to the airport because of rio! but anywho they already 
finished boarding but since i was so cute they let us on! hahaha lol
and then just as i was turning my phone off my aunt calls and says the police showed up with rio!
and i was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO happy!
and than we got to florida and i was all happy but of course...god hates me...so our luggage isnt there
and i have 2 suitcases full of stuff! 1 with clothes and jewelery and the other one had ALL of my purses
 in it and thats alot of purses (19 to be exact and not just cheap purses i left them at home i only brought my designer ones so thats alot of money down the drain) so i was so pissed at the airport i will never fly u.s. airlines again I always fly delta and our luggage is 
always fine so i learned my lesson! but now my dad showed up with my bags at my moms house! he said some delivery guy dropped them off on the front door of his house ? thats a little wierd! but as long as i have my purses  im fine!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ok and thats about is so cmmnt!

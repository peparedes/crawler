sometimes, maybe once a year, i will look at some of my first entries and read them just to see how i used to be.
the things i said, my friends, my general attitude was just so funny. some things were sad...the things i dealt with and complained about then seem so small now. 

my first love, who weighed heavy on my mind when i was 16, is still such a big part of my life. i wonder if that will ever change? 

i look at my livejournal friends, and most of the names have a line through them. it has been a while.
...they're no longer on livejournal, and chances are i don't speak to them anymore really. 

i used to use this thing to vent my frustrations. if i had nobody to talk to, and i was sad about that guy, i would write it all on here. 
as i get older, my complaints are more about bills, and my job, and supporting myself, not being ditched by a guy...or having a fight with a friend.

oh, life. you make me smile."

they let the guys do whatever they want...

"event","a crackhead came into my work the other day and ended up walking out with $50.00 that didn't belong to him. being scammed rules. having that $50.00 deducted out of my paycheck rules, too.
i'd go into detail, but it's confusing.

i had the best weekend i've had since i've lived here.
i have the day off tomorrow, then i begin my crazy ass week-before-christmas work schedule.
my grandma and cousin from puerto rico are coming up in 3 days.
and my dad and sister are coming up in a week.
then my birthday rolls around a week after new years.
i really want to go to new hampshire and visit everybody. it's been over a year already.
unfortunately, my managers are ridiculously strict about taking time off. i'm going to try to get a week off soon, though. 
once the holidays have passed, i'll make a trip to orlando for a night or two. woop woop.

i'm pretty happy."

"event","i'm friendsick.


i'm trying to push forward. i can't fall back into the comfort of living at 'home'. 
i see myself fulfilling small goals everyday. but it's hard to win anything without anybody cheering you on from the sidelines.

ps. does anybody have any great book recommendations? i'm running out of books to read, and i don't want to have to resort to shitty james patterson."

"event","my brother and his girlfriend are moving in with my mom and me. it's going to be interesting. i'm happy about it, though.

i have to get some tests and blood-work done to find out what's been going on for the last year.
i'm pretty anxious about the whole situation.
i'm pretty anxious. 
i want to know, but then again i really don't.

i read a lot lately. i work a lot. i draw a lot. all of this creativity just kind of poured out of me.
i'm going to start selling some art work, and build my portfolio up.

i had a good weekend for once.
and had a crazy hangover to remind me of it.
being social again is refreshing."

i have some other stuff...but it's not that great.
my mom volunteered me to do some artwork on the bedroom walls of 2 of her co-workers. and my sister wants me to draw some sketches for tattoos that her friends want. it's when people start demanding work that i lose motivation...and that is shitty."

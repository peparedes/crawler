<lj-cut text=""Screened for Yami""><b>[</b> Um. Mommy? Did something...kinda sorta just a little bit...happen last night? Because. Seto doesn't look good, and you're not home, and <font size=""1"">I called and checked with Yuugi's grandpa and Seto told me not to do that <small>and I wanted to send some of our guys out to find you but Seto said not to do it <sub>and he hasn't gotten like this in a long time but I reallly don't think this is good so</sub></small></font> if someone could please make this make sense for me, that would be cool? :X <b>]</b></lj-cut>

<b>Edit:</b> Oh yeah! XD! I completely forgot to tell you all I was coming back. *death* I should probably have done that, huh? Yeah, I flew back last night. I got here like three in the morning. And Seto was still awake because he's a zombie like that. Or a vampire~! =[ One day, we're going to come home to find Yami all mauled and covered in blood, and Seto with have these big pointy fangs, and then they'll turn me into a vampire too, and we can go flying all over the place. Cool, huh? XD

"event","I couldn't find a <i>lot</i> of pictures, but I did manage to find <i>some</i>. Hope they were what you were looking for. I arranged them chronologically, and my hand's in some of them, because I didn't feel like finding a scanner. XD

And. I know this is for Yami and stuff, but I thought you might like to see them too, Noa. <s>And please don't show them to Seto, because I don't want him to...nevermind.</s>

<lj-cut text=""Cut. Because. There are TONS of them. XD I looked EVERYWHERE."">These are the ones from when we were really little, and then at the orphanage. I think I'm five or so, in these, which makes Nii-sama ten.

Seto smiled a lot when he was little. :D

And here's some pictures I got from a tourist. I guess orphanages are like a big attraction now?

Then Gozaburo came. He had lots of people to take pictures of him when he donated money to the orphanage, and that's where I got these pictures.

I was kinda scared, but Nii-sama was really brave!

Here he is winning the game.

That was how we got adopted, of course. And. Now pictures from when we moved to the mansion. Some of them are captures from the security tapes, or the ones that didn't get destroyed, at least. I took some of them, too! :D

That was when we first got there. I was kinda scared again. <font face=""arial"">^_^;;</font>

And here's some I took of Seto studying. He studied a lot. =|

Then our adoptive father came in, and Seto wasn't happy. =/

<img src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v140/maskedwombat/Mokie/8f4e2f0c.jpg"" border=""1px"">

Actually, Seto wasn't happy a lot, while Gozaburo was around. >_> Er. Sorry. You probably wanted less...yeah.

A bit later, of course, Gozaburo and Nii-sama played another ""game."" But you know about that already. Here's some pictures of while that was going on.

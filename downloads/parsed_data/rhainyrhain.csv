"event","After logging onto FFXI to see what was going on, Gudan invited me to go exp'ing with him to duo/solo puddles. I started out a bit rusty with only 200 exp into 75. I haven't been in an experience party for a long long time; but, at least my macros where still around. It didn't really help out because I lost my routine using them. As time progressed, I got better and better and more fluid with my actions.

Later on in the night, Primetime came out and joined us in our party. After that, I hung around for about another hour before I logged out for the night.

I gained about 12k exp and am up around 12k buffer now (started out at 200'ish) :)"

Promyvion - Vahzl went off without a hitch the other day. We, DARF and WiW, have successfully completed it. The travel up to the spire went pretty smooth--just had the whole aggro problem, but that's to be expected with an alliance of 13 people.

The three NM bosses we're really easy except for that one that nearly caused us to wipe because of its AoE attacks.

Anyway, congrats all and good job. Glad to have had DARFs along with us to make this trip less of a hassle."

like the name implies, is often filled with hidden delights and talents that
might not be apparent from a surface knowledge of the person. The Surprising
Lover is rather like a geode--sometimes rough on the exterior, but filled with
beauty and wonder. The Surprising Lover is thus a gem to find, though it can
sometimes be difficult to do so because they often tend to be humble and
unwilling to reveal their inner greatness unless they're in a rewarding
relationship. </span><br>

<span class=""maincolumn"">In terms of physical love, the Surprising Lover really

bed.</span><br>

"event","Alright! We just defeated Ouryu!

The battle was really fun. Rae and I had to coordinate our attacks to ensure that we inflict as much damage as possible at once so that we can put him back to sleep right after. Also, since Freeze takes forever to cast, we have make sure that they go off at the same time--we used the game clock to coordinate.

Everyone has done an amazing job to make this battle go as smooth as possible albeit having problems for the couple tries. But on our third and final round, it made it look like a piece of cake. Good job everyone!

I managed to capture 2.75 GB worth of screenshots & videos during the whole thing. Except for the last bit because I ran out of hard drive space :/. Which really isn't so bad because I don't really care about recording the cut scenes--the battle was my main concern. However, I did miss out on the group shot in the end (oh, and the AWESOME part where all the wyrms are flying away,) so if one of you guys can send me one so that I can include it in our photo gallery and my next movie, I'd appreciate it :).

This fight was easier than I actually imagined. I heard a lot of horror stories about this battle, but with a team like WiW going at it, it seemed really easy. We all died on our first attempt; but, on our second attempt, Noxx was the only one that got killed. But no worries, she re-raised and we were all back at it full throttle and totally annihilated the Big D.

We even made a nice new t-shirt for Diabolos to wear around and show his other buddies what'll be coming their way..

Overall it was awesome, except for Saturday because it rained pretty hard; however, that did not put a dampen on our spirits at all because luckily, we put up a makeshift shanty on top of our picnic table and played cards all day and drank booze--friends taught me how to play Euchre! Our tarp rocked! One of our neighbors had like this $50 kitchen tent that collapsed! But our $5 tarp did not! Here's a quick pic:

Going to do a whole bunch of drinking, playing around with the fire (they call me a pyromaniac, but I'm really not ;)), and just have a good time.

I'll be working.

After I get my dead car back, with its brand new tires that I bought before it died.

I'll be working to pullout of the $350 I just sunk into my fucking car right before the Week of Chaos.

Fuck you, Tire Kingdom. You're not allowed to touch my car ever again. Every time one of your guys touched my car, something else broke, and I can't prove that you did it. Everything was running perfectly when I pulled in for an oil change and decided to replace my bald, worn tires while I was at it. Then I pull out of the parking lot, and the higher gears are revving high and whining at me. Pull back in, the guy looks at it, takes it for a short drive and starts POUNDING on the clutch, and by the time he's done with it, it won't move. What the fuck, you freak. And he's acting like it had been doing that all along, like it had nothing to dow ith the rough abuse he had just put that clutch through. The last time that clutch had been stomped on and sprung up like that (my foot slipped, it was an accident), the damn thing broke on me, and I had to get it replaced. That was about 4 months ago. Now he does it again, and whaddaya know, the same fucking thing happened again. By the time the tow truck got there, the clutch pedal wouldn't depress all the way and my car wouldn't start. FUCK YOU TIRE KINGDOM."

"event","I work at Papa John's now, a traitor to Domino's. Gasp. .. Whatever, Papa pays better. :o

I'm getting fed up with certain people, but then I find something else to do and they don't matter anymore. 

People at work are fun, <b>Eric</b> trained me and actually split tips with me, which was awesome. He also had classical music on because he thought I'd have something against Aphex Twin. Pffft. <b>Dustin</b> is a nut, and flirts a lot. but that's okay because he's adorable and funny. <b>Joel</b> is a bossy little brat at times, but he's friendly enough when he's not hassling me because I'm the new girl. I thought <b>Bridget</b> might not like me and would therefore be kinda bitchy, but she's been friendly on the few occasions we talked, so maybe it's not so bad. Althought I'm still getting a vibe that I'm somehow stepping on her toes just by being there. Not my problem >.> <b>Elizabeth</b> turns out to be someone I knew from way back when, back in the days of riding the school bus. She's also a bit of a freak, in a way I'm all too familiar with, and it kinda suits her age. You know, the whole ""Bwahaha, I can shock you by claiming to be into S&M and I'm cool because I know goth stuff"" .... Yeah, I remember those days, those people.

I'm starting to see more and more personalities and such that are almost echoes of people that I used to know, or mentalities that I've seen in various stages of my own life. Dustin is almost exactly like I was in middle school, except he's extroverted where I was introverted. Elizabeth reminds me of so many of the people I knew in the early days of High School, except where they were years ago, she is now. I wonder if it has something to do with the social environment of that area, because that is where I used to live, in those days.

I need to get back to school and figure out what to do. my mom has offered to pay for my college, and buy me a new computer, but it's up to me to do the shopping. I'm afraid she'd be kinda surprised at how expensive it all is, and I hesitate to put her in that kind of burdened position. It's not that I don't want to go to school, it's just that I don't want to go riding on someone else's money, even if it is my mother. Especially becuse it's my mother. I still don't know what I want to go back for, even though i have several ideas.

<b>Psychology.</b> People fascinate me, the way they act, think, and behave in relation to their surroundings and each other. But most people who've taken a few psych classes annoy the shit out of me because they assume to know the underlying motivations and childhoods of people they've met for all of five minutes, and won't be convinced otherwise. I hope I never become like that.

<b>Illustration.</b> Sadly, I think the fun is gon out of art. I know I'm good at it, and if I stop it's skill that's wasted, but without motivation, drive, vision, I'm just going through the motions, and it feels empty and unfulfilling. On the rare occasion I -am- driven, I'm very proud of my own work, but it's just so rare. Still, with a little grunt work and forcing myself to pick up a damn pencil, I could be good at it...

<b>Animation.</b> Just because I'm halfway to an Associate's degree in that already..

<b>Architecture.</b> It combines my skill in drawing with the way I kinda naturally understand geometry and math. It's solid and would come naturally to me, and I could get good at it with little effort or frustration. It's not really a fascination, but it's easy.

This is stretching it, but <b>Scuba Diving.</b> because I fell in love with it, and found a school that trains people for careers in that. I mean, it's not much as far as normal living, sticking with what's known, but.. I really loved it under the water, for the little bit I got to go see. 

Mmm. fun.

the library computer will now reboot in 10 minutes, so I need to be going.

Particularly about a week ago, when I randomly ran into Casim and Jen, Vance's best friend and his girlfriend. Jen instantly wanted to talk about hating Vance, which i personally have run my course of, so i dunno. I had nothing but stale shit to say about that, and we moved on to happier topics. Casim didn't remember me being ""tall like an amazon"" (What?) and yeah.. Fun times. <3

And then Friday. That got interesting. By the way, Casim and Jen?

That was lame.

So, I have a bit of a dilemma.

Here are the three jobs: I want to choose two to keep.

<b>J. Christopher's:</b>
~~~  Pro
-after one night at Rusty Pelica, it's relaxing.
-I've been there since it began, so I'm familiar.
-Friendly environment
-Out of there by 2:30-3:00 so easy to work around other jobs.
~~~  Con
-Julie (She's a bitch who inexplicably doesn't like me, but she's just a damn child :P Who cares.)
-Not making much money at all, yet.
-Early mornings.
~~~  Just the facts
-2.13 an hour as a server, plus tips. It's a new place just taking off, so he can't afford to pay more than minimum wage. 
-The place opens at 7, closes at 2. 
-It's a quaint breakfast/brunch restaurant that caters to yuppies, health-food nuts, and little old ladies. 
-I work one or two weekdays, and saturday/sunday, about 20 hours a week.

<b>Publix:</b>
~~~  Pro
-Walking distance
-Benefits, room for advancement even at a part time status, tuition reimbursement if I stay long-term.
-BAKERY. No cashier/floor hassle of retail.
-Easy. Do what's needed, no running around like in restaurant business.
-Never make less than 7.00 an hour
-CANNOT co-ordinate schedule with Rusty Pelican, only J. Christopher's
~~~  Con
-Never make -more- than 8.00 an hour (premium pay on Sundays and holidays)
-It's fuckin' retail.
~~~  Just the facts
-Schedule is your typical part-time job flexible schedule.
-25-30 hours a week
-7.00 an hour, 8.00 an hour on Sundays and holidays

<b>Rusty Pelican:</b>
~~~  Pro
-Friendly, active environment
-Pays good with tip-out
-Consistent schedule
-They -like- me
~~~  Con
-Far away (I have no car) and rides are finicky..
-Where have my weekends gone??!
-Very labor-intensive, particularly when it's busy (I'm SORE but they say I'll get used to it)
-CANNOT coordinate with Publix, only J. Christopher's
~~~  Just the facts
-4.25 (Or was it 4.50?) an hour, plus tip-out. I've heard that, particularly when working alone, it can be about $50 in a busy night.
-Friday-Saturday-Sunday-Monday, 4-Close, so about 30-ish hours a week?


So, J. Christopher's is the only place that I can keep no matter which other job I choose to keep. It's fairly stressful when busy, but I can handle it -easily-, and the hours are short. A small task for a little extra spending money when I'm not working at another job. I need to decide between Publix and Rusty Pelican.

Rusty Pelican means I'll be tired a lot more, and be working MY ASS OFF over the weekends, but I'll come out of it with a fat wad of cash. And despite the law, no one ever claims their tips. ""Oh hey, someone handed me a 20. Here, Mr. Government, take a percentage."" It'll be two restaurant jobs that pay a very small hourly wage, and variable pay depending on the tips. Rusty Pelican is pretty swanky, so there's a lot of cash flow. That place apparently goes through a lot of bussers (that's what I am) because of the workload, I guess? And they desperately need me there.

Publix already had me scheduled and I'm already missing work. I said I'd call the guy and let him know if I'm not going to stay, and said I'd come in and work on Wednesday. It's retail. It's big, chain, retail. Lots of benefits, particularly in long-term. If I were to -stay- at a job, Publix would be the one. That's something I could be consistent about if only for the benefits, you know? I can walk there to work, and it would likely be more mind-numbing and unchallenging, but it'd make the money. Rusty Pelican I may stay through some busy weeks, months, a season or so, and I may leave after that. Who knows. It's far away.

On the other hand, if the money is just -that- good, and I get a car, I could work at Rusty Pelican consistently, alone. But.. That's a little far-fetched.

I need to give the guy at Publix and answer by Monday, and know where I'm staying by then. Any suggestions? Advice? I can't decide.."

"event","Step One

Make a post (public, friendslocked, filtered...whatever you're comfortable with) to your LJ. The post should contain your list of 10 holiday wishes. The wishes can be anything at all, from simple and fandom-related (""I'd love a Snape/Hermione icon that's just for me"") to medium (""I wish for _____ on DVD"") to really big (""All I want for Christmas is a new car/computer/house/TV."") The important thing is, make sure these wishes are things you really, truly want.

If you wish for real life things (not fics or icons), make sure you include some sort of contact info in your post, whether it's your address or just your email address where Santa (or one of his elves) could get in touch with you.

Also, make sure you post some version of these guidelines in your LJ, or link to this post (it'll be public) so that the holiday joy will spread.

Step Two

Surf around your friendslist (or friendsfriends, or just random journals) to see who has posted their list. And now here's the important part:

If you see a wish you can grant, and it's in your heart to do so, make someone's wish come true. Sometimes someone's trash is another's treasure, and if you have a leather jacket you don't want or a gift certificate you won't use--or even know where you could get someone's dream purebred Basset Hound for free--do it.

You needn't spend money on these wishes unless you want to. The point isn't to put people out, it's to provide everyone a chance to be someone else's holiday elf--to spread the joy. Gifts can be made anonymously or not--it's your call.

There are no rules with this project, no guarantees, and no strings attached. Just...wish, and it might come true. Give, and you might receive. And you'll have the joy of knowing you made someone's holiday special.

My List! *sits on Santa's lap*
1. A <a href=""http://www.scarygoround.com/shop-tshirts.php"">Talking Machine shirt</a> 
2. My kittycat, and a place of my own I could keep him. Small apartments are not good for sitting rowdy cats in. :(
3. A car, or road trip somewhere, to see new friends and possibly beat them up. >.> That last part doesn't count.
4. A better job so I can afford such things.
5. Someone to really look up to, who I can really talk to. A companion. Or, a 'Boyfriend' (That word sounds so High School o.o) if you will. One I can stand, and won't wind up making life hell like The Asshole.
6. Music. Music I've never heard and could possibly like. NEW NEW NEW
7. Plane tickets! I want to see the world, and not just Florida -> Taiwan
8. Scuba diving lessons, so I can get certified. ^_^
9. <a href=""http://www.scarygoround.com/shop-tshirts.php"">Robotania! In Communism Red!</a> 
10. A mafia hit. XD (On someone else!)"

"event","You know, I could indeed pour my thoughts out onto my LJ, and make for an interesting read instead of the sporadic update of cryptic drivel that might be entertaining, but usually only to people who know what it's about. Unfortunately these outpourings of brainstuff tend to happen person-to-person in IMs or talk, and I'm always too lazy to type them out here. Also, they wander all over the fucking place and are not the least bit coherent. I'll be the first to admit that, although individual thoughts have no problem making themselves quite plain and interesting in writing, none of it is cohesive. I'm not a very good writer beyond a blurb or two here and there. I might start putting some of my IM conversation logs on here, if only so I, personally, can look back at them and see what the hell I was thinking the other day, because yeah that was an interesting thought, too bad I forgot it.

I am also going to (probably) make the journal friends-only for that purpose, because a lot of this is gonna be personal and I know a few people who will a) misinterpret it, or b) use it against me, or c) both of the above.

Leave a comment to be added if you're not already. I tried to keep my friends list pretty slim, for readability, but that'll likely change and I'll start fiddling with the ""friends groups"" thing."

I'm likely going to have a job now. Nothing glamorous, more than likely waiting tables or something similar. It's at a place that's just opening up in a couple weeks. Orientation is Monday, woo. The place is small, so it'll be comfortable. If I need extra cash I can get another job (HEY VANCE, IT IS THAT EASY :o) <-- sorry, it's still funny -to me- :P

Been spending a lot of time at home (Trevor's) and.. doing my usual. Killin' time via internet until something more interesting happens like HALO. BECAUSE HALO IS FUN. Or an awesome halloween party (Last Saturday) at Bubba's. I think I'm pretty much finally out of my shell, for the most part. I didn't have to hang off Andrea's arm for security that night or anything. The alcohol probably helped, but I managed to mingle and have a FANTASTIC TIME on my own. Which was fortunate because then being a -little bit annoyed- at Christina didn't get me down. woot.

Also, I'm cool. Justin says so. This somehow involves me being invited to go to Green Parrot for karaoke last night, which was ALSO awesome. Except for stage fright. Strangely, though, I wasn't nervous or scared or anything, and the guys were really fun and supportive and stuff (I mean, hell, how else would they be?). However, I was visibly -shaking- to go up there and sing. I did fine, and had fun, but for some reason I kept -shaking- tot he point that I thought I was going to fall down. I don't care though! It was fun! I'll do it again in a heartbeat. :o Hooray, Becca's no longer a karaoke virgin XD

Denny's afterward was fun too, the waitress brought us Guess Who, and CANDYLAND. Fucking CANDYLAND! Bubba ate my pancakes, I stole his sausage, and some random guy passed me his phone number scribbled on a sweet-n-low packet. I was half tempted to keep it, but then Justin ate it. Yeah. put it in his mouth, chewed it up, and... spit it in a ditch! (Yes, I lied, he didn't EAT it.)

I think next time before I try Karaoke again, I should have a drink or two in me to LOOSEN THE HELL UP because I don't wanna be shaking again.

I just realized, my posts never make sense. Much. I post how I talk, and I babble. Also, I have no deep or profound thoughts associated with these events. .. Nope! :o

On the episode of Due South called ""Asylum"", There was a song I liked. The end credits said it was ""Boring Days"" by Race. I've been searching, and I managed to download a song called Put Up Your Dukes, by Race.. I like it, and now I'm trying to find -anything- else by Race. I really, really want to know more. The only other references I could find were -numerous- websites with guitar tabs (which are useless to me) and one site in French that just gives a synopsis of the album. http://www.bdd-mp3.com/a_a-527000_b-Race.htm ...

I rather just caught wind of <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/kyowai/27719.html"">this little beauty</a> here.

My response, since the coward cut off commenting from anyone who isn't kissing -his- ass after a couple people complained ;)


Angst angst angst. Even when things are going well, you still angst. Funny how I'd thought you'd have gotten over out little tiff of two years ago. Instead it seems to have twisted off somewhere in your mind to no longer have anything to do with the actual events, and adding on a sad little spin of your own. Funny how you say I'm 'keeping tabs' on you, when the worst moments bring just enough boredom to scroll through the short list of people who hate me's LJs. And.. You kept an eye on me and this friend, with an alt. Hmmm.

Which of course brings me on this little beauty. Reaction one: ""That's some fucked up shit to say about me."" Reaction two: "".. I can't believe he's still -holding- a grudge.. haha.."" And finally: ""*snort* Let 'im keep hating me.""

Of course for accuracy's sake, I have to make a few little corrections, and interject a few clarifications here and there. :3

Don't call me a slut and a bitch for having sex with you during a time when we were on -very good- terms, despite all differences, when you were more than willing, and then go bragging about having all the text-sex slaves you want. 

I have nothing to do with Fox/Dearc anymore, and -absolutely- nothing to do with his opinion of you, so don't pin his bullshit on me.

Furc's turned out a decent side income for me, in fact, using the artwork 'painted all over' my 'alts'(customers or friends, often).

What I ""did to you"" was not fall all over you like you thought I should, even after more and more you were becoming a pretentious, self-absorbed, ansty jerk. If I recall, the final straw was when i was sick of being the peacemaker whenever we had an argument and left it to you. For -once- you could have come to me and all would have been cool again, but you couldn't do it once, after the dozen-odd times I had. Of course, this is also now moot, along with whatever other accusations you're throwing around at me. You know why?

You don't know me. You have some kind of warped idea of who I was then, and you don't know m well enough to judge, accuse, or throw names around like this. You complain about ignorance at the same time you perpetuate your own. You call me a slut and brag about having more sex than ever. You say I'm keeping tabs on you, and you still spied on a conversation between me and this other friend? And why do you lose such respect for someone for actually having a good opinion of me, when this person -knows- me, and who I am now?

Still holding a bit of a grudge after all this time? I thought, in my idealistic sort of mind, you'd grown up by now and we could rather ignore each others' existence in peace without having to drag anyone's name through the mud. Let's try that now, please? :)

I went out tonight! YEAH. My mom's friend Jack took me out to <a href=""http://www.taiwanfun.com/north/taipei/nightlife/0404/0404Mos.htm"">MoS</a> tonight, where there was drinking and dancing and fabulous music. If they had a revolving dance floor, I would say it's better than Ampitheater. ACTUALLY it still is.

ANyways
Jack kept saying ""don't get drunk!"" and then buying me more drinks. ANd I was like, wtf. stop buying me drinks. cause I'm not gonna waste his money by not drinking them. bastard

and he was gettin me drunk and then he kept trying to get me to kiss him and i was all ew.. cause he has to be like 40+ years old even if he is very physically fit and young-looking, and he's like.. insane. Plus he kept making fun of my ASS being FAT before. :(

But you know. it was early and of course no one was dancing YET. because you know how people can be really chickensiht about being the first people on the dance floor looking like morons? Chinese people are even more awkward. But then Jack dragged me onto the dance floor and I was already pretty drunk so I just went with it. Did you know, that if you're durnk and falling over, and then catch yourself so you -don't- fall over.. it looks like you're dancing? haha. ANyways. Iw as a lot more coordinated than that thank you XD BUt it wa great. because I was doing really well, and we broke the ice so more people started dancing. Though still so chickenshit they had to be at the -edges- of the dance floor instead of in the middle where we were. Then Jack tried to grab me and make me kiss him again, and I think he got in trouble. i dont' know because i had to go to the bathroom then.

Dancing is fun. And I decided to get things MOVING ALONG so when I came backa nd couldn't find Jack I went ahead and kept dancing, and gestured at some fellas to come dance with me, so they'd leave the -edge- of the floor...

And on the way home Jack kept bitching about how I should 'protect myself' and I said I can do that, and he was like 'no you can't' and I'm like 'wtf, what'd I do wrong' and he said 'nothing' and I said 'how can you say that then' and he was all 'you need to protect yourself!' ... There were -various- circles runa round this subject, but I think he's just crazy and likes young girls so ew. :("

Thing with the school, REALLY OVERLY COMPLICATED now. Long story short, I don't think I have a fair chance of getting in. Even so, my mom wants me to register for this Chinese Language school, which would be a requirement if I got into Shih Chien.. Naturally if I'm attending college there I should learn to read and write Chinese, too. But if I don't get into Shih Chien, I don't want to go to the Language school because then a good 70% of my reason for coming here is gone, and what's the point when I'm otherwise fairly miserable?

Another realization is that my mom is offering a lot of opportunities for me to get my art well-known and out in the public eye, having the drawings put up in exhibitions and even asking me to do some paintings for a contemporary art museum... But NONE of these 'opportunities' is anything I really want to -do-. In fact, most of the art put up in shows only makes me embarrased, rather than proud. I'm not ready for exposure. I'm getting shoved into the public eye at my worst.

So I just want to go home now, and spend a couple years working off this debt that Vance has helped put me in, so I can start from even ground and really make my own life. I don't want her money anymore, I don't want her help, I no longer give a shit about the house. I want nothing to do with her. I realize this sounds a little drastic for dealing with a mother who genuinely thinks she's doing me a favor, but you <i>have no idea....</i>"

Found out what kind of virus she has on her laptop, although the desktop PC will need a re-installation of windows. NT is awful, by the way.

I'm at a net cafe right now, and from the looks of it, things aren't going ot be getting better any time quick. I'll be having to spend a lot of my effort recovering financially from the Vance disaster (because a disaster is what it is) and... Emotionally? I can't say I feel a damn thing other than contempt when I think of him, now. There's no justification for the things he did, no matter how much of a sad face or eloquent spin he puts on it.

Next step, go home to see if I can't fix the virus problem on my mom's computer. 

This... Environment.. Will take some adjusting to. God, I miss home. Minus Vance.

Minus Vance, of course, my life would have been fairly secure. A few good nights of work and a short plane ride away from most any of the poeple I would have wanted to see. Close to my friends.. And I would have been financially secure, even if not particularly well off, if it weren't for Vance.

What pisses me off beyond belief is that for all of the freeloading and using me he's done, for all of my resources that he's taken advantage of, for this financial gutter he's dragged me into, he's taken care of. He stands to inherit, after all this. Me? Well, I'll be dragging my -own- ass out of this hole he's put me in, while he throws himself a little party and has himself a nice vacation. Oh, -sure- he promised he'd pay me back, right? Just like he said he'd figure something out for his rent, just like he seemd to 'understand' when I told him that calling Cananda was expensive. No really, I hope it's -really- funny, because they'd be laughing at the expense of their own worth as respectable human beings. The financial shit he's gotten me into is only material, after all. Either way, it would be -nice- to have some of that money returned to me, but I honestly don't think he will. He hasn't got the sense of responsibility for it.

5 minutes left to go before I gotta run.

Not much left to say. I'm lonely here. :\ And I miss my friends."

"event","Remember last month, when I flipped out about the phone bill being $250? This was due to Vance making so many phone calls to Canada, which is not included in nationwide free long distance.

Now, I know I was roaming. i was expecting a high bill from roaming charges plus my calls made to Taiwan. Looking at the bill in detail, My half of the bill added up to $240, roughly. Ouch, but manageable. The -total- bill? Triple that, and add some. $751.54, motherfucker.

Vance made over five hundred FUCKING dollars in phone calls to some bitch in Canada. Doubtless, he'll be holding back on the money owed for that, as well.

HEY FUCKER. I TOLD YOU ABOUT THIS. HOW STUPID ARE YOU???!!!

By the way, thanks for making me as BROKE AS YOU. MOTHERFUCKER."

"event","Ugh.. Monday night my computer will be packed away and put into storage... I'll be heading out to Taiwan...

I wish I could stills tay here forever like this, chatting with my friends, scribbling up pictures, sitting on my lazy ass. Well, if I were staying I would even get a job.

I'm scared. I don't want to go. I want to run away and hide under someone's wing, rather than fly off to Taiwan and be under my mother's thumb.

Plus the plans for a career and college opportunity over there have managed to completely screw up, due to some mis-(LACK OF)-communication.

No worries. I'll be back sooner than expected before.

So this is going to be goodbye, for now."

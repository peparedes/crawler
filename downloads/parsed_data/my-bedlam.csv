"event","What, a journal update and so soon after the last scintillating one?  I know, you're in shock.

I just told my mom my hope for next year, that I want to quit school after the semester is done, skip out on Spring Term and go back to Europe... and I want her to come with me.  There's no class at school that really interests me, I have more than enough credits, and I'll be back in time for commencement.  I was considering going with one of the study abroad classes, particularly this one in Ireland on Yeats and Modern Irish history with two really good professors... but everything within me cringes paying 3000 for 2-3 weeks and only seeing one country.  

But I want to go back to Europe so bad!  And I want to share it with my family.  When I told her, she didn't say no.  She said she'd think about it.  I think she might be interested.  I want this memory.  I want to see her face when she goes to St. Peter's Cathedral.  I want her to exclaim over the beautiful glass on Morano Island.  I want to wander around the gardens of Versailles with her.  I want to go hiking in the Alps with her. I her to see where I lived in Louven.     

Well, I have a year to work on her.  I think I have pretty good odds.  So please pray my brother gets lots of financial aid from UK, that I am able to pay off Hanover completely and totally and not go in debt in my last year, that I get lots of financial aid from whatever grad school I go to, that nothing untoward happens (accidents, house problems) to suck away money and make it impossible."

You know you're jealous.

And the best part is, since I got my residency card today, I'll be going there legal!  (As opposed to the earlier proposal of going to London and praying to God that officials didn't check my visa, and if they did, didn't notice that technically I'm not supposed to leave the Schengan states.)  I heart the nice guy at city hall who saw me, motioned me over (basically letting me cut in front of 20 people) and gave me my residency card then and there, no hassle.  About damn time.  So now I'm a legal resident of Belgium... for the next 24 days.  Because in 24 days I come home!"

"event","So this is a topic I've been pondering most of the semester.  As my friends here know, one of my good friends at Hanover got engaged in October to her boyfriend of two years.  And although I had no doubt it would happen this year, they were always heading down this path, it still freaked me out.  Marriage= Adulthood.  Gulp.  Ellen is only a year older than me.  Tony is a year and a half older.  And if they are adult enough to get married... I believe my reaction was something along the lines of ""oh shit, I need to pull my act together.""  And THEN I found out that they are getting married in June... not the far off date  imagined.  That's only like six months to plan a wedding, not much time, and Ellen is a senior and having to deal with comps.  Tony graduated last year, he lives in Louisville now.  He loves her so much; it's so obvious.  And I'm really happy for them.  Just freaked out.

Then I found out my good friend Greg from high school who went off to U of L is getting married in DECEMBER!!!!  He graduated with me!  He just turned 21 for the love of god!  I'm sure he knows what he's doing, he was always really responsible and sincere but... 

So what's my deal?  

Then I saw this quote on a friend's profile and I figured it out:  
               ""We don't see things as they are.  We see them as we are."" -Anais Nin

My problem is that I hear about my friends' marriages and I have one of two reactions (or both).  1. Wait a second, they're like my age, they're too young to get married!  AND/OR 2. Holy crap, if they're old enough to get married that means I'm old enough to get married.  And I have no clue where I'm heading and who with.  Both very self-centered reactions that have nothing to do with them and everything to do with me.  I guess I look at my friend's marriages, and instead of looking at them objectively, I look at them in terms of me.  It makes me think, do we ever really look at people?  I mean, really SEE them for who they are?  Or do we simply judge them in terms of ourselves?  Somehow I think the latter possibility more likely.  At least at first.  Hopefully with time we learn to dig a little deeper.

Anyway, on another note, Spain was nice.  Warm.  And it was so nice being in a country where I understood the language and could communicate back.  Made me feel less like a dumb American for once.  And I went to the BEACH!  First time in a year and a half, far too long.  I went to Sitge on the costa del mar and to Tosa de Mar on the costa brava.  Sitge is more like your typical beach in the south of the US, but Tosa de Mar is strewn with rocks and jagged coastlines.  Both were beautiful.  It was so good to smell the salt in the air, hear the seagulls calling, feel the wind blowing my hair back, walk barefoot in the sand, the waves of the Mediterranean(very cold waves I might add) washing my feet... 

Hasta pronto

"event","So this is something that will not go in my xanga because I don't want certain eyes reading it, namely my friend who lives across the hall from here and frequent travel companion.  No, this is not some rage about how I secretly loathe her.  More, it is about how certain remarks and choices she's made seriously disturb me.  

First and foremost, her school freaks me the hell out.  She goes to the University of Pennsylvania, an ivy league, but more specifically to Wharton, the business school at UPenn.  And here's my theory:  that school takes its students, and either breaks them or turns them into clones.  It's little comments she's made like, oh at wharton we all use excell, or at wharton we have set classes, we don't have room for choice, or most creepily, once you've entered wharton, you can't get out.  These students go into this school and admittedly work hard, but it's like this school churns them out, takes their individuality and grinds it to fragments.  And apparently at Wharton, you don't go to grad school.  You go out into the workplace, usually where you intern at (which must occur the summer before senior year) and they've ingrained into you the idea that you must be working 80 hour weeks, that that is natural and should be accepted without question.  They will all make thousands and thousands of dollers a year, but I guess my question is ""WHAT PRICE YOUR SOUL?""

I have told her that her school creeps me out, and she's laughed and said it's because it's against everything that I am- which I take as a compliment.  I love my freedom far too much to give it up, and though I will never make a lot of money, I am content with being comfortable in life, and more importantly HAPPY.  

I think I've given her food for thought though this semester.  You see, my friend doesn't really like business- she's just had it ingrained in her by her Asian roots that she must make lots of money, and the easiest way to do that is through the world of finance.  But she really likes history.  So she is trying to double major at UPenn, although it sounds as if she will do nothing with her degree.  But she's made comments like, ""I wish I didn't have to do this..."" or ""I'm going to have no life before I'm 30..."".  And my usual response it to either remain quiet and listen or to look her in the eye and say, but you do have a choice.  Whatever you've been pressured into doing or been told you should do, THERE IS A POINT IN ALL THE MAIN TURNING POINTS IN YOUR LIFE IN WHICH YOU ARE COMPELLED TO MAKE AN ACT OF CONSCIOUS CHOICE.  

I made my choice a few years ago.  I chose to major in what I love not what I'm merely good at, and my family has supported me, because ultimately they want me to be happy.  I learned that money is not worth the robotic feeling you take on when you are doing something that makes you feel dead inside.  I only fear my friend will learn this far too late.

One last note though- where some angst does come in- about my friend in another area that has been getting on my nerves just a bit.  She is only 19, and sometimes I feel the year and a half difference between us rather strongly.  I could list several things but most importantly I am sick and tired of this whole ""i'm a southern belle thing"" aka what I like to call ""damsel in distress"" syndrome.  I always knew I was independent, and this semester has done nothing but reinforce that impression many times over.  I take care of myself; I do not like to owe anyone.  A rather small example:  We keep talking about how she has no problem with people buying her drinks, that it's the gentlemanly thing to do (and I think she looks down on guys who don't pay, she was really really spoiled by her high school boyfriend) vs. I don't like it because it makes me feel like I owe them and I need to pay them back, and I don't like debts.  This is just a little thing, but there have been larger issues too.  

This is what I have to say to that: Why is it you are constantly looking for some man aka knight in shining armor to save you?  

I'll save myself thank you."

"event","Sometimes you have to go away to remember and appreciate the beauty of what you already have.

This is the conclusion I have reached here in Europe.  I have seen so many beautiful things here.  And what I love most is how every day is an adventure.  So much to see and experience.  

Reading about this movie ""Elizabethtown"" and watching the preview has really inspired me.  I really want to go see it if it's here.  Kentucky is my home, and always will hold a special place in my heart wherever I go.  And when I was watching the preview I saw Orlando Bloom and Kirsten Dunst sitting at the Point at my college in Indiana, it brought a smile to my face for how I love my other home.

But what I love most is how I'm excited that when I come back to the US, I'm determined to keep doing this:  I want to explore home as thoroughly as I'm exploring Europe.  I want to keep living life as an adventure.  In fact, I am determined to.

I want to hop in a car and just drive around and see random things, funny things, sad things, important things.  And these roadtrips don't have to be long affairs- it could consist of simply going down to Madison or walking down to the Point.  I guess what I'm trying to say is that I want to live life by seeing the beauty inherent in every moment; I want to maintain this sense of wonder and freshness with my outlook on the world.  

I think last year I lost something, bogged down in all the work and responsibility and adulthood- I don't know if that thing can be defined- I guess maybe to put it best ""delight in the moment.""  And it took this semester abroad in Europe for me to regain it. To see the beauty of the world here- and to remember the beauty of home as well.  At this moment I am truly happy and loving life."

And so in memory of Drew:

He was smart.  Probably one of the few who would rival me in Spanish class.... if not beat me.  Especially since last term he spent the semester in Spain.  Always on Dean's List.  

He was liberal.  More so than me.  Almost bohemian.  He did what he wanted, and lived his life that way.  That can be admired.

He was one of the College House guys on campus, and let me tell you that was a cool thing.  They, along with the Young House guys, were just... well quality.

He had crazy curly hair, and since I happened to be burdened with the same affliction, we will consider this a plus.  

He was... a lot of different things.... how can you sum up a person.  Worlds can't describe, nor are we numbers that you can add up to one whole thing.  We're whole worlds, made up of good and bad and everything in between.  And our own worlds touch each other, mingle a bit, and then leave.  His is gone forever.  And I think the universe is crying a bit for the loss."

That was how I spent my last weekend.  In West Virginia.  More details later.

Maybe in order to truly live life, it is necessary to live life on the edge balancing between fear and excitement.  

Never stop challenging yourself... do the hard thing--it will reward you if only in that you will learn what you are truly capable of.  

I always find my faith it seems when I stop looking for the unseeable and simply start appreciating what I can see-- be it up at the sky from the valley, down at the world from the cliff, out to the seemingly infinite ocean.  I live for those moments.  One day perhaps I'll be able to look at life as simply that-- a series of moments, instead of the hrs, days, and years man has reduced it to-- and I'll be free.

Unchain yourself.  Because nobody else will do it.

Oh Man!  Why do you strive so hard with your endless ambition to the point that you lose sight of that which is most important?  You are simply a small piece in the great Pattern of the World.  And there is beauty in that.  Be content.

Interesting.... I would just like to say, in my defense, that when I at least mean stylish, I mean that he appeals to me.  Doens't mean he appeals to everyone else.  I once had a crush on a guy who was only 5'2 and shaved his head... but he did martial arts and I guess I found it hot.  And also-- anyone who says physical appearance doesn't matter is lying.  That's a bunch of idealistic crap.  You have to be attracted to them sexually or it will never ever work.  Period.  Ok, enough defending myself."

Plus I'm disappointed at how easily the media predicted he'd be pope.  I guess it doesn't matter what I think.  I'm not even Catholic, and this pope would probably declare me a heathen or something by some of my views.  Because, god help me, I believe in ""relativism"" as he described it and I am keenly intersted in other faiths too.  I do have to say though that this election has made me realize how amazing John Paul the II was... I admired that man, and the good he did... I think everyone did, no matter their faith or lack thereof.  Hope Ratzinger proves me wrong."

"event","What a long week.  But one paper, one presentation, and one rough draft in... only 9 more assignments to turn in during the next two weeks... 7 of which are in the last week... grr.  

We had a really frightening episode though this week.  I was in my room talking to my friend Allie who was on a round.  Suddenly a girl walked in, saying she thought someone had jumped out of a window of Crowe, the dorm across the street.  Crowe is an all guy's dorm, and notorious for prank and general craziness.  Exchanging looks, Allie and I head for the door, me ahead b/c Allie had sprained her ankle.  Walking out, I see a body on the ground, and start running yelling for Allie to call security.  My other friend and RA Dan was running out of Crowe at the same time.  He took care of the victim while I waved security and the ambulence in and performed crowd control.  The person fell from the THIRD floor of Crowe.  He/She (for privacy issues) could've broke their neck.  They are lucky to be alive, and extremely fortunate it was grass they fell on.  Needless to say though, it was very scary.  It made me extremely grateful though for the training we recieved in August in Behind Closed Doors.  They were the most extreme situations that one could encounter, and not likely that one would have to deal with them- if we were lucky.  Unfortunately, we were not that lucky, but at least we were prepared.  Strange though it may sound, it reminded me why I'm an RA and how important the role can be.  That and I just really love my girls too and am so happy that I have had this opportunity to get to know them.  One of them is going to be an RA next year (actually she isn't mine, but she spends all her time here, so I have adopted her.)

But going to get off campus now and go eat dinner w/ Sarita... who is going to Mexico next year for Winter term... I won't see her until Spring Term next year b/c I will be in Belgium during fall... extremely happy for her but sad about that.  But that is ok, new experiences can only make us grow and force us to push ourselves in a new way.  I think that's the one thing I've learned this year- always challenge yourself, otherwise you're not living.  You're just going through the routine that has long since bored you and it will eat your soul away after awhile.  (I know, sounds dramatic, but for me it's true.)  Change may not be easy, there wil be up's and down's, but life isn't meant to be lived in stasis.  So don't take the easy way out."

Yes, they can, the proof of it is lying in my suitcase right now.  Ah well, if it isn't one thing, it is another.  Here's hoping I didn't make a mistake today... well it is over and done with now, and I shall deal with the consequences, whatever they may be, tomorrow.  Don't look back, you can never look back.

The semester is coming to a close, and I have deadlines galore.  It's like a race to see who shall succomb first:  me, out of exhaustion, or the semester which ends in FOUR weeks!  And one of those weeks is exam week, which I am actually looking forward to- I know, sounds kind of sick, but it looks kind of appealing when compared to dead week.  Or this week for that matter.  

Formal is coming up this weekend, so that's something to look forward to, or at least something to get me away from the slew of papers stacked on my desk.  Nick, that is what my question concerns.  If you are free, wanna come to Chi O formal with me?  It's free- well except gas money which I know is killer right now- and should be a good time.  Sorry I missed your im on Friday, you literally missed me by like 3 minutes... but seriously, im me and I'll give you more details. I need to know since it's this coming weekend...

In short, I am alive.  All is mostly well.  Two weeks left until break.  

With a little more depth now-- 

Whoa, how time gets away from you.  February's been ok.  Um, big things that have happened?  I decided not to reappy to be an RA, and I applied to go to Belgium for next year.  Really nervous about it.  Excited, but scared 'cause I'll be alone most likely.  Plus, money has become a big thing for me lately after getting slapped in the face by the Hanover College Business office (may they all have boils) with around 1700 dollers in debt IN THE SAME WEEK!  Separate bills, so must they send it all in one week???  Plus, I still had my ChiO dues to pay, so I was looking at 2000 dollers in debt.  I about had a breakdown.  Well, I kind of did, since I called my mom crying abou it, and then I took the exam from hell in Astronomy, so my mom came down that weekend and made me feel better.  Plus, I still had my ChiO dues to pay, so I was looking at 2000 dollers in debt.  I still haven't paid it all off, but I'm breathing again.  My mom and I are working on it, but I hate asking her for money.  My dad is no use.  He hasn't contributed a penny to college for me.  Oh well.  Other than that crisis, life is pretty good.  I'm in five classes right now or 17 hours of class a week, so that kind of sucks, but after this term, my gdr's are done and it's all three hour classes for me.  No more of this four day a week crap.  Plus, in two weeks I'm on break, so that' exciting.  What sucks is that midterm week is going to be hellish-- I have somehow managed to luck out and have 3 exams, a quiz, and a presentation all in one week.  Plus regular work.  That should be illegal.  Oh well, it'll be fine, it always is.  I just won't sleep much that week.  My mom has to have an operation though over break, so I'm not going to go to Florida like I was planning to.  My mom is more important than 80 degree weather.  There's probably more things, but I need to get back to work now.  Will try to do better writing in this."

I've been going to bed by 1 (latest) so that's good, sleep is nice.  And I think I'm just looking at things more positively.  Things that were overwhelming last term are just worth a minor shrug from me now.  Which is good.  Since I just decided to take on more, lol.  But most importantly, I'm visiting my friends much much more than I did by the end of last term.  They were busy too by that point to absolve my conscience, but still...  you know you're having a good time when me and Sarah managed to get four of the five Crowe boys watching ""The Prince and Me"" in Phil's room Friday night.  :-)  Boys, you say you don't like chickflicks, but you still watch!  Other things have happened, but I don't feel like listing them out... suffice to say that things are just nice now more or less.  There's work, and I have meetings every day like last semester, but... I guess my outlook has changed, and whether that is due to my healthier habits or my own determination to just BE happier, who knows?  And bottom line-- who cares?  Everyone hates winter term here but I like it b/c it means I'm halfway through the year, and this year that is especially good b/c that means I'm halfway through my science sequence and close to finishing my gdr's... and spring term awaits, the best thing Hanover College ever invented.  Hope this finds everyone else in a pretty good mood too.  I'm off to the gym."

"event","To Steph- Katie's operation went well.  In fact, it's believed she may not even have to wear the brace like they thought.  Things are looking really good.

For all who have no clue what I'm talking to, one of my best friends from childhood was in a really bad car accident shortly before break ended in Tennessee.  She and some other girls from high school went over 70 ft. cliff around Gatlinburg.  And by some miracle they survived.  Except Kate- she broke her back.  It was looking scary for awhile, they weren't sure if she would walk again, and she was freaking out, understandably so, and that was affecting her vital signs.  However, then we got the good news that, although she'd have to have a five hour surgery that was yesterday to fix her 12th vertebre, she would be able to walk definitley.  And now some more good news.  It was weird b/c I'd just seen her a few days before she'd left on her trip.  Either way, even when she heals, this accident will affect her- she'll definitley be behind now at UK, but also she'll probably have back problems for the rest of her life.  But I'm just glad she's alive.  If I'd lost her, I think I would've lost, in a sense, my childhood because she's always been there, from age 3 and on.  And she knows how to get under my skin like no one else no matter how much time has passed since we've talked-- and everyone needs someone like that, who knows them inside and out.  

Other than that, school's ok.  Started classes Monday, the same old thing.  Just gotta get through this semester, and all my gdr's will be done.  No more science EVER!  That's what I keep telling myself at least.  It's been warm here, so that's been nice, and I'm in a skirt even as I type.  Oh, and I just joined a sorority, so we'll see how that goes.  Taking it day by day is the goal this term.  I refuse to get so stressed out like last semester-- it isn't worth it.  And I've been going to the gym like I used to, and I'm going cold turkey on the soft drinks.  I need to be healthier, it makes me feel better.  But I've gotta run, gotta eat before class!"

I guess I could graduate a semester early... but I really don't see the point.  I don't know what I would do with myself in the meanwhile.  This has been... an interesting term.  Good really, but I've begun to make a lot of decisions about where I'm heading with my life.  I think that I've learned something each year of my life, but for some reason that seems so much clearer now that I'm in college.  Freshman year was a time for academic growth.  Never had I been pushed so hard and so far in my studies, particularly in my writing.  This year though has been a year for personal growth.  I've realized I'm becoming that dreaded thing-- an adult.  I've only had three jobs in my life, starting this summer and on, and I haven't liked them all, but each has taught me something about life and about myself.  I've learned the importance of professionalism 24/7 and also its pressures.  I've realized that people watch me and my doings whether I realize it or not.  I see how easy it is to put people in a category and now know how much I hate being categorized myself.  I understand the importance of having balance in my life-- even if I haven't figured out yet how to actually get it!  (That's next term's goal...)  And I'm learning how to let go and just accept change... even embrace it... because although ""here"" is a good place to be, ""there"" could be just as good, if not better.  And I'll never know if I don't try.  The thing about turning 20 is that it suddenly makes you very aware of all that you haven't figured out... but also of all that you have.  People make remarks like, wow, in a decade you're going to be settled, married to someone, with a career, etc. etc... I don't know about that.  I don't think I ever want to be ""settled.""  And I think the only time you ever have it all figured out is when you're dead.  And even that's arguable.  I hope life always has some surprises up its sleeves.  So yeah I'm 20.  And I'm ok with that.

P.S. Congrats to everyone who graduated in December.  Niki, I don't know your dad, but wow, that kind of perseverence is amazing.  If the weather cooperates, I'm hoping to come down for a night sometime during these three weeks."

"event","Because it's finals week...

Today we salute you stressed out college student during exam week.  As you sit in your lonely cubical in the library, doped up on starbucks & aderol, you think to yourself, am I ever going to need to know this stuff in life?   The distractions are tempting and you have suddenly diagnosed yourself with ADD along with advanced delusionary schizophrenia with involuntary narcissistic rage, I'm sure by now you know exactly what everyone is doing because you have checked your buddy list 800 times.  Christmas break is just days away, and your prozac prescription will be in tomorrow.  So crack open an ice cold bud light after that last exam,  because for most of us christmas will be spent in rehab..."

I think I aced my English presentation.  She loved my poem and came and talked to me later in the day.  That's good as that's the most creative I've been in a long, long time.  School has sucked out my creativity, but I was feeling inspired that night.  I need to do that more often.

Nick, what are you up to either Wednesday or Thursday?  Let me know.  Why does Wednesday have an ""n"" in it?  Random thought.  Anyway, I said I'd visit this term, and I'm making good on the promise albeit at the end of the year if anybody will be around.  

All right, I will study, and then bed.  And then up early to study more.  I have no hopes of acing this thing, I never did, but I shall not fail it!

P.S. Steph, I shall tell you a story another time.  Sorry to be ambiguous, I've learned it's best not for me to write in the heat of the moment, I was just really angry but I'm fine now.  Happy really.  It's amazing what happens when Dead Week ends, you realized you survived and all of your assignments are in, and your classes are done does for your mood.  I did my hyper thing-- you know what I mean.  And I skipped like I haven't done in 10 years.  :-)

Turning 20 on Sunday... dum da dum dum dum!"

"event","Did you know there was an adult version of the croup?  Yep, that's right, there is, and that's what I've got.  Now my only question is.... what the hell is the croup?  

However, the doctor was very nice and gave me some lovely drugs that actually are working somewhat.  I even made it to two of my classes today.  And I went to bed at 10:30 last night.  I haven't gone to bed at 10:30 since... well a long time ago.  So although I still look like death, my skin is pale (well paler than usual), my voice is still scratchy and painful, and my eyes are tearing up, I'm actually somewhat kind of ok.

Countdown:  English= 5 classes; Eurasia= 9 classes; Geology= 9 classes; Spanish= 5 classes... and altogether there are only 18 days left of school!"

I can't breathe, although in an attempt to be positive, my throat no longer feels like sandpaper and my voice has progressed back up from a whisper to a croak.  Um, yay?  I'm so drugged up right now and I'm doing homework at the same time... haha yeah THAT is interesting.  I just wish the damn drugs would work or at least knock me out.  Ah well, se es la vie.

I just wish the seats in the theater had been a bit more roomier.  It's the first time in my life I've been glad I'm only 5'1.... there wasn't enough leg space for me, let alone someone taller like Ryan who was sitting behind me and is 6 foot!  Claustrophobia... oh well, it was worth it.  Went home for one night... wish I could've stayed a bit longer.  Saw Shrek 2... really good also."

"event","I have so much to do before Thanksgiving break.  Today I turned in a 12 page paper and took an exam (so yeah my weekend was really fun :-( )  I have another exam on Friday, geology, shoot me now.  Then next week is a Eurasia exam, can a person be killed twice?  And then in the Monday and Tuesday before they free us I have a lab, and two papers due that will altogether probably tally some 20+ pages.  But it's ok.  Or it will be.  Just gotta make it through the next two weeks.

Meanwhile, I got this flu mist stuff on Friday and am having a reaction to it now.  My entire body aches.  I feel like a decrepit 80 year old woman who's fallen and can't get up.  I have used a heating pad FOUR times today on my back!!!  wtf?  This can't be normal.

I want to see that new movie coming out with Johnny Depp that's based on J.M. Barrie's experiences with a family that ultimately inspired the writing of Peter Pan.  I think it comes out over vacations, so that's where I shall be.  I also would like to see Ocean's Twelve which comes out in December.  But I shan't see that until break, b/c between dead week and exam week, I'll be booked.  Thus is the life of a college student.

I'm going to see Phantom of the Opera though in Indy on Saturday!  For only 10 dollers!  I'm excited, I've never seen it before. 

Brad, I can't come to your graduation, it's the day before my birthday.  Plus, we don't get out until the 17th as it is.  I know I will want to go home.  But when is your graduation?  Maybe I can come to that because my exam schedle is very erratic this year.  I don't know, we'll see.  I need to visit.

I am excited for Christmas, it is by far my favorite holiday... to see the decorations, to go shopping, I can't wait."

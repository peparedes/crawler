Things that made me really happy from LOST:

1- Vincent had a hand in saving Desmond!  <3

2- We got to get our last glimpses of Rose and Bernard, and establish that they were time traveling as well.

3- Sayid and Shannon makeouts!  I'm wicked excited that Shannon is his ""one true love"" he is with in the end.

4- OMG FRANK WASN'T ACTUALLY DEAD.  This makes me feel better about not registering that we were supposed to think he was dead when the sub blew up.  When everyone was heading ashore, I was asking, ""Where's Lapidus?""  The new answer:  Not actually dead.  :)

Other things, I'm sure, but Diego's unhappy tummy odyssey today and the heat have melted my brain, so that's where I'll leave things for now."

One of the Barth Syndrome parents designed this car for a NASCAR contest where the winning design will be put on a NASCAR car and driven in some big race.&nbsp; The winning car is based on votes, and they want to try to get as many people to vote as possible, because if the design wins, it could do a lot to help raise awareness of Barth Syndrome and encourage more research and possibly more donations toward funding the research to help find a cure.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you could follow the link and click ""vote,"" it would help a lot.&nbsp; You do not have to register to vote, you just have to click.&nbsp; You can vote once per computer, per day until the contest ends.&nbsp; It means a lot to the Barth Syndrome parents, so it would be really great if everybody could take a couple seconds out of their day to give the Barth car a vote.

Thanks.&nbsp; :)"

Grr.


Don't worry, I didn't buy anything.  Ain't got no cash."

"event","Hey, friends.

I can't afford to go see Star Trek... or Wolverine... or any of those other things that are coming out in theaters yet, so I'm posting a ""please place any spoilers behind an LJ-cut"" request before all those happy summer movies I want to see end up accidentally spoiled.

Thanky kindly.  :)


- Me"

It had little guinea pigs and gerbils and ferrets and friends on it.

It was really nice."

"event","This has been a tiring week.

Next day off is probably two Sundays from now.  Is that Mother's Day?  I think so.  Shit, I should have told GS I couldn't work the day before Mother's Day so maybe I could get to Brockton Saturday night.  Maybe I still can, just later.  We haven't driven out there since New Year's, so hopefully that would be okay.

I'm still pretty sad about Alejandro.  I just wasn't ready for him to be gone so soon.  We got a new pig that Vin insisted we name Arthur, and we're slowly introducing him and Francisco to each other.  I just miss Alejandro's pushy-yet-shy little personality demanding food from me every time he thought I was in the kitchen.  It was so cute.  And I miss when he'd fling the first carrot I gave to him back out of the cage in excitement because he thought maybe I had a better one I hadn't given him yet.

Must be bedtime.  Actually, it's after bedtime.  It is also time to move the laundry from the basement again.  Sigh.  Living on the third floor sucks."

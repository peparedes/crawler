"event","So shit's been going bad latley, my mother is going to call some phycologist guy or osmething to see if i can be put in an inpatient rehab for bulimia.  FUCK HER!  I'm fat as hell.  Last night Cade came over and told me Avery had sex the other night with some 18 year old girl, we were never together, but you know how it makes you feel like shit.  So I sat in my bed adn cryed all nigth tyring to figure out what i'm doing wrong.  I'm doing everything i can to be perfect but i'm never perfect enough for anyone.  God I hate life.  I've cut once recently and I'm trying not to do it again because I'm actually almost ok with not wearing a hoodie around people and I don't want them seeing my arms.  So i'm trying to quit.  Me and Kirsten are good friends again.  She knows what I got arrested for now.  She's actually supporting me in changing back and not being bitchy with me anymore. She saw my arm and talked with me about it and we didn't fight.  I told her what I was really arrested for and we didn't fight.  It's nice not to get bitched at for something. :)  Happy wedding something to Katie.  What's going on with DJ howcome the relationship is gonig down the shitter?  i luv you! bye bye"

Last night with Dustin- i hated it.  Two things kept going through my head, 1- that it was way to much like with Tyrell. and 2- Rory. I odn't know if its a good thing or a bad thing to be thinking of another guy while that is happening.  Prob. not. Oh well, dustin was just using me for a peice.  the whole reason I didn't do anything with rory was because i had to kinda test myself first to make sure that I actually could say no. Also if he listened to me or not.  I even told fucking dustin about tyrell and he still kissed me.  and more... fuck him.  I hate ass holes. and he's not even that attractive. What the fuck is wrong with me??? god damn...  then he kept trying to under my bra but because i hate my boobs i wouldn't let him.  so he was kinda trying to finger me or something- i don't know.  but he knew i was on my period then- so i don't know what hte fuck he was trying or doing.  Hopefully i won't ever talk to him again so I won't have to.  I hate him because he's a jerk and i'm more of a jerk.  I don't know if he htinks we are a thing or if it was a one night thing.  Hopefully just a one night thing.  God it was reminded me so much of tyrell.  I went home and thought about cutting.  but then that wouldn't work.  God I can't beleive I was thinking about rory that whole time.  That prob. isn't a great thing on Dustins part.  I wish I did something with rory when I could have.  but now i think he hates me.  And i look dumb in these pants because it makes my fat show even more and its disqusting.  Maybe he'll give me pills. I like pills.  pills are fun for me!  Why is it all the kids i don't like get on me but the ones i'm in love with hate me?  I go to far out of my league.  But those who do get on me is obviously just for a peice of ass.  I won't tell anybody, they can make up what I looked like. nobody will know.  god who the fuck would want to 'willingly' and 'openly' do something with me? jesus christ i look like something out of the fat farm.  I'm disqusting!  everything on me is disqusting.  So i wouldn't want to embarrase someone tha tmuch either.  thats why i don't ever want anybody ot know that I like them- its an embarrasment to them."

"event","god i'm a fucking cow. I'm disqustingly fat again and I hate it, i can't stand it. I hate myself. I hate hte way I look, I hate the way I sounds, I hate my skin, I hate my hands, i hate my feet, I hate my eyebrows, I hate my arms, I hate my tummy, I hate my legs, I hate my scars, I hate my boobs, I hate my back, I hate my neck, I hate my hair, I hate my knees, I hate my fingers, I hate my butt, I hate every fucking thing about me! I am the scum of the earth. I am what eats the left overs of every humans food crumbs, and gets fucking fat as a mother fucking whale off of them. I HATE MYSELF. I hate the people I associate with because they only do it as a pitty vote. I hate the people that don't associate with me because they are to fucking good for me. I hate skinny people because they are at a point that i can only ever wish to be. I hate food becasue thats the fucking stuff that makes me like this. I hate fucking friends and family because they bitch when you don't eat. I hate my mouth because it's what accepts the food. I hate my stomic because thats what keeps the god damn food. I hate my brain because It's what makes me even want it in the first place. I ahte my hands because thats what brings me the food. I hate hte fucking scales because that just brings me back to reality. I hate my fucking life"

"event","I'm at 132 or else 131- who knows? Same thing... I just want to be thin!!!! All I've eaten so far is 1 1/2 peices of bread with jelly, and i'm fatter! I hate my lard! Thats all I am these days. A tub o' lard. I've almost finished my journal in that note book and i'll have to tear those out and put it in a place never to be found. and then just start over in my new note book. Golly I'm sick of me. I'm fucking breaking out again and it's bugging the fuck out of me. I'm already fat- why does my face have to be sick as well?!?!?!? My goodness i'm going to shit. my legs are fat, my tummy is fat, my arms are fat, under my neck is fat, my back is fat, I'M FAT! Why can't it just go away like it should. If it wasn't supposed to be lost- why would it be there? I hate looking at myself in the mirror becuase I'm disqusting and I am a embarrasment to society- this really explaines why tyrell would fuck kirsten after me to get my nasty tast out of him. I hate this!!!!!"

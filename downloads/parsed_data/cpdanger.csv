"event","Well, I'm off to camp tomorrow.  I have to say that I'm pretty excited, I always miss camp as spring starts, so it'll be good to go.  It'll probably be a while before I post again, since I will have very limited internet access.  But, for those of you out there who would still like to contact me over the summer, you can still email me (cpdanger@brandeis.edu), I'll get them within a few days.  Or you can use good ole snail mail.  The address is 150 Richardsons Corner Rd, Charlton MA, 01507.  If you mail me, not only would it make me very happy, but I'll probably write back too.  Well, I must be off to finish packing, so to all you out there, have a great summer, and hope to hear from you all soon."

"event","Yeah, it's been quite a while this time.

Jeez, a lot has happened.  I finished my freshman year of college.  It was remarkably bittersweet.  Spent the last night hanging out with Lara, Rich, and Noy, and helped Noy with her stuff to the airporter.  After she left (about 3 am) I just kind of sat outside and images of all the memorable events from the year passed through my mind. Then I couldn't sleep.  It was strange.  I was sad about the year ending but happy with everything that I did during the year.  I'll miss all my senior friends, they were always a pleasure to be with.  I'm lucky though, I'll get to see a bunch of them next year, since they'll be living near Brandeis anyway.  So, one year down, three more years to explore.  

Well, that was a few weeks ago, but still kind of fresh in my mind.  Since coming home, I haven't done a whole lot of stuff.  That's been nice, sleeping really late and playing Civilzation 3 (by the way started a new game tonight, and jumped up 2 difficulty levels, so I'm having a hell of a time with it).  My family had a yard sale this past weekend, which went well, but was draining.  Got to spend plenty of time with Bethany, which is always good. :)  Last night went to go see Troy with Bethany and her friends down at BC.  That was one hell of a time, it was great.  Hanging out with a group like that is always great though. The movie, despite being horribly horribly inaccurate, and somewhat poorly acted, was enjoyable; although that may have been because I was with a group that could laugh at it's mistakes just like I did.  All in all, it was fun.  

Next up, camp, which I have dual feelings about.  I'm looking forward to it, since I just love camp so much, but at the same time, don't want to leave my friends from home.  Well, I'll just make the best of what time I have.  Anyways, I'll get to see them on exchange weekends, so it'll be good.  

So yeah, there's the big update on my life, if anyone has any questions, feel free to ask.  Ok, I'm not really sure why I wrote that, but hey, why not?"

"event","Yeah, it's been a while since I last posted, thought I should do that again.  It's really late, but this has been a great last weekend of my freshman year at Brandeis.  Just one more final to go through and I'm home free.  I could write for a while about my feels about that, but it's nearly 4 in the morning, and it can wait. Had a really good conversation with Bethany tonight, which made me happy, even though it wasn't about anything in particular, but hey, we had fun.  And I get to see her tomorrow, so hooray.  :)  

And now to sleep...."

"event","Well, I have one hell of a week coming up.  Three essays and a chinese test, none of which I've started thinking about, but I should be able to do it.  The real crazy part is that this is my last week of classes of my freshman year here at Brandeis.  Man has it flew by.  But hey, it's been awesome, so I just need to get through this week.

Today, I found and downloaded some fun music that I first heard at The Darkness concert.  The Wildhearts are a pretty awesome band, and they have a wicked cool cover of the Cheers theme song, what could be better than that?   

Oh, and this was a pretty fun weekend.  It was very full of shows to see.  First, Bethany, Andrew and I saw Pippin in Boston, which was great.  Then we went back up to Dover to see Andrew in our high school's production of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.  It certainly was amusing, especially seeing the music teacher dress up as a Elvis-like Pharoh -- highly enjoyable right there.  Friendly's with Josh and Bethany after the show was a ton of fun too.  I miss being able to hang out like that, feels like I haven't done it much.  But, after all that, Bethany and I got some time to ourselves, which was nice, because we hadn't really gotten a chance to just relax and hang out for a couple weeks.  So, hooray for that!  :)

Then today, came back down to Brandeis just in time to see Romeo and Juliet, set in modern day Israel.  It was very interesting, and well performed.  The only problem with all this fun was that I didn't have time to do any work, but hey, who cares about that junk right?  :)  Ah well, this week should prove most interesting...."

"event","Well, since it's 2:45 in the morning, I've obviously had a long day.  It was pretty good though.  Spent some time relaxing and playing games in the morning and early afternoon.  Ran three miles with Dan at 3.  Didn't end up going to archery, but I'm perfectly happy with that because I spent the majority of my evening and night helping one of my best friends here at Brandeis.  I can only hope that she'll take my help to heart.  And I'll keep giving her my help as long as she needs it.  It was a good night in my mind, and I'm glad I spent it how I did.  I certainly wouldn't have chosen any other thing to do.  

On a somewhat lighter note, I read the review for Merchant of Venice in The Justice today.  My first reaction was, to be perfeclty honest, complete horror.  Apparently, according to the reviewer, I'm ""wooden"" and ""bland"".  So, with that kick in the nuts, I got all self-conscious and decided never to act again....   Then I used some logic. I realized that not only is this just one person's opinion, but it's the opinion of a person whose tastes I know, and I don't agree with them at all.  He loves Susan Surandon, and by God, do I hate her.  She ruined the Children of Dune Miniseries on the Scifi Channel.  So that, among many other things, helped me feel better about the bad review.  I'm happy with the job we did on that show.

Alright, time to take the nap that I pretend is a full night's sleep...."

"event","What a nice day today was, that makes me glad.  With beautiful weather like this, I really can't wait until summer.  It's 11:30 at night, and it's still beautiful out.  I love it.  If I didn't have this chinese homework to do, I would be sitting outside, just sitting.  That'd be nice.  Speaking of chinese, today was cool because a guy in my chinese class told me that he's getting an apartment in Beijing this summer and gave me an open invitation to come if I could get over there.  Which I can't, but hey, it's the thought that counts, right?  

What makes today even better is that I know exactly what work I need to do, and when to do it.  I don't have to start until tomorrow, so I could relax today.  So, I went running and just enjoyed the pleasant weather.  Hooray for this nice day..."

"event","And the show is done.  Sure was a lot of fun.  To Debbi, Amy, Alex, Eric, Coral, MeLena, Dayna, and all those who came to see Merchant of Venice(especially Bethany and my parents), I thank you.  It really was a wonderful time, and I'm glad I ended up doing it, despite my reluctance to even audition.  It was a lot of hard work, but we had a lot of laughs, and all the work was well worth it.  Jeez, it's only been a few hours, and I already miss it.  But, I certainly have fond memories.  Thank you all."

"event","So, tech week has really gotten going.  Today was the first full costume rehearsal, and it didn't go so well, I mean, when you have literally two lines of text during which I must change costumes and run back on stage, it's a little hard.  Also, had to actually play my flute today between scenes and what not.  We'll see how that goes, I've been practicing for the past couple hours in between headaches.  What my music teacher told me years ago is still true, there's no headrush like playing in band.  I'm almost dizzy.  But hey, it's all in the name of theater, and Shakespeare no less.  So, when my headache goes away, I go back to my flute, and try to memorize some songs.  

Also, today was the first day of class after break, it was surprisingly easy.  Don't have any big projects or papers or anything to work on for a week or two, so for now, I'm good. All in all, it's been quite a good and productive day though."

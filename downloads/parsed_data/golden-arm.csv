"event","I know I havn't written in this livejournal for a while. Proabably just because I've been busy (though I can't really think of what I've been doing), and I just write in a regular private journal instead. Things have been feeling rather different for me lately. I've been getting blown off a lot lately by people, but because of that I'm starting to feel more comfortable in my own skin, sort of like I'm comming into my own I guess. I've been forced to spend an immense amount of time alone. I spend at least 5 hours a day now, usually, at a coffee shop reading Harry Potter (I'm only on the third one but I'm obsessed). I do alot more things on my own now instead of being so dependent on having someone go with me to do something everytime something needs to get done. Though still flexible and easy-going, I feel that I'm able to be more decisive. Because I've been spending so much time alone, I'm learning to know myself on a whole new level and discovering what i truely want. 

While, for the most part, everything seems to be going well, my family keeps trying to convince me to go see a doctor. I probably should, but I just don't know what they could do, and i refuse to take medications for a sleeping problem, or at all for that matter. I havn't been able to sleep well at all for a good two or three weeks. I am unable to fall asleep until four or five a.m., toss and turn the entire time, and wake up firve hours later. It seems that right when the clock strikes twelve, i get wild and hyper. I just have all this energy and get all twitchy. So I've started to just go to the gym every night at midnight or one just so I'm not at home, while my entire familys asleep, bouncing off the walls. I could be at my house doing anything, or nothing, and no matter what, I get hyper and can't fall asleep for the life of me.

Wish me luck and I hope all of you in the LiveJournal rehlm are doing well ! <3"

"event","So basically life has been pretty alright. I'm really enjoying all the poeple that I've been hanging out with lately. They are showing me what real friendship is and I find something genuinely unique in every single one of them. And I feel like I can trust them. That's hard to find, especially these days.

Anyways, break was good, besides the fact that I didn't get to see chloe nearly as much as I would have liked. I had a sleepover at Jenna's with Jenna and Kelsey and that was really fun, minus the fact that I can NEVER stay up that late. I'm really happy to be feeling close with both of them right now. Oh and, I'm dreading going back to school. :-/

Yesterday I overdosed on coffee. I had one large black coffee from ampm, two vente soymilk gingerbread lates, and two black coffees from in n out. Who knew that they had free refills there? With that, I couldn't sleep at all, and felt compleatly sick. This taught me that when my friends say stop with the cofee, I should probably stop with the coffee. Hahah. The worst part was that I had to get up early this morning, without having had any sleep.

Today me and Schuyler went to a Zen Buddhist Temple. It was extremely interesting. We learned how to meditate. But the chanting hym songs they sang made the community seem like a cult. Before that, I was thinking of converting.

Besides the obvious, I keep on wondering what I ever did to deserve such an amazing guy in my life. He seriously surprises me more and more with how great he is. I don't think I've ever cared about anyone as much as I do about him. It's so wonderful to know that even if no one else understands me, that I can always turn to him, knowing that he will. I love every second I ever get to spend with him. Speaking of, he's here right now. :-]

I've quit eating fast food, quit caffine, quit meat (with the exception of sea food), and cut back alot on junk food. I've been keeping myself busy; dancing alot, never sleeping, spending time with great people and going on bikerides. I feel like I've come to find out who my true friend are, not that anyone has given me a reason of why they particularly aren't my friend. But i just mean, i've been finding out the people who I'm meant to be extra close with. I've grown alot closer to chloe lately it seems like. She's showed me that there is such a thing as sober fun. I don't need drugs to escape my problems that I really need to stay focused on right now. And I don't need to dissapoint the people who know that I am better without them. I'm the type of person where I need to have it all or nothing. I can't just do a drug on occasion. I need to be doing it continuosly, if I'm going to do it at all.

I'm starting to find myself with nothing do. It's like I can do anything, everything, but I don't know what to do. I really want this school year to be different than last year, more laid back and calm. 

I'm at Sami's right now. I'm utterly bummed because I can't go shopping in San Diego [like we had planned] because I have a doctor's appointment at five.

Someone call me today, and let's hangout so I'm not so bored and sulky.

By the way, I think I write in this journal too much. It's almost an obsession. I need to find better things to do with my time.

loveyouuuu."

let go when you're hurting too much.
give up when love isn't enough.

Even the wrong words seem to rhyme.
Out of the doubt that fills my mind.
I somehow find, you and I  c o l l i d e
And I'm tangeled up in you.</i></b>


Sometimes I really just get compleatly irritated by <i>him.</i> Why doesn't <i>he</i> understand that everything <i>he's</i> looking for, <i>he</i> already has waiting for <i>him?</i> I'm right here, and I swear I would love <i>him</i> the best I could. I would be everything <i>he's</i> ever wanted. Why's <i>he</i> so ignorant?

I don't know. I lie to myself so much, that most the time I don't even know if the feelings I am feeling are really my own. Most of the time, I don't even feel like I love <i>him</i> at all. But then, sometimes, I just get in these awkward moods, and I dwell on everything we had.Or at least, everything I think we had.

I think I'm just in love with love. And that sometimes, I just want to be in love so bad, that I make believe that I used to be, and that I miss it. Or maybe I just feel like I miss <i>him</i> because I wasn't the one to let <i>him</i> go. I was the one rejected. And I guess I just hate that feeling.

I was going to break up with <i>him</i> that night, you know. So why do I, at times, feel so heartbroken? I guess that's the thing about first loves. They're always with you. Even if you're not around them. They'll always be a part of your emotions, and your heart. Because you gave them everything. <b>I gave <i>him</i> everything.</b> Maybe it's because I gave <i>him</i> my whole life, that I sometimes feel completely incomplete.

I don't really have any answers right now, but I'm just starting to try and figure things out. I really should stop lying to myself, because, as of right now, there's too many <u>layers of lies</u> for me to even begin deciphering. I guess the moral of the story, and of my relationship with <i>him,</i> is that I truely just screwed myself over. All, or at least most, could have been avioded if I had just taken the time to be honest with myself. Maybe then, I wouldn't have lied to myself and told myself that I was in love. I'm so contradictory that I'm just going to stop.







Two birthday parties to go to today. They should be fun. My parents are gone for the weekend though,
so I have to ditch them early to take care of my dog. This may or may not be a good thing. call me. <3"

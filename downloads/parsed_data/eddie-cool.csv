"event","So I'm nearing the end of my Junior year and I must say this year has been fucking crazy. It's been seemingly long and at the same time super fast. So much has happend. Between getting arrested, all the adventures, river parties, females, and my crazy spring break this has been one hell of a year. Next year I'll be a Senior, that's some scary shit. Almost done with high school. What am I going to do in the ""Real World""? Who knows. But for now, I'm just going to keep on enjoying life. 

I cam home from school today because I didn't feel good. So I figured I would update this thing. It's been a while since I've updated. My last post5 says April 06, but I'm pretty sure I updated that in Early November 06. Anyways, life is fantastic right now. My weekend was amazing. I went to Kentucky with my friend Lizz and her parents and it was sweet. We just chilled and road ATVs all over and enjoyed nature. It was incredible relaxing. No stress, no drama, just the good ol' out-doors. Hah. 

Prom was really fun, which was surprised me. I figured it would be pretty boring but nope, not at all. I stayed sober the whole time and had an amazing night. The Dace was fun, and afterprom was 2x more fun. They had all kinds of shit there and the theme was rock N Roll, so obviously I especially had an amazing time. Plus, most of my friends went which was cool. It was good to see everyone together just rockin' out with out drugs or Alcohol, haha. 

Well to conclude another boring blog I must say, life is great and I am happy. The warm weather is amazing. The weekends are great. Schools not even that bad this time of year. Everything is going good for now.

"event","Hey, I just got off the phone with Jaci, so you know I'm feelin' pretty good. Now I'm eating  tripple decker Peanut Butter and Jelly, it's SOOO GOOD. Anyways... this weekend has been awesome. Friday, I skated with Mike, Zeven, John, Shane, Tony, Joey, Josh, Andrew, and Benson. That was fun. It rained and hailed, and tornadoe alarms went off, it was crazy but overall fun.

Saturday was awesome. In the morning Mike, Matt, and I attended our usual Saturday Jam session at Matt's. We had been working on a couple songs but never got around to finishing them. Untill this day! Wow, we were on fire!!!! lol it was sweet, we finished two songs and worked on a bunch of other ones that sound so awesome I can't wait to we finish and record all of them.

Then I came, and Jeremy and Ryan were here waiting to take me to East Gate. So I jumped in the shower and got ready to go and then we loaded up on random shit, and headed out! On the way there we rocked out to music which was pretty awesome, haha.

When we got there it was a normal Satuday and East Gate which means a million little goth kids were there. It was crazy. Martin, Cauvin and Brian were there too. Which was random considering neither of our groups had been there in soo long. After hours, Jeff finnally met me up there which was awesome. Soon there were like a million people in the arcade and it made things pretty fun. Dennis showed up out of no where, which was also really random! Then Jeff, and I make our way to walk around East Gate one final time before it closes, and who do we see? ANDREW AND SKIP! It was so crazy! EVERYONE WAS THERE! If Jay had been there it would have been like every EG player known to man - kel and pat. Haha, anyways after talking to them for a while Martin and them showed up and started talking to Andaru and it was pretty much a huge party in the middle of the mall, Oh yeah right, lol.

Sunday has been pretty boring. I hung out with Zeven. We went Skating and shit, and played 21 with Shane and some people at Dawson. It was pretty cool. Then we skated to down town Madeira and hung out for a little. Then got picked up.

Yeah.

I miss Jaci

But as of now... the only thing I know that's going to happen is hittin' up East Gate Saturday to hang out with Jeff, and some friends. Show these scrubs who's boss. That's going to be awesome.

And uhh yeah, today was boring.

"event","YO! I haven't updated in along while, so I guess it's about time I update, hah. Alot has changed since I last updated. I have met the cooles/most beautiful/ funniest/ nicest girl in the entire world, lol, and she is my girl friend. Her name is Jaci.

At the beggining of the weekend Monica, Cindy (her sister) And Ryan, (her sister's boy friend) All just hung out and messed around. They all came over for a little and then we decided to go to New port and screw around there. It was great. We got there and walked around for a little and looked at some fat ass dude playing DDR. He had a mullet and it was so funny. Then we walked to Smoothie king, got some smoothies and headed out side. They were some really, really strange people doing like gymnastic stuff. They were all wearing leather and stuff, and they all looked like lesbians, making fun of them was really fun, haha. Once that got boring we headed back into Newport and went into game works again. This time some black girl was playing DDR on begginer and she failed. While she was playing, though, there were like these hicks trying to help her. This little fat girl was like... DERR DER UHH YOU HIT DA ARROWS WHEN THEY MATCH UP DERR. I was like, ""Is this game hard?"" They were like... "" Derr derr (random yelling from hicks... Uhhh yeah it's really hard we play all the time for fun!"" Then I say... ""Are you guys good?"" Hicks: "" Oh yeah we're really good! ! DEERRR"" Eddie: ""You play on heavy?"" Hicks: (Random studdering, well uhhh... Kinda we're like on staderrd durr."" Eddie: "" Ah, that's pretty hard."" So the black girl failed and I asked if I could have her second song because she like stepped off the pad, so I got on. I immediatly hit the down arrow three times, and went to Alphabetical mode, the dude like flipped out, he was like... ""Damn, he gonna show me up"". So then Monica chose Angelic mix for me, and every one was like GOGMGMOGMGOGMGOMGGM that song is so hard! The guy was like ""Can you beat freckles 2x? I just laughed and put Angelic mix on 2x then he almost had a heart attack. The only bad thing is there was no bar, so I didn't even full combo it, but I did rape it, lol. Everyone like freaked out. By the time I was done there was like a massive crowd and they all started clapping. Me, being the stud I am was like... ""THANK YOU! I'm the best in Ohio! Hahaha, it was fun.

          After that we went and got a pizza, and then told stories on the elevator, and then we saw War of worlds, it was fun. Too bad Pat is in Michigan. Tisk Tisk tisk. Sucks. Yeah.

Then yesterday I went to Jaci's...

             I had an awesome time. I met her dad and her stepmom, like... offcially, and we just kinda hung out for a little. Then we went on a walk around her neighborhood, and it was fun. We went to some park, and there were all these old people there, lol, Then this like bell concert happend and they all just sat there listening to it, lol. 

     Then we made our way back and waited for dinner to be ready. While we waited we watched The beauty and the Geek, and it was so funny.

    Then, dinner was done, and we all ate, and had some really good conversations, ha, it was a fun time. Then her dad gave her some money, and we walked to greaters for ice cream. It was good. We then.. walked to another park, and met some kids, then we walked to the other park again, it was fun. We made out way back to her house, after like an hour, and then we just kind of hung out and listened to music, and stuff. It was fun. Jaci is great. <3 Hah"

"event","Today I didn't really do much of anything, I just kind of hung out. Then again it is only 5:28, so I am sure there is stuff left to do. I woke up at 3:34 too, and that might have something to do with me hanging out all day, lol. I just got eating dinner with my family. It was pretty fun and disfunctional. Basically my sister started yelling-went to her room. Then my brother got mad because everyone was calling him cranky, and so he went downstairs. I am just like wtf is going on, lol, but I guess everything is fine now. 

    Yesterday was really fun. Early in the day, I woke up and went to old navy to get some new swimming trunks and some shirts and stuff. It was Cindy's birthday and we were going to Coney island. So I got to Ryan's and changed, and then Joey, Ryan and I got in Pat's car and drove to Cindy's. When we pulled up all the girls were out side playing cornhole, lol it was pretty funny. It was Katie, Stacey, Bekah, Emilee, Cindy, and Amber. It was nice to finnally meet these people. Jimmie was there too, he is Cindy's little brother, he is awesome, lol. Monica was there too <3, that's Cindy's older sister. She is really awesome. We go wayy back, haha. Anyways, we ate cake and she opend her gifts then we headed out for Coney island. Pat and Monica drove me, everyone else rode in the van. Yes, I know, I am cool. Haha, right.

     When we got to coney island it was pretty awesome, we all got changed and went swimming for a little. It was great. Eventually we rode the huge swimming ride things, lol. It was great. The ""funnyon"" ride was so fun. 

      Then we went over to the rides. Jimmie and I rode alot together. Katie and I also rode alot together. Katie is really nice, and cool, he had some fun times. Spitting off the faresswheel was fun too, hahaha. 

         So after Coney island, we went back to Cindy's for some Taccos. They were some good taccos. Then we all played some corn hole. Well, it got kind of out of hand because Pat threw a corn hole thing at my brother and they started fighting, like jokely...so then I came up and chucked one at Pat's back, lol, he got extremely pissed off. It was crazy. I felt bad for him, because his face was really serious and it must of hurt. I said sorry though, and everything was alright.  

       When we left Pat, Monica, and Joey, Ryan, and I had nothing to do on a saturday night. You know what that means? HIT THE STIP! lol. We drove around this East gate strip thing and yelled some crazy stuff at some crazy people. I guess it's like a natural phenomenon, that on Satuday nights alot of people just drive around in a big circle. We kept seeing the same people, it was awesome. There was this guy that looked gay and Pat kept yelling some interesting things at him, lol. Then there were these two ""rednecks"" That got pissed, and when we pulled over for gas. They also pulled over, and started yelling shit at us. So we drove away and made peace with them, because before that we were yelling alot of stuff at them, lol. Then, at the stop sign we met this crazy mexican dude, in a van. I was like, Hola, and he was like hola, then I started saying all the spanish I know, and he was like, Me grande pene, lol it was awesome. Besides those people we just had a bunch of morons going, YURRR QUEEERRR DEER DEERRRRR. lol, it was fun. The time came to like 11:48 and then we went to the All Saints fest. There was like, no one there, so then we just went to wendys for frosties. Then they dropped me off. Then Joey, and I got dropped off. It was fun shit. And that's about all of it. 



Well, later.

    Well since I got suspended, nothing really exciting has happend. I spent the entire day bored out of my mind, and watched porno too many times. Sounds like fun? Not really, by the third time, it became like a choir. Earlier today, Nesi and I were play isketch and I hear the doorbell ring. WHAMMY! Out of no where, Mini-chase and his black friend ""Whitey"" Show up. It was pretty sweet. They had their skate boards, and mine was just sitting out side, so I threw on some pants and we skated a little. That was probably the most exciting thing I did all day. Later in the day, I got Wendys and played some Halo 2 with Ryan...fun stuff.

Now, I need to go make friends with all you Lj people, lol.

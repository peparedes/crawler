"event","Heh.  I still want to be in a rock & roll band.

Though, obviously, I have too much on my plate.  Which is fine.  But I've been thinking about my influences and such - strong women who just kick ass and take names.

<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpYf29xa4qQ"">Polly Styrene of X-Ray Spex</a>  (And how one song can change the world.)

<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrHrkMhN5bY"">Billie Holiday</a>  (I should have to say even less about her.)

<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWMj5tJ9qHU"">Amy Lee of Evanescence</a>  (Same boat as Cristina Scabbia - she can sing, and rock at the same time.)  (And I do have to dedicate this song to what could have been.)

<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn3Cc6Iys_0"">Johnette Napolitano of Concrete Blonde</a>  (Plus, this is about to become my theme song.)

<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVyWjwfwA9Q&mode=related&search="">And just cause they rock so hard, here's another Concrete Blonde song.</a>  (Welcome to the world.)

<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlPj5c3j8XY"">Betsy Martin of Caterwaul</a>  (Her voice isn't the best - it fits the name of the band - but, again, she rocks out.)

"event","""Don't cry to me, if you loved me, you would be here with me.  If you want me, come find me, make up your mind."" - Evanescence, ""Call Me When You're Sober""

Damn, he's worse than a teenage girl.  Too in love with his own pain and martyrdom, with his own suffering, with his own misery.  Not in love enough with me.

That's it.  I'm sick of this shit.  It might be hard for people to believe, but I've got feelings too.  And once again, I've got to be the strong one while everyone else has their little separate breakdowns.  When is it my turn again?  When can I stop being the 'strong' one?  I'm due.  

Antigone has her issues, and she's working through them, but they make my addiction problem look like the plot of a sitcom.  Cowboy - I dunno, maybe he just feels left out of the whole 'messed up in the head' club and decided to generate stuff until he felt like he belonged.

Anyway, I can tell he's thinking of going to become some kind of monk.

So . . . .that's over and done.  Time to move on.  Monk = no sex, no love, no . . . fun.  Plus I'm not going to stand in the way of anyone's quest.  I've joined the Solomonists, and so now I understand that my hang ups and needs - while uniquely mine - shouldn't interfere with others.

Hopefully I find someone with a pulse.  Not really feeling like I want a little bit of ""turn me on, dead man,"" if you get my drift.

If I thought the Divine would listen to me, I might even pray."

"event","It's been a while since I've written here.  Things are proceeding at a pace quicker than I can describe.

The first major change is that I have ""become"" Scandal.  I don't think of myself as Bethany anymore.  Some may believe this is just some kind of ""better-than-thou"" affectation, but the truth is I've grown so use to thinking of myself as ""Scandal,"" that that's who I am.  

Things are moving slowly but steadily.  I haven't touched smack in 6 months, and control my drinking.

Sex life still sucks.  But perhaps abstinence can be good for me?  

I've been sort of kind of dating Cowboy, and I've gone on a date or two with other people.  I think . . . well, I know, actually, that I'm still figuring out what my mind wants.  I know what the body wants, but the mind is different.  Sex is good.  Sex is fun.  But sex without emotion?  Pointless.  (That's where, it seems, Antigone has gone.  And while I kind of advised Black Alice to take this path, it's because she's young.  Not that I'm all ancient and wizened, as much as she needs to loosen up, physically.)  

On the other hand, sex without emotion can be fun.  Not every act needs to be pleasing beyond the physical.  Abstinence and denial don't mean mastery - you can't tame a lion by pretending it doesn't exist or by ignoring it.  I know I've got my demons, and to master them, I've got to deal with them eventually.  

We're solidifying our cabal, and I was nominated to the leadership of the cabal by Antigone and Cowboy.  Granted, I wanted that position, but being able to get it without struggle, egos, or even mentioning I wanted it - that's good.  It's promising.  

If we induct Black Alice and Trapper into the cabal, we'll be a full Pentacle - one from each Watchtower.  That's got to be auspicious.  Maybe I should start to study the Arcana of Fate - foresee for myself what, if anything this might mean.  (It's not that I do not trust Antigone - I trust her quite implicitly - but there are times where I can't quite verbalize what I want.  At least when dealing with the supernatural.  Cowboy and Antigone focused more on the physical and real (in Cowboy's case) or on how to be a better warrior (in Antigone's case) - and in both cases it's good.  But I'm the ephemeral warlock - and the thearch.)

Speaking of which, my study of goetic magic has finally begun.  I have not yet been invited into the Key-Bearers, but Thompson has taught me the first of the Keys of Solomon.  In this case, it's called Solmonaic Authority - I harness my demons, and gain strength by making them weaker.  I need to become at least a second degree Adept before I can learn the next step - the actual conjuration and binding of these demons.  From what I can gather, I have two quite strong demons in me so far - they're related, like siblings.  Once I can master them, I can better master myself.  

I'm still nervous about approaching Cowboy to help me with my oblations.  It's the way of the Tower of Scourging - you need to prove yourself, and test yourself, and to do that, you need to use other people.  Not use, use, but test against them.  So I need to . . . well, do some things - tests of endurance, tests of skill . . .  And some of the oblations have kind of kinky overtones.  (Let's put it this way - imagine a kind of hardcore S&M session, where the ""bottom"" doesn't get to use a safeword.  To master the self, you have to lose control of the self.  Yeah, it's a matter of trust and experiencing real powerlessness.  And quite frankly, I don't trust most people this way.  I'm not even sure if I trust Cowboy.  Not like this - it's a scary thought.  So I'm going to work towards it slowly - games of skill, unarmed fighting, armed fighting, and then see where it goes from there.)

That was more than I planned on sharing here.  

Anyway, I've been planning our next steps - I'm not sure the Cabal as a whole would support this.  I'm not sure I'm happy about it.  I'm not going to spell it out here, not yet.  Maybe not even until the deed is done.  But if we're going to build a Consilium here, then we're going to have to take some drastic steps.  We need it to be stable - we need a leader, a hierarch, who isn't some glory hound.  That leaves maybe three people - and I don't want it.  That would be awfully presumptious of me.  Which leaves Omen or Thompson - because the third choice wants it too badly, and that makes me nervous.  Plus I'm still bitter about his protection.  

There is one path left open.  I don't like it.  I don't like helping our rivals.  We'll see how it turns out.

Later

"event","So.

How've you been?  Where've you been?

I've been to hell.  Literally.  But I'm getting better.

<lj-cut text=""Details"">
The first thought that came to mind - after my last little entry - was to go take care of that annoying vampire.  So I got Dan and Becky all ready, and we were going to hunt him down.  Except Becky vanished in the bathroom, and Dan passed out, and that left me all by my lonesome when Grayson called me.

I fought it off as best as I could, and managed to grab a stake as I left.  When I saw Grayson, I stabbed him.

He tried to kill me.

Okay, actually, there's a good chance that he actually <i>did</i> kill me.  I wound up in hell.  Not like a place of fire and brimstone, but a place of my own miserable creation.  I got to encounter two different versions of myself - one as a total waste of space junkie, and one as a total heartless bitch.  Neither really appealed.  I also encountered a version of Armando.  I wound up destroying all of them.

So I wandered around hell for a bit, and soon got told how to get out - which involved binding myself to this tower, so to speak.  Which I did.

Then my eyes opened, and Grayson was still killing me.  I thought about stabbing him, and sure enough, I stabbed him with my mind.  Which was cool.

He dropped me, and then Tommy - this old guy from the club - came in, filled Grayson with bullets, and told me we had to set Grayson on fire.  Which we did.</lj-cut>

So now?  I've been awakened.  I walk the path of Scourging - the path of the Iron Tower.  The path of the Mastigos.  This means I can do magic - mostly stuff with mind tricks and things like that.  And it doesn't matter if you don't believe me.  My friends - now known as Cowboy Dan and Antigone - have also been walking their paths - Cowboy Dan saw Heaven, he says, and met angels.  (No fair).  Antigone got sucked into a fairy tale.  All three of us are Mages - three different paths.  Three different ways of approaching the world.

Tommy (or Thompson) has been training me.  He's on the same path as I am.   He's also part of this group called the Silver Ladder - the mages who are in charge.  (Mages = those who do magic.)  It made sense, and I've been training there too.

Thompson has told me that each person has inner demons - but that its important for us to overcome them - to be better than our weaknesses would let us be.  I'm not sure I can do it, but I'm going to try.  He also told me a little bit about goetic magic - the art of summoning, defeating, and then binding one's own demons.  Sounds interesting - and it might be a cure for my addiction.  When I'm stronger, I can force the addiction forward, and make it go away.  Just another way of earning redemption.

I've been drinking less - my refrigerator at home actually has fruit juice and water in it, now.  I still keep beer and such there as well - the trick isn't to totally give up my addictions, but to rise above them.  To become stronger.  So I can have the occasional drink - but I can't rely on drinking.  I can't give in to the urges that keep me weak.  

Other things have gotten more . . . interesting.

So <s>Dan</s> Cowboy Dan said he loved me, which came as a shock.  I almost kissed him then and there, but now that I'm on this whole self-control kick, I reigned it in.  I mean, I'm not sure how I feel about him (it's complicated), but that was the first time anyone had said they loved me in a long, long time.  At least, not counting drunks at the Palace or the Lounge that would slur that out while trying to cop a feel.  

There's issues.  We're from two different worlds.  And I don't know if he'll ever be able to accept mine.

Like prostitution.  See, I don't want to be a prostitute anymore.  That was a mistake.  But there are still lots of women out there, working the streets, being treated like property and not human beings.  Prostutition is, as far as I'm concerned, a legitimate occupation.  It makes no sense that you can give away something but not sell it.  But on the other hand, the whole situation is just totally dirty at the moment.  <lj-cut text=""More thoughts on this."">  A city like Barlingtin runs on illegal things - drug deals, prostitution, things like that.  And people are getting hurt.

Right now, I don't trust myself to deal with the drug trade.  Thompson watched as I threw out my other paraphenelia - my pipes, my stash, all of it.  Does that mean I'm giving up pot?  Hell no.  But I'm definitely never going to just sit in my apartment and get stoned.  That's no good.  

But I know I can run a better prostitution business.  Without beating the women.  Without getting them addicted to drugs.  Without them having to worry about their own safety.  It's simple - I make the deals.  They perform the deeds.  They get 40%.  I get 30%.  The remaining goes into things like getting them health insurance, regular HIV tests, and hiring people who can protect them.  The girls make out fairly well - trust me, they aren't getting $20 from a $50 blow job right now.  They're lucky if they get 10.  So I double their money, take $15 myself, and the other $15 goes into the kitty.

Enough girls working for me, I can get the addicts into rehab.  I can get their health insurance covered.  I can get them living well - higher priced clients.  I can reclaim their sexuality as something they can embrace and use for strength, rather than something used to hurt them.  I can help them reach power.</lj-cut>  But I'm sure Cowboy Dan would never understand that.  And it's not his fault - he's got his own upbringing.  

I mean, in light of what I saw, I don't think I can deny the existence of higher powers.  But they are up there, and the rest of us are down here, living in our own personal hells.  To fix it, we've got to be strong. 

There's other benefits, too.  I can weed out the damaged johns.  The child molestors, the abusers, the rapists, the sickos - and, I dunno, either fix them or get them put away.  There's so much I could do.  I could find the children who are working - or in some cases, who are enslaved - and I can set them free.    

And as part of the Silver Ladder, I need to lead.  I need to take charge of something, and show that I'm the boss.  This gives me that as well - my own little empire.  That I can run fairly, ethically, and somewhat morally.  Plus, chasing the pimps out of the business is another bonus.  

The other thing is stealing.  Cowboy Dan and Antigone both have problems with that.  (Antigone has problems with the prostitution idea, too.)  But it's just stuff - and I've seen enough people who have lots of stuff who don't appreciate what they have.  I mean, sure, I stole some diamonds - but them sitting behind glass doesn't do any good.  Diamonds are to be shown, and admired, and treated well.  I've stolen other things as well.  (I do recall that Cowboy Dan didn't have any problems when I stole that jacket for him . . .)

I'd never steal from someone who couldn't afford it.  I'd never steal from the poor.  I'd never steal from a mom & pop store.  But from a chain jeweler's store?  From a business as dirty as the diamond business (which makes prostitution <i>as it is right now</i> look totally clean and benevolent)?  Sure.  I don't want to piss my friends off, but I'm still not sure they are ready for my world - or the real world, for that matter.  I can only try.  Stealing is just another way of getting stuff.  

But, at the same time, Cowboy Dan is a sweet heart.  And he's sexy in that rustic macho man kind of way.  He's seen 'the goods,' before, and while I'm not embarassed by it, I'm not sure if he is or not.  But . . .

He's seen heaven.  I've seen hell.  Maybe we need to balance each other out.  

Nothing ventured, nothing gained.  So yeah, we have our date.

I'm kicking myself for not kissing him when I thought about it - I think that could have spared him some humiliation.  Why was I such a bitch?

<lj-cut text=""Other thoughts"">
<u>Other Thoughts</u>
<ol>
<li> I need to work on getting our cabal focused on making allies.   </li>
<li> We also need a name.  Right now, there are three of us, but ""The Trinity"" sounds overly bad.  ""A Cowboy and Two Babes,"" while funny, is just tacky. </li>
<li> I need to study this goetic magic thing more. </li>
<li> I don't know why I can't just let Antigone be.  I guess its because she's like a sister, and I want to make her better.  I still want to protect her, or at least save her from herself. </li>
<li> This city is a mess. </li>

Until a later date, au revoir.

"event","It could have been just a fun romp in the sack, a little kink, and then off we go.  It could have continued like that, and I wouldn't have felt so violated.

What happened may as well have been rape.

<lj-cut text=""Here we go."">
So when hunting down A . . . whatever the fuck her name is, the chick who tried to drop everyone off in the haunted ghost town, the one Dan was macking with - - - anyway, I found her at Bound, a fetish club in the downtown area.  Since I know the right people . . .

We don't need any money
I always get in for free
You can get in too
If you get in with me

. . . I got in.  Not a member, really, but hey, I put on a mask, no one knows me.  I see Grayson actually talking with people, being sociable.  So I ignored the way he made me feel creepy before - I figure sometimes first impressions aren't the best.  

Never mind the creepy dreams I've been having.  Never mind the . . . other things that happened. [1]  I had things to do.  Like walk up to . . . Cherry (it's what she called herself here) . . . and let her know that we were back, and that she was on my shitlist.  It was all about making it look nice - no need to get the bouncers looking at me funny, no need to make her bleed, just let her know that when she and her buddies left my friends and I to die in the woods at the hands of what was out there, she crossed a line.  And I didn't care about her excuse - this was serious shit.  

Plus, killing her or hurting her was petty.  Keeping her alive for later use - that was of much more use to me.  And much more use to my friends.  And when I find the other seven mother-fuckers, they're going down as well.  

(Let's be honest, if I wanted to kill her, I could have slit her throat and been out of the club so fast no one would have known who it was.  But that's pointless - once you kill, you don't go back, and other people come looking for you.  Either cops or friends of the vic.  Not my scene.)

Anyway . . .

I went back to Grayson's table.  He told me about a modelling gig (and yeah, I'm probably going to take it), and then bought me a drink - a whiskey sour - which I pretty much inhaled.  Then came another, and he moved closer, and kept touching me in nice ways, and being generally flirtatious, and before I knew it, we were heading back to his place.

Remember when I said my sex drive had come back?  Well, we got to take it for a little test spin.  Okay, actually, a pretty big test spin.  I don't think sex ever felt as good as that did - even when I saw his fangs and he bit into my neck.  

Yeah, you read that right.  Grayson is a vampire, apparently.

Well, why the fuck not?  There are ghosts and zombies.  And something called a maych, or something like that.  I dunno - heard the word, no idea what it is, but people said it like it was really important.

Anyway, the biting thing, while normally a bit more hardcore than I go for, felt good.  I know he drank my blood, and I didn't want him to stop.  But, soon enough, we fell asleep.  

He was as cold as ice when I woke up.  Totally unmoving.  I helped myself to a shower, ordered room service, and hung around in one of his robes.  After a few hours, I realized he wasn't going to wake up - and the only reason I really stayed there was because it felt rude to just leave.  But when I did, he had a <s>cab</s> car (actually a limo) ready for me.  I took the ride home, got ready for work, and got there in time to start my shift.

Oh - while I was gone, there was some disjointed message left by Becky.  I called her back, and whatever emergency was going on was over, but she sounded really down.  I told her to meet me at the club later that night.  Seems she and Jonathan had a fight.  I couldn't really deal with that at the moment.

So the night was good, I got tipped well, my favorite new customer (this old guy who tips well, doesn't try to touch, and actually helps keep the slimeballs off of me) was there, and it was a generally good night (other than the lecture about drinking that I got.  I'm getting sick of that.  These people are never satisfied, are they?)

Anyway, we found Jonathan, I spoke to him, he was pissed because he saw Dan and Becky kiss (like he has any right to - sure, he may have been carrying a Statue of Liberty sized torch for the girl, but snooze, you lose, bunky - not that I said that.  I'm 'nice.'), and he wouldn't be sensible.  And neither would Becky.

I come back to Becky, and find out somehow, in the fifteen minutes I was gone, she managed to pick a fight with one of the bigger organized crime guys in the city.  And she won't listen to me when I tell her to just not take that bet.  Apparently, get this, they were going to duel.  </lj-cut>

Yeah, I'm off track.  A lot happened.  After my work at the Palace, I got a call from Grayson, asking if I wanted to come over again.  And I might have, but Becky was there, and really, unlike most of the world, I don't run out on my friends.  So I declined, and told Becky we should just hang out for the night, watch scary movies, eat chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream, and other misery food, and just ignore the rest of the world.

<lj-cut text=""But, of course, things go weird."">
Next night, we went back to the cemetary for the 'duel.'  On our way, I ran into the old guy customer from the club, who said he knew about this and was hoping to stop it - me, I totally agreed with him.  But Becky still wasn't listening.  The old guy and I (and Becky) spoke for a bit - he said his name was Thompson, and talked about being in two wars.  I thought, I dunno - Korea and Vietnam, maybe?  He couldn't be more than 70.  

Anyway, he told us some more stuff that, at this point, I wasn't going to doubt.  Stuff about stones with souls in them, and how if you get them, you can ask people to do things - that is one thing sticking in my memory.  I gotta get me one of those stones.

As the duel started, Becky finally apologized to Papa Crow, and we could leave, without any blood being spilled.  Which to me was the most important thing.

Oh - I should bring up that Papa Crow sat on a throne made out of what looked like human bones.  I jsut want to make this clear - I don't care whether or not he had them, it was that he <i>wanted</i> na throne of bones I find most disturbing.

Thompson drove me home, and that was fine.  As soon as I get home, though, I get this urge to go back to Grayson's.  Like, out of nowhere.  So I call up his driver, and soon enough, I'm back in the dude's apartment and I'm getting rode pretty well, and suddenly he bites his wrist open and tries forcing his blood into my mouth.

I say no.  He grabs my throat and chokes me until my mouth opens, and then he forces me to drink his blood.  I don't know what kind of shit is in there!

I go leave, when its all over and he's lying dead again, and just get out of there as fast as I can.</lj-cut>

So far, things are fine.  The sun isn't hurting me, and I can hold this cross I found just fine.  But I'm going to put a stake in his fucking dead heart, and then when that turns his body to ash, I'm going to spread them all over the city.  Maybe most other girls will get cowed by him forcing us to drink his blood - but I'm not most other girls.  I'm sick of being abused - of letting myself get mistreated.  And I've seen that other people can stand up on their own.

It's my turn.

It's not murder when the person you are killing is already dead, right?

"event",". . . gonna end up a big old pile of them bones.

I've been stressing the past few months, and I don't think I can take it anymore.

I can deal with the supernatural shit - the ghosts, the weirdness.  Even Tony's babbling about invisible chi cells or whatever that's in the bloodstream - sure, it sounds like madness, or at least superstition, but it's his beliefs.  That I can deal with.

I just can't deal with life anymore.  Not straight.

Nothing makes sense.

<lj-cut text=""Here's why"">
I quit using heroin.  You all know that.  I quit because of my friends - or at least, because of people who I thought I could respect, who I could lean on when it got tough.  Now, it's not that simple, and I'm out here alone.

I don't even know how to tell them without seeming needy.

For starters, they all go home 'to' somebody, and I come home alone.  Even the fucking cat left.  Tony goes home to his family and his Samwell.  Becky's got a house-full of servants, Jonathan, Dan, Molly, and Midnight.  Dan's got Becky and Molly.  

I've got no one.  Not like that.  I could call my folks, but its been two years, and I'm still not sure how they'd react when I called them.  

What sucks more is that my sex drive has come back - hard.  Now that I don't use smack, I want to fuck so bad it hurts.  Ironically, now that I no longer sell myself, I can't get laid.  Isn't that sad?  Or ironic?  Or something?

Why did they nose into my life?  Why do I care if they respect me?  Why do I care if they like me?  All they did was come in, mess everything up, and then leave me to handle it on my own.  I'm not that person.  I hate the fact that everything hurts, and when I do something to make it not hurt, they all look down their noses at me.  Things were fine - sure, I used heroin, big fucking deal.  I didn't shoot up, I had a good supply, and damn it, I was happy.

Now, I'm miserable.  

I got no one to cry to.  No shoulder to lean on.  Tony is too distant (plus he might be pissed about the stabbing and all), Dan and Becky don't understand (I'm happy they got together (and if they think I don't know, they shouldn't have blushed so hard when I asked them what they had been up to.)  ), and . . . that's all I really know right now.  I'm not close enough to any of the other girls at the Palace, hell, I'm not close to anyone.

Being straight really sucks.  All I got left is my pride.

And that's going soon enough.</lj-cut>

Each day, Alexa's number looks better and better.  Just one more fix.  I've really got nothing else left in the world."

"event","I just saw what I put up there earlier.

I'm so full of shit.  The reason I'm afraid is because yeah, I'm an addict.  I have to admit it.  I've been caught and stopped before I had a chance to make too big of a mess of things.  I know 'Mando meant well, since I was really in a lot of pain when he met me.  I'm talking actual, physical pain.  And he gave me the hook up that made that all go away.  And that's why I'm grateful to him.

But me - I let it get out of control.  I got high before meeting my parents.  I said things I shouldn't have.  I get a fix every day - sometimes several fixes.  There are days where I'm uselessly sitting on my apartment floor, letting the time go by because the junk makes that the best choice.

So maybe I shouldn't go back.  This isn't to prove a point - it's because I'm an addict, and I have to recognize that.

Either way, this is going to suck.

I just hope that when I'm straight again, they are all still my friends."

But my new friends - Dan, Tony, and Becky - have this huge problem with me using heroin.  

I can quit anytime I want.

And to show them, I'll quit right now.  Then go back to using it.  

Or something.

Look, I've got a lot of pain - and that makes the pain go away.  Tylenol doesn't do it.  Opiates do.  It's simple.  And hey, I'm a doctor, I know what I'm doing.

Maybe that's why I'm so afraid of this."

"event","At night, after working the club, you can feel if the night is going to be different or special or . . .

. . . or just the night.

I shook my ass for a good two-twenty, split it 50/50 with the tip jar and myself, and that's still over a hundred going in my back pocket.  Not bad.  Not bad at all.

First thing I did was call Armando, and see if I had any late night/early morning work.  After he said no, and told me that I had a night or two off, I went back around the club to wait for Butterfly and Peppermint to be done.  They had been chatting, and Butterfly was trying to help Pep remember <i>why</i> we did things a certain way.  So I'm in the back, lighting up a cigarette and thinking about the horse I'm gonna buy the next morning, when this big uptown car pulls up.

Some guys pull out another guy, punch and kick him a few times, and throw him into the back of Axeman's Alley.  

There are some neighborhoods where I would have called for help.  Axeman's Alley?  Not the place.  The only reason I even went back there is that most of the scum know I'm under Armando's knife, so they leave us working gals alone.  (Those that don't are soon told about the extra protein thrown into the Barlington River about a year ago.  That guy was high profile - all new and shiny - and no one has fingered Armando for it yet.  If he can do that to an uptown guy, street scum ain't nothing.)

Anyway, I scooted into the alley, knife in my hand, just in case.  All of us girls who work for Armando know how to slash and stab - it's needed, before he lets us work. Even the safe johns can get unsafe, and you never know what may happen.  So I scoot there and see - well, I see a whole bunch of hick, all bloody and bruised, and maybe even a bit broken.  

He wasn't out for the count, but he wasn't going back in the ring either, if you know what I mean.  

<lj-cut text=""And the adventure continues"">
So the guy helps me walk him to a taxi, and I'm thinking, what the fuck am I gonna do?

I can't leave him there.  He'll get killed and ass-fucked and all sorts of things that he probably doesn't want to have happen. I mean, sure, he's kind of dressed like one of the Village People, but even that guy probably didn't want to get pumpkin-headed[1] by some stupid crackhead.  

I can't take him to the hospital.  Car like that means guy with connections.  Guy with connections might decide that this guy living isn't what he wanted after all.  Guy with connections can then send someone to finish the job.

I can't take him to my place.  Armando has made that clear - no boyfriends, no girlfriends, no nothing to interfere with the job.  He's techy about Secret and I sharing a bed, and trust me, nothing's gonna happen between she and I.  But bringing a man into our place?  

Well, I think fast, not well.  We got into the cab and I took him to my place.

Guy mutters his name - Dan - and seems to get a bit heavier in the elevator.  Five floors up, my place, and onto the couch.

After I got out of the more uncomfortable stuff I had on, I put a few towels down on the couch, looked him over, and did what I could.  Would have been easier if I could have gotten a fix before then, but Secret and I were running low, and then the stupid bitch took the last hit.  So hands shaking and feeling like the devil himself just kicked me in the stomach, using nothing but the first aid kit I saved from the car I used to have, I patched Cowboy Dan up the best I could.

I seemed to have remembered a whole bunch of stuff, if I do say so myself.

Anyway, cowboy was definitely asleep when I was done, which was good.  I pulled myself into bed and woke up only when Secret asked who our guest was.  I forgot what I said, but her in the bed was comforting and I fell back asleep quickly.

Woke up with her arms wrapped around me a bit too tightly.  She's got goals - and I guess I'm one of them - but like I said, it ain't happening.  I don't care what her agenda is, I'm not that kind of person.

She woke up and left while I was showering, which suited me fine.  She had been a pain in the ass, especially after some guy gave her this nice necklace.  Really nice.  Too nice.

I mean, we make enough between dancing and my work fulfilling fantasies to live well enough.  We're downtown, but not in the worst part of the city.  The apartment is in decent condition, good security, and no roaches.  The water turns clear after only a few seconds, and I've never had a problem with heat in the winter.  Oh, and we have air conditioning.  So who am I to bitch?  The landlady, Miss Ellington, is only kind of evil.  

But still, a necklace like that?  Wearing it?  You may as well have ""mug me"" taped to your back.  And ""rape me"" taped to your ass, while you're at it.  

It's the kind of necklace you hock first chance you get.  The money has better uses.

Cowboy Dan was up, walking around in his all-together - though with a hat and boots on.  Seemed like an odd combination, but I dunno.  He looked a lot better off - less bruised and yellow - than I saw the night before.  I thought maybe he couldn't find his clothes - I had to take them off to patch him up - but I let him know I was there.  It's only polite.

After some confusion (he talks like someone from a movie or one of those books my dad used to read by . . . um. . . Louis Lamur, or something like that), I volunteered to go get him some stuff - I was heading out to get my own treat for the day, so I figure it was only polite.

I warned him about Miss Ellington, Peppermint, and Armando - in that order.  Miss Ellington would probably jack up our rent if she thought we had another roommate, Peppermint would want to ball his brains out, and Armando - well, Armando might undo all the work I did from the night before.

I stopped by the corner store, got some supplies, popped over to Alexa, got some better supplies, and then went to Subway.  Got Cowboy Dan a big all meat sandwich, myself something more varied, and then went home.  Gave Dan his sandwich, went to my room, and went to go ride Prince Charming's big white horse.

After a few minutes of bliss, I went out to be around with Dan, knowing I was still heading towards the peak.

The thing about smoking heroin as opposed to shooting up is that the high comes on early - after about ten minutes, you're there.  And then you go down, slowly, over the next few hours.  There's no marks, no tracks, no blood, nothing - which is good.  (See, with shooting up, you've got to put some blood into the needle so that the hot melted shit can get into your veins without burning them.  I have no idea who figured this out, but the motherfucker was a genius.)

I don't know why I'm so nervous about people finding out about the drugs.  I guess it's that you never know who is going to turn you in, and who wants to give up on you.  It's like, unless you're a junkie, you've got no idea what its like, and you can't even begin to talk about it.  It's not that we're suicidal - its just that nothing matches the high.  Not even sex.  

Trust me on that last part.  Then again, that might be why I get paid for sex but not for using.

Anyway, I went out to try to talk to Dan more.  I'm pretty sure I pulled it off - I'm good at not being spotted as what I am.  I've even carried past a few cops - and trust me, that's one that'll make you nervous.  It's not like grass.  You get caught with little enough grass, they'll just take it and send you on your way.  Even a tenth of a bag of heroin, and it's intent to deal and then that's it.  Me, I don't want to be in the clink, so I rarely walk around with the shit.  Pick it up, go home, drop it off/hide it, and then go on my merry little way.

Eventually, Dan said he wanted to see our big beautiful city.

I'll talk more about that, later."

drop those needles even though they're clean baby doll you don't need that junk no more.
beautiful stones roll down those green green hills and nothing but the sounds of birds will wake you.
let it all slide down let it all wash down with a cold glass of something pure and maybe you can hear the waterfalling splish splashing outside your window clear
window fogged
window glass.
if you're asking me questions i'll just have to nod and deliver you everything as it comes as it falls out of my jumbled head and into the air before me, let it's kiss hit your ears and leave the lipstick marks across the skin.
it won't burn i promise.
i'm too nice to ever hurt you. but i'll certainly confuse you, oh i'm sorry things won't make much sense.
but if you stop looking for the sense in all of this then maybe you'll see how beautiful and wonderful and magical everything really is despite the horrible things you'd see if you'd turn your head around.
so don't. just look at me. just let it all wash down with a glass of water and put your face to the cool of the window glass you fogged with your heavy sobbing breath.
it will be ok, it will be alright.
just listen carefully and let me be your guide-dog.
i'm sorry it can't make more sense."

The things I gave 
Like the taste of my kiss on your lips 
I miss that now 

I can't try any harder than I do 
All the reasons I gave, excuses I made for you 
I'm broken in two 

All the things left undiscovered 
Leave me empty and left to wonder 
I need you
All the things left undiscovered 
Leave me waiting and left to wonder 
I need you 
Yeah I need you 
Don't walk away 

Touch me now, how I wanna feel something so real 
Please remind me, my love 
And take me back 
Cause I'm so in love with what we were 
I'm not breathing, I'm suffocating without you 
Until you feel it too 

All the things left undiscovered 
Leave me empty and left to wonder 
I need you
All the things left undiscovered 
Leave me waiting and left to wonder 
I need you

Dreamin' that you'll walk right through my door 
It's then I know my heart is whole 
There's a million reasons why I cry 
Hold my covers tight and close my eyes 
Cause I don't wanna be alone 

All the things left undiscovered 
Leave me empty and left to wonder 
I need you
All the things left undiscovered 
Leave me waiting and left to wonder 
I need you 
I need you

And I can't hate 
But it's my heart that's about to break 
You're all I need 
I'm on my knees 
Watch me bleed 
Would you listen please 

I give in 
I breathe out 
I want you 
There's no doubt 

I freak out 
I'm left out 
Without you 
I'm without 

I'm crossed out 
I'm kicked out 
I cry out 
I reach out 

Don't walk away

=====================

<b>""It's Not The Side Effects Of The Cocaine. I Am Thinking It Must Be Love""- fallout boy</b>

Why can you read me like no one else?
I hide behind these words
But I'm coming out
I wish I kept them behind my tongue
I hide behind these words
But I'm coming out

Put your hand between 
An aching head and an aching world
We'll make them so jealous
We'll make them hate us
An aching head and an aching world
We'll make them so jealous
We'll make them so jealous

All the ways you make my stomach turn
And all the long drives
With my friends blur
And I wish I kept them inside my mind
I hide behind these words

And think of all the places
Where you've been lost
And then found...out
In between my sheets
In between the rights and the wrongs

Put your hand between
An aching head and an aching world
We'll make them so jealous
we'll make them hate us
Aching head and an aching world
Think of all the places
Where you've been lost and found...out 

=======================

like the time when the clock read 11:11,
you said ""make a wish"" 
so i wished that we'd never go our separate ways
or say a thousand bitter things
but now i see that wishes are nothing. 

======================

I always loved your beautiful smile 
The sparkle in your eyes, and the funny things you'd do 
I'm sorry that things turned out the way they did 
I'd do it all again, for another night with you 

======================

You can stay and watch me fall, 
and of course I'll ask for help.

======================

Sleep won't come without effort tonight.
Not while your likeness haunts my mind.
You'll never know how I dig my own grave
Wondering what you're doing at this moment;
If you imagine what touching my hand feels like.
Tired of seeking the cool side of my pillow
I don't want to be alone and washed in tears.
A dim reflection paints a sleepy eyed picture of you,
Fractions from what it should be, I won't ever see you fast asleep.
I love you so dear that I'll never tell you. 

============================

I think I've read this book before,
hardbound shiny cover, pretty colors.
But an ending that's sure to disappoint.
It's not what you'd expect when you open the box.
And all the things you'd wished you'd find,
fleeting and taunting, colors drab and ordinary
to the brilliant white of not knowing what's inside.
But how can I bear to behold that dream now?
That my eyes have adjusted to the concrete walls of this box that I've opened?
And I know I'm more than just a little fucked up, 
but I'm trying to make my way back home. 

=============================

Immobilized by the thought of you.
..Paralyzed by the sight of you.
.....Hypnotized by the words you say.
.........Not true but I believe 'em anyway.
-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-
......So come to bed it's getting late.
....There's no more time for us to waste.
...Remember how my body tastes.
You feel your heart begin to race

============================
some song from rent...meh.

There is no future -- there is no past
Thank God this moment's not the last

There's only us
There's only this
Forget regret or life is yours to miss

No other road no other way
No day but today

I can't control
My destiny
I trust my soul
My only goal is just to be

Will I lose my dignity?
Will someone care?
Will I wake tomorrow
From this nightmare?

Without you
The hand gropes
The ear hears
The pulse beats
Life goes on
But I'm gone
'Cause I die
Without you
I die without you
I die without you
I die without you

There's only now
There's only here
Give in to love
Or live in fear
No other path
No other way
No day but today
No day but today
No day but today
No day but today

=====================

<b>yellowcard - inside out</b> 
Here. A little sympathy for you to waste on me
I know you're faking it but that's okay
And I don't want to drag it out
Don't want to bring you down
I never wanted it to end this way

Even if I wanted to
I don't think that I'd get to you
There's nothing I can say to you to make you feel alive again

Here. A little jealousy
I hope you think of me
Hope you wonder where I sleep at night (sleep at night)
Cause I feel like I'm inside out
You got me upside down
Maybe I was holding on too tight

Even if I wanted to 
I don't think that I'd get to you
There's nothing I can say to you to make you feel alive again

So don't just say goodbye to me
Just turn your back away and leave
And if you're lucky I will be your last regret, your only friend

====================

<b>i'm lost without you - blink182</b>
I swear that I can go on forever again 
Please let me know that my one bad day will end
I will go down as your lover, your friend
Give me your lips and with one kiss we begin 
Are you afraid of being alone
Cause I am, I'm lost without you
Are you afraid of leaving tonight
Cause I am, I'm lost without you

I'll leave my room open till sunrise for you
I'll keep my eyes patiently focused on you
Where are you now I can hear footsteps I'm dreaming
And if you will, keep me from waking to believe this

Are you afraid of being alone
Cause I am, I'm lost without you
Are you afraid of leaving tonight
Cause I am, I'm lost without you

Are you afraid of being alone
Cause I am, I'm lost without you
Are you afraid of leaving tonight
Cause I am, I'm lost without you
Are you afraid of being alone
Cause I am, I'm lost without you
Are you afraid of leaving tonight
Cause I am, I'm lost without you

I'm lost without you
I'm lost without you

friday i got called into the personal care home. which pissed me off, but whatever. i made moneys.
then i went home, and then went to work at the golf course.
then i went to see jarred.
and im drawing a blank suddenly.
OOOH i went to the gasbar and met up with jarred and dan, and then i saw tyler and alex driving around with a hockey helmet on top of alex's car, and talked to them for a bit, and then donna and jeff came, talked to them, then we eventually went to 3 mile.
party! w00t w00t.
started drinking, then kahleigh got all sad, so i helped her out, took her for a few walks and such.
then fucken desmond started fighting with darrell over tiffany. what a fuck head.
desmond fights with ANYONE.
ugh.
so once that was over, more things happened, i got a litle drunk, jarred got drunk too...lol
we stood around after a bunch of people left and listened to oasis.
yaaaaay oasis!
champagne supernova is a wicked song.
so after that was done, most people left, b/c it started raining, so then jarred and i took a pleasantly tanked danny home and he ended up telling me later that he puked alot after that..lol
then jarred and i went and did something that topped wednesday by far.
mainly because, as sappy as it sounds, he told me that he wanted to actually ""make love"" for once, and i think he planned to put ""colorblind"" by counting crows on repeat.
it was perfect, and ridiculously orgasmic.
he told me that was the first time he actualy realized that he really was in love with me, and just how much.
he told me that when he told me he loved me, that he did mean it but he was in love with the things i do, and how i am, and my personality, and how i made him feel, and what not
and friday pushed him to realize that he was in love with <b>me.</b>
yay!
so then i went home.
called him on the way home too.
weeeeee.
saturday i worked, which was cool.
got to work with stacie.
she's awesome.
and super cute.
she told me her boyfriend was like, ""oh, so you're working with paula eh? guess i'm sleeping on the couch tonight then.""
lol.
at work devin and alex and some guy i didnt know showed up, devin snorted some sugar straight out of the sugar thing. then he proceeded to head to the bathroom to blow his nose. lolz.
they came back later and played a g.i joe boardgame in the conference room.
then tyler and i had a conversation about s&m conferences. dont ask.
we also mentioned making s&m custumes out of toothpicks.
the minty cello wrapped kind.
after work i went to find michelle, which i failed at doing.
ran into tyler, alex, devin and scott, whom i kept calling ""the other guy""
it was funny. he reminds me of my other friend scott.
devin wrote ""i am stopping"" on my tail lights.
it was fun.
then i walked to the social thingy with them, and devin was walking weird.
fuck that kid is funny.
then i got to the social, and i'll write about this later.
i need food and sleep.
adios!"

A Marine stationed in Afghanistan recently received a ""Dear John"" letter 
from his girlfriend back home. It read as follows: 

Dear Ricky, I can no longer continue our relationship. The distance between 
us is just too great. I must admit that I have cheated on you twice, since 
you've been gone, and it's not fair to either of us. I'm sorry. Please 
return the picture of me that I sent to you. Love, Becky 

The Marine, with hurt feelings, asked his fellow Marines for any snapshots 
they could spare of their girlfriends, sisters, ex-girlfriends, aunts, 
cousins etc. In addition to the picture of Becky, Ricky included all the 
other pictures of the pretty gals he had collected from his buddies. There 
were 57 photos in that envelope....along with this note: 

Dear Becky, I'm so sorry, bu t I can't quite remember who the F*** you are.

"event","<u><b>white days - the juliana theory</b></u>
rise before the sun 
we'll leave when it lifts 
the show must go on 
so we start on the run 
buy us meal 
or buy us some time 
if we want to arrive there 

look ahead at the road 
you can't see a thing 
but maybe we'll make it before it's too late 
there is no time to wait 

turn, turn on the lights 
as they drive by 
worked on the side 
keep your eyes on the road 
hands on the wheel 
don't let us slip 
this is almost a nightmare 

turn, turn on the heat 
they can't feel a thing 
as i fall asleep 
keep your eyes off the white 
don't let us die tonight 

white days like this i'll never miss 
they only come once a year 

feel the passing of day 
where nothing has changed 
night has determined to force us away 
buy me a room 
with bed and amuse this is almost resourceful 
stop, don't hit the breaks 
they don't do a thing 
we made it to nowhere with no time to spare 
no one said life was fair 

white days like this i'll never miss 
they only come once a year"

This is all just a line in some cliche divine book.
I'm broken, I've been bleeding
But all I am is yours. 
there is nothing in my way this time
and nothing in your headlights but an empty road and feelings that you can't give up.
so keep driving
hold on
and all of this will be worthwhile.
there are some things that are worth the pain
worth all the blood that is swept under the bridge
and this is one of them
so keep driving
you've got nothing in your headlights
all you've got is an empty road and feelings that i won't let you give up.
fingers dancing across keys and bringing the music for tonight
staring up into a sky as song flows out of my everything.
you're making me sing, making me ignore the buzzing in my ear
and all i can do is think of how lucky i am
so we'll keep driving
there's nothing in our headlights and nothing on this road
i won't let go if you won't
and we'll keep this empty road to ourselves and watch the night sky fly by
all i am is yours
and all we are is stars in the sky,
we just happened to collide.

"event","Things you have to believe to be a Republican today:

Saddam was a good guy when Reagan armed him, a bad guy when Bush's daddy
made war on him, a good guy when Cheney did business with him and a bad guy 
when Bush needed a ""we can't find Bin Laden"" diversion.

Trade with Cuba is wrong because the country is communist, but trade with 
China and Vietnam is vital to a spirit of international harmony.

The United States should get out of the United Nations, and our highest 
national priority is enforcing U.N. resolutions against Iraq.

A woman can't be trusted with decisions about her own body, but 
multi-national corporations can make decisions affecting all mankind 
without regulation.

Jesus loves you, and shares your hatred of homosexuals and Hillary 
Clinton.

The best way to improve military morale is to praise the troops in 
speeches while slashing veterans' benefits and combat pay.

If condoms are kept out of schools, adolescents won't have sex.

A good way to fight terrorism is to belittle our long-time allies, then 
demand their cooperation and money.

Providing health care to all Iraqis is sound policy. Providing health 
care to all Americans is socialism.

HMOs and insurance companies have the best interests of the public at 
heart.

Global warming and tobacco's link to cancer are junk science, but 
creationism should be taught in schools.

A president lying about an extramarital affair is a impeachable 
offense.

A president lying to enlist support for a war in which thousands die is 
solid defense policy.

Government should limit itself to the powers named in the Constitution, 
which include banning gay marriages and censoring the Internet.

The public has a right to know about Hillary's cattle trades, but George 
Bush's driving record is none of our business.

Being a drug addict is a moral failing and a crime, unless you're a 
conservative radio host. Then it's an illness, and you need our prayers 
for your recovery.

You support states' rights, which means Attorney General John Ashcroft can 
tell states what local voter initiatives they have the right to adopt.

What Bill Clinton did in the 1960s is of vital national interest, but what 
Bush did in the '80s is irrelevant.

Feel free to pass this on. 

If you don't post it in your own journals and communities, we're likely to be 
stuck with Bush for 4 more years.

Friends don't let friends vote Republican."

<u><b>Seventeen</b></u>
Good morning, today i am seventeen, so i bought myself a chainsaw and seventeen new reasons to hate you. 
but i, though cold, could never hate you, so beautiful 
Can't you remember watching the sunrise? 
Listening to the buzz of a cheap phone and your steady breaths. 
I stared out my window and you stared out yours, 
Today I am seventeen.


now here's this year's birthday.

<u><b>Eighteen</b></u>
Here comes the sunrise, yesterday was my last day of seventeen. Sleep has escaped me and I fear I will not wake up feeling one year older. So I'll buy myself the snow and another night without sleep, and eighteen more reasons to hate you, and maybe this. I'll pull in my breath and think to myself how much I honestly love you. 
Because I, though cold, could never hate you, so beautiful.
I'll stare out my window with my foot against the gas, you'll do the same.
Today I am eighteen."

and i saw my grandma today, fragile and barely able to breathe.
my mom told me that i had to say good bye to her.
meaning i'll probably never see her alive again.
i started to cry and said i didn't want to say good bye. because i don't.
as much as she made me feel weird around her and such, i'm gonna miss that lady.
i love you grandma.
sleep softly for me.

the buying of the new pants was to make me feel better.
hence the mention of them before anything else.

Pulled the hair back from her face to let that smile heat this place.
And this feels so far from real.
I'm lost and I love it.

I can't take it, if you're waiting.
I am ready to tell the world about a girl
who showed me love again for the first time.
And it's everything I dreamed of.

Tell me what you thought about when you were breathing oh so loud,
screaming oh so loud.
Tell me if this is real.
I need to know before I get too close.

So here we lie in this beautiful mess of tangled sheets and beads of sweat.
With my heart in your hand and my neck in the other,
Should I be scared or should I come closer? 
But it's still beating and I'm still breathing.
You haven't hurt me yet.

Morning always comes too quick when you're around, when you're around.
You leave me lying here so they don't find us out, they'll find us out.
Tear me open at the seams, take everything you need.
Take my heart if you like the beat,
take my lungs if it's hard to breathe.

<lj-cut> yeah these are what i wish i could say to that damn boy. and this is all that's really happening. like i always say, there's a song for everything. and i mean that. gawd everything needs to stop or come together and start making sense.</lj-cut>"

You said you'd follow me
Can you find me?
See my backwards backbone broken basic masquerade
Oh, watch these sins fall from my eyes
You can't take what you've taken on
Now nothing feels like what you wanted
Can you see me?
Did you touch her?
I don't believe you can you tear it all away?
Now, something isn't right here.
Someone's lying it's not me and -
Can you look at me in the eyes
No not my shoulder not your shoes
Tell me all that you've done boy
How can you close those eyes and try to sleep so peacefully?
How could you kiss my mouth after you kissed her..
I know what you've done
You said you'd follow me
You said you'd follow me
Can you find me?
See your backwards backbone broken basic masquerade
Oh watch these sins flow from your lips
You can't take what you've taken on
Now nothing feels like what you wanted
Can you see me?
Did you touch her fuck her was she sweeter than me?
Someone's not right here someone's lying here
Lying naked in your bed it's not me and
Please wipe that grin off of your face."

"event","And nothing I do will change your mind this time.
This has got the potential to be destructive at best.
And you could be the Heartbreak Kid...
But my darling you mean absolutely nothing to me.
(watch my teeth as the lies are pushed through)
I've made falling a habit
Collapsing a way of life
And sweet nothings end up meaning everything to me.
So baby if that's so,
Then you must be the nothing I'm holding onto.
And <i>nothing</i> is easy to let go.
(catch the double entendre?)
My darling you mean <i>absolutely nothing</i> to me.
My darling you mean <i>absolutely nothing</i> to me.
If I repeat it to myself,
And remember it by rote,
Maybe it won't be a lie anymore.
Nothing is easy to let go.
You mean everything.
But you're my sweet nothing.
But that's just it.
You're Nothing to me.
And Nothing is easy to let go."

<i>""our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we. they never stop trying to find new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we.""</i>

what a retard.
and now, for your pleasure, something i haven't done in a while!
the posting of a depressing poem!

<b><u>Boy Girl</u></b>
He is a boy.
And no one is home.
Never is, and seems like there never will be.
He can't see through his baby blues
Theyre squeezed shut, squeezing out his deepest wishes, fears, dreams.
Evaporate before they hit the floor
No love has ever been borne on the end of a bullet
At the end of a rope.
Only arrows from a little boy who does not exist.
Seventeen years wishing only for that arrow
From anyone, for anything
He is a boy,
And no one is home.
Nor will there be.
All alone he tastes that which has never been fired
His baby blues squeezing out his greatest wishes.
And his fears.
Shaky now, can't lose his courage
All alone,
He is a boy.
And that fire means just that.
He is a boy,
And always will be.

She is a girl,
Holding onto a blackened rainbow
Candles in her room to dim the lights
Burn her reflection dulled, opaque attempt at perfection.
She feels so weak
She's skin and bone
Nothing to hold but a ribcage and limbs
Yellowed teeth show her faith
in a porcelain god to which she kneels and leaves prayers and offerings torn from deep within her.
She wants to be beautiful
She cries, tries to be beautiful.
Her chocolate eyes swim in an ocean of lonely
Lost forever.
She is a girl,
Holding onto her hair and her blackened rainbow.
No ugliness has ever been borne in a bathtub,
Nor has any love.
No violence, 
Only perfect solitude.
Raazor thin veins run through her tiny wrists
Weakened, barely able to run away.
Bathwater so hued to make a stop sign turn green
Enviable courage while she's breaking her skin
Twisted smiles or looks of remorse
As her chocolate eyes go swimming
She is a girl
Holding onto her blackened metallic rainbow
Drowning now but not gasping for air
All the color from her once rosy cheeks now floating about her
She is light, no spirit to drag her down
She bites her tongue, she is free
She is a girl,
And always will be.

Rejected a thousand tomorrows
Fragile smiles gone away,
For them there will never be a today.
Troubles within through their eyes 
Are no more
Glassy eyes and cold skin
Never finding the warmth they needed
Instead they have run away
And now they are free.
He is a boy,
She is a girl.
And forever they will stay that way."

"event","hmm...
some thoughts prang to mind after reading close_the_door's journal. someone died on sunday. and it was very very sudden.
and reading what she wrote about celebrating everything she has has made me think. i mean, i have been celebrating everything i have and attempting to live my life to it's fullest as much as i can, enjoying everything that life has to offer and what not, but am i really truly living it?
i mean, what am i doing with myself?
i might just drop tomorrow and have accomplished nothing.
on the upside of all thise philosophical stuff i talked to some of the old people at the personal care home today on my first day of work. it was definately an experience. i had a conversation in french with a lady who might just be crazy, but at the same time i know she has seen alot and what she's seen will still show through in her eyes. and some of the things that an old man told me today kind of made me realise just how lucky i am. i also talked to a kid about my age with downs syndrome. he is always so happy and personable. it makes me smile to know that someone who knows so little can be so happy with himself. he's such a great kid.
i dont know. maybe it's the fact that i've been pretty introspective lately, maybe it's the fact that things have been happening to make me think, or maybe it's the fact that i finally found some sort of something to believe in, but i've been appreciating the little things alot more lately. aaah life is good. i may not have a significant other, or be doing exactly what i want to be doing, but i'm still living one day at a time and i'm happy.
that's more than i could ask for.
so whomever reads this, take some advice from me.
enjoy everything you have. even if you think everything is shit. it probably isnt all that bad.
smile at someone you don't know. 
and for goodness sakes, if you're rude to people you don't know, stop it. everyone be nice to everyone today.
it's made me a lot happier.

celebrate everything.
and remember that i love each and every one of you.
<3








and on a side note, i think i have a crush on a girl 2 years younger than me. le gasp!"

"event","i went to arborg for hump day yesterday. if you dont know what hump day is, then ask away. i've no time to talk about it right now.
i went with amber mandy and amanda. we bought our summerfest tix, then we ran into jarred=) and then we went to gimli. went to subway, then bought ice cream after some cruising, walked up and down the boardwalk, cruised some more while listening to franz ferdinand and the beastie boys, oh yes. and then we went back to arborg and stuck around the gas bar. man that place hops when theres nothing to do. if people know you and you're there, they stop there and eventually theres like 15 people sitting around shooting the shit. it rocks. i wish fisher branch wasnt so lame.
then we went home, went to nicks. nick was being...reminiscent. (we used to date)
and then i went home.

"event","ok so i've been dealing with this lack of computer thing quite well i think. if i busy myself out of my house, i should be fine. although i do keep thinking about random things to stick in my journal but i can't ;_;
i went to garrett's yesterday, hung out with him and brandon, did some history for garrett.
then after dinner, who calls me!?
MEADSTER!
it was crazy cool.
so i went and got her and we drove around
then we made out
lolz
and i went home
and watched some weirdass movie called ""to die for"" with nicole kidmann and joaquin phoenix. it was uber strange, and i didnt get it but i think thats because i really only watched the last half an hour.
then i watched ""feeling minnesota"" with keeanu reeves and cameron diaz...that was a fucked up movie.
i liked it alot, but whoa fucked up.
 i found out that that toby guy who weirded me out used to be a mennonite. got booted off the colony for rebelling and then spent 2 years in a mental institution. thats why he so odd.
but yeah...summerfest this weekend...i need a place to crash.
my birthday party on the 14th, hooray celebrating a day early due to the 15th being a sunday!
but im gonna go send out my party email.
later kiddles...hopefully i get my computer back soon!"

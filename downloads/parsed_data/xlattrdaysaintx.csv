allthough my physical condition is worsening, my heart is full, its a strange but wonderful feeling. my mri is when i come back form NC, so like 2 weeks, well see what that finds, anyway, im also stoked i had a long talk with josh too, we talked about stuff (i thought that he was mad, dont ask, im just paranoid) it felt good to know that everything was ok with my best friend, its weird, i think the fact that there are so few people that i share my feelings with, that the ones i do share them with, its magnified, i dunno, it sounds corny, i just really value our friendship, he going to be my best man at the ""big"" wedding, and he asked me to be as well, so that rocks. anyways, zelda comes out this week too, its gonna rock!and the game boy advance sp rawks the heezy fo sheezy! if you dont have one, get one!! anyways, enough for now, im going to lay down, take care ya'll, peace out!"

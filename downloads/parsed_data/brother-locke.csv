Well to those of you who aren't close enough to me to see my every move.. I'll try to sum up what's been going on in my life for the past several weeks.

Woot.. I have a girlfriend now who I am quite elated with her.. though the relationship is still young and primally sexual still.. I hope the rest of the relationship develops or it will wither and die like all physical relationships do. I really just wish I could spend more time with her.. but I guess that's the breaks for dating a girl who is still in college.

I finally let go of my job at Tower records.. what a relief too.. and from what I have been still hearing.. I got out just in time. Lots of bullshit and politics... two things I like to stay away from. My other job is going well.. I got my friend Shawn a job with me there, so far he seems to be enjoying the *perks*. lol

My relationship with Suz over the past few weeks has started getting better again. I'm trying to continue to pay her the money I owe her.. its a slow process tho... Thanks for understanding my slowness Suz.. :)

I haven't been keeping up with my brewing since I moved in to Todd's place.. I really need to get back into that.. but I lack some crucial elements to brewing beer.. and I lack the cash to go buy the supplies.. I'll get back to it as soon as I can..

Speaking of money.. I really need to organize my expenses and get myself a bank account. I'm going through money at an alarming rate.. and saving none.. good way to have a shitty life ahead of me.. ugh.

I've quit smoking.. on my 3rd week.. I really need one bad.. but I'll supposedly be healthier for it.. and smell alot better.. lol

Well.. thats all I can think of for now.. I'll try and write again soon..

"event","<lj-cut text=""Well.. it has been a very long time since I have posted anything to LJ or even Myspace for that matter.""> I really haven't had a whole lot of personal time for myself. I've pretty much been working myself to death between working at CMI and Tower. I just started at CMI this past week doing courier work for them. I'll be driving into Philly everyday it looks like. It is kind of nice tho, some of our clients are WMMR, WMGK, Rock School, and U of P. These are at least the major ones that I'll be going to on a daily basis. CMI is a printing company out of Great Valley right off of Rt. 30. The pay is much better than Tower, and unfortunately for Tower I won't have the time to devote to them as a Supervisor.. so it looks like I'll be going back to being a peon. I think everyone will be happy about that since I believe they all think I am a work nazi. Ya well.. I was just doing my job. Whoever fills in my place will realize that... and they can deal with the bullshit of people not wanting to work.

This past weekend I put together how many hours I worked between Friday and tonight.. grand total comes to 40 hours. Not too shabby. Can't wait for these paychecks to start rolling in. Luckily both jobs pay schedules are staggered. Once again I will be getting paychecks every week. Should help with not being broke all the time.

Looks like I am locked into moving in with my buddy Todd. Both Jason B and I will be living with him. Should be realyl interesting. I like both guys and I think we will have alot of fun. Now I just need to find the time to pack and move in by around the first week of January.

As for everything else.. my friendship with Ken seems to be on the rocks. Working as a supervisor over him has been testing to say the least. Ken.. if you're reading this.. lets get back to basics man.. this tension between us has got to stop.. its doing neither one of us any good. I consider you a brother, and yto be perfectly honest, I'd rather spend my time with you than I would my own brother. I have no grudge against you, I just think working together has put major strains on us both.. and lets face it.. its not worth it. It may just be the one reason that would make me leave Tower records.

As for other things going on in my life.. there's really not a whole lot to say. I haven't had any time for fun stuff other than hanging out with Barry one night at the Barbary in Philly... brings me to another good point. John's Dark Corner is having an X-Mas bash that is FREE. IT's at the Barbary in Philly... so go you fuckers. It'll be a good time. :)

My love life.. well.. ain't much going on there in any sense. Its probably for the best.. and I'm not really sweating it. All things will come together in time and thats the way its going to be for awhile. lol.. jokingly Johanna and I made a pact to get married in like 10 years if we don't find anything better. Let's hope it doesn't get that bad... for either of us. ;)

I just happened to walk through the living room earlier and my brother and father were watching that neighborhood wives program.. (whatever it is called) and I overheard the program talking about trust. Basically it said the same thing you have heard a million times.. but this time it realyl struck a chord with me saying something to the affect of how trust is awesome till it is lost, then it can never be gained again. Some people choose to only trust themselves because it is the easiest way. Made me think of someone and it really made me sad.

""I hate you""
""Talking to myself""
""Everbody's staring at me""
""I'm only Bleeding""

Sometimes I wish I had a time machine to make things right again as they should be.. but I guess hindsight is 20/20. All I can do is look to the future and learn from my mistakes. Part of the reason I have 2 jobs now and its not because I want to work that much, but rather I want to make myself comfortable.. get my savigns up, possibly buy a house. My parent's are at the end of their lives and its up to me to make sure I can live on and make a life for myself... and hopefully for someone special. I am dedicating myself to this purpose and I just need to do whatever it takes to make it happen.

"event","So I've been aching for the past few years to get a few piercings, and as of now I think I have decided what I want to get..

Libret
Tongue (Still in deliberation on this one)
Both nipples. (Don't have a whole lot of sensation there.. might as well.)
Frenum (I've always thought this one would be pretty wild.. and I'm not really keen on the idea of piercing straight through my member.)

I'm still thinking about what I should do with my ears.. but it'll probably be standard.

Grand estimated total.. $210..

Now I just have to save up the cash."

"event","Well its been an interesting week I must say... started off pretty good with Suzanne's B-Day. I bought her a David Bowie box set. She liked it even though she alredy had some of the disks. Had a good time at her birthday party with no upsets. I think I feel a little better about my relation to her now. I feel as if I can be her friend as long as she is willing to accept my friendship. (Which it seems she is.) So all on that battlefront is going well.

Had a really weird sunday night... I'm not going into it, but it was just one of those nights you never see coming until it happens. It was quite pleasant even tho I kind of felt remorseful afterwords. I imagine its post-relationship remorse for doing something that I wouldn't have normally done while I was in a relationship. (I know.. I'm being vague and cryptic.. its a habit of mine.)

Yesterday at work tho was a real kick in the teeth.. I admit.. I was wrong in what I told Johanna.. I should have never said she could stand to do some pilates.. and it only escalated from there. I hope she will somehow forgive me, and I hope Crystal will forgive my mouth also. I crossed a line and I shouldn't have.. [insert foot into mouth now]

Anyway.. I did end up getting some good news yesterday afterall. My brother got an e-mail from a friend stating that a temp agency is hiring people to work in Vanguard Financial Group's call center. The job pays double of what I make now and from what people at Vanguard are telling me, is temp-to-perm. A good friend of mine started working there through the same agency. NO MORE TOWER RECORDS!!!!! WOOOOOO!!!!! I don't think I have to mention the benefits of working for Vanguard.. most people already know and have been trying to get into that place for awhile. Of course it has its downsides.. but hell.. for $14 an hour.. I'm willing to endure.

Wish me luck.."

"event","Well sorry I haven't been around in a long time. My internet usage was cut back by my brother seeing as to I went to a non-porn site that loaded my mother's computer with spyware. What a mess. Totally innocent site that had some beer recipes and wham.. it loaded my mom's PC with like 400 instances of spyware. I'd use my own computer but it was taken totally out of commission when my Ex *accidentally* dropped it down a flight of stairs onto a nice concrete floor. When I finally got to it the case was bent, the MoBo circuit board was broke, and my two 120 gig hard drives had crashed. Needless to say, it was pretty much fucked.

I digress tho..

So the past two weeks of my life have been pretty close to being a living hell. I've successfully fought off hundreds of bouts of depression.. some ranging as small as just sitting at work wishing I had a job that paid more to huge bouts that hit me as I am going to bed where I devise huge plans of how I am going to exit this world. The latter usually ends up keeping me up till just before I have to wake up for work. The cleanest most efficicient way of suicide I have decided is large amounts of alcohol and full containers of sleeping pills. Silent, and you will never feel it... you go in your sleep and no one is the wiser.

Having said that.. I realize the ramifications of all of my actions, so I don't plan on committing suicide, but it just goes to show you how depressed I have been. I should put those pictures of myself and Suzanne away.. but I just can't bring myself to do so. Afterall, I still love her and have extreme feelings for her. I just want her to be happy in whatever she does... even if it costs my own happiness. Her Birthday is coming up on October 1st, she'll be 26. I am hoping to see her because I want to give her the b-day present I got for her, and some of the cash I still owe her.. I had planned on getting her MotorHead tickets.. but for some reason Lemmy postponed the show. It would have been on Oct. 2nd. I had a dream that I had gotten her favorite singer to show up at Shock! just for her.. was kind of funny how I got him to do it.. but I know it would have been something she would have just died for. Oh well.. mayhaps some other year."

"event","So I'm doing the normal firday things at work when I get a call from my mother who sounds as if she has been crying. She proceeds to tell me that my father has been admitted to Montg. County Hospital and he has cancer. She asks me if I will come straight home from work. She explained that she didn't want to be alone in the house tonite. I instantly tell her yes, and she agrees to pick me up from work.

I'm not sure you can imagine the thoughts that go through your mind when information like this is given to you.. I am sure alot of you can.. but I was feeling that it was a bit hard to contain while standing up at the front counter. I made my way back to the back room of Tower and from there just sat down at a table in the back. I put my face in my hands and just plain lost it.

At times you may hear me bitch about my father.. and it just may seem that I hate him, but I deep down inside could never truly mean it. He is my father, my blood, and a man who has spent many thousands of hours behind a desk and or various other places working diligently and unfaltering so that my family would have a place to live and food on the table. In many ways it sometimes astound me that I see his very self in me.. being good or bad.

Well anyway, I knew I had leave work.. so I called Jim and he told me it was alright to leave since Joann was closing with me. I called my mom but her phone had died through her many phonecalls and I decided to call Andy.. (Andy has always been there for me.. he's like a brother to me.) I asked Andy if he could give me a ride over to the hospital and he said he would be there as soon as he could. We got to the hospital and I found that my dad was in room 7 of the emergency ward. I get into the room and my mother was there with my dad. Of course they were surprised to see me.. but how could I not go? Turns out that my father has had cancer in his small intestines for quite some time and it has now spread into his liver and kidney. For now nobody knows what is going to be done..

Well I stayed for awhile, long enough to see him be put into Rm 241. The nurse was nice.. though my family has seen its fair share of not so nice nurses and I could tell my mom was a little apprehensive. I hope my father has a good night sleep for once.. the pain meds should help with that much better than a few beers or a bit of wine.

So now I sit at home hearing my mother upstairs on the phone talking to all the various relatives and I feel this extreme urge to talk to anyone. I look at my AIM friends list and it seems pretty dead. I keep thinking about calling Suzanne. She was one of the few people that I could really talk to.. but now would just seem strange and most likely cold. I called Ken earlier and he is somewhere in Maryland. Heck, Joanna even told me to call her.. but lets face it, she probably won't answer it anyway. It'd feel weird talking to her about this anyway, she doesn't seem like she would care, but would just love to jump right on in using it in some sort of perverse attempt at teasing.(Edit- Not that I do not welcome it.. grr.. stupid me.) It all boils down to the root of my depression and just feeding it more and more. 

I sometimes do truly believe that if it wasn't for bad luck, I'd have no luck at all."

I believe the tunnel my life travels through has reached that dark curve where the light at the end of the tunnel has faded. I am enveloped in the cold blackness that is my life. People as a whole have lost the inner light that leads my way.

I find that I am my own demon, I haunt myself, I torture myself and the person in my head is not me. I see people.. and mainly women as just flesh. I can only guess that this spawns from the events that have unfolded in recent months.

I am now more paranoid than ever.

I no longer want to feel this way.. but as the cold of the fall and winter months approach, I feel my own heart following the same path.

I want to stop thinking about women.. but yet this insatiable lust inside me drives me to long for porn only desensitizing me further.

I have a problem and I now fully acknowledge it. Amazing.. it only destroyed all of my relationships with women, and friends. I've tried to abstain.. but yet my subconsciousness takes over and I become this monster that no one truly wants to be around. I sense it as if it were ESP.. but really it is just common knowledge if you look at it in the right light.

If only I had health insurance I would look into therapy. This addction/obsession is going to either kill me, or drive me insane."

"event","Well.. its been many years since I've owned my own vehicle and been able to drive. Recently tho, a co-worker's fiance (And friend) had pointed out in the area of King of Prussia a 1986-87 Ford Bronco II for $600. At first look, the vehicle is in pretty good condition. No rust marks in the wheel wells or on the body.. very good, because I really don't want a vehicle that is going to rust out in a year. A few things I noted the first time looking at it tho, was the back crash bumper was rusted through. this would be easy enough to fix just by going through a few junkyards. The interior was in well enough condition.. only thing really notable there was the dashboard was cracking slightly due to weathering, and the passenger side door was taken apart. (Found out later that was due to some electrical problems in the door.. again, easy enough to fix at a low cost.)

That night I first looked at it, I talk to the man who was selling it and he informed me that he would actually let it go for $500. The problems he told me about was a pretty large oil leak somewhere above the oil filter, and it needed a new water pump. (Water pumps are easy to replace and will probably cost about $30 to by the new one and I could replace it myself. He said the tires were still good and had recently been replaced.

So today with some help from Greg we went to go look at it again. I had called Greg because he owns a Bronco and has had alot of experience with them. I trust his mechanical abilities also. Not too mention I haven't hung out with him in quite some time, but that is a story for another post... or even possibly at the end of this one.

So we both went t olook at it and he had pretty much said the same about the body as I had said preciously in this post. We opened up the hood to take a look at where the possible oil leak was and it looks as if the valve gasket is the source of the leak. Of course this is just at a glance without actually diving to deep into looking at the engine. We'll figure it will cost anywhere up to $200 give or take to fix this if I went through an actual mechanic. Overall he said it was a pretty good deal for $500.

This brings me to a new issue.. one I have been avoiding since I got my license back. Insurance. I called Geico to get a quote to figure out in what ballpark I was going to be. They quoted me somewhere around $650 every 6 months. Ok.. $12-1300 a year I can deal with.. sure is alot less than I had expected to pay. :)

Tomorrow I'll be talking with the Bronco's owner again to set up a time later on tomorrow that I can actually kick the engine and go for a test drive. This will be the deciding factor on if I buy it or not. I'll have to see how the suspension handles, see if the 4x4 works. I'll also be listening to the engine to see if there are any other problems I can detect. If all goes well, I'll be looking into buying it within the next 2-4 weeks. *crosses fingers* 

Its been so long now and I really need a mode of transportation again, even if I have to put a little extra work into it. Life will be much more easier to deal with.

As for hanging out with Greg.. I'd have t osay, he is one of the friends that I identify with most easily. Only problem is, is that he is much like a hermit or so it seems. Funny part is that when we talked today, he said he actually has been getting out alot more in oreder to meet more people. Turns out that much like myself, he doesn't identify with our immediate group of friends. He's not punk, he's not Goth, and he hates to be depressed. Therefore he puts distance between himself and friends. There were a few other things that he mentioned.. but I can't remember them off the top of my head. All of which is how I feel. I think I'll be trying to hang out with him and our other friend Sean a little more. Maybe all of us together we can meet new people and start another ring of friends. We'll see.

I think I may get tickets to go see Journey in concert with him. (Ya, I know alot of you are moaning about that.) Oh well.. I kinda liked Journey and Greg is a pretty big fan. Guess its the cheese factor in me.. oh well.. to each his own.

Well.. my fingers are tired.. there is much more I have to write about my interactions and feelings about my recent break up with Suzanne... I still feel like I made a huge mistake.. and for the worng reason.. but its a strong feeling in me to go sow my wild oats... and I'd rather not have cheated on Suz in order to do so... and I couldn't go on living unhappy without any final ""conquests"". (I use that word very loosely as its a correct word to use, but it doesn't quite hit the mark.)

Well.. for now, I'll continue to pay pentinence for my mistakes and hopefully I'll forgive myself for them."

"event","Started off pretty smooth.. but as we all knowm life can go from paradise to hell in about 30 minutes flat. Mine just happened to do that on a lunch break that Suz came to see me on. You figure when someone tells you they will most likely have plans to go out one night, that they will usually follow through with them. Well, Suz had some iffy plans to go out to dinner with an ex's ex-wife and her new boyfriend. (Ya, I know.. it took me a moment to write that all out.) Well, since she had plans I decided to make some plans with another friend for the evening, a guy's night out. It was innocent enough, we were actually planning to hit an old strip club that we used to go to in Conshohocken. A ballet if you would. :P 

Well, turns out that Suz had decided that she really didn't want to do this, and wanted to hang out with the guys instead. I really didn't want to full out say that we were going to a strip club, because that never really goes over well. Well, lets just say this created some heavy tension, and suddenly i was cheating on her again in her mind. Now, at this point any respecting person would just say what they were going to do, but in my mind I have this mental block that restriccts me from being too communicative. I don't necessarily like to hand out all of the small details of my life or my doings. As Suz would agree.. I'm very suspicious. Not to mention I make girl friends crazy because of this. Its happened before.. it happened again. You would think I'd have learned by now.

Anyhoo.. So to make a long story just a tad shorter, I broke up with her. I absolutely love her with all my heart.. but for the sake of both of our pride.. I had to let her go. I didn't want to see her the way she acted that day ever again. Even she would say it was pathetic and that she never meant to react that way. I didn't help one bit.. I acted like a complete ass to her.. and good lord do I pay a high price in pentinence for my actions. I'd have to say that I have never felt quite the same. It stirs feelings in me that I can't even begin to explain, but I will tell you that I would not qish them upon even the worst of enemies.

Last night I went to Dan and Jess's home warming.. it was good to see everyone that had shown up. Nick, Bridgette, and Murphy were there. Now, they all seem to believe after my first break-up with Suzanne, that I am just not a good person. (Or at least these are the vibes I have gotten from them.) I'd have to say that when I had first arrived I could just feel the loathing in the air. It was pretty thick, almost as if walking into a small bar where there was standing room only and everyone was smoking. For the first half of the night, not one word was exchange, even tho I had said hello to each one of them when I got there. The second part of the night there were some vocal exchanges, but the only one of them that had even started a conversation was Murphy. That felt pretty good and kind of cheered me up a bit. Afterall, I hate losing friends, for any reason. 

Ugh.. so much in my head, and so little time.. I'll try and continue this later.. but for now I must go to work. If you are scratching your head after reading this, than I am sorry.. my mind is not working quite as well this week and somethings may seem jumbled.

Till later..

I'm feeling a bit adventurous. I was going through the Explorers group reading their entries and now I feel like going and exploring something. Suz is not necessarily happy about this because I don't really think its something I'd like to do with her merely for the fact that if something were to happen, I don't think she could get out fast enough. I do want to hang out with her.. I just don't feel like ""hanging out"". I want to do something. Maybe I will go for a walk and exploire some of the uninhabited buildings close to home. They won't be anything to fun.. but it might just be enough to get rid of some of that adventurous blood out of my system. Too bad I don't have a digi camera.. I'd share some of my adventure.

Anyone happen to know of any good abandoned factories, warehouses, farmhouses or insane asylums close to the Philadelphia area that are good to explore? I've already done the Pennhurst thing.. and tho it is cool.. I've done it way to many times already.

"event","Plenty of sleep in me, but yet I am hazy this afternoon. I woke up sometime after 1pm with my mother telling me that I should wake up and be apart of the world. I made one phone call to a friend and they weren't answering their phone. Somehow I didn't expect them to, so I left a message and figured I'd check out my livejournal friends. Looks like SSDD.

I should call Suz soon.. I told her I would call her when I woke up and I really don't think I am awake quite yet. Physically my body moves, but I still feel like I am dreaming. Who knows.. maybe I am. I can only attribute the way I feel to the lack of sleep from the prior couple of days.

Last night I hung out with Suz and Ken.. started off sitting on my porch. There was an awkward feeling in the air.. call it boredom, could have been the fact my father was sitting in the living room and he could hear everything we could say... but I just needed to get out of there, so I suggested a walk and the possibility of going over to Andy's place and chilling in his hot tub.

(Where the heck did I put that ashtray.. damn.. sorry for the interruption, but I know I put it somewhere.. I just had it in my hand a second ago.. or is that still part of the dream..)

Andy and his parent's have been inviting me to their hot tub for some time now, but I always kind of feel weird about using it.. mayhaps deep back in my mind its kind of taboo.. who knows.

(Ahh.. there is my ashtray, seems I picked it up and set it right back down without even thinking about it... so much for the dream theory.)

So we started walking over to Andy's place.. Along the way we smoked up.. of course Suz was on edge about doing that.. the possibility of someone seeing us kind of haunts her,, but I assured her that I have smoked much more incriminating things just walking around my parent's hood.

So indeed Andy was home and he was just watching TV. We went to sit out on his porch where the hot tub was and there his dad was sitting in the hot tub smoking away at his hookah (Tobacco.. mixed with fruit.. afterall, his dad used to be a Sheriff.) in his normal nightly ritual. He looked like he was quite comfortable where he was. Andy brought out a few beers and Ken decided he wasn't going to try Andy's last Lonestar beer.. so of course I quickly grabbed it up and started drinking it. The state beer of Texas is described by Andy as being a like a sweet Michelob... I'd say he is pretty on with that description.. but its quite better tasting than you would think. I noticed the cap had a red and black star on it, so I decided to save it to give to John at work. No idea why.. 

So after awhile of talking, Andy's dad decided to get out of the tub. I remarked we should hop in. Andy told us to go ahead, but he wasn't getting in. No one else seemed receptive to getting in, but it could have just been they felt weird like I did, but this didn't stop me anymore.. it called to me. After a little more persuading, we decided to go ahead and get in. So off came the clothes.. well except for the boxers and we all hopped in, even Andy gave in to the temptation.

Jet streams of hot water hitting your ""troubled areas"" of your back is absouletly divine. My body thanks me this morning. I think we spent close to 2 hours in the hot tub, drinking, smoking, and chatting. If I could do it everynight, I would. Actually, Andy told me I could use it anytime as long as I called beforehand. Maybe once it gets closer to fall/winter.. I will. I've always wanted t osit in an outdoor hot tub while it was snowing hard. Only problem would be getting out.. heheh..

Overall, it was a great night to start off my two days of no work. I can think of one thing that would make it better.. but I doubt that will happen.

Anyhoo, I really need to call Suz.. so I think this is where I will stop typing.. Till the next interesting thing to share.. I bid you adieu.. (or however you spell that.)

Peace.."

The man who interviewed me was a talll black gentleman who was almost as jovial as Santa Claus. Thank god too, becuase I was nervous waiting there in the reception area. Turns out I was a week early.. (Doh!) but he said once he finished his meeting, he would see me. 

Turns out that the position is for just a person who works with and watches over the kids. The shifts are rotating, and are 12 hr shifts. On the good side, that means that I'll be on 4 days, and off for 3. I know they will hit me with alot of overtime, which really doesn't bother me. I think I would really like this position better than working retail. At least it is rewarding trying to help out others who have strayed from their positive decision making. (Not that I had alot of luck with that growing up.)

We'll see how it goes.. he told me I should hear something within 10 days.

On the bad side.. if I do get this job, I'll have to leave Tower Records.. and I do like working there... I just get paid less than I have ever been paid in my life.


On a side note.. I found out that St. Gabes had never been a monastery as I had long thought. It has pretty much always been run by the Christian Brotherhood. I have still yet to ask about the graves across the road."

The Israeli poet Yehuda Amichai wrote that ""The soul is a search; the soul is a dance of searches for whatever is lost."" Let that be your guiding thought in the coming weeks, Scorpio. The astrological omens suggest that it's high time for you to go looking for a missing treasure. The best way to ensure that you find it is to feed and praise and give free reign to the part of you that you call your soul."

Gotta love a job that has fringe benefits like free CDs. Turns out that today they gave us all the album ""The best Blue Note Album in the World"". Got home, slapped both CDs in Suz's CD player and started listening to it while playing <a href=""http://www.angband.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/zangtk.html"">ZangbandTK</a>. Pretty relaxng and there hasn't been a bad song yet. Go figure.. Tower just may get me to open up my music tastes even more."

1. I never went to college. (I can still go, but the fun won't be the same now.)

2. I am not a spring chicken anymore and I am in a relationship.. so I can forget picking up all those young beautiful women.

3. I can forget being a porn star for the same reason above. (Although I could do the Randy Spears gig and screw all the new up and coming stars.. anyone want to try it?  lol.. j/king SVera.. :) )


lol.. can you tell that I am a sexually driven person?

Face it 
Nobody owes you a living 
What you achieve or fail to achieve in your lifetime is directly related to what you do 
or fail to do 
No one chooses his parnets or childhood 
but you can choose your own direction 
Everyone has problems and obstacles to overcome 
but that too is relative to each individual 

NOTHING IS CARVED IN STONE 

you can change anything in your life 
if you want to badly enough 
Excuses are for losers 
those who take responsibility for their actions 
are the real winners in life 
winners meet lifes challenges head on 
knowing there are no guarantees 
and give it all theyve got 
and never think its too late or too early to begin 
time plays no favorites and will pass whether you act or not 

Take Control of Your Life 

If you arent willing to work for your goal dont expect others to 

Believe in Yourself."

"event","Oh lordy lordy, look who creeped outta the woodwork to write a post. It's been ages. I have a minute to sit and think, so I figured it would be time well spent to write a nice, long, and thoughtful entry. Mmmkay.

Well it's been basically a full year since I last posted. The living situation is wonderful, the roommates are great, and we have three lovely little kitties that make me smile every day. I work at a small interactive company in Dupont and couldn't ask for a better job location. I enjoy my coworkers, and I am trying to reconcile my disdain for my creative director, but overall it's a great place to be. Single, not really dating, but open to a relationship. So that's a lil ole nutshell. 

Let's see. BURNING MAN. Life altering and mind blowing and all of these amazing things that are extremely difficult to verbalize. I feel a creative force field around me at all times. My desire to create is fierce and I don't fear failure. Working on the Money Badger iAd, building sets, using saws and drills, problem solving under a pressure cooker of a timeline, these were all crucial components to my creative evolution and I wasn't even aware of it until I went to Burning Man and found the missing piece to the puzzle. There doesn't need to be a reason or purpose for artistic endeavors. Human nature drives us to create, re-think, evolve, and explore. Necessity is the mother of invention, and when items are crucial for a society to thrive, designers and engineers will step up to generate useful products and ideas. However, one doesn't need to address a specific societal demand in order to create something meaningful. Building a giant mechanical octopus that shoots fire (El Pulpo Mecanico) servers no greater purpose than to simply awe and entertain. AND THAT IS ENOUGH. Now that I recognize the importance of awe and wonder and entertainment, I don't feel guilty about seemingly frivolous creative exploration, such as daily chihuahua sketches. 

I'm very much interested in marrying my artistic, design skills with car mechanics, circuitry, and robotics. Phage's brain art car is quickly becoming a reality. The group has found a way to build the car, and I will continue to help with any design/sketching required to fuel the fire. Matt Faulkner and David Brown's tesla coil concept was thus far warmly greeted by the Phagelings, and it was great to work with them in generating a rendering. My new housemate has a ton of tools and expertise with mechanics, so I am hoping to devise and build some type of mechanical/artistic structure, perhaps a segue-esque speaker holder? Daily chihuahua drawings will be making a comeback after this weekend is over. I have one other time consuming watercolor endeavor for my mom that will be occupying my time for approximately two more weeks. 

Last night I met a fellow Burner who lives in DC. He invited me to a DC Burners group on Facebook. I really want to make an effort to attend these local Burn events and connect with folks. I miss the Phage crew dearly, but I am trying to resist the urge to up and move to SF and instead establish a local base of like-minded folks. 

It's all very exciting, but I have to be careful not to burn out. I already feel drained from the past few weeks of extreme output, combined with my workouts and dieting. 

On that note, the weightlifting has been going along WONDERFULLY. Once I finally got my shit together and decided to track my weights, squat and deadlift HEAVY, and write down my progress, things started to really progress. 200lb squat and 210 deadlift currently. I can do 8 chinups and I was using 50lbs for bentover row the other day. I know I can do way more, it's just a mental game for with the squats. It's very exciting! I train less now than I used to, but I train smarter and am able to make more progress. I got a food scale to weigh things out which helps me with portion control, and I track calories with MyFitnessPal. So far so good. If I can lose even 0.25lb of fat per week, that's great. I want to increase strength and grow my glutes and hamstrings. It's pretty awesome, and tracking things helps a lot. I find that my IBS has been way better now that I manage portions and make sure to eat more fiber. Apples still really hurt my stomach but I can't seem to not eat them. They are delicioussss and cheap! Hokay. That's about all for now. Time to go to Allentown to visit mama for her birthday!! Hooray hooray.

"event","I just watched a documentary about Gloria Steinem and her role in the feminist movement. Very interesting. I must say I struggle with my self identity as a female, since I have what I classify as masculine traits. Maybe they aren't as much masculine, as they are distinctly NOT feminine in the traditional sense. I also have been pondering why when a female exhibits masculine traits, and is considered ""one of the guys,"" she is perceived in a positive light. However, when a male exhibits feminine traits, it is typically viewed negatively. The male is called girly, a ""pussy,"" or subject to mild but unquestionable ridicule. I find myself inadvertently, or sometimes purposefully, molding myself to be a ""guy's girl"" because in some way I don't relate to stereotypical ""girly"" girls, and feel that the better alternative is to essentially take on male qualities and fit in with the boys. 

Gloria Steinem had a quotation about women who are authoritative being perceived as bitches, or something along those lines. It reminded me of an article I read ""gas lighting,"" which was basically when men downplay women's emotions and accuse them of being too emotional/irrational/crazy, effectively nullifying the female emotional response and making the woman feel that she is reacting in an outlandish manner, when in reality she's simply voicing her opinions/concerns. This whole idea intrigues me because I feel that I'm outspoken at times, and I find myself censoring or sugar-coating my words when I think they may be taken as too authoritative by a male. I do this with men and women, but I distinctly feel the need to apologize for my thoughts and feelings when I explain myself in a direct manner to men. Specifically this manifests itself in my interactions with Ilan. For example, I told him I was watching the documentary and that recently I had an increased interested in Feminism. He said, ""oh boy..."" to which I immediately began to back peddle and say, ""but don't worry, I won't be all crazy about it."" Looking back, there was no need to explain myself. All I mentioned was an interest in a historical movement that directly pertains to my sex. Upon hearing the slightest bit of malcontent (if I can even call it that, it was a simple comment via phone and could have a variety of interpretations), I felt this imperative need to water down my feelings because clearly Ilan was in some way threatened or uneasy. My goal is to be more mindful of these types of reactions. They are so deeply ingrained, and I have a habit of bottling up emotions or fearing to express what I decisively know, deep down, is RIGHT. Ilan tells me to voice my opinions, and recently I've been able to tell him when words or actions of his are hurtful, irritating, or just plain silly. It's cathartic. I am fortunate enough to also be in a profession where I think the playing field is fairly level for men and women. Also, the designer crowd is quite liberal, and ultimately, your sex doesn't matter as long as your artwork is solid. 

Anyhow, I think somewhere at my core, I do have this dark desire to control men, though not in an overt way. I prefer to slowly edge my way into their psyche with astute little comments and observations, humor, and general charm, until I somehow prove superiority. This all sounds awful, and I don't consider myself better than all men in ANY way, but I guess I like to break preconceived notions of what a women is and acts like in some subtle, invasive manner. It is a power play, and at the end of the day I don't like being told what to do, and I strive to be held in high regard. Now that I am serious with Ilan, I have to really think about the constructs of a male-female romantic relationship and how the communication, ego, and power play intertwine. Much left to learn and discover. I almost view it as an experiment, as grotesque as it may sound. The irony is that if I'm feeling censored or stifled, I withdraw immensely, but if I'm somehow doing the stifling myself, can I blame my significant other for my own ingrained habits? Surely not. It's true that the most significant relationship you will ever have is with yourself."

"event","i'm feeling a little better today, time to go to work, joy joy. last nite KP and i went to Cheesecake Factory. Everything there is like 2,330 calories, it's insane. They have this new ""skinnylicious"" menu, which, as Arwen told me, sounds ridiculous to order from. I'll have the skinnylicious chicken please. Durrrr. it was good food and good times. then we went to rite-aid and were a little overly excited to get earplugs. I got nyquil too! So last nite I had the trifecta of a good nite's sleep: Nyquil, ear plugs, and a sleeping eye mask. Ah, 9.5 hours of sleep does a body good. Sleeping A LOT is my new thing. 

Kristy departs today. I am sad but I know I'll see her in either 5 months, or 9 months. Hopefully 5, but we'll see how things go! It's been nice sleeping at my apartment these past two weeks. I didn't realize how little time I actually spend at the apartment since I'm always going to Ilan's. I think I want to change that. I pay rent here, and I have a great time just hanging out with Olga. It's going to be a little less cheerful once KP leaves but I think I can pick up the slack. After I get over this stupid cold, I can't wait to go to the gym. I did a few workouts while KP was here, but only Bodyrock interval ones, and I haven't actually laid my hands on the iron for a while. Rawr. Beasto need to benchpress! Barwen, I got my eyes set on you!

ok wellll time to get my shiz together and go to work. Annual Report covers are due today and I'm not exactly in a polished place for our internal meeting. It'll get done. IT SHALL GET DONE! There's an advertisement on the side right now for Tech Toasties, hehe. It's these fingerless mits so you can type, and they are literally fuzzy pieces of toast, so your hands look like they're in the middle of a sandwich. Cute...for some hipster shit. Portlandia!
Adios"

"event","i'm a sickly little shramp today. I stayed home and beasted all day. Well, actually I got a nice bit of errands done from home. I called up the apartment manager to request some forms and a repairman to come fix our kitchen counter. No one has come yet, and it's now 4:49 PM (I called around...10AM if not earlier). I may have to harass about that. Tee hee. 

I also called to figure out how to roll my Simple IRA into my 401K, and I'm awaiting Howard Pasternak, my 401K advisor, to send me a letter of acceptance. Yesh, precious. Then I fill out some paperwork and send it to Franklin Templeton so they can ROLLLL that shiz over. I don't truthfully know what any of this means, but I do know that my money did grow a bit over the past two years at Franklin Templeton so, maybe this stocks and bonds shit really works! Artists trying to figure out finances is a barrel of laughs. 

I also finally figured things out with my insurance for when I file my out of network claims. At the rate I'm going, I may not hit my deductible, but at least I know how it's slated to work, and that's quite glorious. 

Olga and I finished reupholstering the dining room chairs. It wasn't really a tedious task or physically demanding so even though I was sick I decided to give it a go. It's quite lovely. We decided we'd do more crafty DIY tasks. I'd like to make a little hanger for keys, umbrellas, and possibly our gym bags. Shouldn't be too difficult. The sandbag is always on my mind, although BArrelicious said that Dicks is having a sale on them. I have yet to shrimp over to Dicks to investigate said sale. Oh i still need to fix my break lights. Tee hee....damn cars. 

Kristy leaves tomorrow. NOOOO DON'T GOOOO. We are going to go out for dinner tonight. Perhapsy. Although I'm down to order in. I am tired and have a headache but maybe getting out of the apartment for a while will do me good. 

Kendra found a crockpot! We tested it and it appears to work. I'm thinking tomorrow at lunch I can pick up some ingredients, then Friday AM I can stew it up. Although Ilan and I are going to the Austrian Embassy to usher a concert Friday so maybe that's not a good idea. 

OH OH OH on other good news fronts, Arthur photo app was approved and he's figured out most of the coding so as of this Saturday I'll start making a logo, and some other graphics for the phone application. I also have to come up with a name and logo for his/our business. Since we're basically business partners from here on out, it needs to be a good name that has some personality but isn't something like ""pimpin shrimp"" (although that's the name we keep joking around about.

So that's the good news. Barbs got into this Air Force med program that will pay for her med school in exchange for a few years of medical service. She's very excited. I can't wait to visit her again. Richmond was a really cool town. I should probably wait until a warm weekend though. 

I'm basically set on visiting Kristy sometime in either June, or October. Either will be fun. I don't want to wait until October to take a vacation though, so maybe I can swing a small trip in the spring after my vacation days reset on March 16. I can't believe my one year anniv. at HZDG is only a few short months away! Crazy. 

I really miss my parents and I think they'll be coming to visit in two weekends. Great success.

Ilan is really busy with studying for his psych course, and he's also taking the GREs in two weeks. His plate is full. We may do work together on Saturday. I'm sure i'll be sad with Kristy being gone and whatnot, but I'm just going to try and stay positive and keep myself occupied. Shramp stamps all ova town. 

Ight nucka salad sandwiches, time to pluck my eyebrows while watching The Biggest Loser and patiently waiting for K. Pluchs to come home so we can get our GRUB on. Hoorah."

i woke up sick this morning. I hope the workday goes fast. There's a presentation due tomorrow but I think we have until 1 or 2pm to get the presentation boards ready so fingers crossed that we don't stay late tonight. I think my team is in OK shape but I'll know better after our internal meeting at 11. I just want to sleep all day. I kind of lost my voice. Mehhhh. 

last nite KP, Olga and I watched all these weirdo videos from a site called Vice.com. They have little documentaries. One was about bride kidnappings in Kyrgyzstan. Another one was about forced circumcision in Uganda when boys are between the ages of 16 and 20. Grosssss. And another one was called Asses of the Caribbean, so we thought it would be about like, booty poppin, but it turned out to be about people having sex with donkeys in the northern area of Colombia. Yeesh. There was also one called, ""The Biggest Ass in Brazil"" about this lady who calls herself the Watermelon Woman and basically like, performs and shakes her butt. It's big but...nothing to write home about. Hahaha. So it was a very informative evening of crap TV. 

KP leaves on Thursday. It's going to be sad. I've got the winter blues, big time. I want to come home today and reupholster another chair since i was too lazy/tired to do it last night. Gotta do SOMETHING productive. 

Friday i'm supposed to usher at the Austrian embassy for an Embassy Series concert with Ilan. I hope I feel better by then. Shrampies on a log."

Then KP and I ran errands. Just like old times! I got three new bras on sale at Soma. That place is fabulous.

this weekend KP and I had an epic party night at Midtown. And I definitely got sick in the metro! A first for me. I think I've had enough partying of that genre. Got it all out of my system for the time being. Hehe. 

Ilan and I went to the National Gallery and the Museum of Natural History. It was neato. The Nat'l Gallery East Bldg is always a bit of a letdown. It's the modern art gallery and there's so much space there but not that much content. I wrote down a few names in my little art book so it was still a worthy time. Mmmkay. 

Then we finally did COTR and ate at the apartment with KP, while Olga and Alex shrimped around. It was fun and I'm really glad that Olga and KP get along well, and Ilan absolutely loves Olga and Alex. Then we watched Dexter while Ilan did some psych. homework.  A relaxing evening by all means. 

I can't wait until the third Hunger Games is available from the library. I'm in withdrawal. Alright, thoughts of the day include not wanting to go to work, being tired of the lack of daylight, and being a little sad that KP will be once again leaving for Oxford on Thursday. :-( This visit was bittersweet."

"event","Gooood morning,
I read this little article about like, being happy in the new year or some bullshit, and the chick says she'd take a little time each day to write for the sake of writing. So since every morning I usually dick around online for at least 15 minutes, I shall try to write something. I'm all about being productive every moment of the day, even though I watched like 4 episodes of Dexter back to back yesterday, hyuck. 

Last night KP and I went to Jo Ann Fabrics and I got some material to reupholster the dining room chairs! I'm excited. Hopefully I'll be over at Ilan's tonight and can grab the staple gun. I got 3.5 yards of fabric, and as it was getting rung up at the cashier, she was like, do you need a bag? I said yes please, and she goes, ok it will be a nickel. I for some reason thought she was referring to the price of the fabric, so in a ""durrr"" moment I said, ""all that fabric is only a NICKEL?!?"" The cashier was like, ""you're special."" hahahaha. Fun times at Jo Ann Fabric on a Tuesday night. 

I hope to be productive at work today and let the ideas flow freely. And I skipped my workout last night because I wanted to hit the hay early, so today shall be a beast day! And then i can beast around at Ilan's house, he's starting a Psych class and I'm curious to poke around his textbook and ask him about the course. I miss school. Really, I miss college ruled notebooks and a nice, fresh pen to write with. hehe. Barbs is visiting Friday! While KP is still here visiting! Reunion of room 700.

"event","whoaa nelly, it's been forever. I need to start writing again, for REAL this time. It's quite fun to write. So work is goin, had a late night last night helping out another team do a pitch for Tim Gunn!! Pretty cool. Absurd amount of work, it's amazing that they got it all done. Although, I left at 10pm and I'm sure it was a 1am type of night for the rest of the team. 

So since my last post, Ilan moved into this new place in North Bethesda aka Rockville. It's so much nicer! He's still unemployed, studying for GREs to apply to Physician's Assistant school, and is a ball of stress at the moment. I've been going to therapy for anxiety and it's really helped. It's not easy going in there and talking about super personal things to basically a stranger, but overall it's helped me identify patterns in my behavior and cognitive patterns I've developed that I should probably investigate and re-learn or try to overcome. Makes me interested in psychology and BRAINS. 

This past weekend I went to Allentown for my mom's birthday. Twas fun, we beasted on Friday night, had tea and lounged around, as per usual on a Friday. Saturday I went to the gym with my dad, and then we went to the Antique toy fair at the Allentown Fairgrounds. Creep-tastic! Old, fat men collecting weird-ass old-ass dolls, and trains and shit. It was like a horror movie waiting to happen. Then we went to some lame-o Christmas crafts show, bahahaha, my dad and I were just like, befuddled at all the weird holiday items that were totally useless and folksy. It was a sociological experiment, (which is what I  like to call strange/uninteresting events with lots of unusual people in attendance, hahhaah, silver lining!)

After that we helped mom set the table for BIRFDAY DINNER, and picked up Euguene, met his dog Capone (crazy pitbull that's not neutered, so he's super hyper and jumping like ten feet high). We saw his new place, it's very nice, and hauled him to Lindermania for dinner. My aunt Anna told funny stories of Euguene as a child. Food was good. After taking Eugene home because he was having an allergic reaction to something or other, pops and I came home, then all three of us watched a new show I love on Netflix...Surviving the Cut. It's about insane military tests that soldiers have to go through for certain military jobs, like becoming a ranger or a paratrooper rescue squad member. It's awesome to watch. Very inspiring. Makes me want to be less of a little bitch at the gym. Yee-haw. 

Speaking of gyms, I've been working out consistently, not really pushing super hard, but keeping the momentum going. I still maintain that I need a training partner but it's difficult when everyone is so busy. Barwen comes over to workout sometimes, which is awesome, and Olga joins now and again, but I have to be the one pushing her. Still, it's good to go with someone and bang out that extra set. 

Since I'm not particularly LOVING my job, but I do see that there's oh so much to learn there, (seriously, I learn things on a daily basis, it's pretty impressive), I want to stick it out there. It's so hard because for some reason I don't seem to fit in super well with the people there. I know it's because I'm battling this anxiety ""thing"" and it eats up so much of my energy that I simply don't have the will to be super fun and social and I tend to retreat a bit. Also, when I first started there, I was still unsure about my relationship with Ilan, and having never been in a serious relationship before, every little tiny bump in the road was heart-attack armageddon worthy, in my eyes. That takes a lot out of you, to worry about every little gchat and text message. I have learned to chill out a bit more, but I do get swept up in anxiousness more often that is probably healthy. It's a learning experience I guess. I've been doing yoga consistently, and it feels GREAT. My body really responds to the breathing and stretching. I've also tried meditation a few times, me likey. I am trying to do some figure drawing classes on Sunday, hopefully. There's an open studio at Montgomery college in Rockville, for like, $9 I believe. I'll look into it more.

Tonight I want to work out and cook. I decided to do ""Meals on GRE Wheels"" for Ilan. He enjoys my cooking and is spending almost all of his time studying/job searching these days, so the plan is to give him a choice of three dinner options, he picks one and I cook it, then either deliver it to his house for a nice dinner, or he can come over to eat if he needs a change of scenery. We can eat together, or if he's super duper busy, he can eat on his own, and that's totally fine with me. It's nice that I work so close to his place, so I can easily bring food with me to work, then drop it off on the ride home. It's sort of a win-win, because I LOVE LOVE LOVE to cook and to try new recipes, and I really enjoy when others eat my cooking. Ilan likes to be cooked for and needs all of his free time for job stuff, GRE stuff, PA school stuff, blah blah blah. 

Arthur and I are working on an iPhone app. He's still working out the code for it, then I'll start on more detailed graphics. So that's pretty exciting, but still the ball is in his court for the development end. 

I need to figure out a new art project for myself. I drew something for my mom for her birthday, it was OK but not as fulfilling as I hoped. Maybe I'll make some special holiday cards or something. I need a little ""passion project"" as Olga calls it. 

Alright, time to get ready for work. MmmmHMMMM. If you're reading this, post a comment so I know some friends are alive out there!"

Soooo last weekend on Friday I got out of work at 1PM for Summer Fridays. I was super stressed because of this last minute CRAAZZYY project that was dumped on my lap, along with a few other members. I basically decided that for the sake of sanity, I'd take advantage of my turn for Summer Fridays 1pm departure, and I'd put in a few hours of work on Saturday and Sunday to get a few things done. 

Anyway, i went to ilan's house, he was a living fart machine because of something he ate, which was actually quite hilarious. We watched a boxing documentary about Luis Resto, it was really interesting. Apparently his coach took padding out of his boxing gloves and put plaster on his knuckles, giving him an unfair advantage. There were serious injuries to his opponent, who eventually killed himself, and Resto and his coach did jail time, yadda yadda. Sad story. 

We beasted around with his brother, i think we played outside at some point with the dogs, and then went out for some Vietnamese, beasted at TJ Maxx, and went to see Super 8, then did a lil smokey smokes and went to bed. Glorious. On Saturday I had the DC Metro Dash!!! Wooo. Ilan drove me out there and helped me warm up, and then filmed me doing it! My time was dead average. It was like, 15min 20secs, and average completion time is 15 mins. It was rough though. I feel pumped about it, makes me want to try and up my workouts ,though i have been slacking lately. 

Saturday evening I met up with Arwen at Asylum in Adams Morgan, met her bartender boy toy, had free draaanks, then met up with ilan and we were both hammered and went to bed. Sunday we got up early and i went to watch him play an AM soccer match. Then we watched the USA vs Brazil Women's soccer semi-final game, go USA. Good game. Really good game. His parents and bro watched as well, it was fun. Thennnn we pumped up my volleyball, and me, ilan and his bro eyal played volleyball in the backyard, then went to the pool and played some catch in the pool and horsed around, and then we went back and set up a soccer net in the field and kicked some soccer balls around. His dad played competitively up until a few years ago, so he was showing me how to kick properly. And after that we napped and set up a hookah, ilan made turkish coffee wiht a little chocolate liquer candy that he melts into it cuz it's soooo goooood, and i went home eventually to do some work. 

yesterday I finally got to the point where iw as like, OK< i'm officially going to try and seek out a therapist for my anxiety.  I was all panicked about the monday deadline for work, thinking that i'd have to stay until 10 pm or later...and we finished our work at 6:45! So i freaked out all fucking weekend for NO REASON. And sunday i did work that i probably didnt need to do cuz the direction changed a bit on Monday. I really need to chill out. 

i also let the anxiety negatively affect my relationship. I just freak out about stupid shit all the time in my head, and always get anxious about the possibility of breaking up, or of like, some impending doomsday thing that will end the relationship that i think i secretly know about but am avoiding. it's just crazy, and i'm sick of it. Kendra, the new roomie, has dealt with serious depression and anxiety and she's a psych major and goes to a therapist, so i'm going to talk to her about it, and she knows people in the industry so maybe i can find someone good. I just need to learn how to better deal with my anxiety. 

I told ilan about it. He was forced to go to therapy as a child for many years and hated it, but he said i should do it if i think it will help me. He also asked if my anxiety had to do with him, i said maybe sometimes, but it's more about ME not being able to address things properly, and the stress I have about our relationship is just normal couple things, and normal bumps in the road. He said to let him know if i'm stressed about something he is doing. And today he forwarded me some CNN article on women and stress. 
Anyhoozle,
time to get my crazy ass to work! bagaikers.

Work has been getting better, I went out to eat Cuban food with a bunch of folks on Thursday night, that was quite fun. I feel rather sheepish because the first brochure that I designed and printed ended up printing wrong, which was the faults of five different people including myself because we didn't review the mock-up from the printer. It's going to cost like, $3200 to reprint. Oooops. Hopefully it will all be OK. As far as my other projects, the clients seem happy and my creative director seems happy, but I'm not quite fulfilled with any of my design projects yet. I am hoping I'll get a little something portfolio worthy out of this one Monroe Street Market project, but that's yet to be determined. 

Friday night Ilan and his roomies threw a kick-ass party. It was Halfway to Xmas themed. It was so awesome, there was beer pong, an ice luge, a ridiculous amount of liquor, a keg (ofcourse), and even a bag of liquor soaked gummy worms. Holler! I played some pong and finally got to chat with Katie and Yo, the couple that Ilan knows well who I ran into in ISTANBUL randomly, and neither of us had any idea that we'd all be there simultaneously. Ofcourse, Ilan had no clue that Katie and Yo were going to Turkey, period, so it was all a big crazy weird coincidence of awesomeness. I also met this other cool couple, Johnny and Kate, who are Ilan's college friends I believe, and they invited us to this happy hour outdoor Bethesda festival on Wednesday. Hopefully I don't have any weirdo deadlines and can make it! So the best part of Friday, aside from the crazy landlady calling the cops, who ended up knowing ilan and his best friend so they were just like, eh, keep it down...ish? Anywayyyy, at around midnite the keg was kicked so we went to BlackFinn down the road to drink and dance. Jolly good. On the walk home, we got a pizza box from CVS. We were a few blocks from ilan's house, and he says he has to pee. ""Take this"" he says, referring to the pizza box, then promptly throws it on the grass instead of handing it to me. (wastey FACE). So he goes around the side of this person's house to pee, and i'm waiting on the sidewalk. 15 mins passes and I think, this drunky passed out! I walk around the side of the house and he's gone! I get a phonecall from him saying he's back at the house already. Apparently, as he tells the story, he was peeing, farted, thought he was going to shit his pants, then felt queasy, thought he was going to BARF, so he SPRINTED home for like 6 blocks barely holding his pants up, ran into the bathroom at his place and had a butt explosion, (and I believe he puked as well.) I have never met someone with such violent and spontaneous bodily functions. Anyway, i was FURIOUS because he left me in the street, so i was getting ready to yell my head off, but when i got back to his place there were people still there so i decided not to make a scene. We argued about it before bed, until it just became hilarious. Ilan was like, I am SO sorry, i was so hammered, i basically SHARTED, and my gut instinct was to sprint home to the bathroom! I didn't want my girlfriend seeing my shitting myself and puking in a random person's backyard! hahahahaha. I was like, honestly, I do not know what I would have done in that situation...but i told him that he's 28 years old and should probably stop drinking to the point of nearly crapping his pants and simultaneously vomiting. The funny part is he never SEEMS that drunk and then suddenly...it's a big UH OH moment. I should invest in a portable toilet for him. Or maybe just carry around a little pot, you never know when he's gonna blowwww.

The next day we had brunch with josh and then picked up his high-as-balls younger brother and got a RedBox movie. His bro was hungover and stoned and in the backseat and ilan is like, hey you can chill in the car while we get a movie, and his 20yr old brother goes, ""no i'll come, you should never leave a hungover baby in the back seat."" I found this to be hilarious. So anyhoo, we finally made the pizza from CVS the previous night, pre-ass explosion, and watched this creepish movie about the plague, and then decided to make some BBQ so I contributed by getting London Broil, some veggies, and i got some butterscotch pudding (cuz apparently that's ilan's favorite) and some strawberries and blueberries and made little parfaits! awwwww. we grilled out front and set up a table with some tikki torches leftover from the party, and played music from ilan's ipod. It was a nice little ghetto-ishly romantic dinner, hehe.

one day when we were bored we looked up little video games you can play online and found this awesome one of a whale that eats people and they scream when they die. (wow, HILARIOUS!) it's a funny game. So we had this really funny scene last nite where i was in a onesie after dinner and ilan was in pj's and we smoked on the floor of his room and then laid around on the ground and played the whale game from his computer. then we watched a kung fu movie. Best saturday ever. 

today i'm meeting up with max in teh city!! yay. we are going to go to the hirshorn i think. molest fest. do some artsy shit. get some lunchies. should be swell. KP is in oxford for orientation. holler at ur mother! 

in two weekends me KP and ilanovich are going to see Wicked, and the following day is the DC Metro Dash. Barbs moves out this thursday and Kendra moves in. I'm excited! bagaikersssssssss. 
i have not been training for the dash as much as i should, but ilan was like, dude stop stressing out about this, most people are probably doing it just for fun, and who cares if you're not in ULTIMATE shape for it. And...he's totally right. I just want to do it, have fun, i'm not trying to win anything, I just want to climb some ropes and jump through tires and push the prowler. fARTS."

"event","alrighty,
well life has been nutso. i started the new job and it's intense. My fourth day there I had to stay until 12:30 AM to work on this presentation with my team. The creative director had been out all week on jury duty, and the presentation was due Monday night. I was added to the team on Friday at about...1PM. So basically from that point on Friday, I had a crash course in this image development project for an apartment and retail center, and then I did some weekend work from home. Monday was a frenzy, the creative director returned, we had a billion pieces of collateral to create, and then print and mount stuff to boards, make PDFs, print this booklet...etc. OMG it was like, ridiculous. It was particularly traumatic for me, being only my fourth day there, not expecting to be so late, and not know what all we needed to present in the end. 

Anyway, let me back track to last weekend! Friday after work I went to Ilan's parents' house for this big family reunion. I met his grandma and her sisters from Switzerland, Tel Aviv, and LA. I met a buttload of uncles, aunts, cousins, and significant others. We played with the kids and the dogs and ate shwarma and it was fucking delicious. On Saturday I did a few hours of work and then got all dressed up, met up at ilan's, and we went to the Hyatt where his grandma's 80th birthday party was at! It was really nice. I helped his mom set up these specially ordered mugs, a random little take-away gift. There was a cocktail hour, and ilan showed the video he's been slaving over, and we all danced and beasted around. It was really really fun and I kinda miss those family oriented events. He said I made a really good impression on all of his family, and they had really great things to say about me, so that's good. I actually in a weird way miss his family, lol. They were very welcoming and fun to be around. I'm excited for Passover seder at his parents house. 

So after all that we decided to remove ""single"" from facebook, ya know, get those bases covered. I'm still not 100% sold on us being OFFICIAL, mainly because he has yet to meet all of my friends this weekend for my bday, and then he is yet to meet my parents. I think my mom will really like him, but my dad is kind of a weird bird and a ball of awkward. I mean, everyone loves papa linderman, but...he's a bit eccentric, ay?

I finally got to the gym on Wednesday night. I had been so fucking busy with work and adjusting to the new job that I totally lost track of LIFE. I need to get back into the groove so that I'm not a weak little pansy for the DC Metro dash. Shrampies. 

Tonight Hools gets in at 9:40, booya! After work I'm going to ilan's for a BBQ and then  picking up hools. Saturday Jackie gets in and we shall beast. Saturday  night is party time. Sunday daytime I'm not sure what I'm doing, probably taking a big NAP, and Sunday night ilan got tickets to see The Chosen. Shramps galore!! 

Alright, time to do my hair and ROLL OUT SON."

"event","hola,
sooo i got the job at HZDG and negotiated a slightly higher salary than their initial offer!!! I am SO EXCITED!!! Oh man oh man oh man!!! I start March 16. My last day at Bates will be March 8. I have a little week to beast around, I think i'll probably go to museums and do DC things that I usually don't get to do. Maybe even see the National Cathedral. I am stoked! I'll have to take my car into the shop as well, damn check engine light is on.  bastards. 

This past weekend was fabulous. On Friday I took off, had a baller workout, and then it was NIGHT OF LIBERATION for me and Kristy because....KRISTY GOT INTO FUCKING OXFORD FOR A PHD PROGRAM!!!! We are shitting ourselves. I'm so proud! So now we can sit down and get our Turkey tickets and everything because we know KP will be staying all summer long. I AM SO EXCITED!! AHHHH. We have to mainly decide if we want to do a package tour or just wing it. I'm starting to worry about the political climate there. Actually, I don't know SHIT about it...but other people who are more informed have raised eyebrows. However, one is my mother, who obviously is a worrisome creature, being jewish and female. 

Anyway, night of liberation was awesome. Kristy's old friend Valentin was in from NC. Jeans came over to pregame as well. Valentin invited three of his Peace Corps friends that live in the area. We pregamed like ballers, had the hookah lit, i wore my freak'um dress, and even managed to bust out THREE chin-ups before heading out to Adams Morgan. (that's a new record! I was previously stuck on two!!! progresssss). 

We shramped it up at Grand Central. At one point, me Valentin and Paul wrastled through the sardine-can crowd to the bar, and got a round of beers, but the bartender dicked around and didn't take our cards and then was nowhere to be found, so we just peaced. Haha. ran away on the check! oh man. i think i spearheaded that decision. But seriously, the bartender seemed to have forgotten about us so, we didn't want to stand there all night in the sweaty, packed corner. naist!  OH DUH Maria was in town from Maine!! So her and Laddy and someone else came along as well. It was glorious. 

AT the end the night, I think I turned into ""mean drunk Marina."" Mainly, my aggression was directed toward Jeans, he was being annoying and everyone was getting irritated. I have no clue what I said, but I did crawl on all fours around my living room and now i have rug burn on my knees. Classy lady, Linderpants. No doubt.

Soo Saturday I cooked and brought some veggies over to Ilan's. Me, him and his roomie Josh had a little BBQ. Josh made some off-color comments about whether or not i had fucked a black guy, so I said, ""yes, my ex was black."" This wasn't a big secret, I just hadn't told ilan since it never came up, but I feel like all white guys are intimidated by black penis. Just sayin! Anyway, Josh proceeded to say, ""oh you did fuck a black guy! I hope you got an AIDS test!"" and I was like, actually I did i get tested every 6 months, and he goes, ""why, cuz you fuck a lot of dudes?"" And i reply with, ""no, because i'm a hypochondriac."" And awkward laughter. Oh he also said, ""is it true what they say about black guys...."" and I laughed, and he goes, ""that they're POOR?"" 

It was all horribly wrong and ilan was like DUDE, wtf is your problem? Apparently Josh apologized a few times later. I basically didn't really care, the only thing that bothered me was that I hadn't actually told ilan much about Victor and would have preferred to do it not in front of Josh under those circumstances. Whatevs! Such is life.

BBQ was delicious, that boy can GRILL! And then I went to watch him play hockey, subbing for a club team. And then we watched TV and relaxed. MMhmmmmm. Good times. I stayed over and the next afternoon my mom called and kind of guilt-tripped me about how I should come down for the whole week I have between jobs. I don't really want to because there's not much for me to do in Allentown, and I'm coming down there Thursday - Saturday of this week. I got kinda upset because I do feel bad that I don't see my parents too often, BUT, they never want to come to DC! There's so much more to do in DC than in Allentown!! Plus, if they're in DC, I don't have to make time to visit A-town folks and can spend a weekend of pure parental bonding. Not that I don't like visiting a-town peeps, but then i feel BAD when i do it cuz i'm splitting attention between my parents and my friends. Whatever, i got all stressed, and briefly explained the situation to ilan who knows a thing or two about overbearing parents cuz his are Jewish and Israeli, which is a whole other ballpark. I couldn't really snap out of my funk, and I wasn't ready to talk to him about my dad having Parkinson's, so I went home. But I think I'm just going to tell him about that next time I see him. It's stupid to make it a secret, and if it affects my mood I'd rather have it out in the open than him thinking I'm getting upset over other reasons. I hate the Russian custom of keeping everything a big, goddam secret, so why should I perpetuate something I don't really understand or support. Shramps. 

I started designing a cover for ilan's grandma's  guest book, it looks pretty good! We are going to a Caps game tomorrow, hellz yeah!! I was thinking about going ice skating at the Silver Spring skating rink during lunch either today or wednesday, might be fun, if other people want to go with me. Bagaikers.

March 12 I have that letterpress class at the Pyramid Atlantic Art Center. Can't wait!!! Awesome. 
I also signed up for the DC Metro Dash. I'm about to kick my training into high gear. The event is July 2. Booya. I know I can't win the whole thing, but I want to do my damn best. I'm excited that I finally can do 3 chin-ups, it's a big deal for me. I also realize I should probably lose a few lbs of fat so that I can do the wall climbs with ease. Less fat = less weight to hoist up. I have four months to bust my ass, which is plenty of time for huge strength gains. I should devise a plan. I want to definitely incorporate sprints into my workouts, and now that the weather is nice, I should be able to do so. I'd also like to consistently do assisted pull-ups and negatives, and up my #s for the lat pull downs, because I have seriously been plateauing. Also, the jump rope intervals are great for extra cardio, just sheer endurance with the jumping for long periods of time. Yezzir. If i can shake off 5-10lbs, that would be great for my speed, but it's probably going to be EXTREMELY hard to stay in a consistent caloric defecit for that long, and i don't think I can do it without a training partner that's also trying to lean out. Whatevs, we'll see. Either way, I'm excited to take shit to the next level!!!"

"event","it's been a while! i don't remember when I last wrote. oh wait i just checked. bagaiks. soooo in a nutshell i got a job offer from a design studio in Rockville, MD. I am negotiating salary and waiting to hear a reply. I'm scared!! I HOPE that since I asked for a higher starting salary, they won't get all pissy and withdraw the offer. I can't standdd it here at Bates for another day. Kill kill kill. 

things have been going really great with ilan. I guess the last time I wrote, I went to his birthday, met all his friends, talked to his dad, had delicious food, and pimped around at the bars. It was fabulous. This past weekend Laura Goodell flew in from Chicago. We had a relatively low key weekend. Ilan came out to Rock Bottom on Sunday night to have dinner with us, I was nervous about just the three of us hanging out, but it was really fun and laid back. I'm going to be designing the guest book cover for his grandma's 80th birthday party. Jolly good!

Yesterday after I dropped Laura off and had my phone salary negotiations, I was a bundle of nerves. Ilan invited me over to go to Mongolian BBQ place. It's funny because whenever we hang out as one on one in a restaurant setting, it takes a bit of time to like, get into the conversational flow. I was totally out of it because I was mentally occupied with thoughts of jobs and salaries. He was still beat from a weekend in AC. We got back to his place and I changed into the onesie and then it was hilarious because his roommate Josh brought a girl home and out come Ilan and I, meeting her for the first time, and I'm in a onesie. Fuck yeah! So we watched some Hockey and some HIMYM and then Ilan and I played Bananagrams, which is like a tardball version of scrabble. We decided to have the theme be ""dirty words"" so everything was like, BUTTS, Cunty, dominate, labia, and things like that. Harder than I thought, surprisingly. (That's what she said.)

OhHHHhhh LOLA spilled water on my computer and it's basically dead. I await to hear what the Apple store says. Barbara is willing to pay for some of it. I am fucking PISSED. Stupid cat. My computer was in my room on my desk, and I had my valentine's day flowers in a pitcher on top of the desk as well. I forgot to shut my door for like ten mins and the cat snuck in and tipped over the pitcher. Fuckkkkk. 

Hopefully, I get this new job, get a raise, and it won't be so bad. It's just a computer, files were backed up, and Barbara can pay for half. Ideally. Shrampies!

So last night after bananagrams and wrestling and beasting and bucketing, and gettin NEKKID, I asked Ilan if he was still on OkCupid. He said that technically he still was on it, he still keeps in touch with two girls he had started talking to before me. At first I wanted to just get up and leave. But we talked about it and he asked if I'd like for him to remove his profile, whether it upsets me, etc. He said that we had never discussed our official title, or what we are looking for long term, etc, so he wasn't prepared to burn bridges with other girls he had started establishing contact with. I'm glad that he wasn't trying to conceal anything from me, because it could have been quite easy for him to say he was no longer on OkCupid, or not speaking with anyone at all. I explained that I am not one to demand that he remove the profile. That being said, I can't truly progress emotionally to the level I'd like to in our friendship knowing that he has this profile out there in cyberspace. I said that I understand the rationale, things may not work and he doesn't want to be back at square one. He said he's just about ready to remove the profile, he's just not 100% there yet. Then we kinda talked about what we were looking for long term, marriage, etc. Even talking about stuff I was really not anticipating, like raising kids Jewish, and all that gross adult shit. I guess he was worried that we didn't have enough small stuff in common, with him being so passionate about hockey, our differences in musical preferences, and even down to the fact that he loves guitar and piano and I don't play an instrument. It was interesting to hear his concerns. He asked me if the fact that those small hobbies of ours don't align was troublesome for me. Honestly, it's never been an issue. I enjoy watching hockey and although I'm nuts about dancehall reggae, I would totally see a Billy Joel concert. And I don't think two people need to have ALL the same interests to make things work. We have enough common ground, and a shared sense of humor is in many ways enough of a bridge in my book. Apparently, in regards to the music, he was like, ""well, what if i want to have a band, and you don't play anything so you couldn't be part of it."" (which was hilarious to me actually. Go form a band! I'll go to your shows. I'll just be a groupie!) And then he's like, these are things people argue about when they're married. ""You were late for dinner because you were practicing with that stupid band again!"" (literally, this is what he said.) So I'm kind of trying not to laugh because it's hilarious and adorable at the same time that this desire to form a band, and a fear that he'd get in trouble for missing dinner due to band practice, it's really cute. 

So anyway, I said I wasn't prepared to discuss official titles and boyfriend/girlfriend status, and that I am more concerned with building a solid friendship and understanding between the two of us. I told him that we can place a billion titles on our situation, but until we can both be certain that there's a strong emotional bond and a serious friendship and understanding, the titles don't mean dick. We both agreed that things were going well and we were on the right path. So as much as it deeply bothers me that he is on OkCupid maintaining these rainy day contacts, I know the reasoning behind it, and I know it will only continue until Ilan feels more certain that things between us can work out in the long run. It makes me feel better that he wasn't defensive or mad, and wanted to talk things about and get stuff out into the open. I'm not sure what timeline he had in mind when he said that he suspects he'll be ready to delete his OkCupid profile ""soon,"" but my intuition isn't picking up on any red flags, and I don't view him as a deceptive or conniving person. He's always upfront when I ask him about intentions. He's not really one to sugarcoat. But anyway, he also mentioned wanting to figure out a way that I can attend his grandma's 80th birthday, which is basically a massive family reunion with relatives flying in from all over the country AND Israel. I told him that would be extremely intimidating, but it would be fun. So here is where the paradox of Ilan comes into play. He is ok with me meeting his entire, extended family, but he isn't yet comfortable deleting a dating profile. It's something that I am in the process of understanding. He likes to be able to communicate openly and talk about feelings, but he finds it hard to get the ball rolling. We actually talked about these things last night. It was probably the first time in my life that I could speak frankly with a guy I was romantically involved with, voice my mind, and not worry that things would be awkward afterward. Alrighty, time to get some shizzz doneeeeee. Holler!"

sooo last monday i went to ethiopian food with neil, and he's kind of weird so i won't be seeing him again, le bye. there was some snow, blah blah, i hit a 155lb PR with my deadlift, woo hoo. other than that it was basically a deload week. Thursday night I went to ilan's and we watched a random movie, made smores with his roommates, then his best friend's sister came with a bunch of drunk chicks and we all played Apples to Apples (HATE THAT STUPID GAME), it was fun though, and then i slept ova cuz it was getting late. It was a jolly good time and I really enjoy hanging out with him and his roomies, it's like the frat house i always wanted to live in! hahaha. 

friday ilan and i went to lebanese taverna, cuz he had a groupon, ohhh yeah cheap jews!! and it was fucking delicious and really nice in there! and then we played some games at Dave and Busters, his roommate Josh and his g/f Kristy joined for a while. The only thing we could get with the tickets was a crappy bracelet that said Princess on it, so we gave it to Steve, the third roommate. hahahhahahaha. And i stayed over and in the AM we had some bangin omelettes and smoothies (gawd i love a man that can cook), and watched Kung Fu Panda, and ilan showed me how his video editing for his grandma was going. Looks good to me, I think video editing is hard as balls and you really have to have an intuitive sense for the pacing and the flow in order for it to not get boring. bagaikers.

so saturday, what did i do...ummmm i read, and i sketched a Blue Crabs logo for the hockey team, and in the evening kristy and i pregamed like ANIMALS, alyssa and Jeans joined up, and we went to Front Page. I peed outside of the metro, almost fell asleep on the metro, honestly i almost puked on the metro but used all my mental powers to get mah shit together (apparently i demolished probably about...2/3 of a bottle of vodka on my own, if not more, the details are hazy, Three Olives cherry vodka is a dangerous thing. Alcoholism comes in a close second. Being Russian, a third.) ANYWAY, we got to Front Page, didn't drink ne thing the rest of the night and danced like maniacs and i really hope others were dancing too cuz it was one of those nights where you're in a bubble and for all i know, it coulda been a Buddhist convention from a silent monastery up in there and im like WOOO KESHA!!! WAKE UP IN THE MORNIN FEELIN LIKE P.DIDDY!!! 

i wanted to go to hot jew's but jeans would then have driven home since KP went to Robby's and I didn't want his drinking and driving so he crashed on our futon and i stayed home. worst hangover EVER on sunday. I went to Sidamo, the ethiopian coffee shop, with Zoogs. The ceremony there was less than thrilling but the overall atmosphere is nice, not to mention delicious coffee and amaaaazing breakfast sandwiches (tho a breakfast sandwich to a hungover person is like fucking solid gold covered in diamonds with 100 dollar bills nestled on a all sides). Then we went grocery shopping cuz Zoogs' car is in the shop and he needed food. hyuck! men grocery shopping is either a shitload of JUNK food, or complete and utter basics. Bread, eggs, milk, OJ, bananas. It's kinda funny. They're not so much  impulse buyers, i feel. 

So after that I went home, beasted, then rolled over to ilan's, watched some comedy stand-up shiz with him and steve, his friend michele came over with her PUPPY to do video editing, so i played with the pup and chatted with steve while they did their thaaang, then we all hung out and they had some wine but my hangover headache somehow reactivated itself and i wanted to DIE. Michele is cool tho, she works for this video editing place and she's doing a sex-themed show. One of the topics was men with ""micro penis syndrome"" and she said she had men send her pictures of their dicks to her work email, ahhahaah. So her inbox was full of random men's penis photos! ah, the working world. She also did a story on people who mentally achieve orgasm, and went to some seminar to learn how to do it, and successfully did it. For the love of GOD teach me everything you learned!! k thanks. She friended me on facebook, high five. 

So friday is ilan's bday and he's doing a group dinner at a Moroccan place in DC. I was invited. Now I'm nervous because....yesterday he told me his DAD may be going, as well as his grandma. I said, hokay, and as long as his roomies are going I'll have someone to chat with, i'll be fine. I'm having a great time getting to know him and we're always doing cool stuff together, but it's not at the ""relationship"" level yet and i strongly feel like rushing into it would be detrimental to what we have going on here. It doesn't even really bother me that he may or may not still be OkCupid, because IF this becomes something legit, I would rather him feel that he's kinda ""been there, done that"" and explored other options, and is comfortable with the decision to be exclusive. I kinda had my little weird random thing with neil, and that's out of my system, and i'm not saying i'm completely on board with exclusivity YET, but yeah i dunno i can ramble on and on about shit. Let's just say, I am learning a lot about myself, and realizing that being patient is half the battle, especially for an impatient, demanding motherfucker like myself. BAM

i am still at home taking an epic crap, my AM coffee typhooned through my colon. 

mmmm delicious!

ok last comment about ilan, seriously, this is ridiculous. i made him a little coupon for a 30 minute massage from me. but it printed twice, so i guess that's two 30 minute massages. I also got him Schindler's list cuz he never saw it (bad jew), and i'm picking up a bottle of Patron tequila. Yes, that to me is a fabulous gift. Liquor, Holocaust, and muscle relaxation. i was going to get him a onesie but...they're not cheap honestly, i think i lucked out with my $5 purchase. Plus, the buttflap is really a necessity i have come to realize. 

my onesie is fabulous, thanks for asking."

so i finished the first Harry Potter book that Ilan let me borrow, good times. I'm starting the second one tonight. This week was pretty fun. On Tuesday I went to see Ilan play a full hockey game, the first one since his leg injury. I was the only spectator, aside from some random lady, and I was right up against the glass. even though it wasn't a pro game, it was still awesome to be so close up. I brought my book with me, as per ilan's instructions, but ended up reading maybeee 2 pages because I was kinda into the game! And he scored a goal and two assists, wooord. Too bad i'm kind of a terrible spectator because I honestly have a lot of trouble seeing when a goal is scored. Like, if it weren't for the scoreboard, I can't see the goddam puck, it's too small. Shramps. 

Thursday we had a client meeting in Chinatown and then had lunch at Potbelly's, ""we"" being me, Katie and Ernie and the Nat'l Parks mag people. Thursday night I went to the mall and to Target looking for a potential cute outfit to wear on Friday, couldnt' find anything, ended up buying an adult pajame onesie, or ""union suit"" as J.Crew calls it. This thing is banging, it was only $5, it's a one-piece pajama that covers your entire body, but doesn't have the footsies/booties things that a legit baby onesie has. It's got buttons from the collarbone down to your crotch, but no butt-flap (which actually SUCKS, and if i ever get another one of these, ima def spring for a butt-flap.)

Anyway, that was my shopping experience, and this is yet another reason why I can't be trusted to do clothes shopping on my own. 

Friday was Mimi's last day, I finally pranked everyone with the fart machine. Katie brought in her foster dog, Elsie. SO EFFIN CUTE AND WELL BEHAVED. Husky/German Shepherd mix. Adorbs!

Friday night after work I did a brutal interval workout, then went over to Ilan's, he invited me for dinner. He made this fucking amazing steak on the grill, some grilled portobello tops, grilled zucchini, homemade guacamole and cut up fresh veggies. FReakin good. His roommate josh and his g/f beasted with us for a while, then second roomie steve showed up with his friend Hal, and we all hung out and ate and eventually watched an episode of Spartacus Season II (god bless the creator of that show. it's basically like ""HEYY how can we get gratuitous amounts of sex, half naked HOT muscular men, violence, and ridiculous CGI blood splatters, disguised by a thin plotline??? ANCIENT ROME ofcourse!!"" 

Saturday morning after much debate ilan joined me at the Silver Spring farmer's market. He got some steaks and bison steak, i got some sage + apple sausages and one bison steak. Fuck yeah. Sooo i went home and finally went to Home Depot and had my log sawed into two smallish stumps, and two 1.5 inch slices (only one is really usable, the second is super lopsided, but we shall see). So right now I have the one log piece drying in my room, and I scraped off excess wood chips and little rocks ingrained in it from the rolling. Hooray. 

in the evening, me barbs and KP smoked hookah and watched SEven Years in Tibet. I also grilled my bison steak, it was good shiz, super lean cut! fuck yeah. I also wore my onesie all evening long. ALSO when i told ilan about my onesie, i thought he'd just give me that ""youuu crazy"" look, BUT he thought it was awesome and said he's always wanted one...with a butt-flap ofcourse, and he wants me to bring mine over. (marry me?) hahahaha. 

tomorrow i may hang out with neil, the rando i picked off the street. i don't really care if i see him or not to be honest, but he contacted me a few times, and he lives across the street so...whatevs. I don't have a ring on my finger. I really like hot jew but i have to not get all fucking carried away like i always do. you know the formula: omgomg this guy is awesome/perfect! 2 weeks later there's signs of bullshit. 1 month later i'm disgusted that i ever got involved in the first place! Rinse and repeat. hahahaha. umm apparently i have severe commitment phobias wayyy worse than i ever, everrr everrrrr imagined. Victor really did a fuckin number on me, and i had no clue until i recently started thinking things through in a rational manner, and read up on some psychotherapy. dizzayum! well, at least i'm movin forward.

so yeah tomorrow at 2pm there's a coffee ritual ceremony at Sidamo, this ethiopian coffee place on H Street. I want to go really badly and if neil doesn't want to...i may just say ok thanks buh bye now! or i'll go and then hang out with him in the evening for a light meal or something. whatevs. 

i'd also like to suggest hanging out with ilan for tuesday evening, though i think he may be playing hockey, but i feel kinda bad because i have only ever invited him over to my place once, and he has been kinda dropping hints about coming over and whatnot. Soo i'll just throw it out there, maybe some dinner + hookah + scrabble/trivial pursuit, although i want to go to his place cuz i need to borrow steve's drill and chisel for the stump, and i would like their help with his tools (that's what she said?) BUT BUT BUT the log is still wet from the snow, but i mean, you can drill wet wood, can't ya? (biggest that's what she said of all time). So yeah, i could suggest that, and if he's unavailable i'll work on my calendar tuesday evening. yessss indeed. i have a big list of the weekly themes, and i really want to start laying out the general layout of the calendar, also i need to figure out the dimensions.  beep bap. 

mimi send me a link to this job in silver spring, museum design, but i spoke with a Tyler alumni working museum design who said it wasn't creative and she's frustrated. gulp!

MY NEW PASSPORT CAME IN DA MAIL!! WOO. KP and i are gonna book tix probably in the next 2-3 weeks for TURKEY!!! high fivesssss.

lately, i have been feeling like i have a billion ideas swimming in my head at all times. I also keep hearing quotes i really enjoy. ""the mind fails long before the body"" is something i keep repeating in my head when im working out, and then today i heard ""the more difficult the journey, the greater the depth of purification."" (loves it!) And also, ""if a problem can be solved, do not worry about it. If it can't be solved, worrying will do no good."" (that should be my fucking mantra, given all the random anxiety i have for no particular reason). But my actual favorite is, ""if you do what you've always done, you'll get what you've always gotten."" shrimps on a stick!"

"event","friday night i went to Chi Cha Lounge with Miriam, smoked some great Peach hookah, had a few beers, and bopped around to fabulous music that made me want to booty pop all over the continental US. great times. Saturday I went to the Silver Spring farmer's market, got some locally pastured beef, got ingredients for my grilling feast from H-Mart, bucketed at home. Then laddy came over. We took a walk to the rock creek sports club so I could inquire about boxing lessons. They gave me the name, phone and email of the boxing trainer. score!! on the walk back, i spotted a pile of logs. For a while now i have been wanting to get a birch log, carve the center out, get a potted plant and stick it into the birch log so that the foliage spills over the top and gives the illusion that the log itself is sprouting greens. Anyway, teh logs were not birch, but beggars can't be choosers. Long story short...laddy and I rolled a log for about a mile to my apartment in the dark. It was a good workout. As a result, I want to develop the new ""it"" workout, LOG ROLLING! Hear me out: you get a log, set up an obstacle course, roll the log through things. Lift it, throw it, jump over it. It will be the new p90x!! And mandatory flannels involved. fuck yeah. and we can hire hot college guys to dress up as lumberjacks and look pretty on the sides. 

so anyways, log is now in my trunk, and the next part of the process will be to procure a saw. fuckyeah, new crafty shizzle project. booyakasha.

saturday night i went out with Liza and her husband. We drank at Front Page, danced on tables at Cafe Citron, I had a stage 5 clinger Bolivian guy, but he was cute and had a nice smile which made up for the lack of English. Then we beasted to Lucky Bar just to chillax. I took the metro home. Now, I think subconsciously i was pissy cuz i texted ilan with ""hi bucko"" at some booty call-ish time, but he didn't reply. Anyway, i'm buzzed, i get in my car to drive from the metro parking lot to the apartment. Then I see a dude walking down the road and for some reason i assumed he desperately needed a ride to the metro. He starts coming over to my car, but it was actually to tell me my headlights were off! I assumed he wanted to get into the car for the ride that i made up in my head, so im like, get in!! he says, oh, i live right across the street, i'm fine. I persuaded him apparently, so we chatted in my car and sat around the parking lot of my apt complex. He's an IP Lawyer from Ohio, ahahah. Then it was cold so i invited him up, we had beers, talked about all kinds of crap, did push-ups, and generally got along freakishly well. And he was cute. Really cute. and Tall. I know...i'm fucking crazy and that was very dangerous. He stayed over, we hung out Sunday, I made some breakfast, Kristy came home and we all chatted and she really likes him. He hung out until 3PM, then left. The dude lives across the street and is in his thirties. Anyway, he asked for my number. So that was my BIZARRO experience. I think he's cool and i'd like to see him again. 

so after that I made some amazing beef kabobs. ilan was supposed to have a football partayyyy but it never happened so i brought a few kabobs and we watched A-Team, ate food, and beasted with his roomie Steve, who is mad cool. He said i can borrow some of his tools for my log project. sweet! 

since things are moving very slowwwww with ilan and i am always mentally preparing myself for things to come to a sudden end, it's psychologically nice to have met another interesting, mature male. The IP Lawyer, Neil, is a nice distraction, not to mention the fact that ilan and i basically aren't really going to be doing much physical stuff since he voiced his concerns about rushing into that type of stuff. Anyway, the pimp cane done well, even though it was not the smartest thing i've ever done, but it all ended up for the best. shrimpies and pimpies.

tonite i had fun with ilan though, and i got a chance to talk one-on-one with both of his roommates, and i think we're finally entering the non-awkward phase. Wow, i just wrote ""faze"" instead of phase. Hi, i'm an 8th grade study hall note. hahahaha. i also think that now, it's pretty apparent that im not trying to trap ilan into any sort of commitment, (ESPECIALLY now that there's another man in the mix, gotta keep the options open ya heard?!) Anyway, i feel like our interactions are more relaxed. We may do lunch tomorrow since he's not working but i don't know if that will ultimately work out. Work may be busy tomorrow. fartstains!

ok
time
to go to bed

also barbara wrote me this email about how i was loud last nite apparently, and she's ""all for a healthy sex life but needs her sleep."" Ok, yes, i am sorry, i forget my bed is squeaky and our walls are thin! BUT, please stop sending me passive aggressive emails. The email started off with some compliment about how the apartment smells good thanks to my cooking, and then she laid in on me. I felt a little off about the whole random hook-up with Neil and then seeing ilan the same day...so when i got home and checked my email in front of barbara and read that shit, i basically just walked away. she knocked on my door to talk and i eventually came out and just said...ok...i was wrong and sorry i made noise, but i don't want to see emails like that, and i don't want to talk about this right now. Sorry, my bad for last night, we can talk about this later.

tomorrow i'm going to call doctors for a physical appointment, and call boxing guy and lowe's about borrowing a saw. Yayyyyy."

"event","I live in mortal fear of an Exorcist commercial or pop-up on a website. It is rather crippling. I remember when The Last Exorcism came out, and Perezhilton.com was showing movie stills and trailers all over its homepage. I wanted to beat myself with a stick. 

Tonight I am starting my memorization of the former US presidents! I'll do three at a time. The first three are easy. George Washington, John Adams, and Thomas Jefferson. Sadly, I didn't know that Jefferson was the third. I mean, I figured he was something between the third and maybe...the seventh? Yes, I am terrible with US History. I am terrible at many 5th grade level things. 

Word was rather silly today. First half was spent dicking around on Marines. Finally I finished that shiznit and then got slammed with four other assignments. I am gloriously happy to be busy for a change. Two Cisco projects, (vom...but it has to be done so...whatever), an Align illustration, two mini illustrations for Deb, and SMI content came in. Three features! Shrampies! 

Boss lady saw my Marines cover illustration and liked it. HOORAY! I am excited about it, i know i keep mentioning it but I haven't been this proud of something I've done at work in a while. 

I came up with a few more weekly themes for my calender. Everday I'll try to create 5 new themes. Ideally, I'd like to have 75, then whittle it down to 52 high quality  ones. It's not easy! Everything I think of revolves around crafting a project, or sampling a new food. A lot of the ideas seem to be geared toward other creatives, or females, and I need to make sure there's no shramp left behind. Also, I'm not sure if I'd to have an alcohol themed week here and there. It should be kid-friendly! Though, making one kid friendly inevitably leads me to very adult ideas just to spite myself, which then makes me think I should make a funny, adult calendar full of shrimp-a-licious Marina-isms, and give it to just my friends. But...that's a lot of work, and I'm exceedingly good at stressing myself out with unnecessary projects that I create...for myself. Lordy. 

I got a nice envelope for my passport, sealed it up today, so tomorrow i'm going to USPS, butttt i think i shouldn't have sealed it up cuz they may need to place some signature authorization form inside the envelope. D'oh! I'm a turd. We'll see. This seriously must get done tomorrow, I can't put this off any longer. I need to start planning Turkey and I can't do that until I renew this shiz, and it's already January and I also need to get my visa for Turkey. 

So the only contact i had with ilan today was a short but nice reply to the pic I emailed him, which included a little cleavage let's just say. I replied something funny back, and that was that. He didn't gchat me all day, didn't hear from him in the evening. There was a Caps home game, I'm sure he went. I went to trivia at Union Jack's with Barbs and her friend John that's visiting from London. He's very nice. 

Today at work I decided to reactivate my pimp cane. I just keep getting irrationally upset about this ilan situation, and...it's like... not a fucking big deal but i keep wanting something to happen that would either indicate that he really likes me, or that he's not interested. Being in limbo is really difficult for me. I guess it's been like...7 weeks? That's kind of a long time? No? Am I totally fucking CRAZY? I don't want commitment, just SOMETHING. This is the epitome of being a girl. I'm upset over something intangible and I can't communicate what it is that i desire, but i still manage on bitching and acting dissatisfied. Can somebody please hit me with a ""shut the fuck up"" stick? or LOG? or a freakin...wrecking ball? jeeeezus.

i also need to get a stupid physical and see a dermatologist. I have creepish white marks on my back. Hypochondria in overdrive! I also have dark circles under my eyes, and my skin gets dry and gross, but i still break out, and i'm kind of sick of it! 

I had a very awkward moment at work today. Deb, my boss, had recommended a hair stylist, this dude Ian. I have been going to him for haircuts. Last time I was there, he told me I look just like his wife, (even though I really don't except having dark hair and eyes, I saw pictures, she's all tall and willowy and graceful with loooong pretty hair). SOOO Deb comes in, and in front of all my coworkers says, ""I saw Ian today. He was like, that girl that works for you...what's her deal? Why is she so fucking hot?""

......
awkward x 1,000,000
not that i don't appreciate the very nice compliment. I just don't appreciate a compliment on my hotness from a married man, that cuts my hair, recited by my boss, in front of all my coworkers. Instances like these always kind of throw me off, because Ian is definitely not a man that I perceived any ounce of attraction from. Maybe my spidey senses aren't as accurate as I think. Shrampers.

"event","You know what quote i really like but sounds so fucking scary that I don't want to post it anywhere? ""Pain is weakness leaving the body."" Apparently it was Marine recruitment propaganda. Shit son, works for me! Semper Fi! If a dude has that shit tattoo'd in HUGE letters across his chest, best believe he's nuttier than a jar of Jiffy peanut butter! (choosy moms choose Jiff!) But he's probably redonkulous in bed, just sayin...though I don't think that ""pain is weakness leaving the body"" belongs in the bedroom, that's a bit intense. 

cat is sitting on the floor staring at me creepishly. I am staring back. literally, my head is turned and i am not looking at the screen. Stare-off motha fucka! you may have night vision and nine lives...but i just brewed a reallyyy strong cup of coffee. It's on! 

you may be asking, why am i at home on monday at noon. Well, first of all, LUNCH BREAK shrampies! But secondly, the past 12 hours were kinda strange. I went to bed, got up, had my usual midnight snack (I seriously need to cut that shit out, new years resolution!), went back to bed, then at 4am I get a text from Kristy that she's not feeling well. Apparently she'd been barfing and having all kinds of bodily nastiness for four hours. I called Dr. Linderman, she gave the green light to go to the hospital. Sooo at 4am one very sleepy shrampy, and one very sickly shrimpy went to the hospital in Bethesda. Checked into the ER, peeska got 3 fuckin Liters of IV fluids, got some bloodwork and stool samples done. Lots of meds and four hours later, we got released. I napped and then went to work. Apparently, Darryl is sick, Robby is sick, and Katie is sick too! I guess something is going around, though they don't seem to be nearly as bad as KP was. I'm a little nervous cuz my stomach is feeling gurgly, but I'll just attribute that to my rampant hypochondria and move on with life. Oddly enough, when there's a true threat of illness, I always convince myself that I'm immune, but when there's some bizarro affliction i read about on Web MD, i am 100% convinced I'm slowly dying of it. 

Anyway, I went to work, shramped around, at 11ish I left for CVS to drop off KP's FOUR effin prescriptions, even though my mom strongly disagreed with the need for Cipro. Docs are so goddam antibiotic-happy. Weirds me out. Whatev records. I got her some Pedialyte as per doctor's orders, (and i secretly want to try it, it's apple juice flavored! and there's popsicles!). I got home just in time for my 11:30 phone call with some biznatch from a staffing agency that came across my coroflot profile and wanted to chit chat. She's apparently in the philly office so she's going to transfer my info to the Bethesda office. Contract work!! AWwwww snap! I told her I want freelance illustration shizzles. Hopefully, something good with come out of it. I was emailed a PDF of how my work was shown in that random magazine called One, in Shanghai. They used this stationary I did for the front and back cover, but that shit should not be on covers...cuz....it's fucking STATIONARY. At least the rest of the project looks nice in the inside layouts. Those folks need some layout designers, that's for sure. Buttcakes all ova. My head hurts.

I messaged hot jew on gchat cuz I got tired of waiting for him to contact me. Whatevs, if he's not interested, i want to find out sooner than later because I have been obsessing over him for some reason and it's just not healthy. I realize that I'm impatient and I'm not exactly sure what I WANT at this point. No, that's a lie. What I want is attention from him, if that's what you really want to boil it down to. I don't want a relationship at this stage, or anything remotely addressing commitment or b/f g/f types of things. NO, do not talk to me about that. I just want to be physically in your presence and get to know you. Sigh. 

So tomorrow I will get an envelope from FedEx and send off the fucking passport. I wanted to do it today but all this sickness rerouted my plans. No biggie. I should start my new years resolution of memorizing all 50 presidents. Maybe i'll do like, 2-3 a day? Sounds reasonable. I can't wait to start for realsies planning Turkey. I'm so antsy for travel right now. I need something big and life changing. I think 2011 is going to be a year of big things. (that's what she said, BAM). But really, it's going to be a transition year for sure because KP and Barbs are leaving me, so i have to find new roomies, possibly a new job, possibly a new apartment, possibly fucking move to a different city if I find something good enough??? And maybe I'll actually meet someone NORMAL that can hold my attention for more than a month and isn't shady and distant. I'm also going to try and slowly transition closer to a Paleo type of diet. I'm sure it will take years before i can fully get rid of all the old, crap food habits I have, but the past two years were pretty important in improving my diet. My first step is to start ordering more grass-fed beef in bulk from local farms. I know it's the ""in"" thing to do, but I really do believe in supporting local economies, and I have a tremendous respect for farmers in general. I secretly want to live on a farm...that's 20 mins distance from the city. hahaha. 

Maybe this weekend I can finally go to an art museum. I am deprived of culture! the winter has turned me into a hermit. I also need to sit down and make a hilarious list of fake holiday themes for my calendar. I am now convinced that the weekly holiday themes (like high five your boss week), is better than the cute breakfast foods. This will allow me to show more of my sense of humor, and have a wider variety of illustrations. I think food illustrations would get boring. Plus, I'm really sick of googling breakfast foods. Sausages aren't that pretty to look at. (that'sssss what sheeee saiddddddd, thankyouverymuch).

i am sore today. i am also really excited about this simplyshredded.com site, even though most of the workouts have fuck-tarded names, such as, ""Boulders for Shoulders workout."" To be honest, I don't want my body parts to look like rocks. Rock hard abs, maybe, but i think men's bodies are more suited for the ""rock hard"" description. (INSERT PENIS JOKE HERE) (get it, double joke! think about it!)

i saw Black Swan and that lesbo scene was really fucking hot. Speaking of me being GAY, I was at arwen's, wearing my ""gay pride"" shirt (which shows a pride of Lions in pink), and then my PJ shirt was my t-shirt that formerly said FBI but the F fell off so now it just says ""BI"" in pink, glittery letters. Hellz yeah. 

ummmm what else. Eh, i should get to work. I keep meaning to do a reflection of the past year but it's just not happening."

It was a little awkward at first because it was like, we had to make this other girl feel welcome and had just turned 21 and was a little shy. We ended up having a good night, I crashed at ilan's and i guess i didn't sleep that well because in the morning, i was decided to call in sick and sleep till noonish. I did print out all my shit for my passport renewal, but the post office was confusing me so i may just FedEx. KP and i got some liquor for new years and ate a delicious meal from the Pho place. hooray. I took a few walks today cuz i'm all sunlight-starved and gollum-ish. about to hit the hay. tomorrow i want to try and get a few peoples to join up at Sapphire in bethesda for trivia.

I went to bed at 9 last night. HIGH FIVE!! I kept waking up throughout the night though. we hates it!

friday i called it an early night.
saturday arween came over and we went to auto zone and then did a sweet ass workout and i bench pressed 30lb dumbbells for a full set of 12! <-- most lesbian-ish sentence i have ever written, cool!

then i bucketed around, K.Peeska came home, and I we met up with Barbs and a slew of NIH shizzies at Mussel Bar in Bethesda. It's so cool in there! I was true to my liver's ""no molesto por favor"" door sign, and didn't touch a single drink. High fives all around. I was in bed by midnight and feeling glorious, except Lola woke me up meowing and immediately vomited on my rug. Oops. 

Sunday I got up and was having a little hissy fit cuz hot jew and I had plans sorta kinda to go skating and he wasn't messaging me and omgomgomgomgomgggggg TEARS and i am a fucking PSYCHO with this new birth control. Anyway, I took a walk to the local co-op store and got Vitamin D and some locally grown, organic apples! Then i smoked a giant bong and sang kumbaya around a campfire. JK, but that's what i FELT like i should have done, cuz i was a total hippie in the store. 

i came home and then got allll uppity cuz hot jew wasn't messaging me on gchat and finally messaged him, and things were still on and fine so i dunno why i'm a batshit crazy woman. I pretty much go it into my head that we'd hang out and not have fun for some reason??? cuz we never really spent one-on-one time since our very first date, and other times we were together was group dates, movie, or involving alcohol. 

Anyway, we actually a REALLY fucking awesomely fun and laid back time! I went to his place and then we bucketed to Chinatown and went to get delicious food, then to the ice skating rink at the sculpture garden. 

Now I will interject my description of our date that I wrote to Dan.

 
ME: then went ice skating at the rink at the sculpture gardencuz he plays ice hockey and is obsessed with skating, so it was like all  cute as fuck, and i felt like a pretty little princess

Dan:  yea are u telling me your life or Love Actually scenes
me:  HEY, this is hard enough for me to process, don't make it any harder!
My idea of romance is NOT making a fart noise. Abstaining from saying ""we wantsss it my precioussss"" during foreplay is my idea of romance. Anyway, you get the picture. so then we beasted back to his place and watched A Serious Man which is like such a fucking WEIRD movie, but super jewy, and he's jewish, so we laughed jew laughs, and it rained money
 
Dan:  drank manishevitz, the blood of the innocent gentile
 me:  excuse me, blood of innocent gentile INFANTS, i have standards ya know

Anywayyyy that was that, and it was fun, and he has off for like, ten days for the holidays cuz technically he's a university employee?? So he said he'd like to come down and meet me for lunch sometime. And I think we are going to hang out on Wednesday. The only thing that i'm...curious about...is that he's pretty sexually restrained, unless drunk, where he's more playful, but like tonight he was all tired so we weren't really having any sexayy times. Which is fine with me for a change, because it's forcing me to make an emotional connection before I just avalanche my ass into a whirlwind of physical stuff, which is my crutch because that part is easy for me and the emotional/mental stuff is where i'm all WAIT what what WHAAAAT, ohh hellzzzz NAW. So this is actually...really fucking good. Which makes it a billion times more scary. BAgaiks. He said that since I wanted to see Black Swan but we saw Unstoppable last time, we should go see Black Swan, so maybe Wednesday we can do that. There's a hot lesbo scene in it apparently, coolio. 

oh i have JURY DUTY tomorrow. If i paint on a Hitler moustache...would they dismiss me? 

Dan also said something about a full day of talking/acting like Gollum...which is effin AWESOME and i would really like to do that. So i think the only way to get away with that would be to dress up like gollum next year on halloween and just ""be in character"" all day, but i don't really want to wear a loin cloth at the office for 8 hours. I mean, it might be worth it...but...I might be a little cold. And i'd def have to do some serious low-carb, Paleo dieting to look all cave-dwellingly emaciated and shit, cuz no one wants a gollum with tig ole bitties and a big ole BUTT....or do they???"

pretty much at any given moment i have some kind of jingle stuck in my head, and usually a word is replaced with shrimp/shramp or some other used and abused Marina-ism. 

today i met up with an old Gdub pal, Liza. She was living in NYC for a while, moved here with her new husband a bit ago, hooray hooray. She's really cool and hopefully we can hang out again soon and partayyy. She's also working on networking for her own start-up event decor business. I would love to help her out with any printed material. 

tomorrow I'm getting a haircut, woooo. And then I'm meeting with K.Peeska and her NIH mofos for trivia at some place called RiRa...methinks. 

my sixth sense is tingling that hot jew is not really that into me. the past few days were kinda up and down and i know he's a self professed online dating addict, so i think he was actually out with someone last nite, which is fine, but i do for some reason feel like he's...not really looking to continue things with me. he didn't contact me today, and I accidentally left my necklace at his place, so maybe i'll just email or text him tomorrow to ask if i can swing by and pick it up...and i can invite him to trivia so it doesn't seem like such a finite gesture of ""peace out."" I really do like him and i think we have a lot in common and get along, but if he's not that into me, there's just nothing i can do about it. ofcourse, this could all be in my head, but i know enough to trust my sixth sense, and i also know that if a guy wants to get in touch with you and see you again, he will do it, so i refuse to make any moves. And that is that. It kinda sucks, but it's not the first time a guy seems super into me and then randomly peaces out. 

for a full minute i stared at what i thought was two homeless people having sex under a blanket outside of a Chinatown Starbucks...before realizing it was a tied down tarp billowing in the wind. 

i got home and damn near burned the apartment down trying to cook up some gyoza. Hot oil + water = big, fat flame??? Thanks for NOTHING 7th grade Home Ec class!!

tomorrow i will send a follow-up email to Post Typography. I am so lost right now about the job thing. I haven't been looking for jobs because honestly, things have been super fun at Bates lately, and I'm in the process of making a pimpin illustration for the next Marines cover...and probably a pimpin feature to go along with it. Ugh. Ofcourse, after spending all this time making a PDF portfolio and updating my portfolio site, I puss out. 

Tomorrow I need to get into work a little early. Wednesday I need to fix my headlight, either in the AM or on lunch break. Thursday I would really like to get my fucking emissions test done bright and early, and then it's the company party, where I really need to NOT get wasted for a change so that I can function on Friday. Friday Arthur should be coming down, so I'll ask him for help transferring all my files from my old computer to the new one via firewire, and maybe he can help me find a good external hard drive to purchase. 

The following week I'd really like to get my passport renewal going. For realsies.

Friday is also game night at our apartment, which initially I didn't want to go to, partly because I figured I may go out with hot jew, but since I have my whole theory of him losing interest, maybe i'll just stick around, stay in, save some money, and beast with barbara's friends. I just hate when they all speak arabic, yOU ALL SPEAK PERFECT ENGLISH, don't be fucking rude. sometimes...i don't understand that girl. like when her cat barfs and she doesn't clean it, so then I do, and then say hey the stain didnt' fully come out...and she does nothing! HELLO...you have a pet. Take care of it. Physically and emotionally. Damn thing is starved for attention. 

i think the lack of sunlight is fucking with my head. Stupid seasonal depression. Not that i'm actually depressed, but i'm way less positive/energetic than I normally am. Maybe I'm just at normal people enthusiasm level, instead of acting like a hyperactive ADD hyena on acid keeling over in laughter at the very hint of a fart. speaking of which, I can't find my fart machine. This is devastating to me. Really, it is. One time, Barbara's Hematologist/Oncologist fancy Lebanese tri-lingual doctor friend was over, and Kristy picks up this black device and says, ""hey, is that the remote control to the fart machine?"" and the Dr. is like, ""uhh no, that's my pager."" hahahaha. Welcome to room 700. 

I know something is up because I have way less of a sex drive. Maybe that's the new birth control talking. Or maybe that's the lack of sunlight, although typically my libido is unaffected by weather. Rain? Sex weather! Snow? Sex = warmth! Heat wave? I'm half-naked already, might as well go all the way! 

Alrighty, time to go to bed, look forward to haircut and trivia, and try not to get upset over hot jew. The ONLY thing that places him in the ""i could see it coming"" category is that he dated adrian, who is so fucking completely opposite from me that it's absurd to think one male could be into both of us. Anyway, it's bed time, and i really hope this trip to Turkey works out. I really want to go, even though everyone keeps talking about young women getting kidnapped into the sex trade. And that's why I typically don't drink and party on vacations! Done and done.

today i got oxtail for lunch at the jamaican food place. it was delish! hooray hooray, and high fives all around. 

at work i designed some not bad Marines shizzles. I'm kinda in holiday mode. Or should I say, HOE-liday mode. HYUCK. how do you when when someone chuckles? isn't just...a short, quick laugh? ah, mysteries of the world. 

had a meh-ish workout today yet again, i think the cold is messing with me. Could be the lack of sunlight as well. Must persevere through the winter! MUST! tomorrow I will join Darryl and Robby in some BEEFCAKE p90x workouts. Robby asks me, ""yo, you beefcakin' it up with us tomorrow?"" It's hilarious. I was actually going to do a workout with them today but Ilan and I were tossing around (a salad) jk, had to throw that in there. anyway we were thinking about seeing a movie. I was worried because the movie idea arose after a few flirty texts, while the rest of our convo that day was the usual crackbaby fodder. So, I didn't really want to go ""watch a movie"" at his house because...we all know how that goes, and i'm trying to be a motherfucking lady and mask the FREAKbag that i truly am, sexually speaking. Apart from that I think it's fair to say the cat is out of the bag. I mean, if my OkCupid profile didn't give it all away (message me ""if you lift serious weights and are not a little bitch"" was my charming endline), my random oversharing definitely has. My life is one big series of ""this one time...""

Anyway, I was going to back out but decided to go see Unstoppable, his suggestion. Hmm, i'm intrigued by this guy that has twice now dodged potential hooking up even though we already messed around saturday after the caps game when i had stayed over. interesting. Sooo the movie was actually good and i got home at 10! And i was a class-out-the-ass lady with a good night kiss instead of a good night blowjob. Good job! bahahahaha. i'm a work in progress, what can i say. 

Anyway, i am le tired and going to hit the hay. i'm kinda hONGRAY as well. i enjoy my AM ritual of coffee with splenda and delicious caramel creamer, my zombified face staring at my computer while gulping down that sweeet sweeeeet nectar of the gods, and maybe stuffing some ghetto grilled cheese sandwich into my face if i can tear my eyes away from the trashy gossip sites or bizarro workout routines i'm hopelessly addicted to reading. shrampy mcshramp.

friday we go out for mae's birthday and kristy's ""night of liberation"" because her finals are ova!! i'm going to pop a bottle of champagne, cuz we is pimpin!!! shrampin it up all over silver spring, crackhouses beware! i have a haircut next tuesday. my is actually for realsies getting longer! i love this hairstylist dude, Ian. I just want another trim, and he' sreally good at adding volume and body to my hair without hacking it all into dick baggish, pansy ass SHORT layers. meh. i don't want an effin jennifer aniston layered BOB. I hate that bitch! she's fugles. i guess i'd be bitchy if all i ate was random baby food and green smoothie shakes or whatever the fuck tracy anderson makes up for the anorexic hollywood freak babies. Actually, i would really like to make some kind of green juiced drink, toss in some kale, spinach, whatever the fuck i gots laying around. Beat this jizz out of all the free radicals whoring around my system. Free crack giveaway! Get the eff out!"

"event","balls, i had a crappy workout. apparently, drinking you ass off on wednesday and then again on saturday, combined with lack of sleep, and an assortment of chocolate peanut butter truffles with pretzel m&m's for lunch equates to a shittball workout. Also, time of the month, which is never fun. MEH. i am so annoyed at myself! i totally slacked off last week, at least I managed to do p90x legs on saturday, but i didn't even do it all because i had to leave early for the caps game. 

Tomorrow, I am redeeming myself by leaving work at 5 on the dot, speeding home, and doing an interval workout. It's going to be short, intense, and baller-ish. 

I am meeting up with Ilan and Chris Joynt at Union Jacks at 7:45 for Trivia!!! Yay!! That means I have to leave my house at 7:25. SO If I leave work at 5 on the dot, get home at 5:15, change, pee, etc, so let's say 5:25, warm up for about 7 minutes, 5:35 (rounding up here folks, yay math), 20 minute workout, 5:55, cool down for 5 minutes, mmm let's say 6:05. Jump into the shower, warp speed 10 minute shower, then 6:15 I'll  throw my clothes on and start blowdrying my hair. Sounds doable if i HUSTLE my ass off. I'm sure there will be other delays in the mix. I should figure out what to wear tonite. I think Chris is going to bring some work people, we need a team of 6. Well, 6 is max, we have 3, and the more the better. BRAINS, we needs em. I'm stoked. I fucking love trivia even though I kind of suck. Last week, it was just me and Ilan, and there was this one bonus question, and the theme was ""drugs"" and he's like, This one is allll you. And I knew the answer right away without hesitation, it was LSD (cuz the creator was a Swiss chemist that made it by accident or something). Anyway, it was kinda funny but I felt like a druggy. I don't even DO drugs, marijuana doesn't count! And neither does occasional vicodin, it's for headaches and insomnia! BUTTCAKES! 

i was reading back through old entries. fuck, they were funny. i need to get on my LJ game. Shit ain't funny no more! i guess i ""matured"" so some bullshit, but that's laughable. I think I just got LAME. 

penis penis. 
i'm going into work early to finish FOP preso shizzies, and then finally get some fucking Marines bullshit DONE. goddamit! i keep putting it off. I am a latke. I want a fucking LATKE goddamit! 

tomorrow i'm going to call and schedule a hair cut. yeah boyyy."

Weekend recap:

Friday night Oklahoma came down and we went to a Thai place. I was bored and uninterested but tried to have polite conversation. I think the reality was unavoidable that we had simply run out of things to talk about and ultimately didn't have a strong connection. He stayed over because he really had nowhere to go, and it was awkward as fuck, and the next morning I finally said, ""hey this isn't working."" He didn't seem to care, and it was somewhat odd to have this very brief exchange, but at least there's no hard feelings. All military guys are messed up in the head to some extent, and I will stick with that statement. 

K.Peeska and I went to my office where she studied and I did work for a few hours. I later went to Darryl's to do p90x, legs workout. His buddy Sean was awkwardly beasting on the couch and just sort of watching us, and had a bball game on in the background. Weird, but whatevs. I'm glad I don't get embarrassed much these days. I was trying to plan something with Ilan throughout the day, he invited me out to meet up with him and his friends after the Caps game. I couldn't find a friend to go with me, but around 4 he said he had an extra ticket! yay. I showered and got ready in record time, booya grammy. I met up with him and his friends at RFD, then we did car bombs at Bar Louie, and then watched the game. It was really fucking fun and his friends are super cool, and i got along exceedingly well with his buddy drew, who has the season ticket in the seat right next to Ilan. I guess Ilan got two side-by-side season tickets for himself so that he can always have an extra ticket to take a friend to each game. Cuteness. Sooo yeah, afterwards we hit up a couple of bars and played some games, it was fun. I crashed at Ilan's place in Bethesda and in the morning his still-drunk roommate fell head first onto the toilet and cracked the tank right in half. High five!

Today I went to Autozone, fuck yeah, time to fix my burnt out headlight. And then I uploaded some more work to my behance site, and I'm sketching out ideas for a little mini illustrated calendar. I want it to be about 5x7, smallish, so that I can easily bind it. For themes, i was thinkign about breakfast foods? And for each month I'll have something related to that season, so in january i could have a big ol plate of hot pancakes with milk. February could be a heart-shaped croissant with hot chocolate and heart shaped marshmallows. Summer months would be fruit salads, chilled juice, perhaps some yogurt with granola, i'll have to research. And the fall months could be potatoes, sausage, omelettes. Spring could be some fun pastries, maybe a waffle with berries, tea, shit like that. Anyway, I think it might be cute. I'd like to somehow illustrate the month names, do fun typography. I'm not totally sold on this idea yet, but it would be kind of fun.

that's about it for now. shramps."

"event","i just made that up and i have no idea what it means, but i'm sure it can be made into a deep and metaphorical statement! 

it's friday already, whoa. I mailed out my resume and pdf shiz to Post Typography. No reply yet. Next week I'll call for a follow up, but I'm not very hopeful about it. Sigh.

in the meantime, I have to tweak the Behance stuff, and I haven't really been in the  mood to do so. I dunno. Work has been kinda fun lately and it's messing with my resolve to actually want to leave. At least in my month of frenzy I got the resume and PDF shizzle figured out, so now IF i see an opening, I can apply ASAP. 

Also, the FOP journal redesign is kind of coming along nicely. I'm not sure if it's Portfolio ready, but it just may be! Also, I have to get started on Q4 issue of Marines, and I'm doing ""Get Some"" which is a cool section, and I'm doing a feature, which will most likely require a cover/leading page illustration!! So.......whatevs. I mean, there's always a potentially good project around the corner, so I can't really get carried away with it. I mean, Bates is a cool place to work on the whole, which is why I have stayed to long. Winter is making me want to hibernate and not do anything extra as far as design is concerned.

Tuesday I had a date with Ilan, the (pronounced ee-LAHN, israeli parents, HOT), at good ol' Union Jacks. We played Trivia. It was really fun and he's a cool guy. I can actually curse and be retarded around him, i even told him how my nickname is Tmuscle and Kristy is KPeeska and we pregame, then the soberest one of us drives to the metro while the other mixes draaanks shadily in the passenger seat, OR pour vodka into a water bottle if we want to REALLY class it up. Usually, in the 3 mins it takes to drive around the block to the metro, we have to pee again, so we have a convenient spot right by the metro parking. Two big cones, 1 for each of us, it's PERFECT. If I can tell someone about public urination after a first date, it's a good sign.

You may be asking yourselves, ""what about Oklahoma?"" Well, we are having dinner this fine evening. I think that overall, I'm not really into him. I gave it a shot but he's still the very vanilla Midwestern boy I perceived him to be, and even IF he can be brought out of his shell a bit, I don't think he'll ever really be on the Marina wavelength, and if I can't freely do Gollum impressions and yell SHRIMPS at inappropriate times, then it's not good for my soul. Also, I'm getting tired of these epic, overnight dates. Tonite I am going to go home after dinner because I really don't feel like staying over with him in a hotel in Arlington. I got SHIT to DO.

Saturday the hot Jewish hot Ilan asked if I wanted to join him and his buddies out somewhere after the Caps game. So that will probably be around Chinatown, which is red line, so i'm fiiiine with that. Although, Kristy can't go cuz of finals, unless I make an excellent argument that there are bound to be other hot guys there because where there's ONE hot guy, at least one other will follow. Am I right? I mean usually, if a girl is super hot, she's going to have at least one other super hot friend? You don't just have one FREAKISHLY attractive guy in a sea of fugles. Let's think about the statistics here. I'm no good at math, (hence the B.F.A.) so perhaps one of you math people can figure out an equation to calculate the probability of a super hot guy having other HOT ass friends. Yes, that is what I would do IF i were good at math. Once, I was high, and I was watching Jeopardy or like, some gameshow, oh wait, ""are you smarter than a fifth grader"" maybe it was, OH WAIT NO, it was the algorithm thing on the dating site OkCupid where you answer questions and rate their importance and it generates matches based on your answers. ANYWAYYYY, there was some very basic math question, and I sat there for like 45 minutes trying to doodle out some fucking algebra equation to get the answer correct. I think after an excruciating 45 minute brain drain, I had 3x + ___ = X (which actually had nothing to do with the original math question) so FINALLY I just IM'd Hools and asked her for the answer. bahahahahaha. 

HOKAY so, Wednesday we had a work networking event at Josephines. Awkward! There's stripper poles there and SHOTS SHOTS SHOTS is playing in the background and I have a miller lite in my hand, and yet I'm supposed to be chatting up some 45 year old VP about the expansion of my firm's web sector? Anyway, some dude from AARP who was maybe...30's but really fat so he looked older, was talking to me and Mimi. Then he would not leave me alone. Basically followed me around, finally I dodged him, but not before a business card exchange. He emailed me the next day, asked what I was doing over the weekend, friended me on facebook, and said some other nonsense about his law school friends being in town from Temple. THIS IS WHY I do not go to networking shit that's at fucking NIGHTCLUBS. It's weird, and the vibe is off, and somehow the line between business talk and flirting gets blurred. My coworkers all got a kick out of it, so they call him my ""baby daddy"" now. bahahaha. 

Emily and I did make a good tag team, we talked to a few folks, then pulled Deb in to legitimize the business talk. Emily is really pretty and has the South Carolina charm, I have big boobs and can throw around a fancy design term or two, and older horny men are gonna talk to us regardless. BAM. you're gone! Anyway, I rolled out a bit early to meet up with EKUIKE and Jordy(!!) at Bottom Line. A few shots later i was wastey face. I dragged them to Reserve, some ""urban"" club (which is PC for BLACK PEOPLE club), where Darryl, Robby, Emily, Ezugoo and some others were celebrating D.bro's bday. hooray! we danced and generally had drunken good times. Then i passed out all over robby in the cab ride home. hahahaha. 

thursday everyone was epically hungover at work. i ended up working late because I was slacking so much during the day. Today i'm kinda tired-ish and not really looking forward to dinner with oklahoma because i already feel bad about him thinking i'll be coming back to VA with him and then boom, i go home. I should just text/call in advance to say hey, i have to go back to my place tonite. THE END. And i won't be drinking. BYE. god i'm a bitch. 

Ariana Abud is on facebook, i haven't seen her since Tyler days! I always thought she was Jewish but she's actually Lebanese! I friended her on facebook and she sent me a message, yay! Another designer reconnected. Martina now lives in VA so we have yet to hang out. Also, Liz Bagerman who i really just barely  knew from GW from the Russian club, she's an artsy person and has moved back to DC, so she messaged me about hanging out. A big YES to that one, she was maddd cool. She was like, this blonde, super curly hair, HUGE fro, really pale skin, seriously looks like a DOLL, artsy and creative and Russian AND kinda ghetto and likes hip hop. So...she's kinda of my blonde alter ego? hahaha. She's doing some kind of wedding/interior design/decorative company, so i'd love to do some freelance for her. 

SPEAKING of which, Mae sent me an email from this dude from ADCMW looking for pro-bono illustration for an online newsletter called Full Bleed. So I emailed that shiz right away saying heyyyy bucko I'll do some free illustration for you! That magazine is read by lots of designers so it would be an excellent way to get some publicity. FUCK i am late again, gotta go to work. i need to figure out what my next design project should be. I think a little mail-able leave behind piece, maybe a little mini calendar. YES. do it do it.

On Black Friday we went to Hobbytown so pops could get some glue and paint for his model ship building kits, tee hee. Then we went to the mall, BARF. whyyy goddd whyyyy did i do that.

On Saturday I actually had great success at TJ Maxx (ofcourse). That place is my heaven. 

Friday night we had mini reunion, saturday me hools and jackie beasted at my house and had second reunion, and sunday  my mom crashed he fender of her new car in the garage. way to go! she dropped me and dad at the gym, and i was thankful for the alone time. karma...in my opinion. She was getting on my case the past two days about my weightlifting and that my legs are too big already. We got sushi afterwards, and then watched a shitload of Bizarre Foods with Andy Zimmern, my new fave show! what a nice jewish boy from New York. hahaha. his personality is so infectiously happy, i crack up watching that show over the most minor remarks because he seems so pleased with himself when he slips in a little joke, that clearly the random Asian street vendor does not understand what-so-ever. bagaiks.

after weeks of retardation regarding my PDF intro page, i FINALLY sketched out something that requires digital illustration but i think will ultimately be the correct solution. Tomorrow I will actually illustrate the damn thing, and then I just need to figure out how to make the PDF clickable? The goal is to send out the full PDF tomorrow, but if the illo takes longer, then it would have to wait until Tuesday. 

I uploaded all my work for the Touch Magazine thing that a random guy in Shanghai messaged me about via Behance. He has yet to respond. Whatevs. 

I believe that Creative Quarterly should be getting back to me quite soon regarding the entries I sent in on behalf of Bates. I hope something gets in!! Yay. I mean, I hope something of MINE gets in, but if anything gets in at all, it will make me look good cuz i took some major initiative on that. 

today at the sushi restaurant, which is in this fancy pantsy new shopping area and the place is kinda swanky, my dad didn't finish his can of sapporo, so he just walks out with an open, half full can of beer in hand. hahaha. fuck the open container laws! 

what other funny things happened. Well, i royally freaked my mom out when i hinted at wanting to do a bodybuilding contest, haha. I""m the worst russian jewish daughter ever! Between dating a black guy, dating a girl, dropping out of pre-med to go to art school, being gloriously single for years, and lifting weights hardcore, my mom should be arranging a marriage for me anyyyy day now.

The main attraction was Lada, since she's been living in Oregon for five years. She brought her b/f Ben, a fine gentleman. Half Jewish, half Korean! And Alex's g/f Doreen came. She's sweet and I'm sure she was overwhelmed with all our crazy Russian childhood tales. We went to Alex's after the bar and watched an old home video of all of us when we were about...11, and it was Alex's 9th birthday. I'm estimating ages. HILARIOUS. So ghetto Russian.

I did this bodyrock workout while waiting for my mom to take me and pops to the gym, cuz we are all sharing one car at the moment. she was taking forever so I just did the bodyrock routine, good shit, as usual. i can't find my interval timer though. if i can't find it in a week, I'll have to order another one. anyway, i did a bit of work, and then mom came home and all three of us went to the gym. awww! i also hit a new all time high, doing single arm bent over rows with 30lb DB, and then 35lb DB! Awesomeness. i am going to be sore tomorrow, I can feel it already, which means a workout tomorrow is going to be rather hellish. Oh well. i've been thinking about the female bodybuilding contests for a while now. it's just sort of a goal to work for I guess. With the long winter months on the horizon, i feel motivation draining, and I need a concrete plan. it would be fun to do one of those Crossfit games, but i'd ahve to join crossfit. that shiz is EXPENSIVE. So maybe trying to do a competition, like natural bodybuilding, IFBB, whatever those things are called, maybe that's the best way to go. the only thing is i'd need support from everyone, and i'd have to really commit to training and eating clean. That's the toughest part, for sure. Especially at work. I can't have people be giving me shit for not eating random office candy cuz i'm doing a contest, that would just demoralize me and royally piss me off. anyway, first i'm gonna finish up this job app business. meanwhile i'll just continue trying to get my lift numbers up, then figure out where i'm going with all that.

"event","so excited for the weekend
so i can do more work, haha.
but really, when i took that ""sick day"" last thursday, I got SO MUCH DONE in those crucial few hours of the morning. I really wish I could go into work at noon. I have been getting up kinda early lately and doing about an hour of portfolio work in the AM. I'm a bit groggy until the coffee kicks in, but I still get a fair amount done, plus I seem to make decisions faster earlier in the day. 

i just had some delicious quinoa. i also made a few more tweaks, resent shiz to Steven Green, my old art director from Depersico wayy back in the days of my internship. That guy loves me, even though i seriously had NO FUCKIN CLUE wtf i was doing when I interned. I didn't even know how to use InDesign. For realsies. I guess smiling a lot and being generally friendly goes a long way. 

tonight i'm going to work on the PDF intro page, that's kind of a key page I realized because it has to be minimal and clean but can be reallyyyy interesting if done correctly. I want to nail that shiz. That's what she said. Vageens.

Saturday i'm going to Mae's to use her printer to print my mom's bird pic thingy, and i'll probs bring my computer over there to do a bit of work and beast around beast-a-liciously. 

Oklahoma wants to go to a Caps game, SWEET. Saturday night caps game, booya. I may even be all american and get a hot dog and a beer at the game! fuck yeah son. 

FOP Journal, the ""Fraternal Organization of Police"" future magazine, is a redesign i'm currently working on. I'm rather excited about it. I saw another firm in B-more that's hiring, but it looks like a husband/wife duo, and I don't want to work for a married couple. Hello, third wheel. Buhh bye now.

i had a craptastic workout yesterday. Not for lack of trying. I think i'm still dehydrated somehow, i hate drinking water when i'm sick, and that's probably why. I guess drinking my FACE off on saturday and then having shitty dunkin donuts on sunday and wayyy too much coffee all week, plus being randomly sick, and taking five days off from the gym in a row will equal a shitball of a workout. my deadlifts were suckASS, shoulder press was sloppy as a sweaty ballsack after a marathon run through Death Valley, and i flat out FORGOT to do the complex finisher thing at the end, and somehow did lame-o abs routine instead, which i usually don't do these days. bullshit! must redeem myself today, probs something interval related. 

i also want to go to this thrift store called Unique Bazaar that my coworker shits her pants about. Maybe Sunday I can sneak off to do so. Fuck, I have to clean my car too. Maybe tomorrow AMbefore going to Mae's I'll get the car cleaned. Yesss my precious. That's what I shall do. booya. 

i'm really enjoying this Long Walk book. sexcellent!"

i did a little craig ballantyne bodyweight workout, way easier than the last time but I was still a bucket of sweat at the end. today, my calves are so fucking sore i can barely walk. suckssssss. 

last nite oklahoma came down, we went to mcginty's. I was kind of standoffish at first and I'm not even sure why. It's like I purposely push people away to see if they're going to put up with my crap. we had a few beers, a few shots, ended up talking about some of his army days and relationship stuff. I guess he's not as vanilla as i thought in many regards. finally i loosened up and enjoyed myself. and then we had a very loud night, after which barbs sent me a mildly irritated email, hahaha. ooooops. Today I decided to play hooky from work. Called in sick, bitches! I knew it would be a slow day at the office, and I just really didn't want to stare at the computer all day doing nothing. I was highly productive though! Oklahoma slept until 12:30, I got out of bed around 8:45 and started making logos and working on a resume. I have a few resume options to work with now, and I'm getting closer to finalizing the logo. I am going to print things out at the office uber early, and then ask darryl for feedback. I want to make the resume a little more sophisticated, and I don't really want to use Gill Sans, but it seems that using Chronicle for the text is overwhelming. I'd like to use the bold and/or bold italic for headings.

So the plan for tomorrow is get to work EARLY, do some resume printouts on the downlow, bust ass doing SMI edits and crack into Food Tech mag, and then brainstorm some more for a viral video for Bates. I don't think I'll be going out tomorrow night, I may stay in and work, or try to paint my mom's bday drawing thingy. Maybe I'll go sit around Caribou or something. Although Oklahoma has yet to let me know if he wants to do a Friday to Saturday sleepover, or Saturday to Sunday. I mean, honestly I don't care if he's here all weekend, I just want to be able to get things done and not have to constantly entertain him. Shramps. 

I want to grab the firewire from work as well, though my computer is being a creeper and I want to take it to the apple store to get it looked at. I gotta start taking note of the weird things it's been doing. BAgaikers. 

on saturday i'd really like to hit up a museum. perhaps see what's crackin at the national gallery. vageens. hokay i think that's all. I guess top priority is finishing up mom's gift, paying a few of the medical bills, getting Ocella refilled after I call CareFirst tomorrow, and passport renewal. Also, maybe saturday morning I can get my car detailed."

"event","i'm back on the sauce! and it feels sooooo gooood. i bought a big ole box of splenda (to contribute to my future impending cancer), and a delicious flavored creamer, and now i can continue my morning ritual again. INDEED. rituals make life fun. not the satanic kind, tee hee. although, i guess there's something fun about gutting rodents and making blood offerings. jk jk. 

yesterday was the Q3 press check, Priscilla met us at GPO. That girl cracks me up. She's like, 5ft tall, on a good day, Puerto Rican Marine from the Bronx, scrappy as fuck, 23, two kids, on her second marriage, and she's a completely open book. We have been getting lunch at Union Station after press checks and it turns into Priscilla therapy hour, where she spills her guts about the Marine Corps, her marriage, her in-laws, drinking, partying, guns, germs and steel (shout-out to Jared Diamond right there!) 

the rest of work was LAME, and there's a definite energy drain in the office. Not sure if it's the pre-holiday slack, or everyone getting frustrated with the lack of interesting work going on. I came home and did a workout from bodyrock.tv, which are now in real time, which is kinda cool. I am still sore as balls from deadlifts and climbing, but i gotta power through another workout today and probably do an off day tomorrow. Oklahoma should be coming down tonite for wednesday night excessive drinking. woooo. SHOTS. 

i started trying to create a monogram for myself as a little icon to use on my resume, but i quickly realized that the elaborate lettering sketches I had created were wayyy too difficult to successfully translate into vector via Illustrator. It's a good reminder that i'm NOT a typographer, and despite what the internet sells, being a typographer requires years of study and practice. THEREFORE, I am going to rethink my monogram strategy, and base it heavily off of a pre-existing font. I have found a few good ones on Veer, and I want it to be a little decorative, definitely not sans serif, something feminine, kinda swirly, clean, maybe house in a circle, and logo-like. Hooray hooray. 

Cisco is still being a dick. I really do still hope they pick one of my concepts. The origami birds are out, but the text concept is still in. However, they now went back and reintroduced like three other new concepts into the mix, so my chances of being picked are wayyy diluted. SHRAMPS. Also, I""m not entirely sure if i can show the comps as a portfolio piece due to strict Cisco privacy agreements. They're crazy with that shiz, and I don't need a Cisco lawsuit on my hands. Although, if i don't use it as a digital PDF and only have it in print in my own possession, no one will know unless they physically see my portfolio. bwahahaha. fuck you corporate lawyer packs.

i had this horrible dream that my close friends all got furiously angry at me for no particular reason, and I was literally begging them to explain why they were so mad at me, until finally someone said, ""i guess I just wanted to get angry over something, even if there was no good reason."" SO bizarre. analyze that! 

my hypochondria book is still cracking me up, as well as giving me food for thought regarding why i'm always having some paranoid freakout over my own health. i also realize the power of the mind and its ability to physically create symptoms out of mental anxiety. gotta work on that. 

today i'll be going into work early again, gotta make some CareFirst phonecalls, and then aim to go next week to dept. of state or where ever necessary to drop off my passport for renewal. SHRIMPIES.

i also have to decide if the trip to Turkey should be Turkey PLUS Greece, or just Turkey. Traveling from T to G seems to be a bit of a hassle, since there are ferries and extra flights involved. However, traveling in and around Turkey is also a pain because the cities are so widespread. BUT it wouldn't involve crossing borders, and worrying about having two kinds of currencies. Gotsta talk to KP about this shizzle. 

ight, time to read Tmuscle, brush mah teefs, put some clothes on, and roll out."

"event","today was a retarded day at work. i didn't do shit. well, i did a stupid Align illo which looked like butts and was STUPID, and then we had a stupid Cisco call. My text concept is still in the running. I hope they pick it. Shramps. If they don't, I will take it as a sign and start sniffing around for places that are hiring. I can't decide if I should try to design a logo for myself for my resume. I had some drawings of lettering but I don't want to use them unless they're perfectly polished. I don't really know enough about lettering to determine when they're polished enough. LE SIGH. I was also thinking about looking at art grants and maybe trying to do some kind of design research project? Ah, I dunno. I think I'm getting in over my head. I just want to be LEARNING more. 

I figured out what I want to draw for my mom's gift. It's going to be two birds somewhat intertwined. I did a sketch, it still needs work, I think I want to do some watercolor work on it, probably end up digitizing it to some extent. 

I had a pretty good workout today, did this time challenge thing I had done a few months ago. It seemed easier, I think it was because the temperature in the upstairs room was significantly lower this time around. The soreness from climbing has set in, so tomorrow I need to figure out what would be ideal to do so I don't burnout. Hopefully, Oklahoma can come down wednesday evening, but I'll probably be able to squeeze in a workout before he gets down here, especially if I leave work at 5:00. Bagaikers. 

press check tomorrow, booya. I'm going to take a nice long lunch and dick around Union Station afterward...cuz...why the fuck not? I ain't got shit to do. Hellz yeah.

 after work a bunch of us went to Quarry House for Emily's birthday. I only stayed for an hour but it was fun. Ezugoo was there! Yay. He's awesome. I'm so excited for Thanksgiving!@#!$@

i started researching Turkey as a vacation destination. It's a bit complicated because we want to do Turkey and Greece. I must renew my passport first! ahhh. I have to call insurance tomorrow regarding birth control, and then PASSPORT renewal. Must do it. SHRIMPS."

"event","booya, feeling better. no kidney stone (that came up on x-ray at least), and I've been feeling much better. the doc said the tests showed no serious issues, no infection, so most likely it was just post UTI irritation and it will go away on its own. avoiding caffeine and alcohol for a few days should have me back to 100% by Friday, hooray. i also got a book about hypochondria that is actually HILARIOUS, it's written by this young, Jewish female author, and it's seriously cracking me up. the upside to all this random feeling ill is that i've developed a new bedtime routine. No computer for an hour before bed, reading instead! It's glorious. I have started going to bed earlier as well, which is really nice because for a while there i'd be up until 12:30 or 1AM every night looking at workout articles or design websites. Breaking habits is a bitch. 
 
And now the boring workout portion of the post: 
On Friday I finally bench pressed 30lb dumbbells. I was rather surprised that I could do it since I've been on gym hiatus. I think I am about to kick up the lifting a notch. I'm going to see how much I can actually increase in the big three lifts: bench press, deadlifts, and squats. All the other shit I'll keep low weight and high volume so I don't get all huge, not that I really would, but my back is wide enough where mediums are reallyyyy snug these days. hahahaha. shramps. 

Anyway, I was kind of having a high anxiety day on Friday, and during parts of my workout my heart was beating so fast I thought it would explode, so I'd have to put down my weights. It was less from the strain of working out, more from just being overwhelmed with thoughts of ""am I all better yet? wait, was that bladder pain? am I going to feel sicker after the workout?"" Anyway, I made it through, suppressed a full out anxiety attack, high fives. 

On Saturday a magical thing happened. I decided to deadlift a bit, I accidentally loaded 35lb plates instead of 25lb plates. I thought it would be too hard but I pulled through for two, or was it three, sets of 10. Then this little, short, beefy black dude wanted to work in sets with me. Turns out he was a bodybuilder! YAYYYYYY. I tried to hide my excitement. He then asked if I was loading on more plates for my last set, and I felt like I HAD to or else I'd look like a pansy in front of this dude who was deadlifting 225, sooo we upped the weight for a total of 135. I seriously could not lift that shit for the first three tries, but he had some encouraging/threatening words, LOL, and eventually I got out 2 or 3 reps. HOORAY. Very exciting. It was a goal of mine to be able to deadlift my own weight or higher, ofcourse i'd like to get to a full set of at least 8 but ideally 10-12 reps of 135. All in due time. So then I figured i'd ask him to help me squat in the squat rack because I never load up on weight for a squat cuz...I never have a spotter and I don't want to kill myself. So I ended up doing three full sets of 10 with 115lbs in the squat rack!!! ;asdfkjads;fkjas;ldfkjas;dlkfja;sdfj. It was fucking HARD. He really had to help me on that one, but I'm glad I finally broke the barrier of doing low weight squatting. High fives all around. 

So after all that, I showered, beamed in pride for a while, and then Oklahoma Jason came down. I showed him my office, and then we got some food at the Pho place i'm obsessed with. I got this ""golden crepe"" thingy there, it's this fried dough thin crepe with a buttload of vegetables, pork and shrimp inside. With sauce. And a buttload of alfalfa, and thinly sliced cucumber sticks and carrot sticks and some sauerkraut thingy. DELICIOUSNESS. Then we saw Social Network, good shit. And then he stayed over. Sunday we got some delightful food at La Madeleine, fucking LOVE THAT PLACE, and then I went rock climbing with Andy at the Earth Trek gym in Rockville. Fuck yeah. I felt terrible because I couldn't belay since I...didn't remember how to tie/fasten any of the fucking knots. So I climbed a few climbs with Andy belaying, and then we bouldered the rest of the time since that doesn't require one to belay you. That shit is fucking HARD. Andy has the perfect body/proportions for climbing though. He's all long and lanky and skinny. I was struggling like a mofo and my hands are all torn up. There was some delicious eye candy there I tell ya. All these rugged mountain men with shirts off and shaggy hair and big muscles and bulging veins. hollerville. The chicks are fucking BADASS too, they're jacked and strong as hell. I was already planning a pull-up workout routine watching everyone kicking ass. I could barely do the intro level bouldering paths. balls balls. 

i'm leaving for work in a bit, gonna go in early, dick around, do some cisco shit, i did a FIFTH concept, kill bill, the folks at cisco are being super picky and we thought we had it locked down with my last two concepts but now they're wanting to see other things. Eek. 

Marines press check for Q3 on Tuesday! Yay!! I'm stoked. 

Gotta figure out what to fucking draw for my mom's present. GRR. I was thinking of something Russian looking, or something doctor-like, which is super lame and probably won't work. LE SIGH. I can't decide. Cannot decide. I need to brainstorm ideas as though it were a real life project. Shramps."

"event","yesterday morning, at like 5am, i was having all these bladder issues, and then i started going to the bathroom literally every ten minutes, which lasted until around 2pm. This was very inconvenient at work. Then it all stopped and I was totally fine for the rest of the night. I don't understand wtf is going on. today i had my appointment with the urologist. I told him all of my random symptoms. All of my urine tests were negative for infections. He said that based on my complaints, and the of the stuff on the urine analysis, he thinks I may have a kidney stone. (???wtf???)

I had an ultrasound and an X-ray done, tomorrow I'm going in early to the urologist to go over the results. Part of me wants to just know what the issue is, but the other part of me really hopes I don't have a kidney stone. Maybe it's just an inflamed bladder, and it will go away on its own after a while if I avoid the trigger foods and drink lots of water. I'm scared of all the weirdo bladder tests that they could possible do. Stuff inserted into your urethra does not sound like fun. I really don't think I have a kidney stone though, I'm really not in any kind of pain, though I was having some back pain for a few days. Still, it's not intense and I laid on a heating blanket until it basically went away. 

i feel like i'm a freakin zombie. I don't want to do anything, I just want to curl up in bed and sleep. I went to bed at 8 last night. i can't seem to get a good night's sleep, even though last night I wasn't having any issues, but I kept worrying that something might occur, since the symptoms seem to come and go in spurts. It sucks. The doc gave me some samples of some kind of medicine that's usually given to men with enlarged prostates, hahaha, it widens your urethra to help pass urine and to also aid in passing a kidney stone. 

i really want to see Social Network, and Jason said he'd go see it with me, but I'm scared to commit to two hours in a movie theater in case i have to freakin use the bathroom every ten minutes. if there was ever a time that i truly wanted to kill myself, this would be it. i'm going to go home and watch the MTV challenge thingy with KP, i love that show, and then maybe go to the gym if i am feeling up to it, or just do yoga at home. that would probably relax me a bit more. i even got a book about panic attacks/anxiety at the library, and another one about hypochondria. part of me is like, what if they can't figure out what's wrong with me, and then it's just this cycle of me being anxious about symptoms reappearing, and then it actually happens cuz im worrying about it so much. It's a vicious cycle."

"event","my bladder is rebelling.
so today i called my mom and she called in a prescription for me because of my constant peeing, and constant sensation that I had to pee, even directly after using the bathroom. It was driving me nuts. The meds finally kicked in but i'm still not 100% better and i'm completely freaked out as to why this could be happening. Either i still have a UTI, and it's spreading to my kidneys as we speak, or i have some bladder malfunction/infection. Whatever the case may be, i'm anxious as fuck, and I got zero sleep last nite waking up to constantly use the bathroom. I feel like an old man with an enlarged prostate. i emailed my doc today asking about an appointment and they didn't get back to me. Tomorrow, i'm calling/emailing allll effin day until i get a response. Good thing today i was productive at work so tomorrow I can sit in on the Cisco call, wrap up National Parks, and try to talk myself off the ledge. My mom asked that they fax my medical history to her office. I am going to ask the same of the ObGyn office, and the gastroenterologist, so that she has all of my stuff to reference. seriously, this is like, absolutely horrible for me. it's worse than an std scare. i pee alll the fuckin time as it is, and now it's just comical, and i can't get any rest, not to mention i'm really uncomfortable. also, i think i'm getting a cold. my throat is a puffball, so i chugged some tea/water/AirBorn. 

somehow, i managed to get a few key things accomplished today. i finally got my knee socks for my halloween costume, and printed/cut out my pins! everything is good to go, minus the fake blood. i'll experiment tomorrow, or just wait until friday morning. hehehe. glorious! 

i also went to walmart with KP and got some Burt's Bees shampoo, pomegranate and soy, and it smells amazing and my hair feels really clean. I got TP, toothpaste, dish soap, and generally succeeded at housewife duties. Then the magic REALLY happened. I finally laid out my clickable PDF portfolio! It's very bare bones, and I have to figure out what pieces are extra, because I have a couple extras in there at the moment. I want to change out the fonts as well, but I have a general idea of the labeling system and how the typography is going to look. Plus, i found a really nice reference piece, and a site with some great tips. So i am very happy about that. I guess things happen for a reason because if i was 100% healthy today, i'd be doing some batshit crazy interval workout and then never getting around to creating this PDF. Jolly good. Victor called me today about a job offer, but it was for web. Still really nice of him to actually call me, especially because I'm pretty sure he already forwarded me the job info about a week or two ago. I realized that I'm really glad to be on good terms with most of my exes. I think the worst was with retard Chris, i guess threatening to put a restraining order on someone dampens the friendship. Whatevs, it was worth it. buh bye now. 

What else. Oh! Oklahoma boy called me today. He's so easy to talk to. I think we're going to get dinner on Friday night. I have no idearrr what's going on with Halloween parties/bar crawls, but I'll be dressing up on Friday for work, so if everything else falls through, at least my coworkers will see the costume. Also, if i'm actually getting a cold, the last thing i want to do is haul ass all over DC drunkenly in a skirt with no jacket. BEen there, done that, and my body no likey.

i got ingredients for fake blood. sweet. i printed my pins but they were the wrong size, so that's on the to-do list tomorrow, as well as getting the knee highs, and then i'm allll set. HOORAY. Katie brought me some empty girl scout cookie boxes, so that will complete the look. My skirt is all hemmed, and I have the perfect brown shoes to go with the outfit. booyaka x 1000

so today at work, i was busy, i finally figured out the Parks feature, but now I realize it will not be portfolio worthy. Sad day, but it is what it is. On a good note, the Afghan feature is jolly good, and I think that my Cisco stuff will be a portfolio piece, which is great. It looks different than my other stuff, and will be nice to include. Now i need to figure out a  layout for clickable PDFs, which will be a BITCH and a half. baby steps, baby steps!! i also scanned in the letterforms i had sketched as a logo for myself. I'll start tracing those over, we'll see what happens. That's kind of a random side project and not really something I want to rely on heavily, self identity projects are notoriously hard to do and very time consuming.

At work Uri messaged me asking if I'd want to go to the DC drag race, or this Rabbi speaker. I declined, but upon further thought decided i'd really like to see the drag race. Soooo I got home and blew up his phone/gchat, eventually he called as he was just about a block away and said he'd be going to the Rabbi speaker first, then drag race. I decided, why the fuck not, I'll listen to the rabbi chat about evolution. The talk ended up being really great, and it was the first time i heard a fucking rabbi say, ""we all love the Genesis story, but we all know it didn't really happen."" DAMN. Was not expecting that. He spoke about Darwinism, and reconciling religion with science. It really made me want to read his book. One of my main issues with religions was the blatant disregard for scientific proof and asinine adherence to outdated belief systems that were long ago discredited by modern research/technology in within the scientific world. Turns out, i'm the tard that's been under a rock for years, and obviously other religious jews are educated enough to know that the world was not created in 6 days, etc. etc. I'm not particularly religious, but i do enjoy  learning about the different schools of thought. i'll have to investigate the topic more. good times.

we did get to the drag race after it ended, sadly. Saw a few drag queens, blah blah, chicks with dicks, jolly good.

oklahoma boy texted me a freakin novel. he wanted the link to my coroflot site. I know he has a blackberry and i think people with blackberries forget that regular, non-smart-phone peoples can receive small texts at a time, so each of his texts = 3 text messages on my phone. He liked my work though. I swear, when guys see my design portfolio, they like me a little more. hahaha. who knew design was so pimpin? 

speaking of which, matt praetzel from bethlehem is a big fan of my work, i did a bird illo for his site (after our brief fling), and he wants me to do some web design for him. he's starting a company with his buddy Marty, and wants to literally tutor me in some web shiz and then hire me for design work. I told him i'd be down, but i am busy at my regular job, plus i generally am uncomfortable with web design, BUT willing to learn. He's a huge fan of my work, and it's nice to work with someone you actually know and trust. so that's kind of exciting!

well my stomach has been feeling really good lately, and I think it's from the bulgur wheat i've been cooking, and minimizing spicy foods and soda. High five. Too bad my ass explodes every morning, not sure what that's all about. I finally caved and called my mom asking about the post UTI symptoms. I used to have cystitis back when I was a kid. Literally for YEARS I'd just be peeing every 5 minutes. It was ridiculous. My mom offered to call in some meds but said I should get a THIRD urine test just to triple check that the UTI is gone. Ofcourse now I'm paranoid that I am developing a kidney infection, so I'm going to have some fucked up bladder problems, and I pee enough as it is without some crazy muscle spasm so good lord can this please just go away ASAP.

I called Health Advocate to help me find a good family doctor. Hooray! Emily recommended that I call them. That was nice of her. I guess she found a good gyno that way. Speaking of gynos, i love mine! She was so nice. And she didn't give me a hard time for wanting to get a herpes test. Some doctors try to talk you out of it, not sure why. Anyway, I got my results, STD free, not that I was actually worried about that, but still nice to know. 

I did a workout with darryl last night, it was this Craig Ballantyne shiz I had done before, and it was much easier yesterday, either because I'm in better shape, or because it was wayyyy cooler outside. Or a bit of both. High fives. 

I also think I can finally go up to 30lb dumbbells on a bench press. I should have been able to do this long ago, but I don't train to specifically increase my weight load. I just do a little bit of everything and as long as I'm getting consistently stronger, it's OK. Not trying to hit any specific number. Oh, except being able to do ONE unclefucking pullup, christ on a bike. 

Last night I basically worked out the type on my poster. Simple and clean. I have to add some roots and shiz, I may do that on m y work computer, come in early one day. The mouse on the new computer is a pain. Then that will be done, high fives. My cisco shit is going well, I think I smell a portfolio piece. Today I am busting ASS to get the National Parks shiz looking hot as ballsssss. Fingers crossed, mofolicious!

miriam came over on sunday and we took a walk. beasted at the mall, tried to find her a halloween outfit, went to New York and Co. and Loft, and i realized i need to do some clothes shopping. I got a pair of jeans two weekends ago and somehow feel like that's enough for my fall shopping. I need to stop it up a notch. I did get a raise, after all, and I can afford a few new jackets and some fall coats. 

ummmm did i write about Jason, the guy from Oklahoma I met at Midtown? I guess not. Men...who can keep track of em? Anyway, met this dude at Midtown, Jason: Oklahoma boy, history major, ROTC, did the army, lived in germany, traveled around, seemed cool and not retarded. Points all around. Let me also say that when KP and I got to the bar, it was empty, and we instantly did 3 shots each. Hokay so, dancing, draaanking, a stripper pole here and there, good times, then I was talkin to Jason, then we made out, i was just having a jolly ole time, before i leave he asked for my number, peace out playa. Saturday he calls me to invite me on a date to Brickskellar. I was kinda hungover and lazy but thought he was cute so we met up and had a really fun time. It was late and he got a hotel to crash at so he wouldn't have to drive back to Quantaco, VA (marines base), so i stayed over, and he was a gentleman. He didn't even try to feel me up. LOL. I also kept it in mah pants, which I am proud of. We got lunch the next day, and I went home. He has a curfew on base, 10:30pm, (hi i'm 4 years old), and he's there for training for some DEA shit, so that sucks, and why the fuck can't i meet some non-military men around here?? I swear to god. In philly, if there was one black guy in a room full of whiteys, he'd find me. no doubt. In DC, it's crawling with military, and i always end up talking to them. whatevs. it's the haircut. it's fucking hot. i feel like my life is one big porno fantasy sometimes.

so we'll see if we hang out again, i'm not really going to contact him because he lives fucking FAR and I'm not about to like, sneak into the fucking barracks, been there done that with Sean Buckley, the Marine from Kentucky, holler back freshman year at Gdub! haahaha. those days are ovah! just like slavery.

today i pick up my hemmed skirt from the koreans. Then, i go to dollar store for my knee highs, and then i experiment with fake blood. honeslty, i'm debating canceling this date i have tomorrow with some okcupid dude because A. I don't even know the guy and he seems lame, and B. i reallyyyy want to sit at home and figure out the right viscosity for my fake blood for halloween. IT'S IMPORTANT GODDAMIT. And it's my gym off day so it will be perfect! ok that's it, i'm totally canceling. Fake blood > okcupid rando. That's just how it is, I don't make the rules! hahahah

ok time for work. nya."

"event","word word,
today was crazytown at work and tomorrow will be the same! I intend on getting massive amounts of shit done. The Parks feature is coming along nicely, I have a basic idea and now just need to sink some quality design time into it. hoorays. i did a cisco live! logo, and only two other people made one, despite the fact that i had THREE comps for the rest of the project, when some had 1 or even none. Anyway, I did it, it looks good, I learned a bit about typography in the process. I've also been learning how to prep files for ZMags, which is sweeeet. I think I'm going to be able to use my typographic comps for Cisco for my portfolio. The website is going to look bangin, thanks to some pre-made templates, tee hee. The concept is developing nicely though, and I'm stoked! 

For Q3 I still need to fuss with one small design element in an otherwise nicely designed feature story about Afghanistan. I think that will be a portfolio piece as well, but I'm not 100% sure. I'll have to see. 

The Haiti poster is good, I started sketching type today and got a nice little start, but I definitely need to build off of a pre-existing font, because my endeavors at font creation are pitiful and massively disappointing. All in due time, though. The lettering book published by Post Typography is actually a nice, quick read. I started looking over the font breakdowns and explanatory terms for things like a ""crossbar"" and a ""joint,"" all relating to the pieces of letters. Good stuff! 

I am still worried about the design of a clickable PDF. I have a random assortment of pieces to show, and they are not very conducive to the clickable PDF format. Maybe I can think of a better way to show my work. I am OK with coroflot, so far, but overall I think a simple wordpress site or something of that nature may be prettier. I just need SIMPLE, and easy to manipulate and update. Help? Cindy? suggestions? 

I tried on my Halloween costume, I just need the knee highs, and I should probably get the skirt hemmed, it's too long and weird looking. I'll take it to the Koreans tomorrow, see what they can do. Buttforests. 

I have a dentist appt monday, and then i still need to get a fucking physical. i'll ask the dentist if she can recommend a doc, i just reallyyyy don't like/trust the current family doctor practice i go to. they are great for like emergency appts, cuz they're close and always available. but...they are kind of toolish. buh bye now. 

fuck i still have to make my mom some kind of birthday gift. It would be awesome if I could just creepishly print and frame the tree from the haiti poster, sans lifesaver? Double dipping.

I also would like to create an emblem/logo for myself, for branding purposes on my resume, but that's at the bottom of the totem pole. Bleh. I don't want to get stuck in this cycle of ""oh...when such and such piece is completed, THEn i'll start designing a clickable PDF."" I've been doing that and I need to buckle down, get shit done. Also, it would be fun to do the album art for arwen's band and use that as a piece, but it's also hard to design for something that may or may not get printed, without any artistic direction or advice. It's been hard enough with the Haiti poster, and I have complete visual control over it. Meh. If it were easy, everyone would be doin it. That's what she said?

Sunday I may go indoor rock climbing with Andy. Fingers crossed.

Today I had a freaking ten hour day at work and couldn't wait to kick ass in the gym. However, when I got there, I was really crampy and unmotivated. Luckily, I was too embarrassed to leave within 15 mins of getting there, and I had left Seth's fleece (that I've somewhat adopted) in this shelf thing by the front door, so i couldn't sneak out unnoticed from the upstairs balcony exit. The shame of leaving after a lame non-workout got to me. Soooo I sucked it up and I did this metabolic circuit thing with a 45lb barbell, usually I stick with 35, but the reps were low. The only thing that fucked me over were high pulls. Apparently, whatever muscles are required for those are weak as shit on me. The jump for 35 to 45 nearly killed me and I had to throw out he high pulls all-together for the third and fourth sets. Overall, I liked the circuit, but I definitely need to be doing more than 5 reps per exercise for those kinds of drills. I think 8 is a minimum. So, the goal is to practice high pulls more often at a lower weight so that I can continue to use them in metabolic circuits at lower reps with a higher weight, instead of just not doing high pulls within the circuit. 

ok ANYWAY, I did some bench side to side hops, which I love, but I freakin SPRAY sweat all over the place. I'm a sweat machine these days! I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing. It's only during workouts, I guess I'm cooling off more efficiently. I'm not getting tired as fast, I'm just a sprinkler. Push-ups are way easier now-a-days, but the pull-up situation is pitiful. The machine is messed up (really it's just the little metal cylinder you stick into the weight plates to set your weight), they need to get a new one that's not bent to hell. I wish there was a medicine ball there, I refuse to haul mine to the gym. Kettlebell, yes. Med ball, never. And that's that!

I think that's all. Rents are back from Switzerland. I need to get my passport renewed. mofolicious. 

Tomorrow Mae is coming over and we're probably going to go out, get a little wastey. I need to party. ParTAY."

i keep thinking this UTI is still lingering, even though i'm sure the Cipro killed everything in my body, ever ever everrr. Thank god I have my annual gyno exam on wednesday. i manifest all kinds of symptoms in myself cuz I'm fucking CRAZYYY town. I keep peeing because I keep thinking I have to pee. This used to happen to me as a kid all the fucking time. I had this pee paranoia that I'd be on the school bus or camp JCC bus and have to pee. So then i'd keep thinking about it until i'd actually have to pee. Good lord, I need a tranquilizer dart. Seriously, I am such a ridiculously anxious, anxiety-filled person, I don't even know how I function sometimes.

I got a new pair of jeans. They are delightful! I also have to get knee socks for my Halloween costume, and then it shall be complete! And fake blood, and brain printouts for the badges. Yesss my precious. I have to put it all on together, I hope it looks good! The only thing I'm worried about is the fugly skirt I got. It's a really unflattering cut but there were seriously no khaki skirts, and it was cheap, and I really didn't want to spend all day looking for a stupid skirt I'd realistically wear ONCE. Sharts! Plus, this way, I can cut it if I want to, and get fake blood all over it. Or barf on it! 

Poster is looking swell. Time to start working on typography!

Today I went to the gym and there was the big fat black lady exercise class upstairs, and three people doing P90X from a laptop as well, all in the upstairs room. It was all hot and gross, and I started doing this intense circuit and felt like i was going to puke after about the fourth exercise. I toned down the pace, did the easier exercises, then decided since I was just sick and on antibiotics and out of the gym for a week, I should take it slow. I went downstairs and salvaged my workout with some heavy weights. AND I deadlifted in the squat rack. FUCKK YEAH. If the big bar is 40lbs, which it must be at LEAST, I added 10lb plates on each side, and then I added another 5lbs per side, and then another 5lbs per side. So 40 + 40 = 80lb deadlift. Yay. I always feel a bit awkward doing them but they do feel good. I need someone to watch my form, mainly my back. Lower back, really. I feel it arching too much, me thinks. I read that's a problem with women. 

Anyway, I did that, and I also FINALLY did some single leg squats on the aerobic step, which i've been wanting to do but being shy about it for some bizarre reason. Basically, everything I have been too shy to try, I have now tried. I think...
So excited! 
Actually, I have yet to squat heavy weight in the squat rack. That will be the next fear to conquer. One step at a time.

PA was marvelous. I stayed at Noam's. Yael and her two daughters were there. Prince the poochie was there, obvi, as well as Yehuda and Vika, and I went and snatched Peen from the Gershtein's for one night. Full house! They have the best food there, and it's all so fresh and healthy and delicious. mmmmmmm my precious. I'm always amazed at how much Hebrew I understand when I'm over there. Noam's dad makes it a point to speak to me in Hebrew and gauge my understanding. 

Noam got me a Firefox tshirt and a pink tshirt with a pride of lions on it (gay pride, get it...hehehe). On Saturday I did some errands and then we all had delicious dinner, took a walk with Justin the neighbor, and then watched a documenty called Encounter Point about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and some non-violent organizations advocating peaceful resolution and open communication. Good stuff, good stuff. Made me want to go to Israel. 

Speaking of travel, I need to get my passport renewed, ASAP. 

I presented THREE cisco concepts, everyone else did 1 or ZERO. So there! And they picked 2 of my 3. The one they didn't  pick was actually one that Seth ended up making visuals for last minute according to his personal vision. Basically, I kicked ass. Tomorrow, I intend to kick more ass. I'm trying to stay positive and do great work, be a part of the team, and minimize conflict. I have a new Parks feature that has the potential to be AWESOME, and I have lots of time to work on it, so that will hopefully be a portfolio piece!! EEk!

Giant didnt have quinoa, sadly, so I got bulgur wheat instead. I AM IN LOVE. I made a delicious dish of garlic, onion, olive oil, cracked pepper, sea salt, mushrooms, fresh tomatoes, carrot, lime, and cilantro, mixed with the bulgur wheat. SO GOOD. And best of all, it didn't hurt my tummy at all! My new thing is to really be conscious of portions when I eat mushy foods such as bulgur. I tend to really load up when I place food into a bowl, and then keel over in pain when my stomach is full, so today I put the food into an actual cup, so it was just about an exact recommended serving. I think that really helped. Jolly good! I'm excited about this new food that's tasty and tummy-friendly. I can't wait to experiment more with it, you can make it as a hot, sweet cereal in the morning, or do savory dishes, or even baked things. 

Ok, i'm attaching a pic of the poster. I need to create the type for it. I'm verrryyy excited to do so.
Also, Martina contacted me...she may be moving to VA for a job! Yay! Another Tyler person in the area! I always liked Martina, she's sweet. And she's a man eater and really hot and probably fun to go out with. BAM, molest fest, hide your kids, hide your wife.

i am sick of work. yes, yes i am. i want to frolic outside and not be cooped up indoors. I think I'm somewhat pissy because I had all these ideas for Cisco, and, one by one, they're not really coming to fruition in the comps. We are showing shit internally today, and I'm kind of dreading it. SIGH. big fat sigh. Also, Ernie pissed me off yesterday with his random enforcement of office rules and favoritism, and I really can't be around him right now. He plays favorites,and he's a diva.

I got my new computer!! I need to transfer all of my files and load CS4 onto it. Hooray hooray! Maybe I'll do file transfer/music transfer tonight. Then load CS4 over the weekend. 

I did the Ballantyne kettlebell routine yesterday, again. Dare I say...it's getting eaiser? I timed it this time 31:08:60, or something like that. Booya. I definitely recall it taking way longer the other times because I'd be doing it with either Arthur or Josh, so that would slow me down, plus it was crazy hot on both of those days that I tried the routine, and the AC in the gym SUCKS ballsacks. (haha, i just wrote ballsacka at first. i like it.)

I was in the upstairs room at el gimnasio and this hispanic dude was training this young black chick and some asian chick. they had this mesh rope thing tied to a pole and were doing jumps. That was kind of strange, but whatevs, i then was a creeper and faced the wall awkwardly while doing my swings. Then a group of about four black ladies, and their trainer, swarmed the place. I was trying to wrap up my last sets of pushups and definitely maxing out so I kept face planting. I got up from a faceplant to open the side door to let them in. Then, I look up and this big ol big tittied lady has her shirt off, just a bra, and they are snapping some kind of ""before"" pictures, while the trainer dude had his back turned. I was like, huh? can't you do this NOT in a public setting?? for rizzles. So that was bizarre. 

I left and then beasted my beastie butt off at home, and made actually a nice sketch that was inspired by ""Yellena's Blog."" I think it's some Russian (duh) chick that makes GORGEOUS beautiful whimsical drawings inspired by seaweed and coral and anemones. Seriously, it's beautiful. Eh fuck it, I link y'all asses up. http://yellena.com/blog/
the first few images aren't that mind blowing but if you keep scrolling, it's a guaranteed boner. 
BONERS'r'US. 

saturday arween and i are having a molest fest day. Great Falls for a hike, me thinks. Though maybe something other than the Billy Goat Trail. Shrimpin and pimpin. 

and then PHO. YES. yes my precious.

arthur and i went to two wineries in VA on saturday. We drove down this one gorgeous road, it was called Bust Head Road. bwahahahaha. The only memorable wine was a Port wine from La Grange winery. SO GOOD. And i had the most delicious piece of chocolate I have ever encountered. The Pearmund winery was really scenic and we played some bean bag games and beasted around the premises, peeked into the barn and this big stone silo built around a huge tree. There was also a cute doggie. We got some grub at Crisp N Juicy. I also had Arthur do an outdoor interval workout with me in the morning, but he had to stop about 1/3 of the way into the second round :(
I finished the second round but ditched the 3rd, and we both did some random shiz in the gym instead. Glorious. 

On Sunday I did a workout I hadn't done since April, and shaved four minutes off my previous time. Nice! 

My IBS has really been acting up lately. I need to reevaluate what I've been eating. I think I should cut down on coffee and sodas. I started drinking more soda lately and that may be the culprit. Buttfors. I also eat a lot of that spicy Korean food that I love oh so much. I want Mimi to take me shopping at the Korean market she goes to so I can see what to buy and replicate the amazingly delicious things that her grammy makes. I also want to get some soymilk, nuts, and dried papaya because I recall that exact combination being very IBS friendly for me. 

today i took my shoes to the cobbler. then i churned butter and chopped some logs. J/K, but for real, I didn't even know cobblers existed still! The dude was super nice and even told me how to clean suede with a water-vinegar mix! My car passed inspection, and tomorrow I need to get the official pass document (because the one thing they ""failed"" me for was that my seatbelt buckle in the backseat was shoved into the seat cushions and they wanted to charge me $20 to remove the whole seat and did the buckle out...EFF that. I told them buh bye now, picked up the car, reached my hand in there and dug around for 30 seconds, grabbed that jawn, and saved myself the money). However, I have to bring it back to them at 7:30 AM (kill) so they can officially pass the car now that the devilish belt buckle is in place. 

I also am going to ask around for recommendations on what MacBook Pro upgrades I should get. 2.2 GHZ, 2.4...etc. I dunno wtf it all means, I just want Photoshop to run fast. 

I can't decide what to make for my mom for her bday. I got a nice frame with a mat inside from TJ Maxx (my preciousss) and I was thinking of making some kind of portrait of my mom, or some crazy ink drawing? So far, my sketches suck balls. Further investigation is in order. 

Friday is Andy's party and I plan on getting wastey face. BOOYA. 

I need a trim, my hair is getting all dead-endy and naist-ified. 

Wednesday I guess I'll go to the MVA to try and complete the car registration. GULP. Then computer purchase on Saturday. Dun Dun Dunnnnn. AND LASTLY, I will begin the nerve-racking process of renewing my passport. If that shit gets lost in the mail, it's going to open up a whole can of pain-in-the-ass worms. Fartstains.

I got ginger tea from H-Mart. It's intense. 

Umm what else. OH! I helped Mimi move this morning. Me, D.bro and Biggie Pralls (my coworkers) helped out. I Tmuscled it up and made myself useful. 

Tomorrow we're getting lunch at work and doing our Cisco kick-off. Since I'm getting in early, I want to print all SMI stuff for P2. Booyaka. Go over that before Cisco with Meemz. Shizzle my nizzle? Indubitably so!

Arthur and I also went to the Shabbat dinner at the Moishe house on friday. The girls there are fugles. I swear, these chicks make me look like fuckin Sophia Loren. Too bad most of the men are unfortunate looking as well. There's a ""mystical torah"" study thing on weds, followd by hookah. If i can get a workout in beforehand, I plan on attending. My elbow is a little fucked up cuz i laid on it funny while watching Spun (which is a crazy ass movie about meth addicts, redonkulous). Anyway, today I may or may not have aggravated said elbow with the moving of boxes, we shall play by ear regarding tomorrow's workout. Maybe i'll just do something leg-heavy. Fartstains abound.

I'm in the mood to dress up and go on dates. Sugar daddy time. I gotta step up the game and start pimpin. I've been on hiatus, and I think the pimp cane is causing a commotion at the retirement home, so it's time to bring it out of retirement and let the beast loose for a bit. rawr!

"event","I saw Seymour Chwast speak today at the Corcoran, he's 79 years old, adorable and has inspired me to do more hand-done work. 

I have a pretty solid Haiti sketch on 11x17 paper, and I'm going to bring it into work tomorrow for feedback. after that I hope to tighten it up, trace the whole thing over if needed, then scan the trace. the main thing is to decide if i want to keep it all hand-done and just do minor clean up in Photoshop, OR, trace it in illustrator. I'm torn. I may do both and see how it goes? The beauty of tracing it in illustrator is that changing the colors only takes seconds, and there are endless possibilities opened when you duplicate the individual pieces and rearrange them. I always get to this point with ""hand made"" projects...they end up getting traced on the computer, then I layer texture on top. It is what it is. I'm attaching a pic of the new sketch for reference, since i've been babbling about this damn poster for months. 

I want to make my mom a nice ink drawing for her birthday. I need to buy a preframed painting from TJ Maxx or something, and then remove the painting and place my drawing into the frame. booyaka. its my dirty little trick. usually tj maxx or ross has really niced framed and matted artwork that's really cheap, wayy cheaper than a custom framing or getting a special mat cut. I'll have to find the perfect frame, then draw to fit the size. i was looking at some chagall work for inspiration. 

I'm going to a shabbat dinner at moishe house on friday and a winery on saturday. Oct 14 noam is comin to allentown so i'll come home for that weekend, although my parents won't be home...soooo I'm not sure. IF he's going home for thanksgiving as well, maybe I'll hold off, but I have to figure it all out. butts. 

I got my signature notarized today, inspection tomorrow, hopefully MVA Friday if all goes well. eek. i hope the car doesn't need big repairs. fartstains.

lately i've been fantasizing about the ideal design lifestyle. I want a big awesome studio with lots of natural light, every art supply imaginable, and lots of like-minded artists and designers to share a studio space with. I really miss school these days. I keep finding awesome fine artists online, this one chick would explode fireworks with paint to create amazing paintings. Shit like that makes me want to take more art classes, learn to processes, mediums, do shape explorations. So much to learn still, and I really spend a ridiculous amount of time each day looking up artists and designers, exposing myself to work, but all it really does is depress me to some extent because I can't afford to sit around until 2am and just paint random ass bullshit or take a typography class. it's so frustrating. i've realized that being an artist is like living with a constant desire that only grows bigger and bigger as you seemingly try to feed it. it's a bit cruel really, and i can see why many artists are a bit crazy. i will say that today at the lecture i was never more certain that i chose the right line of work for myself. That is a GREAT feeling. I think a lot about quality of life and how I choose to spend my time. I'm kind of going to scale back on the workouts a bit, maybe I'm just in a workout rut, but I think it's the artistic side of me bubbling up. Things are always cyclical in my life, and fitness will remain important forever, but if there's a night where I want to dick around and get messy with some paints instead of having a marathon workout, I'm going to go with the artistic flowwwwww and feed the artsy urges. Also, I associate fall with school. I love LOVE love being active in the fall, but I also get into school mode, despite the fact that this is my third fall not being in school. I miss you, school! We will meet again. ACTUALLY, i want to be an apprentice. Even for someone random, like a printmaker. Something that's not directly related to my field of work. To be immersed in art 24/7 under the guidance of a skilled professional...that is a big freakin wet dream come true. Think about the learning curve. Woo, gives me chills. My brain would explode every day. 

Ok enough of that. Maybe Sunday I'll go hiking, if the winery doesn't fulfill my Fall outdoorsy needs. If winery DOES fulfill those needs, then i'll try to do a figure drawing class perhapsy-pants. indubitably so!

ight bedtime, i'm attaching the haiti shizz for anyone that gives a shit. booya grandma."

i have to call MVA tomorrow to get the exact details of what all I need to bring to get my MD plates. I think I have to get the car inspected first, but I want to make sure I bring the right papers for the inspection. Le sigh. This AM i called many times but the lines were busy. we hates it. 

tomorrow i have a press check for Marines Q2, again, since the first round of blueline edits were insane. Darryl and I are going. OFcourse,  i decided to walk home today, and as i got halfway home i realized, fucking fuckheads, I have to be at work at 9:15 ish so I can then walk to the metro and arrive at GPO on time. This isn't that bad, but, I have been rolling into work at 10am the past couple of days, and not having a car on me will mean i have to get up that much earlier to walk. whoops. it's ok though. i'm a vageen. 

I'm looking at what's crack-a-lackin at the national gallery at the moment. There's some German master drawings, whatever that means, which would probably be cool but I don't know if Mike is into that stuff. He strikes me as more of a modern art/sculpture type of dude. Perhaps we can go to Hirshhorn. I would love to go to the Hillwood, but that's also more classical art, not so much Contemporary. And we could hit up the National Arboretum to see the bonzai trees. There's also the H Street Festival. I could do an outdoor festival of sorts. Yessiree.

Today I had a tedious workout, mainly because i'm still sore as fuck from stupid fucking sunday. I got through it, but, i skipped out on some cardio because all the machines were taken, and i started this burpee/jump rope shit but it was a bit much for my sore butt. 

tomorrow i'm going to the Moishe House Sukkah decoration/open mic night. It's also Uri's birthday apparently. So that will be jolly good, maybe i'll meet some nice Jewish people, i've been feeling very ""bad jew"" lately so perhaps Sukkah decorating will change that. I'm also curious to chat with Uri about his recent travels to Israel and Cape Cod. 

Barbara is just non-stop fretting about med school apps. I'm kind of sick of hearing about it. It's her third time applying, and she keeps getting rejected or wait listed. Her scores are good, and she's in this bangin fellowship, so I don't see what the problem is, but she keeps saying ohhh i could do a Ph.D in Europe, blah blah, Europe is so much closer to Lebanon, but my family is in Texas, but I don't want to go to Texas, and I refuse to stoop down to the Caribbean med schools, etc etc. Like, ok, honestly, if it's your THIRD go around and you can't get in anywhere, maybe medicine isn't for you. Just throwing it out there. I mean she said it herself. I really do think she'll get in somewhere this application round because she does have the Hopkins NIH fellowship on her resume, and that's a biggie. But...just hearing about, ""oh i could go to Paris, but I don't want to take GRE's,"" is really starting to annoy me because it almost sounds like she has this self entitlement going on, where she DESERVES to go to a good medical school, or she absolutely MUST go to Europe for Ph.D. because America is just soooo blah. I know i'm embellishing, but today she had her Lebanese friend over for dinner, this guy who is a Hematologist/Oncologist and hopelessly in love with her and it's PATHETIC because she's basically told him off multiple times. Anyway, he was here and she was just throwing herself a pity party over dinner. Get over it. I ate my (delicious) food in silence and then prepared lunch and breakfast for tomorrow. STFU. Life is hard. You're in an all expenses paid Masters program at a top notch school right now. You have options for your future, and life does not stick to a neat little schedule, and if you have to delay medical school or admit defeat and do scientific research instead, SO BE IT. Whatevs. Ok end of rant. 

I am so glad I chose graphic design as a career field for myself. I could not imagine doing anything else day in and day out, and feeling satisfied and challenged.

I want to visit Justin in Salt Lake City. I should probs wait for a three day weekend for that shiz. The flight is sort of long. I have horrible geography people. I have no clue where Utah is on a map, for realsies. I'm one of those Texas, Florida, California, Maine people. All other states...I have no idea. 

I'm finally getting my sexy time skirt fixed at the Korean jawn next door to work. I really hope they can fix it!! It's part of my freakum dress outfit. It's not a dress really but it looks like one when I put it all together. BOOYA. I'd like to wear it this weekend if Mike and I go out, but if Koreans can't fix it...NO ONE CAN. And I will cry.

Mimi always feeds us her Korean food leftovers. Today I was working and I hear a ""psst"" behind me. I turn around and it's Mimi holding a forkful of fishcake/tofu with sprouts. She stuffs the fork in my mouth and goes back to her seat. Hilarious. And later she had more leftovers of that same concoction, so she passed it on to me and I picked out the tofu, and then I passed it back to her so she could give it to Robby to polish off the rest of the rice. Hilarious. We are wayyyy too comfortable with one another at work sometimes. 

I'm getting that travel itch, big time. Overseas travel. Big boy pants travel. I said I wanted to go to SLC and Robby was like, ""is there some Lord of the Rings trails there or something?"" hahahaha good one. what did the five fingers say to the face? SLAP. 

i should go to bed, immediately. mmmkay. gnite!"

i was in allentown this weekend, picked up my  mom's car, hooray! i have to get it inspected in MD and then go to the MVA for my MD plates. FAbulous. It's so nice to have a car antenna and not have to listen to Cat Country 103.7 ALLL COUNTRYYY ALLL DAY LONGGG YEEEE HAWWW station for 75% of the ride home. Glorious. 

I need to renew my passport and get a haircut. And find a doc to schedule a physical. Hollerville, if I do say so myself. 

On friday i got home and was le tired, so i showered and beasted with some old head russians who were over for tea. saturday we did the car title thing at AAA, and then went hiking at Bake Oven Knob with Noam's parents and Prince the poochie pie. It was really nice out. REALLY nice out. And then...what else did we do. Had some dinner, I popped a percocet and fell asleep for a couple of hours, then we tried to watch a movie but it sucked so we hit the hay. 

sunday AM we had a family outting to the JCC gym, tee hee. I did this bodyrock workout where you do 15 rounds of the following: 30 side jump lunges, three walking planks, three pushups alternating with squat thrusts. Holy shit, it was fucking hard and I totally was not expecting it to be that hard. I seriously need to kick it up a notch with the conditioning. I have been slacking too much and drinking too much. Anyway, that was brutal, and then I did some single leg squats, where I noticed how much weaker my left leg is than my right, and some med ball shit, squats, diagonal chops, jack knives, assisted pull ups, a little of this and a little of that. Good workout and I'm sore already so tomorrow will have to be an upper body focused day, but from the shit I have prepared, it seems to be lower-body heavy so I'll have to adjust as I go. Also, I saw some videos for how to do a pistol squat, which is hard as balls, but the vids were really helpful, so I'm going to be trying to practice those a bit more. hooray. i think my dream of doing a pull up is officially over because i decided scale back on the upper body lifts, for the sake of aesthetics. le sigh. 

umm ummmmm UMMM what else. mike kayton from san fran is visiting this upcoming weekend, should be fun. i hope it's not awkward. i'm not sure if barbara's male friend will be sleeping on the futon. I believe he is. If so..i guess mike and i are sharing a bed? unless KP goes to NC for the weekend or NYC as the case may be,then I can stay in her bed. I mean, I've hooked up with mike before, and he's sort of a ""might as well"" in my book, but i really have ups and downs with him on the attractiveness front, and i don't think he in any way assumes he'll be sleeping in my bed, so i guess the point is...there is no point of this really, we will play it by ear and not worry about it. but i'm kinda horny. well, i'm always ""kinda horny."" actually, i am really horny for some reason, i need a freaking boyfriend so i can get laid steadily. keeps me centered. for realsies. when i get laid on the regular, i get better sleep, i'm in better shape, and i'm more chilled out.

if you want a good laugh, listen to a radio morning show on any Spanish station. I crack up, even though I have no idea what's going on 95% of the time. 

my mom gave me some delicious, home grown peppers, tomatoes, dill, parsley and basil. HELLZ YEAH. i need to figure out what to cook for the week. i'm feeling frisky. wow did i just say that? i have some salmon that's defrosted that i'll bake tomorrow, and then...i gotta figure out what to do. my mom makes these russian cottage cheese mini pancakes (for lack of better term), where she takes a tub of ricotta, one egg, two tbsps of sugar, some raisins, and some flower, mixes it up, lightly fries it, and it's sooo good and simple and delicious. She didn't add any raisins this time and it was still delish. You can put sour cream and sugar on top, or some jam, or NUTELLA, or just eat it plain. mmmmmmmmmm. molest fest. 

my goal is to hike every weekend in fall. this weekend i think i can get mike to agree to do the billy goat trail in great falls, or just walk the lengthy walk that's over there, though i suspect he'll enjoy BGT. It would be nice for me to experience a different trail though, to be honest. Maybe we can do some Georgetown biking trail shizzles on the potomac. i am dying to do that. 

i can't wait to see seymour chwast speak! i am stoked. 

i want to set a for realsies deadline for the haiti poster. i'm pissing myself off. seriously marina, wtf. get ur shit together. 

i think that is all for now! winery plans are pushed to two weekends from now since mike is visiting next weekend. but tis all good. fartstains."

i'm watching MTV True Life: I'm a Newlywed, and there's a couple that hadn't even kissed on the lips before marriage. IT'S FREAKING ME OUT. Like hardcore, seriously, wtf?? freakishness. they seem well adjusted now though. 

balls all OVA. 

i got a raise!! i had my two year review and it went quite well. we shall see what happens next. i said i was ready for some more leadership roles and responsibilities. tomorrow I have a press check at GPO and Katie is coming with me. i also have a buttload of features to design for SMI magazine, and I want to do some pimpin typographic things. push the envelope. Indeed! I am also going to see Seymour Chwast speak at the Corcoran on Sept 22. Also, Cirque du Soleil is coming to DC. I want to try and hit that up. 

I gotta figure out when to get my car from Allentown. I could go this weekend but i'm fucking TIRED from chicago and i want to lounge and clean my room and sketch and enjoy the last of the DC summer. HOWEVER, this weekend is kind of key because the following weekend, I think noam's friend Mike from SF is visiting DC aka crashing at my place, and I will be playing tour guide. Which will be fun, mike is a really smart and interesting guy and i'm sure we'll have a blast, BUT, i obviously can't go home then. BEfore i get my car, i have to call the MVA and the PA DMV and make sure I have all my documents ready for title transfers and legal shizzles. SIGH. Tomorrow is already wednesday, eek. Mad shit to do folks. 

I gotta set up some kind of like, schedule, for shit I want to do, because fall is pimpin and I don't want to miss out on weekend opportunities. I guess mainly I should decide the weekend car pick-up. It's either this weekend, OR, the weekend of the 24-26. I think that may be a better idea because then I can plan to leave a little early on friday and get some hours in. i shall discuss with the parentals. Peeska-town all around. 

Ok so lets say in theory i go sept 24-26. That means this weekend is open. Which means I should definitely go hiking or do a VA winery. ok and i just asked arthur to go saturday and he is down. coolio. barbara's parents are in this weekend so i'd like to kind of stay away since i know her dad knows i had nekked times with her bro, and it might be awkward. i mean, not really, but...lets just not complicate the situation any further. ahhahhahaa. 

saturday night is sasha's bday thingy, i believe it's a josephine's. I really dont want to get crunk. we'll see how that goes....hahaha. farts. tomorrow i must get in a pimptastic workout. i was beering it up all weekend in chi-town, though i did manage squeeze in a workout at laura's super nice gym with a shitload of kettlebells, some foam rollers, even box jump platforms. Gawddd i wish my gym had those. I'd be a flying squirrel. 

today i got a new ipod and i gave josh a ride to apple store and he was SO AWKWARD and then he was all, ""i get really nervous around you because i really like youuuuuu"" (and i was instantly transported to my fourth grade desk at the Jewish Day School in Mrs. Knapp's class making a dinosaur diorama and watching someone's homemade vinegar and baking soda volcano explode at the science fair in the gymnasium/theater/cafeteria). Anyway, i gave a bitchtastic remark which went a little something like this: i don't like you as more than a friend, and i never will. if you can't handle that, we can't be friends, PERIOD. I basically kicked him out of my car. SEE YA, call me when you grow some balls. i'm practically a dude with tits, so ya ain't gonna get no sympathy from me about your schoolgirl crush. 

i guess i should review Chicago briefly. Ezugoo was randomly at O'hare when i landed so we got on the metro together and went into town. His buddy wasn't pickin up his phone, so me, zoogs and laura all went to a diner together. tee hee. how random. i was like, HI LAURA, this is my random nigerian friend CHUCKWEYZAGOO (seriously, that's his name, and he lived in london for a while so he has a nigerian-british accent!), and he will be beastin with us for an indefinite period of time till his friend answers his goddam phone. fortunately, all three of us are go-with-the-flow randos, so we had a lovely meal and peeska'd around. that nite laura and i went draaaankin at this cool bar with an upstairs dance floor. we chatted up with some dudes from the area and one was from LA. i honestly am way too nice to the ugly guy in groups of guys. you know, the weaker link that obviously never talks to anyone other than his World of WarCraft avatar? Yeah, i end up being uber nice to that dude, his hot friends are like ""WHOAA dude is finally talkin to a chick"" so then they refuse to talk to me, and everyone loses. sigh. 

saturday we went to millennium park and beasted, saw the Bean, saw some outdoor music picnic shit, went to the Art Institute, ate deep dish, walked around, went home, lazed. That night we went to a sports bar and I met one of Laura's friends and coworkers. Mad hot guys up in chicago, swarming around the sports bars. high five! the next day we slept in, then went for a walk with poochies, then gym, then we took a boat tour of the skyscrapers, then we went to Dos Diablos and had awful food service so we got drunk instead. Then we went bar hopping and met a hot aussie traveler, incessantly yelled THROW ANOTHER SHRIMP ON THE BARRRBIEEE at him, insulted australia in every way possible, drank excessively, made out with him (both of us did, high five), i drank half of a random person's beer because i was CONVINCED it was laura's leftovers even though she repeatedly explained it wasn't hers, etc etc. Finally, i got vom drunk, which was a good thing because i was very close to suggesting a drunken 3some with random australian whose hotel was conveniently around the corner. That last yaeger shot saved the day, and by save i mean, made me puke, which i diligently held in until we arrived in laura's apartment. And then I promptly went to bed. I am getting so good at this excessive drinking thing! 

the next day, we battled our beastly hangovers by going to the zoo. we dragged our hungover butts around. OH WAIT, first we went to a jewish deli for breakfast. i had a bagel with chive cream cheese and smoked salmon, and i felt like a good jew for the first time in a long time. i also saw a matzah ball the size of a baby's head. a FAT baby! hahahah

blah blah, zoo, alpacas, apes, lions, tigers, no bears, le sigh. good times had by all. the flight was only 1.5 hours on the return trip. booyakasha. 

i need to set some financial goals. now that i have a raise, i want to save a little better, invest a little better, and i'm going to send laura my Franklin Templeton IRA info so she can take a look at the investment breakdown cuz i'm a TARD of epic proportions when it comes to that. 

there's a high chance me and K.Peeska are going to TURKEY in the spring. YES YES YES. hava nagila. i am stoked."

my mom got a new car so her old one is set for my pick-up, which i will hopefully do the weekend after Labor Day weekend, or possibly the weekend after that. We shall see. Exciting! 

Haiti poster, blah blah, i'm slow as fuck. i did clean up my coroflot page a bit, but further work is required. bagaikers.

i'm so excited for chicago on friday!!! fuck yeah son!!! i can't wait. i need to pack tomorrow and look up shit that i'm interested in doing. mainly, the art museum. 

Sept 22 Seymour fucking Chwast is going to be speaking at the Corcoran. I am going. ACTUALLY i should buy tix asap. yayyy for design legends. 

i'm uploading a current sketch for the haiti poster so i can get any feedback from any design peoples that may have something constructive. i have to refine the type to get it more readable, and the flourishes/plants are going to overlap the lifesaver thing, and all will be drawn in the same pen so the line thicknesses will be consistent. yessiree. 

the past few days i had crappy workouts because i was sickly from the cali tortilla fish taco fiasco. I realize i think i'm kinda falling out of shape a bit, i hadn't worked out in three days over the weekend, and prior to that i feel like i was all over the place with inconsistency, esp since i was in a-town, though i managed to get some quality workouts in then. who knows. also, two days of drinking and partying = BAD. so that should probably not happen again for a while. i'm bringing my gym stuff to chicago since laura is a gymrat these days as well, (though she best not drag me for a run. that only guarantees unpleasantries for ALL, even surrounding strangers) 

i need to find a new family doctor. UGHHHHHHHHH. we hates it. 

tomorrow i will be uber productive at work cuz...i'm out friday. BUH BYE NOW. 
I NEED a new workout bra. currently i layer on two weird ones, one of which has FOUR bra hooks, the second one has a respectable two. I am seriously freaked out and perplexed by bras with only one hook. What kind of 7th grade A-cup bullshit is that?? (no offense to the A-cups of the world, shake what yo mama gave ya!) If anyone has GOOD sports bra recommendations, do tell. If you're wondering quite how good a sports bra I require, imagine two cantaloupe-sized balloons full of thick pudding strapped to your chest while doing 100 jumping jacks. Now imagine the quality bra that needs to cradle those suckers to prevent facial injury and explosions/leakage. THERE YA GO. 

We had cake at work today and you know what? I really fucking love icing. REALLY. I do. And you know what else? I miss late night design work-festivals. Now that I have $$ saved up, I am going to take some drawing classes (though those are generally uber cheap, the open drawing sessions I should say), and I will buy a nice newsprint pad and a chipboard clippy thingy, and yayyy it will be grand! GRAND I say. I kind of wish I had a designer roommate so we could have work days and immerse ourselves in art projects. Le sigh. that would be the life, wouldn't it?

I also watched Master Chef and now I crave a filet mignon. Or a boyfriend that will cook me said filet mignon. One of the guys is super sexayyy and keeps talkin about his g/f and how much he looooves to cook for her (ima shank this bitch). Another hot one is named Sharone (pronounced, Shah-rone), which i strongly suspect is Jewish, and his last name is Hakman. Cook me some falafel, biznizzle. Or sausage. With meatballs. Get it???? Pervs.

Kpeeska and I want to go to a winery in VA. We ought to set a date because these things tend to slip through the cracks of time and disappear forever! farts. 

i really look forward to eating breakfast at the airport for some reason. it's just oh so fun to get a coffee and something delicious and chillax in a little eatery with a book or a sketch book, or perhaps write a travel entry in your travel journal (as i tend to do). hooray hooray. also i cleaned out my nightstand drawers and found a female condom. Those things are weird. Ok time to stalk around tmuscle.com, my newest guilty pleasure, and thennnnn hit the hay. gnite

"event","Last nite my stomach was going CRAZY from these fish tacos (haha) i ate at California Tortilla. They were DELICIOUS, but apparently blew through my intestines like Hurrican Katrina. I got very little sleep, compounded by a weekend of drinking, partying, and early rising on both friday and saturday, with all-day car shopping on Sunday, so I took a sick day. Also, I got my period early because i accidentally skipped one too many days of the pill, and I was a festival of cramps and bloating, and incessant hunger. GLORIOUS! I did manage to sketch some new typographic solutions for the Haiti poster, and I am one step closer to completing this little ""mini-project"" aka drawn-out, self-imposed design obligation. Hahaha. I also scheduled my dentist and gyn appts, straightened out the colonoscopy billing, and updated my domain name/hosting cancellation. High five!

Let's do a quick recap of the weekend festivities. Friday we went to Current and got wastey. Although my pimp cane was in retirement, I was mackin it with an Israeli guy, a black dude, and an Afghan fellow in the VIP section of Midtown, which is really just a couch and table with a red rope set up in front of it, so let's not get too excited. I did feel the need to immediately tell him that I was Jewish, since he was in the company of maybe....TEN other Afghan men. I don't think they minded because they promptly gave me a shot of Grey Goose, which one kind gentleman poured directly into my mouth from the bottle. Ah, Middle Eastern hospitality. Blends quite well with Russian alcoholism. Indeed! A fun time was had by all. 

Saturday I got up earlier than my hangover would have liked, walked to work to get my car (with a pit stop at Einstein bagel, HIGH FIVE), and went to the Bethesda Apple store (which has the best customer service of any place in the WORLD), and then I drove to Alexandria to beast with Tom and Joanna while Tom helped me look up used cars. Then I we went to lunch, on me, to this delightful Cuban place where they recommended Ropa Vieja wrapped in plantains, with a drizzle of cheese sauce on top, some field greens with a mango-pineapple sauce and some other insanely delicious additions to it, oh man oh man. SO good. Saturday night was Mark's going away outting and K.Peeska's bday celebration. We beasted at One Lounge and it was fun, I kept it light with the drinking, but was beatdown tired Sunday regardless because I had to get up at 8:30 and pick up Tom in VA and drive to MD to look at cars. After a day of car shopping, my mom called to say her friend Vladimir convinced her to give me her old car (which is beautiful and in great condition). BOOM. Today she bought a car with this Mr. Vladimir, who is an apparent car pro. 

I'm going to Chicago on Friday!! FUCK YEAH SON. 
The Israeli guy from the club is apparently an Italian chef. Interesting. Mama mia! 
Dan and I were discussing Israeli wine (i also am reading 'The Wine Bible' which is all about WINE ofcourse, and making me crave a nice glass), and he informed me that Georgetown sells some Israeli wines, so I think we should gather some people to go buy some and drink by the waterfront and then get falafel! L'hayim! 

Ight, bedtime for me, hopefully my stomach is all better tomorrow and I can go to the gym because I have slacked off for three days now. BAd marina, bad. Also josh didnt' barf last time but nearly shit himself and had to run to the bathroom. COOL."

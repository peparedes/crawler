"event","well today started out pretty well.

i woke up early. 
i had a huge fucking breakfast.
got new icon pics.
days going great. pre-cal ok. i read alot of my book.
had some fun during current problems today 'filming' our movie thing.
but for some reason the whole entire time I was in that class I felt horrible.
my forehead was cold and clammy, I was sweating profusely, my stomach was churning, and my arms were really really fatigued, i thought that it couldnt mean that I am hungry because I had a big breakfast when I usually just wake up and not eat ANYTHING. well lunch came around and when I finally got some food in me I felt much better.
speaking of current problems there seems to be a new but old problem to just rise up kinda outta nowhere and start bitch slapping me. one of those problems you really don't know what to do about, how to react to it, how the problem will be or when it will be solved. if ever.

have a good day.
off to go fucking iron a football field banner. seriously."

i doubt it.......


11. I......did fairly well in the 7-on-7 football league I was in......
10. I got a job at Hardees..finally some income.
9. I had a car, i didnt have a car, I had car, I dont have a car....I finally have a car.
8. Kaysha and Chloe. nuff said.
7. I just may go to college after all.
6. The only part of my family that is still intact is still intact. We are stronger as a family even through our tough times with shit.
5. I've gotten closer to my mom, there was once a day, (just a year ago), that I thought I would never even speak to my mother at all. I'm soooo glad we have a relationship with each other.
4. Got the part of Aesop.....lol lol
3. Accomplished the role of Anthony Marston in Ten Little Indians.
2. Accomplished the assistant directing and (co-lead?) major role of Claudius, in Hamlet.
1. and the only person to get me through it all. Jeff. I've learned more about myself, Jeff, and the way life just has to be, because of Jeff. more than I couldve done alone.

and I have a question. why didnt anyone answer my questions that I posted earlier? hmm? i guess this is really silly to post a question and expect an answer concerning the questions i posted that did not get answered in the first place. does anyone read this? i could just ramble on about cactus fucking or broken table legs or the Popes' anal leakage and no one would know.....at all.

you, as a person, do not matter. you suck. at everything. especially donkey dicks.
my nose is kinda stuffy for some reason. does anyone else besides me sit down when showering and try to zoom to the other side of the tub as fast as you can?....oh ok...me neither.......
do crackers make you crackers? I ate some earlier before I showered. maybe this explains the weird post. and the blue spots of light that keep randomly popping up before me. oh, and you was adopted. I am dead fucking serious. no one really loves you. or ever will.

We had been discussing going to go see King Kong but I think that Narnia movie would be pretty cool, I've heard it is. but I don't care.

they all watched Garden State, I was freakin tired. I still don't know what that movie was about.
I finally went back to my aunt and uncle's barn....so Jeff could stay forever. until 3:45 actually.
So I took an hour nap, left at 5 for the airport, and slept on the way there.
My flight left at 7:30-ish. 
I love flying. It's amazing how small things become, very very quickly.
Flying above three layers of clouds is an experience everyone must have.

I totally bombed a pre-cal test. I didnt even try.
Josh, Josh, Chris and I filmed our ......'World Hunger' video for current problems
we went out to the nature center to film without even asking, idk if that's bad, but who cares.
the video is freaking hilarious. I love it.
Latin was real fun....i guess, we just stood around (well, I did) and ppl wrapped presents for the families. 
Practice was real productive. Nothing bad was said about what I did, she actually *gasp* said she liked my characterization......whoa..yea 
Kaysha and I talked for awhile about....everything. That was even more productive than practice.
Finally Jeff and I made it to Muncie to shop for our friends. Best Buy and Walmart.
wow.....money just doesnt like me..it never visits me and when it does it immediately has to leave.

we probably almost died a total of 9 times on the way through Muncie and 'out' of Muncie.
I let Jeff drive so he could fuckin find a damned school. We almost ended up in 3 different towns other than Muncie. I have a natural gift as a navigator. but does Jeff ever listen to me? hell no.

well i got out of the test and sat down with the guy to see how i did....
he was very solemn, asked me how i thought i had done....explained that i needed a score of 13 to pass. and that 40% of everybody who takes it <b>fails</b>. its a <u>very hard test</u>. believe me. every question progressively gets harder........

Graduation is scary and should never have been invented. 
A ravaging horde of pilaging raping clawing snarling Sasquatch (properly known as Sasquae), have morphed and disguised themselves into an idea or rather, an event. using the very same methods politicians use for the idea or event of an 'election'. except the Sasquae actually physically rape you in the end (if you know what I am saying). instead of the politicians raping you verbally, in the end.....of an election. 
ANYWAYS...these Sasquae (pronounced Sas-kwy) have transformed themselves into an internationally known event..........Graduation. It is as scary as fuck. 
because it throws you out into the real world. 
which is commissioned, paid for, and ran by......Richard Simmons."

"event","This will be my last post for a long time. I might reply to some of your posts but I will not provide any inkling of an insight to my mind. All I do is almost nearly or completely fuck things up with my posts. Until I have an amazing and miraculous change of heart and mind I will not say a thing. 

The thing is.........the problem is...I care for too many people. Alot of people. My caring has probably confused everyone because I say alot of things about how I am feeling. I feel alot of things about alot of people. Its right then that I get stuck in a great big jam. I get torn into a thousand different directions. I choose one and *BAM* everything vanishes from reach. I am yet again standing alone, cold, in the dark, tears streaming, lost. 

I just want someone to have tremendous fun with. Listen. Talk. Hold. Laugh. 
I need someone to need me.
I need someone to be needed.

It may be alot to ask.... but is it really??.....
It seems to work for everyone else.

and I am happy for all of you...
just let me think for awhile....
and say 'Hi' to the kid sitting on the sidelines. He's pretty friendly."

Up and down, love 
I push up love, love everyday 
Jump in the mud, oh 
Get your hands dirty with 
Love it up on everyday 
All you need is 
What you want is 
All you need is love. 

What I want is what I've not got 
And what I need Is all around me 
Reaching searching never stop 

Take these chances 
Place them in a box 
until a quieter time 
Lights down, you up and die 

Only waiting I wanted to stay
I wanted to play
I wanted to love you
I'm only this far
And only tomorrow leads my way
why wont you run
in the rain and play
let the tears splash all over you

eat, drink and be merry 
for tomorrow we die

this isnt a real song, but if it was the 
meaning is quite plain and clear 
<b>live life everyday, take chances
one life to live, make the most of everything you can</b> 
whether that means telling someone 
<i>you like them, or love them</i> 
because if you dont then you wont ever 
know what coulda been and besides, 
<u>you may never see them again.</u> <b>what harm is love?</b>
all of our famous world leaders and 
spiritual guides want the world to love. 
the world is <b>bitter and spiteful</b>. 
yet we admired people that told us to love 
<i>""Yes, yes, let's love.""</i> but rarely do we. 
Hypocrites make the world worse and worse.

You are attracted to those who are unbridled, untrammeled, and free.

In love, you feel the most alive when your lover is creative and never lets you feel bored.

You'd like to your lover to think you are loyal and faithful... that you'll never change.

You would be forced to break up with someone who was insecure and in constant need of reassurance.

Your ideal relationship is lasting. You want a relationship that looks to the future... one you can grow with.

Your risk of cheating is zero. You care about society and morality. You would never break a commitment.

You think of marriage as something precious. You'll treasure marriage and treat it as sacred.

In this moment, you think of love as commitment. Love only works when both people are totally devoted.</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/keystoyourheartquiz/"">What Are The Keys To Your Heart?</a></div>"

<P><FONT color=#009900>they were <FONT size=5>wrong</FONT>. at least that isn't the case for me. </FONT></P>
<P>high school has not been <U><FONT size=6><FONT color=#ff0000>one single smidgeon of an ounce</FONT></FONT></U> of fun for me. sure, theres been some <U><FONT color=#ff0000 size=4>interestingexhilaratingwildfun</FONT></U> times. but,... oh,... I'll just guess...there's only been about <FONT color=#ff0000 size=4>four</FONT> of those. i do not know exactly <STRONG>what</STRONG> i did those times, <STRONG>who</STRONG> i was with or <STRONG>why</STRONG> i was doing <EM>whatever</EM> it was i was <EM>doing</EM>. but i'm <EM>sure</EM> there have been at least <FONT size=4>four</FONT> really cool things to happen to me so far that i will always remember and look back on saying, ""I wouldnt change that for the world"". I just can't remember them right now. thats how <FONT size=4>memorable </FONT>my life has been <EM><FONT size=4>so far</FONT></EM>.</P>
<P>Heck, i remember <EM><FONT size=4>alot of things</FONT></EM>, but were they the <U>greatest</U> days of my life? <FONT size=5>nope</FONT>. I look back on my years and ask myself <EM>what have they amounted to</EM>. I have <STRONG>failed</STRONG> myself this year so far in academics and I fucked around other years also. I am not a <FONT color=#3366ff>genius</FONT> or a <FONT color=#3366ff>sports phenomenon</FONT>. I'm not even that great of a guy. My future looks <FONT size=6>fucked</FONT> and very <FONT size=1>bleak</FONT> right now. I have only a <EM><STRONG>few</STRONG></EM> friends that i can count on to be there for me, which i can count on.... <U>one hand</U>. I have <FONT size=4>half</FONT> of a family to support me. One half of that family blames alot of things <FONT color=#ffcc33><EM><FONT color=#996633>on me</FONT></EM> </FONT>and totally hates me................... </P>
<P>...............I do not have <EM><FONT color=#cc6600>anybody</FONT></EM> to share these thoughts with privately. </P>
<P>No one to <FONT color=#ffcccc size=5>hold</FONT>. </P>
<P>No one to<FONT color=#ffcccc size=6> <FONT size=5>hug</FONT></FONT>. </P>
<P>No one to <FONT color=#ffcccc size=5>Kiss</FONT>. </P>
<P>No one has <EM><FONT size=5>ever</FONT></EM> fallen asleep in my arms (and been <FONT color=#6666cc>happy </FONT>about it, lol) I have to use <FONT size=2>weak</FONT> and sometimes even <FONT size=1>ill-timed</FONT> humor to <FONT color=#00cccc size=4>brighten</FONT> things up. </P>
<P>Have i ever made anyone feel <FONT color=#3333ff size=4>safe</FONT>, <FONT color=#cc66cc size=4>happy</FONT>, <FONT color=#ff0000 size=4>excited</FONT>, or <FONT color=#ffcccc size=5>beautiful</FONT>? </P>
<P>If I died <U>tonigh</U>t....what would be my <STRONG>happiest moment</STRONG>? <STRONG>crowning achievement</STRONG>? <STRONG>funniest joke</STRONG>? anything, what has my life <EM>accounted</EM> for. who would.. <FONT color=#006600>truly care</FONT>?<FONT color=#666600> cry</FONT>?<FONT color=#006600> ever be the same</FONT>?....<FONT size=4>miss me</FONT>? </P>
<P>I am going <EM><FONT size=4>crazy</FONT></EM>. I am still ""everyones friend"" as i posted earlier. I am still <U>happy-go-lucky Haas</U>. but I am s.l.o.w.l.y slipping away from <STRONG>sanity</STRONG>. I need someone to<STRONG> look forward</STRONG> to seeing...... just as i need to know that she <EM><FONT size=4>looks forward to seeing me</FONT></EM>. </P>"

I'm slowly, but surely becoming disenchanted with network TV.  This is not to say I am going to go the way of MJP and cancel my satellite TV or anything, but for those times when I have nothing to watch and feel like watching something of substance (as opposed to food tv) or I'm at MJP's land of no subscription TV, I want to have a list of things to check out.

So, help me out, peeps!  Ready.....go!"

So, since my schedule keeps getting f-ed up, I can't really go until Thursday night to drop it off, which means not back until Friday and hang up stuff still wet until at least Saturday.

So, today I am wearing a dress.  I don't know why I don't wear my dresses to work more often.  Compliments are abounding and I feel dressy (as opposed to sloppy in the same pants/tee rotation). 

And, since I will not have anything to wear that is not presently in my closet until Monday, tomorrow I am wearing pants or a skirt with my last white tee, Thursday I am wearing my brown dress and Friday I am wearing my dress jeans (as I do every Friday) with a tank and short sleeve tie-cardigan.  

Sweet!  Maybe this will help me get these things into the regular rotation to snazz it up a bit without spending money."

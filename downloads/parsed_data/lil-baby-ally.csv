the cool fing about today was the amazing raing, it was soo cool.
also exciting prospects are the holiday and scaring ppl in halloween costumes on planes! , and the shop. 
im totally freaked out bout exam results (sorry for mentioning them) and my a levels cuz iv not a clue what im taking.
the other day i met up wiv mal and moph and danny and katie in town, it was fun, apperently moph looks like an old lady, and i hadnt seen mal in a long time really. we went to the country club and katie attempted to play pool but we still beat moph :P"

"event","hello! well the holidays so far are quite kick ass actually, the only fing really annoying me is the whole exam result thing. but its fine, only 3 weeks today though! 
anyway so far, iv been on holiday, had ma birthday, met up with different variations of the e-crew nearly every day which is really ace, and tomorow im going to scarbrough, which is quite crappy, but i get to go to the sealife centre! yay!
today me n moph went into town planning on meeting other erm ppl, but the lounge was closed so we resorted to the ltcc, which wasnt bad except moph broke the pool table on our fisrt game because a yellow ball and the cue ball went misisng, so a man had to help us. then the three more games we had went way too slow, and we kept making the crappest shots which involved the cue ball jumping but not over anything, which ended up knocking itself into the pocket, on several occasions.
tonight, me, moph and bethan went on a bike ride to the splash and met wiv chris for like 2 mins, then biked back home. moph had to be home at nine, but podge found us biking up grimsby road at 9.30 cuz we kinda lost track of time. cars kept honking at us cuz we didnt have any lights it was wierd.

wills having a camp bbq tonyt which is quite ace for him, cuz its like a re-union lol. 
also, mophs having a phone fiasco, not knowing what to get, i have a personal favourate, but i fink it might be too girly for her. lmao. 
waht happened to PONTINS? we were supposed to be going but it never happened.

i cant wait for my mum and podge to go to prague, cuz then moph can come stay with me in good old binbrook and we can walk the doggies, and get the train to lincoln. it would be cool to go out in lincoln, but were not 18 so never mind, unless we decided to make our selves fake i.d's which would be a completely pathetic thing to do, especially considering moph dosnt even drink, or isnt SUPPOSED to.

cant wait till thursday! CLUB HOUSE, rofl. 
saw the most amazing things in the early learning centre today was contemplating buying one of the things we saw for mal, but then we got distracted by other things like giant pink blow up structures! however there are no jellyfish on the earth! dammit.

well im at my dads at the minute., helping him move house. well actually im just sitting here watching. 
tomorrow im going on holiday and im very excited :D well im actually going on monday but im driving down to london tomrrow because we have an early flight on monday.
the hot- ness has been really cool, but the rain yesterday was shocking, but never fear! me and moph are getting out of the country very soon!
it's quite wierd that it's nearly my birthdaym it doesnt feel like it, because i'm probably not going to see anyone because mophs on holiday, the people i do want to see don't get on with some of my other friends, and basically people have better things to do, than go ""ooh its alices birthday today, lets go see her!"" so im going to go out for a meal with my mum and podge and grandma, SCORE!
i hope everyone has a cool prom, and that it's not too crap. and that everyone gets their books returned nice and safely, and that everyone has fun induction days.
can't believe i'm not going to find out what form im in! i bet it'l be tremendously crap and i wont know anyone. 
its the dancing show soon! not sure how thats going to come together, i dont have any costumes and i need them now, and im going to be missing next weeks dancing, so i wont know half the dances either :/
i'l get wayne to learn them for me and ask him to show me them. 
well lately all i've been doing is revision and exams, and now just get to dread the results, but i think i did okay. afetr the exams i've been mooching around town or paddeling in the hubbards hills river all the according to moph, little kids tinkle in it :/ ahh well. 
i'm gong to go and watch tv now, not that anythings on. oh yeh and i cant belive big brother last night! eugh it was odd.

just had an argument with my mum and i feel bad, because it wasnt neccasary and was just about the past, im probably just stressed out.
school is very bad, boring,full of pressure and tension. in a way i can't wait till exam leave, but then the exams will be here lol, which isn't a pleasent thought, i really want to pass them all. 
oh yeah also i was in a car crash at the beggining of the week which was quite scary and shocking but i lived, my mum got whip lash though. 
i hope the exam period goes very fast, im told that it does, becuase as soon as they are over im off to the one and only country that just makes me feel un believably warm inside, might see ken again.

It appears my account has gotten suspended. So just to inform you that I did -NOT- delete my journal, I'm posting this here just to make sure you guys aren't all completely worried. I'm e-mailing them right now to find out what the problm could be, so once I find out, I'll (hopefully) get my journal back and restored.

Got it? Good. Argh, this was a nice thing to wake up to.. x_x"

Tha' Jynna lass. She seems like a polite enough girl. She helps clean aroun' the house an' prepare food an' such, so she's been a great addition. Ah jus' hope Yari can get the serum back in tahme fer th' rest a' us, however.

Anywae... aside from all that, it's been too quiet lately. Even with Getzou, Tslener, Mitch, an' Getzou's girlfriend Jynna living with me now.

Ah have a feelin' Quil is behind this. She won't stop until all a' us are either possessed or -dead-.

I foun' oot more about tha' curse Getzou an' Ah have, too. S'called the <i>Naitomaro</i>, Ah believe... all Ah know aboot it... it spreads if a victim is scratched or bitten by one who was infected by th' witch, an' if the victim is an animal or a child, they'll die from it. They show symptoms as well. Their skin turns pale... their eyes turn a chalked colour... an' their hair gets discoloured into a monochrome shade. There's also markin's... markin's underneath each eye, an' they would end up becomin' so violent physically, they almost turn feral. Each curse is triggered by somethin' different... an' evereh tahme one is tah change, we slowleh forget aboot our true selves. 

This is bad... Ah have alla those symptoms, yet Quil nevar did anythin' tah meh. Unless she's waitin'... an' Ah'm gonnae be th' last one. 

Ah'm gonnae try tah find somethin' tah reverse this. Even if it kills meh."

~ ~ ~

((Alright, out of char entry for once. XD Need to post my character stats up here for an upcoming story I'm doing with two friends of mine. Basic information goes as follows:

Name: Nekku Sylreha (main char I'm using.) 
Age: 32
Race: Al Bhed 
Occupation/Job Class: Mechanic
Weapon: A double sided wrench.
Appearance: A tall man with long mahogany coloured hair tied back in a ponytail. He has crystal blue eyes (which are Al Bhed eyes), and a dark brown bushy beard extending along his jawlines and fully covering his chin. He's of a semi-muscular build, and wears a shirt that's a dull grey, with fishnetted sleeves. His fingerless gloves are completely fishnet, which extend up to above the elbow. His pants are black, made of sweatpants material, extending to the ground, with one slit on each side. His shoes are brown, and he wears three belts: one across his waist, and one buckled around each thigh.
Abilities: Strong physically, and quick to think. 

Name: Quito
Age: Around 150
Race: Qu
Occupation/Job Class: High Priest/Blue Mage
Weapon: Blue Magic and Water/Ice power.
Appearance: A fat, whitish monster (Qu) that lacks the long tongue and has many dreads coming off his head. Two come along his sides, and he clothes completely in a flowing red and gold robe. He wears a large hat atop his head matching the robe, except there's a round obsidian stone placed in the center. 
Abilities: Aside from the Blue Magic and the Water/Ice power, he's also quite intelligent. Yet, he's not very strong in a physical sense, so he has to rely on magic to help him through battles. However, he's very skilled in the religious arts.

Name: Mouzuma
Age: Approx. 2000 (He was frozen in time by use of cryogenics)
Race: Cockroach
Occupation/Job Class: None. (He was an experiment gone wrong.)
Weapon: Strong psychic powers; can destroy things by merely using thought.
Appearance: A very small creature, Mouzuma is a cockroach boy. He has four arms, a shell, wispy sky blue hair, and two long antennae sprouting from his head. He has two very large green-blue eyes, which somehow frighten whoever looks at them, and the antennae and eyes can glow when on command.
Abilities: By using his spiritual/psychic powers, he can use them through his antennae in a weird manner to channel the dead or to talk with any spirit or thing in soul, living or deceased.

Let's see. We have myself, Getzou, Juuki, Kikyo, and Kinsha. Three girls and two guys. This could get interestin'. (Of course, there's Yari, who's the child I'm guardin' now, but he's na' adult or old enough yet... but he's still as Al Bhed as our group of five.)

No trouble's shown up yet. Hopefully, it'll stay that way. Can actually work in peace for once. >_>;

::drapes the blanket on his body like a cape:: Maybe a nice, hot bath would do me well. The vapors would probably help my semi-stuffed up head. 

Ah well. I'll talk more later. Maybe I'll sleep a bit more."

"event","Looks like I won't be fightin' any monsters fer a bit. Seems my trip to Macalania just to gather some Ice Gems turned out for me to get a bad chest cold along with chills. Bah. 

::sneezes:: Anyway, I think I got the hang of this computer thin'. Though the technology is so old on this, I think I actually know how to work it. Hmm... ::selects another song:: Ooooh, this one's pretty. Humans can make such beautiful music, even without words. Must listen to more of this. Better than listening to that Hymn over and over. 

Well, Getzou did come around today. Luckily, we didn't get attacked by anything as of today and he somewhat tended to Yari for me. Don't want the child getting a sickness off me, too. >_o

If a monster ever does come aroun', though... I won't be able to fight it off anyway. The most I could do is probably sneeze or cough on it. 

...and I quote the Monty Python movie, except take out the bleeding part.

::sneezes violently:: ...aaaoooww. I think I'll be goin' to rest now. Gaw, so cold. -_- {)"

"event","Gah. It's cold out. ::shivers:: ...fishnet does not keep one warm. Oooohh... ::blows in hands:: Macalania's not a very good place to walk back from. Waist high in snow and Ice Flans all over th' place. Ugh. ::sneezes::

Been lonely here, too. Quiet as well, but with the child around, everything's quiet since he cannae talk. Been spending my time figuring out this human's computer. So unadvanced. ::searches around with the mouse and clicks on the keyboard::

Ah! So this thin' plays music, too. ...This Ayumi Hamasaki human is interesting... ::listens:: Bouncy.

Might as well wait until someone comes around. Or until it decides to warm up. I'm gonna be stuck with this chill fer a while. -_-;

Use <a href=""http://www.pixelscapes.com/twoflower/albhed.html"">this</a> to translate the strange language he uses. XD It's an Al Bhed translator.)"

It was about time I made an RP journal for myself. Now I can just randomly use it when I feel in an RP mood. XD Yaaaay. Anyway. Enough of me.)

Ay. Nekku 'ere. Finally got my hands on this thin'. How do you work it...? ::begins typing:: Ah, easy enough. ::cracks knuckles::

Well, today was rather boring. Didn't see Getzou around today. Kinna strange, actually. But I was probably gone too long to even know he came.

::slumps, putting his hand on his forehead:: Oh, dear. Overworked, yes. Had to fix more robots for the other Al Bhed. You think they'd have more interests than mechs... ::sigh::

Better be off. Looks like Yari's tryin' to wander off again. >_o"

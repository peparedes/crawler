I'll be going through old posts and locking them as I have time in the coming days, weeks, or whatever.  There's no efficient way to do that all at once, is there?  

Nothing in particular prompted this, but I've already been locking 80-90% of my entries, and I've decided that I'd be more comfortable if the whole thing were locked."

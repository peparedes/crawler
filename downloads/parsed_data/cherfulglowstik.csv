OMG My sweetie decided to slick his hair back today and mmmm yummy...I can't wait to get home and rip his clothes off...yes, I'm in a wierd mood today, don't ask.

Tomorrow is going to suck, at least until after he gets home...as long as things go the way I'm hoping they will in court for him tomorrow. I'll have to think something up to do to celebrate. Something fun and creative and that the three of us can enjoy together since Anya is going to be miserable until he gets out tomorrow.

I'm looking forward to this weekend. Past two weeks have been great. Went to the zoo again with the kids and hoping to have a repeat this sunday. Who knows, maybe we'll head over to see John's grandma too. I think Anya will like that. She gets a kick out of that sweet lady. :) Well, I'll let you know how things go. Love and miss you all!!!"

Structured and organized, you have a knack for thinking clearly.
You are very logical - and you don't let your thoughts get polluted with emotions.
And while your thoughts are pretty serious, they're anything from boring.
It's minds like yours that have built the great cities of the world!</font></td></tr></table><div align=""center""><a href=""http://www.blogthings.com/whatpatternisyourbrainquiz/"">What Pattern Is Your Brain?</a></div>"

"event","Who wants to come get high with me?  lol Seriously, this Paint is STRONG!  lol.  I've cut, sanded and sprayed the first coat oof paint onto the pieces for the hips.  For the first part of the costume, I think I did pretty good.  Yes, I'm taking pictures of the step-by-step process because it is another way to avoid having to do the next step.  I have to wait for this to dry anyway before I move on to the other side then the second coat and finally the next part of the costume.  *sighs* So much work, so much drying time.  So for now I'm just going to sit and chill.  Pics will be under a friends only posting so if you want to see them, make sure your on the list ya'll.  This includes pictures of the finished product once it's all together and ready but that will definately be in a later post."

"event","Where all my sexy chicas at?  lol I miss my girls.  Talked to Meeka last night.  Miss her much!  We gotta like go downtown soon or something and chill.  Make it a girls day out, ya know?  Leave Sam and Chris at home or at work and just chill.

Cari got stuck in the closet last night.  lol, she's back in there now.  If she gets stuck, I'm not getting her out.  I seriously need to put a new door on that closet.  If the cats fuck up my wedding dress Stitch will be having kitty stew for dinner.  lol jk

I'm in a good mood again today.  I like this new being happy thing.  I really think it has a lot to do with the RPG, you know, having a hobby now and something to keep my brain working.  Oh, and all the projects I can finally start on since it stopped raining.

Though I keep putting off doing them still.  I'm such a procrastinator.  I told myself I'd start my costume at ten, then it was eleven and now it's after lunch when I'll begin.  I gotta get the kitties out of the room and make sure they stay out while I'm doing it though.  Spraypaint is not good for them.  I'm not as worried about Stitch because I know she wont be all over the stuff while I'm working on it.  If it's not food, her interest in it goes away.  That's why dogs rule!

I will have to make sure ALL the animals are out of the room when I re-finish that writing desk though.  I think the fumes from the paint stripper will be too much for them.  I'll be picking up one of those masks at work with the filter things on it so I should be fine while doing it.  That, and I'll have the window open with the fan on like D suggested.

OMG A is so adorable.  I freakin love that little chica.  She's so cute.  It feels good to have female friends again.  T wants her and me to hook up.  He's been bugging us about it since he saw our little hug and kiss the other day.  *grins*  

Well, I'm gonna go eat, then I'll get to work.  Honest!  I will.  Don't look at me like that!  I promise I will start it after I eat.  *hugs and kisses all you sexy people*"

Learn anything?
That's right...
I make a lot of coding istakes.

Well, let me break it down for you:

You have a total of 21 friends
You requested to guess 21 entries.
4 were skipped due to invalid content (surprising?).
You made 18 guesses.
You got 17 correct.
Doing the math for you, that means you got 94% correct

I think I may have eaten something that did not agree with me because I felt like I was going to throw up all over the inside of the car.  Thankfully I did not.  Instead I started throwing up at work.  Needless to say I had to go home and it really sucks because I just started there.  I talked to Nancy though and she told me to just come in tomorrow night to cover what I missed since it is just training.  

I'm still feeling sick, but I haven't thrown up again yet.  *knock on wood*  Here's hoping I don't.  Not sure what's wrong with me this time.  Could have been that I didn't eat much this morning and didn't get much sleep last night.  I don't know.  Guess I'll just have to wait and see what is going on with me.  Might be a bit of a stomach virus but no one I know is sick...so I couldn't have caught it from any of them.  This sucks.  I hate being sick.  I'll be okay though.  I'm going to go try to take a nap and hope it will help me a little."

If I wind up not liking the paint department I might just switch lol.  Either way I'm happy I got to start today.  We did a lot too.  Watched a whole bunch of videos, filled out lots of paperwork.

To understand what is to follow you must read these two articles above.  I am outraged.  When is the government going to back off?  Honestly not all ravers are in it 'for the drugs'.  Many of my friends, as well as my husband and myself, are in it for the music.  We are sober ravers!  

People were attacked that night for just standing there.  I mean, was it really necessary for them to go in full SWAT gear and to wave their guns around, point them at people and beat innocent kids who are just trying to have fun and meet new friends??

Now earlier today I was screaming at the computer over this so I decided to wait until I calmed down before I posted anything.  Unfortunately that meant I forgot a lot of the things I was going to say so you'll probably be reading little bits here and there from me about it as the week goes on."

"event","HI EVERYONE!!!!

Yes I'm in a GREAT mood.  I'm getting better.  YAY!!!!!!!  I was actually able to go outside today and walk somewhere with Chris.  I may even do it again tomorrow.  And possibly by myself.  :)

Okay so the Social Anxiety thing is a bit harder to get through than I thought it would be but I'm trying and doing better than I thought I would be.  *sigh*  Of course it would be easier if I didn't get the 'You shouldn't go walking around this neighborhood by yourself speech' everyday from Mum.  (She's so freakin' paranoid!  Worse than me and I'm Skitzo!!!)  *giggles*  But ya'll already knew that.

So I'm happy to say I am also fighting off the urge to be anorexic again.  I was thinking about it a lot this week when I tried on my old bathing suit and had to say EWWWWW!  But I can lose the weight a healthier way.  The main thing that pushed me away from anorexia this time was my mother actually.  She looked at me today and said, 'Your gaining weight.  Stop drinking soda.'  Of course I had to look at her and laugh because she's pretty big and has trouble with her legs because of the weight.  I just smiled, shrugged and told her I'd lose the weight when I felt like it and that I'm happy with myself.

Yes, I actually said I'm happy with myself.  I kind of am.  I mean, losing weight is a priority to me because I miss being 115 lbs.  *giggles*  But at the same time, who cares?  I looked cute today.  I'm not like huge or anything like my mother is trying to make me feel, or like my father used to say I was when I was 115 lbs.  I'm a little overweight, big deal.  Anyone who doesn't like it can fuck off.  

I love you all!!!!!! **************************HUGS AND KISSES********************************"

"event","Okay.  I've been convinced to pull myself together and get dressed up for Halloween.  So I've been doing a costume search tonight and found the PERFECT one.  The only issue is I have to make it lol.  I'm not too worried about it.  I already figured out how.  I just have to find a way to get all the materials and find the time to start working on it with out the kitties and puppy being pains and interrupting.  I'm pretty proud of my selection and of the fact that just by looking at it I know how to make it.  I'm gonna look freakin' awesome!  Now all that is left is to pick a costume for Chris, get them both all set and have fun on Halloween night.  Wish me luck guys on finding the cash it'll take to make this thing come together properly and remind me not to do it half assed.  Love you all!!! ******************************HUGS AND KISSES***************************"

Oh, I used my rollerblades the other day.  Then the geese came into the park.  Yo know those huge, evil canadian geese that bite and hiss at people?  Yeah them.  And if I were to hit one to get it to leave me alone I'd get fined cause some fucking kid made the mayor enforce stricted punishment for people who hurt the geese.  THOSE FUCKING THING SUCK!!!!  One of these days I'm gonna take Stitch to the park and make her chase them lol.  :)

"event","Okay so...I was at my sister's house last night and we were all hanging out having dinner.  She told me that the American Idol tryouts were comming to Boston soon.  I thought that was pretty neat and wished anyone from here luck because I'd love to see an American Idol from Boston make it all the way.  She told me that I should try out.  Now, the thing that confuses me about that is that my sister has never really complimented me on much through my life.  Granted I did take voice lessons for six years but I'm way out of practice.  It kind of made me happy that my sister believed in me enough to try to get me to give it a shot.  Unfortunatly I can't do it.  Naked pics on the net means no chance at American Idol.  Remember what happened to that one girl a few years ago?  It's just nice to know my sister thinks I would actually make it."

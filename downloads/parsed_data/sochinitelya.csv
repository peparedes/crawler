"event","I suddenly realized who Namara is partially inspired by: J. Thomas O'Malley from The Aristocats.  No, seriously.

Moving on.  I'm writing a Nuke/Sasha clip.  Actually, that should be a Nuke AND Sasha clip.  Because Sasha's straight.  Really he is.  And it's got nothing to do with pesky boy hormones anyway.  That's really all I can share right now.

After that, I kind of want to write a clip about Namara and Das, when Das was still all 'uncivilised'.  'Cause they were kinda cute then.  Namara trying to make friends with Das, and Das smacking Namara around.  Besides, then I get a chance to write about Jasin.  If you don't know who Jasin is, you haven't been paying attention, dammit.

What else...  Well, there's the Xander Ellis story, which is a rewriting of Cinderella.  No, honestly.  Except most of the genders have been switched, and 'Cinderella' is as gay as the day is long.  What?  Straight relationships don't really interest me.  I have straight chars, honestly.  Some just kinda take you by the shirt-front, look you in the eye, and quietly tell you that they like the opposite sex, not the same sex, so quit trying to turn everything into slash.  ANYway.  Xander Ellis story.  Needs to be done.

There's also the Godling story.  I wanted to write it in a linear fashion, but my brain goes to sleep every time I attempt to, so I'm going to put Maddy's past in flashbacks and get onto the good parts, which is Maddy and Mithos and, uh...  I really can't remember what else was involved in the story.  Except that Maddy is losing his flesh.  But not having it rot away and stink up the place, <i>De</i>.

Then we have those two stories I thought up for NaNo, <i>Ragnarok Now!</i> and <i>The Devil Wears Rollerskates</i>.  I've forgotten those plots too.  As well as the actual NaNo novel, which is decent but which I'm now stuck on.

THEN there's a ton of stories that have been started but never finished.  Like ToB, for instance.  Poor Ras and Nuke.  They've been abandoned.

I also want to do a parody of fantasy (which will include a description of someone as '...muscled like a maiden's fantasy', haha) but I might save that for NaNo '05.  Or I might do something involving all my chars, my muse, and 'Avatar', who's one of my multiple personalities.  No, really.  Have I explained this before?  There's Stefanie (the everyday one), 'Cuno (the online and writing one), and Avatar (the one who interacts with the characters inside my head).  Stop looking at me like that.

I think that's about it.  At least for now.  Gotta go and finish this clip, then, uh... vegetate.  Sayonara."

"event","I... have completed another short story.  A very short one.  2, 636 words.  Considering my last 'short' story was over 15, 000...  but hey.  It's done.  I sat my ass down and wrote it instead of doing my chores.  C'est la vie.  I don't feel quite as accomplished as I did when I finished 'Tiger, Tiger', but dammit, I <i>actually finished something</i>.  I'm getting better!  So, um, I'll probably post it in Happy_Rats once I figure out if anyone is actually still interested in that.  Toodles."

"event","That sentence just about sums up the entire way I interact with people.

Anyway.  I started a new story.  I should probably be excited about this, but I know myself, and I know full well that something will distract me and I'll leave it half-finished.  But we'll chatter about it anyway, might as well.

It's going to involve Kalei Sanoa ti Luren, from my NaNo.  She's a shapeshifter from the world Palasinia, and the first mate on the pirate ship Krakatoa.  This story is mainly before the NaNo, though it might touch on it and then go past it, I'm not sure.  Anyway, Kalei has a friend named Darius Keisateya (Key-za-tay-ah; Kalei calls him Cap'n Quesadilla, much to his annoyance) who is the captain of the ship and also a weather-witch.  Yes, weather-witch even though he's male.  He's a right bastard too; like, really, a bastard.  He's mean to everyone, although he's slightly less mean to the few people he actually likes.  He's got far too much attitude, but unfortunately he has the power to back it up.

We start the story with neither of these two, however; we start it with the third (so far) character, who's been drugged and tossed on a ship to be taken to prison for the supposed vicious murder of a bunch of people.  He swears he didn't do it.  And... well, he's sort of right.  His name's Rhys Brennar, or at least, that's the main personality's name.  He's a soul-collector, although he doesn't know it, which gives him multiple personalities which he has no idea about.  Basically, if he's nearby someone who died a violent death, he can absorb their soul before it escapes, and that person becomes a part of him.  The stronger ones can even take over, push 'Rhys' back for a little while.  Hence how he murdered people and doesn't even know it; that lovely personality is at the moment nameless, but takes over whenever Rhys gets mad.  Haven't completely worked out all the personalities yet.  Anyway, Rhys is drugged and on this ship, and his prison-mates are talking about wanting to chop up his body for meat (thinking he's dead).  Fortunately, Darius happens to also be a prisoner and wakes Rhys up.  Darius isn't really telling how or why he got captured, though he insists he did it purposely.  Methinks it has something to do with protecting Kalei.

So they're taken to prison, where they happen to share a cell, much to Darius's disgust.  We spend about a week there, guess it's sort of character building, before Darius decides to break free.  There's wards up there and everything but they don't affect him, mainly because Darius has a demon living inside him.  He's pretty infamous in this world (which isn't Palasinia, incidentally, but another one) as the 11th son of the Pirate King, the one who keeps causing all the damn trouble.  People are pretty terrified of him.

On the day Darius is going to implement his escape (which involves calling the mother of all storms up) Rhys happens to get pissed off.  He's sick of being picked on and beaten up, so he flips out.  The nasty personality takes over and people start dying.  Darius thinks this is excellent; while the guards are distracted with taking Rhys out, he's free to do his thing, and kill all of them while he gets out.

Doesn't quite happen that way...  He calls up his storm, yeah, but Rhys (in kill-all mode) uses it to escape at the same time, chasing after Darius.  The Rhys personality wants it 'cause the delusional fool thinks he's in love with Darius and the mean personality wants it because it really does not like Darius.  He catches up with Dar, meaning to kill him, but Dar is stronger than him, thanks to his demon blood.  Besides, the Rhys body isn't very equipped to fight at that point in time; Rhys isn't exactly a fighter.  He's basically going on the pure strength of the personality within him, which is actually pushing his body beyond its limits.  Dar manages to knock him out, and when he wakes up he's just Rhys again.

For whatever reason, Dar just can't seem to get rid of Rhys, despite the fact that he tries really hard.  At first anyway; eventually he just gives in for the time being, figuring maybe he can use Rhys.  After all, they still have to make it through the desert with the military tracking them, and get to the sea, where no one alive could catch Dar unless he wanted them to.

So they get to the sea and Dar tries to search out Kalei, only to find out that she's gone straight and is the captain of a merchant ship named Black Betty.  Which sounds like the name of a pirate ship, but what better way to scare off pirates than to make them think she's one of theirs?  Or better.  Dar, naturally, is pretty suspicious of this and catches a ride on an actual pirate ship belonging to a friend of his, and catches up with Kalei.  He reminds her that she's a pirate, not a merchant, and she readily agrees.  He commandeers her ship and renames it the Krakatoa, and it's off to sail the seven seas, yo ho ho.

Or not.  There's still Rhys to deal with, Rhys of the many personalities and the delusional crush on Dar.  Dar's already given orders to shoot him if he even looks like he might be reverting to another personality.  There's also the fact that they're both wanted criminals, and have death warrants out on their heads.

I believe I've mentioned that Kalei is NOT from their world but from a world called Palasinia.  Which means that she knows ways to get through worlds.  After a few modifications, the Krakatoa can also go to other worlds.  Which suits Darius fine; just means more plunder.  Kalei gets them away from the first world, meaning to take them to Palasinia to hide out for a while, but something gets crossed and they end up somewhere else.

Haven't really thought this part out yet.  Don't even know an ending yet.  I think I might kill off Rhys though.  Just because.  I'll probably ramble on about this more once I think more about it.  Or not; depends on my attention span, or rather, lack thereof.  Got lots of crap going on in my mind.  Because I'm insane.

Also thinking about writing more about the characters from the short story <i>Tiger, Tiger</i>.  I know, I've talked about it before, but things have changed.  TT is no longer the first; it's going to be preceded by a prologue of sorts that involves, of all people, Davan.  Gonna be called <i>Dark Falls Early</i>.  Funny how I can come up with these titles for these things when usually I suck at titles.  So anyway, the new order is <i>Dark Falls Early</i> which is the prologue; then part one, <i>Tiger, Tiger</i>; then <i>Girl With The Broken Smile</i> which is part two; then... well, whatever.  The last one is still <i>Play The Game</i>.  Not sure if this will be only a four-part series or will have more.  Suppose that depends on my muse.

Anyway, enough out of me, I need a shower and to write and stuff.  Adios."

"event","Alrighty.  NaNo is over.  What a chore that turned out to be.  I managed to get 32k of actual (rambling) story and then I got up to 50k by cheating.  I padded the shit out of it.  And I added in other random writing I'd done during the month when I just couldn't stand to do the NaNo anymore.  Whcih sort of sucks, 'cause I think I've got a fairly good story there, I just... need to figure out what the fuck is going on in it.  I'm gonna re-read it after this and see what we can do.  If nothing else, I still like my characters.  Especially Kalei.  She's just a whole shitload of fun.  And Malakai, too, even though he turned out totally different from what he was originally supposed to be.  I mean, he was supposed to be this sort of arrogant lordling with a soft heart, but he turned out to be kind, polite, well-mannered, friendly, and totally fucking naive.  I mean, seriously.  Sex doesn't even occur to him.  You could jump him and go, 'Take me NOW!' and he would quite seriously inquire, 'Take you where?'.  Maybe that's why I loves him...  Oh well.  He gets Jono; Jono is his complete opposite and is good for him.

I don't know why relationships interest me now... at least in writing.  I have no interest in pursuing one of my own, I just like writing about them.  I dunno, I have the mind of a 14-year-old boy.  It thinks sex is a funny topic.

Where was I going with this...  Oh well, that was NaNo, we'll see if it can be salvaged.  We'll see if any of my NaNo's can be salvaged.  Next year, I'm screwing the serious stories.  They make NaNo not fun, and to quote De, that's just not <i>right</i>.  So next year, we are going to write the most cliche, random, just-pulled-it-outta-my-ass, sarcastic story we can.  I foresee a return not only of the drunken cabbage, but its miniature pirate keeper.  And Percival Yancy Butler Yeats, the little purple mouse.  And maybe we'll have some busty lesbian ninjas in there.  I'm going to create a character who is a total Mary Sue and then I'm going to toss her into a completely random world.  It'll be sort of like me wandering through my own mind.  Actually, that sounds kinda fun...  Then I can have cameos of all my characters.  Well, whatever, I have an entire year to let things ferment.

Moving on.  I'm rewriting the Kiyoshi story, because it's fresh in my mind thanks to Namara (and recently Kiyo) spending so much time with Trent.  You think I'm delusional for this sort of thing.  Well, you're right.   I'm fucking insane, baby, and loving every minute of it.  Anyway...  I managed to get the first chapter rewritten and started on the second, before my dad introduced me to the unmitigated evil that is Spider Solitaire and I spent most of the rest of the day playing that, except for when I went riding.  We're going to attempt to rewrite a little more today, assuming my puny distracted little mind can ever concentrate on it long enough.  For one thing, I have to correct a major thing: the original of this story, written about a year and two months ago, has Kiyo as a fire mage.  Um, no.  Kiyo's a healer and uses air, as he informed me.  Namara's the fire mage.  Damn characters coming to life so much that THEY tell ME things.  Well, no, that's good, innit...  The characters have really changed.  And I learned Kiyo tends to take on part of his brother's persona (rude, blunt, insulting) when he's really afraid.  Maybe he really is a nutcase...  And Namara.  Hoo boy, Namara...  Damn that boy.  He started out as just a name, the one Braeden cursed when he found himself about to drown.  Don't ask.  I made it up by starting with the letter N and adding letters until I ended up with Namara.  I later found out it's a real word, it means 'cold sea' or something in Celtic, and it's also part of a name: McNamara.  Well, go figure, and ask me if I give a shit.  He was originally just supposed to be a prominent thief in Dann Cosel, and a friend of Braeden's, mentioned but never really seen.  Well, heh, he was having none of that.  Suddenly, he's got his own part in the story.  Suddenly he's got a whole past.  Suddenly he's got PERSONALITY.  He's the most developed character IN the story so far.  He was supposed to be a 'golden boy': blonde, golden eyes, golden skin, etc., etc.  He laughed at me.  He said his hair was dark, his wings were black.  He said his mother was a whore, and that he was the child of rape.  He said he was a half-breed, not that he was proud of that fact.  He told me he was a common-born bastard and he was proud of THAT.  He's also a total horn-dog.  Like, a TOTAL horn-dog.  He'll pretty much screw anything on two legs.  Except a priest; he hates priests.  He gave himself a family; friends, lovers, even two sons (although one died...).  And he told me he was King of Thieves and I better not forget it.  I know I've ranted about this before but STILL.  He's developed himself almost more than Nuke and Ras...  Those three are the characters that seem most real to me; like I could walk down the street one day and see them and it wouldn't feel strange at all.

Anyway, I've just been informed that I have to vacuum the entire house, do my laundry, go shopping, ride Riff, AND drop my brother off at work, so I better get my ass in gear.  'Cause, y'know, gods forbid I should enjoy my day off.  Fuck, no.  Maybe I'll get a chance to actually write this evening...  Highly doubtful, I'll be talking to De, and my little brain generally can't handle chatting and writing at the same time.  Poor girl might get some totally random comments.  Not that THAT'S exactly new...  Oh well.  Adios, muchachos (I discovered I'm not the only one who calls people muchachos; so does one of the writers for Something Awful; it was strange)."

i went and saw star wars today with one of my friends finally!  ... and it sucked
well there was one cool part ...here it goes...

so yoda walks in to a room to fight the leader of the dark side and when he walks through the door and on both sodes of the entrance there are guards, so like the pimp yoda is he waves his hand and the guards fly into the wall and of course die as a result....

if you havent seen star wars thats pretty much all your missin

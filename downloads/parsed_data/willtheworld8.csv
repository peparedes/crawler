"event","The street sign glows gold and blinds the crowd
Suede dreams speak of a time to tell
of the triumphs and anguish of our heart
We all thought you were brilliant but not sly as well

The skyscrapers bend and sway like a sunflower
Seasickness swells up on my tongue
I know you were going for friendship
But doesn't it appear it was you who got stung?

I don't even wanna return to how it was
that isn't my aim though
I missed my favourite part.

My six-shooter is coated in dust and grime
Where it lies is where is will stay
You still refuse to look at me straight
And the gun hasn't moved from where it lays

Obviously this isn't supposed to end well
It could mean alot of things
I don't even wanna return to how it was
that isn't my aim though
I missed my favourite part.

I don't even wanna return to how it was
that isn't my aim though
I missed my favourite part."

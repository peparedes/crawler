That's about it!

Love her! >3< I just ordered her a new wig that's a lot shorter so I won't have to wrestle with her current one. Also, it doesn't show in these photos but Molly has one blue eye. Her current blue eye is a size too small (14mm) so I ordered her a right sized odd eye from Nightfall ^^ I also got her a neat jacket from there...I just hope it fits alright. I want to get her a custom petticoat from the DoA marketplace but I have to wait on that for a bit. I got her some Dale Rae shoes that came in a week or so ago too! 

...Yeah, she's got a bunch of crap already lol

Of course I'm thinking about future dolls etc. I think next on my list is a Bluefairy Kyle girl and a Narsha friend Coco girl...I'm excited about her, woo! 

Anyway, I'm really going to draw some of my characters and post them here soon. Probably next journal.

That's about it...!"

"event","So.

 Yeah, no new dolls recently lol but I'm still having some good dolly days :D I finally received the outfit I ordered for Ivee and then was able to buy her that Mimiwoo sheep hat! She'll be so cute X3 I also changed Mill's outfit with the help of friends (They gave me the idea lol) I was frustrated with Mill for a while and didn't know why, but after I changed her clothes it was all good! I changed the direction of her eyes too...now she doesn't look like she's blankly/angrily staring at nothing. I need to do the same for Ivee cause she's giving that blank stare too lol

 I also did a nice photo shoot with Ivee on her own (before her new clothes came in) and then another with both of the girls. Fun stuff! My little babyish camera was actually working with me that day. 

 On another note, I keep thinking to myself ""Man, wouldn't it be cool if I had an SD?"" When, in reality, I do! XD Even if she is just a head she counts lol My Lydia (Soo SS Mod head)is not at school with me so I keep forgetting that I actually own her. I can't wait to get her body and everything else for her!! I get to do that when I go home for Thanksgiving break. Though that point I'm going to have to leave Ivee and Mill behind :( I want to bring Lydia to school with me and having all three of them here at the same time will be too much of a hassle since I'm out of state. I might just leave Mill home since she was at school with me last year but I don't know yet.

 As far as the future goes I'm really looking into getting Notdoll Lab's Bleu Citron. Yes...I want her! Notdoll face-up and all. I think I'm going to hybrid her though, since I don't really like the body she comes on. (Looking at the DollnDoll Spade girl body for that...?) I don't want to use her tongue piece though. She looks so adorable without it and I love her little teeth. I'm going to call her Tatum and she'll have big, frizzy hair. She's supposed to be from the same mysterious place Ivee is from except she's been in America longer and has grown used to it...pretty much becoming a modern girl. But she's conceited XD and jealous and whiny etc. Great stuff. :3

 Some other dolls I'm looking into for the future:
 -Limhwa ForYou - I haven't always liked this girl but I've fallen hard for her recently...wish there was more around...her mouth is so cute and I think she's make a good groupie with Tatum and Ivee.

 -Dollfie Dream - I want to make a girl with the new option head (DDH-04)! So cute with that smile!!! Reminds me of DD Nanoha who I'm love with. :3

 - Planet doll tan Half-eye Riz (as Faith) - Now, Faith is supposed to be Mill's close friend. She was originally going to be a tan Sleepy Eyes Pado girl but I think a tan half-eye Riz would work better. Planning to get this girl (along with Bleu Citron) for Christmas/ a couple of months after.

 -Dollmore's Narsha Friend CoCo - UMMMMM super cute. She'd be my first little one. Really want her lol I want to get her a custom Dollmore faceup with really thick eyebrows lol GAH so cute...hopefully I'll get her for myself for my birthday in May (Self gifting...pretty sad lol)

 -Angel Region Fair Diana: Sometime into the faaaaarr faar future I'll get this girl for Lydia...

Well, that's about it doll wise. Not too bad, right? Things are going okay school wise...just have to work my way through the end of this semester. I think I can get everything done and done well...I just have to get organized. (Osaka: ""Get it together...get it together..."" XD)
 
 That's all for me. Whoever reads this thing...Hope All is Well In Your World!

"event","So today I bought the Sleeping Soo Mod head mentioned in my last journal (with face-up by Sour_Dotz!!!! *spazzes*) from the DOA marketplace. :D I'm really excited about this head and her character, a Russian girl named Lydia who was raised in America. My big dilemma now is finding (and affording lol) a body for her. I'm about to buy the hands I want for her off of the marketplace too but I'm not sure how soon I can get everything else that this girl needs. I want to buy her a fur, mohair or just generally wispy wig and either light colored eyes or dark purple ones...not sure yet. Then I'd have to get her clothes/outfit together but I have a general idea of what I want for that. All in all, I'm super excited and can't wait for her to get here!

On another note, Lydia's character has a best friend that she grew up with named Diana. I know for sure that Diana is an Angel Region Fair Diana XD I'm not sure how long it will be before I can get her (probably around/after Christmas?) but what I do know is that I...would also like to have her faceup done by Sour_Dotz >< I love her work so much and I bet it will be amazing if everything works out..

Anyway, I'm off to study for a Biology test tomorrow..."

"event","Yeah, so I think I've changed my mind about UH-21. Not sure if I still want her as bad as I did back then...I guess I'll see when the 25th rolls around. They stop selling her on the 27th. If I'm panicking by that time then I'll know I want her for real XD She's still so perfect though!

Anyway, I'm thinking about buying a Delf Soo. I'd like to get her blank and have her customized though, as intimidating as that is lol, cause I have a look in mind for her. I'm going back and forth between what I'd like in an SD girl. Now I'm teetering between edgy and super cute. I figure if I get the Soo and make her into the character I want, a 20 something year old named Kitty, she could be the super cute (and sweet!) and I could get my hands on a Dollmore Liebe Klum next for the edgy look. Then they're complicated story would ensue etc etc. It would all be so awesome if I actually followed through with my doll plans from the start haha

I was also thinking about buying a modded sleeping Soo head from the market place with a BEAUTIFUL faceup and crazy long lashes. The head is going at a good price but I'm not sure how hard it would be to find a body for her etc. I'd want a Luts girl body for her but I hope one pops up in the marketplace (if I buy that head) to make things easier. Yeah, so, in other words I can never make up my mind.

As for school things are going okay. German is continuing to destroy me and even though I got a B on the first test there was no time to celebrate because I'm still getting things wrong left and right. It's pretty stressful, especially when the professor calls out random instances of idiotic and careless mistakes in class to prove his point to us. He doesn't say whose mistakes they were but when it's you you know it and yeah, you get your feeling hurt lol

My other classes are going pretty well I guess. I have to study for Biology for a test on Monday and I turned in my first story to my writing fiction workshop class today. I get work shopped on Friday and I'm pretty nervous. I read over my story time and time again and I liked it but after I handed it in my mind went to ""Man, this story freaking SUCKS."" It's pretty funny actually XD

Anyway, I bought Ivee, my dreaming Asha, a new outfit and some accessories so she can look as modern as Mill does now. I'm think about doing a photo shoot with both of them soon.

That's about it. :3"

I basically threw all of my doll plans out of the window and now I'm focusing all my attention (and money) on buying one girl: Unidoll's Unilimited UH-21. I fell pretty hard for her when I saw her for the first time but was disheartened when I found out she was a limited released way back when.

Well, now she's back...for three weeks...in urethane....and I have no money at the moment. I hope I can manage somehow and bring her home. I don't know how I would put her down if she was in my hands haha

(She's perfect by the way)

"event","Well, I'm back at school in VA once again...as you can see from my last entry XD

It's going pretty well I guess. German is kicking my butt since I haven't spoken/written it in about 2 years...and Biology was pretty hard to get started but I think things will go well with that class in the end. I'm also taking a writing fiction class so I have to get started on a short story ASAP...I don't know what to write about!!!!

Anyway, I've started drawing again (for real) so maybe I'll post something here :3 I've got a new scanner too so 'Yay pencil drawings and line art!' I want to improve so much so I have a lot of drawing to do. Yeah...

And last but not least, DOLLS! :D I brought Ivee and Mill to school with me. I was going to leave them back home in Texas but I figure I can leave them at home when I go back for the holidays or put them away when I feel distracted. My poor dollies...so neglected for now XD They're sitting on my little shelf above my books so I can pick them up any time I'm in the mood to play haha. And, as to be expected, I'm looking into getting yet another mini...or even an SD...here we go again @__@

I'm seriously considering Bluefairy Tiny Fairy girls! I already have a character for (and have drawn a little) Bluefairy Sarang. Her name will be Cadence. The other would be a Bluefairy Louis girl on a full blossom body. I never thought I liked Louis but once I saw the mold as a girl I was sold. :D

As far as SD's go I'm looking at Dollfie Dream!!! I actually love them...so cute. I put up a WTB thread for a DD Yukino head a while back when they were sold out at Volks. I was excited to buy one but no one responded...until now! But I don't have the money for her anymore @__@ I used it for books for school...yeah, right when someone offered to sell me one WITH face up...so cute. I'm hoping I can salvage some money in time to grab that particular head before she is sold to someone else but I doubt it. 

On another note I was also looking at the new Glorydoll girl Hoshino Miyuki. She's so exotic/mischievous looking and I love the new body! If I were to get her though I'd want to buy Lucy (or just her head) at the same time...she always looked amazing to me. What a face...especially in that new make-up with those eyebrows *sighs*

So, overall, I think I over think these things and set my sights too high. XD

Well, classes again on Monday etc. I'll post next time with doll updates and pictures. :3"

 So, Ivee, my Pink Riding Hood Asha, and her stuff made it home in perfect condition (Dollmore worries me sometime when it comes to that)and she looks wonderful. :3 I really like her! One thing that annoys me about her though is that she has the S-hook attached to the head cap system and it gets crazy trying to take her head cap off @__@ I spent that day just playing with her and Mill. Ivee poses great! She holds her poses no matter what...as opposed to Mill who is strung pretty tightly. It's all good though. I changed both of their hands out (For some reason I dislike dollmore kid default hands) with the help of my little sister XD She's only 6 but MAN without her I wouldn't have been able to change anything on them.

I want to do a good shoot with them outside but my camera is not fairing too well...I'm pretty sure its on the verge of a breakdown. I can use my brother's but his confuses me to no end. I want to do the shoot at either the park when no one is around or make it really simple and just do it across he street.

On a side note I purchased a busou shinki girl (Harmony Grace) and she's so much fun! It kind of took me forever to get her to hold her huge gun and pose on the stand at the same time but I did it in the end lol. Now she's on display and looks amazing...I think I'll snatch my brother's busou shinki girls and pose them around her haha

Well, that's about it on dolly stuff that really matters. Here's a photo of Ivee and Mill (Mill got new stuff too) :P

"event","Well, I took the plunge and bought my second girl. She wasn't any doll I mentioned before but she wasn't a sudden decision either. I ordered Dollmore's Pink Riding Hood Asha. Another MSD after my SD rant! I'm really excited but not at the same time...I don't know...there are other things going on. :/ Anyway, my sister lost my camera so I'm not even sure if I'll be able to take good  pictures of my new girl when she gets here. Her name will be Ivee though and she is too cute! I'm not sure what I'll do with all her extras since she's a full set kind of doll (Pink riding hood set, changeable ears etc.) She did come with the open hands I wanted! I also ordered fist hands for Mill and a peace sign hand just for kicks :3 I really love the she's a sleepy eyed Asha in normal skin (!) and that's why I wanted her the most. But...with my luck I wouldn't be surprised if Dollmore released a basic sleepy eyed Asha right after Ivee arrives lol

Mill has a new look by the way. Her new mimiwoo glass eyes make me looovvee her :3

And I think short hair is amazing which is why Mill is sporting a new wig and I'm sporting a new haircut lol

Anyway, this summer has been pretty down. I love being home in Texas but it's so blah...I don't have many friends because I only attended school here for one year. The kids there didn't really open up to new kids even if we opened up to them. I wanted to make friends but it wasn't happening! Then my accident happened and I was gone for what felt like forever etc. and then there was graduation :/ Needless to say its gets pretty boring not having anything to do with anybody. I figure if I hang out at the mall with my sister we could meet new people but she does her own thing so its hard to keep up with her lol

Also, I can't bring myself to draw! I mean reallllly draw! Like just sitting on my bed, listening to music and drawing until 5 in the morning like I used too. I don't know why.

"event","Well, I don't have any new dolls at home yet but I will be buying within the next two weeks! :D I finally have the money I need! :D

 The problem is that my ""dolly plan"" has been completely thrown off thanks to Dollmore. I already have my first girl from them but today Dollmore released a tan version of her. How can I RESIST? I already love her mold and I'm crazy about tan dolls in general sooo... =__=

The good thing is that I actually was contemplating buying the Paran mold a second time so I could have twins but I was afraid of monotony between them if I did so. Now that she comes in tan my problem is solved! :D

Anyway, the reason my initial plan went out the window is because I was really down for buying a Souldoll Hye. I really do love that mold and would be more than thrilled to have her here but I don't want to jump in and buy too many things at once. Even though it's a lot of money in the first place I still have to budget...if that makes any sense. 

Not only THAT but I keep going back to look at Dollmore's Model doll Lasia. Not sure if I mentioned her in my last journal but I'd really love to have her around. Although taller dolls like her intimidate me a bit I can't help imagining her long legs hanging over the side of my doll dresser, or posing her for photos, or dressing her up @3@. Those kinds of things excite me! XD The custom faceup by Dollmore I'm envisioning for her makes me want to buy her even more. (Both suntan Paran and Souldoll Hye would have the basic faceup) The only thing I'd be worried about though is finding clothing for her. I know Dollmore offers plenty of Model doll clothes but I'd like to try a certain style with her so clothes from other places would be nice too. Maybe I'm not looking hard enough/ the right way but I can't seem to find clothes for a girl doll her size. (Besides in Dollmore, of course, and Soom.)

Oh yeah, and SUPIA! I love Supia girls and hope to own one one day *3* It's a toss up between Roda/Dreaming Roda and Lana. I hope they make more beautiful sculpts soon.

Anyway, here's a photo of Mill now:

On a non-dolly note, Summer has started!! I'm already home in Texas and its sooo relaxing being back. Also, I now have a kitten. :3 He came home with us yesterday and he seems really happy here! His name is Coal and he's a really sweet silver tabby. I've been asking for a kitten/cat since I was 6 years old and I finally got one XD

Well that's it...I guess I'll be updating this more often considering dolly stuff is actually happening around here!"

Spring break was fun! :D Well, I'm no party girl so I spent my spring break with my best friend and we had an AMAZING time doing absolutely nothing XD We hit up the mall and she bought about $115 worth of manga haha we hung out in the mall for a little bit, saw one of her dorm neighbors there (we don't go to the same school :p ) We then proceeded to spend the rest of the week messing around and laughing our asses off at everything. Yeah, we just had a good time all around.

As for Mill, she was there too! She hung out on the bookcase where the cats couldn't get her XD It was no trouble bringing her along...I just put her in one of my bags. I'm paranoid about one of her fingers breaking so I took some bubble wrap I had lying around and wrapped her hands (up to her forearm) with it. I secured it with some hair bands haha My friend's mom almost threw her hand protectors and face mask away. She said ""What the hell is this trash up here?"" when she saw it on the bookcase XD 

Well, I've been bonding with Mill so much. I'm really happy I got her as my first doll. Here's some shots of her from after the snow storm. I went with a friend who has a DOC Bee-A named Adrian to take some photos when everything was all white. :3

Also! I have decided to put my money towards a Model Doll Lasia from Dollmore! I want her to be a character named Corii. (made for the doll) I hope it works out that way XD

That's all for now. :3"

"event","So, I've decided that my dolly plan is not working out. -__- I had it in my head that I would buy only the dolls I want in a specific order according to my wish list. I would go back and modify the list in the order of the dolls I was going to buy. If they were at the top they were going to be bought next and so on. But man, that just isn't working out!! The dolls on my list keep switching spots and its too much to keep up with. So, I've decided to just buy dolls as I go. If I see something I like I'll put my money towards it. If I see something else that I want more I'll put my money towards that...I guess it'll stay that way until I actually make a purchase XD

In other words, I said in my last entry that I KNEW Zaoll Muse would be next doll etc. but now that's not the case. I'm eyeing Domadoll Geul right now and obsessing over her haha and who knows what I'll look at next that I might like better. @_@ Very hectic I guess haha especially since actually purchasing dolls, instead of looking at and researching, is fairly new to me. I guess when I have enough money in my hand I'll know what I want because I'll have no other choice but to spend it XD What I DO know is that my next doll will be a girl...not sure about size though but either another MSD (eyeing Bluefairy Olive :D ) or my first SD. But yeah, I don't know. It's hard for me to keep organized at this point...who knows what I'll end up getting lol

Anyway, I took some more pictures of Mill this week and I think they turned out alright. It was dark and in my room so the lighting sucked, but I still like some of the photos. Here's one of 'em:

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/korikochan/pic/00003xak/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/korikochan/pic/00003xak/s320x240"" width=""179"" height=""240"" border='0'/></a>

I changed her outfit too. It isn't a new one or anything but it's still cute :3


<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/korikochan/pic/0000565z/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/korikochan/pic/0000565z/s320x240"" width=""179"" height=""240"" border='0'/></a>

Okay, so it isn't really all that cute but I felt like changing it XD I can't wait to buy her new things. :3

So yeah, some of the SD girls I'm looking at in case you'd like to know: 

Doll in Mind Love Bellosse & Kassia: I love both of them so much! What I do know about them is that if I buy one I have to buy the other. It's like they go together in my mind @-@ 

Domadoll Geul: As I mentioned earlier, I'm obsessed with her at the moment. I really like her squinted eyes and cute lips. In a way, she reminds me of an older version of Mill, my Paran. Just a little though...I think its those lips XD And the Domadoll had to release the Applebin version of her in that really cute outfit *sigh*

Dollmore Model Doll Bonnie Hopezs: I've loved this girl for so long! She's so gorgeous. She looks like your run of the mill college student and a cute one to boot haha. I wish more people had her...I have seen a guy version of her though and he blew me away...so well done. @-@

Musedoll's Ciel F01 and Re-an: Ah, I love these girls. Not one more than the other because they both look amazing haha. I love those lips! Re-an reminds of my sister though. She looks like a doll she'd get, especially in that ""In da club"" outfit XD

Yeah, of course there's more but I don't feel like going on haha

Well, that's it for tonight...I'm going to be lazy and sleep through the weekend :D"

"event","So, the sweater I bought for Mill from DoA arrived on the 2nd and she's been wearing it ever since. :3 It looks really good on her and it's really well made! I love it!! Annnd I was finally able (after long bouts of laziness, boredom, procrastination and nervousness) to do a photo shoot with Mill outside. :> The pictures turned out pretty good and I finally got some clear, decent photos of her overall. :> 

Here's one of my favorite shots:

I don't know if it's just me but in certain photos and at certain angles she often resembles a minifee miyu. Not that much but just sometimes. :3

and here's one of the both of us:

<a href=""http://pics.livejournal.com/korikochan/pic/00002dhf/""><img src=""http://pics.livejournal.com/korikochan/pic/00002dhf/s320x240"" width=""180"" height=""240"" border='0'/></a>

lol


On another note, I have finally decided that my second girl will, in fact, be a Zaoll Muse basic. Like with my DM Paran, I used to hate the Muse mold, but then I grew to love her and realized that she was perfect for one of my characters named Victoria. Victoria's nickname is Dirty so I'll probably refer to her as that most of the time. I know it'll be a long while before I can get her but I'm still excited about it. :3 She'll be my first SD even though, to my knowledge, she's one of the shortest SD girls around. I love seeing her in the galleries at DoA!!  I love her body and her hands and her face and !!!! Yeah, I'm excited. I also like looking at Zaoll Luv's because they are also gorgeous.  

The thing is, Dirty has sort of a partner in crime, whose name is RenRen, and pretty much wouldn't be complete without her. I was thinking that a tan narae 43 (considering RenRen's character is a bit shorter than Dirty) would be the perfect mold for her but then I saw the arrival of the tan Samantha Herren's ._. RenRen is a black girl with sort of a wicked smirk and a nasty temper, and for some reason Samantha Herren looks like she could fill that role (with the right clothes and face up ect. of course) Not only that but I saw a Narae standing next to a zaoll, and they looked perfect together, but the narae does seem a little immature (size wise) compared to the zaoll. Theeeen I saw a Samantha H. standing next to a Narae and she was a pretty good height (I think about 45cm) which meant she'll probably look pretty damn good next to a Zaoll (About 52cm?). The final step would be to see a SH next to a zaoll and then that'll confirm it! Excuse my size ramblings but this is just the dilemma that is going on in my mind ><

As for the Angell studio Cinderella mentioned in my last post, I realized that although I do like her lovely face, I was more in love with her school outfit and the thought of having her than with the actual doll. She may still be a choice for the far future but she's not on my wish/ want list right now. I just wish more people had her on DoA because I do like looking at her. >>;; 

Other than that everything is pretty ok! My brother is flying up from TX to here in VA so maybe he'll be able to visit me :3

I'll post some drawings I have of Dirty and RenRen in one of my next entries <3"

"event","Today was a pretty chill day :>

My morning class was canceled due to black ice or something so I only had one class today!

Anyway~

I've been taking pictures of Mill throughout the week. Here are some random ones :3

This is one of her original looks (I'm going to be selling that pink dress in the last entry sooner or later lol) I also bought her an awesome sweater from a member on DOA (she has a beautiful 43cm Narin boy *3* )it should be here soon! I bought it to sort of replace the white shirt she's currently wearing from dollmore because the string on the sleeves has been fraying since it got here...

Well, today I discovered Angel Studio's Cinderella (Campus version) and I've become obsessed with her -_- I've been looking at crazy adorable SD girls all week and she happened to pop up. She has the cutest face and I've given her the name and personality I would want for her already...and she comes in tan. TAN! I think my mind is set on her being my next doll even though I already have a set wish list XD lol Her uniform is really cute and I like the look of AS's double jointed body. Some other girl's I've been looking at are Napidoll's Chesi and Chrara (who I drew last night! I'll post the picture next entry) I think seeing people's super sweet Volk's girls is what got me onto this sweet SD girl kick...but I don't mind! Looking and contemplating dolls is a lot of fun ^^"

"event","I turned this into a Dolly/Art/Writings journal! Don't know how often I'll update but it seems like a good idea because this LJ has been sitting around since I was like...15 or 16? lol

Mights as well start this off by talking about my new(ish) girl.


<img src=""http://i104.photobucket.com/albums/m173/CJKOA/Millinfrills061-1.jpg"" />


Mill is a Kid Dollmore Girl Paran. She arrived somewhere around the beginning of January (Don't really remember...I was on the road when she arrived lol)

It was crazy choosing my first doll =_= I didn't know what I wanted...I had Suntan Momo in mind at first but that fell through after I saw Doll in Mind's Bellosse lol

I ended up choosing Mill because she was one of the very first dolls (Besides Bellosse) that I really became obsessed with...it's weird because I hated her look at first XD That is until dollmore began releasing pictures of her modeling clothes. Glad I picked her, no regrets here at all.

Buuuuttt Mill didn't start out as Mill. (Her full name is Millicent Lacro)She was originally supposed to be a preplanned character named Peru that I had rolling around in my thoughts months before. (When Momo was still on my wish list as a character named ""Poet"") When I ordered her during Dollmore's free shipping event I decided to get some clothes with her along with the wig and eyes that matched her character. Alas, Dollmore sent the wrong wigs and eyes =_= and ended up giving me something that looked like off versions of the ones she has on in the default pictures.

I was angry for literally 5 seconds before obsessing over her for the next day or so. When I calmed down I was like ""Well damn."" I asked dollmore if they could send me the ones I requested in the first place and they wanted to compromise. They would send my items if I sent theirs back. Uh, no. I didn't have the money at the time to do that (airmail to Korea, even for small items, is apparently quite a lot) what with Christmas just a couple of days ago and traveling etc. Besides...I would feel wrong sending them back a wig that was pretty much crapped out by the time I got around to sending it back (It's an easy frizz, easy tangled, long synthetic wig) I just figure that I'll ask them to include the items in a future order or at least try to find similar ones in the market place by myself...that is...if I ever want Peru to come back XD

The wheels of the bonding process are already turning lol I love Mill the way she is and I find it a lot of fun creating her character as I go. Not sure if I'll do this every time but it's a nice way to start out. 

Some other good things:

My roommate doesn't think dolls are creepy or weird at all and likes it when I have Mill out and about :3 Makes me happy (and relieved)

There's a friend with a BJD of her own (A DOC Bee-A named Adrien) who lives one door down from me. Utter dolly bliss when I found this out. She has some other dolly friend connections on campus too. 

I didn't have to haul Mill's box from TX to VA for school because she fits comfortably in my bottom drawer. lol
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Well, besides doll stuff I have some reading to do for my Theater 101 class (which I'm only taking for the Art credit because they didn't offer any studio drawing classes this semester D:) 

I've been drawing a lot more lately so hopefully I'll be able to post some sketches up here...

That's about it

Well, I didn't think I'd write this much for this entry but oh well haha"

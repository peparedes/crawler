"event","oh boy, oh boy...  i moved into my new office today.  wow!!!  i love it.  now i just need some art for the walls and to actually be there.  my new apartment is very cool too.  my life transition is going more slowly than i thought, but it is turning into something so wonderful.  the only problem is i'll miss my friends from madison.  :(  y'all will have to come down for a movie night or something some time during the week.  though, i'm not sure how much of a workahaulic i'll have to be teaching 4 classes and finishing my dissertation.  eventually i'll need a break.  yay!  i love my new job!  yay!"

"event","yesterday i found out for sure that i won't be graduated in time to start my position.  i suppose in the long run, this won't matter to me, but in the short run, it was a bit of a blow.  i've just got to keep hanging in there, a little bit longer.  it would be nice if i knew how much longer, but i just don't.  dissertations are one of those things that until you're about a month away from finishing, you don't know when that month will come.  grr...."

"event","Tired, tired tired...  Much to do today.  I'm being lazy and driving in, super lazy and paying to park so I don't have to walk far to get to lab...  What I'd really like is a nice icy latte.  Mmmm.  This evening I'm looking forward to a beer with Martha at the Dry Bean.  We'll see if they have any decent music.  In my next life (which will begin when I graduate) I want to check out lots of local music and arts events.  Madison has so much to offer and I've been living in a cave, practically.  

Perhaps someone knows how to beam lab equipment to home?  I'd totally do it - just to work at home.  

Tired, tired, tired...

Drag, drag, drag...

Complain, complain, complain.

Ok, time to get going.  :)"

"event","I was watching my dogs playing today.  It has been a day of pretty extreme grief for me.  I feel like I've lost two of the most important people in my life.  It is partly my choice - to do what I think is good for me rather than compromise.  Those choices are always risky.  Either way you lose something.  But I've been trying the latter for quite some time and I think it is time for me to try the former.  Ultimately ya gotta follow your heart, you know?  

Anyway, my little puppy Squeaky (or Sparky or any number of other cutesy names) was playing with my adult puppy Nectar for about a half hour on my bed this afternoon while I was reading a chapter about thermodynamics to help my friend make questions about it.  It was one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen - not just the thermo :) - but the puppies.  The intimacy they can share just by making little biting motions and pawing at each other.  Play.  There's no goal.  There's no end.  In fact, I'm not sure if there was a beginning.  It was very sad for me to watch as well.  That kind of free exchange of happiness is very rare among humans and I feel a loss of it today.  

It is raining.  I found out today why breezes form.  Somewhere out there a warm land mass is losing air and wind comes in from a cooler area to replace it.  It feels nice.  Change.  It comes so swiftly to me these last few months.  I can hardly blink and my whole internal self seems to restructure again.  I guess it is that cocoon thing.  I am struggling.  

I feel confident about being on the right path for me, but it has come with a large price.  Being true to oneself is expensive.  I hope not to lose too many connections along the way.  I will do what I can, without compromising who I need to be right now.  

There was this cheesy bit of advice given in ""The Last Samurai"" which I watched over the weekend...  Something like, ""Mind crowd, mind opponent, mind motions.  Too much mind.  <long pause>  No mind.  No mind.""  It kinda hit home.  If I actually put my mind to all the things that I need to do or be or think, I get lost and depleted very easily.  What seems to work best is to think about nothing and to just watch myself doing all those things I need to do and be and think.  I really feel like I'm in an altered state with this degree finishing stuff.  So much in my life is changing to accomplish this goal.  I'm not yet aware of who I'm becomming, but I have this light inside me that I'm watching, and I think it is me, always has been, and always will be, and I'm watching it.  I'm not going to stop watching it because otherwise I will be surrounded by the darkness of this cocoon and not know where I am.

In retrospect, I probably make no sense here.  :)  But that's ok, eh?  What a journal is for...  To ramble and rant and go back later and see if any of your life pieces fit together in a pattern.  :)"

"event","In keeping with the theme of my life this month - which has something to do with butterflies - I thought I'd start actually writing in my live journal.  I've always loved to write...  

I used to keep a paper journal - the old fashioned kind with a binder?  :)  I stopped doing that, though, because it felt lonely.  Maybe this will be better because all my friends can read what I write and that is what makes it worthwhile to write for me.  I write for whomever wishes to read.

Martha tells me that change happens swiftly, all at once, like tectonic plates colliding.  I think she's right.  My life is like that right now.  I'm about to start a new phase in life - hence the butterfly theme - but right now I'm not yet sure this cocoon is going to burst in time to coincide with the phase I want to enter.  Amid the extreme stress this uncertainty causes me right now, tonight I feel very calm.  It must be the breeze tonight.  It sifts into my window and enlivens and awakens me.  Everything is going to be ok.

Decryption of this email will follow in further posts.  :)  For now, I just wanted to introduce the tone of my life currently."

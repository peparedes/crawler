"event","I am doing the final touches on cleaning my room.  Most of us are looking forward to being home.  I wonder how well I did on my speech.  There was a party yesterday.  We went to a nice restaurant around 12am, I only stayed till 2:20am.  All I have to do is vacuum and wash the floor, then pack my carry on and duffle.  Tomorrow at 9am is my room check, and then go to the ceremony.  I think after that I turn in my helmet and hand over my bike.  Not too many worries left.  I hope I can find the bagged delivery service, get my luggage, check that in, have a nice lunch, maybe shop around downstairs though I don't think I will have room in my carry on for anything.  I really wish I could sleep on buses and planes.  I'm charging the batteries on my PSP, and camera.  Don't have much to do tomorrow really.  Once I am packed and everything is over, I might get my sides and back of my hair cut.  Maybe make one last stop at the Denkiya to see if there is anything new out that I can't get in America.  I think I will go back to cleaning, soon people will be waking up in America.  Then maybe I won't be so bored in my room.  

See you all soon!"

"event","So it's the day before the written final exam.  Things are pretty tame.  It's pizza ravioli for me.  I have my luggage sent to the airport.  Tomorrow I have to pick up the tickets at the front office so that I can pick up my luggage there.  I just got done practicing some Kanji.  I expect this test to hurt my brain, but I can only do my best.  I have taken all the posters down.  Little by little I am cleaning out drawers and making bags of trash.  Not much left to do.  I have to give my helmet and bike to Karen to sell.  I have to pack my duffle bag in the end.  I have to vacuum and wash the floor of my room.  Wipe the dust off the shelves.  I think I will be sad when I leave... now that it's coming time.  Knowing I won't be back.  It's been pretty fun.  I really wish I had got to go to Kyouto, to that temple with the billion red gates.  It has rained for like the 4th day in a row now.  Despite that the weather is great.  Not too many people seem to be studying for the final exam (glares at Dooley)... but I guess the first years don't need to study really.  And the others that aren't doing so well like me, well they pretty much gave up.  I am still tugging the line along, all but praying for a passing grade.  Now mind you... I don't get it.  Not the language, but my grade.  I can speak in class.  I can use the grammar forms.  I understand it all.  Kanji still is a problem area, but... clearly I understand the language and the course material.  This is not reflected in my grade that I think I will receive.  Well aside from that, my speech went well... but for some reason I was super nervous.  It seems the harder I play it cool and think it's nothing, the more I get nervous when the time comes.  Must come up with a new tactic.  

Well that's pretty much today's update.  It's the 12th here.  As of tomorrow I will have 2-3 days left depending how you look at it.  I am not in a big hurry to get home, but I do miss peeps...

and Mtn. Dew...and maybe some Taco bell... a normal bed... normal summer weather... regular sized bugs... breakfast food... normal stores to shop in...  my car... cell phone... a computer that doesn't randomly shut down at complete random times... the ferrets... real hamburgers... being able to walk around and not get stared at... 

but...  I will have no one to speak Japanese with.  Komata ne...

"event","Well my paper is done.  I have most of my things packed.  I have to make sure all the weight is pretty much even and under 70 lbs each bag.  Ya I know that's alot of junk.  Imagine the fact that I am leaving alot here with my roomate.  Heh.  All I have to do is turn in my paper and take the final.  I have Monday and Wednesday off.  We have the listening final on Tuesday, and the written final on Thursday.  That's not so bad.  I just have to fit my clothes in the last suitcase and decide what I want to do with my pillows.  Monday morning I have to send my luggage to the airport.  They said to allow for 5 days, not including weekends.  I am trying to dry my laundry as fast as possible.  My windows have condensation all over them.  I guess I lucked out not having to ship anything home.  I would hate to have to spend way to much money on boxes that take forever to reach home and in who knows what condition.  I think I am going to make copies of the papers from Homeland Security that proves that all the stuff is mine.  I want to keep the used up space in my carry on light.  It is a hassle taking everything out at the airport security.  So maybe I will put my camera and external hard drive in a suitcase.  Then again I am a bit scared they will be stupid and confiscate anything they feel like.  I need to put only the clothes I absolutely need in the other duffle bag I have so that I can change clothes during the week without my luggage.  I sure hope nothing breaks in my suitcases. ; p  Meh."

"event","So our speech practice took forever.  We had to give it three times...  on top of that she corrected her own corrections.  My god...  who is running this army.  Honestly, I just want to be home.  It's been great fun, and one big learning experience... but I gotsta go!  Coleman moved his flight time to mine.  We are getting our Haruka tickets today.  I have to correct speech, and write my paper... ya.  Then I am done.  I have Monday and Wednesday off.  Sweet sweet.  On Monday I have to my luggage out.  I seem to remember it taking forever last time.  Aaaah well.  Soon enough I guess.  See you guys soon."

"event","This semester is weird.  We are doing our speech earlier than normal.  On top of that, everyone is leaving at weird times.  I need to find out the time of my flight on April 17th.  We have to be out of JCMU on the 16th.  I wonder what I will do.  I could take a train that day to Osaka-Kansai Kuukou, or stay at a hotel near Hikone Eki.  My room is clean and rearranged.  My laundry is clean, dried, and put away.  I will have to do a small load of laundry before I go.  I am thinking about trying to pack everything into what luggage I have and weighing it to see if I can do it without shipping things home.  I guess we'll see.  My hair is getting pretty out of control, but I don't really trust my Japanese for getting it trimmed the way I want.  Well all that aside, I am pretty early in the getting ready sense of things.

"event","Well, I have two weeks left.  I have a paper to write for my Japanese Pop Culture class that is due on April 10th.  I just put my laundry in, finished doing the dishes, reorganizing the cubards, unpacking my box that just came in the mail(salsa was broken open, and the box looked like the shippers playe soccer), unpacked and threw out all the boxes for my figures (trust me they took up way too much room in the boxes), I wrote my final draft for my speech, I have to pack/ship out a box or two, decide what is going/what is staying/what is being thrown out, take the trash out, hang up my laundry, rearrange my room to the original design here at JCMU, put the doors back on my slider, make dinner, take down the last few posters in my room, take my extra books that I have read down to the sharing shelf, wash and vacuum my floor, and that's about it.  It will be a big project cleaning my room.  It was clean before Tokyo, but I some how managed to get alot of empty pop bottles again.  No one has commented on my Tokyo pictures yet... :(  Funny that time seems to blur by, and yet slow down all at the same time.  I am not home yet, but for some reason an individual days worth of time goes flying by.  I need to desmokify my room.  It happens to be a really nice day out so I have my window  open, but until I get all the things off my floor, I can't really get to work on the smoke smell.  My room mate is staying over the break into the next semester, but he is worried that they will not let him stay here in JCMU's dorm until the semester starts.  That would suck because then I would have to dispose of alot more.  I am finding it hard to decide what I really want to put in my luggage, and what I want to ship home.  Also after seeing this last box come in the mail, I am leary of putting anything I want to come back in one piece through the mail.  I am sure I will come up with something.  Also I think I am going to Osaka-Kansai airport alone.  I dunno how I feel about this.  I have to make sure I have my luggage sent to the airport 5 or so days before I go.  Also I don't know if I can get my airplane ticket through the internet this time around.  Last time when I went home it was really easy since I left alot here... but now I have this feeling that things are not going to go as smoothly and bringing all things here, or going home for Christmas.  Two weeks left and I have 270 dollars left on me, and 200 some on the bank card.  Should be more than enough to last, but who knows how much it will cost for shipping box(es) home.  I guess we can only wait and see.  I have been steadily putting things I don't need in the cabinet in the main room for Clint to use during his time here.  All of my extra medicine/vitamins/gum/candy/school supplies and the like.  I might have a job already lined up for me when I get home.  It should be nice to do something physical, that is if I can get fixed by my Chiropractor.  I think I am goint to take a break for a moment before I dive head first back into preparing my room and such for leaving Japan.  I don't want to be that guy the night before... freaking out about all the things I didn't keep in mind."

"event","So ya... here I am... with maybe 2 and a half weeks left.  This weekend we are going to Tokyo via Shinkansen both ways.  We were going to take the night bus back to save money, but found out today that it is full.  We are saving tons o cash staying at a Hostel, so there is that.  This week I really need to start packing my things up, researching and typing up my paper for Japanese Pop-Culture, and polishing up my final speech for Japanese.  Time to clear out my closet of anything I don't need, and deciding on what I need to just throw out.  JCMU has decided only to send out boxes ever Monday.  I hope to send my luggage to the Airport via takyubin.  I hope there are no problems with that.  I would hate to have to carry my still heavy luggage to Hikone station, on the Haruka, and to the Osaka-Kansai airport.  Wouldn't be much fun.  It looks like I will be doing this all on my own.  Most people are leaving after me.  It was funny the other day, Clint's conversation partner was super surprised that our dorm room was bright.  I have taken down all my anime posters, and the cloth that was covering the over head light.  Our apartment is back to ""insane asylum"" white.  Sorry that I really didn't take many pictures this semester.  It takes a long time for me to resize them all and host them on another sight, then post'em here.  It looks like my first box home is going to be heavy.  Even with me tossing out un-needed items, and sending cloths and other such things now, it may be heavy.  We will see I guess.  Let's see... I got the rest of this week... then Tokyo on the weekend.  There is no test next week, just review, Pop-Culture paper, polishing up my speech, mailing things home... then my final exam the week after that.  Where has the time gone?! Hehe.  Well I'm sure you at home have felt it more than I.  I hope that I have purchased some useful tools for my major that I wouldn't normally be able to buy.  http://www.hostelworld.com/availability.php/JGHTokyo-Tokyo-13590

"event","For about a week now my lappy has been giving me crap again.  Just when I think I have it all figured out.  Last semester it had heat issues, but I bought a can of air and a neat lil vent thing that constantly blows cool are at the bottom (made for laptops).  Ever since then I haven't had problems till about a week ago.  I am pretty sure my video card has been ""over heating"".  I just put some small boxes underneath the lappy to raise it up some.  Dunno what else to do.  I guess at least it is now and not the beginning of last semester.  How I can find out what the issue is when I get home.  My poor lappy... :("

"event","School hasn't been getting better.  I really am trying.  I supposed I could try harder, but I would be completely burned out.  As it is... I'm getting pretty burned out.  Like I have sad before I am looking forward to being home.  Above and beyond being a disappointment in a whole new way.  I got my itunes volume to play louder.  Someone messed with the equalizer.  I haven't listened to PR in awhile.  I just happened to Fire of Eternal Glory.  I couldn't help but smile, remembering that once I did good things.  Once I made it to the top of my dreams.  I know... I know... how ""emo"" of me... and on an LJ ta boot.  But knowing that I will never get to play with a group like that ever again.  It almost like age out night all over again.  How stupid that I do not know to cry because I'm happy or sad.  heh

Happy times."

There would have been more but there were multiple places where we weren't allowed to take photos.

"event","I have been struggling not to snap at everyone I interact with, though even that is taxing me.  Everyday I grow further behind now.  I am only a little behind now, but there is only so much time in a day.  I have stopped doing pretty much everything, but studying/eating/sleeping.  I haven't gone to buy groceries from the major store, withdrawn money from the atm, etc etc.  This wasn't always the case.  It used to be I understood the course material, but did very poorly on the tests.  I can say that I have learned alot, not just about Japanese, during my stay here.  Another step for growth...  I just want to be home.  I can't handle this fast pace anymore.  I have been burnt out 3 times over, and I can't seem to find the energy to keep it going.  I miss everyone back home, and it's frustrating knowing things are taking place that I am not apart of.  It's very frustrating always having the knowledge that each day you don't understand something.  What I mean by this is even if I had a good grade... even if I traveled to nice placed, saw the culture... even if I was fluent with the knowledge that has been put infront of me... there will ALWAYS be a large ammount of time during my day where I feel like I am left in the dark.  I am sad that the teachers have made me come to hate the Japanese language.  Maybe one day I will get over it, but right now I just want to be home.  I want nothing to do with the Japanese language in college.  In some cases Japanese teachers are helpful, but no more than if I had but a Japanese text book and taught myself and had a friend to compare notes with.  Tomorrow is March 1st.  I am counting down the days.  I appreciate my time here in Japan.  It has been an eye openning experience that was well worth it in my opinion.  

I want to be home.

There are somethings a foriegner will never understand... that is because we never were born Japanese.  It seems the lesson learned is to appreciate the differences in the world, even if you do not fully comprehend what they are."

"event","I studied for two and a half days straight for this coming test.  Nothing but preparing for the test.  Kanji, Vocab, Readings, Dialogue.  What do I get for it in return?  A screwed up test that I couldn't understand and almost didn't have enough time to finish.  I am pretty sure I won't receive a passing grade on it.  Again.  I am not the only one, but this doesn't make it any better.  Several students have spoke with the Director here about her tests.  They have also gone straight to her.  Her response is we aren't trying hard enough.  I knew all the content for both chapters and the grammar.  Back at EMU, I would have received an A.  I don't want to be here anymore.  I can't help it.  This is supposed to be a great experience.  I understand all the Japanese that has lead up to this so far, but I am not being tested on it.  Everyone wants me to do my best and I did.  Apparently on the last test my best is a 66%.  Ridiculous.  Even if I receive a passing grade, I know I shouldn't have.  I got so furious after the test I cried.  Does anyone know how FREAKIN MAD I have to be to have that happen?!  I can't try harder than I already did.  There isn't enough time in a day.  I made flash cards.  I wrote kanji over and over and over and over till I was blue in the face.  I checked particles and grammar.  But did the test check my knowledge of these things?  Where was the noun qualifying portion?  Where was the te oku, or the ageru, kureru, morau portion?  Where were the counters?  I studied all these.  They were in the two chapters that were supposed to be on the test.  Yes life is not fair.  But this time around I promised myself to make this freakin test MINE!  I worked so hard, and I got nothing to show for it.  I should have slept, would have been worth the time.  I at least wouldn't feel so disappointed in myself and my time here.  

This teacher is worthless...  and that's being nice."

"event","It seems second year is a time consumer.  It is leaps and bounds harder than first year, and mostly due to our main teachers inability to give tests that accurately evaluate our knowledge.  My last test... a 66%.  A 66!  And that's hardly the worst grade in the class.  The class average was a 75.  It has been for the last three tests.  On top of this they tell us constantly that we need to go out and experience things, but I have no time at all if I am to keep this up.  I plan to take pictures of the city next time I go to my Monday class.  If it's a clear day you will get to see some really cool mountains.  I gotta go back to memorizing kanji, vocab, readings, and new grammar forms.  Just figured I would update."

"event","Well, I can say I'm glad I retook first year over before I took second year.  I guess it would be so bad if we had Aizawa sensei again.  I am able to grasp second year Japanese this time around even though we are working at a heavily excelerated rate.  Times have been very busy.  At first I thought I would like our new teacher, and the other two not-so-much.  But it turns out our main teacher is more than tough.  On vocab quizes, we don't get tested on the vocabulary.  Instead we get each week a pamplet of copied pages with example sentences with the vocabulary in them.  You might think this is a great idea, but it's not.  The example sentences often use kanji we haven't learned yet, use structures that trick you into using the wrong words, and the example sentences are only semi similar to what we receive on the actual quiz.  On top of this we have kanji quizes almost as often as vocab.  She has quite literally pulled out a magnifying class to show students why they received .1,.2,or more off.  Most of our quizes and tests we get knickle and dimed to death.  This teacher also takes it as a personal afront to herself if you do not fully understand something, as if you didn't study.  She has a way of making you feel bad for everything, and in class continually interrupts you midsentences.  She also gets upset if everyone isn't; ""genki"", meaning every day participating in class as much as possible, while she beats you like the gaijin you are mentally.  On top of all this, the daily grades are already unfair.  It is impossible for anyone to receive a 4.0 for the day, and almost as hard to get 3.8.  On average I get 3.2.  This might seem ok to some, but it is almost failing in her eyes.  She also will not allow you to ask a question in English if you ask to use it.  It was ok in Aizawa sensei's class, but at the level we are at now where we must describe things in Japanese it is very tough since you might not understand the description either.  Don't even get me started about the tests.  Many students have expressed concern about this, and the fact that she doesn't really teach you at all.  I heard about this last semester too, but it is all in the JCMU way.  There is nothing we can do about it, so we just plod on.  On the up note, I have a Japanese conversation partner.  I like our other two teachers.  It is much different when we have them.  They explain, review, practice, and all that fun stuff that goes into actual teaching.  They make class time fun and interesting, and do not mentally beat us when we don't understand something fully.  They also don't treat us like Kindergarden children.  Several students are starting to hate the Japanese language because of our class.  I have been trying my best to teach myself when we have the first teacher.  Sometimes it doesn't work when the book doesn't have every example given.  Weekends are sometimes catch-up days for us, but mainly we try to get rid of the pressure and stress of the previous week.  The first test I got a 76%, this was just a little bit higher than the class average.  The next test I tried extremely hard; now knowing the test format, feeling really good about it... yet still I received a 76%.  It was a bit discouraging, I was .1,.2,.3'd to death.  Most students don't even use kanji, and I have been told this was the tactic of students last year to avoid getting a bad grade.  This should not be how it is.  Why make us hate kanji?  Dooley does just fine, kanji is his strong point.  I some how got branded a person able to speak Japanese, which surprised me, until friends hung around me while I spoke to my conversation partner.  I get nervous during that time, because I don't want to say anything wrong.  It seems easier with day to day people we speak with.  Without stress or worry, the mental block on a secondary language seems to disappear.  I'm trying to destress while I am here in Japan.  I know I have many things to not look forward to when I return home.  All I can think of is that I will do my best to not buckle under the weight of my past.  Sorry that I don't have any pictures.  I have been way too busy to take the time to take them.  My night class on Mondays is ok.  I could go into a completely new story about the strange British teacher we have there, and how he repeatedly makes references to his experiences in Britain which have no bearing in class.  I have not received my box in the mail yet.  Ran out of peanut butter today, no more toast for me ; _ ; .  This semester I have been learning many new things.  I think I have learned more from tv than our main teacher.  About 75% of the time now I can do my homework without looking up, and still understand what is going on.  Well it's about time for me to get back to my studying.  

Until then...

"event","So I'm back...  and everyone is yelling at me to update.  I didn't know I was so popular ; P.  So anyways I haven't taken any cool new pictures yet.  Sorry.  Everything here at JCMU is as it should be, under false pretenses of professionalism.  At least the staff seems to be making the effort to be better this semester.  My new roommate's name is Clint.  He is pretty cool in different ways than Dylan.  He is a third year student.  We are learning tons of new things in second year, and it's been fun so far.  My second class is on Japanese Popular Culture, and it's at Shiga University.  JCMU is under construction at the moment.  They are scraping off the rust on the roof and repainting it.  Also at the moment our halls stink because they are putting up new wall paper every where.  We had to return our big table... ;_;  I got here just fine, but I need to find out how to send things home via the front office.  I also need to find out how to contact customs if I want to send things home that are from Japan.  Always something new to learn.  One of our space heaters has kicked the bucket, I might have to ask Karen for a new one.  Not that she'll go get it, but at least I will get the privledge of going and getting it myself and keeping the recept for reembursement.  We found out how to get to the old book store via the super secret OHMI train line.  Needless to say I have been getting my exercise.  My back and leg still hurt, but not nearly as imbareable as it was last semester.  I am running our of shower products...  even though I thought I was set.  I also forgot to bring mexican spices for dinners.  It's been about two weeks since I went grocery shopping, so maybe this weekend I will do that.  It is kinda funny watching the new students here clump together and go about doing things.  This semester I think will be a bit more quiet, and more school orientated.  I plan on traveling to Tokyo and Nara this time around.   Since I have been here I went to Viva city, the old book store, did the student guided tour, lots and lots of home work, studying, gaming, and tons of attempts to socialize with newbs to no avail.  So now I pretty much hang out in my room till I can find a nice pattern for this semester.  It's nice to be back in Japan.  I will certainly miss it.  Most of us do miss our last semester friends, but we are making due.  Our last Friday project was the cooking thing again, but it was different food at least.  This Friday project is the koto, but not the shamisen this time around.  This time we get to play on drums which should be cool.  I don't have to worry about my Gaijin Card, or return Visa stamp.  Dooley and I signed up for conversation partners.  There is no snow on the ground, and the weather changes alot.  It's fun to see the new people talk about their experiences here, and I can't wait for them to travel outside Hikone... if they ever do.  On our free time we have been running around checking out new places or ways of travel.  I certainly have a better understanding of Japanese than I did when I was in second year in America.  Well without further adue...  here are some pics of all the figures I have amassed so far!  Totemo kawaii da na!

I also happened to find the ever elusive product that allows one to watch your PSP on the tv.  This thing I don't think is in American yet.  Now I can watch all my movies on something not so tiny.  Enjoy!"

"event","This just in from the drama fest here at JCMU.  The afore mentioned director got a lil drunk last night.  Nothing wrong with this.  Rumor has it that he mingled with the students.  Last night around 12pm or so Paul and Coleman came up and told me.  I also heard this from two other friends.  Nothing is completely confirmed, and even if I was there, the director seems like the type of guy to lie to save his own arse... and to hell with us.  So you think drinking with the students is over the line?  How about putting your hands around a students throat and telling them not to fuck with you?  All this over a ""mandatory"" meeting.  From what I hear it took a student(s) to break up the situation.  I know more, but I am leaving out names involved.  This has certainly gone to far.  Thank whatever angel looking over my shoulder I didn't go to the party last night or have to get my alien registeration the day of the meeting.  Once again there aren't any students going to do anying about it accept maybe one.  Most are affraid because some have to continue on to the next semester.  Others don't think Japan will do anything about it.  If MSU were aware of this... God only knows what would/wouldn't happen.  I would rather have a director who couldn't speak Japanese and was fit for his/her station.  YOU DO NOT LAY A FINGER ON A STUDENT MUCH LESS DRINK WITH THEM.  Hell, I asked Aizawa sensei to come out with us for a drink.  He is the coolest teacher in the world, and we wanted to ask him how to say things while we were out at some quiet bar.  If he told us no, and he is Japanese.  Then the same should follow true for American faculty who KNOW American laws.  

I also want to say that I know some of you must think we are doing something to provoke this behavior from him.  You are dead wrong.  All of us have been responsible in every action taken.  I have never seen such a bad situation where all of the students act in appropriate manor even when drinking... more than I can say for a non-student here."

"event","This is a ""memorandum"" from the Resident Director who has several times acted in a manor unbecoming of his station, but don't take my word for it.  This is a memorandum to several students who did not attend one of several ""mandatory"" meetings about fire safety.  Mind you we are all adults.  Accidents happen.  People who missed could have been informed afterwards.  The students of JCMU were informed of the meeting the day of it's occurance.  The students who were unable to attend already planned ahead to go to Otsu and get their reentry visa.  Several of these students also had papers to finish that day, and possibly a class to attend.  All in all, yes the students did not attend a ""mandatory"" meeting, but was this memo giving in the best light becoming a DIRECTOR of Residence?  Check it out:

""Perhaps none of you know the meaning of mandatory, but you blew off a mandatory meeting and the JCMU administration, which is responsible for you from your arrival until you leave at the end of the program, do NOT take it lightly.  You are able to be here because of years of hard work by a great many people, including the present faculty and staff.  When you are called to a meeting by those people, you can never have anything to do that is more important.  For those of you returning next sememster, this is a warning miss another meeting and you will be sent packing, no refunds, no credits.  Understood?""

--Resident Director Jeffery Johnson

This ""memorandum"" was posted on each of the students doors for all to see.  Not put in their mail boxes.  Once before we had a ""mandatory"" meeting about internet usage.  The same Resident Director proclaimed in a clearly childish manor that the night before he had unplugged everyone from the network.  This was because he was not receiving internet.  Someone had unplugged his ethernet cord from the hub.  Now no one should have unplugged or touched the hub.  This has happened to my roomate before.  But does this excuse his actions?  When someone made light of the situation, he again childishly intoned that he could just take the internet away.  Just because we are in Japan, out of the reach from MSU, we do not need to be treated as children.  We have not given him a reason to do such.  I am 27 years old.  With proper training and experience, someone my age could be in his position.  He is the English representative of this organization.  Not once has he shown us as a whole publicly a form of respect.  I have further encouters with our ""friendly"" resident director who translated Japanese to English for us on a field trip to Matsushita Co. for MoTI.  Needless to say it was less than professional.  Don't even get me started with what little help we do receive here at JCMU.  The best I could do was voice my oppinion on the evaluation sheet.  From what I hear not everyone took the time to stand up and voice what they wanted to say. 

To make a long story short.  I was not on the receiving end of the ""maturity"" of our Resident Director Jeffery Johnson.  Some say he is a Doctor, PhD apparently doesn't mean you also have public relation skills. I still have a semester, and it is my hope that I can avoid any and all further encouters with the American faculty.

Good Day."

"event","Well here we are folks.  It's December 7th.  Nine days left till I return home.  We had our first snow a day or two ago.  I finished my paper for the Japanese course.  Tonight we are finishing our paper for MoTI and doing the power point.  The presentation for MoTI is this Thursday.  The presentation for Japanese is Saturday.  After that all we have are the finals.  Those will be a piece of cake compared to this week.  I have been so glad I retook the first year.  I seem to understand everything this time around.  That about the ammount of bad grades coming out of third year students stuns me.  The third years are having a tough time of it.  Between the Japanese teaching style and having to explain new vocabulary only in Japanese makes it almost beyond difficult for them.  We got chewed out in first year yesterday.  The majority of the class did not memorize the dialogue.  An American professor would have understood, but they are unrelenting here.  Luckily I was prepared, but I still felt bad.  Today I don't have to be in class till 10:15.  I might go to Cainz to get my hair cut and check out the Denkiya (electronic store).  This weekend I might head to Kyoto again, but I have a feeling most of us will end up having a big party Saturday night.  Saturday morning we have our presentations in Japanese.  They told us first years we didn't need to use visual aids, but at the last minute they changed their minds.  I have a feeling the memorization part will get changed too.  They really need to work on getting their shite together here at JCMU.  Only good thing to come out of all this so far in the administration is Aizawa Sensei.  We got our room cleaned up, and I put up the final Xmas decorations.  I think I really need to relax a bit when I get home.  When they say intensive, they mean it.  I would hate to see what the summer program is like, and I almost did come here during the summer program!  Once again, everything happens for a reason.  Still contemplating what to get people as a COOL souvineer (omiyage) from Japan.  I'm on my final book for the Wheel of Time series.  I hope I have enough left for the plane ride home.  I also hope I can upgrade my seat for the ride home...  I seem to remember the plane ride here being particularly unpleasant.  It's pretty cold in the dorms here.  Heat doesn't last!  I wonder if they believe in insulation.  It's a wonder they survive.  In the fall I saw may Japanese people proclaiming it cold.  I thought it was GREAT fall weather, and even now in Michigan we might call this fall.  Maybe if Japanese people had more than -5% body fat they could exist a lil more.  I still have to contemplate what I want to bring home this sememster.  I know I am going to leave most of my shoes here.  I have to decide if I am tossing or taking my books home.  My laundry took awhile to dry.  I know I can leave a good amount of my stuff here, though I hope I get back before my new roomate does.  Don't want them getting here and going through everything.  I bought 4 art books in Kyoto, they seem to be a bit more informative than the ones I have at home.  That is saying alot since I can't really read the ones here LOL.  Currently I am looking toward the future.  Morgan made an Anime con this year.  I am hoping to get my act together by November of next year.  I want to be sitting in the artist alley, and get this thing on the road.  I need to get a good sized portfolio goin, and a web comic under my belt.  How knows, I might become all L337 on the internet.  That would rock.  I don't want to get stuck in the manga medium, but hey if it gets me off the ground all the better.  Also there was a guest professor here at JCMU he was in town from Tokyo I think.  He is a CAD/engineer professor at Eastern Michigan.  He was talking about starting a game design class at EMU.  Oh man!  That would be something else.  To be good at Japanese, a degree in art, with experience in music and game design.  Who wouldn't want a person like me in the industry? 

Well I have some more things to study...

"event","Well things seem to be truck'n along.  We all have been pretty busy, but Paul and Dylan say they will come with me on Friday to Otsu.  We might go to some city and do a lil shopping, who knows.  I'll have to remember to take my camera.  Seems like over the weekend everyone got hit with the ""It's almost time to go home"" jitters.  Today in class everyone was kinda off the wall and responding with random Japanese back at the teacher.  For example we are learning explaination forms for things and polite suggestions and the like.  It's more of refresher for me.  So the teacher gives us an example, like ""I have no friends..."" and we are expected to give suggestions.  ""You better..."" and ""You must..."".  Well he got back in reply ""You should die..."" ""You should go to the red light district"" ""You should drink too much alcohol"" and the like.  We were all lauhing each hour, nothing like the coined phrases from Aizawa sensei of ""Gramma (grammar) ok, sentence wa chouto.""  Or ""Kurasu de warui nihongo o tsukawanai houga ii desu you."" (You shouldn't use bad Japanese in class).  Aizawa sensei has always been alot of fun, mixed with just enough seriousness to keep us on track.  This Thursday I have another case study due for MoTI, and the Friday project is individual sessions with Aizawa sensei about our papers on our Japanese Presentation.  Soon we will have to start the MoTI presentation and paper.  Most likely this weekend we will put a large dent into the project.  All in all things have been going better than expected.  I'm off to bed.

Oyasumi!"

I was rather ill feeling, and no one was on AIM to talk to...  everyone came back with cool stories/pictures/and cool souveniers.  I missed out on probably the single most coolest thing to do while I am here.  I didn't go to Tokyo or Nara.  I didn't see any temples or cool technology or crazy goth chicks or random domestic deer or buy kimono's or the million anime stores.  Nor did I study as much as I planned to.  I did take medicine.  I cleaned the apartment, and slept alot.  I feel horrible because I missed out on the one chance I had to buy everyone cool things from Japan for xmas.  We have three weeks left.  We really haven't gone out much, it's been alot of studying.  It's really late, and I should go to bed.  Even if I did go, I would not have found clothes that would fit me.  I really need to get home and go to a chiro.  I still need to go to Otsu.  Maybe next semester I will get to go to Tokyo.

In the room pics you can see the huge wooden table we theived for get togethers.  Nevermind all the bottles in the background.  Our place has become relatively popular because we have da tunes, osake, and you are able to smoke.  This is important as it gets colder and colder outside.

"event","Seems we have finally become used to Japan.  None of my normal friends are going out today.  I am finding myself not having the desire to go out either.  Well, I want to go out... but I don't know what to do really.  I am enjoying the weather.  The dishes are done.  My clothes are all clean but two pairs of pants and some extras.  The apartment is relatively clean.  We have food all over.  I am not in the drawing mood, and I am almost finished with my book.  I'll do all my homework sometime tonight and look into future studies.  My laptop has been acting up lately.  So I cleaned up my files and ran some virus scans.  Our internet here really is starting to suck.  My home page times out.  I don't have any new pictures... sorry.  I am well slept.  Guess there isn't much else to do but be a good student and finish all my work before Sunday.  It's too early for anyone to be on AIM.  I deleted Itunes and picked up the new version of WinAmp.  Cleaned up most of my music files.  I think I might stretch out, and do some exercises.  I need to find something to eat in Japan that isn't all out fattening or disgusting to look at little loan eat.  Been trying to talk to new people, today seems lazy for everyone.  Must be the weather.  But we all know that I am not the cold one here.  It's odd that when time slows down and I get to thinking, I wonder why I am not thinking that I want to be home.  It's like I am home, but have nothing to do... and this confuses me.  If I were home, I would be wondering what people were doing.  Maybe it's because I am so far away.  Who knows.  I'm downloading a ton of JPop music videos to better understand their pop culture.  The deeper you delve into Japan, the more questions pop up that go unanswered.  Some of these people lead very strange lives.  If they only knew what kind of lives we lead in America.  I don't think they could handle such freedom... I don't think we can handle all the freedom's we still have.  :laughs:  The world is a very strange place indeed.  No matter how much communication improves, I don't think we (the world) will ever be able to break down all barriers.  ""I wish for good health to all puppies, and World Peace.""  There is a better chance for puppies... well... maybe not.  Some countries dig on dogs.  So I guess both are equally unlikely.  I have almost filled up my external hard drive with random movies and such.  I used up my pumpkin candle.  It was very nice.  One of the kids in my class ended up going home, or so the rumor goes.  She wasn't really trying at all in class.  We don't know what she was thinking, taking an intensive language course in Japan.  Ah well, it's just ashame since I know there were people on a list wanting to come here.  Makes you think.  

Funny note of the week:  
You would be surprised at home many people in Japan don't know what a ferret is.  They always ask me if it is like a hampster.  Too funny.

Peace out all you Michiganders... and others who I was surprised read my LJ"

"event","So here I am in my MoTI class.  Most of us bring our laptops into class.  I got an A- on my midterm.  Go me.  The weather is unbelievablely nice out.  We finally got into short form in our Japanese class.  This improves some basic conversational skills.  Well, I have studied all this before, but it is a nice review.  On Tuesday I went to Kyoto with Don.  He didn't want to go alone.  So I went with him to meet some Japanese girls.  No biggie.  I was just there because that is the Japanese way of things.  I'm the ""third wheel"" so to speak.  Just their to make them feel better, but in all reality they ended up talking alone.  This situation was interesting because both girls like Don.  So they are kind of skirting the issue in typical Japanese fashion, because they both like him.  I think I might get my hair cut today.  I don't really need it, but I don't know when I will go to Cainz again.  This semester seems to be approaching a close.  The days go by very fast, and yet it seems long because I still have a semester to go.  I miss everyone, yet I am not so homesick.  More so I just miss people, but America not so much.  I would like to be back with my actual friends.  Sometimes things get really frustrating with some of the current students attending JCMU, but it happens.  I have decided to take a step further into Japanese culture by checking out some of their popular music.  Seems as though Hikone's weather is being just as fickle as Michigan.  Two days ago it was pretty cold.  I might purchase a large scarf at Beisha today.  Should be in season now.  I want to say that I am really surprised there are so many people who read my live journal.  I am really sorry I have not kept it up to date.  If you want to post on my LJ you don't need to be a member.  All you have to do is click on comment on this post, but when you post please leave your name."

"event","I'm talking to several Japanese people online and through email.  This last weekend Justin, Dylan, and I went to Kyoto which was alot of fun.  We ate at Wendy's, and went to a bar called Dylan's II.  I haven't taken any pictures lately.  Nothing really new to capture.  Japanese is moving along.  I have a midterm in my MoTI class on Thursday.  (Management of Technology and Innovation).  We purchased a coffee maker for like $8.  It was on uber sale.  People have been super jealous of the ammount of boxes I have been receiving.  Our cupboard is pretty much full.  I received the shower stuff just in time.  The other JCMU students have been slowly finding out we have American candy.  There is a holloween party this Friday.  There will be about 100 kids varying in age up to 10 years old.  After this party there will be a party for us and some older students (more our age), but this will only go from 6:30 till 7:30.  JCMU never really plans enough time for these events.  I need to do my laundry tomorrow.  The water in the area I am in seems to be a bit hard... and it is showing.  Next time I am in Kyoto I will take alot of pictures.  The buildings are unbelievable, and I might take a video of the cross walk music.  It is the exact music in most anime's.  I have set out my plastic pumpkin in the ""living"" room so people can snack.  I used up most of my minutes on my phone card talking to Jenna.  We are about to start a DnD campaign soon.  I think next time we go out, we might go to Viva City which is an entertainment district.  I have gradually been trying to piece together what Pachinko Parlor's are all about.  JAPANESE TV HURTS MY BRAIN!  I am currently helping Dylan and David study for the vocab quiz tomorrow.  Yes I know it is late.  I have been learning some new conversational vocab when we go to Mariy's on Friday nights.  Okawari is another.  This is used for asking for another drink that is the same.  I am sure it has other uses... but I think it literally means ""Another"", instead of using Onaji... which used by itself means ""same"".  I also learned Supai, Umai, and amai which are sour, bitter, and sweet.  We have made good friends with the bartenders of Mariy's.  They now have free food for us when we go.  I have tried some really strange food.  I bought a new bike.  It was super cheap from Cainz.  This means I do not have to wear a helmet since I am not riding a ""JCMU"" bike.  It's really nice.  I have realized that my current activity level, albiet more than normal, is not enough to keep weight off me.  So I am going to try in the morning to get up early to do more.  I also have decided to stop eating out with the guys till we are low on groceries.  I turned in my information last week to obtain my alien registration card.  I need to pick it up between 11/4 and 11/10.  After that, I must go to Otsu to pick get my multiple entry visa.  In my room, I have been enjoying my pumpkin candle from Christine.  Last Friday we got to play some Japanese stringed instruments.  Now that I am used to being in Japan, days seem to fly by.  There certainly is nothing like living in a different country.  I can never comment enough on the fact that things will be much different for me once I get home.  I have watched Unleashed and Batman begins recently.  

Well that is pretty much that for now.  I really should catch a nap before class.  I was told to update, so here ya go ; P!~"

"event","If there ever was a reason for me to want to be back home...  it is not because of the way Japanese people are.  We had a pretty fun time last night.  It was fun for me right up until David decided he had enough Osake in him to tell me ""You act like our den mother.""  I can see that.  The age difference/difference in upbringing has become apparent.  Forgive me if I don't wanna feed the impression even more into Japanese people that we are loud/annoying American's.  What is the one thing that is on almost all hand books and letter we received before coming here?  ""Please understand that you are in Japan now, and be respectful of their culture.""  So YES, I am embarressed when we ride in a taxi and my friends are so drunk that they are screaming ""Fuck you"" out the window.  Or when we are in a restaurant and all eyes are on us NOT souly because we are foriegners but because we are talking loud enough for the cooks to hear us in the back room.  David seems to think they find this amusing.  Maybe so, but in the right way?  Yes I like to have fun, but do I have to be rude about it?  Do I have to be that guy?  I spoke with a few Japanese about this situation, and they expressed that this is not good behavior.  It is just that.  HELL I bet I could ask the bartenders and they would agree as well.  I know the owner of Mariy's agrees.  Late that night, most everyone else with me had drank to much.  Even one of the bartender's drank too much.  Mostly due to the fact we fed her shots of vodka till she passed out in the alley.  That pretty much shot the night.  It was amusing, but hey... it's all in good fun right?  The response I got is that he is not going to give in completely to someones culture.  What?  Where is the harm in being respectful?  Maybe it's our age difference, but god damn.  You can be American, but it doesn't mean you have to be an ass about it.  So this is my big clue that obviously I am not wanted around.  I could just remain quiet about the issue and hang out... but I don't think that will be enough because they will know when I am quiet I disapprove of the situations.  So it looks like I am going to become one of those people who are a herit in their room.  Suck.  Ah well... you live and you learn.  Or in some cause... you live and you keep making the same mistakes.  On a brighter note, here are some pictures of when the night was fun.  I also took alot of video of karaoke.

Sorry for acting like your ""Den Mother"" guys.  All I have to say is... if you were acting appropriately, why did your actions piss off Don?  He is American too.  I may be right I may be wrong.  But there is always a better way to go about things.  Even if I were completely plastered I know when to conduct myself accordingly.  Hell I could be plastered and still speak Japanese.  Just a thought..."

"event","Today it is lightly raining out and the air is cool, just the way I like it.  Yesterday night I rearranged my room again.  After class today, I went to Al Plaza to meet with Suu-san.  We ate lunch at a chinese restaurant upstairs.  From about 12:30 to 3:00 we talked/discussed things in Japanese/English.  She is very easy going like me.  It is nice to speak to someone more my age in Japan.  Though mostly we talk about differences in culture, I think with age there is some better understanding.  Most of the students here at JCMU are about 22.  Some younger, some older.  Other than one student, I am the oldest here at the Michigan Center.  When I got back after eating lunch with Suu-san, I met with my Sensei.  I feel really bad, because when we go out in public we are some what used to using Japanese short form.  This is much different than what you would use when talking to your teacher.  For example:  Hai is formal, and un is informal.  Desu at the end of a sentence, compared to not using it.  We do not receive a grade when we speak with our teacher, but I feel bad for having a hard time switching out of short form.  Well, I think I am going to take a nap and get up a little later to read some case studies for my Thursday class.  There doesn't seem to be anyone on AIM or MSN, though it is almost 3am in Michigan.

"event","Today I ran into my Japanese PenPal at Cainz mall.  She is pretty nice, if a bit shy... but who am I kidding.  I'm am very shy, especially using Japanese.  We only talked for about 10 minutes before she decided she was intruding on our grocery shopping.  So we went to the Denshiya and I picked up a laptop cooler, because it has been acting kinda funny.  I then made a list and gave it to Dylan while I went to get my hair cut.  I was doing pretty well at describing how I wanted my hair cut, but the workers called the owner in.  She spoke broken English at first.  I have noticed this habit when they tell you they only speak a little English.  Really they are just as scared as us to use someone's native language.  The cut turned out perfect.  We then went to leave, but there were no taxi's outside.  There were no phones around so I went back to ask the Stylist owner if she could call a taxi.  We then got into a discussion about cell phones and how I was trying to find out for my friends how to get a prepay cell phone.  She then left her store and took me down to the shop where she translated for me.  It was REALLY helpful of her.  I found out that one must have their Alien Registration card to get a cell phone.  They  also have a pamphlet (sp?) that was in English.  I thanked her heartily.  Tomorrow Suuchan and I are going to go to Al Plaza and eat at the Chinese restaurant.  She is going to help me finish my Alien Registration, and register at City Hall (which I hear is very difficult).  She told me that when we meet she would be more serious about teaching me Japanese.  Hopefully I will learn more of the ""normal"" dialogue usages in common everyday speech.  We sometimes speak over MSN.  Now we have got in a habit of correcting each others speech patterns.  Her English is about the same as my knowledge of Japanese, or so I think.  Today Dylan and I cleaned the apartment.  Well Dylan did most of the work.  I was talking to Suuchan, trying to piece out when we would have time to practice our languages since we decided that typing does not help as much as actually speaking.  The apartment appear to not have been cleaned for several semesters.  We mopped the floors, cleaned the bathroom, washed our windows, and the kitchen.  Everything smells much nicer now.

Well that was my day... I already finished tomorrows homework yesterday.  Every since I have been meeting new people I have been trying to study ahead to refresh my memory.

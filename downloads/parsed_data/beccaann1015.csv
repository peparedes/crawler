I still have strong feelings for Eric, I think about him a lot..but there's still that thing in the back of my head that says, is it worth it to get back together? Would we be happy like we were before? Would it last through the summer when I'm gone? Does he trust me? Do I trust myself? Thats the big one, do i trust myself.

We'll have to see....I need time to figure things out.

Eric is what I want, but I don't know if I want it right now...why did I have to meet him so soon, couldn't have waited til I wanna get married and shit, could it? He's the guy I can see myself with in the long-run..but I don't wanna do something stupid in the short-run."

I don't even really know how to explain what happened...I'm stupid and we don't think that we'll be able to figure things out and be back to how we felt before this in the month I have left here. Then I'm back at home and things would just be even more complicated again.  I got drunk with the girls last night and smoked like a pack of cigarettes, but I know nothing is gonna get rid of the shitty feeling right now.

I need to go to work-study because I am broke, but call me or write me if you wanna try to help cheer me up."

I still feel like shit...went to Nurse Carol today and told her what I remember of Saturday night. She said i could have low blood sugar b/c i barely ate yesterday...or could be dehydrated...or i could have caught something else b/c so many people here are sick...and she told me to lay low and come back tomorrow b/c if I don't feel better she's going to make me go to a doctor.

I want my best friends to be with me...I want to be at home.

I seriously feel incredibly lucky to have found him.  I found a keeper...and everyone that has seen us together knows that.

Oh, and by the way....I didn't smoke at all yesterday....and today I felt like I needed one, so I started to smoke it and I didn't like it.  Maybe this quitting thing could actually work this time.

I am so excited for the cruise...my mom called me like 3 times today trying to get stuff set up for it...and my brother finally let my mom take him shopping...God I can't wait to wear all my new stuff and it's gonna be a blast being away from it all....just gonna suck not seeing Eric for 10 days....damn what am I gonna do this summer?

Things with Eric are going really well.  I don't know how I am gonna go like 10 days without seeing him over spring break.  Oh well, I guess i'll have to deal, nothing i can do about it.

I am too insecure, you know that?  I don't know why I question him so much...if he drives that far to see me all the time then he obviously likes me, if he talks to me all the time like he does, then he must, right?

I think it's b/c i've dealt with guys that have been like that before, Steve for example...you STL people know what I'm talking about.  Spend all your time with someone, talk to them all the time, and everything, even fucking go to prom together, and I still somehow get screwed over. I don't really think Eric is like that, but I've also said that about people before.

"event","So Eric just left me a little bit ago...he came out here last night after he got off work.  When we were laying in bed last night he asked me how I felt about him, and he already knows how I feel about him, but I think he just wanted me to reassure him, because then he decided to ask me if I wanted to make things official between us.  I haven't had a boyfriend since before my senior year...I mean, I've dated guys, I've dated too many guys in the past year and a half, but haven't been anyone's girlfriend until last night.  I haven't had anyone make me feel this good about myself and it is obvious that he isn't in it just to get a piece of ass...he is content just being with me and he loves to cuddle with me, which makes me really happy as well.  I hope everything goes well.

I get to go home next weekend and I am really excited. Brittyn is gonna go with me, which is awesome...we've been hanging out a lot lately and I love it. I don't think she had a very good night last night, but Brittyn, if you read this, I care about you and you can talk to me anytime you want...you weren't in the way or intruding or anything...I invited you, so I wanted you with us.

Sure, I have my really high times, like last night just playing around and having fun with Jessy and all that blog crap I put on here, but otherwise I feel like shit.  I get really moody sometimes and snap.  I think sometimes people should know what I'm thinking and how I am feeling, but they don't, and they don't have the power to do that.

I gave up sex for lent.  I know that may be really easy for some people, but it is sort of difficult for me.  I have gotten to the point where I feel like sex isn't a big deal anymore, but it really is, and I know that. 

I know some of you have never read my poetry, and those of you who have haven't read it in a while, so here goes...let me know what you think.

Tears

So little and fragile 
but a lot of meaning and debt 
Trickles of clear liquid stream down 
leaving your plush cheeks softly wet 
Wiped away like its breezed by the wind, 
in the tissue it is kept 
You can hold in the rage 
but you know what happens next 
There's no way they can be held 
whether from happiness, sadness or fear 
If the feeling deeply takes over you... 
Silently come tears"

You love toasted ravioli with Budweiser beer.

""Vacation"" is a choice between Silver Dollar City and Lake of the Ozarks.

You can find Pestalozzi Street by aroma alone.

You can get anywhere in 20 minutes, except on highway 40.

You can debate for 30 minutes whether Missouri Baking or Marge Amighetti makes the best Italian bread.

You know what ""Party Cove"" is, and where the ""lake"" is.

You still can't believe the Arena is gone.

Your first question to a new person is, ""Where did you go to High School?""

Your non-St. Louisan friends always ask if you're aware there is no ""r"" in ""wash.""

You know at least one person who's gotten hurt at Johnson Shut-ins.

You know in your heart that Mizzou can beat Nebraska in football.

You think the four major food groups are Beef, Pork, Budweiser and Imo's.

You know there are really only three salad dressings: Imo's, Zia's and Rich and Charlie's.

You'll pay for your kid to go to college unless they want to go to KU.

You would rather have a root canal without anesthetic than drive on Manchester on a Saturday afternoon.

It just doesn't seem like a wedding without mostaciolli. AND YOU PRONOUNCE IT 'MUSKACHOLLI'. The balance of the menu is ham, boiled roast beef, string beans with ham and of course pitchers of Busch Bavarian (class weddings have Bud)

You know, within a three-mile radius, where another St. Louisan grew up as soon as they open their mouth.

You know what a Pork Steak is...and what kind of sauce to put on it!

Everyone in your family has floated the Meramec River at least once.

A hoosier is someone that lives just south of Chouteau, not a person from Indiana.

You have made fun of Mike Shanahan and tried to imitate him ordering another cold, frosty Busch Bavarian Beer.

You have listened to Mike's broadcast on KMOX, while watching the game on TV and wonder what game he is watching. A tear forms in your eye as someone mentions their favorite Jack Buck story.

You've said, ""It's not the heat, it's the humidity.""

Your favorite summer treat is handed to you upside-down

You bleed Blue between September and May

Anyway...Stephanie sent me an IM the other night when I was away from the computer and made me cry...think it was one of the nicest things anyone has ever said to me: 

(Her Screen Name Here): just wanted to drop you a little note letting you know how much you mean to me. Today at my chapter meeting, we had to go around a say a quote or something about why we are thankfull for Delta Gamma. The quote that I gave was ""a friend is someone who you want to be around when you feel like being by yourslef."" you are that person. Last week when I was having a bad day, i really just wanted to be alone, but I called you and you made everything better, because you are you. All of the upperclassmen tonite said things about the friendships they have made, and they will never have such good friends. There were all of these quotes about sisterhood and everything, and you were the friend I thought about, not the 90 other girls who are technically my sisters. Someone gave a quote about these are the sisters that God forgot to give us at birth. No matter what...you will always be my sister. I miss you so much, and it is soo hard to be here, going through so much and not having you with me to share it all with. You are the best!

So, I dunno what else to say...I just got high with Jessy and our new pipe...haha...Cooper's stops selling pipes after Feb.10, so if anyone wants one I'll give you directions...I think Jessy and I are gonna go again right before it closes, cuz they should be cheaper.

Liz got me a 5th of Smirnoff Raspberry Vodka and I drank almost the whole thing on Friday night...went to a party at Reid's place and met one of his roommates, Brad...had some of the best sex I've had in a VERY long time, for me...next morning I woke up to my mom calling at 10 am...she asked if I was up and I said yeah...she told me that she just got off on Wornall, so I jumped up and told him that I needed to get back to the dorms ASAP...my mom called me when we were on our way back, and I had to tell her that I was a street away b/c I crashed at the party last night...that sucked

I had a good time with my mom on Saturday...we went shopping and went to lunch together...then we went to her hotel and took a nap b/c I was dying...Jessy and Liz met us at the hotel and went to dinner with us...my mom wanted to see the lights at the plaza, so I went there with her too.

I woke up Monday morning with strep throat...I had finals monday and tuesday and I couldn't concentrate to study...I couldn't even concentrate to make ramen noodles...I borrowed Brittyn's big bowl and heated the noodles in the microwave, then I took them out and started to stir them and spilled it all over the floor and burnt the shit out of my arm.

I got the chinese symbol for father with MDM, his initials, below it.  I am in a hyper mood right now, playing mah jong and talking to jessy...anyway, send me messages, I get bored."

"event","So this is the worst day I've had in a while.  It seems like everything reminds me of my dad.  It started last night when I realized that tomorrow will be a month since he passed away, then this morning in Comp 2 we were watching a movie and Billy had to tell his wife that he was dying.  I had to leave class because I started to cry and I didn't want to cry in front of the class.  After that I talked to my mom on the phone for a while before my next class.  I don't know what it is, but I have just been edgy since then.  I cry over stupid stuff, like if no one is around me for a few minutes.  Jessy is taking a nap right now b/c she feels like crap, and I went over to the chapel for like 10 minutes and sat there and prayed for God to watch my mom and my brother and I b/c sometimes I feel like I am all alone and I need help to make it through the day.  

I believe that we all have gaurdian angels, they don't necessarily make it so that we don't do ANYTHING wrong, but they help us through the hard times.  Your angel may change from one day to the next.  I think that some days Jessy is my angel, I truly do, I think that's why when we are apart I don't know what to do with myself sometimes.  She has helped me through SO much and I feel like sometimes I don't thank her enough for it.  I love you so much!!!  

I called Stephanie today because I needed someone to calm me down.  She did a good job alright.  A few minutes of talking to her and I was ready to go again.  I can't wait to go home.  The thing that I think is hurting us is that I don't like talking on the phone very much.  I talk to my mom for like 20 minutes everyday, and that's enough for me, but I know that I don't call Steven and Stephanie like I used to, but I think about it and they don't call me as much either, I think it's my fault though.

I am gonna get off here before I start to cry again."

"event","Yesterday was one of the most fun times I've had since I got to Avila.  It was Sarah's birthday and we had a drinkfest.  I haven't been that drunk in a long time.  Amanda is almost here and we're gonna party again.  She needs me to let her in though, so I'll write tomorrow."

"event","So I had to take the link off of my aol im because I started talking to Matthew on there again and he's the one person in the world that I really don't want to read this. I will send everyone the link when I talk to them online, sorry, I really want you guys to read it.

So Matthew called me last night and said that he was on campus and asked if he could stop by. Being me  and still having feelings of some sort for him, I said yes. He stopped by and we didn't really talk a whole lot, just small talk about my mom and stuff and how he's feeling. I gave him the thank you and get well cards that my mom wrote for him. Then he left and we talked online. I asked if I could be honest with him, and he said yes. So I told him that I want to be friends, but i've had stronger feelings for him and it's going to be hard for me to stop and be his friend. He said that's understandable and said that it is going to be hard for him to not want to sleep with me...JACKASS!!! Where did that come from? Did I need to hear that? NO.

I don't know what to do. I am retarded and I know that I shouldn't really care about what he says anymore, but if you have feelings for someone then you just do sometimes and you can't do anything about it. I am trying to move on, I honestly am. Things are going okay with Nick and I like him, but I don't know what's going on with that too. We don't really talk or anything unless it's for like 5 seconds and it's him asking me to come over or something, and I've only gone over there twice. I want someone that wants to talk to me more than that. I miss being in a relationship so much.

Whenever I was at home the week of the funeral Matt, ex-b/f Matt, came over one night. We hadn't talked since his b-day, Oct. 5, and when he called me that night it was SO unexpected since we hadn't talked in a few months. When he came over he just hugged me and didn't say anything. He held me while I cried and it was so nice to have someone holding me and knowing that they still care about me after all we've been through. Hell, be broke up a year and 3 months ago. He said that he still loves me and would still do anything to get me back. I didn't lie to him and say the same thing back, but I felt so good knowing that I mean something to someone. I miss that so much.

Anyway, sorry if I am boring you, but leave me messages...I have to go to class."

"event","So I drove back to school yesterday and got back here around 6. When I got back here I finally wrote that presentation that I said I was gonna work on a while ago. It only took a couple hours. Then I talked to Nick and he asked me to come over. I like this guy, but I don't want to get attached to him too fast. We were talking last night and, well, he is graduating with his business degree in December, and if he can't find a job in the next 2 months then he wants to join the military. I can't be with a military guy. I'm afraid he would get sent away from me, and I can't have anyone else leave me right now after losing my dad.

My mom asked me if I wanted to go to the cemetary yesterday...I can't do that yet. I still think that sometime when I call home my dad is going to answer the phone, like everything was just some sick joke and he's still here. I know that he's in a better place now. I kind of think that God knew that his cancer was going to come back and knew that he wouldn't be able to deal with that well at all, so He took him from us so that everything wasn't even harder later.

Anwyay, I had to give my presentation this morning and I think it went okay...and I have to write another one for ethics tomorrow. Love you guys!"

"event","So I decided Friday morning that I wanted to go home this weekend.  Thursday was a blast hanging out with SO many people at the dorms.  We should have dare night more often! 

I went to dinner last night with my mom and Steven. Mom seems like she doesn't really know what to do with herself a lot of the time anymore. I think I mentioned it in my first entry, but if you are a little out of the loop, my dad passed away on October 16. It's been a very hard few weeks for me recently.

After dinner Steven and I went out to Amanda's house and I felt extremely out of place because I was hanging out with a bunch of high schoolers. You don't realize how much you've changed until you come back and hang out with people that are younger than you. They were so stupid about drinking and shit it was ridiculous. Amanda wasn't going to let me drive back home after I had like 2 Smirnoffs...(like that would get me drunk, or anything)!!!

And if you leave a post I wanna know who you are.

Yeah, Matthew is a d-bag.  He called me on my way home and told me that Anna doesn't want to talk to him anymore...then he proceeded to ask me if I wanted to hook up. Basically he thinks that I am still gonna have sex with him when I think he's an asshole and it's not gonna happen.

Anyway, I didn't work on that presentation last time I said I would, so I am gonna say that I'll do it now."

"event","So this is my first entry and I don't really know where to start.  

I have 5 classes left since freshman seminar has the last day tomorrow, and in each class I have at LEAST one presentation due soon.  I m SO stressed out it's unreal.  

Started smoking like a pack of cigarettes a day because I don't know what to do with myself sometimes.  

My dad passed away on October 16th and I don't really now what to think sometimes.  I miss my mom and my brother at home a lot, but I think it's good for me to be in KC.  My dad and I didn't exactly have the closest relationship...I am closer to my mom...but he's my dad, you know??? I love him.

I met a guy on Halloween weekend...I was a cheerleader...HAHA! Imagine that, me, a cheerleader! His name is Nick and he seems like a really great guy, but don't they all in the beginning?  I hope that things go good, or at least that I don't get hurt TOO bad in the end.  Guys here like to screw me over a lot.  The one I care about most for some reason is Matthew, and I don't know what his deal is...Here, I have an idea...i'll post our convo from yesterday...hold on - 

Him: i feel like shit
Capt83Backfire: sorry....i wish there was something i could do

Him: well im sorry that im an ass
Capt83Backfire: no you aren't
Him: ok well i guess i am
Capt83Backfire: alrighty....should i just leave you alone and not talk to you anymore???
Him: so what i find funny is i have the biggest heart for everyone around me and now thats the one thing that is being taken from me
Capt83Backfire: how do you have a big heart for me??? b/c you came to st.louis??? then when you came back here you go off on me for sleeping with someone when you are dating anna so it doesn't matter
Him: no no no no no......i went off cuz you lied to my face for like 3 weeks
Him: thats what was wrong
Capt83Backfire: b/c i lied to everyone about it....we weren't even talking when it happened and I didn't know he had a g/f and we didn't want to start a big ordeal
Him: well..im glad that im just like everyone else
Capt83Backfire: you aren't, but I didn't want you to hate me
Him: ok
Capt83Backfire: why did you ask me about Spencer??? where the hell did that come from?
Him: nothing
Capt83Backfire: what?
Capt83Backfire: tell me
Him: no its cool
Capt83Backfire: why
Capt83Backfire: what did you hear
Him: nothing...i dont care....im tired of lies
Capt83Backfire: i didn't do anything with him
Capt83Backfire: anyone can tell you that if they really know me
Capt83Backfire: i give up...I cant deal with this shit anymoe
Capt83Backfire: bye

Anyway...he's an ass...he probably thinks I'm an ass...and I am gonna move on.

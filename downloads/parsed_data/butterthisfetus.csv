i'm on my way out.  i'm on my way up.  i'm on my way to clear.  i'm realizing like never before how the word 'thankful' should be defined.  i'm sorry.  yea.  i'm sorry for you, him, her, them, whatever.  i'm not any better.  never have been..whatever.  i'm just right..almost always when i make convictions.  i'm intelligent enough to stay away from situations that i can't control.  and i'm in control.  are you?....<i>are</i> you?  i am.  it feels good.  i'm learning.  so thick with brand new knowledge, i am.  i'm shocked as hell.  i'm down-right startled...and i'm laughing.  honestly..i'm laughing all around.  sort of the way everyone else is laughing....but different...just a little. i'm appreciating the voices of people that i thought i could live without.  i'm worried.  i'm hanging in.  i'm..um.....accepting.  did i already say surprised?  i'm done.  i'm mine.  i'm finishing school.  i'm working.  i'm feeling bad.  i'm almost innocent.  i'm happy..enough.  are you..are <i>you</i>?  perhaps i need not bother.  if you've ever called me impossible...and i had at any point agreed...i'll tell you now....i was wrong right then.  i'm fucking logic wrapped in a bow.  i have bells on.  i miss you.  god, i miss you.  i smell you, i need you, i want you.  i'm tired.  i'm killing lazy.  loving plans.  loving winning.  loving reality.  loving snow, cars, roads, and everything in between.  i love you, and you..and you..and you too.  thank you...to you..and you...and all that stuff.  maybe things are as they should be.  maybe everyone has ironically...met their match."

<h2>Your Power Color Is Gold</h2>
You're dependable and hard working. You never miss a deadline - and you're never late.
You have a clear sense of right and wrong. You're very detail oriented.
You get frustrated when your friends are sloppy - or when they don't follow through.
You're on top of things, and you wish that everyone else was!

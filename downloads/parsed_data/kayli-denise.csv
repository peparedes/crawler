She likes adventure with security
And more than one man can provide
She planned adventure feeling sure that he
Would not be home 'till after five
He turned on the lights and turned them off again
And said the one thing he could say

All these years
Where have I been
Well I've been down the rode to work and home again
And I'm still here
Untill I'm gone
Don't you rub it in too hard that I've been wrong
All these years

She said, ""You're not the man you used to be""
He said, ""Neither is this guy""
She said, ""There's some things you refuse to see
But I guess sometimes so do I""
She made no excuse why she was lying there
She said the one thing she could say

All these years
What have I done
I made your supper and your daughter and your son
Still I'm here
And still confused
But I can finally see how much I stand to lose
All these years

I'm still here
And so confused
But I can finally see how much I stand to lose

So why is Jermel in the back of my mind?&nbsp; He hurt me so much, emotionally and physically, I'll never be the same person I was before him.&nbsp; I went into that relationship knowing I could have my pick of guys and was sure about myself.&nbsp; Here I am not even a year later, and I'm probably the most insecure girl here, sleeping with guys because it makes me feel wanted, very subconcious, really wanted to be loved again, but scared to death.&nbsp; Now I have Ben and I'm going back and forth. ONe day I'm my old self and I KNOW he loves me, the next I'm worried he's going to cheat or change his mind.&nbsp; But back to Jermel- I miss the little things, like having to wake him up so he'd stop snoring.&nbsp; Having the alarm clock on my side of the bed so it would get turned off.&nbsp; Him getting mad at me for getting crumbs in the bed.&nbsp; Getting mad when Chomper would ambush him. Taking bubble baths together, him making me Mac N Cheese.&nbsp; Going to Nicks and the movies, lay ing down in the driveway, fighting and making up, cuddling, waiting up for him, or trying to and him taking my glasses off because i fell alseep.&nbsp; The way he smelled, how comfortable we were with sex and each other.&nbsp; Him pulling me down the stairs because I wanted to, piggy back rides. Him proposing.&nbsp; The way he loved the ring I gave him.&nbsp; The way I could just kiss him once and he was turned on.&nbsp; The way he pretended to care about all the facts I learned from Animal Planet about the 6 kinds of rattlesnakes.&nbsp; The way he always made me feel beautiful, even in glasses, and his sweatpants.&nbsp; Waking up at night actually saying his name.&nbsp; Not sleeping good when he wasnt there. Writing letters and song l yrics.&nbsp; Writing in the Book, telling him about God. Cleaning the buildings and having him sing country. Sleeping in Bridgetts car...&nbsp; Those are things I dont want to forget.&nbsp; At one point he made me the happiest I've ever been.&nbsp; He also put me through the worst.&nbsp; Because of him, I question ever aspect of me and Ben, when I should just leave well enough alone.&nbsp; He told me tonight he wishes he could change what happened and he misses me.&nbsp; He went into more detail but I wont becaues I had to relive the hurt of leaving all over again.&nbsp; I told him it was simple:&nbsp; We didnt work because it wasnt supposed to happen.&nbsp; I fucked with fate because I decided I wanted Mel, no matter what 'destiny' said.&nbsp; We never had a real chance.

I was engaged to Mel, living there and everything, parents found out, disowned me, he hit me, I left and came back home.  Got back in school, started hanging out with Kaylen Ray and the plowboys, was sleeping with Rothe, then came home for Christmas break.  I talked to Trae on the internet, he said he was in Eastland, and we were gonna meet.  Went back down to Stephenville to see Rothe for a few days, then Thursday night Trae called and said he wanted to see me, so we got a hotel room.  We stayed together Thursday and Friday night.  It was so great! Who would have thought after everything we had been through, we would get to spend new years together!  He's completley amazing...and I'm still head over heals for him!  Imagine that.  Good news, he's applying to Tarleton and a few other colleges in TX and should be back this summer for good...unless he gets sent back to Iraq.  I mean, I could deal either way- Because I want to be with him no matter what.  It was definately worth the wait, getting to see him and everything.  We had two very special nights!  I didnt get to kiss him at midnight, because I couldnt find him, but when I did find him, he kissed me.  He's pretty good at that!  Anyways, I'm going out to eat with my family, so I'll talk to yall later!"

I actually founded this little thing called Operation Soldier Sincerity (Soldier Support is taken lol)  And I get names and APOs of any troop overseas that would like a penpal.  And through my church and my school, and any where else I happen to go, people will adopt the soldiers, and send them letters and care packages!  God used me today!  I stayed up til 330 AM crying my eyes out, because I'm reading the book A Table In The Presence, about the presence of God amongst the 1st marine battalion the 5th regiment over there last Spring.  It's AWESOME, but its so detailed, that it makes me ache for Trae, and it just kills me.  Its hard to read because of it, but I will get through it.  And I cried and talked to God for a long time last night, debating on rather or not I should give him complete control of Trae and that whole situation, because I feel so useless, I cant do anything at all to help Trae, but I want to SOO bad its killing me inside!  Well, I finally surrendered, and I emailed Trae telling him everything, and about how I just wish there was something I could do, but I know I cant.  Wow, and then today, I formed OSS!  And it might not directly effect Trae, but think of how many lives will be touched! Im so excited.  Hopefully there is not a single body deployed that does not have someone to write home to.  And I sent all my soldier and marine friends emails, asking them to collect addresses so that they can be 'adopted' and I've already gotten a ton in return, but they go as fast as they come! So keep em coming guys!!"

<P>An army spokesman said the convoy, traveling from Baquba to Najaf, was hit just after midnight by a roadside bomb planted south of Baghdad. The wounded were taken on to Najaf and were in a stable condition. 
<P>
<P>U.S. troops based north of the capital have been shifting further south to reinforce other foreign troops in the U.S.-led coalition facing an insurgency by Shi'ite Muslim militants loyal to radical cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. 
<P>
<P>The United States has said it will kill or capture Sadr, who is thought to be in Najaf. </FONT></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>"

<P><FONT color=#ff99ff><STRONG>First and foremost- Happy Easter!&nbsp; Second- Trae and David- not a day goes by that you aren't in my thoughts and prayers.&nbsp; Not because I miss you, I love you, and I'm scared for you, but because I AM PROUD OF YOU!!!</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#993399><STRONG>April:&nbsp; I'm sorry if I made u mad or anything on Thursday, I just found out about Trae and was in a self pity mood, and you just happened to get on.&nbsp; I could tell something was wrong, but I didnt know if you were mad at me or something else, and I was too selfish to ask.</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><STRONG>Ok- now here's my weekend brief:</STRONG></P>
<P><FONT color=#009900><STRONG>Thursday- I got Trae's text message as I was leaving school, so that pretty much ruined my day. I came home and put on those sappy songs, and cried, being completely selfish.&nbsp; I feel pretty foolish now, because I realize as upset as I am that he's extended, it's nothing compared to what hes going through.&nbsp; Everything that goes through my imagination, is his real life.&nbsp; All that stuff that I have nightmares about, he faces every day.&nbsp; So needless to say, I want to make sure he knows how much I care, so I started writing him letters every day.&nbsp; We don't write letters, we do the internet thing, so hopefully when he gets mail it will brighten his day.&nbsp; He should get it around his birthday too!&nbsp; So then I went to a rugby game.&nbsp; Wow- I thought hockey was tough!&nbsp; Hott guys with sexy accents!!&nbsp; Too bad I don't understand the sport lol</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#3333ff><STRONG>Friday- I got up at 630 and drove to Arlington for the weekend.&nbsp; Friday the church went to 6 Flags for this Christian Concert weekend, where there was some awesome Christian rock bands playing.&nbsp; So we got there at 1030AM and left at 11 PM.&nbsp; Yea- long hot day. Everyone was grumpy.&nbsp; The concert started at 630, and we kinda got our second wind. I prayed for Trae and David a lot.&nbsp; Audio Adrenaline kept shooting red white and blue streamers into the crowd, so that made me think of them.&nbsp; Then the last song they dropped a huge american flag, and I cried.&nbsp; It's so nice to see more support!&nbsp; America doesn't support my guys enough!!&nbsp; So I spent the night at my grandmas and got NO sleep whatsoever!</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#ff6600><STRONG>Saturday- I met my new baby cousin Caden for the first time.&nbsp; He's a cutie!&nbsp; Hes almost 2 months old, but was&nbsp; a premi, so hes tiny!&nbsp; I took a nap because I woke up pretty sick.&nbsp; Can't breath, horrible sinus headache...the whole nine yards...&nbsp; Anyways, then last night I made some banana pudding with my grandma.&nbsp; Then I wrote Trae and David letters, and took a hot bath.&nbsp; Im so sore from six flags and have some serious blisters.&nbsp; So that made me feel a little better.&nbsp; Then I tossed and turned all night, i MIGHT have got an hour sleep in all.&nbsp; The heater was broken, and a cold front came through, so I was freezing the whole night.&nbsp; I moved from the couch to the bed to the chair and back again lol.&nbsp; </STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#6600cc>Finally at 700 this morning I found a little heater in the living room and cuddled up with a blanket.&nbsp; I still was miserable, so I missed church.&nbsp; I feel like I'm on my death bed.&nbsp; I layed by the heater all day long, attempting to doze on and off, freezing the whole time.&nbsp; Then my other cousin and aunt came over for Easter lunch, and we ate.&nbsp; It was good.&nbsp; Then me and my cousin went to the bedroom and watched Striptease, and I took a 30 minute nap.&nbsp; Finally I got up and came home.&nbsp; I still have NO energy.&nbsp; I checked my mail and took a 2 hour nap with my electric blanket! Finally I'm not cold anymore!!&nbsp; And I took some cold/flu medicine, because I'm 100% sure I have a sinus infection, my ears are stopped up, I have horrible sinus pressure, sore throat, coughing, can't breath...&nbsp; I might have a little fever.&nbsp; Thank God I dont have school tomorrow...I can sleep all day.&nbsp; I got 2 more letters from David today.&nbsp; That makes 4 since Thursday.&nbsp; And I got an offline message from him, so I know he's okay.&nbsp; Well I'm going to try to find something to eat, so I will write tommorrow or something.<BR></FONT><FONT color=#ff0000>BOYS:</FONT> <FONT color=#3333ff>STAY </FONT><FONT color=#ff0000>SAFE </FONT><FONT color=#3333ff>AND </FONT><FONT color=#ff0000>BE </FONT><FONT color=#3333ff>STRONG</FONT><FONT color=#ff6600>!</FONT><FONT color=#3333ff>!</FONT></STRONG></P>"

YAY!!&nbsp; </FONT></STRONG>"

"event","<FONT color=#6600cc size=4>Sunday, my aunt cooks a lunch for us after church, everyone comes over and eats.  Then this sunday, since it rained, the me, clint, cameron, david, keith, trevor, and katie all went mudding on our 4wheelers ALL DAY LONG!&nbsp; We were SOOO gross, needless to say, when we pulled out to start, it was raining, and it rained for the first 20 minutes, and we go to the 'sand dunes' which isnt sand...but red clay...and ponds in the process of being made, so theres lots of steep hills, little bumps to jump, and mudholes.&nbsp; So we got stuck, and I helped us get unstuck, cuz I'm not much of a girly girl.&nbsp; But I did cut my hand open, cuz I had the back end of the 4wheeler when it was stuck. Something cut me when I picked it up.&nbsp; I dunno what, but I'm okay.&nbsp; We kept going lol.&nbsp; So since we were SO INCREDIBALLY MUDDY, we saw this pond that was completed ont he way out...&nbsp; And it was like a straight down drop off.&nbsp; So we  ran and jumped off the side of this edge.&nbsp; Lol like 30 ft down we finally hit water, thank God it was deep!&nbsp; So we played around in the water for a while, then decided we should head back, cuz we were all freezing and very hungry.&nbsp; Not to mention we all had dirt all over our faces and in our hair, and still all over our clothes.&nbsp; So we rode back, girls went in one bathroom, guys to the other, and we took showers to wash up.&nbsp; Then we all got into PJs and my aunt washed all our clothes.&nbsp; We went and got pizza and movies, and called it a night.&nbsp; And that was my Sunday!&nbsp; Saturday, I slept pretty late, til like 2, then I got up and got ready, and went to the dirt track to meet Benny and the crew and watch most of the crew race.&nbsp; Friday night I went to Arlington, took a nap, got ready, and met Benny and the crew at the drag races and drank some beer!&nbsp; Oh, but then last night me and Benny broke up.&nbsp; I don't think either one of us really need a relationship, much less want one.&nbsp; We just liked each other so much, it sounded good at the time, and we jumped into a relationship WAY too fast!&nbsp; So we called that quits.  Just as well, it woulda only taken a few weeks for me to realize that he ISNT Trae and never will be.  I need to quit looking for a replacement.  Trae is the love of my life.  What's another month before he comes home?  It's just hard... having these feelings for someone but not being able to act on them...  But having feelings for Trae and actions with someone else isnt good either...   I just need to calm down and stay strong for him.  From now on- if I think Im getting into something I think Ill have to keep from Trae (a relationship of any sort) Im just gonna not do it...  He means to much to jeapordize.  &nbsp; Okay well, I'm gonna wrap this entry up, then write another one later about today, lol which wasn't that interesting, but oh well.</FONT>"

"event","<P><STRONG><FONT color=#3333ff size=4>Ok- I HAVE to vent!!&nbsp; I'm so stressed out I cant even think straight.&nbsp; Just had to stop and wipe my eyes real quick, I was leaving a message on Davids journal talking about how much I love Trae and everything, and then I turned on the radio, just in time to hear Letters From Home, and I officially broke down for the first time this afternoon.&nbsp; Wow...I'm okay now.&nbsp; Anyways, as if I dont have enough stress with Trae, things are going to shit on Davids journal. All his stupid little bitch friends are being VERY nasty to each other.&nbsp; It hurts him so much to see that.&nbsp; And I'm sorry, I know they are his friends, and I bite my tongue EVERY time I read one of their immature little commets, so clearly directed to each other, because I know the LAST thing David wants to see is me loose my cool.&nbsp; So I'm gonna do it here where I'm not stepping on toes or hurting feelings.&nbsp; HOLY SHIT!! What is WRONG with those girls!?&nbsp; Its like Ricky Lake over there!&nbsp; They write more doggin on eachother than they do to David.&nbsp; It's almost like his journal is just a place to go critisize each other, and they pull the focus TOTALLY off David.&nbsp; The only two reminding everyone of him is me and his Mom.&nbsp; Im like DANG! Be considerate!&nbsp; And respectful!!&nbsp; You wanna have cat fights, exchange screen names, where David doesnt have to see it.&nbsp; That has to just crush him.&nbsp; It hurts me to see them abusing his journal like that.&nbsp; The sole purpose of that journal is for him to write down his PERSONAL thoughts and feelings, and for us to encourage him and help him through this extremely hard time.&nbsp; And they are just completely taking over! Almost every comment now has some nasty quirck in there directed to April.&nbsp; It's insane.&nbsp; And hell yea I think they're jealous of her!&nbsp; Damn, I was at first, when me and Trae first broke up, I really wanted to be with David.&nbsp; But he loves her, and I respected that.&nbsp; Now I know that I'm not supposed to be with him, and I still love Trae VERY much, and I know April on a personal level, and I dont think David has a more perfect match!&nbsp; I honestly believe they will survive it and get married.&nbsp; Anyways, I just have to get that off my chest, I was about to explode in Davids journal, but I have more respect and consideration for him to do that and add to it, and more respect to myself to stoop to that level. And dude!&nbsp; Scroll through his entries....I'm mentioned in there as much as April.&nbsp; Not Sarah and Nikki.&nbsp; I'm in almost every entry.&nbsp; Okay...hmm...wonder who he favors right now?&nbsp; Probably the one who favors him...and the one supporting him and trying to keep the peace.&nbsp; And maybe the reason he doesnt respond to them is because they dont write to him! They write to each other!!&nbsp; I fully agree with April, those girls have problems, and they are green with envy.&nbsp; And thats up with that Nikki chick using David and Aprils pet names on David?&nbsp; NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!&nbsp; That's theirs!&nbsp; Even if 'it was hers first', its not anymore dumbass!&nbsp; Quit calling him that!&nbsp; He calls me cheeks, but thats not a pet name.&nbsp; If I went around calling him Cupcake...there would be a problem...&nbsp; Wonder why April gets jealous...hmmm MAYBE because those girls pretend that they are his girlfriends, pet names at all. And thats stepping on toes as it is...but to use THEIR pet names?!?&nbsp; Who would have thought!!&nbsp; Anyways, Im pissed and VERY upset, so I'm gonna go.&nbsp; Pray for my Trae, David, and that things will be rated PG again in Davids Journal. &lt;&gt;&lt;</FONT></STRONG></P>

But he's a good man.&nbsp; 3rd Period I have Office Procedures, but they made me a teachers aide for some Chemistry teacher, Miss Keyes.&nbsp; She's really unoraganized, and my job is to organize her stuff and grade her papers.... wow...good luck with that one, you should see her room!&nbsp; Needless to say, that class is pointless.&nbsp; I was supposed to get out at 1230, but I left at 1145, enough said.&nbsp; So now I'm just sitting at home, waiting on some sort of sign for Trae.&nbsp; I left him several offline messages on yahoo, telling him Ive never been this scared and everything and to PLEASE message me or email me or SOMETHING if he got on...and I've got nothing... I'm so worried!&nbsp; Please PLEASE EVERYONE pray for him!!&nbsp; I love you Private Carter :)&nbsp; God Bless Our Troops &lt;&gt;&lt;</FONT></STRONG>"

"event","Hmm...if anyone else might be a little confused to me seeming to change guys all the time...Just know that it is just Ben and Trae right now.  And the only way that I guess I can kind of let yall know how I feel inside is with this song.  It describes me and Trae to a T, and right now, I'm at the point where it says 'a part of me is telling me its time to move on, and another wants to break down and cry.'  So here it is: 
[Intro] 
I don't understand why 
See it's burning me to hold onto this 
I know this is something I gotta do 
But that don't mean I want to 
What I'm trying to say is that I-love-you I just 
I feel like this is coming to an end 
And it's better for me to let it go now than hold on and hurt you 
I gotta let it burn 

[Verse 1] 
It's gonna burn for me to say this 
But it's comin from my heart 
It's been a long time coming 
But we done been fell apart 
Really wanna work this out 
But I don't think you're gonna change 
I do but you don't 
Think it's best we go our separate ways 
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship 
When I'm hurting baby, I ain't happy baby 
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with 
I think that you should let it burn 

[Chorus] 
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to 
But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to 
Even though this might ruin you 
Let it burn 
Let it burn 
Gotta let it burn 

Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you 
Hate the thought of her being with someone else 
But you know that it's over 
We know that it's through 
Let it burn 
Let it burn 
Gotta let it burn 

[Verse 2] 
Sendin' pages I ain't supposed to 
Got somebody here but I want you 
Cause the feelin ain't the same by myself 
Callin' her your name 
Ladies tell me do you understand? 
Now all my fellas do you feel my pain? 
It's the way I feel 
I know I made a mistake 
Now it's too late 
I know she ain't comin back 
What I gotta do now 
To get my shorty back 
Ooo ooo ooo ooooh 
Man I don't know what I'm gonna do 
Without my booo 
You've been gone for too long 
It's been fifty-leven days, um-teen hours 
Imma be burnin' till you return (let it burn) 

[Chorus] 
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to 
But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to 
Even though this might ruin you 
Let it burn (let it burn, let it burn, you gon'learn) 
Let it burn (gotta let it burn) 
Gotta let it burn 

Deep down you know its best for yourself but you 
Hate the thought of her being with someone else 
But you know that it's over 
We know that it's through 
Let it burn 
Let it burn 
Gotta let it burn 

[Bridge] 
I'm twisted cuz one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on 
On the other side I wanna break down and cry (ooooh) 
I'm twisted cuz one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on 
On the other side I wanna break down and cry (yeah) 

[Breakdown] 
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh oooh 
Ooh ooh oooh (can ya feel me burnin'?) 
Ooh ooh ooh oooh ooh oooh 

So many days, so many hours 
I'm still burnin' till you return 

[Chorus] 
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to 
But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to 
Even though this might ruin you 
Let it burn 
Let it burn 
Gotta let it burn 

Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you 
Hate the thought of her being with someone else 
But you know that it's over 
We know that it's through 
Let it burn 
Let it burn 
Gotta let it burn"

But I didn't think he was gonna call me.&nbsp; Anyways, we were both at the dirt track last night, and he text messaged me and said I'm here and I want to meet up.&nbsp; So we met up, and I sat with him the whole time.&nbsp; I met his brothers, he met my cousin and stuff.&nbsp; It was really cool.&nbsp; And we got along great.&nbsp; He just has this very charismatic personality.&nbsp; So, I STILL couldnt tell if he was really interested or just wanted to hang out.&nbsp; Until the race was over...then he was trying to get me to go to I hop, lol so were his bros, they loved me.&nbsp; But I couldnt go, and he was like, go anyways lol.&nbsp; So I gave him a hug and told him he can call me if he wants to.&nbsp; Well...come to find out I COULD go to I hop, so I did. And I txted him and told him I was going.&nbsp; But then, they went to a DIFFERENT Ihop. So our group of like 20 ppl was split in half.&nbsp; Anyways, he called me about 30 minutes later wanting to talk on his drive home, so we did.&nbsp; I told him I would call him at 1230 PM today.&nbsp; This is when I really knew he was interested, when he called cuz he wanted to talk.&nbsp; Then today, I slept in, and at 2 he txt me and was like...hmm, I didnt get a call! lol So I was like, if you really wanted to talk, you coulda called me ya know.&nbsp; So he did :) And we talked for an hour.&nbsp; We have a lot in common and everything, and I'm very attracted to him, and I feel really comfortable around him.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; Sound good to you?&nbsp; Cuz I'm pretty confused.&nbsp; I love Trae, but I like someone else <IMG src=""http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/tsmileys2/15.gif"">.&nbsp; What do I do!&nbsp; I really wanna persue things with Ben, because so far, it's been better than I have had in a LONG time!&nbsp; Stability, security, he's sweet, I love his family, they love me, we enjoy the same things, are in the same place on the weekends, he's cute, we're comfortable, have the same crowd of friends (who are VERY supportive may I say lol).&nbsp; Its a lot different than my 5 minute conversations with Trae once a week...&nbsp; I even get nervous and gitty when I think about Ben! :)&nbsp; And I know David would like him better than he likes Trae.</FONT></STRONG>"

"event","Okay, yesterday was a LOT better.  I was so stressed, I just had to get out of Keller.  So I came to my cousins house in Arlington, and we went to go see Starsky and Hutch.  Lol, great movie by the way! When we were walking in the theatre, my Trae IMed me, and I had my messages forwarded to my cell, so I got to talk to him for a few minutes.  Just knowing he's okay took a million pounds off my chest.  I get so worried about him!  He was telling me that he was exhausted, because he had been at the bomb site for 2 days.  Poor man...  I just can't wait til he comes home, and I know he's safe!  So my day was already better than it had started.  Then a little while later, I talked to my friend Kyle, who is also in Baghdad, and he said he was supposed to be at that hotel then...but he got held up somewhere else.  And the guys who went in his place left about 15 minutes before the bombing.  God was definatley watching!!  So, I was feeling huge relief.  Then April, David's girlfriend, said that we should start talking, and kind of help keep eachother sane during this time.  So, she emailed me, and I emailed her to.  Oh! And I ditched Cody.  Screw that, I don't need it.  Any guy who's gonna get that bossy and possessive when we were just dating, it can only get worse, and probably turn into an abusive relationship, emotionally and probably physically too.  My mother raised me smarter than that, and if my parents dont like him, there's something wrong that I'm just too young to detect.  So then, after the movie and everything, me and my cousin went out to the Drag Strip and watch the street races.  Then this morning, everything is calm and back to normal.  I'm not worried sick about anyone, and I'm away from my room, where there is reminders of the war and of Trae and David everywhere.  I got on to check my mail, and who would have thought, Diane, David's mother had responded to one of my entries!  I'm not sure how she got my login name, I'm guessing David gave it to her.  That kid!  He's been wanting me to talk to his mother for about a month now.  So maybe we will start talking now.  She seems really sweet, and if she's anything like him, and thats how she comes off, then she's truely God-sent.  Anyways, I need to hop in the shower now, we're about to hit the Drag Strip again! God Bless Our Troops, especially my two!!

1 hour, 20 minutes ago  Add Top Stories - Reuters to My Yahoo! 
 


BAGHDAD (Reuters) - A U.S. soldier was killed and seven were wounded in a mortar attack at a logistics base north of the Iraqi capital Baghdad, the U.S. Army said Thursday. 

Four of the injured soldiers were returned to duty within hours after the attack in Balad, about 45 miles north of Baghdad, the Army said in a statement. The other three wounded soldiers were evacuated to a combat support hospital. 


The death brings to 390 the number of U.S. soldiers killed in action since the start of the U.S.-led war in Iraq (news - web sites) almost a year ago. 


GREAT!  So now all I know is there is 1 dead and 7 hurt.  Okay, well, in a positive note, Trae is stationed IN baghdad, not North of it...  But who knows, the American news can get all fucked up.  So now I'm sitting on edge until I hear from him... how much worse could this get?  I love him so much...  I wish I knew that he knew that, and that he'd never question me."

"event","Hey, okay, I just was watching the evening news, and the story about the huge Baghdad bombing comes on.  It says something about a hotel being hit hard, and lots of people dying.  The first thing that came to mind is Trae telling me if I ever heard anything about the Al Rasheed Hotel, to start worrying about him, because he's close to that.  I didn't hear the name of the hotel, so I immediatley just broke down, because as I wrote earlier, I'm already worried about him.   So I got on the net to check the story out, so I could get all the details, because Keller's stupid news sucks, and doesnt say anything that I need to know.  So I get on, and found out that its not the hotel he told me to watch for...and that no soldiers were reported dead, so that's always good.  Anyways, I'm still a little nervous, but hopefully I'll hear from him soon.  I'll  keep yall updated. God Bless Our Troops, especially my two <><"

"event","Alright,  I dunno how much longer I can take this.  I'm supposed to be with my highschool sweetheart and we should be getting married soon, but I just don't know if I can take all his shit!  He bitches at me when I cant come to his house 30 minutes away at 11 PM at night ONE TIME (keep in mind i AM in high school, my curfew is midnight, and my parents dont like him anyways).  But where was he for TWO WEEKS straight?  Geez, I dunno, because he never answered his fucking phone! FOR TWO WEEKS.  So he just calls me outta the blue, and he claims to have been in jail.  Real winner huh?  That's the bullrider in him.  He almost beat his neighbor to death because his neighbor shot Cody's new pit bull puppy.  Can't say that I blame him much though, I mean, that was completely outta place for his dickhead neighbor, but damn Cody!  Then, 4 days go by, and he didnt answer his cell phone at all.  Finally I get a hold of him, and I'm like WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN!  He goes 'what?, no where'  Okay?  So he just didnt answer his phone for me 4 times in a row...sounds promising...  So he's like, well I'm going outta town this weekend, I'll be back on Sunday and you're coming over.  Okay?  Bossy!  So Sunday comes, and I'm at my best friends house.  He texts me, so I call him back.  He gets all pissed because I'm with a bunch of guys.  OMG!  They are my friends you psycho! Get over it!  He even knows them!  So the next night he calls me (two nights in a row, thats a record!)  And he is all pissed cuz I have a fever and can't drive out there, and because I just had sugery, I can't do any type of pysical activity for another week, including sex, so he gets pissed again because he was gonna come here, but he's not anymore since I can't do anything.  Since when is it all about sex?  Not with me thank you!  If I wanted just that, I would be doing whatever I want...  So he's like, well I guess I'll see you in 2 weeks.  What?  Appartently, he's going out of town again.  And he gets mad at me for ONE NIGHT, hes gone ALL THE DAMN TIME.  So we fought about that, and he's like I love you Kayli.  Bullshit.  Proove it.  Love? David loves me...  Trae loves me perhaps...  But not Cody.  David, EVERY chance he gets, he leaves me messages.  No he's not IN  love with me, its a different kind, but still.  Not a day goes by that I ever question how he feels about me.  And he's in Iraq!  And Trae, well, I love him more than anything, and I'm fully prepared to ditch Cody and anything else as soon as I get word that he will be in TX at Ft Hood.  And for a while, he was saying he loved me, then I dunno, we stopped.  I don't care about that though.  I know he cares about me more than Cody ever thought of!  And anyone who knows me, knows that Trae was my life for 2 months.  And still would be if he trusted me a little more.  Not that I blame him, his past isn't the best.  But I fully intend on being his future, if he comes to TX.  I get scared when I dont hear from him...  Every few days or so he's on, but I haven't talked to him since Saturday Night, thats when he told me he might go to college with me, depending on this army thing.  That would be awesome!  But I'm really scared.  I leave him offline messages, telling him I miss him and I know he's safe, because he comes home May 10, and all that stuff...but I dont think he's been on, because he hasnt replied.  With all the news about Baghdad...it just scares me.  But I trust in God that he is watching over my Trae and my David, along with everyone else who is close to me overseas.  Anyways, now that I got that off my chest, I'm gonna go try to eat a little.   God Bless Our Troops, especially my two David and Trae.  <><"

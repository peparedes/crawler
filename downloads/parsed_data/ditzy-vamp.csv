I love him through his faults and his... slightly skewed opinions on things. I am able to listen to him forever and never get bored or tired of him. Everyother guy I get sick of within a couple of weeks. But him. Ive liked him for so long and listened to him for even longer. i never get tired of him. I never get bored of him. It hurts me whenever I see him with that other girl. Its as if my heart is splitting slowly. Painfully. And yet, he's still clueless when he sees me looking sadly up at him. He asks me why I am sad. Is there anything he can do? There is one thing he could do. But I doubt he ever would. The only thing he could do is tell me he returns my feelings. He could say without my asking ""I love you too"". But I suppose for this to happen I would have to inform him that I do have these feelings for him. Id have to come to terms with this first. I havent beleived in love since... well for a long time. Love is something that hurts way too much and how can it be love if the other person doesnt share your feelings. Is  it not obsession then? Lust maybe? This entire thing greatly confuses me. If he doesnt love me then am I simply obsessed with him? I hope not... I need to settle this once and forall. I need to tell him. But how?

"event","I havent felt this way in a long time. It scares me. I have no control and Ive lost all sensation. All I can feel is an overwhelming sense of inability. I'm in a state of somewhere between hyper-ventilating and strange calm. 

People always ask me ""What are you thinkin?"" ""Are you okay?"" and ""Why are you like this?"". I of course avoid the questoin. Cause I cant lie for shit. When I do lie I can't even fucking look the person in the eye. I'm so fucking helpless. You know I do this to myself. I bring it upon myself. Theres very few people I can talk to about this. And right now I can't get a hold of any of them. I feel abandoned and alone...



I think Ive finally made up my mind to do what Ive been wanting to do for a while now of course I havent told anyone about it. They would try to convince me of not. But its what I need right now. I need to get away from everything. Its really starting to suffocate me. I cant handle all of this anymore. It may seem like I can handle anything and everything sometimes. But I cant, there are somethings that I cannot deal with.

I just came to the realisation that I have a thing for eyes. Of course I have preference for blue or brown eyes. Dont know why... just do i guess.. 

Anyways That was a long week. It just kept going and going. I now play clarinet. Add it to the list of instruments that I can play successfully. Ugh I need a social life. lol. Last night I had to work so instead of going home and then going I just went to the gym and walked to work. By the time I was finished work it was like 7:30 Emily had left a message on my cell telling me to go to the movies at like 7:20. Im like haha yah right. I was dehydrated last night and had a major headache no way was I gonna go out.  Im working again tonight and tomorrow. Hopefully Ill finish early and be able to finally watch season 5 of Viva la Bam. I bought it like 3 weeks ago and havent watched it yet. 

I think I need to get out more.

"event","Ok so for instrumental music we were assigned to write a few paragraphs about an experience that changed us or affected us in some way. So of course I delved deep into my past and started thinking about it all. 

In my life *so far* Ive learned:

1) No matter how well you know a person you can not trust them or believe anything they say sometimes. - This life lesson came from an experience from my uncle. He has lied to me so many times it amazes even me that he did it all. Ive only just been able to forgive him.

2) Painkillers can only kill so much pain. - Usually only the typical headache or mild migraine. Not the severe pain of a broken heart. The only thing that can help that pain is time. Unfortunately.

3) New friends are fun but the older friends know you so much better. - Its always nice to meet new people and make new friends. But the longer you know someone the more time you want to spend with them. 

4) Friends should always come before boys. - Unfortunately at our age we will be in and out of relationships about as often as we change our hairstyles. Yes sometime are lucky and find someone they really connect with but nothing is finite untill that ring is on your finger. And even then nothing is definite anymore. Friends will always be there to comfort you and make you laugh. 

5) It is considerably hard to drown yourself. - Self explanatory.

6) Patience IS a virtue. - I am a very patient person and I find that if I push for something it doesnt happen the way I would particularely like it to. Things will work out the way there supposed to if your patient enough.

7) Cutting and cake are only temporary reliefs of your in the moment emotionalism. - And will probably make you feel worst every time you see the after effects of them. 

8) Its easier to tell the truth right away then to tell a lie, live it, then have it found out later. - It hurts people so much more to find out that you lied to them. And its so hard to see the pain in their eyes.

9) Even if you just talk about doing something with someone elses significant other you will feel guilty for even considering doing the act while they are still attached. - Maybe its just me. I dont know.

10) The 10 commandments are NOT just guidelines. - You can take them as you want. Its your right. It is the greatest way for you to live without guilt or lies. Wish I had followed them more closely.

11) Sometimes, it is better to show what your feeling in the moment. - I know that for a long time I wouldnt cry or show anger or sadness. It made me very self-inclusive. I felt I didnt need anyone or anything to live. And then I lost my will to live. I figured if everyone saw me as happy-go-lucky then I was actually happy. But I wasnt.

12) Leave nothing up to fate. - Yeah things happen but You can influence some thigns right?

13) Last but not least : Dont feel regret!!! - I regretted almost everything I ever did untill a wonderful friend of mine told me to stop living if I was gonna regret everything I did. So I just accepted the fact that Im gonna do things I wont be proud of. But they're what is gonna make me, me. I dont have to be proud of my mistakes I have to accept them.

So thats that. All I wanna think of right now that I can write down. So yeah that was... relieving.

So ive been really scared lately. And its particularely strange to say that Ive actually been scared. I havent been truely scared for a very long time. 
Consider this: Its easier to have an opinion on something when your not in the situation isnt it? Like alot of people will say abortion is wrong, it should never be done etc. but what if they were raped or something along those lines and they got pregnant. Would they be able to carry and care for that child knowing what its biological father did to the mother? It works the opposite way too. You can say that you support abortion but put in the predicament where you would have to choose could you say basically ""Yes, I want to kill what is essentially my future child.""I suppose it all depends on the person's individual moral code. Ive been thinking about it alot lately *for no reason in particular. It just kind of entered my mind and havent been able to get around it.* and if I was to get pregnant at this age if I was to have the child I wouldnt be able to support it and I would screw up any potential for a good future for either of us. I would never be able to live if I was to get an abortion. It is killing something that you created. You should have responsibility. 
I realise theres always adoption, but how do you know if its a good family. 
Can you imagine that all this goes through my mind all the time?

Anyways Ive just started a new semester. My classes are English Vocal fashion lunch Instrumental. Easiest semester I have ever had. Vocal already sucks. MIA has been well MIZ so Ive been happier then usual. For the last few days Ive been kinda off the wall happy. No reason Just becuz.

Valentines Day is one week away. It seems that yet again I am single. And will be for Valentines. Isnt that sad. Out of all the relationships that Ive had Ive only had one boyfriend that was around long enough for Valentines Day with me. He was such a sweetie. Too bad I moved. *which is another thing but im not done here yet* So me and NN will probably spend the night at my house watching corny old Disney movies then go to the dance on Thursday and be.. well we'll do what we do at dances which is not really considered reputable. So you know how in my previous entries Ive been talking about that guy that I like? Well I havent seen him around all that much either. I figure the secret to being happy is not seeing the ones that you secretly wanna see. You with me?

Ok so the moving thing. Ive been wondering what I wouldve been like if I hadnt moved. Id probably still be with that guy. You know the one Ive mentioned him before too. I wonder if I would have the same personality and be in the same type of group. 

I wonder if my friends realise I actually think this much. I doubt they would. Im blonde right? So of course I get the typical 'Dumb Blonde' stereotype. Unfortunately I play it up. Maybe too much. Ill work on that. I had to go into work today. It really sucks when your in the gym and then your mom comes in with your scrubs and says 'They called you in' I only had time to change before I had to go to work so that sucked.

Anyways Im tired 
Night

So I got to sleep in today well at least by my standards. So thats like till 7a.m.? I also decided to eat breakfast and lunch today because I didnt have an exam, so I was in a really good mood. Active word was. So as my grandpa and I were about ready to leave I thought it best to go make sure Matt's door was closed because the cat has had a tendancy of staring hungrily at his fish lately. Of course when I went into his room said fish was MIA. And the cat was sitting there. Im like ""Shit"". So when I came home from the police department I watched Dukes of Hazzard. Then Matt got home. I of course had to break it to him. Good Lord can that kid scream! 

So anyways to say the least hes mad at me. So Im a lil lonely. Im going to Barrie on Sunday to see Dustins band play. Its gonna be fun. 

So this journal seems so much more restricting compared to my other one which is the one that I say whatever I want about anything. Even people who I like. Not that anyone would really be able to tell. So anyway everyone knows how much I like tall guys right? Well at the station today there was this like 6'4 hottie. I was like 'So my type' but I didnt feel right about hitting on a guy in front of my grandparents so yah. Grr.

So I have totally depressed myself. I got caught up in all these old songs that I used to love. Back around the time of 'Turtle'. So of course that makes them all romancey sappy love songs. So then I got to thinking about how I dont ave a boyfriend at the moment. I cant think of any guys who are romantically interested in me. So now that thats done...

My day was very nonproductive.I studied the majority of hte day. Then me and Mitch walked over to Fortinos and bought stuff for the week. And of course there already selling for Valentines. Woohoo.

I dont talk about him much anymore. I still love him. I knew him for my whole life. I miss him sometimes. Lol isnt it weird? That I can still miss him even efter all the pain he put me through?

"event","First off i'm very disappointed in my self. I had gone 2 months without smoking. 2! And well Lets just say i'm back to just quitting again.

I'm so frustrated lately. I can't handle things like I normally can. Ive had to control my temper more times than id like to say. I have marks on my hands from where I dug my fingernails into my own skin to divert my emotions. I don't know i'm being like this. Nothing has changed.

Just the other day, Wednesday, I had choir, left early cause to be honest I didn't want to be there. Then something just clicked in my head. I wanted to scream, cry, and hit something. I kicked a door wanted that to break. The worst thing about all this is people have actually been able to notice it. 

Adding to that, I hate it when people ask you if your ""Okay"". Its understandable that their worried about you and whatever. But it helps if you actually wait for an answer you know? I dunno i'm just being weird right now. I wish people wouldn't worry about me.

So today during third me and Emily were walking through the halls when we ran into Jay. Well the long and short of that he put me on the spot. Tried to hold me in the spot. Wouldn't let me go. I panicked. Everyone knows that I hate guys being like that. It scares me. It freaked me right out. It affected me for the rest of the day. UGH.

My life is falling apart around me. My family life is fucked. I need someone to talk to but if i do talk to someone about it then i feel guilty because everyone has there own problems and dont need mine on their shoulders as well. This livejournal and all my blogs really help me cuz i can get it out and it really doesnt matter who reads them cuz no one ever really does. Semi was fun i had an awesome time but again drama everywhere. And it wasn't even just confined to our group:O. surprised me. Bit of a problem though i lost control and i think i made a mistake. Depending on how a conversation goes it could or could not be a mistake wont know untill though. Life is harder and it feels like im drowning. how cliche. ugh im tired and have a headache im gonna go take some tylenol and go to sleep

Alright im venting yet again but first HIP HIP HOORAY!! for me cuz i am seriously getting better at updating more oftenly *is that a word?* anyways here it comes... Okay wtf am i supposed to do if someone says that theyll be somewhere waiting for you and they're not and then you can't find them and they are supposed to come over to your house to watch movies after school? I did something probably its always my fault i cant seem to do anything right anymore totally bites. And i cant seem to keep a guy liking me for longer than a few days anymore there must be something seriously wrong with me. Oh well good thing i never get too attached toa person eh? anyways im bored and i have nothing to do. I'm a teenage girl who wants nothing more out of life than to have a regular make-out buddy it really shouldnt be too hard to find someone should it???? anyways I don't even think I want to much of a serious relationship right now though I'd like it but if it involves this much complications with ex's and other BS it is not worth it at the moment so yah thats about it for now i guess. Going shopping tomorrow for my semi-dress soo excited i realise im cutting it close but w/e i dun care itll be fine.

yeah so all of those quotes are with steph gawd girl u get me through some hard times so where to start...ah yes of course im under one hell of a lot of stress right now. My grandparents came over last night for dinner. first indicator of omething wrong then me and my brothers are shooed to the basement and are told not to come up. Basically the cancer is not getting better. 2nd remember the guy from the last entry?? course u do well right now were just gonna be friends cuz hes got stuff to sort out and ive got stuff to sort out. Emily has also completely absolved herself from this whole thing which she *indirectly without meaning to* started *though i think she may have actually done it on purpose but im probably just being paranoid* im not gonna expand to much on it cuz itll just make me spaz out and go all grade 9 on my ass yes on myself u heard me right. you get the picture on that. Been trying in school and im very surprised at myself go me woot woot. I just feel like right now i have noone to talk to about this because if I bring up something i either get yelled at for it and it just gets ignored as if the people im talking to just hope that it will go away but it wont Ive been feeling this way since end of grade 9 and it hasnt gone away with everyone ignoring it so ive hidden it cuz i dont want people to worry and the only reason im writing this down here is because noone ever reads this thing lol its for my own personal use and it just helps me get everything out of my head so i can see it in writing and realise im not crazy.

Hey everyone been awhile i know sorry umm i have a bunch of quotes but my memory seems to be self-imploding becuz of the amount f inside jokes... Anyways today i went to work and i had a good time but i got punched in the nose *its hurt* lol and acquired many bruises. and now im babysitting my youngest bro Matthew and hes sick so its all the better :| right. so school sucks yet again but thats not necassarily anything new. I have come to the conclusions that Monty Python and the Holy Grail is the greatest movie ever that comes to mind at the moment and That the dumbest yet funniest group of idiots have to be the CKY crew *i luv the band too* right so i guess thats it for now

Umm where to start... ok i had to go to camp this weekend that was pretty bad i had to see ben :S:S it was so awkward i hated it. ooo i feel so bad its amaznig how fast ppl can grow apart when u havent rlly talked to them in a long time isnt it? i guess its something you have to learn the hard way make sure u always talk to ur friends cuz if u dont the next time u do talk u may just be acquaintinces its sad when u think about it. so neways im workiong this week so i wont be around to update or rlly do nething else early mornings and late nights whoopie :| notice my enthusiasm... this is really bothering me  we used to be such good friends its only been like 2-3 months since weve had a complete conversation and so much has changed and no im not only blaming it on him i realise its my fault too. i mean i couldve made conversation with him too rite? it was the whole... thing good lord she hates us lol i really shouldnt laugh about that. Another thing that is bothering me is that Samantha *Sam* is leaving. They are moving to kitchener its like hours away i wont ever see her they moved today she tried to see if she could stay with Conna *her ex-step-mom* but she couldnt. Im so close to crying its not even funny im losing my best friend becu of a stupid decision made by an immature man. But i have to consider his feelings as well it wouldve hurt donna more in the end if he hadnt told her that truth but y does he have to move them all the way out to kitchener?!?! now im just being selfish. O one funny thing that happened at camp one of the parents there wouldnt let me drink lemonade or peach drink becuz i wqas so hyper that i cpouldnt stop laughing and that i was laughing at something like cheerios it was stupid but soo funny at the time neways im tired and i have to get up before 6 tomorrow so im gonna go ttyl

Today ive come to the conclusion that im pretty much alone in this life. Noone really knows wats going on in my life and thats fine. I prefer it that way its the only way i avoid questions that i dont want to answer. How have i come to this conlusion u may ask? Its very simple. You see I go to school everyday its a bitter and pointless cycle that repeats itself everyday except for the odd pause called the weekend and exams and holidays but other wise its the same. You see the same people doing the same thingas and gotten absolutely horrible for me to see... some people day after day after day. I hate it. Its like made me bitter

Ok hey ppl hope you had a great christmas cuz i kno i didnt. My grandfather ended up in the hospital with a blood clot my other grandfathers cancer got worst but hes putting up a brave face. i got a lot of jewelry and i also- got a $200 gift certificate to limeridge mall, cds, and underworld awesome movie i love it, i lvoe vampire flicks... i was readin through old entries in my Diary *an actual book not online* and came across one  in particular that i thought was interesting:

""You think you know me, eh? You know everything about me? Did you know that i have a mole behind my right ear? Do you know who my first crush ever was? Do you kno who i trust most in this world? Did you know that at night when im alone in the dark, allowed to think about my life in quiet that I cry? I cry when i can't stnad to hurt myself anymore...""

Thats not all of it but I can't put the rest up. For reasons. I got a book, chicken soup for the teenage soul its good its kind of odd to read stories about other teens. It was odd reaing through my old entries. Reading about peoiple that i used to kno and be really close with and now i dont even talk to them on the phone or msn. And then i think about if they ever think about me if they ever wonder about what im doing i kno one person who never does and never will and some day ill do the same about him. To think we used to be so close same with his sister. Me and her are only 17 days aprat by age me and him are 2 years and 20 days. They recently moved closer and farther from me at the same time. Theyll be going to the highschool that i was supposed to go to. at least untill i moved here. i kno it was the right thing now to do. But at the time i thought it was the end of my life that i would never make friends that id never survive. But i did. And i made so many great and wondeful supporting friends ones that are still with me till this day. and i love them for it. i kno im difficult. and i want to thank you all for being there for me through all those hard times and i will always be there for you. a special thanks goes out to kim for in grade 7 when my mom gave Jasmine away lol i miss her. anyways thats it i think so yah Luv ya all

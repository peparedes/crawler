"event","yea so me and Justin broke up for good today.I guess it was for the better? I was always letting him down and pissing him off and I just want him to be happy and if this is the way then thats it!Im not begging for him back this time.I do every time.If he really ever decides he wants me back he can come to me. Anyways yea im really sad but I gotta learn to get over being sorry for myself.I love him very much but this is the way it is.
As Justin says ""fuck love cuz it fucked me""    he is SO right!

fuck love.
fuck you.
fuck it.
fuck everything.
it didnt mean a thing.
none of it.






blah.i hate myself for losing him but i guess its for the best.im just gonna try n look at it in the best way possible this time because it doesnt help shit to walk around all depressed about it.He knows I still love him and always will and if he doesnt then now he does.



Trying to make the best of things.later."

"event","yea so life sucks cock for me right now Im not going into major detail.But me and Justin broke up....Im crushed all I do is cry whethere Im takling to him or not.Capri's boyfriend Richard sent me a messege.Saying a bunch of stuff like how I could do better and how I shouldnt be with him (he didnt know we broke up) and how he wants to introduce me to his friends....riiiight.weird.then i look at the comments on my pictures and another one of there friends left me a comment under Justin's pick that says my everything and he was all like ""you can do better than that hahahaha"" wtf....who are these people? It seems like every single person i talk to says I deserve better than him but...thats not how I feel.I love him for more than anything in the whole entire world and no one is going to make me change my mind about him.I got a speeding ticket on my way to Austin yesterday morning.I gotta figure out a way to get around telling my grandma about that.She's already pissed cuz I got home late last night.Feel like drowing myself in drugs.Then all my problems would dissapear.at least temporairily.Ugh I hate my life...I can say it officially and seriously I really and truly hate my life.But i still and always will love Justin."

"event","So this weekend had been pretty awesome! I got to spend most of it with Justin which makes everything wonderful. Friday I went to Summer School then came straight home, headed to S Austin to pick up My baby, Alonzo and Gabby and then we all went to Schlitterbahn! LOL it was a BLAST! WE had so much fun just being stupid and crazy! then we ate at Chilli's and then I had to take them home...it hurts so bad dropping Justin off. I hate it almost more than anything in the world. Just not knowing when EXACTLY Ill see home again is the pits!!!! Blah...but neways I got home at like 12 30 am and went to sleep.
So......
The next day (Saturday) I woke up and started getting ready for the day because I wanted to see my love!!!So I want to buy him a Spurs jersey right?! Because its like his favorite team in the world so yea I go to Lakeline to try and find him one and SUPRISE SUPRISE! They are all OUT!!!! In all 4 stores I went to!!! I was soooo pissed! So I was going to try and go to HIghland on my way to see him...because its like a black mall and they HAVE to have them but Justin calls and says to screw it he misses me and wants to see me so just hurry up! hehehe it was cute! i love him! So he talked to me on the phone the WHOLE time as I was driving down there and I went to his house....we had a lil ""fun"" hehe lol and we kinda sorta not really watched Love Dont Cost A Thing (my favorite movie) he gives me my promise ring back :) which was pretty awesome! Then we go pick up Alonzo and drive to Kyles apt cuz Kyles car is in the shop so we chill there for awhile but me and Justin really wanted to go to the mall so we left them so they could come after they got Kyles car out of the shop. So we get there and my baby takes me to Foleys and is like I think they sell it here and Im like what? and hes like the perfume u wanted by Ralph Lauren....Dude I wanted the perfume sooooo bad dude!!!! But I had FORGOTTEN about it! I told him about this perfume like about 2 weeks ago and HE rememberd! So anyways he buys me this cute lil purse with the perfume,lotion,and shower gel in it AND a makeup back that matches the purse with everything that was in the purse in it but smaller! lol he's so great! Ive never had a guy treat me like this before! I feel like a Princess! :) Hes more than anything I could ever ask for! Well then Alonzo and Kyle show up and today is Alonzo and Gabbys 2 months so he wanted to get her a present and we looked and looked and looked and we all came to the conclusion that she is HARD AS FUCK to shop for so he decided to Build her a Bear well....actually and Elmo lol it was the cutest thing in teh WHOLE world! He was so excited and happy lol he looked like a little kid! it was GREAT! Then we went to find Justin's daddy a birthday present and my babys got style so he got him a nice nice shirt with a matching tie! It looks hot! lol Then we went to some weird Asian Grill downtown and then we went to the drag and then.... I went home 
:(....oh well maybe if Im lucky I can see him today! Now I must go brainstorm a way for me to do that!!!!

lol


have a nice day!!!


:) I love u Justin!!!!"

"event","Yea so obviously me and Justin are back together.Man you guys...Im so fucking in love with that kid.I dont even understand it sometimes and it sucks because I want so bad to explain to him how much I love him and why.But is truly unexplainable.He's the most important thing in my life right now and I am willing to do whatever it takes to make him happy.My grandma isnt exactly his biggest fan.BUT! Guess what?! I DONT GIVE A FLYING FUCK!!!!She keeps yelling at me and griping at me about things that have to do with him I guess she's thinking that I will get tired of it and break up with him...FAT CHANCE! It would take an act of God for me to break up with him. I sit around and he will come into my mind and I will just remember the way we last hugged or kissed and a smile will instantly come across my face.Its funny how he does this to me. I love loving him.Always and Forever.


Justin and Ashton...FOREVER!"

"event","So yea you know how I said Justin was comming to see me for my birthday party today?! Well he did! Along with Kyle! I got a really good feeling because as soon as he got here he gave me a hug and a kiss! We had a BLAST! We got along so well and had so much FUN! Like we played around with eachother and just enjoyed eachothers company. It was GREAT! Well anyways we ended up having a lil ""chat"" and he finally asked me back out!!!!! I said YES! DUH! lol So now we are back together and I really have a strong feeling that this times going to be different and so much better! I really do! Because these changes that I have been making are REALLY pleasing him and TRUST ME....they are definatly here to stay!!!! I am sort of in a way happy this break happend because I think in a way it kind of renewed our love and everything. We both got to see what it would be like without the other and everything and Im pretty sure neither one of us enjoyed it too much. At least I know I didnt! Now I know what I did wrong and I know what I have to do in order to make him happy and keep him happy and this time Im giving it my all in doing that because thats all that matters to me! I get my license on Wed and Im hoping to jet down to South Austin or something this weekend somehow I dunno we'll see! I just found out my g-mas going out of town so that is VERY good!!!! :) Im just so happy! I start Summer school tomorrow! BLAH! GEY! But oh well everything will be much better and everything now that I have my baby back! I know I will be much better!!!!!!! I love him so much and I am going to do everything in my power to make sure he KNOWS that!!!!

But whats EXTREMELY hard.Is having so many questions and things that I want to say to him locked up inside of me.Im just scared of the response Im going to get and Im really scared that I may say something that pushes him even farther away. Trust me they arent bad things.But right now I dont want to do anything to risk messing up anything that we have right now.If I dont get him back...Im literally going to go insane. :(  Yall....I want my baby back.Seriously it bothers me because no one REALLY understands HOW MUCH I want/need him. I feel so empty and alone now.Its so hard.Its honestly slowly killing me inside.And its not his fault.But seriously.The day he ended it my heart was torn in two and with each day that goes by it seems as if my heart deteriorates a little bit more.Slowly falling apart.I miss him so much.I just want my Justin back.I pray every night for that to happen but...every day that passes makes my hopes go down a little bit more.Because.I know he wants me to change and I think I already have.Im not saying that I cant go farther and change more because thats what Im going to do and am doing.But its so hard not beig with him.

"event","So today I woke up and got ready. Went to court! Got to see ALONZO and GABBY! YAYNESS! lol we all got our court date set back untill July 19th! cool i guess. So Im still grounded but its not as bad as yesterday. Like I think she was just really mad and everything because she is already starting to give me back my privilages! Which is good! I get to KEEP my CAR! she just said there were going to be some restrictions on it at first which is cool with me as long as I get to keep my car. I still get my license next Wed! Coolness! So everything is cool with all that right now. But Im still not allowed to talk on the phone or on the internet! I still talk on the net but I gotta be sneaky about it and I only talk on the phone at night and thats just to Justin because well...he's Justin,he comes first...DUH! lol but I have to sneak it. We talked last night for quite a while and it was nice. Just hearing his voice made me feel better.Thats just one of the funny things I love about him.He can do the smallest things like smile or say hello when he answers the phone and a smile automatically comes to my face.hehe.he makes me giggle.love that kid so much.People have been telling me things like ""screw him"" ""you deserve better"" and all this bullshit and Im just like....GO TO HELL! Like ALL OF YOU! BTW let this be a warning before you even THINK about saying a bad thing about Justin to me.think again.Because I have been going off on people left and right.Even some of my friends.We may be broken up but I still love him and I'm still down for him just like I said I always would be.Anyways.Back on subject we've been talking (as friends) like we agreed because he wants to do that so I can show him that I am changing...i hope he sees it. But we have been having some pretty nice chats.Like maybe he's right.Maybe this ""break"" or ""space"" or whatever you want to call it is going to be good for us.Before we broke up I was just taking advantage of what I was getting and what I had.He's love,care,and affection were not something he HAD to give me.They were something he CHOSE to give me.It wasnt his ""job"" to treat me the way he did.He did it because he wanted to and he knew that was right and I didnt really do anything to return his genorous actions.Next time.I will be sure and return them.You can count on that.I guess I never really relized how true the saying--""you never know what you have untill you dont have it anymore"" was.I knew what I had.I knew it was something special and genuine but I didnt really show it.I miss him so much but this is the price I pay for being selfish.Changes are being made whether he see's them or not.I hope he does.But if he doesnt.All it tells me is I need to try even HARDER than I already am. Because like I said before, all I want is my baby back.
And Im willing to fight to my death to get it.


BTW!!!!! My mommy called me and she is comming home December 1st and we are moving to South Austin over Christmas break! Ill be at Akins second semester for SURE! See ya then bitches! :)

Me and Justin TALKED! it was great. made me feel so much better because he's ""not promising me anything"" (which is to be expected) but he still sort of gave me hope. Its weird. I guess I got a fucked up roll or something because my Asthma was kicking my ass bad all night and I couldnt breathe very well. But like all night he was caring for me and everything just like he did when we were together but...it was different. i dunno. Maybe im just being dumb.lol suprise suprise. But man. All I can keep asking myself is WHY?! did i do the things I did to him? and WHY?! did i say the things i said to him? and HOW?! could i be so careless as to lose something so perfect. (in my eyes)  Today when my grandma found out about the citation i was still in Austin. I FREAKED had like a nervous breakdown (real mature) but I couldnt help it. I was comming down and It seemed like my whole world was crashing down around me. He was there for me, After all I did, My ""Prince"" came to my rescue once again. I know if he wouldnt have been there I would have fallen apart. I dont know how to repay him for everything he's done for me. I will figure out something. Im giving him his space. Its hard HELL yea! Its freaking hard! BUT if thats what he needs then thats what Im going to give him. He knows where I stand. He knows that I love him. And he knows Im ready and waiting for him whenever he's ready to give it one more try. If he even decides to.


I love him...with all my heart.


hope things work out. i just gotta be patient....




i LOVE justin!"

"event","its sad...that it took me losing the best thing in the world for me to realize and its sad...that i waited untill it was too late to realize all of these things. Bu at least it happend. This whole time I was accusing him of changing and ""not being the same person i fell in love with"" but all along...it was me. I was honestly to blind to see and I was honestly too stuck up my own ass to see that I was the problem and that I was the one who had changed....and now...I am the one who needs to be ""fixed"" I accused him of things that I was doing...who the fuck does that? Im dumb...like REALLY DUMB! I would get MAD at him for telling me I was stupid or acting stupid but now I feel stupid because...I really was. There are a lot of things in me that I am going to work on. He gave me everything he could. And I was stupid and through it all away. I am not accusing him of being the problem anymore. Because now i know, i was and always have been. And Im not saying that just to make him feel bad. Its the truth and I KNOW it. Right now I am only focused on two things. The things that I need to change in me...and what I am going to do to get my baby back. When the Mariah Carey song came out I was like ""oh yea i love this song its perfect"" without ACTUALLY listening to the lyrics. Lately it seems that song comes on every five seconds. This song is EXACTLY the way I feel now. He's gone. I pushed him to the edge. And I dont know what I am going to do without him. I always said he made me complete. I guess I never realized just how true that statement was until now that I've lost him. I dont like to smile.I dont like to laugh.I dont even talk very much anymore.I just want Justin back. I love him.So much. Now.its up to me to prove my love to him. Like i had him to time and time again (which was wrong) Im changing. He's still and always will be...my everything.
I am going to admitt to everyone who reads this and Ill keep admitting it untill I turn blue in the face. I was WRONG the WHOLE time! I hurt the one person that ever REALLY cared about me and REALLY loved me. My BEST friend.

I love you Justin...and I alaways will...


""when you left i lost a part of me.its still so hard to believe. Come back baby please cuz' we belong together.""


You know we do.

I love you."

"event","I fucked up. I always fuck up. And I understand. I brought all of this on myself. I love him so much. God knows how much I love him but I guess love really wasnt enough. I just made myself look like a complete fool. I did something I NEVER thought that I would do. I sat in front of a boy...not just any boy. THE boy. The guy I thought that I could very possibly spend the rest of my life with. And I begged him. I begged him not to leave me. I made him so many promises. I said and did everything I could possibly think of to make him take me back. But I guess sometimes words  just arent enough.All I want is to have him back. I just want to be with him. I know I promised him I would change and shit before. And I meant it. But I was born a screw up and I failed. But I KNOW so help me God I KNOW that I could and would chnage this time. Yea. Its fucked up that it took something like this to really make me try with all my mite and I know that I should have tried my hardest before. But I didnt and that is my fault. He says he needs his space...damn...he says i pushed him to that point. Thats just like me to do something like that.   God i'm rambling...I want my baby back. Thats all I want. I would give up ANYTHING and do ANYTHING just if he could take me back. I know I could be the perfect girl that he wants. I KNOW I could.

God please...
please
please...

Give Justin back to me.

I love him more than I have ever loved anyone or anything in my life. And I always will. I dont know what I am going to do tonight. I promised him that I wouldnt do anything stupid so I am trying with everything I have not to because the last thing I want to do is break another promise to him.

God please make him realize.

I love you Justin. Forever. When I said forever. I meant it.

I always will


JUSTIN PHILLIP CARREON I LOVE YOU!!!!! and i always will...

please call me sweetheart. I love you."

"event","i just read Justin's latest journal entry. GREAT! seems like i am about to lose him. ONCE AGAIN! only this time maybe its for good? i dont want to lose him but if we dont come to a compromise soon then im thinking i will...and if things to get better and we cant come to a compromise...and we do.break up...maybe its for the better? I dont want to lose him. I love him more than anything. I just need my space right now. Is that too much to ask for?  He's mad because he thinks i am ""using him for his money"" because i told him he has more money than me so why cant he take the cab for once and come see me. Thats what i did all last weekend....Just because I missed him and wanted to see him. I love him so much. But he is just....mean...i dunno whats gotten into him. Maybe the same thing that he says has gotten into me?! All i know is that if he is really feeling as bad as he says he is. Maybe he should just end it now. Does he not realise that the longer he waits the harder its going to be on me. I honestly dont know what I would do without him...I really dont want to think about what I would do without him. But from what he's sayin its lookin like im going to have to be thinkin about that kinda stuff. oh well hunnny...the rest is up to you."

(pix at bottom) i love it! it goes fast!lol I cant believe it! MY FIRST car! now NO more bumming rides off of people! I got one of my own!!!! :) Too bad i cant drive it legally for like 2 more weeks! BUT STILL! I HAVE MY OWN CAR! 

 Speaking of cars and licenses my baby FINALLY got his permit today! CONGRATS SWEETHEART! lol i love u! 

Bad like always the good news comes with the bad...My mom is going to be in jail for longer than expected so its going to take like an act of God for me to be able to start school at Akins in August! Im still trying everything I can! i wanna be with my friends and i wanna be able to see my baby every day!!!! So if anyone has any ideas or suggestions please let me know! I really wanna go there next year! So please help!!!! 

Yea so I talked to my EX best friend a few minutes ago...some shit never changes. it amazes me how i could have ever been her best friend. All she does is lie and she thinks she is so grown up and so mature when in all reality...she isnt at all! She thinks she is so much older than me...She's just 16....doesnt even turn 17 till the end of January! I mean! Come the fuck on Amanda Nicole! We have known eachother forever and the whole time i've known her she has been a pathelogical liar. I dont know about this time because it is like her to do something this dramatic. Supposdly she is now engaged to her (just now 17 ur old rich boyfriend) they have only been together not even as long as me and Justin. Apparently he is loaded and she is now wearing a 4000$ engagement ring on her finger. WTF EVER! I told her i have a promise ring so i guess she had to out-do me! Suprise suprise. well FUCK YOU and have a nice day Amanda I dont give a fuck! I am very happy with my ring! WHO CARES! how much it is our how many diamonds it has in it! Get this somewhere in our convo she even through in ""well urs only has 3 diamonds mine has 9!!"" i was like ""and????....::long pause::"" i think she felt dumb. Its just a ring and if she needs a ring to make her feel better about her relationship or more secure or whatever. Thats her issue but seriously if yall knew this girl...UGH! u would know what im talking about my FAMILY doesnt even like her. She is like on my Aunts nuts and shit cuz she works at her school im just like dude...back the fuck up OFF my fucking Aunt u dyke-bitch!!! whatever! I dunno she pulls shit out of her ass...she told me her bf already found the house he is probably going to be buying for them...i KNOW her parents...WELL! They fucking almost sent her out of state to a boarding school when they caught her making out with her bf last year... like they are really gonna let her be engaged and move in with her boyfriend...FAT CHANCE!!!!!! whatever...she is dumb...lol oh yea. I offered to go pick her up so we could ""hang"" like old times cuz i really wanted to see this big ass movie star ring but she has to ""clean her room"" RIGHT...she has lived in a pig sty since we were in 5th grade...ugh whatever! ppl make me sick!!!!!!!!! 


On a lighter note!!!! heres some pics of my car!

"event","wow he's hard to explain maybe thats what draws me to him. We fight or...fought ALOT! But ever since Monday...we havent. Maybe he was being true when he said ""this time its going to be different"" that he's really ""going to change"" because it already seems as if he has. And i know in my heart that he has potential to change. With help, time, and a little bit of guidance. And i am willing to help him and stand by him and have the patience with him. Because i LOVE him and i know he loves me. I think that maybe what happend this weekend was good for us or our relationship. Because we both now REALLY know what could happen and what we would feel like if we lost eachother. I love him forever and I dont ever want to risk losing him again...I love him...so so much...

"event","well its Tuesday...i was supposed to be home Sunday...and yea...my ""wonderful way to kick off the summer"" fuckin did me in the ass. Like u see all those probs with Justin like the next morning after he hit me i tried to talk to him about it and he was being stubborn and so i ended up ending it... (knew it wouldnt last im in love and he's like an addiction) but yea like he was mean and said he never wanted me calling him again bleh bleh bleh...anyways i REALLY wanted to see him so i could talk 2 him in person so maybe we could figure things out cuz we like very VERY rarely fight in person maybe like once... neways me, Gabby, and Alonzo basically set Justin up and Alonzo convinced him to come to his house and not tell Justin we were comming too...thank you Alonzo u rock my socks off! Anyways me and Gabby take a cab there and shizzle and it was like awkward and i tried to like ""break the ice"" with him cuz he wouldnt even look at me he was just staring out the window so I was like ""hey little momma"" and then the room was like....silence... it was weird because we are never quiet...Anyways we talked and talked and then he took me to the Computer and started playing all of ""our songs"" and i was trying sooooo hard to be strong and not seem so desperate and eager to get back with him so i was trying to act like i didnt care...I couldnt...he could see right through that act...he knows me too well sometimesits freaky...like he can read my mind...After a while of that and us talking we came to a compromise he asked me back out and bleh bleh bleh...we all lived happily ever after...well at least us as a couple did...im still screwed and dunno what to do ill get to that in a second. Anyways we are back together and yea we were only broken up for like uuuuh....2-ish hours but it was the hardest and most painful of my life. I went all retarded and freaked and i was like ugh ""im gonna cut"" and he was like DONT! and i was like ""i dont have to listen to u anymore"" (this was b4 we went to Alonzos) but yea i ended up cutting...it was bad...ugh..im stoopid. Later i went to his house and stuff and we chilled for a couple of hours and his dad came in the room and talked to us about like ""our decisions and life"" it really wasnt that bad. I feel much much better now. Like his dad made me feel really good he was all like telling me ""he loves me"" and like since i dont have a dad i can come to him for things like u should ask ur dad. I dunno he made me feel really good...Justin is really lucky...ugh...man....depressing...Anyways..Im back in Leander I still havent told my g-ma bout the ticket...dunno what im gonna do...but i already miss Justin and im fucking tired cuz i spent the night at Alonzos and we stayed up till like 3:45 talking and then i woke up at 7 sumthin so i could see my hunny! Sooo yea im gonna go sleep untill he comes home from ACC!

"event","so yea...its Monday and im still in Austin...Im still at Gabbys house right now which is cool because it is MUCH better than being at home. Why?! you may ask....well Saturday night me,justin,alonzo,gabby and some other people went to that rave called SM!LE which shouldve been a baddass way to start off the Summer. Well, it turned into the reason that pretty much ALL four of our Summers got fucked. To sum it all up...we went...we rolled...it started storming.... BAD! We left (still rolling) Alonzo was driving Kyles car (which we were all in) Alonzo and Gabby had to tinkle...lol... but thats their fault i kinda think we got a couple of fucked rolls...but neways. The gas station wouldnt let us in cuz we were all covered in mud. So we decide to drive to Gabbys and clean up b4 we go to an after party...we got smart and decided to drive down 8th...they couldnt hold it! lol but neways...we parked in an alley on 8th Alonzo and Gabby started tinkling...AND THE COPS SHOWED! lol it was funny at first cuz the cop was all...""miss pull up your pants"" lol i wanted to run...but didnt. yea, She's a baller i love her lol Alonzo too! but then they like arrested us and gave us all tickets! yea GEY! the REALLY funny thing...Gabby and Alonzo got tickets for Curfew and get this.... URINATION IN A PUBLIC PLACE! LMFAO lol i wish i coulda gotten one for that. lol! But neways after they arrested us not only were we all 15...out at 3:15 in the morning, pissing in alleys...the car we were driving was our friends...WHICH IS BTW IN JAIL! oooopsy! :) and THEEEEEN!!!!! the plates on the car were to a Mistubishi...too bad the car we were driving was a NISSAN ALTIMA! so yea Alonzo and Justin were in one cop car and they were gonna get charged with Grand Theft Auto...not cool that would mean they would both be in Juvy till they were 18... :( i would die...but at least Juvy is right by where i live lol But yea..long story short we are all gonna be grounded, im probably not gonna be getting a car, and i probably wont be seeing Justin for a long time...hot damn... :( shoot me? me and Gabby got home and we were scared of staying at her house alone so our friend Zack comes and gets us and we go over to a ""friends house"" so we can be around other people and feel safe...too bad it was like a lil more than a couple of friends...which Justin considers a party and BTW im not allowed to go to parties (Justin's rule)

WAIT! it gets even worse!!!!

so the next day me,Gabby,Candice, and Alonzo decide to take a cab to Justins house because i really missed him and wanted to make sure he was ok...yea...so much for even like trying to take care of him and make him feel better. I tell him about the little what he calls (party) and he fucking HITS me not once but TWICE! he cusses at me and makes me come to the other room...Lots of people are telling me to straight up break up with him...Some are saying tell him if he lays a hand on me again its over...its not that easy...people dont understand...I LOVE HIM! so fucking much! And i will do anything I can to keep our relationship. The last thing i wanna do is lose him...I just dunno...my ex hit me...ALOT...and he ended up breaking up with me and making me feel retarded. People are mad...really mad...im not...i dunno why... maybe because i DID deserve it?! After all..i did go to that ""party"" but i didnt know it was going to be as big as it was...i guess it all comes down to trust...and in a way...i betrayed his? NO i didnt cheat on him...never could never would...but i did go against his wishes and go to that so called party. ummm i just dunno nemore? like he has been what people are calling ""verbally abusing me"" for a month or so now...o try n talk to him about it...but nothing ever changes...like completely...I LOVE him you guys...more than i've ever loved anything in the world. I dont want to lose him...but he cant keep hitting me and cussing at me and things...it hurts...i dunno...i love him...maybe sometimes love just isnt enough. I think it all the time but now I am really starting to believe it. Maybe the one person that I at least ""felt"" cared for me and loved me and supported me...doesnt even care...or love me...at all...you dont hurt the people you love. Not purposly...not mentally...and definatly not physically...I could never hurt him...thats why i didnt hit him back...

i love him

everyone knows it

he knows it

GOD knows it....

help???

what should i do???

i want to stay with him...

but he cant continue to do this...

oppinions please???

im in like a heavy state of depression. and i have been for two days now...i want to cut...i need to cut...but i wont...cuz he tells me i cant... life sucks... shoot me?



i love him....always...."

I dont think anyone understands how much i love this boy but he is seriously hurting me to the point where i dont know what to do anymore. It's making me....mean...and i dont think i like that. Use to, it would take A LOT to ever get me to hang up on ne1 ESCPECIALLY him! but now...its not so hard anymore...i guess its just because i am getting tired of everything. I really want to make this work and i have TRIED and TRIED and TRIED...i have dont everything i can possibly think of to make him happy and to make our relationship which i know has potential to be wonderful and last forever, i know this because thats how it used to be, i mean i have gone to the point of saying ""im sorry"" and not even knowing what im sorry for just so he wouldnt be mad at me anymore and saying ""its my fault"" or ""i was wrong"" when i know its not. I love him so god damn much. More than i have ever fucking loved anyone or anything in my life! all i want for him to do is be NICER...like seriously is that too much to ask???? I dont wanna be put down anymore, i dont want the smart alike remarks, i dont want him to try and prove every single thing i say wrong. All i want is RESPECT and i used to get that...but no, not anymore. Sometimes....but not often. And im sorry if thats asking to much... again IM SORRY! I just want to be happy...and im not anymore. i love him....if he doesnt know it...and no one else does....GOD knows how much i love him! seriously...i dont know what i would do without him! be happier??? HIGHLY DOUBTFUL! be lessed stressed and not always worrying about our next fight....possibly. I just dont know what to do anymore. like i said. im willing to do anything to make our relationship last. But first we need to come to a compromise. And he's obviously not willing to do that. God...how can i love someone that hurts me this much?...maybe im just stupid...he often reminds me of that. please God....just help me....i want to be with him...i want us to make it...i want US to be happy... No matter what happens between us...I will never stop loving him. EVER no matter what anyone says...he's my whole world. WHY am i such a bitch?! WHY am i always wrong?! WHY is he always mad at me?! WHY do i have so many faults?! WHY cant i make him happy?!....out of everything in the world...thats what i want...i just want to make him happy...and i know im not succeeding at that.


i still love him as much as i always have and will continue to love him...

~~My Prayer~~

God...please help us make this last...

ill do anything...

just dont let this tear us apart...

ANYTHING! ill give up getting my license, getting a car, having my mom come home, everything i own, everything i've always wanted...

EVERYTHING! just please God...dont take him away from me. I need you now more than ever.

I love him. I really do...'

i guess all i can see is thank you, for sending him to me for that time that you have.

i dont wanna lose him. i love him

My family thinks i have ODD its like Opositional Defiant Disorder or some shit like that. Basically it means is my mom fucked me up by being a crackwhore/alcoholic while she was pregnant with me so now I am really aggressive. I fight. I argue. I dont get along with people. and blah blah....whatever its GEY! but yea now my family is going all anal on me and saying they want to ""get me help"" and so they are going to send me to a therapist...they can shove that shit right back UP their asses! If anyone needs therapy its THEM! whatever like i said...GEY! I've been really stressed out cuz my grades are all fucked up and i've been kicking my ass trying to bring them back up; which i am succeeding buuuuut i still have to take Summer School because of Bio and Geometry first sememster. Im really fustrated because its less than a month till my Sweet 16 and shit and my g-parents are getting me a car and my license for my birthday and I dont even know what KIND of car that I WANT! Whatever as long as i get one im fine.... My mom is in jail and shit and she made all these promises to me (as she does every time she goes to jail) she was saying that once she gets out (this time) we are going to have a ""real relationship"" ok whatever that means... You see the only time I am happy is on the weekends and thats because i am usually in South Austin with my oh so very wonderful boyfriend Justin! I am SO effing in love with that boy you dont even know! But it sux cuz we live 40 miles away from eachother and shit...BUT back on subject...mi madre said that when she gets out we will move to Austin so i can go to Akins with my bebe and i can be with my ONLY friends...well TOO BAD she doesnt even KNOW if shes getting out this summer!!!! Gah she is so retarded...whatever i hate everyone...except Justin....I dunno...life is pretty much suckin balls right now the only things im looking forward to are SUMMER! MY LICENSE! SM!LE next weekend with my bebe and friends! and just seeing my bebe! I love him so fucking much but its so hard being so far away. But oh well my love is strong enough to last!

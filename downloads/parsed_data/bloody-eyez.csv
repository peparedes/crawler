"event","ok so where to start. susie picked me up we went and got money from my mom, food, and gas. then i drove all the way to toledo from dublin. it was suppossed to have been a 3 hour drive but i made it a 1 1/2 hour drive.. opps. so we get there in toledo and needed to go to the restroom. we didnt want to be like the only people in the club but it was only like and hour or so til flex played so we drove around looking for a bathroom. WRONG we were in BFE. the GHETTO!! so we couldnt find a bathroom and went to the club. we get there and walk in theres jerod he was like hi and all that stuff. then we come out and susie decided to go get her a drink and jerod was like umm have u talked to amanda yet, i was like no.. he was like she is in the hospital....YIKES!! so that bummed us out a lil bit. me and susie sat down for a while and just kinda looked at the whole 30 people if that there. mike, jerod, tommy and marty all came over and talked to us. then susie went and ended up getting someone elses drink and going to hunt that person down cause they had hers.. sooo then all of a sudden brit walks threw the door and i was like YAY! so then like after 2 mins of standing there talkin shaun pops in the door like hi.. so they guys get ready to go on stage and we went and got FRONT AND CENTER BABY!! and these girls are like who is coming up and blah blha blha. so i told them and they all walked off which gave us plenty of room. so i was sitting there talking to britt and all of a sudden someone grabs my neck turned around and it was this drunk guy he was like are you here to see bobaflex and i was LIKE YEA and he still had ahold of my neck and tommy just kinda looked at me cause he could see that i was a bit startled and just kept an eye on me. so then they go on and hell breaks loose. i got the shit beat out of me and did it hurt. but i think susie got the best. i cant tell ya what happened but all i will say is she got hit good. i dont want to spoil her story. so they guys get off i take pics of britt with all of them and then we go sit over by the bar.. had some ugly ass dudes hitting on us and all that stuff. so then susie steals a jager hat and runs and sits with us.then we waited for a bit.. jerod came over and talked to me FOREVER AND DO I MEAN FOREVER> then marty kept throwing paper at me. then he comes over and talks.. he was like do u see my teeth.  the label paid to get them fixed and i love it. he was so happy to have his teeth fixed it was cute. he was like i feel better about myself i smile all the time.. so we got a pic of all the guys and sat around for a bit talking to em.. got some crazy pics of the guys thats for sure. anywho we go outside after talking to the guys for a while and there was the guy susie stole the hat from. he talked ot us for about half hour and it was some funny shit. his name was Spink and his friends name was CRazy. lol so they told us how to get to taco bell and we got there.. we followed them for a bit then they decided to go into a porn store and me and susie was like ummm no and just kept going. so we get to taco bell and we almost finish eating when Crazy gives susie a heartattack. so we finished eating then all of a sudden there they were right next to us. we talked ot them for a long time. somehow in the talking and everything there ended up being a pissin contest between susie and Spink. haha that was some funny shit.. susie WON OF COURSE. so we went to leave and susie was like wait i want a pic of them.. so we take a pic and first thing we saw was HIS WHITE ASS!! then they took a real pic.. the guy was like wait i want a pic of u next to ur pee. grosss. so we left and that was that. we got onto i think maybe 68 or something and i was looking for another highway and i was like lost.. lol so we ended up turning around twice and the second place i turned around in was a driveway and they had a horse mail box. so we drive and end up at a gas station and susie finds out taco bell stoel her credit card. so yea we go and call and end up home at about 5 AM which i made in an about 2 hours instead of about 3.. lol opps. oh yea marty yelled at me cause i drive fast he was like watch out girl.. lol i didnt kill me and susie and i dont drive that bad.. so yea there was the night it was interesting and cant forget it.. comment fools"

"event","So me and my dad pull at up at Alrosa at about 8:45 and had to park about 2 parking lots away. the place was packed and so was every parking lot around there. we get to the door and there is still people trying to get in. someone looks at me and my dad and was like if you dont have a ticket u cant get in, they said that they were packed and not allowing others in. well with 5 people left in front of us, we waited anyway and got in HAHA cause i am loved by rick and diane. anyway so they check me and take my camera from me but i got it back after a while.. we went in found carrie and talked to her for a bit. L3FT was on stage and Anthony was singing his song ""Wrapped on Lace"" i like that song. then Odious comes on. i got down to the floor and sadly I WAS IN THE PIT>>>>> haha oh well it was fine. but let me tell u there was a shit load of people in it. for a bit i stayed right there then i worked my way up to the front. Rick came on stage and Man did he get the place going... his birthday was yesterday and well he was just upset about his dad and what happened... soo i got right up front.. about half way in between where marty and shaun stand.. carrie was right behind me with joe and my dad was right behind me. BOBAFLEX goes on and the floor was packed. i think almost everyone that was at alrosa was on the floor. They called rick up to the stage and he started crying this time cause everyone had been screaming their heads off.  rick made a comment like"" one day we will have to get the cop in here"" no more then he said that the cop comes on stage.. rick about shit.. everyone was chearing ""hero hero hero"" and the cop just looked at everyone and then got off stage.. soon as he walked off shaun goes... this song is dedicated to officer Neggermeyer..Its called the GUARDIAN>> i bout shit i was like that my song... they sang that to him and that song said it all.. HE IS THE GUARDIAN THERE TO PROTECT US. man i think rick starting crying even harder.. and the cop did too.. so the show gets over and i had taken a mass amount of pictures and found shaun asked for a pic with them and got it. talked to becky for a while and some interesting things happened. got a pic of andrea oh yes by the way happy birthday hun. got pics of me and rick and pics of rick and the officer.. if u all want to check the pics out let me know and i will put the links up.."

"event","okay where to start.... how about friday night when i found out that my aunt Olena(shes from Ukraine) cant have kids. she went and drank i think 4 bottles of vodka to her self just walking round the house crying.. i feel so bad for her. see she just moved here about 2 years ago and married my uncle. well when she was younger(which she is only 23)she had a cyst in her tubes and it burst.. well she had surgery which left scare tissuse there and she cant drop her egss which means she cant have kids.. DID U KNOW THAT UKRAINE WAS 25 YEARS BEHIND US IN MEDICINE????? i didnt know that til she came over here.. but yeah that is alot of vodka i went to see her and she was jsut sitting there in her chair dead to the world.......ans she wont adopte cause its against her religion and she DOnt got the money to get UMMMM YEAH MADE PREG..18 thousand dollars a try.. 




anyway next thing i am talkign to butterfly/sitable one/keri/ cammy these conversations are intersting

talking to sitable one about seeing if she can come stay with me for *new years eve*.. this should be fun. i just hope her parents will let her come. i am gonna have my dad go pick her up in dayton then come back here and i am sure me and her will be.. wonder prolly up til god knows when talking about nothing.. but most of all i dont care what we do as long as i get to spend some time with my barbie...

this show that is coming up is great i need to go watch it i shall be back to talk later.. 

converation with butterfly: 
 we talked about me being sick and yeah that is great.. and we talked about what she did saturday night, her plans for new years, maybe all of us going to the beach one day, christmas, nicknames, her coming to columbus, mabe taking me out one day(since she still owes me), not having any monye, how ti get money,her coming and *playing* lawyer for me so i dont get kick out of school., ( i would be like i'll posocute your school for kicking her out) her lovely words of wisdom*, told her that i was just thinkning bout letting em* kick me out and then i will go to UD.. which would be Fucking AWSOME>> Cause i would get 2 see all my people all the time not once every 3 months or something like that..


KERI: talked about s and if he ever had mentioned his gf... WHICH HE NEVER HAS> noone that is close to them knows of her.. 
and how poor keri misses the guys cause she hasnt seen them in two months

JessIca: well she lives in PP WV and she doesnt even know of anyone named andrea that comes there. she knows TM and thats the only gf besides l that she knows of.. she said she thinks it might be something to keep *people* from bugging him

cammy!!!: huh? where to start. bout how her and her parents got into it and how she didnt knwo how to get ahold of me and sorry bout not taking me this weekend.. ummm how she isnt going to go to the thing new years eve cause she doesnt want to be around them anymore.. which is understandable... i gues.. but yeah 



as u can see as i was writing i got talking to more people.... i dont even remeber what else i got on here for..


the rest of this week and ladies i will know what the heck is going on with me ad this shitty school. i wish i would have thought about going to UD before i came here this summer... 

well i am off to bed i am sick and i need to get ready to take a HOT***** shower   

love ya girls"

YAY. so we left and we drove with marty to paynes house. he brought the new songs the demos they just got done recording and let us hear it..FUCKING AWSOME... LET ME TELL YA.. we are like the only three people who have got to hear the new shit besides the guys family, crew , and all that. cammy face was halarious when she heard the words to BRITE RED VIOLENT SEX.. i think she about had a heart attack in the car. the song is about well duh!!! anyway yeah it was a kick ass ride there to paynes.. we even sat in the car til all the songs were done. so we get there and sitable one and cammy decided to drink... to bad i am the youngin of the bunch. oh well i still had fun. cammy ran off to somewhere in the house talking to someone while me and sitable one sat there for a while talking.then we were spacing off to god knows where just like huh what to talk about or do.. so yeah..i got to meet shauns girlfriend Andrea.. she was really sweet and nice. shaun and i talked for a few about what i have been up to and all that.. i told him that i was in school(college) and he was like really and his girl was like where u go to school. i told her and she knew what classes they had and everything there.. it was strange.. but yeah. so he was like whats ur grades. i was like a's and b's he looked at me and smiled and gave me a pat on the back and was like LOOKS TO ME LIKE SOMEONE IS GOING SOMEWHERE IN LIFE.. so it was like 4 am and sitable one and i was asked by tubz to play packman.. well she decided to which was awsome.. and funny. the night went on and finally about 630 or so payne was like got to get some sleep here people.. so we passed out there for a while and about 10 or so me and cammy woke up and couldnt find sitable one..... lets just say this...looks like everyone had a fun time. some more than others *wink wink* lol yeah .. so on the drive home i was wore out and i think the girls were about to pass out on me.. but we all had alot of fun and talking to do.. 
oh yeah not to mention.. the guys kept asking me where callie and lynn where... i didnt know so i couldnt tell them.. me and marty had a long talk and seems to me that he missed callie alot and loves her to death still.. just by the way he talked and acted that is....<<<<

"event","hey gals i miss you all so much. i hate it here in the dorms at this school. we end up getting in so much trouble cause of stupid shit. i mean if people wpuld learn how to do the simplest things then we wouldnt have to be on lock down. i mean they dont even take their trash out to the right thing. come on grow up. anyway yeah i had a great time seeing you callie and caylin. i miss being able to talk to you all as much as i did. i feel like we are not close anymore. well in a sense thats what it feels like. it just feels really werid. but i know things move on i just hope we all can still be friends down the road with you alls new lifestyles coming along. i dont know i am just very depressed. well i want to be able to come and visit  you all here soon. i know that i will be getting my license real soon. YEAH i need it(cause we can't go anywhere right now) plus i can come on the weekends and visit. i was thinking maybe here in about 2 weeks you gals could come up here with me and stay. if there are other people around it is really easier to have fun, but when you only know your room mate and the one other gal in the dorm with you well it aint to fun. LOVE MY BARBIES. CALL ME HERE SOON AND WRITE ME."

I MEAN TOMMY HAS A GIRL, MARTY, MIKE,WELL JEROD AND SHAUN I AM NOT REALLY SURE ABOUTN BUT THE POINT IS WHY AE YOU REALLY GONNA GO AND DO THAT..I am so pissed i can eve see straight and watch this thing make no sense at all. but anyway. when i talked to cay last night she was so worried about mike and everything, wondering why he wouldnt talk to her and all that. why hasnt he called her. well all the things you worry about when you are in a realationship. i told her you dont think that maybe he did something and he regreting it or trying to hide it cause he feels bad do you? and she was like ""i dont really know"" well something to those lines... then today she went and found that shit i mean geeze i really dont think mike would do that to her. i mean she is the CUTEST< SWEETEST< ADORABLE< there  really aint enough words to explain it but this girl is everything any guys wants and everything a girl wants to be. she is so pretty and she is just the sweetest kind gentle person i think i have met. why would someone want to jeprodize what you have with a girl like that? maybe those girls are just a lil fucking dumb and think shit have happened. but i know that this is really hurting cay. she said that she is going to go to MN on the 17th and well that wouldnt be very good. she would beat the shit out of ol' girl. this girl  vented for half hour last night becasue he didnt talk to her. and today well she vented for a few mins but still. he is hurting that girl. i wish he would call her or something. i mean keep her worrying. i have to get off her for now i need to think about some thing and take care of some stuff. I <3 you CAYLIN... <3<3 luv you too callie :)"

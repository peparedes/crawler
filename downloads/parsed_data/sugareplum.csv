"event","the retreat was amazing!  except for the part that jess fell and couldn't get up and had to spend the entire weekend on crutches.  that was sad.  but, other than that, it was totally wonderful.  i think i'm actually starting to figure out the whole ""devote your life to glorifying God"" thing.  anyway, it was cool.  the walks at midnight were a little creepy, but we all survived.  ok, well, i guess it's time to write my senecabury tale."

"event","i really miss band.  like, i'm not even kidding.  i was actually starting to not suck, and i even won the march-off or whatever the hell they called it.  it kept me busy every weekend, and for another couple of weeks, i have nothing other than latin club, that jeopardy info challenge thing, chess club, drama, and youth grop.  and, i definately have play practice all week because mr. fiz is determined to teach us how to act.  jazz band will start soon and save me from this agony of having any free time.  and, swim team will meet every day, so i guess this lull will only last for like two weeks."

"event","i figured out like my entire life plan already, except the important stuff.  i know i want to live out west where there are farms and it's just...a different atmosphere.  i know i want a family and a quaint little house.  but, although i have perfectly planned out those aspects, i must have missed the part where i go to college and find a career that fits my personality.  i always thought that it would be amazing to be this elementary school teacher who woke up every morning to feed chickens, made breakfast, and then went off to teach little kids how to count with m&m's and read words.  but, in reality, i really don't see any of this dream happening anymore.  i mean, come on, it was made when i was like five.  50% of all marriages end in divorce, causing the liklihood of me being part of the little happy family to totally plummet.  then you have to consider the fact that being a teacher out west pays less than being an employee at walmart.  how am i supposed to buy chickens if i can't even support myself or a family?  the plan that got me through 11 years is finally proving unrealistic, and now i'm totally lost.

Anyway, I finally finished my National Honor Society packet.  I really hope that i make it in and achieve grades that will maintain my membership.

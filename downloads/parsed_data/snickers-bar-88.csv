When you know you're talented, isn't it borderline insulting to be handed something entirely too easy for you to do, especially when you're wanting to be challenged?

Am I being too narcissistic by saying that I know I'm talented? B/C if I am, that's not what I'm trying to convey.

If some certain people don't/can't pull of some amazing miracle transformations here within the next few months, even I won't go to something I'm supposed to go to.

"event","Ok, ok, I know, I flunk with the whole LJ writing thingy.  So shoot me.  I haven't written in a while b/c of band (5th at State!!)  and Rock Ensemble (A song *basically* all to myself Maroon 5~ Must Get Out) and now with the play/musical starting, I'll have even less time to do this writing stuff.  Anyway, a rundown of the latest events:


1. Fifth at ISSMA State Finals for Marching Band Class D
2. Rock Ensemble for Variety Show (Must Get Out, Walk the Walk, and Hey Mickey)
3. SOLO for Variety Show (Think of Me from Phantom of the Opera)
4. BIG space of NOTHINGNESS
5. Play tryouts (this year's production~ Bye, Bye, Birdie)
6. (if I get in) Play rehearsals from January to March(?)
7. Seeing Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire!!!! (Tom Felton... 'nuff said)
and all through this, I'm still single, can't drive yet (dunno why, partially don't want to, partially do, but can't get to License Branch due to school, practices, laziness, etc.) and get way too much sleep for a nearly 18 year old female (only 68 days left kids).

God, I need a life outside of music and drama.  Oh, I forgot, I go to TW, can't get rid of drama, it's what TW lives on.  But I meant musicals and plays.  And I can't get away from music, it's one of the only things I'm good at, at least singing is.

Nothing except Will & Grace is on, so I don't have anything to flip to on commercials.  I have no life, no good music to listen to, and no one here to talk to.  I wish I could move to somewhere interesting, (not that where I live currently is uninteresting, but ya know, it does get old after 14 years of living here).  I need something to do...

"event","Ok, so the 4th of July isn't here yet, but since I'm not gonna be here on the ""real"" 4th, I'm gonna type this in anticipation of said event.
     Well, the Pittsboro parade was today... and it was like Hell had come to Earth, that's how hot it was outside.  The humidity was a killer, too.  Of course, since we're in dark blue shirts (parade shirts, for those of you that remember what they are) we were all roasting.  It's not a long parade, it's usually just in the upper 80's to low 90's.  
     Anyway, the parade went well.  My family decided that instead of going to the fireworks in the park, we were going to go to my aunt Kathy's house in New Pal.  I watched my cousin, Austin, light stuff on fire, which was extremely amusing.
     So, now I'm just sitting here at their house, writing in my LJ b/c I have nothing better to do, and I don't want to go to sleep even though I'm really tired.  
     My little sister, Miriam, is sitting here beside me, just talking on her cell phone, (It's a TOY cell phone, sheesh, did you really think that we gave the five-year-old a real cell phone?  HAHAHAHAHA)
     So, for those of you that actually read this, Happy Fourth of July, Independence Day or whatever you call it.

              Talk to you all when I have something more interesting to say....

"event","Ok, so the Fourth of July parade (which is on the third, how F***ed up is that?) is in four days, and I seriously messed up my right knee.  I was just out of the shower, trying to dry off, when I went to put my foot up on the toilet to dry my leg off, I unintentionally slammed, (and we're talking full-force here, kids), my knee on the bottom corner of the bathroom counter.  It was so bad that I didn't even realize it.  I heard this *Crack/Thunk* kinda noise, and thought to myself, *Well, that didn't sound too good*.  Then, as I looked down to start drying off, I noticed my knee was bleeding profusely, and by that I mean it was bleeding REALLY REALLY BADLY!  As soon as the realization that I was bleeding sunk in, THEN I felt the pain.  It was like someone stuck a rod through my knee right above my kneecap, that's how bad it hurt.  It took me about five minutes, (seriously FIVE minutes, which is a heck of a long time to be bleeding, lemme tell ya), to get it to stop bleeding.
     My mom looked at it, (those of you that don't know or don't remember, Madre is a doctor).  She said I was lucky, and that if it had been about a quarter of an inch deeper, I would've needed stitches, (those of you that know me, know I'm *terrified* of needles, so getting sewn back together isn't exactly high up on my priority list).  She also said that the *POP/CRACK* I heard was one of my ligaments/tendons popping out of, then BACK INTO place.  She said there's no way that the swelling is gonna go down in the next four days, but I **MIGHT** be able/allowed to march on it for the parade.
     I swear to God, my knee looks about 5x the normal size... and it's going to end up turning black (I know that because it started bruising about 10 min. after I hit it, and now it's dark, dark blue, and not done bruising...)  Needless to say, it F***ing hurts.
     SO, other than that, not much else is going on.  I've tried to practice for at least 15 min. a day, but with summer school homework (i.e. papers and essays to write) taking up about two hours a night, along with all the other crap I have to do, I really haven't had much time.  I sound better, but I won't be to the point I was at this time last year for at least another month and a half, which really makes me upset.  No joke, I tried to hit an upper G, which is a note I've been able to hit since the end of 8th grade, and I COULDN'T HIT IT!!  I seriously started to cry, I got so frustrated.

Not much more to say, finals were today, TOTALLY bombed the U.S. History final, (woohoo for those of us who got under a 71!)  Earth/Space Science final was easy, got a 92 or 93 I think.  Not sure about Algebra II, but I'm pretty sure I did a decent job on it.  English, Spanish II, and Choir finals tomorrow, the only one I'm worried about is Spanish, but I studied for that one when I got done with the Algebra II final today, so I should be OK.

Your birth on the 25th day of the month (7 energy) modifies your life path by giving you some special interest in technical, scientific, or other complex and often hard to understand subjects. 

You may become something of a perfectionist and a stickler for details. 

Your thinking is logical and intuitive, rational and responsible. 



Your feelings may run deep, but you are not very likely to let them show. 

This birthday makes you a more private person, more introspective and perhaps more inflexible. 

In friendships you are very cautious and reserved. 

You are probably inventive, and given to unique approaches and solutions.</td>

"event","Ok, so usually when someone e-mails you, you answer it, right?  Well, I guess some of my friends have never heard that before.  When someone e-mails you twice, it is customary to answer at least one, am I right?  I thought so...  Well, if I don't get an answer in a week or so, I guess I'll send another one...  

Spring Concert is tomorrow night, *yay*  and last year's rookies are gonna perform our last two songs with us.... (including the two I would consider my favorites, although I like them all).

Women's Ensemble is gonna be awesome, and Shannon got the solo for ""Operator"", (Way to go on that, by the way, Shannon!)

Other than that, not much going on.

Write more next time,

Me"

"event","I am soooo excited!! Tomorrow, some of the ""veterans"" of the Tri-West Marching Blue Alliance are helping out with a rookie band camp trial thing.  I get to help with Charting and Hornline stuff.  We have to be there at 8 in the morning (Icky) but other than that no complaints.  What we are trying to do is decide who we will accept in the marching band next year.  It's like a tryout for all the incoming eighth graders and soon to be freshmen to get an idea of what we do.  

During the Charting 101 class, I get to sit up in the tower (YAY) and watch the forms and make minor fixes.  Then during the Hornline thing, I get to help explain posture and exactly how to hold the instrument i.e. pressbox, slides, chop, parade rest, etc.

I am really excited to see what next year's show has in store for us, considering our director wrote the music for it.  

It is a little bittersweet though, because this next season will be my last season.  I'm going to be a senior, which means at band camp we get to do a Senior Breakfast on Saturday before the parade.  

I am SOOOO anxious to meet the future members of the MBA.  Hopefully, they will come to love and appreciate all that marching band has to teach them.


Bueno Noche,
Helen"

"event","Hey, Kids!!

Well, not much goin on... I am going to the Circle Theatre on Sunday to watch  performances by the Purdue Choir, Orchestra, and Band.  My cousin, Amber, is in the orchestra, so my dad is taking Emily, Anna, and me to see it. we might even get to spend a little time with her! ^_^  That's really all for this weekend, but, for those of you who want to see it (hint, hint ~_^), I'm going to see if Anna would be allowed to tape it for me, so that I can make a tape of it if anyone wants one... (HINT,HINT) ~_^

Well... I'm gonna go to bed, so g'night, 

Love you all!

Helen

"event","So, this is my first entry... *does small woo-hoo dance*.  I just got bored and decided to make one of these LiveJournals.
     
Our first Rock Ensemble (RE) ""practice"" for the tour later this month was today, (we were picking out songs to perform for the elementary/middle school tour), and tomorrow we're gonna listen to some more stuff to decide on songs, and set up to start really practicing.  I'm pretty sure we're doing ""You're The One"" (by Sugarcult).  It's a cool song, and I like the feel of the song and the idea behind it.  Unfortunately, unless you go on the elementary & middle school tour with us, or are in one of those places, you wont get to hear it, sorry 'bout ya.  
     
The Spring Concert is Monday. Not this coming Monday, the next Monday, the 18th or 17th, I don't remember, but it is on a Monday in April. I'm 90% sure it's at 7pm, but I could be wrong.  Come and see it if you can.  
     
The choir is singing, the Men's Ensemble is performing ""Make Them Hear You"" from the movie ""Mulan"", and the Women's Ensemble (which I am in) is performing ""If Ever I Would Leave You"" from the musical ""Camelot"".  
         
The two women's trios are performing, too.  The senior girls trio (1st Sop.~ Kim Lowe, 2nd Sop.~Robin Bondy, Alto~ Shannon Duff) went to State and got Division 1/won it/did super well.  The other one (Rachel Berg~ senior, Danielle Hanna & Amanda Renzi~ juniors) I think went to State, and if they did, I forgot how they did (sorry, girls, you know I love you guys, I just don't remember).
         
The band is performing some stuff, including the Closer for next year's show (I think we're doing that for the concert, 99% sure).  
         
Well... I gotta go shower and get ready for bed... Goodnight girls and boys!!!


Rock on, kiddos!

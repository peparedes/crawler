"event","But I find that if I do facebook notes, it just gets me in trouble or when things normalize THEN people start to care or do things/say things.  Its rather lame.

Alright...Here goes.  For the last few months I've been seeing a girl.  Back in December, we got close as friends and I had planned on graduating, finding work, and doing life as usual.  Part of my life as usual was to begin my conversion to Orthodox Judaism.  I had timed it so that school wouldn't be in my way, and, I could have the proper flexibility necessary for the situation.  When I didn't pass Anthro 301(by a lame technicality), and, had to take another semester at SDSU it gave me a huge amount of unplanned for expense, stress, etc.

As time went on in January, I started seeing her inner beauty as a person and I made a move on her which led to the start of where I'm at right now.  However, she's a very religious Orthodox Jew....and that means that she is constantly assaulted by waves of guilt about dating me(a non-Jew as far as religious communities are concerned, because of religious law).  Our relationship failed 2 times because of this but we got back together within 24-72 hours of the moments in question.  Last night might've been time #3 but I'm not sure.

When she's not having moments of tremendous ""what am I doing??"" guilt, we were a happy couple and very close together.  After the first 2 splits, we came to the understanding that it goes nowhere if I don't convert(which I hadn't done yet bc of school).  So...I kicked things up but the Rabbi closest to me has been lagging and generally maintained a distance.  I know he doesn't want me to do it, but, I'm going to despite this.  I'm fully kosher, I keep the Sabbath, etc. etc. etc.  I even have a beard!!!

I went to Thousand Oaks on Monday to visit the family and friends whom I either missed the first trip in May or haven't seen in a longer while.  It was hard to maintain my new religious lifestyle.  My family wasn't very supportive; often it was ignorant commentary or questions of practical relevance of elements of what I was doing.  The additional pressures of living a very strictly guided lifestyle, along with the pressures every post-degree graduate has, was hellish.  Basically, I couldn't function on a normal level, and, my limited financial scope made eating regularly 3 meals a day of actual food difficult.

My friends didn't understand the new me either, though I expected that one a lot more because the various diverse backgrounds of people I know include Mormons, staunch atheists, etc. and theres no major religious Jewish community up in TO(they all go to the Valley or real LA).  At times it was difficult because when I was dying of hunger at Universal Studios, they insisted on getting me food and were appalled by my refusal bc of the lack of kosherness to it.

When I came back Friday night, I got in just in time for Shabbat after sitting in a 5 hour long journey by car.  I had a good time with the people there, but, I felt sort of out of place because of how late I was running when I arrived.  Saturday however was another story.  I woke up feeling disconnected and I had a weird dream about my gf and I making out in her house and then her ex-boss came by, saw us, went and got the police, and they chased me so I had to run.  Yeah......and the other day while I was in TO, I had this dream that I had died a particularly violent death....Why? Well..Someone said something about ""stupid Jews"" so I yelled at him(it was a cholo; gangster mexican) and he tried to stab me, so, I blocked with a pillow but he got me across the head with a shotgun and aimed at my head while I was prone.  Needless to say, I had a messy end to which I could only respond ""thats not cool man, I'm Jewish, I'm Jewish""...and hen they hid my body in my car and pushed it into Mission Bay.  Gruesome huh?

What else is on my mind you ask?  Well....Two friends from my community told me they've heard(but won't name names) that people believe that I'm not serious about my conversion.  Its rather disheartening and despite debating in my defense, it wasn't til I started yelling at them and dropping F-bombs and stuff that they gave me any modicum of leeway.  I ranted about how far I've gotten, on my own effort, and that if I asn't serious I wouldn't bother to do anything.  I think it took clarifying and they probably still don't believe me.  Oh well..


Last night a friend had a party..He says it was #4 straight party that he had.  When we got there, he was stoned out of his fucking mind and sporting new ear piercings and 2 tattoos.  His party was full of minors, and, he was behaving very immaturely and wildly.  It was enough to where this morning he mentioned that he no longer is living at the place he was at, and, its clear that he messed up somehow but won't take responsibility for it.  I spoke to a mutual friend and confidant about the whole thing and my concerns for him, and, the person told me that we can only do so much but if he is going to hurt others or himself, to call the police and leave it at that.

Overall, I'm just not having a good time with this whole being depressed thing...I'm starting to collapse as a person and I need to start rebuilding who I am.  What I'm doing isn't going to get far if I don't take care of my other shit...Ironically enough, I'd advise the same to the guy from the story of last night..I actually tried but he wouldn't hear it.  Either he's manic or he's on coke right now."

"event","Small update on life coming to you live..................

The last while I've been living life, trying to find work(at my own, slow pace).  The results haven't been very good, as prolly noted or mentioned in fb.  Things needa pickup--I need money.

An ethical question has presented itself.  I've found myself attracted to someone who I'm better off not being attracted to.  Mainly, her level of religious observance deters me.  She was at the point of not touching members of the opposite sex(aka guys in this case) unless they are family,children, or her own husband.  By touch, I mean all possible physical contact.  Think invisible wall.  She also has some maturity stuff that has me hesitant to entertain any thoughts-- inner child is definitely visible.  Probably hiding from the pains of the adult world by clinging to youth as long as possible.

Funny thing is..last night, she fender-bendered someone's parked car and called me up freaking out.  I calmed her, told her the legal stuff I knew, and set some ideas up.  She contacted me over the course of things to keep me updated, and, at one point felt she needed to leave where she lives and get the negativity outta her head, which led to a request to come over(mind you its about 1AM by this point).  So...I say okay, bc whether I like it or not, I'm the only one that knows other than the person who she hit and the person whose car she drove.

She brought me jelly beans....the accident happened on the way to the grocery store and the 1 thing she actually got wasn't related to what her goal was either...it was my jelly beans.  A thank you for being there measure I guess.  She wanted to check out the stars so we left to see if a spot on campus had a good view.  Not so much.  All around was lighting.  So...we opt to the beach...and its now 2AM.

From this point, in summary...the night went from star gazing to being cold to cuddling for warmth to making out.  And yeah, I pretty much shattered that whole no-touch thing....kaboom..But I haven't seen the aftermath..I'm worried.  It was just a night of fun, and while I said it, I'm hoping its understood its not a contract of obligation..I'm not a bf.."

I feel sort of emotionally drained..sort of blah..A friend of mine has been concerning me lately and I don't know what to do about him.  He's been chasing girls left and right and going about it the wrong way.  I see in him a lot of what I saw in myself in the past.  Attention-seeking, desperation, attachment, neediness/clinginess.  All those good ol' things that everybody wants in a person!

Last night I was hanging out with him and the energy/mood level shifted significantly as the night progressed and we got more and more bored.  All his girl drama flared up too when he got a call and this girl he was trying to date decided to stay in Beverly Hills and have fun living the high life.  Needless to say, he got pretty hurt by the whole matter and I spent some time talking to him about the warning signs.

"event","This past weekend spent in LA proved interesting.  I was hanging out with Trevor on thursday doing a bit of music jamming with my drum and his guitar when the topic came up on whether he'd like to go to LA with me or not.  I had been considering it for the last few weeks as David and an assortment of friends were bombarding me with requests to visit.  He had his own desires so he was all aboard and we left friday.  Started at 2 and ended up arriving in the Valley at about 5:30-6.  I got home in TO at about 6:20 and had just enough time to shower, eat, and jam out all dressed for Shabbat dinner at Chabad of Northridge(I was expecting CSUN).

After dinner at the Rabbi's place, we bounced onward to where he was living for the next 2 weeks. We sort of woke up his friend's mom and it was interesting times dealing with a Persian mom who doesn't know who the hell you are and walks in on you sleeping on the couch at 1:40am.  David explained the situation and I got to crash in her daughter's room(I know what you're thinking..hubba hubba...well, she wasn't home that night) on a real bed!

Saturday was a brisk walk to morning prayers where we encountered this writer/producer guy who was really nice and who I wish I had caught the name of for next time I'm in the area(networking!!!!).  I told him my story w/ being a mix and he was very understanding of the situation, even explaining  his thoughts on the reason why(lets just summarize as G-d decides to return people to religious observance after a few generations of non-observance).  After prayers, we had lunch and thats where I bid farewell to the people I had met and David.  I then headed home for a nap and waited til I got contacted for pickup by Mike and Kelly.

As per tradition, saturday night was cosmic bowling at Harley's Simi Bowl.  Drama central...Things were good initially but after a few drinks and some misplaced words, that inevitable monster we call drama reared its ugly face and caused issue.  Needless to say, I thought I had somehow caused it because it was clearly a jealousy issue but turns out it had nothing or very little to do with me.  The night ended on a pretty sour note but I was pretty blasted so I was pretty numbed out and playing observer.

Today I slept in...and ate..and procrastinated..and beat my dad in an arguement.  I actually won.  He didn't say it of course, but, thats because he has his pride.  My parents seem to have this impression I'm an alcoholic.  They also seem to link it to the Orthodox movement's way of life.  I was handed an article in Newsweek about concern amongst the Orthodox about young people drinking too much on Purim and the like.  Impression they gave me: they consider the religiously observant to be draconian nutters from the past.  Sort of hurtful considering they haven't really been exposed to most things and they're looking at the angle all wrong.  I'm not Orthodox but a good portion of friends are.  The issue started when my mom offered me canadian bacon and I turned it down.  I got a smarmy comment asking if its because I don't eat pork.  Regardless of the reason I had for no bacon, it was uncalled for and led to me standing up and arguing my case that it shouldn't matter what my reason is because if I don't want it, I don't want it.  My dad came in and pretty much self-hated on his own culture calling it backward and saying he prefers to move forward and thats what he likes about legislative law.  Funnily enough, Poli Sci 101 proved invaluable in pointing out that Legislature was designed in America to be inefficient to prevent the dumbasses of the world from passing laws easily.  Bills go through a 50%+1 majority vote in 2 distinct houses and then go to a guy who will decide whether its okay(Prez w/ veto).  If he says no, the process starts over again on the vote and they need a 2/3 majority to override.  Given the debate time averages at a few weeks, how is that progressive if they constantly debate it for long periods of time?  So yea....thats how I won.  He knew it and copped out with ""I don't want to argue about this anymore"".  I finished packing and left.

I dropped in on Adam when I left, then got in my car and made my way back home.  Took from 9pm - 11:30pm exactly to get from Longs of Westlake to home here in College Area.  Pretty good timing.  Now to sleep...

I plan on evaluating my stances on things and writing a letter to my parents to mark where I stand.  I think they need to respect my choices and views and not play the ""enlightened and tolerant liberal"" card when they clearly disrespected a choice made of free will.  This will not stand; especially if they're expecting me to respect their wishes of finding work."

"event","This weekend wasn't too shabby.  Friday night I got invited over to some friends' new place for a big housewarming thing, met many of their LA friends there.  Yesterday I recovered and then went to MB so we could bonfire it up.  I'm not detailing further due to legal restrictions in effect.  Today was sort of another recovery day...Thankfully my friend Pinchas picked up that I wasn't good to drive and did it for me so I wouldn't die last night.  I owe the guy.  He wanted me to come out to OB to some party he knew about but I sort of mini-napped/watched ""A Haunting"" because I was tired and lethargic.

A few thoughts:
1.)I'm a trashed-chatty guy.  I sort of discussed it with a girl that has only seen me sober maybe once, and she agrees that I do talk quite a bit.  Funny how that works...Mostly quiet unless intoxicated.  Inside I'm a sociable guy, but, it takes a bit of digging to get to that.  Its worrisome though; I'd like to be just as balls-to-the-wall sober.  Or perhaps even more so drunk too.  Too cautious; too concerned with consequences.  Its frustrating
2.) Pinchas wants to go to Brazil and just putz around selling juice or something(immigrant style lol) to get by.  He also wants to go in 2 months, yet I'm still in school.  Israelis seem to have wanderlust and seem to be down with the notion of ""Hey, I know people in this country, lets get a ride there and see whats up"".  Its a cool life; sort of a ""Break Year"" type gig.  I'd like to go and am hinting that I'd like to get my degree first and then would be open to the idea.  Since I know my geography better than he does, I had to explain why driving a car down there would be super dangerous AND take forever.  So..His solution? We'll get a boat and sail there.  Sounds cool but I dunno how realistic that'd be.  Perhaps he knows what he's doing, given the fact the guy has experience with it.
3.) I passed up on a chance this weekend both nights to hit up this girl that Pinchas was telling about our ""planned adventure"".  She claims she's going to come with us, but, I'm pretty doubtful since most girls are flakes.  She also is taken but we got into the whole ""Whats your sign/how old are you"" bit last night and she said ""Oh, I like younger guys"".  I threw back ""You're only a year older, I'm not that young"" and she laughed.  She was into me...but..prolly just drunkenly.  Either way, I didn't want to make enemies out of a crew that might be visiting more often down here so I decided not to push it.  Would've been fun though.  Ah the pains of precaution"

"event","I don't write in my livejournal very often anymore.  I found over time that it just sort of collects and gathers most of my negative thoughts or thoughts produced by emotional compulsion.  My goal subconciously became to stop writing every time such events occurred simply so I wouldn't sound like a whiner.  I'm realizing this now that its come to the spotlight again.

I just skimmed about a year and 3 month's entries back..just to see.  Mostly negative.  Yep.

How am I currently doing? Whats my current situation?
I am:
1.) A senior who finishes my BA of Anthropology in December 2008
2.) Still single.  I got fairly used to it since May 06.  All my dates or potential things ended up introducing me to people who clearly were looking to solve all their problems with romance.  Reason why? I figure its because perhaps I'm just so lonely I ignored a bunch of red flags and felt responsibility where I had none.  The last girl seemed stable up until the point that I got to know her deeply, which led to my nurturing side coming out(and we all know that unless you're a chick, thats a no-no) and she got turned off to it and tried to turn me into an ""Orbiter"".  Having been through the ropes already a few times, I made it clear thats a thing of the past I'm not willing to experience again no matter how lonely I may have felt.
3.) My friendships are more or less the same as always.  Few and far between.  Many acquaintances that acknowledge I'm there but don't make an effort and seem scared off if I make an effort to be friends.  True friends all have their own lives and I sort of appear in them at their discretion.  A few have been placed in jeopardy by miscommunication or misunderstanding and also by different ideas of what friendship consists of.
I lost a friend the other day(hence the last lj post).  She was a Myspace friend of something like 4 years.  Why? Because I won't play the pleaser and say its the right thing to do to date only Armenians.  She thinks I'm racist because I point out that endogamy happens for different reasons and that Armenian endogamy is based on separate reasons than Jewish endogamy(her example on why its justified to do it).  Part of me mourns the loss, the other part finds her incredibly silly for asking the world to give her an answer she wants and then shooting down 3 people's responses that either take a neutral position or a position opposite of hers and huffing off the way she did.
4.) I have housemate issues again.  First guy is just the former property manager whom left and came back to seek refuge after a bunch of legal troubles involving beating his pregnant wife in China or some shit.  Nobody, myself included, is fond of him because he's a jerkass.  Second guy is just this little guy who is mentally unstable(for real).  He's mad at me because he's taking the side of the third guy.
Guy # 3 and I are on very hostile terms because he has chosen to drag me down in an attempt to elevate himself socially.  I oppose his notion of popularity and such because he is a complete poser who will do anything for social acceptance.  If you recall the personality of my old roommate Wayne, the landlord one, he's verrrrrrrrrrrry similar.  Do the cool stuff with the cool people in the cool clothes or else you're a loser worth making fun of.
This led to us butting heads a few times and my friend Mike(Hollywood) was always there and witness to incidents but never took my side because he was status-conscious and hates dedicating himself to things.
Theres plenty of backstory but my post already reads pretty long so..I'm not going to.
5.)  A few of my friends have gotten married.  This is actually a positive thing; I'm happy for them that they've found their partners in life.

Note: My inspiration for writing at all comes from a certain thing I'm noticing.  I have stopped taking care of myself as I should.  Groceries that should be bought haven't been; I don't cook and I only will heat up some canned chili or soup or whatever when I'm really hungry.  Right now, I'm starving but I have nothing to eat except canned goods.

I'm sinking and I don't know why.  My quarter life crisis started years ago in HS when everyone but me knew what they were doing in life.  Now its hit the point where I'm so caught up in the future that I have neglected the here and now."

A few of my friends are married now, or getting married.  The number really ramped up.  I see signs of my age catching up to me, and I've been looking at working on a job when I'm back in SD.  My friendships with certain people mirror positioning: A good portion of those I still keep up with here work full-time to survive.  Myself, not so much.  I feel out of sync with that..I should have a degree bow, but, the system is being revamped by the administration and economic hard times.  I should be working now, but, I'm not.

Then theres the social aspects of Maslowe's hierarchy of Needs.  Theres a few things missing that have always anchored me in place so I can't move to the next Need.  I want to take care of some stuff but I don't know when it'll happen.  Its not up to me; I'm only an individual.

I want to succeed..I'm willing to work, but, I want to succeed and be sure of it before I put the effort in."

It seems like every time I win a major victory that shouldn't be possible, or, am on the way there and very close to it, the computer likes to crash or shutdown or pop up a spam message or something along those lines and ruin whatever game I'm playing.

In my wisdom, I've also decided to come up to TO for a small while; my birthday will be held in LA area rather than SD.  Why? I have 2 weddings of very good friends to be at; one in Ventura and the other somewhere in LA prolly by Pico.

"event","Me and her have talked a few times since the last entry.  I got a ""No chemistry"" thing and thats fine, what-ev.  We hung out tonight and I came to understand that I am still capable of having a working friendship w/ someone outside the romantic context, and in the post-romantic context.  She had some red and yellow flags that I was willing to settle with, but, ultimately I think that was my mistake.  It was settling.  I settled mentally on her.  Why? Well..She doesn't seem ready to have a steady commitment.  Not commitment phobic per se but I feel she is still lost in a distrust of men.  Her world is filled with poor examples of men, and, even though she's not outwardly jaded it comes out in her behavior that she has her walls up.

Tonight was fun..but..I came to realize she wasn't this super ultimate person I made her out to be.  I didn't, and still mostly don't know who she is..I plan on knocking out this habit of latching on to a few good traits as grounds for pursuit without really hanging out.  There are some traits in her that I find disagreeable, or, at least put my mind into thinking ""if I were another guy, this would turn me off"".

Within myself, I came to understand on my drive back that I was making progress.  I was a social person with all her friends that we met at UCSD.  When I met her roomie, we had more of a convo going than she did(she actually got sort of bothered that we tended to interrupt).

Overall, I have set a goal and accomplished a goal.  I'm understanding a lot about myself in college(and only scratching a surface, I feel) which is part of what I wanted to do.  My new goal however is:

A.) Focus on myself..Making myself desirable.  I have internal qualities but I need to start getting some external qualities.
B.) Realize and actualization of my personality.  I want to start doing stuff, hobbies, find something and get into it.  Or at least be able to get more excited about the things I like.
C.) Become a more responsible person.  Cleaning my dishes today was an example.
D.) Socialize and handle things differently than I could.  I've looked at how things go, and, with some effort I'm bridging some gaps that emerged from being introverted.  D could prolly just be simplified as EXTROVERT MYSELF!

I have a model forming of who I want to be.  Its based in a large part on who I feel I used to be, as a kid, prior to moving and ritalin/ADD stuff.  I want to be charismatic.  I will be charismatic. 

My schpiel for the night."

"event","I went on a date tuesday.  It went pretty well I thought...Even ended up kissing; even left w/ a goodbye kiss and a smile!  Haven't really talked to her since then..Got 5 minutes of not quite conversation yesterday online about it.  Otherwise, no mention, no reference, no contact, nothing all week....A girl that normally bulletins every day or every other day and none of them touch upon it at all...

I saw her tonight during friday night shabbat dinner at the place we met at.  Things were awkwardly different, and it felt super-impersonal..To top it off, this guy that I feel threatened by was there and taking the spotlight..and when he wasn't, this friend of mine who happened to be there was spotlighted..I'm pretty sure the way she was talking that she was interested in him..It was that 50-50 somewhat casual, somewhat personal interrogation talk..Great, right?  I've dated this girl and I'm already loaded up w/ all these signals...We hardly talked much and most of it was group conversation :-/  I made reference to something the ""threat guy"" said about her being a ""playette"", a girl player...She was like ""omg, I'm not a playette!"" and I cleared that I didn't feel that way really, but, that I noticed there was a subtle tension between them.  She denied it and when I said it was pretty hard to overlook, she said ""I could say something mean but I'll hold my tongue""..That pretty much signaled a confirmation to the iffy feeling I was getting.

Around this time I started to become more and more quiet and less involved in conversations still happening(the ""threat"" had left, and my friend was leaving soon anyway)...and I just started to think to myself ""What the fuck? We had a date and it ended on pretty good terms, so whats with this shit?"" and from there it spiraled into negativity..

The other girl present at our end of the table noticed something was wrong, so, she asked and I unconvincingly denied it and said I was doing post-meal prayers..which was half true, it was prayers but more of asking for clarity and help in the situation than thankfulness for food.

As we left the house about a minute later, me and Eadan were headed toward the other girl's car.  My date girl was still talking to my friend, and, went directly to her car..She said ""Bye"" from the door rather than approaching..I hadn't gone toward her, to test if she would react..I didn't exactly get the ""hey, aren't you going to say goodbye?"" reaction I wanted..

I'm pretty depressed...What the fuck?!  Can't a good date get rewarded rather than punished with this awkwardness bullshit?!  Oh wait..women don't make sense..thats right...Because WHY WOULD ANY RATIONAL PERSON DECIDE TO COMMUNICATE THROUGH BOTH PHYSICAL AND VERBAL GESTURES THAT SHE ENJOYED BEING WITH SOMEONE IF SHE DIDN'T REALLY?!"

And yet, its larger than that.  I feel like such a fucked up person right now I want to fight myself.  Thats right.  If I saw me, I'd kick my ass for all the stupid shit I do.  I'd force myself to deal with the facts-- That I'm nothing.  That people don't give a shit so why should I?

I'm angry..fucking angry....Yelling angry..Punching angry..Perhaps even more violently angry than that.  At myself.  At those who ruined me.  I feel like this all the fucking time and it bothers me.  Why can't I move beyond it?  I'll tell you why...Because they made it repetitive, they made it socialized, they made it a team thing, they made me into me.  They decided this and I didn't fucking resist it entirely and now I'm fucked

Fuck all this shit..I want to just live and not worry..Fuck it....Sometimes I wish I could kill me just so there'd be a fresh start..and yet, at the same level, so I could feel nothing from being in that state of deadness.

Yom Kippur passed well..did it Shomer Shabbat too.  That means no electricity,etc.  On top of the 28 hr fast.  Yeah..Needless to say I was pretty crazy during...My concentration level was that of a gnat and my understanding level/comprehension level was waaaaaaay abysmally lower.  I swear I saw a couch smile at me that morning...Dehydration, not a pretty thing.  But in the end, I went to Chipotle after scarfing 2 free bagels from Hillel's services...Killed a whole Chipotle burrito with several soda refills.

There was someone I had my eye on, who contacted me while I lived in TO...Wanted to know some stuff about State so I helped her out.  She was pretty much a random myspace girl that seemed cool.  Seen her around twice, hung out once, and we've said hi via her dorm window a few times.  She decided though in her misery of feeling lonely from being too shy around such a big population(she's from Borrego Springs in the desert..small town) that she wasn't going to do anything about it.  Needless to say I tried helping out and inviting to as many things as possible.  We have dubbed her Repunsel because she's blonde, attractive, and sits at the window chatting all day but won't come hang out or tag along on stuff.  The other day I got fed up and just said fuck it...and now I feel like perhaps I wasted too much effort helping someone that doesn't take what they want.

Lesson of story: Chicks are fucking nutty...They tell you ""Ohhh I'm sad..I feel alone..I don't have many friends..blah blah blah"" and then you try to remedy it and they just smile and CHOOSE to stay that way as if they're making a point."

Chabad is looking better since Edan and Alex and Jackie and some of the Israelis I didn't know decided to improve the place.  I think it'll be a better experience than I planned for.

That'll be good for when life starts back up again.

Did some philosophy talking and pondering during the drunk discussions time and on the ride back up.  All around determined I'm still frustrated with female psychology.  I find flirting to be a frustrating thing still because it hasn't really gotten anywhere lately beyond just that..flirting.

Being 21 is nice until everybody wants you to be their buyer...then it gets frustrating.  Thankfully there were others to do that later on that night.

Sort of feeling esoteric tonight...Thinking about a bunch of things...Mostly from last night's driving convo.  That and a dream I had last night about someone I don't know that well...Needless to say, I'm already reading into it as a sign.

So here are my grades for second semester at SDSU:

Anthro 303, History of Ethnological Theory: C+
Anthro 304, Anthropological Linguistics: C+(BARUCH HASHEM, I PASSED!)
Geol   303, Natural Disasters: B (straight B...I'm pissed off about it because the points online were misleading from the true scale)
Heb    100, Hebrew Alphabet: A
Heb    101, Intro to Hebrew I: A-
Phil   120, Intro to Logic: D+ (Second time around..and still doesn't make sense!)
--------------------------------

Not too shabby..We all knew I was never a very logical guy ;)  The C+ is good news, it means my scores averaged out on my final(prolly high since I had a 69 and and 89 on the first 2).  Anthro 304 I apparently survived..I'm so glad.

Hebrew is an amazing thing..My only As so far seen are in a difficult language that I have very little experience with(beyond hello/goodbye, good morning, and the few words I learned from being with Yahm).  I can't wait to keep kicking ass into fluency.

I'm pretty happy with the turnout, though I hope the D+ doesn't hurt me for continuing into the semester for fall."

"event","A year ago I ended up single yesterday...Its been a year-long break from the taken life.  Ironic that it ended when it did, a lil bit after we came here.  Now I'm here looking back and I think to myself that it was for the better.  Sadly, my friend Mike is now a victim of the May 11th singledom...Weird how that worked out.

A song comes to mind when I think of my time with Yahm.  Its lyrics pretty much define my opinion...So here it goes

Offspring- She's Got Issues

I'm seeing this girl and she just might be out of her mind
Well she's got baggage and it's all the emotional kind
She talks about closure and that validation bit
I don't mean to be insensitive, but I really hate that shit

Oh man she's got issues
And I'm gonna pay
She thinks she's the victim
Yeah

Now I know she'll feel abandoned
If I don't stay over late
And I know she's afraid to commit
But it's only our second date

Oh man she's got issues
And I'm gonna pay
She says she's the victim
But she takes it all out on me

I don't know why you're messed up
I don't know why your whole life is a chore
Just do me a favor
And check your baggage at the door

Now she talks about her ex nonstop, but I don't mind
But when she calls out his name in bed
That's where I draw the line
You told me a hundred times how your father left and he's gone
But I wish you wouldn't call me daddy
When we're gettin' it on

Oh man she's got issues
And I'm gonna pay
She's playing the victim
And taking it all out on me
My god she's got issues
And I'm gonna pay

If you think I'm controlling
Then why do you follow me around
If you're not co-dependent
Then why do you let others drag you down

I don't know why you're messed up
I don't know why your whole life is a chore
Just do me a favor
And check your baggage at the door"

"event","So here's the plan...so far.  I'm coming back up to Thousand Oaks for the summer.  I'm spending it living at home, doing the summer school thing at Moorpark, and all around prolly working and doing whatever else I can.  Classes have just been paid for about 20 minutes ago, so, its a go.  I'm just going to have to suck it up that I can't live down here.

Chronologically it'll look like this:
Finals til the 16th
Hang out throughout May doing whatever
Come up sometime on or near June 1st
Hang out for the brief free time I have
Classes start the 18th
My birthday the 25th(a monday, FUCK!)
and so forth and so on."

"event","I just got told to ""shut the fuck up"" for talking loudly 5 min ago through the walls by my roomie that owns our condo.  Yet, for all his disruptiveness and annoyance, I get no relief.  Fuck you Wayne, you can't say shit.  All the bullshit I put up with is more than enough to pay for my speaking loudly at 1 AM once."

"event","Well..I haven't sat myself down to calculate it yet but the way things are going, I have decided to withdraw from my apartment by June 01.  That means I need housing for summer or else I'm coming back.  I'm going to try to figure out my direction I'm headed after I write this, because things are really chaotic doing it as it comes.  I gotta plan out and have backups just incase.  Who knows what'll happen, but, I think I may end up coming up.  Ironically, its not as bad as I normally would feel..I'd be able to get parking easy and I could get home-cooked meals.  The friends situation is going to be difficult over summer either way.

Keep an eye out, next entry should have a few thoughts on where things are going."

"event","I've never felt more retarded than after taking a class twice that still fails to make any sembalence of sense.  The most insulting part is that its ""inherent"" in us, yet I totally fail to understand any of it.

Who the fuck made it necessary to take a logic class where you learn ((P.Q)>(R.S))>(-Q)>(-S.-R) style shit?  What purpose does that serve me?!"

""brainfart!!!!"" well we saw the chronicles of Narnia and it was a good movie. Lynn cried, and George was dealing with it  innerly but his body seemed to be spazing physically and jesse was eating my gummie bears. well the fun really began afterwards when Lynn said she wanted some starbucks. actually no i lied. on the way out of the movies i was walking(duh) and i swear i didn't see anybody in front of me and then all of a sudden i start tripping and falling and i realize it's not a rock, i had ran over a child with my own feet. yes i know i feel bad but he crossed in front of me and he was at my private level.lol. and then he looked up at me terrified as if he had just seen the excorcist. let me just say if ur not laughing right now as you read this one you suck and two you need to loosen up and spend a few hours with me. well then we went to Barnes and Noble and we went to the starbucks section and we ordered food and i swear we couldn't have talked about the most randomest stuff ever. from star wars to me having a boyfriend to fat people it was fkn hilarious. and then i was eating a frap n we were all giggling and laughing and i went to go throw away my left overs i know its a shame but i paid for it, when i went to go throw it away the trash can refused it and it didn't go in and i got whipped cream splashed all over me. it was fkn hilarious i almost pissed my pants and Lynn was right behind me. then we went to the kids book section and jesse lynn n george saw a book that had a piano and they started playing it. then i found a book that had wheels and i threw it to george and if he wouldn't have caught it then it would have hit the kid behind him right in the face. and i find it funny how throughout the rest of the night they called me child murderer and it still continues. then we were outside because i hit jesse in the crotch and well there was a paper with a guys number rip off thingy and he was selling a car and we pranked called him and it was one of those you got to be there situations but it was hilarious. then we pranked call giggles n the shitt was madd funniii becaus eshe didn't know it was us and  then i called her from lynns phone like it was all good and she was like "" somebody just called n i dunno who it was i think i was pranked called...etc. etc."" and me n lynn were laughing non stop so yea. well that's all for now i don't want you reading till tomorrow n srry if it's to long. bye."

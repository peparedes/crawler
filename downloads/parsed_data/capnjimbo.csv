fuck the whole non alcohol thing.  changing it to the vegie bar on brunswick. same time etc.

UPDATE:
okay, if anyone's up for it (at the moment, i'm counting at least four people out of town. plus the inevitability of people already having plans given the short notice) moroccon soup bar, 183 St. Georges Road
North Fitzroy at say...7:30 friday.  rsvp so i can book a table, i guess( no internet at home, so text on 0424 076 802)
--------------------

at the moment i'm leaning against my original plan of staying in on friday and feeling REALLY FUCKING OLD (check the user info, do the maths, giggle) and at least going out and getting dinner or something.  but being kinda reclusive means i know fuck all about melbourne's restaurants.  any suggestions on somewhere decent?"

"event","fr1st p0s7 2004 b17ch35. um, i was never really one for keeping up with the times, i guess. the year so far's been pretty good to me (shit, how could it not be? it's the year of the monkey. a billion chinese people can't be wrong. a thousand or so loiterers in tiannamen square can be a little misguided perhaps, but all up they're a pretty spot on kinda bunch), but it's like the world of the internet doesn't even know me anymore. the following bigass changes have taken place since we met:<ul><li>i'm rocking my security guard license in full effekt, being a fulltime(ish) art gallery attendant. sometimes it gets a bit much hanging out in front of the same paintings day after day (first time i saw the [certain old-skool italian guy and his fans] exhibition i was near tears. a month or two on i barely even look at the things), but it beats the dole (or working a cube farm, for that matter), and i'm finally learning to make smalltalk with strangers, which is cool (actually, i just decode people's euphemisms to tell them which way the toilets are).</li><li>i've gone back to uni to study arts/<span style=""font-size:smaller"">economics</span>, basically because i've never understood the point of a society based around excessive consumption and i figured i should either at least _try_ and understand it or buy a che guavara t-shirt and a jr. sloganeering for wankers handbook. it's going well tho (um, not the understanding societal aspects bit). my new favourite gag is ""i gots more As than a fonzi convention. i ain't no motherfucken mr c"". i don't care if i'm doing the first semester of first year, it's funny cos it's true.</li><li>i'm now sharing a flat in west brunswick with caitlin. i miss my courtyard a little, but it's nice to fall asleep at night knowing that if i wake up in the morning with the house on fire it will be something of an irregularity.</li></ul>my mother seems to be of the mindset that spending this year doing stuff means that i've grown up enough for her to not worry about sending me jammys and blankets anymore, so she now mails me big kids things like sharp knives instead. goddamn fool. what i need are practical objects with soft corners, like a turbo-powered monkey, squishy blue ice packs, an army of robots and/or a medical kit (and a pony. natch). given the regularity with which i cut myself while chopping vegetables, the one thing i don't fucking need is a self-sheathing utility knife that makes me think ""you know, when the blade hit my skin that time, it felt a little too much like i followed through"".

so i ended up making caitlin trek down to the emergency ward with me, with my hand wrapped in an old t-shirt and the tip of my finger in a press'n seal glad-bag, kept cold by a defrosting packet of parmesan. i'll kill the melodrama now and point out that it was only a 5mm high by 7mm diameter (or there abouts) chunk of flesh, which is too small to even reattach, but still... erm, it's, like, a bad thing.  you know?
the whole event was kinda funny, if anything. i have a natural tendency to get through dumbass situations by sitting around making crappy joke upon crappy joke to myself, or whoever's sitting next to me in the waiting room trying to do the woman's day crossword (trust me. once i had to wait for a week to get cancer tests back (turned out i was a leo. *rimshot*). it was a laugh riot. delta's living the fucking dream i tell you), and i left with a sore-ish jaw from making myself smirk too much. do you know hard it is to _not_ make ""keep the tip"" jokes to cab drivers when you have appropriate props in your pocket?

i can't throw the end of my finger in the trash, and i don't really have a favourite park to leave it in,  so i stopped off at the cemetery on the way to uni to bury it (there's a part of (what's left of) me that hates the idea of _any_ of my remains not being left on consecrated ground), but it was closed. i briefly considered just burying it through the fence, but was worried that i might accidentally put it in the protestant section. god knows it's hard to curry favour with st peter when part of your body is eternally burning in hell for the mortal sin of ignorance. then again, even jesus only sympathised with lepers. i'm sure he'll give me extra marks for going the extra mile and being prepared to empathise with people who shed parts of their body a little too frequently.

i love the way that scars on people tell stories (and i've often felt a little pissed off that i currently only have about 7 or so that will be around for life) but turning part of my body into a testament of my poor culinary skills is just lame. i think i'm also going to have trouble looking at my finger and adjusting to the fact that it's part of it's _just not fucking well there_ anymore. plus i'm going to have to find a new, yet just as effective method of intellectual discourse that doesn't involve pulling fingersigns at people (then again, when the ultimate in flipping the bird is kenny g's very existence making charlie parker roll in his grave (geddit?), i guess i don't care that much). i hope my next of kin can still positively identify my chalk outline when my bus-hailing skills now prove to be fatally inadequate.

oh, and mel, i love you, but fuck your quicker/easier/no-more tears system of cutting onions. it's a crock of shit, and the doctors and orderlies at the royal me1b0urne emergency ward think so too. from now on i'm sticking to my chosen specialised fields of cutting rugs and mustard."

"event","i've become such a badass jock thug since i last updated this thing properly.  a few months ago i was an unemployed scrawny geek.  now i'm still unemployed (one year today.  rock), but i'm a licensed security guard/crowd controller.  no, that shit isn't going to stop being fucking hilarious.  ever.
in the past two weeks alone i've received the following sports related injuries:
* scraped nose/upper lip from body surfing
* 2 grazed knees from playing <s>touch rugby, with a 2 yr old on the other side</s> mad xfl stylee ballgames
* fingernail marks from some tosser in a gold chain diving under a wave without looking where he was going and hitting my back
* a board rash on my chest from a shitty body board
* sore nipples from wearing a rashy
i think i have to pay some kind of protection money to contiki for going on holiday and getting nail scars, a funny rash and nipple injuries without their consent.  i'd suffix that sentence with *rimshot*, but the entendre is fucking appalling.

i'm staying at my folks retirement pad (_so_ glad to be with my family again for a decent period of time) in coolum at the moment.  having a veranda _and_ a porch seems a little indulgent, but fuck it.  i get to sit outside smoking while listening to mississipi john hurt and townes van zandt while various breeds of critters scamper about everywhere.  give or take the brisbane cbd, queensland architecture is the shit.  just like living near a kickass beach.

i've also put on a little bit of weight since i've been here (finding food made with more than five ingredients to be a novelty is just fucking wrong).  the only movie role i'd ever be able to feasibly try out for is still a generic junkie #1 bit part (i hear everyone that auditions gets a commemmerative giant foam finger.  and a few grams of methadone), but i'm a little smoother around the corners and you can no longer count the number of ribs i have just by looking at me.  

obligatory (retro/intro)spective nye bit:
below are the songs i've gone through the biggest phases of listening to repeatedly since i've been in melbourne.  i guess it's as good an indication of the kind of year i've had as any.

<b>tullycraft - sent to the moon</b>
i've probly listened to this song twice a day on average.  it's soothing when i need it to be, and when i'm perkier i can dance around the courtyard to it without spilling coffee everywhere.
i feel really guilty about not buying beat, surf, fun yet.

<b>the postal service - such great heights</b>
greatest fucking pop song of the year.  yeah, our courtyard becomes a giant lake of undisolved cheapass bushells powder, but do me and my wicked cool blok-rokkin disko rug-cutting moves care?  no. no we fucking don't.

<b>joni mitchell - a case of you</b>
wish you were beer.

prince really needs to be kicked in the nuts for covering this (as <u>a case of u</u>.  for fuck's sake.) and skipping the verses with the best lyrics just so he can babble on about being lonely painter.  he's just a fucking overated self indulgent little arrogant  pervert, and i'm really not sure how he got the two mixed up. it's not like he's even trying to find the middle ground and aspiring to be reubens or anything. &lt;/rant&gt;
anyways, i spent a shitload of time listening to this thinking ""you know, if you switched the narrator and the subject in lines x,y and z and ignored lines a, b and c then IT'S ALL TOO FUCKING TRUE.  DEAR GOD THE HUMANITY OF IT ALL"".
heartbreak's a cunt, isn't it? (i think byron said that)**.

<b>the weakerthans - left and leaving</b>
i'm not really fond of the weakerthans at all, mainly because their lyricist guy tries too damn hard to be profound.  but over-earnestness makes things great to wallow along to when you're feeling pathetic.  i listened to this a shitload whenever i was homesick and considering just up and moving back to perth, and it's a piece of piss to sing and play along with drunkenly.

<b>the thermals - no culture icons/everything thermals;arab strap - the shy retirer; misc nation of ulysses & pwei bits and pieces</b>
this is the stuff i'd rock out to before i went out.  despite knowing that by the time i got to wherever i'd be too sober and drowsy to be especially talkative. oh well.
bands with theme songs are the shit.
""you know i'm always moanin', but you jump start my seratonin"" is the couplet of the year.

<b>the polyphonic spree - five years</b>
people that get the piss taken out of them for being overly-optimistic hippies.  covering a song about people going apeshit due to the announcement of the apocalypse.  coming correct with their own doomsday robes.  fucking genius.

oh, and the go-betweens still kick everyone's asses live.

"event","you know, i would've been quite content to sit back and smugly enjoy the <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/capnjimbo/23749.html#t25285"">first</a> of the deluge of (assumedly) thousands of comments begging me to start posting again on behalf of a world becoming increasingly devoid of pirate and monkey jokes.  then someone had to start bringing cool hand luke quotes into it and, well, that's the kind of thing i really can't say no to (i think the most telling indication that cosmo just makes shit up as they go along is that they've yet to run a well researched article entitled ""you got yourself a set of (ball and) chains"", in which they point out that the quickest way to get a man down the aisle is by serenading him with a heartfelt rendition of plastic jesus.  tho  throwing in an ad libbed coda about being all knocked up and having a father with a loaded shotgun can sometimes help).

anyways, i haven't  updated in the past couple of months essentially because i went through a fucking miserable period (despite its upsides:mel coming to stay for a bit, finally having my own silk screen again, receiving packages with candy that was as explosive as it was sour, the go-betweens once again being the total goddamn shit live), and i really couldn't be bothered writing the life of times of stephen patrick morrissey jr (""dear world. woke up feeling depressed again about the state of the english school system, so i banged the side of my arse with a bouquet of orchids to try and cheer myself up, but failed.  ps johnny marr just doesn't understand me.""  for fucks sake, i've never even been to a florist, and i what little i know of geography tells me that duncraig senior high school is as damned far from manchester as you're likely to get.  i _am_ pretty sure that marr doesn't get me, tho, or he'd probly come around to visit more often).  
i was also worried that posting for the first time in ages would invariably result in a pile of disjointed dribble.  um, as opposed to the normal kind of stuff that makes me think ""aww, god bless my coherent moments of shining lucidity"" right before i hit submit.

brodie's notes version of the past however long:  i hit rock bottom due to certain things relating to my future not panning out as i would've liked them to, realised that i had no idea what i wanted to do with my life (still don't, really) and that i was fucking tired of amassing the world's largest collection of inane neuroses.  as a result i've stopped being bothered with a lot of the triter crap that would make my daily life a pain in the ass, and i'm closer to actually getting my shit together than i have been in years.  hell of a time to go through, tho.

in other news, being sick for the first time since '97 has led to me giving up coffee (and to a large extent cigarettes) in favour of my newfound love of grapefruit juice.  from now on, i guess i'll only be called a scurvy-ridden cur as a term of endearment, but i suppose i can always fake my favourite disease by subtly painting scars on with mercurochrome and falling over whenever it takes my fancy.

i'm going to sleep now.  when i wake i'm going to get up and order me an actual bed, with a real mattress and everything.  rock."

for no reason whatsoever i shall now post a link to the <a href =""http://www.jeremytweddle.com/blog/2003_06.html#000036"">greatest journal of all time</a>.

last night i ate a lot of prepackaged m+m cookie dough (my new vice) before finally getting to sleep before 4am for the first time in a month, and as a result kept waking up from continual nightmares about insomnia (irony.  it's shit isn't it?) and living across the road from the warwick grove shops.  

there doesn't seem to have been any additions to the 1000 jokes for kids of all ages series for over a decade, probably because the author plundered the entire history of funny gags and is currently waiting for some decent new material to come along to maintain the previous high standard of humour set.  i think it's high time for me to think of giggling (or non-giggling, as it were) children everywhere and help out.  they're our future for fuck's sake, and a future without a naff sense of humour is worth looking forward to as much as a future without rocketpacks.

<i>what do you get when you cross a fucking annoying muppet, a bunch of whiny brats with guitars and a football team?
tackle me emo</i>
*scratches head*  don't think i've really got this whole ""punchline"" concept sussed yet.  oh well.

my family have a curious habit of pretending that they're going to come and visit, then cancelling at the last minute with <s>excuses</s>  valid reasons like ""time"", ""money"" and ""we love you, but we have to cut our travels short as it is to visit the queensland department of motor vehicles instead.  quite frankly, you're just not as interesting and varied as outback south australia.  we'll make it up to you in the will, honest"".  but mel assures me that she is coming to stay for a bit, as soon as a minature family reunion that i wasn't even invited to is over.  yay! 
lauren's moving to melbourne around the same time (yay. again) so at least i'll have a shoulder to cry on when mel inevitably cancels.

<i>what did a certain anonymous poet say to his honey-covered green spherical vegetables when he was in a particularly vaudevillian mood?
take my knife...peas</i>

saw the new folk implosion recently, who did wonders for my theory that anything with the word new shoved onto the front of the name in order to imply interesting development is pants compared to the old version (scooby doo, where are you? vs the new adventures of scooby doo and his stupid fucking attention seeking nephew.  which would you place money on in a fight? ).  but lou did rebound and brand new love as encores (he did a couple of other songs from his ""i like wanking and crying"" period during the main set too), as well as a shambolic impromptu cover of dinosaur jr's tarpit  (with ad libbed line ""got kicked out of dinosaur"").  i think that's some kind of historic moment as far as record geeks with no lives are concerned.
oh, and it turns out that the impetus for his legendary reading festival hissy fit was being plied with two lines of addiction inducing speed by smudge, the li'l scamps.

"event","i've recently taken to getting most places by taking stupidly long walks and detours (at times a couple of hours out of my way) everywhere.  part of it's for the sake of getting exercise to try and make myself tired, but to a large extent it's because i'm really starting to miss suburbia.  
i've been keeping an eye out for places to buy kool aid from (no luck so far.  hmph.  should really mend my tshirt to spread the word to the masses), but i know where i can get magic gum from now, which makes me happy.

saw the lucksmiths on friday night at a benefit to try and save the empress from noise complaints (it's like the grosvenor all over again, although at least melbourne has more than two different venues so i guess it's not as bad at the moment).  mark was in shining drunken babbly form, which was fucking great (""jason mccartney retired because he was burnt out"".  it's probably the first football joke i've ever gotten in my life, which makes me feel like such a fucking hardcore jock.  the best part is i don't even have to leave the house to look for nerds to beat up).
 
i was drinking beer over the course of 9 hours last night, which explains why i really can't remember very much of it at all, including how i got the giant graze on my arm (waking up with scars is always funny, and makes me look ever so tough).   i'm guessing i was kicking the shit out of some geeks before going off to a frat kegger to impress the ladies with my ability to shout really loudly about san dimas high school football ruling.  that sounds like me.
went out to watch love like electrocution via rocking out to atari teenage riot at pete's house.  i ended up sitting around and talking for most of the night tho, so i didn't really get to see any of the bands.  decided to walk home by myself via fanclub, despite not actually knowing where it was.  luckily there were bunches of strangers on the way to give me really very helpful directions (""yeah, it's four fucking blocks that way.  just keep on fucking walking cunt"".  believe it or not he was just being a tosser and not giving helpful directions at all).  someone else looked like he was considering hitting me after scamming a cigarette off him (yeah, i know) and having the audacity to light mine before his.  i really don't understand why people are antagonistic for no fucking reason.  i was wearing a tightish fitting shirt that hinted that i don't especially have the world's butchest physique, so it's not like i was coming across as being physically intimidating.
ended up just sitting around on the couch for about half an hour watching people play pool before i walked home (i assume.  i can't even remember doing so, give or take that i impressed someone with my ability to walk along a perfectly straight line).

i think if the world needs one thing right now, it's for me to go to the shops to get the necessary ingredients for rubbery eggs and greasy ican'tbelieveit'snotbacon.  off to do my bit for humanity, you can thank me later."

"event","so far this is my best attempt at quitting in years (i'm down to about five a day, most of which are in the wee hours of the morning for the sake of killing time until i feel tired.  because huffing stimulants is a great way to venture off to the land of vikings), but my sleeping patterns are completely fucked up as a result.  i either sleep extremely lightly (i've _never_ slept lightly in my life) and get up just in time to mess up my flatmates' morning routines by hanging around watching peanuts cartoons, take sporadic catnaps to avoid grumpiness or stay up until about five with insomnia.  
the dumbass food cravings are gone, and with them my chances of living my lifelong dream of being slightly tubby.

de la soul apparently sold out weeks ago (hmph), so i went record shopping instead.  i was in the mood for dumb 60's influenced indiepop that wasn't outright cheesy but couldn't find any of the stuff i was looking for (maybe because i don't have a fucking clue how to pronounce beulah, let alone spell it offhand) so ended up buying a call and response album, which isn't as tacky as i thought it would be.

saw the guild league a couple of times on the weekend.  good, but they work a lot better with a stupidly large lineup than as a 1-4 piece.
word to the wise: avoid the basic shape at all fucking costs.  i just don't trust bands where the singer can't dance along convincingly."

i've been treating my body like complete shit for about ten years now, so i expect it to be grateful when i decide (again) to stop waging a double headed caffeine/nicotine style ass whooping on it.  but no, it has to go and try and shove a decade's worth of revenge into as short a time period as possible when i decide to play nice and give it some breathing room (with the promise of more to come).  it's being a spiteful fucking ingrate at the moment, and i really expected better of it.
i have a giant fucking headache at the moment (i can't even recall the last time i had a headache a glass of water wouldn't fix.  probably when i decided to get trashed on cooking sherry about seven years ago).  i also kept waking up at about two hour intervals last night feeling nauseous.  fun times.

stuff i've used to try and get the cravings to fuck off:
- spicy fruit toaster muffins
- cheese on toast
- water
- a large pack of mixed m+ms (the crispy ones are fucking disgusting.  never again) immediately followed by a pack of burger rings.  don't try this at home kids. it doesn't make you feel better, despite seeming like a good idea at the time.
- beer.  which helps, but i'm trying to cut back on that too.

"event","went out to watch love of diagrams and architecture in helsinki last night.  i proved myself completely unable to slyly streetdrink (ain't saying what i was drinking.  it could've been a shirley temple, it could've been nyquil mixed with kerosene.  whatever you choose to think it was reflects your view of me, so play nice.  i'm destined to become your new ruler, as will later be explained.) without knocking over various pieces of outdoor furniture. i am so fucking punk rock.  or at least, as punk rock as one can be on a night which leads to ordering food from the same place as daryl braithwaite.
love of diagrams were cool, architecture was fucking packed and poorly mixed but still fun.

while cutting a rug at the brunswick later on, a woman (who was probably about forty) kissed me on the cheek and told me i was ""such a little groover"".  generally my subsequent thoughts in such a situation would range from ""you're scaring me.  please go away"" to ""aww.  she probably sees everything in me that she would want in the son she never had"", but she shook my hand afterward to signify the sealing of some sort of verbal contract that she was under the impression had just taken place.  hopefully there's no legal precedent for the word 'groover' equating to ""i hereby claim you as my toyboy"", but it proves that as one door in life closes another one opens.   just as i decide to limit my employment options for the sake of ethics, an entirely new and viable career path (being a bit of fluff on the side, disco style) has suddenly come along that i'm completely okay with.  i'm not going to whore my eternal soul for the sake of money, but the human body only exists for a  finite period of time, so it's fucking stupid not to use it to my advantage in as many ways as possible before it decays.

i won't pretend that it's the kind of thing i'll be good at right away, but i figure the learning curve shouldn't be that steep.  i'll just start at the bottom (watch for the pun hidden within the next four words of this sentence.  it's, um, fucking crap really) by shaking my ass for someone who's both middle class and middle aged for beer, and work my way up through age groups and tax brackets simultaneously.  i'm guessing it'll take about 6 months before i reach my goal of doing interpretive dance for billionaire widows on their death beds.  i just have to learn the macarena and the running man (yep.  i can't even do the running man.  motor skills are for stock car drivers who end their short lives in flames.  good looking corpse my ass), tell them that that's what all the kids are into these days (i figure that in certain demographics all dances invented after the lindy hop look the same) and they'll be so grateful that they've gained enough insight to be down with the youth of today that i'll inherit everything.

it's not so much a career path anyway, as the ultimate pyramid scheme (someone lies around at the top doing nothing while we both benefit from my hard work.  eventually i can afford my own harem that, in kind, waits around for me to die).  the  best part is that while most pyramid business models fail by being centered up poor mathematics and palming off greasy dishwashing liquid to a rapidly decreasing circle of friends, this one's infallible by instead taking into account (and working with) life's only two sureties.  i'm bound to make a bunch of money from the inevitable death of old people, and there's similarly large bunches of money to be kept because the idle rich have ways of figuring out how to avoid paying taxes.
plus, humankind will be much better off because i'll finally get enough money to build my giant robot army to help me take over and rule the planet with an iron fist.  no one loves a tyrant, but a benevolent robot-aided overlord who gives out free iceream (or gelati, for the lactose intolerant) on sundays?  i'm sure i've been taken into everyone's hearts already."

"event","attempted concise version of a long and rambly post i just deleted.

i spent most of yesterday hanging around the house being pretty fucking upset and avoiding returning a call from the girl who interviewed me the other week (i made the assumption that they wanted me to come in for an interview).  i'm really going to need a job pretty fucking soon for a variety of reasons ranging from money (duh), to avoiding going into a depressive bunk due to having nothing to do with my time.  and god knows the IT field doesn't have a large amount of prospects at the moment.

however, the company's biggest client is a pretty fucking large oil company - meaning that i'd probably end up spending the majority of my waking hours working for the benefit an industry i despise.  i'm not going into it (too easy to come across as a self righteous twat, and it doesn't seem like such a big deal anymore anyway), but i took a hell of a long time mulling stuff over before deciding that should i be offered a job i'd say have to say no.  fuck it.  no reputable study that i'm aware of has disproved the theory that the moral highground is paved with a variety of tasty yet nutritional foodstuffs and leads to a land where cute little elves sporadically run up to people handing out money by day and randomly paying off bills by night.

i phoned the girl this afternoon and was told that they were impressed by the stuff i'd done in the past, but the job description had changed in the interim.  although i wasn't really applicable anymore they may still call me in the future to get me to code on contract if they start to get more projects than their regular staff can handle.  

a real man would've decided that the only proper option would be to grow a trotsky beard and do their damnedest to take the system down from the inside while mumbling whatever the hip dogmatic polysyllables of the day are.  but a real man by definition is actually physically capable of growing a trotsky beard, so the option wasn't even open to me."

<li>saw 24 hour party people on friday.  it was okay, give or take its assumption that half arsed character/plot development is fine if everyone knows the story anyway.</li>
<li>went to the love of diagrams launch on saturday (they really don't seem to come across that well on cd.  hmph).  too crowded to enjoy either ninetynine or love of diagrams that much.  buggered off to get  get food (salty spinach and ricotta subs and deep fried cauliflower are the absolute shit when drunk) to avoid watching the bird blobs completely miss the fucking point of why the birthday party were interesting in the first place, but caught the end of their set anyways.
stood next to mick from highschool for a lot of love of diagrams' set waiting for some kind of a look of recognition, which never came.  chose to be amused over offended.</li>

"event","i was asked on friday to go to a job interview on monday, which meant i spent the entire weekend  avoiding preparing for it, but feeling too guilty to actually leave the house.  as a result i ended up doing things like rearranging my bedroom (i kept my previous interior decoration theme of ""shit scattered all over the fucking floor"" tho).  i also dyed my hair and got another monkeyboy haircut (which has nowhere near enough parts monkey, boy or haircut for my liking.  plus i have to stand on sloping ground for the fringe to appear level, which would be fine if i was in san andreas when an old fashioned tectonic plate smashing celebration was happening, but distance and the whims of mother nature seem to be conspiring against me).

i have no fucking idea how the interview went, i never really do with things like that.  i don't remember saying anything particularly stupid (or smart, for that matter).  
initially, they asked me to fill out a form which had spaces for my dress size and boxes to tick for whatever talents i may have.  part of me was considering whether or not it would be a good idea to check ""singing"" and ""dancing"" in order to bust an appalling charleston while warbling who's got the crack (there's a part of me that's quite prepared to throw away the chance for a regular paycheck in order to have a story to tell the grandkids), when someone came in and told me that they also run a modeling agency out of the same office and they thought that that's what i was there for (that's right kids, i'm though of as being one fine piece of ass by people whose job it is to know that kind of shit.  feel happy that the amount of time you've stayed up at night thinking about what a dishy ladykiller i  am is completely endorsed by professionals).  
anyways, they may call me next week for a one week trial (um, the computery people that is), so here's hoping.

after a couple of months of not particularly winning at quiz night we fucking kicked it's ass big time.  fuck the bagatelle that only a few teams turned up.  we split into two teams, stayed seated at the same table anyway, and won between us:
- closest guesstimate post first round jug
- funniest answer post third round jug
- second place $25 bar tab
- first place $50 bar tab
the only other thing we could have won was the funniest answers of the night, which they never give to the first/second place winners anyways.  

drank the bar tabs last night for prue's birthday.  can't really remember what went on after that, but i have scars to show from whatever the hell kind of hijinx occurred."

random events:
lauren was in melbourne for a while, and i managed to catch up with her for coffee a couple of times which was good.  i haven't sat around with someone that knows me really well (and she still knows me better than anyone, give or take) and blabbered about stuff that's on my mind since i got here, but she bore the weight of my purging quite well.  god bless people who can make my cynicism seem like a unique and useful characteristic, yet still tell me that i have too many negative affirmations (in the hippy personal negative reinforcement sense of the word).  i guess her point was to focus on the fact that i am the total shit and use it as a comparative benchmark for pointing out why everything else is inherently fucked. my ability to take constructive criticism on board is superior to your ability to take constructive criticism on board, cunts.

lucksmiths' launch was good, but i'd seem them do better shows.  here's a hint kids - if you're trying to cryptically hint at who you're going to cover through rambling tales, then be wary about using the word ""quiff"" too early as everything afterwards is superfluous.  but versions of everyday is like sunday.  yay.

pete's birthday was on saturday, which basically involved a drinking a shitload of beer and going to see the bites (this time i managed to take a nap on the couch at the cue _without_ having the living shit beaten out of me) before going (back) to the rob roy.  somewhere along the way i cut my palm while piggybacking brett and pete at the same time (not by choice.  volition seems to disappear when your body-mass instantly triples) and a streak of its blood unknowingly ended up on my face giving me a swanky faux-pirate scar for a while.  rock.

sitting around the house all the time is starting to become a little passe, so i decided to go to the botanical gardens yesterday and finish as many of the half-read novels on my floor as possible.  unfortunately this clashed with my plan of sitting around on my ass downloading pastels and pooh sticks mp3s for a few hours, so i only ended up with enough time to go to alexandra park and read near the shore of the yarra with a makeshift picnic of foccaccia and iced coffee.  
i was surveyed for my opinion on the state of the park, which i don't think was that useful given that i'd only been there once before and this time i was deliberately sitting with my head down and my back to it.  a lot of my responses were based on either asking the interviewer questions or making assumptions after turning my head (""do they have toilets here?  yeah, i think the facilities are adequate"", ""um, the grass is nice and green, i'll give the groundskeeping full marks""). maybe i should've suggested free wireless networking/internet telephony facilities to aid the phone bill of the guy on the opposite bank who was sitting on a bench talking on his mobile for four hours straight.

went to bec's birthday drinks last night - drinking classy beer and eating chocolate cake = good.  found out that  nat was taught by helen's mum and had elle's dad as a dentist (or doctor or whatever the hell he was).   in perth the minimal degrees of separation are accepted as a widespread in-joke of sorts.  when they pop up over here they just seem fucking weird.
we now also have 3 chimay glasses in our house as a result of the night.  while i had nothing to do with them actually being stolen, i did actively encourage it.  given that there wouldn't be _that_ many people with ""yay generic sports team x"" clothing items if their support wasn't so closely tied to the outcomes of [game of choice y] (and hence justifying inclusive phrasing like ""we won"".  one of these days an mvp will go to someone for their amazing contribution to the game by sitting on the couch eating doritos while swearing loudly at the tv), i don't see why i shouldn't take all the credit for their procurement."

there's a chemist on king st that sells screen printed lee hazlewood t-shirts.  it's impressive, but i don't think it's a very good idea to openly give props to the guy who wrote sugartown if your main trade is dealing in pharmaceuticals.

the drive from sydney to canberra was dull.

hung around my sister's house for a bit before going out to dinner at the labour club with some old friends of my folks.  watching grown men steal cheap bread and scam as much as possible out of their senior citizens discounts - more for the point of sport than out of any real frugality - is fucking hilarious.

said goodbye to my family at the bus station, which i fucking hated (with bonus funtime points for being the shmuck that has trouble maintaining some sense of composure in situations like that).  guess i'll still probly see them at christmas or something, but hmph just the same.

watched some movie on the bus that made me wish paul newman died young in order to strengthen my position that he's so much fucking cooler than sean connery and his stupid fucking smug grin could ever damn well hope to be.  but if he'd done that, then i guess his delightful face wouldn't be popping up  in the salad dressing aisle of my local supermarket.  i think his charity would make a fucking packet if they started producing free range eggs in cartons of fifty.
i normally sleep quite easily on buses, but i spent most of last night just staying awake (not falling asleep riding from [geographical point a] to [geographical point b] is very 1996. *sigh* i am ever the traditionalist) listening to old sodastream ep's and feeling a little blah about various things.  watching the country go by while feeling slightly out of sorts and having nothing to be distracted by really takes it out of me.

a lot of the family's time this morning was spent doing clothing alterations.  i vow to never again buy any item of clothing where they let you keep the hanger and/or sew the pockets together on purpose.

wedding was really nice.  the last time i went to a wedding i ended up playing hide and seek under the table at the reception.  um, just to clear up any confusion, i was six at the time.  anyways, my cousin kate and her lifelong piece of ass are a really cute couple, so all the best to them.

reception was good too.  tho no crawling under the table hijinx.  most of my mother's side over the age of 17 was there, which i think  comes to a total of 143 or so (catholic family).  it was good to see them all again, and as far as i can tell, they're all doing really well.  i      being the obligatory awkward social retard of the family, but i guess someone has to fill the role (i only started to go foetal once tho, which is nice).  i wish there was a social rule that every family had to have at least one astronaught.  i'd demand the position, then declare war on john glenn's bunch.  i figure every family needs a common goal to bind them together.

firstly:
     whoever designed telstras     ing stupid webpoint internet kiosks.  what kind of a     ing name is that anyway?  i guess it's a dumbed down piece of      kind a name, which is all rather apt really.  bah

friday:
-overslept, as can be expected.      bolted thru town during rush hour - my legs still hurt.  i think i'm meant to know where the spencer st train station is after having lived here for three months.  i figured just knowing where spencer st is would be enough.
-the guy who got the window seat (    ) insisted on blocking it by reading the wine pages of the australian financial something or other.  learning what year penfolds' unwooded chardonay (or whatever) is best drunk vs looking at the ground and going ""    ! we're in a big bit of stapled together metal and IT'S LIFTING OFF THE GROUND!  HA HA HA"" (don't think i'll ever get over being excited by that).  you tell me what's a better time.
- taught my mum the ins and outs of filling out a dole form properly, which amuses me to no end (i don't think she got the joke).  i'm glad the past three months of my life haven't been completely wasted.
- slept lots.  on a bed.  more on that later.
- went out for dinner.  i don't understand why i'm meant to feel good about someone assuming i'm incapable of filling up my own beer glass.  plus i get the crazy physics of pouring it onto the side so as to avoid 3 inches of head.
- slept ON A BED again. which wasn't as comfy as i hoped.  was worried that i have lost the knack to sprawling out oddly when faced with more than a foot wide space, but was happy to discover when i woke up, i was back to the crucified-man-foetus position that i've spent 26 years perfecting.  when going to sleep, i think the most important thing is realising that you may die, and it's best to get the most important chalk outline possible.

saturday:
-went to bondi and saw mum's old house.
-wandered along king st in newtown.  saw the most kickass book (and stuff) arcade _ever_ (i think it was called goulds), give or take its lack of stepladders and signs telling you where to find stuff.  when i left i saw someone buying the sugarcubes' life's too good for $7.  'nuff said.
-wandered around the rocks.  interesting, but i'm not that fond of the architecture itself, especially when combined with new architecture i don't like.
-no time to rekkid shop.  grr.
-no time to scout for hipster beanies either.  grr twice.
-went to my aunt's for dinner.

i spent quite a while between stores just circling various blocks in the city, getting up the nerve to go through the whole ordeal again.  i must've passed a piano playing busker on bourke st about four different times.  once he was playing the turtles' happy together, another time he was playing take me home country road while a sweet middle aged couple tried to figure out why they were having trouble waltzing to it (personally, i find the trick is in accepting that while being able to count to three and being able to count to four are two rather useful skills, they aren't really as interchangeable as one might think).  my time wasting also involved buying the new gerling ep ($5 with free video made of foam.  hmm) and the new lucksmiths (without free poster, despite what the candle newsletter said.  i had felt bad about not buying it from polyester, but if crouchy has some kind of a personal vendetta against me then i'm going to go out of my way to make sure he sees as little of my money as possible).
i eventually forked out too much cash (to my mind.  the last time i payed more than $100 for an item of clothing was when i bought a pair of sneakers about four years ago) for a suit i tried on a few days ago anyways that i'm really not that fond of (and the legs need to be taken up too), but i guess it'll probly come in handy at some time or other in the future.

i fly out tomorrow morning for sydney for a few days, which should be fun.  my extended family are all fairly cool, even if i do tend to be a little quiet around them.  but hopefully it won't lead to too much smalltalk along the lines of ""just what in the hell do you do with your days then?"", ""do you have a girlfriend?"" or ""in describing your new bedroom, you seem to have left out an actual bed.  how come?"".  although if i told everyone from the start i was a pimp, i doubt any of those questions would even cross anyone's mind.  plus it would justify me wearing the latest in fly pimped out chic instead of a suit, which i wouldn't especially mind."

lucksmiths 10th anniversary bash: 
droplet sounded as dated as hell, but they did a nice cover of you and your sister, so it's all good.  the steinbecks were okay, and i can see why people like them, but i don't get how they have such a huge following in certain circles.
the lucksmiths themselves (dressed to show that they indeed know how to tie a tie) were absolutely fantastic.  all the songs that they planned on playing that night were written on ping pong balls and placed in a lotto-wheel thingy for fun random song selection hijinx.  a large proportion of what they played was from the first three albums, which i've never really been that into (give or take certain songs) but was a lot of fun live.  i found out that if i try to dance politely by making a concerted effort to not stick my elbows into the person behind me, i just end up swiping them with my butt anyways (i'm not sure which is bonier.  damn fleshless ass gene on my father's side).  i guess it's the thought that counts.
at the end (1:30am.  that's a good 2 solid hours of lucksmiths shindiggery.  sometimes being a broke-ass societal burden that doesn't have to get out of bed in the morning has it's advantages) there was free lolly bags for some (not me.  hmph) and posters for all (i scored a good kind of nervous one and a lucksmiths/salteens tour one).  yay.

melbourne sinister meetup
as always (um, give or take the time i ended up asleep (revisionism is fun) and hidden away on the edinburgh coast while the tide came in), the sinister picnic was a damned good time.  the massive consisted of me, trixie, amy, laurence & vanessa from nz (is it creepy to tell someone you've never met that you recognize them from the wedding photos they posted to the net? i hope not) and the surprise addition of neil robertson.  charming bunch of kids the lot of them.
we sat around in alexandra gardens for a while eating, fighting over cupcake colours, talking / grilling neil for dirt on the belle and sebastian (and occasionally letting him in on stuff they were up to) and playing frisbee (badly).  amy gave us a tour of the australian centre of the moving image (there's a piece there which contains probly the only use of image morphing that i actually like), and we all went to some hipster cafe or other for refreshing beverages of choice.
we went our separate ways for dinner, and most of us reconvened later on for weekender.

sunday lucksmiths instore:
met up with everyone but neil from saturday.  i haven't been to an instore since the salteens caused  the lucksmiths to be rather hungover at 78's a few years back and had forgotten how much i liked them (um, instores that is.  liking the lucksmiths has been a given for quite some time now).  they played a lot of new stuff, which i'm growing quite fond of despite the lack of wordplay.  later on went for coffee/granitas/whatever in an italian cafe/restaurant type place with cute old radios and reel to reels on the walls.

i've never really hung out in melbourne during the daytime before (partially because it generally involves getting up in the morning, partially because i may or not be one of the living dead and i have an image to maintain), or poked around the numerous nifty looking cafes.  looks like i've got me some high adventuring to do."

"event","friday night: guild league played two sets (they ran out of stuff to play, so they had to do siamese couplets again as an encore.  which would be siamese quatrains, if only art and maths would resolve their centuries long feud and finally come together in global union (or U, depending on which side you take)) on the porch of a cafe in a place that was like a fully actualised city farm, while children ran around climbing trees and the like.  later on architecture played elsewhere.  suck it, perth kids.

i may have to rethink my stance about not idolising material goods.
i bought a new frying pan on saturday (catherine lived up to her constant threats of opening the bottle of pancake mix that i bought the week i moved over.  but it meant pancakes for breakfast so i wasn't grumpy, give or take the usual frivolities of me just waking up.  anyways, the pancakes couldn't even be turned properly with a spatula and i demand swedish chef stylee flipping akshun out of all my battered foodstuffs (and battered non-foodstuffs, i guess).  so i decided to fork out the cash for a new one), which i'm completely enamoured with.   i've only had the chance to use it twice (damned decision to fry up four days worth of veggies in bulk to save money), but i'm fairly sure that we shall become the best of friends (and isn't the whole point of good friends that you can use them as often as possible without them getting pissed off?  that's what my folks taught me just before i started kindergarten anyways).  no longer shall all my omelettes inevitably turn into scrambled eggs due to sticking problems / concave sections of the pan.  i've also turned every single crepe i've attempted to make in the past into scrambled crepes (come to think of it, i once had an entire scrambled food week.  the trick to having decent self esteem is learning to  work with your flaws), but i'm feeling lucky and will give them a go tomorrow night.  is there anything as joyous as being able to literally put the flat into the flat as a pancake-ish-thingy? probably, but this will do for the time being - especially because it means i get to eat nutella and banana.  yay.
non-stick coatings are the new gods of the culinarily retarded.  i hereby repent for every single time i've sneered at people that've made the ""nasa isn't a total fucking waste of money.  their research helps out in everday life, like, well, only the development of teflon comes to mind"" argument.  i guess communications satellites are okay too, as well as the notion that we're getting ever closer to the day that starfighters will be affordable to the common man.

i had to go pay the rent today.  even tho the post office is only across the road, i really don't feel secure walking around with $1600 cash in my pocket.  jokes about how secure i feel with a roll of dimes in my pocket are cheap (how much does a roll of dimes come to anyway?), and so i shall resist the temptation to make them.  fear the mighty restraint of my maturity.

i've recently started reading the penguin history of europe (which i guess is pretty different to europe's history of penguins).  i'm only up to the bit where the greeks invented thinking, but i can't wait to see how the book ends.  i tried to cheat and looked for ""giant fuckin robot armageddon"" in the index, and was a little disappointed that it wasn't listed.  but francis fukuyama wasn't listed either (probly devoting his time to taking revenge on seattle, if nirvana are to be believed), so i guess it won't have the worst possible finale."

"event","i have absolutely no idea why, but i've been pretty chipper the past few days (erm, not that it's _that_ out of the ordinary for me).  catherine laughed at me for smiling for no particular reason and told me that morrissey wouldn't love me anymore.  
what's the term for the opposite of a backhanded compliment?  i love that kind of thing.  someone asked me a few years back ""how come whenever i open my mouth, shit comes out of yours?"".  i still rate it as one of the nicest things anyone's ever said to me.

i'm in a there's-better-stuff-to-do-than-dick-around-on-the-net-all-day kind of mood, so here's the selected highlights from the past couple of days:
<ul>
<li>for the first time since a couple of weeks ago i managed to speak to helen without being slightly distant and having awkward silences.  plus, the phone-card she used had a lot of echo on the line - which meant i was able to listen to my myself yelling at her to fuck off when she bothered asking if she should go watch ashtray boy and boyracer in a couple of weeks time, and realise it was definitely the appropriate response.</li>
<li>danced around the courtyard for about three hours after that to tullycraft while chain smoking (look, i'm quitting for my own personal good.  doing something that'll just make me crabby doesn't really fit into my definition of ""personal good"".  um, so it's the right thing to do).  i figure someone's got to put the beat in deadbeat.</li>
<li>meg sent me a spice girls impulse deodorant post-card.  i have _so_ much mail in a truck to reply to.  eep.</li>
<li>went to another intensive assistance appointment and sat around the foyer reading for about half an hour while one of the receptionists arranged for an old man who'd dropped by to join the local chess group.  then realised that the appointment wasn't until next week.oops.</li>
<li>wandered around town looking for records.  sanity just started playing song to the siren(!) as i was walking past, so i wandered in to pretend that they may've had some of the stuff i was after.  they started playing eric clapton after that, so i left.</li>
<li>made some kickass red beans and rice last night.  which means i get to have refried bean burritos tonight.  yay.</li>
</ul>
hmm. it looks like the better the mood i'm in, the less tendency i have to swear and dribble.  i'm not sure if such unfortunate consequences are worth it, but i'll put up with it for now."

"event","unfortunately, i resisted the urge to just hand the hairdresser a note saying ""i want to look like a monkeyboy please.  p.s. i only speak ancient sanskrit and as such am unable to communicate with you further on the matter."" just to see what would happen.  i kinda got what i wanted anyway (using the tired old method of actually describing stuff. goddamn waste of breath. i can't believe the OED will take the space to list ""party"" as a verb (it's a pet hate.  never mind) - let alone all of the useless chaucerian wank scattered across its pages - yet won't take the two or so column inches to give credit to words that _i_ want to use.  hmph).
i really should remember that there's a reason people aren't completely blase about smearing dye over their foreheads, it's finally washed off now so i guess it's all good.

frank and jo left for high adventure, leaving behind a carton of beer as a thankyou.  they sure know the way to our hearts, bless em.

cut a rug to ninetynine at the tote on friday.  they were supported by a band called crayon fields who weren't anything extraordinary, but do get points for having 'crayon' in their name and one of their song titles, and 'crayola' specifically in yet another song title.  oh, and they had another song named along the lines of ""i bought you a present, but you don't return my calls, so  i killed it"".  ha!
someone tried to pick me up (i mumbled and looked away till they left, like the tarty little heartbreaker i am) by asking me if i'd ever rollerskated around london in a cropped t-shirt, or if i'd ever be likely to wear a cropped t-shirt at all.  hmm.  i guess there's nothing wrong with choosing the road less travelled by diction-wise in the search for true love (even if all untrodden paths did for robert ""posterboy for that kind of crap"" frost was make him overquoted, and not especially less boring in death than in life.  _real_ new england poet laureates discuss bank tellers and icecream men), but i really don't see why people bother straying from lines that involve the word 'astronaut', or invading the personal space of strangers so as to look at the tags of their clothes and comment upon their celestial origin.   those kind of lines have helped soulmates discover each other many times over at classy joints like the hip-e club, and i don't think people should piss off the gods by ignoring the inspiration that muses have spread across the world.

hung around afterwards for yet more rug cutting hijinx.  if i'm the only one in a group of people that can recognise run dmc's peter piper, does that prove that i'm really fucking old?  no.  not given the amount of times the ""goddam that dj made my day"" line was quoted in the press after jam master jay was shot.  all it proves is that the kids of today have absolutely no interest in the media, and it's because of that kind of fucking apathy in today's society that our pm can send our troops to war for fucking stupid reasons with no one in the country noticing.  damn it, when i bust it old skool, i'm dropping science for the benefit of society's poor knowledge of foreign politics.  word up.

everyone else went to some daggy disco thing last night, which i wasn't really in the mood to get dressed up for (i tend to only get enthused about having the opportunity to dress up as a pirate), so i stayed in and watched alphaville instead (erm, the film, not the eighties band.  tho they would've been quite welcome to drop by).  even if i couldn't understand a word of it most of the time (well, i could literally understand about five words of it most of the time.  it would've been much easier for me if the only thing the protagonist said was ""bonjour.  jai'me apelle lemmy caution. j'adore chevelles et crayons et crepes.  j'deteste le fromage"" (i take no fucking responsibility for the grammar / spelling in that whatsoever).  *sigh*.  c'est la vie), i'm still claiming it as a work of fucking genius.  having white subtitles in a black and white film is a little, um, bothersome at times tho.

spending my sunday sitting around renaming mp3s was pretty lame.  and to think i'm trying to actually give up my crutches (geddit? oh, never mind.  it's really for the best if you don't)."

"event","brief rundown of the past few days:
- the cutting down thing is going well(ish), i guess
- i have no idea where our hardcore quiz skills have gone.  even trixie's knowledge of spring onion synonyms couldn't save us.  bah.
- living above (give or take) an irish pub on st patrick's day wasn't as bad as i expected, or at all really.
- three of our doors bang REALLY FUCKING LOUDLY when it's windy, one of them being my bedroom door.  i have discovered that it is actually possible for me to be woken up by sounds in the middle of the night.
- had another intensive training thing where i sat around for half an hour reading the newspaper while they printed out a single sheet of paper.
- if any of them thar terr'ists i've been hearing so much about could somehow arrange for me to have the opportunity kick bush and howard really fucking hard in the nuts, i'd be mighty grateful.  

i've been doing the moodswingy / sullen thing a bit lately for various reasons, and normally i try and deal with it by playing music that's slightly perkier than the headspace i'm in, in the hope that i can get caught up in the jetstream for a while.  often it works (neon golden has a greater ability to give me a sense of calm stoicism (which is a good cornerstone to work from) than anything i've come across in a while.  i have no idea why the lyrics ""you're the pincard/you're the lifeguard/you're the information guy"" do it for me so much, but i ain't complaining.  or complaining about that anyways), often i estimate poorly and get fucked up by the contrast of what's coming thru my ears and what's mushing around in the area in-between.  the number of increments it can take to actually feel okay can get a little arduous too.

so i've decided to experiment with a new method - listening to music that's works on a different set of emotional tangents to where i'm at altogether (thus no being fucked up by contrasts), that has some kind of sassy and/or moxie laden and/or noble-barfly positive bent to it, which it's impossible not to subtly nod your head along with in identification whether you like it or not(erm, because i identify with sassiness and barfly nobility so well.  gotta learn some time i guess.  i'm got moxie in fuckin spades tho). rain dogs, nancy sinatra, nina's non bi-polarity inducing stuff, beat happening songs that don't  mention pajamas, skinned knees or croquet -  that kinda thing.  i figure the implicit sense of self-confidence will rub off in some manner or other when i'm not looking.
fine, i concede that it may be a little hard to walk around chain smoking empathetically to ford mustang if i'm trying to quit.  but dammit, if there's no public lewdness bylaw covering strutting around town eating diced fruit salad to come on-a my house, mark my words that a bill will be rushed thru parliament in a matter of days.
yeah. i'm gonna come out of this a completely new man, bucko.

in other news, i'm off to get a standard short back and sides (front seems to be taking care of itself just fine.) indie geek haircut and dye it the same shade of red i've been using on and off since i was 16."

"event","on friday brett, rhys and i trekked out to port melbourne (read: fucking miles away) to a hardcore gig in a warehouse - or at least that was the plan.  we got there to find out that the venue had changed, so we just hung around rocking def leppard while other kids arrived and waited to find out where the hell the new venue was.  a warehouse nearby (possibly the one where the gig was meant to be?) had a halfpipe, a lipramp and two trampoline frames outside.  i have no idea what union the people were in that managed to score that, but i damn well want to join (despite all the joy the IT field is bringing me at the moment).  i spent the next half hour sitting around playing with a cool-ass dog before we hunted for the new location (wasn't really helpful that it kept changing), found out the bands weren't playing anymore and left for the brunswick.  i like having things fuck up quite a bit, so i it was all good by my standards.  
the brunswick had a completely different crowd and music than usual.  they played the primitives' crash tho, which i haven't cut a rug to since i requested it at the loft in 95.

i think the best part of the night was when i sat around watching the first half of there's something about mary yelling ""it's jonathan!"" every 20 minutes or so (it's a natural reflex, and i'm fucking proud of it).  yr damn skippy i'm easily amused.

today i joined the library down the road (not sure why it's taken so long.  convenient libraries that i'm not blacklisted at are pretty rare in this country, and now that most places charge fines i've had to give up my old hobby of collecting threats of subpoenas and printouts that have my status marked as ""delinquent"".   that's right, i'm the biggest badass of the westside public library system, motherfucker.  word up).  a lot of the stuff i wanted was out or in cyrillic  (hot damn, it's generation x in serbian.  what fucking use is that to me?  multiculturalism works in principle, just like people returning books on time for the benefit of the community as a whole works in principle.  i'm not going to dogmatically defend the notion once it fails miserably and ruins my life), but i ended up with a hefty enough pile of books to rack up a shitload of late fees on a couple of months down the track.
and WHO THE FUCK DECIDED THAT REINTERPRETING THE LITTLE PRINCE'S ILLUSTRATIONS ON EXTRA COARSE PAPER (what is essential is invisible to the eye. for fuck's sake.) WAS A GOOD IDEA?  i thought i spent enough time pissing and moaning about disney writing off the work of eh shepard to scare the establishment out of doing crap like that anymore (note to self: double levels of whinging to increase the likeliness of their effect twofold).  i knew i shouldn't have left my copy at my folks house for safe keeping.

went on a house-ish outing (daniel stayed home putting together a computer for bec.  is ""i've never put a heatsink on a motherboard before...no wait, i used to assemble computers for a living"" the dumbest thing i've ever said?  unfortunately it's probly not even close) for a barbeque for rhys's birthday with catherine and brett, which was okay.

if my mother flies down to canberra from the sunshine coast on a whim to help my sister move, yet stays put (actually, she was traveling round the country at the time, but it's all much of a muchness) when i have to damn well load two suitcases and a rucksack myself to move from fitzroy to brunswick, does it mean she's playing favourites?
her will better be fucking well adjusted accordingly.  i gave up the best 26 years of my life keeping my parents company goddammit, and i deserve to be compensated."

for fuck's sake, if i can't save the kids then who the hell will?

i've decided that come monday (not that the dole makes the days of the week pretty interchangeable anyway, but i refuse to try it on a weekend on principle) i'm going to make yet another attempt at quitting smoking, and cutting down on coffee and beer.  the catalyst was discovering that it's hard to sing along to the delgados' american trilogy when you're having trouble breathing without sounding like the guy who busks the beatles back catalogue in perth, and realising that it probly wasn't the best discovery to be able to lay claim to (dammit, i want to be the guy who gets the nobel physics prize for discovering  how to turn lead into robots.  i figure it'd be a good start to the complete nobel collection i plan on getting).

i have no idea why giving up practically every vise i have at once didn't work last time.  i'm guessing that there was a glitch of sorts in the fabric of the universe somewhere, but god's probly taken care of it by now."

i was tired of waiting for a package that was sent by my folks <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/talkpost.bml?journal=capnjimbo&itemid=12564"">goddam ages ago</a>, so i went down to the post office and asked if it had arrived yet.  turns out there was a parcel there with jimbocorp listed as the company name (ha!) that had only just arrived a couple of days ago (because it takes a month for stuff to get from the sunshine coast to melbourne.  i could fucking well walk there and fly back in that time), and they had decided for some reason or other not to actually let me know about it (my guess is they're part of an international crime syndicate that doesn't want me to be readily available in criminal-ass-whooping mode.  i knew the post office would become corrupted once i left there).  

anyways, now i have a few cookbooks (with post-it notes throughout from my mother saying things like ""you don't have to use beans in this one.  you can use lentils instead,"" god bless her) of my very own and my shirt back.  yeah.

i voted to keep australia as part of the commonwealth because i basically saw it as spending a whole lot of money to change something that doesn't affect my daily life one bit.  i wish i could go back and change that, just to do my bit to make sure that no more fucking streets are named after monarchs.
my interview was at victoria street in fitzroy.  the place i took a leisurely stroll to was victoria street in brunswick (i'm fairly sure they're parallel too.  go team rather intellegent urban planning), which was occupied by a really nice old couple who were probably both pushing about 85 or so.  it took about five minutes for the lady of the house to get up and answer the door, and about ten for her husband to get up and try and help me out with the aid of a street directory as well.  it was pretty hard to politley get away from their helping out to run off in search of a phone.  but my love of the old folks of melbourne continues.

i rang up the place i was meant to be (tho i'm always where it's at), and explained rather apologetically what had happened.  i think they mistook the oh-fuck-they're-going-to-cut-my-payments wavering in my voice for i'm-going-to-cry-now style wavering (suckers), so they told me that i couldn't afford to get a cab down there and rescheduled my appointment for thursday.

found a bunch of scratched to hell cds lying on the footpath, all of which were in a completely unplayable state, but i took 13 tales from urban bohemia and divine madness home with me on some kind of principle or other.

hung around with miss trixie of firecracker in the evening and went to watch the architecture in helsinki launch.  she insisted on ignoring all the advice she'd heard to the contrary, and kept all six of her eggs in one basket (or handbag at least) in a pretty damn packed out corner hotel, but they all survived.  i vow to go to my next gig with a half-dozen faberge eggs in my pocket, things like that just damn well need showing up.

architecture were fucking fantastic, and they'd put _so_ much effort into their stage design (basically a couple hundred circles dangling from the roof / stuck on the walls, and a giant lit up display thing with some crossed fingers drawn on it in gaffer tape.  erm, i guess you had to be there).  

met up with the sugarkids for their farewell thingy at the brunswick (who apparently have to keep the noise down now due to complaints.  how the hell am i meant to cut a rug to the soulful dope beats of sir mix-a-lot with feeling if i can't hear the damn thing?  bah).  i  got into a slightly dodgy condition (hell, all the cool kids were doing it) and went a little quiet, but had a fun night nonetheless.  brett got his face painted like a cat while passed out on katies bed.  teh."

it was down the back of the couch after all.  i knew there was a reason i view cliches to be exactly the same thing as rational thought, but without all that bothersome cognitive effort.

now i know for sure that my theory that the entire works of proust are as dull as hell based purely on their covers (oh look, it's a funny-looking guy with a moustache.  how the hell is that effective marketing?  unless your entire target audience consists of bert reynolds' publicist.  they could at least draw a pirate hat and eyepatch on him to vaguely attract the youth demographic.  proust that is, tho it would probly increase mr reynolds fanbase too) is valid, and i won't have to worry about actually picking them up in order to read the action-packed 95 volume memoirs of someone who never got their damned arse out of bed.  

at least _i_ get up for the odd slice of toast or whatever, and therein is where the shindiggery and highbrow adventures only begin. (well, y'all seem to return for the next crazy installment anyways.  fools)."

"event","i haven't updated lately, so there has to be about four days (or whatever) of madcap hijinx to report back on.  right?

lets see:
on friday i went with daniel to see love of diagrams.  larisa no longer hold the title of wankiest annoying twats to play there (das butcher dressed in fake blood and a skeleton-apron and made crappy noises thru a microphone.  in a bad way)
on sunday i saw lord of the rings.  the great thing about geek-targeted films is that you know that you're not going to be the only one there by yrself.
on monday the great reign of ex-team discovery channel members finished.  brett's team did get second place, and they only beat us by one.  hmmph.

mel was thinking about coming down to watch the bats on saturday, but she can't make it.  hmph.  at least i get giant fucking gloating rights over probly everyone i know, whether they care or not.  
and they better fucking play boogey man, more for the reason that i can't afford to buy a copy of fear of god and it's been going thru my head all week than because it's such a fucking fantastic pop song.  stupid kazaa isn't fronting up with the goods either.

hmm.  i was going to just cut and paste the next post i wrote in order to finally delurk from sinister.  maybe i'm just weaseling out of things for my fifth year running, but i don't think this is the right introductory post."

"event","i love accidentally putting on just the right album at just the right moment.
since i've been in melbourne, i've spent a large amount of time just skulking around the house (even by my standards).  today i put on the go-betweens' liberty belle and the black diamond express to hang the washing out to, for no other reason than it was near my cd player, and it was one of those moments where everything just clicked and seemed good again (normally i just aim for things being okay.  i don't think anyone's every accused me of being an overachiever), and i felt like the mighty capn i used to be in perth.
i don't think i've danced around the house since i've been here (and if there's one argument that i'll accept as to why man _may_ be superior to other primates, it's not that we're able to build houses but that we're able to cut a rug inside their kitchens), and it's such a fantastic feeling to just be doing it again.

despite not really being able to afford to buy many cds these days - and i bought bright yellow bright orange only a couple of days ago (good, but more of a record to just stick on in the background.  their records always do take a while to sink in tho, so who knows) - i'm off into town now to buy the extended version of spring hill fair.  i've talked it over with the hole in my wallet, and it's conceded that it's the right thing to do, and we'll get by somehow."

"event","bah.  i basically never dream, give or take about twice a year (and take your damned ""actually, everyone dreams.  you just don't remember them"" cod-intellectual posturing and fuck off.  my memory's infallible, which can only mean that science (you know, that thing which used to babble on about the earth not being round, and has it's basis in alchemy) is just being flat out (geddit?  it's crazy anti-gallileo humour.  i'm suprised it never showed up in brecht) wrong. again). 

and now i'm going to have to wait another 6 months, hoping all the time that it's not wasted on a nightmare again.  short version (because you would've had to be there to care about the details.  plus, i was only there in a metaphysical sense, and i'm showing actual physical damage anyways.  so it's probly for the best):  it was something to do with dicking around on the internet while sitting outside, accidentally turning on a movie in the dvd drive while doing so, and having an amalgam of the troll from <a href=""http://us.imdb.com/Title?0092115"">troll</a>, the leprechaun from <a href=""http://us.imdb.com/Title?0107387"">leprechaun</a> and an odd spidery thing from, um, the deepest recesses of the places in my imagination where i don't go for a damn reason, coming from the screen to try to chew my leg off.
i'm not sure what freud would have to say about it, but i'm sure it would've been rude and as such i frankly don't want to know.  when _i_ was a lad, smutty little potty mouthed attention seeking smart-arses were made to stand facing a corner of the room with their mouths closed (sometimes writing out lines like ""i will not consider patricide for my mother's honour"" if they were still taking the punishment lying down (geddit? it's a psychiatrist's couch type joke.  oh, never mind)).  we sure as hell didn't hold them up as being heroes of modern thought and assist them in spreading their filth across the western world.

i went down to the shops immediately after to show the dark that it's tuff-guy ass wasn't going to scare me.  that and i needed cigarettes to calm myself down a bit.

there's a traditional folk saying in the south pacific - ""if you don't have a dream, how you gonna have a dream come true?""
*sigh*  i knew both richard rodgers _and_ oscar hammerstein II were gonna come get violent on my ass one of these days for larisa's crime of bulldozing the aural landscape to put up block housing.  i think using the supernatural to do so is fucking cheating tho.  a manly songwriting duo would challenge me to duelling banjos at dawn.

i'm going to go see me a hypnotist to ensure that i only dream about becoming a galactic buccaneer with a pet monkey and a robot sidekick.  then i can fulfill my lifelong quest of making it in the world, jimbo style, without actually putting any damn effort in."

"event","okayish weekend.  was feeling a little blah across the whole thing tho.

eveyone seemed to be a little drunk by the time they got to the brunswick on friday night anyways, so i don't think we did that much damage to our bartab.  couple of jugs worth at the max i think.  some tosser and his friend didn't take too kindly to rhys pretending to blow water down the back of his trousers which were rocking the plumber look (because what causes a loss of ""respect"" (what they were dribbling on about for the most part) is not in being an adult that's unable to dress yrself properly, but in having people find humour in it).  after about an hour or so of them getting increasingly threatening to get violent, we left.  maybe i'll understand testosterone fuelled aggression one of these days, but for now (and in the safety of my own bedroom) i'll just shake my head in disbelief.

saturday saw both casey rice (does making and producing good albums mean you can get away with fucking around with white noise for ages? no. no casey, it doesn't) and machine translations at different places.

spent sunday at ""rockpool"", a gig at the fitzroy swimming pool.  which was fucking hilarious in a small-town-hipster-lad-goes-to-the-bright-lights kind of fashion.  i don't know why looking at darren hanlon sitting down dangling his legs into the pool amuses me so much, but if it does then so be it.  and i'm forever going to kick myself for not asking tali to put sunscreen on my back when we were both raiding the free stuff on offer.  i suppose it's for the best tho.

i don't handle large amounts of strangers particularly well at the best of times, especially when uncaffinated (stupid anti-nestle vending machine principles.  goddamnit, they should bend the no pass-outs rule for people rocking the moral highground, and not just people wanting to nip out for a cigarette), so i spent a lot of the time skulking around doing my lovely shyness-masquerading-as-being-rude-and-distant thing.
most of the bands i paid attention to (architecture in helsinki, ninety-nine, b(if)tek) were fun.  still find laura's voice too damn strong to listen to ninety-nine on record tho.
one of the between-set dj's played both astrid gilberto and nancy sinatra.  rock.

i met a drunk old irish guy on the tram on the way home, who was into elbowing really hard, shaking hands a curious number of times, saying how much he loved australia and paul neuman.  probably the only person i've ever met that's been amused / impressed when i've told them that nobody can eat 50 eggs."

"event","after taking fucking ages (as usual) to decide just which go-betweens album i'd buy next, i realised that what i really wanted after all was to hunt out 1978-1990 on cd in the absence of the gatefold vinyl stored at my folks  (no, i'm not being a _totally_ snotty indie brat. it's the best fucking compliation ever. even if it lacks part company.  this girl black girl, people say and secondhand furniture get stuck in my head way more often anyways, and the liner notes more than make up for it.  plus, it would mean that we'd have it on 3 different formats in my family, and for some reason stuff like that amuses the crap out of me).  
then i saw that the new one was out nowish, and it would be a lot easier to just buy that than fuck around on ebay.

on my way into town an old guy on a bench at the bus stop started talking to me.  a lot of the time i couldn't understand what he was saying, because he spoke too softly with too thick an accent (we both knew i couldn't understand him, but neither of us seemed to mind).  for most of the time he was talking about the longines watch he bought off a guy on a street corner 52 years ago (why the hell does nobody do the ""psst.  buddy.  wanna buy a watch?"" while wearing a trenchcoat type shtick anymore?  yes, i disagree with the methods that tend to be used to get them inside the trenchoat in the first place, but living cliches are fucking hilarious)  that still went like clockwork (ha!),  the arguments he'd had with his wife over it and all the crazy adventures it'd been on having it's parts stolen by watch repairers and the trouble in getting them back.
he was saying some other stuff about the mafia and horse racing, but i couldn't quite make it out.  

in the future old guys on park benches will be the new odd mumbly guys that walk around town with jesus signs and/or ghetto blasters.  i'm hoping they'll also come with chess boards, like they do in eastern europe, and i vow to brush up on my game in preparation for when my time comes in a year or two.  as if looking forward to being able to blame my age on walking around wearing nothing but a standard issue laser gun wasn't enough already.

i spent fucking hours walking down brunswick street and around town looking for a birthday present for helen.  what the hell are you meant to get for someone that wants nothing, which you're starting to feel a little guitly about repeatedly giving her?  i'll figure it out one of these years.  

i found out that apparently the new go-betweens doesn't come out till monday anyways, and none of the stores seem to be stocking pre-release copies in order to make a point of how damn stupid having release dates and the likes are (if they never really cracked the charts back in their heyday, then why bother about it now anyways?  and i _like_ getting pent up about how stupid the world is for never giving them the longines-accuracy-approved time of day.  god know it's hard enough to manage all my current shticks without their success spoiling it all, forcing me to  worry about having to go and get a new one).  if they were _real_ popstars, they'd do as much as they could for the fans in the most selfless manner possible.  maybe i'll pledge my love to eddie vedder instead.  he seems to be much more in tune with my perpetual fucking whining."

at quiz night last night we had an even larger group than usual of assorted hangers on, so we had to split team discovery channel into 3 teams.  and took out first and second prizes - being a combined prize of a $75 bar tab.
i shall now reiterate that point in a larger font without using symbols and numerals.

a) the fact that we beat the arrogant dickhead at the table behind us who seemed to believe that everyone in the room would confuse his constant yelling out of everything he knows with him actually knowing everything

in short:
i spent most of yesterday skulking around the house in a tracksuit because the weather seemed to encourage it and i was feeling a bit mopey anyways for various reasons.  i called meg as well to catch up on what's happening in perth and to try and get over my tendency to not keep in touch with people very well.

was feeling a lot better when i woke up this morning, partly due to the wine i drank out of a mushroom bag (the wine didn't come with a paper bag, so i had to make do) clad bottle restoring whatever nutrients i'm missing to my system, and partly because the weather was okay.

when i went downstairs to check the mail i received a package from master terry of underwear with the belle and sebastian 2002 peel sessions, and a letter talking about time machines, light globes and saying things like ""i have been trying to convince george w bush that he is far more likely to get a payrise if he strikes with the backing of a union"". ha!  plus the stores will probly put up their christamas in july decorations pretty soon (can't see what they would have against putting them up as stupidly early as they do at regular old jeebus style christmas), and i can be all festive like with the aid of the bns christmas sessions.
damn i miss the kids in perth.

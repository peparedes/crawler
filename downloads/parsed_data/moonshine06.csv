"event","so its been like over a year since ive last written here.so much has happened since then.there was me changing my major from early childhood to cosmetology.i figured since i already have two little boys who are pretty much my own,that was a fair enough dose of little kids for me.i started school in march and it was an interesting start.during that timeframe,mike broke his leg at the end of may,and we broke up in june.well so i thought.we kept hooking up and talking and everything so we decided to give it another shot.didnt work so we broke up a week later,and thought that was the complete end of it.during that breakup i dated some guy in texas over the internet for a week named matt.he was nice and all but it just felt like a huge part of me was missing.so i broke up with matt,and slowly started talking to mike again.i also got into a huge spat with his mom back in june,which didnt make things at all easy for me.we've been back together since like july/august and we couldn't be any happier,despite the fact that his mom and grandparents dont know that we're dating.i will be moving in with him in a few months,hes in school and was/is working and making money.but im happy in that department.since ive last posted,i weighed in at 260 pounds.since then ive lost about 40 and am down to 228.30 of it ive lost by myself.and the other 12 so far ive lost doing weightwatchers,and its going really well.school is a dramafest and i dont need it.thats pretty much it for now."

"event","so lately i havent been having too much fun at my house.i get ridiculed for everything that happens and blamed for everything that i didnt even do. so thats why i have decided to move out and start my life. at the moment im looking for a job so that i will be able to afford my own apartment,around may michael will be moving in to help me with rent so that we can both get our life together started.shortly after i will be starting school in the fall for early childhood development in hopes of getting a degree in childcare so i can work with little kids,it would be the perfect career for me because im really good with children.my mom will most likely be helping me out a little bit when i first move in,the only problem is i dont know how im going to get my car away from my dad,considering i need it to get from point a to point b. kristen said she will teach me how to shop right and help me set myself up with housewares and such.good luck to me!!"

After All-Cher and Peter Cetera

Well here we are again
I guess it must be fate
We've tried it on our own
But deep inside we've known
We'd be back to set things straight
I still remember when
Your kiss was so brand new
Every memory repeats
Every step I take retreats
Every journey always
Brings me back to you
CHORUS:
After all the stops and starts
We keep coming back to these two hearts
Two angels who've been rescued from the fall
And after all that we've been through
It all comes down to me and you
I guess it's meant to be
Forever you and me
After all
When love is truly right
This time it's truly right
It lives from year to year
It changes as it goes
Oh and oh the way it grows
But it never disappears
Chorus
Always just beyond my touch
Though I needed you so much
After all what else is living for
Whoa
Chorus (2x)"

"event","ok well theres not too much going on right now,i talked to mikes friend jessica about being pregnant but after we talked it out then she realized she couldnt possibly be.she can only wait it out,as for me,i cant possibly be either because im on birth control and we're really careful.i actually think me and him are going to the movies this weekend hopefully. and then he said that maybe we can go to the beach next weekend,but thats the weekend of my friend rae-ann's party,and i promised her i would go.just as long as the day we go is saturday and not sunday,if it was on sunday,i wouldnt know what to do,because i want to spend time with both of them..*confused* and ive also been thinking of getting an apartment for myself,but it might not happen until mike turns 18 when he can leave and his mom cant say anything about it. took my nephews swimming on saturday,which was successful for the most part. travis was fine in his little float just riding the waves in the pool and everything.damien on the other hand had to be pulled in by me just to get him in the water,in which he decided to cling to me for dear life the whole time until i put him on one of the steps and then he was fine. went to walmart with tash too.i didnt get home til 10, we were outside playing with her dogs.theyre so goofy lol. then today i was supposed to clean my room and everything, and then go swimming at mcgraths pond with tash,but i couldnt because i forgot that sundays are family days. and then i went to walmart again tonight to go apply again and help my sister take care of the boys. then some bitch i know from school was walking around with her 1 year old little sister, her boyfriend and her friend and the minute i saw her we shot each other such nasty looks. then i proceeded to see the bitch like 4 more times while i was there. by the way its soo great to go out in public with your boyfriend and a baby,hmm i would think that people would think it was your kid.but it was different with me because i was with my sister and they do look like my kids,dont mean i want them though lol.then i check mikes myspace to find out one of my ""so called"" friends cousins is threatening to fight him...umm i dont fucking think so because if anyone touches him,thats the last thing they touch because thats the person i want to spend the rest of my life with and nobody is going to hurt him whatsoever. ok im done with my drama for now."

"event","wow todays been really fun.got tp go to hallowell for a job to find out that its door to door...haha NO THANKS.so then i came home and called tash.we decided to go swimming at mcgraths pond,which was a load of fun until we got invaded by little 3 year olds*growls*. then we came back to my house and went fourwheeling forever,and then we went on the hammock,which she fell off of like a bajillion times lol. so by the end of the day,we were just a big muddy mess (yay for mudding).good thing tash didnt wear her pink skirt,which was wicked cute,so i let her keep a pair of black shorts that she was only supposed to borrow,but its ok since theyre like almost up to my ass,but that aint necessarily a bad thing lol(jk).then i went balistic because i couldnt find my camera,so i went up the trail like 4 times,no success.then mike invited me over to his house later on for a campfire (yay!!:)).we were gonna sit on the ground but we ended up bringing the swing over and we sat on that.then his gram gave us 6 boxes of sparklers,(yay for sparklers!)which we didnt even use all of. then without my knowing they were on the ground,he accidentally broke them,i seriously almost cried,he gave me a hug and kiss to make me feel better though:). his mommy gave me chocolate because they were making smores and i dont like smores..so i just had 2 reeses cups and shared a hersheys bar with mike,and i somehow managed to get chocolate on my chest lol,i dont even want to know how that happened. so then he walked me back to the fence before we parted ways for the night,so it was a pretty fun and umm interesting day.oh and just for the record,im not sick anymore:):).

FAR AWAY-NICKELBACK

This time, This place
Misused, Mistakes
Too long, Too late
Who was I to make you wait
Just one chance
Just one breath
Just in case there's just one left
'Cause you know,
you know, you know

[CHORUS]
That I love you
I have loved you all along
And I miss you
Been far away for far too long
I keep dreaming you'll be with me
and you'll never go
Stop breathing if
I don't see you anymore

On my knees, I'll ask
Last chance for one last dance
'Cause with you, I'd withstand
All of hell to hold your hand
I'd give it all
I'd give for us
Give anything but I won't give up
'Cause you know,
you know, you know

[CHORUS]

So far away
Been far away for far too long
So far away
Been far away for far too long
But you know, you know, you know

I wanted
I wanted you to stay
'Cause I needed
I need to hear you say
That I love you
I have loved you all along
And I forgive you
For being away for far too long
So keep breathing
'Cause I'm not leaving you anymore
Believe it
Hold on to me and, never let me go
Keep breathing
'Cause I'm not leaving you anymore
Believe it
Hold on to me and, never let me go
Keep breathing
Hold on to me and, never let me go
Keep breathing
Hold on to me and, never let me go

Every time our eyes meet
This feeling inside me
Is almost more than I can take
Baby when you touch me
I can feel how much you love me
And it just blows me away
I've never been this close to anyone or anything
I can hear your thoughts
I can see your dreams
I don't know how you do what you do
I'm so in love with you
It just keeps getting better

I wanna spend the rest of my life
With you by my side
Forever and ever
Every little thing that you do
Baby I'm amazed by you
The smell of your skin
The taste of your kiss
The way you whisper in the dark
Your hair all around me
Baby you surround me
You touch every place in my heart
Oh it feels like the first time every time
I wanna spend the whole night in your eyes

I don't know how you do what you do
I'm so in love with you
It just keeps getting better
I wanna spend the rest of my life
With you by my side
Forever and ever
Every little thing that you do
Baby I'm amazed by you

Every little thing that you do
I'm so in love with you
It just keeps getting better
I wanna spend the rest of my life
With you by my side
Forever and ever
Every little thing that you do
Oh, every little thing that you do
Baby I'm amazed by you"

Dear Kathleen,
I thought you wanted to come to Florida to be with your friends and live a fun amazing care-free gum lifestyle??
Now it seems as though this is some sort of career movement, you wanna go to a university in Gainsville and shit
I donno... but you know I support anything you do and I know you know that but I just see life in this way... we live and 
mess around stressin then we have some good times meet some cool people then we get old and miserable
then we die unless something gets fucked up before... you know I do think its important to have a good life where
you can support yourself and have a career you enjoy and maybe even making a diffrence in the world
but i think we should stick together man and take the easy road thats what road im on and I'm not telling you
to drop out I'm just saying... well... you know what do what your really really wanna do and be happy with it
I SUPPORT YOU ALL THE WAY KUPO! but hey we just need to think alot for the next year or so figure shit out
but i mean i love ya man and I really think it would be some kick ass shit if our plans pull through...

This Bittersweet Symphony played 'tll the day that I died

A memoir of myself

The dedication of a lifetime:
Without these ladies I would cease to exist KMMANS
To:
Kathleen-Because she is my best friend
Michelle-Because it was always uncomfortable
Michaela-Because I helped her clean the kitchen once
Angelica-Because she was always sitting next to me
Natasha-Because I couldn't do it without me
Sasha-Because she knows everything, even when she dosen't

To the boys in my life... I made them important
To:
Cory-Because we tried to dig to China together
Ramone-Because he started the lust
Carlos-Because he was my first
Jeffrey-Because I was wrong all along

To the people who are responsible for my creation
and the events that derailed their teachings,
All in all it has been for the best.
Thank you from the bottom of my heart

______________________________________________________

I'm not sure right now. I don't have too much experience, let alone a guess as to how this works. I'm not sure if that's important or not. There's no romance here, not even a life story, simply me trying to comfort myself with the idea that I'm not the alone in the world. Experiences and observations merely, things I think about and the lives of some of the most amazing people to ever walk this earth.

Sometimes the escapes would make us forget. It wasent just me though, we all tryed to runaway at some point, that's what the drugs were for, maybe I should have taken that route. To me it wasen't reality and that's all I wanted to be. Maybe that's how they felt in the begining they just became comfortable with that uncomfortable feeling. The movies helped sometimes. Watching them repetitively always seemed to deepen the emotions. For me it was like clouds and a white shinning light, all you can really make out is silhouettes running in slowmotion, laughing. Not the hysterical crying laughes we had when we'd watch Baseketball but the laughing were your mouth is open and your eyeslids are weightless, the wind was blowing and we had on our favorite outfits, we didn't feel exposed or fat, we weren't on our period and we had just eaten sushi, that feeling is geniune and the laugh wasent faking at all, just complete peace and amusement. At the end of Thirteen when Tracy's spinning around in circles your still so confused, you saw it all but it slipped from underneather you. Why? Why did that happen? When she throws her head back and screams your all alone in confusion but yet you understand completly, those were the feelings we lived for, those were the thrills we seeked and the adrenaline we craved. It's the best feeling in the world. The Incubus songs brought it out too... the 311, Nirvana, Papa Roach, Jack Johnson the soundtracks for Thirteen and the Virgin Suicides, we all had our own. That was the music that touched all of us. Even the rap.... the Three Six, Lil' whyte, any song about getting fucked up, it brought ta feeling out too. Closing your eyes and leaving your body, just bobbing your head and losing all your thoughts. Relating to the slow dreary beats of those songs, spinning around in circles and not being able to think straight ... even when we were completly sober.

I know people have it bad you know, and I'm not one of them, none of us were. There is no pity here, whether, it be for myself or someone else. I realize the effects of hormones and that this time is meant to be confusing for me, for all of us. We're young and they were right all along, we dont know anything, and we tried to grow up to fast.
I don't know why we are the way we are or how we got this way, but I can tell you things we have in common and show you our world from the side of the couch I'm sitting on. This is just another way for me to find myself, trying to break out of this mold I've created for myself in my mind.

Misjudged, or at least I think. I find myself living a life not meant for my thoughts or feelings, my viewpoints or my beliefs, how could a play planned out so well go so completely, wrong? 
This walk is not meant for our fall,
Our ocean not meant for pollution,
Children who were never meant to be corrupted,
A destiny never meant to be discovered,
and perhaps even lives never meant to be lived.

Nothing was supposed to be like this you know.... nothing."

So career goals and aspirations:

no one really to talk to now no one I can walk into the next room and find sitting there waiting for me
Just another gloomy time to myself with a mind and a heart not made for my body
and emotion hard to handle and a life misunderstood by no other person except myself

contradicting my words and actions with every minute that passes 

My stomach is wrenching beyond belief and each breathe feels heavier and deeper

So sasha's back from that place and here it goes... I would give anything in the world to hear her voice and to hug her and have her tell me everythings going to be okay my deepest thoughts were ingulfed into her my dreams and aspirations my whole being was spilled into her we were ripped away from reality for so long and our world was like no other I know that and so does she through all the bullshit she is sasha and only that I wish her the best that can be and thoughts of her become more and more unsettled.

thats all I want just someone to tell me that.. you know.. that everything is going to be okay.. I find myself saying that everyday
hormones need to die 

everything kinda feels like a lie and a devious plan to destroy... 

Jeffrey and I are together again which makes me happy 2 months on the 18th but you know I wish someone would just talk to me

I cant call anyone, you guys are all to happy I don't want to remind you of the stupidity in the world which is me

I went to work today and like Juan was asking me all these questions... about if I feel diffrent about him and shit like that.. (Juan and I kissed the other night, I was somewhat sober and he was falling over drunk) It was very akward... he's 21 but he looks and acts like hes 16. I don't know it was just strange, I didn't want to talk to him, he asked me to go out with him tonight but I told him I was going to Jeff's. I really have no romatic feelings for him at all, it just happened!

But Alas! I am home I just watched the Oscars with my mom... ???? dont ask

I'm hungry too... but I cant eat... I feel like crying, I wish I could just call Rob and tell him I'm sorry and how much I do really care... I don't know this is stupid he's such a great friend but after yesterdays wicked ass fight I dont know what to do.

Life should really not be taken as seriously as I am taking it right now, but hey it's hormones it will pass and I'll find myself middle aged longing for the past and reading philosophy books screaming bring on the mid-life crisis!!!!
The future is scary, I am afraid of myself later in life -what I may become -bad decsions -relationships -having a kid and then fucking them up 
nothing is forever though and I dont mean nothing is forever i mean NOTHING.... as in the word as in emptyness ZERO, zip is forever fuck it you wont get it unless you hear me say it (<---  this put a smile on my face)<--thought this was important to tell you<---hope you understand this whole comment arrow thing<---im taking this too far<--- haha hi mom!<---okay I'll stop now<-......JUST KIDDING!

If people build upon a pre-obtained adolecent personality as they get older I'm fucked.

I went to see him today in BFE and I got lost like 4 times and pulled over twice to argue with someone on the phone. Jeffrey called me today and pulled his stunt, pretending like everything is fine and ""hey baby""-ing me, well I hate this because a part of me just wants to go along... I swear the child has some serious amnesia problems. Being with Rob today was kind of werid I only stayed thier for like 15 I could have stayed longer but I just felt out of place... like I had been shifited from my territory, come to think of it I always feel like that. Except for when I'm in San Francisco, there's just something about that place that can make anyone feel like they've found themselves.

I know I'll regret this when I'm older ... not savering the time I have at this age wasting my youth... just laying around waiting to grow up, little do I know what lies before me, the hardships and heartbreaks, the struggles and confusion, pain, and the ever hated process of growing up and getting old... but eh what can ya do?

Yea so me and Jeffrey are no longer together... you see I am not going to talk him anymore because I should have never been with him in the first place... he's my dream boy I mean without him to think about what will I think about... It was cool being with him for the past month but you know its better if we just stay friends and lol I told him like just like that and recieved the utter face of bewilderness. I mean he's to set for himself, he has a routine and a lifestyle, I don't think I can accomadate him as well as a fellow Puerto Rican woman. I mean I'm a million people and I need someone who can go along with whatever I'm doing that day, and not someone whom I have to be afraid to tell how I feel or what I want to do. I don't think he understands because I hid my feelings from him but I hurt him and it will only better him in the end so once again my work is done and I'm on to the next. Theres the theory of there's someone out there for everyone and by being with as many people as possible I am only bettering my chances of testing this theory. But I have hit boyfriend #33 and I'm only seventeen and maybe I need to start some preferences and qualifications instead of just jumpin in to the relationship pool. Out of every guy I've been with theres only been one maybe two that I believed possesed the potential of a well rounded relationship but by withholding my personality in fear of rejection everything fell through. 

Neways so the break up was offical on valentines day but was unoffical on the 3rd
Since then I've been talking to Rob, recieved 4 numbers, was told by a good friend that he was in love with me, recieved a bouqet of flowers and asked out on 3 dates... why is this so difficult... at my job everyone is at least 5 years older than me so everyone in the mall assumes that since I work full time I must be 21 thats the average age Ive been told...
In the state of florida I am what Jeffrey would call a clank clank (handcuffs clanking) because yes I am illegal to the 23-30 year olds that are constantly asking me out! I need a warning sign or somthing I'm so sick of this! leave me alone!

Anyways I like Rob, I'm taking it as slow as possible, if I were to be with him I really would have to give up all the other shit going on with the Premium Outlet Mall (where I work)
And to tell you the truth I'm willing it's about time someone like Rob come along, even thought I dated him 2 years ago. 
I can say what I want and I'm not afraid with him so thats a rare and good feeling. I'm excited
Well Ive written enough Farewell!

Further proof that everything works out eventually
It is kind of spooky I mean I always wanted to be with him
and I always thought of him being the one guy I would always like but would never get to be with like some superstar of Enrique or something 
It sucks thought, I was always comfortable of always know that no matter what I could always rely on thinking about Jeff, like whenever I was single I would just go around comparing everyone to Jeff but now that I have him what am I going to do when it ends?? oh well who cares another name to add to the file's and another heart to break in a million pieces, the male population are scum and my sole mission in like is to give them what they deserve. I'm not a lesbian but fucking feminism all the fucking way!!! (where are you Ginger Spice?)
I got a gun pointed at me and I go shot at over at papa john's the other day well not last friday but the friday before, dad and mom said I should quit so I did

He got mad at me for getting mad at him for not telling me anything, god damn am I wrong? So we got in a wicked fight and I hung up on him cooled off for a few days then he called me the day before he was leaving... ignored that call, listened to the message and he wanted to hang out muwhaha... well whatever I spent the night at Hollys and Sammy came over, they listened to me rant on about Rafael as I was forced to witness their loby-doby tendencies protraing their beyond perfect caring relationship YUCK FUCKING YUCK MAN!
Yea, sooo I go inside and give them some alone time... sheesh, I'm bored, Flo isn't answering so I give the Brazilian a ring and we chat, argue for a bit, then we make up, so alls well that ends well I guess... so the end still may be near but you know what he's gonna be in Boston, I'll be in Chicago, diffrent states man, calls for some helllla fucking times

What he dosen't know won't hurt him, besides I don't trust him so why should I have to live up for his trust in me?

I need some more jewerly, I love jewerly.
I want to go tanning too, get a tomagotchi at Toys 'r Us, I dont know if they make them anymore but I need to find out those things are amazing.

'06 represent. I donno I still have a little attachment to my year, I mean common thats my year!
Or was supposed to be?
Maybe I'm making a big deal out of this, no I would know if this was a mistake, I can always feel when something is a mistake, I feel it in my stomach and it's a very distinctive feeling, I feel excitment and determination.

My buisness teacher just came up to me and goes, ""I don't think you should do this it's a mistake..."" UM OKAY THANKYOU FOR THAT INVALUABLE INPUT. Man, her name is Barbra Barber... um and I'm suppose to listen to her? She's one of those academic success story types, here to spread her experiances and knowledge to a resentful, youthful, and powerful generation, hummm... your a teacher and at horrible school with over 5,000 students... it's a D school! (the highest grade in our district) 35% White 25% hispanic 30% black 8% Middle Eastern 3% Asian American and other... Yea, were a big diverse group. One in every 5 students will drop out of Dr. Phillips before their Junior year. More people get held back than any other school in our district. It's just a discrase, Florida education, it's a joke, a big huge joke.
She should have taken your scholarship and use it towards something a bit more lucrative don't you think?

I've just been hanging out in my classes and soakin' up my precious time with the people I spent the past 3 years of my life with. Most of them I might never see again.. how sad... NOT! But no it is kind of werid leaving so soon. It's gonna take some time to get use to but I won't be in school for about a month, could I ask for more?

Sometimes I wonder if I'm making the right decision but you know what, life is all about taking risks and making decisions and it's up to you to make the best of what you decide to do. Sure it's gonna be a challenge and theres gonna be alot of hard times but the race is long... and in the end it's only with yourself quoting Baz Lurman there but I don't quite know exactly what he meant by saying that but I have this feeling inside me that it will help me out someday.

At 11:30AM I have a scheduled appointment with Mr. Conry, The guidance Counselor of DOOM. I'm going to talk to him about getting my GED. I have made up my mind that this is what I'm going to do, I have the information, the drive, and my father is all for it and that's all I need to know. Now, as far as when I am leaving school I'm bewildered, also on where I can go to take some prep courses. I really want to get out and get this over with but I always have to wonder. I know this is a good idea because I'm going to go to college, just a year earlier. If I stay in high school I know that I'm gonna end up at a community college anyway so why not jump the gun and get there sooner. I really would like to go to San Francisco, I always have to wonder if my sister was taking me seriously when I said I wanted to go there. 
Kathleen is probably going to finish with high school, which was her plan and thats fine with me, I can just meet up with her later. I hope this all works out for the best.
I never regret the past because I am happy with myself. 
If it were not for the past I would not be the person I am today, even if some of the decisions I made were not so smart and maybe some things I said were'nt completely necessary, I can accept and embrace that. 

You know, this means I need to grow up. I mean wow I'm going to be in college next year, and if I can get where I want to be I'll be with my sister in a whole other city, state, hell a different region, far away from my parents and starting all over from scratch. I'm going to be an adult with real responsibilities. I'll have to get a job and pay for everything I do, prepare my own food, my bills, fucking pull my weight in society man!
Bring it on man, fucking bring it on!

Wish me luck on this meeting, I'm going to walk in with aggression and motivation. I'll have my way with him. He won't treat me like shit this time... no no no. I'll write later on with an analysis on the situation.

"event","HA! I haven't written in a long ass time. Not that it matters becasue I know I'm the only person who reads this anyway... sheesh...
Okay school started and I'm actually happy about it.  I've met some new cool people and saw some old cool people, and I was slapped in the face with realization that I've left alot of people behind. 
I guess I'm too busy to notice this all.  I wish I had more time to myself though I'm always being told to do something and it pisses the hell out of me. I'm doing quite well in school and I've gotten over my troubled time.  I like this new guy and he's awesome.  I'm going to download aim right now I'll talk to you all later."

"event","God damn, 
I went to citywalk last night and met theses guys from a band called The Drive they were from Boston, thier going to be playing at Will's Pub tonight... FuCk ThAT
Anyway we hung out with them for what seemed like forever. Then we saw the people I went there for, I was excited but being that all my frineds are total cunts they told our people to met up with us later and went with the band... fucking groupies 
They invited us to thier hotel so we went and Holly hooked up with a monotonous little Aston Kutcher look alike and Sasha supposedly found her sould mate... the bands lead singer who is umm strange, yet like Sasha he is convinced that he knows all.
While all the hooking up and soul mating was going on Angelica and I went to Denny's and ate the best onion rings and cheese sticks I've ever had in my life!
If it werent for the Denny's I would have murderd someone...
Then we called a cab to go Angelicas at around 3 and the cab dosent get there tell about 4  he takes the long way, we pay 12 bucks...
We finally got to sleep at about 5:45
Today we hung out with cameron tim and chris ..
I'm so dead tired it's not even funny.
I'll write later u need a long SLEEP!
later

"event","Antonina is forcing me to become confirmed... I just recieved this news and now I feel as though I should die. I myself am agnostic but this summer my feelings toward all this were more Athiest if anything. 
I don't really care about having a religion or weither or not there is a God or higher power or whatever. It's too damn confusing so I wont waste my time with it.
But now I'm being forced to practice a sacrement of a religion I want absolutly nothing to do with. I have to go to sunday school and I have sworn that I will not agree with anything they tell me! If they state something I do not agree with I shall agrue my ass off until I am asked to leave to room. I WILL NOT STAND FOR THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!
I will never agree with what some bitch lady I dont even know tells me... almost 70% of the catholic religion follow it because thier whole lives someone has told them that THIER right... EVERYONE ELSE IS WRONG!
I plan to think about this for a year... when I am 39 years old on my 39 birthday I will know what I believe...
I like to plan ahead. I feel very happy.... ok you know what  I just needed to state this... no offense meant to anyone... I'm open for agruement to anyone who wants a old fashioned debate... mind you I am the queen of debate. 
I only have one rule though and that is IN ORDER TO AGRUE WITH ME YOU MUST FIRST KNOW WHAT THE FUCK YOUR TALKING ABOUT...
I will not stand for stupidity, or unknowlegdeable people
well maybe I'll write tonight so everyone can know about my night
BYE!

"event","Planning on going over to Angelica's today. I was planning on seeing Holly but Sasha needs me to color her hair. She better pay me.  Antonina said I had to clean my room... I did but she is making up bull shit exuses that I'm not yet finished. If you dont take at least 2 hours for every task she assigns you then it's not completed; what a hard braud to please.  I'm really not looking forward to doing Sasha's hair now that I'm thinking about it. For those of you who don't know Sasha has extremly long hair and it's all over  the place and very hard to manage. Personally I think she should just shave her head and save everyone the trouble...
It's going to be a mess I know it. 
Tonight were going to citywalk and I think they want to go into the Groove which I refuse to do... tonight is the last teen night before school starts and it cost 20 dollars... a huge rip off.  So many people are going to be there tonight. I'm looking foward to seeing a few people and I'm hoping one perticular person will be going also.
Ugh okay let me explain this because it's making me insane...
After Chris and I broke up I was overwhelmed with content. I was truley excited that i was finally single and free from the hasells of my retarded relationship with him...
I had met this one guy the other day and I thought he was extremly cute and nice and all that. My mind took over and I became stupid and tried to talk to him in that I-Like-You-And-I-Want-You-To-Know way. But I was still with Chris so I couldnt take it to the point were I was being unfaithful(not that I really care) But anyway, I started talking to him a bit more after that and now I have relized that he is ethier extremly mysertious and shy or hes just plan stupid. So, I've decided to hold on him and let it go, whatever happens happens and I will not go out of my way to lead it to something that may become yet another stupid Natasha Mistake.
Right now I'm wearing a 30 dollar tank top from Hollister, it's insane its like a little piece of clothe I could see it priced for 5 dollars, but its Hollister so it of course is way over priced. It's not mine though, I would never step into a store that had 30 dollar tank tops. 
I better get going so I can leave this place bfore 5 ugh...
Bye bye

"event","Mall today with Sasha. New shoes. New shirt. New jewelry.
I had a ok time... suprising being that I was at the mall;The Florida Mall which I loathe. There were many a person there, it was insane. We got our patching for our posse it says Tank Girl on it...
Oh well at least it's intresting, though I don't think I'm prepard to deal with the constant ""what does that mean?"" questions from people who are of no significant importance to me. I'm actually please about going to school on the 11th, I get to see all my friends everyday! I'm sure I will loathe the idea though, the second the alarm clock goes off at 5:30 in the morning. Asuming that's a decent estiment of what actual time it will be.
Umm, Holly's back today. Yea-ie.  Tomorrow I'm dedicating my time to her.  I love Holly. I missed her, she's been in chicago for like a month.
Well let's see.
Nothing else lubies.
I bid you all a pleasant farewell.

"event","I have my live-journal! Yea-ie, thanks to Discontent Jeff who gave me my code, thanks much Jeff. Anyways I'm sure he is one of the very few people who will be viewing my journal being that I refuse to post it on my Buddy Profile. This Journal is invitation only my friends, feel special. Anyways, update on my self-improvement, steady progress... everything going well, the last major thing left is the cat, very soon my friends very soon, everything needs to be planned out and prepared. Anyways, broke up with Chris recently, new guy in mind though so all is not lost. Chris should have seen it coming, but I heard he took it quite well and I quote ""Ima go to tha groove find a girl and fuck her brains out, if i cant have a steady girlfriend i should at least get sum ass"" Thankyou to my source who supplied me with this information. I know it is quite vial but you all need to know of his hobo scumness(not that there's anything wrong with hobos they just resemble him) Anyways as many of you already know, I, Natasha Nicole Anderson, as a human am completely indestructible and my life is impenetrable, and I'm sure you know that at the slightest provocation I shall let loose a merciless barrage of fury... I rule all. I think I've spoken to a few people about this but just double checking that you all are aware. Also my original statement (ahem) which I have decided to use as my personal slogan; from this moment on I am know as..
Natasha Anderson
 ""A VERITABLE FIST OF DEFIANCE I STAND IMMUNE TO ANY ONSLAUGHT!""
Pretty amazing huh?
Anyways I've decided that all butchers shall demise.
Meat is Murder. Animals are living things also.
S.P.A.W.
Society for the Promotion of Animal Welfare.
God damn it I'm babbling again, well I shall retire to my bed now. This was fun I think I'll do it again tomorrow. Until then my loves.

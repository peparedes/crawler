I am really happy right now and I hope that me and Bob can still be friends and hang ou like we used to I really enjoy his company and I dont want to lose him as a firend or anything like that. So now I have more time to do what I want adn go out with who I want. I also gained a friend with benefits some people already know who that is and I wont say because it is on the hush hush for now.  I am excited to start doing things I used to and being free to party and date random guys and not have anything serious for a while atleast. Thats really all for now"

"event","It has been a while since I have witten but since then things have been a lot better anI am glad in the last week I have hung out with the group and it was like the old days I really enjoyed it. I also have been dealing with some things going on in my life and theey have not been so great I dont know what to think anymore and I just want things to be good again but as they say you made the bed so lay on it. That is what I have to do now and I have to deal with the consequences of my actions. I really just give up on the situation and I really dont care anymore. I will do better next year and I know I can do it and I know what I want to do in my life so I will do better.  Other than that I am ok and I really like how things are going for the most part. I am glad that things between me and Nina are ok and that everyone for the moment is getting along. I will update soon"

"event","No one really reads these things but I like being able to write down my thoughts so I dont care, but I have a few thoughts that I want to get out so here it goes. Sometimes when you just sit and think about things you really start to question what you are doing with your llife and if you have made any good decision for yourself. The thing is I think that my life is great and that I have great friends but I question it sometimes because the people who I hang out with are into things that I am not down with. I mean I dont care it is there life but when they try and push it on me I dont think it is cool. I really hope that people realize sooner than later that they need to quit some of the things that they are doing and realize that they are going to end up in a situation that they dont want to be in. I am not going to yell at anyone that is why I am writing it down because if I start saying things then I will get yelled at. The only reason I say things is because I really care and I dont want to see anything happen to them. Maybe I care a little too much because they are going to do it whether I care or not so maybe I wont bother to say anything at all. This sounds like a repeat of last entry's but it really isnt I from now on am going to exclude myself from certain situations when certain people are around becuase of the fact that I dont like them and I dont have to be around them if I dont want to be. I am also not talking to anyone when this group gets together because I dont want to waste my time with people that dont even care whether or not I am there anyway. I dont exsist to these people at ceratin points so therefore I am going to remove myself and there will be no problem. That is all"

"event","Ok the Drama that I told you I was going to write about has just happened today. My bestest friend in the world has broken up with her boyfriend and he was definitely crushed. I have to admit that I do feel bad and I dont know how to make him feel better. This would not be the first time that a guy has talked to me and cried about the girl who just broke up with him. I know that he will get over it but for now it is going to be a bumpy road. This also means that some of our group will be seperated but i guess you will always have that. As for me things are still going great and I couldnt be happier. Me and  nina have worked out our problems and I actually got to go up and see Andrea by myself for once. It was really nice just the two of us and we didnt have anyone around to bother us. We havent had our girl time in a while so it was really nice to see her. I really really miss her when she is at school and I cant see her like i used to. It seems so long ago that we were in high school and saw each other everyday. But people have to grow up and I am just glad that we are not growing apart. Another thing I am glad about is that I have Nina to be around with me to hang out with or to cry with ( we dont cry over boys ) and be my sister. I dont know how it happened but I dont think you could find two people that click like we do. I love hanging out with her and even though she has her weird points and her faults I wouldnt trade her for the world. I am really going to miss her next year when she goes to Slippery Rock and hopefully she wont forget me because I know that I could never forget her. I think I might cry if I keep going so I will change the subject. I hope that I never lose Andrea or Nina I dont know where I would be without them. I hope that I never lose anyone and that we will always have fun no matter what happens down the road."

"event","I dont really have that much to say I just feel like putting some of my thoughts down. As most people know I have completely dropped out of school the only thing is that I didnt tell my parents because they would kill me but o well what are ya going to do. I think that now I made the wrong decision but I cant change it now because all of my classes have given me an incomplete so now I have to live with the decision I made. Moving on to other things I really think that a lot of people have chnged in the past few months I feel like I dont know who anyone is anymore. I geuss it is a part of growing up and I will just have to deal but I like things the way that they are and I dont want to see anything change. I hope that next year when everyone has gone their seperate ways that they have done what they have always wanted to do and that everyone remains close. I have the best group of friends and though they may be a little wierd at some points I love all of them. I really hope that next year I will be more focused and I will be able to handle school for real. I am very content with my life and I love that everything seems to be going ok for now. I have a wonderful boyfriend and I love having him around me. He has been the best thing for me and I really love him for always being there when I need him the most. If thing dont work out between us I still would love to be around him and be his friend and help him through anything that he would ever need. It is nice to knw that I have great friends who always look out for me and are there to be a shoulder to cry on or someone to laugh with and have a good time. Thats all for now I am sure that I will be writing about some drama that will happen but for now everything is calm and that is the way I like it."

"event","Ok so everyone needs a place to wirte down there thoughts and so I thought that htis might help me relax. I dont normally right anything down because I tend to keep everything to myself and until recently it had been a pretty good method. Then some people decicided that I to tell me that it would help if I opened up about things. Well geuss what it has only gotten me in trouble. I am no longer going to say anyhting that Ii think because when I did I just got yelled at and I am tired of having to be told that everything that I do is completely wrong. I am also tired of listening to people and them not wanting to listen to anyhting that I ahev to say. I t really sucks when you have to sit there and listen to people complain all the time but once you say something or complain you get yelled at. I am tired of being told that my problems are not as big as everyone elses problems are. Yes everyone goes through rough times and as I have siad before I am always willing to listen but I would like the same kind of treatment back. If anyone wanted my advice I would give it to them but since it seems like that everytime I offer mny advice I am told that I am butting in too much and that I dont have any idea as to what I am talking about, I am just not telling anyone what I think anymore and I am going to go back to the way I used to be and keep everything inside. In the end I am the one to get husr and in the end I never come out on top so why try? My life has not been easy and really no one has the perfect life but I cant help that and the reason I want to keep everything in is because I am used to  being ignored and left out so now that I am older it has taken a toll on me. I am not very social and I really only have a few select friends that I like to habg out with. I have a very hard time talking to new people. I am always to scared to say anyhting to anyone because I am afraid of what they will think and the moment that I hear any critcism about me I just want to quit. I know that it is supposed to help but for me I have had enough for my lifetime. Which moves me on to my next subject which is me leaving. I want to move away and leave this place for good. Me leaving is for me to start over and I know that people are upset with me and they think I am ruining my life but the thing is I want to get away and I dont want to be told what to do by my parents anymore. I want to be free and if that means leaving then I will do it. I know that is it a long way but everyone is moving on and doing there own thing so why cant I. I believe that you have to do what is right for you and only you. I love how some people can blame a whole situation on just one person without mentioning their name. I think it is stupid and if you have something to say to a a person then you should just say it and not go behind their back and talk about them to others. This week had its ups and its downs I just want to forget everyhting and just go back to being my quiet slef again. That is really all there is for now it is a little disorganized but my thoughts are never organized they just come into my head and I wirte it down as I go along"

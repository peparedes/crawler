But by this time Monday I should have a car.......oh it is too sweet...

Judy told me that her and George had been talking about transportation for me come the winter months,....Well if I do get this job as full-time they will be more then willing to Co-sign for a car for me....I was so stoked!  And, if anyone knows me I don't need anything fancy.....we already have a fancy car.  All I would need is something reliable, with heat and a radio.  Oh and doors that lock and windows that roll up and down.  Not real picky.  Besides that I have to be able to afford the insurance, and payments.  They're just helping a gurl get a dependable ride.  I love those guys they are so great! I am glad I could be part of such a great family, unlike my own sometimes.  Anyhow, my book is calling."

"event","Well, It is a bit of a mellow night out at the call center tonight.  I am a little bored, and not many folks to talk to....Life is good, Relationship is better then ever.  Finances should be coming along soon.  All I need is my own car.  Not that I am not ok sharing a car with nick, he has been really understanding, but it will only last a little while before everyone starts getting frustrated.  I don't have alot of money so I think cheap, and am looking for just somthing to get me to and from places, but nick, well he won't allow it....I think that he just worries about me breaking down somewhere and me becoming a part of the evening news, which I understand but......I am only trying to be realistic, besides working at AAA I get 75% discount on membership dues.  Besides most of my free time is spent with him, so....I don't know that is all that frustrates me really.  OOOOO, we got a few new fish 1 itty bitty angel the size of a dime, and 2 fan tailed pretties.  So ok well I can't write for an hour that would bored the shit out of everyone.  

TIP: if you guys are on the road, pay attention to all exits and mile posts, it helps your tow truck or your AAA or roadside assistance operator know where you at because typically they are not to familiar where you are located or about the area to begin with.  trust me I make a living at it LOL :D~"

The everything is good in my life is great, so my only explaination is I am unhappy with myself.  And, I don't want to be rude but please don't give me any shit that everything can't be alright and me be unhappy with myself.  Because I am.  My love life has been great since the last big blow out we had in late May early June.  We have celebrated 3 years together.  We have had healthy arguements but they never last longer then 2 or 3 waking hours.  I have been able to spend a little bit of time with friends, more then I used to.  Things with my family are doing pretty good.  I love my kitty.  
The only down fall currently I am not working, and have to much time on my hands, not much to do.  
Solutions?  
And before I get the get off your ass and do something about it........
I spend 6 to 7 hours 3 to 4 buisness days a week looking for a job.  Applying. Calling.  But I haven't got a call or reply.  Currently I am ""employed"" through a temp agency but at this time they have not called me for a contract.

Friday when I went in to pick up my pay check after not working for solid week I was told I was no longer needed.
How nice.  Just before walking up to get my check I found out that my major had not been cancelled but no one shared that with me.  That's besides the point.....I was estatic...I get to go back to school and finish my degree!  And, then I lose my job.  I immediatly started making the arrangements.  And then BANG!!
Well and then I started to stress out because I have a few large bills.  That TA DA with out a job I have no way of paying them.  OOOO also before I lost my job...on Friday morning I had received a job interview.  See I had a feeling I was going to lose my job so I started looking for a new job, and a few good things fell into my lap.

And then today I was supa stressed out over my old school tuition bill, that I owe to the Revenue Office and tell them I lost my job and won't beable to make my monthly payment  until i eaither get a job or get unemployment.  I spoke with Craig, what a weet man....he was a big help and lifted about 2 tons of stress off my shoulders....now for my cell phone.

That's ok.  I am going to be ok, I am going to try not to stress too much.  Nick, I love you.  You have been so supportive."

I think that I may have lost my mother for good.  As much as that hurts, I don't know if it's really a bad thing.  She has held me back from doing some of the things I needed to grow.  And,  then it hurts me terribly, she is my mothe and I love her dearly. I can't have her control my life for ever, and that has been what she has been doing and I don't even live with her anymore.  It is not her choice who I can love.
I made that choice.  She does not like it.  Oh well I don't like the man she chose but I deal with because I love her.

Enough about my mother.

There is a lot that I want right now, but there are some steps I need to do to aquire them, that won't be all that easy.  I have to decide what I want more and what is priority.

I need to take time out when I feel like I can't take what all I have put on my plate.  I need to communicate to those who are in my life.

I need to make a plan and stick to it as best I can.

I need to be me."

I went to look at a few apartments at wimbleton Square, and well I fell in love.
They have great staff, Kelly they are super nicee, they have alot to offer, and well it would be a place to go I would never run out of someplace to be alone.  But right now it's not affordable.

It's nice,  I think Nick wants to move out to.....but he'd like to be prepared.  I just want a place I can call mine.  Or ours.

On a sour note....my mother can't handle being an adult.  She is back at Nick hating again, onl;y this time
she is jeoperdizing Nick's job.  OK so I have no mother,  (she has disowned me yet again)

It makes me sad.  I love Nick, to be honest I want to marry him and have a life with him.  And if I do marry him and have children with this man, they will have to respect him and that that is my choice to make.  I am marrying him, not them, and the same or him, he is marrying me not them.  If they can not respect my husband, and the father of my children, there is no reason that they should be there for those wonderful moments I may have in my life until they understand that is my choice to make, not theirs and that I am not going to have them disrespecting him.  

Now I know it seems really harsh, it is.  But so is the way tey are acting.  They are making me chose between him and them.  I am not doing it, I am however taking his side.  they are in the wrong.  back off keep your personal feeling away from work..Tahy have no president here and no realavence.  i.e. GROW UP you are 44 years old act it.

Now for those of that maybe confused, there is no descison that Nick and I are going to get married, true it's a nice thought, but it was just for the sake of the arguement, to express how I thought about the situation and if it kept up.

Well LJ land thanks for hearing me out."

And, it seems his allergies are recking havoc for him, so he has laid down to nap.
And that is were I have left him, in hopes of the Nick that loves me will emerge for a bit today.

"event","The best news of the year
'Family Guy' un-canceled, thanks to DVD sales success
By Gary Levin, USA TODAY
Stewie lives!

Watch out, Stewie Griffin's got a new outfit and a lot of new stuff to say, most of which can't be printed here. 

Family Guy, the outrageous Fox cartoon that was canceled two years ago, will resume production next month with 35 new episodes to premiere early next year on Cartoon Network and possibly on Fox.

It marks the first time a canceled show has been resurrected based on DVD sales. The first volume, which sold 1.6 million, was last year's top-selling TV DVD; a second volume sold another million copies. And those 50 reruns are the biggest draw on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim block of late-night programming, with 1.9 million viewers. 

Happy hey guys happy news...........


All this for a show about a blue-collar Rhode Island family, including loutish dad Peter, evil toddler Stewie and a talking, martini-swilling dog.

The comeback surprises Seth MacFarlane, who created Family Guy at 24, won a huge post-Super Bowl launch on Fox in 1999 and then watched the show founder in several time slots.

""We kind of gave up lobbying a while ago,"" MacFarlane says. ""For the most part, when a show is dead, it's dead. It's something none of us ever expected."" 

But in Family Guy's late-blooming success, 20th Century Fox Television sees a chance to profit further from DVDs, merchandise, a potential video game and the ultimate pot of gold: syndication to local TV stations, which usually requires at least 85 episodes.

""When we saw the way the fan base reacted, it obviously got us thinking there was a very pure audience that would follow it anywhere,"" says 20th Century Fox's Gary Newman. 

The news is equally heartening to Cartoon Network. ""Getting this deal done has been my obsession for the last six months,"" general manager Jim Samples says. ""It will be one of the things that keeps Adult Swim thriving.""

If Fox airs the new episodes, it will get them before Cartoon Network"

I am also coming to this retarded point in my life...I am ready to have my own apartment soo bad.

BUT...I don't want to live alone.
Stupid Huh?!
That and I don;t quite make enough where I am working right now.  But, the people I work with are great and I love the job.  

Who fucking knows.  
I just wish I could sleep."

It's been a whie sincec I have updated.
I have a kitty...her name is Drusilla.
Judy and I adopted her.  
She was the one we were trying to find the home for.
Her owner was going to come get her last Saturday,
and take her to the pound to be put to sleep.
Why kill a kitty just cause we couldn't find a home in 3 wks.
Judy wouldn't have it.
She is such a character.
I have to get her fixed, maybe after that Missy and Gracie will larn to get along with her.

I keep my paint brush with me
Wherever I may go,
In case I need to cover up
So the real me doesn't show.
I'm so afraid to show you me,
Afraid of what you'll do -- that
You might laugh or say mean things.
I'm afraid I might lose you.

I'd like to remove all my paint coats
To show you the real, true me,
But I want you to try to understand,
I need you to accept what you see.
So if you'll be patient and close your eyes,
I'll strip off all my coats real slow.
Please understand how much it hurts
To let the real me show.

Now my coats are all stripped off.
I feel naked, bare, and cold,
And if you still love me with all that you see,
You are my true friend, pure as gold.
I need to save my paint-brush, though,
And hold it in my hand,
I want to keep it handy
In case somebody doesn't understand,
So please protect me, my dear friend
And thanks for loving me true,
But please let me keep my paint-brush with me
Until I love me, too.

I feel like this still.  Sometimes.  
I feel like I keep things bottled up,
So that I don't hurt or upset anyone.
Sometimes it drives me nuts.

This isn't directed at anyone.  Or anything at this time.
It's just how I feel sometimes.  Tonight I was alone for a bit,
attempting to put some memories into a book.  A book that I have 
been trying to work on for years.  
It also had me thinking of all my mistakes and all my hard times, 
and those I had to call on....(tv got me started on that) some of
it made me feel good and somethings made me want to cry.  
I then started thinking about who I am, and where I am right now.
Where do I want to be tomarrow?  Who do I want to be?  How do I get there?
Who comes with me?  And who will I lose along the way?

I had so many friends 5 yrs ago....where did they all go? Why did they all go?
I used to be so sure of myself and my future.  Now I feel like I am at a stand still.
Like I don't know where to go from here.  I know what I want, but how can I get there.

I am 22yrs old and all I have to really show for it, is a high school diploma, 
and some college credits that won't get me too far at this point.
I am feeling a bit unhappy about myself.
And I don't know what brought it on...maybe it was all those damn photos and memories that followed.

I need a hug."

On a much happier relaxed note...Nick took me to this cute little coffee shop today.  Its a scottish coffee shop, I adore it! 
When we were ordering our beverages of choice (Nick- a cock n bull soda, Me-a cup of tea)the guy asked me if I wanted ""a big cup or a wee cup?"" I tried real hard to stiffle my giggles.  It made me day.
Silly this I know but ""f@*$ you if you can't take a joke."" :D

ok so I might have had a bit too much suga in my tea.
Today my cup is half full.
Quote of the day: Let there  be two.

""Laugh at your friends, and if your friends are sore; So much the better, you may laugh the more."" -- Giovanni G. Casanova

""Laughter is not a bad beginning for a friendship, and it is the best ending for one."" -- Christian Morgenstern

This last quote is for all those out there that have been betrayed by someone you loved, trusted, even called your friend.  Just rememeber betrayl is in the eyes of the betrayed.  What someone else feels is betrayal others may not, that is your choice.
For the rest of you take the quotes as you will."

Not so bad, it is some manual labor though....and the one thing I hate...is that I have to do anal probbing....it's more like putting pressure on the anal gland and then squeezing the gland...it doesn't hurt them but it makes my stomach churn.
  Nick gave me a wonderful birthday gift.....last night we went shoppign for dinner goodies and he made me three cheese tortilli with alfredo sauce, we got 2 pints of ice cream.  Strwberry cheesecake and daqarui ice, we then rented Desperado and Once upon a time in Mexico.  Which I did not see the end too.  And then today him and his mom went to Baskin and robbins to get me a grumpy carebear ice cream cake, but it would've took 2 days so he improvised it had a rainbow with grumpy bear blue background with mint chocolate chip ice cream and white cake.  
However,  the bad news on my birthday

  I tried to call my real dad on his birthday which was January 25th, but have since not received a call back..now he was suppose to get me a laptop for my birthday....and has not called me at all he said he was taking my birthday off but that was on Christmas eve, also the last time I talked to him.  My dad has this history of letting everyone down.  I was going to take a chance though, I really didn't expect to see or hear from him in the back of my heart..and by no means did I expect a laptop I would've really like to see him though.  I have lots of wonderful people that love me and tons of pent up felling towards my dad but I am trying.  He is half the reason I am here today...I can't just give up on him even though my mind is telling me to get real...my heart is telling me he is my father and I can't give up on him...not yet anyway.  I love you dad.

Other then that this birthday wasn't all that bad...no tears no anger, and no hard feelings anywhere.  Maybe I can start looking forward to my birthdays again."

I guess sometime last night Jason called my cell phone, (my # he got from my step-dad)  while I was out with the girls.  Nick had my cell phone so that I could get hold of him to come get me when the night was through.  All Nick told me was that ""A guyy by the name of Jason Graham called and said that he would see you at ""your"" party tommorrow.""  And hasn't talked to me since...this is hour 48.
  I went to my little sister's party today.  We went to Bullwinkles for a few hours then we came back to the community center because my little sister and her drill team had to preform for a retirement party....well who should be there besides my juvanile step-father but Jackass Jason.  The first thing he says was ""How's you and your boyfriend?""  Next then he knows he is getting up off the floor with a bloody lip trying to pry my hands of his throat...as my old coach from middle shool pulls me off him....I end up feeling like a Jackass myself because 1) I shouldn't have lowered myself to their level. 2) It was my little sisters birthday party. and 3) When I get home my boyfriend is still gonna think I am a bitch and be pissed at me.
   I went to bed tonight  with yet another pillow between Nick and myself.  I had to get out of bed because that was Juvenile and made me feel like shit.  Do you even know how it made me feel that when our feet touched he recoiled as if I were going to give him some deadly disease.  So yet for night number two I will be crying myself to sleep and wake up every hour woundering if he is going to tell me yet agaian to pack my shit and get the fuck out of his life.
    You know i am seriously ready to be done with this childish shit...how can I improve on things or change things if I am not told what is wrong?  I have said this before I am not a mind reader.

  I would really for once like to know that my relationship isn't gonna end on a drop of a dime.  All but one of my friends all have these perfect little wonderful relationships were they have eaither been together forever or are engaged almost 65% of my friends are married and I am sitting here wondering if my boyfriend is going to kick me out again.  There is something terribly wrong there.  All I really want is security.  I don't want to doubt if he gives a shit anymore.  I don't want to doubt that he's not just keeping around because he feels sorry for me or that he feels obligated."

"event","Well I finally went out with the girl last night.  We went to Harvey's Comedy Club...it was great.  I miss getting out with Michelle and Melissa.  They had a great comedy lineup Carl Labove was there.  He is funnier then ....well he is funny.  Then I come home to a not so great angry boyfriend....I'm not sure what the deal was I just know he hasn't talked to me since he picked me up at Midnight 45.  What makes matters worse is he put a pillow between us in bed.  SO now I get to goto my little sisters birthday and be there with most people I can careless about except my little sister she is the only one who isn't trying to fuck up my relationship with Nick.  Then I get to come back to a not talking to me boyfriend.  can't wait.  O and yippie I am 22 in four days.

"event","Hello LJ Land.....
How I have missed you, I haven't been able to let go of this burden onto your shoulders in quite sometime.....that time is now.....Wow I can be cheesy...
So what have I been up to?
Looking for a job in this shitty excuse for an economy...still nothing.  At this point I am getting desperate. You know what they say desperate people take desperrate messures.  It has me in this huge depressed funk...it's getting harder to pull myself out of on a daily basis.  

There is one thing I am extremly exceited about..my best friend....my very first friend...is going to be having a beautiful baby girl sometime soon.  The original due date was Febuary 5th 2004 obviously.  but last Monday the 12 Selina went in for her check up and they said that it could be anywhere from then until the 5th it is going to be completly up to Elizabeth (the baby) she weighs 7lbs 2oz.  So I am waiting for the call.  Nick promises to take me up there regardless of the time.

Oh and I officially live back here at the Wolchesky's.  Yep Nick and I share a car, a bed, a room, a dresser, and a closet.  Yeah.

Well that's it for my dull depressing life.  Talk to yous guys later.

Hi Demaris....hope you've been well.

Dee do what you gotta do to get down here.  Besides Judy, myself, the dog and the cat there are no other girls...i feel as I might grow a one eyed snake without another girl around....ok so I am over dramatic  but no seriously  come on down."

"event","Today was a beautiful serene day.  Didn't do much.  Spent most of the day in bed watching my best friends enormous collection of DVDs while nature painted the beautiful scene outside.  Then I took a strool and sometime to think.  It was a lonely walk.  Cold too.  
I hope everyone stayed safe and warm.  

Not much to say....I guess I still have alot more thinking to go though before I have that one awsome entry that eaither makes me cry or makes everyone think I am a genious....Clue: I am not.

Ok it's time to go running, someone got the thought in my head and now that I have nothing to do and no one to really talk to I must occupy my time somehow.

B,
Thanks again for the ride.  I am sorry I asked I did not mean to cause anyone any ale over it.  I hope things turn around for you.  Be well.

N.Good luck I hope you get the job and all htat makes you happy.  Take care of your family."

"event","I am trying to say I am sorry for what was said.....I don't expect it to make anything better.  But I don't want us to hate one another eaither.  I didd not mean what I said, I said it out of anger.  But you have NO right saying the things you did.  
I just want to tell you it shows how you feel about me everytime we have a fight you accuse me of cheating, for the record I have slept with 4 people my whole life.  You being the last.

I am sorry.  I am not going to grovel, I am not going to beg.  I am done doing that.  This relationship withstood alot but it came to an end last night.  That I regret.

Good luck."

"event","How can you move on from the pain?
How do you start all over after your whole world revolved around that one person?  How are you suppose to feel to know that that one person's life does not revolve around you?
I need to stop the hurting.

I think about all those good times and I cry, because I know I will never have those again, (I guess it serves me right.)  And then those bad times start seeping through.  It's hard to hold back those mean things you never mean to say when you're upset, they just come out.  You don't think until you have reflected on things.  That is when your lover starts to doubt you.  Once those horrible things are spoken it's hard to beleive that you can ever trust what they are telling you, or that you can depend on them again.  And it's justfully so, because the words that are spoken are often those secret fears you share or those secrets only they know.  How can you possibly trust them after they went and throw that in your face.  If you love them you're just suppose to rid your mind of those stupid fears.  
  It's not easy.  I have tried. I failed.
If you read this, I am sorry for what it is worth.  We were a perfect pair and I screwed it up because I could get over those silly insecurities.  I hope you find what you're looking for down the road, and I hope you're happy.  You deserved more then I could give you I tried though.  Please beleive that,  You will always be with me, even if you're far away."

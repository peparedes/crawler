but besides that things are really really good! lovenotes is going swell and i just found out that im in twelve angry women! YAAAAAY! im very excited. my class scheduale is ok but it keeps me busy.  work is wonderful.......but unfortunatly i will not be able work much with the shows. ahhhh im so busy ahhhhh.......

this weekend was WONDERFUL! i loved being home. so much in fact that i waited till the very last minute to come back to school. the very last minute. i cant wait to see everyone again.


grr....so 'the lesson' rehearsals are getting in the way of everthing. they interfere with two auditions that i want to go to and work. not to mention if kyle and justin end up playing a show at off center i might not be able to go. if its the 8th, maybe, but if its the 15th then definetly not because i have a show :(


regardless today was a happy day.


we watched a GREAT movie in writing class today. its called Maze and laura linney is wonderful in it. check it out!

ok so i went to Grease reahearsal last night! it was wonderful seeing everyone. i do miss Cranston West theatre....its just not as much fun at RIC. ow well. the show seems to be coming along well and everyone is haveing fun. Cranston West is always so impressive. we never fail to put on a good show. i think im going to the saturday night performance so yeah all Cranston West alumni go then! lol

my family and i picked for our secret santa last night. i got my mom, which is quite convenient because she wanted me to get her. she wants lots and lots of Starbucks merchandise....i will do that for her. i tried the eggnog latte today and it is quite good. everyone should try it.

the holidays are looking grim considering i have no one special to spend them with. i always say i dont have time for a boyfriend but i really want someone to take me ice skating. is that odd? alicia dipetro said she'll take me and we can hold hands.....i suppose that works.


i started dreading shann's hair yesterday.....it looks AWESOME but it takes FOREVER. i think were going to continue tonight.....yaaaaaaaay dreadlocks!


you know what sucks? my internet....thats what sucks. i tried using wireless at home and it just wouldn't work...i think it hates me. yup, thats it. the internet is indeed plotting against me.

so i went to the barrington musical last night! got to see my long time lover fitz in all her glory. it was quite adorable lol. this was, however, the first barrington musical that ive been to see without jared :( something was certainly missing, but adi and shann were good substitutes. 


tonight i want to go see the tempest. me and adi were going to get tickets this morning but we slept in instead....OOPS! i just hope they are not sold out....... that would be quite awful.

im pretty sure the most perfect boy ever walked into starbucks the other day. he was what one would call ""kristina pretty"", with his 6'2"", 130 ld beauty complete with long hair, crooked nose and interesting clothing. i wanted to talk to him....make some sort of small talk like i do with the rest of the customers....but i couldn't. i just froze. when am i ever unable to speak to people? i just dont get it. i hope he comes back eventually :(


sometime, i hate how theatre works. how can someone really say to you ""sometimes, the look outdoes the talent."" how is that supposed to make me feel.....better about the situation? i lost a part because someone looked more the norm than me. i feel like its always between me and one other person, and they get the part for some silly reason. whatever. i still have A role so i suppose im content. how many college freshman can say that, ay?


my drawing teacher makes me feel so special....like i cant ever do anything wrong. i like him....he thinks im a good artist. and i've already built the reputation as a good actress here. huh, maybe ric isnt so bad after all.

i feel very one-demensional sometimes...very ""what you see is what you get"". i dont know if this is a negative thing. i suppose i can try to not be so ""black and white"", but i dont want to change who i am to be someone im not. the fact that i act one-dimensional means that i am indeed one-dimensional. that, to me, is awfully disheartening. some people are able to surprise me over and over again and i dont do that. i know its not because i wear my heart on my sleeve because, lets face it, i dont. so how come i don't have the capacity to surprise people with what i say or what i think?

annie and i decided to not go to the movie shoot tonight. we both werent feeling very up to it considering annie, therese and i pulled an all nighter last night and then spent the day in westerly. it was charming, but i really thought i was not going to be able to stay up again.......and here i am lol. its so weird....im always wicked tired. but not the past couple of nights. my sleeping habbits need a serious readjustment.

fitzy's going away party was quite fun. i will miss her very much :(

hm i wish i had more to say because i really dont want to go to bed. i may just ramble....ok...here i go. i still need a job :/ i havent been looking very hard but i am actually going to start. i dont want a shitty job though. i was always hated saying i worked at bk. i feel like i sleep every day away and i def want to stop doing that. annie is usually a pretty reliable human alarm clock...but if she doesnt call im usually not up till like one in the afternoon. and then i stay out all night and just do everything over again. rayna is pretty good about waking me up too lol. i called her twice today to vent because alicia and jenn were having problems of their own. she didnt pick up though which wicked bumbed me out. but shes with her bf so its understandable. wow ok im gonna stop....i dont even know how i got to writing about this. im gonna come back and read this tomorrow and marvel at what a fool i am.

im pretty sure i have just grown to resent valentines day. it just so happens that ive never had a boyfriend on this holiday. there has been only one year that i have actually had a sort of 'special someone'to spend the night with. of course, that night ended ridiculously poorly. why would i ever want to relive that?

whatever....i plan to call dana and go for coffee and forget that this day has any kind of special meaning. i dont know why, but thinking about my situation nearly brings me to tears. its probably because im over sensitive and emo. i cant help but think that valentines isnt as big of a deal to everyone else. im just a weirdo.

mary and i filmed our health video yesterday with courtney and matts help. it is sooo cute... i just hope we can edit it competently. but should not worry because i have faith in matty's technical skills :D. hopefully its a hit because sometimes i wonder if other people have the same humor as us. we shall see i guess...

this past week has been crazy. between ordering college apps, trying to catch up on homework, and designing the fiddler set, going to my great-grandma's wake, and spending time with my aunt and uncle from cali i am wicked burnt out. im assuming next week is going to be a whole lot calmer...but i kind of like the rush of being busy...i dont have to think about stupid things and stupid people:)

so last night i went to the haunted cornmaze down at confreida farms...and let me just say i wasnt even shaken by the the experience. i was wicked looking foward to being scared out of my mind because i find that kind of stuff super fun but it ended up a disapointment. first off....it was superrrrr busy but, i have to say, the line for the maze moved pretty fast. when we went on the haunted hayride i cant even say i became jumpy. i mean....matt whitman jumping out from behind his house and running toward me scared me more than the actors did. at one point...these corpse like individuals jumped onto the hayride and got all in our faces. one of them like picked on me and my only reaction to him was a smile and a wink cuz he was pretty cute. when we actually got to the maze...it was way too light to really get the 'oh no im lost in a maze' vibe. so while we walked through it people would like randomly jump out at us and somtimes i jumped but they just werent scary!!!! in fact...i started chatting it up with a warewolf and helped him scare this random family. i also made friends with the crazy pirate man and took a pic with some chainsaw dude. i guess breaking character isnt a very big deal for them. oh my! what would ms. vitulli say?? anyway i wanted to check out 'field of screams' but i dont think im gonna get the chance. oh well :shrugs:

i went to salem with sarah a couple of days ago and it was quite the experience. our trip started with sara and i nearly missing our train and being terrified that we were goig to miss our stop...which is silly cuz south station was the last stop on the trains route. once we got to the station we met rayna and journeyed to get on the bus. btw...buses are quite complicated...who knew they all had a different number. lol. her dorm was surprisingly roomy and her roomate, leah was adorable. we met a bunch of cool people from the honors program...but my favorite was jeremy, who wasnt really from the honors program but the cutest techie everrrr...right on ray ::wink:: we watched a really good movie, murder by numbers in this huge four person dorm, and then went back to ray's to watch 10 things i hate about you...i dont really know why the call it that but its still an amazing movie. i slept in leahs bed which was kind of awkward cuz i know i wouldnt want some strange person sleeping in my bed. my favorite thing about rays dorm had to be this digital clock that projected onto the ceiling...it was leah's and the most convenient thing everrrrr. we woke up at like 11 on tuesday, got some takeout, and watched harry potter. the power went out which was kind of humerous considering leah got stuck on the elevator lol. sarah and i were leaving at like 2:30 cuz ray had class but before we did we met the peabody crew who were from the other dorm. i absolutly loved them, especially kiernon and mike. sarah and i got on the right bus all by ourselves where sara got hit on by the little spanish boy named jose. we moved on to get on the train that brought us here...2 hours away from rayray :( 

now that i read this our trip kinda sounds like a drag but it was really quite fun. i cant wait to go up for holloween. woot!"

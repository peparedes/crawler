"event","i want people to know what i'm thinking. i want people to know the secret world that's inside my head, especially lately. i don't have the energy to tell person after person that i'm ok so i'll just let select people see what really goes on inside (but of course some entries will remain private). anyways if you want to add me you can go ahead and i might add you back. if you're a friend of mine and you want to read my journal you'll need a livejournal code so let me know and i can give you one.

"event","to make this journal private. this will no longer be friends only but instead a journal meant just for me. these secrets are too precious to have anyone know them, even though it would be people i don't know. you can still add me as a friend but most likely, i might not add you back. 
that is all for now.
i think i might post tonight but we'll see."

"event","so i listened to my ipod tonight.
havent done that in awhile.
and i put it on shuffle songs.
cuz i didnt know what i wanted to listen to.
so it's all playing and i swear to god.
song after song.
each song reminded me of someone i love or have loved in the past o rmeant something to me.
it was so depressing.
it made me cry.
one reminded me of my old best friend.
my best friend now.
my ex.
my other ex.
another person who was in my life who was only in it briefly but whom had an impact and meant something to me.
i think i need to stop loving music so much.
cuz i end up connecting a song to people in my life.
and then depressing me or sometimes making me happy to hear certain songs..
its like&nbsp; either the song was playing in the background of memorable moment in my life
or they are just songs that someone i liked liked so they remind me of them
or they are songs that were ""our"" song type deal
or it was a band i used to listen to alot at one certain time in my life.
and its just like ugh!
should i give up music i wonder...?
haha.
naaah. i love it too much.
well that was a lovely look into how my weird mind works...
i'm done."

"event","<font size=""1"">so i've been doing alot of thinking lately, but its a good thing, good thinking. -i've been having a lot of internal conflicts...i mean like i think i'm ready to get over him and move on-but then on the other hand the other half of me wanted to hold on for dear life! but he's my best friend and i love him with allll my heart so being his best friend..the best thing to do is realize the good in all the situations. And i think i'm finally able to do that. i can finally be happy for him. i mean come on, look at him-he is finally soo happy with someone who treats him right. he's got a job, he's doing the school thing. he's just in a really good place in his life right now. and i can say that i am just soo happy for him! really i am! and quite proud of how successful he's been with school and stuff. i wish i could say the same for myself.. i only ever want the best for him..<br /><br />i love him with <u>ALL my heart!</u> he holds a wicked special place in my heart! and when someone is that special to you why wouldn't you want the best for them right?<br /><br />but here's where the internal conflict comes in...theres still that nagging part of me that says stop! dont! you cant be happy for him! get him back! get him back! <strong>i still want to be with him sooo badly!</strong> i am still <strong>sooo in love</strong> with him! he was the <strong>best partner i've ever had</strong> and now i've lost him.&nbsp; :-(&nbsp;&nbsp; i wasnt ready to lose him. nevermind the fact that i really need to show him how much i love him and care for him!&nbsp;&nbsp; -i mean i never treated him very well in the past for one thing. and if i could be with him again i would treat him like my king-cuz thats what he is to me-my king...<strong>my romeo!</strong><br /><br />but it seems all in vain to pine over him when he's at a very good place in his life right now right? i mean jeesh why would anyone give up comfort-a good thing-to take a risk on something that was bad in the past that you're not sure what will happen this time? you know? so in my thinking process i've come to realize that the best thing for everyone is that i just be happy for him and let that be that. cuz <u>I AM</u> happy for him. i am. i'm actually happy that he is happy! i'm sooo glad to see him happy cuz he's had a lot of hard times in his life before and now seems to be his time. so i dont wanna fuck with that ya know? by being all love me date me blah blah i'm annoying type deal...<br /><br />another thing is he doesnt want me back unless i get ""help"". well that whole ""help"" thing prolly wont happen for a very long time and the process alone takes looong too-and he's already happy with someone. so again, i think theres no point if he's not going to even consider me ya know/. i'll just be making myself more crazy for no reason. so why not just start trying to move on? it'd make everyone happy....<br /><br />i just wish i didnt have the internal conflicts going on between let him go and dont let him go...but i guess thats how moving on starts huh? i mean i guess its like they say...[or so i hope it is] if you love something set it free, if it returns back to you it was meant to be/or it is yours or whatever...and if it doesnt then its not yours or whatever...so i guess i just gotta do that even tho it hurts a lot to do so...but i love him! and i just want the best for him...but so yeah i think i'm ready for this...<br /><br />i think now whats best is for me to work on being as good a best friend for him as i possibly can...and i'm gonna have to try really hard seeing as how we live so far apart...there's not too much i can do but i'm gonna try my damndest!...it will prolly be a very long time till we see each other again&nbsp; :-(&nbsp;&nbsp; so i have awhile to get myself better and in check and what not...then maybe we can all live happily ever after-the way the path of life has planned for us...whatever that may be-who knows....we'll see tho....</font>"

<br />
<p><font face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">-yeah wicked embarrassing!</font></p>
<br />
<p><font face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">-....i felt it coming and i just couldnt stop it!</font></p>
<br />
<p><font face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">-i was like holy shit!</font></p>
<br />
<p><font face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">-it was scary and i didnt like it.</font></p>
<br />
<p><font face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">-but damn it-i had had enough by that point!</font></p>
<br />
<p><font face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">-i got up at 4:30am this morning to go into work with my mom-help her out with some shit there then she had a lot of houses she needed to clean and wanted to get a head start on them-so i said ok we'll get what we need to get done then she could go leave and clean some houses before lunch time when she would come back.</font></p>
<br />
<p><font face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">-yeah so i did that huge favor for her-i dont like working mornings-i barely had any sleep the night before. and mornings at work are just like crazy ass busy!-and i dont like it very much. well anyways, long story short, i dont know what it was, but i dunno if everyone was cranky today or what, but god damn it were they mean to me-even my regular customers!</font></p>
<br />
<p><font face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">-then denise, my boss comes in and bitches me out and treats me like shit.</font></p>
<br />
<p><font face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">-and by then i just had it!</font></p>
<br />
<p><font face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">-and this is where my rant begins....</font></p>
<br />
<p><font face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">-i am soooo sick of this shit!</font></p>
<br />
<p><font face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">-i am sooo sick of everyone treating my like some kind of incompetent child!-i'm fuckin 21years old!-and i've been workin at that fuckin place for 3 years now!-i think i know how to do my job by now!-and i really dislike it when people speak to me like im some kind of stupid child and they just dont respect me what-so-ever!</font></p>
<br />
<p><font face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">-god the fuckin dissess i was getting today went waaay beyond pickin on me, or teasing me er whatever!-god damn it i wanted to punch someone in the face!</font></p>
<br />
<p><font face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">-then i am like soooo sick of this stupid ""no"" shit!....all i have been hearing from everyone is ""no you cant do this"" or ""no you cant do that"" or ""no way"" or ""yeah right kelly!""</font></p>
<br />
<p><font face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">-no one has any fuckin confidence in me what-so-ever!</font></p>
<br />
<p><font face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">-i'm totally not trusted or respected by anyone-even my parents!-granted i do let them walk all over me at times-and i really should let them-or let them use me or wahtever....</font></p>
<br />
<p><font face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">-i dunno, i am just sick of it all!</font></p>
<br />
<p><font face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">-i have really had enough!-its just getting rediculous!</font></p>
<br />
<p><font face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">-i think i should just give up or stop tryin...</font></p>
<br />
<p><font face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">-i mean if no one has any confidence in me and what not-then like, whats the point!?!</font></p>
<br />
<p><font face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">-i say fuck it!</font></p>
<br />
<p><font face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">-i should just give up and screw the whole trying so hard thing--tryin soo hard to impress people, or to do my best, or to succeed.</font></p>
<br />
<p><font face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">-if no one is going to have any faith in me why am i bothering!?!?-i should just give up....</font></p>
<br />
<p><font face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">-With all this ""no"" shit and no confidence in me stuff, how is all that suupossed to help me succeed!??!-you would think people would want to see me succeed-ya know like my parents-but in order for me to do so people gotta start letting me do stuff and stop tellin me NO!-and they need to start trusting me and start having some faith in me!</font></p>
<br />
<p><font face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">-god what i would give for epople to start trusting me-have some confidence in me and say yes-and let me do certain important things i need and want to get done that are going to help me succeed!</font></p>
<br />
<p><font face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">-i am also soo sick of all this ""up in the air"" crap!-i wish someone would just give me some freakin answers!-or i wish things would be all set.-ever since like god, i dunno a couple months ago things were always up in the air-then they seemed to start fallin into place and life was good-and then boom!-i get smacked in the face with another fuckin challenge and i gotta figure every fuckin lil thing out again!-why do i always get myself into such shitty situations!?!?</font></p>
<br />
<p><font face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">-god i suck!</font></p>
<br />
<p><font face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">-but damn it, i just wish people would stop questioning me and have faith in me. i swear my parents have no confidence in me or even trust me!-i dont know how else i can explain to them how important it is for me to go to maine someday soon to check out apartments-they cant afford to take time off work to bring me so why the fuck cant they trust me to go by myself!?!?-please god why cant they trust me!-they never ever do!-what have i ever done in the past that has made them not trust me!?!?-if anything i have ALWAYS been the most trusted kid and always the goodie-2-shoes-makes me sick to admit that but damn it0why now are they not trusting me when they used to all the time!-i dont get it!</font></p>
<br />
<p><font face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">-i NEED and want to go to maine sooo bad next week. besides the concert and wanting to see morgaine and carla and paula, i want to check out some apartments-which is a very important thing right there-i NEED a place to stay its vital and i cant stress that enough to my parents!</font></p>
<br />
<p><font face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">-i think they just may be in denial about the whole thing-about how i'm becoming more independent and not needing them so much anymore-i mean i am the last kid to leave the nest-and i think with this whole apartment thing its affirming them that i might just be leaving the nest for almost good kind of thing.</font></p>
<br />
<p><font face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">-well i dont know what their problem is but i just wish they would have some confidence in me and trust me and let me go. plus this is what i need to do to succeed. if i get an apartment its one less thing to worry about school wise. i need that. i need to worry less about school cuz its a huuuuge concern!-GOD WHAT I WOULD GIVE TO HAVE PARENTS WHO WERE A LITTLE WELL OFF!!!-or some kind of colelge fund!-its not fair that everyone else i know has parents who make money and shit or have some kind of college fund for their kids. but i guess im just not that lucky and need to deal with what i have. and ya know what, i have been dealing...</font></p>
<br />
<p><font face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">-ya know, i may complain about this alot-but damn it-if you were me and knew how it was you would get why i complain so much-people just dont understand that i'm doing this whole school thing ON MY OWN!-i fill out my own paper work i take care of my school expenses and shit-my parents have not seen one school bill or any concerns with loans-i take care of it all-i fill out the fasfa and shit-they know nothing-they do nothing-i do it all!-i have to figure all this shit out on my own cuz they dont know how to do any of it-nor do they need to worry about it right now when they are in extreme financial hardship themselves....</font></p>
<br />
<p><font face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">-alright well i really have totally just lost my train of thought and where i was going with this-i guess thats why they call it a rant-cuz you just scream and yell and complain until you feel better-not that i feel better-but i dunno-it was nice to get some of it out of my head i suppose....</font></p>
<br />
<p><font face=""Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"" size=""2"">-i just really want somethin to go right for me....and i just wish i hadnt gotten myself into a situation to have my heart broken a month ago-but thats me-always getting into stupid shitty situations.....but i guess i shouldnt complain because i met the most wonderful and amazing person and fell in love with her and got to spend time with her and i wouldnt give that time up for anything! so yeah.....i will always and forever love her.....and i think i will always and forever be stuck getting myself into shitty situations so i guess i should stop ranting about them now.............</font></p>"

<p><font size=""2"">today has been one fucked up day.</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">i think everyone i came encounter with was just fuckin crazy in some way.</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">all the customers at work today were just either extremely rude, mean, crazy, drunk, stupid, or just a freakin combination of all the above!</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">it was a horibbly long day!</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">but anyways, i finally got out of work and me and mom headed to t-town cuz she wanted to get her nails done and then we felt like hitting up salvation army and goodwill</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">oh yeah baby!-i'm all about the bargains and used t-shirts!</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">so anyways-her nail place was busy-thank god!-i didnt feel like sitting there breathing in the fumes for like ever-so we headed over to salvation army but it was closed!-stupid place closing so early!</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-so we headed over to goodwill but stopped over at BJ's to get a few things first. i love that place. only cuz all the big bulk items amaze me!-its like you can get a super gigantic box of goldfish or cookies er some shit-haha</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-but anyhoo we headed over to goodwill and they changed their whole system and shit so we didnt know which color ticket was the half off color this week....so we were mad-so i raided all the shirt racks-the men and womens and i found like shit loads of shirts...</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-so i went and tried 'em all on and found a good handful</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-i noticed that a bunch of the shirts i was tryin on were sooo preppy!-damn my preppyness tryin to come out!-i swear deep down inside i wanna be a prep and dress all like it-haha!</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-yeah so anyways i went to check out and i got awesome bargains on my 8 shirts!-2 were polos-i couldnt help myself!-haha...yeah yeah call me a dork i cant help it!-its funny actually, cuz like the polos actually kinda make me look more lesbianish-haha-but oh well i dont care-i like 'em!-my mom wasnt very happy about 'em but too bad its not her choice!-haha</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-yeah and its funny cuz my mom got some shirts too and stuff and so when we got out we compared receipts-and dude, i always end up getting a better bargain than my mom-and i have no idea how-everytime we go to goodwill that happens-i always get my stuff for a lot cheaper than i should of and stuffs.....</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">so after that mom was tired and told me to drive-i almost dropped dead when she said that-i was like wow-cuz i never thought id hear the day where she would say i want you to drive-haha-so yeah we went to burger king for some dinner and sat in the parkin lot and ate it in the car-and fed fries to the birds-it was fun. </font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">and since burger king was in a plaza with a bunch of stores and stuff there were people walking around getting in adn out of their cars and so towards the end of eating me and my mom got wicked silly and so my mom started screaming random shit at people in the parking lot-they are very far away mind you-but still extremely embrassing!-so yeah anyways it was just wicked funny cuz shes fuckin crazy-i kept tryin to roll up the window to keep her from screaming swears and screaming hello at perfect strangers-so then she started tryin to honk the horn but i was sitting in the drivers seat so i kept tryin to shoo her away-so finally we calmed down adn stopped laughing enough to drive-and so i started driving and my mom rolled down the window and started screaming random shit at passing cars and im like dude mom someones gonna like shoot us or cut us off and we were just laughing and giggling and like crying cuz we were laughing so hard!-i was so afraid i was gonna hit a car or something since i was laughing so hard and coudlnt see cuz i was tearing up soo bad!</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-my mom is wicked crazy but i love her!-we have such fun times together alot...</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-yeah when we were leaving BJ's-they check your receipt and items to make sur eyou werent taking anything you didnt buy out-and so hes like ok youre all set and then my mom is like i dunno i would check her pockets as she points to me-i'm like MOM!!!!!-GOD!-hahaha-shes such a punk!-but ya gotta love her...</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-so anyhoo....me and my mom are thinking about getting Kaci a playmate cuz shes just soo wicked hyper and psycho and i dunno we just think shed have more fun with another kitten-cuz she tries to play with Lola-our shitzu-but she hates Kaci-so i dunno we just htink itd be nice for Kaci to have someone to cuddle and play with-and we found an ad in the Lakeville Journal for grey tabby kittens-and we called but got no answer so i was saddened-cuz i'd love another kitty-i heart kitties!-haha-yeah i'm a weirdo-hehe</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-so i've been developing some wicked hot bruises all over me-and i have no idea how in the hell i have been getting them but me and my mom are a lil worried about my mysterious bruises-they're pretty tho-theyre like a nice blue color-haha</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-who knows-i'm prolly dying....haha</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-so, onto a totally different subject....</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-school.....i have figured out that there is absolutely no way i can live on campus-it is just totally and completely not financially possible-so no matter what i'm gonna be living off campus--whether its with someone i chose or if i find smoeone who is lookin for a roommate on first class in an aprtment then so be it-i'll have to do that--but i've asked julie if she would be interested in getting an apartment with me since she has made mention of wanting to live off campus....</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-i think its a great idea-i mean, we both have the same lifestyle-if ya get what i mean-lesbians-haha-so i wont have to worry about someone not liking that about me-or being phobic towards me-that and i dunno, i think we would get along just fine-we seem to have the same likes and dislikes-but i dunno 'bout the kitty situation-did you lie to me miss julie?-cuz i saw a bulliten you posted and you said you were a dog girl not a kitty girl-so does that mean you really dont actually like kitties?-cuz we dont have to get one-i'm just lame and if i could have one i would want one....</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-but i'm getting ahead of myself-we need a place first-i'm gonna be lookin as soon as the beginning of july just cuz i wanna get a move on it-and if i can, i would move in a couple weeks before school starts to get situated and shit--i'm slowly but surely tryin to save up-for a security deposit thingy but i dunno-its gonna be tough-i got loans up my ass to make payments on next week so there goes my paycheck....</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-thats the biggest problem is the stupid first/last month rent and deposit shit!</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-but ill just gonna try adn do my best-i still owe morgaine one months rent too...</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-and speaking of her she finally contacted me....</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-guess what she said to me?-the first time she has contacted me in a lil more than a week that i've been gone...she texts me and says i'm watching peaches!-yeah she saw peaches in concert at her NIN concert which i thougth was weird but whatever.....anyhoo-i just thought that was weird-i just thought the first thing she would say to me is hey how are ya err something. but i guess i shouldnt be picky-just feel lucky that she even still acknowledges me as alive.....</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-ugh!-ya know what really sucks tho!??-is i keep having dreams with morgaine in them-they range from vivid to like random-and i dunno why!-i dont like it....i confided in my mom about it and shes like well, do you ever think about her and get sad about everything and stuffs-and i'm like no not really i've been pretty good about ignoring it and shes like thats it right there-your dreams are prolly showing your deep down emotions about her er something-and shes got a good point there...i havent really faced that whole thing....but then again i dont think i have much more to face-everything adn anything awful that could happen between us have happened already-she dumped me, she stopped kissing me, she stopped sleeping with me, and then finally we stopped living together....what else is there?-i dont know....i guess she could stop being my friend and totally stop talking to me-i mean that could be the last worse thing-maybe thats it then....</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-well anyhoo.....the weather has been shitty and i havent been able to go to the canaan carnival yet-and tomorrow is the last day i think-and i dunno if im gonna make it-bummer-and i wanted to go-only cuz like its a new company this year so it was supposta be better-and not as shitty as it has been the last couple years-so yeah....i think its gonna rain tomorrow too so i dont think thats gonna help my chances of going....</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-oh, so i've been working on my parents to let me drive up to maine to go to the July 4th concert to see Panic at the Disco-its not lookin too good-i swear they just like to ruin my life!-haha-but damn it all morgaine said is hould go cuz she did buy the ticket for me so now i'm gonna be wicked upset if i cant go!-like totally upset-thats gonna suck sooo bad....i really really did wanna go!-i havent been to any cool concerts only lame ones that i shall not disclose cuz they are embarassing....but yeah....</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-mmkay, well i'm startin to get wicked heavy-eyed so i think its time to sign off and go to bed...yay for sleeping FOREVER tomorrow cuz i actually dont have to go to work tmw!!!-yay!!!-i've been going to work for 8am every single day this week!-oh yeah tuesday was awesome-8am to 8pm-oh fuck yeah that was loads of fun-NOT!-but next week-ALOT more easier so yay rah!....night night time....</font></p>

"event","<p><font size=""2"">--i went to see Ohmen errr however you spell that-tonight with my mom-cuz i'm lame like that.</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">--but shes the only one i can ever find to go watch scary movies with me.</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">--so yeah it was creepy...after the movie i went to go pee and i asked my mom to come with me cuz i was scared-haha yeah i was actually creeped out afterwards...</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">--so she came in with me and as i was buttoning up my pants-the lights turn off and i scream like a freakin lil girl!-and then i hear laughing-yeah my mom turned off the lights and i guess she got a couple other ladies that were in there to go along with it so they were all laughing at my reaction-har har har my mom is just soo funny-shes such a punk!-haha</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">--so anyhoo....i worked 9 hours straight today at work-my first wicked long shift-and just to let you guys all get the gist of this 9 hour shift-there are no breaks and you just kind of have to stuff your face with food inbetween customers and makin sandwiches and ice cream cones. so yeah. it was really tought on me. </font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">--i think this whole getting back to work right away thing wasnt such a good idea-because oh my god do i hurt all over-i feel a lil like i did when i was first coming down with mono so i'm worried....i dont want a relapse-cuz i heard its worse if you relapse err whatever....</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">--well, i actually don't have to work this weekend and this is going to be the last weekend for a very very long time that i have completely off-cuz from here on out i have to work 6 days a week and two 9 hour shifts guarenteed a week-oh god kill me now!</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">--i know there are prolly some of you out there thinking/saying how hard could it be to work at a deli/gas station-well ya know what-if you were me and dealt with the shit i dealt with today you would get it and prolly by the end of the day be like, 'oh god i've had enough get me out of here!'....so yeah just trust me on this its not all fun and games. sure you get to have soft serve as much as ya want but i'm tryin to avoid it cuz that shit makes ya pack on the pounds really easily!--that, and it hurts my tum tum if i eat it too much-stupid being slightly lactose intolerant!-pssh! stupidness!<br /><br />-me and my mom JUST emptied out the back of our car FINALLY of my stuff....and by JUST i mean like 10 minutes ago-in the dark-it was creepy but fun-and yeah so we're both so freakin tired and we had to keep like doing team effort carrying of heavy things but the whole time we were moving it we were laughing sooo hard that we werent doing so well-anyhoo you shoulda saw us i bet it woulda been a fun show to watch.....</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">--still no word from morgaine. maybe shes dead. maybe she doesnt care that i'm alive. who knows. whatever. maybe i'll text her this weekend sometime to see if shes alive. is it a crime to wonder how she is?-how she is doing? *siiiigh* i dunno.....whatever.....mayhaps i should give up my whole 'caring about everyone and everything' thing and not care about her?--cuz that whole caring thing is such a weakness of mine-half the people i know dont care half as much as i do about half the stuff i care about....and now i'm ranting and rambling so i'm gonna shut up and go to bed cuz it is waaaaaay past my normal time of passing outness.....</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">--last words: I HATE YOU MONO!!! thank you and have a nice night.....</font></p>"

"event","<p><font size=""2"">-well i'm back home. </font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-i had made the move to move out of the apartment in maine i was in with morgaine.</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-i knew she was never going to step up and tell me when i had to go-or what she was planning on doing about our living situation-seein as how she said she didnt think we should live together anymore and how she had to be on her own to become self-sufficient-whatever she means by that....</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-but so yeah. i was like, yeah i'm gonna go home in a week-and she didnt object or seem to feel bad that i had to go back home cuz she knew how badly i didnt want to go back home-but nope, didnt even seem to phase her when i told her....</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-so like my whole family came up to move me out-which was kind of good cuz it only took like 20 minutes to pack the truck and car and then we were off...</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-leaving her was so hard...cuz i was afraid that would be the last time i ever see her...i mean come on, shes in love with her ex, so if her and her ex did get back together i highly doubt her ex would allow morgaine to see me-i mean come on-morgaine has told me how she wouldnt let her do other things before so she would prolly most certainly have strong feelings against morgaine seein me seein as how we have a past together...</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-i really can not handle the fact that i may not be able to keep morgaine as a friend because of her ex...</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-and i really dont think that would be nice or fair of her ex, if she made morgaine swear never to see me or what not..</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-i mean come on, we are all adults here-we should act like them...</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-but who knows-maybe i will be able to keep morgaine as a friend...</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-i really dont want to lose her as a friend because she really is the most amazing person i have ever met</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-and i really do care about her alot</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-she is just absolutely so much fun to be around and stuff and i dont wanna lose that...</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-yeah but whose to say morgaine even wants to keep me around as a friend...</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-i mean she hasnt responded to any of my text messages-nor has she cared to contact me in anyway to see how i am...</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-cuz besides me of course being upset about leaving her and i was upset and worried about coming home-[i thought she might call to see how i was doing dealing with that] but besides all that i thought maybe she'd call to see how i'm feeling cuz i've been fighting getting over mono...</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-yeah i got like freakin wicked sick at the beginning of like almost 2 weeks or so ago-it was horrible-so i went to the doctor and had some tests done and wouldnt ya know-i have mono</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-god it was awful-i had horribly swollen glands and i hurt everywhere and i was so weak i couldnt move-it was bad</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-i think it was the worse thing i've experienced in a looong time</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-i'm just sooo glad it only lasted a week...</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-towards the end of last week i was starting to feel human again..</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-but ive realized mono really attacks your strength-i am like soo freakin weak i hate it!</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-like even still now that i feel better-im still really weak-i can barely lift shit-its really weird</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-my mom is starting to worry about that cuz she thinks it could be something else thats makin me weak</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-i'm like grr mom dont worry-its prolly me still getting over mono</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-cuz my side still hurts every now and again if i push myself too hard-[side hurts cuz i guess with mono your spleen can become enlarged and so when it hurts thats what it is-its enlarged er some shit]</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-so yeah it sucks...cuz i've started working this week and god monday was soooo horrible!-by the end of the day i was hurting everywhere and i was soooo tired and weak i passed out when i hit the bed!-it was baaaad-cuz i'm usually a night owl who doesnt sleep-but lately thats all i can do cuz i just pass right the fuck out....</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-yeah so, when i got home this past weekend-we have a scale in the bathroom and out of curiosity i weighed myself-cuz i've noticed how all my shirts are getting really big on me and my pants and shorts just totally really dont fit without a belt-and sure enough i scared the crap out of myself when i stepped on the scale because i havent weighed that little in like forever!</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-and i asked my mom how accurate the scale was and shes like kel, i just put batteries in it so its fairly accurate sorry-and she was saying sorry cuz she thought i was mad at the scale for it being too heavy-but i was like no!-i'm just scared cuz i havent seen these numbers in forever!</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-yeah so it said 140-i was like daaaamn-thats creepy!-i havent seen those numbers for my weight in a looooooong time!-and i'm like alright this is actually weird-cuz i dont see it-like i dont see the weight loss-im still chubby in all the areas ive been chubby in-haha-so i dont get it....</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-my mom is like maybe your muscles are deteriating adn thats why your weak and thats where your weight loss is-in your muscle loss-and i'm like mom-youre crazy!-haha</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-she is crazy-and ever since i've met morgaine-morgaine has made me realize just how crazy my mom is-with all the stuff she tells me-she is soo wrong with half the things shes told me-oh well.</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-yeah so i thought that was interesting.</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-so anyways, i got a new kitten. cuz like 3 weeks ago or so-our only cat we had left at our house-got hit by a car! :-( i was so completely devestated cuz this cat was the best cat we have ever owned ever in the history of being cat owners!-i really really loved her-so i was sad when i heard that.</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-so yeah, my mom went out to find the lady we got Sammy from and come to find out she got lucky and the same mom Sammy came from just had another litter of kittens so my mom got a kitten and brought it home for me before i got back from maine so i could have a cat to come home to.</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-yeah we had another kitty named Peanut but she disappeared this past winter-we think she died in a horrible snow storm we had-it was really really sad.</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-so yeah, this kitten i dont think should have been taken from her mother just yet cuz she is wicked wicked tiny!-but mayhaps she was just the runt. who knows...</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-but yeah shes all black with blue eyes and a lil fluffy-sort of like sammy. and her name is Kaci.</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-'cept sammy was a lil more fluffier as a kitten than kaci. and sammy has gorgeous green eyes.</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-and i think she sort of had a tiger look to her if the right light shines on her-so i'm not sure what shes gonna look like when she grows up.-but we'll seen soon enough.</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-shes such a cutie.</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-i cant get her to sit in my arms like sammy tho.</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-but if you give her time she will come to you and cuddle.</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-but i'll end up makin her like being cuddled cuz i'm just good at that game with kitties-haha.</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-haha listen to me-i sound like such a doofus going on about cats.</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-so anyhoo. when i came back this past saturday from maine-my room was all taken apart-all my pictures off the wall and packed away in boxes in the closet. :-( the room was simple with a twin bed and just blah but nice i guess. i was very sad tho cuz it wasnt ""my room"" anymore. and oh my god i miss my big bed!-my full size bed!-i looove stretching out and shit-so i'm kinda sad to have to sleep in that cramped lil twin bed-but oh well. i'm used to sleeping with another person anyways which limits sleeping space so its not that bad. but it prolly will get back for me once i get out of the habit of being used to sleeping with someone thing.</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-yeah so anyone wanna room with me this fall?-i wanna get an apartment in maine-i cant afford to live on campus cuz i got only one loan and its shit money-so bascially i have like NO financial aid for next year and it really really sucks!-i dont know what i'm gonna do. damn it all i wanna do is complete college and make my whole family proud and be the first damn murphy to graduate college.-i mean it would be a shame not to graduate from high school cuz i am certainly smart-especially in comparison to the others in my family-NO OFFENSE to them--but i mean i seem to be the only one who excelled in school with all my A's and B's....[with the occasionally C's and D's cuz i hate history and math with a passion!] yeah but i dunno-i also do wanna be able to get a good job-my dream job-cuz i think i would just enjoy it soo much-and i mean life would be soo cool if you could do a job you love right?-so yeah i dunno.</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">-well i am fuckin beyond tired right now-i cant believe i'm actually still up-its kinda weird for me-im usually passed out by now-but i had to close the store at work tonight-so i ate dinner late and shit so thats prolly why i'm still up so well, i guess i'm gonna go pass out now....byes....</font></p>

ok ok so morgaine never really said that but she sure did imply it
and my head is really small according to morgaine and she has a wicked stupid hat!
HAH! TAKE THAT MORGAINE!!&nbsp; :-P
i like morgaine's keyboard it clicks alot when i type
shes just jealous cuz i can type and she cant
morgaine just said i should take something for my uglyiness but she said theres nothing i can take for it so i am screwed&nbsp;
morgaine is stupid and she doesnt want to talk about it
teeheehee
morgaine has no pants on right now
it is very hot!
shhhh dont tell her i&nbsp;typed this
cuz then she might hit me
i am very afraid of her
she is abusive
ha ha just kidding
morgaine is playing with her gerbils in her underwear
she is very silly
wait a minute that sounded wrong-it sounds like her gerbils are inside her underwear
but they are not
they are in her cage
and by cage i mean her...
no just kidding!
hehe she is gettin very mad at me right now and it is funny
she totally has 2 gerbils laying on her boobies right now
it is awesome
no get your mind out of the gutter
she has her shirt on
jeesh!
you're gwoss!
so yeah, the quote for the night was....
""Lets kill these bitches, then go watch Ice Age 2!""
and thats exactly what we did
but these bitches i speak of...
i can not disclose this information
and by information i mean who the bitches are
hah i make no sense
this is grrrrrrrreat
so yeah, if someone you know is missing tomorrow
i swear we had nothing to do with it
hey guess what

relaxed, sooo happy, and just soo nice<br />that i could pass out<br />but i tend to like to stay awake and take it all in<br />i like to lay on her arm<br />feel her chest rise and fall as she breathes<br />and just listen to her heart beat<br />and feel her drift into sleep<br />its just...soo....soooo....nice<br />god i wish i was more articulate....<br /><br />yeah so, we woke up around 11am-ish<br />went to brunch<br />had brunch with her friend Brett<br />and then came back here and started watching season 3 of the L Word<br />she is sooo totally hooked on it!<br />its great!<br />hehee<br />she loooves it<br />she cant get enough<br />and she thinks shane and carmen are absolutely adorable together<br />i love how cute morgaine gets everytime shane comes on<br />shes like

Brett-a matenee<br />but i came back from the shower and i guess he wasnt feeling good<br />so oh well<br />we got to watch more L Word<br />and we watched If These Walls Could Talk 2<br />cuz i've been wantin to watch it and she hadnt seen it<br />so yeah<br />then dinner came around<br />went to dinner<br />came back<br /><br />and we just kind of hung around and talked<br />it was sooo nice<br />i looove talking to her<br />i could listen to her talk about anything for like ever<br />hehe<br />but yeah<br />i have these nifty conversation cards<br />with questions on them that you ask each other<br />and so we played with those<br />and it was cool<br />it was a nice way to get to know each other even more so<br />it was kind of fun some of the things we told each other<br />but yeah<br />i dunno<br />it was just wicked nice<br />i really enjoyed just sittin and talkin with her<br />i dont care what i'm doing with that girl<br />i just really really like being with her<br />i really really have fallen for morgaine<br />i havent really let myself fall too hard emotionally<br />but last night i just got so comfortable with her<br />that i really opened up with her<br />and i fell.....<br />fell really hard....<br /><br />i dunno what happened<br />but its like<br />i just opened up the gate<br />and let all my emotions i was feeling for her out<br />and i felt them<br />those intense feelings of like<br />i hugged her soo hard<br />and rubbed her back<br />as she did with me...<br />we lay there in my bed<br />shes fallin asleep in my arms<br />and an overwhelming feeling came over me<br />to tell her just how much i really care about her<br />and how much i have fallen for her<br /><br />as she lay there drifting off&nbsp;<br />i kissed her gently on the cheek and spoke softly into her ear<br />and asked<br />can i tell you something?<br />with a light sleepy '""mmhmm""<br />i proceeded to say ""i heart you...""<br />a huge smile appeared on her face<br />and we sat there holding each other for a couple moments<br />and she whispered back to me<br />i really couldnt hear her and i was soo upset<br />but i think what i heard was ""I love you too....""<br />and so when i heard that i almost lost it<br />i hugged her even tighter<br />and rubbed her back<br />and she said ever so softly..""is that ok...?""<br />and i was just all like ""yes""<br />and i hugged her hard and kissed her<br /><br />and then of course i had to ruin the perfect moment<br />by hiding my head under a peelow<br />cuz i felt like such an ass<br />cuz i couldnt really hear what she said<br />and this was kind of a vital moment<br />and not to be sure of what she said&nbsp;<br />was not really sittin well with me<br />and i got upset<br />and she looked over at me<br />pulled the peelow off my head<br />and asked..<br />""whats the matter, are you ok..?""<br />and i was like yeah.....<br />and she said soo cutely 'aww come on kelly, tell me the truth'<br />and i was like 'i feel like an idiot'&nbsp;<br />and she was like 'how come'<br />and i said 'cuz i didnt hear what you said...'<br />and so i pouted and burried my head in her side<br />and she moved kissed my cheek...<br />...and said in her cute lil morgaine voice 'i said..i love you too...'<br /><br />when she said that<br />and confirmed what i thought i heard<br />this incredible feeling came over me i dont think i have ever felt before!<br />it was soo new and different<br />and so when she said that i didnt know what to do but kiss and her and hug her<br />and of course, me being as soft-hearted and emtional as i am<br />proceeded to sniffle into her shoulder as we layed there holding each other<br /><br />they were tears of happiness<br />at that moment in time i dont think i could of been any happier<br />i sit here now thinking about it and i'm just soo happy<br />i cant seem to stop my eyes from welling up with tears....<br /><br />i'm just soo happy<br />and i cant wait to see what is in store for me in the next couple months<br /><br />me and morgaine signed our lease for our apartment thursday morning at 9am with our crazy ass old

security deposit<br />ugh i really hate when people pay for shit for me!<br />but i'm getting used to it<br />cuz morgaine really likes to do that<br />she says shes really likes to 'take care' of the person she likes<br />er however she phrased that<br />shes such a sweet heart<br />she can be so fuzzy bunny sometimes and i loooove it!<br />yes, fuzzy bunny is me and morgaine term for when one of us says something really wicked sweet<br />yeah i know we're weird<br />but&nbsp; I LIKE IT! :-)<br />hehehe<br /><br />but so yeah, today we just layed around and watched more l word after we went to

for work<br />so i'm kinda glad i noticed that<br />but i still feel bad cuz like iw oke her up at 5<br />so she barely had time to wake up and didnt have time to eat before work<br />so i felt bad<br />and i said sorry i thought it was 4<br />but she said no thats ok<br />and so we went out in the hall to say goodbye<br />which was wicked tough<br />cuz we had been together all weekend so i was kinda sad<br />and she was all cute and was like 'thanks for letting me sleep'<br />and i was like 'aww youre silly, of course, you were sleepy adn cute' hehehe<br />yeah i know, you prolly all just

"event","yeah so my head is totally stuck in the clouds and i'm walking around like a dork with a huge smile on my face. so yeah, if you see me, and i'm grining like an idiot-yeah i'm just on cloud 9-so i'm not insane i promise-haha 

yeah so, last night was aamaaaaazing! 
like WHOA! 
haha 

yeah so, sunday night morgaine asked me if i wanted to come over monday night after she got done with classes and hang out and watch a movie er suttin. 
so yeah, she proceeded to be like::: 
K: and no, i was just tryin to be a good student adn read-cuz i had no idea what the prof. was talking about in class today 
M: knowing what is going on is good, but u know what else is good too? 
K: whats that? 
M: hanging out with me instead. That way u dont need to know what is going on. Its much easier 
M: :-D 
K: hehe that does sound pretty damn good 
M: yeah, i know 
M: i get to do it all the time and its pretty cool stuff:-P 
K: hahah i bet 

yeah so that was the end of that and i was like....umm okay...like she didnt ask me if i wanted to come over-i was like umm, okay....i was kinda sad bout that.. 
so later on i got the balls to ask her why she didnt persist to ask me to come over.... 
and she thought i was busy and didnt wanna press it er suttin 
so then she was all like::: 
M (9:55:40 PM): so..........u in a hurry to go to bed? cuz watchin a movie alone is no fun(especially if i can see you jump :-P ) 

hehehe so yeah. that was cute. so then she was all like:::: 

K: hahaha 
K: and nope im in no hurry to go to bed at all 
K: but i dont know where oxford is...i know its somewhere up there on hilltop 
K: haha 
K: ive never really walked up there before 
M: i doesnt matter where it is cuz ur not walking by ur self at night. I'll pick u up 
K: aw pick me up you dont have to do that 
K: that takes a lot of effort 
K: haha 
M: i'll worry if u walk 
K: alright 
M: its no trouble really 
K: alright if you say so 
M: i do, im on my way 

so i was all like awww hehehe. 
and so she came and picked me up. and i was all nervous as can be. cuz she just always makes me all flustered cuz shes soo gorgeous!-haha 
so then we get into her room, and we decided to watch the 'corpse bride' 
and damn she has a teeny tv!-haha 
but we watched it on her computer instead 
she has bunk beds and a futon 
so i was sitting on her futon and she was on her bed 
and i was kinda sad she was so far away 
like i thought this is weird 
but i was just like *shrug* maybe shes just uncomfy 

yeah so that movie was weird. 
but not too bad. 
so after the movie she showed me this funny website-you should check it out its funny shit--> www.stuffonmycat.com 
haha just the name of the site is funny! 
yeah so we had some good laughs. 
then she came over and sat with me on the futon... 
and we just started talking and shit 
it was nice 
and of course we were laughing and shit too 
so hard my sides were hurting and shit! 
and of course the sexual jokes.... 
there were a bunch more of those this time around... 

so as 5am approaches, i was like wow, we did it again. 
stayed up all night 
its just soo nice 
like the time just flies 
like i seriously dont even notice that its whatever time it is 
its just soo nice! 
yeah so as the night went on and morning came... 
i noticed she got closer and closer to me 
and we started holding hands and stuff 
it was sooo nice 
i was like oh my god-haha 
cuz me + touch = yay-haha 
i'm a weirdo i know-hehe 

yeah so like around 5am-ish, her head ended up on my tummy, and she was just laying there. 
and we were both just kinda laying there in the quiet 
both sleepy 
but it was soo nice 
so i started strokin her hair and face and stuff every so gently sorta to lull her to sleep 
cuz i knew she was sleepy 
so i figured id get her to sleep and then leave 
but then i dont even remember that happened! 
but the next thing i know she was kissing me! 
i was like oh my god i'm dying! 
haha 

its like, its a dream! 
whats going on! 
haha 
mm i dunno 
all i DO know is it was nice 
and needless to say the rest of my morning was a blur 

we fell asleep on her futon, and it was nice 
we were like cuddling and holding each others hand and stuff. 
but around 9am-ish i'm like hmm, i'm prolly not gonna sleep much if i dont go back to my room and sleep 
cuz its really hard to sleep in jeans and shit 
so i told her i was gonna go and damn that was hard 
its hard to leave a cute sleeping girl! 
id rather have stayed an cuddled with her 
but i knew i needed sleep 
and i prolly wouldnt have gotten much if i didnt leave 

so yeah, i leave her dorm around 9am-ish. got half way back to my dorm and realized i left my card on the floor in her room. i was like shit! but i knew sam was in the room and i could prolly get my card later 
plus i wanted morgaine to sleep-she needed to sleep cuz she had lots of work to do today 

so yeah i'm all walkin in the bright morning sunlight-in a fuckin daze-my hair is all messy and im wearing the same clothes i wore the day before going wow-i've never done this before-haha 
it was a beautiful morning this morning! 
it really was! 
sounds so corny i know, but it was. 

so i get back to my dorm, put some pj's on, and crawled into bed a lil before 10am. 
i was tryin to text morgaine to tell her about my card and not to worry about it-and just sleep and what not 
but i dont know if it sent-cuz i just totally passed out while holding my phone-haha 
i dont even remember sam getting up going to class 
thats how out of it i was 
so around noon or a lil after or so, i think i hear a noise-but i thought i was dreaming-then the next thing ya know, i felt cold skin on mine.... 
morgaine kissed me awake!-hehe-what a nice way to wake up right?!? 
def the best way to wake up i think-hehe 
she came to give me my card back-and i'm like aww thanks. 
so she stuck around until 12:45 cuz she had O-Chem Lab at 1pm, so yeah. 
that was really nice. 
so it's been a whole 8 hours since i've last seen her and she's all i can think about-hehe 
actually thats what she said too:::: :-) 

M: hey sexy, guess who I cant stop thinking about? :-D 
M: all i wanna do i hang out with u and stuff and i cant because of this stupid midterm thingy 
M: im not happy about that 
K: aww i know!-i totally wanna be with you soo bad right now-but i know if i did that you totally wouldnt get it done so i'm like no, she neeeeds to get her work done haha 
M: well im gonna get crackin on my homework. something u will learn about me is that when i wanna be with someone really bad not much will stop me, i will think of every conceivalbe way to make that happen.:-P. im stubborn like that 

yeah so after she said that i was all like awwwww-hehehe made me go like this--> :-) 
haha 
yeah im a dork 
i know. 
but i'm happy and thats always good right? 
right. 

yeah so, i'm happy but then i'm like in a financial crisis-its kind of a bummer-cuz like my heads in the clouds and shit but once it comes out, its like FUCK! stupid stupid money issues!-i'm screwed! 
but i'm really tryin not to think about it... 
cuz its a freakin downer-but i gotta be aware of it too at the same time-so yeah.... 
but anyhoo-i'm wicked tired and i ache everywhere so i should prolly go to bed early. so that's where i'm headed. night night everyone. hope all is well in your worlds! :-) 



P.S

You're very unique and funky, yet you still have a bit of traditionalism to you.
People who like you think they have great taste... and they usually do.

Sometimes we don't understand our partner's requirements, or even our own. We all have a ""love tank"" that needs to be filled in order for us to express love to others, but there are different means by which our tank can be filled, and there are different ways that we can express love to others.<br><br><a href='http://www.youthnetsouthampton.org.uk/breakout/lovelanguages.php' target='_blank'>Take the quiz</a>"

"event","<p><font color=""#003366"" size=""2"">-well lets play the update game shall we?<br /><br />--Friday.<br />-up early.<br />-abn. psych class-had a test-bombed it reeeeal bad!-got the grade later on friday afternoon-and did worse than my first psych test.&nbsp;<br />-so i was bummed out. but oh well, just gotta try harder next time huh?<br />-then bio-my dreaded bio test i had been studying for all last week-i think i did half good half bad-so i wont know just how good er bad i did until i get my grade back. she takes forever to give them back. so yeah.....it may be a while longer.<br />-then after that i was like yay for no more tests!-and went to the bookstore and bought myself a new hoodie. cuz all my other ones are waaay to big for me. so that made me feel better. i'm such a girl-cuz like, shopping/buying new things can just make me oh so happy-haha.<br />-then i had to buckle down and do laundry.<br />-that was pretty easy seein as how no one was around the dorms so i pretty much had the laundry room to myself. that made me happy.<br />-then i cleaned my room.<br />-that wasnt too much fun cuz i was all on my hands and knees with my tiny hand broom sweeping the floor.<br />-but i got some sweet rug burn from it.<br />-guess i shouldnt have been on my knees in shorts huh?haha<br />-oh my god it was soooo eerie in the dorms friday night. i was scared-haha<br /><br />--Saturday.<br />-woke up at like 8am. took a shower.<br />-still weirded out by how quiet the dorm was.<br />-and the bathrooms were still clean on a saturday morning-now that was just crazyness-haha<br />-then i put my stuff together cuz maia and carla would be there at 10:15 to pick me up.<br />-for some reason i started getting wicked nervous.<br />-and of course that yucky feelin got worse when 10:30 came around and she hadnt shown up yet.<br />-meh anyhoo. nerves bout going home i suppose.<br />-so then carla brought me n maia to the bus station in bangor. which was wicked nice of her cuz she seemed really down n out sick. i felt bad. she had an ear infection :-(&nbsp; i know how much those suck for sure!<br />-so we get there. the bus is already there.&nbsp;so i'm thinking&nbsp;oh no we're gonna get shitty seats.<br />-got&nbsp;our tickets. said goodbye to carla.<br />-she gave me a hugh goodbye.<br />-i think i could of cried....<br />-i'm such a weirdo i know.<br />-but its just...i dunno....i miss carla.<br />-i miss hanging out with her.<br />-and i dunno, that was just the closest i've gotten to her in awhile...<br />-but enough of my weird kelly emotional stuff...<br />-so me and maia get on the bus.<br />-and sure enough the bus was wicked packed.<br />-but we actually got some good seats.<br />-but sure enough there was something wrong with them<br />-the damn headphone thingy didnt work. so we couldnt hear the movies. it was sad. cuz it was 2 good movies i wanted to see.--&gt;Series of Unfortunate Events and March of the Penguins<br />-when the Penguin movie came on they were just oh so cute!-i couldnt stop giggling-haha.<br />-but i didnt mind. cuz i got to talk to maia which was nice. i havent been able to just sit and talk with her and such what in a long time so it was really&nbsp;nice. :-)&nbsp; i really miss her. just like being around her, hanging out, talking, laughin all that good stuff.....so yeah.....<br />-yeah so the bus was sooo packed 3 people stood all the way to Portland!-i was like wow!<br />-i was surprised when we got to Portland cuz i was like wow that was fast.<br />-the same with when we got into Boston. i was like wow already?!<br />-it kind of made me sad tho, cuz i was all like aww, my bonding time with maia is over...*sniffles*<br />-so in Boston i met maia's dad. that was embarrassing. only cuz i had jsut come out of the bathroom and washed my hands of course. and there were no paper towels and the freakin hand dryer sucked. so i came out and he wanted to shake my hand but i didnt wanna be rude but my hands were soaked-so i try and shook them off and quickly wiped them on my pants before i shook his hand and felt like an ass cuz he had to shake my wet hand-haha oh wellsies.<br />-so the ride home with maia's dad was interesting. they had some pretty good conversations about marine science/bio/geo what have you. but after awhile i got a lil lost and started to get sleepy. hehe. then her dad like asked me wha ti was studying and i felt silly cuz it was like psych and not something scientific like-hehe. oh well.<br />-so the ride with maia's dad went by pretty fast. i was like wow again-haha<br />-then we met up with maia's mom. i like maia's mommy. shes fun. :-)<br />-but anyhoo.....got into canaan around 7?-i forget-and met up with my parents at mcdonalds.<br />-i was like hmm i dunno if i wanna see 'em. but i kinda had to huh?-haha<br />-so i went in there and my mom was alll excited and she was all funyn sounding cuz she was sick. haha<br />-she has also lost some weight. i was like wow. where did some of my mommy go?-haha<br />-she sure was happy to hear that comment<br />-so daddy didnt seem very happy to see me. but whatev. guess he must of been in a bad mood.&nbsp;<br />-he drove home which i wasnt happy about cuz oh my god it felt like ions until we finally got home!-he is sch a slow ass driver!<br />-so i got home. dad almost killed himself carrying my bag which i told him not to but hes just such a stubborn man!<br />-i was sad when there was no Peanut jumpin up for me....and then Sammy was no where around either-so i was like well what a bummer dude-i'm such a cat lover its sick-haha<br />-but oddly enough Lola was all like OH MY GOD KELLY!-and i was like youre weird-cuz she never used to like me-haha<br />-so that was that. nothing really exceptional happened that night.<br />-but OH MY GOD MY BED WAS ORGASMIC!!!-and eww, no, dont think that you gross heads!-it was just soooo comfy!!!!!-i was in love with my bed. but i didnt like the stupid blanket i had cuz its a feather comforter and the feathers kept coming out and tickling my face er suttin.<br /><br />--Sunday.<br />-i was woken up at 5am by my kitty Sammy! that made me happy but then not happy cuz she clawed the shit out of my face when i was tryin to fall back asleep.-she does that when you dont pet her.&nbsp;<br />-then i thought i was dead. cuz i just could not wake up. or when i actually did finalyl wake up at 12:30pm it was all quiet and i was like whoa, where am i?-its quiet, am i dead?-lol-i think i was a lil out of it.....<br />-so i got up and showered.<br />-mommy was cooking a big late lunch for the whole family. the boys were gonna come over.&nbsp;<br />-she made my favies-baked boneless chicken breast. whipped mashed potatoes. frozen bag corn.[the frozen bag part is key here-lol] mashed carrots. and for the boys broccoli and cheese... then some yummy bisquits.<br />-i was like *drooool* i heart home made food!-yay for no commons and actually yay for no fried greasy shit food!<br />-so then after lunch i went and took a nap cuz my head was killing me. i woke up with a horrible headache and took stuff and it still hadnt gone away and stuffs.<br />-so i took my nap-woke up at 6pm still had the headache-i was like grrr!<br />-yeah so um, that was my sunday-kind of a waste of the day but i dunno-i felt like crap and i needed the sleep too so yeah.<br /><br />--Monday aka yesterday-haha<br />-woke up with my headache still. which pissed me off. went back to sleep and got up at 11am. felt a lil better.<br />-wandered around the house going what shall i do.<br />-so i had the brilliant idea of listening to some music while showering.<br />-that was loads of fun.-haha<br />-i of course mostly blasted panic at the disco since i'm obsessed with em at the moment. haha.<br />-then i ate some lunch. had the most delicious turkey sandwich in the history of the world.<br />-cuz it was the good turkey from Big Y and the good rolls. i was like mmmmmmmm tastey.<br />-then i got bored and didnt feel like sitting in my room.&nbsp;<br />-my room has been full of lots of memories and i dont like it.<br />-so ive been avoiding my room at all costs.<br />-so i went and washed the few dishes in the sink.<br />-then i vacuumed a lil.<br />-then dad eventually came home.&nbsp;<br />-he wasnt in a berry good mood.<br />-my mom was MIA most of monday.<br />-she eventually showed up around 7pm.<br />-i made her some dinner cuz we've been on some sketchy terms lately.<br />-but that didnt help cuz we still ended up fighting.<br />-long story short: she doesnt want me coming home lookin like a dyke......whatever mom!-i am what i am!<br />-ugh!!!!! she just makes me so angry tellin me that shed be ashamed of me if i came home lookin like a dyke!<br />-ugh whatever!<br />anyhoo..........<br />&nbsp;onto.....<br /><br />--Today:<br />-umm..................didnt do much.&nbsp;<br />-i had the chance to go see maia and hang out with her.<br />-but noooooo!<br />-me and mom got in a fight about use over the car. whatever. shes such a taker-backer-errr whatever-haha<br />-so yeah i was bummed out about not being able to go see her. it prolly woulda been nice. i mean, when was the last time i got to hang out with just maia? god, its been like, forever....but anyways....<br /><br /><br />--so i have the cutest kitty in the world. shes laying on my right now as i attempt to type this. when shes actually in the house she clings to me like glue. she gave us a scare by not coming in for just about the whole day the other day. if sammy left and never came back er whatever i would have to admit i would cry. cuz she is my favie. and she is the most prettiest kitty i think i have ever had. but i still hope peanut if ok....siiigh....i hope she is just makin babies er suttin.....<br /><br />--so i've been going through a lot of stuff in my room cuz im bored. not a good idea. waaaaay too many memories come flooding back. they are happy memories-really happy ones-dont get me wrong. but it just makes me sad cuz i miss those memories ya know?<br /><br />--yeah ok, so i'm done. and i can't wait to go back to school where i can be myself. i cant really be myself here-theres like too many people around me with such expectations....my mom is soo happy about how long my hair has gotten and how thin i am and how i look so girly-so the fact that ive been tryin to confide in her about how i want to change she wont hear a word of it. then i tried my dad. haha-he was like no!! you're beautiful just the way you are why do you need to change?-ok, so that was the sweetest thing i think he has ever said to me, but it just bums me out cuz i know i'm gonna upset him if i change my image err whatever....<br /><br />--siiigh i dunno.......i just dont feel i am me...like i feel like im trapped inside someone i'm really not...ya know?...i dont know how to explain it....i feel i am being someone i'm not. and i dont like it. and i plan on changing that. and i cant wait. i cant wait to get back to school and be myself. and change. -oddly enough i have never liked change but ya know, i think i'm gonna like this one......<br /><br />--yeah, i think i'm gonna like this alot.....<br /><br />-here's to change...happiness.....life.....love....friends.....!!!<br /><br />the end!<br />:-)<br /><br /></font></p>"

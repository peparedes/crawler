"event","Hey yall, im sorta depressed right now and I dont know why! I always seems to get sad when I listen to music. I just wish I could leave this frickin town and become someone new. I will be doing that in about 4 years. Im moving to Knoxville to UT. I want to become a vet. If I don't do that I still leaving this HOLE of a town. Everyone knows what you do and why you do it. In some ways that is good and in others it is bad. Becky and I are still working on getting together to make out demo. That's another way I could get out of this town. Become a singer and move far far FAR away. Maybe to Knoxville or Nashville. Somewhere where I can just start a new life away from these ppl. I love my friends but some are not my friends. Friends dont talk about each others behind their backs. Thats not a definition of a friend now is is? Julie, Whitney, Karissa, Amber, Becky, Tyler, Glen, Billy, James, Kelli, Ashley, Kat, Teri, Melanie, Anna, Whitney C., Eric, Sarah, Patrick, etc. You know who u are that I adore. But some of my ""friends""(none that i metioned above)i like. I mean yea i talk to them just to be nice. But thats cause im a nice person. Well I will write again laterz. Mom is flippin so she can order some pizza...Love ya...laterz.

"event","Hey ya'll. I'm so depressed. I keep thinking that I will never get kissed. Whitney and I were the last not to be kissed. Now I am. She kissed Justin (her bf) and left me to fend for myself in the non kissed world. I feel so alone I just want to be loved by Aaron. He is so cute and I think he will date me. Teri said that he would. I hope so. I LOVE him to death. Well listen to these songs it explains everything..... Where You Are, Jessica Simpson *&* Nick Lachay -or- On The Way Down, Ryan Cabrera -or- Over and Over, Nelly *&* Tim McGraw"

"event","well im study hall (the photoroom) and i have nothing to do so i figured i would come to lj and talk about random things.

Courtney works with me now she starts 2mara. its good. 
i dont have to work today, so crystal is takin me home and idk if she is gonna stay for a while then i think jake is commin over to see my new house since he hasnt, haha then i dont kno what im gonna do we might walk to his house but that is just me thinkin im not sure if he wants to. but idk. so ppl said some mean stuff to clinton today it kinda mad me made but i just kept to myself cause i think fightin and drama is stupid ppl who cause it are most likely immature, and thats not directed to anyone imperticular...cause i kno thats what your thinkin but no not everything is about you. im really bored. i dont want to go back to study hall cause that is even more boring and yea. god i have 30 minutes to waste that sounds good, i wonder how long this is gonna be by the time i get done....

friday i went to the movies with daniel and courtney we saw the hills have eyes yea that movie is horrid. i saw jami there, she sat behind me. lol well my opinion is whoever made that movie is inhumaine. some of the stuff in the movie i cant believe someone actually thought of, its mostly gore then scary but then again thats what ppl like these days isnt it? 

my shoe has like a HUGE skuff on it im so mad grrrr:)  i am buyin new ones anyway on friday or thursday with me check im gettin my nose pierced to!! im excited well my dad got moved from fort dodge to newton. so thats good. its closer. haha. well if your still readin this you are either really bored and have nothing else to do or your just readin it to make sure i didnt talk about you, dont worry i dont sink that low to talk shit on lj. but hey.... well i think im gonna go walk around a little....updates maybe sometime soon but lj is pretty much dead.




Much Love :) MUAH  <3"

"event","This goes to all the ppl you say rap is nothing but ppl talkin about bitches and hoes.....its not you need to listen to some 2Pac, Eminem, and Jay-Z. 2Pac made a song called: Keep Ya Head Up. Its very postive and has nothing at all to do with drugs, sex, and violence. Eminem made a song: Mockingbird. Nothing involving drugs and sex. Jay-Z made a song: December 4th. All about his life, and a very nice song. All abosolutely clean of everything people assume is in rap. I hate it when people who have never even listened to at the most, 2 minutes of rap in their whole lifetime, assume that its always negative. Plus rapping is a lot more than just talking. And it does require talent. To be rapping is to be rhyming poetry very quickly and loudly, to a beat, in a rhythm (which is the hardest part), in a stressed to unstressed form. 



Writing good lyrics and making good beats are very hard and essential to an excellent rap song.Rap is music. Very real and entertaining."

Ashley, i dont kno if you get on here anymore but when i call u dont answer so this is worth a try


Why did u have joe anderson call me house and threaten me? If you want to kno if i am talkin shit call me yourself, i never said anything about you. If i did i would say it to your face and you kno i would. You can tell joes stupid ass i am not scared of him or his sister i dont care if she is in her 20's or w/e, she will prolly whoop my ass but she is gonna be the one gettin in trouble not me. and what the hell does joe or his sister have to do with anything, your gettin ppl invovled to a problem that was not even there to begin with. It's stupid.

We saw couch willams and he said we looked like SA's, which i thought so to it was wierd. Then i saw a guy in K- Mart and he was on a cell phone and he was like WHAT the hell, i jsut saw a girl with a beard. (i drew one on w/ eyeliner) can they not tell its fake? The cashredgister lady asked courtney arn't you a little young for whiskers? man ppl these days, there was two real funny things tho i bumped into clinton and his mom and clit did not even reconize me at first haha...then some black guy that works there said g-g-g-g- unit oooo and there girls, it was great.

but enough about that how has everyone been? I'm same ol same ol. My mom told me today that if the loan thing today does not go as planned we most likely will not move. I want to move. 

I talked to jake friday about some feelings and stuff and i am glad we did, made me relize how much i do care about him. 


I miss the old Days.

Homcomming is comming up, so far i am going alone, or with friends, I don't think anyone is going to ask me. Kind of a bummer but what can i do. i don't have enough self convidence or courage to ask anyone so thats out of the question.

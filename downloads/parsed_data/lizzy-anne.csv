So this morning she shows up and hands me a card (eyes watering up) It is a gift card to Wal-mart with enough on it to make this a very Merry Christmas. So many co-workers gave, even though it is a hard time for all. I wish I could do something special for everyone of them (which I will try to do! Not that they expect anything in return.) This year has been rough, although I know it has been harder for most, I wasn't going to get the kids Christmas Presents ( I knew my family would give them something and I explained it to the oldest one and she didn't get upset) but now I can get them clothes and toys plus groceries ( I can't eat another sandwich!!) I know it could be worse but I'm glad that I have such caring people in my life.....(&nbsp;I just re-read my entry and I am all teary eyed at work)"

"event","I can't believe how much crap has happened in such a short time. My marriage almost ended ( yeah I know, didn't see that one coming *smirk* )Then Matt lost another job and our fragile financial structure (try saying that 5 times fast!) crumbled in a matter of days. And so did our marriage, granted it wasn't flying high, but it was semi-working (>_<)

So no internet and I hopefully can post this at work, seeing how I'm sooooooo
busy on Tuesday night ! 

Kid business Corbin has a cold and Sophia has been sick...in other news I am really grateful at the support my friends and family have given me. ( yes I am getting misty eyed!)

So hopefully I will be posting more happy news...but don't hold your breath!"

"event","I suppose it's because I'm around happy couples, but I got really depressed today around Matt I realized that we are not compatible people. So what now? well if this were a movie I would leave him and then after a rough patch meet Mr. Right , but this is real life so I will just go back to my stagnant married life..........Oh and I think this might have triggered the ""depression"" also Mika called me and said she was pregnant!! I would like to have another baby but I don't think I could put up with Matt again after what happened with Corbin.It made me realize that Mika loves her husband enough to actually want to make more babies with him. That means more stress that they go through TOGETHER. You know that thing when you have a shoulder to lean on when your stressed out ? Well I wish I had that, when Matt gets stressed out he lashes out at everyone......On another note remember that I pulled my back out Friday well I still packed in front of Matt IN PAIN WHILE  he watched T.V. then when I was done he goes ""you know you didn't have to do all that""


WHAT !!!!!!!!!!! did you volunteer to do this for me !!!NO!!!You just sat on your ""life is soooo hard"" ass and watched T.V.  ASSHOLE BASTARD PIECE OF DOG S@#T !!!!!!


Now that I have vented I will now resume my life in all it's crappy glory.."

Last week I broke my glasses I put them on the floor and somehow they got underneath my sons bassinet..which rolled on them and needless to say they could not be fixed with tape (or my tightwad ass would have done so) Well after 230 dollars and 2 frames later I got glasses I liked.This morning I couldn't find them I was still in bed and searching, they couldn't have gotten far I had taken them off in bed. Then I decided maybe I took them off in the room somewhere as soon as I got up I felt it....  I had stepped on my glasses!!!! They were bent out of shape and looked like they could not be fixed, I could just picture my husband and the hour long lecture of putting my glasses on the night stand blah blah blah.....But luckily with a little elbow grease i was able to fix them.. lecture avoided!!! I hope I remember to put them on the night stand or I really will be the Queen Of The DUMB-ASSES!!!"

"event","<font size=""3"">Wow, I didn't know I'd have such a dilemma spelling <b>corn-hole</b>. Anyways back to the matter at hand. Many of you know that I am </font><font size=""3""><font size=""4"">not </font>a morning person given the choice I would sleep all day and then only get up to do my next favorite thing which is <b>EAT.</b>This Morning My hubby decided to joke about the fact he has no laundry, <b>Wait</b> before you say your <b>job</b> is the laundry let me relay a message my husband told me about 3months ago, He stated&nbsp; he <i>NEVER</i> had any laundry done and since it was <i>soooo</i> hard for me to keep up with it, he would relive me of this one duty and would start doing his own ........So now apparently he forgot about this <font size=""4""><b>LITTLE</b></font> argument we had.And we got into another one...........<u>about the laundry</u>........ which turned into I need to start cleaning, Now mind you, when <b>He</b> gets <font size=""4""><b><font color=""#800000"">relations</font></b></font> with me once a week he never complains, there could be laundry up to my ears!!!!! Well I guess I need to jump back on <font size=""4"" color=""#800000"">that</font> because if nothing else I'll at least be allowed to be lazy again.</font>"

"event","<font size=""5"">My biscotti habit took hold over&nbsp; a month ago. I was having lunch at my in-laws when I saw the shiny plastic container near the coffee maker. I usually like biscotti, but I have never had the </font><font size=""5"" color=""#993300"">chocolate</font><font size=""5""> kind that was calling to me that day. One bite and I was hooked I ate(I'm sad to say) </font><font size=""5"" color=""#ff00ff"">four</font><font size=""5"">. The last two I had to <i><font color=""#99cc00"">sneak</font></i> because I didn't want them to think I was a </font><font size=""5"" color=""#ff00ff"">P-I-G</font><font size=""5""> pig!! So, the following weekend I convinced my husband that we needed to go to SAMS CLUB, where they sell that yummy treat in a big cannister ........I ate 20 pieces in less then a week!?!&nbsp; I lied to my husband and said </font><font size=""5"" color=""#333300"">""my friends came over and ate them""</font><font size=""5""> and<font color=""#333300""> </font></font><font size=""5"" color=""#333300"">""I took some to work for a snack""</font><font size=""5""> So after he complained that he only had </font><font size=""5"" color=""#ff0000"">two</font><font size=""5"">, I convinced him again to go to SAM""S. This time I had a great idea, I took the old container and filled it with a fourth of the biscotti and told Matt that this was his biscotti. </font><font size=""5"" color=""#ff6600""><b>In three days I was almost out!!</b></font><font size=""5""> I was substituting my daily habit by taking turns with Matt's stash because I know he didn't count them apparently he trusts me(insert evil<b><font color=""#339966""> Mwahaha</font></b> laugh) So by the fifth day things are looking bad, Matt is going to notice he only has four left, and I have two so I do the only thing I know that will make things right........ </font><font size=""5"" color=""#00ccff"">I buy another can while Matt is at work </font><font size=""5"">, I pay in cash so he can't trace it .</font><font size=""5"" color=""#ff00ff"">(I'm always thinking.)</font><font size=""5""> I rush home and separate the new stuff and mix it in. There is only one problem...I have too many now ...</font><font size=""5"" color=""#800000"">What to do</font><font size=""5"">....</font><font size=""5"" color=""#800000"">What to do</font><font size=""5""><font color=""#800000""> </font>......It called to me and with a small <b><font color=""#ffcc00"">tear in my eye</font></b> I ate four in a row with no regrets because Matt would never know.</font>"

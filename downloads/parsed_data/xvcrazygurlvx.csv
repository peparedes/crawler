I had come home from work and was taking a nap in my room with my dog when my sister starts yelling that they are playing christmas music and at first I was like omg be quite I'm sleeping but then it registered that she said Christmas music and I was up in a second and was like what!  Basically I was very excited.  And that is the extent of my only real entry in the past year!"

"event","The rain here is ridiculous.

Our pool has overflowed and my dad has had to pump water out several times.

My dad couldn't go in to work on Monday because his Metro Stop was flooded- they said it was up to the platform where the people stand in water so no trains could run through Federal Triangle.  Also part of the beltway was closed because there was a mudslide or something.  So he turned around and came home and worked at home.  That's ridiculous!

Anyways this rain has made me want to absolutly nothing but I am forcing myself to work on my Spanish class so I can finish it before my cousins come next week.  I would have deffinitly failed this if it wasn't for the incomplete.  Isn't it sad that I am struggling to pass an online class through NOVA.  It is a good thing I didn't attempt to take spanish at vcu because I would have deffinitly failed.

We finally got a new computer downstairs after our other one died like a month ago.  So that means I have my computer back all to myself again yay!  My brother was putting tons of spywear and stuff on my computer because he goes to sketchy video game message boards and random stuff like that.

Hopefully my dad will go out and buy a car this weekend because of 4th of July sales.  He just needs to decide btw the BMW Z4or whatever the number is or the Mazda RX8or whatever the number is.  Because my brother keeps driving my car and its annoyingggggg.  He takes off my cds and messes up my mirrorsssss.  And if my dad buys the car soon then maybe I can talk him into letting me drive it down to the beach when we go down there."

"event","I layed out and tanned today!!  First I was laying on the new chairs my dad bought by the pool.  Then my sister came home and we got the new floaty longer things that my dad bought and layed in the pool.  Except it was cold and when you lay on those things you sink into the water.  So we stayed by the steps and propped them up on the steps so we didn't float away to the bugs.  Then my mom came home and now I am waiting for her to change and we are gonig to curves.  Which is good because I need to loose weight so I can loose my tummy so i can wear my bikinni and so i can make my boobs smaller so i can also wear my bikinni.  But until that happens I have my 2 tankinis to hide my fat and my boobs fit into them.  The end!

Also I got really tan from laying out for like 2 and a half hours!  yay"

"event","Once you've been tagged, you have to write a blog with 6 weird facts/things/habits about yourself, saying who tagged you. In the end you need to choose the 6 people to be tagged and list their names. No tag backs.

tagged by... Maggie

1.  I get very obsessive over things, I get something in my head and I obsess over it until I get a new obsesssion.  Right now that obsession is Keith Urban, it has previously been getting a chihauhaua, planning my family vacations and various other random things.

2.  I love my puppy and kitties more then some of my friends.  They are like my family and one of the reasons I go home so much from school is because I miss my pets, especially my Prissy cat.  I've had my dog since I was like 5 and I really can't even remember when I haven't had him and when he dies I will probably like go into depression.

3.  I am lazy.  I am perfectly fine with sitting on the couch all day long and watching tv.  I hate school but I would rather go to school then get a job and work.  I fully plan on staying in school as long as I can stretch it out and get my paretns to pay for it so I don't have to get a job.  I am going to be a teacher so I don't have to work during the summers.  As soon as I find a husband and get married I plan on not working anymore.

4.  I sleep a lot.  Like I can't wake up before 10 and feel rested no matter when I go to bed.  Since I've been home I've been gonig to bed at like 11 or 11:30 because thats when everyone else in my family goes to bed and I don't have anything else to do.  And even then I wake up at like 11.  I get like 12 hours of sleep and I still could sleep longer.  If I don't get like at least 9 hours of sleep I am not in a good mood the next day and I have to take a nap.

5.  I have like fear of doing things by myself.  I hate going places by myself, like the grocery store or the doctor.  I am slowly getting over this because my mom won't go with me anymore.  But I usually take my sister or Maggie to the grocery store with me.

6.  I hate talking on the phone to people I don't know.  That is why I don't want to work at Temp Solutions anymore.  Like my pulse races and I get really nervous whenever the phone starts ringing.  This also happens when my mom makes me schedule appointments or anything.  And my dad gets realy mad because I don't call people and he blames it on aim and me never actually talking to people and I imagine that probably does have something to do with it.

Oh and I don't have any other friends to tag to do this because Maggie is the only one on here so the end!"

Anyways when I am home I cook and my mom loves it because she can stay later at work and not have to worry about dinner lol.  I made Rachel Rays Not-sanga veggie pasta tonight lol.  It was scrumptious and for dessert I made these really cute white chocloate dessert cups filled with chocolate mousey kind of stuff.  It was so fun- Maggie we wil have to make them sometime lol.

Tommarow I am chaparoning my mom's class's field trip to the Manassas Battelfield!  haha I feel bad for these kids, when I was in 5th grade we went to Gettysburg.  These poor kids get to go 5 min down the road to the same battlefield they have driven past probaly every day for their entire lives.  They get to go watch the lame movie and walk around- lol and suprisingly I think that I have never actually walked around at the Battelfield- seen the movie yes but usually me and my siblings would complain enough we wouldn't walk around.  Plus Thomas says there are some kind of bugs that eat you in the grass and thats why they can't do reenactments there- lol thats why they did a reenactment of the battle of manassas way up in winchester or wherever and not in manassas lol.

Anyways I suppose I should go to bed so I can get up early tommarow to go to the field trip lol.

5 days until Rockbridge!  I am so excited!! Although if Emily wasn't a small group leader it would be 5 days until Hawaii but Emily has to go to Rockbridge because shes on leadership which means we can't go crash her dads business trip to Hawaii how saddddd lol"

i want to drop out and marry keith urban and go on tour with him and maggie needs to marry chad so she can come on tour too.  so when we get sick of seeing the same concert over and over we can go out and have girls nights when we need a break from the guys.  Because why would we need to see a concert when we can have them give us our own? 

on second thought, maybe we need to be there so they don't act like pat green did last night and ask to see other girls boobs and get drunk lol, i don't think his wife was there because he deffinitly didn't act like that at keith urban because his wife was backstage with his daughter lol."

"event","So I just watched Gilmore Girls and decided that Adam Broody needs to make a reapearance for like 1 episode.  I think it would be pretty fabulous.  Lane just got married and it would be pretty funny if Dave aka Adam Brody came back and like shook things up a little- kind of like Anna is doing on the OC.  Anyways that would be fabulous as would Supernatural getting cancelled and Jared Padalecki aka Dean coming back on Gilmore Girls.

Anyways last night was fabulous.  After being 30 min late for iv because of dinner coming out at 7 when iv started lol.  After iv we had ice cream outside of the commons in the little plaza thing and some people played frisbee for a while then we went to Belle Isle to have a bonfire for EC's birthday.  It was fabulous but now I am dying.  The smoke, not taking allergy medicine until way later then normal, and the lack of sleep has all combined to make me feel like i'm dying.

So this morning woke up showered and went to Tropical Smoothie then drove home.  It took me foreverrrrrr because it was raining and nobody knows how to drive in the rain.  Ridiculous people driving 60 miles an hour in the left lane i wanted to run them overrrrrr.  Now I am watching Gilmore Girls and slowly dying the end!

Also in our newspaper box today was a cute little flyer from the girl up the street because she is selling lemonaide today and tommarow and it had a little map and everything it was so cute and my brother and sister just walked up to see if she was actually out there lol.  Anyways thats it Maggie you have to tell me what is happening with your housing situation because I am dying over hereeeee"

Went to education class got my presentation over with so now I don't have to worry about anything else in that class except the final.

Went to Target to buy cotton balls and some belts but they were sold out of cotton balls?  and they had no cute belts, instead I bought nail polish remover that didn't require cotton balls and some more stuff thatI can't think of right now.

Came back and did homework until Emily Fisher showed up at like 6ish.  We decided to go to Taco Bell and see Syriana at the Byrd.  But then it started pouring rain.  So we decided to order in food and borrow a movie from the guys downstairs lol.

So we spent forever looking though all the menus we have and decided to order from Sahara, it was scrumptious.  I got a Greek Salad and a Gyro and fried mushrooms and baklava.  hahha yes a lot of food and half of it is sitting in my refrigerator waiting to be eaten for dinner tonight.  Then we watched the Brothers Grimm with goregous Matt Damon and Heath Ledger who does not look so gorgeous in this movie because of his facial hair and glasses and lack of that long curly beautiful hair that makes him gorgeous to being with.  So we did that and watched the thunderstorm and it was fun fun.

"event","Okay so I was taking this political survey thing today and this is something that I just thought of that makes me kind of mad.

So when Hotel Rwanda came out everyone was like omg, how could that happen? how could the United States let that happen?   Why didn't we do anything?

But in Iraq there were similar things going on and now people are like why can't the United States mind their own business?  Why are we over there?  What are we doing?

Well you can't have it both ways, you have to make up your mind.  You can't be like oh the US should help and make sure people aren't being murdered and tortured in other countries and then be like don't send our troops overseas to help out.  The only difference is now there is a lable on it.  The US doesn't only send troops out to fight people, they send them out to help people.  If the us wasn't in Iraq all the people would be living in fear every day that they might be taken away by the government because they accidently said something bad about the government or some other reason.  The US along with the UN and Great Britian have helped to get rid of that opressing governemnt and are now helping the Iraquis set up a new one where they don't have to live in fear every day.  As part of that they need troops over there to help keep order until the new governemnt is established and recognized by the people.  So basically you can't be like oh lets spread world peace and help everyone have freedom in all countries and then be like I hate the president and I hate this war because you can't have it both ways."

And I must pack for Spring Break which officially started today, I was planning on heading home tommarow but now I probably won't make it back until Saturday.

I can't go to the doctor because I am a part-time student at VCU and therefore didn't pay the health fee and can't go to the clinic.  I could go to a doctor and use my parents insurance but I know absolutly nothing about the doctors in Richmond and have no idea where to go.

Whoaaa they are playing like a remix of Somebody Like You on 93.1, interesting lol, the guitar part is like different.  Actually I think this is the remix for How to Loose A Guy in 10 Days, I forgot that Keith like redid it so it was less banjo and more guitar or something lol

haha now he's singing about the running in circles and that reminded me of me and Maggie driving aroudn the traffic circle listening to that.  I told my parents that when they came down and they laughed at me.

Spring Break is next week-yay- but that means I have a test in all my classes this week so I have tons of reading and studying to do boo.

The housing situation is not looking good.  If we do get a house it will probably be in Orgeon Hill like 2 blocks behind Ashley.  It would be me and Joy and somebody else because Emily says she won't live over there and Ainsley is living with Emily and this is only a 3 bedroom so it wouldn't be all 4 of us.  But it has a fenced in back yard- perfect for a cute little dog which me and Joy decided we would get if we had that house- we are going to rescue a little fluffy dog from the shelter!!!  yay!"

Remax decided to send us a letter today saying that we have to notify them by next week if we are renewing our lease or not.  My dad's not coming down until the weekend after that to look at houses.  Way to go Remax for giving us a week to make a major decision that could leave us homeless lol.

So we probably aren't renewing our lease.  I really am not a fan of this apartment.  If my dad doesn't buy a house I would rather get an apartment somewhere else but Joy likes it here.  Either way I think we aren't because we might move into the Harrison house because like everyone is graduating except Brittany that lives there.  Just not sure how that would work because there are a bunch of people that want to live there and I'm not sharing a room.

Going home this weekend and I get to see my kitties and my puppy!!!!!  Yay!!!"

"event","Keith was amazing as expected.  Kind of dissapointed he didn't sing God's Been Good to Me and once again sang Blue Jeans on the back stage.  We didn't get on stage for You Look Good in My Shirt and we didn't get to see him after coming out on his bus.  But we did get to meet and talk to all the bad members.  Chad is sooo gorgeous and seems like the sweetest person in the world and Chris is really nice too- Jerry kind of ignored us and was talking to some girl that he hung out with in Amsterdam or something, I don't know lol.  Anyways end up droving back to Richmond because we couldn't get a hotel because we weren't 21, the one hotel that would let us stay there had some really sketchy guy chasing after our car lol.

This weekend was good.  It started Thursday with tanning with Ashley and Emily.  Then to Ashley's for dinner with Emily, Joy, and Amber- Joy's friend from her department.  Then we went to IV and then came back and watched ER then recorded OC.

Friday I went and visited my kids at work.  Then went to Casa Grande with Emily Fisher, Emily Reijmers and their friend Cathrine.  Then me and the Emily's went tanning and then we watched In Her Shoes which was so cute.  Hung out with Claire and Merril for a little then me and Maggie went to Wal-Mart at 1 in the morning to get poster board for Keith and then drove up and down Broad stopping at all the open CVS, Wal-Greens, and Rite-Aids in search of Cadbury eggs- unsuccesfully.

Saturday was shopping with the Emily's, Maggie, and Ashley.  Tried on bathing suites for Flordia because I think I'm going on Spring Break with IV.  Bought the cutest pair of shoes ever!  Ate at Tropical Smoothie and Taco Bell and made truffles yum yum.  Went to the Rite-Aid on campus and found cadburr eggs- yay!!!!

Today went to West End Pres with Emily Fisher for church then went to Shafer for the second time in 2 days- more then the entire year lol.  Came back and studied then went to Targey/Wal-Mart and finally bought poster stuff.  Then came back and made the poster which is soooooo cute- I will take pictures Thursday- and watched Extreme Home Makeover, Desperate Housewives and my new favorite- Grey's Anatomy which was soooo intense and stressful and I love that show sooooo much!

Keith on Thursday and its suppose to be 63 degrees in NC!!!!!  Yay!!!"

Went to education class and it is probably my favorite class this semester.

Went to Bakers Cruse with Rachel and Amanda who I love and haven't seen in forever!  We had crepes and they were yummy!

Made my chicken casserole thing for dinner.

Lost was a rerun but it was okay because I got to hang out with my roomies + Brian + Emily + Jason and then we watched project runway and it was fabulous.

Now I am here in my sauna of a room, it is ridiculously hot.  We think its because people are redoing the flooring in the halls so they have the door open and its messing up the thermostat so the heat is on like way too much.

Anyways 2 classes tommarow then going home for the Superbowl and to see my dad because hes coming back from the Phillipines."

"event","I have decided what my summer job should be.

I am going to be Keith Urban's trip planner.  I am going to hang out with him while he is on his tour bus and plan all sorts of fun things to do.  Like we can make baked tortellini and make a scrapbook and even play video games.

I will also plan side trips that we can go to on our way from one place to the next.  For example we can visit the Grand Canyon and whatever other fun places there are that you can visit on a fun roadtrip. Like next time he came to Richmond I would take him to Belle Isle.  I haven't worked out the details yet but as soon as they hire me I can start looking up stuff online.

And instead of having to go eat at Outback, I will have my own personal gorgeous Austrailian to cook ""outback"" food for me. 

By the end of his tour he will have fallen madley in love with me and will bring me out on stage at the last concert of the tour and propose to me and all the girls will be jealous.

We will then plan a huge wedding in DC somewhere, like at the White House, because if I am marrying Keith Urban I can get married anywhere I want to, and then we will go honeymooning in Europe and then stop in Australia on our way back to the US so he can visit some of his old mates from the outback.

Then we will come back to the states where he can record a new album full of love songs that he wrote about me."

I really don't know what to do next semester, as much as I hate Richmond and VCU I also really love my friends here and I would be really miss them if I transfered.

I don't want to go to school all it does is stress me out and I'm not learning anything.  I want to go home and sleep in my room and cuddle my kitty and watch Gilmore Girls (and Everwood and other WB shows) when it actually comes on, on my high def tv at my house.

I don't want to be woken up at 7 in the morning to creepy men fixing the windows and yelling to each other in some random language that was deffinitly not Spanish.

I don't want to live in a place where entire families are murdered in their basements and where guys are shot coming out of churches.

If I could bring all of IV + my carriage house girls to somewhere away from Richmond, I would not even hesitate 

I'm also afraid that if I transfer I will end up having way more schoolwork to do.  I'm already behind with my work and its only the second week of school, and VCU is really easy and I'm only taking 9 credits at VCU and 5 through NOVA but I haven't even started my NOVA class yet.

And the two people that I really want to talk to right now I can't because I don't have their phone numbers because my stupid phone died over break.  I facebook messaged Thomas and he basically said that between work and marine training he doesn't have any time to call me and I can't get Azu's phone number because he is the only one who had it but his phone died too.

The only good thing is that seeing Keith Urban from the 3rd row is less then a month away!"

So I am taking this foundations of education class to try that.  Dropped my meda graphics class because it was like 9-12:45 class and i really wanted to take a section of history in that time.  So I was able to drop the stupid 4-6:40 history section and for now this is what my schedule will be.  I might change my archeology class if a section in maggies Mayan whatever class opens up lol.  AnI don't know though.  I also want to study abroad this summer, there is one in Barbados which would be really fun, its like 6 credits in like Carribian culture, one is a hist class and one is a african cultrure class or something.  I think it would be fun but I probably can't go because I will be forced to stay at home and work and I will have no money to go."

I am soooo bored.  I am also mad- at the weather.  I am at home for winter break and it is liek 60 degrees outside.  I want it to snow.  I want to play in the snow and this is my only chance for that because it doesn't snow in Richmond.

I also want it to be at least cold enough so I can wear a scarf and hat because I have tons and they are cute.

I want to go to Casa Chimya but I have no friends to go with me.  Maggie is in Flordia and Thomas is in South Carolina and all my other friends from high school I really haven't talked to in like a year so I don't feel like trying to find them.

I was suppose to go skiing with like tommarow with a bunch of iv people but its like 60 degrees outside.

I have nothing to do for New Years Eve but at least I get to eat crab legs on New Years.

I worked with Maggie until 6:30 even though I usually don't work fridays but it was quite fun.  We watched Charlie Brown and the Great Pumpkin for a little but none of the kids were watching it so we turned it off.  Then they decorated pumpkins and did centers and then we went up and played in the gym like normal.

Then I came back and started to eat when Emily Fisher called me and told me she was downstairs at Merrils dogsitting her dog that she brought from home for the weekend while some people went to Ashland Berry Farm.  So I went down there and got to play with the puppy and hang out with Emily.  We ate pizza and watched tv and took the dog out every hourish like Merril said but that dog did not have to pee every hour lol.  Then we watched the Notebook- which we borrowed from Kip- why he has the notebook we don't know lol.  So Emily Reijmers came up and us 3 + the dog watched the notebook.

Then after that we came up to my apartment to eat ice cream (we stay in my apartment because we didn't have merrils keys and couldn't lock her fire escape door) then we went back down and hung out in Merrils apartment until they got home at like 2

 

Tonight is the Neewollah party!  Yay (that would be Halloween spelled backwards).  I am excited that Maggie and Thomas are coming hurrah!!  Anyways I must go shower and then pick up some last minute items for my costume!"

Maggie has mono so she is dying and couldn't come to West Virginia to go to my grandparents and see Thomas's reeneactment.

So I called my family to see if anyone wanted to go and my brother said he would go with me.  So Friday after class, I went and got a massage which was wonderful.  Then I went to Belle Isle with Emily Fisher and we climbed around on the rocks for a while and then I came back packed my bags and went home to get my brother.

The plan was to sleep at my house Friday night and then drive up to the reenactment and then to my grandparents Saturday after my brother was done with his fencing class. But he got back at like 1:45 and the battle started at 2:30 and it takes like an hour to get there and he still had to shower and pack.  So we decided to go to the one on Sunday instead.

So we drove up to my grandparents house and chilled with them Sat night and then on Sunday went to Thomas's reenactment.  It was really fun lol.  But we couldn't find Thomas but thats okay.  Then we drove back to my house and I ate dinner there and then got back down to VCU just in time to watch Desperate Housewives with my roomies + Brian lol.

So today I had class and now I have to go to work.  Tommarow after my mass comm, I am going to study for my other mass comm midterm at 3.  Maybe go thrift store shopping in search of a halloween costume- I am a 60s prom queen, maggie is 50s prom queen and emily fisher is 70s prom queen lol!  So I've got to find something to wear lol  Maybe I can use this as an excuse to go buy American Dreams on dvd- so i can look at what they are wearing for my haloween costume hahahaha.

Update is for: Brian Keenan
Update information: The NOLS office just spoke with the Keenan family and told 
them that even though they haven't physically spoken with  
the team, they know that the team is ahead of the game on  
their course.  They are past the area of the earthquake  
and mudslides and the senior team is covering the same  
course to make sure everything has gone as planned.  This  
senior team should know something for sure by tomorrow and  
by Friday they are to expect a call from Brian directly.   
2 of the team members are sick but they knew that Brian  
was fine.  There is no indication thus far of any damage  
to the team or even that they know that there has been an  
earthquake.  They are in the Nada Devi Area of the  
Himalaya Mountains now and somewhere in the Kinnaur  
Valley.  Brian is supposed to be going to Randihkett  
though, where there is some damage.  Some of this might  
sound questionable or vague but we should have a better  
understanding on Friday.  The Keenans are feeling much  
better about the situation since this call...even though  
they haven't had direct word from them yet...and  
appreciate all of our prayers."

"event","Well so I didn't go on Chapter Retreat because I had to stay here to study.

This will be my insane schedule next week

Monday- take physics test, econ, go straight to work for the full day, hopefully get out half an hour early to go to the CPR training for work so that I don't have to be sent other places when Sara has to leave early because she is the only one with CPR training and they have to switch people.  Anyways take the stupid class get home probably at like 11- shower and crash in bed because i will be exahsted

Tuesday- Mass Comm, my little break where I normally due spanish but will probably be studying for econ, my other Mass Comm class then straight from there to the second/ last day of CPR Training, once again probably get home after 11 and crash because I'm exhasted

Wed- physics (?) , econ, work, home at like 7 and study

Thursday- mass comm, work until 7, iv until 11ish

Friday- fail the econ test and come home and pack to go to West Virginia to stay at my grandparents and go to Thomas's reenactment for the weekend (hopefully study for my mass comm midterm at some point)

 

On top of all that my car has decided that it is being abused by driving out to past short pump 3 days of week and decided it wanted to die on me.  It smells like gas and I'm scared it will explode while i'm driving.  It started that on Thursday seemed to get better and I think its bad again.  And my windshield wipers which have always acted up today decided to not go down when they turned off- yes those of you who know my car know this is a normal occurance in the rain but what happened this time is i turned them off, parked the car, pushed them down- and they didn't go down- usually they do.  I went into Target and shopped came back out and turned the car on and they went right back up.  I got out of the car and pushed them down (usually they go back into place when this happens) and they didn't.  So I drove back to my apartment with my windshield wipers like this because it wasn't raining anymore and turned the car off and pushed them down and am letting my car rest.  Tommarow I will try to get them to go down angain and if they don't I have to find time to take my car in to get fixed soon.  So I can see out my window and so my car doesn't explode while I'm driving.

So that means I will probably have to miss work one day because I will be without a car/ waiting for them to fix my car.  And I might need someone who loves me a lot to pick me up at someplace if i have to drop my car off and leave it with them.

And I'm getting sick again and my i'm breaking out because i'm too stresseddddddddddd"

I have too much to do!

Chapter Retreat this weekend, Physics test monday, Econ test next Friday, and Mass Comm midterm the next tuesday, and the other mass comm midterm the next tuesday.

That on top of Chapter Retreat this weekend, and Thoams's reenactment next weekend= no time for me to study

I really think I should stay home this weekend and not go on Chapter Retreat and study but I really want to go on Chapter Retreat.

In other news tonight we had a taco mixer with all the Tuesday night small groups, it was quite fun.

Also as of not I am going to put this same entry up on my xanga and my live journal because Maggie is the only one who really cares and reads this and she deserted xanga but I like xanga better and its prettier so I am going to keep writing on there."

There was a mouse in my pool sitting on the floaty thing on the vaccum cord it was gross, I called my dad and he was like scoop it out with the net.  I tried and then it swam into the filter and so I poked a noodle into the filter since the net wouldn't fit in there then it swam out and I finally got it out.  It was gross I wanted to go get my kitties to go chase it lol but they are fat and lazy and would rather sleep then chase a mouse.

That was my wonderful entry- the end!"

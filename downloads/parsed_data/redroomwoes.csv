Then we went by Laurie's house and screamed ""FUCK YOU, BITCH!!!!!""  That was a riot, lol.

Went to Randolph and played on the playground for a while, did some pull ups and pole dancing... poor Joe.  He, uh, got hurt.  Then we dropped everyone off and went home.  It was fun.  Oh, yeah, we switched our shirts back under a big light and, well, yeah, it was interesting.  (""I could just walk over here... and turn around..."" haha)

Tonight, went to a pool hall with Jeff and Joe.  Played no pool there, but I watched, learned, and criticized.  Went back to Joe's house, and he showed me how to play pool, you know, where 54 people weren't watching.  Well, not that everyone would watch me, but they were there!  And you know what?  Tonight was the first time I can remember ever in my whole life thinking to myself, ""God, it's great to be alive!""  Wonderful, wonderful night.  Oh yeah, and then he kissed me.  :-D  Nygh!  Want... to... be... there!  Need... time... machine!

As I got out of the car, Joe said ""I love you"" again, and it's so nice.  Because I know 'the story and history'... Anyway, it means a lot that he says it.

"event","Guess what?  Joe said he loves me.  :-D

Well, I said it first.

I had a dream Wednesday night that I was in a doctor's office and I don't really know what happened, but I found out Casey's mom died, and then Bill and Joanne were there.  And so was Casey's dad.  So Bill said, ""Mr. Satchfield, you, me, and Chuck are the only ones left.""  Meaning Casey died!  Then there was some secret passageway in the school (which the doctor's office now was...) and I somehow knew that Joe had died!  I woke up and I was crying 'cause, in my dream, my only regret was that I didn't tell him I loved him.

So morning comes and I'm at school and I told Joanne, and she told me I had to tell him, which I knew I did, and when he was coming down the hall, I walked to him and told him I needed to talk to him.  So we went down the music hall and I told him my dream and I ended with ""and my only regret was that I didn't tell you... I loved you.""  so he goes, ""What does that mean?"" and I said ""That I do!"" and we hugged and he said he's starting to feel that way.  I didn't think he would say he loved me, 'cause of Laurie and everything, but I just had to get it out!  So then Friday morning I got the sweetest e-mail that I've ever read, and at the end he said he loved me too.  But he actually said it Friday night when we went out to Jon's.  Without LAUREN OR ASHLEIGH!  Then we watched Top Gun (sorry for that pause, had to go...) which Joe has never seen.  But anyways, we were laying on the couch and he was laying on my chest and he goes ""I could just listen to your heartbeat.""  ::whimper:: I could have died!  It was so cute.  Then I went to sleep smiling...  After he left that is.  Haha, but yeah, it was great.  I think I'm gonna go read the e-mail again.  ::sigh:: Love is great."

Omg, Jeff is my hero.  He likes country music!  He was talking about how he can go from rock, to rap, to country, and he sang 'samples' of songs, and the country song was ""Don't Take the Girl"", and I was like ""I LOVE THAT SONG!!!""  I really do.  Johnny's daddy, was takin him fishing... haha, good song.

omg, I threw a strike and Joe ran up and picked me up and twirled me around... it scared me so bad!  Haha, but it was fun.  I actually got a score of 123, or something, which beat both of them, the second game.  Granted they weren't trying... but still.  It was great.

Today, I spent most of the day with Joe.  

We were really good friends before.  We still are.  We can talk for hours and hours.  We can sit through a movie and not see all of it 'cause we're too busy talking.  We've done it so many times already.
We have fun doin' simple things.  We were wrapping presents and had the best time ever.
Our first date wasn't that 'so nervous you can't eat'.  We went to Olga's and went Christmas shopping.
He can make me laugh by just looking my way.
It seems like some songs are written for us 'cause he's said stuff like that!  Things like I just looked ""so damn cute"" where in the song ""she just looked so darn cute"".  Or in the same song, he talks about his sleeping wife looking ""so much like an angel"" and he said I look like an angel.  And he said he can imagine me sleeping like an angel.  And I know he's never heard that song before!
I want to run to him and hug him when I see him.
I never liked it when anyone said I looked cute, but coming from him, I love it!!
My smile... is 'just beyond him'. 
Oh, and I'm a good kisser ;-)  Our first real kiss was tonight.  And it WAS good.
I went out to dinner tonight with him and his parents, and it was fun!  It really was!  His parents like me and I like them.  And he likes them and his sister too!  Oh, and his dad and my mom not only went to the same high school, but they lived back to back... not even a street away!  He used to steal cherries from my grandma's tree!  How is that for meant to be?  haha

It's different with him.  I like it.  It's right.  It's good with him.  In fact, it's great.  Maybe better.

yeah, he's better than great."

Plan C is to get Joe to come up to Laurel Park and have lunch with me when I'm taking a break from all the kids.  Then maybe I can tell him there... Although I think it will just most likely lead to plan D.  Woah, I hope I don't have to make it to Z.  Or double letters... that wouldn't be good.  Plan D will be telling him at the concert.

Yeah, well, it's good he didn't come.  Aside from the fact that he's a flaming imbecile (c/o Jessica), it's good he didn't show up.  Joe came in his place, remember?  Yeah, well, he did.  Ever since him and Laurie (that evil, little, cheating, whor... woah!  Goin' to far... ahem!) broke up, we've been hanging out a lot.  Which I like...  :-]  We're going to a concert where he is going to tell me 'something' (which I already know, but SHH!).

BUT!  of course!  Something has to ruin it all!  My little obsession with Adam!  Don't read this wrong, I have nothing for Adam except that he's my bitch.  (EG:  Adam?  Will you pick up my books?  Adam?  Will you put this in your locker?  Adam? ... Can you say wha-ch! {that's a whip cracking, in case you didn't get that...})  Yeah, but Joe thinks I LIKE Adam!  Uh, NO!  I wanna be like, ""Joe, no.  He's my bitch.""  lol  I can't believe Joe thinks I like him!  I'm the only one of us 3 girls that hasn't!  But I have a plan that will be completed today...

Aaron and Kyle, but I want Kyle.  Wait, was it Eric or Aaron?  Oh, I can't remember...  There was a cousin there too, but nobody cares about him.  Hahaha... It all started when we were fundraising.  Me and Jess saw them playing soccer with flippers on, and we got 10 bucks from their house.  We finished the street and went back.  We started talking to them and they asked for our numbers.  OMG!  But they live by Chelsea, which is an hour away.  They're here every weekend, though.  We got in trouble for not being where we were supposed to meet up at the right time, but I don't care!  OMG, I'm so excited.  I really want them to call.  OMG!  Uh oh... I'm screwed...  You know what?  I can't tell twins apart!  But maybe I'll be able to now... Kyle WAS hotter... just a little.  :-)"

Now:  The movie ""The Princess Bride"" makes me want to cry.  I think I will.  I don't know why, it just does.  That song during the credits... I just, no... I need to stop.

Today:  Greenhouse.  Everybody was tired.  It's a headache day.  Or a backache day... I'm going to get x-rays tomorrow on my back.  I wonder what's wrong with me.  Well, a lot.

Yesterday/Saturday:  Went up north.  Quickly found out I am totally and utterly OBSESSED with Adam.  He couldn't go up north with me and Casey and Ash, so we found ways to think of him...  That dirty b*****d.  Going to party instead of go with me up north...  Anyway...

Halloween:  Oh, yeah.  He decided not to go Trick or treating either...  Evil child.  But Joe went.  Joe Fava.  He came over and was like ""Wanna play catch?"" so we played catch and I asked him if he wanted to go trick or treating.  With a little coaxing he did, so it's all good.  I felt so special!  We had a lot of fun.  Everyone liked Joe.

Hm... oh, yeah, and Adam's been to Canada, but we won't go there.  That topic, I mean.  

DSI field trip was fun, but I'm still behind on everything in school.  That was like 2 weeks ago!  I think I can kill Dave.  

Went to the Eagles concert... very awesome.  I almost fell asleep, however, because I had been up since 4 that morning.  Went to Matchbox 20 too.  Fountains of Wayne opened (Stacies Mom).  Some VERY hot guys were sitting next to me and I wanted to watch them instead of Rob Thomas.. lol  Next is Alan Jackson!  HEHE!

Ok, well, I think I'm done.  I just have to not think of that storybook story song... I think I'll cry.  It's a crying day.  Yucky and rainy.  Whatever..."

"event","Did you know Adam has never flown a kite before?  Well, now you do.  And now he has!!  We all went kite-flying yesterday, and he was a natural... lol.  He has also never been to Canada.  We're working on that.  we're also working on going to a club next month when he gets his license.  Lord help me... I'm going to have to learn how to dance, although he says that he's going to teach me.  Dancing.  With Adam.  That's like saying i+i.  Two imaginary things...  Let's just hope it doesn't turn into i^2, 'cause that would not be imaginary anymore...

Speaking of math, I'm going to do that PSAT in John Glenn today.  Oh, goody, I get to be a loner...  I took the practice PSAT, aka PPSAT.  Haha, letters... ha.  Ha.  ::AHEM!::  I'm done.

Yeah so my to do list looks something like this:
*Take Adam to Canada.  (No, we will not make fake ID's and drink!)
*Go clubbin'.  Wow, that sounds SO bad coming from me!
*Learn to dance.  If that's what it's called.
*Take PSAT.  
*Dye my hair red with Kool-Ade... CHECK!  Thanks Lauren!

Oh!  We're going to the DSI tomorrow!  I can't wait for that!  They have a new exhibit on the brain which should be cool.  Haha, listen to me... I'm such a dork.  But at least I'm a happy dork.

Speaking of happy, since I started hanging out with Casey and Kitty and Adam (which should be Kitty&Adam and Casey, seeing as K&A are a couple now, Adam finally asked her out!) I've been in a good mood.  It's like perpetual motion, only of good mood-yness.  lol

Wow, It's late/early, so I should go.  I need to drop something off at Stevenson before I go to Westland."

Yesterday was my unofficial part two birthday party.  The first part was John's with Lauren and Ashleigh and my family.  This part was Adam, Casey, Ashleigh and my parents at the drive in, or drive through, as Adam called it.  Can you believe Adam and Casey had never been to a drive in??  Crazy children...  But it was cold!  Well, Adam didn't think so... even though he had my sweatshirt on.  haha.  We were outside on a blanket next to the van with my parents in it 'cause you can't see the screen from the back seat.  It was a lot of fun.  We saw Freaky Friday and Pirates of the Caribbean.  During intermission, we had an animal cracker fight.  But omg was it COLD!!!  After we dropped Ashleigh off, I didn't even move 'cause Adam was keeping me warm just because I was next to him... hahaha  (Casey fell asleep on him...)  Anyway, it was a ton of fun.  Part three is gonna be Lauren, Jessica, and Michelle at the drive in, I hope."

"event","Holy crap I feel awesome!  I guess my 'rents are awesome!  They were talking about going to an Alan Jackson concert with their friends.  So I'm like ""I wanna go!""  so they got me a ticket!  Then my mom went online and was like ""Hey, the Eagles are coming to the palace"" so I'm like ""I WANNA GO!""  So we're going to the Eagles concert!!!!  THEN!  She's at Ticketmaster again and goes ""Hey, Matchbox 20's coming to the palace!""  so we got tickets to THAT!  Omg, and I think I'm convincing them to let me go to the Maroon 5 concert!!!!  HOLY SHIT IS THIS AWESOME!!!!  Three maybe 4 concerts in 2 months!  And they're all totally amazing bands!  Omg, I'm gonna die... 

Oh, and on another note... Adam and Casey are coming over and we're gonna have a moive marathon.  I think they are my new best friends.  ('cept Ash!)  OMG!!!!!!!  ADAM GAVE ME A ROSE!!!!!  And he gave Casey and Kitty one too.  It's all because I wanted him to come to the car show with me!  (He won $324 in 50/50 raffle.)  So yeah...  I didn't put the rose down the entire night...  Awe, I felt/feel so special... lol

And I made home-made cinnamon roll this morning!  They smelled so good!  I love to cook with my new mixer."

That is, if you have clothes you want to swap.  It's from 6-11, so be there or be square!  Just wanna get the word out..."

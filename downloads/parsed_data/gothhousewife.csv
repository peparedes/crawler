So many stories flying around, born from the mouths of the ever growing circle. It will all be set right when the potheads meet tonight; with some minor alterations. My, my. Something seems to be missing...something or someone. Perhaps I should travel to the puppet burn ward, and visit my peers."

There's no earthly way of knowing,
Which direction we are going.
There's no knowing where we are rowing, 
or which way the river's flowing.
Is it raining?
Is it snowing?
Is a hurricane a-blowing? 
Bleh! 
Not a speck of light is showing,
So the danger must be growing.
Are the fires of hell a glowing?
Is the grisly reaper mowing?
Yes! The danger must be growing,
For the rowers keep on rowing.
And they're certainly not showing,
Any signs that they are slowing! </i>

<b>Stop the boat.</b>

I suppose I should be grateful; I learned to swim."

It's a pity I'm not very appreciative. 
And not designed to make any sense."

You're such a strange girl
I think you come from another world
You're such a strange girl
I really don't understand a word
You're such a strange girl
I'd like to shake you around and around
You're such a strange girl
I'd like
To turn you
All upside down

You're such a
Strange girl
The way you look like you do
You're such a strange girl
I want
To be with you

I think I'm falling
I think I'm falling in
I think I'm falling in love with you
With you"

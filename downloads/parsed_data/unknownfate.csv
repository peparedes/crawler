<P>Havent updated in awhile.&nbsp; Recently things have been good.&nbsp; I dont even know why I type in this thing.&nbsp; Ive been on this site for along time (off and on for the past 4 years. with like 3 diff names).&nbsp; I guess its nice to sit online, listen to music, and talk write shit about your life.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Anyways tonight, Charlie and myself hung out.&nbsp; Got some Jomoccah(spelling??) shakes from Arbys, went to CVS, then to Jims.&nbsp; Also he let me borrow his Hellfest 2002 DVD.&nbsp; The only thing I want to watch again was the Bane footage of ""Can we start again"".&nbsp; AMAZING.&nbsp; Too bad Hellfest is going&nbsp; downhill.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Latley Ive been on a Jomoccah shake craze.&nbsp; </P>
<P>So I got a new plan to wake up in the morning.&nbsp; Remember when you were younger how you would wake up, watch cartoons, eat cereal, than go to school.&nbsp; Well Im going to start doing that again.&nbsp;The problem is that&nbsp; <STRONG><U>THERE IS NO FUCKING GOOD MORNING CARTOONS ANYMORE.&nbsp;&nbsp;</U></STRONG>&nbsp; I swear to god, all the cartoons suck nowadays. </P>
<P>So Im going to download ALL the <STRONG><U>LEGEND OF ZELDA, and SUPER MARIO 3 / SUPER MARIO SUPER SHOW CARTOONS.&nbsp;</U></STRONG>&nbsp; So heres going to be my new schedule:</P>
<P>4:50 - Wake up, workout!</P>
<P>5:50 - Shower, get dressed, and get cereal ready!</P>
<P>6:00 - Watch my cartoons, and eat some cereal. Until 7:00</P>
<P>7:00 - Go to school.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>This is a great plan!</P>"

"event","this weekend didnt go too good. friday and saturday nothing special happened. and sunday was my birthday. 

saturday morning i woke up witha stuffy nose, and my throat was full of flem and shit. it was bad. it got worse on sunday. i didnt do anything at all on my b-day. but my friend chris came over.

so yea, im 17 now. i feel so old. for some reason i know look at life differently. like i dont sweat the small shit like i used too. i guess i know realize that lifes too short to worry about what everyone thinks of you, and how you look. its really hard to explain. time has gone by soo fast. it seems like just yesterday i was 14, and playing football with all my friends in my old neighborhood. i still feel like im 14 or 15. ever since i moved, right before high school i havent been myself. i felt alone, since i had to make new friends, and get used to a new area. 

so starting today, im going to look at things differently. hopefully everythign will go well."

"event","yesterday i went to the thursday concert with bre. nobody else could make it. anyways the concert was alot of fun but was too packed. clutch cargos was fucking packed. they seriously let too many people in. 

planes mistaken for stars, and from autumn to ashes were really good, esp FATA. onelinedrawing put on a good, but mellow show. the lead singer jonah (sp?) ended up playig by himself and after the show he was selling merchandise, and talking to fans which was really cool. thursday ended up playing a longer than usual, because theyre not going to be touring for awhile. the new song they put out isnt bad. i cant wait to see onelinedrawing again. if you havent heard of them, you should definitly check them out.

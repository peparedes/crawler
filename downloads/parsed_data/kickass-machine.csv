"event","This class is soooooo tiresome. If I could just watch the videos and then take a test about each instead of having to write paper on top of paper on top of paper I wouldn't be behind. I would probably have worked ahead if I could have done it that way, because the vidoes and audios are all very interesting. I just hate watching them when I know I'm going to have to write some horrible paper on them. It sucks. God I hope I pass this class. I really don't want to have to take this class again. Ugh.&nbsp;


Amusement Park tomorrow. . . . . Fun Fun. Gonna ride the kiddie coasters with my neices. I think Megan's my favorite. I wish her mom wasn't so over protective, so I could actually hang out with her and do cool stuff. Someday I'll help her guage her ears out, and we'll go to rock concerts, me and Megan and Kayla, and it will be cool."

I was so uncomfortable. I found out that he's dating some girl that's younger than me. That feels really good to know. I kept trying to get away from him and get back to my work, because the whole situation was just soooo akward and uncomfortable. Every time I took a step away he would say something wierd and want to hug me again. Ugh. When I finally did get back down here to the computer he came in to tell me that he wants to get on the internet when I'm done, but instead he told me&nbsp;that if he goes to Iraq and dies that I'll need to cancel all of his internet stuff. Then he wanted a lighter so he could go to the lake and set off bottle rockets, fell UP the stairs, rolled across the living room floor spilling Hot Damn as he went, and babbled on about if he's not back in fifteen minutes to call the ATF or something, I don't know. Soooo wierd, and akward, and uncomfortable. I think I'm going to try to go to bed before he gets back so I won't have to talk to him again tonight. . I really hope he doesn't remember any of this tomorrow."

I'm still too sore from my surgery to do that much walking in the hot sun. Even going up there for field day took a lot out of me. Sucks. I gave her a camera so she can take lots of pictures.

I went in for a diagnostic laproscopy, and once they got in there they found out my appendix was bad and had to go. So they pulled it out through my belly button. I am in so much fucking pain right now. But I got to see the pictures they took inside my body, and that was awesome. I asked for copies to show everybody, and the doctor said he would make me some, but I guess he forgot. I'll keep bugging him. my appendix looked real bad. All swollen and red. And there was this huge blood vessel on it that looked like a big piece of red rope. That's what was causing all that pain in my abdomen. Now hopefully when I stop hurting I'll really stop hurting."

"event","Kayla's first day of school was on Wednesday. We went in early so she could get familiar with her classroom before the other kids got there. Once the other kids arrived and class started I tried to get her involved, but she was hesitant. She had a couple minor freakouts during circle time, where she would run back and hide in the corner. I hugged her and talked to her and got her calmed down. Then we went back to the circle, but we didn't sit in the cirlce. We just sat back and watched what the rest of the class was doing. We watched them take roll, and we watched show-and-tell. After show-and-tell was over it was lunch time. The TA helped Kayla and shoewd her the lunch routine. Wash your hands, take your tray, take a napkin, and your silverware, and find a seat. I sat with Kayla through lunch and ate together. We sat at a table with Miss Heather, her teacher, and she explained the classroom rules and routine to us. After lunch I decided that Kayla should get used being in class without me being there, so I got ready to leave. When she realized that I was really leaving she had a major freak out./ She was screaming and crying ""Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!"" and was&nbsp; clinging tight to me. She wouldn't let me go. The teacher actually had to pull her off from me. It broke my heart, but she had to learn. So I left. I called the school a little bit later to check on her and the TA told me that she was doing great. She calmed right down shortly after I left. So Day One went ok. Yesterday she was really excited to go to school. She picked out her show-and-tell, and packed her backpack by herself. We went to school, and I helped her find her locker and put her stuff in it. She took her show-and-tell to the circle. She sat in the circle with her class, and did her show-and-tell when it was her turn (she brought her purple purse with her big Charlie Brown and her little Charlie Brown inside). Then she showed me what she needs to do to get ready for lunch. I got her settled in at a table with Miss Lacey, the TA, and then I left. She didn't cry at all that time, and when I went back to pick her up at three her teacher told me she had a wonderful day, and that she was making lots of friends at school. She was my big brave girl, and didn't cry at all yesterday. I am so proud of my big girl, going to school. She doesn't have school on Fridays. Next week she'll only go on Monday, because she's goingon vacation with my mom, which I am extremely happy about because it gives me and David five solid dys together. I just hope that we don't have to go through all the crying and adjusting again at school once she comes back from Missouri.&nbsp;


Yesterday I hung up Kayla's school lunch calander on the fridge with magnets, and I got all teary eyed with happiness and pride. I'm so proud of her.&nbsp;

"event","Kayla's Unicorn needs open heart surgery. His battery has died. We've scheduled the OR for tomorrow morning. She's going to be my intern on this one. She's really excited about the chance to scrub in and assist.&nbsp;<br /><br />We've been watching a LOT of Grey's Anatomy together lately.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Yesterday wasn't quite as bad as I thought it would be. They just did a biopsy to find out how far it's progressed. I have another appointment in two weeks to find out the results and discuss how we want to proceed. As if I had much of a choice, really.&nbsp;<br /><br />The really shitty part about yesterday was my psychotic mother calling me and fucking up my entire night.<br /><br />She tried to take my car keys so I couldn't drive over to David's anymore. I wouldn't give them to her, so she has parked her car over behind mine to block me in so I can't go anywhere. If the swingset wasn't in my way I'd just do a fucking U-turn right through the front yard. Fuck that. And she threatened to call the police and report the car stollen if I try to drive anywhere, and press charges for grand theft or some shit. She wants me in jail. Why, I don't know. She did the same thing to my brother. Actually did have him sent to jail. What kind of a mother does that shit? I don't go out every single night and get totally wasted and drive home after she was supposed to be at work in the morning and then pass out and neglect my child all day every day. NO. I go out once a week to my boyfriend's house and sit on the couch and watch television all night. And I stay out late because, only being able to see him once a week, I would like to spend as much time with him as I can, <em>when</em> I can. And then I come home and get what sleep I can, and then take goddamned good care of my child all day, every day.&nbsp;<br /><br />I said to her, I can't believe you would actually do that to your child (try to get me put in jail). How fucking heartless. And she said to me, well I can't believe you would do the things that you do to your child. What? Like what??? Cook her three square meals a day and fix her snacks? Watch kids shows and movies with her? Play games with her? Read stories to her? Go for walks in the snow together? And give her her baths, make sure her nails are clipped and her ears are cleaned, and make sure she brushes her teeth every day, and get her jammies on her at night, and read to her, and tuck her in??? Those are her sure signs of neglect by a cold and unfeeling mother who would rather have a boyfriend than a child. <em>Plus</em>, I do the cleaning around here, the laundry, the dishes. AND I BAKE!!! I bake cookies, and cupcakes, and blueberry muffins in the morning. And Kayla helps me and I teach her things about counting and math and fractions and following directions while we read the recipes together. Yeah, FUCK YEAH, I'm a horrible fucking mother. God I hate being a mother. God I hate my child. RIGHT.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Fuck. I hate my mother.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />I need to get the fuck out of this house."

Man, I used to watch that when I was little tiny. It's so wierd that Kayla is watching it too. It's so wierd to even think that that show is like twenty some years old. Really dates my childhood. Makes me feel older.&nbsp;

I have an infected cuticle on my index finger on my right hand. It's swollen up huge and hurts really bad, and has a big bandaid on it, and it 's really hard to type.&nbsp;

We're getting married someday, donchya know.&nbsp;

Renee Danielle Bolema. Whaddya think of that?

Renee Danielle Chartrand-Bolema.&nbsp;
Renee Bolema.&nbsp;
Renee Chartrand-Bolema.&nbsp;



Which sounds better?

I'm leaning towards just Bolema, but Kayla's last name is Chartrand, and I wanted to kind of tie things together. You know, Kayla Chartrand, David Bolema, Renee Chartrand-Bolema. I'd have the connecting name and tie everybody together.&nbsp;

Whatever. I've got some more time to think about it. Maybe she'll be like seventeen when we get married like I was when my mom remarried and she'll understand us having different last names.&nbsp;

But I really don't want to have to wait fourteen years to get married."

"event","So, I've been feeling really down lately. I just lay in bed all day, don't get dressed or brush my hair. It's a pretty&nbsp;grizzly sight. .&nbsp; 

Anyway, I finally decided to leave the house to get candy so I could go home and lay in bed all day eating candy. I went to Walgreens and ran into Mike Valley. I looked completely like shit, no makeup, wearing glasses, bushy brows because I haven't plucked them in weeks, and ran into super-hot-used-to-be-a-really-good-friend-former-junior-year-of-highschool-crush Mike Valley.&nbsp; 

We used to hand out during science class all&nbsp;the time. We'd sit in the lab and hang out and I'd try to be all super cool, and I used to try really hard to look really hot, and I thought maybe I had a chance with him. He was so cute, really skinny and pale, always dressed really nice and had his hair styled nice, had really good taste in clothes and music, and he was really incredibly smart, and funny. He was great.&nbsp; 

I got up the guts to ask him out one day, and he turned me down flat. He was really nice about it. He told me that I was a really sweet girl, and that any guy would be lucky to have me, but I'm just not his type. Well, I thought, whatever. I tried.&nbsp; 

That was kind of the end of our friendship. Everything became very awkward after that.&nbsp; 



Turns out he was gay. I thought he was just a little effeminate, but nope. Gay.&nbsp; 

I guess I was just oblivious.&nbsp; 

And I know it doesn't really matter if I looked good or bad when I ran into him today, because it's not like he would think ""Oh man, she's gorgeous! Why didn't I go out with her in highschool? I was such an idiot!"" Because he's gay. But I at least wanted him to have a good impression of me if we were ever to meet again. Now he thinks I'm just one of these horrible looking Holton trash whores. A nobody, going nowhere, stuck. And fucking ugly to boot.&nbsp; 

Goddamnit.&nbsp; 

Now I'm going to have to get all glammed up and go to Walgreens and get some film developed or something. And chat with him for a minute and tell him all these lies about what I'm doing with my life, so he won't think I'm just a trashy Holton piece of shit."

And tomorrow my mom and sis-in-law are taking ALL of the kids to yet another mall, while my brother and I go cruising in his miata to a kickass resale record shop to fill our little hearts with joy buying incredible music at very low prices. And then we get to come home and listen to what we found turned up very loud because there will be no children here or uptight conservative prudes here to complain about the kind of music we listen to. I love that my brother has such great taste in music. Between him and David I am discovering new music I would have never been aware of otherwise, and I thank them both, the two loves of my life, for opening my eyes. I wish I could get the two of them together sometime. I know they would have so much in common, and they'd get along great. It would be really funny to just sit and listen to them have a conversation. They're both these awkward techy engineer types who listen to the same kind of music. Get them in a room together and extreme awkward cuteness would abound. I love those two. Especially David. And especially Dan. But especially David.

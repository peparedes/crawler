"event","After yet another great game, the Red Wings beat the Penguins 3-2 and won their 11th Stanley Cup! The last 3 minutes of the were very exciting since the Penguins nearly tied the game again at very last second! This series is going down as one of the great series in NHL history. The Penguins played a great game and a great series and I know that they will win the Stanley Cup within the next five seasons. I will root for them as long as they do not play Detroit or Philly.

I was really impressed with the fact that the Penguins fans stayed for the presentation of Conn Smythe trophy and the Stanley Cup. That says a lot about how classy Penguins fans are.

History was made today when Nicolas Lidstrom became the first European captain&nbsp; to win the Stanley Cup. Also, Daniel Cleary became the first player from the Canadian province of Newfoundland to win the cup. Henrik Zetterberg was named the MVP of the Stanley Cup Finals and won the Conn Smythe."

"event","<font size=""2""> I have bad news, everyone. At noon today my campus was hit with a virus. It deleted user profiles and key files that the operating system needs to be able to boot up. I was affected and, for now, my laptop is a useless paperweight. All my files are gone and I am trying to recover them. I do not know when my laptop will be fixed. Our IT department is swamped right now and it is going at least a week to get several thousand laptops, desktops, and servers working again.<br /><br />I hope that the person whom did this is found and fired or expelled and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. This attack affected the lives of several thousand students, faculty, and staff. It brought the university to screeching halt since the computer network went down.<br /><br />The moral of this story: Back up your data!</font>"

I am taking Microprocessors, Electronics, and Advanced Digital Electronics.  Each of these courses has an accompanying laboratory course that I am also taking.  I bought my textbooks yesterday.  I paid almost $300 for two textbooks.  Needless to say, I was not too pleased.

On positive note, I finally completed Diablo II: Lord of Destruction today.  I am absolutely ecstatic to have finally completed the game.  I finished the game with a level 37 Druid.  I am glad that I did complete the game before the start of the fall term so that I can focus on my course work"

"event","Highlights from last week:

On Monday, I had a scary experience. I was driving on my way to work in downpour.  As I get to the end of the ramp from I-96 eastbound to M-39 northbound, I drive through standing water and suddenly the battery warning light comes on and I feel the steering wheel stiffen.  I knew I had lost power steering.  Seconds later, as I complete the merge onto M-39 northbound, power steering is restored.  I have not had the problem since then, so I think that some water splashed up and shorted something out temporarily.

I picked up my laptop from LTU on Wednesday.  Unfortunately, I got another poor quality MPC laptop.  The computer had a stress crack in it when I got it.  Still, it is nice to have a laptop again.

There were some pretty intense thunderstorms on Friday evening.  Four tornadoes touched down in southeastern Michigan.  Thankfully, I was not near them/

On early Sunday morning, I defeated Diablo in Act IV of <i>Diablo II: Lord of Destruction</i>.  It took three hours and was pretty slow going because I kept having to do hit and run attacks because Diablo's attacks were potent enough to kill my character almost instantly if I stayed in one spot too long.  I am much relieved to have finally beat him because it took me almost a day to beat him."

"event","This is going to be a very gloomy week.  It rained heavily yesterday and today and will continue to do so the rest of the week.  Granted, we needed the rain badly.  It was getting really dry here and my front lawn was looking parched.  Now the lawn looks much greener.  Also, the temperature really dropped so it much nicer to be outside,

I was introduced to <i>Diablo II</i> three weeks ago by my co-workers.  While the game has somewhat dated graphics  I found the gameplay to good and I enjoy it.  As soon as I found out that the Druid character can shapeshift and summon creatures, I was hooked.  I  am currently working on quests three and four of Act three. I have a level twenty-four Druid that can transform into a werewolf, summon ravens, and summon wolves.

I get another notebook computer on Wednesday from Lawrence Tech.  I cannot wait.  I am probably going to get there early so that that I get a good notebook."

"event","On Monday, I finally got to see <lj user=""silver_huskey""> and <lj user=""balto_mike"">at Silver's house in Philadelphia.  I got lost shortly after I got offof Interstate 95. Driving through Philly reminded me much of downtown Detroit with all the one way streets and angled streets.  I called Silver and she directed me then rest of the way to her house.

I had to duck when going down to Silver's basement because of a low ceiling and how tall I am.  When I got down there, I met Mike for the first time and the three of us chatted about various topics such as cultural differences between the three of us.  Mike showed us some of his pictures and I showed some of mine from my iPod and camera.  Mike even showed us a part of his unfinished sled dog documentary.  I thought that was cool!  Mike and I also showed Silver where we lived using the satellite view on Google Maps.

Somehow the subject got changed to breakfast foods and Silver showed Mike a box of Pop-tarts.  Apparently they are not found over in Europe. Mike wanted to record himself trying one with me.  I had not eaten one in quite awhile and I found it to be really sweet.  I had some fun talking on camera.  Afterwards, Silver's mother got some pictures of the three of us.  Mike and I also took some photos of Silver's dog, Jo-Jo.

Silver showed me her Balto collection and I looked through it.  I found the press kit to be press kit to particularly interesting.  It seems that the writers knew the true story and took artistic license when making the film.  I had long suspected this, but that press kit confirmed it.

I stayed for dinner and we ordered pizza from a local pizza shop. Silver and I were initially confused when Mike asked for a margerita pizza.  We both thought of the alcoholic drink.  It turns out that it isa plain or cheese pizza.  Silver and I shared a chicken and onion pizza, Mike showed us clips of a British show called <i>Mock of the Week</i> which I thought it was pretty funny.  We also watched BBC America and a documentry from Mike's DVD collection.  Shortly thereafter, I had to leave.  I really did not want to leave because I knew it would be quite awhile until I saw Mike again, if ever.  The day just seemed too short and I wish I could of stayed for a longer period of time.  Had I known in advance that Silver and Mike would be heading for Manhattan the next day, I would have gone with them.

The next day, I drove straight home from my uncle's house.  The drive took me about eleven hours.  I missed a couple of turns in Delaware so I spent an hour in that state when I should of only spent 20 minutes. I also got stuck in a four-mile backup behind a car accident for atleast 15 minutes.

The final score was 7-5.<br /><br />Sunday afternoon was spent touring Fort Mott in New Jersey and Fort Delaware on Pea Pod Island in Delaware.&nbsp; Fort Mott is a line of ""disappearing"" 10 and 12-inch gun encampments built in the 1890s and 1900s that, along with Fort Delaware and Delaware City, protected Philadelphia from enemy naval forces.&nbsp; The guns could be loaded in safe location and then were raised to the firing position by dropping a counterweight.&nbsp; When fired, the gun's recoil would lower it back to the loading position.&nbsp; Fortunately, these guns were never fired on enemy vessels.<br /><br />Fort Delaware is a Civil War-era fort and was also used as prisoner of war camp for captured Confederate troops.&nbsp; I only got to stay in the fort for a hour, but I got see some the restored rooms.&nbsp;"

Yesterday's massacre at Virginia Tech. is bothering me.  One of my father's former co-workers at Texas Instruments is now an engineering professor at VT.  We still don't know if he is alive.

I watched the <i>Man Among Wolves</i> documentary late last night.  I missed the 9:00 p.m. showing but caught it when it repeated at midnight.  I liked it and found it interesting.  I did not know there were different types of howls.  I do hope that Shawn's experiment with using defensive howls to keep wolves away from farms and ranches is successful.  

I have less than a week left of driving to LTU via the freeway system.  On the evening of the 20th, the state is going to shutdown the section of the Lodge/ Northwestern Freeway (M-10) that I drive on.  I only drive about a half-mile on that road, but because of its closure I have to go back to driving city streets."

"event","The top five have left the Iditarod checkpoint and are heading for Shageluk and Anvik.  Anvik, which is 90 miles from the Iditarod checkpoint, marks the start of the run up the Yukon River.  My educated guess is that the leaders should arrive in Anvik sometime after 3:30 pm AKST today.  Zack Steer, Martin Buser, and Jeff King left at 9:28 pm, 10:48 pm, and 12:21 am respectively.  Lance Mackey and Paul Gephardt  left 13 minutes apart two hours behind King   These teams will most likely take a rest shortly before Shageluk and then run straight to Anvik since only 25 miles separates them.

Two more teams have scratched from the race.  Ben Stamm scratched in Nikolai at 11 am AKST yesterday <a href=""http://www.iditarod.com/2007/dailyarchives/story_288.html"">http://www.iditarod.com/2007/dailyarchives/story_288.html>due to a knee injury</a>.  <a href=""http://www.iditarod.com/2007/dailyarchives/story_291.html"">http://www.iditarod.com/2007/dailyarchives/story_291.html>G.B Jones scratched in Rohn</a>  so that he could go back and find a dog, Afees, that slipped his harness.  Jones and another musher, Deborah Molberg Bicknell, took a wrong turn and headed the long way to Rohn via Ptarmigan Pass and ""Hell's Gate"" instead of the marked route through the Dalzell Gorge.  She was on the trail for 34 hours in what should be done in  6-8 hours.

Sixteen teams, or 19.5 % of the field,  have now scratched from the race.  The 2007 race is now tied with the 2005 race for the number of scratches and is well on its way to breaking the 2003 record of 20 scratched teams."

So I had it serviced by a local auto. shop on Monday  (I rarely have it serviced by a Ford dealership).  It turns out that the computer could not read the front right collision  sensor due to the corroded, and thus broken, wire running to the sensor.  That section of wire was replaced.  That was best possible scenario, since it easily could have been an expensive component."

I also stopped by the LTU bookstore to buy my books for the next semester.  In the afternoon I played <i>Jax X</i>  until about 4:00 PM and then I worked on an article in Wikpedia until 5:00 PM.

That evening my mother, father, and I went out for dinner at a restaurant near my brother's (Mark) high school.  We met one of former neighbors and long time friends.  Mark and their son, Daniel,  are the marching band for Churchill High School.  Mark plays the saxophone while Daniel is the lead drum major (directs the band).  Anyway, after dinner we went over to watch the football game.  Before the game, they played a jazz hit and, of course, the national anthem.  The band seemed a bit out of sync in those two songs.   I was more interested in seeing the marching band play than the actual game, so the first half seem to drag on.  Churchill scored a touchdown early in the first quarter (6-0) and the visiting team, Lansing Eastern, scored a touchdown in the second (6-6).  During halftime, the band played two more jazz hits including the 1999 hit ""Jump, Jive, and Wail"".  They seemed to play better during the halftime show.  It the third quarter, Lansing Eastern scored another touchdown (6-13).  Churchill scored a touchdown at the end of the fourth quarter to tie the game at 13 -13 and force overtime.  Lansing Eastern scored a touchdown in overtime to win the game, 20-13."

"event","It has been one interesting week so far.  The Fall term at LTU starts in less than a week, so I have spent the week trying to get things done and out of the way.  I still have a few things to take care of that I will do on Friday and Saturday.  I also got assignments from 2 of my professors that I need to get done by the first class meeting.  I am going to try to keep on top of my coursework this semester so that I can earn A grades in my courses.

<lj-cut>
Monday:  I created a list of tasks that needed to be done before August 30th.  I completed some of those tasks.  Also, we hired someone to come out and raising the front garden by installing a short retaining wall and then filling the garden with dirt.  That person ripped out most of the plants and bushes (with one exception) and the plastic barrier that used to separate the front garden from the front lawn.

Tuesday:  Completed two more tasks.  I also helped paint my neighbors mailbox since the paint was peeling.  The retaining wall was installed and the garden was filled with dirt.  We still have to plant new plants and lay down mulch.  That evening I also helped my dad stain the hardwood floor in our living room.  The floor now only needs 3 coats of polyurethane before we can put furniture back in.

Wednesday morning:  We suspect that my father's CD wallet in his Ford Focus was taken.  He found the driver's side door open a crack and an empty slimline CD case on the ground.  Also, when my dad went out through the garage, he noticed that the light on the automatic garage door opener was on when it should not have been.  That light has a 4.5 minute timer before it turns off.  That means that someone opened and closed the garage door.  Since the Focus and the Taurus (my car) were both unintentionally left unlocked and both have transmitters for the garage door opener, it is rather obvious how the garage door opener.

Wednesday afternoon: I took care of a few more things and then did a Voice chat with <lj user=""balto_mike""> for almost 4 hours and it was nice to chat with him.  Although we did run out of topics to talk about 3 or 4 times towards the end of the voice chat.  It had been awhile since I did a voice chat with anyone.  I got the TBL podcast from him.

Wednesday evening:  I decided to try a game called <i>Jak X: Combat Racing</i> for the PS2.  My brother had gotten the game for Christmas and I had recently seen him play it.  When I started the game, I found that it would not save to the memory card despite the fact that I had more than enough room on the card.  I decided to play the game without saving so that I could get a feel for the game.  I found that the game is fun to play.  It is a cross between <i>Mario Kart</i> and <i>Beatle Adventure Racing</i>(both of which I played in the '90s).

Thursday:  Completed two more tasks in the morning.  In the afternoon,  my brother ( whom had just earned his driver's license two weeks ago) calls to say that my car is smoking and there is a burnt smell.  So my mother and I go to rescue him and find out what is wrong with the Taurus.  At first I thought that car may have been leaking oil, but it turns out that my brother had been driving with the parking brake engaged.  The Taurus is okay though, and I am going to monitor it for a few days.  The rest of the day was spent playing <i>Jak X</i> and working on-line.

"event","Tomorrow I will be going to Ed, Tasha, and the dogs again.  I cannot wait.  I will be sure to take many photos and maybe even some short video clips ( with no sound).

I completed my physics lab report Thursday afternoon and turned it in.  Thursday's lab was confusing and it gave me a headache trying to figure the lab out.  We did complete the lab though and were allowed to turn in the data with a short conclusion.  This means that I do not have a lab report due next week!

Later that evening I got a head laceration from hitting a low ceiling.  I got excited about something and jumped up while not paying attention to where I was going.  I had to have 5 staples put in to close the wound.

Today, I went to my physics class where we had some group work to do.  Since we did not cover much material this week (due to last Monday's exam), there was not much to do.  My group got done with the work in less than 30 minutes.  After class, I filled up the tank of my car in preparation for tomorrow's trip.  I also printed the directions to the location of the Stielstra's presentation.  I took it easy for the rest of the day.

I should be at the TBL chat sometime around 8 PM EDST."

"event","My Physics 2 exam did not go well.  I really need to study more for these exams.  I now need to do extremely well on the final to get a good grade.

After the exam, I went home and decided to cut the lawn.  The grass was getting really long and it needed to be cut.  My city has an ordinance that does not allow grass to be higher than six inches.  So I fired up the lawn mower and spent the next hour cutting the lawn.

All that physical work made me hungry, so I ate lunch.  Afterwords, I wrote some e-mails and worked on my class schedule for the 2006 fall term.  All those activities consumed the rest of the afternoon.  Before I knew, it was time to go back to LTU for my second class of the day.  The class itself was pretty short since the professor did not have any new material for Wednesday's exam.  I stopped by Student Computer Center to talk to a friend of mine and see  if my replacement shell for my laptop had come in yet.  It had not come in yet.

I went home and ate dinner.  After that, I read some Live Journals and then finished planning my classes for the 2006 fall term (16 weeks).  I am planning on taking Circuits 2, Digital Electronics, Digital Electronics Lab, and Discrete Mathematics.  I am also taking classes during the summer 2006 term (10 weeks).  Those classes are Circuits 1, Circuits 1 lab, Development of the American Experience, and Probability & Statistics. 

I have completed the reading for my next Physics 2 class.  I will be spending another 2 hours studying for the Diff. Equ. exam."

"event","It was one year ago that I posted <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/arctic_pup/2003/12/01/"">this entry</a>.  Unlike last year, this year the final two weeks are going to be much easier.  I only have one exam and one final exam to study for.  I guess I just remember last year's post because of the stress I was under at the time.

The Dell Dimension 8400 did not come today.  It is being shipped in 3 different boxes.  When I checked the UPS tracking numbers around 7 PM, one box had arrived at the local UPS distribution center and the other was en route to it.  When I checked it again 2 hours later, the other 2 packages had arrived at the local distribution center.  That center is about a mile from where I live so it should be showing up later today.

As for my custom computer, both parts of my order are en route.  One part of my order contains the Motherboard and OS and is being shipped from NJ.  The part is the case and it is being shipped from TN.  Both packages should arrive before 4:30 PM on Thursday.  

I have decided to downgrade the PSU to a silver Aspire ATX-MR450W Concord 450 Watt aluminum PSU with dual fans (one intake and one outtake).  This PSU has 30 amps on the 12 volt line, 20 amps on the 5 volt line, and 24 amps on the 3.3 line.  That is far more power than I need, but I have left room for future expansions.  The PSU also comes with an extra case fan and a case fan speed adjuster for up to five fans."

"event","I should explain Friday's early morning post.  On the 21st my father mentioned a deal on a Dell computer that he had seen in a newspaper advertisement.  After having no luck in finding the ad, I went to Dell's website and found the deal on a Dimension 8400 Media Center Edition.  The deal included $250 off the price, free 2nd day shipping, an upgrade to a 17 inch LCD monitor, and an upgrade to a 16x DVD+/-RW with double layer write.  I looked over the specs and felt that it was a very good system for $1532.00.

<lj-cut text=""More inside..."">
As good as that deal was,  I really wanted to build a system from the ground up.  For the past three years I have been trying to convince my parents to let me build a system.  So I went to newegg.com to look at prices for the components.  I was able to design a system comparable to the 8400 for about $50 less.  However , my father liked the deal more.  We compromised on buying the 8400 with some modifications ( downgrading to a 160 GB HDD, removing the TV tuner option, and downgrading the speakers) and letting me build a new system with some scavenged parts.

I have decided to buy all the parts I need from <a href=""http://www.newegg.com"">Newegg.com</a>.  They seem to have the lowest prices and fast shipping.  I need to buy a new motherboard, processor, RAM, a video card, case and power supply unit for the new system.  I can scavenge a 80 GB HDD, a 40 GB, a PCI W-FI card, a PCI modem, and two Ultra ATA/133 PCI controller cards,  17"" CRT monitor,  a CD-RW drive, a mouse, and a keyboard Of those, I will be using both HDDs, the PCI WI-FI card, the CD-RW, keyboard, and mouse

My specs. for the new machine are below:

Motherboard: Gigabyte GA-K8VT800 socket 754 (800 Mhz FSB)
Processor: AMD Athlon 64 2800+ at 1.8 Ghz
Video Card: Sapphire Radeon ""9800 Atlantis"" (ATI Radeon 9800 chipset) (128 MB)
RAM:1 GB DDR 400 Mhz (PC-3200)
Case: Black Aspire XDreamer II with acrylic side window
Hard Drive 1: Western Digital 80 GB 7,200 RPM Ultra ATA\100
Hard Drive 2: Western Digital 40 GB 7,200 RPM Ultra ATA\100
CD-RW: MagicSpin 52x24x52
Power Supply: Aspire 520W Triple Fan Aluminum PSU with Blue LEDs
PCI 802.11b wireless adapter: D-Link PCI adapter
Sound: Integrated Realtek ACL 658 AC97 6-channel
LAN: Integrated Realtek 8100C 10/100mb
Keyboard: Logitech Deluxe 104
Mouse: Logitech Click! optical mouse
Monitor: HP M70 17"" CRT
OS: Microsoft Windows XP Media Center 2005

Now for the status of both machines.  The 8400 has been processed and shipped.  It was shipped last Tuesday and, due to the holiday break, should be here later today.   As for my new system (yet to be named), I have ordered the case, OS, and the motherboard from Newegg.  Newegg had a special on the OS and the case so I took advantage of it.  I bought the motherboard because the OS was an OEM version and I had to purchase a piece of hardware with it.

"event","After getting ready for work this morning, I still had an hour before I had to go to work.  So I decided to read my e-mail.  In my Inbox was a message from my supervisor about an important meeting at 2:00 PM.  A little shocked about the short notice, I emailed her back asking her if we could move the meeting up one hour since I had a class at 2:00 PM.  I found out later that the meeting could not be moved so I had to miss it.

While still at home, I started putting together a list of programs that would be put onto Tools and Drivers CD for work.  Last summer's disk is now outdated and needs to be replaced.  I managed to put together a list of programs that I thought were needed.  I asked my supervisor to get suggestions for other programs to included on disk at the meeting.

That is it for now.  We shall see how tomorrow goes."

"event","I did not end up going to Michigan's Adventure on Saturday.  Instead, I had a friend come over and we watched some movies on Friday night and Saturday morning.  It was fun having someone to hangout with.  I even got to finally see Princess Mononoke on DVD!  I really liked it.

The MiA plans have been postponed to the 18th.  I should be going with 2 of coaster friends and their girlfriends. I am excited that I will finally be able to ride Shivering Timbers.  Every since I have heard of that ride I have wanted to ride it but have not had the chance.

I spent the rest of Saturday watching college football or online.  I was feeling really lazy Saturday so I really did not do anything.  I had a pretty good time on the TBL chat despite being sleepy.  I stayed on the chat till shortly after 1 AM and then went to bed.

I was determined to make Sunday the complete opposite of Saturday.  I cleaned up my room, the kitchen, and the living room.  During the afternoon I ran maintenance programs on my notebook and the HP.  I also completed my homework.  After dinner I started to mow the lawn.  I managed to get the front and side yards cut.  I got the backyard prepped for mowing before it got too dark for me to see the lines, That evening I watch some National Geographic specials on dogs.

I finished mowing the lawn this morning.  Then I watched ""Growing up Wolf"" on Animal Planet.  After that I watched 2 CSI episodes.  My family came home from PA around 4:30.  After dinner I having been spending my time online.

I have enjoyed this 3-day weekend.  I really needed it.  It is back to the grind tomorrow."

"event","Wow! August sure blew by fast.  I cannot believe it is September already.  Work has kept me quite busy and I have been finding myself exhausted when I get home.  This is why I did not write a single entry for the whole month of August.  

Back in early August I accepted a full-time position at work.  That job officially started on the 16th.  The paperwork still has to be finalized as it is in the Provosts Office right now.  Once they give approval, I will be paid retroactively from the 16th to the end of August.  I just wish that the paperwork would be sped up a bit.

Since I am working 37.5 hours a week now, I am only taking one 4 credit hour class.  That would be Calculus 3.  It meets MWF for 50 minutes at 1:00 PM and on Tuesday at 2:00 PM for 75 minutes.  The University is going to pay for it though since I work for them.  They will pay for up to 6 credit hours a semester.

I am thinking about heading to Michigan's Adventure this weekend to finally get a chance to ride Shivering Timbers.  My family is going to PA for the Penn State game.  I cannot go because I have to work on Friday.  So I thought that I might go ride coasters.  This would be a well earned trip as I have been working my tail off the last three weeks.  I need to do something fun away from Southeast MI.  As long is it does not rain and I can find some place to stay overnight, I should be fine."

I will be getting trained to support the MPC Transport T2200 (ultra light portable Notebook), MPC Transport T3000 (standard Notebook), and the MPC Clientpro All-in-One (one piece desktop).  I will also be trained to use Ozone.  Ozone is MPC's product database in which we can keep track of what has been done to a particular system.

I will be gone for 4 days beginning tomorrow.  I have an early flight (9:00 AM) to catch Monday at DTW (Detroit Metro Airport).  I have a layover in Minneapolis, MN.  The second flight takes me directly to Boise.  

The return trip has a layover in Salt Lake City.  That flight will be arriving at DTW around 9:00 PM on Thursday.  I may or may not be going into work the next day because of jet lag.

I do know that the hotel rooms that we are staying at have broadband Internet access, so I should be able to get online.  I will try to keep up with what is going on here, but if I am feeling information overload, I may not get on."

"event","After 8.5 months of driving with a broken mirror, I finally got it fixed.  No more duct-taped mirror for me! I also don't have to worry about the duct tape failing.  I was always bothered by the shaking that the mirror would do while I was driving.  Now I do not have to worry about that anymore.

  I can also open the driver's sided window again.  To hold the mirror panel in position, I had to put duct tape on it and the window.  Having to keep the window closed was not a problem in Winter.  However, when the temperatures warmed up I missed driving with the windows down.

I took 2 photos before the mirror panel was fixed and 2 photos after the panel was fixed.  <a href=""http://f2.pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/sgordon21/detail?.dir=/9eeb&.dnm=a844.jpg"" target=""_blank"">This photo</a> shows the damage on the reflective side of the mirror. <a href=""http://f2.pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/sgordon21/detail?.dir=/9eeb&.dnm=c268.jpg&.src=ph"" target=""_blank"">This photo</a> shows the back side of the damaged panel.  <a href=""http://f2.pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/sgordon21/detail?.dir=/9eeb&.dnm=7eff.jpg&.src=ph"" target=""_blank"">This photo</a> shows the replacement mirror panel on the reflective side.

Saturday morning my mother and I went to get an estimate for fixing the <a href=""http://www.livejournal.com/users/arctic_pup/2003/10/22/"" target=""_blank"">broken mirror</a> on the Taurus.  For nearly 8 months I have been driving with the mirror panel duct-taped to the doorframe.  The guy took down the model number of the car and would call us back Monday with an estimate.  Hopefully the whole thing should cost under $500 with a used part.

I spent the rest of Saturday watching TV or on my laptop.  I finished putting together the slide show and music for a graduation party for one of Andy's (one of my younger brothers) friends.  I also watched ""The Great Escape"" on the History Channel.  I got on the TBL chat and watched Wolf's Rain.  I sure did have fun on the TBL chat.

<u><b>Sunday:</b></u>
I spent Sunday morning getting ready for a Eagle Court of Honor and Brad's (Andy's friend) Graduation party.  Since I am technically still a leader for my troop, I had to dress in a full uniform.  For those that don't know, I earned my Eagle Rank back on January 16th, 2001.  I am glad I went to it as I was reminded of the Eagle Scout Challenge and Charge.  This inspired me greatly.  I feel that I can go to work and make a difference.  It also made want to do good on my next exam.  Being an Eagle Scout makes me an example to be looked up to.  I have to excel to hold up the Eagle Scout title.

After the ceremony, I drove home to change into my normal clothes for the graduation party.  When I got the party, people kept commenting on the slideshow.  It seems as if Brad's mother was giving me more credit than I deserved.  I am naturally modest person and could not take all the credit.  I just do not have a big ego.  I guess she was being nice to me for letting her use my laptop.  Brad's mother scanned the photos, my mom cropped some of them, and all I did was transfer them from our main computer to my laptop and use ACDSee to do the slideshow.  Brad's mom also created a music CD and gave it me.  I put it in my CD-RW/DVD-ROM drive and used Winamp 5 to play it in continuous mode.  It really was not that hard and anyone could do it.

I spent the rest of Sunday studying for my Calc. 2 exam.  I am pretty confident that I can do well on the exam because I did the homework and studied for the exam.  Wish me luck!

Finally, the Pistons beat the Lakers again.  Who would have thought that they would be winning the series 3-1 over the Lakers?   Just one more game and the Pistons win their third NBA championship."

"event","<lj-cut text=""The past two days...""><u><b>Thursday</b></u>

I stayed up till 3 AM Thursday morning doing integrals for Calculus 2.  It is very time consuming to do integrals in an accelerated course.  I had let myself get behind so I only managed to get one integral done on the homework for Thursday.

Work was pretty slow on Thursday.  I wanted to bring one of our cloning machines from our storage room (M219) over to the office.  The only problem was that the weather would not cooperate.  It kept raining the either time I was at work.  I could not risk short-circuiting the machine while I had to travel between buildings.  I ended up cleaning up the office to make it more organized.

I went to class after work.  There is just something about a 2-hour Calculus class that makes one feel tired.  Even though we get a ten-minute break, by the end of course I feel tired and do not want to do any work afterwards.

After class I ate dinner alone.  The only problem with this course and work schedule is that I cannot eat with the rest of my family 4 days of the week.  I'm used to eating with my family 7 days a week.  Oh well, at least this is only for 5 more weeks.

The Pistons game was on Thursday night so I watched that game.  The Pistons beat the Lakers 88-68 to win Game 3 of the NBA Finals.  I think the Pistons can win the NBA Championship.

<u><b>Friday</b></u>
I had planned back on Wednesday to use Friday to organize M219 as it badly needed to be organized.  Since the return period was so hectic, we let both storage rooms slide as we needed to keep the office clear.  As a result, there were laptops stacked on the floor of M219 to point that one could not get a cart or a dolly very far into the room.  This is completely unacceptable considered that June 17th marks the 2 month countdown to Fall Distribution.  We have to use M219 to clean and re-image the Compaq n1000c laptops for the next semester.

Anyway, I spent the first 3.5 hours to finish restoring the remaining HPs in M219.  I also started putting some of the HPs in the MoblieLANs because I have decided to store them there.  We need the shelf space for the Compaqs.  The HPs come off-lease in the fall and are not a big concern.

I walked back over to office only to find that only Serdar, a student assistant,  was there.  All the full-time staff members were out.  Ken and RaShawn were out to lunch and Charlene was at a meeting.  One full-time staff member is supposed to stay there at all times.  Charlene came back and told me that she had gotten some student proctors from the EDCC to come over and help me.  She also told me that they would be here at 1 PM.  So I ate lunch while waiting for them to come over.

After they joined me, we headed back to M219 to work on it.  For the next three hours we put HPs in the MoblieLANs, Started putting Compaqs on the shelves, and moved laptop cases over to other storage room in the UTLC building.  By 4:00 we had made good progress towards an organized storage room.  After 4:00, the helpers left and I started packing up to head back the office.  I finally took the cloning machine back with me to the office as well as a few other things.

My brother had a swim meet Friday night so my parents were gone.  I ate dinner and then decided to run maintenance programs on our Dell.  My brother generally spends a lot of time on that computer and I can never seem to get a chance to run maintenance programs on that computer.  Afterwards I worked on my Calculus homework.</lj-cut>"

We were done with the project by 12:00 PM so I had time to do other projects.  My next project is to organize the store room so it is ready when we need to reimage all the Compaqs.  Right now there are laptops stacked on the floor and one can't wheel a cart in there very far.

Tomorrow our new vendor, MPC, is coming to meet us.  Their President, Vice President, and some Reps. will be here.  I can't wait to meet them.  Considering that MPC is based out of Idaho, I consider it an honor for them to come here.  Hopefully this will be the start of a long-term relationship between LTU and MPC.

Now back to Calc. 2 homework."

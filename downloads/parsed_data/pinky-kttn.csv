"event","&nbsp;They say that a triangle friendship is hard to maintain, and in some respects it is. But Hell, I've just realized how amazingly easy it is to us....

I mean Kristin, we can bitch to each other, and keep on going until it starts getting personal, and then laugh it off. We can go back and forth with insults flying, and people think we hate each other. We can get into 3 second fights, and then laugh about it afterwards. I never feel awkward talking to you, because I know whatever it is you'll talk about it too. Sometimes I think that&nbsp; we share the same thoughts, and it creeps my out a little. XD 

Ara...its amazing how much you tolerate me. I can be whiny, bitchy, and stupid and yet you're still always there calling me a whore. You always have the right things to say, and can motivate me even at my breaking point. Any time I need advice, or help, I know if I come to you, I'll get it ....I love the fact that we can be stupid and silly, and just plain weird. RANDOM is the perfect word.&nbsp; &lt;3 You may sometimes feel like we treat you like a younger sister, but you'll Always be my big sister.

In between us, there is a grey area where we all contribute. That's when I can truly say that we have a perfect triangle. I love you guys so much.

YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS I got my soppy journal entry of the month out of my system &lt;3

Lots of love forever

"event","<b>It's so hard to believe that our sophmore year is steadily coming to its end. There are so many memories, so many things that I wish I could change, and things that I wouldn't change for the world. Looking back, things all make sense...<i>(yeah right).<br /><br /></i><font size=""3""><font size=""1"">&nbsp;Next year we'll be juniors...JUNIORS. This is a scary concept, because we will no longer be the stupid underclassmen....We'll be the stupid upperclassmen. I mean, I remember a time where I was half as tall as I am now, and half as stressed out as well.&nbsp; Things were different...so much easier.<br /><br /><br />I have one more rambling before I end this CRAP entry....<br /><br />To Ara and Kristin, my sisters at heart: Thanks for being there everyday of my life. Thanks for saying the things that <i>I need to hear. Thanks for being more than friends, more than close friends....<br /><br />Sometimes a best friend (or two in my case) can understand things that a close friend can't.<br /></i><br /></font></font><i><font size=""3""><font size=""1""></font></font><br /></i></b>"

"event","<p><strong><font size=""3"">&nbsp;I'm just so glad this week is over. I don't know why, but I've been feeling overwhelmed by everything lately. With the prospect of maybe moving, friends, and of course school. The work is slowly piling up, and it feels like its going to topple over onto me. Track is....well track. I get frustrated and annoyed if I don't do well, and I realize that I am the same with everything else. I beat myself up about a bad grade, or a bad throw, or a bad choice that I have made. I have to stop, because it's ebbing away at my self esteem, and I know it is. I don't know how to stop it though. My coaches, friends, teachers, and parents have noticed, and It's just so hard to stop. it's an immediate feeling that washes over me every time I make a mistake. Like I am a failure, like I am just not meant to succeed. Before I know it, tears are in my eyes, and I'm making a scene.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Well, lets move on.<br />&nbsp; Lately, I've been sensing a little bit of tension with one of my friends, and I want to clear the air, before it gets any further. </font></strong></p><p><strong><font size=""3"">#1- I know when something is wrong, so when you are talking in a tiny voice, and not making eye contact, do not try to tell me it is nothing. I'll know. I've known you for over 9 years of my life. It could be as little as feeling tired or sick....but I know when it's something.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size=""3"">#2- I don't mean to baby you. You are like a sibling to me....a sister. It's how I talk to my friends in general. If I come up to you, and say something that is degrading to you in any way, FREAKING SAY SOMETHING. Don't keep it bottled up inside, because we all know what happens when we do that...</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size=""3"">#3- I CARE...sometimes it may not seem like it, but I do.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size=""3"">Ok...whatevs...lol..omg...brb...bbl....mch l8r.....rotfl...and so on.</font></strong></p><p><strong><font size=""3"">Jade &lt;3 </font></strong></p>"

"event","I'm Baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack!!!!!!!!!!!! Heh Heh.  I don't really know what to say. I am quite content at the moment, trying to ignore the fact that I have summer reading to do...and a hell of a lot of it.I honestly didn't know how much I was missed. As soon as I got home, my parents hugged me like I'd been away for a thousand years. I turned on my laptop, and I immediately saw 10 IM's for me on the screen. I checked the 654 emails that I had in my box, and was surprised to see that 38 of them were from people I knew. (OK, not the best percentage, but it's better than 1/654 right?) I had a great time at Cape Cod with Kristin, we had so many jokes there, (JESUS A LION, GET BACK IN THE CAR!) and so on. So...yeah...

 I don't know how Ara writes so much in her entries, so I am going to stop right now.



PEACE!"

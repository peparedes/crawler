hate shopping for bras i mean i cant even carry them and when i shop
for them i shop as fast as i can) she looks at me and was like: <br>
""hello honey...did u try these on yet?"" 
<br>
""no""
<br>
""well you should go try them on""<br>
""o thats ok""<br>
""do u buy shoes and not try them on?""
<br>
""no""
<br>
""well then you have to try them on silly""<br>
i got soo red and soo embarrassed (i dont even try on my jeans before i buy them!
and she keep going
""ooo <font style=""font-weight: bold;"" size=""3"">i have this one on right now</font>...its very comfy""<br>
thats was probily the most akward convo of my life...and to make
matters worse after we get outta the store i have to listen to my mom
make fun of me for being embarrassed and...AND...her stories of when
she used to buy bras with her great aunt!"

<P>Donnie: First of all, Papa Smurf didn't create Smurfette. Gargamel did. She was sent in as Gargamel's evil spy with the intention of destroying the Smurf village, but the <FONT color=#ffcccc>overwhelming goodness </FONT>of the Smurf way of life transformed her. And as for the whole gang-bang scenario, it just couldn't happen. Smurfs are asexual. They don't even have reproductive organs under those little white pants. That's what's so illogical, you know, about being a Smurf. <FONT color=#ffffff>What's the point of living if you don't have a dick?</FONT></P>"

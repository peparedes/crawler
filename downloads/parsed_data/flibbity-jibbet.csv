"event","Howdy Mr. Journal Man. Well, I've had a pretty boring day... I've been sitting here downloading music vids allllll day. But the reason I'm here... is to report on what I found with these videos. The first.. Staind - For You.. I'll talk about that one first. The video is breathtaking to me. I relate 102312043403434% to that song, and the video they made is exactly how I pictured it. How it has the kid yelling the words to the song out, but when his parents look at him, he's silent. The way I interpret that, is that when it shows him yelling, that's what's in his head. Then, when they're eating at the restaurant, all the kids can see him singing. Then while these words are playing: 

All your insults and your curses 
Make me feel like I'm not a person
And I feel like I'm nothing
But you made me, so do something
Cuz I'm f***ed up, because you are
I need attention, attention you wouldn't give

All these other kids jump up and start yelling the lyrics to their parents. The parents don't notice it. It goes to show... kids all across this piece of crap nation go through this. We shouldn't be scared to do things around our parents that normal families do. After that, the kid walks to a nearby warehouse, where Staind is playing the song. I don't quite know if that has a significance to the song. To me, I guess it sorta says that someones always there for you, like Staind was when they made the song... er somethin, I dunno.

The second video that affected me... was Shimmer.. by Fuel. The only real thing that I even noticed... was that I found the quote of my life. It is this: 

Cuz I have found all that shimmers in this world is sure to fade... away... again...

That quote... when I heard it... it just smacked me... like a bolt of lightning. It's like.. EVERYTHING that is good in my life... finds some way to turn itself around and rape me dirty!! Hmm... examples, you want? Ok.

1. WOOHOO!!! I'm goin to a 12 Stones concert.. I LOVE THIS BAND..... WOOHOO, it's only 3 DAYS til the concert!!! *clicks on email* ""The concert has been canceled."" Well FRIGGIN A this is SPECTACULAR!!!!

2. Aww I get to go on my first date in awhile to Six Flags... waaait... *After waiting there for 2 hours... no ***** Darn!! I have been stood up!!!

3. EVERYTHING ELSE that happened in 2002. This year SUCKS!!

Well, that's about all I can think of right now. There's really nothin else I have to talk about haha. I just wanted to let ya know... that I actually headbanged and cried to a music video by Staind, and watched a sweaty blonde guy sum up my life in a rhyme. I'll talk to ya later dude! CYA!!!!"

"event","Hey Mr. Journal Man! How you doin? Haha. Well, I went to my couisin's house at about 10 friday night. I came back about 9 saturday morning. I never fell asleep, so it was all good. I talked to Tina on the phone twice today, she's so awesome. We just casually talked about whatever, and I enjoyed it. Can't wait til next time heh. I talked to Kalli online tonight! WooHoo!! As mentioned in my first entry, she was my first big crush. But that's over now, and we're better friends than ever. Sometimes, I think about it, and some aspects of our friendship may seem... well, weird. We don't really do all the things that great friends do... like, ever, haha, but it's all good. Rickey's comin back tomorrow, and I guess that's an upside to the weekend. He's really the only person that I go and hang out with just FTHOI. I love the guy, what can I say? No matter what, he's always there for me. If I'm in a bind, he's there to help me out of it. He was there through the whole Kalli thing, and he was there at the Creed concert with me. I needed someone to share the experience. I don't think he knows how much I appreciate him bein there, but oh well. I haven't paid him back for all he's done for me, and honestly, I don't think I ever will.

Onto another subject, that has to do with Kalli. She did somethin that irritated the crap outta me. This happened last thursday. Not the 3 days ago thursday, but the 10 days ago thursday. I asked if she wanted to go hang out and get a bite to eat next week, which is the week that just passed. She emailed me back the next day sayin that she couldn't, cuz she was goin to church camp. I was like ""Ohhh ok."" But then later, when I was talkin to her online, I was sayin ""Sooo, what time you leavin for camp tomorrow?"" She told me that she wasn't even leavin til tuesday. The tuesday that hasn't happened yet.   ..... Now wait just a second. Her reason for not bein able to hang with me and rickey, was that she's leavin for camp that week. But she's leavin 2 days into the week after that. She KNEW she was leavin then. Someone care to explain this to me? Anyone that reads this and leaves a reply... tell me... Was she A) Lying to me to get out of hangin with me n Rickey .... or B) Thinkin I meant the week after next ... cuz right now, I'm leanin towards her lyin, but who knows? I could be wrong. I just need some more input, so I don't think I'm the only one that's suspicious here.In the meantime, I'm gonna finish this post off. I hope everyone has a good night, cya later Mr. Journal Man!"

"event","I actually updated my journal twice in one day! Turns out that this thing is pretty cool! Cuz when I vent my problems to individual people, I feel like someone who's looking for some kinda pity er somethin. But that's not the case. So I'm gonna start writing the good and the bad here. And if you wanna check it out to see how I'm feeling, have at it! 

Well, today, wasn't that great. Rickey's still outta town... gonna be gone til sunday. So I'm kinda stuck here with nuthin to do til then. However, I am gettin some shoes tomorrow, hopefully. That'll add a little spark to the week. July 4th was just another day for Josh. I woke up.. had somethin to eat.... got on the computer... talked... and here I am. Hi! Ya see, my whole life, my dad has hated fireworks shows. So, obviously, considering the fact that he only cares about himself, I didn't get to see any. Other years, when I saw fireworks, I was with Rickey and his family, or, like last year... I was at...ugh... Celebrate Freedom 2001. It was this christian-esque woodstock type of thing. Did I have fun? No. Not at all. I did not dig one band I saw. We had a bunch of pop star crap-headed people, then Steven Curtis Chapman. That guy knows how to rock (notice the big friggin load of sarcasm I just omitted)!!! The firework show was good though. And I got to ... well... sorta hang with a friend, Rebekah. I wouldn't say we spent ALOTTA time talkin.. but more than usual. Nothin that special. That's cool, how I can let out my true feelings on here. 

OH YEAH!! Almost forgot Mr. Journal Man! Amanda, Rickey's ... aquaintance.... I call her that, cuz neither me or him know WHAT the frick is these days. And I'm ready for anything. She wants us to hang out! I mean.. I miss her, of course, cuz she was in my life in a good way for about a year, and I grew fairly close to her, considering that she was the love of my best friend. Other gfs *ahem* I kinda.. I dunno, HATED. But Amanda was cool. Alot of stuff started around my birthday though, that threw a load of questions into the air. I feel that me and Rickey have gotten nowhere in our search for the truth. I'm not quite sure how he feels about it though. Well, when we get together, the threee of us, I'm literally ready for anything. And this time, we're not gonna be on her turf. Irving Mall, HAHA!!! Screw that! Too many bad memories, and more of a chance for somethin to go wrong. If we see a movie at the Irving Mall, certain people (GRRRR) could try and screw the night up. And I'm really not in the mood, this summer, to deal with some buttholes. Sorry. So, we're goin to Grapevine Mills. Me and Rickey halfway know our way around that joint, and things should go ok. And if anything happens, me and her are gonna go at it. She's on thin ice with me. So many bad things I've heard about her, and a couple good things. So anything bad happens, I'm jumpin down her throat. 

So I guess that's all for now, Mr. Journal Man! I'll hollar at you later when something goes down, either in my house, out in public, or the crazy house, also known as my mind. Catch ya later!"

"event","It's been awhile, for whoever reads my journal. Yeah I deleted my last post, but it's ok. What I wanna talk about is totally different from what was in the post that got deleted. So you wanna get to know the REAL Josh? Well guys and gals, here goes. I was born in a small city in Ca, called Vellejo. I lived there until I was three years old. That's when I moved down here to Texas. I started my social life in a daycare at 4, met a cool guy named Andy. We were best friends til I turned 5. I really don't know what happened to him. I think I've heard stuff about him gettin in trouble with the law from my aunt, who happens to have a kid at her daycare who's a brother of Andy. Anyways, when I was 6, right when I got out of kindergarten, I met this dude named Rickey. It seemed like we clicked right there, and here we are today. We've been best friends since, I'm almost 18 now. If you look at my life, you will see what some would think is a neverending black hole. I grew up with a couple of friends, none even close to my boy Rickey. Life was rather smoothe until I hit the 5th grade. That's when I switched to an all-black school. I mean, no offense to African Americans that are reading this, but the 100 or so that I met were pretty friggin hateful. I went through 2 years of that hell known as Maynard Jackson Vanguard School. Right when I got to school, kids immediately saw me as the fat white boy. They didn't give a crap about me! All they cared about was getting more friends by making everyone laugh at my expense. They would spend all 8 hours making my life a living hell, making fun of anything that they thought was wrong about me. Now, this torture was consuming my thoughts. Day in, day out, the same thing, over and over. It became a problem soaking through my skin. You could see it in my school work. I went to L.A. Stemmons from 1st-4th grade, with some of the best grades you could ever see from a kid. The lowest grade I got in all my years at that school on a report card was an 87. But when I went to M.J., that faded to but a memory. My grades started to slip. Even when I wasn't being made fun of at school, I could hear those voices tormenting me til I mentally bled to death time after time. Then I went to a private school, when I started my 7th grade year. Wow, this was a god school. I was used to the verbal bashing, but at this school, it only happened (and still happens) few times and fairly far between. In the Christmas of 97, my g-pa died. And not to mention, I stopped caring about school half way through the 5th grade. I met a couple of friends, and life was ok I guess, but of course, I failed that year. Failing the 7th grade turned out to be one of the most surprising blessings in disguise. The following year, I met some people. The first half of that school year, I was the social outcast. I didn't really give a crap about the work, and I didn't like any of the guys in my class, cuz, well, they were buttholes. If one of ya are reading this, sorry, but it's the way I saw ya. Half way through that year though, in the 2nd semester, I met 2 girls and got to know em. Kalli and Phone-Phet. These 2 girls led my life in a positive direction. I was shy around them at first. Don't get me wrong, I didn't like them like that, but I had just grown up with no girl-friends. It was a harder thing to adjust to than you would think. I got to know em, and it became like... I dunno... they were ""some of tha guys"". I look up to them, and it's really cool. I love them to death. I developed a crush on Kalli later on, that wasn't out in the open until 9th grade. I went through some serious depression with that. No offense Kalli if you're readin this, but this killed me. It was my first crush, and I didn't know how to del with this kinda stuff. It turned out she didn't like me, big surprise ya know? Heh. I cried endless oceans of tears about it. I went through much depression of so many things through childhood and my life, though it may not seem as bad to any of you. But when you think about it, mental scars ARE mental scars right? Who's to judge how hurt someone can be by something eh? I don't really know what else to say about my life as far as the biography goes. Just that. Rickey... Kalli... Phet... I love you and never want you guys to be out of my life.

Now, this is where you can see into my soul and find out what has gone on with Josh in the summer of 2002. The only word  that I can think of is ""Bad"".

Nothing has gone good for me. Not ONE thing. I have only left the house to go out and do something once since school got out, and that was to go to six flags on a date with a girl who stood me up. I was gonna go to a concert, but that got cancelled, so I've half way turned my back on 12 Stones, screw you guys. Haven't listened to your cd since I got the email. I've talked to Rickey some... I've filtered the crap-people (otherwise known as ex-friends) out of my life. I have found out that I failed the 10th grade, yay that's another one for the books. I got in endless arguments with my dad, almost walked out of the house on 2 occasions. Oh and by the way, fellow classmates! Remember that cut you saw on my chin that day? And how I said I cut myself shaving.? No, when my dad grabbed my jaw and slammed me against the hallway wall, he must've accidentally clawed my chin. Sorry for lying guys, but I didn't wanna have to explain myself to the 10 people that asked what happened how my dad did it. Lemme see... this summer has also been extremely boring. Rickey is gone on a trip right now, and I think Kalli's leaving tomorrow. I was gonna talk to Phet on AOL tonight, but I got a friggin phone call from a friend that was stayin at SMU, so yeah. Sorry Phet, I really do miss you. I have sat down the entire summer on the computer, cuz nothing has happened. Since about the 2nd week in June, I have reeked of a lonely, fat slob who has no signs of an outside life. I feel like no one cares, when I'm like not on the phone with the R man. I feel worthless, like a nothing. Music is the only friend that I can seem to touch this summer. My life is changing right before my eyes. I know of a certain face that I think I'm gonna have to be around all year in my 10th grade repitition year. I'm not gonna name any names, but it's gonna be a bumpy ride heh. To tell the truth, I was almost looking forward to public school til my dad told me that he was keeping me in CWA... the reasons of that are not to be revealed in this journal, or to anyone but Rickey. All I can say about next school year in CWA, is, I hope I'm ok. Nothin illegal will go down, but I just dunno what's gonna happen. My values, and the way I look at life, has changed dramaticly over the last month. All of the preceeding has been why I consider my life a game that someone is laughing non-stop at. I just beg. Whoever is in charge of this summer... give me something that makes me half-proud to be Joshua Daniel Jensen. Cuz right now... I hate myself.

To finish this entry off, I'll use a phrase coined from an MTV show:

""You think you know, but you have no idea""

This.... is the diary... of Josh Jensen."

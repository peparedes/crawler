"event","I'm beginning to really love my weekends. Friday I had my math exam that suprisingly went really well, then goniometry lab, then pictures for the athletic training board, then lunch with Jill (and we had a really good chat), then training room from 1:30 til 5 and got to talk to Becky and get some things taken care of. Then Becky drove me to my  car and I went back to campus and waited for KT to get there. Then I wandered around with her until Renee and Kim got there, then we went into the theatre and saw the funniest, most random movie I have seen in a long time... it was kooky! Then we wandered around campus a lil more, took a picture under the ""I love female orgasms"" poster (that sadly, i guess didn't turn out.) Then we stopped at the pint and left right away to head to Out N About to play some pool. Such a good time... lots of laughing and random pictures and someone actually looked at Renee and I as if we were together.. that's amusing.

Saturday- woke up when Jeremy got to the house to drop Sadie off for the weekend then I got ready for work. Went to work Mite Sports soccer from 8:45-10:30, then right to work outside soccer in the cold from 10:45-4 (brrrrr....), then home to eat and shower and feed the dogs, then at 6 headed out to Oshkosh, grabbed dinner with Beth and Andrea, then headed to play pool and met up with Natalie, then went to Perkins so Nat could eat, then took Beth and Andrea back to Andi's dorm and I headed home before I fell asleep, hehe. Called my wife and talked to her until my phone died. Then got home around 1:30 am and called her back to let her know i made it safely and ended up talking on-line and on the phone with her and figuring things out and having a really good chat until 4 am. Then i passed out and woke up at frickin 9:30, then fed the dogs and laid around and had a lazy day until i had to work at the kennel club from 5-7, then home and cleaned up so i could be on mom's good side (especially so i can ask her if kat can stay over for a weekend.) So yeah... that was pretty much my weekend. This weekend is already filling up and the weekend after that hopefully kat will be here  Otay.. i better head to pool, i gotta brush up on my skills. Take care everyone and have a gay day!!!!"

"event","Lately I've been concentrating really hard on not stressing myself out and i'm doing a lot better than i would have in the past. School is well school, difficult for me like usually but that's my own fault... I need to apply myself more and I should be fine. I had an A&P 2 lecture exam Tuesday that I went well and really fast which scares me, either i knew the material or i knew nothing and i sucked... i'll find out soon enough i guess. This morning I had a math exam and i actually feel pretty good about how i did on that one, which is a first for me when i comes to math. But if I need any help I know i'll be goin to Kate since she offered to help and she wants to be a math teacher. Other than that, i'm struggling a little in modalities but I'm gonna go over that with Becky today at practice along with Matrix stuff so i can get my fleece. She had a lil chat with me yesterday about my academics, just to see how i'm doing cuz if I don't get my shit in order this semester i'm out of the program.  And that would definently be a heart breaker. But the upside would be going to live with Kat... who proposed to me Wednesday night and I said yes (who says you need to meet before getting engaged, hehe.) So that made my week... now we just have to meet. 

Let's see what else has been goin on... Charlie had another aglility trial last Saturday and since i had to work my mom ran her... she qualified and took 1st in both of her runs. So she got her title in novice standard agility and got her first leg (out of 3) in jumpers with weaves. Frankie was my date to one of my ex-boyfriend's weddings last Friday, it was fun and we got a family picture which was nice. Saturday I worked, then was in the play and i even did my own make-up this time (and it wasn't clown make-up) but mommy would have been so proud. OH! Last Thursday I met KT, Meredith, and Danielle and the Pint... it was a nice laid-back night of shooting darts and pool. Lots of laughs and Meredith not being able to breathe, and Danielle being my Cheerleader while i played against one odd guy, and moving machines and falling off of chairs.. just a great night.

This weekend, let's see today i had my math class, then have to go over some AT stuff before get our pictures taken, then Training room, then LGBT Film Festival with KT, Renee, and Kim and who knows who else. Then tomorrow work 8:45-4, then heading out to Oshkosh to see the girls i've missed SO much, then home to dog-sit for my monsters. Sunday, SLEEPING IN!!!!, then getting up to go over school stuff, then work at agility 5-7, then early bedtime to start the week again. Hope everyone has a good one. Take care! 
If anyone wants to donate blood at UWM on Wed. Oct. 19th let me know.. I have to find two volunteers. I would do it, but can't... cuz of the tattoo and becuz 3 times in a row i've nearly passed out... but mainly the tattoo, otherwise i would."

"event","Tuesday started off with my yoga instructor not showing and Thursday started off the same way. But she did e-mail us last night, letting us now that there was a mix up in the classroom location and we will start class next week. Ya think she would have e-mailed us, on Tuesday when no one showed up, ah well. Went to my pool class and had some fun there. Then wandered on my break and got to talk to Lena and got to see KT and Renee, so I wandered with them for a lil bit. Then went to my modalities class, then dropped Elizabeth and Kelly off at Whitefish Bay high school then went to Becky's for about an hour to let the dogs out. Grabbed a bite to eat there and then headed to MATC. Had my A&P 2 lecture, that's a long 3 hours, then ran home to get more clothes, then met KT and Renee at the Pint for some pool. I lost to Renee, then beat KT (had an awesome move where I jumped the ball it bounced off on side all the way across to bounce off the other side then all the way across to land in the side pocket... if i meant to do it, it would have been awesome and had it not been the cue ball) After that, headed back to Becky's to relax, talk to Kat, text message with Kate, then fall asleep.

I was out like a baby, until I scared myself awake at 4 a.m.... managed to get back to sleep until about 5:45 when I got up to let the dogs outside to run around. I get a couple extra winks in, got up showered, fed the dogs, let them out again, then off to my 8 am math class that i'm now on the waitlist for. Now i have a break til 11 then i have seminar until 1 cuz we're doin our CPR stuff, which since i'm already current i don't have to go to. But it's something that i don't mind getting extra practice in, and i'm sure other people (if i ever need to use it) won't mind either. After that i'll pry run home and spend time with Charlie and take her to the kennel club to get some practice in before the trial. then run to the bank and city hall, then back to becky's pry for the night. to relax and watch movies or do homework (whichever i choose.) tomorrow i have to be to the kennel club to work around 7:30am and i'll pry stay until like 2ish. Then run to becky's, then head to Klotsche to help out with the volleyball tournament. Then back to Becky's for my last night of staying there. Sunday is Charlie's agility trial, her section or whatever starts no earlier than 11 and no later than ???. I'm nervous, but I can't let her sense that. Hopefully we'll do well... we have two runs. If people wanna come watch, let me know... i'll pry get there early and watch the higher competitions. Her next trial will be Oct. 1st in Menomonee Falls. Alrighty... that's it for now. I found out that at Becky's I can't get my e-mail or onto AIM, so if you wanna talk give me a call or send me a text message. Take care everyone. Hope classes are off to a good start, and that everyone has a fun and safe weekend."

"event","So I've been attempting to have a summer vacation in what's left of my summer, so far so good:

Last week Sunday- after I worked at agility I headed out to meet up with Andrea and we played a couple games of pool and then went and picked up Beth to go back to Andrea's to watch a couple movies.

Tuesday- I was in the training room 7:30 til 12:15, then mom and I went to Noodles, then I went back in the training room from 1:15 til 5:30ish. Then Elizabeth and I ran to Southridge and grabbed food and did a lil shopping, but didn't find natalie's necklace. So we headed out to Mayfair and I found a necklace for her, then I took Elizabeth home and I stopped by Sara to say hi for a lil bit. Then went and picked up Mariya and took her home and we watched Crank Yankers and then I headed home.

Monday- I took Beth back home, then went with Natalie back to Oshkosh to meet up with Andrea for breakfast then we all headed out to Appleton mall, then Nat dropped me back off at my car and I headed to get my tattoo. Then I went to agility, then home to pass out.

Skipping to Friday- Game Day! I took Charlie to the kennel club to run for a lil bit, then came home and showered then went out to Sheboygan to pick up Shana. Then waited for mom to come home and we all packed the car as quickly as possible and then headed to Kiley's. Then me, Shana, Ki, and Kelsey ran to Grand Ave. to get Brewers stuff. Then we picked up Elizabeth and we were off, til I got lost. My loving cousin got me on the right way and we made it. Then we got there and the grill didn't want to start. But we got that going and everyone had a good time. Everyone would be, me, lori, kiley, kelsey, shana, lp, jill, erica, jimmy, justin, kim, emily, elizabeth, beth, andrea, natalie, jen, rachel, jess, mariya, mallori, amanda, heather, nate, heather's brother, my mom and dad. I didn't get to see much of the game but I was more happy to see everyone else before school starts and I disappear again. I think my favorite part was tailgating again after the game. Then I went and stayed over at Kiley's and we alll got there and went to bed.

Saturday- I had to get up to go in the training room for a lil bit, then me, shana, kiley, and kelsey went out to breakfast... then i took shana back to sheboygan. then i came home and emptied out the car, took a shower, and got prettied up for the wedding reception. It was a nice reception, but I kept crying... so i called beth and got myself calmed down enough to go back into the reception, then i took my dad out to slow dance and started crying (cuz i was crying about him in the first place), then out took my brother out on the floor and cried a lil more. Then I went to call Kat and near the end of the night got to talk to her a lil bit, then DJ and I had a really good heart to heart (i love my brother.) Went home and talked to Kat a lil more and went to bed.

Sunday- I got up and went out to breakfast with my parents, then picked up my pictures from the game. Ran home to shower and head out to Kelly's for a lil random get together. It was nice to see her again for a lil bit and just relax. Then came home and went to work at agility. Came home and talked on-line, found out some stuff that really upset me and put me in tears again. Called my love (Kat) and talked to her til I sent her to bed, then aroun 6 am i finally got to sleep for about 4 hours.

Skipping to today- Wrokin at city hall til 11:15ish, then goin to lunch, then headin to UWM to have a meeting with Dr. Earl about how my semester is gonna go.. aka hearing i need to do better and what not. Then headin out by beth to see her and andrea and hopefully natalie and maybe jen before beth leaves to go back to stout. How sad... i'm gonna miss my lil sis.

Alrighty, i'll update again sometime, for now i have to go shred papers. Take care everyone. Happy Birthday Christine!"

"event","So, I'm workin at City Hall right now and my phone just died, cuz I passed out last night before I put it in my charger... so now it's in my car charging, it's sad.

Anywho, Friday night I got home to a box on my porch and found our it was from Lori... it was 3 cute stuffed turtles... so i called to thank her and talked to her for a lil bit, then I ended up going to State Fair with my parents and met up with my brother, his wife, and their friends to watch our cousins band play. I got home around 1:30ish and went to bed shortly after.

Saturday, I woke up at 6:15 to be to UWM by 8 for AT stuff, left around noon then went back at 3 til 6:30... it was an interesting day and got to talk to Becky a lil bit. After the training room I headed to the Cheesecake Factory, cuz Darrin, Jenny, and Frankie wanted to buy my parents and I dinner for helping out with Frankie so much. It wasn't necessary, but really good. Then I drove around for a couple hours, then headed to Out N About to meet up with Riley, KT, and Stacey. I had a couple good chats with KT. Left ONA around 1:15ish. Got home, talked to Kat on-line for a lil bit then headed to bed.

Sunday I woke up at 6:15 to leave by 6:45 to go work at a Dog Confirmation show with Deb. It was pretty interesting to do and then we did a lil shopping afterwards... my poor dog is so spoiled, I even bought something for Taryn. Then I went home for a lil bit amd then headed to work at agility from 5-8... I got home and caught Emily on-line and we ended up heading to Alterra and chatting for a lil while. I love when we can just sit and talk and just pick up wherever we left off. I got to talk to Dana on my way to Em's and then gave Kat a call on my way home. I talked to her, Nicole, Beth (and Andrea) on-line until like 3ish... then passed out for a lil bit, woke up at 4:30 quickly cleaned Sweet Pea then went to sleep until 9. I got up showered talked to Lori, Steph, and Ashley on-line for a lil bit... came into work at City Hall from 11:15 til whenever I leave, then I have agility with Charlie tonight from 7-8 and then being the agility assistant from 8 til 9ish. Then pry an early bedtime. That's it for now... back to work.

"event","This was an emotionally wearing week, to the point that I was talking to Becky about my semester for Athletic Training and that if I don't get all my shit in order this semester that I'm done with the program and while talking to her I started crying a lil bit. Started off with on Monday spending the day doin Athletic Training stuff from 8:30 til 4ish, then grabbing dinner at La Funtes with Kiley and Shana, the rushing to class with Charlie and working for an hour, and coming home and talking to Kristin. Which that conversation didn't go so well, considering I felt like shit when it was going on and when it was over. Cuz I had to tell someone that I like, that I only like them as a friend... I've never had to do that before and it sucks. Cuz she is a very nice person and extremely caring and got along very well with my family, but sadly the feelings were no longer there, no matter how hard I tried. But I don't want to lose her as a friend, so I had to do what I did, when I did it. It still sucks, but everything happens for a reason and I know that she will find someone. Tuesday I got to pick up Frankie from school and spend the night with him... we went to a soccer clinic and he played on the playground, then out for dinner, then back to my house to watch Harry Potter and go to sleep. He got my bed and I got the floor. Wednesday, I forgot that kids don't sleep-in so at 8:30 he goes it's time to wake up... so I put Harry Potter back in, the made us some Cinnamon Rolls, then went swimming, shopping, dinner, then to agility. Thursday I helped with physicals, talked to Becky, then had the water carnival at the pool, then went out to dinner with my staff. Today I'm working at City Hall til I finish this, then off to the pool til 4ish to do inventory and clean up since it's the last day of this season. Then goin to State Fair tonight, with maybe my mom, Jenny, Darrin and I dunno who else yet. Saturday I'm doing AT stuff all day, getting dinner with DJ, Jenny, my parents, and Frankie.. then goin out hopefully. Sunday getting up early, then of course stayin busy. That's it for now... gotta go. Call if ya need."

"event","It's about damn time that it's Friday! Today I'm working at city hall 8-5 with no breaks, then headin right over to the pool from a lil after 5 until about 9ish. But it's pay day, the last night of lessons, mine and kristin's 2 month anniversary, and i get to hang out with Riley tonight. So I'm going to make it a good day, no matter what.

Tomorrow I get to sleep in a lil bit or maybe I'll get up early and go steal Frankie, then at noon me, my brothers, my sister-in-law, Frankie, Sesha, and all our dogs are going to get together to take a group picture to give to my mom for her birthday. And then I might get to meet Kat and then I'm hoping to get the hell out of the Oak Creek area. I may head out to Stevens Point and meet up with Stacey for Pride... it's still up in the air, I guess I'll decide tomorrow.

Sunday I'm going to State Fair with my family for most of the day and then working at agility 5-8 and I get to be with Deb tomorrow so I can't bite my nails or she smacks me, HARD! Then I'm heading over to Elizabeth's apartment to spend time with her and crash there for the night, cuz Monday we have our Athletic Training Student workshop most of the day. I can't wait to see everyone again, well there's a couple I could go without seein.

Things with Frankie and his mom are good for now. His mom was originally going to only get probation, but because Jenny made a statement her mom is being put in jail for 3 months and is not allowed to have ANY contact with Frankie for that time, and then has I believe 3 years of probation which includes anger management classes, parenting classes, drug and alcohol rehab, and the judge let her have it. The judge was great I guess and just ripped this woman apart and told her that she will not let her ruin another life of a child. Jenny said that there is no way that her mom will ever handle the probation and in the mean time Frankie is staying with DJ and Jenny. I'm glad they got the judge they did and that Jenny made a statement.

Well, I suppose I better get back to looking like I'm working. Only about an hour and a half until my boss is bringing me lunch... it's her thank you for me not leaving for lunch today. Hope everyone has a good weekend.

P.S.- Lori~ they have a bunch of the Advanced notebooks at the Wally World by me right now, I bought a few last night. :-P"

"event","Frankie's mom is going to court today to get her sentence and Jenny has to make a statement stating that she wants her mom put in prison. I hope she gets locked up and never gets Frankie back, but the court gets to decide that... just look at her past, it's obvious that this little boy that has a chance at a great future should stay with DJ and Jenny. This woman already has 3 daughters that want nothing to do with her, she wasn't even invited to Jenny's wedding... she drinks and does drugs around this little 5 year old. Which is the reason that she choked him in the first place and luckily threw a chair through the window so the neighbor heard and came to Frank's rescue. And she says that she didn't do it, it was one of her other personalities. And she is confusing the hell out of Frank... this lil guy is torn between living in a nice house with people who love him, have never hurt him, and are firm but fair and going back to live with his mother. There's nothing that we can do about it, but hope for the best and it sucks... cuz what if the system fucks up again, then what? Who will stop her next time, cuz we sure as well won't ever see him again. This sucks! I love him and it was so cute as I was heading out to my car last night he shouted out the door... ""I Love You Lindsay"" I love him as if he really was my nephew and look forward to anytime I get to spend time with him. He's a great kid, a typical 5 year old at times, but he's learning and I love him so much."

Here is your horoscope for Friday, July 29:

After several days of hard work -- seriously hard work -- you're quite ready to 
spend some time pursuing some equally serious recreation. Get busy on that last 
project as soon as possible. You've earned it.

I am so ready for the weekend to be here... cuz this weekend I don't think I have anything really going on yet, except for checking on a couple dogs... but i can sleep in both days!!! And finally clean the inside and outside of my car and relax and see kristin and not think all weekend. Plus it's Beth's birthday, just wait hun.. soon your gonna be old like me. ;-) So maybe I'll get to see or talk to her.
I can't believe this month is almost over. Only like two more weeks of the pool for the summer... thank god! Only there goes my big paychecks and it's back to working at city hall and looking somewhat spiffy for work, instead of wearing a swimsuit and board shorts to work. Well i'm gettin outta here and gettin back to the pool. I'll have to update more later, when i have more time... so maybe this weekend. :-D Take care all, hope you all have a great weekend."

"event","barely, but i am still alive... let's see where i left off
FRIDAY- i worked at city hall til 1ish, then at the pool 1:15-4-15, then was field supervisor 5:30-10:30 and kristin came to bring me dinner, keep me company, and kick the soccer ball around with me. so time went by faster. then charlie and i went and had a sleepover with Kristin and Buzz. Somehow the Charlie and Buzz got like 95% of the bed.
SATURDAY- left Kristin's to take Charlie home and pack dress clothes for dinner, casual dress for after, and a swim suit) and get a shower and get back to Kristin's. mom dropped me off at Kristin's and we hit the road to somewhere. after a while kristin had me cover my eyes until we got to our destination. she finally let me uncover my eyes when we got to a Holiday Inn somewhere i couldn't figure our where we were, then we went to our room which was very nice and changed for our dinner reservations. so we started to head outside and she said she forgot her bag, so i thought nothin of it and waited outside.. then we got in her jeep and she handed me a rose, then had me cover my eyes again. when we stopped i looked around and we were at the Fireside. originally she told me Beauty and the Beast wasn't playing til later in the year and the show now was sold out... instead Beauty and the Beast was playing now and she had 2nd row, center seats, LIAR! ;-) so we went in and had a delicious dinner (especially the mashed potatoes) and then looked around the shops a lil bit, then went into the show. They did an excellent job. Then we went back to the hotel and on the bed was one more suprise, a dozen red roses... forgot your bag, my ass, hehe.
SUNDAY- let Kristin sleep in til like 11, then got ready to leave and left like right at noon and stopped at Jimmy John's for a quick bite. then headed back to Milwaukee and went to her place and watched Soroity Boys then she took me home so i could get to work. worked 4:45-8ish. then stopped at picked up steph, then went to pick up sara. we all stopped at Wendy's for a quick bite to eat and ran into emily there, then i dropped off Steph and Sara and i went home and she went to sleep in my bed and i made my bed on the couch. i fell asleep around 11:30.
MONDAY- woke up around 3:30 for my dad and i to take sara to O'Hare. we stopped and ate at McDonald's and headed our way to IL. we dropped off sara and headed back home. i took a lil nap when i got back home and then woke up to get to the pool by 8:30 and worked there til 10, then right to city hall til noon then right back to the pool til 3:45. then Kristin and i took Charlie and Bailey to agility. I ran Charlie or at least tried to and then ran Bailey. then went home and made a pizza for Kristin and I, then went back to the Kennel Club to work 8-8:45. Went home and went to sleep, cuz i needed it.
TUESDAY- ummmm... i worked at the pool 8:30-10:15, then right to city hall til 1-4:15, then out to dinner with grandma gene and my parents, then picked up Kristin and we stopped at the pool to check on my staff, then headed out to Madison, Stoughton, back to Stoughton, and then finally made it to Beth in Madison. Gave her the check, then ran to the grocery store with her, then got back and headed back to Milwaukee. I dropped off Kristin and then headed home and crashed right away.
WEDNESDAY- worked at the pool 8:45 til 10:15, came to City Hall til noon, ran to pick up a card for Nikki, then worked at the pool til 3:45, stopped to get breakfast, lunch, and dinner (3 tacos), found out Kristin got her flowers delivered to her, then stopped at home and went back to the pool 5:15-9ish, then came outside to Kristin waiting for me. So we got to spend a lil time with her which was nice, since i was gettin crabby and stressed out.
TODAY so far- didn't want to get out of bed, but had to. came into work at city hall at 9 until 1, then i'm workin at the pool from 1:15 til 4:15ish, then spending time with Kristin.
You know how summer is usually a time to relax and what not and not be as busy. Well, mine is opposite, my summer is exteremely busy, just like i always am. And because of that it leads me to get crabby and want my sleep and not want to be disturbed when i'm sleeping or trying to get some extra sleep, unless it's for something important like your dying or something. Cuz I know i'll be crabby, especially in the morning. Ask my parents, Kristin, Lori, my co-workers. The only summer vacation i get our my weekends and my nights and because of that they fill up quickly with things with Kristin, my family, or my friends. Sometimes, i just need time to relax and worry about things that are going on in my life, like possibly losing Frankie. That's it for now... hope everyone is doing well and i'll talk to ya'll later. I miss some of you. :-P buhbye!"

"event","It's finally Friday!! And even better, it's pay day!!! How exciting! I actually survived this week, i'm not sure how many hours I worked... i know my hours I put in tonight will put me into overtime. OT at my higher rate of pay, I'm not complaining... my supervisor might though. Ah well.
Wednesday I woke up in Kristin's arms and then she booted me out of bed to go to my in pool in-service to work on my lifeguarding skills. But all I did was swim a 250, shallow water spinal skills, and one deep water spinal then Mary Jane pulled me out of the pool to observe and warm up cuz she said I looked grey and still really sick and not strong enough to do the skills. Even after I got like 12 hours of sleep the night before. After that I ran and let Buddy out then went back to the pool for open swim and was there from 12:15 til 4:15, then ran home quick to let our dogs out and visit Charlie and then stopped and let Buddy out. Then ran and picked up Kristin and we went to Outback for dinner. Then we went back to her place and watched Miss Congeniality 2, I've been wanting to see that for the longest time.
Thursday- i woke up and cleaned up Bev's house and got all my stuff in my car, then dropped off my expensive things at home then came to work at City Hall from like 9:30 til 1, then worked at the pool from 1:15 til 4, grabbed some lunch then went back to the high school from 5:15 til 9:30. Then went to watch the end of DJ's softball game and then went home and caught up with a couple people on-line.
Today- i finally rolled out of bed at 9, showered very quickly and got to work at like 9:35, hehe. I'm workin here at city hall til 1 (bev paid me for staying at her house, so i got paid twice on pay day, hehe), then headin to the high school til 4:15ish, then i get to be softball field supervisor tonight from 5:30 til 10ish. But Kristin is coming to keep me company there so it'll go by fast.  Then I'm not sure where I'm sleeping tonight cuz Kristin just offered to have Charlie and I crash at her place, i'll have to see. Cuz I know charlie's missed me this past week, and i've missed her. I'll have to see.
Tomorrow- KIDNAPPING DAY! hehe, i've never been so excited about being kidnapped. but first i have to stop at a graduation party at noon and say hi, and then Kristin is kidnapping me around 2:30 and we're coming back on sunday. my mom knows where i'm going and her family and i have no idea. but don't worry dana you will hear from me by monday, i warned kristin... so she'll make sure i'll call cuz she doesn't want to be arrested, hehe. no sense of adventure, just kiddin hun. ;-)
I hope everyone has a great weekend, i'm sure i will and i'll be sure to update about it when i get back. take care!"

Saturday: left Kristin's to go let Buddy and shower, then headed to City Hall to run a policies in-service for only one out of the four employees that were supposed to be there, then ran home to spend a lil time with Buddy until DJ called, then went and picked up Frankie and headed out to TRY and find Kristin's Tae Kwon Do demonstration, we failed at that so we played at Whitnall Park instead then met Kristin at Baskin Robins for ice cream, stopped at Kristin's to drop off her Jeep and grab her stuff for the Dells, ran to a graduation party at Grant Park for a lil bit (it was cute to watch Kristin and Frankie fencing with balloons), then let Buddy out and ran to another graduation party where i had a lot of fun playin with Frankie and trying to tired him out (even if I looked like an idiot), dropped Frankie off at my parents and ran to feed Kristin and let Buddy out, then went back to put Frankie to bed and we watched Ice Age with him. Then we had to leave and he cried, then Kristin and I went back to Bev's for bed.
Sunday: Kristin had the chore of waking my ass up by 6, got ready for the Dells, went to get gas and a quick car wash, then went to my parents to wake up Frankie and get him ready and eat a lil breakfast with him, then DJ and Jenny came over and we all left for the Dells. Frankie decided he wanted to ride out there with Kristin and I, luckily we fell asleep for the last hour or so. We met Jeremy and Sesha out there at Burger King for breakfast, then all of us went mini-golfing (mom and Kristin won on the girls team), then the 8 and a half of us went on the ducks and got a cute group picture that my mom ended up buying, then we went to Mt. Olympus and before Kristin and I could do anything there it was 2 and we had to leave. So we drove back (i was not a happy camper) and I just made it back to work right at 5 and worked til 8. Then Kristin came over and watched Super Troopers with me and we did a lil trigger point massage on eachother.
Monday: worked at City Hall 8-11, then at the pool 12-4 (with a fire drill in there, when we had to clear the pool), agility with Charlie 5-6, agility assitstant 7-9, then ran by Kristin's for some dinner which she made and was very delicious. Back to Bev's for bedtime.
Today: working at City Hall 9-12:45, letting Buddy out then headin to the pool until 4:15ish, then back to let Buddy out, then back to the pool 6ish-9, then spending time with Kristin since she has off tomorrow.
That's it for now. Have a great week everyone."

We had donuts cuz Kristin we sweet enough to go pick me up a bagel from Dunkin Donuts and some donuts for me and my co-workers. And they got to meet the person that sent me the flowers that are sitting on my desk.

Wednesday after work I picked up Frankie from school took him for dinner, stopped for ice cream, then gave him to my parents and went to watch Kristin play a lil soccer, then wen't back to Bev's to watch The Incredibles. Yesterday after work and running an in-service Kristin, Steph, Nicole and I went bowling and I kicked ass on the second game. I got a 123, I figured out my secret of bowling. Then we dropped the youngn's off and went back to the place I'm dog-sitting at, it was nice to wake up in her arms again. Which made it even harder to get out of bed this morning, but I got up and dragged me feet the whole time. Tonight I'm either going to Kristin's and she's cooking dinner or I'm gettin a fish fry with family (I'd rather have the first one.) Tomorrow I have to run an in-service, then I'm spending the day with Frankie and Kristin. Sunday I'm going to the dells with my parents, brothers, sister-in-law, Sesha, Frankie, and MAYBE Kristin. But I have to be home by 4:30 to go to work. Anywho, I'll update again after the weekend. Hope everyone has a great weekend, take care."

She said I'm doing much better and taking care of myself really well, hopefully I won't need to go back, but if I need it I won't hesitate. Then worked at City Hall 10:30-5. Then went out to a fish fry with my parents and Kristin. Then we played a lil soccer in my driveway (until i slightly sprained my ankle, oops) but we pulled a few moves on eachother, and I did a suprise attack on her, hehe. Then we went to her parents house and I met her mom and sister, they are so nice and funny. Then we went to go see ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" then stopped out at ONA for a lil bit. And I BEAT KRISTIN AT DARTS!!! And the last two darts I was looking at her, instead of the board, talk about luck.

Saturday= woke up at 7:05, to get to work at 7:30 (oops) then worked til 9, grabbed breakfast with my parents, ran home to get a shower and pack quick, then picked up Steph and headed to the Y, we watched the white belts and yellow belts test then i ran Steph back home to get her bag and then back to the Y, we missed Kristin's sword demonstration and the beginning of her testing, but we did get to see her break boards, but we missed the last one cuz we were layin on the ground and she jumped over us to break it. It was awesome and she got promoted to red belt. Stopped at her place to drop off her jeep and have a mini-pinning match (i won), then went to check into the hotel, and took Steph to the IMAX to meet up with her sister, then back to the hotel to drop off my car, then walked to Pride. It was great, I saw so many people that I knew. Got to see my girls and pretty much walked around with Kristin, Shana, Kiley, Beth, Sandi, and Kate most of the time. Then Kate went back to the hotel to get a quick nap. After the fireworks Shana decided that we were gonna go to ONA with them, so we barely caught the shuttle back to our hotel, picked up Kate and the 5 of us headed to ONA for a couple hours. It was a lot of fun. Such a great day!

Sunday= woke up to housekeeping at 9, found out from Kristin that I ended up talking in my sleep (guess I was really tired),  Kate left at 10:30, Kristin and I checked out about noon, then took the shuttle back to Pride. We got to hang out with Sara for a lil bit, then see Mary Beth and Anita, and left around 3:30 to take the shuttle back to the hotel, then I took Kristin home and I ran home so I could get to agility from 5-8. Went home and Kristin brought Buzz over to meet my monsters and we sat outside talkin and my mom came out to talk to us for a lil bit. Went home and went on-line for a lil bit, had a lil chat with my mom about the weekend and then crashed for the night.

Today= work 8-4, agility with Charlie 5-6, agility assistant 8-9ish, sleepytime! Just in case, today my phone is deciding it hates me and doesn't want to stay on at all, course I was on it a lot this weekend meeting up with people so it worked hard and I think I killed it... glad I have a replacement in the car.

If anyone else needs a place to crash for some reason or another let me know. People can crash on the floor if they want, just give me like $5-10. It's a business room so I don't know what it's gonna be like, but there are two double beds so people can fight over the other bed, but that'll be more money than the floor. So yeah... let me know. Especially if your gonna be drinking... just plan on staying, cuz like i said, it's supposed to be only 6 blocks away."

This week has been really good so far, a lil boring at work. But I'm doing so catch-up stuff that other people don't want to do or don't have time to. I don't mind it, it's work and money in my pocket.

Monday: I work 8-4, then left to take Charlie to class at 5 and she did so well. I need to get her into some matches. Then ran home, to go back at 8 to be the assistant and be dinner for the damn mosquitos.

Tuesday: Worked 8-5, then went right to Kristin's and we headed for dinner. We went to Japanica and it was so good and we got to talk a lot while we were waiting. Then we headed back to Oak Creek to pick up Steph and take her bowling with us (so we could get her out of her house for a lil bit.) It was fun even though I lost to BOTH of them twice, but I blame my shoulder (no matter what Steph thinks.) :-P So after my ""beating"" in the parking lot, we ran to Culver's (oops!), then we dropped Steph off and went back to Kristin's for a lil bit. Talked to Steph on the way home to calm her down and fell asleep when i hit my pillow.

Today: Work 8-2:30, pickin up my cousin at 3, bringing him back to my house so i can get some stuff around the house done and he can do homework, then an agility drop-in class with Charlie from 6-7, steak dinner at our house with my parents, DJ, Jenny, and Frankie for DJ's birthday today, then takin Derek home at 8 (I get to see my ""ex-aunt"" that i haven't seen in I don't know how many years) then home to call Kristin to see how her game went and get some sleep.

Tomorrow: Workin 8-5 (in charge of the Clerk's office, we're all in trouble, hehe), hair-cut at 5:30, then headin out to the Ale House to hang out with people from the Athletic Training Program.
Fri: Talkin to Mary @ 9, then work 10:30ish til 5, then possibly going to see ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" with Kristin, Ryan, and Steph... not sure yet.
Sat: Takin Steph to go watch Kristin test @ 11, then teachin her some Judo moves after... then PRIDEFEST!!! Horray, hehe! I can't wait to see everyone. Possibly stayin downtown that night at a hotel since Kate is supposed to come up form IL and Erin from Indiana.
Sun: PRIDEFEST til 3ish, then agility assistant from 5-8, then recovering from the weekend, hehe.

I met her at Out N About and was attracted to her, but to chicken to ask for her number, well Sarah and I ran into her again last week Wednesday and I got her number. We hung out Friday night with her friend Ryan, we went to LaPerla, then to ONA, then we went back to her place and watched Texas Chainsaw Massacre and I left around 4:30 in the morning. Sunday night I had my girls soccer banquet and when it was done I went out and found 2 roses sitting on my car window... it was so cute. So I called and thanked her as I headed over to her place and told her to look out her window. We ended up talking and she asked me to be her girlfriend. 

She's 23, went to Franklin high school (which even though they were our rivals, we've worked through that, hehe) and I actually played soccer against her when we were in high school. We get along great, we go back and fourth picking on eachother, and I feel really comfortable with her. I'm hoping for the best."

But at least half the team is nursing injuries so it's pry better off this way. Frankie had fun at the game, he was my little buddy. I stood behind the goal with me before the game and shagged balls that went down the hill, cuz I gave him that job. Then I told him to watch those balls and I was gonna go receicve punts from the goalie, that was fine and dandy until I see him walking out on the field and Kath and Tara taking him back behind the goal. So I ran to him, he was crying and holding his water that I bought him... he goes ""I just wanted to bring you water"" it was adorable. So he stayed by the team with me until my parents got him, then he went over by them and I guess he got upset because a ball went behind the goal and some guy got it before he did so he goes to my mom ""That wasn't very nice... that's my job!"" I love that kid and I get to baby-sit him tonight.
My friends Sarah and Kristin (both from Franklin and from ONA) came to the game as well. Sarah left like right after the game and then I asked Kristin if she wanted to get ice cream with me. So I dropped Amanda and Steph off and met Kristin at Kopp's around pry 7ish. Got some ice cream, Sarah stopped and said hi, and then we continued talking until she looked at her watch and realized it was 10. Since she had to work early we called it a night. On my way home called to check on Steph and talked to her for awhile. Then passed out before cleaning Sweet Pea.
So I woke up about 5:30 and quick cleaned Sweet Pea (to make my mom less crabby), showered, ate breakfast, made my chip dip, stopped at the store to buy chips, came to work, and here I am.
Tonight I'm baby-sittin for Frankie. Tomorrow I'm going with my mom and her old boss to Chicago to see 'Wicked' and then hanging out with Kristin. Then Sunday I have the soccer banquet so during the day I'm gonna find a gift for my 2 goalies and cards to write on for the rest of the team. Alrighty, time to get back to work.

Tuesday night I wasn't having a good night, and just wearing myself down trying to help everyone else (and feeling like i was failing badly at it.) So I just took a break and re-collected myself and then made a couple calls. Talked to one of my soccer girls and got her to make a pact with me and then we were all fine and dandy, called another one and got her to laugh and then send her to bed happy, then I called Dana back. And ""rode"" home with her to make sure she got back safely... including trying to pick out ice cream (keyword there is TRYING.)
Yesterday I worked at City Hall again 8-2, then went to soccer practice and luckily didn't have to do crosses again cuz Steph gave me a beating on Tuesday, instead I just got to play goalie again for a lil bit and had some good saves, then we did something with the girls working on rebounds off the goalie and following their shots so i got to play to part of crappy goalie (that was easy.) Then I ran home and had a lil corn on the cob and then mom and I took Charlie and Bailey to a drop-in agility class. Then I went to meet Sarah at Solid Gold McDonalds and then she talked me into going out to the bar. So we stopped at the Pint, then went to check out Out N About and ran into Kristin there so I got her number this time, then went back to the Pint to meet up with Christina and the two Rachel's. On the way home I gave Steph a call to check on her and gave her a good laugh for the night. Then I sent Dana and Kristin a text message and crashed for the night.
Today~ woke up to Kristin replying to my message at 5:30, still manage to sleep in cuz my bed was too comfy... got to work a couple minutes late (damn slow drivers!!!), been doing lots of odd projects today, leaving at 2 again to run home to get ready for soccer, then picking up my nephew to bring him to the game with me maybe get him a lil food, then picking up Steph and heading for the game. If they lose this is it... if they win then they play Saturday (but i won't be there.) I'm so proud of this team, they've come so far not just in their season, but as a team, and a great group of girls. Otay, that's it for me... back to work for another hour. Buhbye!!"

Friday: talked to Mary, worked til 4, stopped at soccer practice since I couldn't be at the game on Friday I dropped off this soccer ball thing that my sister in law gave me that says (You'll always miss 100% of the shots you don't take), stopped at the big scary house to let Kody out, went to the wedding rehersal(i looked SO cute, and i don't say that about myself, like ever), then dinner at Porterhouse, then back to the big scary house. Where I got to talk to Steph, Chris, and Dana on the phone until I started fallin asleep on the phone with each of them (sorry guys)... so I went to sleep on the couch.

Saturday: WEDDING DAY!!! Went to breakfast with mom and dad and then they dropped me off at the hair place at 8. Went over to the church to get ready for the wedding at 11, made it through the whole thing without tripping or anything, hehe. Then we went to this one park for pictures and got some fun pics, then went by the lake for a few more pics, and like all of us from the bridal party stopped at one of the hog dog vendors and bought lunch (it was amusing)along with Emily standing along Lincoln Memorial waving to the cars, we were all drinking and a great time was had by all, then we stopped at Erica and Jimmy's hotel room to relax for a lil bit, then headed to the Bavrian Inn for the reception, dinner was great, the photographers were very nice and got a lot of great shots, i was startin to get crabby cuz my feet hurt like a bitch but after the bridal party dance i put on slipper socks and then i was a dancing fool, hehe. Oh so much fun. And I felt loved cuz Shana and Kiley called to see how the wedding was... it felt great that a couple people that i haven't known that long actually took the time to ask. Got home and changed quick cuz i was gonna go meet Kiley at the bar, but by time i would have got there they would have been gone. Next time, can't wait to hang out with her, if not for her, I wouldn't be here. Sleepy time in the big scary house!

Sunday: ummmm.... oh! Gift opening in the afternoon, then went to pick up Steph and took her bowling then to Culvers for a banana split (cuz i've been craving one forever), dropped her off, checked on Kody, came home to say hi to my baby (the only girl that'll never hurt me and is always excited to see me), and ended up makin plans to go spend time with Beth, so i stopped and let Kody out one more time and headed out to Fond du Lac, then Beth, Natalie and I drove out to Neenah, stopped in Oshkosh, stopped at Perkins, then Natalie went home and Beth and I stopped to hang out with a few more of her friends and then since we got back to her house around 2 she made me stay over, so I did to wake up and leave at 6:15ish. I'm so glad I went out there, cuz it was fun to just bum around, Natalie helped me out with one of my soccer girls, Beth helped out when I started to get bummed, and she had my phone most of the night texting one of her friends since her plan doesn't include text messaging. I love her more than she knows, I'm glad I have her as my friend, I feel so comfortable around her. And Shana called me at like 1:30, kind of suprised me... it was nice to talk to her again, i miss hanging out with her.

Today: Got back to the big scary house around 7:30ish, packed all my stuff from the big scary house in the car, ran home to put soccer clothes on, picked up Steph, was very hyper at soccer from lack of sleep, played a lil goalie and had some LUCKY, but sweet saves, dropped Steph off, let Kody out one more time, came home and changed then went to the zoo with Frankie and Jenny, it was a lot of fun and Frankie is SO cute (Jenny said I'm really good with him.) 

So yeah, that's pretty much my weekend... I don't wanna go to work tomorrow. 3rd installment of taxes are due, lots of crabby people tomorrow (horray!) Oh, soccer is still goin on, the girls won in double overtime on Saturday so Thursday they enter sectionals (i'm so proud of this team, i love them.) So yeah, this week will be work, soccer, 'Wicked' in Chicago, soccer banquet and not sure what else yet. Less then 2 weeks til Pridefest! :-D Alrighty... Beth just told me I need to go to sleep right now, cuz I sound crabby, so I am. Take care everyone and I hope to see some of you at Pride. Hopefully I'll have my tattoo by then."

"event","My best friend Emily is back from school at Minnesota, and today she suprised me when she IMed me to see what I was up to tonight and I said nothing so we went out for coffee. It was nice, she had coffee and I had chocolate milk (although they had chai tea and I was very tempted to try it for some reason.) I love her to death. I met her when I was a senior and she was a freshman, we were on soccer together and I kind of took her under my wing and we became good friends. We go for long periods of time without talking but when we do, it's like we never miss a beat and no matter if one of us had a bad day we always manage to get the other one to smile. She's the first person I came out to and she supports me so much and wants to see me happy. I love her just like a sister. Otay that's it... i'm going to bed... i have work in less than 8 hours. Take care everyone and g'nite. And Beth... the mouse won't kill you and you shouldn't kill it, you should catch it and give it to me as a present. Sweet dreams :-P"

I looked up and it was Gina I just said, ""Oh, how have missed you."" So yeah... that's my fun story of the day.

"event","One of my soccer girls called me last night to ask if I was gonna be at soccer practice anymore this week. Because of school I used to be only to make it Mon., Thur., and Fri... but now that I only work and they are flexible... I told her I'm gonna be there today, tomorrow, and Thursday too and she's like good, i'm really happy that your gonna be there. I thought that was so sweet, especially since I took a shot on her today and accidently hit her in the eye. If it weren't for the girls i wouldn't still be with the team, but i'm sticking it out for my 4th season and then this is it. Cuz I can't really stand the coach and it's been really hectic to try and fit it in with school and I need money. I've been volunteering and last year the school gave me $200 which was nice... but then this year they let him hire an assistant which more or less booted my chance of any money this year. Oh well... I love the team, and they appreciate me and like me being there. Now if only coach would learn something from them."

"event","so yeah... i don't know what happened to me Friday. I had a headache most of the day and just couldn't shake it, then i felt flu-like, took care of that (yuck), made my self some chicken noodle soup, took some medicine, talked to Dana for like 4 hours, then went to sleep for like 10 hours and seemed to get rid of it.
Saturday I woke up around 10:30ish i think, relaxed a lil bit, cleaned my rabbit, took a shower, and avoided my mom's stamp party as much as possible (but i did manage to steal some of the snacks.)Then went out to Ponderosa with my mom and Grandma, then we stopped out at Southridge to get a new vacuum cleaner. Then I came home and left for Nikki's going away party. I brought her a card and wrote some nice things in it, cuz i felt that she needed someone to show support for her decision to join the Marines. As much as it sucks and no matter how much I'm gonna miss her, this is what she wants to do and she needs to have people backing her up instead of trying to hold her back. I got to her place around 11 (after taking the scenic route) and everyone was already drinking, I only had one drink... but it was a good time. I got to spend time with Nikki, Beth, Steph, Rachel, and meet a few new people. Rachel ended up making me dance everytime she saw me sitting down, it was just a crazy night. And one of the guys there was trying to get with all the girls (even though most of them didn't want him for one reason or another), and I guess he tried to rape one of the girls. So Beth was having a rough night, so i was sticking around her to keep an eye on her and be there for her. So we went inside cuz she had to use the bathroom and the one downstairs was full so the guy said he would take her to the upstairs one... i was like not without me, so he stayed downstairs. Well, Beth was staying over there so I decided to stay too to look out for her. We started off sleepin in bed in Nikki's sisters room, then got kicked out of it by Nikki and Angela so we slept on the floor and the guy ended up joining us. So on the floor it was me, then Beth, then the guy. I didn't like that idea so I pulled Beth into me and put my arm around her so i could look out for her. I felt like I was holding my little sister and protecting her. I ended up trading spots with her and putting myself in between them, bad idea for me but i protected Beth. I didn't go to sleep cuz i didn't trust him and good thing cuz he ended up tryin to feel me up. So I got like an hour of sleep last night cuz not only was I protecting myself, but the other 3 girls in the room. Anywho, we all survived and we went out for breakfast at the IHOP. And said our good-byes, I'm gonna miss Nikki so much. It didn't really hit me until I was on my way home from the Kennel Club that I won't see her until like August and I started to cry. But I'm sure she'll cross my mind everyday and I better hear from her. Plus, I got some good pics from last night, so I'll have some good memories.
Anywho... I need to get some sleep. Summer vacation is over, I'm goin into work tomorrow cuz i'm broke and Pridefest is coming up, i mean ummm... bills are due. :-P Other than working at city hall, the pool, and the kennel club... i have pridefest of course, the wedding in 6 days, Beth and I are gonna go to the zoo with my nephew and her little sister... hanging out with my friends and making new ones. I'm bound and determined to have a great summer. Otay... Sleepy time. :-)"

But that's otay today ended up to be a pretty good day, minus the 2 math exams this morning that blowed. Then I came home for about an hour, then drove out to Madison... tried on my dress again for the wedding, stayed there for about a total of 20 minutes... turned around and came back. Then headed to the Olive Garden with a couple people from work, came home bummed around a bit then headed to ONA. Got to talk to Sam the whole way there to try to help her out and get to know her a lil bit. Spent time with my girls, then headed home. Just got to talk to Beth for a lil bit, can't wait to see her again so I can do my mohawk for her.
The rest of the week is looking pretty good. Tomorrow studying my ass off, cleanin a couple pets, soccer practice, more studying, and an early bedtime (HA!).  Friday: my final final well for the semester at least(horray), home for a nap, my girls soccer game, then off to a party with ATEP people. Saturday: sleep in, avoid my mom's stamp party, and at night go to Nikki's going away party. Sunday: not sure yet, but i'm sure i'll think of something. 
Yesterday I got to go to the Ale House for lunch with a few people from ATEP to celebrate Kate's birthday... good times, good friends. Then I got to spend time with my ""nephew"" he is such a cutie, we were having fun together and he was taken lots of pictures with my camera. And last Saturday we had the bachelorette party for Erica... so much fun and i remembered it all, go me. Course the wedding is gonna be a blast too, that will have to be more alcohol in my system though cuz i have to be in a dress all day. If anyone wants to see a sight they pry won't see for a couple years, let me know. Free beer and soda. Anywho, I'm being very random tonight, so I think I'm gonna end this so I can go to bed before Charlie steals all the covers.
OH! also... last Friday I finally got to see Jess again, she came over to watch Phantom of the Opera and fell asleep on me. She thought I was mad, it was actually kind of cute. It was nice seeing her again, i've missed my lil sis. Otay, bedtime!"

"event","Last Saturday: Got my hair-cut... it was getting so long, it was almost touching the base of my neck. Then headed out to Sheboygan to meet Erin, on my way out there I almost got into a really bad accident. Some car decided he wanted to be in my lane when my front tire was in line with his back tire... by the way: slamming on your brakes when doing 80 does not go over very well. I lost control of my car and almost rolled it... but luckily there was no one else really around me and i got control again. I made it to Sheboygan got to see Shana for a lil bit and give her a hug. She had to get back home and Erin and I headed out to Oshkosh to watch Beth play in a tournament. It was really cool cuz we got to see her play and see her score. It was good to see her again. Then Erin and I headed back to Sheboygan to pick up her car and she gave me a tour of Sheboygan... that was exciting, hehe. Then we headed to Out N About to drop off her car, went to Jimmy John's for dinner, then back to ONA to grab a drink and talk til my girls got there (well, all but one :-( ... I do miss you there!) Had a couple drinks, got dragged out on the dance floor a few times, and just relaxed. It was pretty fun.
 
Yesterday: After classes I hit the road with Matt. I dropped him off in Ripon, then headed to Stout to see Beth. We left UWM at like 12:45 and I didn't get to Beth's game til 5:45... that sucked, but at least I got to see some of the second game. Then we headed to Perkin's for dinner with her dad, back to her room to hang out for a lil bit before headin to a party. Then back to the dorms to watch Love & Basketball with Dawson. I left today at 11 then Matt had to do something so I ended up bumming around Ripon (not much to do there) and finally got home at 5:30. And now I'm tired as hell... so I'm gonna go put in a movie and watch it by myself since Nikki isn't callin back (punk!) Hopefully tomorrow I can go watch Jess play in LaCrosse... I haven't seen her in so long, I miss her so much. I wanna see my lil sis.

I can't wait til next weekend! Take care everyone!"

"event","It's been an interesting week, so let's see:

Last WED- it was Riley's birthday so she sent me a text message to see if I would work for her and since I'm nice sometimes I did (happy birthday to you, haha) After I went to Out N About and met Nikki, Shana, Robyn, and Steph out there, then Riley, Stephanie and Kristen showed up.
THURS- ummm... oh! my girls had a soccer game, so I met them at the high school to ride to Kenosha with them for their 4:30 game at Carthage College. Turns out there game wasn't til 6 so we had a lil bit to eat and then finally started the game at 6:30 just to lose 5-0. Ah well.
FRI- classes and got my car washed went to soccer practice and came home for a low-key night... nuttin too exciting, didn't sleep very well
SAT- had to be at the Park and Ride at 7 a.m. to catch a ride to DePaul for the volleyball tournment. All I did was tape someones toe and make sure I kept the water filled, but i liked it a lot. We had a really good lunch and then we rode back with the team and I got to talk to them a lil more so it was a good trip. Got back to the Park and Ride at like 8 p.m. and headed right to Out N About to meet Shana, Nikki, and Steph. I was in a really goofy mood that night, Riley thought I was drunk... but nope, just happy and over-tired. I left the bar around 12:30, got home then talked to Chris for about 2 hours. So I got to sleep around 4ish.
SUN- woke up to Shana calling at 6 a.m. and went to go pick her up, took her out to breakfast at Denny's then brought her to my house so she could get some sleep. I did some studying then we went to Starbucks so I could meet with Kim to finish up some Home & Garden Party stuff, then I dragged Shana to my agility meeting with me, we went to Southridge and bought new hats (so she would smile), stopped at Dana & Heath's to say hi to them and the kids, went and had dinner and watched a movie at Kristen & Stephanie's along with Riley, then dropped of Shana... came home and was out like a light.
TODAY- classes, went to buy a tanning package (so I don't look like shit for the wedding) tanned or should I say burned, came home and ate, did a lil studying, soon I have to go to soccer practice, then class with Charlie 5-6 and then an agility assistant 8-9, then home to study til I fall asleep (A&P exam tomorrow.) OH! and before stats class this morning this girl was talking to another girl and after she mentioned about being judgemental she made a comment about these two girls being dykes.. it pissed me off, cuz i didn't want some straight, judgemental girl refering to two people as dykes. She must have seen that, cuz she ended up apologizing to me before class started, i thought that was a very respectful thing of her to do, cuz most people wouldn't have. So I said thank you for apologizing and it wasn't the term (I mean Lori and I use it all the time with eachother) it was just the was it came out. Oh well, i thought that was interesting.

Alrighty I have to change and run to soccer before I'm late, opps. Hope everyone is doing well... take care!

P.S.- Lori- if you want to talk you can always feel free to call.. I still do think about you and care about our friendship, but after our conversation last Tuesday I needed to disappear to see if you would care enough to call. No matter what you think, I do have reasons for how I feel about our situation, but I can't seem to explain it to you, or make you see. I do still love you and always will... and I hope you do come to the game on Thursday, I would like to see you."

"event","This semester seems like it's gonna be very challenging, but I have a lot of people to help me out. I have class Mon. thru Fri. at 8 a.m., which blows to get up for, but I get good parking when i get my ass in gear. Last week I spent 10 hours in the Athletic Training Room, and that was pretty cool. We can't do much right now, except fill ice bags, stretch the athletes, remove electrodes, and stuff like that. I have women's volleyball this semester and the girls are really nice, but make me feel very short (which I know, I'm short.) Should be fun.
I've decided to refuse to have a bad week this week, last week was very hard but I've decided not to let myself be depressed and hide it. My parents are gone this week, so it's my week to relax and be a college student. I haven't done dishes yet, still have cleaning to do around the house, and have been getting slower and slower at getting out of bed. I only have til Sunday night... know if the dogs would stop barking late at night and freaking me out, it'll all be good.
Last Saturday I worked and then Sara and I went to go watch the Women's Basketball game, it was a great game and they had an awesome second half and Kiley said I didn't suck anymore for coming to watch (but that didn't last very long.) Then Sunday, I took my parents to the airport at 6:30 a.m. (on my only day to sleep in) then I did nothing all day and then had to go be the agility assistant at the Kennel Club for 3 hours. Monday I had class, did an assignment in the training room, then headed out to Whitewater to have lunch with Lori (which was nice.) Then I came home to take Charlie and Bailey to agility and then Jen came over to watch The Fifth Element (with her eyes closed for a lil bit.) Yesterday I had class pretty much 8-1, then I was in the training room from 1:30-5, came home and chatted on-line for a while. Today I had class 8-8:50 then 9:30-10:45 and then I have to be in the training room from 1:30-5 again and go right to the pool from UWM to teach swim lessons til 8:30ish, then I should pry go home and get things in order and get to bed early (but I won't.) Tomorrow I have class 8-11, then in Sports Medicine training room 12-1. Friday I have class 8-8:50, 11-11:50 and 12-2:50ish then I HAVE to come home and clean. I work 5:30-8:45 and then hanging out with Kate. Saturday I work 9:30-1:30 then coming home to clean, make dinner for Lori, and then movie night. Should be a fun and relaxing night, which I need. Sunday, I have nothing til my parents plane comes in at 4:30ish.
By the way, I've decided to try-out being a (no laughing) a Home & Garden Party demonstrator, so if anyone is interested in having a Home & Garden Party demonstration let me know. I know, it's not like me at all... but it's very flexible hours and it's money in my pocket. I'm having my ""Grand Opening"" party at my house on Feb. 18th, let me know if you wanna stop by. I think that's it for now. I hope everyone has a great rest of the week, take care!"

"event","My break has been pretty good so far, except for that right now Lori is on her way down to Phoenix and I'm stuck in Wisconsin cuz I'm broke and I have to work. Plus, next week Tuesday I have my Athletic Training interview. I'm sort of kind of really nervous about it, but I have a really good back up plan if I don't get into the program. Anywho, my Christmas was pretty good I guess, some more of my family now knows about Lori and I...I think it's about time to officially tell my dad, before somewhat else does. New Year's was really good. Lori was over, I had to work 8-1 collecting property taxes so Lori got to spend that time with my parents...then we did a lil shopping then had fondue with my parents, my brother and sister in law. And shortly after dinner Lori and I went to bed and fell asleep. We woke up at 11:56 fell asleep and woke up again at 12:10, wished eachother a Happy New Year and went back to sleep. May sound boring, but it was great cuz I got to spend it with her. And I hope I can spend the rest of my New Years with her, I love her with all my heart. Other than that, I've been working at City Hall collecting taxes from the lovely citzens, sleeping, spending time with Lori, hanging out with Jen, trying to tidy up my room, and spendin time with my pets.
I think that's about it for now, I'm getting tired. For the rest of my week without Lori I'll be working, hopefully stopping by my friend's to spend time with her and her kids, seein Emily and most likely Jen, and of course thinking of Lori non-stop and waiting to hold her in my arms. Take care everyone and drive safely in this crappy weather. Hope everyone's break is going well."

"event","It's been a while since I've updated...so it's time. Of course it's finals time...I just did my last A&P on-line exam and I have one more exam which is tomorrow afternoon-ish (i better check that time, hehe.) After my exam I'm going into work at City Hall and then be working there 8-5 Mon.-Fri. until I go back to school in January. Which isn't too bad cuz i like my co-workers and bosses and the pay is nice. But, i have to deal with lots of money cuz i'm collecting taxes and I can't go on vacation with Lori. :-( Then on January 11th, I have my Athletic Training interview. I'm nervous, cuz if I don't get in I don't know what i'm gonna do. I guess I'll worry about that later. 
I couple weeks ago I got to meet Lori's best friend and go to the club with them and a few more of Lori's friends. It was really fun and Mo is such a great person. We had a couple good chats and I even danced (if that's what you want to call it.) Good times. Last weekend Lori and I went to the Kalahari in the Dells for Lori's dads x-mas party thing...it was fun, I'd like to go back there sometime. Especially to see the cute lil baby animals again. 
Then this week was my b-day on Thursday. I had an exam in the morning and then at night I went out to eat at Applebee's with Lori, my parents, my brother's, my sister-in-law, and my brother Jeremy's girlfriend. That was nice. Then Saturday Lori and I slept in a lil bit, then ran to the bank, Kohl's, and then out to lunch. Were we ran into my uncle Bryan, his son, and my grandma. Which cuz of that Lori and I ended up going to my Grandma and Grandpa's house to keep an eye on my grandpa and try to do some homework. Then we came home, looked for my pants for a lil while and then got ready to go to my aunt and uncle's x-mas party. Got there and my mom was already drunk off of Asti and a shot of tequilla. We ate, i had a few UV Blue Vodka and Lemonades and then a shot of tequilla with my mom and aunt and uncle. Then off to Jen's. But I called my friend Emily on the way and gave her a belated drunk phone call. She enjoyed it. All and all a good night. But now I have to go study for sociology. Take care everyone. :-)"

"event","Satan Visits a Church

A few minutes before the church services started, the towns-people were sitting in their pews and talking. Suddenly, Satan appeared at the front of the church. Everyone started screaming and running for the front entrance, trampling each other in a frantic effort to get away from evil incarnate.
Soon everyone had exited the church except for one elderly gentleman who sat calmly in his pew without moving, seeming oblivious to the fact that God's ultimate enemy was in his presence.
So Satan walked up to the old man and said, ""Don't you know who I am?""
The man replied, ""Yep, sure do.""
""Aren't you afraid of me?"", Satan asked.
""Nope, sure ain't."" said the man.
""Don't you realize I can kill you with a word?"" asked Satan.
""Don't doubt it for a minute,"" returned the old man, in an even tone.
""Did you know that I could cause you profound, horrifying, AGONY for all eternity?"" persisted Satan.
""Yep,"" was the calm reply.
""And you're still not afraid?"" asked Satan.
""Nope,"" said the old man.
More than a little perturbed, Satan asked, ""Well, why aren't you afraid of me?""
The man calmly replied, ""Been married to your sister for 48 years."""

"event","I forgot how much I love every Robin Hood story ever. Matt, Sam, Patrick and Melody just came over and we watched Robin Hood Men in Tights and now Sarah and I are watching Disney's Robin Hood. I forgot how dreamy that foxy (ok, pun intended) that Robin of Nottingham is. And that Hiss! Always tying himself in knots!
In other news, my snake is the worst shedder ever. She can never seem to get all of her shed off, especially in one piece. I worry about her, but she ducks into her moss hide and disappears. Silly Ama.

"event","today was my last day of work. while i was sad that i was leaving, i didn't feel like it was the end to anything. i felt like i will be going back on tuesday, and i wonder if it will be similar to the times i would wake up at 1:00 in the morning and think i was late to school. i would rush up, get dressed and tear downstairs to wake my mom up, of course only realizing what was going on the second i made the fatal mistake of waking her up. 

the fatal mistake of my college career on the other hand would be my attempt at the sciences. three hours of calculus later i felt like i didn't even have a brain left. two and a half hours of chemistry later i could still look at homework problems and not know what they were trying to communicate to me. i'm really not sure what i'm trying to do here. all i know is that i get butterflies in biology. i get crazy when i can work through chemistry. i feel fucking giddy and excited at the fact that i could be a marine biologist. fuck, i never thought the c-value paradox would get me off. figuratively speaking. 

i can't remember the last time i was so excited for a friday. except maybe last week because i got all my horrifying midterms back. tomorrow matt and i are going to see saw III. why, i have no idea. because it makes my tummy wriggle and gives me an ecxuse to have him protect me. things are going really well i think. i have metamorphosized back into the girl that i enjoy, the girl that enjoys her alone time and welcomes and empty bed, because i know that it will be that much more comfortable when i climb in with matt."

"event","i feel constantly afraid. about a week ago, matt and i had the dreaded conversation that i feel has become far to common in my life. does he still love me? he wasn't sure. he said that sometimes he felt like he was living a lie. that could possibly be, im pretty sure it is, the most hurtful thing he has ever said to me. all i could do was turn back into the begging, pleading girl that cries and feels like death will sweep over her if this actually happens. i told him i would do anything, that this couldn't be over. he said he wanted to keep trying. i suggested that we really, and fro real this time, need to try and see less of each other. our relationship totally turned routine, there was rarely any excitement when we hung out. it was never anything that felt like romantic dating anymore. and i know, it's been two years. i am totally comfortable with the fact that feelings change and nothing will ever stay the same, especially be just like it was the first 6 months, the first year. but maybe if we saw less of each other, more excitement would spark. he'd be happier to see me because we hadn't seen each other in a while, and visa verse. that we should try and take a step back and go to dating. and it was great. the first week he was calling me when he missed me. he missed me after just one day! when i'd see him, i'd get all giddy. and i still feel that way. but i feel constantly paranoid that he's not. like i'm making him do something he doesn't want to do.i feel like i am living under this horrifying shadow of fear, lurking over me all day. i find my self plotting out when it's ok to talk to him, see him. should i pick him up for school tomorrow, or should we just take our separate buses? because he spent the night last night and maybe it's too much time together. and then i plot out the whole week. spent friday night, saw him saturday night for dinner, saw him sunday night when we went to pick up patrick (and i was in a bad mood then). saw him last night when we went to him movie and then he spent the night. saw him this morning as he left for class and i for work. so that would mean, even if for small amounts of time that don't really count, i've seen him everyday since friday. but we only spent two nights together in the last week and a half. thats a record really. so should i not pick him up and drop him to class? would that ruin the ""whole day"" apart theorem? this is who i've become and i'm hating her. and i want to tell him how i'm feeling, but i want him to think i am totally comfortable and laid back. which generally i am. what's going on. i'm
i'm scared. thats what. please don't let me lose him and please let me chill out. thank god i live with sarah. i feel like she's saved my life numerous times. or rather my heart, but to me...same difference."

"event","reasons to quit job:
1. i will have more time to work on the ridiculous amounts of scientific school work 
2. i won't have to deal with psychotic bosses anymore
3. i may be able to get a deal helping out in a lab or in the field
4. i will have more time to myself...actually, i don't think i have any right now
5. my feet would hurt less

reasons to stay a waitress:
1. the money. duh. even though it's a really small cafe, it's nice to get those cash tips and walk away with money in my pocket. and a paycheck.
2. i love my customers. namely the regulars. and they love me. they tell me that they're happy when i'm working and once this woman said ""oh good! you're back! we've been stuck with damien,"" who is the other waiter.
3. i feel useless and spoiled if i'm not making my own money. even though that may not be the case, and i've had plenty of people tell me that, i still feel like i'm no good when i'm not working. but if i was doing fieldwork i definitely wouldn't feel useless...
4. i don't like the idea of people thinking of me as a stupid college student who doesn't work. 

matt doesn't work, sarah doesn't work. last year patrick stopped working because he needed to focus on school. that's what i should do i think. will i have enough balls?"

i do believe i need to quit my job and set out on a search for field research assistant positions. i have never in my whole life felt the same rush and twitter than i do now when i think of working out in the field of marine biology, or biology in general. this whole biology thing is gonna kick my ass. and i can't wait.

p.s. thanks sarah for marrying me to the sea. ha! so more than one meaning now."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of those books that should be read, not because it says anything that other books do not say in some way, but because this book (or, rather, its first edition) said all of it <i>first</i>. The descriptions of various births at given points in time, at the beginning of the first chapters, are evocative. Recommended.

<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Pushed-Painful-Childbirth-Modern-Maternity/dp/0738210730/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1194545688&amp;sr=8-1""><i>Pushed: The Painful Truth About Childbirth and Modern Maternity Care</i>, Jennifer Block</a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most recent tome to cover the same ground as many others, and one of the few that touches on the feminist aspects of birth and birth issues. This is an excellent, well-written book. Highly recommended.

<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Birth-Surprising-History-How-Born/dp/0802143245/ref=pd_bbs_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1194545721&amp;sr=8-2""><i>Birth: The Surprising History of How We Are Born</i>, Tina Cassidy</a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More historical in scope than some, this book also does not necessarily ""judge"" certain practices or routines, with the resulting impression that while the author may not be happy with the mainstream state of care, she's not really advocating anything else either. Still, an interesting reading. Moderately recommended.

<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Birth-as-American-Rite-Passage/dp/0520229320/ref=pd_bbs_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1194545741&amp;sr=8-1""><i>Birth As An American Rite of Passage</i>, Robbie E. Davis-Floyd</a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This book changed the way I thought about birth, because it gave me a framework to think about birth and the differences between midwives, obstetricians, mainstream people, and the radical fringe of birthers. <a href=""http://www.davis-floyd.com/userfiles/TECHNOCRATIC%20HUMANISTIC%20AND%20HOLISTIC.pdf"">This article</a> further expands the dual models of birth into three models of birth: technocratic, humanistic, and holistic. This framework is amazing and has been such a help to me in organizing my thoughts on birth. Further, Robbie Davis-Floyd discusses the cultural meaning of so many hospital routines and how they promote the technocratic model. I can't recommend this book highly enough. Highly, highly recommended.

<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Birth-Crisis-S-Kitzinger/dp/0415372666/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1194545759&amp;sr=8-1""><i>Birth Crisis</i>, Sheila Kitzinger</a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a book primarily about birth trauma, and recovering from birth trauma. It's an important topic that deserves more time and discussion, and I suspect that with Kitzinger calling attention to it, others will soon pay more attention to it as well. Recommended.

<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Rediscovering-Birth-Sheila-Kitzinger/dp/0743412737/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1194545779&amp;sr=8-1""><i>Rediscovering Birth</i>, Sheila Kitzinger</a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I call this the ""coffee table"" book about birth. You know the type of book - lots of full-color photographs and illustrations along with some text that connects the images. It's also an interesting look at the anthropological side of birth and the cross-cultural part of that. Recommended.

<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Dubious-Conceptions-Politics-Teenage-Pregnancy/dp/0674217039/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1194545803&amp;sr=8-1""><i>Dubious Conceptions: The Politics of Teenage Pregnancy</i>, Kristin Luker</a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is such a specialized, niche book, and it is over ten years old, but it rightly points out that teenage pregnancy alone is not the determining factor that condemns a woman to poverty or other poor outcomes. Rather, the outcome is more correlated to the socioeconomic status and other status of the woman before pregnancy. An important message that still is not heeded. Recommended - if you are willing to have an open mind.

<a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=DXOTFVRJYv8C&amp;dq=baby%27s+first+picture+ultrasound+and+the+politics+of+fetal+subjects&amp;pg=PP1&amp;ots=feg5qnEwKu&amp;sig=lpzMTiYY4dXfXA9JSfNKZXjTtho&amp;prev=http://www.google.com/search%3Fhl%3Den%26q%3DBaby%27s%2BFirst%2BPicture%2BUltrasound%2Band%2Bthe%2BPolitics%2Bof%2BFetal%2BSubjects%26btnG%3DGoogle%2BSearch&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=print&amp;ct=title&amp;cad=one-book-with-thumbnail""><i>Baby's First Picture: Ultrasound and the Politics of Fetal Subjects</i>, Lisa M. Mitchell</a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This book is one of the few I have seen to truly tackle what the ultrasound examination and the resulting ""pictures of the baby"" mean apart from their medical context. As someone who rejects the notion of fetal bonding through ultrasound, this was both validating and troubling. Recommended.

<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/American-Way-Birth-Jessica-Mitford/dp/0788163450/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1194545918&amp;sr=8-1""><i>The American Way of Birth</i>, Jessica Mitford</a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ""classic,"" and worth reading if you can find a used copy or a library copy. Equivocally recommended.

<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Birth-Breastfeeding-Michel-Odent/dp/1905570066/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1194545935&amp;sr=8-2""><i>Birth and Breastfeeding</i>, Michel Odent</a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anything that Michel Odent is worth reading. Somehow, this man understands what, by any expectation, no man would understand, and this work is no different. It's hard to characterize his work, except that it's both thought-provoking and beautiful. Highly recommended.

<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Primal-Health-Understanding-Critical-Conception/dp/1902636333/ref=pd_bbs_sr_3?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1194545935&amp;sr=8-3""><i>Primal Health</i>, Michel Odent</a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another wonderful book by Michel Odent, this book focuses on the long-term implications of the conception and prenatal periods, as well as the first year of life. What he discusses has profound implications not just for individual mothers and children, but for society as a whole. Highly recommended.

<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Testing-Women-Fetus-Amniocentesis-Anthropology/dp/0415916453/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1194545985&amp;sr=8-1""><i>Testing Women, Testing the Fetus: The Social Impact of Amniocentesis in America</i>, Rayna Rapp</a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I expected a different book than I actually read. Rapp focuses her fieldwork only on those who agree to at least meet with a genetic counselor; as a result, we never see the many woman of many ages who outright decline the amniocentesis without further debate. There are many class and race issues tangled in her work as well; while the real world is similarly ""messy,"" the multiple confounding variables make it difficult to draw any firm conclusions from her work. An interesting read from a library, but not heartily recommended.

<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Five-Standards-Childbearing-David-Stewart/dp/0934426724/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1194546019&amp;sr=8-1""><i>Five Standards for Safe Childbearing</i>, David Stewart</a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This book is hard to find but likely worth the effort. A compilation of a great deal of research and time, this book lays out a great deal of the evience ""for"" homebirth and other aspects of truly safe childbearing, apart from the iatrogenic dangers. Recommended.

<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Giving-Birth-Journey-Mothers-Midwives/dp/0399527885/ref=pd_bbs_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1194546102&amp;sr=8-1""><i>Giving Birth: A Journey Into the World of Mothers and Midwives</i>, Catherine Taylor</a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An interesting read concentrated on a relatively small population of mothers and midwives, their experiences, and the reasons behind their decisions. Interesting, but nothing particularly ""new."" Equivocally recommend.

<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Born-USA-Broken-Maternity-Children/dp/0520245962/ref=pd_bbs_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1194545688&amp;sr=8-2""><i>Born in the USA: How A Broken Maternity System Must Be Fixed to Put Women and Children First</i>, Marsden Wagner</a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the book that you give to your skeptical insert-relative-here. Written by a physician who is from the United States, there are few objections to made by even the most mainstream as far as his credentials to discuss birth. A firm believer in midwife-attended birth and homebirth, his books makes a compelling case for reform of the United States' obstetric system. Recommended.</lj-cut>"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the ""midwife memoirs,"" Penny Armstrong tells her story of attending births, primarily in Pennsylvania's Amish area. There are no moments of particularly great insight, but neither are there moments in which the reader must cringe. Recommended.

<A HREF=""http://www.amazon.com/Birth-Kristin-Lynne-Kovacic-Barrett/dp/0877458316/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1194542896&sr=8-1""><i>Birth: A Literary Companion</i>, Kristin Kovacic & Lynne Barrett</A>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subtitle for this book could easily be ""Motherlit Takes On Birth."" Of all the compliations of short fiction and essays that deal with various facets of motherhood, this is the sole one, as far as I know, that focuses solely on birth. There are poems and short stories in addition to the usual essays found in these collections. For a fan of the genre, this is a good read; for someone looking more specifically for books about birth, it may not be their cup of tea. Ambivalently recommended.

<A HREF=""http://www.amazon.com/Vaginal-Politics-midwife-Judy-Lee/dp/0966558472/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1194543190&sr=8-1""><i>Vaginal Politics: A Midwife's Story</i>, Judy Lee & Bette L. Waters</A>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another ""midwife memoir,"" and the sole book in this list that I own but haven't yet read.

<A HREF=""http://www.amazon.com/Journey-into-Motherhood-Inspirational-Stories/dp/0974785326/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1194543244&sr=8-1""><i>Journey Into Motherhood</i>, Sheri L. Menelli</A>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This book and Janet Schwegel's (below) were released near the same time, and I read the first within weeks of each other. This one is less ""organized"" and has less commentary, overall. Despite the fact that this book has only one or two unassisted birth stories, I found I overall preferred this book. Recommended.

<A HREF=""http://www.amazon.com/Diary-Midwife-Juliana-van-Olphen-Fehr/dp/0897895886/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1194543501&sr=8-1""><i>Diary of a Midwife</i>, Juliana van Olphen-Fehr</A>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the title gives away, this is a story of a midwife. To a point, most of these books are similar; there is nothing to recommend this one more or less than any other.

<A HREF=""http://www.amazon.com/Adventures-Natural-Childbirth-Pleasures-Naturally/dp/1569243689/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1194543711&sr=8-1""><i>Adventures in Natural Childbirth</i>, Janet Schwegel</A>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As noted above, there are many similarities between this book and <i>Journey Into Motherhood</i>. This book is clearly organized into categories: Natural Birth With a Midwife, Natural Birth With a Doula, Natural Birth with a Physician, and Unassisted Birth. There is also more commentary about what a midwife is, what a doula is, and so forth. Despite the more researched feel to the overal product, it comes in second in my preferences, except for the inclusion of more unassisted birth stories. Recommended.

<A HREF=""http://www.amazon.com/Having-Faith-Sandra-Steingraber/dp/0425189996/ref=pd_bbs_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1194543865&sr=8-2""><i>Having Faith: An Ecologist's Journey to Motherhood</i>, Sandra Steingraber</A>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather than the midwive memoirs, or birth tales of many mothers, this book is different, in that is the memoir of one mother throughout her pregnancy, with a focus on ecology. There are no answers offered by Sandra Steingraber, but it is an interesting tale nonetheless. Recommended.

<A HREF=""http://www.amazon.com/Baby-Catcher-Chronicles-Modern-Midwife/dp/0743219341/ref=pd_bbs_sr_3?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1194543501&sr=8-3""><i>Baby Catcher: Chronicles of a Modern Midwife</i>, Peggy Vincent</A>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, some midwives have a gift with the written word. It's not so much that the story Peggy Vincent tells is more compelling than the story other midwives might tell, but that through her writing, the reader becomes more and more emotionally involved. Highly recommended.</lj-cut>"

"event","<lj-cut text=""On Latin (Take Two)"">
Gillian will begin her Latin studies in first grade using Prima Latina (to which her mother will add macrons). There are 25 lessons and five review lessons - we will likely try to spend two weeks on each review lesson, and use the last week of school for a comprehensive review. 

The first half of second grade, using Latina Christiana I, will then be a review. Again, there are 25 lessons and five review lessons. We will not spend extra time on the review of Prima Latina, but will use extra time with the new material in the second half of the year. We will use the supplemental Ludere Latine and possibly Lingua Angelica.

Third grade brings us to a choice between continuing with the Memoria Press series through Latina Christiana II, or switching to Latin for Children A. LCII again has 25 lessons with five review lessons, and we would use Ludere Latine and, most likely, Lingua Angelica. LfC A has 24 lessons, along with six unit review lessons and two comprehensive review lessons. LfC A additionally has an activity book and a history reader.

If we complete LCII, fourth grade will see us using LfC A at an accelerated pace, starting LfC B somewhere near the mid-point of the year. Otherwise, we would simply utilize LfC B throughout the year. LfC B also has an activity book and history reader.

In fifth grade, Gillian will complete LfC C, as well as finishing up LfC B, depending on the path chosen in third grade. More attention will be given to translation. As before, LfC C has an activity book and history reader. 

In sixth grade, the transition will be made to Oxford Latin. We may purchase Oxford Latin Course Part I for reference, but Gillian will work through Oxford Latin Course Part II in sixth grade. Seventh grade work will be Oxford Latin Course Part III. From there, eighth grade will consist of readings in Latin, possibly through the reader offered by Oxford Latin (Oxford Latin Course Part IV). 

Ninth grade Latin studies will focus on preparing for one of the two AP Latin exams; tenth grade will focus on preparing for the other. At that point, formal Latin study will cease, unless Gillian desire to pursue joint enrollment.</lj-cut>


<lj-cut text=""On Greek (Take Two)"">
Greek exposure will start in second grade, using Greek alphabet wooden blocks and either the Reader plus Level One of Hey Andrew! Teach Me Some Greek! or A Greek Alphabetarion and A Greek Hupogrammon. 

In third grade, Gillian will start Koine Greek, using Elementary Greek Year One, starting six weeks into the school year if the Latin curriculum has also been changed. Elementary Greek Year Two will follow in fourth grade, and Year Three in fifth grade. 

During fifth grade, the transition to Attic Greek will begin, most likely through the use of a tutor and college-level texts. Ideally, Gillian will be able to take college course at Oglethorpe, Mercer, or Georgia State and then work with a professor to further and continue her Greek study, culminating in reading Homer in the original.</lj-cut>


<lj-cut text=""On Spanish (Take Two)"">
We're starting (again) La Clase Divertida tonight. We will finish Level One; if we can commit to it and stay with it, then we will continue on with Level Two and Level Three, finishing sometime around the end of second grade or the beginning of third grade. If we decide to change programs after Level One, we will purchase PowerGlide Junior, and follow that up, possibly, with Rosetta Stone. Alternatively, if we do continue with La Clase Divertida, we will follow it up with Rosetta Stone also. After working through Rosetta Stone, further study will have to be accomplished through traditional textbooks, utilizing a tutor. </lj-cut>"

"event","<lj-cut text=""On Mathematics (Take Two)"">
Gillian has finished Miquon Orange and Developmental Math One, and has worked through approximately one-third each of Developmental Math Two and Developmental Math Three. We're nearing the end of Miquon Red; current plans are to integrate a little bit of Developmental Math in until we reach the end of Miquon Red. This will be just before the end of the 'formal' school year. Over the summer we'll use Developmental Math Two and Developmental Math Three again, as well as a drugstore-type workbook on time, money, and fractions. We'll also play lots of games!

First grade math will be Miquon Blue and Miquon Green, once again supplemented by various titles in the Developmental Math series. Summer will consist of review through Developmental Math, games, and other materials. Second grade will see Gillian finish the Miquon series, using the Purple and Yellow books. We'll continue to supplement with Developmental Math as needed. 

Third and fourth grade math will most likely be a 'mishmash' of approaches, reviewing and consolidating knowledge through Developmental Math, as well as the Keys To... series, games, and possibly some other math program, such as Singapore Math. The goal is to prepare Gillian for Algebra 1/2 at the beginning of the fifth grade year. 

The plan is to allow four years - fifth through eighth grades - to complete three levels of Saxon Math: Algebra 1/2 (second edition), Algebra I, and Algebra II. Those, combined with Advanced Mathematics in ninth grade, constitute Algebra I, Geometry, Algebra II, and PreCalculus. Calculus (in preparation for the AP exam) follows in tenth grade, and Physics (also in preparation for the AP exam) in eleventh grade. If she chooses to continue studying mathematics formally in twelfth grade, she'll have to do joint enrollment!

Optionally, she could, conceivably, finish all the Saxon books at the rate of one per year, putting her in Calculus in ninth grade. In that situation, we would probably pursue joint enrollment for tenth grade and either eleventh or twelfth grade, delaying Physics until eleventh or twelfth grade. 

Physics is listed here, rather than under science, because it is a calculus-based program sold as part of the Saxon Mathematics series and is math-based, not experimental.</lj-cut>


<lj-cut text=""On Science (Take Two)"">
The classical model (or neo-classical, if you prefer) cycles through science in a four-year pattern, similar to its methodology for history studies. Biology, earth science & astronomy, chemistry, and finally physics are each studied for a year in turn, once during each 'stage' - grammar, logic, and rhetoric.

First grade, then, is biology, and we will be using Pandia Press's R.E.A.L. Science: Life, supplementing with Color Anatomy, QuickPix Animals, The Usborne Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Natural World, and library books. For second grade, we will have a choice between DIY study, using primarily the resources listed in The Well-Trained Mind, or R.E.A.L. Science: Earth and Space. After doing it myself this year, and using R.E.A.L. Science next year, we should have a good basis of comparison on which to make our decision.

Third grade is the year of choices! R.E.A.L. Science: Chemistry, Real Science 4 Kids Chemistry with extensive supplementation, or completely doing it myself using Adventures in Atoms and Molecules. Similarly, in fourth grade, there will be a R.E.A.L. Science: Physics package, Real Science 4 Kids Physics with supplementation, or putting it all together from scratch.

In fifth grade, we'll come back to biology, and use either R.E.A.L. Science: Life, Level Two (which hopefully will be available by then) or Real Science 4 Kids Biology with supplementation. The recommended resources for biology in The Well-Trained Mind are not particularly strong. Sixth grade is again earth science and astronomy, either through R.E.A.L. Science: Earth and Space, Level Two or DIY. 

Chemistry is revisited in seventh grade, and the current plan is to use Friendly Chemistry, which bills itself as appropriate for high school chemistry, but seems not rigorous enough and just 'fun' enough for a seventh-grade study of chemistry. 

Eighth grade marks the transition to high school level (and beyond) science, with a revisiting of physics. Using Conceptual Physics or a similar high school level text, Gillian will earn a credit for Physics I on her transcript. 

High school science is even more difficult to figure out. Most likely, it will involve joint enrollment! Chemistry will be studied in ninth grade, then biology in tenth grade. Physics (see math) will be studied in either eleventh or twelfth grade. Since it is primarily a math course, the same year will also possibly see some study of astronomy and earth science. Ideally, this will leave twelfth grade free for in depth study, or allow Gillian to 'rest' from science study. Alternatively, she could take a joint-enrollment course in more experimental physics.</lj-cut>


<lj-cut text=""On Language Arts (Take Two)"">
Language Arts consists of spelling/word study, grammar, handwriting, writing, and reading. For all years, reading is closely tied to the history curriculum and as such, will not be discussed here.

We will finish Gillian's phonics book over the summer, and will finish Spelling Workout A before the end of her kindergarten year, as well as her handwriting book. Review work over the summer will consist of copywork involving spelling words!

First grade language arts will be Spelling Workout B, Spelling Workout C, My Printing Book, copywork, and finishing First Language Lessons. Second grade will ideally consist of Spelling Workout D, Spelling Workout E, Printing Power, copywork, dictation, and either First Language Lessons: Level Three or Growing With Grammar, Grade 3. In all likelihood, it will be Growing With Grammar. Additionally, she will probably add Writing Strands 2 activities.

Third grade, then, encompasses Spelling Workout F, Spelling Workout G, cursive handwriting (resource still to be decided), copywork, dictation, Writing Strands 3, Classical Composition, and Growing With Grammar, Grade 4. In fourth grade, Gillian will finish the Spelling Workout series with the completion of Spelling Workout H, further practice cursive handwriting, continue to do dictation, complete Writing Strands 4, use Classical Composition, and use Growing With Grammar, Grade 5.

Fifth grade marks the entry into logic stage. Gillian will transition from spelling to vocabulary-type studies, utilizing Vocabulary from Classical Roots A and (possibly) The Book of Roots. Additionally, she will continue dictation, complete Writing Strands 5, and use the next level or levels of Classical Composition. Finally, she will use either Growing With Grammar, Grade 6, Writing and Grammar 5, or Writing and Grammar 6, with a supplement of Junior Analytical Grammar.

In sixth grade, Vocabulary from Classical Roots B and Vocabulary from Classical Roots C will be used. Gillian will complete Writing Strands 6 and use another level or two of Classical Composition. Grammar instruction will be either Writing and Grammar 6 or Writing and Grammar 7, with a supplement of Junior Analytical Grammar.

Seventh grade will consist of Vocabulary from Classical Roots D and Vocabulary from Classical Roots E, Writing Strands 7, appropriate levels of Classical Composition, and either Writing and Grammar 7 or Writing and Grammar 8.

Eighth grade will see extensive work in Writing Exposition and the final levels of Classical Composition, as well as grammar either through Writing and Grammar 8, use of Exercises in English's eighth grade book, or The Stewart English Program - Principles Plus.

Ninth grade makes the shift into rhetoric stage. Spelling and word study are no longer studied using separate curricula; formal writing instruction has also ended, though some mechanics of writing are studies through the study of rhetoric. Grammar study must be continued, either through Exercises in English's eighth grade (and final) book, The Stewart English Program - Principles Plus, or Analytical Grammar.

In tenth grade, grammar continues to be the only subject studied formally. Gillian will either use Analytical Grammar, The Stewart English Program - Principles Plus, or The Stewart English Program - Grammar Plus.

Eleventh grade options are Analytical Grammar, The Stewart English Program - Grammar Plus, and The Stewart English Program - Writing Plus.

If Gillian completes the sequence Writing and Grammar 8-Principles Plus-Analytical Grammar-Grammar Plus-Writing Plus, twelfth grade will most likely not have any formal grammar, unless there is a half-course available at that time. This is the most likely progression.

If Gillian completes the sequence Writing and Grammar 8-Exercises in English 8-Principles Plus-Analytical Grammar-Grammar Plus, she will complete Writing Plus in twelfth grade. This is also true if Analytical Grammar is switched with Grammar Plus.

If Gillian completes the sequence Writing and Grammar 7-Writing in Grammar 8-Principles Plus-Analytical Grammar-Grammar Plus, she will complete Writing Plus in twelfth grade.

If Gillian completes the sequence Writing and Grammar 7-Writing in Grammar 8-Exercise in English 8-Principles Plus-Analytical Grammar, then she will complete Grammar Plus and do as much of Writing Plus as time allows. This is a greatly slowed sequence with more than adequate review and is unlikely.</lj-cut>"

Since we just changed from Standard Time to Daylight Savings Time ('spring forward'), both G & J slept a little late today, waking up around 8 instead of 7:15 or 7:30. Tomorrow I'll have to wake them up at 7:45, then 7:30 on Wednesday, and finally 7:15 on Thursday. We had breakfast soon after they woke up, then we got ready for the day: Gillian used the bathroom, brushed teeth, and got dressedl; I washed the breakfast dishes, used the bathroom, brushed teeth, put in my contacts, got dressed, and laid out clothes for Jacob; Jacob just had to get his diaper changed and let me put a onesie on him. Then we went upstairs, around 8:50 or 8:55.

First on the agenda was poetry. This week we're reading this week's planned poetry as well as last week's planned poetry because the page with the plan was temporarily misplaced. After this week, though, the poetry (and the plan) is going back downstairs, and we'll read it either at breakfast, lunch, or snacktime. Gillian wanted to do reading practice after that, so we read about one-third of <i>Amelia Bedelia</i>. I read <i>Carousel</i> (Brian Wildsmith) to her immediately afterwards, then we a lesson from <i>First Language Lessons</i> (grammar). Then I read <i>What Mary Jo Shared</i> (Janice Udry). She sang <i>The Star-Spangled Banner</i> to me before we did phonics. We read ""The Sleeping Beauty"" from <i>The Barebook Book of Princesses</i> and went over her spelling lesson. Then she sat down to do some of the spelling work on her own. Currently she's working on her math lesson (verrrry slowly, I might add).

Jacob was happy enough in the Superyard until around the time she started her math work; then I went and got him, he nursed for a bit, and then he just crawled around between this room and the playroom. Eventually, I facilitated the rest of Gillian's math work, set up most of her handwriting, and went downstairs to start our morning snack (hardboiled eggs).

After she finished the handwriting work, she came downstairs with her Human Body Encyclopedia and her Animal Encyclopedia. We read about deer, then about the heart and the circulatory system. That's the end of our official covering of the human body for now. Later today, we'll be going to the library and getting a book or two on deer to read on Wednesday. Then I took dictation for her for the note she wants to write to Mimi; after snack, she'll copy it onto her own sheet of paper.

While we're eating our snack (and I've finished), I'll read her <i>The Legend of the Sand Dollar</i>, which finishes up our read-alouds for today. Once she copies her note, we'll look at the map and recite the eastern border states & capitals. The last thing to do for today is to read a chapter in <i>On the Banks of Plum Creek</i> - we'll do that either before lunch or before dinner.</lj-cut>"

"event","We didn't get to do any school at all before Jacob's swimming lesson, so it was after 10:30 before we got started. We read our poetry and then did our phonics for the day - today it was review of lessons 52 and 53. Then we read <i>Pumpkin Pumpkin</i>, <i>People</i>, and <i>Spunky Monkeys on Parade</i>. After that, Jacob started to wake up, so we moved into the kitchen to do handwriting ('Numbers for Me,' practice with L, K, and N, and a row of U) and math (one page of multiplication, one page of inequalities). Then we read 'Horse' in <i>The Kingfisher First Animal Encyclopedia</i> and read <i>Animals Are Not Like Us: Horses</i>. Gillian read me book 9 from Bob Books Fun - <i>Go, Bus</i>. Then we read two chapters of <i>Little House on the Prairie</i> and that was it for formal school.

We did start <i>La Clase Divertida</i> tonight, though. Gillian is just dying to learn Spanish!"

"event","It's my understanding that in European countries, students study their own language, English, and then select a third foreign language from a selection. There's no inherent reason that American children can't learn English as well as <i>two</i> other languages. Or more, for that matter. Our minds are amazing, especially as children.

<lj-cut text=""On Latin"">
I want to use the Memoria Press products for Latin, because they are the best suited for early exposure, but they are based on ecclesiastical pronounciation. So my idea, at this point, is to use their materials, but not their audio products, and to add my own macrons. Tedious? Yes. Easier than writing my own early elementary Latin program? By far.

With that in mind, I plan to start Prima Latina in first grade. It's only twenty lessons, and I'd rather go for mastery, and allow a full year for it. Some of Prima Latina is repeated in Latina Christiana I. So, we'll go ahead and move forward into LCI in second grade, followed by LCII in third grade.

That's an extremely accelerated schedule, and with that in mind, we'll take Henle I very, very slowly in fourth grade, concentrating just on Units I & II - and unit I is largely review. 

I'm just guessing, from there on out, but in a very general way:

Fifth grade: units 3, 4, 5, & 6 in Henle I; sixth grade: units 7 - 11 in Henle I; seventh grade: units 12-14 in Henle I and lessons 1 - 20 in Henle II; eighth grade: lessons 21 - 32 in Henle II; ninth grade: Henle III & AP Latin Literature; tenth grade: Henle IV; eleventh grade: AP Latin - Virgil; twelfth grade - nothing or elective.</lj-cut>


<lj-cut text=""On Spanish"">
I have a completely different goal for Spanish than I do for Latin. Spanish is more of a life skill than an academic subject, in my conception. With that in mind, we have La Clase Divertida Level One. The idea is to progress through Levels One, Two, and Three (assuming we like Level One well enough) by the end of second or third grade, then move into Powerglide Junior, Powerglide, or Rosetta Stone for one to four years. By seventh grade, I suspect we'll simply need a tutor, especially if I want them to be able to speak Spanish and understand spoken Spanish, as opposed to just reading and writing. At one point I had considered the La Clase Divertida levels, then Powerglide Junior, then Powerglide, then Rosetta Stone, but in the end, I think that Powerglide Junior will just primarily retread the La Clase material, and Powerglide merely retread Powerglide Junior material, so I think the step from La Clase must be either Powerglide or Rosetta Stone. If we think we're going to do Rosetta Stone at all, we'll probably go straight to it - but we shall see. Lots of time, there, and very little plan, except to take both AP Spanish exams at some point (even if it's in seventh grade!).</lj-cut>


<lj-cut text=""On Greek"">
Yes, Greek. There are no Attic Greek programs geared towards elementary school, so we'll start with Koine Greek via Elementary Greek in third grade, following a year of preparatory work in the Greek alphabet using Hey Andrew! Teach Me Some Greek Level One and possibly Level Two. Following the three years of Elementary Greek, sixth grade may begin the transition to Attic Greek, with the assistance of a tutor. My Greek plans are VERY undeveloped.</lj-cut>"

"event","<lj-cut text=""On Mathematics"">
Gillian is racing through MIquon Orange at a terrific pace. Even if she slowed down considerably, she's still going to finish well before the end of the year. Depending on the exact completion date, we'll either do Developmental Math until the end of the year, or we'll do Developmental Math for four weeks before starting Miquon Red. 

Either way, she's going to complete the six-book Miquon series plus the cooresponding Developmental Math books by the end of third grade, with the Miquon books possibly completed by the end of her second grade year. We'll then spend fourth grade with any other Developmental Math books through level 16, and the Keys To... series, preparing her for pre-algebra in the fifth grade. Pre-algebra will be either Saxon 87 or Algebra 1/2 - it's hard to tell which is recommended for the third edition. The plan is to allow four years (fifth through eighth) for the three book squence of Saxon 87/Algebra 1/2, Algebra I, and Algebra II. Ninth grade would then be Advanced Mathematics. That, plus the two Algebra books, constitutes Algebra I, Geometry, Algebra II, and Precalculus. Tenth grade will be Calculus, in preparation for the AP exam, and eleventh grade will be calculus-based Physics (also in preparation for the AP exam). Twelfth grade would then be either math-free, or electives taken through joint enrollment.

There is, however, the possibility that she'll only take three years to get through the three books I have planned for fifth through eighth grades, in which case I have to accept the possibility that I might have a ninth grader taking calculus. A fourteen year old taking the AP exam.</lj-cut>


<lj-cut text=""On Science"">
We were continue studying animals throughout the remainder of her kindergarten year, but we will layer a study of the human body during the winter, and a study of plants (primarily through a garden) in the spring. Then for first grade biology, I'm leaning heavily towards using R.E.A.L. Science. It introduces cells and classification among other important topics. 

Then, when it comes time to decide about second grade earth science/astronomy, I'll have a year of doing it myself as well as a year of R.E.A.L. Science under my belt. 

Third grade, chemistry, we'll have three options - R.E.A.L. Science, Real Science for Kids (w/ extensive supplementation - alone, it's only a ten week course), or doing it myself with <i>Adventures in Atoms and Molecules</i>. Similarly, three options for fourth grade physics - R.E.A.L. Science, RS4K, or DIY.

Then logic stage comes along! Fifth grade is biology again, and there's a choice between R.E.A.L. Science (I hope!), RS4K, and DIY, but the DIY will have to be with something <i>other</i> than the WTM-recommended resources. Similarly, for sixth grade earth science/astronomy, there will be R.E.A.L. Science or DIY. 

For chemistry in seventh grade, I plan at this point to use Friendly Chemistry, but when the time comes I may have to compare it with R.E.A.L. Science. For physics in eighth grade, I'd like to use a high school or college level text for Conceptual Physics, preferably mostly absent of math, but algebra based where necessary. This will be the class I will count for Physics I for high school credit for her transcript. 

High school - chemistry in ninth grade, biology in tenth grade, physics (see math) in eleventh grade. Since physics is technically a math class, we may study astronomy and earth science that year as well, leaving twelfth grade free for more in-depth study of one topic, joint enrollment, or a science-less year.</lj-cut>


<lj-cut text=""The Language Arts"">
By the time we start Gillian's first grade year, she'll have completed all of <i>The Ordinary Parent's Guide to Reading</i>, and at least part of <i>Spelling Workout A</i>, as well as several lessons' worth of <i>First Language Lessons</i>. When she finishes <i>First Language Lessons</i>, we will move into the follow up book of that and/or <i>English for the Thoughtful Child</i>, possibly followed by <i>English for the Thoughtful Child 2</i>. Then we'll start on Rod & Staff with grade 3, unless this new secular program pans out as something worth doing instead. At some point, I plan to insert <i>Analytical Grammar</i> and the Stewart English Program, probably in high school. Variety reinforces.

For <i>Spelling Workout</i>, we hope to finish Book C by the end of her first grade year, followed by books D & E in second grade, F & G in third grade, and H in fourth grade. That's obviously an ambitious schedule; a more realistic one might be finishing book B during second grade, finishing C & D during second grade, finishing E during third grade, finishing F & G during fourth grade, and finishing H in fifth grade. Either way, books A through H should be complete well before sixth grade, at which point we'll begin <i>Vocabulary from Classical Roots</i>. I fully expect that to be review, given our rather ambitious language program. There are five books, A through E, with fifteen lessons each, IIRC, making completion well before the eighth grade year, if not before.

Writing is less well-defined. At the moment, I plan a combination of approaches. Copywork, dictation, Writing Strands, and Classical Composition all, though not all at the same time. We'll do copywork at least through third grade, in combination with basic dictation during and after second grade. Dictation will continue until approximately fifth grade. Writing Strands will start with book three in third grade. I don't know beyond that. I think that the kinds of everyday writing that Writing Strands teaches is important, but I also think that the Classical Composition approach is good. So we'll likely do some kind of combination, one way or another.

Reading will be a huge part of school, both read-alouds and books that Gillian reads to herself. Most of it will be coordinated with history, however.</lj-cut>

"event","First of all, we are so far ahead of my expectations on math that I can hardly believe it. We're just at three weeks ahead, close to four, and I suspect by this time next week, we'll be solidly four weeks ahead. She just eats that math right up and of course I want to encourage that. We may stop at some point and take a breather of her working in her Developmental Math books for a bit, now that she can write her numbers and has some exposure to the material. I think it's a great way to reinforce and review. 

We're still forging ahead in phonics. I can tell her reading is improving, and I'm glad that we have some extra days built in that we can really use for review before moving on to long-vowel sounds. She'd doing great in terms of her reading practice, though - she asks when she can do her Bob Book for the day.

Read-alouds are going well - we're technically a day ahead in <i>Little House in the Prairie</i> but I like having that buffer zone. We are reading each picture book twice in a week, so that she hears it more than once. We've also started reading one math-oriented picture book each day. I think it's good to have some concepts explained in a variety of different ways. We're still reading poetry each day as well. 

Last week in science we covered wild dogs, foxes, and hyenas, with accompanying library books. This week, we've been covering wolves, and there are lots of supplementary library books for that, so we've learned tons about wolves. I think next week we talk about horses, but I really can't remember completely. 

Gillian has almost all the capitals of the southern border states memorised. She still has a little bit of trouble with California - she wants to say Tallahassee instead of Sacramento! Still, I think she's doing well. We'll probably start the northern border states next week. 

I am exhausted and not looking forward to tomorrow - we have to go pick up Sam and then go to the doctor's office. This afternoon we have Daisies and I have to fold up the playyard for Jacob. Hopefully I'll have some time tonight to sit down and really THINK about homeschool, instead of just going through the motions of homeschool."

That way, we can totally skip school on Wednesday if desired/needed.

<lj-cut text=""Over the weekend"">
On Saturday, we read a chapter (seven) of <i>Little House on the Prairie</i>, so we're now a day ahead of our schedule.

We covered Lesson 59 in OPGTR and reviewed lessons 57 and 44. Gillian read book five of BBF, and together we read <i>One Morning in Maine</i>, <i>Lyle, Lyle Crocodile</i>, and chapter eight of <i>Little House on the Prairie</i>. Gillian completed pages E-17, E-18, and T-7 in mathematics, and we read <i>100 Days of Cool</i>. In handwriting, we introduced the H, reviewed i, and practiced M, N, R, and the 1-7 sequence. I read 'Dog (wild)' from <i>The Kingfisher First Animal Encyclopedia</i> and Sam read <i>The Best Book of Wild Dogs and Wolves</i> to her. We covered our poetry assignment for the day, and Jacob listened to <i>Mouse Paint</i> as well as knocking over stacks of things.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Today was a good day"">
I was a little concerned about our 'flow' today, since Jacob had swim class from 9:30 to 10 am, but I needn't've worried. We were all up by 7:30 and started breakfast right away. Jacob was happy to sit in the jumper once I started reading to Gillian. We started with poetry for today, then read <i>The Three Little Pigs</i> and <i>The Star-Spangled Banner</i>. After she was done with breakfast, we moved on to lesson 60 in OPGTR, reviewing lessons 44, 45, 58, and 59 as well. We'll repeat lesson 60 tomorrow. Gillian read book 6 in BBF, then we moved onto math.

Gillian completed pages T-7a, E-19, and E-20. She amazes me! Then we made flash card for the states and capitals for four of the southern border states, and practiced writing - a row of H, introduction of 8, and practice on R, B, and M. 

Then it was time to go to the Y for Jacob's swim class. We put in the States & Capitals CD to listen to on the way there & back. Jacob loved his class, Gillian sat nicely in a chair on the pool deck, we stopped and got drinks (hot chocolate for me, chocolate milk for G) at Starbucks, and when we got home, Jacob stayed asleep!

So after I changed clothes and hung up our wet clothes and towels, and drank the reaminder of my hot chocolate, we finished school by reading <i>William's Doll</i>, <i>The Penny Pot</i>, and chapter nine in <i>Little House on the Prairie</i>. We were done by 11:30 am!

I'm thinking about getting <i>William's Doll</i> for Jacob as his Christmas present just from me. He'll be getting <i>More More More Said The Baby</i> from both Sam and I, plus a lullaby CD and some wooden toys.

Jacob is petting Daisy now. I might should go rescue them.</lj-cut>"

Gillian has completed through Lesson 58 in <i>The Ordinary Parent's Guide to Teaching Reading</i>, as planned, and read through Book Four in <i>Bob Books Fun</i> as well as <i>Captain Cat</i>. I read Chapters 2 through 6 in <i>Little House on the Prairie</i> to her, as well as <i>The Best-Loved Doll</i>, <i>Noah's Ark</i>, <i>Sylvester and the Magic Pebble</i>, <i>Lovable Lyle</i>, and <i>Green Eggs and Ham</i>.

In mathematics, Gillian ended the week over a week ahead of schedule - though E-16 and T-6. She made good progress in handwriting, learning the N, the M, 6, 7, and practicing previous letters, as well as the G. In science, we finished up our unit on cats with <i>Cougar: Lion of the Mountains</i> and <i>It Could Still Be A Cat</i>, reviewed the characteristics of mammals with <i>It Could Still Be A Mammal</i>, and began talking about dogs, reading 'Dog (domestic)' in <i>The Kingfisher Animal Encyclopedia</i>, <i>Everything Dog</i>, and <i>It Could Still Be A Dog</i>, as well as looking at the breed photographs in the encyclopedia entry for Dog. We continued reading poetry in <i>A Child's Garden of Verses</i>, as well as poems in <i>A Child's Calendar</i> and from our book of read-aloud poems. Finally, Jacob listened to <i>Mr. Brown Can Moo, Can You?</i> this week.</lj-cut>

<lj-cut text=""Coming Up"">
<b>English/Language Arts:</b> Introduce lessons 58 through 61 in <i>The Ordinary Parent's Guide to Teaching Reading</i>, as well as reviewing lessons 44 through 46 and 57 through 60.  Use <i>Bob Books Fun</i> books five and six for reading practice, plus <i>Danny and the Dinosaur</i>, <i>Are You My Mother?</i>, and <i>Captain Cat</i>. Listen to chapters seven through eleven in <i>Little House on the Prairie</i> as read-aloud. Listen to read-aloud picture books <i>One Morning in Maine</i>, <i>Lyle, Lyle Crocodile</i>, <i>William's Doll</i>, <i>The Star-Spangled Banner</i>, <i>Stellaluna</i>, and <i>The Three Little Pigs</i>. Listen to 'October' (<i>A Child's Calendar</i>), pages 41 through 53 in <i>A Child's Garden of Verses</i>, 'Autumn,' 'Harvest Sunset,' 'My Inside Self,' 'Me,' and 'I Am Cherry Alive.'

<b>Mathematics:</b> Begin week with E-19; this puts possibility of finishing section E this week. Finish current portion of section T (reserve T-8 and T-8a until after multiplication is covered). Read <i>100 Days of Cool</i> and <i>The Penny Pot</i> alternately. 

<b>Handwriting:</b> Introduce the H, the K, and 8. Practice M, N, 7, i, l, and G.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an odd, middle-of-the-road type parenting book. People that are very much into attachment parenting will find fault with it, and people that are very much into scheduling their children will find fault with it. The bits about the cycles that babies go through are very helpful, though, and I think the idea of her 'schedule' could easily be adapted to those who believe strictly in demand feeding.

144. <A HREF=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0425189996/qid=1103771679/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/104-1197700-2151924?v=glance&s=books&n=507846""><i>Having Faith</i></A>, Sandra Steingraber. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>(R)</b>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some ways, this is another odd book. Tracing ecological concerns through the months of pregnancy, there are times when the author is hopelessly naive, times when she is hopelessly jaded, and times when she is, perhaps, too optimistic. Still, worth reading, though I would not own a copy myself had it not been free.

145. <A HREF=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0967571308/qid=1103771791/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/104-1197700-2151924?v=glance&s=books&n=507846""><i>Seven Times the Sun</i></A>, Shea Darian. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of three or four 'Waldorf-inspired' books that deal with rhythm; this particular one deals with rhythms within each individual day. Seven specific times/routines are highlighted, each with ideas. There is also some discussion of the 'whys' of rhythms, and some advice on implementing rhythms, realistically. Recommended.

146. <A HREF=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0964783231/qid=1103771914/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/104-1197700-2151924?v=glance&s=books&n=507846""><i>Beyond the Rainbow Bridge</i></A>, Barbara Patterson and Pam Bradley.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an approach to early-years parenting inspired by Waldorf ideas, and written by a Waldorf preschool/kindergarten teacher, and a parent of one of the children in one of her classes. In many ways, it feels like a companion piece to Rahima Baldwin Dancy's <i>You Are Your Child's First Teacher</i>, to be used in tandem, and gleaned from throughout the first seven years.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another Kitzinger book! While I like her approach - and the great number of pictures is a great boon for a book on this subject - there are better breastfeeding books out there. I would rank it perhaps fourth on my list of 'preferred books' about breastfeeding, which is still quite a bit higher than many, but it's not one of the best.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hesitate to call it sweet, but it is just that - a sweet memoir of a teacher and his class that he guided through eight years of school, from first to eighth, in a Waldorf school. Well-written.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I actually reread this with the intent to simply take notes on the bits I found useful, and then sell the book. Instead I found myself deciding to keep it, despite the at-times extremely heavy fundamentalist tone. There is a great deal of helpful advice on narration and a few other subjects for homeschooling, and while some of the suggestions of things to do in various seasons are at best quaint, there are times when quaintness can be desired. So, I decided to keep it, and got rid of a different book.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the people that retreated from what we now call England, into Cornwall and Wales, but mostly into Scotland. These are people that never bent their necks to Rome; they still don't bend their necks. This is a breezy, easy to comprehend look at the people called Scots-Irish, that ended up forming the backbone of 'the South' and the nation's working class. While Webb has his biases, which become particularly evident as he moves into more recent times, he does do a good job of explicating the history of these people in Scotland, Ireland, and then the United States. More people ought to read this book, especially people who say they do not understand the South. Recommended.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He brings up one other point, as an aside - in what other ethnic group do we slander the men for working hard? The term redneck was created to describe these Scots-Irish farmers, whose necks were red after working in the hot sun all day. And yet it's become an insult. Food for thought.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have thoroughly enjoyed all of Romm's books that I have read; this is no exception. While she does concentrate on herbal and dietary remedies and strengtheners, it's also a joy to read a book that acknowledges the postpartum period as a time of great importance for the mother as well as the new baby. Recommended.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an excellent, thought-provoking book that offers few conclusions but much to consider. de Marneffe examines the common feminist fallacies surrounding motherhood, and the equally fallacious assumptions that the anti-feminists may make, getting to the heart of the to-work-outside-the-home or not-to-work-outside-the-home conundrum inside each mother. She examines the perhaps controversial idea that a woman can want to stay home with her children, without saying that she does not want to work, and the problems with simply glossing everything over with a cry for universal childcare. There are no answers here, but plenty of grist for the mill. Recommended.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A classic, of course, in its own right, this small book was almost single-handedly responsible for the beginning of consideration of the newborn, for introducing the ideas that the newborn could see, hear, and, especially, feel pain. It is, however, outdated in some respects, and has little respect for the mother or the work she does. The model he espouses is, also, more suited for a hospital setting than a homebirth setting. Still, no retrospective look at birth would be complete with this work.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is probably one of the most succinct books on childbirth in existence, and cuts right to the heart of what all expectant parents should know about the labor and birth process. I have quibbles with some of the advice given on positioning for labour; there is, after all, nothing whatsoever wrong with labouring in an upright position, but the relaxation and simple breathing advice can be transferred to other positions than the limited two suggested in the book. While the most would be gotten out of the book by taking a series of Bradley classes, the book is excellent in its own right as well. Recommended.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I started to read this book a long time ago, then had to return it to the library. I finally picked it back up again, and finished it this time. The book is both startling and not startling. While I wasn't previously aware of how insidiously industry has affected the nutrition advice that the general public receives, it wasn't as shocking as perhaps you'd hope it would be, as industry seems to have its fingers in every pot nowadays. Overall, the book is excellent and worth a read for the nitty-gritty details on some subjects. Recommended.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This book is primarily concerned with the first three months of a baby's life, and especially those that are considered to be 'colicky.' While not every newborn will need all parts of his 'Five S's,' I think it's safe to say that all parents can benefit from reading Karp's theory and at very least utilising the technique of swaddling, no matter the baby's colic status. His 'fourth trimester' theory especially deserves some consideration.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sociobiological, evolutionary, anthropological look at motherhood and 'mothering instincts,' this book can at times get bogged down in technicalities. Nevertheless, Hrdy does an fairly admirable job of examining research in these fields and relating it back to human mothering. Not for the casual reader, but those who have enjoyed <i>Our Babies, Ourselves</i> or similar work would probably find it intriguing, at the very least.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are points in this anthology when it feels as if the editor was stretching to find an appropriate piece from a given time frame to include. There are other points, however, where the flow of the pieces soars, and there is a cohesive thread running through the book. Perhaps the most startling realisation is hearing words from other years, other movements echoed in today's, and realising that as things change, things also have stayed very much the same. Recommended.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Careful observation will note I don't have much fiction on my list. This is one of those rare works of fiction, and it's historical fiction, one of the few places my fiction-reading ends up. The novel itself is somehow lighter than one would expect, given the subject matter and the ultimate fate of some of the characters. I could not, in the end, get too emotional invested in the characters, which I think is the only flaw of this well-written work. However, for fiction, I feel it is something of a large flaw.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I first started to read this book, I had no background for Ireland of 1915 and 1916, so I ended up setting it down for a time, finding out a little more, and subsequently had the context I personally felt I needed when I picked it up again. Another novel (!), but of course historical, I enjoyed this one far more than the previous. The characters were, with one exception, characters about which I cared, and the narrative was well-executed in its time-place and as a story standing alone. Recommended.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot say enough about this book. I wish I had the power to compell people to read it. Most people have generally accepted the idea of 'natural transfer' from chimpanzees to man being the causative factor in the beginnings of HIV (and subsequently, AIDS). Hooper argues convincingly against that hypothesis, however, and in the course of his investigations into plausible theories, stumbles upon one that is both likely - and horrible. Human experimentation, exploitation of other people by the West, exploitation of primates... all of these are involved, and the conclusions that can be drawn are frightening. Even if the hypothesis is ultimately disproven (which, in my opinion, seems unlikely), the tale can easily be one of a bullet dodged - there but for the grace of God. Every scientist, every person should read this book. Highly, highly recommended.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The zine <i>Hip Mama</i> is probably one of the most interesting, neatest things I learned about after having Gillian. This anthology of works originally presented in the zine is wonderful. Some of the pieces are funny, some sad, and some resonate deeply. Recommended.

163. <A HREF=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/038526108X/qid=1103774922/sr=2-1/ref=pd_ka_b_2_1/104-1197700-2151924""><i>Science Matters</i></A>, Robert Hazen & James Trefil.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subtitle of this book is 'Achieving Scientific Literacy,' and it accordingly lays out the basics of science, from physics to biology. The book itself is concise and clearly written; my concern lies in that the authors felt such a relatively simplistic book was needed for anyone who has completed high school, much less university. Still, the book could be very useful as a preview/review for high school science classes or curriculum.

164. <A HREF=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0399242570/qid=1103775137/sr=2-1/ref=pd_ka_b_2_1/104-1197700-2151924""><i>Wormwood</i></A>, G. P. Taylor.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fantasy geared towards 'young adults;' well, it's not my fault if I like it better than some of the stuff aimed towards 'adults.' Taylor is concise and weaves his words together very well, the characters draw you in, and the narrative is tight. Overall, a good read.</lj-cut>"

117. <i>A Good Birth, A Safe Birth</i>, Diana Korte & Roberta M. Scaer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>(R)</b>.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still a decent book, but it's amazing how out of date something from 1992 can be. A good book for background, perhaps, but readers would do well to seek out more current books as well.

118. <i>Sin City</i>, Max Allan Collins.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A light brain candy read.

119. <i>Birthing From Within</i>, Pam England & Rob Horowitz. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>(R)</b>.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the best books on birth out there. There are a few parts I would quibble with, but overall the 'advice' is stellar.

120. <i>Birth Your Way</i>, Sheila Kitzinger. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>(R)</b>.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes Kitzinger gets on my nerves, I admit it. But this is one of her better books and worth a read. More current than her <i>Homebirth</i>.

121. <i>Florida Getaway</i>, Max Allan Collins.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another light brain candy read.

122. <i>Gentle Birth Choices</i>, Barbara Harper. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>(R)</b>.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A classic that avoids the trap of becoming out of date by focusing on the ideal and not the current. Worth a read even if not interested in water birth per se.

123. <i>Anything But Straight</i>, Wayne R. Beson.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This book is chilling and frightening. It's also infuriating. The author details what 'ex-gay' 'ministries' really do and do not do, and it's horrifying to see the damage that they manage to inflict on people's self-image. 

124. <i>The Mother Trip</i>, Ariel Gore.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone praises Vicki Iovine's <i>Girlfriend's Guide</i> series when they really ought to reading more Ariel Gore. She tells it like it is, and doesn't sugar-coat things; somehow it's the sweeter for it.

125. <i>Baby Bargains</i>, Alan and Denise Fields. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>(R)</b>.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ignore any of their advice on co-sleeping or baby care, but for what they are good at - bargains - they are the best. Not a do-it-yourself type book, but about how to find deals, and how to cut to what you really <i>need</i>.

126. <i>Heat Wave</i>, Max Allan Collins.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet another light brain candy read. They're multiplying.

127. <i>The Worm in the Apple</i>, Peter Brimelow.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I disagree with some of the author's conclusions about what is to be done, and even do not necessarily agree with all of his assumptions and presuppositions, he does present that case against teacher unions. The problem lies not in their union function so much as in what they have taken on beyond it, and he does raise interesting questions about public sector and private sector unions, and their differences.

128. <i>Postmortem</i>, Patricia Cornwell.
129. <i>Body of Evidence</i>, Patricia Cornwell.
130. <i>All That Remains</i>, Patricia Cornwell.
131. <i>Cruel and Unusual</i>, Patricia Cornwell.
134. <i>The Body Farm</i>, Patricia Cornwell.
135. <i>From Potter's Field</i>, Patricia Cornwell.
136. <i>Cause of Death</i>, Patricia Cornwell.
137. <i>Unnatural Exposure</i>, Patricia Cornwell.
138. <i>Point of Origin</i>, Patricia Cornwell.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know how I can justify continuing to read these for so long. The first one or two were semi-enjoyable mysteries, and they were best-sellers, so I kept thinking that I must be about to get to something good. Unfortunately, no, I was not. Not even the persecuted lesbian subplot could rescue these horrible books.

132. <i>Pushed To The Edge</i>, Donna G. Corwin.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A book about competition and kids, and supposedly about how to make things better. I found description of the problem aplenty, but little to nothing about what could be done. Overall, a disappointment. (At least I didn't pay any tax for it.)

133. <i>Immaculate Deception II</i>, Suzanne Arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>(R)</b>.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A classic update of a classic. Every woman should read it.

139. <i>Listening To Your Baby</i>, Jay Gordon, M.D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>(R)</b>.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An excellent book about taking care of a newborn through the first year. Not so detailed as some, because in the end, you don't necessarily need the details. Recommended.

140. <i>Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies</i>, Jared Diamond. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did Europe conquer the Americas and not the other way around? Gun and germs, of course, you might say. Why did Europe have the guns and germs, though, and not the Americas? That's the question this book sets out to address, and it does it masterfully, putting to rest the racist theories once and for all. A Pulitzer Prize winner, and deservedly so.

141. <i>The Underground History of American Education</i>, John Taylor Gatto. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>(R)</b>.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't say enough good things about this book. The first time I read it, I felt like it had changed my life. I think it probably did. It's amazing in its scope and worth a detailed reading, and then a re-reading, and maybe a re-reading every singly year. A masterpiece.

142. <i>The Annotated Arch</i>, Carol Strickland. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A comprehensive but quick survey of the history of architecture. Well-executed and illustrated.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an extremely well-written argument against the idea that the Founding Fathers intended for God to have an honoured place in the Constitution. On the contrary, the authors show how, starting with Roger Williams, there has been a long stream of public servants dedicated to preserving the wall between church and state. In every era, there has been some opposition, but the possible outcomes if the wall were to be knocked down are mentioned, and it's clear that we've gotten to where we are because of the separation, not in spite of.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The title of this book very well could have been <i>Debunking the Myth of the American Dream</i>. Shipler makes it all too clear that people can work hard and still not make it. At the same time, he avoids the trap of placing all of the blame on 'the system.' The truth, it seems, lies somewhere in between, which he shows as he lets the reader look in on several people who are considered working poor. I've said before that every issue is, at its heart, a class issue; this book helps prove it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it too far-fetched to say that we can lay the blame for September 11, 2001 at Eisenhower's feet? Well, perhaps. But as this book shows, perhaps it's not so far-fetched at all to lay, for instance, the taking of hostages in Iran in 1979 at his feet. Ike approved the CIA to orchestrate a coup for the British government, oil at the heart of the problem, and while many of us in the United States still don't know about the United States' role in bringing the Shah to power in 1953, the people of Iran do know - and have. They had a popular, democratically elected leader before the CIA propped up the Shah, and from there they have learned to hate our government. It's sad and scary at the same time.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is yet another self-congratulatory memoir written by the mother of unschooled children, celebrating her children and their amazing success, which inevitably was achieved by her supreme wisdom of not teaching them anything. There are some admirable insights of the generic, family living, homeschooling-as-a-lifestyle type, but overall, I don't feel that there's much to offer in this book.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, Cleve. <3 This isn't a landmark book, but it's from the heart, and he really did have this amazing idea - just a little thing called the AIDS Quilt, you know. I'd seen the documentary, <i>Common Threads</i> earlier in the year, but I liked having a bit more fleshed out.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would highly recommend this book. It's easy to read and thought-provoking. While it deals specifically with what children are given to read in schools, many of the questions it poses are important to consider in the rest of life.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newest revision of a classic. It made me want to find a La Leche League meeting that I would enjoy attending! Of course, much of the material - benefits of breastfeeding, et cetera - I already knew, but sometimes it's nice to remember that you're doing a good job.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thoroughly enjoyed this lovely anthology of essays from women who had had a child during their teenage years. I really identified with the woman whose child was born when she was nineteen, obviously, but I felt that many of the things said by the writers were true not just of 'teen moms' but any non-traditional mother. Along the same lines as <i>Breeder</i>.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This book was more than a bit frightening, but I felt like it didn't put all the pieces together well. It gave me more reasons to feel the way I do about corporations, but no real suggestions.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I bought this over a year ago for light fun reading, thinking I needed more fiction in my life. I did enjoy the book, but I closed it utterly convinced that the narrator is actually a lesbian, and she never realised it. I really don't think this was the author's intent at all.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Penny Armstrong serves as a midwife in a predominantly Amish community; the way these women handle birth and sometimes death is amazing.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This book was so odd. I didn't know what to expect, and I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd hoped. It was set up as some big mystery, yet there didn't really seem to be much of a mystery at all.

112. <A HREF=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0738206091/qid=1088813717/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/103-1834579-5410267?v=glance&s=books&n=507846""><i>The Doula Book</i></A>, Klaus, Kennell, & Klaus.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the updated edition of <i>Mothering the Mother</i>, with new research and some expansion of content. It does an excellent job of enumerating the benefits of a doula, and how a doula fits into a family dynamic. Ultimately, though, I think it would be lovely if everyone could have a situation like I do - where they don't have to hire a doula, but instead have a friend or friends who is competent to do the job.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had forgotten how very much I enjoyed this book. It's an honest look at how midwives work, though I feel more focus could have been put on direct-entry midwives over nurse-midwives. I definitely would recommend it, however.

114. <A HREF=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0897893778/qid=1088813838/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/103-1834579-5410267?v=glance&s=books&n=507846""><i>Unassisted Childbirth</i></A>, Laura Kaplan Shanley.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't think unassisted childbirth is necessarily what should be strove for by women; yes, it sometimes happens, <i>but</i>. I didn't agree with some of the precepts, so couldn't embrace her argument built on those. A woman in labour is not usually capable of true self-assessment.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this is an excellent book. When you combine it with a read of <i>Expecting Trouble</i>, it presents an idea of what prenatal care <i>could</i> accomplish and on what it needs to put more focus. After reading the two books, I really want to write a magazine article about true prenatal care. Someday.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had had this sitting on my shelf for quite some time (since the fall, IIRC), and finally decided to pick it up at the end of March. I was pleasantly surprised. A novel that bills itself as an introduction to philosophy, and is translated from the Norwegian, at that, sounded a bit dry, but it wasn't. The story was good, and the introduction to philosophy was well-done and truly integrated into the storyline. I would recommend this book.

074. <A HREF=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0812550544/qid=1088801783/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/103-1834579-5410267?v=glance&s=books&n=507846""><i>Haunted America</i></A>, Michael Norman & Beth Scott.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Picked this up because I hadn't read any good ghost stories in awhile and wanted some light easy reading (this was around the time we were getting ready to move). The stories were enjoyable enough, I had to make sure I stopped reading before too late at night - and I sold the book to McKay's after reading it.

075. <A HREF=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0805076336/qid=1088801896/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/103-1834579-5410267?v=glance&s=books&n=507846""><i>Gay Marriage: Why It Is Good for Gays, Good for Straights, and Good for America</i></A>, Jonathan Rauch.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The striking thing about this book, which I think might honestly change some minds if it found a wide enough audience, is that the author writes from an essentially conservative position. It is not the position of someone who wants to see marriage eventually abolished, or even reformed in some way, but rather the position of someone who embraces traditional marriage. From that base, he present his arguments that gay marriage would strengthen and enhance all traditional marriages, and traditional marriage as an institution. While I don't agree with all of his premises, his argument is cogent and has the real possiblity to change some minds.

076. <A HREF=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1555830064/qid=1088802082/sr=8-2/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i2_xgl14/103-1834579-5410267?v=glance&s=books&n=507846""><i>The Men With the Pink Triangle</i></A>, Heinz Heger.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even today, the rarely mentioned victims of the Holocaust are the homosexuals. Vilified by all the other prisoners, very few apparently survived the horrors of Hitler's camp. One man that did agreed to tell his story, as recounted by Heinz Heger. The account is otherwise anonymous; when it was published in the early 1970s, anti-gay sentiment in West and East Germany was quite high. This doesn't have the same analysis and historical context that <i>The Pink Triangle</i> does, but I think the two combined present a much fuller picture of that piece of World War II/Holocaust history.

077. <A HREF=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0664241859/qid=1088802258/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/103-1834579-5410267?v=glance&s=books&n=507846""><i>Jonathan Loved David: Homosexuality in Biblical Times</i></A>, Tom Horner.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An older book by an Episcopalian priest, it sets out linearly through the Bible to analyze instances in which homosexuality was mentioned, setting it in context, as well as the laws concerning homosexuality. Overall, I thought it was a good, scholarly examination; while the author is obviously sympathetic to gays, it's not an obviously biased presentation.

078. <A HREF=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1567182283/qid=1088802722/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/103-1834579-5410267?v=glance&s=books&n=507846""><i>Pagans & Christians: The Personal Spiritual Experience</i></A>, Gus diZerenga.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really enjoyed this book. The author, while Pagan, was much more sensitive to Christian beliefs than many Christians would be to Pagan beliefs. I can't really articulate the thrust of the book, as it was complex - enumerating Pagan beliefs, comparison and contrast with some Christian beliefs, and more - but it was enlightening and well done. Part of the reason I call myself 'Christopagan.' :) I think anyone would learn from it, however.

079. <A HREF=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0028642848/qid=1088803452/sr=8-5/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i5_xgl14/103-1834579-5410267?v=glance&s=books&n=507846""><i>The Complete Idiot's Guide to Getting and Owning A Dog</i></A>, Sheila Webster Boneham, Ph.D.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I picked this up because Gillian wants a dog, and we probably will acquire one at some point. Comprehensive and easy to read, but a little bit of over emphasis on purebreds.

080. <A HREF=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1587611104/qid=1088803561/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/103-1834579-5410267?v=glance&s=books&n=507846""><i>After the Baby's Birth, Revised Edition</i></A>, Robin Lim.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a lovely book; it's got parts that are similar to <i>Natural Health After Birth</i> and other parts that align more with <i>Mothering the New Mother</i>. Overall, there are very few books about what happens to the <i>mother</i> after the baby is born, and so it fills a valuable niche. 

081. <A HREF=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0156006170/qid=1088803741/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/103-1834579-5410267?v=glance&s=books&n=507846""><i>The Gay Metropolis</i></A>, Charles Kaiser.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meant to be a history of gay life in New York City (primarily), I really thought of it more as a light-hearted history book. Of course there are not-so-joyful moments, but the overall tone was one of celebration, making it quite enjoyable to read.

082. <A HREF=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0553382179/qid=1088803867/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/103-1834579-5410267?v=glance&s=books&n=507846""><i>Sink Reflections</i></A>, Marla Cilley.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For people who are truly overwhelmed with clutter or simply don't know where to start, this is a good book. For the rest of us, even those of us who could use to clean more often than we do, the book can be summarise thusly: Declutter, and do a little bit of a cleaning at a time. The tips on routines and zones for each week are useful, but can be found at <A HREF=""http://www.flylady.net"">http://www.flylady.net</A>.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really love this series. Designed as a read-aloud for grammar-age (K-4) students, the writing is clear and concise, and worth reading for 'background' for any age. Obviously not a comprehensive text for any other age group, as the dates are kept on a separate page in the back, and not as detailed a list as would be studied later on, it's a relatively inexpensive introduction. Good for homeschooling or just supplementing.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I read this to get an idea of the writing and story to know whether I wanted to read these books (<i>Magic Tree House</i>) to Gillian or not. I wouldn't want a child reading them by his or herself, as the writing contains fragments galore, but they're good as read-alouds.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original was excellent; it only improved on it. Not much new material was added, per se, but there were several changes in resources and enough new insights as well to make it worth the purchase. Highly, highly recommended.

This was an amazing movie that I thoroughly enjoyed. It's still not out in a general release, but every effort should be made to see this sweet, touching movie. It's sweet without being over the top, and it has little-known actors in the leads carrying it out beautifully. Go. Watch this film.</lj-cut>

<i>Seabiscuit</i>

Another excellent film; the way it was narrated and put together was truly artistic, bridging the distance between merely being a dramatisation and becoming a true film, a work of art. The performances were all excellent, and there wasn't a sense of seeing the actor, but seeing the role. Well-done.</lj-cut>"

<i>Common Threads: Stories From The Quilt</i>

This was made in 1989, and I think I remember hearing of it previously, but this was the first time I'd seen it. The frightening aspect, in my opinion, was that so much of it resonated still, fifteen years later (another sobering thought, there, that it's been so long that we've lived with AIDS in this country). By 1989, more Americans had died of AIDS than died in the Vietnam War. I am certain that far, far more Americans have died of AIDS than as a result of terrorism. Yet the nation's priorities in 2004 are on terrorism, illegitimate wars, and curtailing our civil liberties, not finding any more solutions to this modern-day plague. There were just five stories told in depth in the documentary; multiply the sorrow and heartbreak by thousands.</lj-cut>"

I had skimmed this book when I had first purchased it, but otherwise hadn't returned to it in the two-plus (I think) years that I've owned it. Like all of the Sears' books, it bears a certain smugness and self-righteousness about their parenting style, and how well their kids have turned out. Still, if one can look past the tone, this is one of their more helpful books, at least in the second part of it, which details specific steps and suggestions for specific qualities. The most helpful thing, however, was something they gathered from an interview with a parent, the idea of a ""Basic Five"" for all children to get each day - reading, outside play, arts/crafts, music, and quiet play.</lj-cut>"

Movie: DareDevil
I was actually looking forward to seeing this movie - it has Jennifer Garner in it, after all! - but I found myself remembering the different reviews I had skimmed once I started watching it, and agreeing with them. The movie was not particularly <i>bad</i>, per se, but it could have been so much <i>better</i>. I can't pinpoint a reason, for it was reasonably scripted, and decently acted, leaving to conclude the fault lies in the directing. If they do a sequel, I would watch it, but only on DVD.</lj-cut>"

Math for the non-mathematician - hoorah. While I have a decent command of beginning calculus, and a better grasp on algebra, it was nice to read about the math without having to strain my brain horribly. The author debunks most allegations of phi being used in art, but that doesn't change the fact that it seems almost omnipresent in nature. Fascinating.</lj-cut>

A combination simple pregnancy diary and basic introduction-to-pregnancy book, it's about all the pregnancy diary that many would want, especially those with one or more children already. The pages between the different diary sections would help trigger reading and thinking about other subjects, making it an excellent book to tie things together.</lj-cut>

There actually isn't a 'Story Collection' in one volume of Kaya's stories, as there is for the older American Girls, but it's a good unit to summarise the six Kaya stories. They follow nine-year-old Kaya, a Nez Perce girl, through her daily life. Children's books, but rich in detail and accuracy.</lj-cut>

A sweeping, succinct overview of the novel, drama, poetry, autobiography, and history all, along with well-done annotated book lists and concrete suggestions on how to read and how to get a great deal out of these books. My only qualm? Nothing about notable science works, and how to read those.</lj-cut>"

I cut my fantasy teeth on Eddings; specifically, his <i>Belgariad</i> and <i>Malleorean</i> cycles. They, moreso than <i>The Elenium</i> and <i>The Tamuli</i>, are beloved books, tying me to a time, a place, a group of people in so many ways. More recent books, single volume efforts, have only further endeared these authors to me, so I was anticipating great things when I read this book. 
But I've seen these characters before, these personalities, these quirks. I've seen the reluctance to leadership, the reticience, the little girls kissing grown men into doing her will. The story is different, yes; there's not a quest for a stone of some type, just a fight against an evil known as The Vlagh. Even the interesting names have fled in some ways, half of the characters christened monikers such as Longbow, Red-Beard, Ham-Hand, and Rabbit. 
Will I read the other volumes in this new series? Certainly. Will I enjoy them? Most likely. But will I wish the characters less familiar, the names less pedestrian, fit to the grandeur of the plot unfolding? Without a doubt.</lj-cut>"

<A HREF=""http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/biblio?inkey=7-0671027360-0""><i>Angels & Demons</i></A>, Dan Brown

<i>Angels & Demons</i> is the first story about Robert Langdon, the protagonist of <i>The Da Vinci Code</i>, and it's similar in many ways - a threat to the Catholic Church from various elements traditionally positioned against it, and Robert saves the day with the help of some leggy attractive European girl. This is <i>not</i> a future bit of great writing - neither is <i>The Da Vinci Code</i>, to be honest, but it tapped into a subject about which there was a great deal of growing interest, hence its explosion (at least, that's my theory). On the other hand, there's seemingly just as much to investigate beyond the book on this one as well, and that hasn't been done, for whatever reason. Overall, the character is interesting, and the book, like its successor, is good at condensing these issues for a nice overview - which makes me anticipate the next, just to see what it covers.</lj-cut>

This magazine is always so disturbing, so anger-inducing, but it's equally like a trainwreck - so well-done, so well-researched, that you have to look, you have to read, so that at least there's an accounting of what is happening, so that one day, one day there might be a reckoning.
And when that day comes, all the old issues of <i>Mother Jones</i> will tell us what people need to answer, and what they have to answer for. 
February 2003? The liars in the Pentagon. Grover Norquist. The people who let Liberia happen, unabated. Death penalties. So many problems, so well-documented. It's a call to arms, and an indictment. 
God, please let the trials of our country end soon, and let us put them on 'trial.'</lj-cut>"

<i>The Laramie Project</i>, Unrated

<i>The Laramie Project</i> covers how five people went to Laramie, Wyoming in the aftermath of the Matthew Shepard murder. The result has them interview townspeople and showing bits of those interviews entwined with the timeline of what happened to Matthew Shepard, from the night he entered the bar until the end of the trials of his killers. I'm not sure what I was expecting from this production, but it wasn't what I watched. It felt vaguely empty, and in a strange way too sympathetic to the townspeople of Laramie, because whatever they said, the killers were from Laramie, they were raised there, and they learnt that attitude there, and to absolve an entire community from blame seems to someone cheapen Matthew Shepard's life. I'm sure that wasn't the intention of the film's makers at all, however, which is why the whole production struck a dischordant note with me, overall. It did intensify my desire to see <i>Angels in America</i>, though.</lj-cut>"

The issue had two commentaries on Dean's campaign, plus what I term a 'handicappers' ' guide to the 2004 primary 'season.' Some of the issues raised make me afraid that the Democratic establishment will try to hand-select the nominee instead of letting the people do it, but I don't think they dare risk it, especially not with another Nader candidacy in the wings. The 'special report' group of articles for the month was on 'low-wage America,' but really basically underscored the importance of unions and <i>fair</i> trade (as opposed to free trade) policies. Also a disturbing smaller story on an effort to replace FDR on the dime with the nasty man Reagan. Overall, of typical quality, and slightly higher interest than some issues.</lj-cut>

This is an older book, copyright 1986, and I suspect it was the only one of its kind that many people knew of for quite awhile. Now I have at least two other books covering some if not all of the same areas, and it's obvious that the later books benefitted from more information, and more current information. Yes, even in the herbal world, things do change! Mainly, though, the changes are more reflective in changes in birth practices, infant care practices, and a few areas of side effects and scientific research. Still, anyone reading this book would do well to compare to a more current book, or talk to a currently practicing herbalist about what might need to be modified. I can't think of anything in the Pregnancy chapter that would need to be, but a few things under Childbirth and five or so under Infant Care. The instructions for preparing the formulations have excellent troubleshooting pointers, but I'd still read other directions and compare, regardless of who either author is! Overall, an little book packed to the seams with information, and little chafe.</lj-cut>"

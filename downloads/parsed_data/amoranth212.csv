"event","What I've done since I've been home:  Sat around, slept, ate, showered, computered, videogamed, and that's pretty much it.  Being home has induced a lethargy unlike any which I have experienced. I've become so accustomed to having people to bug, places to go, that even a day's deprivation has made me bored out of my mind.  

One good thing, though, I do have time to read for fun now. (And to update. ^_~) Also, I'm playing ""Creatures"" again, which is good times. (Creatures is an Artificial Life game, and an assload of fun!) You raise these little things called ""norns"", and you can breed them, feed them, watch the bad creatures (grendels) harass them, or pump them full of weird hormones and chemicals! ^_^  They all have their own unique genome, and surprisingly complex brain and body functions.  

Anyway, I'll prolly start working for mom soon, doing hard labor.  I'll probably end up getting the black lung.  Or the brown lung from shoveling horse shizznit.  TEN HOURS of unpaid labor per week, THEN I get paid for my work. But, for now, I'm gonna go get a movie. Bye."

"event","I hate it when I sleep too late. ARGH!!  This morning I slept in until 9:30.  Guess when my first class is on Tuesdays.  NINE-FREAKIN'-THIRTY!  But I was only ten minutes late, so I'm mildly impressed with myself. Fastest morning routine ever!  Ah, well.  I'll probably write more later, for now, I'm going to attempt to do something productive.  No, really.  I mean it this time.  Don't look at me that way! ^_^"

"event","This is my very first entry, obviously.  I figured it was time for the world to hear my thoughts, because they are certainly not expressed enough. ^_^  

Do you ever closely inspect a commonly used word, and find that it actually is quite bizarre looking?  Like the word first. F-I-R-S-T.  Looks weird, doesn't it?

Anyway, I was up crazy late on Saturday, working on a short story due on Sunday at noon.  It was quite violent and fun! ^_^ I also had to read three other stories that people in my class wrote, and edit them.  Much like me, they can't write worth a crap.  I pretty much tore them apart. XD  I'm evil.

Oh, man.  I have two words for you: Kill Bill.  This is one of the best movies I have EVER seen.  I am truly obsessed.  It has everything: cool plot, samurai, black humor, bad-ass people kicking each other's asses, and of course, so much blood it's funny.  Me and some of my friends are going to the premiere of Kill Bill Vol. 2 on April 16th.  I want to go dressed as the characters (yes, I'm an dork, but it wasn't me that suggested it.), and I think my friends think I'm insane.  However, I have found that after three hours of searching the internet, including eBay, that NO ONE has bright yellow pants, let alone ones like the tracksuit in the movie.  ARGH! I'm determined to get some, though. (No jokes, Tori) Anyway, I'm tired.  I'm gonna go now."

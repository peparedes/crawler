just look up the lyrics on google search or something. 
THE FIRST ONE IS <b>U2</B>, OKAY?
*sigh*

I will post it one more time.

<b>1 -</b> How long, how long must we sing this song?
<b>2 -</b> I have been floated to this thought this hour / on a series of events I cannot explain 
<b>3 -</b> Best girl I ever had (she never made me mad)
<b>4 -</b> To touch is to heal / to hurt is to steal, if you want to kiss the sky, better learn how to kneel
<b>5 -</b> When I get to California I'm gonna write my name in the sand...
<b>6 -</b> Well, the rain exploded with a mighty crash as we fell into the sun
<b>7 -</b> Meet me in outerspace / we could spend the night, watch the earth come up 
<b>8 -</b> A smoke-filled room in a corner basement / The situation must be right
<b>9 -</b> Many times I've gazed / along the open road
<b>10 -</b> When they drill holes in your skull / and screwed that halo to your head / did you think you could fly?

"event","Two things. 

One the Starship concert was awesome even though Mickey Thomas did all the lead singing. They did Jane and We built This City and Somebody to Love. It's all good.

AAAH. I was the seventh caller! On the classic rock station they always give stuff away to the seventh person to call in. And I always call in. Every time. It's usually something I don't really like, either. I never get it. But this time, I GOT IT. And it was tickets to go see the premiere of the Who recorded concert <i>Isle of Wight in 1970</i>. And a Who poster. And I qualify to win a trip to Cali to SEE the Who.

Aaaaah."

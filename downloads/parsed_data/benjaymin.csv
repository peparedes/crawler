I  guess I shouldn't of got excited about it. Now I'm all sad, but I'll get over it.
And no-one reading this will know what the fuck this is on about..but you don't really need to know I guess, seeing as it never happened.

Joel, I'm taking refuge on your bed, its so much comfier than mine.
Jepha, we so need to get together and just watch movies and eat junk food again. It was fun. But you stole my Oreo!!!"

"event","today was fun. 
I was attacked with a water pistol. Got my sandwich eaten. Dyed some one's hair with mustard. Watched them wash it out with dish soap. And all of that was with Jepha. He now smells of dishes.

And I talked to my dearest brothers. They both rock!
Oooh, and I made pancakes with Joel"

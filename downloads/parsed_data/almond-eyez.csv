<P>I decided it was time for me to get a new journal. I'm EXTREMELY sick of&nbsp; almond_eyez. If you want to be added to my new journal, comment &amp; I'll add you as soon as I can. <b>YOU MUST COMMENT ON MY NEW JOURNAL TO BE ADDED, if you comment here or don't comment at all, you will not be added.</b> If you hardly ever comment on this journal, then don't bother being added to my new one. I would love to hear from my friends but some of you are slacking on the comment department. I might come back occasionally to update this lj but not liklely. ciao"

(Sara+Natalie=B.F.F) Not as easy as it looks...

<img src=http://img55.photobucket.com/albums/v167/SimplyySara/Picture_214.jpg>
Suppossed to say ""Happy Birthday Pete!""but I had a hard time writing it...

We tried on making sand angels, but it didn't work out too well. I was too weak to make one and you could barely see them, so Natalie and I decided not to take pictures. Got back to the room, drank coffee, talked, then got ready.

contrary, you're the ultimate good guy, but you're one tough character,
rough and tumble, ready for anything. You call the shots and go your

any situation, usually by rushing into the thick of the action. You're
not polished and you're not overly warm, but you're a straight shooter

While you aren't actually a true regular polyhedron, you are the only die that makes logical sense--metrically speaking. Chances are, others see you as over-analytical or a goody-goody. While that may be true, you also have a gift for patience and tolerance. Growing up you probably had a calculator wristwatch that you never really needed to use (since you were faster on your own), and you probably aced all your classes (except for gym). You use the metric system almost exclusively, but are able to quickly convert in mid-conversation for the sake of your backwards Imperalist friends. You've coded in at least two different programming languages, and have created more original gaming systems than you'll ever admit. You're generally not a show-off, but you do take pride in being called either a geek or a nerd.</blockquote>Im 2.5 hours into the (roughly) 8 hours of training this weekend on 6th century BC prophetic literature in the bible, taught by a professor who has great trouble sticking to the syllabus.  Summary of the last 2.5 hours (lifted from said syllabus):<blockquote><b>Putting it All Together</b>

<li>The prophetic worldview should bring humility, gratefulness, and hope to the believer; but when it is perverted, it brings elitism, pride, and false security.  We should reflect on where those who profess faith in our culture stand today; and especially where our hearts should be in repentance, humility, hope, and service to our world.</li>
<li>Understanding the characteristic symptoms of idolatry gives us insight into our culture and ourselves.</li>
<li>Even when mighty empires rule the earth, the God of little Judah speaks through His prophets against their idolatry, pride, and dehumanizing behavior; and then He executes the judgments He predicted.</li>
<li>In each historical situation we see how God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble who seek Him.</li></blockquote>"

<font size=""+0""><b><span style=""color: #00cc00"">TRUE</span></b></font> Harry the bar-tender at college (who was from the town I was born in - more on <i>that</i> later), then there was &quot;C&quot; (name hidden to protect the guilty) - my college roommate who was part of a small group who tried to form an official chapter on the Church of Satan, and then there was John - one of the guys I worked with at Burger King in the summer of 1989.</li>

<li><font size=""+0""><b>Over the years I've been accused of being a Satanist, a cult-leader and dabbling in black magic (though not all at the same time).</b></font>

<font size=""+0""><b><span style=""color: #00cc00"">TRUE</span></b></font> Once in 1990, and once in 2004.  Needless to say, both accusations were utterly groundless but at the time hurt like h**l!</li>

<li><font size=""+0""><b>Two of my friends are/were coke addicts. <i>(to clarify: that's <u>cocaine</u> not Coca Cola!)</i></b></font>

<font size=""+0""><b><span style=""color: #00cc00"">TRUE</span></b></font> I wont reveal their names, I'll just call them &quot;C&quot; (my Satanist roommate) and &quot;J&quot; who I met here in the USA.</li>

<li><font size=""+0""><b>I had a permanent, positive, life altering experience while a part of a recovery (12 step-alike) group.</b></font>

<font size=""+0""><b><span style=""color: #00cc00"">TRUE</span></b></font> A good friend lead a <a href=""http://www.celebraterecovery.com/index.asp"">Celebrate Recovery</a> group a few years ago and asked me to help co-lead.  <a href=""http://www.celebraterecovery.com/index.asp"">Celebrate Recovery</a> is based around 8 recovery principles that follow the beatitudes found in Matthew chapter 5, and that closely mirror/merge the steps in a 12-step program.  God used the group as a crowbar to lever me out of my complacent state, and into applying for and persevering through the Vineyard seminary training.  The 8 recovery principles say:

<ol><li><i><span style=""color: #800000"">Realize I'm not God; I admit that I am powerless to control my tendency to do the wrong thing and my life is unmanageable.</span></i> In other words, stop living in denial - specifically the denial that God wants to use me in pastoral ministry.</li>
<li><i><span style=""color: #800000"">Earnestly believe that God exists, that I matter to him, and that he has the power to help me recover.</span></i> Insanity is defined as doing the same thing over and over again, having it fail, yet running right back to it thinking that &quot;this time it might be different&quot; - the path of sanity being to stop running from God, to believe that He wants the best for me, and will empower me to accomplish all He's called me to do.</li>
<li><i><span style=""color: #800000"">Consciously choose to commit all my life and will to Christ's care and control.</span></i> In my walk forward through seminary level training, while it will tear me apart (I mean, <i>is currently / will continue to</i>) and reassemble me, Jesus is in total control and the process of transformation is for the benefit of myself and all those around me.</li>
<li><i><span style=""color: #800000"">Openly examine and confess my faults to God, to myself, and to myself, to God, and to someone I trust.</span></i> Admit to myself and to others that God wants me to go through <a href=""http://www.vli.org/"">Vineyard Leadership Institute</a> training, with the ultimate confession being my filled in application forms</li>

What about the fact that I graduate from <a href=""http://www.vli.org/"">VLI</a> training in June?

"event","Well, <lj user=""delayra""> managed to successfully mutate a meme saying, ""<i>But I'm all for a double dose of truth... so I'm going to post both here and in my reply on her journal, four truths and a lie</i>""

So I'm torn between being true to the original (and posting 2 truths) or being open, honest and transparent and posting 4 truths.  Hmmm.

<ul><li>I've known three bona-fide, out-and-out, practicing Satanists.</li>
<li>Over the years I've been accused of being a Satanist, a cult-leader and dabbling in black magic (though not all at the same time).</li>
<li>Two of my friends are/were coke addicts.</li>
<li>I had a permanent, positive, life altering experience while a part of a recovery (12 step-alike) group.</li>
<li>Although I presently live in the USA, I was born in England.</li></ul>
Reply as to which you think is my lie, and I'll respond privately... and then you need to post your four truths along with one lie in your own journal.

I will provide answers in a week on my journal."

"event","If anyone knows how to get a Compaq Presario (Desktop) 5004US machine to behave I'd like to hear it.  The HDD failed, we got another one that supports the newer ATA133 protocol.  Since the machine is old enough to not be up to standard, we picked up a Belkin Ultra ATA133 card to go with it.  Thing is, the Compaq BIOS isnt allowing the card to broadcast the presence of our shiny new 120Gb HDD attached to it, and is complaining about not being able to find an operating system, when (strangely enough) the Windows install happily used the ATA133 card and installed just fine.

"event","...preparing a sermon.  I know in the broadest sense what I want to say, but actually getting an outline that looks logical? Hmmmph!

It's been a while since I visited, but it seems that <a href=""http://www.hollybushchristianfellowship.co.uk/index.htm"">Hollybush Christian Fellowship</a> has a website.  Reading through it certainly brings back memories!  They say<blockquote>We are a Christian Fellowship with a Church on a Farm. God spoke this place into being through the prophetic Word in 1968. The Fellowship has since moved buildings four times and now meets in a building which will seat around 800 people.</blockquote>Im not sure <i>what</i> denomination they are affiliated with though.

I know - Im supposed to be preparing and reading and stuff, and finding websites for places I last visited in 1990 is a <i>total</i> distraction ... it could be worse though.  Thinking of which ... Im hungry ... maybe I'll just go make myself a peanut butter sandwich."

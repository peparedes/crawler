Gooo, I havent written in this thing in a long ass time, I doubt anyone ever reads it anyway. Oh well! My day was pretty cool considering I didn't do just the same old bullshit that I usually do! Katrina and Cale came to my house around 12 and then we went back to Katrina's. When we got bored we decided to go to the mall. The mall was alot funner today than most days. We met this guy that was JayJay's friend named Eric who was trying to fight some other dude. haha! I also saw Darth Vader there! When we left the mall we went JayJay and Eric's appartment and watched a movie BUT DIDN'T GET TO FINISH IT! *angry face* Me, Katrina and Cale went to the mall and then to Katrina's to pick up her medicine. Then we went to the beach where I got to see GLENN!!!!!! I LOVE HIM SO MUCH! Derek and Dylan met us at the beach too. It started raining hard though...so we all left and went to shakey. Glenn left like 10 minutes after we got there! *sad face* but that's okay! I'll see him again Sunday and I had fun during that last 10 minutes! *smile* Anyway, when we left shakey we went to Derek's then to McDonalds. Me and Katrina got home around 2:45 and I think I'm about to go to sleep. So that pretty much sums up my entire night!

"event","This morning I woke up at 4 feeling sick and didn't go back to sleep. So, I got a total of 1 and a half hours of sleep. (I think) At 6am me, Katrina, Trena and Tyler left for Astroworld and Waterworld. On the way up there I watched 50 First Dates and I liked it. The parks were fun, but considering I had ONE hour of sleep, it was VERY exhausting!!! After riding every ride there that was running we left and got home around 7:30. Glenn came to see me around 9 and left at 11. *I love Glenn* So yeah, I guess you could say today was a good/fun day!

P.S. I got a T-shirt that has that old guy, that stars in the Astroworld commercials and dances, on it! *BIG SMILEY HERE*
HE IS THE SHIT and that's my new favorite shirt. (Even though nobody usually sees my shirts anyway) HAHA!"

"event","Ok, well me and Katrina THOUGHT we were going to bed ,BUT we decided to break open the red stuff ,because we had been planning on doing that for weeks now. (the high people told us to) So, we broke it open and rubbed it all over our hands. IT WAS GREAT FUN!!!!! Then, we tried to wash it off and uh...yeah-it turned evil on us. IT'S REALLY REALLY STICKY. It's still on our hands, I don't think its coming off either. Oh, well it was still fun. Oh yeah, and because of the red stuff I took off my bracelet/string thing for the first time in 2 years. *lil sad face* Oh well, we're going to sleep now. Unless something exciting happens again. heh!"

"event","Hmm..yesterday Me, Katrina and Brianne went to shakey. It was really boring so me, Katrina and Cale rode with Dylan to the boardwalk. Derek and Brianne met us there later. It was much funner there. We played at the park until around 2. Then me, Trina and Bri came back to my house.

Today me, Katrina and Brianne went to shakey, although I don't really know why..I guess we thought it'd be more fun than it was last night ,but it wasn't. We left there and went to McDonalds til Mikey showed up around 1 and we went home. Now Katrina is soaking her finger in some medicated water stuff and then we're going to bed. (Katrina loves her medicine and I love Glenn!)END."

"event","Today I woke up around 9 and Glenn came to see me before he had to go to work. I LOVE GLENN! When he left I went to my little sister's dance recital. She's so great, I love her too. The rest of the day was really boring, I did nothing. I went to sleep around 10 and I just woke up before Trena got home. Now I'm going to stay up to talk to Kyle (Kyle kicks ass!) and wait for Glenn to call me around 6! Hopefully tomorrow (or actually today) will be more fun!"

We got some on film..it was great ,but it eventually got boring so we went upstairs and went to sleep along with Katrina. I woke up around 9 and Glenn picked me up around 10! I stayed with him for the next 14 hours and then Katrina picked me up and I came home! *BIG, happy smiley here* I LOVE GLENN SO MUCH!

"event","I started the day off by going to sleep at 9am after realizing my life was perfect when I was drinking coffee milk, eating a donut, smoking a cigarette and playing minesweeper while thinkin about how much I love Glenn.*happy smiley here* What a great combination. (and btw..yes, doing all those things at once does take talent) Then, I woke up around 2 and sat around my house til 5 when Katrina picked me up and we went to meet Dylan at the mall. We left the mall and went to Dereks ,but of course he was still sleeping and wouldn't answer his door! *angry smiley here* We later picked Derek up and went back to the mall. (I saw Ali at the mall..yay) When the mall closed everyone went to the boardwalk and me, Katrina and Derek played in the fountain until the water got turned off. We were SOO cold afterwards...but it's okay, WE LIVED! Me, Katrina, Derek, Cale and Dylan stayed there until 2ish then me and Katrina decided to come home. So, here I am...and now I'm going to sleep. (p.s. Katrina drove home wearing NO pants)HAHA

I LOVE GLENN!!!!!!"

"event","Well, I am bored and staying home because my throat hurts so I decided to write in my lil journal thingy! Derek told me to make one a LONG time ago and I did, but I never wrote anything in it. Oh well..better late than never, right? Oh yeah..Hey Katrina, thanks for coming up with a great title for my journal..you rule. HAHA! 

ANYWAY..today was a weird and exhausting day, however it was GREAT FUN! Last night around 9 Brianne decides that we are going to take a little road trip to Houston or Lafayette even though we had nothing todo when we got there..haha! So she picked up me and Derek and we stopped by to visit Cale before our lil trip. He wanted us to kidnap him for the night and we were SOOO close to doing it ,but we don't want him in more trouble than he's already in. Then, we decide that instead of going to Lafayette or Houston we want to go to New Orleans because Derek had never been there before. So....WE WENT TO NEW ORLEANS AT 10 O'CLOCK PM!! we get there around 2:30 and stay until almost 4. haha I got some beads from a bum that I gave 50 cents to. He was really nice and I feel sorry for him. :( KATRINA was supposed to come with us, but she was busy. Oh well, maybe next time she'll come and we'll stay longer haha! WELL ANYWAY, the ride there and back was really fun..I got to know some new interesting things about Derek and Brianne through a lil game called bullshit and we discovered that we love apple pies. We went to the boardwalk at 7ish and me and Derek watched some funny kids play in the fountain. HAHA we wanted to get in that water so bad, but we refrained from doing it. I got home around 8, went to sleep and woke up around 1:45 when Kayla called me! I MISS HER..its okay she'll be back soon!

I LOVE GLENN!!!!

ok, I would say more ,but you're probably bored (im still wondering if anyone is even going to read this) BUT yeah...I'm thirsty too, so I'm ending this now. 


PEACE OUTSIDE...DAMN YOU...YOU KNOW WHAT I SAYING!!!"

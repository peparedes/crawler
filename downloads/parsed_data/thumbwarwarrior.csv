"event","I don't even want to talk about it. It makes me sick really. So Saturday we made empanadas, Laura was here, and we had invited Franco. Franco. Not Franco and Dex. I found out only minutes before that Dex was in town with Franco. Hunter asked me if I wanted to uninvite him, but I didn't want to be rude. I wanted to prove (more to myself than anyone) that I could act with dignity and grace. I did, for the most part. I couldn't help but be mean to Dex a little. I really couldn't help it when I got encouragement from Laura and later Hunter. I could deal with the situation fine enough, but it was too much when Dex started talking to me about her relationship with Franco and then trying to get me to console her. I felt so dirty. I felt like I was the dirty mistress meeting the wife. I've never been the mistress, always the wife. I dear god I'm gonna cry! I want to pretend that nothing happened that night that our friendship is as it's always been. I want to pretend so that I don't have to admit to anyone that I'm hurt. I need to tell someone. I can't tell Hunter cause Franco's his friend. I want to tell Talia but I still don't have my phone. I don't want to tell Ashley cause I don't want to disappoint her. I think what I'm most upset about is that he lied to me. I said that he told me he and Dex weren't having sex anymore. I don't even get an explanation, and I'm not sure I want to deal with one. I'm just tired of being used. I'm tired of being with guys that I'm not in a relationship with. I think if I ever get the chance I'll tell him just that. Hunter told me that Dex came in order for them to try out being in a relationship and that in all probability she was going to go back to Gainesville disappointed. I'm sure something else will happen, maybe I will get my chance. I kind of hope I will, at the same time I kind of hope I won't have to, can't fathom anything will ever turn out how I want."

"event","So I made a huge mistake last Sunday. Hunter, Franco, and I were hanging out and it seems that Franco didn't want to go home so we came back here after doing some groceries. So we started playing a drinking game version of Uno, which did not end well on my part. I got drunk for the first time, not just tipsy, but full-out wha? So much that when I stopped drinking I went to the bathroom to pee and got dizzy and nauseous and didn't make it to the tub in time. I threw up on the carpet, shower curtain, and a bit on my pants. I didn't want the guys to know so I stuffed everything in the washer and took a shower. As I was showering Franco comes into the bathroom telling me he and Hunter are going to go to Taco Bell and if I was going to be alright. He then kissed me. I was freaking out cause I could taste the vomit on my mouth and after he left I washed my mouth in the shower. A couple seconds later he came back and kissed me again. This time I felt better. When they came back I was dressed already for bed and Hunter just kind of threw us into my room and closed my door. I didn't think anything would happen since nothing does but it did. Yes it did. I slept with Franco. Although he did his part okay (he's a giver), I can't help but think I was bad. I brought up that I didn't want to be &quot;another Dex&quot; and either he was avoiding the answer or really didn't get it he said I couldn't be like Dex. He actually said that when he found out that Dex and Paul were still fucking he told her he wasn't going to have sex with her anymore and that he hasn't been with anyone since we went to Gainesville. Not sure whether or not to believe him. I really didn't want to sleep with him, I wanted to wait.

 Because I threw my pants in the washer and I was drunk, I forgot that my phone was in my pants. So now I'm waiting for AT&amp;T to send me my new phone, but it most likely won't get here till sometime next week since my sister only ordered it yesterday. Being disconnected from people really irritates me and makes me paranoid. Since that Sunday Franco and I have been acting as if it hasn't happened. We do mention it vaguely and he paid for a Plan B pill (since we were irresponsible and I'm not taking birth control) but that was it. When I said I didn't want it to be awkward I can't help but think I'm making it awkward. Also, now I want to sleep with him again just to give him a different impression: that I'm better sober.

I've got abandonment issues. Serious abandonment issues. Laura is up here and Hunter's really happy, especially since any minute he'll get a phone call saying his Paw-paw died. I know he needs her (and needs to get laid) but it bothers me not being able to talk to him anytime. He's been in his room all day with her and I've only seen them once when I went to get soda crackers for my nausea. They left at about 11pm without saying a word to me and it's now 12:15. There is my abandonment issue! I hate not being included! I hate not knowing where they are! I hate being left behind! Last week Hunter did this too. I was taking a shower cause we were supposed to hang out with Franco and he grabbed some stuff to clean Franco's apartment and said he'd be right back to get me. That was early in the night and I got dressed and was ready to go. He later sent me a text at 2:30 in the morning asking me if I was still awake. I didn't answer pretending that I wasn't.

This makes me really sad. I do feel abandoned. Half of me wants to pretend to sleep when they get back: for Hunter and for Franco. I hate having to rely on Hunter, who in the past few days I've noticed isn't that great for my self-esteem. And Franco? Well I'm tired of being me. I know you should be yourself but I don't want to be that girl anymore. I wanna be the girl that guys go after. The girl who kind of ignores you and makes you want her more. I've never been good at playing hard to get, but I feel like I should learn. I think I might wait till 1am, after that I'm pretty sure I might cry myself to sleep. Heck I'm trying not to do it now. I just need to wait out for another 35 minutes."

"event","So since my roommate Hunter made friends with Franco, he's been trying to get us together. He kind of acts like my pimp which is funny sometimes and other times annoying. I know if someone was bothering me (like they did at a party we went to) even drunk and fighting with me he'd hold them off. I appreciate his support in trying to get me laid, which I had needed, but not anymore. So Franco is a physics or psychology major (not really sure) and he's pretty cute and...different. We've indulged in friendly flirting but they've never lead to anything, which I appreciated. The weekend before finals a friend of his from Gainesville came down. Now this girl is apparently his fuck buddy, his friend-with-benefits. All his friends are in Gainesville and they all live very neatly close together. So when Hunter and I pick up Franco and his special friend, Dex, I introduce myself even though I met her in September for Franco's birthday, but I didn't think she remembered.<br /><br />She said, &quot;I know, I remember you.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Oh? I didn't think you would it was so long ago.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Yes, I remember. That and Franco talks about you all the time.&quot;<br /><br /><p>0_o Oh really? So that Sunday we went off to Gainesville and Hunter and I stayed at Franco's friend's house while Franco slept at Dex's house (of course). Hanging out with them that night and the rest of Monday I just really didn't like Dex. I was friendly and all, like I usually am, but I got this feeling from her (I think we've discussed the feelings I get from meeting people) that I just didn't like. I've heard that Franco has made it known that he doesn't want a relationship with her, but Dex is bent on making him her boyfriend. I think she's an attention whore who gets mad and storms out if Franco isn't paying her the proper amount of attention. I think she's also the kind of person who'd manipulate people in order to have her way. Now of course I also think people like this have some kind of abandonment or self-conscious issues, but people like that aren't people you wanna trust. They tend to be envious of others and would do anything to sabotage others happiness in order to eliminate the object of envy.<br /><br />So the fact that Franco was with her really turned me off. Not only that he was with someone (even though they're not together) but just with <em>her</em><em>&nbsp;</em>made me...disgusted. I've talked to Ek about this and she says it's not right that Franco would treat someone like that and that Dex would allow herself to be treated in that manner. I don't really know what to think about that because that's exactly what I did with Danny. Although we weren't exclusive, our little rendezvous would be rather pleasant and we would each respect the other. A lot of people don't know that Danny was more than just a fuck to me, and perhaps Franco has his own reasons for being involved with Dex.<br /><br />The point of this entry was to write about the events of last night. Last night I got an invitation to go out with a dude I call Fonzie. So I get the feeling that Fonzie has a thing for me (but when I say it out loud I feel like I'm being conceited), I didn't want to lead him on but I thought this was a great opportunity to expand my very tiny social life, especially since Hunter would be staying home. It would be one of the very few times I was out without Hunter, and the first time I hung out with his friends alone. Not that they're not my friends but they're more like acquaintances to me (a friend of a friend really). So after I said yes, Franco decided to join us. We went to this place called The Engine Room, which I thought was going to be a lounge with a band and a bar. &quot;Indie scene&quot; he said. So I put on some jeans over my sweats, sneakers, long sleeved shirt over my tank, and the most indie jacket I could find along with my scully and glasses. When we get there I find out it's actually a club. Not appropriately dressed and way too hot! It was kind of awkward in the beginning since I don't really hang out with either of them alone, but after a while (and a layer of clothing removed) we started dancing and was actually having a good time. After the Engine Room we went to another guy's house who apparently had drinks. I was a little nervous since the last time I was around these two gentlemen they were drunk and trying to touch me (not anywhere inappropriately, but enough to make me uncomfortable). I told Franco I'd be okay as long as nobody touched me, and he assured me he'd be the only one to touch me (again with the flirting). There were a couple more people there and a few of them left to go eat. The final crew consisted of just guys, me being the only girl. We had a couple of drinks (4 shots of whiskey for me) and I stayed in the kitchen holding on to Franco since I was stumbling a little. <br /><br />After getting home I sent Franco a message saying I had a good time and was glad he was there to hold me up.<br /><br />He replied: Well it was fun. All the butt grabbing was a perk too. I was a bit too assuming with asking you over though, sorry about that.<br />Me: What are you talking about? Asking me over?<br />Franco: Yeah I thought I asked you to sleep over.<br />Me: Oh? I didn't hear you, or notice. Next time grab my face and tell me or ask me before I start taking shots.<br />Franco: There is always tomorrow.<br /><br />So I'm not sure how to feel about this. I'm not sure I'm ready for it, then again it's been 4 months since Michael and I broke up, even though I saw him recently, maybe I should move forward so that I don't move back to him. I'll see what happens tonight when Hunter picks me up later. All I know is that reflecting back on all that's happened before concerning my love life, I must act (<em>no matter what</em>) with&nbsp;<u>dignity</u> and <u>grace!</u> I'm nothing if I don't have my dignity.</p>"

"event","There comes a time after a relationship ends (or even before) when you realize that your partner isn't right for you. Then there comes a time when you're glad they're not right for you. Or something similar. I just came back from Michael's house and the time alone should say something. I arrived back home at 11:30, all the while thinking &quot;This is the last time. The last time!&quot; I don't know if I love him still, but I do care about him a lot and his family. Everything is fine and we have our little rendezvous a little earlier than usual, the night was still young. I started looking at all the Christmas pictures in the living room and then I joined him in the family room to finish watching a movie. After the movie he went to his room to play x-box. About a half hour later I realize he's not coming back, maybe he's waiting for me? So I show up and he's still playing, looking for stuff, barely acknowledging me. So I go back to watch TV with his sister. Another half hour later and I decide it's time to go. I'm so pissed at this time. I go to say good-bye and for the first time he's okay with it. He usually says &quot;You have to go?&quot; &quot;Why?&quot; &quot;You suck [that you have to go].&quot; This time, &quot;Ok, I'll walk you out.&quot; I'm just so mad and so angry that I want this to be the last time I see him. Maybe that's why I don't want to come back to Miami. Maybe it's not only not to put up with my family, maybe it's to not be tempted to see him. But this time he hasn't shown me anything to be tempted with. The old man told me I was going to meet someone new in the new year, it won't be for a relationship but so that I won't be alone. I'll take it. Maybe the person that thinks about me is Franco not Michael. I don't think about Franco that way though, but I'll just be more careful about what I do now."

"event","I remember thinking last year that I hope no one dies in 2009. I've had horrible luck lately concerning the life of my family. I've had four family members die in the past five years, last year including my father. We still have another 50 minutes until the new year and I don't think I can bear it psychologically if someone else were to die.
I also can't help but think that a lot of people have died this year. There's been a number of kidnappings and celebrity deaths and my best guy friend just told me he's spending his New Year's Eve in Alabama with his grandparents because his grandfather is in the hospital with a fractured skull and a broken jaw (among a number of mental illnesses which include Parkinson). I know it's silly but I can't help but think that God answered by prayer by taking other people's family instead of mine. Now anybody who knows me knows I'm not religious but I do believe everything happens for a reason and that god makes that happen. 

So for the last 45 minutes remaining in 2009 I hope that everyone stays safe and happy, at least for the stake of my mental health."

"event","The old man told me I talk too much. That I'm too willing to give out information to friends and that that will hurt me. That I need to shut my mouth and be careful about what I tell and to whom. Yesterday I went to the movies with my cousin Rebecca (Andrew bailed on us). I thought it would be weird or awkward since I don't really talk to her or see her. In fact, I don't think I've ever really talked to her before. I try to not say too much but sometimes I can't help it. I do try to be careful though but it's hard playing this political game with the Chavarrias. It's like war: I don't know who to trust. So I told her a few things that the old man told me, how Roger and I broke up, and how Michael and I broke up. She told me about how she broke up with one of her boyfriends and how she was going to break up with her current one. Then we watched Avatar, which was amazing. It was something I didn't expect, like a newer 21st century Pocahontas. I'd definitely buy it when it comes out. Then we sneaked into Sherlock Holmes and that was disappointing. It was not the Sherlock Holmes I was expecting. They talked to fast, camera moved too fast, and too much action and not enough mystery. I'd have to watch it again, this time iwth english subtitles and not spanish ones."

"event","I hung out with my cousin Andrew a couple days ago. It was the first time since I've been home that I went out. We hung out with his friends and I babysat while they got drunk and high. I don't really like that but he said he would be driving around and the thought of him driving while boozed up scared me. I figured being there at least one day would be the day they had a sober driver and maybe not get into an accident, or worse.

Well today I finally hung out with my friends: Maria Carla, Daidee, Gabi, and Lizzie. We went to the beach and tanned in the sun, although it was pretty chilly out and I didn't get much of a tan. We started scoping for guys and a bunch of them came and sat right in front of us. They even started trying to show off for us. Maria Carla has a boyfriend but she was still having fun with it. As they left they came to talk to us for a little bit and we exchanged Maria Carla's number and two of theirs. As we left we started texting them and flirting with them. Only one of them was pretty cool to talk to but Daidee got claims to him, the other one was no fun and just wanted nudie pics. Yeah right, we might be teases but we're not skanks. We ate, walked, window-shopped, and even popped into the Pleasure Emporium. 

It's so much fun talking to those girls. I laughed so hard my stomach got cramps. I don't even remember the last time I laughed so hard. I'm going to try to make it a point to see more friends while I'm still here."

"event","Since 78 weeks ago life has been pretty good. No, not really, but I'm not obsessing over stupid little boys anymore. I knew I was being stupid then and I knew why but I guess heartbreak is just something every body's gotta be stupid at at least once. Since then life has been crappy but I make the most of it and try not to complain. My dad passed away and then came the real pain. After the drama that followed my dad's death I KNOW I need to go to therapy. It's only been a year and I'm not sure if I'm still depressed. When I WAS depressed I didn't know it I just look back on it as that. I need to start writing about my family. I know one day I can get their story published and bank in the royalties for my great grandchildren to live off of. Everyone is crazy. c.r.a.z.y. Literally crazy and maybe I shouldn't exploit them but seriously they belong on Oprah, 20/20, and Lifetime. But the more I learn about them the more I'm grateful for my mom and my sister and the relationship we have with each other. We might fight and bicker from time to time but our problems are minimal compared to my extended family. What do we have to be worried about? My sister looking for a new place to live cause they're evicting her? My mom getting her clinic appointments for her diabetes, fibromyalgia, and ovarian fibroma before going to Nicaragua? Me playing nice with my stepmother so she'll continue paying for my apartment and food and utilities in Tallahassee, all the while trying to get her to stop trying to convince me to move back to Miami while she lies to us about her secret trips to New York, oh I'm sorry, &quot;Orlando&quot;? Trying to not only pass my classes but raise my GPA from a 2.1 to a 2.75 (at least) so I can get my scholarship back while fighting through &quot;depression&quot;? No I don't have that many problems, but I still think I need to see a therapist.

The thing with us is that we have solutions to our problems, thankfully. Take my Tia Marta Ligia for example, she has all the money in the world (or at least what her husband makes), has a son who's inconsiderate of her and a relationship with her daughters that's irreparable. She's afraid to make her husband unhappy. Afraid. A wife shouldn't be WANT to make her husband unhappy, but shouldn't be AFRAID to. She's even made her mother afraid to make either of them unhappy. And then my COUSIN Martha told us a story yesterday at Chili's that's going to be the last chapter of my book...no, chronicles. But until everything is over and all the legal matters taken care of I can't speak a word of it to anyone. Or perhaps even publish it until they're dead."

"event","<b><font color=""#ff9900"">I was reading my old entries and I thought to myself ''Man I was such a happy kid!''. I can't believe how much I've changed in the past three years. I sort of wish I was the same. I was a lot happier, never had nearly as much drama as I do today. I think I was funnier too. The only thing that really annoyed me was my punctuation and my lack of capitalization. At least my spelling wasn't as atrocious as I thought I'd be. Actually my word choice was pretty good too. Gosh I can't believe I'm analyzing my own scrap work like this! I'm such an AP nerd. Well I'm not sure exactly how many people still log into livejournal but I doubt anyone would read my crap.<br /><br />I think I might just make this thing private. I don't know. I think I secretly want people to know my misery and empathize with me. But that's all; I don't want ''OMG Ivette, I didn't know! I'm sorry! Cheer up! I'm here for you!"" I know my friends have good intentions and surely they're tired of hearing me complain and I'm sure that's as much bull shit for them as it is for me. I'm not asking for any comments or advise in any more of my entries (as it seems I might be doing this more often) I think I just need a place to vent. Besides, I've already heard all kinds of advise and thought of them myself before they were even given to me. I'm a smart girl, I know what I SHOULD be doing. How I SHOULD feel. But I'm human. I can't help but feel the way I do. I want to be that funny, bubbly, strange and outrageously random girl I was three years ago. Well four, because those were the early years of highschool when I still had my middleschool personality.<br /><br />Highschool sucks. It really does. It's brought me nothing but drama that I never imagined I'd have in my lifetime. It's because of the people I hung out with though. I'm not trying to blame anyone. I blame myself that I didn't get away when I had the chance. I blame myself for being dependent and too scared to connect with people on my level. That's right, I won't hide it. I could have done better. WAY better! But- yes there is a big BUT- if I had become friends with the people I was supposed to, if I had stayed away from the people who caused me so much hurt, would I have ever met Roger? Well maybe not meet, since I met him freshman year, but we weren't close enough to stay in touch. Would we have become friends? Lovers? As much as I was hurt with him leaving me, as much as I cried then and as much as I still do, as much as I hate him now, I can't ever regret him. I wish I could stop. In fact, I'm still waiting for a day when I can stop thinking about him. I love him too much. Our time together was so fantastic I don't think I was ever happier. It just makes it that much harder to let go.<br /><br />Yeah highschool sucks. And my life, as Mitzi knows, is a novella- a soap opera. I have a new badass boyfriend, in love with my old one, and a great guy whom I'm attracted to with the feeling reciprocated.<br /><br />My new guy, Danny (ironically my sister's and best friend's ex's name- not the same person) is a loser. I'm not ashamed to say it. I'm very blunt I've noticed. He's a pothead (not my type), scrawny (not my type), who listens to reggae all day and was arrested for graph and allegedly possession (not my type). Allegedly. I believe him. He's an honest guy, really. I went to him in a time of need really. I was just dumped a few months before, heartbroken, and I had just found out that I was being used as a rebound for the one guy I was really starting to like again (well not AGAIN but moving on with). I was down and insecure and needed to feel pretty again. So here comes this cute (at least he's cute) guy with blond hair and green eyes (he's irish/peruvian) CLEARLY putting the moves on me. NO PROBLEMO! He was just what I needed. I didn't think much of our relationship- sad I know- but it became routine to see him almost every weekend. He's a horrible boyfriend, he told me so the first time we slept together. I accepted it. I didn't want a boyfriend, I was making sure he didn't think he was.<br /><br />Meanwhile, at school I've got this great friend Michael. He's real nice, random, real cute...okay he's hot! Last name McKinley. Talk about WHITE! But really white/cuban. He's got real dirty blond hair and blue eyes (I like). In JROTC so he's muscular ( I like). We're good friends, hanging out at lunch all the time, real friendly with each other even while I was with Roger. I really respected the fact that he tried to wait a while after Roger and I broke up to start being more friendly with me. We were getting closer, seeing each other between classes briefly. Lots of hugging. Holding hands began at GradNight. We spent the whole time all over each other. No kissing though. We basically acted like a couple with the exception of actually going OUT, calling, and moving to first base. He's really weird sometimes though, even I can't keep up. I know we share the same interests but most of the time when we're really by ourselves (and not surrounded by entertaining friends) there's an awkward silence between us. I hate awkward silence. We went to prom together and I had a good time dancing with all my other friends. He doesn't dance (no like). Party pooooper. Had a great little after party with three other friends though. Doesn't really count as a party but there was a pool involved. Finally we go on our first date after graduation and DUN DUN DUN, it's running EXACTLY AS MY FIRST DATE WITH ROGER! Movies, Popcorn (okay with Roger it was Nachos but still, I offered popcorn), Barely anyone in the audience, Top row to ourselves, me on the right side, him on the left side, me leaning on him, HIM KISSING MY CHEEK! With Roger that kissing on the cheek prompted me to turn my head slightly followed with a, ""What's wrong?"" ""Nothing"" ""Ok"" then another, turning of the head........ALLOW KISS! MAJOR UNCONTROLLABLE MAKEOUT SESSION IN PROGRESS. So, to avoid potential remake of pleasant-but-painful memories I gave a nice smile and turned my full attention back to Kung Fu Panda! Which was a good thing since it was a funny movie. The rest of the night was in semi-awkward silence until we got to his house. We were hugging, as we tend to do, heads very closely obvious to what was unavoidably going to happen. But we stayed like that for a long time. Me all confused, him all confused. Unsure and confused. It was awkward talking about it yet not talking about it at the same time. Finally he said, ""So, what would you do if I kissed you?"" which I dumbly replied with ""I don't know, kiss you back I guess."" And so we did. It was nice. He's a good kisser actually, not much tongue use though (I'm not used to being the dominate one, not really comfortable with it too much either) and he keeps his eyes open, I admit I peek sometimes but it was a first to open my eyes and catch him staring 0_0.<br /><br />I felt horrible because afterward I went straight to Danny's house. McKinley's a good guy, but so is Danny. I thought Danny was an idiot, totally not on the same level as me, but I was wrong. On the day that I went to his house one time, we talked for almost two hours, maybe a good hour and a half. That day I thought about how great it was to have communication like that (Not Available with McKinley). That was also the day that I learned he was smart. Don't get me wrong, McKinley's smart too, but Danny READS. I don't think I've ever met a guy who actually likes to READ, except for Albert but he used me as a rebound. Not only does he read, but he likes to read SMART books. Books that I've read in my AP classes. Some books that I don't even like! But it doesn't matter to me; what matters is that he reads them. I was so happy and so proud, he got lucky soon afterward. Hahaha! When we finished and I was getting dressed he placed a small black box on my lap. My graduation/going-away-to-college present. It was a tiny diamond necklace that squiggles from small diamonds to big ones to, according to commercial ""shows how your love has grown"". Now I know I'm not in love with him and he's not in love with me, but I'm beginning to think he likes me. Haha! Well I still have to ask him what exactly are we. He's mentioned me being his ""girl"" and him being my boyfriend before, but I don't think it's actually ever been set officially. I'll be sure to ask him next time.<br /><br />This is the problem I'm having here. Danny's a great guy. He's real nice to me, although not always a gentlemen. He curses at everyone he knows except for me (I told him since I don't curse at him he shouldn't be cursing at me either, I guess he took it to heart since he hasn't cursed at me ever since). He's smart, and although we don't seem to have much in common I feel comfortable around him and I can talk to him. Then there's McKinley, who's been my friend since sophomore year. He's a good guy, I know he'll take care of me. He's not into drugs, we have more things in common, we actually go out on dates (well one but still there should be more to come), he calls me to hang out, he calls me to see how I'm feeling (I'm currently sick). Danny never calls me, hasn't asked how I'm feeling. Although I like Danny more, and I know both boys have strong feelings for me (although Danny doesn't show it so much), I hope I'm not making the mistake of letting such an obviously great guy like Michael go. And my family likes Michael too! My mom told me the other day that if I was going out with a guy that had Danny's characteristics she'd be so ashamed! Now since I kissed Michael, I feel horrible telling him I'm currently unavailable, after all that we've been through. It feels as if I'm playing games with him. I don't want to be playing anyone. And not only Michael but Danny too. He doesn't deserve to be two-timed. I don't plan on telling him ""Hey, there's this guy I like better than you. Thanks for the expensive necklace though! We won't be having sex anymore. See ya!"" Or maybe I should pull a Roger, ""I don't want to have sex anymore. I'm afraid of getting pregnant"". Bastard. Well I've managed to hold off McKinley for a while with my illness, but that's almost over and done with. Even if a relationship were to start with him, I would never sleep with him. I know it seems I gave in easily with Danny, but I knew that would happen when I broke up with Roger. I knew I would sleep with someone in order to boost my self esteem and end my depression. But honestly, after Danny it's going to be a while before I have sex with another man. The next man I have sex with I'm going to be in a deep and meaningful relationship like I was with Roger. Slow, and with someone whom I'll really care about. It'll be hard, since I'm not sure how long it will take me to find someone whom I can trust like that again.<br /><br />So if there's anyone who actually read all of this miserable drama, don't give me some crappy advise that I could have given myself. Be real. Take into consideration the relationship with both men, and how they're going to end when I move to Tallahassee for college. Read. Analyze. Delve. ""Glean what afflicts me[sic]"" (Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead). Know that I'm still depressed from my last love (yes, six to seven months later) although now I'm not starving myself and crying myself to sleep EVERY night (I still do from time to time). I think I'll finally be over him when I can say to myself&nbsp; ""A year from now, we weren't together"" but that sounds even more depressing.<br /><br />Off to sleep I go! It's 3am, I promised myself I wouldn't go to bed so late. I need to pick up my sister's clothes and take my baby cousin/step sister to the movies by 2pm. Good night!</font></b>"

"event","it rained today! yay! i love it when it rains! i'm reading Farenhight 451 and it just reminds me of Clarisse who's just standing in the rain and trying to catch raindrops in her mouth. i did that. i wasn't sure if it was sanitary but i still did it. i've been very picky about things being sanitary lately. i think i'm starting to sound like C|D. Ek and i went to gainsville with my mum and aunts for my cousin's graduation. then we went to MGM studios. i had a blast! and like always, spilled some icecream on my shit. i swear if its not on me it's around me. i'm such a messy eater. Saturday while still at the hotel in gainsville we watched a black and white movie which we're still not sure the name if it. we think its called 'A Fine Romance' because that's all they kept singing about. 

""a fine romance!
without kisses,
without hinges""

and yes that's all we remember and, 

""pick yourself up!
dust yourself off!
Start all over again!""

Then at MGM they were giving trailers of classics and there was this other black and white movie called 'We're singing in the rain' or perhaps it was dancing. i'm not sure but that's the inspiration for today's title.

"event","Alright, i decided to help my mum out organizing her stuff so she could get to work in Real Estate in peace. While we were filing some papers she came across a bank notice from 1998. She then told me a ""Daddy story"". She said that when they were together they had a savings account in the bank with $3000. When they separated my dad spent all that money, took his name out of the account, and refused to pay it back. My mom, being the awesome person that she is, told the bank officer that her exhusband spent all the money and wouldn't pay. The court even told him to pay the money by a certain amount of time but he didn't and my mum didn't have the money to take him to court again. Soo...the bank officer asked my mum for my dad's office number to see if he can work it out. She told me that my dad said some atrocities at the bank officer and that he called her up telling her that he understood why she left him. my mum, my sister and i were lucky if we didn't have the water cut off and my mum would pay $25 a month. My dad was living with my aunt's exhusband. He got remarried to a woman who already had a kid. When my cousin moved in with her dad she kicked my dad and his new family out so they ended up living in a tiny apartment while their house was being made. My idiot of a father opened an account of (you guess it) $3000 in the same bank. When the bank officer saw my daddy's name on the account he just took the money and called my mum telling her that she didn't have to worry about paying the money off anymore. in total my mum only had to pay about $200. My father never said a word about it."

"event","Okay let me tell you a story about a girl who went to the post office for the very first time.

The Girl was sending a letter to her penpal friend in California. She had just written her first letter on a nice stationary hawaiian paper and left the door with her purse which contained her keys, her phone, the letter, and her wallet which contained $10. She left the house with her dog on the phone and got just a block away when her sister from Hawaii called her. it was 3:50 and the post office closed at 4 so she tried her best to hurry. Then the Girl remembered something important: She didn't have the address. Saddened that she would not get to the post office in time her sister offered to look for the address in her e-mail. relieved the Girl agreed and told her sister her password and instructions on where to find the e-mail that contained the address. However her sister brought up a serious problem, 
""Where are you gonna write it?""
This did present a problem for the Girl but she quickly came up with the solution to type it onto her phone. It took some time to write the whole address on her phone and when she hung up she found herself at the postoffice. She tied her dog to a Handicap sign and walked inside looking for where there was envelopes and stamps. She found a vending machine that held stamps and chose the cheapest one. she put in in her purse and began searching for envelopes. A not so nice lady there told her to ask the people in the next room. The Girl did so and asked a lady who was not attending someone where to find envelopes and the lady at the desk told her she would have to get in line and buy some. That was alright with the girl she did have $8.75 left. Hearing her dog outside whinning she began to worry. When she got to the desk she asked the 2nd lady for some envelopes. The lady said,
""Envelopes?""
""Yes just normal envelopes"" The Girl worried they didn't have anymore
""Why?""
""To send a letter?""
""Why?""
The Girl looked at the 2nd desk lady with a strange face and the lady said,
""Oh yeah, it's none of our business""
The Girl had to stop herself from saying 'yes it is none of your business'
The Girl asked for 10 envelopes because they were only .45 cents and she wouldn't have to buy some later. As soon as she got them her dog came running in to find her. The ladies started shouting that dogs were not allowed in there and so the girl went outside again with her dog. 
Outside so she wouldn't have to leave her dog alone the girl put her letter in the envelope and grabbed her stamps. however she then realized that they were postal stamps. a postcard with stamps built in. with a sigh the Girl went back and got normal stamps happy that they were only $2.30 because she only had $3 bills left. she went back to her dog and put the stamp on a new envelope since the one she had stuck in her mouth got all dirty with lipgloss and she did not want to send a dirty envelope to her new friend. However her friend was beginning to become troublesome when she went back inside to look for a pen only to find she had to back to the room and ask for one. One of the security ladies at the postoffice began to yell at her in spanish about her dog and how he was going to get loose and run into the street. The girl saw her dog get loose but run towards the post office once more but she got to him in time and went to his abandoned leash. The security lady again started to yell at her in spanish to carry the dog inside. The Girl did as she was told and asked where she could drop off her letter. One of the ladies inside told her to go drop it in a box outside and that the dog wasn't allowed in there. The Security lady suddenly became really nice and said she would take care of the Girls dog while she finished but the girl said she just needed to send it. The Security lady showed her what slot to drop it in in the first room and started to say nasty things about the other lady who told her the dog wasn't allowed inside. As the girl was leaving with her dog heading home all sweaty she realized that she had not put a returning address on the envelope.

The Girl called her mommy and told her what happened and her mommy assured her that they would send the letter only if the address was wrong they wouldn't send it back to me. The Girl let out a sigh of both relief and exhaustion hoping that the address was correct. She called her sister and told her the story and when she got home she gave her dog water and drank some juice and sat down on her computer and began to type away at her livejournal...

"event","My sister got home yesterday morning. I missed her so much! I finally got to see my niece too! She's so adorable. Well my Johnny Depp sleepover went from 6 to 1. Ek and C|D didn't want to come, Meli could either go to otakucon with me and meet Kirby or she could come to my sleepover and watch 3 or 4 johnny depp movies. Kirby. Movies. Kirby. Movies. Gee what a decision. Of course she choose to meet Kirby, (i'll talk about that later). So since Meli can't come Mily won't come. So it all came down to Jessica and Michelle. Then Jessica came and when we finally got to call Michelle she said she couldn't come because she had family trouble. Its kinda pathetic really but we had an awesome time. I changed Ansly's diaper today for the first time! Whoot! and she did a poopie too. Anyone who knows me knows how much i love this girl. i loved her since before she was born and im crazy about her. i just imagine how much i'd love my own kids. All 6 of them. XD"

"event","Ja so today i went shopping with my Tia Martha Ligia, its the rich one, she had promised to take me shopping fer my birthday and we went today. two months after my birthday. oh well, its always like this. i never once (okay maybe once) get presents ON my birthday. i always get them before or after. before from my mum, and after from everyone else. except fer this year i got a card and balloons in school and Ek and her family gave me awesome InuYasha presents. (I STILL LOVE YOU GUYS FOR THEM! THEY'RE AWESOME! I have my wall scroll on my closet door and even though i'm blind without my contacts or glasses i can still make out the characters every night and morning!) Well i remember my mum saying one day that i was expensive but i never really thought about it until now. My aunt bought me two outfits today: a simple light blue Tommy shirt with a pair of jeans (fergot which brand but i dun really look at brands), another pair of jeans that looked like it was attacked by a bottle of white out (its pretty cool really) with a matching jean jacket(not like the other big jacket that can hold 15 different guns...*silence* not that i know...), and a white button up J-Lo shirt with a pink lace at the bottom (OMG i bought something with a J-Lo brand and a pink lace! shoooot meeeeee *gets shot by Ek and other J-Lo haters* I'm sorry but i reeaallyy liked it! i mean its hard to find button up shirts that won't burst open at the bust!) ... yeah well i'm talking too much about that. 

Well i thought it was gonna be weird with my aunt since i dun usually go shopping with women 32 years older than me (i mean my mum is only 29 years older than me). so yeah i thought it was going to be awkward but it wasn't really. We didn't talk much but then when we left we went to go get chinese food (its funny cause my new favorite song right now is ""I like Chinese"" by Monty Python) and we started talking about my school and stuff (she interrupts me a lot...Ek shut it -_-). After dinner (i had dinner at a normal time Ek!) we went to the movies and of course Victor being the ass that he is kept on being one. He invited Shawn but i like Shawn, Shawn is cool, i think he thought it would bother me but no. and again while we were picking a movie my aunt suggested National Treasure but then Victor pops out saying he wants to see Alexander. He got this dissapointed look on his face when i said that i had been wanting to see it too. Well it turned out that Alexander was sold out and we went to go see National Treasure either way. It was awesome! it made me want to go treasure hunting. it also made me realize how important history was. Oh there was this one part in the movie (dun worrie i won't spoil it) where they think they're stuck somewhere and i come up with a solution, and the guy who doesn't really know anything comes up with it too. WHOOT I SOLVED THE MYSTERY IN THE MOVIE!...well no, not really...*cough cough* yeah...well then we came home and my mum picked me up and i showed my cloths to my mum and i got on the computer and i got on livejournal and i started typing about how my day was about going shopping with my aunt and that it was fer my birthday and  how i always get birthday presents lat-*gets shot*"

"event","Alright since it costs money to take the online course and mum wasn't there...yeah, i didn't take it. So yeah, i keep getting reminded of a certain conversation we had in Photo about a week ago. We were saying that wouldn't it be cool if instead of carrying notebooks, binders, and textbooks that we just carry a laptop. A laptop provided every year by the school for each student. There you have the textbooks uploaded. You know how like classes sometimes don't have enough textbooks for a class set and for us to take home? Well why isn't it just uploaded into the laptop. Like every teacher has a main computer where at the beggining of the year the textbook is uploaded. And if say a history book needs to be updated then its just updated by the author, given to the schools, and the schools upload it to the teachers computer and them to us. Also at the end of class, everyone connects their computer to the teachers and upload their homework. Of course paper and pencil shouldn't go extinct. We should still use them cause according to Ms.Krey: you learn things better when you write them down. But like homework and textbooks should definitely be on the student laptop. And on that laptop you should get yer grade for all your classes(like the Parent Viewer at Ponce). You've got to admit, there will be less killing of trees with that around. I mean what happens to the old textbooks huh? Why can't they just be updated instead of just thrown out? Well i think that's it. i dun remember what else was said but i guess thats the gist of it. Yeah... it was just an idea..."

OKAY NOW THAT THAT'S OVER WITH!

*phew* geeze its only 8:27 and i feel pooped. Pooped i tell you POOPED! i guess its mostly because i went to bed at 2:30am and then i got up at 6:20am (but not before shutting off my alarm clock at 5:15, and 5:30). I'm so glad that science projects were due today. seriously i'm gonna die of stress one day! I was so nervous cause Mr.Ware said that we were gonna present and since i have him after lunch i sat at my desk and all of a sudden i got a stomach ache. It wasn't that bad but i swear if he called on me i was going to throw up. Well i didn't have to worry about it that much since my paper was in the middle of the pile. either way i still felt sick. i've been feeling sick since yesterday. i mean i didn't even have dinner. During the day i ordered a pizza cause theres absolutely NO food in this godfosaken house! (oops sorry i mustn't use god's name in vain. God is a pretty good guy...or chick!). Well after the first slice i really couldn't eat anymore of it. simply the site made me want to barf. and this was at around 1 or 2 and i didn't eat for the rest of the day. and on wednesday too all i ate was buttered toast and some cafe con leche (how do you say that in english?). And today? Today i ate a slice of pound cake...

Yeah i kinda doubt that you guys would want to know about what i eat for dinner everyday. but yeah thats all thats intresting today. like i said i'm POOPED so i think i'm gonna go to bed early today too. tomorrow i'm going to take the online course for my drivers licence. Oh.Yeah.*does her up and down finger movements* Awesome then.

I MUST DEPART! byz!

"event","<lj-cut text=""Mild moans"">I&#39;m struggling with a couple of things as well as the usual pre-Christmas chores.&nbsp; One is Christmas cards. In previous years thanks to MrFan&#39;s employment for many years in a bank we have moved a lot and have made good friends in many places; then there are the close relatives and the not so close genealogical acquaintances; a declining number of old school friends and so it goes on.&nbsp; I have weeded out the people who once per year used to send a card with nothing more than to and from with a printed message and nothing else at all. What is the point? I finally managed a shortened 2 pages summary of activities and because of lack of techno skills used the same Christmas tree icon that I used last year but I still feel very inferior when I receive newsletters with clever lettering and lots of photos. Hopefully I paint pictures with my words!&nbsp; The price of postage in NZ has risen again and I&#39;m sure that has made a difference. So far I&#39;ve not received many cards so today I decided when we went to the Post Office to clear the mail that if there were not at least 6 cards in the box That Was It.&nbsp; I&#39;d stop writing and posting cards and from henceforth only send cards to people who&#39;ve sent them to me.&nbsp; I&#39;ve always had a hesitant feeling if I&#39;m early sending thinking that perhaps the cards arrive and the recipients think Oh No I&#39;d wanted to cross her off for a long time. So, although I have done the important ones I&#39;m happy just to sit back and if any arrive I don&#39;t mind simply sending a response and apologize for lateness.&nbsp; The ones I have sent, especially overseas are going to be late anyway.

The other thing that is causing me stress just now is the Bookcrossing 666 Challenge.&nbsp; Read 6 books from 6 different countries on 6 different continents. 36 books, only a portion of the number I read in a year. Sounded very easy 11 months ago but I&#39;ve left my run a bit late and at this moment I am about 8 short with the days running out.&nbsp; Finding books from some areas is quite difficult in this small far away place so I decided first that I&#39;d read through the titles from the difficult continents of the books already read by others and recorded on the appropriate BC Forum thread. Went merrily along to the local library armed with a list of 15 titles to consult their catalogue.&nbsp; Novels from unfamiliar areas were not apparent in the library catalogue while the non-fiction books did show up but usually in the form of reviews in scientific journals and similar places.&nbsp; Eventually I decided to enlist the help of one of the librarians and she proved to be a real treasure.&nbsp; I left my list with her as she asked for a little time and later in the day she sent an email with a number of suggestions and a promise to let me have more ideas later.&nbsp; Meanwhile she directed me to the Teen Section where there were a number of books by Graeme Lay, a NZer who writes for the teen market and had several books based in the Cook Islands that could fill a space on the Oceania list and one of which I&#39;ve now read quite quickly and enjoyed.&nbsp; Already I&#39;ve located a John Le Carre on MrFan&#39;s bookshelves and found Barbara Kingsolver&#39;s Lacuna on my own shelf - I&#39;d found it very hard to get into and abandoned it.&nbsp; Today I went to the library and picked up a couple more of the books she recommended so it isn&#39;t quite as gloomy as at the beginning of the week. There is light at the end of the tunnel.

Today I had an appointment with a &quot;Care Plus&quot; nurse from our local medical centre.&nbsp; This is a health initiative of our Government aimed at keeping people healthy and out of hospital. I&#39;m happy to report blood pressure just fine. Diabetes under good control and apart from rampant psoriasis nothing much wrong with me at the moment. Yeah!</lj-cut>"

Hopefully the malaise that affected me at the end of 2009 is virtually passed and life will be normal and full on once again. The psoriasis programme is exceedingly difficult to handle while away from home. I'll write about that separately.<br />.....MrFan and I are currently in Palmerston North supporting&nbsp;&nbsp; <lj user=""daughterfan""/>&nbsp;'s brood taking part in NZ's National Roller Sports Championships.&nbsp; It has been a very full-on week with&nbsp;many events each day, some of special interest involving our&nbsp; three grandchildren and some watching other national experts in their field competing and generally strutting their stuff. Can one strut on roller skates? Somehow I doubt it. <br />.....Our 15 yr old grandson GSM is new to the competitive part of speed skating and has had great success with about 7 bronze medals capped with a first in the artistic field with a Gold Medal in Dance Pairs, to the&nbsp;delight of his partner, her parents and his. His own as well I expect.&nbsp; GSG, now 13, is&nbsp;competing in higher grade this year against older skaters with more experience so although her marks, scored against a National Scale, are pleasing&nbsp;they were generally outside the&nbsp;medal range. She did receive about three medals I think but&nbsp;the aging memory is letting me down as I write this. GSW and his dance partner were not participating in competitive events but skating against National scores and were satisfied with their achievements. He was also&nbsp; in events that were new to him but in which he held his own.<br />.....This evening we will attend a closing Ceremony&nbsp;during which the names will be announced of whose&nbsp;who qualified for inclusion in Oceania Championships in July. That is awaited anxiously and hopefully.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been a&nbsp; strenuous if sedentary week sitting concentrating on events so we are both tired and will not wait until the end of the evening when younger fitter&nbsp;folk will take part in a disco.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Something we did while&nbsp;here was to farewell our&nbsp;PN grand-daughter who is leaving next weel for a year at school in Sweden.&nbsp; She plans to keep a web blog while she is away so we are&nbsp;keenly looking forward to&nbsp;that as it will be such a&nbsp;different experience for her. I doubt she has any comprehension of the&nbsp;change in temperatures.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We head back to Upper Hutt tomorrow trying to leave early to avoid the build up of traffic on the highways as holiday folk return to real life in the work place on Monday. I plan to remedy my lack of Christmas messages next week.<br />"

"event","&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <lj-cut text=""Slow and steady 2009 intro"">The first few days of this new year&nbsp;have been &nbsp;very low key indeed.&nbsp; &nbsp;Most of my time has been spent fiddling with scrapbooking the Christmas photos and rushing back and forth from Warehouse Stationery getting copies of photos so I can, when I have some spare time, make separate pages for each&nbsp; grandchild&nbsp; for their own albums. I have spent a lot of time reading Friends in Live Journal. What joy.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last couple of days I have put aside scrapbooking and finally started putting together the writing and photos for our trip during last year.&nbsp; My book club set me a challenge to have it completed by 26th January to bring for display at our January meeting. With the Word part of my PC being&nbsp; inaccessible it is taking longer than otherwise, partly because I have to manipulate the files through Jack's PC and then edit and arrange the words, but partly also because with only one PC between us I need to queue.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday I purchased a new suitcase which will hopefully be AOK for our trip to France and UK later.&nbsp; It is smaller than the large one I was given when I retired from work. I did choose that gift myself and it seemed to be really good but it is quite a bit larger than this new one and our son was always complaining about the size and weight of our baggage.&nbsp; I'm going to practice when we go to Christchurch tomorrow&nbsp;and see if I could manage with this new one&nbsp;&nbsp;for overseas if I take less clothes.&nbsp;&nbsp;I always take some things&nbsp;that get left in the case and never used.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today I finally collected my new glasses and they are obviously going to take a while to get used to but I must say that driving was a lot more comfortable with them. Not sure about the look. Hardly recognize myself.<br />I may not get a lot of LJ time while we were away although I'll take Gertrude with me so I don't need to explore our hosts' one. She served me so well during our holidays and doesn't deserve to lie unused all during the year. She'll appreciate the workout I'm sure.</lj-cut>"

"event","Safely ensconced in the Qantas Business Lounge after a late departure form Wellington.&nbsp;
S-i-l collected us&nbsp;at 3.30 and we were on the road by 3.36. despite a detour through Newtown because the Mt Vic tunnel was cloesed we were skirting the back of the airport by 4.06. Hardly any traffic on the road at all.&nbsp;&nbsp; Quick check in then we breakfasted on bananas and mandarins that we'd taken along with us.&nbsp; Waited until Whitcouls opened so we could get a ten week Lotto ticket which we'd forgotten to do the previous day.&nbsp; I'd been so keen to ensure that the mobile phone being couriered to Telecom in Upper Hutt had arrived and to collect it before the shops shut that&nbsp;Lotto had slipped from my mind.
All on board without mishap. Once we were all seated and almost leaving the Captain advised ft that there was fog in Sydney and rough weather so they would have to change their route which meant they would need to load more fuel!! Great!&nbsp;&nbsp; So we settled down, MrFan with a newspaper and me with a chilling gripping book.&nbsp; Then there was announcement that at they were loading fuel all electronic equipment should be turned off. AND that if there was need to evacuate the plane the staff would show us which way to go.&nbsp; Nothing like giving&nbsp;&nbsp;an air of cool and calm. NOT.&nbsp; We were 50 minutes late taking off but that didn't worry us as it would minimise the long wait in Sydney.&nbsp; As it turned out there was no turbulence and a smooth landing with no fog at all.&nbsp;
No problems with a kind man on the counter in the&nbsp;Qantas lounge agreeing to there being three of us in the lounge instead of the two that our single membership of the Qantas Club allows. GS L was delighted to find that Wifi would work for his Ipod; MrFan collected the daily paper and I still had the good book.

Some one asked about length of time away - it will be about 9 1/2 weeks because we had difficulty getting seats on&nbsp;&nbsp; a day we wanted.&nbsp;&nbsp; The legs from either Singapore or HK were very heavily booked.&nbsp; Don't know if that would be because of people travelling after the Olympics. 

Better have a look at the Duty Free shops.
LATER
Nothing that tempted except a new lipstick. Tried to get&nbsp; T-shirts for the French boys using L as an adviser without success. L is definitely not a shopper and we couldn't agree on anything so gave up on that. MrFan has sussed out a flashdrive that will allow for programmes as well as data &nbsp;files and has earmarked that for possible purchase in Singapore.
The afternoon is stretching out in a tedious fashion&nbsp; It is about half past 12 now and we depart at 3.25.&nbsp; L determined not to sleep so he ""can sleep when he gets home"" and back to normal time&nbsp;but there are a lot of hours to do yet.&nbsp; He did doze off on the previous flight."

Luckily the guarantees are transferable between branches so Lower Hutt store would be just fine.

It would be too tedious to detail the process of getting technical attention as there were several waiting periods.&nbsp; After about an hour cruising around the huge domestic store, with lots of tempting goodies, while Paul attended to the machine and after he'd tried a new CD in the CD drive, we emerged with a brand new updated DVD/CD reader writer at sale price for a mere $89 and no charge for the use of his technical expertise. 

It took quite a bit of fiddling about on My Beloved's part, in a small rather enclosed pace, plus a couple of calls back to the store to Paul&nbsp; before we were up and running again albeit without sound.&nbsp; A brief visit from GrandSon M this afternoon and everything is AOK once more. What a relief.&nbsp; It is distressing just how bereft one - well this one anyway - feels without instant access to the keyboard and wider world.

Is anyone reading this tempted by the new EEE PCs?&nbsp; Their lightness really appeals but the keyboard is very small."

"event","Recording this specially for MrFan's sister who has macular degeneration.
We saw goji berries in a health shop in Golders Green and just had to look them up.  Imagine the surprise with what I found.

Macular Degeneration by Ray Sahelian, M.D. natural health and beauty information

Age related macular degeneration is an eye disorder that can result in irreversible visual loss and is the commonest cause of blindness in the Western world. The retina is particularly susceptible to oxidation as its need for oxygen is large, it is exposed to high levels of light, and its membranes are rich in readily oxidized polyunsaturated fatty acids, particularly DHA found in fish oils. 
   Age-related macular degeneration appears to share several carbohydrate-related mechanisms and risk factors with diabetes-related diseases, including retinopathy and cardiovascular disease. This indicates that a healthy diet over a lifetime with good blood sugar control would reduce the risk of this eye condition.

Macular Degeneration treatment options, natural 
Macular degeneration is a condition in which there is progressive deterioration of the central area of the retina, resulting in gradual sight loss in the center of the field of vision.
     Macular degeneration treatment is still evolving  and advancing. Unfortunately little macular degeneration treatment research is focused on natural approaches.  Some basic nutritional treatments for macular degeneration are being overlooked. For instance macular degeneration vitamin therapy is rarely used by eye specialists. I have tried to gather as much information as I can regarding natural ways to treat or prevent macular degeneration.

Eyesight Rx 
Supports Healthy Vision
Physician Formulas
Developed by Ray Sahelian, M.D.

Unlike some vision products that provide nutrients and herbs for long term healthy vision support, and prevention of visual impairment, but don't seem to have much of an immediate effect on visual acuity, Eyesight Rx was formulated to provide a quick and noticeable eyesight improvement within hours. 

Reports from Eyesight Rx users indicate enhanced clarity of vision, colors being brighter, better focus, and overall improvement in close and distance vision. We've had reports of some people noticing this effect within 10 minutes, while most people notice improved eyesight within hours. Still others will realize their vision is sharper the next morning when they take their second dose."

Once we arrived in the big metropolis it was apparent that the evening's rush hour was starting and we had to battle through crowds to catch the Jubilee Line to Finchley Road Station and telephone cousin D who walked down to meet us and help wih hauling the big case.  My new little one was working really well. Didn't weigh too much and was easy to pull.

"event","Tuesday and Wednesday were fairly uneventful days but each time I was going to bed slightly later and feeling slightly less tired.  I didn't sleep so well on Wednesday and I think that is because my mind, rather than my brain, is starting to get into full working mode and I'm thinking of all sorts of things that have been neglected and which I should be getting on to.
Not least of those is the BCNZ 2007 Convention.  The liaison guy from the Wellington City Council phoned this morning and will be coming to visit next week.

The days run to a pattern; waking early, trying to stay asleep but getting up around 7, organising coffee and a bowl of muesli then going back to bed for a while, getting up, washing and dressing or having a bath, then a day of short bursts on the PC and lots of reading still.  Thoroughly enjoyed Thomas Harris's ""Hannibal"" which someone took to the BCUK UnCon for me. Enjoy isn't quite the right word but he surely is a great writer. ""Black Sunday"", another of his which was a bit too close to current events for me to feel comfortable with it.  ""Never Let Me Go"" which was extremely unusual and is now on its way back to Alectoness.  ""The Five People You Meet In Heaven"", unusual in a different way which I really enjoyed and have already sent off in an RABCK.  At the back of that book is an excerpt from ""Tuesdays WIth Morrie"" which read so well I had to buy one today.

That leads me right into today Thursday when we went out, the second time.  I really had to purchase a birthday card for one of the wee granddaughters in Australia whose birthday party is this weekend in Sydney and birthday during the following week.  We should be there but won't. Daughterfan is going over for a few days in a couple of weeks so presents can go with her and hopefully she'll take lots of photos.  As well as getting a card I did locate and buy ""Tuesdays With Morrie"" and hope it lives up to the intro.  Have you ever noticed how you can see a huge range of cards, birthdays or otherwise, and there is just never one that is quite right for either the person or the occasion?  There were some great cards with little attachments but with warning notices on the back about not letting them near under 5's so, although R is going to be 6 I am sure that little sister S who is just over 2 would be paying close attention and I can't risk that.

I had a long phone conversation with a family researcher from Gisborne whose family touches briefly with mine in earlier generations.  Came away from the phone really feeling pretty good and well on the way to recovery.  It is about 9.00 pm and I don't feel a bit tired.  Currently reading Patricia Cornwell's ""Hornets Nest"" which is definitely my sort of book.

From here on in I plan to mark my entries as 'Friends' rather 'Public'.  Didn't actually feel any difficulties arising from marking all the entries 'Public' while we've been travelling. Guess they served the purpose of letting those of our friends who wanted to watch what we were doing being able to read without joining I'd feel more comfortable with the 'Friends' category.  I think that our daughter is almost convinced that she'll sign up herself - I'll work on that during the weekend."

"event","I've always had trouble understanding technology and computers and now this little episode has me completely baffled.  I most definitely wrote an entry on the 24th and was totally surprised when Rars and CaffCaff both noticed that what actually appeared was identical to what I'd written on the 19th.  How could that happen?
The new entry I wrote on the 24th wasn't all that inspiring and I can't really remember much about it.  I was, though, hoping for comments because one of the things I sort of discussed was that I'm planning henceforward to mark the items 'Friends' instead of the 'Public' category I decided to use while travelling so my friends who weren't on LiveJournal and didn't really want to join could follow our holiday progress.  It was really to save me the trouble of manipulating notes to suit the recipient and therefore only having to write things once.  Being 'Public' didn't seem to have caused any great drama but I will feel more comfortable using 'friends'.  I've almost got daughterfan convinced to start her own journal.  All the wonderful support that everyone gave her while she was writing will probably sway her.  We'll talk about it over the weekend.

Tuesday and Wednesday were pretty similar days eating, reading, spending short periods on the PC trying to catch up with all my Friends and what they'd been doing.
Thursday I took my second trip out, going to a Mall in Johnsonville to purchase a birthday card for one of our Sydney granddaughters who will be 6 this coming week.  Felt really good to be out and about although I did find that trying to read book titles facing downwards on books stacked upright was really uncomfortable when I turned my head on the side.  Purchased, with help from the staff ""Tuesdays With Morrie"" my first purchase post accident.  I'd read an excerpt from that book at the back of ""The Five People you Meet in Heaven"" and was keen to read more of Mitch Albom."

"event","It was a fairly disrupted sleep but I did go back again after the usual 4.30 wake.  Slept until 7.15 although I was aware of the first planes out just after 6.00am.  MrFan went off at 8.20 to do a duty indexing Probates at Archives NZ, a regular task he does for  the NZ Genealogical Socy. 
I made breakfast, coffee and muesli, put a load of washing on then stayed in bed until 11am starting ""The TIme Travelers' Wife"".  Hung out the heavy parts of the washing resulting in the rain starting, and put all the smaller items on a rack inside above a heating outlet.  
DaughterFan was keen that we should have a look at an 'Open Home' just around the corner from their house. <lj-cut text=""irrelevant to recovery"">  This house first came to our attention about a year ago when DaughterFan's GP told her about his sideline of developing a group of 4 houses specially designed for elderly people with wide doorways, internal lifts and which would be just great for her parents.  We've kept a close watch over the months and finally one 2 storey house is completed. The new owners will move in next week and agreed to an 'open home' from 11 - 3 today; the other 3 houses will be almost identical but this one has some pretty weird modifications made by the new owners.
The Landagent handling the Open Home was taking great care to advise all the viewers not only that the new owners were inside the house during the viewing but also that they had requested a number of changes from the original plans.  He didn't actually say ""Be careful what comments you make"" but that was obviously what he meant.  He was ex-military and had worked with our daughter so we had no trouble getting details of the changes, none of which were appealing in my view. </lj-cut>
We are not actually considering changing houses, and apart from the attraction of the family living nearby we don't favour the idea of living in or near Upper Hutt which has very cold winters. DaughterFan and her husband both think we should down-size before we need to rather than be forced to when we have to. This house won't persuade us.  The best part of the viewing was that this was my first venture out of the house and I came back feeling quite OK and not at all tired. Even watched the All Black rugby match which is not something I'd normally do.
Telephoned Lizzie-P for an update on Wellington BookCrossers and was very disappointed to hear that she'd been to the last meet-up and no-one else turned up. Can see I'll have to recover quickly. She knew nothing about my accident and was very surprised.
9.20  The latest I've been to bed yet and I'm still feeling good."

Had a bath, slightly longer than the last although still nowhere near long enough.  Organised parcels of HostLists for Servas which had arrived while we were away. MrFan helped by purchasing wrapping material and then taking the parcels to the post.  Caught up a bit with LJ entries. SonM phoned suggesting they come down from PN over the weekend. His wife's handbag was left here when they came to meet me from the plane so she's been managing without creditcards or cash.  Maybe it was safer with her credit cards being here - keep her out of trouble!

Eventually, late afternoon (because the car was getting a new WOF during the morning), he took the body of the thing out to the original vendor  because there are strict rules about letting anyone else tamper with it.  No fault could be found.  He brought it home and re attached a million cables etc to find it working perfectly.
After a very tiring day doing little I'm too tired to do much entering just now but am pleased to report that I did get the hand-written diary right up to date during the day, read through some of the myriads of uninteresting mail which had accumulated during our absence.  Two BookCircle books were amid the other stuff. I finished jonothan kellerman's ""Twisted"" which was devilishly evil and so can start on one of these two new ones right away. Nice card from the Dunedin BookCrossers with a gloriously fullblown dark rose adoring the cover.  Feeling much less tired tonight than I was last night so must be improving.
I've caught up with some of the wonderful comments from all you dear friends and feel far from worthy of them.  I'll have to start working on earning those tributes.  How does one turn 'ordinary' into 'worthy' I wonder?"

It is obviously going to take a while to read through all the back logs of everyone's lives and I will take it slowly.  One beautiful feature which I'd not realised I'd been lucky with was being able to read throughout all the drama and trauma.  When a cousin of mine, who is a doctor, phoned last night and asked ""Are you able to read again yet?"" I was astonished to think that I'd never thought of any other way.

Hasn't daughterfan been tremendous?  Not only doing the updates but relaying the responses.  I telephoned our son in London at 5.30 yesterday morning our time, knowing that it wouldn't occur to him to call me at that sort of time.  He passed on a message from his wife to me to the effect that as I'd missed half the French holiday we should come back for Christmas!!

Later this morning I hope to do some reading and catching up. The only apparent on going disorder is fatigue and some of that will be due to ordinary jetlag I think.

One message that I was determined to pass on after the first few days in hospital was ""Get to know your body shape, especially those bits you can't see.""  I found it very distressing when feeling my head - which seemed very strange shaped - not to know what it felt like normally. What shape should it be? was it different? had bits moved?  Just knew I should tell you all to get to know your shape just in case your are also stupid on stairs.

Not sure how long I can sit here but just absolutely had to say one thousand thank you's to every one of my LJ friends.  Your comments, love and hugs relayed to me by daughterfan have just been so sustaining.

The Doc escort, from International SOS, has instructions to deliver me to hospital in Wellington although he doesn't have precise details about that part. His manifesto says - Akd to advise.  No idea what will happen.  The French medicos recommend another angiogram in three weeks' time and I think they expect that I'll be kept in hospital until then.  All the signs were good from the scan the day before I left Brest so NZ medicos may like to treat me as an outpatient.  I'm very tired after all this travel. It is currently 10 to 8 am Aussie time Sunday am; we left Brest 6 pm French time Friday. I can't possible do that computation but am sure someone can. Flight leaves here at 9.30 As time and arrives 2.30 Kiwi time. Even if they tie me down in some hospital in Wgtn someone will be able to print things out for me.

Thanks everyone who has been so sustaining; special thanks to our daughter who has been fantastic.  Truly hope to reunite with my beloved life line soon.

She arrives in Sydney early morning on Sunday and is due back in Wgtn in the afternoon.

She is more mobile than previously, but is taking a new drug which seems to have slowed rather than enhanced progress.  She is able to walk with help, though currently is struggling it as she is feeling unwell. She hopes this is a side effect of the drug which is some sort of anti-convulsant. 

The language barrier continues to be a problem, though there do seem to be a few English speaking people on shift at times.

She is to have another scan later in the week, and hopes to be able to return home after that.  Her move and when it occurs is entirely in the hands of the medical professionals and the insurance coy.

Aside from that, she is a lot chirpier than previously, and Dad is doing well at the hostel which is set up specifically for hospital visitors.  FansonK has returned to Paris, and will be returning at the end of the week hopefully with the luggage left behind in London.  This will be a big relief to Holmesfan as it includes all her warm clothes and Dad's drug suppies.

She is now at the mercy of the insurance coy and medical experts as to whether she is medi-vac'd back to NZ.  There is definitely a ""lesion"" in her brain, which is probably the result of the fall, and this needs to be rescanned in three weeks, therefore there is a possibility she might have to spend another three weeks in hospital in NZ.  This is being thrashed out at present.

She has been able to get out of bed and has sat in a chair for a while, so will be happy about that.  Hopefully she'd be moving around today, which should help the bumps and bruises from her fall.

Holmesfan had a serious fall down a narrow wooden staircase at the house in Ploumenach on Friday/Saturday night.  She is now in a hospital in Brest, Brittany and will probably be there until at least next Monday when she is due to have an angiogram.

She has burst a blood vessel in her brain and has significant bruising.  She is currently unable to get out of bed as she is very dizzy.  I spoke to her this evening and while sounding very stressed and frustrated she is a little more comfortable now she has access to a telephone and a little more information than to date.

At this stage it appears she either has a ""contusion"" or an aneyurism and she has been advised to stay calm until such time as the scan has been completed. Those readers that know her well will realise this is a tall order. 

She has asked me to update this journal so that her closer contacts will know that she may be out of action for sometime.  I will be checking comments if anyone wants an update or contact details."

"event","The house at Ploumanac'h that our son's family has rented for 4 weeks in the last 5 French summer holidays is owned by a deceased man's granddaughter and leased regularly. The front is a single storey constructed mainly of the obligatory Breton granite; at the back, making an L- shape, is a two storey addition; the house will sleep 9 or even 10 at a pinch. There is a long living/dining area in the front portion with windows that are generally open to face glorious views from the base of a basin-shaped harbour filled with craft, all shapes and sizes. The house is very well appointed, and let furnished with an unbelievable array of kitchen utensils for cooking French style. It has good modern showers on both levels, washing machine and dishwasher and comfortable beds.
Visitors could spend all their time there doing nothing for all except sit at the open windows  and watch the changing scene and feel they'd had a wonderful holiday - of course there are lots of other things to do for the more energetic including cycling, horse-riding, fishing, boating, skin-diving etc etc and the best of all, reading. The bay is surrounded by classic ""white houses in Brittany"" the largest of which, actually a hotel I think, is floodlit at night.
One of the things that appeals most to us Kiwis is the huge tidal fall that empties and fills the harbour twice a day: low tide has almost no water at all except for a channel in the centre for the larger craft; the ground, more mud than sand, has all the smaller craft lying beached on their sides in the mud; full tide the whole basin-like area is full of glistening water - magical view.   Watching the tidal changes has a continual fascination:

13 -- 15 July this year Plumanac'h has a Maritime Festival and the scene that greeted us was full of colour, sound and movement. Balloon-type kites filled the sky at one end of the harbour; an enormous fluoro-pink octopus with eight ten-foot tentacles, an irridescant blue-green fish of indeterminate classification with a smaller version of the same species attached as a tail; a black and white orca and an unlikly blue crocodile were having difficulty gaining levitation while above these large balloons were four box type regular kites with unusual horizontal streamers attached to their tails.

Tethered to one side were two sinister rubber puffer fish, black with colourful spines, that were treated by small children as overhead versions of a ""bouncy castle"".  Sometimes wee tots were totally enveloped by soft rubber and emerged shrieking with combined horror ang glee.  Even 11-year old  Loic partook of this unusual opportunity. Meanwhile, from the collection of temporary kiosks lining the closed road around the harbour, competing celtic music echoed across the sparkling water.

Once the cars were unpacked K & J took off for the Super-U to fill the cupboards while the boys squabbled and MrFan and I drank in the scene. K & J returned and the well-established culinary practices commenced with apertifs: muscardet for J and gin for we three Kiwis. These were accompanied by crevettes (shrimps) for MrFan and our d-i-l, both of whom are seafood crazy, and ersatz crabsticks and mayonaise for Fanson K and me.  

The boys had ravioli in tomato sauce for dinner followed by little pottles of flavoured yoghurt.  To my intense delight we adults had confit du canard which is my truly most loved French food and which d-i-l usually has about once a week when we are with her.

Once more truly sated we sipped wine and sat by the open windows listening to music, watching darkness finally arrive around 10.30.  Around midnight one of the neighbours had a short burst of very loud fireworks.  Dancing and music went on until the wee small hours around the harbour edge but we were sleeping."

"event","S & M had an important ""Family Day"" at their church - what my Mother used to call ""All day with God - bring lunch"". Their  daughter Jessica drove us into Hereford city centre, led us on a short walk pointing out areas of interest then left to ""hang out"" with her current beau, giving us her mobile number so we could call for collection when we'd tired. We were right beside the Hereford Cathedral so decided to start there. What a superb place. The Cathedral is home to two of Britain's most historical treasures - their words rather than mine - but we were quite blown away when we explored the Medieval Mappa Mundi and the Chained Library. Both those items were new to us and once we questioned one of the attendants about them we just knew that we'd indeed come across treasures. We spent nearly two hours there sustained by a snack in the cafeteria. Next thing we explored was something known as ""The Old House"". After a rather difficult search for a supermarket to collect some wine to contribute to the evening meal we called Jess and she dropped us back to their house.
After a hurried meal we settled down with great expectations to watch the World Cup final. We wanted
France to win and Zidane to be superb! What a deplorable awful way for such a great man to end his career. 
Reasons but not excuses filled the media after the event.

I don't believe that Italy had played well enough to win the Cup but they have it. I'll continue to feel most strongly that penalty shoot outs are not a sporting way to end such an important contest."

"event","Stephen and Margaret kindly agreed to take us to Bath, a two-hour drive. Set off about 9.20, a bit later than planned.
Started off through an area that was previously noted for hop growing but only a few fields are left now. We only saw one in which the hop poles are visible from the road and that was on the way back. (Actually we saw several quite large fields from the train when we were returning to London but that's another story).
Through a quaint little town, Ledbury, then on the M50 heading for the M5. Steve's car is a Nissan with surprisingly comfortable backseats and a good view through the front window thanks to widely spaced front seats. He is a good driver and we felt quite safe on the trip with no qualms or momentary scares.

We skirted beside the Malvern Hills which protect Hereford from any cold Easterly winds as they blow across from Russia. Heading towards the M5 we passed ""Slimbridge"" of Peter Scott fame towards the A38 (dir Bristol). The threatened rain started but never became seriously troublesome. Along the A 4135 over the M5 through Dursley where the road signs were less than helpful we became slightly lost and had to get directions from a local with a very heavy dialect.  Dursley was another picturesque village with ancient buildings and a market place that is still in operation today. The road out from Dursley was uphill and very attractive with tall trees along the roadside arching over the road as we drove through leafy green tunnels. Stone fences along the side of the road. [Note Look up Dursley pancake races, a historic feature]
A46, dir Bath, through Old Sodbury; over A4, then on M5.

Arriving in Bath we took a long time to find anywhere to park. Just as we drove into an underground park I received a phone call from Mary W. which cut off as we went further underground and the signal disappeared. I phoned back as soon as we were out in the open and found that MrFan's reli, Dougal, from Perth was visiting M & D at Finchley road and they'd intended to drive across to see us that afternoon. D decided that Bath was a bit far away so we'll hope to catch up with him in our brief return to London.

We spent about two hours in the Roman Baths which were even more amazing than either of us expected. A hand-held audio device explained the various features, rooms, baths, relics etc. An option was short commentaries in some areas spoken by Bill Bryson which added an extra filip to the experience. In a few places there were walls that looked just exactly as our son had them in his ""BathHouse"" restaurant decor. That was a strange feeling.

Steve had a dicey hip so did not accompany us but waited patiently on a seat in the square outside where various itinerant performers kept him entertained in between short dozes. There were crowds of tourists from all sorts of countries. Purchased a fridge magnet and a book and took lots of photos. After lunch at one of the Costas coffee shop chains we strolled to the river and weir where crowds were enjoying the sun; Japanese tourists in a river boat below us heading for the weir, cameras working overtime, theirs and mine. A stream of open-topped city tour buses laden with tourists and a rowing race on the river added to the very jovial atmosphere - needless to say that rain had come to nought. 

Our maximum four hours in the short term car park had ended. Steve drove around the city centre a few times but car parks and spaces were universally full so we headed out of Bath planning that we would come again sometime to explore this truly attractive city. Very stylish houses in some of the streets; about every 5th house had a B & B sign on the fence. Long, long queues heading into Bath made us pleased that we were heading out.  All through the drive both ways we passed many places where roadworks held up the traffic with one way controlled lights so it was just like home in that respect although their control seemed much more efficient. 

Travelling along the A4174 towards the M4 we passed the first and only rugby field that we saw during the whole holiday. Crossed the River Avon a couple of times. There were many roundabouts on the semi-rural roads which were very well sign-posted - a feature of UK roads we think. Via the M4 (that runs East-West between South Wales and London) then circled over the M4 to join the M5. Faster but not as picturesque as the small roads on which we'd come south. We were in the Midlands. Didn't pass through Dursley. After quite some distance on the M5 we veered off onto the M50 towards the Malverns via the A38, A4104, B4211 through the quaint town of Malvern to Upton on Severn that was even more quaint. Once again no available car parking so we didn't stop although Steve paused enough for us to see boats on the river and a line up of moored house boats. Over the Malvern Hills, favourite walking area for locals, with spectacular rural views over Worcestershire from one side then Herefordshire as we drove down the other side. The houses on the Malvern Hills are large and expensive; the area has several private schools. Home through Ledbury on the A438 through the Frome Valley hop growing area.

After a delicious roast dinner we watched the World Cup play off for 3rd place. Germany 3 Portugal 1; a most enjoyable open game with goals rather than penalties and very few ""Hollywoods""."

"event","There'd been a lot of publicity about the anniversary of the bombs and the awful threat from the terrorists so there was a heightened awareness on the 7th. I was not at all sure about the wisdom of travelling that day but we were running out of days.  We'd expected there to be a heightened police presence on the stations but although there were a few around it wasn't like it was last year for the following Thursdays after the first bombs.

We caught the overground train to London Waterloo and then the underground to Paddington Station.  That was where the biggest difference was noticeable.  In the tube carriage when we entered there was no one else at all. That was just so weird.  Even on the underground platforms potential passengers were few and far between.  I'm a real scaredy-cat and wasn't looking forward to the trip at all but had followed the principle of ""if your number is up, it's up.""  I was very pleased indeed to arrive at Paddington unscathed.  That station was very crowded with people, cases and general bustle and bustle.  There were regular announcements about 2 mins silence at 12 noon.  Our train to Didcot Parkway was marginally late so we missed that altogether.

It was raining when we arrived but a smiling Eliz was there to greet us and whisked us off to her delightful home at Sutton Courtenay. A welcome wine - Marlborough Sauv blanc, of course - and we were off catching up on 12 months news.  She is really well and seems to have a great life sorted out for herself.  Bob's children, her step-children, are really caring and good to her; she's involved with a travel group that means she gets about quite a bit and still keeps up her editorship of the newsletter that she's always been responsible for.  We had a tour through Bobs's domain where there are still numerous books left but 10 times as many empty shelves now.

The small metal garden fantail was very well received but somehow I don't think it will end up in the garden. She very quickly found a place for it in the family kitchen where it looked very settled.  Once again she'd experimented with new recipes for our visit and we had a very interesting ratatouille for lunch - it was actually cold but can be served either hot or cold. Delicious.  The experimental red currant meringue wasn't quite as successful because she didn't have the right shaped dish so the bottom hadn't cooked quite as she'd wished but it tasted great.

She delivered us to the train later that evening and we headed off to Hereford.  Actually the very beginning of the day had been rather odd because we'd still not been able to connect with Steve by phone - they'd been out all the previous day attending Jess's graduation. LLb with 1st class honours from Manchester Uni.  MrFan tried the phone just before 8 am and was greeted most warmly by S. who expressed no surprise when MrF suggested we could come to them that evening direct from Didcot. That meant a lot of scurrying around to pack a case before we left.  We didn't arrive in the North until after 8 00; the welcome was truly spontaneous and warm and we didn't look back."

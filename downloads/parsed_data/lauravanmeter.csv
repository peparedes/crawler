"event","so, my life is going pretty damn shitty right now.  everytime i think something might go right, of course, it doesn't!  why does this shit have to happen to me?  uuuggghhh...i just don't know what to do about it.  i'm sad.  i'm in a deep state a lot of the time, and i don't know what to do about it.  i need something.  what, though?  a boyfriend, perhaps, might help.  or maybe i should move to a far off country where no one knows me, and start anew.  hell w/ it.  maybe china or the czech republic.  

i'm stuck in murray right now, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  i miss my roommates, so i'm glad i have been able to spend some quality time w/ them!

we met these crazy guys over the weekend.  jarrod and i really bonded sat night.  it was a lot of fun.  then, things happened when i was not around.  homie don't play that.  i am not one to usually care about this sort of thing, but this was a different situation.  so, obviously, there is no interest by either of us.  it just still feels weird, though.  him and i have done some crazy things this past week.  things i have never done in my life.  why did i feel comfortable enough to do that w/ him?  i dunno.  he's getting ready to be out of my life for good, though.  that's probably best.

well, i guess that's all.  i'm thinking about going for a late night walk.  i am just lying here on the couch up above mr. ed's.  i can't fall asleep.  i am just thinking way too much about things.  i think i just need a little alcohol to clear my mind.  good night to all."

"event","today has been pretty darn crazy.  i had to be at work at 8:45 am.  i got there, and a little after 9, i started feeling weak.  i was in the middle of checking someone out, and i felt like i was gonna pass out.  then, i got the feeling like i was gonna puke.  i tried to hold it, but knew it would be coming.  so, i yelled at my supervisor that i was gonna be sick.  she told me to go in the bathroom.  i went in there, and puked out stomach bile.  it sucked.  all foamy and yellow.  not a good feeling.  and i was so incredibly hot...i was sweating a lot.  another one of my supervisors came in there to check on me, and she was freaking out.  she told me i was white as a ghost.  so, she told me that i couldn't drive home.  she told me that she'd call my mom to come and get me.  how embarrassing is that?  yep...my mom picked me up from work cause i was sick.  she thought i was pregnant.  she said laura if you think you might be, just tell me.  i said, ""mom...i'm 100% sure that i'm not"".  she's like, okay...  then i was crying like a baby cause i didn't feel good.  it sucked.  but, mom fixed me some soup, and got me a cup of sprite.  i love my mom.

chad spent the night w/ me last night.  he was half drunk when he got over here, which was very entertaining.  he took a shower, had a long conversation, then went to bed.  i woke up w/ him at 5am.  he didn't actually get out of bed until 6.  we just kept hitting snooze.  it was fun, though.  he's slowly but surely recovering himself.   

well...i just took a long hot bubble bath...now i'm ready for bed!"

"event","well, it seems like life is in fast forward right now.  things are kinda crazy in my life...just moving back to gc and all.  after months of debate, i decide to move back.  i truly love everything about murray, but i just couldn't get over the fact that i was 2 hours away from my family.  from my neice and nephew who are growing up day by day.  i'd been in murray for two years.  it was a good run.  now, i have an apartment in leitchfield...working at wal-mart, and going to ecc.  maybe i'll go to ecc this year, and transfer to western next year...then graduate!  i have two more years of school left, which sucks, but at the same time, i don't really have any other plans at the moment, so i might as well go to school.

as for my trip to china...it was fan-fuckin-tastic!  i had such a blast!  i went from riding a camel on the great wall...to riding (well...attempting to ride) a unicycle w/ chinese kids...to fixing supper w/ a chinese couple that didn't know a word of english.  it was the trip of a lifetime!

my relationship status...single, of course!  i think i'm ready to be in a relationship, though.  i don't really have many friends here in leitchfield (that i hang out w/), so a boyfriend might not be too bad!  i don't really have anyone in mind, though.  i used to, but he disappointed me.  now we're strictly friends...if there is such a thing...we'll see.

a big shout out to lyndsay...thanks for stopping by to see the new place!  sorry i wasn't in good spirits!  i feel much better now!

i might go to carbondale tomorrow.  jeff said that i could meet him (it would be almost half way for me).  and i talked to jason, and he's thinking about going.  it just makes me so happy.  i haven't been w/ those two boys at the same time for almost a year now.  i love them!

i go in at 11 today and get off at 7.  at least i'll have the night to do stuff.  i'm supposed to go see david and bethany.  i hope i'm not too tired.  or lazy.  i'm pretty damn lazy!  but, i haven't seen those two cats for a while, so i really need to get my ass over there.  beth invited me over for supper last night, but i was at my mom's house.  my mom fixed me supper.  it was delish!

as of this morning, i am officially unemployed.  my work is weird...they only wanted me to come in when they need me, which is completely understandable.  however, they don't tell me when they need me until that very day.  i don't want to be on standby.  i'd obviously rather not have a job.  i am only here for one more month.  only one.  i can't believe it.  it makes me so sad.

there is something missing in my life.  well, a couple of things, actually.  one is the absence of my family.  i love them so much, and being here in murray, i NEVER get to see them.  once i get home, i will be so happy.  but, then i will miss my two wonderful roommates, and all of my other GREAT friends here in murray.  the second thing is a boyfriend.  i have this very lonely feeling in my heart.  i am usually not like this.  i am usually a happy girl.  but, this loneliness feels as if it's taking over, and there is a slight depression.  not like a major problem of depression, but i just feel depressed.  i don't know how to handle it, because i have never had this before.  i am surrounded by people i love and adore, so i don't know what the deal is.  maybe if i go to sleep, it will all go away."

last night was a joke.  things were crazy...people are immature.  oh well.  i danced my little ass off, along w/ alicia, mb, and crystal.  it was SO much fun!  i ended up getting a little make out action from a random guy.  it was so much fun!  meanwhile, alicia and crystal were partying in the dj booth!  we couldn't find them.  it was weird, but VERY amusing!  (>>>this was after we got kicked out of another club for meghann's underage drinking<<<)

mb and michael picked up some movies.  we've seen em, but that's cool.

chad...i don't know about that kid.  sometimes he's alright.  sometimes he's not.  i can't help but feel a certain way about him.  i am not in love w/ the kid by all means, but it's so weird to me, because i have never liked someone this much.  i've never had a boyfriend.  i told him that my little heart is tender.  we'll see. 

it's off to bed for me.  courtney called and invited me to a party, but i am so incredibly tired.  i'll have to pass.  night."

"event","it hailed last  night.  it was crazy.  i danced in it outside.  then mb, brett, and i all went to the huddle house to eat.

mb is getting so crazy.  she was in my room last night.  we were talking at about 1 a.m.  now, for mb to be up at that time, is beyond my belief in the first place.  she said she was hungry, so i was like, let's go to the huddle house.  she's like, okay.  so, we went to the huddle house.   suprisingly, there were more people there than there was before.  it was crazy.

i bought a new video camera yesterday.  it will be put to good use.  spring break is all that little fella will know!  it should be quite interesting to watch the videos once we have returned from our journey!  as brett said, ""everything that comes out of that is gonna have to be labeled ""too hot for tv"""".  he is such a little cutie.  i love that kid.  but babies freak him out.  candlewax don't, though.

well, i'm sure most of you murray people know by now that jason got the job in louisville.  he starts mar 25.  that is no far away.  actually, that means when we get back from spring break, he will not be here.  it makes me sad.  i randomly cried when he told me about it.  i felt stupid.  but i can't help that i love the kid.  we will probably get some sucky neighbors.  that's okay, though.  we will still party it up...and not worry about a damn thing.

we're going home today.  matt mckinney is riding w/ us.  that reminds me...i need to go get my cd's out of dan's van.  maybe i'll do that today.  i need to go to the bank."

so...this semester is aweful.  my classes are not going too great...i'm not putting any effort into them.  it's my own fault.  oh well.

alicia, mb, and i decided to go to panama city beach for spring break!  i guess we'll probably get a little crazy.  make out w/ girls...wet t-shirt contests...coyote ugly.  you know, the usual spring break things!  i have to admit, though.  i've never been anywhere for a college spring break.  now, in high school, i went to gulf shores w/ the fam.  i have a crazy feeling that it won't be all lambert's cafe and go cart riding!  us girls...we're ready.  we are ready to bring random guys back home w/ us.  we are ready to dance on top of the bars at coyote ugly.  we are ready for the pina colada foam parties.  but...is panama city ready for us??? that, my dear, is the question!  haha

jaime brought a crazy game over tonight.  we (me, alicia, jamie, and jason) played it over at jason's.  alicia won.  it was a dvd/boardgame that jamie had played when he was a kid.  atmosfear was the name.  it was creepy as hell.  the scary guy on the tv kept calling us maggots.  how attractive.
well...i guess that's it.  i have some beauty sleep to catch up on!

marriages are getting crazy.  i got asked to be in one today.  i couldn't say no.  i know they haven't been together for very long, but they are both good people.  and they haven't done anything wrong to me!  i can't complain.  i can just toast to them, and do a little dance...which, i might add...the bride would love more than the groom!!  HAHA..oh well.  as least they have someone.  that's more than i can say.

i'm up at 1:40 am.  i am so extremely tired, but can't sleep.  partly because i'm really worried about many different things, and the other part because there is a party going on next door.  i had to go make a complaint earlier, but i don't want to be a nazi, so i'm not going back over!  it'll be alright, i guess.

things are so crazy in my life.  i feel as if i'm watching my life go by, and i have no control of the situation.  it's such a weird feeling.  i should have every bit of control over my life.  i can't seem to grasp it, though.  my heart, the crazy partying i've been doing lately...i just don't know.  like alicia and i were talking last night...we can resist anything but temptation.  maybe i just need a better sex life!  that might solve a lot of problem!

so...i got drunk the other night, and went into a porn store w/ some of my friends (they were sober) and bought some ""anal eze"".  it's crazy, because i didn't really even remember it until i stepped on the bag the next day!  i wonder if i'll be using it anytime soon..."

he finally got better.  i had went to the hospital every day that chad was in there except for one.  however, one day, his bro. walked in and told me that chad's ex. was there.  and boy, was she!  she made sure that i knew they used to be together.  this girl is freakin 16 years old!!!!!  i can't take it!  
but, his bro told me not to really mention her name, because he didn't really remember her being there, and he didn't want to talk about it.  

life is just so confusing.  i hate it sometimes.  why does it have to be like that?  i thought i was a good person...why can't anything good happen to me?  UUUGGHGHGHG  oh well...maybe i just need to wait. i'm getting impatient.  

chad is finally home now.  i don't know about it.  his memory is not very good.  he don't really even remember me being there this past week.  it's aweful.  but, like i told him, it could always be worse.  he should be thankful that he is still here.

I was yelling ""ALICIA!  my Leg is STUCK!""  i thought a tornado was gonna come through here and tear us all apart.  then, i finally got my pants on, and jason came in the apartment, and he's like ""laura, quit freaking out, it's gonna be okay!  the siren is just to let us know it's in our county, not our city""  i was still freaking out...it was too close for comfort.  i almost started crying.  
then, i had to be at work. when i got there, they already had all of the kids in the entire daycare out in the hallway.  they were all crying.  they had to sit there against the wall with mats over there legs.  they were hot and confused, and i just felt so sorry for them.  we were out there for an hour and a half!  poor things!  so, me and this guy i work w/ were singing some johnny cash to them.  i calmed them down a little bit.  we were just thinking of random songs to sing.  we also sang some temtations.  it was pretty awesome.
so, to make a long story short, i freaked out over nothing yesterday, but i was prepared, just in case!  we were gonna run over to the hughes st. party house to go in their basement if a tornado really came!  we went over there to talk to them about it all day yesterday, but no one was ever home.  i would have busted up in there regardless, though!"

so, anyway, we decided to get dressed and head on over.  it was really fun!  but, i was freezing!  i met a guy named chris.  he was pretty awesome.  his friend asked me if i would make out w/ him if they did a little dance routine for me and alicia...i told him i would.  they did the dance, and it was pretty awesome.  but, i didn't kiss him, just because nothing else was said about it.  me and alicia decided to go back home and put some clothes on, and we saw jason and his friends stumbling around the parking lot.  me and alicia hadn't drank, so we were having so much fun laughing at everyone else!  
we went back down to the party and just mingled...talking to EVERYONE at the party.  it was so much fun.  
jordan got mad and made an ass out of himself in front of everyone.
mb and crystal were so wasted, that they kept falling on the ground!  it was so funny.  mb stuffed the pumpkin bag w/ newspaper, and at the party, it was falling out everywhere!  i laughed so hard!
i don't know anything about that chris guy that i met at the party, but i am gonna look for him on campus.  he seemed so incredibly nice!  me and him just kept looking at each other and smiled.  i bet he would be a good boyfriend.  or just a good friend to hang out w/!
i have a test to study for.  i haven't even started.  i don't know what to study

tomorrow is the day taylor was buried.  i can't believe it.  just to think that six years ago, my life was a trainwreck.  i lost my very best friend in the world.  sometimes it don't feel like she's gone.  it just feels like she's in leitchfield w/ everyone else i don't get to see.  but, i know that she is in a much better place than i am.  it just makes me so sad.  i miss her so much.  i just hope i never lose all of the memories i have for her.  that is my only fear.  i never want to replace her...she can never be replaced.  i just hope that she knows that i think about her every day of my life.

"event","i am finally feeling better, thank goodness!  but, this morning, poor marybeth was up puking!  she looks and sounds aweful!  i feel so sorry for her!  on top of that, she was supposed to go to a career fair to give out some resume's and business cards, but she can't go...she was looking forward to it!  now, she is just laying here...drinking ginger ale and eating crackers.
today is lyndsay's birthday...i hope it's a good one!  
my birthday is next month...that is so hard to believe.
well, i guess that's it...i'm gonna go downstairs and get me some fries or something at mr. ed's!"

"event","i hate this stupid weather-it changes every other day!  yesterday, i woke up, started to get ready for class, and i realized that i had some sinus stuff going on in my head.  i felt a little awkward, but i got me a cup of water and drank,after i took my morning pills.  then, i started gagging, so i ran to the bathroom and puked.  then i started crying like a big baby.  i went in my room to grab my socks and shoes, and went into the living room to put them on, and i just cried and cried.  alicia and mb were standing at the door, waiting on me, and here i was crying.  alicia told me not to worry about going to class.  but, we were getting a test back, so i wanted to.  but, i knew i would just have to leave class to puke, so i decided to stay here.  i put my pj's back on, and then puked about 4 more times, and then going to sleep.  i slept ALL day.  it was so great.   jordan came and brought me some flowers.  i barely remember him being here.  
today was a little bit better.  i'm not puking, but i have sinus stuff going on really bad.  it sucks SO bad!  i feel really dizzy.  i've just been laying around again today.  but, i have to go to work in about an hour, so i don't know how that is gonna turn out."

"event","today was so stressful.  i woke up at 6:30, got all dressed up, and was at alexander hall at 7 am!!!  i was the first one there!  then, we got into some buses and made a trip to paducah to observe in some classrooms.  the teacher told the kids that we were having pizza for lunch, so i got real excited.  i love school pizza, after i soak up all of the grease w/ about 20 napkins.  but, it was a HUGE disappointment when i got into the lunch line and noticed that the pizza was like pizza slices.  it was crazy!  it wasn't so tasty!  good thing i had those animal crackers and orange juice when the kindergarten class had snack!
i got back into murray at almost 2:30, when i had to be at work...i go there and am SO crabby. not mean, just crabby.  that's okay, caalum kicked me!  i about bite his ear off!  damnit kids get on my nerves sometimes.
then, i watched my usual tv show:  wheel of fortune.  however, i did not watch the end, so i don't know if my wheel watchers spin id number was called!  i guess i better check!
landon came over and we studied for our humanities test together.  i hope it isn't too hard!  i also have a rec 101 test tomorrow.   i can't complain, though, because they are my first of very few tests of the semester! 
now, it's back to more studying, and off to bed!
i may fix me some more mini corn dogs...those things are the BEST!!!!!!!!"

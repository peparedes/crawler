The future may become a bleak place. Fifty years have passed from now, and while much of what you know is the same, things are beginning to get much different. The media is still a prime powerhouse, and the invention of (and government limitation of) virtual reality doesn't seek to bring society back together. Meanwhile several radicals have gained huge amounts of political power, and by utilizing the most-advanced technology they seek to bring whole populations under their control. The climax of these tensions has just occurred, thousands of nuclear missiles knocking out communications and eliminating cities. And while most were stopped by orbital defense stations, the distraction it provided allowed the release of the strongest weapons: individual psychic powers. As an individual with psychic powers or weapons training, it is in your ability to decide the fate of civilization.

We are a small RP site starting out, but we allow a high degree of freedom and our number of members should slowly increase. Everyone creates their own character from scratch, deciding history and what kind of powers they've acquired since the attacks. There are multiple factions you can work for, striding to save the world, destroy, or just figure out who's pulling all the strings. Come by and check things out!

And now for another list
~~~

Books you should all read;

Brave New World
Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?
Farenheit 451
Flatland
1984
Restraunt at the End of the Universe
All four of Dan Brown's Book (or at the very least The Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons)

Although you've probably read them all. What can I say, I'm pretty mainstream. The only book I really have on my list is Clockwork Orange and maybe Heart of Darkness.

EDIT: Oh, and Catch-22. I've been meaning to read that as well.

"event","The hero, left broken (his arm never heals right), is forced to beg for the next year, and move between jobs. He makes barely a living, and for the most part this is summarizied until the year ends. The only thing note-worthy is that there is one girl (in her late teens) who continually gives him money, despite the fact she too is poor. While this disturbs his now perputally paranoid character, he still accepts it.

Anyway, at the end of the year the girl finally buys him lunch, and there is a brief conversation. Also, while she steps out, a beautiful women confronts the hero and asks if he'd like a night with her. He forcefully rejects, and the girl has to shoo her away. Anyway, then in the next couple days the city under goes an industrilization, and a massive plant is set up. The hero flees to the next town.

There he encounters the beautiful women once again. Once again, she attempts to seduce him (although not quite in the exact way you might think; also, it fails partially because the man she's trying to seduce is blind) but this time he actually gets pissed off enough to hit her. Well, this causes the restless town to strike out against the blind man and the hero's forced to run off. He gets saved by the girl who fed him earlier, and she takes him to a small camp outside the city, where he meets her best friend (a young man) and her best friend's girlfriend. The hero sleeps overnight, but he wakes up before everyone else and leaves.

Why? Besides the obvious reasons (he's uncomfortable with them) he also ends up having a vision that the man who killed his friends is in the north/west/east/south (direction isn't determined, and really doesn't matter). He travels into the mountains, only to find the rebels (aka as the demons in the first chapter) fighting the army (aka the force you fought for earlier). He edges around the fightning, and ends up getting near the peak (partially because he senses a negative prefrence). As he arrives he finds a man with a large, silver/gold sword, who is know speaking in a booming voice. He speaks of eternal riches and how they will drown the enemy. Then to prove his point, he stabs the ground with his sword and, well, a circle around the stab suddenly melts, and out pours various liqiud metals. The great circle of metal then begins to ooze over, and the ground all around it cracks. The man is still safe in the middle, and he makes a small path to get back over.

Well, the hero then confronts him, and almost kills him. Almost. The man tumbles back into the wound of the earth he created, only to come out once again as a great gold golem, wielding a gigantic sword. The hero kills this demon, grabs the sword (now shranken back to its normal size) and begins to climb down the mountain during the ending battle. Well, he encounters the scythe-wielding man once again, and they have a very depressing conversation. The hero breaks down, but the man gives the hero back the soul of his friend. The soul then blesses the corrupted sword, essentially purginig it into a more holy sword. Anyway, both men leave.

The hero returns, but only the girl is still at the camp. Shes says her two friends went back to work, but she stayed behind to wait. The hero apologizes, but she doesn't mind. Minor dungeon on the way back, and then your back at the now more technologicaled city. While the two friends seem to have lost their old jobs, they got jobs at the new plant.

The hero stays at the girls house (along with the other two friends) for a few days, but they then all recieve news that there's going to be an attack against a nearby rebel camp during which the city will be flushed of rebels, while the rebel camp is also purged. Well, while the hero doesn't care his friends do, and they vow to leave the city, slow down the army, and warn the rebels. The hero doesn't agree (mainly because he was raised to hate the rebels) and leaves to kill the leader of the rebel camp (he doesn't reveal why he leaves to everyone else though).

The party of 3 begins to take off, but rumors circulate of the girlfriend being a rebel, and she is forced to stay behind. As the 2 take the path to the next city (not rebel held) our hero begins to cut through the forest. He quickly meets a higher-then-thou (personality wise) monk. The monk offers for them to travel together, and the hero doesn't care one way or the other.

The party of two precedes down the trail, through the town, and arrive at a mountain, all that stands between them and the camp. They know the army will take this route, and decide to cave-in most of the mountain to slow them down. Then while they're taking care  of that, the monk and the hero arrive at a massive wall of fire. The monk is horrified, and together the head into the flaming forest.

The party of two begin to evacute while the hero and the monk reach the top of the mountain the other two just passed through. There they find the cause of the fire. There stands a loud, passionate, pyromanic. He easily beats the monk sending him down the mountain, and then confronts the hero. The hero defeats him, but gets knocked out by heat stroke, and is rescued by the badly bleeding fire starter.

They all meet up at the city, with the rebels safely leaving and the army going around the mountain and through the burning forest. The sleep the night at the inn, but the hero has another vision and almost takes off alone. The boy (the one who's friends with the girl -- the girl being the current heroine) wakes up, and decides to tag along, leaving the girl with the fire starter.

I'll continue this in another post, but enjoy for now.

Again, all questions, comments and thoughts are apperciated, along with obvious cliches, confusing areas, and advice. If there's anything you think I should change tell me now when its still easy and I'm still willing too.

Oh, tell me if any of my quote of the days overlap. I don't really remember what I've used and what I haven't since I've read them all already.

"event","I have this habit of, when I feel bored I'll randomly create video games, with just a small or general plot, and then just do it to fill my time, moving on within the next day or too. I just do it to have fun (my larger projects tend to end up stressful, especially with how I get more people involved), but I figured I'd just write it all out here (because I feel like it, I guess).


Bah, anyway, it starts with the main character recieving a message from his nations capitol to take tests to see what kind of work he can get (such as soilder, smith, etc.) he happily accepts (or he has to, rather) and leaves his family, friend, and his teacher (who taught him combat, mainly guns and stealth) behind.

He returns only to find his village burning to the ground, and as he runs around the field of burning his houses, he encounters a cloaked man with a shining dagger. The man kills the teacher in front of our protagonist, and flees.

He finds his family and friends shaken, but alive, and they are all forced to move to the capitol city. While trying to set everything up again, our hero gets the results back, and it seems that they believe only he can find the 4 legendary crystals and save the world from a great demon. A government offical appears, who is supposed to help him, and out they go adventuring. Yadda yadda yadda, he journeys through 4 dungeons, and earns these 4 crystals. During this is three friends join him (all childhood friends, a boy and 2 girls. One girl is still a child at heart, and hasn't changed since when she first met our hero. The guy tends to get aggressive, and it seems he doesn't put friends first (although hes just human)) The other girl is pretty generic personailty, in the sense she's sweet, caring, and appears to be naive).

They then journey to the castle where the demon is supposed to lurk, along with an army.  They bust down the door and enter (the hero questions why they don't actually have the crystals with them, but the offical traveling with them hushes him). Anyway, they start slaughtering 'demons' and near the start the male friend leaves; he wants to split up to explore the castle, and he hopes that he can find riches to benefit them all. Eventually they arive in the inner sanctum, and encounter a large scythe wielding man. There's a massive fight as he unleashes his army (the fact their all human seeming never comes up. The hero is hushed about the non-demonic appearence of everything, and in the end he accecpts it all; anyway-) against the army the hero and the offical brought, and the offical rushes through to tackle the man. The man pulls out his dagger (scythe doesn't work that well in tight quarters) and after a struggle he kills the man. The offical screams how the hero should avenge his death against the beast, and as the army of the 'demon' dies off the hero reaches the man. The hero suddenly gets trapped in a position, and in moment of fear becomes a deer in the headlights. The man thrusts his dagger to kill him, but the heroine (the innocent one) jumps in front and gets her belly sliced open saving our protagonist. She rolls to the ground, and theres a brief scene of her eye contact with the now-crying man. There's also a non-seen scene, in which the man turns into the Angel of Mercy, and using his Scythe kills the heroine. On the players side she just closes her eyes and (clearly) passes on.

The other heroine (the one with peter pan syndrome) trys to pull the hero away and save him, but this angers him and he gravely wounds her with HIS dagger (guns aren't good close quarters either) and tears into the large man. He screams about how blind the hero is, and that the light has blinded him. He easily beats the hero into submission, and using his dagger, gouges out the hero's eyes before leaving.

The hero sits 'crying' on the ground, and the alive heroine shows up, only to break the hero's primary arm and leaves. The hero limps out of the now empty room and leaves the dungeon.

The hero's other friend shows up, and agrue vehmetly with the angry protagonist (about how he left them to die to 'death', the man with the sycthe). He almost fights him, but when he realizes his condition he just leaves. The hero limps out into the world, and so ends the first chapter.

Whoa, getting late. I'll do the second chapter later, probably. This turned up to be entertaining. Anyway, post comments thoughts if you want. Otherwise, um, don't.

I've also just finished reading a plot guide to FF7, and I must say it is a rather good plot. Currently I have to figure out how to fit Sephiroth into the forum's future plotlines, which only seems problematic because I don't want to get to close to FF7 but I don't want to get to far, either.

Um, I'm trying to think of what's happened recently. During spring break I just did about 5 days of LAN, filmed the Japanese movies (which we watched (this week), ours and others, including this very interesting one on Japanese suicides). I then went to my Grandmother's birthday (some big event with alot of old people I didn't share much in common with, although random thought, old people can be interesting, at they've had a whole life to have events in, so the 5-minute summary of their life is alot deeper then yours). The day after, got a couple teeth-filled. Recently, not much as happened, although today there was a riot at school. I was at Anime Club at the time, so I didn't see anything, but I heard about it in 5th period (lasting 3 hours, an hour over normal school).

Oh, I just figured I should write this down in case I ever want to know what I was doing back in spring 2005.

P.S. The birthday party with my family is in two days!

Anyways, not much as actually happend since the last time. I got sick last week, and stayed outta school a couple days with a sore throat and general faintness. I still have the runny nose from it. Then on Saturday I just hung out with Kris and Tai (as usual) and we just went over to Westside (And I got MT #3! Yea!). Although after lunch I got this shooting pain up my leg when I stood on it (dunno why, it went away, too). Oh, and on the way back someone crashed into the bus. It was really weird, the bus is pretty big. And Tai had to fill out this damage-report card. 

Then on Sunday we went to my grandma's for my mom's birthday, which went very normal (I was sooo tired though). Funny thing I learned though, my great-grandfather was a member of the Masons, that secret society you keep hearing about.

And today (Happy Valentine's day, btw) we had the pep rally, which I found to be very funny (and not in that intentional kind of way). And I had a test in math that I probably failed. Honestly, math was one of my best subjects, but now I'm just beggining to hate it. And it's the only subject my mom cares about T_T  Oh, and physics is still a bitch. I hope Latham breaks a leg and we get a replacment.

Oh, and to finish the journal off:

And, gah, other things that are to harsh to talk about.

Lesse, oh, for once I did NOT do LAN after school. Rather, I ended up filming a video for my japanese class with Greg and Roby, which was very fun to make. Although we ended up with so little footage, I dunno how were gonna do. But it's extra credit, we don't actually get graded for it (the video we get graded on is later...)

And, um, I can't think of what else to say, so I'm going to stop.

Honestly though, I've been very down as of late. I can't tell if its cause break is about to end, or I just randomly got depressed. 

Anyway, Christmas went well. I got a bunch of stuff, including a few books from my grandmother (now I've read 3/4 of Dan Brown's books. Good stuff it is.) several video games, the new nintendo DS (although I can't play it; my hand starts get this searing pain after fifteen minutes or so) and a nice amount of cash. Nothing that unusual, honestly. 

Um, lesse, I still have homework to do. Homework that I *might* do. I don't have alot of time left though. I was going to do it today, but noooooo, had to go to a dentist appointment. Waste of 4 four hours (all 4 of my family members go, and we go to my dad's old dentist, which is quite long drive away, near where he used to live).

Ugh, I don't feel like going on about this. So I won't.

But I'm getting up later and later each day. I think I'm gonna go nocturnal by the time I see you all again. Last night I didn't even go to sleep till 3. But I prefer night to day so much. The darkness, it's so comforting, really.

Which brings me to my next complaint. It's winter, and there's not a cloud in the sky. I mean, we live in Southern Cali, so I don't exepct it to snow, but could we at least have a drizzle? Something to put me in the holiday spirt? It's not even cloudy. I though it was a couple days ago, but it all cleared away in an hour. Freakin' desert.

Ahem. Anyway, can't say I'm in the holiday spirit. Haven't been since I was a kid. It's just another holiday. *sigh* God, this entry seems pitiful. I'll just catch you all later. And Merry Christmas. May you all get expensive gifts.

"event","I was pissed off when my dad said I was on my own thursday. For I had to either walk home or take the bus, and walking home already twice in the past couple monthes I thought 'what the hell, I'll take the bus. It shouldn't be too bad'.
Of course, I've never gone on a bus (not counting all those times when I was a wee young one) without SOMETHING going wrong. And this would be no diffirent.
To start things off, as soon as I got off campus, BAM I was lost. After awhile walking in a more-or-less random direction I figured out that I wasn't going to get to the bus stop I wanted to get too, but since I was close enough already to one that carried that same bus I figured what the hell. Well, see, this stop is farther down along the route, so already it was packed with students. And me and my goliath backpack (fucking school) had to stay up near the front. Okay, not so bad. Well, see, we weren't even at the next stop and some guy yells at me to get out of the way of this old lady (who I hadn't seen, as I was looking forward, and in swinging around I would probably kill 3 people). this wasn't so bad, but he thought I was some uncaring little teenage bastard, so I got pissed off. This caused my apologies to come off sarcastic, and he yelled at me more. I kinda had to restrain myself, and I just stopped doing anything (the old lady left the bus anyway).
Okay, now the bus cleared a little, and I was able to get my pack over one of the wheels (you know what those big grey things in front are). Still in front, now. The problem was though, that old guy was still there, and people had to squeeze past the both of us (I could barely move now). Then comes ANOTHER little old lady. Who clearly couldn't squeeze past us. And since that fucker didn't want to move, I sat down so that me and my backpack cleared outta the way. Then the guy next to me says I'm a cruel guy for taking that old ladies seat. Thank god a seat was empty across from me, and I said she could use that (guy still didn't believe me, and he took credit for the seat). I ended up talking to the guy, and it was actually a pretty nice conversation (still never really explained myself though). And after he left the remaining ride went fine.

Only now my hands smell like hobo.

Oh, that's right.

Right now, I'm leader in 6th period English. Which, is so difficult (have you ever tried leading teenagers when you hardly know any of them?) that I tend to take this very easy apporach:
I yell ""Does anyone have any ideas?""
Someone replies with some idea, but in relativly hushed tones.
I then repeat that idea, just louder.

I do a little more, but that's pretty much all that happens.
And it's due friday, the same day I have two other tests. Although at least those two big projects are gone.

Staying on that leadership note, I'm trying to practice being Commander in Natural Selection. The only problem, is it's really hard to grab the CC in online games. Not only that, I tend to have this fear of commanding in larger games. I can barley manage 3 people, 10 is kinda too much. And then at LAN, Tai doesn't want to play NS, time doesnt want to do NS maps (which have commander) and Sean won't play on my team, as we'd butt heads before he became commander. And the only reason Sean doesn't mind me being commander as he thinks/knows that I suck to much to be a threat. So I'm not too happy on that front. The only good thing as of late is that I seem to be spotting my problems, so I activley know how to improve.
Ender's game was such a good book...

Anyway, I still have some english homework I should do. And I do need to work on the RPG more. So g'nite peoplez.

For starters, thanksgiving was fine for the most part, but it was incredibly boring. I brough my computer, but I didn't do anything (no internet ;_;) And I couldn't really talk to anyone (they talked to each other >_<) And it lasted longer then any other visit we've had there, so I was bored for a long time.
Oh, and my cousin's becoming a bit of a jackass. I think his parent's displince him too much, and I think he's maturing too fast (I think society tries to make all young kids teenages so they only have to make one kind of product for an audience). But I don't really know so much on the topic.
Then at LAN I wanted to try going down to Santa Monica Place or something like that, but no one would come with, and since we couldn't coordinate on games nothing really happened. So that's another good 6 hours I lost.
And saturday and sunday were very similar. I got up late, then I just worked with Kris/Tim on these huge projects for a good 4 hours. Which I really hate. Especially cause I still have to do all this shit.

And I'm failing Physics and Math right now. And, it's just really frustrating. I just used up all my energy with all that hard work I did earlier, back in grade school. So I'm just worn out now. When it matters. Go figure.

My sister's laughing behind me right now. It's pissing me off. I don't know why, but I really hate it when someone laughs and I don't know why. I think I'm a little messed up in the head. But enough for pity or anything.

Well, this turned into a rather long rant. I wish it was more interesting, but my life all comes out like this. Sad, really. Although it happens to most people. Most adults anyway. People who are dull to pain of life.

It was only for one point though, so I just gave up.

LAN's getting less fun. Sean and Tim really have too much supreriority. The only game which I'm actually okay at is NS (see icon), but Tai hates me for it. So I dunno about all that. 

My brain's kinda getting lazy. All that school work isnt good for it.

Man, I have to figure out what I'm gonna do with the RPG, to. I talk like it'll exist, but my programming skills are so minimal. But I'd like one game I design to be played.

The weather was so nice though ^^ Although Kris thought it was too chilly. But anyway, the arcade was real fun and what not. Played one of those FPS games. If you can really call it that.

It ended up creating the FDA, and the working requirement association, or whatever it's called.) I mean, maybe if you just thought it was all a thing of the past and it's all better it would be fine, but I'm sure there's some unknown injustice going on. Some are known, and nothing happens. And even if you think about, many people and businesses are unethical, and apparently we've have less free time then farmers from 100 BC had, will I'm sure our morale is even lower then back then. I'm beginning to think alot of the problems were kinda taken care of because religion created a system of ethics (although it all went down the crapper, most likely because the threat of divine punishment didn't work) and a way to offer insight. (On a side note, many Asian cultures did have more of an honor system, which is a reason crime is so low in places such as Japan.) But now it kind've has all disappeared. Life is very hard to survive, I mean I'm sure I'm luckier then so much people out there who starve their entire life, and at least I have a place to live. I know I shouldn't think about it, but I can't focus on homework.

Not that it really matters, and you probably don't care anyway.

Oh, right.

Lesse, for the first part of the day I was just kinda depressed for no apparent reason. I just felt sad. I just kinda read this book I have to read, and wrote more of the RPG. Although a little DII helped. 

At about 4:30 I left to go have dinner with my grandparents, for reasons I don't really know. It went pretty well, considering. Went to this Italian place that was both Classy and Tacky (yes, both, don't ask me how, it just was), and I had this tuna pasta thing. My grandfather just prattled on about diffirent things, went into his past a little. Something occured to me during this though. I seem to note negative actions a person does, but if they're nice and kind, how much screwed up views should it take for them to be a bad person? It was more complex then that, and I don't want to get into too  much detail, but I rolled the thought over in my head.

And now I'm here. Oh, and took this from Kris' LJ:

Hopefully there will be at least one more home game though. I should see sean in marching band and all.

Today was the first (and probably last, not that they'll be much opposition to that) pep rally. It was fine, but it's way to fucking crowded. I ended up just sitting in the nose bleed section ""with"" Chris. Anthony later caught up to me, but he doesn't have alot to say. He's just very angsty and angry nowadays, and frankly it's getting repetitve. But I listened to him cause I have nothing better to do. I could never seem to respond right though.

After 4th (which I slept through for the most part) I went to anime club. Sadly though, the projector was broken so we couldn't see the 2nd FLCL episode. I tried to help them out, but all I did was get in the way ;_;

Alas, I now sit here typing this up. I'll probably play Diablo II or something soon. Maybe work on the RPG more. But I want to get a review from Tai.

Not much to say otherwise. We had house meetings today, which was fine. Knocked out a period, which is all that matters.

I should get to bed soon though. I'm always tired, and everytime I wake up I feel so depressed. Just because I'm tired and the fact school doesn't let me sleep.
Let's ignore the fact that's its 11:30 at night shall we?

We stopped doing warcraft at LAN, which I'm ok with, it's just the only game I'm better then sean at, and I dunno. CS and DS just don't do the same thing for me. I suppose it's variety though.

Although we should mellow out LAN all together. It's causing homework problems, and I wanted to move the days but Tim's too lazy and paranoid to let us, and Sean has band stuff fridays. We could not do LAN but I dunno how everyone feels. And sean has way to mcuh power within our little group. Although he's smarter then he let's on. I have the feeling he knows what he's doing. >_> <_<

And, ugh, I'm gonna go to bed. I'd like to write more, but I can't think of anything, and I need sleep. My head's swimming for some weird reason right now.

Although that's only a problem because I always feel like I should do all the work. I usually don't though. See, I'll just do nothing until I get tired and go to bed. I lose alot of time 'doing' homework.

Nothing else really interesting. Life's just chugging along. Our group at school's getting small though. Ever since Dash left, and then we never saw Ty anymore, and now Chris goes back and forth. Not that I'm against any of them doing this, I'm just saying.

Ummmmm... Peace out! oV ^^;

I think the main problem is that I didn't relax enough during summer. I used the Warcraft map editor and did LAN too much. I didn't do nothing enough. But I hate not doing nothing. And I'm still pissed at myself for entirely finishing my hero arena. And yet I'm still against the fact that I'm obbessing over warcraft too much. Ugh. But that's beside the point.

For those of you who care, I'm taking Physics, Japanese 3, Digital Design, US History, Pre-Cal/Calc (which annoys one of my friends (not saying who) to no end), and English (taught by my 9th grade English teacher).

Oh, and according to my Japanese teacher, there might be some way that all the kids in Japanese and the Music Kids can go to Japan. (Apparently the music kids go to a foreign country every year, and this year it's Japan, and Kata Sensei is trying to talk to him so we could all go. But personally I doubt it, and even if we could, it'll probably be a couple hundred dollars.)

Well, hopefully things will get better in school though. I mean, its not like anything else can happen.

Which consisted of recipies from a Kansas cook book my mom got (from god knows where), most of which consist of sour cream. One was this greatly ad-libed mac & cheese that was so cheese-like (although, really, it tasted like fat) made me want to puke. Although there was a dessert like dish that came out really well. As far as my mom's friends (and their kids) went, they were all fine. Although one's a retard. Literrally. She has some metabolism problem. And those god-damn parents didn't care about her, and we were left to entrtain/watch her, whcih made the afternoon a long hell.

Today it's self was okay. Although Anthony left earlier then I thought, and when I invited Sean (and just Sean) he invited Ty, and I was pushed into inviting Tim. And my mom exercises in the front of the TV at 3 (which is enough to make you gouge your eye out), I just had us do LAN till around 8 (sorry about not inviting you Chris, but I couldn't find you on AIM).

And tomorrow's an eye-appointment, but I have to get these eye-drops that dialat my eyes, and I have to where these giant shades for the rest of the day.

And I need to work out more. And my crappy little diet doesn't help. But I don't have alot of time, even with a dropped class.

And I wanna get out that dusty software my dad got me when I was so young to work on the RPG (did I mention that already? Well, whatever.) But it's all so much more then my Warcraft map editor. And only a little better then coding.

But I really can't say alot more. So far this is all boring. But I have no real emotions that I don't keep private. So boring is all you'll get.

Oh, and I pray my mom doesn't make any more KKK cooking. The book seems more like a gag gift then something to cook with.

But it seems all school sucks. And I can see why America ain't up there in IQ tests. Really, you have to go to school for so long, that your little developing brain will begin to assoicate all learning with pain. Being dumb's just relaxing. Ignorance is bliss! ^_~

And even if I didn't have it, I still would lack much alone time. I've overbooked myself on LAN, CC, WCIII Map Editor, and D&D plans (all group). And I'm not particularly social with my friends (didn't I angst about that earlier?). Although Ty has summer school and (probably) a job, while Sean has band practice late summer, so some things may be knocked out.

And I have to keep working out. Don't want to lose anything I might have gained via weight training.

At least summer school's only 6 weeks (followed by 9 days in Japan). So I get 3 weeks off. I can regain any lost sanity in that time, right?

This time it still came up to short (thrillsville), and I hate that, considering how much work we did. Although this time we only did music in silent areas, and even then we were forced to use preset music. So now were left with praying for a grade.

Nothing too much eventful elsewise. Although my dad seems to have given away my first computer, which REALLY pissess me off. It's like giving away Tiger Woods first golf club or Hitler's first gas chamber. So now I've lost all my first games which I remember. I'd like to play them again. I can barely even remember those little Shareware games. They say you can't go back again. I just never thought it came with a free insult and a kick in the nuts.

I started playing this old Game Boy color game of mine.

I always pity those old games. They last for a year or 2, and then there forgotton. Go to www.gamefaqs.com and visit the board for any old game. It could've been great, but the board is empty. Forgotten. Something that took years to make now just gathers dust. But really now, the main disadvantage is if I play something old noone else plays it, and I can't really discuss it. And progress is good. But just the good games (good, not great) get forgotten with new systems. And they never get their squels. Just something that bugs me. You could skip this paragraph if you want (to late to say that now, huh, >_<)

Anyway, time to get back to that.

"event","My apologies for not updating in the past, um, month. But it was just to much work. I had to do all this school work, and then I need to play to keep stress down, and then this was more a an unessarcy work thing then something I was graded on. But now that sping break has started, I'll attempt to update daily.

Lessee.... today... well, after waking up and killing time just desgining something that I really don't want to be my main priority, I left to go do this japanese project.

Remember that video? Well, same thing but heavier and free-choice. I wished it would take an hour or 2, but somehow it ended up into a 7 hour endveour. I dont know why but there alway's hard. The only good part of the day was when we bought dinner to use for the video. There's something fun in a group of your friends just hanging out. I don't know why, but sometimes I wish I was more social. I can't even remember how to make friends. And whenever I try to do something realtivily social, I kinda get ignored. Usually only if they have other friends near-by though. I suppose by highschool everybody's already found their friends. Their niche. Their clan. But I digress.

Sorry for that angst-ridden entry, but this is what LJ's for. More for my benefit then yours. 

QUOTE OF THE DAY:
""Since the social victim has been oppressed by society, he comes to feel that his individual life will be improved more by changes in society than by his own initiative. Without realizing it, he makes society rather than himself the agent of change. The power he finds in his victimization may lead him to collective action against society, but it also encourages passivity within the sphere of his personal life."" - Shelby Steele"

"event","I spent the day talking with friends until around 4:00, when I had to go put on a suit. Complete with frowny face bow-tie. I always hate dressing up, although I didn't bother complainig. I've learned to not bother fighting things you can't change. And it didn't really matter. I should dress up, and it actually wasn't that bad (although later on it gave me a sore toe and the bow-tie was a little tight).

We arrived early so my dad could set-up. I should have been bored, I mean I had nothing to do, but then, I wasn't really. I just kinda of went deep into thought. I guess when you get older you learn how not to be bored. You just can naturally enterain yourself. And really, it is always good to think. You need to stop and revalute your life once in awhile. Although it can certainly be depressing. Especially when you've done something wrong or made a bad call. I always wish I could do a retake. I ended up just thinking throughout the entire party, and just presenting myself. Go up to my dad so he could say ""Here's my son, Christopher"". That's the really the only reason I was there. A presentation piece.

Other then that it was just a fancy party. The food was awful, other then dessert, which was actually good, and the entree, which they served in such small quanities. There was no chaos either, which suprised me. Nothing went wrong. I don't know why, but it disappointed me. Maybe we live for chaos. I suppose it spices up our lives.

In the end I was tired as hell, and I just wanted to go home. I ended up feeling a little lonely too, just seeing my grandparents together, all happy, (in past photos) and how they used to be. I just was tired and depressed. I was still sick, too, and I felt awful. I don't know if I'll ever get better, really. My immune system is shot. Too much stress. No one understand's what I go through. But everybody says that. Maybe because it's true. Maybe it's just a human excuse.

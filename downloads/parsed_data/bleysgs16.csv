"event","I am having a freaking trainwreck of a day.  Or have had.

It started out okay - I arranged things so I could actually sleep in til 5, which was pretty sweet.  It kinda went downhill from there. I had already called in an extra person, but then someone else called in sick, so we were still shorthanded.  Then, basically, I got beat up.  Literally.

First, I got smacked in the face by a villainous edging (basically a strip of wood that gets taken off to make a square-edged board).  That was fun.  Then, I was trying to free one board from a tangle of other boards, and dropped it on my finger.  Somewhere in the midst of this, the knee of my increasingly thinning jeans tore, so now I'm down to 2 usable pairs.  I should probably get some new ones.

The general cutting strategy for the next week change twice over the course of a couple hours, causing me to backtrack on original instructions to various people, and then to find them again and backtrack on the backtrack.

Oh, and after the shift, while I was changing the computer setup, the mill lost power.  So, when I could have been having dinner, I was restarting computers.

...And I have two more days of this.

Okay, that's better.  Rant over."

"event","My sister in Portland and her family went down to the Bay Area last weekend.  Originally I was planning on going down this coming weekend, but it ended up working out that I could head out of town this past weekend as well. 

So, good - time with some of the family and the nephew before the holidays.  But wait!  It turned out that my other sister in Arkansas was ALSO going to be in the Bay Area for a conference, and was coming in early for the weekend.  So, crazy.

It's odd how unusual it has become for all of my family to be together in one place.  It is an event that has become exclusive to large holidays.  To have everyone suddenly meet up on a random weekend, something that used to be normal, was really pretty special.  I got to hang out with my nephew, play catch with my sisters, and go to a football game with my sisters and dad - something that hasn't happened in about a decade.

A pretty awesome weekend, and something that made me that much more excited for upcoming events.

Oh, and apparently many of the senior Betas heart me.  That was...really amusing."

"event","As I have not posted here since mid-July, and this seemed like as good a time as any to (perhaps) restart things.  I had a chance for a longer weekend, and so arranged to take a quick flight down from Reno to Las Vegas to visit one T. Paul Findley.

It was great to see him again, and also good just to see and hang out with someone around my age again.  Some highlights of the trip:

-From the airport we headed out to a good mexican restaurant, where we both stuffed ourselves on chips, enchiladas, tacos, etc.  There seemed to be several birthdays that night, which apparently comes with a shot of tequila at this establishment.

-Walked around Fremont Street, which was a pedestrian area, and did not feature cars.  It did, however, feature motorcycles going around and around in a large metal sphere.  There were several possible-bum-type people who were getting a leeeettle to into things.  Pretty cool display - I didn't get a picture of it, but if you search for ""Motorcycle Sphere"", you'll probably find it.  Also featured was not one but two guys making paintings with massive amounts of spray paint.  It was pretty interesting, and the paintings looked really pretty good, but there was still something kinda sad about the whole thing.  The crazy lady yelling at us that we were all going to hell probably didn't help.

-On Saturday, we went to ""The Bite of Las Vegas"" which was an outdoor concert/food sampling event.  We stood in line for what seemed like an hour, but was probably shorter, for some good barbeque - brisket sandwiches and fried okra.  We also got some garlic fries, listened to Vanessa Carlton and Fuel, and then left because the event was on this grass/dirt field that was being subjected to gale-force winds.  We went back to Trevor's house and smoked cigars for a while and caught up.

-On Sunday we went to breakfast, where I ate a pancake that was bigger than my head.

-It was off to Red Rock park, for some hiking:

Overall, a really great weekend, and something that I've needed for a while.  Something I didn't need - after being healthy for pretty much a full year, I hop on a plane to Vegas and suddenly have a cold.  In the words of Han Solo: ""...I feel terrible"" - Okay, it isn't that bad.  Luckily there isn't a whole lot going on this week."

"event","Today, obviously, is the 4th of July.  As such, it is Chester's biggest day of the year.  

For one thing, it's prime summer/vacation time, which means those with access to vacation homes on a lake are going to utilize those homes.  Since it is a major holiday, they are going to utilize those homes all at the same time, and push Chester's infrastructure to the breaking point.

For instance, yesterday there were at least three trucks...with boats...trying to fit into the Chevron station.

Here is a glimpse into the chaos that is Chester on the Fourth:

<a href=""http://photobucket.com"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb191/yggs_limb/L1000891-1.jpg"" border=""0""></a>
The tail end of the parade, featuring hot rods, fire trucks, lumber trucks, Shriners on scooters, and boy scouts with a spray nozzle that sprayed just far enough to look refreshing without actually reaching anybody.  Visible in this picture are people who have seen the end of the parade, and are sprinting to their vehicles to get out of town before everyone else tries to do the same thing (Well, I guess 'sprinting' doesn't really apply to the lady with the walker).  There were at least a couple thousand lining the streets, and I barely avoided a really awkward encounter with an employee who was engaged in the main July 4th pastime: Drinking in public.

<img src=""http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb191/yggs_limb/L1000892-1.jpg"">
About an hour after the parade, people are refreshing themselves in the Feather River.  To the left is part of the annual July 4th craft show.  Not pictured: The massive line of cars behind me, still trying to get out of town.  I literally walked around the entire town in the time between these two pictures, and Main St. was still gridlock.

<img src=""http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb191/yggs_limb/L1000893-1.jpg"">
The Arts and Crafts show.  In the summertime, there is one of these roughly once a month.  It's...kind of a big deal.  Some things of note:  The event organizers have cleverly conserved space by eliminating articles so the sign reads ""4th July Arts Crafts Show""; these booths mainly consist of ceramics, wood products, shirts, and home made soap...and apparently 'sticks'.  Not readily visible: As he is an occasional resident, Chuck Norris was good enough to sign copies of his biography in support of the local soccer team, in addition to making available non-signed copies, and a fictional book he wrote.  Unfortunately, Chuck himself was not in attendance.

...It was kinda weird, really - my sister and her family are spending the 4th-week down in the Bay Area with our parents and I went down to see them, but had to come back for work on Tuesday and then Thursday-Saturday.  This is the closest to actual activity that Chester gets, but I really just couldn't get into it.  It's weird to have this huge event going on, and have no one to spend it with except people I know from work - and most I can't really be that social with.  The crowd, more than anything, was fairly oppressive, and shockingly there was no stunningly attractive woman in the same situation with whom I could strike up a conversation.  

I've actually come to enjoy living here, but at times like this, it really just sucks."

As this weekend was one of the last ones I would be able to get out of town for, I headed down to the bay area, went to a baseball game with my dad...and WU'ed it up with one Patrick E. Kabealo.

I'd been meaning to get in touch with him previous times I went down, and it never really happened.  I called this time, and he and some others were having a get-together for one person who was moving away - all nice enough to extend me an invitation.  

<strong>Some Things You Apparently Are Still Allowed To Do On Normal Weekends (Though, It May Remain Inadvisable):
</strong>
-Beer Pong in a garage.  (I hardly ever did this in college, yet somehow I didn't suck.)
-Getting several sheets to the wind in semi-dive bar. (Which featured Pat and I rekindling traditions such as Beta-Rules foosball and shuffleboard.)
-Late night fast food runs.
-Crashing on a couch.

Now, I'm not going to render judgment on whether this is actually acceptable behavior - for now, since this was the first regular weekend I've been able to do regular weekend things in, possibly, a year, I'll just say it was nice to see it is still possible.  Whether it's something I actually miss, and regret not being able to do everytime - I'm not sure."

Still, that was kind of the last remaining connection to the school, so it should be some kind of momentous event...but I'm kinda finding I just don't really care.  I think at this point I've left that behind, and this was a formality that was a long time coming.

"event","Due to the new schedule which is not entirely set yet, I had today and yesterday off.  Convenient, since one J. Edward ""Not Crazy, Just... A Little Unwell"" Lynn was scheduled to stop off in the Bay Area for all of Wednesday.  Originally, he was planning on driving all the way up to Chester for LUNCH, and then driving all the way back.  Due to the sudden days off, I was able to head home Tuesday night, and had a day with Hustin.

Some Highlights:

-We had some breakfast at Millie's (a Lafayette institution).  We grabbed a table and menus, and a couple minutes later the waitress came by whilst we were conversing, and called out ""BEEP BEEP!"".  We both looked at her, and she repeated her ""BEEP BEEP!"", while miming lifting things up - indicating we should pick our menus off the table if we wanted it wiped.  Said waitress also later joked that, no, Justin could not have the waffles.

-Justin explaining fairly loudly in Millie's his views on the liability problems of hazing.

-Showing Justin such Bay Area landmarks at the Fish Ranch Rd. view, and the Lawrence Hall of Science fake whale and oversized double helix.  Oh, and that red bridge.

-My horrific attempts at merging while trying to traverse three major bridges.

-Lunch at Fisherman's Wharf, at a restaurant that overlooked a veritable sea lion city consisting of at least a dozen floating platforms.  On one of these platforms, one sea lion decided it was going to have some space to itself, and proceeded to push every other one into the water.  (""Some people *oof* are just *oof* jerks.  Stop that, Mr. Simpson."")

-Justin's attempts throughout the day to make sure via phone calls the members of his top secret mileage alliance knew about the fare mistake to Brazil, which they were all trying to keep under wraps from the mileage riff-raff.

Non-Justin related:  I had a belated birthday dinner with my parents, which was nice.  A fair amount of family is actually coming up to Chester for Memorial day weekend, and apparently we will be eating birthday cake.  Better late than never, eh?"

"event","It has now been one year since OMGraduation.  It seems overly simplistic or clich&#233;d to do a big reflective post on an anniversary, and it, in fact, is.  Nevertheless, I press forward.

""A Year Removed From College"" is a milestone that exists in the back of the mind from the moment ""Removed From College"" springs fully formed from one's forehead (creating a headache that could easily be confused with a hangover).  It is similar to thinking about what life will be like at 50, or if a band will continue to be enjoyable after a fifth album.  Simply, wonderment and/or fear at the possibilities of the future.

One year ago, as, I believe, with my fellow graduates, I contemplated what my life would be like that time next year.  Would I be happy?  Would I be successful, as much as possible after one year?  Would I have fallen flat on my face, into a bed of quicksand, leaving visible only an open-fingered hand slowly sinking into the earth... metaphorically speaking?

For my class, from what I have been able to discern, and myself, life is unquestionably altered.  College graduation is fundamentally different from any other transition in life.  At least, it was for me.  I, my friends, acquaintances, and non-friends, with the occasional exception possessing a Life Plan, have moved forward on a journey of self-discovery.  College was a time to feel out tastes, identities, and beliefs.  It was somewhat like fording a tumultuous river, in that it was invigorating, and dangerous, and immensely satisfying to reach the opposite shore.  The thing that is difficult to realize, though, as one stands sopping wet on the other side, is that the real challenge was not the river, but the land now waiting to be explored.

When I headed to Chester a year ago, I think what I wanted more than anything was something I could say I was doing.  I wanted not to have to say, ""I don't know..."".  Chester was something to do; a story to tell people to get them off my back.  When I first came here, I had no business doing what I was doing.  I was playing at a job that held no future for me, having never studied forestry, or botany, or even more than entry level biology.

Things change, though, or perhaps they transition.  Thanksgiving marked a point where I stopped playing and started working, and the six months since have taken the form of one long revelation.  I have felt increasingly qualified in everything I have taken on so far, and am starting to be increasingly interested in where this might lead.  I enjoy the work I do, and in addition I seem to be doing well at my job.  I enjoy the company, and am satisfied that I seem to be helping in its success (or, in this lumber market, the lessening of failure).

The nice significance of anniversaries is that they give an opportunity to mark the passage of time, and note our own progress.  Personally, I'm looking forward to the progress I can make between this milestone and the next."

"event","I took some vacation days and had a 4-day weekend up in Oregon.  It was a very nice break, but also, as seems to be common on trips like these now, I have come to a bit of self realization.  The following is me calling myself out, and coming to terms with some things.

I have been in Chester for almost a year now, and I have never accepted it as permanent, or even, well, real.  From the get-go, I seemed to hold it as an interruption of my life.  That's when the trouble started.  The population and isolation of Chester has been well documented here.  Yes, it's small, and yes, there is hardly anyone here my age.  However, I never viewed that as a challenge to be overcome, but as a sort of Kryptonite hanging from my neck, holding me down.

I have used my isolation to make myself isolated.  I've been sitting on the bottom of the pool, holding my breath, not realizing I was drowning.  My life will not miraculously start and shift into high gear at whatever point I leave Chester for someplace else.  My life started a year ago, and I have been neglecting it.  It is time for me to take responsibility for my own happiness, and stop pining for school, or someone else's situation.

So, several things.

For a month or two now, I have felt disgustingly out of shape.  For the past 8 years I have had cross country, or Ultimate, or something that was keeping me active and fit.  For about a year now, I have had flings with jogging, or yoga, but nothing long-term, and I hate the way I feel.  I am going to start running again.  It is getting into the summer months, but with my current schedule, and probably the one for the next job I take on, will give me free time before things get sweltering.  For now, I just need to start running every day, and if that can lead to something bigger, so much the better.

Also, I've been complaining bitterly to everyone who will listen about how I don't know anyone here and how I'm so alone.  Then I do nothing about it so I can complain to the next person.  Well, helping both this and the last issue, I finally looked on the UPA website, and found several possible pickup games nearby on the weekends.  One that's possibly as close as 40 minutes.  So, once I verify which are still going, I'll be getting back into Ultimate.  It may or may not be hard-core, and they may or may not be my age, but for now it will be people to see outside of work and Chester, and that will have to do.

Finally, I'm going to do my best to get back in touch with the Chico Betas, and see if I can do ANYTHING with this advisor position that completely crashed and burned.  Maybe at least I can work with the person remotely over the summer, and help out some in the fall.

I still will be very busy with work, and a lot of this is going to require a ton of discipline, but I'm just not happy with myself, and change is needed.

I will make this work."

"event","(Unbelievable bonus points if you know what the subject line is from without looking it up.)

I've been thinking about this for a while now, and I'm going to go ahead with it.

I've decided to basically go friends-only on this thing (Though there will be the occasional link or whatever in the public realm).  Couple reasons for this:

- As far as I can tell, there's less than 10 people who read this, and the number for regulars is probably 5 or 6, and, I'm pretty sure everyone who might be interested in it is already on and a member, or knows someone who is.

- I haven't really been posting much recently, and I think that is largely because most of what I would write about would involve my job, and I'm not that comfortable making public comments about that kind of thing.  Just making it private will allow me to write more often and more loose.

- I basically have two reasons for continuing this - introspection, and keeping in touch with friends who are interested.  I think this will allow me to be more effective for the first, while continuing the second.

Anyway, most of my posts from now on (and hopefully there will be a larger quantity of them) are going to be friends-only.  I'm probably also going to go back and privatize some of the older ones.

If you read this and are strenuously opposed, leave a comment - or better yet, send me an email, since you should probably know it... ;)  If you are on LJ, but not officially a friend, get in touch with me and I'll see about rectifying the situation.  I will say, though, that I'm not going to 'friend' random people - in fact, my preference would be to keep it to people I know well - I reserve the right to deny access.  :D

-My car just hit 20,000 miles, mainly aided by many trips between Oregon and California, and many more between Chester and Lafayette.  The more I think about it, the more I'm confused by the various aspects this car represents.  It's the first major purchase of my life, and has served me extremely well.  It also represents what was probably the most traumatic event of my life, that being the Jan. 05 car wreck that necessitated another vehicle.  I really enjoyed that Volvo, and while I love the accord, it will always be linked in some fashion to the first car.  It's weird that I've now had it for almost 2 full years.

-Even though I think everyone (read: all four of you) who reads this hates baseball- Somehow pitchers and catchers are reporting this weekend!  How the hell did that happen?  Thus begins the 7-8 month obsession...

-Is it weird that, upon finding I and other employees were given chocolates in heart boxes, I was mainly annoyed at being reminded of ""V-Day""?  I say no.  Oh well - I take comfort in the fact that Saint Valentine was probably beheaded."

Opening credits: &#8220;Ritual Action of the Ancestors&#8221;, Rite of Spring, Stravinsky.  (That worked out FREAKISHLY well.  There&#8217;s even a bassoon solo.)

Waking up: &#8220;Echapp&#233;s &#224; grand peine...Errante sur les mers.&#8221; Les Troyens. Berlioz  (Opera)

First day of school: &#8220;Woman Can Drive&#8221; Matrix Revolutions, Don Davis.  (High paced chash scene.  Uh, that would be one goddamn terrifying first day of school.  &#8230;Actually, I guess it could work.)

Falling in love: &#8220;Variation I: Flute, Piccolo (Presto)&#8221; Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra, Benjamin Britton.  (Weird &#8211; I got it too, Daniel.  Falling in love apparently takes 30 seconds, and is rather basic stylistically&#8230;)

Fight song: Confusion (Blood Rave scene), Blade Soundtrack, New Order-apparently not The Crystal Method. (Holy Crap!  How did that happen?? Apparently I&#8217;m kicking ass for about 10 minutes.)

Breaking up: &#8220;White&#8221;, On Your Way, Flynn.  (I guess this kinda works.  &#8220;We all need someone, we all feel someone, we all need&#8230;sometimes&#8221; &#8211; although in that context the song would probably be from the perspective of not wanting to let go.)

Prom: Main Theme, Requiem for a Dream.  (Ahh!!&#8230;What is it with my school experiences?  I guess I go to the SCHOOL OF THE DAMNED!!!)

Proposal: &#8220;P.I.M.P.&#8221;  Get Rich or Die Tryin&#8217;, 50 Cent (AAAAHAHAHAHAHAAAA!!!!!)

Life: &#8220;For Whom The Bell Tolls&#8221; Inquisition Symphony, Apocalytica.  (This is a string cover band of Metallica and other heavy metal groups.  Somehow, I&#8217;m more OK with the instrumental version here than the original.)

Mental Breakdown: &#8220;Augie is Taken&#8221; Silverado soundtrack.  Bruce Broughton.  (This actually works rather well in this sense.  In fact, I&#8217;m kinda creeped out listening to it.)

Driving: &#8220;Eb-Major II: Largo&#8221;, Concertos 5&6, Op.8, Bournemouth Sinfonietta.  (Hmm, this must be one of those driving alone/reflective scenes)

Flashback: &#8220;3 Little Maids (the Mikado)&#8221; Captured, Bassoon Brothers.  (This could be flashbacky.  If it were a full-on childhood flashback or something.)

Getting back together: (OK&#8230;on this one it went to a Dane Cook audio performance thing entitled &#8220;Tire in the Face&#8221;, where he talks about a woman getting hit in the face by a flying tire.  It&#8217;s really funny, but cannot be considered music for a soundtrack.  This is probably against the rules, but I&#8217;m skipping to the next one.  It&#8217;s not that much better.)  &#8220;The Hunters Arrive&#8221; Peter and the Wolf, Prokofiev.

Wedding: &#8220;Rocket Man&#8221; Elton John.  (Great song&#8230;in this case, though, it&#8217;s kind of a &#8220;huh?&#8221;  &#8220;And I think it&#8217;s gonna be a long, long time, till touchdown brings me &#8216;round again to find, I&#8217;m not the man they think I am at home.  Oh no no no &#8211; I&#8217;m a rocket man.  Rocket man, burning out his fuse up here alone&#8221;.  Probably not a good omen for marital success&#8230;)

Birth of child: &#8220;Battle Cry of Freedom&#8221; Over There, Songs From America's Wars, Rob Carriker.  (&#8220;And we'll fill our vacant ranks with a million free men more, shouting the battle cry of Freedom&#8221;.  Yes.)

Final Battle: Piano Concerto #21 in C, Mozart For Your Mind, Mozart.  (If I severely overmatched my opponent in this battle, to the point of me just toying with him/her/it, it could work.)

Death Scene:  &#8220;Walk On&#8221;, All That You Can&#8217;t Leave Behind, U2.  (Strangely, this kinda works in this sense. &#8220;You're packing a suitcase for a place none of us has been, a place that has to be believed, to be seen. You could have flown away, a singing bird in an open cage, who will only fly, only fly, for freedom&#8221;.)

Funeral Song: Suite No. 3 in C Major &#8211; Prelude, Inspired by Bach - The Cello Suites, Yo-Yo Ma.  (I&#8217;d be down going out to Ma.)

End Credits: &#8220;Blue Set #2: Gang of Wolves&#8221;, Wanted, Bassoon Brothers.  (Fairly lively.  I&#8217;ll take it.)



If I had keep Dane Cook in place, Battle Cry of Freedom would have been for the Final Battle, and Walk On would probably still work for the funeral.  The Piano would be a little to cheerful for my death, I think."

I don't really like the fact that they're leaving Oakland - I think it leaves the city a little lacking, and detracts from the team a bit.  That said, it's been obvious for some time that Oakland was not in the position to pursue a major stadium deal (education, crime, unemployment actually are more important problems to tackle, y'know), and I have to say I'm pretty relieved that they'll be staying in the Bay Area.  I would rather them move down the road than to Vegas or other options like that.

I probably started about 20 snow encrusted bonfires of 'slash' (leftovers from logging operation - branches, twigs, needles, etc.), and then made sure they didn't spread anywhere they weren't supposed to.  So, basically I got to spend the day watching fire.

Sweet.

In other news, it snowed again last night/this morning - probably about 3 inches.  The crazy thing I've noticed that is probably really obvious?  Snow is completely silent.  I'm so used to rain, and it's inherent noise, that it's really weird to experience precipitation without sound.  I mentioned this to a co-worker, and he agreed, saying that it is almost an absence of noise.  It deadens everything.  Pretty cool (pun intended)."

This morning I had my first experience waking up to a whitewashed world.  There's probably an inch or more on the ground right now, and it was coming down until probably about 9:30.  It was only supposed to rain today, so this was a pretty neat surprise.  There was even a snow plow going around.

Apparently the hood of my car is 'slipry' enough so that the collection of snow has already slid off.  For some reason, I find this to be awesome.

Luckily, due to Ross' (...Ross's?) IM prodding, I went to the grocery store last night, so I really have no reason to go outside, which is nice.  I would kinda like to test out the new tires though, so maybe I'll drive around a bit later."

"event","A random topic.  For some reason, I really enjoy the social phenomenon (not that it's new) of the scandal suffix ""-gate"".  

Obviously this stemmed from Watergate, which is a hotel (is? was?  is it still around?), but it's taken on a life of it's own.  From <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watergate"">Wikipedia</a>:
---
<blockquote >The Watergate scandal left such an impression on the national and international consciousness that many scandals since then have been labeled with the suffix ""-gate"" &#8212; such as Koreagate, Contragate, Whitewatergate, Travelgate, Rathergate...The judging scandal in the pairs event at the 2002 Winter Olympics in which a controversial double-gold medal was awarded to Russians Yelena Berezhnaya & Anton Sikharulidze and Canadians Jamie Sal&#233; & David Pelletier was termed ""Skategate.""</blockquote>
---

The great thing about it is that, aside from national controversy, it can be used to over-exaggerate personal drama, or small-scale scandal.  Even just in the media, though, ""-gate"" adds a bit of unintentional comedy to any issue - turning it into a near self-parody.

Just in the baseball world in the last few weeks, we've had <a href=""http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/10/04/SPGI3LI45H4.DTL"">Coffeegate</a> and <a href=""http://www.denverpost.com/headlines/ci_4539120"">Dirtgate</a>.

"event","New from the land of domesticity:

I came home this weekend with an electric blanket, and it's pretty much the best thing ever.  

Chester, being at altitude and mountainous, gets quite cool these days in the mornings and evenings.  Recently it's actually been quite nice during the day, but that doesn't change the fact that the apartment gets pretty cool at night.  As a result, recently getting into bed has been a bit of an adventure involving what I like to call bed-sprinting.  This is where the sheets are cold enough upon entry that one must thrash about and move one's legs in a running motion in order to create some quick friction and heat.

Well, the first night of The Blanket required no bed-sprinting.  In fact, due to pre-heating, it was so warm and comfortable that I think I actually cackled in happiness for a couple seconds.

Winter is looking more bearable all the time."

It was also nice, at what I remember to be 7:30 pm on friday, to get drunk dialed by Weston and Travis.  Nice to know people are still thinking of me from time to time.  It was also nice to talk to the lil' Bro, who worked through a lot of adversity to claim the big number 1100 on the rolls.  I'm not entirely convinced that wasn't his plan all along, the crafty Texan.  But, in all seriousness, he took a lot of initiative and put in a lot of effort, without a lot of outside help, to get to this point, and it's cool to see him rewarded like that.

"event","I went to the Cal - Minnesota game today.  Cal won fairly convincingly, and it was definitely a fun time.  Like many things recently though, it was also kinda weird.

It may not sound like much, but Cal football was a fairly defining part of my childhood.  Pretty much up through high school, various fall Saturdays were spent at Memorial Stadium.  It is often touted as one of the best places in the country to watch a game, and that's really about right.  It's one story and 100% benches, so there's not much to distract you from the game and the beautiful location.  Down below you find the bright colors of the field: green, white, navy, gold.  Above, Strawberry Canyon is full of brown hills and green trees, rolling around, hugging the structure.  From our seats on the 25, you can see the valley stretching back, Tightwad Hill (where people too cheap to get tickets perch to watch), and the cannon, which fires after scores, wins, etc.  There really was nothing quite like enjoying a Golden Bear victory on a perfect Saturday afternoon.  In that moment, everything was right.  Unfortunately, throughout the 90s, this was something you could not enjoy very often because they rarely won.

I digress.  Cal games are things I always associate with family.  With my Dad, sisters, and grandparents.  The thing is, I realized today that due to my four collegiate years it had been quite some time since I had attended a game there.  The last time I probably attended, Grandpa was still alive, and at least as healthy as he had been for most of my life.  Grandma was alive as well, though already suffering from the first of three strokes.  Alayna was in Oakland, not Portland, had recently met her future wife, and my soon-to-be nephew was not on the horizon.

It was strange going back again.  Familiar, yet alien.  Some people around us were still the same (one lady asked my dad what his son was doing, as I was sitting next to him.  Apparently I've grown a bit.), while others had been replaced by completely new, and kind of annoying, groups.  It was still enjoyable and...comforting?  But, it was also obvious that it was a different entity.  This was not the event of my childhood; something that was done, because it was - that was what happened, and it happened with family.  Today was the event that I chose to go to, because it was something I would enjoy doing.  It was just one of many recent times I've had to realize that things just aren't the same."

"event","I get to the front of the line, leaving Portland, and the friends I visited with.  This is my favorite part of flying, these days.  I enter the walkway to the plane, and my eyes are drawn upward to the thin, yellow signs.  ""Caution"", they say, ""Uneven Surfaces"".  In-between, an angular stick man, in a triangle universe, is eating shit in spectacular, epic fashion.  In real life, this man's misfortune would stop traffic.  Some would laugh, in schadenfreudic glee, while a few others might rush to his side.  You can almost imagine him getting up, looking for a rock to crawl under, and, finding none, sheepishly waving in an attempt to diffuse the attention.  As it is, though, no one really notices.  The multitudes pass underneath, uncaring as to his impending doom.

On the plane, as a lucky member of Boarding Group A, I get the last beneficial exit row seat.  You know, the one by the window with no seat in front of it?  Here is the definition of <a href=""http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=bliss&x=0&y=0"" title>bliss</a>.  The good people at Dictionary.com, though, forgot ""6.  Stretched out legs on a Boeing 737"".  Skyler comes by, makes sure I know I'm in an exit row, asks if I'm okay with that, and tells me and my rowmate that they're all counting on us.  This is Skyler's first day.  The attendants tell us about safety - the potential transformation into a cruise ship, the potential loss of pressure, and the potential incompetence of Skyler.  He grins at the good-natured razzing.

Back at the terminal, 30 degrees short of horizontal, the stick man is probably thinking: ""Fuck, this is going to hurt.""  Sometimes, times like this - recently, I feel a bit like the stick man.  I am suspended in the air.  If you were feeling metaphorical, you could say I tripped on graduation, and the fast approaching ground is the rest of my life.  I have yet to land.  'Floating weightless' like Major Tom, I am waiting for definition, for direction.  Certainly, I am in the process of activity - busy, and working - but, without a specific objective or duration.  I wonder what it will be like when I hit.  Beneath me, outside the triangle, it seems everyone is passing me by.  It's a strange, ego-shattering experience, visiting good friends and realizing that life does indeed go on without you.  Oh, the friendship, the relationship, is still there, but no longer with a day-to-day basis.  You've already missed out, and they have, too.

In the air, the man sitting next to my feet reaches down and taps my leg.  He points out Crater Lake, as Skyler attempts to get drink orders taken down correctly.  For a time, the two of us discuss things bigger than ourselves, but then return to our respective worlds.  As we descend into Reno, the pilot ceases to fly the plane, and begins to ski.  He is trying to hit every mogul of air on the way down to the ground.  The first part of the flight was too boring for him.  In an apparent combat flashback, he then banks sharply and veers in dogfight manner.  My seat drops a little bit.  Bank.  It comes back up.  Bank.  Right about now, Maverick is switching to guns.  As usual, though, the plane and I reach the ground safely.  I've landed.  But, I haven't really.  Not yet."

"event","Fans have become my main friends here in Chester.  They keep the air moving, help me sleep at night, and drown out voices from outside when the windows are open.  

I turned the one in my bedroom off this afternoon, and immediately became aware of an outdoor cacophony.  I was suddenly hearing my upstairs neighbors talking, and became aware of one other conversation.  As there is only one window in the room, it was a little hard to tell from where voices were coming.  It soon became apparent, though, that this was not a normal conversation between two people co-habitating.  This was on the non-walkway side of the building, and it sounded as if two people were leaning out the windows, talking apartment to apartment.  This, however, was also incorrect.  

They were talking fairly loudly  - as if to cover a distance.  The lady upstairs seemed to be talking outward, yet, as I looked to the neighboring houses and yards, I saw no one.  I suddenly became aware of a shadow being cast against a nearby house, of a building frame, and a man inside it.  Try as I might, I could not locate the source, until it dawned on me that all the construction I had been hearing was coming from this location which was hidden by shrubs and trees.  Obviously, the lady upstairs had no such blockage, and was carrying on a conversation.  

Yeah, it's little weird to talk building to building like that, but that part was actually kind of neat since you don't often see that kind of friendliness or interaction.  It was odd to realize that there has been an entire structure built up and that I was completely unaware of its existence.

Yeah, yeah, I know - I need to find something more interesting to think about."

"event","There's this produce stand that is open most of the week on main street.  The guy who runs it is pretty nice, and we usually have a conversationish thing when I go there.  This is the type of stand where prices are very loose and weight based, and he'll usually give a break in cost.  

The last couple times he's thrown in some extra apricots or whatever (no, not a stalker, no, no drugged), and at first I thought this was just a continuation of rounding off prices, etc.  Today, I was buying a bunch of apricots, a couple onions, and several hand-fulls of green beans, after which I was told I 'eat like a bird', and he gives me four more pieces of fruit!  Like, another half pound.  I was walking back to my car, and this other dude who was waiting for his wife told me to 'eat hearty, buddy!""

I think these people seriously think I'm wasting away.  I need to figure out a way to gain some damn weight.

(I reserve right to take that back in 15 years, after my metabolism slows to a crawl.)"

"event","One fairly neat thing about the current edition of My Life is that I live about 30-40 minutes away from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lassen_Volcanic_National_Park"" title> Lassen Volcanic National Park</a>.  I believe this to be one of the more unknown and underrated parks out there.  It has an amazing variety of natural exhibits, from the world's largest ""plug dome volcano"", to hot springs and sulfur jets, to lakes, etc.

Anyway, after several weekends of vegging around, I went with my uncle and climbed Brokeoff Mountain.  Lassen has several peaks, including of course Mt. Lassen, that originally were part of a massive thing called Mt. Tehama.  This was about 1,000 ft higher in elevation than Lassen, and over ten miles in diameter.  Lassen was basically a lava vent on the side of it before it collapsed into itself.  Brokeoff is the second highest peak in the park at 9,235 ft, so named I'm assuming because it's what remains of a Tehama side after the majority 'broke off'.  

The hike, I have to say, was really awesome.  I will completely grant that this was no Everest, or Mt. Shasta or whatever else.  What is was, was a really interesting and varied hike, which culminated in a great view.  As opposed to Lassen (which I think I would also like to do, maybe later in Sept.), which is pretty much a straight shot up switchbacks out in the open, the Brokeoff trail winds through brush, trees, and open spaces.  This wasn't a climb just to get to the top and say you did; it was a climb to be experienced and enjoyed.  Your eye was always drawn to something, whether a close stream or meadow, or a long range view of Lassen and (reeeally long range) Shasta.

I really enjoyed getting outdoors just for the sake of getting outdoors again.  It was nice to spend a weekend going out and doing something I'll remember for a while.  ...and it was really fun to actually summit a mountain, even if it was a minor-ish one."

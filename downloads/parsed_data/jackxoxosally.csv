"event","i have that Only song by nine inch nails stuck in my head and i cant type!!! AAAAAA! i curse the caps lock key. oh my goodness where do i begin? umm...today i learned that tofee almond bars make you feel ucky inside. and i did a pretty drawing last night that i just remembered that i forgot to have my dad hang up. i cannot push those tacks in the wall myself, i might break a nail! and tomorrow i have to go to school and get my schedule and all that and my mind is overloaded with stuff! first of all i was gonna go with my friend but when i called her back tonight she said now shes going with my other friend. so i said what u r just ditching me now! then she said nooo..im gonna call u tomorrow(the thing starts at 11 in the morning tomorrow) and get you to come with us. so now i dont know what im doing! whee!! then all this stuff we have to buy tomorrow costs money which i seem to be lacking. and my dad is all sort of mad at me cus i went out and bought a camera phone with MY money that i worked for!! oh and then i called my other friend and shes all ur interrupting my movie and she was halfway serious about it! what is going on???? im considering being a hermit in my room and drawing forever. just drawing, nothing else. lost in my drawing world. but no. they cant make it easy, can they. i have to eat and sleep and go to school and deal with all this money! u know the whole purpose of our lives is making money. thats really all we do. we are born, go to school where we learn how to know stuff and then we get better at stuff and then we learn about jobs and get a job and make more money. all of our lives we are just trained to make money. then we die. and money doesnt matter. unless theres a dying fee. which, there is actually. funerals and coffins arent cheap. see!!!! money. its sad. its like devi says...a closer look at what's wrong with you might scare the s**t outta you. am i quoting comic books now? god i am a nerd.

that grey cat on my mood thing looks exactly like i feel"

"event","woo i haven't updated in a while. hello! lots has happened since last time. most importantly, i found the second I Feel Sick!! lol maybe that isn't most important but definitely runner up. it's such a good comic and i am so being Devi for halloween. what is up with me and this halloween fetish this year? oh well. anyways, umm saturday i went to the mall with my friend sarah which was good cus i hadn't seen her in like a year practically. hehe i got this button that says drop it like it's hot and it has a potato on it. then the next day i went to san francisco with trisha and lots of other people whom i love i just dont feel like typing all their names. i learned that day(once again) that i dont like tea. yesterday i went with renee and liz to the mall and we got a makeup thing done. i didn't really like it too much. makeup makes me feel fake. im content with just making up my eyes. eyes are everything anyways. before the mall though i hung out at renee's and we watched sesame street lol. the number of the day was 13. renee taught me this one thing on her drums. i think i'd be good at drums, but knowing me i'd get sick of practicing and have a 1000 dollar drumset doing nothing in the house. oo and also yesterday my laptop came! its a lot harder typing with it though. i guess i'll just have to practice. today i must work..again. grr. tomorrow i HAVE to do that stuff for school. i will not, will not!! put it off til the monday before. lol. well i g2g get ready for work and do some other errandy things. im actually getting a life again! lol. ttfn xoxo"

"event","hey! wow two entries in a row what now!! lol about the title..there will be no little secrets told i just have that song in my head now. lalalala im bored and in a good mood. i can't wait until halloween! i decided that i will be devi. now all i need is someone to be my nny. that should be fun trying to find(sarcastic tone). omg today i was on this thing called sloganizer and i typed in the keyword jhonen vasquez and it comes up with a slogan for you based on the keyword. one of the slogans it came up for for me was I'd sleep with Jhonen Vasquez. lmao i was laughing so hard. im thinking about putting it in my sig for gaia. no i guess i won't. because what if he has a gaia and then he reads my sig and then he's all well that one's a freaky fangirl. so no. god i really do rant about nothing on these things don't i. no wonder no one reads them. oh well i'll go now tah! xoxo"

"event","hello people. though i think only one person reads this so hello person! lol i haven't written in a while i guess i just haven't been in a journally mood. school is coming up soon and that makes me sad. i want to get my schedule so i can know things!!! its very suspenseful. i have most of my stuff i need, but they don't tell us specific things we need til the first day, which is also suspenseful! grr. speaking of grr, i got the cutest gir bag for school! i just hope it's not too small. oh well if it is ill just have to carry a lot in my arms. the roof people came again today. none of us knew they were going to though, so i got woken up at like 7:45. i went shopping with renee yesterday and we didn't buy anything. that worries me. lol im losing my shopping drive. i have to save my money anyways cus next weekend im going to san francisco with friends. i haven't been there in a really long time, which is sad cus it's only like an hour away. it makes me angry that everyone gets to travel this summer. not angry really, just jealous i guess. oh well when im rich and famous i shall travel! hah yeah right. anyways, hmm what else? well i finally watched BTVS this morning, i haven't watched it in a while. it made me renew my liking of Willow and Tara. and my dad says they shipped my laptop out today so maybe i'll get it sometime this week. oh and i found out online that my JTHM moment is pondering. it's very true. but i do know one thing: the light does go out when you shut the refridgerator door."

"event","Hello! I am muy aburrido..no it's aburrida cus i'm a girl right? whatever. anyways, not too much is new. i got over my sickness by saturday so the whole family went to go see Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. I personally thought it was way better than the original, but that's just cus I like Johnny Depp and Tim Burton's style. Oo I also got the new Garbage cd this weekend! I like it. My favorite songs are Bleed Like Me and It's All Over But The Crying. The slow dark songs are so me lol. This morning I finally finished my sketchbook. It's so pretty I shall draw in it today. I already have a drawing of Nny on the first page. He's so adorable...in that pyscho killer way heehee. It's also a little distrubing that he looks just like my brother, only cuter cus he wears combat boots and trenchcoats. my brother's girlfriend even thought it was him when i showed her the picture. Do you notice how I go from using proper grammar to not using it and then using it again? it's strange. I might go to Pacifica this weekend. Other than that not really much is going on. Actually all that stuff was really more of filler stuff anyways. Oh well if you're reading this it kept you occupied for a few minutes. well, i g2g now tah!

"event","yes i do really. not so much today though as yesterday. i went to work and couldn't stop shaking and my head was throbbing and i almost vomited and everyone was yelling and AHHHHHHH!!!!!!! I left. I didn't go in today either but it's okay cus they're nice about it there. plus i think they like that they don't have to pay me for two days so i don't see why they would be mad about it. anyways, im starting to feel headachy again and it ruins everything! we were supposed to go to monterey tomorrow but we can't now so instead we are going to go see Charlie and the Chocolate Factory which should be good. those cursed oompaloompas or whatever they are spelled scare me mucho. i was reading the slg livejournal thing and its friends were all the comic book artists and i read their posts. they made me wish i was all famous and stuff. i want this Spooky shirt that they have for sale online but alas i have no credit card or money so i will wait until christmas, the magical time of giving!and receiving...hehe. only like 3 more months till Halloween! yay i have to start planning my costume. i had to miss halloween last year cus i was all in recoveryness but this year i will not be if all goes well and it will be good! and spooky. i need to go to a graveyard...random i know but i dont really care cus no one reads these anyways. well i must go and eat before the headache monster comes and eats me. hey what's that thing out your window? It looks funny. lol bye!"

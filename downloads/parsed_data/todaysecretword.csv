But anyway, not the point. I just wanted t give anyone reading this an update on my life. I move out. Yep, I'm on my own. I moved in with david, cause his dad moved out to 'find work upstate'. I really have no idea what he's doing up there.... besides getting drunk a lot and bringin down some bangin weed to sell, which bothers me none, because now I don't have to drive to get it. But besides that, I'm realy liking living on my own. It was really hard at first to get used to, being without my family. I was in bad shape for a few days. But I'm doin great now, and I love that when I come home I'm sitting on my couch, and when I drive it's in my car, and it just feels awesome to own everything that I own, even if it isn't the fanciest thing in the world. 

But yeah. Wanna smoke a bong sometime? my cell's always on."

"event","I was watching the daily show today before I went to work and they mentioned that some were considering legalizing marijuana to help jumpstart the economy. Now, you all should know, that I do enjoy the benefits of a good toke, and although I've though before that this is what I wanted, I thught about it today and something about it just seemed unsettling. as I was thinking about it I realized that it seems that when we go through a serious economic downturn, we legalize something. after the great depression we ended prohibition, and now there's discussion of weed. I love weed, don't get me wrong, but it seems there might be a trend going. so far, there hasn't been anything of real harm legalized, but if there's another downturn in 40 or 50 years will they unleash something of actual harm? I mean, anything can cause harm in the wrong hands, that's why weed gets such a bad rep, but what if they legalize something that's just bad all around? there's a lot of cocaine goin' around illegally, but does that mean the government should legalize it and ignore the many downfalls for a couple million dollars? I don't know, the government just doesn't sit right with me anymore. it's all about money, and people don't understand how it works and that they really have nothing to do with the economy and can only do so much to control it, but they expect the government to do everything for them. honestly I think the problem is that we've just gotten too big. I personally think we break into 2 different but cooperative countries and try to work out the power. but only revolution can bring that on and everyone's too stupid and lazy. not that I don't love the US, but there's only so much a government can control before it becomes too much. I'm totally into that idea, as long as washington doesn't end up onthe commy- socialist side of the break, I'm fine.

One of my favorite memories will always be my father, driving the rv, singing Kelly Clarkson. But anyway, I had fun. We did a lot of shopping. I met a woman who lived in Montreal, but used to live in England. And she had a miiiiighty cute son. I dragged my mom, rob and cathy all over maine, looking for yarn shops(most of which turned out to not exist) and got some really nice yarn for a hat and mittens I'm gonna make. Did I mention that I have the hottest jacket ever? Cause I do. I love it. But ummm. I went to a carnival. Went on a crazy ride. Then I went to the beach with my mom, and now my enire backside is all burned. It was really bad yesterday, today it's a lot better. Tomorrow it'll be nothin. I got the new Vogue Kniting, and I love it. I haven't gotten to read it all yet, but I will. I hung out with Lauren S. and Davey today after I helped unpack things. It was nice, I haven't hung out with either of them in like, forever. We chilled, and after Davey went home me and Lauren both drank a tab, and her mom gave her pajama pants with stars on them, so we both kept going up to Erika(who was chillin with Beverly) and dance and went 'WOOO! SPACE PANTS! SPACE PANTS!' and talked about Harrison Ford.

It rained a lot of the time, which was a bummer because I really wanted to go to the beach, but hopefully I will soon. We got home at like, 11:30 last night, and I didn't get to bed until like, 1 this morning. I guess I slept through my alarm and my dad got really pissed because he couldn't yell at me to wake me up this morning because I locked my door last night. I couldn't help it, I was mad last night, and I lock the door when I'm mad. Don't ask, I don't even understand. I got to lunch second period, and I kinda wish I just hadn't gone at all. School is so stupid these days. Photography was good, though. My film came out, even though it's a little too light. But hey, I was sitting there scared that it hadn't come out at all, so as long as here's some pictures there, I'm good. I hung out with Erika after school, and then went to work. I had a good time at work, and I'm prety chill right now. I've been thinking all afternoon about how I have to and was going to do my homework, but now I'm not gonna.

I'm just gonna hope for snow? So yeah. Laury came. Nick didn't. I wasn't expecting him to. But I got really excited when I saw laury. She drove me home and it was good. and then James came over. Oh man, I love that boy. We had such a good time. I didn't think we would, but we did and it was amazing. He brouht the tv edition Scene It, just so we could play with the dvd and just not care about the actual game. He brought the game and forgot the dvd. And he also brought yummy things to eat. We decided we had a sitcom, and that the first episode would get the best reviews ever, and the rest would get shit reviews. Our first guest if gonna be Jesus. Them Moses. Then Erika. And we talked about Chris being a scumbag, and lost of other things. Oh and by the way, my sister myspace-messaged her asking about the whole chris thing and part of what Gina said was 'I know abou Chris kissing Kerri but I decided to give him a second chance(uhmm... did he tell her? Or did she find out through someone else? And if he did, how MUCH did he tell her?) And I'm not mad at her.' Ha. Haha. HAHAHA. She's not mad at me? I'm sorry, I wasn't really worrieed about that. Because she really wouldn't have a reason to be mad at ME. Chris is the scumbag, not me.

But anyway, so I went to work this morning very upset because no one can keep their hands off the fucking thermoses. And even worse, when I ask them if they've done anything with them, apparently no one touches them. Amazing. Faggots. but I went to work, and then I walked around with mand after I got out, until laury picked us up. We went outside by FYE, and then came back inside, and I started to dance, and while I was dancing I happened to look into Gertrude Hawk and see Nick Knibbs, who looked at me at the same fuckin' instant. So I oddly enough turned around and started walking away, and tried to make manda come with me, but she was in a crazy state of mind today, and when I told her what happened, she just turned around and walked into Gertrude Hawk. And then I followed behind her, looking like dirt, and she talked to him for like three minutes, took my cell, walked to the entrance and turned around and said 'Oh, she saw you in here and was shy, so she walked away. So I made her come back to see you' at which point I wanted to stab her. But I stood there and talked to him about how she was like.... stoned or something. OMG! BEST PART! When we first came in, I asked him 'So where were you last night Nick? Not at my concert? That's where yu weren't. Because you like to break my heart.' and he went 'I'm so sorry, Kerri' and leaned in to hug me, so I leaned over the counter and we hugged, and he kissed me on the cheek!!!! EEP! *girlish moment* So while my head was like, making a weird sound of delight, manda decides to say 'AWWWW. Do you like her?' And she didn't get to say anymore. Because I beat her and said 'SHUT UUUP!' I'm pretty sure I was like, beat red.  

Yeah. Pretty much made my day.

And then we went with laury to my house, where I changed clothes and gave laury her birthday present. It was a book of Evangelian artwork. She loved it. And then we took the puppy to the park, where I chased him around for like, an hour. Without a coat, which drove manda nuts, because she was fuckin freezing, but she always is. It was fun. But my lungs hurt after a while. That dog has way too much energy *sigh*. It was still fun. and then we went back to my house, and I sat on manda's feet in an attempt to make them warm(which apparently didn't work) and then laury left and manda ate sausage and peppers with my family. Barry got mad because ally pointed out the fact that anytime barry says something. it usually has to do with drugs. And the use of them. Because he's fuckin retarded. And then I had to clean up from dinner, and then me and Manda chilled in my room then manda went home. And now I'm just chillin. I don't want to get up tomorrow. I hope we have a snow day. Then I'll call up nick and just be like 'Yo muthafucka we chill?' Except I'm definately not gonna do that.

I had a dream last night where Chris kissed me. And then my cousin. And I cut off his penis and raped him with it. There were no extreme details. But enough to get the point across to me. It was a good horrible dream, y'know what I mean? Because I'm pretty sure Char's the only one who really understands how much I hate him right now. Well, maybe manda too, considering I called her up and screamed at her about it at the top of my lungs, and then was shaking while I told her about it. I dunno."

I woke up this morning because my brother let the dog outo f his crate and decided no to watch him. So, Captain came to my room, instead. And sat on my head. And bit anything he could get his mouth around. So I got up, and watched Life Aquatic with Steve Sizzou. At least, I think it's Sizzou. Maybe it's Zissou. I dunno. It was a pretty good movie. There was this one song in there, by a band called the Zombies. I liked the words. Then I made coffee, but I had to go grocery shopping with my parents. I didn't enjoy it. My dad has been making nasty sarcastic comments about smiles towards me. Because, y'know, making fun of me when I'm depressed is gonna make me soooo much happier, right? Whatever. I got free cookies. And a half pound of roast beef. The lady who helped us behind the deli counter was Alfie's mom. I don't think she recognized me. Good thing. I got home and made jello. Jello and coffee are about the only things I can keep down. I went sledding with Manda. It really cheered me up. It was the most fun I've had all week. That's not really saying much, but at least it's saying something. I kept stealing her snowboard, because it was less stupid than mine. I came home and I watched Scarface. It was awesome, I loved it. It's a messed up movie, though. Amy's friend showed up about 16 minutes efore the end though, but I couldn't watch the end for like, an hour. I promised Amy I'd pay for the pizzas for her parties. My mom told me to get 6 large pies. 91 dollars. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. So I got 4. and 2 dozen garlic knots. it was like, 70 buck. Holy shit. She's lucky I love her. She doesn't even appreciate it, the little bitch. She didn't even say thank you. She was just a snot. But whatever. I finished watching Scarface, and then I started Walk the Line. But my mom called me down to eat birthday cake. I sang happy birthday. But amy's friend make me want to vomit more than I already want to. So I came back upstairs, and now I'm watching Walk the Line. It's pretty good. I've never heard Johnny Cash before, so it's cool.


All this time I spend alone leaves my mind wandering back to Alfie. And I'd be lying if I said I'm not always half hoping that he'll come up to me, and tell me that he's sorry and that he didn't mean it. On friday, I walked out of work, and I looked around for him. I don't know why I thought he'd actually want me back after he knows how good life is without me. I guess I'd be lying if I said this whole keeping food down things wasn't because I'm stupidly, ridiculously depressed about this. He recorded(video) himself playing a song he wrote for me. At least, I'm pretty sure he told me it was for me. And every time he looked at the fucking camera, I wanted to bust into tears all over again. I have work tomorrow. I can't be this stupid when I work."

Part of me hopes that he'll change his mind, and want me still. The other part of me keeps saying that there's no way he'd want me after he knows what life could be without me. It's amazing though, because when we were whatever we were, I couldn't say anything about how I felt about him. Now that he doesn't want me, all I'm talking about is how much  I like him, and how I'm mad at him because he did this. But I'm not mad. I'm just hoping he'll see me hurting and change his mind. Kind of a really immature, selfish way to go about things. I guess I can't help it. It's not like it wasn't there before, it's just that... I dunno. I didn't have to talk about it. I thought I knew what was going on. I guess I'm jus too boring. I keep saying that he didn't do this and he didn't do that, even though he said he did. But it's my fault. When you get right down to it, it's my fault. I didn't do enough for him. I'm being so ridiculous about this. I feel sick. I just want to go back to when he was happy, because I told him that I wouldn't have to watch a chick flick, but he would have to watch the Godfather with me."

I said something that was apparently stupid around you guys. I won't do it again. The only people who heard me were gramps and my father. My dad flipped out on me and told me to apologize and tried to make me feel guilty and pretty much called me an asshole. Whatever. And then I apologized to Gramps and he said he accepted the apology but I know he didn't and he just did that grandfather thing where you know you've dissapointed him and I never meant to do that! I never meant that at all! But he just said he accepted the apology and said I should think before I speak and continued to stare at my plate. My grandfather's my favorite person in the world and the fact that I keep dissapointing him hurt so much so I just went to my bathroom and cried for a couple minutes. But that's not enough, they told grammy and mommy, too. So now all the adults are pissed at me, and barry came in here in an attempt to find out what I said and tried to give me a lecture. I flat out told him that I didn't need or want a lecture and to get out of my room. And Rob probably knows, so he'll come up here trying to give me a lecture, and when I don't want to listen we'll start yelling at each other and he'll scream that I'm a stupid bitch and then my dad will get involved and yell at us and I'll ahve to apologize to my grandparents again and I'll get more lectures. 

God damn! My family's drama is so god damn predictable. So my mom went to rehab? It happened. We can't pretend it didn't. It's not gonna go away. And the fact that we never talk about it drives me up a FUCKING WALL. I can't talk about it with any of my friends because I won't open my fucking mouth and now it's taboo around my family? I'm gonna go insane. Fucking insane.

My alarm didn't go off. So i woke up on my own at 6:23 and looked at my alarm clock like WTF YOU STUPID SLUT! So I took this super quick shower, and got ready, but still not quick enough. I had to get a band aid because of this cut on the back of my ankle. That took way too long. On the way down to the bus stop, the bus passed us. So we ran halfway to out bus stop. And I looked pretty ridiculous, I'm told. I was holding my hoody pocket in one hand, and my bookbag in the other. But whatever. Uta apologized for not seeing us as she passed, and I told her it was my fault. Fuckin alarm clock. Anyway. I don't know what is abou Chris lately, but everything he does is wrong. So I just sat in the bus seat, listening to my music and feeling completely miserable and isolated. I got to school and my mood didn't really change. I kinda really feel left out of everything. I hate it so much. But I'm so busy. I'd try to make time, if someone called me once in a while to let me know what's going on... Whatever. I'm being a whiney bitch. So, I went through the school day and I came home and cut my foot open stepping on glass in the basement. Apparently, the people in my family are so fucking lazy, that when they realize that there's glass on the floor, we can't be bothered enough to sweep it up. Because I wasn't the first person to cut their foot on a piece of glass. Whatever. When I got home, I drank apple cider, and then I went running. I ran to the end of my road, stopped, turned aorund, and ran halfway back. I died as I reached my driveway. So I went inside, and I curled up in the recliner in the living room(several times. I was interrupted for things, like feeding the cats. Where I cut my foot.) And I started to read my term paper book, but Loki jumped up on the recliner and sat on my stomach, so I put the book away, and lay back in the recliner. I almsot fell asleep like, 5 times, but I was really cold. I only had one sock on, from when I was wiping blood off my toe. So Ally was nice enough to bring me a blanket, and I had a 2 hour nap. It was a good nap. But when I woke up, the sun was setting, and I realized that I still had yet to do my photo project. SO jackiebear met up with me, and we went down to the park and we took a few shots. But there wasn't enough light after that. So we went back to my house, where I had mushy rice and yummy boneless ribs. Jack left just in time for my dad to go on a big rant about how things are slow at work, so we had to cut back on a lot of things. ANd how we needed to help out around the house,because my parents want to have thanksgiving at our house. Barry was a bitch throughout the whole thing. And then that went on, and amy and I cleaned up from dinner and I came upstairs and started doing my history essay. I don't remember if it's due tomorrow, so I caled up Peter and asked him. He wasn't in school today, so we had this 15 minute conversation which was just basically trying to figure out how I could get out of handing in the essay tomorrow, if it needed to be turned in, with detours about his hating me, me being a slut, my self image, Mr. Lisberg, and him not going to school today. But mostly him not going to school and him hating me. And now I'm here. Procrastinating on doing my essay."

"event","Word, sucka. So. Last night, I spent about 2 hours cleaning my kitchen. It all started with me cleaning the cookie pans that we used to make cookies(duh.) I looked around the counters, and thought 'Well, as long as I'm cleaning these, I should clean those.' So I finished cleaning a whole bunch of kitchen things, and then looked at the island and decided to wipe that down. And there's no point in wiping down the island if you're not going to do the reast of the counters. And we got a bunch of stuff on the floor, so I might as well sweep. If I'm gonna sweep, I'll just vacumm afterwards, to pick up the stuff I didn't get with the broom. And Mum's been wanting the floor to get mopped..... I still have to wipe down the front of the cabinets from last summer...


BTW, that was my thought process, as I didn't each thing. Haha. My parents came home and were like 'Uhh?' and then it turned into my dad going ""COOKIES! OH MAN! YOU KIDS ARE THE BEST!' And my mom thanked me for cleaning he kitchen without being asked. And I'm not one to toot my own horn, but... TOOT TOOT! The kitchen looks awesome. That's right. I'm amazing. Haha. And then I asked my mom if I could chill with Burrito today at his house, she said no to before I even got to finish he question. I didn't protest. I just told her she was being irrational about this and then went upstairs. Apparently my dad thought so also, because he told her so. Haha. So now I'm aloud to chill with Burrito. AND! I'm also hanging with Char and JT today!!! We're gonna watch muppet Treasure Island and I'm getting coffee ice cream and bringing poopcorn and Char has things with which you make cookies! Yayy! I can't wait!!! I still have to finish cleaning my room so I can go, but I'll get it done. Right now, I'm eating a cup o' noodles. Roast chicken is a good flavor. That's right bitches. I'm eating my cup o' noodles, WITH chopsticks, RIGHT UPSTAIRS IN MY ROOM! WITH NO CONSEQUENCE! BECAUE MY PARENTS AREN'T HOME! BUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. ..... Okay. I'm done. I'm a little excited."

I would've fuckin made sure he was dead in a week. Or at least bleeding profusely. I would've loved it. I could imagine it now. My family makes me wanna fucking die. No wonder I have such bad fucking self esteem. I have all I need right around me to make sure there's someone telling me anything bad about myself."

"event","What's up, Vanilla face? I'm just chillin. Okay, first thing's first. I submitted a new photo to my deviantart account. (which, btw, is http://agentdoubleohzero.deviantart.com/  Check out my gallery if you'd like. Don't look at the poems, haha) I got Photoshop, and basically don't know how to do shit with it. I've pretty much just been playing with it all day. I figured out how to makes borders on my pictures. It's cool.  Second order of business. CELIA'S GOING CAMPING WITH ME! YAYYYY! I can't wait! I'm so excited for this weekend now! I hope she has fun. I always get really scared when I hang out with people that I don't see that often at all (Tim, Jhesse, Dianna, Char along with others) I dunno. I guess I'm just afraid that I'm not interesting enough. I'm always afraid I'll bore them.People would probably say that I'm an awesome person and that I'm really cool and interesting, but... Eh. I just get on edge. But, whatever. I'm excited about seeing Celia! I can't wait! Did I salready say that? Whatever. I don't care. I'm excited. Woot! Okay, third. I got a new photo-editing program. JT told me to get it, because he loves it, so I figured I'd give it a try. I don't know really how to work with it, but I'll play with it tomorrow. I'm sneezing far too much to work with it right now. I didn't do any of my homework this weekend. At least I fixed my english paper for Passudetti. Eh...I guess I should do Lisberg's worksheet.... I'll think about it. I'm goin to bed. I <3 all my friends, even if I do crazy nervous when we chill, haha. G'night."

"event","I'm watching Family Guy. I'm glad I'm home.... And showered. And in clean clothes. You'd think I wouldn't miss it so much, but since I can't really smell that well, I'm always paranoid that I smell like shit. But whatever. I have posted since like, wednesday... What's happened since then? Bullshit. Well, not all of it. Thursday, I went to school, came hung, chilled with Chris a little, watched Lost. I went on the computer, talked to Char. I'm sorry I upset you Char. I'm not gonna do it. I don't want you upset, especially not over something I did. But yeah. I drove up to Whitehall with my mom, amy, and barry on friday. It was pretty fun. I played Pokemon(Silver Version) for about three hours.... And then my brother deleted my profile. Dumb bitch. He said that it was his game, he could do what he wanted. I told him that it wasn't his game, I bought it off of a friend. That shut him up. I met my great aunt. Well, I've met her before, but this time we actually visited her and spent time with her, instead of just saying hi at a family gathering. She just got a daschund. He's got a sweet face, buthe's not photogenic at all.... and he never stops MOVING. He's nuts, dude. But I had a fun time at Aunt Jo Ann's house. She has a very nice home. She invited me to stay with her, but I could never.... mainly because she has dial up. No way. Get out of my house. But she was really nice. She looks like my great grandmother and acts like my grandfather. Except my grandfather can generally talk and keep his car driving ON THE ROAD. I hate that show the War at Home. Or whatever. It's stupid. The parents are so easy to manipulate. Idiots. Anyway. So, my aunt jo anne. She's really cool. She made us really good cookies, and good food, and she even gave me a camera. I'm not sure it's going to work for my class, but it was really nice of her anyhow. We didn't even get to see the baloons go up. It was always too windy. Eh. I had fun anyhow. I emailed the people at the humane's society. They're freggin idiots over there, and can't answera question. But I had fun this weekend. Apparently bra sizes go up to K..... wtf? Whatever. We got home this afternoon at like... 12:30. I did shit, and cleaned my room, and then Chris showed up, so we chilled. We took turned playing Mario 64, and then dan caled and was like YO SUCKA. So, we went to the mall and chilled with Dan, and then drove around with him. He almost killed us like, twice. And we were listening to Kyle Cease the whole time. Because I bought his new CD. It's amazing. Hahaha. And then I came home and I took a shower! Yay! Apparently, Japan's made a robotic butler. It's looks exactly and acts exactly like a human, so they say. I wouldn't know. I've so got a craving for chinese food. Oh well. I'm sorry this was such a boring journal entry. Maybe I'll have better stuff for you tomorrow."

"event","I had a pretty good day. School was alright. I had fun during lunch. And photography. I was kinda pleh on the bus, but Chris is stupid. Es not my fault! I got over it pretty quickly though. I chilled with Erika for a while. We watched the last two episodes of Weeds and then we watched CCP Kyle Cease. And now she loves him. Because he's fucking AMAZING. Oh yeah, while I was there, I found out the name of that adorable guy I keep seeing around school. His name is John.... Dougherty. He's fucking Adorable. At least, I think that's his name, I could've been looking at the wrong picture, but I doubt it. So, if any of you wonderful people who read this journal know who he is, you should talk to him one day, and then see me and grab me and drag me over an introduce me. Just be like 'This is Kerri. She thinks you're adorable. Now go in the closet.' Except.... DOn't do that. Anyway. I came home and my mom was being freggin stupid. She was looking around the kitchen like a maniac, looking for some book that she needed for an AA meeting. And then she started yelling because she could never find what she needed when she needed it, and it was my dad's fault because he had her put everything in boxes(3 years ago?) and she cna't figure out a filng system. Whatever. Well, I found the book for her(It was in her room, where she hadn't bothered to look) and then she thanked me. And then started yelling about how no one ever does anything when she asks them to. So I came up in my room and convinced Hussie not to beat up some kid. And then I told him to talk about what was wrong, and that wasn't a very good idea. Because it ended up with him like, begging me to date him, and I won't do that.  So he went and wrestled with his brothers and I talked to Kenny, about perverted things. Because really, that's all that Kenny's interested in. But whateva, it's cool. I've been messing around with my mp3 player all afternoon, trying to make it so I don't have to navigate around the damn thing for 5 minutes just to listen to one song. I'm not done yet. But I'm gettin there. I'll finish it tomorrow. Oh shit. I didn't do my math homework. Did I? I don't think so. I didn't do my chem homework either.... if we had any.... I'll go do that. 



OH YEAH! Apparently, Tim doesn't hate me, regardless to what I sometiems think. I'm still not too sure about Jhesse, but I'll cross that bridge when I get to it. So Tim, combined with Dianna and Char, made my day. I love my friends."

"event","That's a quote from my summer reading book that I was reading during work today. I don't really want to talk all that much about work, except that we didn't order from Quizno's today. And that at random times I'd write down facts that I've learned about myself over the past few weeks. I'll put them here.

1. I'm a hypochondriac. Is that how you spell it? Oh well.
2. I'm too selfish to not wear my heart on my sleeve.
3. From time to time, I get scared to death that my friends really don't like me. (Jhesse, Cody, Tim, to name a few. It happens with a wide variety of friends)
4. I'd look terrible as a blonde.
5. I try to be nice to everyone, no matter how much I want to punch them in the face. Sometiems I slip a little.
6. A lot of my fears stem from my fear of people not liking me.
7.For the first time in sixteen years, I like myself. And I'm super paranoid that something will come along to break it, just like any time there was a hint of this.
8. If I grew up to have less than I do now, I don't think I'd be any less happy.
9. Sometimes when I walk around school, I see these people, and I have no idea who they are, but I have this deep hatred for them.
10. My hobby is sitting in my room. I'm trying to find a new hobby. 
11. I don't think that I'm ready to be in the relationship.... I just don't really know why yet.
12. When I get really into something, my face turns bright red. And even I like to make fun of myself over it.
13. I like the way I dress, even though a lot of people don't(or so I'm told).
14. I've said I don't like things that I know nothing about just to get into arguements. With people I like.
15. Sometimes I'm afraid that I don't know who my best friend is anymore.
16. I'm very oblivious.
17. I like my hair. and eyes. and mouth. Just not my skin.


Yeah... I'm just shy of 20. I guess I'll think of them later. Or someone could give me a fact about me. I dun care. I kinda don't feel good(in different ways) so I'm gonna go to bed. My parents keep asking me what's wrong. Pleh."

"event","I'm feeling GOOD about myself. Like, I'm starting to think I'm not ugly, but more than decent, I guess. Maybe it's just a summer thing, and when school comes around, my confidence will go back to zero, but I'm just trying to enjoy it. Maybe it won't go away. Maybe I'm changing for the better. That'd be nice. But whatever. My summer is boring, but I saw Timmy for the first time all summer last night. It was fun. Wish I could see some of my other friends. Chris is no longer a friend. He's like, part of my family. It's weird. I see the kid like, almost every day. I'm not sure I like that. Maybe that will change too, when it comes time for school. Oh wells!"

"event","So, today was interesting. Went to work, and was pissed at Chris like, every other minute. For reasons that are my own, thank you very much. Mary thought it was ridiculous that I had to buy my own camera for photography class. I guess at the school that she teaches at, they give the students cameras. I came home and took a shower, and then I ate a piece of bread on my way to the mall to meet people on a secret mission. Shhhh. I'm not teling what. But we walked around at different stores and tried on different outfits, and I found a few that I really liked. Like, I really liked them. But, I couldn't get them at that moment, I need them to stay there for the project. But I might just buy them when I can. Who knows? Oh well. After that, barry and I wandered around a little while more and I got Mango a black guy's button up shirt, two packages of boxers, an incense burner with incense that I picked out and knew would be crappy, because I'm not good at smelling so I couldn't tell if they smelld good or not, and a pack of gum. I wanted to get her weed, but I don't have a dealer, and I wanted to get her a sketchbook, but I couldn't go to AC MOORE because barry couldn't wait to come home and play his damn video game. But I came home, and I read for a little while, because I was gonna go visit mango and give her her gifts after dinner. Well, I was on my way down and called to make sure Mango was ther. SHe wasn't but joe said she'd be home soon and would tell her that I'd called. So, I waited around in the park for like, an hour and did nothing but worked on a flower bouquet. I don't know why. I didn't even plan on giving it to anyone, I just made one to pass the time. But after an hour, I called back and mango said that she was going out to dinner with her family and that she couldn't hang out and that I should've come down earlier. Not in a mean way, just... in a way. So, now I'm sitting in my room and typing this. And all I can think about is how I want ice cream, because it keeps my mind off of feeling like a failure. I don't know why I feel like a failure, I just do. Does that really matter? And my parents wonder what's wrong, and I just tell them that I'm bored because I don't want to tell them that I feel like a failure. Because they'd tell me I wasn't a failure. But, I don't think that would make me feel better. I think we have ice cream downstairs. I gonna go eat some, though they've already eaten my favorite flavor. Not really the best of days for me, although I think I got some really good pictures of the collies."

"event","Oh snap, son. I haven't had a livejournal since like, 8th grade. I think it was eigth grade, anyway. My parents made me get rid of it, and made me promise not to get another one. I was never one to keep my promises anyway. Not unless they were important, and I kept that promise really long, considering it was a freggin bullshit promise. Whuteva. I had to work with my brother at Mrs. Robischon's house today. I don't think he enjoyed himself, either. Oh well. Chris says he's going to go tomorrow. Buuuut.... Chris is a fuckin liar. So, we'll see how that works. I came home AND I WASHED MY HAIR! =000000 Oh man. I don't think it's actually been clean in a long time. I mean, I've washed it, but afterwards, I'd put crap in it to make it like, curly and stuff. Cause if I do that for like, a week, then it looks really nice, even after I stop putting it in. So I've been like, amazed all day with the softness of my hair, so I can't stop touching it. And I'd randomly exclaim about how soft it was. I think people at the fashion club thing were annoyed with me about that. I didn't care. I had ice cream. It wasn't chocolate chip cookie dough like I wanted it to be. It was moose tracks, and that's okay, because it has fudge in it. But for the first time in my life, I ruined my dinner."

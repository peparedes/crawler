"event","Mirry and I have been going out for Four days now. We pay the price at night. No quiet cuddling or love making for us. No.

After fifteen years of no sex, my first chance, and something always comes up.

Bloody clinic. I never wished to be elsewhere till now."

"event","I've been looking over the list on new patients. On the peg board, across from me, are the names of those I've met, along with what little I know about them. There's only one person up there so far. Viggo. I look at the other peg boards, keeping track of other patients. Some with photos, most without. Keeps my mind active so I know and can keep track. A sort of filing system.

I'm usually better at meeting the new patients on arrival, but the newst ones arrived while I was gone. I call it on holiday, but it was a sort of recovery for me.

It's odd.....no one ever really asks for my story. Why I'm here. And the few that do never probe beyond my flippiant answers. But they all notice the knee. The knee I refuse to have fixed. I've figured, if patients see that I'm not perfect, they won't take things so hard. They'll trust me more, I'm jsut as imperfect as they are. But I havn't really seen any of the new ones.

I've seen my usuals. Those who seek me out for a bit of comfort. A pat on the back. Someone who will believe in them longer after everyone else gives up. That's me. The guy everyone turns to. So who do I turn to?

This entry isn't making any sense. I don't know why, sometimes, I continue to bother writing in it. Old habits I suppose.

I should make an effort.....more of one anyway. Perhaps I'll drop by Mirry's office later. See how she is."

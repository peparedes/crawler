It seems like facebook keeps telling me people are getting engaged/having babies.  I feel way too young and it is weird to believe that kids I went to elementary school with are ""old"" enough.

I go to Charlotte tomorrow to work the Neil Diamond concert.  I am very excited.  I absolutley love concerts.  The enviroment and live performances is absolutely amazing."

"event","A year has passed since I last posted on LJ.  I don't really know why I decided to write again.  I take that back.  Perhaps I do.  I read or heard or somehow got this idea in my head that blogging is supposed to be the ""thing"" to do.  I always looked at it as a way to put what is happening in one's life down on paper or in this case type it on the computer. 

 I've also heard keeping a blog is a good thing for journalists to do, which reminds me that I had to post a news story I wrote for class on blogspot.  It's not like I would post a personal blog and then use that as a writing sample for job applications.  ""Here Mr. Recruiter is a link to my personal blog.  Read all about me.""  


I guess writing on this blog will help clear the air.  I have spent the past 3 months in Salt Lake City interning and living with my brother.  It has been a great experience career wise and to get to really KNOW my brother.  It has also been extremely difficult.  This is the first time in my life I have really been ALONE for a period of time.  I  have always had friends wherever I have gone.  Out here, I started fresh with no friends.  While I enjoy spending time with my brother and his friends and also occasionally hang out with some other people, I do not have any ""true"" kindred spirits out here.  

Perhaps this is a time to reflect on how my life has been thus far and how it will change a year from now.  I may start completely over next summer with a job somewhere where I know noone.  This may be practice for that.

On a brighter more upbeat note, my internship with a concert promoter is pretty kickass.  I am getting to work concerts and see A List celebrities on a regular basis.  (well C list too if you count Justin Guarini lol.)

I feel better now.  Hopefully I can make posting on this priority on a regular basis."

Right now I am at Ronald McDonald House.  Last night I went shoe and apartment stuff shopping with my mommy.  My apartment isn't gonna be perfectly ready when I move in; however, it will be AMAZING!  I am soooo excited.  I am getting my bedding, curtains, and shower curtain made; so, they won't be ready.  I am getting this searsucker comforter to do in the meantime.  I bought these really cool pictures yesterday and am just really excited about my apartment.

I turn 20 in about a month which is tres exciting.  I will no longer be a teenager (GASP!).

Next weekend is the Big Scoop Ice cream festival for Ronald McDonald House.  I have been working and spending a tremendous amount of time on it.  Hopefully it will be a success.  

My brother and his girl friend come in town tomorrow.

The weekend after Big Scoop in Nashville and JOHN MAYER!!!!  Big yay for that!   That following Monday is JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE!!!  I then move into my apartment (August 11th).

Basically this summer is wrapping up quite nicely, and I am very stoked about what is to come."

From 4-7 today there is a dinner/awards thing at the aquatic center for all rec center employees.  Free dinner is pretty cool; so, I'm excited.  

After that I work from 6-9 where I am going to study and then go spend the night in the library.  Get excited.  This will be one exciting night.  Not.  

Hopefully I will do well on my finals.

I have a feeling I am going to repack again and perhaps again.  I am just a terrible packer.  I never have things that match, and I never pack what I need.  That is why I decided to pack a lot of stuff so that I wouldn't be in that situation.  Then I was reminded I needed to room to bring everything I buy back to the U.S.

"event","tvguide.com has a really nice look back at the history of the O.C.  I think it is good it is ending tonight, but this season has been really good.  This is the 3rd show that I have really really loved that is ending for me.  Roswell ended followed by Dawson's Creek.  Dawson's Creek ended in May, and that August the O.C. premiered.  The O.C. was the answer to what was I going to watch since Dawson's ended.  It came at a great time for me, and if teens weren't so fickle and didn't give up so easily, perhaps it would still be airing.  Things aren't that way, and I say farewell to the O.C.  I think tonight's episode will be good since we are promised everyone in the O.C. will be happy, and all loose ends will be tied up.  Yay for that!  I'm going to get a pint of Ben and Jerry's and watch the O.C. tonight happily.  Screw you, Grey's Anatomy!  I'm watching you online later.  

John Mayer announced today that he is extending his Continuum tour.  CD sales have increased 180% since the Grammy's resulting it to be on the top 10 cd selling charts this week.  Yay for that!  Anyways he is touring this summer, and I will be going to see him August 3rd in Nashville.  Yay for that as well!

"event","So I know it's the new CW...I get that.  I've also noticed WB shows are on it, but today I just found an article talking about the end of the WB.  Apparently in September for it's final day, the WB showed pilots of its best shows.  It also showed highlights of it's career.  The pilots shown were Buffy, Angel, Felicity, and it ended with Dawson's Creek.

Apparently Entertainment Weekly also had a countdown with the best WB moments.  Number 1 was when Buffy killed Angel (my favorite Buffy episode...haha!) and when Felicity cut her hair, and Dawson declared his love for Katie Couric.  It also had when people sent in tobasco to try and save Roswell.  

Me finding this article brought back so many memories of my favorite tvs and tv show moments!"

"event","So the following is my away message on AIM:

""I'm loving that Grey's won best tv drama

...however I am once again reminded that Grey's is partially at fault for the demise of the o.c.  

it may be the o.c.'s time, but this really is a great season, and noone seems to notice because Grey's is sooo big.

Kudos to the o.c. for poking fun at Grey's.  They deserve it.""

To continue with that, the o.c. has always been able to make of itself, and it had no chance this season.  FOX was completely stupid to not move it to a different time slot.  FOX also did a bad job at promos.

So while my tv loving heart is now with Grey's (esp. after the series finale of the o.c. in February), I am about to lose a show that has been very dear to me.  

I haven't lost a show in awhile. I believe Buffy was the last one, but to be honest I didn't stick with Buffy and Angel to the end.  I guess for the shows I stuck with beginning to end, my last was Dawson's Creek.  That ended in 10th grade.  It's been awhile for me, and I love the o.c. I love that season Josh Schwartz was set to make a quality season instead of just giving into quantity and hype and the pressures of being a primetime television show.


....

On a different note but still on tv and having to do with Grey's, I'd like to say Patrick Dempsey looked very yummmy tonight.  

Ellen Pompeo looked very nice as well.  I do not think she is particularly beautiful on Grey's, but I thought she looked really nice tonight.

I bet that cast is gonna have a good night.  haha.

...

So I am on this exercise kick.  It's the first time in a long time that I really have been serious about being fit.

I saw Dr. Ian (from Celebrity Fit Club) earlier today.  Katie Stokes, Nicole German, and I went.  

I am really wanting to get my life together this semester.  I'm really wanting to work hard on ME.  I want to be introspective and work on my major and my career goals.  I also want to do really well in school and become engaged in my classes.  


I'd like to also make some new friends.  You can never have too many friends.  I'd also like to get more involved on campus and really discover who I am and have more to do.

I guess this has been a really serious entry.  Wow."

First Day of High School: ""Perfect Time of Day"" by Howie Day.  I don't even know what to say about this...

Breaking Up: ""Virgin State of Mind"" by K's Choice on the Buffy soundtrack.  Interesting choice for breaking up...

Prom: ""I'm Gonna Make you Love me"" by the Jayhawks.  It is off of the Dawson's Creek soundtrack.

First Day of College: ""Come Lay Down"" by Howie Day.  hmmm...there tends to be lots of sleepovers/crashing in college.  Does that work a little?

Mental Breakdown: ""Lucky"" by Bif Naked also on the Buffy soundtrack.  It's weird I don't seem to be getting a large range of music.

Road Trip Across America: ""Cannonball"" by Damien Rice

Getting Back Together: ""Man on the Side"" by John Mayer.  This is one of my absolute favorite John Mayer songs.  haha.

College Graduation: ""London Rain"" by Heather Nova.  This is also from the Dawson's Creek soundtrack.  I have almost 2000 songs on my itunes, and all I get are  the same artists/soundtracks over and over.  weird. 

Wedding:""Trouble"" by Coldplay.  If that was my wedding song, I think my marriage would be doomed from the start.

Birth of Child: ""Standing in the Sun"" by Howie Day

Career: ""Holiday in Spain"" by the Counting Crows.  I am jealous of your's, Emily.  ""Money Maker"" totally fits for this one, and I am jealous.

Final Battle: ""Cirlce of Life"" from the Lion King.  Hmm...interesting.

Death Scene: ""The Blower's Daughter"" by Damien Rice  Hm...did I die from doing too much blow?  kididng!

Funeral Scene: ""Perfect Blue Buildings"" Yet another Counting Crows song. 

End Credits: ""Omaha"" - hmm... Counting Crows again.


dunno what I think of my results from this game.  Anyways...very excited about my John Mayer tickets.  They got sent to my mom yesterday; so, I get to get them next week.  yay!"

"event","I love how the O.C. can make fun of itself.  Like saying that Summer's dad got a job in Seattle at this quirky Hospital Seatle  Grace.  It's like the writers knew Grey's Anatomy would be the death of the O.C.  It's like theyre writing quality writing because they are no longer being pushed like crazy by FOX....its sweet and it sucks because of the reasons i mentioned in the last one.

i actually cried in this week's thanksgiving episode.  i dont remember the last time the o.c. made me cry, but it did this week.  probably mostly because the writing and acting and the scenes in general were really good---but partially because im realizing it's ending.  

speaking of which i do really love grey's anatomy.  ill admit i watched it on thursday.  i didnt want to. i  wanted to watch the oc, but i watched greys.  i like that meredith and derek kissed at the end.  i do love that show. 

so excited that john mayer extended his tour.  i wsa really upset i didnt get to see him in nashville or atlanta with sheryl crow, but he is gonna be in both memphis and knoxville in february.  tickets went on sale this morning, and i woke up to get buy them.  my friend and i have seats on the floor---holla!
that is wayyyyy exciting!!!

we're playing arkansas today, and i really hope we win:)  we have an injured/suspended team though....and arkansas is really good this season.  it should be a tough game."

"event","I am just going to vent about my frustrations with FOX.  FOX has committed suicide with the oc.  granted if the writing was equal to last year's...it wouldn't really matter much.  but that isnt the case!!!!!  these 3 episodes have been WONDERFUL episodes of the show.  had FOX put it on another night (almost any other night though tuesday would be the most successful probably) and promoted it efficiently....it would have chance.  noone is watching it because noone believes or knows it is good again.  FOX has been doing a horrible job with promoting the show, and now the show will have to pay.  IT is just so aggravating because the writing and acting is so good right now.  I love Grey's and watch it and know why the hold watches it...but honestly these latest episode of the o.c. totally beat the latest episodes of grey's.  here's a link that summarizes how i feel about this whole thing.  urrr.

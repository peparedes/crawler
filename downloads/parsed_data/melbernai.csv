DH is setting up a webpage and we wanted to put a stats counter on it.

I had one that I really liked WAY back in the day on diary-x, which as far as I can tell is no longer around.
Can anyone recommend a good, free stats counter?

Thanks,
Melissa"

Really, nothing major has happened.  Emily is growing and is getting smarter and smarter every day.  She is our excitement.  She has such a funny, hysterical personality.  She is very talkative and loves to sing also.  She's all about Christmas this year.  We took her to see Santa last night, and although she was shy, she loved sitting on his lap and is talking about it so much this morning.

I am still working in the city, teaching 2nd grade special education now.  I will probably be having a major career change in the summer, since my certification has run out, but I am not sure what yet.  Part of me wants to continue teaching, part of me does not.  I really don't know what else I can do though!

Here are a few photos from this Christmas so you can see how big my little girl has gotten!!

The other day we went shopping and so she got to go for a car ride and it was just so nice to know that even though she's too young to look out the windows, the world was looking beautiful out there just for her -- with all the leaves changing color and stuff.

So being the first-time-mom that I am, I dressed her up in her Halloween outfit last night and posed her with a Pumpkin and fake flowers and took her picture.  I'm also having fun dressing her up in fun warm clothes and her awesome hats from Baby Gap that some friends and family have gotten her.

I only gained  lbs during the entire pregnancy, and it was right at the end when I started swelling after I went back to work at 35 weeks pregnancy, so it may have been all water weight.

When I left the hospital on Monday I had lost 14 lbs from when I went in for my c-section.  That put me 11 lbs lower then when I got pregnancy.

Then when I went to the doctor for my 1-week follow up, I was down a full 25 lbs from when I went to the hospital for the c-section.  That means I was down 22 lbs from my pre-pregnancy weight.

I just weighed myself now and I'm down another 5 lbs.  That puts me at 30 lbs lost from pre-c-section, and 27 lbs lost from my pre-pregnancy weight.

Breastfeeding is a wonderful thing!!!

"event","Hey all!

Sorry for the delay in posting!  As you can imagine we've been very busy around here!

On Thursday, 10/6, at 3:03 in the afternoon, I gave birth to a beautiful baby <b>GIRL!!</b>  She is so amazingly beautiful, I can't even describe it to you.  She is just the most perfect thing!  Her name is Emily Elizabeth and she was 9 lbs 10 oz, 19.5 inches when she was born!

I had her by c-section and that went fine, but she didn't have some complications.  She was breathing very rapidly when she was born and had to spend 24 hours under the oxygen hood in the Neonatal ICU.  Then after they cleared her breathing she ended up having high Bilirubin levels and needed phototherapy treatments for another 48 hours, so she spent even more time in the NICU.  It was a hard 4 days in the hospital because I couldn't have her room in with me and I had to go down to the special nursery to see her, and so I could only hold her for a little bit and then I had to go back to my room, so she  could stay under the lights for her treatment.  Needless to say I cried a lot because all the other moms had thier babies with them in the rooms.  I'd see the nurses wheeling all the babies down the hall in the AM, and when I'd walk down to see Emily I'd pass by rooms and see the moms hugging and feeding thier babies, and I wasn't able to do that.  I didn't even get to try breastfeeding her until her 2nd day because they said it would be too much work for her lungs, so she was on IV.  Now we're still having a hard time getting her to latch on so I'm pumping and feeding her my milk through the bottle and just supplementing a bit at night with formula.

Things definately were hard, but now we're home and it's going good.  We went for her first pediatritian visit today and they said she's perfect, no more problems.  She is just the sweetest cutest little thing.  She makes the most adorable little faces and already has a great personality.

Here are some pics.  I have a ton more but won't bombard you with all of them!

On Monday I went to the doctor and they repeated the sonogram and it turns out that the baby is now measuring over 10 lbs.  He or she was 10 lbs 3 oz on Monday, so the doctor decided that we're going to do a c-section to avoid the risk of the baby getting stuck in the birth canal, since that's a pretty big baby and I've never delivered before so we don't know how my body will handle it.  So made the appointment for today at 1 o'clock and I've just been going crazy busy since, getting all the last minute things done and going for pre-op testing and everything else involved.

I can't believe it!  In one hour I have to be at the hospital and then that's it!  In a few hours I'll be holding our baby!  I am so hoping that everything goes okay.  Over the past few days I've really started to get nervous about everything going alright.  I am hoping that the baby is healthy and nothing is wrong with it!  And of course I just can't wait to see the baby and know if it's a boy or a girl!

So next time you all hear from me I'll officially be a MOMMY!!!!

"event","I haven't posted any updates on the baby growing in my belly recently.

My last doctor's appointment was on Thursday.  I had a sonogram then and the baby measured 9 lbs 12 oz, but she said her measurements were on the ""skimpy"" side and could have been off because it's getting harder and harder to measure the baby.  It's head doesn't fit in one screen easily anymore, nor does it's belly or femur bone, which is what they need to measure.

Of course I asked the doctor if we're just going to keep waiting and waiting.  He said we need to wait until I'm 39 weeks, and I was like ""I'll be 39 weeks on Sunday!  It's only 4 days away!""  So he told me to come in Monday morning, which is today.

I'm afraid to deliver a big gigantic baby.  I'm afraid that I'll just end up needing a c-section anyway, so I kind of want them to just do it and get it over with.  But I'm also afraid of having a c-section because I know that when you are heavy and have a c-section there are a lot more risks involved with the healing process.  My SIL got a bad infection after her c-section and that's pretty common.

And of course I have a horrible cold now!  Sore throat, glands hurt, ear aches, sinus pressure, SO congested.  I've been running a low-grade fever since Friday night, around 99.7 or so.  I called the doctor Friday night and he said to get plenty of rest and drink plenty of fluids, which I did, but I'm still not feeling much better.  I don't know if that would change thier decision about sending me to the hospital to deliver the baby or something!

My appointment is at 11:45.  I guess we'll see what happens!"

"event","We went to the hospital today to take a tour of the labor and delivery unit.  I am so glad we FINALLY made it there!  We've been trying to go for a few weeks but haven't been able to get there, but I figured that since I'm 37 weeks today and technically considered ""full term"" by the books, we needed to make this the weekend to get it done.

It was a good tour.  Not too long, about 45 minutes.  They showed us the maternity triage rooms, labor/delivery/recovery rooms, and the post-partum rooms.  We got to peak into the operating rooms where they do c-sections, but of course you can't go in because they are sterile rooms and they'd have to re-clean it after the tour.  The best part though was seeing the nursery!  There was a little boy in there who was just born about an hour and a half before we got there, and he was under the baby warmer and all just laying there in his naked-baby glory, and he was so adorable!  He didn't look all slimy and shriveled, actually his coloring was very good.  He didn't possibly look like he had only been in the world for a bit over an hour!  And he kept putting all of his fingers in his mouth, and yawning and stuff.  It was just precious.  I just wanted to stare at him forever!  Can you just imagine what I'm going to be like with my own child?

I also noticed while passing by a room a father who was holding his baby in his arms, sitting in a chair next to the mom's bed.  That was another very sweet thing to see.  I can't wait until our baby is born and I can take pictures of it in Bill's arms.  I know he's going to be a wonderful loving father, because he is so wonderful and loving towards me, always trying to take care of me and make me happy.  I'm just at the point now where I want it to happen so we can all be together.  I want to meet my baby so bad!  

Today's hospital tour just made me want it all even more!"

"event","I went into the doc's office again tonight for a round of NST/BPP/Internal.  I am at 36 weeks 5 days.  My NST was fine, and the baby scored well on the BPP, and the internal was the same, not dialated at all, but I'm really starting to freak out because the baby is weighing in at 8 lbs 8 oz.  Last week it was 7-9, the week before 6-11, and now 8-8 ... basically the baby is gaining a pound a week!  I know they could be off but the woman re-did all the measurements a TON of times, like 5-6 times each just to be sure, and it still kept coming up with the 8-8 measurement.  


I was telling the doctor how concerned I am, and he said they still wouldn't induce me due to size until 39 weeks anyway, because the baby might not be developed until then.  I also asked him if we're talking about an 11 or 12 lb baby here, and he said most likely yes, it seems like it'll be that way.  I asked if they'd even consider a vag.  birth in that case and he said no, because even if the head goes through, the shoulders can get stuck and that's a difficult situation.  So it looks as if I'm going to be looking forward to a cesarian.  I really wanted to avoid a c-section.  I am heavy and I know that increases your risk of infection, plus the whole maternity leave situation at my job sucks and I basically have about 13 days that I can take off after the baby is born and still get paid, and I'd definately need more then that with a c-section, so I'm just really nervous and dreading it all now.

I know it's too early but I wish they could just induce me now.  I guess it's just not an option."

"event","I just have to share the ridiculously dorky thing I ended up doing today. 

I noticed last night that my gas light was on and I'm one of those people who drives around forever with it on. Usually I can go a while with it on. So last night I said to DH after picking him up from work to remind me to get gas in the morning.

He didn't need me to drive him though, so I didn't leave the house till like 4 today. I was going to go to target and then pick him up. However, my car would barely start. I finally got my car to start, and figured I'd have no problem making it up the road to the gas station that I always go to.

I made it across the stoplight and my car died.

So I ended up walking about 3/4 of a mile on Wantagh avenue to the gas station to ask them if they sold the gas cans, which they don't. Meanwhile I was having contractions while I was walking there because I've been having them on and off since this weekend. And some stupid guy was in there chatting it up with the mechanic saying people don't return gas cans so that they shouldn't lend it out to anyone, and I'm sitting there thinking, holy cow, does this guy realize I just walked all the way here and I'm 8.5 months pregnant and I'm not leaving until I get some gas???? So finally the gas pump guy told the mechanic I am okay (because they know me, I always go there) and he just drove me to my car and give me some gas. So he did that and then I went back and filled my tank up.

I can't even blame it on baby brain. It was just a stupid doofy thing for me to think I'd make it there!"

BTW, I went in for my NST and BPP today and the baby is giganto.  It's measuring in at 6 lbs 11 oz.  Not just in weight but also in length.  The measurements put me at 38 weeks 6 days, but I'm only 34 weeks pregnant.  The doctor said we're not changing my due date, that he still wants to see me go to 37 or 38 weeks at least.  However, I'm now getting BPPs (ultrasounds) every week to check the size.  

Otherwise everything was great.  The baby seems really healthy in there, aside from it's giganticness.

My shower was also yesterday!  But I don't feel like typing everything all out.  It was really nice though.  We got a lot of nice stuff and a TON of clothes.  I have a whole heaping laundry basket to sort through now!

"event","I'm completely amazed that clothes I bought before the pregnancy, that I was hoping to fit into but just couldn't, suddenly fit me and actually almost look good on me, despite the fact that I'm 34 weeks pregnant and have a big gigantic pregnancy belly.

For example, back in September I bought this awesome jean jacket from LB, but it didn't exactly button.  Since I was losing weight I swore I'd fit into it, and bought it anyway.  I just tried it on, and it buttons, over my big gigantic belly.

It was big everywhere else.

Another example.  When I was about 4 1/2 months pregnant I went to Motherhood for my first maternity clothes.  I didn't fit into the largest size of maternity jeans.  They didn't stretch enough and just didn't fit, so I couldn't buy a pair of jeans, bought stretchy capris instead.

A week ago I went shopping with my sister and she insisted I try on the jeans again so she could see how bad they were.  I tried them on, and they fit!!

And now that I've got them home, they are too big on me.  They are huge in the hips, ass, I mean the stomach fits because I've got a huge belly, but everywhere else they are big.  I could have bought the smaller size.

Who'd have ever thought that being pregnant would make me reach my smallest weight in my adult years?  It's so bizarre.

"event","This morning I was telling Bill that I hadn't felt the baby move very much yet, and it was already like 11 in the morning.  So Bill got on my belly and layed his head against it, and was saying ""Hello Baby"" just like he likes to do, and he got kicked in the ear 6 times.

Bill's dad and I were just discussing the baby, because I was showing him the cutie little Grateful Dead onsies that Bill got from the <i>Gathering of the Vibes</i> festival last weekend, and he said he thinks the baby is going to be huge.  He said that when he was born, he was 14 lbs!  <b>14 pounds!!!!!</b>  That's like an enormo-baby!  I hope my baby doesn't take after him!  Meanwhile, he was born in the middle of the night, in Liverpool, in his <i>house</i> without any midwives or doctors or anything.  And his mom lived to have more children after that!  How the heck do you pop out a 14 pound baby all by yourself without any doctors in your house?!?!?!  That blows my mind!

I am quite amazed with my weight gain during this pregnancy.  And no, I haven't gained 50,000 lbs.  I've gained <i>nothing</i>...absolutely nothing!  In fact, on Monday when I went to the doctors, I could have sworn that I'd have gained, because I've been feeling like a blimpy house (my belly is so huge right now.  My sister Irene was in Portugal for a month and she said I'm double the size of when she left, and Randi thinks I look like I'm ready to go any day now) but when I stepped on the scale I was actually 4 lbs lighter then my last visit there, two weeks previous.  The doctors are happy with that.  They said that I only needed to gain 15 lbs with the pregnancy, and now that I'm not gaining at all they say it's perfectly fine, because I was a big momma to begin with, and I am just so surprised by it.  So many people gain a lot when they are pregnant, especially with thier firsts because they kinda go crazy with the food, but I've managed to lose a total of 6.5 lbs since the week that I found out I was pregnant.  It makes me feel hopeful that after the baby's born, I'll hopefully lose some baby weight, and that I'll hopefully be able to get back into the swing of things with weight watchers and all that stuff.  They have a breastfeeding program so I'm hoping to have some sucess with that.  Right now, if I lose about 20-25 lbs I'll be my graduating-from-college weight, which was in 2000, and if I lose about 45lbs I'll be my going-into-college-graduating-from-highschool weight.  Man.  That would blow my mind.

Okay, enough rambling.  In a little bit I'm going to post some cutie pictures.  Hehee.  I'm gonna go back and stare at my registry now.  Ta.

"event","Randi came out to my 32 week OB appointment yesterday and to have lunch.  When she pulled up to the house I went out to meet her at the car and she surprised me with Sonogram pictures.  She's already 3 months pregnant.  She wanted to wait until she was past the first trimester to tell anyone.  I don't know how she waited that long.

Shes due on February 24th.  So within a year and 2 months my parents will have gone from having no grandchildren at all to three grandchildren!  Now if that isn't motivation enough for them to clean up the damn house, I don't know if anything is.

We had lunch, and then we went maternity clothes shopping.  Actually, I was mostly looking for a nursing bra and I don't seem to be able to find any at all.  I am going to have to go to a specialty bra store this week and see if I can find any in my size.  They carry plus sized ones at motherhood but they aren't supportive at all!  I felt like my boobs were just gonna dangle all over the place.  And they will get bigger once my milk comes in, so that just won't do.

I did manage to buy a lovely maternity outfit.  My first pair of maternity jeans!  They are supposed to be capris but I'm so short, so they look like regular pants on me.  So for now I did a wide roll on them and safety pinned them into place, and they are great that way, and then in the fall I can roll them down and wear them as regular pants if it gets a little chilly.

The really surprising thing is that when I went maternity clothes shopping for the first time at like 4-5 months or so, all the jeans were too tight in my size, around the hips and crotch and belly and stuff.  Now I tried on the same ones, and they were actually big on me.  I'm 8 months pregnant and although my belly is growing, I'm shrinking!

I actually had lost 4 lbs when I went to the doctor yesterday.  That puts me at 6.5 below my weight when I found out I was pregnant.

I'm hoping that I instantly lose like 20 lbs within the first weeks of being a new-mother, and that it'll kick start me into gear because I plan on following the weight watchers breastfeeding program.  I hope I'm able to pull it off.

Okay, that's enough for now.

"event","So many things have happened during this pregnancy that have just AMAZED me, that I haven't written down.  You get so caught up in things that you just don't write them, even though you know it would be awesome to look back one day on them.

Bill has felt the baby kick many times now.  Sometimes he was feeling on purpose, sometimes the baby kicked him in the head (oi) when he least expected it, but the funniest had to be the other night.

On Fridays I babysit for my brother's baby all day, from about 7am till after 6pm.  They live about 40 minutes away so I get up super early, wake up and leave way before Bill has even woken up.  I give him a kiss goodbye and then leave.  We talk on the phone a few times during the day but that's it.  It's a long time not to see my honey.

So on Friday I didn't get home till nearly 8pm.  I was exhausted, so before we went to get dinner I layed down for a few minutes in bed, and Bill layed down with me.  He started saying ""Hi BABY"" onto my belly really loud, and every time he said it, the baby kicked a HUGE GIGANTIC kick.  Not little regular kicks, but these kicks that send your arm flying off of the belly.  So Bill kept saying ""Hi Baby"" over and over again, and the baby kept kicking him like a maniac over and over again.  I say the baby must have been excited to see him after not hearing his voice all day.

Then the other night Bill and Al went to Walmart, and there is a Krispy Kreme next to Walmart, so the evil brothers brought home donut holes and donuts!  Argh!  High Blood Sugar girl should not be eating donuts!  Anyway, I had a few donut holes, and so the baby was dancing around, soaking in all the horrible sugar.  I asked Al if he wanted to feel the baby, he said okay, but they were like mediocre kicks.  The kind that a person whose never felt them before might be unsure whether they are feeling them or not.  So I told them to pass me another donut hole, and I wasn't even done chewing it when our silly baby started giving rumbling punches or something all over my belly.  Al definately felt that!

It really is amazing at this point to just feel the constant movement inside of you.  I keep trying to figure out if they are arm punches, leg kicks, or what.  Sometimes you can tell the baby is rolling around, flipping over, because instead of a short kick it's like this big movement going all across your belly.  It makes me wonder if it's happy in there, what it is reacting to, what it is thinking and feeling.  

It makes me REALLY REALLY want to see the baby.  It wants me to see what it's eyes, nose, ears, lips are like.  I want to know if it has hair or if it's bald.  I want to see if it's tall like Bill, short like me, chubby or skinny.  (Most likely chubby since the thing weighs so much already!!)  I want it to be healthy.  I want it to have no asthma, no low blood sugar at birth, no problems at all.  I want it to be really happy with us, to be content and just at peace with the way we are as parents.  I can't wait to see it so I'll know the sex, and know what to name it!  I know that when I see it's face I'll have no more doubts about middle names.  I'll just know what he or she should be called.

I can't wait to meet our little baby.

Here is a newer picture of the wedding, that I just got.  It was taken by my hairdresser at her house, just after Antoinette (our niece) and I finished getting dressed and dolled up for the wedding.  Mrs. Ackerly was nice enough to take a whole bunch of photos of us in her house.  This is one of my favorites.<br clear=""all"" />"

This is actually pretty cool, because you can post an image directly from the flickr site without having to go to livejournal.  So we'll see how it goes!<br /><br />This is our latest ultrasound, from 29 weeks.  (I'm 31 weeks now)  It isn't the most clear image because we just used the machines in the dr's office to get the baby's size, instead of going to the perinatal place where I went for the anatomy scan, but you can see the baby's face, and it's left arm up against it's head.  I think it looks like me.  Hehee.<br /><br />-Melissa<br clear=""all"" />"

"event","It's been quite a long time since I've updated this thing.

My online time has been being spent elsewhere, I'll admit it.  I'm such a traitor.  First I swore I'd never leave d-x, and although I swore I'd never leave lj, and although I really haven't, I'm never really on here anymore to give updates.

I've been spending my time over at a website for Long Island Families.  I've been on the parenting and pregnancy boards, asking questions, sharing experiences, and it's just so appropriate for what I'm going through right now.  Like last night, I asked about diapers, and tons of people answered me.

Pluh.com has decided to take down thier webhosting services, so all my uploaded pics from the wedding, of ultrasounds, and all that aren't working anymore.  I need to find a new, free webhosting service so that I can get them all working again, but I just don't even feel like sitting in front of the computer long enough to transfer everything over.  It's going to be a pain in the arse.

This week and last, I've really felt big time pregnant.  I'm 7 and a half months now.  I had an ultrasound last monday at 29 weeks and the baby weighed in at 3 lbs 11 oz, which is way bigger then normal.  Normally they are like 2.7 at that point.  So we're gonna have a big baby.  Ultrasounds could always be slightly off, but I just feel like it's going to be big.  They've been telling me all along that it was measuring big.

I have these new aches and pains going along with the pregnancy now.  My choocher always hurts.  It's like this bad pressure down there, called Round Ligament Pain, according my my Lamaze instructor.  So I'm doing the exercises she taught us to help make them better but it doesn't seem to be helping yet.

I'm also getting really bad sciatic nerve pain.  It's the worst when I wake up or in the middle of the night, but sometimes I feel like I can't even move in bed.  I do, of course, and it's not as bad as some people have described it, but it still sucks.

Other then that, I'm reading the new Harry Potter book.  I've only got a few chapters left.  Married life is going well.  Bill's father is away in England so it's just me, him and his brother in the house, but his brother was away for a week also, so it was just the two of us.  It was really nice, being just the two of us.  I don't mind living here for the time being, I know it's a necessary thing to do, but it'll be so nice when we are finally able to move out and have a place of our own, with room for all of our stuff.  I'm wondering how the crib and all the baby's things are going to fit in here.  It's going to be a tight squeeze, but hopefully it'll only be for a few months.

I have a picture of the baby's face, from the last ultrasound.  It's not super clear but you can see the shape of the face and the arm right next to the head.  I can't post it on here because of that whole webhosting thing, but if anyone would like to see it, comment with your e-mail so I can send it over to you.

Hope you're all doing well!

Melissa"

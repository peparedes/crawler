"event","So I checked out this site again, and was shocked you guys are updating.  So here's mine.

1.  Music, just writing hip hop beats lately, people buy them faster than anything else I ever made.  I still love jungle, but I listen to hip hop almost exclusively now.  I just like the laid back vibe, and it fits my chronic weed smoking well as a soundtrack.

2.  I'm not gonna say I quit drinking, but I never do it anymore.  Who knew you could regret so much you can't remember?  Glass of red wine cool, drinking for me is done.

3.  I do miss people, more than I thought, but I wouldn't have been able to move past my whole woe is me/depression shit without a change of scenery.  You can hate it or love it, but I feel my survival was in question.  Maybe it still is, but I defintely don't care like I used to.  

4.  Sports wise the cowboys have killed my faith.  The raptors coulda had gerald wallace, and they took JO?  Retarted.  The braves . . . now thats depressing.  Still not watching anything on ice.

5.  Had a few new GFs in the last bit, but none now.  As I get older I find it a lot harder to like a girl for longer than 1 month.  Not in that whole grass is greener shit, but in that I'm not settling for nothing (not talking looks either).  

6.  Movies/TV?  Dexter and Kenny vs Spenny.  Movies wise I loved step brothers, thought the dark knight was overrated, but still awesome.  Prolly enjoyed Death Note live action more than anything.

7.  I got a wii and wii fit and I do yoga everyday.  Calms me the fuck down, and I look better, wiegh less and feel better.  Wii unfortunately has only one other good game (they call it mario kart)

8.  Struggling trying to quit smoking, but I will do it, it's just gonna hurt ;).

9.  I spent time in calgary, It was very chill, strong weed, 2am liqour stores everywhere, casino and casino and casino.  Very wierd vibe from people, almost too nice.  Toronto kills it :P.

10.  Uhhhhhhhh I've started wearing watches, don't know why I didn't before.



in conclusion its been a while, and I feel like a completely different person now to be honest, so if i am forgettin somethin, or if youre actually curious to hear more, then reply.

Later."

Q: So me and my buddies were making a team in NFL Street and decided to make Jesus Christ our running back. We gave him the beard, long hair and torn clothes. Turns out, he's amazing! You think the pass is incomplete and all of a sudden, here comes Jesus flying to make a diving catch. Do you think this would work in other sports games? I'm curious as to whether it will work in a basketball game considering Jesus was only like 5-feet tall.

"event","Q: The Sox should just tell Manny he got traded to Boston. He won't know the difference.
--Mike H, Noxen, N.H.

SG: I love this idea. They could go all out with this: Call him up, tell him he's been traded to Boston, have him pack up all of his stuff, fly him in circles in the team jet for five hours, then drop him off in Cambridge and tell him he's on the West Coast. He might fall for it. By the time the season starts, it will be too late for him to complain. I really think this could work.

Q: All right, it's time for the big question. You are offered a five-year deal to GM any NBA team of your choice. Here's the catch: You have to open-mouth kiss Rick Reilly for 24 seconds on ""The Late Late Show"" with Craig Ferguson. Then you have to ask, on national TV, for an autograph on a copy of one of his columns, and then say that it made you ""weep"" and that you ""didn't know that sportswriting could be about so much more than sports."" I think your faithful readers deserve to know how much the NBA really means to you.
--Wayland, Cedar Falls, Iowa

SG: The sad thing is, I actually mulled this one over. I'd do just about anything to run my own NBA team. That got me thinking -- shouldn't this be a reality show? Like a cross between ""The Apprentice"" and ""Fear Factor""? I would absolutely eat my way out of a coffin of maggots for a chance to run an NBA team. Somebody get Joe Rogan on the phone."

I really want a ferret, but I never owned one, so I'm not sure if I know how to own one.  Still tho, as far as smaller than a cat or dog pets go, ferrets seem like great little buddies.  I'd name mine Ron Ron The Rottwieler, Sheed, or of course Romo.

2.  Saturday I'm goin against my better judgement and debatin Fet on saturday.  Other people I know are goin to see Kenny Ken and MC Skiba.  Last time I saw Kenny Ken was at funhaus, and I slept beside Aaron in the sound mixer booth thing for the entire time, so what's that say?.  I think I've seen Skiba 700 times, so there's no excitement there.  And hell if I go to fet night, Peter Ross will drink with me before hand.  Can't beat that with a bat.

3.  I hate to break it to you MarkOOz, Rich LeBelle, and The Weddin Gown; and all you other Blue Jays fans.  Every year in sports, someone washed up, has a great year because their contract is running out and they need more guaranteed money for when they sink back into mediocrity.  If that player is 38 it's much scarier.  Enjoy Frank Thomas.  You realise you coulda gotten sheffield, compare their numbers over the last 5 years sometime . . .

4.  I'm in love with Earl from my name is Earl I think.  That last one with my old fave Christian Slater was pretty dope I tells ya.  Seein him drain those tires was great.  I love the environment, but I believe we're already dead.  I kind of live like a dead man too sometimes.

5.  My poker hot streak really took a dive as I lost a half a million bucks in my 360 game bankroll on a bad read, I really thought we'd split that flush as the king was out, and no way he had the ace.  Thank god it wasn't a real 500 grand . .. still tho it'll take a bit to make it back.

6.  Weddin Gown:  Can we play basketball one time again before it snows?  Anyone else in?  we do it down by the ex on those courts on dufferin,  we seem to not get rolled there.  I'd love to say darren and I are like white men can't jump and I'm wesley snipes, but I just don't own those kind of clothes, tho i'd love to do it for halloween some year, hot pink bicycle shorts etc.

- A lot of the costumes were great.  Espescially the guy who was a mirror with lines of coke on it, followed closely by the hundreds of half naked women costumes.

- While lining up for coat check, the trance room played nitzer ebb, so that was nice for my brief trance room experience.

- As soon as we got to the main room, SS plays Bodyrock, while MC Tali lays some awesome female mcing on us.  His entire set was a collection of just things you know and want to hear, like ladies of spain, and old Kemal and Rob Data.

- Goldie absolutely tore the roof off yet again.  He played Temper Temper for god's sake.  He played a remix of Kick and Push by Lupe Fiasco.  Between those he played song after song wheere you just want to yell as loud as you can, good thing we were in the VIP room and dancing directly behind Goldie djin.  I wish I could figure out how to download my phone pics.

- I was pretty dead tired after dancing for prolly 5 hours straight, but red one came on, and then he played Ram Records song after Ram Records song, and dancing had to happen again.  Finally got to dance to Cold Killa.

Dade County Courthouse

13th Floor

73 West Flagler Street

Miami, Florida 33130

Re: Bully

Dear Judge Friedman:

Now that you have consigned innumerable children to skull fractures, eye injuries from slingshots, and beatings with baseball bats, without a hearing as to the danger, let me tell you a few things, with all respect for your office and with no respect for the arbitrary way in which you handled this matter. I can handle an adverse ruling by a judge. I've had plenty of those in my lifetime, and that's fine. But the way you conducted yourself today helps explain why a great Dade County Judge, the late Rhea Pincus Grossman, could not abide you. She was not the only one:

1. Well into this case, you told Take-Two to produce ""a tape of the game so you could watch it."" Video games don't come on tapes, Judge, and you don't watch them. You interactively play them, which is why they are so behavior modifying. You, the player/protagonist, enter into the violence and do it, but you didn't even want to hear testimony about that. You are not an expert in bullying or virtual reality, and I had an expert in both, and you never heard from them because you did not want to hear from them. Dr. Provenzo could have explained why interactive consumption of this very violence is so dangerous, as opposed to passively consumed violence on television, but he was not allowed to testify because he was prevented from seeing the evidence.

You were very nice to my other expert, Miami Police Chief Ken Harms, and then made it certain that your courtroom would not be graced with his real expertise. I would have preferred less courtesy and more due process, and so would the victims that are on the way.

2. Take-Two's lawyer, Rebecca Ward, lied in your courtroom when she told you that a ""Teen"" rating is an age restriction at the point of sale. That is an utter fabrication, and you are on notice that it is an utter fabrication. Ms. Ward is very good at fabricating things for a client that routinely engages in criminal conduct, and you bought all this hook, line, and sinker. Take-Two has been adjudicated by the federal government to have engaged in fraud and deception about game content, and you took their unchallenged word of these two video gamers in your chambers that the game was what they said it was.

3. You assured us, in your courtroom two days ago, that you would view the playing of Bully to its conclusion. That is what you promised on the record. You did not keep your promise. The transcript of that bizarre exercise will show that you asked Take-Two reps ""How does the game end?"" You never saw the ending. What you took was testimony from two employees of Take-Two/Rockstar, who were not under oath, and without affording me any opportunity to question them. This was an ex parte proceeding that I was forced to watch, nearly gagging on the denial of due process that it constituted. In thirty years of practicing law, it is the oddest thing I have ever seen, and the most judicially arbitrary thing I have ever seen.

But it is not the oddest thing Take-Two has done. They had these little contrived, controlled viewings of the game for people in the media, but even the BBC figured out how violent the game was, despite the sham.

What you conducted in your chambers, Judge, was the equivalent of Iran leading UN weapons inspectors around the country taking them to places where the illegal activity was not occurring.

You would not abide argument today, because the Miami Herald was there, that Take-Two had in fact released this game to the mass media, which waived its privilege as to producing it to me. You did not allow a hearing to occur because the media there would have seen how you railroaded this entire matter--at the expense of children's safety.

4. You said after being shown what Take-Two wanted you to see that ""I've seen worse."" Judge, that is not the issue. The issue is whether this game, played by ten-year-olds, whom the FTC says can still walk into Wal-Mart and other retail establishments and buy ""Mature"" games, will harm them and innocent third parties who get in their way. You are not the measure of the harm. It was your job to let me try to prove the harm. But you didn't want to hear it.

5. How dare you, Judge, promise a hearing today and then prevent that hearing from occurring. How dare you, Judge, petulantly order the production of the game after it is released on Tuesday morning. I didn't even ask for that. You did that out of spite, and you were smiling when you did that. You really enjoyed that one, didn't you, Judge?

6. Finally, Judge, when the reports start coming in from across the country as to the harm that Bully is causing, I want you to think of the parents who rely upon judges to grant due process, apply the laws evenly, and keep their word. The Republicans in the Congress of the United States apparently can't protect pages, and the Miami-Dade judicial system can't even protect children, let alone its own reputation.

You broke every promise made me. Disagree with me if you like, but don't refuse to hold a hearing you promised to have. Don't promise to view an entire game and then cut out after an hour.

I couldn't care less what you did to me. What I care is that you, through judicial arrogance, have hung countless kids out to dry in school that will now be meaner and more dangerous.

Next time you promise a ""hearing,"" I'll bring a parent with me whose kid is in the ground because of a kid who trained to kill him or her on a violent video game. Try mocking that person, I dare you.

Think about it, she got on top of her game at a really young age, blew by the competition and seemed to have peaked at around 21. Then, she breaks up with Timberlake (which could be Cus D'Amato dying). Then finds K-Fed (who is a mix of Don King, the rape charge, and Buster Douglas all in one). So what's next for my former dream girl?
--Dan Soder, Tucson, Ariz.

SG: I just enjoyed that you described K-Fed as ""a mix of Don King, the rape charge, and Buster Douglas all in one."" Sums him up perfectly. But in the spirit of your analogy, I think WrestleMania is next for her. It's the logical next step. After she pumps out the next kid, K-Fed leaves her for her sister, her next album bombs and she files for bankruptcy for the first time, I could totally see her becoming Triple H's manager for a few weeks and hitting John Cena over the head with her purse at WrestleMania XXVI. Just feels right."

- Ended up at a house party down the street.  Two amps, and two technics equals fun.  Lots of good djs, and more people then at nuetral so it was a good time by all.  DJ Drew got on and played a hybrid hip hop and house set, with some of the best scratching I've seen in my life.  I was like 'I played a hip hop set last week too bro!  It was no good tho compared to this . . .'  All in all the djs rocked, and it made me wish all house parties were good.

- I got home and actually won a high stakes xbox 360 game drunk, that I don't really recall playing.  Good times.

Saturday:

- I was supposed to go to darkrave but just couldn't bring myself.  Doin Panic last week was fun (despite how lame most people were, you'd think people could try something new after 10 years), but I think I need another 6 months before I see a lot of those people again.  Tho let me be clear that I love lloyd, and I had a lot of fun talking to him at Panic for the first time in a long time.  Even when he said new hip[ hop makes him sick ;).  But yeh just ended up having a chill night.  If I went tho I would definetly take Peter Ross over Enduser from what I heard about his set.

Sunday:

- Peter and Darren came by after Bogart left (he and I had a charming hamburger lunch), and Peter dragged us (well maybe not dragged) to captain jacks after we had a few beers.  I figured I was gonna get too drunk so I hit the road.  I figured they went home as it was 2:30, bt the first thing Peter said to me the next day was 'I can't believe I went to Darren's, how I got home?  No one knows.'

Monday:

- Woke up feeling crap, but went to the Ex with Gnat, Amber, and Paul.  I was a bit apprehensive to go on our first ride (the gravitron) as I was hungover and on a bit of tylenol, but it turned out to be ok, while gnat screamed beside me.  Following a break for the sticky icky, I convinced Gnat to go on a rollercoaster with me.  It was more or less all good in line, but on the way up the first hill she started freaking, me im just the picture of half asleep during it, but she ended up gettin into it.  Went on a couple more that she was afraid of, so went with Amber.  

- Later we hit the Tilt a Whirl, which actually got me queezy, but that was nothin.  On the polar express they got me on the outside.  Little ol me.  And yes I got crushed, I t was like lying under a refridgerator.  I had a testicle squeezing between my pelvic bone and thigh and could not get up.  I just kept thinking about how peoples testicles can burst.  luckily I lived.  We then went on the worst haunted house of all time.

- Gnat and I chilled at sweaty bettys after and had a chill time.  I love that bar, cozy bars are hard to find.

The End.  (now to write some music)"

But for the last few weeks I really have cut the cord.  It just feels so refreshing, but at the same time I am missing some cats.  Either way tho, it's continuing.

    Dramatic?  nah, just really fucking bored with where I'm at.

    So I'm steppin 'outside the box' lately, and prolly till the fall, though I will be at WEMF mosty likely, as I loved Mampi Swift earlier this summer, so why not see him again.

    I will be back, so keep your fuckin shirts on ;).

With Love,

Chris"

"event","Yesterday:

- Met up with J to go record shopping, the temptation keeps growing to buy vinyl again . . . Some great stuff out there from Fresh, Noisia, and London Electricity.  Also some good stuff from Daddy Yankee and Noreaga.  Ended up just grabbin a cd, Roots Manuva's Alternately Deep.  Quite good, a lot harder and grimier than his last cd.  I checked out Gnarls Barkley and the new one from The Streets and wasn't into either.  Gnarls got a LOT of good press as the best hip hop to come out all year.  Sounded like Outkast for indie rock fans.  Too bad I couldn't find M1's new one tho.

- Hooked up with Darren after for some chillin, we ended up playing an 18 inning 0-0 tie baseball game on xbox.  Tho both of us were so bored we wanted to die, neither wanted to concede or let the other win.  Thankfully I put it away with a bullshit set of singles.  Afterwards we headed to Cadillac Lounge for a pair of pitchers.  I realised while there that I wouldn't make it home to see voyager so Darren thankfully let me watch it as his place while he rolled his eyes the whole time.

Today:

- Just gettin things in order so the next few days go smoothly, these are exciting times my   mens.  Should be back in the east end in my own place for July 1st, and just keep on lookin up from there.  It's bizzarre to be in a good mood and lookin forward to shit again, it's only been 4 or 5 years . . . 

Extra:

- Whats the details on your fashion show this year emily?  I haven't seen you and phil in way too long.  And Savage Garden . . . oh Savage Garden . . . :) 

(pretty lame to end this with a smiley)"

i had this idea like 20 minutes ago, and jay and nolan are already on board. just record everything you can in 16:9 wide. record as much as you can for as long as you can. just be sure to touch base with me somehow before summers out so that i can get all your tape and start editing it.

my bellys full of food, my hearts full of love, and my heads full of good thoughts.

i got coffee with ruti tonight. it was the first time id seen her in months and months, but we picked up like wed never spent a day apart, like we always do. i figure thats when you know youre really good friends with somebody because the same thing happens with me and cary or me and shauna. however long we go without communication, we are always able to resuscitate the old friendship like it was nothing or like nothing ever happened.

its thoughts like these that make it easier to see these people off and to go off myself. i know that whatever we decide to do with our lives, i will always be around for them, and theyll always have some time for me."

i had dinner with alex, annie, and jordan last night. then alex and i saw the animation show (which i highly recommend). there was this one short titled ""hello,"" and id really like to get the character from it tattooed somewhere on my body. we met up with chase afterwards at fellinis and hung out with this girl, ginna, who works there. got free pizza. always a good thing.

today i slept in and played some frisbee, shot the breeze, and then hung out with cary. we drove around for a while and ended up at chases. left there and went to waffle house where we met luke. talked for a couple hours then came home. pretty low-key, but sometimes its better that way.

i dont think ive made a post thats catalogued my day in a very long time. weird. im in a weird mood i guess.

anyway, if i havent given you a copy of my demo yet, and you want to contribute something to the final recording of it, let me know somehow and i will burn you a copy of it.

"event","the ben folds adventure was almost over before it started, but we pulled it together at the last minute. the whole trip was enjoyable: the 7 hour drive up, the meeting the kids at ccm, the going to that girls birthday dinner about an hour after i met her, the ben folds show*, the driving back to the dorms, the hanging out all night with complete strangers and enjoying myself, the breakfast in the morning, and the drive back. not one regret. this might be an early closing to the month-long birthday celebration i had in mind, but thats ok.

i thought as i was driving home, a glimpse of something beautiful is much better than staring at it until it is ugly. that made some things a lot easier.

*seriously one of the best shows ive ever been to. audience participation. dr dre cover. goddam genius, that ben folds."

marietta, ga 30064

from dallas highway:
get on BARRET PARKWAY like youre going to the mall. take a LEFT at the red light that intersects BURNT HICKORY RD. drive for a few minutes till you come up to the entrance of my neighborhood, BURNT HICKORY HILLS, on your right (street name: CUPELO DR). enter. drive down some twists in the road (note: at the first twist, cupelo dr turns into custer lake dr). my house will be on the left. its green with trees and and a brick mailbox in the front. balloons or something will be tied up.

from 41:
say you come from the mall. take a right onto 41. drive until you get to the red light intersection with KENNESAW DUE WEST RD. take a left. after you go straight through the stilesboro intersection, take a left onto GORDON COMBS RD. drive until that road dead ends into a stop sign. take a right onto BURNT HICKORY RD. drive for about a mile (probably less) till you come up to the entrance of my neighborhood, BURNT HICKORY HILLS, on your right (street name: CUPELO DR). enter. drive down some twists in the road (note: at the first twist, cupelo dr turns into custer lake dr). my house will be on the left. its green with trees and and a brick mailbox in the front. balloons or something will be tied up.

try to carpool, please. i dont know how many people are coming, but if its a lot, itll be difficult to get everybody parked.

if it does rain, we will do the show inside. itll be more intimate and relaxed.

hope to see you tonight."

"event","(so the lights go out and he saunters onto the stage with his four-piece band. in the darkness, its hard to make out the whos-who but five apparent musicians seem to be walking in and out of strips of light. they take their positions. the lights come on. the show begins. bob stood behind an electric piano the whole night, which was kind of disappointing, but hes bob dylan. he will do whatever the hell he wants. his voice seemed a bit hoarse. maybe all those cigarettes and years have finally caught up to him. now, the voice, although a bit rough, shot me down into my very soul. to hear that voice and feel that presence will never be matched. a modest show. a fantastic show. they played for nearly two hours then came back for a three song encore. its all over now, baby blue. you go your way and ill go mine. it aint dark yet, but its gettin there (not sure if thats the title, but the song was a highlight of the evening). like a rolling stone. all along the watchtower... just to list a few. he finished and approached the microphone. now, dylan rarely speaks to the audience (from what ive heard). so seeing this sent chills up and down my spine. he mumbled ""alright..."" and the crowd, of course, went wild. he spoke a bit more, but no matter how hard i tried to pick up on what he was saying, the roar of the audience just drowned out his voice even more. but he finished introducing the band and said his good night by standing in the center of the stage, instrumentless, statuesque, black suit with red trim, black cowboy hat with the sides flipped up. we erupted. he walked off stage. we went home, enlightened.)"

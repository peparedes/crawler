i cant believe we only have 1 more day of vacation. that is so depressing. well, atleast i did something good with my time yesterday. i slept, all day long. it was nice. and i slept in late this morning. then i took a shower so i felt all refreshed. and hilary came over today and we watched our home movies...hah. then i gave her a makeover. and we took pics w. my digital.

heres a song from A Mark, A Mission, A Brand, A Scar

What you've found sure upsets you
Never saw it coming did you?
Its easy to be suprised with both your eyes sewn closed
Handled with great percision, another thoughtless execution
You're the subject of this exhibition
A willing cadaver, a willing cadaver.
Scalpel, sutured. 
Made whole again.
These cuts are leaving creases
Trace the scars, fit the peices
Tell your story, you don't need to say a word.
Call off the calvary, can't save a wretch like me.
Clean this with kerosene. 
If you can't leave it be might as well make it bleed.
Scalpel, sutured.
Made whole again.
Your wires are frayed, can't fire right
You look better when out of sight
You were not made to stand and fight
There's something better wrong with you
Your pulse is anemic, you're tired of the fire
You're bruising too easy and falling behind
And no one is waiting for you.
And no one is waiting for you.
And no one is waiting for you.
Call off your quarantine, can't save the rest from me
Clean this with kerosene. 
If you can't leave it be might as well make it bleed.
Scapel, Sutured.
Made whole again.
Your wires are frayed, can't fire right
You look better when out of sight
You were not made to stand and fight
There's something better wrong with you

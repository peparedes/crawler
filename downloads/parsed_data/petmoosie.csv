Mrmoosie&#39;s family is visiting, so we are having a lot of fun, but getting totally off schedule.

I spent three hours today on a practice test for chemistry. I actually did quite well, so I am feeling more confident. It was long and exhausting, however.

Not really sure how to take logarithms without a table of them or a calculator. Is this something I learned in math, or never learned? I do remember using the tables of logarithms."

"event","Only 3 more hours to go! The 2011-2012 school year (3rd grade for Emily) will end tomorrow with a half-day. So much has been happening.

I intend never to be on quite as many PTA committees ever again. Some days (weeks), it seemed like I was in the school all day, every day.

I am turning over the foreign language committee to someone else. It will be advertised many many times probably before someone picks it up. But, as long as someone picks it up early in the school year, it will still work out. Emily is unlikely to do Spanish next year (grade 4) and it seems she will have a built-in conflict in grade 5.

Emily is being advanced far and fast in math, and she is enjoying it a huge amount. Fourth grade, she will be taking Math 6 with a group of 5th graders. In fifth grade, she will go over to the local middle school for math before the day begins at her elementary school (this would conflict with Spanish if it continues to be offered at the same time at the elementary school).

Emily and I are going to do a lot of Spanish work over the summer."

"event","I wonder if I don&#39;t understand how Raglan sleeves are constructed. The top of the garment is made of the sleeve and the top of the back, right? The front comes to a point, so it can&#39;t contribute to the top edge. The sloped edge of the back goes on for at least an inch longer than the sloped part of the sleeve, which is confusing me. The sleeve needs to meet in order to close the sleeve (to make it a tube, for the arm). The front sloped edge seems to be off from the sleeve by the same amount, so maybe the sloped edge of the front and the sloped edge of the back are supposed to connect under the sleeve?"

"event","It&#39;s raining, it&#39;s pouring. It&#39;s been a long time since we have had a long steady rain like this. The pollen is being forced down out of the air and many of the flowers are falling off the bushes. Everything bloomed pretty early this year: the azaleas, and the cherry trees.

All the surviving trees have leaved out. The county planted a large number of trees in the medians of the big roads nearby. Survival rates are correlated with the nearby trees, so you will find one median with all surviving trees and a nearby median with all dead trees (you will not find as often a mixture of living and dead trees in the same median). I suspect that the county will remove the dead trees sometime this year. They may not remove the branches of the ones that are alive low down and dead higher up. It is pretty difficult to work on those trees, just because the roads surrounding them are so busy.

I have planted a mixture of a type of beans, peas and corn. The peas came up first, then the corn is starting to come up fairly well now, and I can just see the beginnings of the beans. I took the easy way out, I spread the seeds and then added more soil on top, instead of digging them in. I also let them be planted fairly close together, so I may (or may not) thin them to get closer to the ideal spacing. I am planning to grow some morning glories around the corn, once it is well established (and I have done any thinning I wish to do).

I haven&#39;t mowed my yard yet this year (and it will probably be harder now that the grass is taller). I have weeded out quite a few things. I tend to recognize one type of weed, pull it anywhere I see it, and then move on to another type of weed. One of the weeds that I haven&#39;t messed with yet is a very spiky weed. Another one is the poison ivy.

My compost bin/heap is full of decomposable bags of kitchen refuse and weeds. I am completely out of leaves from last year. I&#39;ve turned the top layers a few times, but I have not dug deep or moved the bin. I can definitely see that the bags from the earliest times are composting fine. I got the bags as a Christmas gift, so they are only 4.5 months old. It is still not enough material for hot composting; in a small house like ours, there will never be enough material for hot composting. I do worry that the weeds will go to seed, even though I try to get them in there early enough that there aren&#39;t seeds yet. The heap is very near a pile of sticks from a branch that we had to take down.

We still need to get those sticks out front for yard waste pickup. We also have a tree to take down in the front of the house. It&#39;s been leaning at a angle since Snowmegeddon. We need to finish the branch in the back; we were working under a time constraint to get it down before Hurricane Irene came through.

Our fence could use repair or replacement. One of the gates will not close. I don&#39;t really know how to fix that myself. The ground has come up under it. On the side of our back yard, we have the ground sloping rapidly away into the fence. It would be nice to add more soil there and flatten it out and use the fence for terracing."

Just as an observation, I'm seeing more and more Asian kindergarten students with younger siblings. More than I saw two years ago. 

The lunchroom has rotated some of the tables, which allows me to see more students at once. There are definitely students of just about every shade of skin tone in the lunchroom. However, with the long winter, some who would normally look more brown are looking more gray. It might also be the lighting in the lunchroom or the clothes colors they are wearing. 

I sat behind a family at church on Ash Wednesday that were more Native American-looking than Hispanic, although they spoke Spanish."

We startled a deer in the front yard a few nights ago. So, that's what has been eating all the plants (not a surprise). I&nbsp;hope that my raspberries survived their nibbling. 

We've had a deep freeze in the last week. ( about 20 &deg;F) I suspect that my outdoor seeds have frozen and won't germinate. Oh well, I still have plenty of seeds from the same packages."

Emily is fed, her homework is complete and her hair is braided. She's at Religious Education with a neighbor of mine. This neighbor has a boy in Emily's class at the public school, but he is one year ahead in Religious Education. The neighbor is also a teacher for Religious Education.

I finally found the seed packet for the mixed wildflowers that I planted in the spring of '10. It was a mixture of 22% of Centaurea; 17% each of Gypsophilia and lupine; 11% each of Coreopsis, Delphinium and Echinacea; 5% of Rudbeckia; and less than 5% each of Chrysanthemum, Clarkia, Lychnis, Monarda and Silene. 

&quot;Most varieties bloom second year&quot;--we'll see."

"event","Not necessarily to the right place, but somewhere. I have ten problems to do by Friday, and at this point, they are taking about 2 hours each.&nbsp; With any luck, the time will get shorter before the end of the week. At the moment, my pay rate for these divided by the time it takes to do them is not enough. I don't tend to use complicated sentence structure, but I am required to do that for these. 

I also have online tutoring to prepare (and again for Friday), I really hope that I get both done in a credible way."

"event","The average adult has a blood volume in the range 4700 to 5000 ml. A donation (Red Cross or other) takes 500ml for the donation part. There are several test tubes of blood taken for tests at the same time (maybe 5?). These are smaller test tubes (maybe 10ml tubes?) with about a ml of agar at the bottom. So at a rough guess, they collect 9 x 5 = 45 ml for testing in addition to the 500ml. 

So the blood donation process (for whole blood) takes about 11% of total volume, 11% of red blood cells, 11% of iron, etc. Assuming that the volume is made up within hours from tissue fluid stores and dietary liquids, other components will be diluted to 89% of their original values. 

Regeneration times: if known. Red Cells--four to six weeks, maximum 8 weeks (Red Cross site)
Plasma--24 hours (Red Cross site)---Is this volume, volume and electrolytes, volume and blood proteins?"

I am doing laundry. Starting with adult dark clothes and I am hoping to get as far as sheets and towels. (ETA: some towels done, lots of adult dark clothes)

I'm changing the Brita filter. (ETA: done)

I am listening to a large number of news reports in Spanish. I am mostly listening to those from the recent days (about Egipto). 

I am sending out letters from the PTA&nbsp;that I should have done before the first of February. (ETA: done, thank goodness)

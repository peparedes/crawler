alsoo here are some quotes that i l o v e ::

""i'll never tell you the secrets I'm holding I know these things must bore you but I can't find another way I'll never tell you the secrets I'm holding I love this leash that holds me when i try to run away""

you smile when you feel like c r y i n g
you act like your 0kay when youre falling
apart but you learn to let i t go because
theres really n o t h i n g you can do


i set myself up for the greatest fall of
all time . . you think im impressed with
* your(one)night stands and your-
c o n t a g i o u s kiss . . im trying to
get this right, yeah cuz im rediculous
like that. . .  -matchbook romace 

They didn't agree on much, in fact they rarely agreed on
    anything. They fought all the time, and they challenged
       each other everyday, but in spite their differences, 
                they had one important thing in common...
                     they were c r a z y about each other*

life comes with no guarantees, no time outs, no second chances, you just have to live life to the fullest. laugh as much as you can, spend all your money, tell someone what they mean to you, tell someone off, speak out, dance in the pouring rain, hold someones hand, comfort a friend, pig out, fall asleep watching the sun come up, stay up late, be a flirt, smile till your face hurts, dont be afraid to take chances or fall in love...& most of all live in the moment cause when you look back someday knowing you have no regrets is gonna be what makes you smile [unknown]"

Sometimes you'll have bad and good days but someitmes there will be a mixture, but as you grow up you'll have some unforgetable memeories that will always be with you... The friendships you make come and go, but as you look at all the flash backs there's always something about eachone you can't forget... You'll move on in life, parents will seperate and you'll feel pain the you didnt know even existed... You'll leave old friends and make new, leave ur house you lived in for childhood and become somehting you didnt imagine, but now that you can see what its like, just rember nothing last's FOREVER"

In&nbsp; the last week so many things that have been in limbo for last couple of months have resolved for the better, at last I am seeing a little bit of brightness and clarity.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's been a year of waiting, a year of grief and sickness for quiet a few beautiful friends, I have gained a friend that I know&nbsp;is&nbsp; dear to me and will be a life long friend no matter what. I&nbsp;have old friends who I have grown so much closer too. I gained a buisness partner and creative friend in two old freinds. I have&nbsp;been disappointed in another and no longer&nbsp;wish to give&nbsp; it energy&nbsp;as I am so tired and&nbsp;there are many others I love that I want to support.&nbsp;And most&nbsp;importantly I&nbsp;have gained an amazing&nbsp;friend, lover and partner and know it&nbsp;isn't always going to be easy&nbsp;but I know it will be worth it :) 

I hope everyone has a brilliant year and Christmas

"event","CONFIRMED!!! Candy Pants arrives 6.30 am christmas Day. I feel like i did when I was 6 and it was Christmas Eve I made Mum and Dad stay up all night with me looking for santa( this made things really hard for dad to put out the presents and eat the milk and cookies and carrot... for the rein deer) but i feel that excited.&nbsp;

Ok I have known Candy Pants aka Garry for over 10 years we met in dance class and became good friends. I tortured him by casting him in a short film I did called Swan...I'm surprised he still remained my friend as part of the shoot consisted of the two main characters plunging themselves in a&nbsp;lake almost mid winter!!!&nbsp;Then he went overseas and I got divorced. I was minding some of his books for him. Then two years ago I got this call ""Hi it's Garry I'm here visiting for a while I hope you don't mind but i remembered your parents name and got your number"" we caught up for a drink where he was staying ""bring your pj and we'll have a bottle of champaign"". I did take my pj's (with frogs all over them) sometimes I have really stupid moments...I didn't think anything of it as the last time I saw him I was married and it just didn't register. One bottle of champaign later and a destroyed hotel room...and I mean destroyed!!!

I always use to say I don't want to got to Christmas because I hated seeing people fussing around...I hated it ...except for the santa bit but now......bring it on :)"

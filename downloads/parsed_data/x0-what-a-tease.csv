"event","well today is kinda depressing. its the last day of spring break and tomarrow we go back to the endless hell-hole they call school.my doggy cant walk anymore :( poor thing will be dead soon. and i realized a lot today.im beyond bored with my life and im so sick of daily routines. i think thats part of my problem.same things everyday and nuthing to look forward too . not even anything worth waking up for (for that matter)and i know disembarking on myself doesnt help. but it feels good to vent sometimes.and on top of that i got the most appalling,repugnant hair cut ever.


for a few seconds, it didn't really seem necessary to breathe...

might think i'm losing my mind but i will shy away from the specifics 'cuz i don't want you to know where i am 'cuz then you'll see my heart in the saddest state it's ever been. this is no place to try & live my life. stop right there.. that's exactly where i lost it see that line.. well i never should have crossed it. stop right there.. well i never should have said that it's the very moment that i wish that i could take back. i'm sorry for the person i became, i'm sorry that it took so long for me to change. i'm ready to try to never become that way again 'cuz who i am hates who i've been. who i am hates who i've been. i talked to absolutely no one, couldn't keep to myself enough & the things i bottled inside i finally begun to create so much pressure that i'd soon blow up. i heard the reverberating footsteps syncing up to the beating of my heart & i was positive that unless i got myself together i would watch me fall apart."

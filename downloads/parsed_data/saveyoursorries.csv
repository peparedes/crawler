im falling for a girl i shouldn't be.and she knows it.
i think she knows it might be hurting me.i don't want to be just friends....i wish she would see it.she knows who she is....so beautiful. everything i could want. someone to hang out with me and the guys where my band plays. someone to support us. and to love me. more than she already does. she's always there for me when im down and i love her, i love her. and i don't want to lose her.
   so if she doesn't want a relationship with me. i can understand, but i don't want to lost this friendship. i got to know her. and she made a very large impact on my life.

i love you brittany

"event","The world i now see in such a different way. My Highschool years are now coming to an end and i wonder where i will be in the next couple of years. I have accomplished a lot of things, and got over a lot of difficult emotional problems. I had drug addictions and attempted sucide twice and i have come to a point where i look at that and it is somthing i have over come greatly. I hope i never become that way again. I wonder if my Mother will ever be able to love me...or if i will be with Chris for ever..All of these questions and thoughts are running through my head constantly now...I just cant wait to walk across the stage."

But yea im out things are looking chipper though."

"event","Today i feel nothing, it's the weirdist thing to have happen to you. Sometimes i wake up and it feels like nothing matters at all. Even if i won like shit loads of money, i think the most you would get out of me is a smirk. Its probably me just being depressed. O well nothing new. Tomorrow is friday..Im hoping to go to Amazing which for if you dont know what that is, its a GIANT porn stor. Wall to walls of  dildo's and other sex enhacing materials. Im not going there because im a sex fiend or anything like that, just because it is so amuzing to go to. I havent evan purchased anything from it, but i might get a porn because they are wicked funny to watch. Then afterwards i think im going to get an other tattoo. What a combination Porn and Tattoo's. Awesome.

"event","Well, Friday again, and what to do....GET DRUNK... Yea im going to get 3 forties and have a couple of shots of something and i will be pleasantly shit faced. Lovely feeling, and the best part it will be around the camp fire. Before I commence the drinking i think Me and Chris are going to go to Guitar Center ( Chris's Heaven on Earth ) and then probably go to other random shops along the way. My head aches still remain, and it is really sucking immense amounts of ass. I might have to go to the doctors again for the 2cnd time this week just to get more drugs or get it checked out again.  I think everything is alright though but still a little concerned."

i'm glad you get these impulses, and that our correspondence is a bit valuable. and it is neat how long the project has been going, yet i don't even know if anyone's read it. i just remembered thinking this idea was interesting--an openfaced penpalling. like it's like reality tv. what normally would be private, but (self) consciously out in the open, but not conscious enough to know if anyone's seen this show. like. a couple notches below the pax network. i think i've said this before.

i just got back from new york. driving late at night, there is less road rage and unnerving traffic, which for me is worth the potential fog and sleepiness. i still got it in me--to do these things (the things being tests of my declining endurance and stamina). i was staying at a sister's apartment, and she lives on a street corner, sharing the four square with two bistros--one french and one italian. the weather was gorgeous and the world cup finals were on (france against italy). these little restaurants had those ""good weather"" walls that open so patrons can enjoy outdoor seating (it's pretty much pedestrian seating, since it is on the sidewalk, with a nice view of the buildings across the street and the delivery trucks that season your food with exhaust). it's very romantic with all these euro-types and wannabes spilling out these ethnic eateries. they were huddled and cheering at the televisions that were playing from behind the respective bars. unified ""oh""s and ""yay""s and raised beer bottles. soccer-hooligan-izing. i enjoy joining in and feeding on the electricity of these little crowds, but the paranoid in me also thinks they're the best spots to set off a good explosion. if anyone wanted. maybe i could start an explosion consultant agency.

p.s. italy won. their crowd was the most enthusiastic.

well welcome back, to arizona. telemarketer is one of those professions that people generally aren't keen on. like lawyers, politicians, and um, tax collectors. if jesus were alive today, most of his disciples would be telemarketers. but as an oddly reserved person, i think telemarketing could teach people like me great skills in cold calling. i told this to a friend who recently did a telemarketing stint, and he agreed that it is now easier for him to approach potential clients. imagine being able to walk into an established gallery, and quickly winning them over. or effectively approaching elephants without them eating you. i figure telemarketing could teach these skills. please share any insights or disagreements or elephant petting stories. anyway, i hope you are weller than meets the eye. what are you taking in school? i think i plan to go to school vicariously through people. 

i'm fine. the band i drum for is good, but because they are concentrating on other jobs and are married/getting married to career women, it is harder to get a unified push to ""going places"". it's more of one of our respective many creative outlets i guess. i'm recording more solo songs and will self-put out an ep with a zine or two, and will be playing more shows. i can trade you an ep and zine for an iguana. 

you know, this reminds me, that a month or so ago i finally accepted that i always end up being the one in a correspondence who writes the longer letter. and this isn't supposed to be any sort of guilt trip--i used to be very self conscious about letter writing lengths, but longness is just plain the most natural for me, and i guess it turns out that lately, just plain the most naturalness is what i tend to go for. well, proper writing skills might help. but yes, i'm cool with the longness. 

the previous weekend, i threw the frisbee around (i am normally not around a frisbee), and although i did surprisingly well, my right boob ached for two days. 

truly, 
manolo

It's nice to come back to this every once in a while.  I am never sure where the impulse comes from, but it seems to never really go away.  It's incredible to me how long this has gone on for, actually.  I love reading back over everything, oh the insight.  Things are not much different.  Or more appropriately, they are.  I've moved yet again back to lovely and blisteringly hot Arizona, and I feel very settled.  I don't think it likely I'll be jumping ship again very soon.  I've gone through several jobs and settled on telemarketing.  I think it's my calling. I still play the synth, although I don't think my talents have expanded much past the original and expiremental key plunking of the first day I tried it. 

How are things for you?  Well, I hope.  I've noticed the multitude of events mellow tiger seems to be participating in, which I take as a good sign?  I've managed to get myself back in school, after much internal kicking and scratching.  The real selling point was having the federal government pay for most of it. Not much else is new, I am looking ecstatically forward to the inception of scarf weather, but that is a little far down the line, especially here in the desert.  But if you like I can always mail you an iguana.

it's always good to hear from the old char. life experiences--i'm currently convinced that even if someone spent their first thirty years in a sterile padded cell, they'll still feel like damaged goods. just for ""being"". it's nice to see you're still one pieced. 

when i was in high school i used to go to shows in nyc and because subways confused me, i'd always have to learn how taxis worked--and then relearn, because they were inconsistant in my life. like forgetting old friends' names and dance moves. i wonder what brought you to those cities. and how you are on the synth.

i hear ipods are all about breaking these days. i never had one. i have breaky hands. 

i haven't been watching many good movies. although, after seeing <a href=""http://www.apple.com/trailers/independent/drawingretraint9/"">drawing restraint 9</a>, i want to see dancer in the dark again. maybe i would suggest palindromes? and tokyo godfathers. off the top of my head. oh, and the five obstructions, if you can find it. 

i was house sitting in new york the last week and a half. it had its good and bads, but i guess that's what they say about the city--the highs are high and the lows are low. 

and then the band i'm in did a radio performance/interview, which you can peruse <a href=""http://www.someonebad.com/mellowtiger/innardsview/"">here</a>. we are idiots.

    Upon returning from a long and arduous journey across several states I decided that the old mantra fits well; ""It's been too long.""  Well of course it has.  I am of course, taking chances in that you still even check this at all.  Although I am sure I could simply track down your myspace in order to bring your attention to it.  Ahh, myspace.... 

     I haven't been up to much, really.  I've aqcuired several new life experiences, such as how to deal with irate new yorkers, and how to translate boston accents, as well as just how it is that taxis work.  I am quite sure that all of these things will come in handy in some life and death situation in my near future.  I am also quite sure that these are things you already know, being as clever and savvy as you are. 

     Advancing like any good girl into the technical age, I bought myself an ipod, and am thoroughly disappointed in that it works about as well as a spoon in a knife throwing contest. Some things just aren't meant to be.  I also bought myself a synthesizer, which thankfully works much better, and allows me hours of wasteful plies at musical eloquence.  Quite nice, I think.  

     I want to watch more movies, you ought to make a list.  


    And how have you been faring, dearest Manolo?  Well, I certainly hope.

i've been recovering from various things and trying to reinvent myself as an illustrator and trader of the foreign exchange. except that i've just came from a room where i attempted to record a second ukelele song. it needs a lot of work and is a case where the experimentation is more about jamming square pegs into holes shaped like gingerbreadmen. everything's forced and it's frustrating and i just want to finish one unfinished song. one day it will manage to be natural. one day. it certainly ain't no ukelele song about scarves and you and playing books like guitars. anyway, there's something about this recording room that makes me ill. i suspect it's something in the air

i've recently visited my little sister and, with it being an art school, i was itching to do her homework. i drew a skeleton for her, which she ended up not using (they were to draw a skeleton). and that is how i adopted a drawing of a skeleton that isn't wanted. i will save enough money to send it to college. it will study poli sci and gym

i'm assuming your philosophy teacher is greek. and i'm going to guess that he is either drunk or tired. through experience i learned that bi(or more)linguals slip into their first language when drunk or tired. 

i was in germany to attend my oldest sister's church wedding, whose reception i have once again dj'd. the actual country wasn't enjoyed so much due to busy-ness and a digestive system's lack of adapting skills. though i did fall in love with a spanish girl on the flight back. or maybe it was the idea of falling in love with a spanish girl on a plane that i fell in love with. i just know that it's rare for me to get along so swimmingly with someone like we did. and the idea of being stuck with someone who, as we unravelled, had many things in common and complimenting and things to talk about. it was natural and unforced and electrifying and i believe we were both so much in love with this idea that we went our separate ways afterwards. it's strange in retrospect. but that was germany to me

over the weekend i found out there was a dead deer laying perfectly in front of where i live, placed around outdoor furniture like it was a mafia threat. it was covered in flies and very ominous. my only two theories is that it got hit by a car and managed to walk itself over (i live by the woods) to die, or that it got hit by a car and the car owners were mischivious and dragged it out here, because they thought it looked nice. i so wanted to at least take pictures of it, but i didn't want to be one of <i>those</i> people. the game commission took care of it and i wasn't questioned. i swear these things are true. and that things like these usually never happens

i just realized that it really has been a while, because i remember your birthday being around election time in november

School has started, and with it comes a flurry of activity that seems to leave me rather tired.  And on most occasions more than rather tired.  I'm only taking ten hours, and only working 35, and only sleeping .3, so really the whole tired bit doesn't make sense.  Anyways, that's all just a cop out for me taking so long to get back to you.  

I am taking a philosophy class with a professor who speaks in the most fascinating way.  I can't really pinpoint it, but I think it has something to do with the strange placement of emphasis in most words, as well as what might be a lisp overcompensated with extreme articulation.  And occasionally, when he's writing on the board, he will accidentally start a sentence in greek.  This is followed by an ""oops, I'm doing it again"" and quite a bit of erasing.  

I drive a lot now, what with the car and license and all, so I've been making driving cd's.  I can't wait for the long distant day when I get a cd player installed in my car and can actually listen to then when I am, in fact, driving.  Mostly I just listen to them before I go to bed and imagine how nice it would be were I driving at the time.

actually, when i wrote the last entry i realized our penpalship was on the yearish side, even tho--as you said--ugh it doesn't seem so long. anyway, i thank you for your participation in this experiment. 

good work on the job. even though you are overqualified, it's a nice place to feel and test out civilization. because then you'd know exactly where the toiletries are. 

i believe cellphones put the final blow in my dislike of phones. it's like trying to have a conversation with a waterfall.

bugs have a vendetta against you? they love me. they all want to hang out with me. enough that people interperet this bug cloud on my crown as me being dirty. like in the cartoons. oh yeah, bugs love me. that's a major reason i'm not an outdoors person. 

your phone will be returned to you, in a burning paper bag on your doorstep. 

i've been listening to the soundtrack to dancer in the dark. i haven't listened to it in a very long time, and it's filled with a sort of nostalgia that conjures up some sweet emotions i can't articulate (oh those were the days, whatever it was). it's a short album, so i have to listen to it at least twice in a row. 

one thing i realized about my germany trip is that they have awful television programing. it's no wonder there aren't as many lazy couch potatoes there. there is a high suicide rate in the international couch potato community (icpc) due to the bad programming. and it makes us look lazy. speaking of which, tonight i saw an hour special where reality tv stars formed teams and competed against each other in various activities. afterwards i felt like i needed to brush my teeth and shower. and go to church followed by a visit to the carwash. and a bath in clorox bleach.

I realized today that we have been writing back and forth for over a year now.  Which is strange, because it doesn't seem like it has been that long.  However seeming in an accurate manner has never been my strong point.  

I had an interview today, for which I was very nervous.  I walked into a cluttered office, and ""Deanna"" asked me to sit down, and then introduced me to her troll doll named ""Harrison.""  It had green hair and bermuda shorts.  Ten minutes later I had a job, which I now feel a little over qualified for.  Oh well, next time, I aim a tad higher than the likes of Harrison and the Kroger company.  

Occasionally when I'm on the phone, which is something I don't like to be on, it will become necessary to find an unquestionable way to end the conversation.  This has worked for awhile, until I used ""my cat is on fire"" twice with the same person, who the second time was already aware that I don't own a cat.  I can imagine that someday I will own a cat, and it will catch on fire when I am talking on the phone with said person, at which point I won't be able to hang up. 

I have a personal vendetta against each and every mosquito in the state of texas, and I think they share the sentiment, because they don't seem to leave me alone.  My uncle told me to eat more garlic, a friend of my aunts told me to bathe in clorox bleach.  I think I'll go buy some bug spray.  

My phone was eaten by a friends dog and I can't get over that.

i'm weirded out by my going to germany this week, but i am: going to germany. there are always these significant events you're supposed to look forward to, and not being able to feel it out and know what to expect is strange. when it comes to visualizing the future--or anything--i am usually able to visualize the gist of it, pretty spot on. details, i can barely remember. i have a friend who always points out when i don't notice when she changes her hair. she says i'm oblivious. my other friend uses the word stoic. i'm just gisty. and ""ish"" is my favorite word. ""yes, your hair was long...ish."" or ""yes, the food was good...ish.""

you need twenty minutes to get ready to write a letter to someone. ten for a high five.

I recently spent twenty minutes getting ready to go somewhere before I remembered that I didn't have anywhere to go.  So I sat on a tiny bench in my front yard instead.  Then I remembered that I haven't written a letter to you in ages, so I came inside.  Five minutes prior to all of that happening, I had just finished a bowl of kix.  

I think my next scultpure might be a bowl of kix.  My first was a swan.  I could make them into a series of peices that seem to have nothing at all to do with eachother.  Then it would be like a 3D representation of House of Leaves.  

Somebody told me that life was incomplete until you've read the Perks of Being A Wallflower.  So I read it, and my life didn't feel very completed.  This seems to me like a sort of false advertising, not only that but it wasn't a very good book. 

I haven't named my car yet, unless ""it's the white pontiac"" constitutes as a name.  I don't know if I really want to name my car, it seems like that would give it too much personality, and then I would feel bad for it when it did otherwise normal car-like things, such as needing oil changes, or running into trees. I had a friend whose nickname came from a hamster.  

I start school soon.  I waited until the very last minute to register, and people keep telling me that it's a sign I'll flunk out.  I don't think that makes much sense.  If I wait longer to worry about school, it will take longer for me to become burnt out on it.  But of course something like that would never happen anyways.  I love school. 

I'm waiting for cold weather.  And for rain.  I bought a pair of rain boots and I'm itching for a reason to wear them.  I think I'll turn the sprinklers on before I leave the house tomorrow.  ""Oh, look at all this water on the sidewalk, I'd better put on my rain boots, guys.""

i'm terribly confused on why i haven't seen your last letter. i apologize. and i apologize again, for old times sake. and once again, i apologize. i think there was a point in this month where i was running all over the place for a week or two, and maybe that could have been it. it was a strange time because there were plenty of little things that i'd normally tell or write to someone, but nothing came out in the end. and all the little nonsense would sink into the backlog of forgotten things. 

the last time i was sunburnt i think i was at the siren festival at coney island. i used to go every year, but i'm not going this year, because last year i degraded into just watching one band, cursing a band that preceded one i wanted to see, but didn't because of having to sit through cursed band, sweating a lot, and spending the rest of the time on the beach, where i bumped into a friend who was trying to avoid me in favor of her much older boyfriend, who was there to be awkward with. it was an alright time, but it's my stamina. it's not what it used to be. i'm sure your sunburnt experience was better. unless it involved manual labor. 

do you have a car name yet? mine is named rockadonna. when we were little, my oldest sister named her hamster rockadonna because she was obsessed with madonna. my car reminds me of the 80s. 

i like the temperature of groceries, the smell, and colors of the items on the shelves. i yearn to film a scene where ballet dancers are wielding knives there. every time i think of a script, i always try to work that scene in. i can imagine the grace of distinct ballet routines used murderously, slipping into aisles, and peering over detergent boxes. i just haven't informed my dancer connection. nor do i have any grocery connection. being in public with a camera still feels embarrassing. 

have you sculpted anything recently? or a long time ago? or do you mean you just like looking at them, especially ones of swans, that are made of kix. i've always enjoyed kix, not just with the taste, but because it fits in the place in my heart reserved for whatever is normally considered ""bland."" it's a non guilty pleasure.

your unfriendly police officer is just jealous of you. she wishes she could dress like you.

because you like kix, maybe the things i tell you will be exciting, and therefore the following thing will fit your old request for something exciting (get ready): a moth just flew on my monitor and the way it moved reminded me of a kitten, because earlier in the day i was playing with a kitten. so i realize that anything that resembles a kitten-like motion will instinctively register in my brain as ""kitten. go pet it.""

i return to the state of texas sunburnt for the first time in ages, as well as deeply enriched by the experience of returning to arizona for three weeks.  or actually, it's more like superficial enrichment, because i'm sure i'll have forgotten about it by september.  i'm working on picking out a name for my car, as well as trying to peddle my talents as a grocery organizing expert to the albertson's conglomerate in the hopes of a new minimum wage pastime that i can complain about on a regular basis.  

somebody came up to a friend of mine, and said ""i wish i could dress like you"" which makes me wonder if clothes are magnetized. 

i've decided i really like sculpture, and swans.  and kix.  i've eaten a bowl of kix everyday for the past week or so.  in fact, i think i will have some as soon as i finish this, which is an incentive to actually do so.  i was interrogated by an unfriendly police officer yesterday for tresspassing, and am now on her personal list of people to stalk until they do something wrong, at which point she will jump out of the bushes and yell 'aha!' while whipping out her handcuffs and citation pad in one fluid and triumphant motion.  i get this impression mainly because i've seen her six or seven times since then, and she gives me this look each time that seems to say 'personal vendetta.'

i don't know if i personally like running around. it's kept me from writing in general. speaking of running around, i ran down boston streets with an impromptu challenge to a race. it was the first aerobic exercise (not counting walking up stairs) i've had in a very long time, and i've won two sprints to everyone's surprise (including me). by the next day, though, my rotting carcas was replaced with the wrappings of acidic aching pain. 

i hope you're enjoying your summer. minus a few fluffy storms, the weather here's been good and i feel guilty about spending it indoors. i'm sometimes glad of being the indoors type, from hearing so many outdoor tragedies like chiggers, mites, and motorcycle accidents. the most adventurous nature activity i've done so far is sit on the trunk of my car. oh, and congratulations on the car.

A thousand apologies for taking so long to get back to you.  I just got back into town 8 hours ago, and in a scant 5 more hours I get on a plane for arizona, and the anxiety encompassing that venture has more or less taken over my life.  That and I haven't packed yet.  

Further, not two days ago I went through the commotion of purchasing my first vehicle, which was exhilerating as well as depressing when expenses I never would have imagined existing seemed to come up quite naturally and invite themselves into a handy portion of my income. There was some coping to be done.  Obviously, this coping takes some time, along with the flying and the traveling and the extreme living that seems to be taking over my previously meandering days. However, I'll be back and done with all this nonsense July 10th, so I promise some quality letter writing then should I not get back to you in the meantime.

i believe i've attended three graduation ceremonies this year. i thought everyone would agree with me that it was a waste of time, so i said something snobby about my boredom as if i were cool, and the reply i got was ""what, i thought it was awesome."" and i decided to just keep things to myself. or just never attend graduation ceremonies. 

but, this dancy thing i've done music for has ended, and even though i was mostly an observer, i got that ""ending of things"" feeling. it's been a while since i participated in an ending of things event. i dj'd the reception party and watched the crowd thin out. the dramatic farewells, awkward goodbyes, or hectic and cold leaves. it was sentimental/adventurous/disappointing to watch.

not that you were necessarily depending on a prompt reply, i'm still sorry you didn't get this before you left. i would have told you to bring back sand, and if it wasn't a sand-related place you went, then the contents of an ashtray.

obsessive [artsy thing]ing can either be theraputic or drive you mad. hopefully it was the former for you, unless the latter is what you were going for. you could show me pictures of your cooking. i took a picture of a mushy eggplant. i put it on my webpage. 

i often feel old except when i feel young, obviously. but i don't think i've ever said ""man, i feel so mediumly aged""

oh yeah, it hailed the other day. i had to wake up to it. there was a heavy storm of it. and i tried to sleep through it. i can't imagine this happening often. if i were to sing a lullabye about hail, it would be because i was being ironic. really, it felt like a standing ovation while being attacked by a winged animal species that shouldn't have wings. like warthogs or aliens.

anyway, i hope the outside of the country was everything you've expected. i have been outside the country. it was exactly how it was depicted in the epcot center.

a standard goodbye,

Well graduation itself is over, I walked across the cord littered stage in a daze, but not so much of a daze as to not notice that they pronounced my name as charcoal without the coal portion.  But, you know, that's okay.  I've got a diploma and a shaky but plausible plan for my future. That coupled with my irresistible ambitious tendencies will surely ensure that I can get over a little name mispronunciation.  

In less than 36 hours I am leaving the country for the first time.  I haven't packed yet, but I'm sure I'll get around to it sometime before the plane leaves.  

Following a fit of obbsessive painting that took place last week, I am embarking on a fit of obsessive picture taking on the theme of things that you eat made to look like things you wouldn't want to eat.  Basically translated that means I was making dinner and something went horribly awry, so naturally I took pictures. 

I feel really old at the moment, and it's a feeling that's actually been around for the past few days, I'm not sure where it's come from or what it's doing here, but until I figure it out I plan to go around complaining about my persistent back pain and forgetting the names of my grandchildren.  

I really do think a terribly emotional song about hail and it's tragedies is in order.  I would bypass the ukelele on this one though, perhaps something more dramatic, like the spoons.  

There would be more to this letter if I wasn't so tired, and if my back wasn't acting up worse than that time back in 59'.  Do you remember that time charlie?

not a typo, but just because

about two months ago i started painting a pair of shoulders that were eventually neglected. but my recent gig in doing music for a modern dance routine has resparked my interest in that area of the body. and to the drawing table it went, from backburner to frontburner. following through is much like pimping in that it ain't easy. as they say. 

congratulations on your ending of highschool. have you told me which learning institution you are headed? that, ending of high school ceremony, thing, is very annoying for me. i actually remember my rehearsal more than the actual performance. because i sort of almost missed the rehearsal. the day before i got into a car accident, where i was fine, the car wasn't, and a person's front yard wasn't. i suppose the next morning i was late for the rehearsal and portions of my class rushed over making sure i was alive, because there were rumors about a hospitalization and/or certain death. the rest of the weekend was a blur, but i wouldn't be surprised if it was my life flashing before my eyes. 

it seems like you get hail a lot in your area. i'm surprised there aren't more terrible songs about hail. maybe i'll terribly record one. the outside went back to chilly here and i wore a scarf today, while helping a friend move a couch from a store into his apartment. it came in a big box and operating the mass of cardboard made me feel like an elf wrestling with a shoebox. the winner was eventually me, although my dignity was bruised. 

thanks about the paintings. i can't tell if they're attractive in person or a letdown. one thing is that they are very touchable, and i will leave it at that.

now excuse me while i attempt to discipline my sleep cycle,

That was a typo, but I decided to leave it just because.  It seems like it's been forever since I've written a letter, and that's because it has, but I'll tell myself that graduation pomp has warped my perception of time flow to alleviate any guilt.  One can't have guilt in times like this.  

Today was the ceremonial rehearsal for graduation, part of which was the apparently traditional custom of pulling aside all unshaven gentlemen and dragging them into a dim room with a razor for some ""cleaning up.""  Fifteen minutes later these same gentlemen will stagger out into the sunlight dazed and often bleeding.  But such is the price we pay for our diplomas.  At least it is if you suffer from facial hair.  This display was followed by the equally as customary 'reciting of the list of innapropriate things you must not do' which is comprised of things like being barefoot, unshaven, scantily dressed, failing to securely pin your car keys in your robe, clapping with too much vigor, and otherwise just generally appearing to be alive.  I am however, thoroughly enjoying the customary twenty dollars that comes with every graduation card sealed with love from people I couldn't remember names of if I were at gunpoint, or in similar peril.  

Today it hailed, but much too tired to be confused, I just bought an umbrella and wore plastic shoes.  That sounds like the start of a terrible poem, but I assure you, that was unintentional.  

I looked over and thoroughly appreciated your website, as I often do the things you send.  I imagine they are even moreso attractive in person.

every time i've attempted to write, they happened to be when i was too sleepy or distracted. my own life has been a mellow flurry of runnings around. recently i've been feeling spacey and mentally slow which developed into the random fear of ending up with frontotemporal dementia, or at least being an airhead. i've been developing fever-like symptoms, too, and i'm only concerned because in a couple of hours i'm driving to boston. i also put up some sort of rough draft of my site with some of my <a href=""http://www.unknownharold.com/unknown/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=72&Itemid=80"">paintings</a>, if you were ever curious.

being able to blank out during ap tests is a feat. i used to do that until school became harder and blanking out and coming out with good grades turned into blanking out and receiving incompletes. i'd probably get an I as a grade. it's actually an F but it'd be an incomplete F, to show that it was incomplete, and that i also failed. 

mid-may was chilly, too, but now, it is warm. trees are lush and wreak of sex. i'm losing layers of clothes--important because those layers would have pockets. i will be forced to carry a purse. outdoor colors seem fakely saturated and optimistic. i'm just waiting for the moment i realize i was just in a daydreamer's fantasy. i will know if i ever picnic with a unicorn. 

i don't know if you told me you wanted to be a perpetual student, but i think i remember complaining about perpetual students. non studenting doesn't have homework, has more control of potential debt, and are allowed to complain about perpetual students. ok, maybe there are less perks. anyway, you must feel chillingly excited of the pseudo unknown

i forgot you were supposed to party on cinco de mayo. i contemplated making up for that by eating mayonnaise

the jail situation only involved shoplifting and back up in paperwork. she did, somewhat as a pseudo outcast, unexpectedly end up becoming prom queen. you must know, <a href=""http://www.unknownharold.com/101/preprom.jpg"">i've dressed her for last year's prom</a>. this year she was supposedly more formal. and supposedly dressed by a gay black guy.

my life is presently a flurry of AP tests and poorly written techno trying really hard to sound like the blood brothers.  i've re-picked up playing the keyboard as a favor for a friend, who happens to have a fatal fondness for poorly written techno of that sort.  but it's nice to be practicing something again.  as for the AP tests, it's just three hours a day of a huge cold gymnasium crowded with perfectly straight rows of desks.  then i blank out and wake up when the test is over.  maybe it's something about the air pressure, i have no idea.  i tried to play your ukelele song on the keyboard to mild success, but of course that was after about an hour of working it out.  

it's awfully cold here for mid may, i still pull off a scarf every day or so.  what keeps me warm is knowing that in less than three weeks i will officially leave that crazy little world known as 'high school' and enter that crazy little world known as 'i'm so tired of school that i am going to make the rest of this summer pay for making me sit through 13 years of it.'  thirteen is an estimate, i turned my brain off four days ago, and i've forgotten how to turn it back on.  of course then there is the going-back-to-school-in-the-fall-for-another-monstrous-trek-of-7-years thing. have i ever told you i think i will be a perpetual student?  it's so much cozier to complain about school when you know half of your life is going to be spent in such a manner.  

today is cinco de mayo.  i plan on celebrating every holiday i can get my hands on.  hopefully i'll get to the point where every day is a holiday, and then all of a sudden you're just celebrating life. with appropriate grammar of course.

today was the first time i worked with a baby. it was fun--i got to pretend she knew what i was talking about, as we discussed her role in the movie. i would point out her blocking in the storyboards, and she would point, too, at the baby in the stroller. ""yes, that is you!"" i'd say, ""now give me strife! more longing!""

i also just got back from a bar in which i played an impromptu set when the originally billed musician came late. i tried to play your ukelele song on a borrowed guitar, but i didn't know how to translate it. scheduled musician came and followed me, as he is a local favorite--skilled with guitar, and playing boring white boy songs like jack johnson covers. 

the tiny little itch over your left eyebrow shouldn't itch anymore, but if it does i could recommend a cream for it. my computer's fan makes loud noises, which i drown out with music, and tune out with thoughts about what i should wear the next day. internet ads with sudden noises make me want to punch something glassy. if only there were a cream for it. 

not to dismiss any dramas of the moment, but maybe it will be giggle-able in the future. any foreboding feelings i feel don't last a week. a day maybe, or when i'm supposed to sleep, but no longer. but maybe it's the short attention span. but you, ma'am, be strong, yet vulnerable wherever you can. 

from what i can assess, you seem like an intelligent young girl, and a lot of times the intelligent types can not ""budge"" because of the pressure and expectations they put on themselves. but as you pointed out, there are plenty of dumb people in good jobs, and they are therefore an inspiration (at least to me). i used to tell my baby sister she needs to dumb herself down in some endeavors. granted, she just spent her spring break in a new york city jail, but those just involve some issues she needs to grow up and get over with. and then i could go back to telling herself to dumb down. or at least recommend a cream. 

see, there was a running gag. but enough of these two damned cents. the other day i saw the documentary, dig, because the rental place didn't have what i wanted, and because of my ex-relationshipial connection to one of the subjects in the picture. it gives an interesting aspect of an underground music scene in the 90s and, of course, the glorification of it. but i give it enough thumbs up.

this long overdue letter has been a tiny little itch just over my left eyebrow for over a week now.  i'm glad i finally have the time to write it, because it was making me antsy.  sometimes computers make incredibly loud and unexpected noises, which results in me usually falling out of a chair or something of that nature. i think some people i know might be taking undue advantage of this information.  

it's been a dramatic week, overall, and there is an anticipatory humid tinge to the air that makes you feel like you are waiting for something unpleasant to happen, but you don't know what it is.  

i've spent the past two weekends job hunting, to no success.  when looking at the masses of uneducated people working well paying jobs, it's hard for me to believe sometimes that i can still be ranked among the unemployed.  i'll just use it as an excuse for massive amounts of summer traveling.

it turned out that i did end up visiting the fabric store, for props in my five minute movie. honestly, it was more intimidating than exciting. the exact fabric was found, but my ignorant and fumbling hands wouldn't justify the price. at least not now. the yard cutting lady asked me what i was making. first, a nervous giggle, then, a word-searching pause. ""basically, an animal."" (what i was supposed to say: ""a dead dog. yes, a dead dog that i decided will be filled with taco bell foods because it is both affordable and gross looking. of course i think it's funny. if i saw someone who thought he could cut corners by using fast food  as animal guts, i would laugh, at least a little bit. you know, i was going to use spaghetti and meatballs first. no no, i'm not morbid--it just happened to involve death. and blood. and guts. but it will be done tastefully. get it? it's tasteful because--yes, i like taco bell. dude, i eat a bean burrito almost every day. yes, i did just call you a dude."")

i want to eventually make a plushie i designed, and hopefully my association with the stuffed cloth doll will be less like <a href=""http://otter.transform.to/plushies.htm"">this</a> and more like <a href=""http://www.friendswithyou.com/catalog.php"">this</a>.

maybe what came out of your poetic mood will have more value and/or use later on. as long as you keep it going. clean rooms are odes to visitors.

i have a coffee mug advertising a pharmacutical drug. yesterday afternoon i found half of this coffee filled cup hanging dangerously off the ledge of my desk. the side of the mug facing me had the phrase ""fast pain relief is in your hands..."" so i took a picture of it. aesthetically the picture was nothing, but the happenstance idea of a suicidal object was so amusing that i had to capture the moment. luckily, the mug was talked down and i was able to finish the rest of my drink.

it's disappointing when you are in a poetic sort of mood, but can't seem to make anything of it.  on the bright side my room has never been cleaner nor more thoroughly organized. some things have many outlets.  i'm pleased to psuedo hear your excitement over fabric and also intrigued by the word 'plushie' which i don't think i've ever encountered before.  

there is always someone out there who thinks something that will cleverly come in handy when you're trying to make a point.  i hope that someone is well paid.  

i assume that women in their twenties also have suspiciously flat hair, and perhaps even wear non-functional hats, in which case they could be duly recognized in movie theaters &c. &c. 

it hailed today for a long time, and i stood outside wondering why it was so tepid when giant chunks of ice were playing a doomed game of ping pong with gravity, piling up in the streets and in front of doors.  i took off my hat and let it fill up with hailstones.  they were white and grey and sort of reminded me of when i used my shoe as an ash tray.  i couldn't think of a good reason to have done that, so i took a picture of it.  i bet half of all pictures are taken for that very reason.

in regards to women in the twenties (i first read it as women in their twenties) having flat hair, maybe it was from hat head. after wearing my hat for a while, someone usually asks me if i got a hair cut or used any products. but it was just a normal snow cap. over the weekend, someone spotted/recognized me in a movie theater because of it, which is funny, because it doesn't stand out or anything. it's also sad because i'm against non functional hats and would never want to be known as hat guy. unless by hat guy they mean ""the one who is against non functional hats""

i've seen many things fall off of the ugly tree, and an unfortunate number of them involve email.  hopefully, you are over-exaggerating.  

the bible code talk is indeed scary, mostly because methodists seem to have a predisposition towards believing whole heartedly in the idea of a cosmic crossword puzzle.  and many of them boast that they are doing theirs in ink.  in fact, me casually asking around the religious community about the bible code phenomena has led to home meetings and church groups springing up entirely devoted to discussing it.  and thusly i learn not to meddle in things beyond my understanding, like religious socialites.

once upon a time there was a worldwide underground community of electronic musicians/listeners who specialized in a lo fi genre often called chiptune or 8bit. it became bigger when some tinkerers home brewed cartridges so they could perform from their gameboy. once in a while someone would try to help the sound cross over to the mainstream, but the 8bit people are protective of it, and also it's too much of an acquired taste for mainstream anyway. malcolm mclaren (of sex pistol fame) was/is one of them, comparing the movement to the births of punk and hip hop. so is beck, and to promote his upcoming album, he hired people to remix some tracks for an ep. so in return, some people from the 8bit community are putting out an unauthorized album remixing his songs. the deadline for the tracks was today. i thought it was the 31st. so all available hours of the day was spent remixing a perfectly fine beck song (i have the gear, but i'm not much of an 8bit musician [but it's fun to pretend]). the track was e mailed in time and it was approved, which is funny, because this piece of music definitely fell off the ugly tree.

This week, which happens to be spring break, epitomizes meandering.  Yesterday I dyed someone's hair, and she paid me by giving me a cellphone, and taking me to see The Jacket.  Much like The Darkness, and like my week, it is a meandering movie.  I really enjoyed Requiem for a Dream, so I will have to look into seeing Pi, along with the hordes of other movies that have been mentioned here every so often, which I completely neglect to remember.  

Investing is the color coordinating of tomorrow.  It's almost spring, and I feel cheated out of the scarf wearing months, they flew by awfully fast. But I won't let a little thing like 80 degree weather keep me from enjoying a good scarf every now and then.  

My name was pronounced very correctly, thank you. 

Sessions in general are indeed very expensive.  Mine in specific are indeed very free.  Because it's research for future careers slash novels slash mental breakdowns, should any such circumstances ever come up. 

I made a shirt, and I'm wearing it, and I have a new phone, and a song, and that is all very satisfying.  I should make some coffee. 

Endearingly, 
Char."

your bible code talk reminded me of the movie pi (directed by the guy who did requiem for a dream [i don't know which one is more popular with people]). but you could put it (or them) on your to do list if you haven't already seen it (or them). saving is for people who don't know how to invest--you don't need a bible to tell you that. although i do remember st. paul preaching this to the ephesians. i don't know which investy book i stole this from, but supposedly there was a survey done around the world on people who moved up in class, and the three things they had in common were going with delayed gratification (as opposed to instant), focusing on a grand vision, and understanding compounding numbers. whereas people who moved down in class had the opposite of those traits. 

oh, your song. it is <a href=""http://www.unknownharold.com/cloudymouth/couchmusic/cloudymouth-thecolorofchimes.mp3"">here</a>. (i hope i said your name correctly) 

a therapist who talks too much about him/herself? i'm also confused. often what i hear people complain about is how it doesn't seem like their therapist is doing anything beyond ""pretending to listen"". i used to be friends with a therapist. he was also a musician and he helped me find my first left handed guitar. although he seemed to be peripherally observant, he didn't seem like a good therapist. your talking one is unfortunate--i imagine sessions (in general) are expensive.

i hope your week wasn't as meandering as mine.

There are assily written quotes about gluttony as well.  I think you can find them in the bible.  I was sleeping on the couch yesterday afternoon, and a program came on to the tv that never sleeps about the ""bible code.""  Essentially, people believe that when you line up all the words of the bible into a grid, it creates a sort of cosmic crossword puzzle that predicts the future.  It ought to tell me whether to save or invest, if so.  That's one of those conundrums of life.  

You really ought to write a song about me with your new ukelele, it's only appropriate, and then I can reaffirm my alter ego, namely char, with the knowledge that it too inspires musical genius.  Then I can put it on my mp3 player and let all the homeless people in deep ellum listen in.  Last time I was downtown a homeless man gave me a book of poetry that he had written, it was terrible poetry, but the cardboard and crayon binding was a stroke of pure intellect.  

It was seventy five degrees outside three days ago, and people wandered around outside in a lost sort of way, tossing aside layers of clothes and puzzily (like puzzled, in adverb form) nudging their neighbors, with a discreet point of the eyes skywards, ""winter?""  

You know those cartoons where the therapist is on the couch, talking intensely about themselves, and the patient just sort of sits there, clipboard poised, in complete confusion?  That was what I did yesterday, it was amusing slash awkward.  

Industrially,

a book i'm slowly reading about the mind quoted a book that quoted people who mispredicted the future. one quote was your winston churchill in 1932 predicting that in 50 years we'd grow parts of animals for food instead of the whole animal. maybe this particular quoted book of quotes is assily trying to teach people that they should only whisper when they predict the future. otherwise someone will write it down and (use it in a future volume).

i have picked up paintings from a new york gallery over the weekend and became more comfortable with what the world refers to as the west side highway. being alone with your thoughts is different than being alone with your thoughts in a car, and it's funny that the only difference is that you're stuck in the same sitting position. travelling wears me out, but oftentimes there's a small moment in the moment where i like the motion. i have come up with a million good ideas on the way home, with most of them soured by the reality of others' opinions. but i'd like to think i'm never dry as long as the gas tank is full.

hair is something on the peripherals of my attention span. people are annoyed because i don't notice hair cuts/recolorings/(un)straightenings, but once a girl i thought was pretty cut her hair short enough for me to notice it really really really didn't work with her, that if i was any more sensitive i would have thrown up. then i became ashamed by the revelation of my shallowness.

there was a skater cut that i had in grade school usually reserved for hip teens and young adults. it made me look androgynous, and not the pretty androgynous that could work in some circles. more like my mom had trouble shopping for clothes with me because the retail girls didn't know what section of the store i belonged in.

although i think i know what you're talking about, you may have to educate me on what linear photography is. and keep me posted on your project.

i spell tommarow like tommarow.

weather poetry. here's something sonnetty. or something:

and on the month i see a pretty cloud
where it fights the fight for one encore more
it pleads to blanket me with it's pale shroud
a yellow light denies with scraping score

denial keeps me there about the yard
the lack of snow has prints of angels mud
and with the sled avoiding what is hard
still grassy stains come with a hint of blood

the neighbor said that i am much deranged
that i should know the season here has changed
that grass is green, the temperature is new

enjoy the warmth, the weeds, the birds, the bees
i decided that i could be with ease
for in the cloudless sky there was more blue

I've been itching for a haircut lately.  Feeling ten pounds lighter would be marvelous, although it may actually be only 9 point 3 pounds, as I haven't much to cut off.  I've always been wary of venturing shorter than chin length.  A friend of mine, whose hair was past his shoulders, cut his hair yesterday.  It's now only about three inches long. Remarkably, he looks even more feminine with short hair than he did with long.  

My current obsession is a photography project I'm working on.  With all the window space I have, glass ceilings and all, I decided to embark on a room-encompassing photo mural based on the concept of linear photographs.  I have about three panels done, and I'm rather pleased.

i actually happened upon the end of that iron chef episode, when i got home from a house with interesting carpeting. i always thought of that iron chef (who specializes in french cuisine) to be a favorite among children. he has a mascotty aura about him. spreadsheets representing imaginary payroll is not something i happened to do. what was this for?

because i watch scrubs all the time, i cut zach braff some slack and settled for garden state being a really good directorial(amongst his other jobs in the movie) debut. the cinematography was really nice and i have the feeling that the end, when it came to his decisions as a director, was all about finding excuses to make out with natalie portman.

my hair cutting went terrible. but i feel ten pounds lighter. you'd think that cutting your hair most of your life would improve your scissor skills along the way. but when you don't have any ideas on what to do, you might as well get hit in the head with a jet engine. still, you feel ten pounds lighter.

as someone who ended up along the lines of the jack of some trades/master of none, i think i'd be successful concentrating on one thing. even though i had an idea for one, i probably don't have the commitment and stamina for a novel. weather related poetry, maybe.

i think i was disappointed by garden state.  i can't really say for sure, but what started out as intriguing ended predictably, and emotions that would have been better shown subtly were crammed in a blaring way into the last ten minutes or so. 

there are five minutes left for chef-with-unpronouncable-name to put together a dish involving pears and chocolate.  it's riveting, I am continually distracted.

new york art openings, interperative drumming, conor oberst basement style recordings, and now comic strips.  what shall you tackle next?  perchance a novel, or a volume of weather related poetry.  

months after the original post, i actually listened to the links you left me, which i enjoyed, and now reside in my outdated mp3 player, to keep me company along with patti smith and pachelbel when i sneak out of driving school for a cigarette.

i have been scourging the area for a spanish guitarist, amongst other performers, because i'm coordinating the music for my sister's wedding reception. who would have thought i'd find a spanish guitarist in the middle of pennsylvania? but i did. maybe somewhere in your land there is someone looking for a raspy voiced band of swing dancers for their wedding. 

the latest movie i've been pushing is called ""the saddest music in the world"". it came out in 2003 (or was it 04) and, being unfamiliar with this canadian director, the movie was like nothing i've experienced before. it turned out he did another movie that i had many chances of seeing, but ignored those opportunities. 

i use chocolate soymilk for my cereal.

because of the cold weather and my recent obligation to run around outdoors, i have been getting hat head from the hat i always wear. now my hair looks like it was spraypainted on, instead of the unkempt business it used to run. 

some old friends showed up at my art opening and we had a nice time afterwards, but if the actual reception itself was jewelry for pigs, it would have been boar ring. (that's not an old saying. it won't even make it as a new saying). i hope your work sells.

You've got me there, with the boredom part, my yes.  It's all I can do to keep myself from flying to Blockbuster right this minute.  There are three dollars and seventy five cents in my pocket, and I've almost finished with my frosty glass of soymilk.  All that stands between me and taxi driver is the completion of this letter.  And calculus. 

My glass ceiling is, as a matter of fact, slanted.  It also leaks just a tad, i've noticed, in the four solid days of rain that have plagued this town.  No snow for us, just frigid rain.  

An art opening in New York you say?  I would be worried about not making it to that as well.  But I would be much more worried about where to procure the nearest and tastiest snow cone.  And I'll have you know that I painted a swan, and it is currently on display in upper A hall, Allen High School.  Someone even offered me five dollars for it.  That makes me an artist, I'm told.  

Well, basically the scheme goes like this:  My likewise messy haired, gravelly voiced friends and I share an unfounded fondness for making a lot of noise, swing dances, and the potential prowess of electric tambourines in the music industry.  Or something like that. Therefore the only logical option is to form a band.  It's a complicated process, but it makes perfect sense on some level.

having a glass ceiling makes a nice ""it is snowing"" indicator. especially if it was on a slant, so it would be meter-like. or if it made snow cones. the snow storm here had me trapped inside for most of the days. heating is half working so i dress in layers indoors. i worry about not being able to drive to my art opening in new york this week. and i also think damn, i'd like some snow cones. 

backtracking with prebirth movies and music is hard for me to do, but there are times when boredom or the clueless hours spent in the rental store piques my curiosity in the classic and legendary. i've taken film classes before, and this boredom saved me. whenever the instructor would name drop or make references to different scenes, i was right with him. i sometimes wonder if i learn things just to get the jokes. they say the 70s was the best decade of movies, and they have a documentary to prove it, or at least try to. but i'd recommend taxi driver, and may your boredom be the bait

although i do have documented proof, you don't need to picture me as a drummer. i would just look confused or bored. thinking about old movies. according to my friend's girlfriend, where schooled drummers would be technical writing, i would be poetry. i guess that's why he kept me. it wasn't for the hair. 

you will have to elaborate on this swing dancing scheme. hardly ever do i hear of schemes that involve swing dancing.

Glass ceilings epitomize interesting. Especially when it is raining.  Or windy.  Or basically anytime, unless your glass ceiling happens to be situated right underneath a brick wall.  The only downfall is that you are exposing yourself to anyone flying overhead with high powered infrared binoculars every time you change your clothes.  But I'm a risk taker, I don't mind.  

I've never seen taxi driver.  Or heard of it for that matter.  But I can now add it to a long list of things I've never seen or heard of in the interminable hope that someone will one day look at it and gasp at my severely lacking knowledge base in all things sociocultural.  Or so I can, you know, cross things off and actually accomplish them.  

I never pictured you as a drummer, it involves too much flailing, I suppose, for someone who walks eastern u.s. streets in scarves, while striking up fruitless conversations with the homeless.  But I can see the need for suiting up for such and occasion.  Although fixing your hair seems beside the point, unless you are setting it up to be appropriately mussed later on.  

I am actually learning to swing dance right now.  It's all a part of my grand scheme.  Next I have to round up four other people with really throaty voices, and we will all stand on stage screaming, playing the tambourine, and simultaneously swing dancing.  That is, if I ever figure out which direction is right without having to ponder it for more than two beats.

i guess my suiting up for musical instrument playing involved patting my hair down before answering the door. if only patting your hair down and a tie was considered formal dress--i would be semi formal. it was a friend who i started playing drums for, in a band i'm helping. it's funny because i'm not a drummer, but he says i get the job done. one day i'll make the time to pursue my real passion. sleeping. in the meantime, my arms are a sloppy ballet of pathetic gyrations. do you dance? i don't. i don't have anything against it, i just don't. and that's socially unacceptable. i could admire good carpentry, but don't call me a party pooper for not building a birdhouse. ""oh come on, no one's watching,"" one might say. ""just do whatever."" next thing is i lose a finger and all i have to show for it is a log with a hole in it. or a dance move that resembles offroad driving. or ugly drumming. anyway, the original point. bowler hats wouldn't be appropriate in don't dress like james bond villains conventions. 

as you described your hair i could only picture a girl i once saw at a christmas show that slowly transitioned from garage rock to indie pop to rockabilly by the time the night ended. well, i think i saw her at an art show, too. they both had the hair, and they both had children. art show girl looked significantly older i think. either they're related or they have the same stylist. and children. hopefully you fixed your hair by now, unless vague black and blonde is what you were going for.

and yes, one of the funny things i like about the openfaced idea is that although it's naked in the sense of a normal conversation being in the public domain, there's the nakedness in the open acknowledgement that we're still strangers who willfully (unless you feel like your arm is being twisted. if so, do say ""so"". i mean, so) engage in a pseudo long term conversation. it's a sense of being inversely honest by allowing the other to present themselves however they want, which i imagine to be different than the normal assumptions of internet socialness. at least i think. i think. i guess. what i'm saying is that more people should be openfaced. 

my new years traditions were just as broken, but i, too, wanted to weird it out as much as the holiday weirds me out. i wanted to do something like excuse myself from the gathering and insert myself into something small, like a cupboard. an attempt to look as sad and pathetic as i could to ring in the new year. people would watch the ball drop, and i would try not to suffocate. instead it involved making the artsy types have a push up contest and running around cozy neighborhood streets with stalks of roman candles. things i've never done on nye. for a holiday i hate, auld lang syne is my favorite holiday/tradition song. there's something about the melody that makes any moment beautiful. even a moment in the cupboards

it's people like you who reinstill my faith in mankind. people like you and <a href=""http://otter.transform.to/plushies.htm"">him</a>. i've borrowed a collection of dvd's reenacting churchills speeches and whatnots, but it was during a time of fatigue and couldn't sit through anything that involved someone talking. feel free to sell me on reconsidering. it also feels like more people should learn economy. 

maybe exposing my knees would be cruel to society. maybe doing so would involve the freedom of moths. you know, since i haven't taken off my pants since 1428. a time when moths were as abundant as the H in H2O. of course. 

ok now i have to suit up for playing a musical instrument.

It is a potluck, or bring some cans to donate to the poet's pantry. we play for an hour then it is an open mic for poetry and music. 

Hosted by Thom the World Poet it's always an event to remember, AND it's early so you can have a whole evening afterwards!

would LOVE to see some of your shiny faces

Artist George Sabra (you may have seen some of his stuff at Austin Green Art's Earth Day or the Maker Faire, or countless other places), seeks volunteers to help him make a large art piece for this years Maker Faire:  

He is making a freestyle sculpture from recycled granite and marble pieces, it will be 14 ft tall, 6 ft wide, 6 ft dip.

He is working at the Enchanted Forest every day, 8 hours a day until it is finished.  He would like to have volunteers to help this vision happen, esp if they are interested in learning about stone work and promoting the vision of using recycled materials to make beautiful art.

 Check out his website here:

Or you can wait a coupla weeks to get the second batch, which is printed on recycled paper and is a tiny bit different than the Special Edition that was created just for the CD Release party (the special edition is in a traditional jewel case).

For locals, we'll soon have them in Antone's records (look for details of an in-store soon!) and Waterloo, and also for everyone we will have online sales eventually too, just wanted you to have options if you need them.  If you pick one up at a show, it's just $10 *and* you get to see us live, NOW with all new songs... We've got a lot of new stuff up our sleeve, it's very exciting!

Saturday night was a dream, what a cool show!  Some awful drama at the end with the venue, that place is seriously shady, but it did not dampen the high of how wonderful it felt!

Thanks to all who helped, to all that came to see us, it was a historic night in The Lovers evolving career, if only I could wear what I was wearing that night every single day! :-) sigh.  Back at work today, when do I get to be a rock star *all the time*?"

Tejas Web invites you to the fifth annual Brighid Faire, an artisan's
faire and ritual honoring the goddess Brighid.

Creators and vendors of beautiful crafts, musicians and actors, and
creators of magic will join together for this special event. The
Faire is in The Yard at The VORTEX from noon-5pm, with a ritual
honoring Brigid at 2pm.

At this time of year we celebrate and honor Brigid, goddess of
poetry, healing, and smithcraft. We celebrate this point between
winter solstice and spring equinox, a time in Central Texas where we
begin to look ahead to all of the beauty blossoming in our lives.

Ritual for Brighid will be modeled on actual ancient practices as
recorded by Irish folklorists. Join us as we celebrate the Threshold
Rite, welcome the sacred Brideog, and honor the Goddess who gives
nourishment from her own body as we turn the wheel.

Tejas Web is a loosely woven group of women and men who cultivate
magical community, joining together to turn the wheel of the year
with public rituals and events. Tejas Web's rituals and events have
been ongoing for more than 12 years in Central Texas. Tejas Web
events are clean and sober (no drugs or alcohol, please).

Those interested in vending at this event should contact:
Deanna at spankingrace@yahoo.com

Those interested in performing (musicians, entertainers, bards,
actors) at this event should contact:

Below is an excerpt from Martin Luther King's sermon on April 4, 1967. 

Five years ago [John F. Kennedy] said, ""Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable.""

Increasingly, by choice or by accident, this is the role our nation has taken -- the role of those who make peaceful revolution impossible by refusing to give up the privileges and the pleasures that come from the immense profits of overseas investment.

I am convinced that if we are to get on the right side of the world revolution, we as a nation must undergo a radical revolution of values. We must rapidly begin the shift from a ""thing-oriented"" society to a ""person-oriented"" society. When machines and computers, profit motives and property rights are considered more important than people, the giant triplets of racism, materialism, and militarism are incapable of being conquered.

  Here's the original announcement!
   
  Jan 27th 6-9pm at La Madeleine on Lamar and 34th street.
Dale and Sherry will be there. These people run Make magazine and Maker
 Faire and have I mentioned what wonderful people they are? I am so

I want us to talk about what went right at Maker Faire. And how we can
 fix it the things that weren't optimal.
I would really appreciate a bunch of Maker's there as well as
 volunteers.

I also want to discuss how we can better integrate local sponsorship of
 artists here in Austin for doing some large projects.  I have created
 a wiki - so that we can post main topics here. I have seeded it with
 some points of discussion!

"event","copied From the interdictor journal. (hope that's ok, but this has me beside myself)

Have you heard about Jamie Leigh Jones? She was gang raped inside the Baghdad Green Zone in July 2005 while she was working for the Halliburton subsidiary KBR Inc, which has support contracts with the US military. Here's the latest:
(this has a youtube imbedded and I don't know how to do that, you can go to the interdictor journal or search youtube)



Jones told committee members that on her fourth day in Baghdad some co-workers, who she described as Halliburton-KBR firefighters, invited her for a drink. ""I took two sips from the drink and don't remember anything after that,"" she said. The next morning Jones woke up groggy and confused, and with a sore chest and blood between her legs. She reported the incident to KBR and was examined by an army doctor, who confirmed she had been repeatedly raped vaginally and anally.

The doctor took photographs, made notes, and handed all the evidence over to KBR personnel. ""The KBR security then took me to a trailer and then locked me in a room with two armed guards outside my door,"" Jones testified. ""I was imprisoned in the trailer for approximately a day. One of the guards finally had mercy and let me use a phone."" Jones called her father in Texas, who called his representative in Congress, Republican Ted Poe. Poe contacted the State Department, who quickly sent personnel to rescue Jones and flew her back to Texas.

The rape was so brutal she is still undergoing reconstructive surgery, Jones said.

Jones tried to get her case resolved first through KBR channels, then through the US Department of Justice. When neither course seemed to work, she gave an interview with ABC television news. KBR has been silent on the matter, though according to ABC News the company circulated a memo among employees signed by company president and CEO Bill Utt saying that it ""disputes portions of Ms. [Jamie Leigh] Jones' version and facts.""

Jones said that she knows of at least 11 other women who were raped by US contractors in Iraq.

Jones' KBR contract however included a clause which prevents her from suing her employer, Poe said, which will likely force her into arbitration, which he described as ""a privatized justice system with no public record, no discovery and no meaningful appeal."" There are many laws that the Department of Justice (DOJ) ""can enforce with respect to contractors who commit crimes abroad, but it chooses not to,"" Democrat Robert Scott said. The DOJ ""seems to be taking action with respect to enforcement of criminal laws in Iraq only when it is forced to do something by embarrassing media coverage,"" he added.

""This is outrageous that we even have to be here today,"" said Conyers, adding that it shows ""how far out of control the law enforcement system in Iraq is today."" There are 180,000 civilian contractor employees in Iraq, including more than 21,000 Americans, Conyers said. While the DOJ says it is committed to law enforcement in Iraq, ""they can't even give us one example of a prosecution where the victim was a civilian contractor employee in Iraq,"" Conyers added. Poe was equally caustic. The department's silence on the case ""speaks volumes about the hidden crimes in Iraq,"" he said.

Salt Lake City Mayor says ""We won't take it anymore!""

October 27, 2007 City & County Building Salt Lake City, Utah

Address by Mayor Ross C. ""Rocky"" Anderson

Today, as we come together once again in this great city, we raise our voices in unison to say to President Bush, to Vice President Cheney, to other members of the Bush Administration (past and present), to a majority of Congress, including Utah's entire congressional delegation, and to much of the mainstream media: ""You have failed us miserably and we won't take it any more.""

""While we had every reason to expect far more of you, you have been pompous, greedy, cruel, and incompetent as you have led this great nation to a moral, military, and national security abyss.""

""You have breached trust with the American people in the most egregious ways. You have utterly failed in the performance of your jobs. You have undermined our Constitution, permitted the violation of the most fundamental treaty obligations, and betrayed the rule of law.""

""You have engaged in, or permitted, heinous human rights abuses of the sort never before countenanced in our nation's history as a matter of official policy. You have sent American men and women to kill and be killed on the basis of lies, on the basis of shifting justifications, without competent leadership, and without even a coherent plan for this monumental blunder.""

""We are here to tell you: We won't take it any more!""

""You have acted in direct contravention of values that we, as Americans who love our country, hold dear. You have deceived us in the most cynical, outrageous ways. You have undermined, or allowed the undermining of, our constitutional system of checks and balances among the three presumed co-equal branches of government. You have helped lead our nation to the brink of fascism, of a dictatorship contemptuous of our nation's treaty obligations, federal statutory law, our Constitution, and the rule of law.""

""Because of you, and because of your jingoistic false 'patriotism,' our world is far more dangerous, our nation is far more despised, and the threat of terrorism is far greater than ever before.

It has been absolutely astounding how you have committed the most horrendous acts, causing such needless tragedy in the lives of millions of people, yet you wear your so-called religion on your sleeves, asserting your God-is-on-my-side nonsense - when what you have done flies in the face of any religious or humanitarian tradition. Your hypocrisy is mind-boggling - and disgraceful. What part of ""Thou shalt not kill"" do you not understand? What part of the ""Golden rule"" do you not understand? What part of ""be honest,"" ""be responsible,"" and ""be accountable"" don't you understand? What part of ""Blessed are the peacekeepers"" do you not understand?

Because of you, hundreds of thousands of people have been killed, many thousands of people have suffered horrendous lifetime injuries, and millions have been run off from their homes. For the sake of our nation, for the sake of our children, and for the sake of our brothers and sisters around the world, we are morally compelled to say, as loudly as we can, 'We won't take it any more!' ""

""As United States agents kidnap, disappear, and torture human beings around the world, you justify, you deceive, and you cover up. We find what you have done to men, women and children, and to the good name and reputation of the United States, so appalling, so unconscionable, and so outrageous as to compel us to call upon you to step aside and allow other men and women who are competent, true to our nation's values, and with high moral principles to stand in your places - for the good of our nation, for the good of our children, and for the good of our world.""

In the case of the President and Vice President, this means impeachment and removal from office, without any further delay from a complacent, complicit Congress, the Democratic majority of which cares more about political gain in 2008 than it does about the vindication of our Constitution, the rule of law, and democratic accountability.

It means the election of people as President and Vice President who, unlike most of the presidential candidates from both major parties, have not aided and abetted in the perpetration of the illegal, tragic, devastating invasion and occupation of Iraq. And it means the election of people as President and Vice President who will commit to return our nation to the moral and strategic imperative of refraining from torturing human beings.

In the case of the majority of Congress, it means electing people who are diligent enough to learn the facts, including reading available National Intelligence Estimates, before voting to go to war. It means electing to Congress men and women who will jealously guard Congress's sole prerogative to declare war. It means electing to Congress men and women who will not submit like vapid lap dogs to presidential requests for blank checks to engage in so-called preemptive wars, for legislation permitting warrantless wiretapping of communications involving US citizens, and for dangerous, irresponsible, saber-rattling legislation like the recent Kyl- Lieberman amendment.

We must avoid the trap of focusing the blame solely upon President Bush and Vice-President Cheney. This is not just about a few people who have wronged our country - and the world. They were enabled by members of both parties in Congress, they were enabled by the pathetic mainstream news media, and, ultimately, they have been enabled by the American people - 40% of whom are so ill-informed they still think Iraq was behind the 9/11 attacks - a people who know and care more about baseball statistics and which drunken starlets are wearing underwear than they know and care about the atrocities being committed every single day in our name by a government for which we need to take responsibility.

As loyal Americans, without regard to political partisanship -- as veterans, as teachers, as religious leaders, as working men and women, as students, as professionals, as businesspeople, as public servants, as retirees, as people of all ages, races, ethnic origins, sexual orientations, and faiths -- we are here to say to the Bush administration, to the majority of Congress, and to the mainstream media: ""You have violated your solemn responsibilities. You have undermined our democracy, spat upon our Constitution, and engaged in outrageous, despicable acts. You have brought our nation to a point of immorality, inhumanity, and illegality of immense, tragic, unprecedented proportions.""

""But we will live up to our responsibilities as citizens, as brothers and sisters of those who have suffered as a result of the imperial bullying of the United States government, and as moral actors who must take a stand: And we will, and must, mean it when we say 'We won't take it any more.'""

If we want principled, courageous elected officials, we need to be principled, courageous, and tenacious ourselves. History has demonstrated that our elected officials are not the leaders - the leadership has to come from us. If we don't insist, if we don't persist, then we are not living up to our responsibilities as citizens in a democracy - and our responsibilities as moral human beings. If we remain silent, we signal to Congress and the Bush administration - and to candidates running for office - and to the world - that we support the status quo.

Silence is complicity. Only by standing up for what's right and never letting down can we say we are doing our part.

Our government, on the basis of a campaign we now know was entirely fraudulent, attacked and militarily occupied a nation that posed no danger to the United States. Our government, acting in our name, has caused immense, unjustified death and destruction.

It all started five years ago, yet where have we, the American people, been? At this point, we are responsible. We get together once in a while at demonstrations and complain about Bush and Cheney, about Congress, and about the pathetic news media. We point fingers and yell a lot. Then most people politely go away until another demonstration a few months later.

How many people can honestly say they have spent as much time learning about and opposing the outrages of the Bush administration as they have spent watching sports or mindless television programs during the past five years? Escapist, time-sapping sports and insipid entertainment have indeed become the opiate of the masses.

Why is this country so sound asleep? Why do we abide what is happening to our nation, to our Constitution, to the cause of peace and international law and order? Why are we not doing all in our power to put an end to this madness?

We should be in the streets regularly and students should be raising hell on our campuses. We should be making it clear in every way possible that apologies or convoluted, disingenuous explanations just don't cut it when presidential candidates and so many others voted to authorize George Bush and his neo-con buddies to send American men and women to attack and occupy Iraq.

Let's awaken, and wake up the country by committing here and now to do all each of us can to take our nation back. Let them hear us across the country, as we ask others to join us: ""We won't take it any more!""

I implore you: Draw a line. Figure out exactly where your own moral breaking point is. How much will you put up with before you say ""No more"" and mean it?

I have drawn my line as a matter of simple personal morality: I cannot, and will not, support any candidate who has voted to fund the atrocities in Iraq. I cannot, and will not, support any candidate who will not commit to remove all US troops, as soon as possible, from Iraq. I cannot, and will not, support any candidate who has supported legislation that takes us one step closer to attacking Iran. I cannot, and will not, support any candidate who has not fought to stop the kidnapping, disappearances, and torture being carried on in our name.

If we expect our nation's elected officials to take us seriously, let us send a powerful message they cannot misunderstand. Let them know we really do have our moral breaking point. Let them know we have drawn a bright line. Let them know they cannot take our support for granted - that, regardless of their party and regardless of other political considerations, they will not have our support if they cannot provide, and have not provided,principled leadership.

The people of this nation may have been far too quiet for five years, but let us pledge that we won't let it go on one more day - that we will do all we can to put an end to the illegalities, the moral degradation, and the disintegration of our nation's reputation in the world.

Let us be unified in drawing the line - in declaring that we do have a moral breaking point. Let us insist, together, in supporting our troops and in gratitude for the freedoms for which our veterans gave so much, that we bring our troops home from Iraq, that we return our government to a constitutional democracy, and that we commit to honoring the fundamental principles of human rights.

In defense of our country, in defense of our Constitution, in defense of our shared values as Americans - and as moral human beings - we declare today that we will fight in every way possible to stop the insanity, stop the continued military occupation of Iraq, and stop the moral depravity reflected by the kidnapping, disappearing, and torture of people around the world."

She has taken all the wishes collected on her wish trees from years and years and buried them below a beam of light that will shine upwards.  Imagine Peace is inscribed in 24 languages around the outside.  She says that if you make your own wish tree they will feature it on the website.  I am thinking of reviving my Tree of Knowledge and turning it into a wish  tree for the EAST event.  If I can make it work, then it will happen.

I am so inspired by this.

Thursday September 13th.  Hot Mama's is at 2401 E 6th
St (on 6th near Pedernales):
http://www.myspace.com/hotmamasespresso

Free show.  The official gig times are from 7:00 to
9:00pm.  I predict that we will actually play from
more like 7:23pm until 9:11pm, but that's just my
personal guess.

You can get a taste with a few songs here:

She signed off her note by saying (and i quote) ""I like it!""

YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Her question was if we could actually make our stage BIGGER, and if we had included the performers in our budget (yes, it's actually right there on the budget spreadsheet, oh and I DO know a band, huh...)

My crazy, last minute, rush down there on the last day pulled together proposal may have WORKED....
OH MY!

I was having the worst day at work.  I said to myself, ""I will not let this job make me feel like a peon, I have a rich full life""

and then I checked my email and had the mail from her.

I am so excited.

crazy crackhead friends won't answer their phones!!!!!!!!!!
so I'm posting here because I'm about to BURST!!!"

See, I was writing it out in pieces in a notebook, but I wasn't spending that much time sitting down writing in this notebook. So, I decided that I would put bits and pieces of it in the notebook as they come to me and put parts up here as well.&nbsp; So, I decided that today I am going to post my introduction section to my memoirs.&nbsp; The book is called <strong>Tube Socks and Bandannas: The Odyssey of a Completely (ab)Normal American Boy</strong>.&nbsp; The introduction goes as follows</font>:<br /><br /></font>

"event","Not going to lie, tonite was the biggest waste of time in my entire life.  Sienafest is/was this weekend and I usually try to avoid it like the plague.  I mean, I drink occasionally, but I have no real desire to spend a whole day getting trashed, watching the campus get fucked up, and hurdling over puddles of vomit in the hallway.  For one nite only however, I decided to stick around for at least partof Sienafest.  The main reason I did this was because my roommate had to be on RA duty Friday nite/Saturday morning and we figured we would chill since he couldn't really drink or hang out with his other friends.  As it turns out, I think I ended up seeing him for like five minutes since he did in fact hang with his other friends before he had to work.  But whatever, its not that big of a deal in the grand scheme of things and contrary to what he thinks I think, I'm not mad at him.  He's a good guy and I'm glad he had a good time with his posse.

I guess the real reason I am kind of disgruntled has to do with girl troubles.  There is this girl that I am kind of interested in and I thought maybe she was interested in me, but I don't think I was right at all.  There is a serious lack of communication between the two of us that is certainly not conducive to the development of a relationship of any sorts, even if its just that of friendship.  But that is what happens when the only avenue of conversation is instant fucking messenger because you rarely see said person and don't know her phone number.  Despite that hindrance, it seemed like a few weeks ago everything was floating along ok.  I even overcame my own insecurities and doubts to ask her if she wanted to hang out.  She said yes (surprisingly to me), but plans fell through when she ended up having to work until 1:30 in the morning.  She seemed pretty apologetic and it kind of sucked that plans fell through, but shit happens (or snakes on a plane or whatever that new stupid fucking phrase is) and I pretty much got over that.

From that point on, I would say that things entered what I refer to as a non-relationship.  I would leave a message here and there, to no response.  I was kind of perturbed about that, but the J-Cat told me that she was having issues with her ex-boyfriend or something.  While I can understand how much that kind of shit sucks, I tried my best to at least be a nice guy/friend type to see if she wanted to just talk or something, but nothing arose from that.

By this stage (which was like the week before Easter), I was feeling pretty down in the dumps because it felt like I wasn't getting outright rejected or getting any positive reaction either.  Then, over the Easter Break it hit me that there is really no reason to be upset about anything.  I made a decision that I would just essentially be who I always am and not really let stupid bullshit like relationships (or lack of) get me down.  I decided that I would just let the chips fall where they may.  As it turned out, it seemed like this new perspective was working, as we talked earlier in the week and I felt things went well.  She said she didn't really plan on drinking or even hanging out around campus during Sienafest.  I extended the invitation for her to hang out here and watch a movie or something and I thought that she seemed pretty receptive, although noncommital, to the idea.

Now, I pretty much figured the whole time that she wasn't going to stop by.  I'm nothing if not a realist.  She said that she was either going to hang out with her friend who had to work all nite or go hang out at a friend's house off-campus.  There really wasn't anything that would make me really believe that she was going to stop by tonite and I was right.  It was one of those rare instances where I was not too happy to be correct.  Even though I knew she wasn't going to stop by, I kind of hoped she would.  See, I just thought it would be a pretty pleasant surprise if she was to stop over, even if it was just to simply say hello.  I also figured that hey, even if she didn't stop by, at least I would be hanging out with the roommate and that would be fun.  Too bad that didn't really work out either.  Instead, I basically sat around all nite and did pretty much nothing.  The most time consuming part of my evening was watching part of WWE's Bret ""The Hitman"" Hart DVD.

If there is a lesson to be learned, its that I really need to chill the fuck out and not expect so much from people and really stop trying to hang out with this girl.  I mean, it seems like I let myself get all wound up over and for nothing and I really don't want to do that.  As I finish typing this, its like 3 am and I think I'm going to bed.  Maybe I'll update again soon....."

"event","I still haven't written anything for my memoirs lately, as I have been busy with school and being the Easter Bunny. My state of mind has been pretty hectic lately, but I don't really feel like writing about it right now. However, if some things don't change or my mind is still racing, I'll let all three of you who still read this know what the deal is. Instead, what I'm going to write about is something else that has been on my mind, but has nothing to do with me personally. It's a music review/commentary. I figured that since I want to write so fucking much, I might as well mix it up a bit and try something other than my political rants. The topic is Guns N' Roses, who have been in the news a lot lately with rumors abounding over a tour and maybe the release of Chinese Democracy (Which I'm about to explain). So this will basically just read like an article or cd review (hopefully). <br /><br />Since the release of 1993's punk cover album <em>The Spaghetti Incident?,</em> Guns N' Roses has essentially been silent on the music scene.&nbsp; Axl Rose has become the JD Salinger and Howard Hughes of the music scene, spending the last decade in silence and seclusion.&nbsp; In 1995, Axl was promising a new sound and direction for the band, with the music becoming more industrial ala Nine Inch Nails.&nbsp;&nbsp;While working on the new album, called <em>Chinese Democracy</em>, every original member of Guns, minus keyboard player Dizzy Reed, has either been fired or quit the band.&nbsp; Bassist Duff McKagan, drummer Matt Sorum, and beloved lead guitarist Slash eventually formed the band Velvet Revolver with former Stone Temple Pilots frontman Scott Weiland and released their debut album in 2004.&nbsp; The album was fairly successful, but it was criticized as uninspired and lacking.<br /><br />In 1999, Axl and his new Guns N' Roses came out of hiding when their song ""Oh My God"" was released on the soundtrack to the film <em>End of Days</em>.&nbsp; This song received mostly negative comments from the critics, who disliked the techno/industrial undertones in the song and considered it by and large a waste of time and studio time.&nbsp; Around this time, there was a release date confirmed for <em>Chinese Democracy, </em>but it was shelved at the last minute.&nbsp; After this, Axl wasn't heard from again until 2001's Rock in Rio, where Axl returned to the stage with his brand new Gunners.&nbsp; In this band were former Replacements bassist Tommy Stinson, former Nine Inch Nails touring guitarist Robin Finck, former Primus drummer Brain, and the mysterious Buckethead, a seven-feet tall man who wears a mask like Jason and a KFC bucket on his head.&nbsp; The ""return"" of Guns N' Roses created quite a stir and received a great deal of publicity and rumors of <em>Chinese Democracy</em>'s release swirled again.&nbsp; Unfortunately for Guns fans, this wasn't meant to be and Axl went back into seclusion.<br /><br />In 2002, Axl and the new Guns made a surprise appearance at the MTV Video Music Awards.&nbsp; This was really the first time that the mainstream audience had been exposed to the new Guns N' Roses and they were in for quite a shock when they saw Buckethead, the gothic Finck, and Axl Rose sporting a baggy football jersey and braided hair instead of his trademark kilt and red mane.&nbsp; Shortly after this a world tour was launched, but to no avail.&nbsp; Axl missed the first show on the tour and ticket sales were not impressive, due to a lack of an album to support and any real buzz about the band.&nbsp; This started to change at a show in Madison Square Garden that received a great deal of critical acclaim, but the tour went up in flames when Axl failed to show up at the next show in Philadelphia.&nbsp; After this, a second cancelled show, Clear Channel pulled the plug on the tour with half the dates remaining.&nbsp; Any hopes of the new album were dashed and Axl wasn't heard from again until he issued a press release concerning the departure of Buckethead in 2004.&nbsp; This release stated that news on <em>Chinese Democracy</em> would be forthcoming.<br /><br />Nothing again was heard about the album until recently, when four new songs were leaked on the internet.&nbsp; As these leaks made the rounds, Slash gave an interview in which he stated that the new Guns album was going to come out soon.&nbsp; Axl and his former bandmates made the news through lawsuits directed at each other.&nbsp; Axl and the band have confirmed 20 shws in Europe this summer, but no one knows if he'll show up or who is even in the band.&nbsp; Buckethead's departure leaves a gap in the lead guitar position and no one is really sure if anyone else has come or gone, since Axl made anyone who worked on <em>Chinese Democracy </em>with him sign a gag order.&nbsp; Current rumors say that Slash is rejoining the band, but no one has come close to confirming that.&nbsp; Rumors and news releases have stated that the album was coming out March 28, but that obviously hasn't happened.&nbsp; Another rumor from Clear Channel Entertainment has it coming out in April and others are stating that Axl is planning to release it in September.&nbsp; Regardless, the buzz around Axl and Guns N' Roses has never been stronger.<br /><br />Since no one really knows what will be on the album, what follows is a review of new songs that have been played live on the 2002 tour or leaked over the last few months.&nbsp; Some of the songs have been confirmed by Axl in <em>Rolling Stone</em> in 2000 and in January of this year as being on the album.&nbsp; A couple of the songs have been confirmed as&nbsp;not appearing on the album, but no one is really sure until the album is released (if it ever actually is released).&nbsp; The reviews that follow start with 1999's ""Oh My God"" since it may or may not also appear on the album, and ends with the latest leak, ""Catcher in the Rye.""<br /><br /><strong>Oh My God - </strong>As stated before, this came from <em>End of Days.&nbsp; </em>None other than guitarist to the stars Dave Navarro plays the lead guitar on this.&nbsp; Although this track received a lot of flak from music critics, I enjoy it.&nbsp; It has the vintage Axl Rose wail and a pretty heavy riff that sounds distinctly Guns N' Roses, but with industrial overtones.&nbsp; There is a bit of a techno dance groove underneath the riff that is pretty interesting.&nbsp; Lyrically, it isn't amazing but overall I think it is a decent modern rock track.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure that if it was released now, it would be received much better.&nbsp; When it came out in 1999, the argument could be made that Axl was trying to stay current with other industrial acts, but now this sound would be pretty unique when compared to other popular rock tracks.&nbsp; While it is a pretty good rock song, there really isn't anything overly memorable about it that would make it a ""great"" song.&nbsp; I personally would give this track an 8 out of 10.<br /><br /><strong>Silk Worms - </strong>This song was performed at Rock in Rio in 2001.&nbsp; The version I am revieiwing is the Rio one.&nbsp; It wasn't written by Axl, but by keyboardists Dizzy Reed and Chris Pittman.&nbsp; Dizzy has since said in interviews that this track will not make it onto <em>Chinese Democracy</em> and rightly so.&nbsp; It is easily the weakest of all the new tracks.&nbsp; It is drum and keyboard based, with a pretty cool guitar hook in the chorus.&nbsp; Lyrically it is lacking and it is pretty stupid.&nbsp; I mean, most Guns N' Roses songs are about being wronged by a woman, but this one is pretty stupid.&nbsp; I don't hate this song, but it is definitely not album worthy.&nbsp; It is probably a 5 out of 10 at most.<br /><br /><strong>Rhiad and the Bedouins - </strong>This song was performed in 2001 at Rio and early on in some of the 2002 shows.&nbsp; The version I have is from a Las Vegas show in 2001 or 2002.&nbsp; Rumor has it that this won't be on the album and that's a bit of shame.&nbsp; It has a great funky, heavy guitar line to it that is vintage Buckethead.&nbsp; Lyrically it isn't amazing, but the vocals on it are compelling and it is always nice to hear Axl scream his ass off.&nbsp; The solo is cool and you can hear the industrial influence on it in the keyboards.&nbsp; It has an old Guns feel to it, but the new direction is also evident.&nbsp; I would give this song about an 8 out of 10.<br /><br /><strong>Madagascar - </strong>This song was played at Rio, the VMA performance, and at each show on the 2002 tour.&nbsp; My version is from a 2002 show.&nbsp; This song has grown on me over time.&nbsp; It is keyboard driven and more of a midtempo epic.&nbsp; It really doesn't sound much like older Guns N' Roses material musically, as it has more of a techno feel to it than a song like ""November Rain"" or one of the older ballads.&nbsp; There is a cool guitar solo on it and Axl has some pretty good vocals on it, but the middle of the song has this weird breakdown with a bunch of random voice clips from movies.&nbsp; All in all, this song manages to successfully pull off that epic feel and I would give it an 8.5 of 10 since it is such a compelling listen.<br /><br /><strong>The Blues - </strong>This song has been performed live since Rio and the version I have is from a 2002 show.&nbsp; This song is very much in the vein of the classic ballads like ""Estranged"" and ""November Rain.""&nbsp; It very much retains that classic GNR sound, with a melodic piano melody and Axl lamenting on unrequited love.&nbsp; Of the new songs, this is probably the best in terms of lyrics.&nbsp; This is probably the most traditional&nbsp;Guns N' Roses sounding song, as the industrial sounds are very muted and the keyboards are only providing ambient background noise.&nbsp; If the album ever comes out, this song will definitely be a single.&nbsp; I'm a big fan of it, so I would give it a 9 out of 10.<br /><br /><strong>Chinese Democracy - </strong>This is another one that has been performed live consistently since Rock in Rio.&nbsp; I have 2 versions of this song, one from Rio and one from 2002 and they both sound slightly different from one another.&nbsp; I would assume the 2002 one is more like the version that would appear on the album, as it sounds more refined and familiar to the band than it did at the Rio show.&nbsp; This one really shows the direction Axl is going in musically.&nbsp; The riff is pretty heavy and the keyboard plays along with it, giving it kind of a Nine Inch Nails vibe.&nbsp; Overall, this song rocks pretty hard, but it isn't particularly memorable and it certainly shouldn't be a single, as it is kind of simple lyrically and melodically.&nbsp; However, it sounds like it will be a pretty good album track and I would give it an 8 out of 10.<br /><br /><strong>Catcher In The Rye - </strong>This was the fourth demo track from the album leaked.&nbsp; It has a vibe and melody&nbsp;that is similar to a band such as Queen.&nbsp; That could be because Brian May of Queen does the lead guitar work on it.&nbsp; Allegedly, this song is about John Lennon's assassination as through the eyes of Mark David Chapman, his assassin.&nbsp; This track is heavy on the piano and melody and Axl keeps his screeching off the track and it sounds like he's really trying to have a harmony.&nbsp; Overall, this track doesn't really sound much like any of the other new songs or the old material, not that that's a bad thing.&nbsp; I think this is a pretty good song and I could definitely see it getting radio play as a single.&nbsp; I would give it an 8.5 out of 10.<br /><br /><strong>I.R.S. - </strong>This was the first studio demo to be leaked.&nbsp; It is kind of a shock at first, as it starts off mellow and features a programmed drum loop.&nbsp; After about a minute in, Buckethead comes in with a pretty sick guitar riff that livens up the song and leads into Axl screeching like its still 1992.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it stays kind of midtempo for most of the song.&nbsp; When the song rocks and Buckethead gets to let loose, ""I.R.S."" is at its best.&nbsp; Lyrically, it isn't exactly brilliance.&nbsp; Axl is railing against a woman who broke his heart and is swearing to send the government after her in revenge.&nbsp; However, it is nice to hear that ridiculous Axl Rose screech.&nbsp; I would give this song a 7.5 out of 10.&nbsp; I rated it that low because, even though I enjoyed it, it really isn't that great a song other than Axl's vocals and the brief passage where Buckethead gets to bring the rock.<br /><br /><strong>There Was A Time -&nbsp; </strong>This is the second leaked song.&nbsp; It opens with another programmed drum beat and a keyboard melody, but the guitar kicks in around the chorus.&nbsp; It stays mid-tempo throughout and seems like a logical follow-up to the older material.&nbsp; There is a lot of keyboard/electronics mixed in with the regular band, so there is a lot to digest in the song.&nbsp; Axl, of course, is railing about another woman who's done him wrong.&nbsp; I do think that this song would be a bit better if there was less going on in it, but as is, this demo is a pretty good song.&nbsp; It could definitely be released as a single once it is cleaned up.&nbsp; I would say it is an 8.5 out of 10.<br /><br /><strong>Better - </strong>""Better"" was the third leaked track, and is by far the best of the bunch.&nbsp; This one most successfully combines rock with the electronic/industrial themes that Axl was going for.&nbsp; It opens just above mid-tempo, with Axl singing about a failed relationship.&nbsp; The opening riff has a good melody and it really sounds like Axl means what he's singing.&nbsp; When the song hits the chorus, the industrial themes are evident and it sounds similar to ""Oh My God.""&nbsp; It then goes back to the original melody in the verse, which is catchy and pleasing.&nbsp; Then, the song hits the chorus again and goes into an obvious Buckethead passage.&nbsp; The riff gets really heavy and a shredding solo hits, leading into a heavy breakdown with Axl screaming like he hasn't in years.&nbsp; I personally think that one of the reasons this song is so good is the combination of a good melody by Axl and noticeable playing by Buckethead, as parts of the song sound just like his playing.&nbsp; If I was Axl Rose, this would be the first single because it would definitely be a hit.&nbsp; I would give this song a 10 out of 10.&nbsp; It has it all: melody, heaviness, interesting lyrics and some shredding from Buckethead.<br /><br />Only time will tell if <em>Chinese Democracy</em> will ever see the light of day.&nbsp; I always had my doubts, especially after the 2002 tour debacle, but it seems like there really is a good chance that it might come out this year.&nbsp; It's hard to say that any album is worth a 13 year wait, but I think that if&nbsp;it actually&nbsp;comes out it will easily be the best rock album this year.&nbsp; I liked the Velvet Revolver album, but the demos alone are of a better quality and much more interesting to listen to than the entire VR album."

"event","Well, my grandfather died today.  It wasn't a surprise; we knew this was going to happen soon.  I found out earlier today that he was in pretty bad shape, bad enough shape that today was the first time I have ever seen my father cry.  Then, my brother, mother and I went out to get dinner and we got the call that he died.  I was waiting for this day for a long time, so I was taking it pretty well.  Joe almost passed out, the poor kid.  Even on the ride home I was doing fine, until I called my grandparents in Vegas to tell them the news.  Telling people you love that a person you all loved just died is the toughest thing I have ever done and I really hope I don't have to do it again.  At the tail end of that call, I lost it for a minute.  Then, later on in the ride, I cried some more just reminiscing about the times years ago when he lived next door to us and we used to go over there daily.  There are a lot of really great memories of the times spent at that house.  When I got home, I did the only thing that I thought was right.  I went to my room and I put on one of his old Ella Fitzgerald cds that I borrowed from his house a long time ago.  I just sat down, listened to the music, and wept harder than I have in a long long time.  And really, honestly, I feel a lot better about it.  It was more of a cry for the memories and the loss, even though I hadn't spent a siginificant amount of time near him in ages.  And really, its ok now.

Needless to say, the Vegas trip has been postponed a few days until after the funeral service.  I guess I need to get a suit tomorrow for the wake and the funeral.  My dad asked if I would be a pallbearer.  I said yes.  I've never done that before, so let's hope I don't fuck it up.  It's weird because this is the first time in my life that someone I've been close to has died.  I've never been to a wake or funeral before, so this is going to be a first.  I guess I'll write about it in here at some point this week.

Alright, I'm done.  I'm tired and I have to be to work at 7 am.  I'll update again soon."

"event","<P>I felt like updating my journal today, but I don't really have anything of value to write about.&nbsp; Also, I'm kind of bored as I type this, so what you get is this entry.&nbsp; The last time I did a mixtape entry, I just listed the songs and my thoughts on them.&nbsp; This time, I am going to do that, but maybe hopefully shorten my thoughts and add a rating to each song.&nbsp; Ratings will be done on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being an atrocity and 10 being superfucking awesome.&nbsp; There might be some songs that I rate lower than others, but still like more and that's because my ratings also factor in the expectation I have in terms of quality from each musician.&nbsp; At the end, I'll compile a score based on the ratings and give the cd an overall&nbsp;percent rating.&nbsp; This pattern will hold true for all mix cds and any cd reviews I decide to do.&nbsp; I have way too much time on my hands.</P>
<P>The theme of this mix is songs that have come out within the past 3 years:</P>
<P><STRONG>1. Megalomaniac by Incubus - </STRONG>I put this on here because I hadn't heard it in ages and it happens to be one of my favorite Incubus songs.&nbsp; How can you not love a song that references Elvis AND Jesus at the same time?&nbsp; But yeah, this song has a lot going for it:&nbsp; great hook, great vocals, great lyrics.&nbsp; I almost bought this cd for the sake of this song, but when I previewed the album it seemed that the other songs didn't match with the quality.&nbsp; This one is 8.5/10</P>
<P><STRONG>2. The Hand That Feeds by Nine Inch Nails - </STRONG>This is the newest NIN song, off their album that just came out this week.&nbsp; It's really catchy and there aren't many people who can combine catchy with intensity both musically and lyrically like Trent Reznor.&nbsp; Just like classic NIN songs, it has catchy lyrics and music, but still has that venom to its lyrics.&nbsp; While it ain't Head Like a Hole, it certainly lives up to expectations.&nbsp; Let's say 8.5/10</P>
<P><STRONG>3. Your Time Has Come by Audioslave -</STRONG> The newest Audioslave single, off their soon to be released album.&nbsp; This song sounds like a cross between MC5 and Hendrix, with the usual Morello guitar sound.&nbsp; It's a pretty good rocker and I'm sure radio will play the shit out of it.&nbsp; It sounds a tad different than the rockers off their last album, with less of the distortion and effects that Morello was known for in Rage.&nbsp; Let's give it 7.5/10.</P>
<P><STRONG>4. Metalingus by Alterbridge - </STRONG>Alterbridge is the band that is basically Creed, but with a different singer.&nbsp; I came across this song because it is currently being used as the theme song for WWE wrestler Edge.&nbsp; That being said, this song is a lot better than anything Creed did.&nbsp; The band isn't plodding and boring&nbsp;like they were on Creed songs and the singer is much more dynamic than Scott Stapp.&nbsp; Actually, the vocalist sounds a lot like Jeff Buckley and his vocals on this song remind me a lot of the&nbsp;Buckley song Eternal Life.&nbsp; The singer has an amazing range and the band really steps up on it.&nbsp; I still won't buy the album, but I won't hate on them like I did with Creed.&nbsp; Let's go 8.5/10</P>
<P><STRONG>5. Little Sister by Queens of the Stone Age - </STRONG>This is the first single off their recent release Lullabies to Paralyze.&nbsp; At first I didn't like this song, but it has since grown on me.&nbsp; It isn't anywhere near the quality of the songs on Rated R or Songs for the Deaf, but it is catchy and fun, two qualities lacking in a lot of newer rock bands and their singles.&nbsp; It has a garage rock vibe going with the classic QOTSA sound, but the rhythm section is lacking the heaviness of the last two albums.&nbsp; Still, its a solid rock song and I'll go with 7/10</P>
<P><STRONG>6. Better Now by Collective Soul - </STRONG>In a more just world, this would be a major hit on the pop-rock stations.&nbsp; It's insanely catchy and has the big crunchy guitar riffs that Collective Soul is known for.&nbsp; Lyrically and musically its a bit simplistic, but it's a great song to hear them play live and it's a fun one to blast and sing&nbsp;along&nbsp;to.&nbsp; It really isn't much more than slick produced, great sounding power pop, but&nbsp;sometimes thats OK.&nbsp; Let's give this one 8/10.</P>
<P><STRONG>7. Breakin' by the Music - </STRONG>I stumbled onto this song accidentally this week when flipping through the music choice channels on the cable box.&nbsp; I loved their first single, Take the Long Road and Walk It, and this one is just as good.&nbsp; It combines a trippy, psychedelic riff like early Jane's Addiction and combines it with Zeppelin.&nbsp; The singer does a better Perry Farrell on this song than Perry Farrell has done lately.&nbsp; The lyrics aren't brilliant, but they are fun and let the vocalist show off his range.&nbsp; This is a fun, groove oriented song that one can dance to, if one is so inclined to get up and get down to a song.&nbsp; I'm going to give it 8.5/10</P>
<P><STRONG>8. Almost by Bowling for Soup - </STRONG>I don't mind Bowling for Soup, but I'm not in love with them either.&nbsp; 1985 was good at first before it got killed by radio and VH1.&nbsp; This song isn't stand out, but since I saw the video I've had it stuck in my head.&nbsp; It sounds really familiar and the reason why came to me recently; Butch Walker co-wrote and produced their album and this song has the same exact melody as his ""#1 Summer Jam.""&nbsp; I mean, the chorus and the bridge are the same exact thing, except on his own song, Butch played it acoustic and had different lyrics.&nbsp; This is one of the lower rated songs on the mix with a 6.5/10.&nbsp; I enjoy it and all, but I anticipate tiring of and loathing it within a month, since it isn't a particularly brilliant piece of power pop.</P>
<P><STRONG>9. Hiro's Song by Ben Folds - </STRONG>Ben Folds has pretty much mastered power pop.&nbsp; Most of his uptempo songs are pretty clever and witty and this one is no exception.&nbsp; It's about an older man who is dating a younger woman and it is your typical solid Ben Folds song.&nbsp; The quality of musicianship on this song is good and I don't really have that much to say about it.&nbsp; It's a 7/10</P>
<P><STRONG>10. Hell Yeah by American Hi-Fi - </STRONG>This is the end of my power pop trilogy here.&nbsp; Another song written and produced by Butch Walker, a catchy gem that makes up for the fact that I can't stand American Hi-Fi.&nbsp; Seriously, I think they suck.&nbsp; But this is well produced and written power pop that has Butch Walker's hands all over it.&nbsp; Seriously, since when did American Hi-Fi know how to harmonize or craft a tight pop piece?&nbsp; I'm gonna go with 7/10</P>
<P><STRONG>11. Be Yourself by Audioslave - </STRONG>This is the Audioslave song that is being overplayed on radio and tv.&nbsp; I can't hold that against it though; I'm a sucker for Chris Cornell and the Rage guys.&nbsp; It is similar to Like A Stone with its intro, but it holds its own as a power ballad.&nbsp; Cornell's voice is front and center on this one and he doesn't disappoint.&nbsp; It isn't amazing, but I still like it more than Your Time Has Come.&nbsp; This puppy gets 8.5/10</P>
<P><STRONG>12. Tangled Up in Plaid by Queens of the Stone Age - </STRONG>This one is also off Lullabies to Paralyze and is one of my favorite tracks on that album.&nbsp; This one won't get played&nbsp;on the radio, but that's ok.&nbsp; It is&nbsp;classic QOTSA, with an unsettling rhythm, thick riffs, and weird vocals.&nbsp; Vastly superior to Little Sister, it gets a 7.5/10</P>
<P><STRONG>13. Sick Love Song by Motley Crue - </STRONG>Far superior to that Simple Plan written trash that the Crue released as the first single off their greatest hits.&nbsp; This song is by far the best song Motley has done since Dr. Feelgood.&nbsp; It has the trashy, brash, cock rock sound that makes the Crue one of my favorite guilty pleasure bands of alltime.&nbsp; If you like/love Motley Crue, this song fucking rules and if you can't stand them, you'll probably hate it.&nbsp; In my not so humble opinion this song fucking rules and I'm going to give it a 10/10.&nbsp; It is everything one wants from Motley Crue and you can't ask for more than that.</P>
<P><STRONG>14. Cigaro by System of a Down - </STRONG>This is off their soon to be released album, Mesmerize.&nbsp; System of a Down is one of my favorite bands and this song owns.&nbsp; It rocks and it has all the flair and personality that you expect from this band.&nbsp; The lyrics are nuts, the music is frantic and that creepy guitarist has some vocals on it.&nbsp; This one scores high, 9.5/10</P>
<P><STRONG>15. Beverly Hills by Weezer - </STRONG>This song has started to grow on me the more I hear it.&nbsp; On it's own, I guess it's ok.&nbsp; Compared to the songs on the Blue Album or Pinkerton, this song is pretty weak.&nbsp; I'm not a huge fan of the sound Weezer has had over their last few albums.&nbsp; It just hasn't clicked for me like their first two albums.&nbsp; That being said, their singles are usually catchy and enjoyable.&nbsp; This song is no different, it has just taken me longer to like it.&nbsp; The lyrics are kind of funny and after a while the song is tolerable.&nbsp; I'm going to give it a 7/10</P>
<P><STRONG>16. General Attitude by Collective Soul - </STRONG>This is probably my favorite track off their newest album, Youth.&nbsp; It has more in the way of lyrics than most of the things they have released as of late.&nbsp; It has a catchy chorus and crunchy guitars like most of their songs.&nbsp; I tend to enjoy the lyrics to this one more than their other newer songs, even though they aren't particularly deep or complex.&nbsp; It's still fun to sing along to and one can dance to it as well.&nbsp; 8.5/10</P>
<P><STRONG>17. Alive and Amplified by the Mooney Suzuki - </STRONG>Ah, the garage band that is actually really good.&nbsp; Too bad they don't get played or hyped on the radio by anyone other than Little Steven.&nbsp; Simply put, the Mooney Suzuki are the best of the whole garage band craze of the last few years.&nbsp; They have put out some great garage rock albums over the last few years and&nbsp;this song (and the band in general)&nbsp;rocks without being pretentious, which is more than you can say about the Strokes.&nbsp; Not as blatantly derivative as Jet and much more naturally raw than the Strokes and the Hives, the Mooney Suzuki rule.&nbsp; This song, while slickly produced, has that retro rock feel of the 60s and 70s, but without that feel that you've heard it before.&nbsp; I'm gonna give it an 8/10</P>
<P><STRONG>18. Dirty Little Thing by Velvet Revolver - </STRONG>This is their current single and even though I own the album, it took a while for me to like this one.&nbsp; I think thats because its the 12th song on the cd and it sounds EXACTLY like track 1, Sucker Train Blues.&nbsp; However, on its own I enjoy it greatly.&nbsp; It has that familiar sound of GNR and STP, but it still manages to not sound old and tired.&nbsp; It has a lot of energy and is a perfectly acceptable piece of arena rock for this decade.&nbsp; 7.5/10</P>
<P><STRONG>19. BYOB by System of a Down - </STRONG>This is the current single for the new System album.&nbsp; I love it.&nbsp; It has several changes in tempo and tone.&nbsp; Some times its metal, some times its funk, and at others its punk.&nbsp; And, it takes some serious shots at President Bush, which is always a plus.&nbsp; It has the classic System sound, but if you're a fan you can tell that they have grown musically over the past few years.&nbsp; And, like in Cigaro, the creepy guitarist has some time to sing.&nbsp; This is easily my favorite new rock single this year and gets a 10/10 without any doubt.</P>
<P>Well, that gives this mix a rating of 81%.&nbsp; If this was a normal cd review I would close up with my thoughts on the album as a whole and whether or not I think that percentage fits with what I think is a fair rating.&nbsp; But this isn't a normal mix and I'm not going to do that.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Wow,&nbsp;that was a long and boring entry.&nbsp; That's&nbsp;what happens when I have too much time and too little to do.&nbsp; Since I'm leaving for Vegas on the 16th, I'll try to think of a really good entry or two to post before I go.&nbsp; I mean, what if I die or don't come back?&nbsp; I don't want my last entry to be this one.</P>
<P>Seacrest, out</P>"

"event","So, I was looking through my past journal entries and I get the feeling that the quality of them has really dropped off since around December.  It seems like a lot of earlier entries were much better in terms of quality and articulation and hostility.  Rather than the typical commentary on the news or my planned glance at Bob Jones University, I decided that right now would be a spectacular time for some free floating hostility.  My target: WRIT320, or Journalistic Writing.

Sweet Jesus, there are some real fucking numbskulls in this class.  I think it makes sense when considering that the bulk of the class are fairly affluent youth from Manhattan and Long Island.  First off, they waste class time by asking stupid fucking questions.  One student, a Chappequa (sic) native who serves ""Bill"" (Clinton) at the bar in his town, is writing a paper about how some students got thrown out of their townhouses for damages and that this was unfair.  His reasoning for it being unfair was that ""their townhouse wasn't even the worst one there, they just got caught.""  Yeah, because they just happened to be the ones that got caught with fucking up their property means they were treated unfairly.  Boo fucking hoo.  Then, he interviewed the heads of Residence Life and told the class that he was going to smite them in his paper because they wouldn't give out specific information about the students he was writing about.  Instead, they gave him general information about rooming and what constitutes a severe enough violation to have their housing rights revoked.  He was all up in arms about how they wouldn't give him sordid details for his paper.  NO shit they wouldn't tell you about the private lives of people that aren't you!  They aren't allowed to divulge someone else's private information fucko, it's against the law!

Then there are the girls in the back with the horrid downstate drawl that makes my left eye close up in anguish and pain.  In class the professor will explain something, then one of these two will ask EXACTLY WHAT THE PROFESSOR JUST SAID!!!  This is guaranteed to happen one to three times a class and each time, one of them is still really confused about what to do.  You know, because staple all three copies of your final paper together and submit them with any other notes or research you think would be handy is such a tough fucking concept.

Last week in class, we were talking about the Pine Hills student ghetto in Albany.  Basically, its cheap housing and while there are problems there with the quality of housing and other residents, the bulk of the problems are caused by drunk dickhead SUNY Albany and St. Rose students.  Residents and Albany natives have been concerned over this for years because their property is devalued and vandalized.  Well, last weekend Mayor Jerry Jennings went barhopping with the heads of UAlbany and St. Rose to see the area for themselves and ask students what they think.  The Long Islanders felt that this was great and I, being the misanthropic cynic I am, said that Jennings only did it for PR because he's up for reelection and he knows that this area has been complained about since the Reagan years.  The Long Islander behind me blamed the sketchy Albany residents for the trouble, but I pointed that the broken bottles and garbage all over comes from the students living there.  He rationalized it as ok because up at his townhouse, kids do that all the time and maintenance just cleans it up.  At this point, I was ready to reach behind me and crush his larynx on general principle.  How fucking whitebread and irresponsible can you be that you blame landlords for not picking up the garbage left by the students!?!?  In the real world, in real housing as they are living in, maintenance doesn't come by and just pick up the garbage.

Then, this student suggested that if the local residents are upset at the filth that they just move out.  Another Long Islander concurred.  He said that these people, most of whom are older and have lived there most of their lives, should just take $100,000 or $125,000 and put 90% down on a new home and move out of the area.  First off, how does this person not realize that most people don't have that much money on hand for anything?  Secondly, if these people happened to have that amount of cash in reserve, do you think that they would be living in a fucking ghetto?  Third, why should they have to leave the places that they have lived in for decades?  It's not their fault that their new neighbors are shitheads who care more about getting fucked up and pissing on their lawns than they do about keeping their neighborhood safe and clean!  He also said that maybe these students don't mean to ruin things, but when they get drunk they do.  He said that hey, he doesn't advocate property destruction but when he's drunk he makes a mess!  What a class act.

I always thought I was the one out of touch with reality, but I think the Long Island Connection has me beat.  They honestly have no concept of personal responsibility nor of how the real world really is.  Going through life thinking that there will always be someone to clean up your mess or that you have enough money to do whatever you want is sickening.  I really think that its more than just a Long Island thing.  It really seems like no one around my age cares to at least have respect for things.  That whole ""Hey its college, lets party and not care"" perspective is fucking bullshit and how someone can think that its ok to fuck up an area is beyond me.  I would love to see how they would react if I showed up in Long Island and pissed on their lawns, blasted absurdly loud music, and vandalized their country clubs.  They would probably treat me pretty shitty, but only half as shitty as I would love to treat them.

Every day around some of these people makes me think that selective population control is the way to get things done."

"event","<P>Wow, I didn't realize that I hadn't updated this since the 7th.&nbsp; At first, I was thinking that I've waited so long because that Ultimate Warrior story just overwhelmed me so, but then I remembered I was writing an entry last week and I somehow clicked out of the page and lost my entry.&nbsp; To compensate, all seven readers of this livejournal are going to get a special treat:&nbsp; part of this entry will be some commentary on the news and the other part will be personal, emotional, and poignant as I discuss the goings on in my personal life.&nbsp; Maybe, I'll conclude with some plans about the state of this journal in the future.&nbsp; So, with that note, let's begin with the personal part of the entry,....</P>
<P><STRONG><U>The Life of Shahen</U></STRONG></P>
<P>Well, this past weekend was my return to work at Thacher Park.&nbsp; While the tasks I completed were benign, this working weekend brought great joy and some turmoil.&nbsp; The joy was of course due to the fact that Andrew ""Fucknuts"" Bogardt, my immediate supervisor, worked his last weekend at The Park.&nbsp; Anyone at Thacher who has come into contact with Fucknuts has regretted the moment they met him.&nbsp; He's a thoroughly unlikable, self-important, unintelligent, bumbling prick who thinks he is important because his father and brother give money to the Governor.&nbsp; He achieves promotions by getting his brothers to use their contacts to advance him up the state park food chain and now he is leaving my neck of the woods to be a supervisor at Palisades State Park.&nbsp; Fucknuts likes to think of himself as this perfect image of what a supervisor should be, but he's inept and he kisses a ton of ass.&nbsp; Then again, I guess he is a perfect candidate for a promotion in the New York State civil service system.&nbsp; But, regardless, Sunday was Fucknuts' last day at the park and I won't have to deal with him again (God willing).&nbsp; Now, the negative was that I still had to deal with him over the weekend.&nbsp; The moment that caused great turmoil and strife involved a conversation I had with him on Saturday before I went home for the day.&nbsp; Fucknuts decided that he wanted to take the time out of his busy life to tell me that the park manager was going to hire an adult to supervise me, the other patron assistants, and the seasonal staff (Pool House kids).&nbsp; He then went on to tell me that because I am ""different"" I don't have what it takes to be a supervisor.&nbsp; He told me that even though I'm mature, I am prone to laziness (citingthat twice all summer I didn't do a good job with cleaning bathrooms), don't take things seriously enough to supervise, AND since I like to joke around and provide rays of sunshine to everyone's day that no one under me would respect me.&nbsp; Coming from a guy who was hated by the full-time and seasonal maintenance staff, respect was really something that irked me.&nbsp; I think it's hard to respect and take orders from a dude who has worked in maintenance his whole life and spells it ""MAINTAINCE"" on a consistent basis when he writes project lists for the seasonal staff.&nbsp; Thank goodness he's gone now; otherwise I would have ended up either a) not coming back or b) slitting his throat, and pushing his car and dead body off the cliff.</P>
<P>Thursday nite I saw Collective Soul at Northern Lights.&nbsp; They have been one of my alltime favorite bands since I had short hair and was yet to procure the ability to grow a sweet beard.&nbsp; I saw them the last time they toured back in 2001 and I loved it, as they played most of my favorites and generally kicked ass.&nbsp; The show this past Thursday was excellent; they sounded just as good as they did back in the day.&nbsp; My only gripe with Collective Soul was that they played a lot of songs off the new album which, although decent, I do not enjoy as much as a lot of their earlier material.&nbsp; In a future entry I will discuss their new album and go into greater detail with my problems with the songs, but for now I will say that they put on an excellent show in terms of energy and quality.&nbsp; Plus, they did a cover of ""Squeeze Box"" that was far superior than the&nbsp;Who's original&nbsp;and the cover that Poison released as a single a couple years ago.&nbsp; Highlights:&nbsp; Listen, Precious Declaration, December, Better Now, Squeeze Box.&nbsp; A lot of other people who were there didn't enjoy the opening band, but I thought Sirsy was awesome.</P>
<P>Finally, my dad told me that my grandfather's demise is in the near future.&nbsp; I haven't really talked much about it here because 1) Most of the time my family doesn't know he's in the hospital and 2) I didn't feel like discussing it.&nbsp; I guess part of the reason that I don't really discuss it is due to a few reasons: I was super close to my grandfather until a few years ago, I feel guilty over not seeing him often since he's been in a nursing home, and because I have tried to push it as far from my mind as possible.&nbsp; But, I guess now is as good a time as any to start to address it.&nbsp; I guess that he hasn't been eating lately and has been hospitalized a few times.&nbsp; Evidently his kidneys are beginning to fail and his mental health is starting to deteriorate, as happens to someone who has the symptoms of Parkinson's, has slight Alzheimer's, and is in his mid-80s.&nbsp; According to my father, his life is expected to run its course in about a month so I ""better go while he still recognizes"" me.&nbsp; I'll go into greater detail about this situation in the future, when I have the time and the desire.</P>
<P>Now, onto the news.....</P>
<P><STRONG><U>Headlines and Headlies</U></STRONG></P>
<P>DNC chair Howard Dean made the headlines today by discussing how the Terri Schiavo case will hurt the Republicans in the long run.&nbsp; Now, I agree with Dean that the GOP overreached and used this issue to push their morality.&nbsp; However, enough beating a dead horse (no pun intended).&nbsp; Schiavo has been dead for a few weeks now and by this time in 2008, no one will remember this case unless the Democrats bring it up like Dean promises they will.&nbsp; As anyone who reads this or is friends with me knows, my own political views lean towards socialism, so I tend to take the side of the liberals.&nbsp; I can't this time though.&nbsp; The Democrats need to&nbsp;fight over issues that&nbsp;are important, like health care, education, Iraq, Afghanistan, North Korea, and the gigantic debt.&nbsp; Schiavo should be one of the last things on their agenda.&nbsp; This is the party that completely fucked up the 2004 election and couldn't beat Bush despite the huge messes he created.&nbsp; If enough people don't give a shit about the loss of Amerikan lives in Iraq and the stupid idea that is the Bush Social Security plan, why are they going to want to hear about Schiavo still?&nbsp; The general Amerikan public has proven to be stupid and apathetic about things going on now, why will they care about this&nbsp;issue in two years?</P>
<P>Maybe the apathy and general idiocy of Amerikans can be explained by this article I found on MSNBC about medication.&nbsp; Evidently, people in the States are consuming more medication than ever before.&nbsp;&nbsp;That's&nbsp;reassuring news.&nbsp; The&nbsp;great part about that is more medicine is being consumed and&nbsp;the prices are still going up!!&nbsp; The&nbsp;makers of prescription drugs have to be happier than pigs in shit!&nbsp;&nbsp;There isn't that much competition, as there are only a handful of drug&nbsp;manufacturers and more and more people are buying more and more medication.&nbsp; It's really pathetic if you think about it.&nbsp; The Amerikan public enjoys popping pills at a rate comparable to Elvis Presley and the companies just get richer and richer.&nbsp; God Bless Capitalism and Republican control of the government.</P>
<P>While talking about Republicans, 81 year-old Henry Hyde is retiring from the House of Representatives when his term ends next year.&nbsp; Most of you will remember that as the head of the House Judiciary Committee, Hyde was the leader of the impeachment of President Clinton.&nbsp; In the press release on his website, Hyde cites improving the lives of the elderly and&nbsp;strengthening education as accomplishments he was a part of. Ho Ho, I beg to differ.&nbsp; I don't really see the Amerika providing a sterling example of an education system.&nbsp; Based on my interactions with people, I would say it's getting worse.&nbsp; Seriously, people are fucking stupid and they become more so each year.&nbsp; As for the elderly, let me repeat something.&nbsp; Prescription drugs are becoming more and more costly.&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the fact that Hyde's party is slashing Medicare and Medicaid benefits and are proponents of HMOs, I&nbsp;would have to say&nbsp;he is full of shit.&nbsp; How are the lives of the elderly improving when the cost of their health care is increasing rapidly, yet their benefits are being cut?&nbsp; A good talking point for another time and place is the need for term limits; Hyde was elected to the House in 1974.</P>
<P>Since I was just talking about the elderly, here's a sad little nugget.&nbsp; An elderly woman was trapped in her bathtub for five days after drawing a bath to nurse a sore tailbone.&nbsp;&nbsp;Jane Fromal&nbsp;was unable to get back up and drank tap water to avoid dehydration.&nbsp; She received help when a neighbor's grandson noticed the stack of unmoved newspapers in front of Fromal's door and urged his grandmother to call Fromal's family.&nbsp; Her family came and found her in the bathroom.&nbsp; Her family had her sent to the hospital and she was fine, minus mild dehydration.&nbsp; According to the AP article, this isn't the first time this has happened to Jane Fromal and now her family plans to add railings and a tub chair to the bathroom.&nbsp; Now the kicker for me is that her family is doing something about it NOW, after this has evidently happened at least twice.&nbsp; One would figure that when your 75 year-old mother/grandmother has a problem like that the first time that they would address it immediately.&nbsp; I mean at that age, if you fall or are otherwise unable to get up, you are in trouble.&nbsp; The other kicker is that someone else had to call the family after five days!&nbsp; Now, what kind of children and grandchildren neglect someone like that?&nbsp; I mean, if Jane's had a mobility problem before and is 75, wouldn't you call at least once a day or every other day to make sure she is ok?&nbsp; I mean seriously, unless you're one cold hearted fucker you should be checking up on your elderly parents and making sure that they can live the end of their lives as pain-free as possible.</P>
<P>Ok, now I'm 100 kinds of pissed off at people so I'm going to call this a nite.&nbsp; Everybody remember to watch WWE Raw tonite at 9 on Spike TV; HULK FREAKING HOGAN is going to be on!&nbsp; And as for future entries, I am thinking of trying some new things.&nbsp; Later this week, expect to see some new things, like a CD review or two.&nbsp; If I enjoy that, it might become a weekly thing.&nbsp; Also, I had a lot of fun writing about the Ultimate Warrior, so I think in the future I am going to do an entry every week or two about another nutty old school wrestler.&nbsp; If you guys have anything you think I should write about, let me know.&nbsp; And if you have any kind of reaction/thoughts on anything here, please leave a comment or contact me.&nbsp; Peace out.</P>"

"event","<P>Going to do something slightly different this time.&nbsp; I'm looking at news sites and I am going to put down a headline and my thoughts on just the headline.&nbsp; I have no idea what is within the story, though the title provides a good guess typically.&nbsp; Hopefully this will be funny or at least interesting, hopefully some of both.&nbsp; Fuck it, here we go:</P>
<P><STRONG>Potential Popes Meet Faithful Online</STRONG></P>
<P>This came from MSNBC.com and honestly it sounds pretty shady.&nbsp; I mean, don't child molesters strike by luring them in via the internet?&nbsp; Hmmmm....I guess&nbsp;makes at least SOME&nbsp;sense then.</P>
<P><STRONG>Social Security Could End for Some in Bush Plan</STRONG></P>
<P>No shit.&nbsp; That's been the whole fucking problem with it all along!&nbsp; Good job figuring thatout six months after this was an election issue.&nbsp; I can't lie, I clicked on the link and the study showing this was done by Congress.&nbsp; Congress is controlled by Republicans, Congress sponsored the research, the research was done AFTER the election.&nbsp; I smell a rat........</P>
<P><STRONG>Smuckers in Legal Jam over PB&amp;J</STRONG></P>
<P>Ha fucking ha.&nbsp; Real clever title.&nbsp; And why in the blue hell is this on the front page headlines on MSNBC, but an update on whats going on in Iraq, Iran, Lebanon, and/or Syria isn't?&nbsp; Are we that intellectually and socially depraved that SMUCKERS makes the headlines, but a war costing thousands of lives doesn't?</P>
<P><STRONG>Presidents Join Pilgrims</STRONG></P>
<P>This is from CNN and there isn't anything special about it.&nbsp; It's about the current Pres and the last two going to see the Pope.&nbsp; The title ""Presidents Join Pilgrims"" made me think of George W. stepping off the Mayflower dressed like a pilgrim.&nbsp; Could you imagine how fucked America would have been if George W. Bush was one of the first settlers?</P>
<P><STRONG>O.J. Among Stars at Johnnie Cochran Funeral</STRONG></P>
<P>I wouldn't really characterize OJ as a ""star.""&nbsp; When I think of the Juice, the first words that come to mind are ""FUCKING MURDERER!""&nbsp; Evidently Michael Jackson was at the funeral as well.&nbsp; What a weird clientele Cochran had.&nbsp; Then again, I guess you don't become famous by defending normal, well adjusted people.</P>
<P><STRONG>DeLay: Newspaper reports 'Seedy'</STRONG></P>
<P>Oh, give me a break.&nbsp; Tom DeLay,&nbsp;the House Majority Leader&nbsp;from Texas, is on the verge of being indicted for illegal fundraising and has already been rebuked thrice by the Ethics Committee.&nbsp; The New York Times just reported that his wife and daughter have been paid over a half mil by his campaign committees.&nbsp; So, just as any conservative would do, he lashed out at the ""liberal media"" for printing lies and gossip.&nbsp; Scumbag, you're about to be indicted!&nbsp; AND you were the one screaming about morality and Terry Schiavo and how the judges should be punished for allowing her feeding tube to be pulled!!!!&nbsp; Where the fuck do you get off being indignant!?</P>
<P><STRONG>Tornadoes Slam South</STRONG></P>
<P>Why do we bother reporting this anymore?&nbsp; Seriously, this happens at the same time every year in the same place.&nbsp; When does it stop surprising the people of Mississippi that they are in a tornado zone?&nbsp; Better yet, when do they stop being shocked that every year the Mississippi River floods?</P>
<P><STRONG>Would-be Jedi Not So Bright</STRONG></P>
<P>Evidently, hardcore Star Wars fans lined up outside the wrong theatre waiting for Episode III, which doesn't open until May 19.&nbsp; What the hell is wrong with these people!?</P>
<P><STRONG>The Asman Observer</STRONG></P>
<P>Ok, its not a headline.&nbsp; Its a tv show on Fox News, but when I was scrolling through their webpage I saw that title and thought it said ""Assman Observer.""&nbsp; I got a kick out of it, just thought I would share that with you.</P>
<P>This story is real twisted, so twisted that I cannot even adequately comment on it.&nbsp; Instead, here is the link:&nbsp; <A href=""http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,152479,00.html"">http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,152479,00.html</A></P>
<P>Well, that's that.&nbsp; If anyone else who reads this has some nutty headlines or news stories, feel free to share them in the comments section.&nbsp; Or don't.&nbsp; Whatever you want.</P>"

"event","I just woke up from dozing while I was reading.  All in all, I was actually unconscious for about 15 minutes.  That being said, why on earth do I have morning breath!?

Based on 'Cigaro' and 'BYOB,' the new System of a Down album is going to kick 140654869 kinds of ass.

I joke alot about being a fan of WWE (former WWF), since it gets a bad rep.  Just when I think that they could have borderline credibility, this happened last nite at Wrestlemania: Eugene, the mentally handicapped wrestler, came to the ring to talk about how excited he is about Wrestlemania.  The Arab-American wrestler, Muhammad Hassan, and his manager Khosrow take offense to this and come out an dcomplain how a schmuck like Eugene can be on Wrestlemania but the Arabs are discriminated.  They proceed to pummel Eugene, but then who appears but HULK FUCKING HOGAN in full wrestling gear to save the day.  Naturally, he crushes the two Arabs who are both half his age and havent had a hip replacement.  He then proceeds to rip his shirt off and flex for the fans, who are going completely batshit, for like 10 minutes.  Only in professional wrestling can a retard be saved from getting stomped by Arabs by Hulk Hogan.

Henry Rollins should really make another music CD; his spoken word is great, but I could go for some new Rollins Band material.

Nick Cave's new songs are awesome, but I wish he would bring back that crazy hair, get on heroin again, and go back to writing the crazy shit like he used to.

I saw pictures of the Pope lying in state....God Damn he's pale, but his dead ass ain't got shit on Michael Jackson's skin color.  Jacko redefines white.

The three cool Ramones are all dead.  This isn't news, but it still sucks.

Sometimes I wish murder wasn't a crime.  Honestly, some people should die.  I mean, I'm sure all 8 of you who read this could easily think of someone you would like to take out if given a free pass at it.

I think that if Hell exisits, Slayer would have to be the house band.  It would only be right.

I used to think Glen Danzig was a badass who made music that was at first cheesy fun, but then corny shit.  Either way, I thought he was a bad dude, I mean the man was jacked and looked like he had a bad attitude.  But the point of the story is, I used to think he was a badass until I saw a video clip of him getting dropped with one punch this past summer.  Way to go out like a sucker Glen.

I wonder what's going on in Iraq right now.  Based on the news, the only stories in the whole world right now that matter are that the Pope died and Terry Schiavo's family is still bickering.

Scratch that, I just looked at the headlines and there was a prison clash in Iraq.  My bad.

On the suck-o-meter, with 10 being ultra shitty, I would have to say this entry is a solid 6.75.  Oh well, you fuckers are the ones who read it, not me."

"event","I was sitting around today and to waste some time I went to Yahoo! news and read about Terry Schiavo.  Normally, I wouldn't even bother because, for better or for worse, I really didn't care about the Terry Schiavo story.  I can think of at least 5 things off the top of my head that were more important.  Actually, I can think of at least 10 things that are more burning issues in my mind.  Anyways, I was reading a story about her and it so happened that Yahoo! has a ""Terry Schiavo Case"" photo gallery.  So I figured, ""what the fuck,"" clicked the link and decided to check it out.  What I found in this gallery were images so shocking that I have no other recourse but to talk about them here.  As a warning, this will eventually disintegrate into my thoughts on God and religion, so beware.

Contained within this gallery were several shots of the protesters outside of Terry's hospital.  These photos were listed as being from right after Terry was announced dead today.  There were at least five shots of a random woman, unrelated to Terry, on her knees with her arms wide open screaming in anguish.  Then there were shots of another random man, this one from Arkansas, who came down to Florida with a portrait of Jesus larger than him, sobbing.  Then more random people holding crosses with red tape covering their mouths with the word ""life"" scrawled on them.  More people holding up signs saying ""murderer"" and signs comparing Terry and Christ.  It was really more than I could bare to see.  Grow the fuck up people.

You weren't related to Terry.  You had no emotional involvement with Terry Schiavo and probably didn't even know who she was until this became a national story, thus giving you the opportunity to boldly exclaim your hopes that the Bushes and God will do what's right and keep Terry ""alive,"" you know because a woman who has been brain dead since before my brother Joe was born is really living a great life.

Now is the time where I criticize the hypocrisy and sheer ridiculousness of the situation.  You southern evangelicals are so full of shit.  You rail about Terry's life is sacred and valuable, yet you refuse to allow homosexuals to even have civil unions.  You talk about how the courts and government are killing Terry Schiavo, but you are overwhelmingly in favor of the death penalty.  Now I personally like the death penalty, not because its a deterrent but because I think it is a fair punishment for a convicted killer (That, kiddies, is something I will discuss at another point, so please no feedback about what a fucker I am for liking the death penalty).  But honestly, how can these crazed evangelicals rail about how the government shouldn't let Terry Schiavo die, but they support the government actually kiliing people.

If life is so sacred, why aren't these same people out with their crosses and monstrous Jesus pictures in front of the White House to protest the war?  I mean really, the lives of Americans who aren't brain dead and in a vegetative state are being lost daily in Iraq and I have yet to see Christians out there protesting how important and blessed the lives of the soldiers are.  Why is that?  Isn't it kind of fucked up to pick and choose which life you believe is sacred and should be protected?  I mean, a little consistency would be nice.

Also, what's the deal with owning a wallsized portrait of Jesus?  And why bring it from Arkansas to Florida?  I find it hard to believe that you have nothing better to do than drive to Florida with a painting and pray and cry to it.  Couldn't you just stay home and get the same effect?  It seems like you're intruding on your relationship with Jesus by bringing out pictures of him and telling EVERYONE within earshot what YOU thinkg HE wants.  Isn't it presumptious of you to assume that Jesus wants YOU out there telling everyone else what HE think?  That doesn't just apply to Terry Schiavo.  Generally speaking, I'm pretty certain that if gay marriage, abortion, the death penalty, and feeding tubes meant that much to the Lord that He could provide people with the solutions to the problems presented by each issue.  Jesus doesn't need YOU telling everyone else how He interprets things.

Or maybe, just maybe, God isn't real.  I mean if gays were so bad, wouldn't GOD have gotten rid of them?  And on the other side of that, I would think that God would be eager to smite anyone who uses His words and teachings to bring harm to the lives of others.  I would certainly hope that if there was a God, he wouldn't be letting people die of cancer, let children starve, or let good people live with their bodies wracked with pain.  Also, George W. Bush claims that it was God's will that made him President and he will do what he can to reflect His will.  If ever there was a perfect reason to not believe in God, that was it.

I'm sure I just alienated myself from nearly everyone who reads this, but whatever.  I honestly don't care if you believe in God or not.  If you do, great.  It's good to have some kind of faith in something, be it God or your inner spirit or whatever the hell it is you believe in.  As always, comments are welcome.  Email, leave a comment, or IM me at gilbymania.  OH, and best wishes to the Pope.  I might not particularly like the Catholic Church, but John Paul 2 has had a pretty amazing run."

"event","To update my last entry, the odds of going back to the park have changed greatly.  Much to my surprise, the person I referred to as a weasly scumsucking shitheel is leaving the park and leaving within the next 2-3 weeks.  BONUS!  So, once again a total reevaluation of my summer plans will need to be done.

I would like to take this time to talk about driving, particularly the road rage aspect of it.  I find that whilst driving, I am often pushed to the brink of my sanity.  Really, all it takes is for one to three of those botched abortions who managed to get a driver's license to fuck up and send me into a rabid frenzy.  However, I have found that over the past few weeks, my anger behind the wheel has grown exponentially.  Usually when someone cuts me off or acts like a general jackass behind the wheel I just scream some obscenities and I cool down.  Lately, that hasn't been enough.  For instance, about two weeks ago I was making a right hand turn out of school and some old fucker decided to make a left and nearly sideswiped me.  It appeared that he didn't notice, so I took up the task of informing him.  My windows came down, the volume on my cd player went up (thank god I was listening to the Misfits at that moment) and the profanities came spewing.  As an added bonus, we hit a red light.  This afforded me the opportunity to pull up really close behind him and stare into his rearview mirror with a look of pure menace, one that can only be given by a guy with long hair and a massive beard who happens to be dressed in black.  As much fun as that was, it pales in comparison to the events that transpired just one or two days before that incident.

I was leaving Colonie Center after a shift as the Easter Bunny.  Since I had to be there before the mall officially opened, I had a sweet parking spot.  As I get into my car and prepare to back out, I notice a blue BMW SUV waiting anxiously for me to leave so it can fill the vaccuum left by my exodus.  It really irks the shit out of me when people do that, but whatever people suck and I said ""fuck it"" and prepared to back out.  As it happens, the Beamer was blocking traffic so it moved forward to let another vehicle through.  I then backed out, my front end pointing towards Wolf Road.  Go figure, right in front of me is the Beamer.  Now the Beamer is impeding my forward progress, so I sit and wait for it to pull forward.  Not only does it not pull forward, it begins to back up TOWARDS ME.  Now I'm a little hot under the collar and my screams of ""Bitch move forward, bitch move forward"" fell upon deaf ears.  The fucker is trying to shanghai my parking spot while I'm directly behind her!!!  At this point, I had no other recourse.  I swiftly pulled my car up next to the Beamer and put it in park.  I stopped, looked at the  driver (a confused looking middle-aged woman) and let loose a torrent of obscenities that would make George Carlin blush.  For a good 30-45 seconds I sat and berated the shit out of this woman.  No curse word was exempt on this spree.  The words of choice tended to be the F Word and the dreaded C Word, the one that is considered to be more ""obscene"" than all the others.  After screaming at this woman until my throat hurt, I drove away.  It has since been brought to my attention that it is in fact illegal to pull up to someone and hurl insults at them.  I guess it's disturbing the peace or something.  Fuck it, the woman deserved it for causing me a few moments of discomfort and annoyance.  Ok......maybe not, but it sure as hell tickled me pink.

That's all I have to say for now.  If I feel so inclined, I might update again in the near future."

"event","Back at school after spring break.  Finished my tour of duty as the Easter Bunny with minimal mental and emotional damage.  I do have to be honest though, the last week or two really sucked.  Once the novelty of wearing a giant bunny head and learning how to do goofy shit with it wore off, so did most of the enjoyment of the job.  Let me be clear though, it was a kick in the pants and it was a lot better than the Thacher Park job, but after a while it just became kind of a chore.  That being said, I would still do it again.  I mean really, its pretty fucking nutty to be able to say I have been both Santa and the Easter Bunny.

Well, enough of that.  It's funny...sometimes I think I write some really cool shit here, but other times I write some kind of dorky shit that has nothing to do with anything and has no significance.  Oh well, such is life.  I was thinking about writing on one of two subjects:  Terry Schiavo and the Pope, but fuck it.  I'm going to ramble about myself and not go on some kind of long winded lecture.

I need to look for a new job soon.  Thacher Park starts up again in the near future, but despite handing in an application back in December, I really have no desire to return for a fifth summer.  I honestly just don't have the patience to deal with the bullshit I put up with last summer.  Another season at the park and I will have Andrew Bogardt hanging from the flagpole in front of the poolhouse.  I seriously can't put up with that weasly scumsucking shitheel for another summer.  So, that is one job option gone.

I was looking into possibly doing an internship at the lobbying firm my dad is doing consulting for.  Honestly, despite my interest in politics (being that I'm a poli sci major and all), I don't really have any desire to lobby.  I think lobbyists and all that money floating around is one of the biggest problems in politics today and I would hate to propagate (sp?) that system.

My journalism teacher suggested that I try to get an internship for either the Metroland or the Times Union.  I am seriously considering looking into it, since I am looking into graduate school for journalism.  I'm working on an article or two right now and I guess we'll see how it goes from there.

On another note, it really irks the fuck out of me when people act like total bitches for no discernible.  For instance, I was talking to a person today and this person said they were doing ""ok,"" and I asked what was wrong.  This person then proceeded to flip out on me and tell me to not ask questions, that this person had a lot on their mind.  Well shit...exfuckingcuse me.  For the record, I have a shitload on my mind on a daily basis that I don't talk about or write about and I manage to at least put up an adequate conversation.  I mean, if something is bothering me THAT much, I'll just come out and say it.  If someone inquires as to what is on my mind I will answer or say that I do not wish to discuss it.  To just be like ""dont ask why, I have a lot on my mind"" is just plain rude.  I mean, it wasn't like I was trying to pry into one's life or harsh anyone's mellow.  Just making chit chat, not trying to invade your privacy.

But yeah, people need to grow the fuck up.  I'm not claiming perfection on my part, but I can at least be civil to pretty much anyone.  Honestly though, thats gotten tougher lately.  Its a daily battle to resist the urge to go on a killing spree.  People do so many little things that are so fucking stupid that it sends me into a blind rage.  On that note, my next entry will discuss my recent road rage incidents that, if reported to authorities, would easily get me in trouble for disturbing the peace.  On another note, I am working on an article about my dealings with Siena students and security...maybe I'll post it here when I'm done with it."

"event","Saw Be Cool over the weekend.  Decent, not up to the standard of Get Shorty, but still a worthwhile trip to the cinema.  Highlights of the movie: Cedric the Entertainer, Andre 3000 of Outkast, Vince Vaughn, and the Rock.  Seriously, the Rock was funny as hell and I'm not just saying that because I'm a fan of his from WWE (or WWF for the old school wrestling fans).  In the middle: John Travolta.  For some reason, Travolta didn't do it for me this time.  Possibly because most of his lines were identical to the ones he delivered in Get Shorty.  Lowlights: Uma Thurman, F.Gary Gray's directing.  My god, Uma Thurman sucked in this.  Evidently she can't act unless Tarantino directs.  And speaking of Tarantino, boo to Gray for ripping off the dance scene with Uma and Travolta from Pulp Fiction.  Completely pointless scene, just thrown in for a cheap thrill like ""AWWW shit, remember when they danced in Pulp Fiction!?""  Also, the Black Eyed Peas and the whole Aerosmith scene bit the weenie and were wastes of celluloid.

Speaking of Aerosmith, why must they persist in pissing away their legacy as one of the most awesome bands ever?  Their first four albums were so fucking good and now they are just a joke.  They don't have to hire pop writers to create hit records for them.  This is the band who in my opinion would be one of the top ten of all time, if not for the bulk of the material they recorded over the last 15-20 years.  Jaded?  Joe Perry is still a sick guitar player, but Tyler's singing is abominable.  There is really no need for them to appear in movies, duet with any hot young singer looking for credibility, or put out albums full of weak ass top 40 crap.  They could tour on the strength of just their old material and fucking own everyone.  But instead, they are a parody of themselves.

I had to go off on that tangent; I had nothing else to write about, but I felt like updating my journal.

I'm listening to the Doors right now and it brings up something.  There are very few singers who have the voice to give me a chill or really hold my attention.  That isn't to say that there is this lack of enjoyable vocalists, but the onest I am about to name have that ""it.""  They are: Jim Morrison, Nick Cave, Jeff Buckley, John Lennon (on his 1967 until death material), and Johnny Cash.  What about you guys?  What singers do you think have that ""it"" that can move you or suck you in?"

"event","<P>Well, through the magic of multiple CC's and forwards, I have managed to procure my response to Fr. Jim's email regarding my letter to him.&nbsp; This would be my email to which he has yet to respond.&nbsp; Remember kiddies, I am giving the good Father until tomorrow to get back to me before he receives a daily battery of emails from yours truly.&nbsp; So, to set this up I have once again posted Fr. Jim's response to me in order to refresh your memories.&nbsp; My response will follow after his.&nbsp; And here we go:</P>
<P><STRONG>James,<BR>&nbsp; It seems to me that you have answered your own question. If, as you state in your email, you ""do not look like the typical Siena College student"" and Security personnel asked you while you were on campus for several forms of identification, they were performing as they should. One of their roles is to protect the campus and its buildings from uninvited visitors. In each incident that you describe Security officers seemed to be protecting the student body from uninvited guests. As you might imagine all uninvited guest on our campus are not always cooperative. The Security officers are usually stern with them until they find out that the person with whom they are speaking is truly a Siena person. Please do not take their actions personally as they were just trying to keep the campus safe for you and the other students. Thanks for the email. Fr Jim T.</STRONG></P>
<P>And my response, now:</P>
<P><STRONG>Fr. Jim,<BR>With all due respect sir, I am taking this very personally.&nbsp; This past Sunday I was being very cooperative and provided my identification with no complaints.&nbsp; I have no problems with security doing their job, since my tuition and other fees go towards paying them.&nbsp; I'm well aware that because of the way I look, I'm subject to some scrutiny.&nbsp; I don't particularly like that, but I accept that.&nbsp; However, I was very polite and cooperative with the security, yet was treated like I was doing something wrong despite the fact that I provided provided proper school identifaction.&nbsp; I don't understand how you are telling me security was in the right, when I provided proper identification and was still looked at as ""suspect.""&nbsp; I'm fairly certain that one of the values espoused by Siena is respect.&nbsp; I was not treated in a respectful manner, despite the fact not only was I not doing something wrong, I treated security with proper respect.&nbsp; And also, correct me if I'm wrong sir, but isn't stopping a person and treating him immediately as suspect because of his appearance called profiling?&nbsp; Thank you for responding to my last email and thank you in advance for reading this.&nbsp; I hope to hear from you soon. James F. Shahen, Jr.</STRONG></P>
<P>Yeah, thats all I have for now....Not sure when I'll update again since I'm kind of busy between my Easter Bunny job and some other things, but feel free to leave positive comments.&nbsp; Shit, you can even leave negative ones if you like.&nbsp; Mahalo.</P>"

"event","<P>I haven't updated this in a while, but there's a good reason; I just didn't feel like it.&nbsp; But I decided to grace all five of you who read this with my most recent journal entry ever!!!! (cue applause)</P>
<P>I've been fairly busy this week in a brutal struggle with Campus Security and their chief, Father Jim Toal.&nbsp; See, last Sunday I was coming back to school and was treated harshly by Security for no reason.&nbsp; One of the Rent-A-Pigs tried to tell me that I do not go to Siena and was not waiting for my roommate to let me in the back door, despite providing my Siena ID, room key, mail key, and detailed directions to which building and room I live in (Plassmann 111).&nbsp; Rather than apologize for treating me like a criminal, the Rent-A-Pig just left in a huff.&nbsp; This was the second time an incident like this has happened to me in the last year at Siena.&nbsp; I'm totally certain it happens because I don't look like the well groomed, nicely dressed neoconservatives that go to my college.&nbsp; Why you ask?&nbsp; Well, there were several of the norm floating about the parking lot and none of them were stopped by the Rent-A-Pigs.</P>
<P>After this incident, I was in quite the state of discontent.&nbsp; I decided to handle this situation in the best manner possible; I wrote a letter to Fr. Jim Toal, head of Security and Vice President of the College.&nbsp; This letter was about a page and a half long and detailed in great detail the incident and justification for being treated like that by Security.&nbsp; I also told the good Friar that I was concerned with being treated like a delinquent scumbag despite cooperating and even being (gasp) friendly with the Rent-A-Pigs.&nbsp; Rather than detail my whole letter, since paraphrasing it doesn't make it sound right, email or IM me or leave me a comment if you would like to read the original letter.&nbsp; I sent this letter to Fr. Jim via email early on the morning of the 23rd.&nbsp; It would have been sent sooner but I had sent it to a different member of the administration and had to wait to find out who it should go to.&nbsp; On the 24th, I got a response from Friar Jim.&nbsp; I'll post it word for word now:</P>
<P><STRONG>James,<BR>&nbsp; It seems to me that you have answered your own question. If, as you state in your email, you ""do not look like the typical Siena College student"" and Security personnel asked you while you were on campus for several forms of identification, they were performing as they should.

In each incident that you describe Security officers seemed to be protecting the student body from uninvited guests. As you might imagine all uninvited guest on our campus are not always cooperative. The Security officers are usually stern with them until they find out that the person with whom they are speaking is truly a Siena person. Please do not take their actions personally as they were just trying to keep the campus safe for you and the other students. Thanks for the email. Fr Jim T.</STRONG></P>
<P>So basically, the Friar told me to fuck myself.&nbsp; He basically said that since I look different than other students, I should rightly be treated as an ""uninvited visitor.""&nbsp; Evidently, based on the good Friar's eloquent response, if I look different, I (or anyone else who looks atypical) should be viewed as a long lost member of the Manson clan.&nbsp; What the Friar fails to defend is the fact that I provided multiple forms of identification and was still treated like a steaming pile of horse shit.&nbsp; Since he then tried to brush it off with a ""do not take their actions personally,"" I shot off another email to him that stated that I am in fact taking this personally.&nbsp; I also asked him if his email was a jusitification of the use of profiling and again requested a meeting with him like I did in my letter.&nbsp; As of 4:07 pm on Sunday, the Soul Man has not responded to my email.</P>
<P>So, what's next?&nbsp; Well, if I don't get a response by Tuesday I am going to email him daily until I get a response.&nbsp; If I do not get a response or get an inadequate one after that, I am going to print up copies of my emails, letters, and his lone response.&nbsp; Maybe the local news would like to know how well the administration responds to different people and to the concerns of their students.&nbsp; Or, maybe I'll write an article about it and peddle it to someone.&nbsp; Or, I could just bash in Fr. Jim Toal's fucking head and make a graceful exit from the lovely Siena campus.</P>"

"event","As I said yesterday and I think the day before that, the US and Syria are steadily building to conflict.  As I am wont to do, here is a link with an update: As I said yesterday and I think the day before that, the US and Syria are steadily building to conflict.  As I am wont to do, here is a link providing a current update on that situation: http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=1802&e=6&u=/washpost/20050217/ts_washpost/a30801_2005feb16

Everyone my age should be prepared to spend an extended armed holiday in the desert, since (and I hate to be a broken record) there is no way the US can have troops in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria/Lebanon and their new buddy Iran without a military draft.  I mean, there were rumors of the draft back in the spring last year before Syria and Iran were even considered a viable contender on the Bush's 21st Century Apocalypse Tour of the Middle East.  Add to that the fact that enlistments in the armed forces dropped last year to the lowest they've been in ten years, and all I have to say is ""shit.""  Yesterday, I was going to provide a map to show anyone who reads this the expanse of land that Amerikan forces would be fighting over just to show that without a draft we would be stretched way to fucking thin, despite what the Bushmaster would have you think.  So, without further ado, here's a map of the Middle East: http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/middle_east_pol_2003.jpg

What this map doesn't show all that well is that Afghanistan is on the eastern border of Iran, so this war would stretch across four nations.  And really, who can say whether or not nations like Yemen, who support al-Qaeda and were the home for the USS Cole bombing, wouldn't get involved?  Or Saudi Arabia?  I mean, 15 of the 19 9/11 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia, al Qaeda received funding from the Saudi government, and the government itself is just as repressive as those that the US government tries to squeeze.  Saudi Arabia just had elections and women were denied the right to vote.  Not a very good sign from a nation that the Bush administration has some questionable ties to.  What makes them exempt from US inquiry or better yet, if a war breaks out how do we know who's side the Saudis are on?  Just to continue the doomsday scenario, Pakistan is directly next to Iran and below Afghanistan.  Pakistan, as we know, has had terrorism problems, their government supported the Taliban, AND they have nuclear weapons to boot.  To go back to Syria for a moment, there have been stories and rumors and allegations that Syria helped fund Iraq WMD programs and might actually have chemical and biological weapons of their own, so thats a big question mark.

And let's not forget Israel.  Ariel ""the Little Mermaid"" Sharon has hinted at attacking Iran in order to stop their nuclear threat.  Iran, in turn, has promised to shoot down and US or Israeli spy planes that they see.  Meanwhile, there is a ceasefire between Israel and Palestine, but things are still definitely shaky.  At the same time, Israel and Lebanon don't get along particularly well.  They were at war with each other for years and Hamas, the terrorist group, was founded and is located inside Lebanon.  Hamas, as you know (or should know), and Israel are mortal enemies.  So if a war breaks out, we can be sure that Hamas will take out some aggression on Israel.  The US has sworn to help defend against threats to Israeli security, which does not go over well in the Middle East.  Iran has some strong ties to Russia, since Russia has been helping Iran with creating nuclear reactors in Tehran: http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/ap/20050217/ap_on_re_eu/russia_iran_1
Also, Iran and Russia have created a joint business council, check this out: http://en.rian.ru/rian/index.cfm?prd_id=160&msg_id=5409243&startrow=1&date=2005-02-14&do_alert=0

Of course, Syria has ties to Russia as well; Russia is in the process of selling Syria anti-missile weaponry: http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/afp/20050216/wl_mideast_afp/mideastrussiasyria_050216185543

Some research into France's ties show a long relationship with Syria, but over the last week the French government has called for an investigation into the killing of the former Lebanese Prime Minister by Syria or the pro-Syrian government in Lebanon.  Germany has taken an active part in urging peace discussion with Iran, hoping to make Iran a real part of the global community.  Germany wants the US to join in with the European Union to help with this, but thus far Amerika has been hesitant to go the route that Germany proposed.

I'm not trying to bum everyone out here with my conspiracy theories but I think that the subject matter above is something that we should all at least be aware of.  I am take solace in the fact that if a crackpot like me can work out and create this whole scenario in the hour and a half its taken me to write this, I'm sure as hell the Bush administration is aware of the potential ramifications of war with Syria and/or Iran.  Since I have completely lost all steam and my forward progress, I guess I'll just say that this entry is a warning.  The potential for a third World War is there and we should all at least know that and look into it just in case.  I think that all the Bushites who love that he's ""taking the fight to the baddies in their own land"" better wake up.  That ""War on Terror"" macho bullshit only works for so long before it becomes something with far more sinister possibilities.

<P>What you all miss out on is as follows:&nbsp; Iran and Syria have decided to ally, thus showing that I correctly prophesized (i hope thats the word) Pan-Arabism because of US pressure and bullying.&nbsp; I then said that technically Iran is Persian, but the common Amerikan doesn't know the difference.&nbsp; I provided a link to the story and then a map of the Middle East.&nbsp; The map was to show how fucked the US would be if this goes into war, since they would be fighting from Syria's border at the Mediterranean, across Iraq, and into the Persian Gulf and Caspian Sea to get to Iran.&nbsp; Not a good idea guys.&nbsp; So, thats half my original entry.&nbsp; Now, I'll pick up my entry from where it should be....fucking Al Gore didn't perfect that internet he created did he?</P>
<P>I was wondering what my good friend Dan O'Connell has been up to lately, since I haven't seen him since November and really discussed him in any length since I talked about him in my journal a month or two ago.&nbsp; Some people read what I wrote and took it as me not liking him, but thats not true.&nbsp; Dan's been one of my best friends for such a long time that it would be nearly impossible for me to just hate him.&nbsp; The fact of the matter is that Dan's a really smart, really good kid who I love like a brother.&nbsp; That's why it kills me to see him get a sub 1.5 GPA every semester.&nbsp; I mean, he's a smart kid and he's throwing away his potential for the sake of smoking himself into a vegetable.&nbsp; From what I've heard today, he did in fact fail the Fall 2004 semester and had to appeal to be allowed back in to Geneseo.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's ridiculous.&nbsp; A person once told me that I had no concept of what Dan is all about or the great things that he's accomplished while at school.&nbsp; To that I say fuck you, you have no idea what a great accomplishment is.&nbsp; If a great thing is seeing a friend after a few months and watch him talk like someone out of the Woodstock documentary, then you could be right.&nbsp; Otherwise, I consider smoking dope all day and failing all your classes a complete waste of potential.&nbsp; But, I'm always willing to be proven wrong and I would love to hear from Dan.&nbsp; So, if Dan or anyone who is in steady contact with Dan could provide me with his cell phone number or tell him to call me (727-6109), then please do so.&nbsp; I'm not trying to dump on the kid, it just sucks to see him aimlessly stumble through life.&nbsp; And I'm not the only one who thinks that, so anyone who is going give an anonymous post and tell me what a dick I am should preemptively just shut the fuck up.</P>
<P>Now the next part of my entry is kind of mean, so all five of you who read this can feel free to&nbsp;call&nbsp;me a dick this time.&nbsp; My good buddy Tom DeRusso sent me a person's away message, which was a part of a conversation with her boyfriend.&nbsp; Since I feel kind of bad posting it and making fun of people who don't even know I've read this, I'm taking out their names.&nbsp; That and I don't know who actually reads this, so I don't want someone to IM either person and ask them what the hell is wrong with them.&nbsp; I am going to label them as boy and girl since I'm not creative and I wasn't even going to put this in my journal.&nbsp; I'm doing this by the request of Mr Tom DeRusso however, and a few entries ago I promised to write about pretty much anything someone suggested.&nbsp; So here goes.....</P>
<P><STRONG>BOY: I love driving in the dark<BR>BOY: the ride home was relaxing<BR>GIRL: good<BR>GIRL: yeah driving in the dark is nice<BR>BOY: peaceful</STRONG></P>
<P>Alright, so far nothing too bad, but now things start to get fishy....</P>
<P><STRONG>BOY: I would love to take a walk in the dark tonight<BR>BOY: through the pines<BR>GIRL: that would be so nice<BR>BOY: yea with that crisp autumn breeze<BR>GIRL: it is quite cool tonight<BR>BOY: yea, so tranquil on the skin</STRONG></P>
<P>Ok, now things are starting to get hairy.&nbsp; I never thought of an evening walk through a pine forest was romantic, I've always found it to be something out of Friday the 13th, but whatever some people are into&nbsp;some freaky&nbsp;shit.&nbsp; I hope that this away message was culled from a conversation in the fall, otherwise the boy is fucking retarded to call the February breeze an autumn one.&nbsp; The last line really burns me, since I'm almost 100% certain that tranquil is not the right word in this context.&nbsp; I mean, honestly the guy is trying to be poetic and sweet, but it comes out all wrong.&nbsp; It's like reading a poem from someone from a foreign country who is trying to master English as a second language.&nbsp; Which is fine, if you're from the Czech Republic, but when you're 19 years old and have been born and raised in upstate NY for your whole life there's just no excuse for such poor semantics.&nbsp; I get what he's saying, but he should have used calm or soothing because tranquil doesn't fit right.&nbsp; Instead of sounding romantic and sweet, it sounds kind of bizarre and well....lame.&nbsp; But really, so far its not too bad considering anyone who knows the boy should be astounded that he can correctly spell autumn and tranquil, but its definitely not worth quoting in an away message.&nbsp; So far, just corny and kinda dumb, but now here comes some of the most fuckedest shit I have ever read...</P>
<P><STRONG>BOY: we could maybe walk together like two warriors leaving a brutal battlefield</STRONG></P>
<P>What the fuck?&nbsp; Where does that come from?&nbsp; Is that supposed to be romantic?&nbsp; I mean, I'm no great romancer but I've always thought that talking about soothing, calming walks through the woods and segues into <STRONG>we could maybe walk together like two warriors leaving a brutal battlefield!&nbsp;&nbsp;</STRONG>It's like going from Wordsworth into Gladiator!!!!&nbsp; To be nice, I like the use of alliteration, but that doesn't make that line any less abnormal.&nbsp; It's such a flagrant violation of everything I've ever learned about what to say to another human being to convey love.&nbsp; It evokes images of&nbsp;anything but tranquility and soothing and peaceful living.&nbsp; No girl could possibly like to see a quote like that, could they?&nbsp; Could they?</P>
<P><STRONG>GIRL: like that time this summer<BR>GIRL: when we ran together up to the big barn<BR>GIRL: like soldiers</STRONG></P>
<P>Ok, I guess I was wrong.&nbsp; But again, and I'm not trying to bring down someone's love life, but what's up with using war images to show their love?&nbsp; To be honest, the drastic segue from peace to warriors and soldiers is really shocking.&nbsp; It loses something when I break it up like this for the sake of being a judgmental prick.&nbsp; But honestly, I've been around a lot of couples in my time and I have never seen them describe their relationship and their time together by invoking battlefield images, with the exception of old people who met during wars.&nbsp; But these two are describing it like they are falling in love while fighting in Hanoi.&nbsp; I've got nothing left and I don't think any of my commentary is particularly worthwhile, so I'm gonna try to wrap this up fast.</P>
<P><STRONG>BOY: LOL<BR>BOY: yea <BR>BOY: it was cute<BR>GIRL: I thought so too<BR>GIRL: and fun<BR>BOY: yea, only we would do something like that</STRONG></P>
<P>Yes, only you would do something like that.&nbsp; Overall, this away message was disturbing on so many levels that I can't even adequately write about them.&nbsp; Basically, I think that after all this I sound like a total douchebag, but oh well.&nbsp; It just came across so bizarre to me, like why would you put this up as an away message?&nbsp; I mean, theres really nothing particularly romantic or sweet or worth sharing.&nbsp; I mean, with the exception of Tom DeRusso and the people like me and him who made fun of it surreptitiously, these are this person's friends who are able to read this.&nbsp; I know if my friend put that up I would be like ""What the fuck's wrong with you?""&nbsp; Shit, this isn't my friend and I'm thinking that.&nbsp; It just gives off this creepy Texas Chainsaw Massacre/Apocalypse Now/Saving Private Ryan/Friday the 13th vibe.</P>
<P>Wow, I hope I didn't sound like an asshole in all the above...I'm pretty sure I did, but if you know these people you would agree that this is some messed up stuff.&nbsp; Even if you don't know these people, look past my pitiful attempt at humorous and just read it as a whole.&nbsp; It's really really bizarre and my thoughts on it don't do it any justice.&nbsp; Hopefully, you at least got a smirk out of this.&nbsp; My next entry will revert back to the norm, unless anyone has something they want me to talk about.&nbsp; If you do, leave a comment or IM me at gilbymania</P>

Anyways, how much did the Grammys suck?  That all-star performance of ""Across the Universe"" made me blow chunks.  The highlights of the performance:  Brian Wilson not knowing the words to the chorus, Scott Weiland doing an amazing David Bowie impersonation (seriously, he actually sounded good live for once even though/because he wasn't singing like himself), and Stevie Wonder still being blind.  Lowlight:  Bono singing, Stevie Wonder singing (dude hasn't been good since Superstition), Bono and Stevie Wonder singing on every tribute song ever performed and recorded, and Alicia Keys oversinging like she was Mariah Carey.

However, the Grammys did give me a great idea for a movie/story idea, based on the fact that if you die you are guaranteed Grammy success.  If you really want to hear about it, IM me at gilbymania, or email me at gilbymania@yahoo.com

I would post it all here, but some random fucker could steal the idea and make money off it instead of me.  Needless to say, those who I have told the idea to have found it to be an interesting concept.

"event","First thing's first, be sure to post a comment with your top ten best artists/bands of all time.  Not your favorite, but who you feel are the best musical artists of all time.  Remember, ya'll have until Thursday next week to send your list.  I'm still in a pretty good mood, but there have been so many things in the news going on lately that the temptation to rant and rave for all 5 of you who read this is just too overwhelming.  SO, here goes nothin.....

Well, evidently the second administration of Bush is turning into a shitstorm faster than even I could expect.  Despite Bush and his cronies claiming victory in Iraq, there are reports of mass fraud and irregularities in the Iraqi election.  Also, a new story has come out stating that the insurgents within the country will be prevalent and strong for AT LEAST 5-10 more years.  This doesn't sound like a success story to me, but evidently the Bushman sees it differently and has moved on to bigger and better things.

During his State of the Union, Bush decided that starting, fucking up, and failing to successfully complete wars in Afghanistan and Iraq wasn't enough.  Dubya has now pointed out two more evil nations to go after, Iran and Syria.  Evidently Iran is actually the nation with nuclear weapons and a hostile, brutal regime.  I guess when he must have originally meant Iran but he always mixes up those pesky Q and N's.  Syria evidently openly supports terrorism and the Iraqi insurgents are granted safe haven within its borders.  Well no shit, Syria only openly stated back when the conflict began that they would support the government we planned to depose.  Maybe, call me crazy, maybe the Pentagon and Dept. of Defense should have thought about that BEFOREHAND.  Regardless, Bush has told both nations to step off or else.....or else the ""coalition of the willing"" will blow up your buildings and kill your people without any discretion until your country is as beautiful and safe as Afghanistan and Iraq.

Since Iran has openly declared the fact that they have nuclear weapons, the US is doing what any logical, terror and WMD attack fearing Congress and Presidency would do, they are drawing up plans for a pre-emptive assault on Iran.  Good thinking, since the current one is working out so well.  And this time, the nation in question actually has nuclear weapons!!!  As for Syria, they've been a belligerant nation for decades just like Iran.  Does the administration not think that if they single out too many Middle Eastern Islamic nations that they just might decide to have a little Pan-Arabism and join together to fight what the Ayatolla Khomeini referred to as 'the Great Satan?'  I mean the Islamic nations aren't too happy with the invasion of Iraq, I'm fairly certain that invading 1-2 more nations in the region would go over about as well as adult women at a Michael Jackson party.

Iran isn't the only Axis of Evil nation with WMDs.  As was reported two years ago, North Korea has nuclear weapons.  They basically admitted this back then but the nuclear and chemical threat in Iraq was such a burning issue that the administration has tossed North Korea to the wayside.  Now, North Korea has pulled out of any disarmament talks and is refusing to get rid of any of their nuclear capabilities.  I am no fan of John Kerry, but during the presidential debate he mentioned how China and Japan both requested that the US become involved in talks with North Korea, but even the Asian superpowers couldn't sway Dubya.  Now, we have to deal with an openly hostile nation possessing nuclear weapons that they aren't open to talking about.  Great.

With Iraq being nowhere close to complete, Afghanistan still being fought over and conflicts with Iran, Syria, and maybe even North Korea looming, there is no way that Bush can keep his campaign promise that there would be no military draft.  WIth American forces stretched pretty thin as it is, there is no way that the military can sustain another 1-3 armed conflicts without a draft.  And increasing military spending like Bush has proposed in his budget isn't the answer either.  You can have all the money in the world, but when the army has had the lowest amount of enlisting in over a decade, there's a serious problem.  No one is going to be enticed to sign up when the proposed Bush budget cuts benefits for veterans even further.  But what do I know?  I'm not one of the 60.6 million suckers who voted for him.

"event","After not updating this for a while, I guess the time has come to put down something, anything.  I was going to rant about Republikans, Bush's jihad with the Middle East, and the general fuckedupness that is Amerika in 2005, but I'm feeling pretty decent tonite so I am going to spare all three of you who bother to read this anymore.  But if anyone has something that they feel I should be ranting and raving about, leave a comment telling me the topic and if possible, a link to the story.

And actually, tonite is your lucky nite.  I'm going to give a list of the bands/artists that I think are the ten best of all time.  These aren't my ten most favorite, these are the ten best and most important of all time as seen through my near-sighted eyes.  What I want from anyone who reads this is to email, IM, or leave me a a comment that provides YOUR top ten list of the best artists of all time.  I'm not ranking mine, but feel free to rank yours.  IF there's enough feedback from you, I'll compile them into a list and post them.  I'll set a weeklong deadline so you, my dedicated fanbase, can mull on it and provide your best list possible, since odds are I'm the only loser besides the people on VH1 who sits around and thinks about a topic like this.  I'm only going to give brief commentary after each artist on my list; you can as well, but it isn't required.  Well, enough of that..on with my list.

The Beatles: An obvious pick, but one that is deserved.  I wrote an entry on them a while ago, so this is going to be a short comment.  Regardless of what anyone thinks about their music, they paved the way for basically every other pop/rock band after them.  They defined what a band and an album could do and be like, not to mention they were the first band to be a global phenomenon.

The Doors: One of my favorite bands of all time and really revolutionary for their time.  Jim Morrison's not only my favorite frontman, but I am pretty sure he is the greatest lead singer of all time.  The band was great and as a whole, all four of the Doors changed what music could be.  They were doing 15 minute songs in 1965 about taboo topics like sex, drugs, and things that are now commonplace in music.  Also, singers from every generation have tried to do that Jim Morrison vocal style -  the Cult and Creed being most notorious.  To wrap this one up, the Doors were the darkest and most volatile band of their generation and created a legacy and songs that stand up to pretty much anything else ever recorded.

Led Zeppelin: The most imitated hard rock band of all time.  Each musician in that band is arguably the best of all time at the instrument they play.  I could name all their great songs, but that's an entry in and of itself.  Its nearly impossible to listen to any rock band and not hear a trace of something Zeppelin has done.

The Clash: More than just an amazing punk band, an amazing band in general.  The London Calling album mixes punk, pop, rockabilly, jazz, blues, and reggae throught its 20 songs.  They took punk and went beyond it, crafting real songs and pushing a real agenda, not just presenting anger and frustration.  Their songs had some sort of meaning to them and as I have said before, the Clash is the band U2 wishes they could be.

The Who: They get by on the strength of their early songs and live albums, since after 1971 they haven't put out anything really vital.  In the 60s though, they played some cool blues/pop songs and recorded some of the best live shows/albums ever.  Studio albums don't do the Who the justice that Live at Leeds does.  And really, how could I not include a band that had Keith Moon, John Entwistle, Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend, who are among the best drummers, bassists, singers, and songwriters respectively.

Rolling Stones: I was hesitant to put them on the list since I don't really enjoy most of the songs they recorded after the 60s.  However, the songs they recorded in the 60s were amazing.  Sure Jagger is ugly and can't really sing, but Keith Richards wrote some awesome songs that provided the Stones with the rebellious image and sound that made them successful.  Their 60s songs were bluesy and were pretty ballsy for the time period and hold up pretty well today.  The songs hold up much better than they personally do, friggin geezers.

Elvis: How oould the King not make the list?  The man is the consummate entertainer.  Sure, he's remembered for the fat, pathetic joke he became in the 1970s, but in the 50s and 60s he was pretty freaking cool.  The 68 Comeback Special is one of the most memorable and one of my most favorite performances ever.  Say what you will about his image and legacy, but the man had some soul and he could really sing, I mean really belt out the songs.  As a performer and pure singer, Elvis stands alone.

Prince: Probably an unexpected pick, but the man is so talented that it would be a shame if I didn't include him.  On his first album, he played 27 instruments!!!  27 instruments!!!  He's an absolutely amazing guitarist and as an entertainer, very few rank with him.  Listen to the songs on Purple Rain, or even his newest album Musicology.  Prince has evolved with each album and managed to put out something compelling every time out.

Bob Dylan:  I almost forgot about Dylan until ""masters of war"" came up on my musicmatch playlist.  He can't sing worth shit, but he's written enough amazing songs to make the list.  His influence is far reaching, he helped set the stage for Hendrix and Tom Petty and Bruce Springsteen.  He has enough great songs to fill his own entry.  He has a way with lyrics and through them has crafted a plethora of songs that stand out today.  I would name some, but I'm pretty sure everyone can name at least one Bob Dylan song.  I feel sheepish about forgetting him since he's such a no brainer.

Black Flag:  Probably the only pick besides Prince that I feel like I should really defend.  Basically, Black Flag owned the hardcore punk scene in the early 1980s and expanded it to include heavy metal.  If one listens to the tribute album that Rollins put out a year or two ago, you can hear how much they influenced hardcore.  The heaviness and power in bands like Nirvana and Slipknot were made possible by Black Flag.  They sang of alienation and isolation and society and anger and did it better than most everyone.  On top of that, Greg Ginn was an amazing guitarist and Black Flag provided Henry Rollins his start.  Basically, Black Flag took metal and punk, combined them and created a whole new sound.

Honorable Mention:  Janis Joplin, the Misfits, Cream, Jimi Hendrix, Aerosmith

Well, that is that.  Please do not hesitate to post your top ten list, I am really eager to see what you came up with!"

I am going to take this time to thank those of you who agreed with my commentary on U2 and Iggy and the Stooges from my last entry.  I wonder if the anonymous post was from the same person who wanted me to have a conjugal relation with myself and my ""mooseknuckle.""  If so, at least the person might have good taste in music.  If not, the person might have good taste in music.  Anyways, that's enough of that...on with the show!

I returned to Siena yesterday and started classes today.  As I write this, I am waiting to go to my second and final class of the day.  The first one was journalistic writing and it looks like the work will be very structured and have to be in a certain format.  I guess if I wanted creativity, I should have taken the poetry or writing short fiction classes.  At least this class will help me to see if I would be interested in journalism as a potential career in the future if the mall Santa and Easter Bunny jobs dont provide a steady source of income.

Had an absolutely wretched sleep last night, probably due to it being the first nite back.  I really think I only got about 4 hours of sleep.  However, what concerns me is that I haven't been sleeping well in general lately.  I've gotten around 6-8 hours of sleep consistently over the last few weeks but they weren't solid, restful hours.  My dreams have been pretty bizarre and I feel absolutely dreadful when I wake up.  Lately, I have felt kind of anxious when I go to sleep.  I don't know why; everything has been pretty good and I've been able to catch up on a lot of reading and film viewing.  Lemire said it's probably seasonal affective disorder but I'm not too concerned, since I'm the alpha male and all.  After my next class, I'm going to go the gym.  I'm sure I'll feel better after that.

Maybe later I'll post something else and lighten the mood.  Or maybe I'll just go out of my way to depress the fuck out of everyone I come into contact with.  We'll see."

"event","The 2005 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees were announced recently, with the Pretenders and U2 being the two marquee names being enshrined.  There was a band that was eligible this year but not accepted into the Hall.  A band that put out three seminal albums and created the punk genre before it existed.  That band would be the Stooges, better known now as Iggy Pop and the Stooges.  I would like to take this time to make the case for the immediate inclusion of the Stooges into the Hall and for the immediate denial of any critical acclaim for U2.

The Stooges were way ahead of their time.  Listen to their three albums recorded from 1969-1973.  They were punk before the label existed.  Big, loud, distorted riffs and alienated, brutal, and nihilistic lyrics were Stooge trademarks.  It was the end of the flower power movement and here were Iggy and the Stooges recording songs like ""I Wanna be your Dog,"" ""TV Eye,"" ""No Fun,"" and ""Search and Destroy.""  At the time, the Stooges were hated.  The critics and record labels thought the music was stupid and abrasive.  Due to the violent nature of their songs and performances and record label opposition, the Stooges collapsed.  What arose from their demise less than a decade later was the punk movement.  They laid the groundwork for the Sex Pistols (who used to regularly cover ""No Fun"") and Black Flag and all the other bands that helped make punk popular.  The three Stooges albums are much more vital and interesting than anything that newer bands have put out.  Most bands weren't as daring as the Stooges, lyrically, visually and musically.  Within their sound were elements of jazz and bohemia that David Bowie would later use.  Also, the lyrics might have been viewed as stupid, but really they were just a harbinger of what was to come by the end of the 1970s.  Even if critics dislike their music and style, they should be at least recognized for their influence.  I mean, I like the Talking Heads and they were inducted a few years ago, but I tend to think that Iggy and the Stooges were a bit more influential on the history of rock music.

This brings me to a band that I believe is quite possibly the most overrated band ever, U2.  First of all, the band itself is pretty untalented, and not untalented in a cool way like the Ramones.  The Edge plays the same solo and usually the same riff in every song, the rhythm section is weak, and Bono isn't exactly a quality singer.  And I don't want to hear that ""hes singing from the heart"" shit.  Dude just cannot sing well.  I could go out and yell like he does and put on a falsetto and people would just call me a jackass.  I think it has to do with the fact that he's being ""political,"" like no other band has done that before.  Well, the Clash did it a good 5 years before U2 and they did it with a lot more musical diversity than U2.  The last two U2 albums have been hailed as staggering works of genius, but they both are the same basic album.  Really, most U2 songs sound exactly alike.  You can count some tearful wailing from Bono, the one note solo from Edge, and an overall sound that the critics will hail as ""brilliant"" and ""groundbreaking"" and ""a breath of fresh air.""  How can every new U2 song and album be groundbreaking and fresh when the last two or three albums have all been carbon copies of each other?  Since the Joshua Tree, the only difference is that they have become easier on the ears.  They just sounded like a mess on some of the early songs.  I will grant that they are at best an average band, but they are accepted because of the fact that Bono is trying to eradicate AIDS, war, hunger, and poverty across the third world.  To which I say, Bono has a messiah complex and Joe Strummer was championing these causes way before it was hip.  Overall, I feel that U2 was a second rate Clash that has managed to stay vital through their public image.  The music wasn't new and revolutionary when they started in 1979 and it certainly isn't groundbreaking or new in 2005.  The music of U2 didn't create a new genre of rock and didn't really add anything new to the mix.

That is why I suggest that at the very least, the Stooges need to be inducted immediately.  From this day forth, U2 should no longer be referred to as the greatest rock band on the planet and the greatest thing since the Beatles.  Bono should no longer be mentioned in the same breath as Jesus and each new U2 album shouldnt be called the greatest piece of music since the last U2 album.  To beat this dead horse of an entry even more, how can the Stooges be denied but the Pretenders are accepted?  Seriously, the Pretenders make U2 look like Led Zeppelin.  The Pretenders are neither vital nor particularly influential in the overall history of rock music.  Basically, Iggy and the Stooges = awesomeness and Bono, Chrissy Hynde, and the people who select the inductees into the Hall of Fame should be clubbed like the sots they are."

"event","Well, I am now done being a mall Santa.  In March, I get to be the Easter Bunny, but I'll talk about that when the time comes.  Right now, I am going to put down three moments as Santa that stick out in my mind.  At least one is just a reason why I shouldn't be allowed near kids, one is a reason why I will find out firsthand if there is in fact a Hell, and the last is just fucked up.

1) Santa Shahen vs. Suburbia:  This debacle occured on the Saturday after Thanksgiving I believe, when I had to work from 5:30-9:30 at Crossgates.  In this stitch in time, three well groomed, well dressed, Aryan children ranging in age from 4-8 came in to see Santa with their mother.  To call these kids monsters would be a compliment.  One boy and one girl start to tug on my sleeves, my wig and fake beard, and attempt to take my gloves off.  All the time they are screaming ""You aren't the real Santa, You're not the real Santa!""  Now one would think the mother would interject here and be like ""Hey, calm the fuck down and smile for the picture,"" but alas, she is more concerned with getting in the picture and getting the youngest child to smile.  The picture is going to look like shit because her son is ripping on my sleeve and hair and yelling, so I had to take matters into my own hands.  The kid grabbed my beard again, so I smacked his hand down and grabbed his hands so he couldn't move.  Problem solved, picture taken, bada bam.  So, the second that the picture is done, I let the child fall to the ground.  Upon standing up, the little prick grabs one of the display items in the Santa area.  I pulled a Rock in Walking Tall and decided to not let this stand.  I shout at the little beast ""Hey! Drop it! Now!""  The child dropped the display item and ran away, and as a consequence of my actions, the woman taking the pictures asks me if I'm ok...because I was the one ruining the feng shui of SantaLand.

2) When Dealing with the Handicapped goes Terribly, Terribly Wrong:  In a prior entry I discussed mentally handicapped people and my affection for them.  This was a moment where I inadvertantly acted in a fashion unbecoming of Santa.  This moment occured this past Sunday when I was Santa at Colonie Center.  Two boys, roughly age 6 come in to see me.  One sits on my lap and talks nicely about what he wants for Christmas.  I was unable to really focus on his desires however, as his brother is standing up next to me, jumping up and down and flailing his arms wildly towards my head.  Then, the child leaps down and lands face first on the couch.  I figured that this would temporarily incapacitate the child, bad conclusion.  The child starts to try to bite the side of my thigh while he is smacking my leg with his arm.  Now, I was really uncomfortable and a wee bit peeved.  Playing Dracula with some kid isn't part of my job description.  So, while his mother is focusing on the brother on my knee, I elbowed the biter in the face swiflty and solidly enough to deter him, but not hard enough to hurt him.  This wasn't too successful, but they left shortly after.  As soon as they left, one of the workers in SantaLand came up and said, ""Just so you know, the little boy who was jumping up and down and not talking was autistic.""  The look on my face can only be describes as the look of someone who just realized they got mad at and hit an autistic kid, albeit accidentally.

3) Santa the Sex Symbol:  This event occured today while I was working at Crossgates.  I was sitting on my throne in SantaLand when I see three teenage girls and their fiftysomething mother in line.  I was like ""Oh, the kids are coming for a picture.""  I was only partly right.  The kids were in fact getting their picture, but the mother wanted to be included.  Naturally, none of the teenage girls want to sit on Santa's lap, so skeevy mama hops up on my knee.  The maternal unit has atrocious dyed blond hair, a tight gray tank top on (sans bra), and uber tight gray sweatpants that were really rather revolting (I love alliteration).  The mother puts her arm around me, and then the unthinkable happens.  She takes my hand, which is resting on my lap, and places it on her upper thigh AND PUTS HER HAND OVER MINE SO I CAN'T TAKE IT AWAY.  The photographer takes about 8 pictures in order to get the ""perfect one,"" so my hand was resting on this thigh for what seemed like an interminable amount of time.  I still don't know what was worse; this horny broad had a giant grin on her face or the fact that that was the furthest I've gotten with the opposite sex.

Despite all that weird shit, I really enjoyed my time as a mall Santa.  If I wasn't so tired, I would write about three really positive experiences.  Maybe tomorrow, since I have to wake up early so I can take some tests and get on out of Siena for a month."

"event","Its seven degrees outside right now and its pretty icy.  Thank you Siena for not icing the parking lot or walkways today, its only by the grace of God that I was blessed with enough driving and walking coordination that I didn't crash or tumble tonight.  I always forget that I hate winter.  Once the cold and wind are bitter, the roads are coated in snow and/or ice, and I have to wear gloves, I remember ""Oh yeah, winter fucking sucks.""

Just finished writing a paper for my political thought class.  Marxism was coursing through my veins and it is evident in the five pages of Communist propaganda I just churned out.  But really, is it that such a bad thing?  I mean, its not my fault that the social issue I chose of economic inequality just so happens to be the perfect topic for launching into a diatribe that matches my own Marxist leanings?  Oh well, hopefully the professor digs my ranting and raving about workers needing to lose their chains and all that cool rhetoric that Marx and Engels unleash in the last few pages of the Communist Manifesto.  Even if she doesn't, Marx is still a badass.

I have on Rob Zombie's greatest hits on right now.  Even though I think his post-White Zombie material he recorded under his own name were interesting, the songs are just too generic for him.  I enjoy the songs, but most of them (especially the Sinister Urge songs) just seem like he's going through the motions.  I can forgive him for that though, since House of 1000 Corpses was such a badass movie that I think it will always be one of my top ten favorite films.  Maybe one day I'll dedicate a journal entry to my favorite movies....it's a thought.

Nothing else really going on right now, so I think I'm going to get some sleep now.  I have no class now and no finals until Wednesday, so it looks like it should be a good sleeping day.  Maybe I can finish Be Cool and start Solipsist tomorrow.  I think I can, Elmore Leonard reads quickly and Rollins' book isn't too long.  Maybe, just maybe I can start For Whom the Bell Tolls or Helter Skelter before Christmas.  It looks like I will fall well short of my goal of reading 100 books between last Christmas and this one.  I'm currently reading number 35 and it doesn't look like I can get much higher than 36 or maybe 37 if I really try.  Maybe the goal for next year will be 50.  It seems more attainable, I mean 100 books is like one book every 3-4 days.  As much as I would like to do that, I get too lazy or sidetracked with other shit to really do that.  Besides, some of the books I've read are huge.  The Che book I read was like 900 pages, and some of the Hunter S Thompson collections I read are slow readers and pretty long.  Oh well, I think 50 sounds perfect for next year.

Enough of that now, I'm going to bed..."

"event","I don't really have anything of any particular importance to say right now, but I feel like putting something down here to kill some time before I do some schoolwork.  So, with that being said, I made a mix today of some stuff I have been listening to and I decided that right now I am going to put down the song list and supply you, my devoted audience, with some morsels of my thoughts as to why I put them on this cd.

1) Motley Crue - Shout at the Devil:  Well, with the news last week that the Crue is back together for a reunion tour next year, I felt obligated to put them back in my playlist rotation.  This song is probably my alltime favorite Motley Crue song and is probably one of the best songs they've done (more on that when I do an artist profile on them some time in the future).  It's a great song to open the mix with since it has a lot of energy and really just rocks as much as or more than anything else that has come out in the 20 years since this song came out.

2) Brides of Destruction - Natural Born Killers:  Brides of Destruction is a ""supergroup"" consisting of the drummer of Adema, the guitarist of L.A. Guns, Nikki Sixx from Motley Crue, and an unknown singer.  Alright, so they might not really be a supergroup but I still think this song is cool.  It has a pretty cool riff, the singer (named London)does a decent job singing the song, some dumb lyrics, but overall its enjoyable.  London's singing is the weakest part of the song and really all their songs since he is kind of a lame version of Chris Cornell and Gary Cherone of Extreme (and it don't get much lamer than Gary Cherone folks).  Despite that, I like this song, it has a good flow to it and it's easy to sing along with.

3) Brides of Destruction - Shut the Fuck Up:  This song is one of the weaker songs on the mix.  It really only made it because the music to it is sick.  It has a heavy riff and background vocals that remind me of old school Misfits songs.  Other than that, the lyrics are easy to sing along to, but are still pretty stupid.  And London's voice is pretty annoying on it; if the Brides had a better singer and didn't put a stupid skit in front of this song, it would be a lot better.  Despite that, I'll buy pretty much anything Nikki Sixx puts out since he's cool as hell.

4) Soundgarden - Burden in my Hand: Chris Cornell is amazing.  His vocal range is ridiculous and he gets to show a lot of that on this song.  I stumbled upon this song when downloading a bunch of random Soundgarden songs and man am I glad I got this one.  Out of the first four songs on the mix, this easily has the best lyrics and vocal performance.  It's not as murky sounding as a lot of Soundgarden songs and the music to it matches up to the quality that Cornell brings to everything he does.  It's also not as long and drawn out as other Soundgarden songs, making this one pretty freaking good.

5) Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds - Stagger Lee:  This song, for lack of a better description, is fucking crazy.  This song is a cover of an old rhythm and blues standard, but Cave changed the lyrics into something completely different.  This is a song that most would find disturbing, since it contains references to drinking, murder, fellatio, homosexuality, and more murder.  Add to that the classic Nick Cave sound and you get a song that is a compelling listen, even if ""normal"" people should be repulsed.

6) Primus - Pork Soda:  Les Claypool has made some pretty demented music and this song is no exception.  I have no idea what the lyrics to this song are, much less what they are about, since his crazy redneck warble is pretty much incoherent on this song.  What's awesome about this song is the music to it.  Claypool is a fantastic bass player and this song shows off his talent.  The bass is heavy as hell and the drummer and guitarist do their part.  I usually listen to this song on my computer, but when placed in any stereo worth a damn, I was blown away by how heavy the rhythm is.  This isn't Primus' best or even most fun song, but it's pretty freaking good.

7) Nine Inch Nails - We're in this Together: Trent Reznor has written and recorded so many amazing songs.  His lyrics are usually depressing and/or violent and this song has some fairly bleak lyrics, the way they are sung within the music almost makes this song sound hopeful.  His vocals on the song are really compelling (I've alreayd overused that word, but it's still the best descriptor I have).  Everyone focuses on how hopeless and depressed Reznor usually is, but he has created some amazing melodies that make any whining sound enjoyable.  At the very least, one can dance to his uptempo songs.  This song has a pretty good riff to it and even though it clocks in at 7 minutes, it doesn't feel that long.  All in all, this song is a pretty fun listen for a Nine Inch Nails song, even for those who aren't really fans.

8) Pantera - Cowboys From Hell:  In honor of Dimebag Darell I had to put one Pantera song in and this one happens to be my favorite.  He played a lot of great riffs and this one is one of my favorites of any guitarist, ever.  The song isn't as hardcore as other Pantera songs, but don't hold that against it.  Besides the great riff, Phil Anselmo provides a cool vocal performance that smacks of both 80s glam and hard rock.  This song puts a smile on my face when I hear it.  Plain and simple, Cowboys from Hell is pretty kickass.

9) Anthrax and Public Enemy - Bring Tha Noise:  Public Enemy is one of the greatest rap groups ever and Anthrax is one of the best bands in the metal genre, so the combination of the two works really well.  Chuck D's imposing voice is backed up strongly by the music Anthrax provides.  This is a great song to get pumped up to and is, in my humble opinion, the best combination of rap and rock ever.  Chuck D's voice is always so commanding and the heavy sound provided by Anthrax amplifies it about a million times.

10) Green Day - Boulevard of Broken Dreams:  This is one of my favorite songs off the American Idiot album.  It is a familiar Green Day sound, but it is something different at the same time.  Within the concept of the American Idiot album the song works perfectly and it stands up well on its own as a single.  Billy Joe's voice isn't annoying on it and the music is pretty simple, but more complex than what one would expect from Green Day.

11) Nine Inch Nails - The Fragile:  Another Nine Inch Nails song that isn't as depressing or as violent as the rest of their catalog of songs.  This song is really a love song about being someone's support even when things get tough.  The gradual rise in the music and the vocals from soft and quiet to loud and heavy really works well and makes it something different from Trent Reznor, but different in a good way.

12) The Nightwatchman - Union Song:  The Nightwatchman is Tom Morello playing acoustic and singing, unaccompanied by anyone else.  His voice is far from being great, but it works as a standard folk song.  The lyrics are imbibed with the political message that Morello fans have come to expect and his style of ""singing"" works well with the lyrics and the simple, uptempo strumming on the guitar.  This song made it on the mix as a way to change up the pace of the mix, as well as providing a fun little break after the heavy sound of Nine Inch Nails.

13) U2 - Vertigo:  U2 is far from being one of my favorite bands, but I enjoy Vertigo greatly.  For one song, Bono wasn't whiny and self-important and the band took a break from using the same guitar and rhythm sounds that they've used for the last 25 years.  This song is a fun U2 song, something that they don't have many of.  Vertigo makes me forget my dislike of Bono (which I will discuss at some point) and actually enjoy U2 for once, even if they ripped off the concept of singing the chorus in Spanish from Spanish Bombs and Should I Stay or Should I Go by the Clash.

14) The Raveonettes - That Great Love Sound:  A modern garage rock song that doesn't suck, this song reminds me of some of the pop-rock songs of the 50s and 60s.  The vocals on the song are sung jointly by a male and a female and they provide a decent harmony.  The lyrics are catchy and easy to sing with.  It doesn't have that forced sound that I think other garage bands like the Strokes or the Hives have.  It sounds natural and would have been a monstrous hit 35-40 years ago.

15) Iggy and the Stooges - Down on the Street:  The Stooges are one of the baddest and heaviest bands ever and the fact that they didn't get voted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame this year really irks me, but I digress.  Iggy is the baddest man in rock history and even now at like 60 years old could still beat the shit out of any current rock act.  Down on the Street rocks like few songs have since.  I wrote about it a few weeks ago, so I'm not going to spend much time on it, other than to say that this song and all of the Stooges albums are essentials for any fan of real punk and hard rock.  This song has brutal vocals and brutal music put to them and really, that is that.

16) The Doors - Peace Frog:  This song is probably my favorite Doors song.  I've talked about this one before too, so I'll try to keep it simple.  Krieger supplied a funky riff and Morrison brought his sweet vocals and some unique lyrics to this one.  It has an amazing groove and despite this being near the end of the Doors and of Morrison's life, he actually sounded like he wanted to sing this one.

17) Black Flag - My War:  I didn't put this on the mix for any particular reason other than the fact it is my favorite Black Flag song.  It picks up the intensity that drops in the mix between Down on the Street and Peace Frog and adds to it tenfold.  Rollins is screaming at his manic best and Greg Ginn plays loud and furiously.  I've talked about this song before, so I won't say too much more about it other than the fact that it is probably Black Flag at the peak of their career.

18) Velvet Revolver - Slither:  I hadn't heard this song or put it on any mix in a while, so I gave it the coveted closing spot.  This song really combines the best of Stone Temple Pilots with the best of Guns 'N' Roses, while at the same time standing up to the legacy both bands left.  While I don't like Velvet Revolver as much as I like the two bands their music came out of, this song is heavy and rocks like no other band in the mainstream has in a long time.  And it's nice to hear this song and know that Scott Weiland, Slash, and Duff aren't dead.

That is that.  Maybe at some point I'll update again with something of some importance, but I'm not making any promises."

"event","I've been reading the comments left on my journal as of late and am pleased that most of it is positive and the things that are negative are great to see too.  It's nice to know that I have such an expansive fanbase that even people who hate me read what I write.  But I noticed on my last entry, that I received quite a bit of commentary and well, after reading it is apparent that my intent in writing this journal has been so skewed and misinterpreted that I'm giving serious thought to ending the livejournal experiment.  Here are the comments, and afterwards I'll say my piece.

At roughly 8 pm on the 12th, Anonymous (if that's his or her real name) left this lovely message:
Okay Asshole I don't know who you think you are but I barely know you and I already fucking hate you ... you spout off bullshit that you know absolutly nothing about! You need to worry about your own god damn business ((because you obviously have serious mental issues)) and stop commenting on everyone elses lives. Let them live their lives and be who they are. If you don't like who they are because what you think they do is against ""your high morals"" then ignore them ... cut them off. Don't write about people that don't give a fuck about what you think. Grow up and get some balls. If you really have a problem with someone say it to their face! I know I'm being a hypocrite for saying that then writing to you through livejournal but it had to be done! FUCK YOU and your fucking mooseknuckle. Grow up and mind your own business ...

HAVE A NICE LIFE ASSHOLE!

So, since I always appreciate comments and like to let people know that I have received them, I left this:
Wow, that was really well articulated. I didn't know that asking for an honest government or for people to show respect to each other and their property gave me mental issues. If I need to mind my own business and you barely know me, then why are you reading my journal? If no one gives ""a fuck about what"" I think, then why did you bother putting your eloquent post on my journal? And at least I can spell ""absolutely"" right.

Then, Anonymous wanted to let me know that he or she received my message loud and clear:
oh just fuck off ... nothing can begin to justify how quick you are to judge other peoples' actions ...

Now this right here was fine.  I think that Anonymous and I have reached a critical point in our relations.  Evidently Anonymous didn't like what I had to say about some things and feels that I am trying to tell people how to live their lives.  I can see how Anonymous would get that feeling, but I honestly am not trying to make people live a certain way, its not my business. BUT, and this is a big BUT (haha) this is MY journal, I write it to speak MY mind and vent how I feel.  I don't write this to outline some grand morality scheme for everyone to live by, I write about what bothers me.  Since this is MY journal, where I reveal MY thoughts, I'm allowed to do that.  I write this journal for MY benefit, so I can put down my thoughts and feelings on a plethora of things and also to give my friends who I don't talk to as much as I could a chance to see where my state of mind is.  I don't write this to preach to anyone; with the exception of the entries about musicians, everything I write in here is verbatim what I would write in a notebook.  I don't write in this to appeal to the masses to change their lives or to tell people how they live their lives.  I write to give my completely honest perspective on life and to pull any punches or not write about the disgusting behavior of some people would make me and this journal a sham to anyone who reads it, as well as being a disgrace to myself.  The best part about this is that since this is my journal, written out of purely selfish and narcissitic behavior, I don't have to justify my thought process to anyone, ever.  I know how I get from point A to point B and since I write what is on my mind, I'm not going to outline and justify why I feel the way I do.  If Anonymous or anyone else doesn't like what I write or thinks I'm an ""asshole,"" then don't take the time to read my thoughts, much less misinterpret them or comment.  If I should fuck myself and my mooseknuckle and you and others don't give a fuck about my thoughts, then don't take the time to read my entries.

Alright, then yesterday, Anonymous (a different person judging by the style of the writing) left a message:
When a person's judgement is clouded, its left in the hands of others to tell them where they're fucking up. Hopefully on some level they will understand, if not they're probably a lost cause and deserve the consequences of their actions whatever they may be. Is it really a bad thing to try and help other people be the best they can be? 

Anyways whoever you are, your choices are your own- but if they turn out badly, dont expect people to rush to your aid if you're going to treat them like this. 

Now I appreciate this person trying to defend my thoughts to someone, but it's hardly needed and the comment misses the boat a little.  I am not trying to tell people that they are ruining their lives or doing a pre-emptive ""I told you so.""  I'm not trying to warn people of the consequences of their actions, nor am I really trying to help people be the best they should be.  I am just putting down my honest thoughts about how fucked I think people and things are.  If I wanted to call this stuff to someone's attention I would call him or her up and tell them, ""Hey you're a shithead.""  To reiterate, I use this journal as a real journal and as a forum for people who know me to see where my head is at.  Sure, I would like to see society live up to its potential, but I'm not saying do this or don't do that.  In my entries that I believe Anonymous 1 and 2 are referring to, I am not naming any specific individuals or trying to save humanity; I am just expressing my totally honest opinion on what I see and how it bothers me.

Evidently, it seems like my journal and my thoughts behind it have been either a) taken as personal insults and jabs and/or b) a form of tyranny.  Sadly, neither scenario is correct.  My journal is what it is.  Read it if you like me, or even if you don't.  But if you don't like what I say and it makes you full of anger and hate and your mouth tastes of blood at just the thought of me telling you how to live your life, then just close the browser or don't even bother going to this journal.  My thoughts are what they are, sorry that you think I'm being a crusader.

This is the only time I am going to do this, but I am going to leave the fate of my journal up to the readers.  If I should continue to update this, email me or IM me or leave a comment so I know.  If you don't think I should use this journal anymore, email me or IM me or leave a comment so I know.  Then, based on the response (if there is any) I can decide what to do with this."

"event","I didn't get the chance last night to write a full entry and I might be too busy on Saturday or Sunday to put up anything worthwhile, so I'm going to try to touch on something now while I have Nick Cave on and feel particularly motivated.

I worked Thursday night as Santa at Colonie Center.  Pretty decent night for the most part, but one moment sticks out in my mind.  This woman and her toddler son came in for a picture with Santa.  When I asked the child what he wanted for Christmas, his mother said ""for Daddy to come home from Iraq.""  The mother and son then sat down for two pictures, one for home and one to send to Daddy in Iraq.  This was the second time that I've had a female come in and ask for her significant other to come home from Iraq and it's really heartbreaking.  I wouldn't like very much to be in Iraq on Christmas, away from my family and I wouldn't want a loved one over there in that position either.  Of all the places to be on Christmas, stuck in the desert fighting people who want you out of their country by any means necessary has to be the absolute worst.

I didn't get the chance to say what I really wanted to say to these people who came to Santa, and really anyone who has a loved one at war or has lost one.  Given the chance, this is what I would say: If I had my way, your spouse/boyfriend/father of your child/family member would never have even been in Iraq.  If I could change the past, our government wouldn't have lied to everyone at the expense of your loved ones' lives.  If I had the power to right things, that blood money Dick Cheney and Halliburton have made through overcharging the government and sending troops into a combat zone would go to all of you, even though I know no amount of money can ever make up for the time away from the people you love.  In a just world, your spouse/family member would be at home safe and sound for Christmas while Holy Warrior Bush, Fuhrer Cheney, the Halliburton execs, and the rest of the goons would spend the holiday away from their swank homes and instead spend it in Iraq, fighting a war they started and now can't seem to end.  At the very least, your leaders should experience what is going on, rather than use their spin to make the ""battle on terrorism"" in Iraq seem like it's a rousing success.  Instead of the politically correct Christmas carols being played in their whitebread homes, these words to a Bob Dylan song would be played over and over again so our leaders never forget the guilt they deserve for the heartache and suffering they have caused to the thousands of families who will be missing someone important in their lives come December 25th:

Come you masters of war
You that build all the guns
You that build the death planes
You that build the big bombs
You that hide behind walls
You that hide behind desks
I just want you to know
I can see through your masks

You that never done nothin'
But build to destroy
You play with my world
Like it's your little toy
You put a gun in my hand
And you hide from my eyes
And you turn and run farther
When the fast bullets fly

Like Judas of old
You lie and deceive
A world war can be won
You want me to believe
But I see through your eyes
And I see through your brain
Like I see through the water
That runs down my drain

You fasten the triggers
For the others to fire
Then you set back and watch
When the death count gets higher
You hide in your mansion
As young people's blood
Flows out of their bodies
And is buried in the mud

You've thrown the worst fear
That can ever be hurled
Fear to bring children
Into the world
For threatening my baby
Unborn and unnamed
You ain't worth the blood
That runs in your veins

How much do I know
To talk out of turn
You might say that I'm young
You might say I'm unlearned
But there's one thing I know
Though I'm younger than you
Even Jesus would never
Forgive what you do

Let me ask you one question
Is your money that good
Will it buy you forgiveness
Do you think that it could
I think you will find
When your death takes its toll
All the money you made
Will never buy back your soul

And I hope that you die
And your death'll come soon
I will follow your casket
In the pale afternoon
And I'll watch while you're lowered
Down to your deathbed
And I'll stand o'er your grave
'Til I'm sure that you're dead

At the very least, if I couldn't say all that to these families, I would listen to their stories.  God knows the government hasn't."

Here's to the crazy ones. 

The misfits. 

The rebels. 

The troublemakers.  

The round pegs in the square holes.  

The ones who see things differently. 

They're not fond of rules.  

And they have no respect for the status quo. 

You can praise them, disagree with them, quote them,  

disbelieve them, glorify or vilify them. 

About the only thing you can't do is ignore them.  

Because they change things. 

They invent. They imagine. They heal.  

They explore. They create. They inspire. 

They push the human race forward. 

Maybe they have to be crazy.  

How else can you stare at an empty canvas and see a work of art? Or sit in silence and hear a song that?s never been written? Or gaze at a red planet and see a laboratory on wheels?  

We make tools for these kinds of people.  

While some see them as the crazy ones, 

we see genius. 

Because the people who are crazy enough to think

they can change the world, are the ones who do."

"event","Listening to some old David Bowie songs.  God damn, that man can sing.  I mean he has that sweet old school Sinatraesque singing voice that is really so different than any other pop singer's style.  Not to mention, the songs are amazing.  I would love to hear anyone come out now with something as catchy, fun, and unique as Golden Years or Suffragette City.  It just can't be done.

The mall Santa job has been pretty interesting, it's a shame that it ends in two weeks.  For all the screaming kids and little beasts that try to rip the wig and beard off, its been something else.  My favorite visitors are the mentally handicapped people who come to see Santa.  They are so sweet and excited to see Santa that it actually makes me smile to think about it (Yes, I do smile for those who doubt).  One mentally retarded couple told me they wanted to get married for Christmas and they both gave me a monstrous hug.  Another retarded person about my age was so excited to see Santa that he lifted me out of the chair to hug me and profusely wished me a Merry Christmas.  A couple have given me a kiss on the cheek and wished for me to have a great Christmas.  Almost all of them have really beautiful Christmas wishes.  Nearly all of them have asked for their family to be safe and happy; another person asked for their mother to have a really nice Christmas because she's a good person.  Another person who was blind came to see Santa and wished for one of his brothers to find a job, his other brother to have sound mental health next year, and for his mother and father to have a really good Christmas and 2005.  It is really touching to hear these wishes, and at the same time it makes me feel guilty.  These people have had lives that are certainly a lot tougher than my comfortable upbringing, yet their wishes and personalities are so much more selfless than mine.  It really puts a lot of things in perspective.

People, including me, are very self-centered.  I have it so good and so do a lot of other people, but what do we do with that gift?  We waste it on trivial nonsense that doesn't help anyone.  Some people might say, ""Why should I/we care about what happens with other people if it doesn't affect my/our lives?""  And many people say that, I have heard it several times from too many people.  The point is that there are people who don't have the happiness we've been blessed with and could use help, love, and attention.  There are things that, even if they don't affect us personally, affect a lot of other people.  If you and I have it so great and there are so many others who don't, maybe its time to do something about it.  Maybe if we get over our own self-involved lives where everything is about us, we can make sure that everyone at least has the opportunity and means to have things so well.  I know that I am willing to sacrifice and work to make sure that the disadvantaged and their loved ones don't have empty dreams of happiness and a better life.

I have never had to overcome any great obstacles to be who I am or get to where I am and for that I am eternally grateful.  But that doesn't change the fact that there are a lot of other people that haven't been as blessed as I have.  To live life not caring that there are people who suffer every day is ignorance.  To not talk about how bad racism is, how bad poverty is, how hard it is for a family with a physically or mentally ill member to get by is just part of the problem.  Yes, life is great for me but it could be so much better for people who aren't me.  To not be angry or upset over how bad some people have it is part of the problem.  I know that racism and homophobia drive me off the deep end and there is so much of it around, so why should I sit here and talk about how great life is?  I'm neither a person of color nor a homosexual but it still disgusts me to see how far some people will go to deny others a chance to live happily.  Millions of children live in poverty and eat less in a month than I have the opportunity to eat in a week.  Why should I sit here and talk about how great my life is when I know that so many people don't have a great life?  How does one sit here and be peaceful and content when they can see that there is so much that they can do to make this sick world a better place?  I don't know either, but maybe if we aren't so complacent questions like that don't have to be asked."

"event","As much as I would like to write about a musical artist or group, I just don't have it in me right now.  This morning, there are some other things I would like to address.

One, there is nothing glamorous or wonderful about getting really fucked up and doing fucked up shit.  To paraphrase Henry Rollins, you don't put sugar in the gas tank of your piece of shit car, so why pump your body (the only one you get) full of chemicals that just do it damage?  And I don't want to hear the ""lighten up man, its what you do when you're young and in college"" line.  No, it's what you do when you're too fucking weak and insecure to be yourself.  Why deal with real thoughts and the real world when it's so much easier to drink until you puke and/or pass out?  That's the way to do things man!  Let's get so bombed that we can't even think and then go break shit!  YEAH!  Fucking morons, you're sickening.  Don't even try to talk and act like you are offended and concerned about the sorry state of our country when you go out and get hammered and break vending machines, rip sinks off walls, and deface pieces of your campus that are paid for with your tuition?  You are the problem, not the solution.  Your extermination would be an effective birth control, then you and your ilk can't fuck it up for the rest of the world.  Stop drinking for a minute if you can and actually think about what you are doing to the things around you.  If you are feeling particularly frisky, you could try reading a book or doing some critical thinking (GASP)about something like inequality or bigotry, not how to get to the store that sells the cheapest booze.

This brings me to the second thing I want to address.  It is a problem that has been out of hand lately here at Siena and is really a problem that pertains to most everywhere.  This problem is bigotry.  Over the last few weeks, there has been an abundance of swastikas, Confederate flags, and white power messages all over my campus.  Another student put up on his profile on instant messenger a call to form a Caucasian Student Association in order to stop the minority threat to white culture on campus and to show real culture, not trivial poetry and hip swaggering gestures that he felt the minority groups represent.  Allegedly the student posted this as a joke, but a joke would never trivialize another race and when whites are 97% of the campus, why make fun of and alienate the minorities?  Being such a small group on campus already alienates these people enough.  This brings us to the problem.

It is 2004 and there is still a substantial amount of white people who act like we live in the deep south, circa 1954.  How does one's skin color, religion, or lifestyle choice make him or her a lesser person?  IT DOESN'T and as soon as everyone accepts that the world will be better off.  People who believe in that ""Great Aryan Race"" and ""White Pride Worldwide"" bullshit really need to get a clue.  Grow the fuck up and get on with your lives.  My life, or your life, or anyone's life isn't worth any less than anyone elses because of race, religion, or orientation.  The world is better off without people who hate others just because of the way they look or pray or fuck.

Next time you think you're doing what's right for the world, put down the Bacardi or copy of Mein Kampf and slit your throat instead.  You'll be doing everyone a favor."

"event","Again, did not have time to write an entry yesterday.  I swear I'll make it up with two entries in a day.  I have a feeling that I am going to have to do a lot of two entries in one day deal.

Breaking from the theme of classic acts, today I am going to write about one of my alltime favorite groups, Collective Soul.  Led by frontman Ed Roland, their first album entitled Hints, Allegations and Things Left Unsaid came out in 1993.  This album sold well due to the massive success of their first single, ""Shine.""  It also contained a solid mix of southern rock with classic Elton John style pop.  What many people don't know about the first album is that Ed Roland wrote and recorded all the songs on the album, then formed the group after he got a record deal.  In 1995, their self-titled second album came out.  This album sold well due to the success of the singles ""The World I Know,"" ""December,"" ""Where the River Flows,"" and ""Gel.""  In general the album fit into the popular alternative sounds of the time, but with Collective Soul's southern roots distinguishing them from the pack.  Their third album, ""Disciplined Breakdown"" came out about two years later and had a similar sound to their previous effort.  I don't believe that it sold well, which is a shame because great songs like ""Precious Declaration,"" ""Listen,"" and ""Blame"" were on it.  Their fourth album Dosage came out around 1999 and contained the hit single ""Heavy.""  The album was a departure from their previous albums.  A more electronic sound exists throughout the album, making it more of a heavy pop album instead of their southern alt-pop sound.  This sound evolved more in their fifth album, Blender.  ""Why Pt. 2"" was a fairly popular radio song, but the album didn't sell all that well.  Blender took that electronic sound from Dosage and went further with it, and the album is basically a pop album in the vein of Elton John and John Lennon.  Collective Soul then took a long break, featuring a greatest hits compilation, and have just recently put out their newest album yet entitled Youth.  This album continues on the path of Blender, but adds in a pinch of classic 70s glam into their pop sounds.

Well, as I said above, Collective Soul is one of my favorite bands ever.  I became a fan of theirs back when ""December"" came out and I have stuck with them since.  I enjoy their new albums, but its weird because their distinguishing qualities they used to get noticed are a lot different now.  It seems like Ed Roland traded in his southern man vocals for sleeker, pop styling.  It sounds great but I wouldn't mind hearing him go back to it once in a while.  I saw them live a few years back and they sounded just as they do on their albums, which is a good thing.  It was a good thing because there was no drop off in quality and ability.  At the very least, every Collective Soul album has been at the very least listenable and at the very most, a lot of fun.

Songs to Hear: December, Simple, Goodnight Good Guy, Needs, Energy, Where the River Flows, Gel, Love Lifted Me, Perfect Day (featuring Elton John), Listen

Albums to Hear: Self-titled, Disciplined Breakdown, Blender"

"event","Didn't get the time to post yesterday, so sometime this week I'll compensate with multiple entries.  I started this musical discourse on Aerosmith and tonite a band that is considered either highly overrated or the most brilliant band ever goes under my critical lens.  Of course, I am examining the Beatles.

Everyone knows the story of the Beatles and there is so much to tell about it, so I'll keep it simple.  The Beatles consisted of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr.  They honed their craft in Germany through the late fifties and the beginning of the sixties.  The Beatles came to America in 1964, they were the escape America sought in the aftermath of the Kennedy assassination.  Their infectious pop tunes took the nation by storm and the Beatles overtook Elvis as the top act in America.  Record after record, the Beatles music and Beatlemania took the world by storm.  Their popularity vastly exceeded that of any band prior and has only come close to being replicated by the aura Michael Jackson used to have before he went off the deep end.  In 1966, the Beatles revolutionized what an album could be with Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.  They were the first band to take in Indian influences, Bob Dylan stylings, and combine it with their own sensibilities.  They also changed what a band could do with their movies A Hard Day's Night, Help, Magical Mystery Tour, and Let It Be.  In the late 1960s, Lennon and McCartney had a battle of egos and George Harrison began to develop as a songwriter.  This led to the amazing White Album, Abbey Road, and Let it Be.  Lennon was highly experimental, Harrison was developing his own style, McCartney kept on plugging along with the sound that he still has today, and Ringo was Ringo.  Eventually, the egos and the changes in their lifestyles caused the Beatles to split up officially in 1970.  Lennon went on to put out songs that were either amazing or shit, before being killed in 1980.  Harrison had a few successful solo albums and really spent a lot of time out of the mainstream until dying in 2001.  McCartney has a very successful solo career and still sells out massive venues worldwide.  Ringo played Mr. Conductor on Shining Time Station and had a few hit singles that were penned by Harrison.

Some claim that the Beatles are overrated, others rank them with Jesus.  Really, the best band ever is subjective.  However, that being said, I would say that the Beatles are the most important band of all time.  No band before had ever went through the sheer craziness of what they endured.  No band prior and since have been such a cultural phenomenon.  Their music still is madly popular, as evidenced by the hits compilation ""1"" being the top selling album worldwide of 2001.  The Beatles basically created the pop genre and the whole concept of pop stars.  The early years get all the acclaim, but I personally prefer their work from Sgt. Pepper through Let It Be.  It was so experimental but so good, much better in my opinion than the naive pop of the early years.  This leads to the next part, my favorite Beatle.  My favorite is John Lennon, but George Harrison is close behind.  Lennon wrote and sang songs like ""Revolution"" and so many other anthems that live on today.  Harrison was vastly underrated as a songwriter and guitarist, his slide guitar work and his soft vocal style are a really nice change of things.  McCartney is an amazing bassist and he wrote many great songs, but he has spent a lot of time over the years trying to become known as the creative influence behind the band.  Also, they were the ones responsible for the British invasion that brought along the Rolling Stones, the Kinks, Dave Clark Five, and the Who.  Luckily there has never been any attempt to reform or create the Beatles by the band members, so their body of work and legacy remains largely intact.

Top Twenty Songs - The Beatles have too many brilliant songs to just put ten, so here goes: Drive My Car, Revolution, Let it Be, I've Got a Feeling, Strawberry Fields Forever, While My Guitar Gently Weeps, Blackbird, A Day in the Life, You've Got to Hide Your Love Away, Twist and Shout, Come Together, Get Back, Don't Let Me Down, Here Comes the Sun, Two of Us, Yesterday, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band, Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except for Me and my Monkey, Why Don't We Do it in the Road, Norwegian Wood

Top Three Albums - White Album, Abbey Road, Let It Be"

"event","The first band to be examined is the self-proclaimed ""America's Greatest Rock Band,"" Aerosmith.  This band consists of Joey Kramer on drums, Tom Hamilton on bass, Brad Whitford on rhythm and the occasional lead guitar, Joe ""Fuckin'"" Perry on lead guitar, and Steven Tyler on vocals.  Their first album was self-titled and came out in the early(very early) 1970s.  It featured classics like ""Mama Kin,"" ""Dream On,"" and ""Walking the Dog.""  This album is Aerosmith at their bluesiest, even bluesier than last year's Honkin' on Bobo album.  They followed this album up with the vastly underrated (and my personal favorite 'Smith album) Get Your Wings, which features my alltime favorite Aerosmith song ""Seasons of Wither,"" as well as ""Train Kept A Rollin,"" ""Lord of the Thighs,"" and ""Same Old Song and Dance.""  This album was overshadowed by their follow up, Toys in the Attic.  That featured the title track, ""Sweet Emotion,"" and ""Walk this Way.""  Then, Aerosmith released one more classic album, Rocks.  This featured ""Back in the Saddle,"" ""Last Child,"" and ""Lick and a Promise.""  Through these four albums, Aerosmith established themselves as one of the premier rock bands of the 1970s and put out a collection of songs that you can hear multiple times a day on your local classic rock station.  Unfortunately, drugs and alcohol tore the band apart in the late 1970s.  Perry and Whitford were replaced by the vastly inferior Jimmy Crespo and Rick Dufay, and Steven Tyler was smacked out of his mind and was near death.  In the early 80s, Aerosmith cleaned up and reunited for the album Done With Mirrors, a commercial flop and a huge step down from the raunchy blues crunch of their early albums. Aerosmith got a shot in the arm commercially when Run DMC redid ""Walk This Way,"" giving Aerosmith a whole new fanbase and a new chance to succeed.  They did so with the albums Permanent Vacation and PUMP, which were huge commercial successes and host to several top ten singles. By 1992 and the release of Get a Grip, the creative team of Perry and Tyler were writing songs with the top pop songwriters in order to record pop rock hits.  This bore songs like ""Crazy,"" ""Cryin'"" and the only Aerosmith song to go to number 1, ""I Don't Wanna Miss a Thing.""  By the release of Just Push Play, pretty much all Aerosmith songs were being written by people other than the band and Aerosmith went from being one of the alltime greatest hard rock/blues based bands to a successful pop act.  2003 saw Aerosmith return to their blues roots with the cover album Honkin' on Bobo, an album which some lauded as Aerosmith's successful return to their blues roots and criticized by others as too little too late in Aerosmith's hopes of regaining some of their blues credibility.

My own opinion is that Aerosmith should not record any more new albums.  Nothing that they have put out in the last 18 years matches up to their first four albums in terms of quality.  Aerosmith has traded in their reputation as one of the best bands of the 70s and of all time in order to become commercially viable and sell records.  They could have been like the Rolling Stones and put out their own albums just to put out their own music, regardless of success and toured on their reputation.  Despite the fact that I think they sold out their rock roots, they are a very good pop rock band even if Steven Tyler's voice is on the verge of dying.  Their old songs were fresh and had funky grooves for a group of white boys from Boston.  Joe Perry is one of my favorite guitarists and his style is distinct and raunchy and fun to hear.  Whitford and Hamilton are extremely underrated and Joey Kramer can hold his own.  I saw them live last year when they toured with KISS and they were surprisingly subpar and heavily favored the newer pop songs over their classic material.  ""Jaded"" will never make me get pumped like ""Back in the Saddle"" and ""I Don't Wanna Miss A Thing"" will never be as powerful a song as ""Dream On.""  If only Aerosmith was more concerned with being who they always were instead of playing just to be popular.

"event","I would like to take this moment to discuss an earlier entry called ""Burning Bridges.""  It has come to my attention that I might have hurt some feelings with my criticisms of some people.  I aired my feelings in this journal, which is a public forum, rather than to each person individually.  On that note I would like to say that this journal has been intended as a place for me to be completely honest about how I feel and what is on my mind and I feel that to not do that would be hurting myself.  Why keep a journal if I can't say what I feel?  And what's the point in making a private entry that no one can read but myself?  If I was to do that I would just write in a notebook, privately.  So, maybe I could have been more personal with my comments, rather than posting them rather informally here.  Despite that, the feelings that I put down in that entry were how I really felt and still feel.  If anyone who reads this feels offended by what I write, I highly urge you to respond to me.  If I wrote anything that hurt or upset anyone, let me know.  If you read something on here that makes you think I'm an asshole or that I'm way off base, then prove me wrong.  My screen name is gilbymania, my email address is gilbymania@yahoo.com and if I know or like you, you probably have my cell phone number.  If anyone takes umbrage over anything I have said about them or anything in general, contact me so we can talk about it.  I stand behind everything that I have say, for better or for worse, so if anyone wants to rip me a new one or tell me I'm a dick or ask me why I feel or think the way I do, I strongly urge them to speak up AT ANY TIME."

"event","I was sitting around here and felt obligated to write something, but not anything of real weight.  As much as I enjoy being the rain on everyone's parade, I just don't really have anything to rail and wax poetic about. Instead, I am just going to put a list of songs that I enjoy and some reasons why I think everyone should know them.  This is a warm up run for my new concept in December.  Starting December 1, I am going to devote one entry a day to a musical artist who I think warrants my special attention.  This will include a brief overview of band members, band history, favorite songs, and reasons for liking or disliking said artist.  But in the meantime, this list of songs should satiate the the thirst for my thoughts.  I'm going to try to keep this list down to one song per artist and if there is an artist who I like several songs by, odds are that they will be included in the December experiment.

Peace Frog by the Doors - There are a ton of songs by the Doors that I really enjoy, like When the Music's Over or Soul Kitchen, or countless others.  This one however has all anyone needs in a song from crazy lyrics about blood and dead Indians and LA and summer, to Morrison's solid vocal work, to the groove oriented riff.  Kind of weak as far as the full awesomeness of the Doors goes, but its a really fun song to listen to.

I Wanna Be Your Dog by Iggy and the Stooges - The definitive Stooges song, even though Down on the Street is a very very close second.  The Stooges were punk before punk even existed and this song shows it.  Everything in it, from the feedback, to the primal urgency of the guitar and bass lines, to the fucked up lyrics that only Iggy Pop can sing.  Seriously, who else can sing about wanting someone so desperately that they want to be their dog?  NO ONE!!

Hybrid Moments by the Misfits - This song almost sounds romantic, until you realize that Danzig is singing about the look on a woman's face before he kills her.  Despite that, it sounds like a 50s romantic song being played by a band on speed.  Everyone who claims to be punk should have the Misfits on their playlists, they just don't make music like it anymore.

My War by Black Flag - Speaking of punk, Black Flag is the real deal.  My War is a classic punk tale of alienation and anger and loneliness as only Henry Rollins can scream.  This song, album, and band were lightyears ahead of other punk bands and this song more than adequately sums up for me the way I feel about the world sometimes in a way I can't express.

Black Betty by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds - It's really hard to pick just one Nick Cave song to talk about, but I have to go with this one.  It is, plain and simple, fucking crazy.  Even without talking about murder, Satan, drugs, and all the other oddball topics of his normals songs, Black Betty is still amazing.  It has simplistic and almost tribal music, crazy lyrics about a lamb, and wild vocals that sound like they come from slave songs, folk songs, and tribal chants.  I know it doesn't sound impressive, but it is really like nothing I have ever heard before from Nick Cave or from anyone else for that matter.  Most normal, well adjusted people probably wouldn't give this song the time of day, but this one gets played and played often in my room.

Working Class Hero by John Lennon - While Imagine gets most, if not all, the glory, Working Class Hero is an equally amazing song.  This song just hooks a listener with its simple acoustic backing and Lennon's passionate and angered opinion of the treatment of the lower classes by the rich.  This song stands the test of time even now, as the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.  A more biting social commentary is hard to be found than the one in this song.

Welcome to the Terrordome by Public Enemy - I love Public Enemy.  Chuck D is probably my all-time favorite MC.  Public Enemy songs always bring social commentary and a feeling of empowerment to make changes in the world.  Welcome to the Terrordome has amazing beats and samples and Chuck D's rapping COMMANDS your attention and honestly, I love the phrase ""Welcome to the Terrordome.""

Thunderkiss '65 by White Zombie - Just an all around cool song.  I can't dance, but if I could, this song would make me do it.  The riff to this song has been burned into my memory and every time I hear it, I start to bob my head to it.  Damned if I know what the lyrics mean or what the hell Rob Zombie is saying in it, but despite that his ""singing"" on the track kicks major ass.

My Way by Butch Walker - This is the song that introduced me to Butch Walker.  It has that big rock sound from the 80s with just a smidge of the old school punk ""fuck you"" mentality and just a dash of power pop.  I love songs that are about being yourself and not conforming to what everyone else wants and this song is the best modern version of that style.  I dare you to listen to this song and not sing along.

Hurt by Johnny Cash - The greatest cover song of alltime, bar none.  There's really not much I can say about this song that hasn't been said by everyone else.  That doesn't mean I won't try though.  This song is so haunting, yet moving at the same time.  Johnny Cash took a Nine Inch Nails song about heroin addiction and turned it into his swan song, a sadly prophetic piece about nearing the end of his life.  Cash took a fairly current, Grammy winning song and made it into his own.  So good that no one can really ever cover it again and bring the same emotion to it."

"event","I really don't have anything in common with these people anymore.  I'm talking about my high school friends.  Seriously, either I've changed or they just fucking suck.  There are some bright spots, but a lot of my friends have just become pathetic.  There are many bright spots, but I'm a negative creep so they will be omitted (but much love to a lot of people for being really great, even if I don't take the time to single them out).

Cody Catalfamo - When I think of disappointing human beings, he really comes to mind.  He and I were really tight during high school, I mean we've been through some shit.  I've listened to him cry over problems and where is he now?  Who the fuck knows?  I could count on one hand all the times I've talked to him over the last two years.  I've made several attempts to see whats going on with him, but all I can gather is that he is too engorged in weed and booze to give a fuck.  It's really sad to see that one of your two best friends is too busy fucking himself up to even say hello.

Dan O'Connell - Dan is well on his way to becoming a statistic.  He had a sparkling 1.45 GPA last year and had to appeal to his college to be let back in.  In order to stay in school, Dan is now actually going to class a few times a week, as long as it doesnt interfere with reefer, booze, or video games.  Really sad to see your other best friend try to emulate Hendrix's lifestyle, not his creative style.

Aimee Chauvot - Just makes disappointing decisions.  There was a time when I thought she was really unique and cool, but it seems like she just does things to make and keep friends. This extends into her choice for college.  Young Aimee has decided upon Plattsburg as her college of the future, citing its easy access to legal drinking in Canada.  Also playing severely into her decision is the fact that her high school best friend attends said college.  As an afterthought, the university has an academic program she is interested in.  Call me fucked up and crazy, but I always thought college choices were based on an academic program and price, not how and where to get fucked up with your friends from yesteryear.

Really, I know that no one is perfect and that includes me.  There are people have been good to me and I haven't really returned the favor as well as I should and could.  This would mean people who have made efforts to contact me and I haven't always replied with the vigor and decency I should.  The people who made the above list have managed to do so just because I feel that they have been so disappointing.  There are also friends I have who might have changed or I might have lost some sort of rapport with, but it was to be expected and while it disappoints, it doesn't disappoint on the level of the people mentioned by name."

"event","Well, the 2004 Presidential Election has come and gone.  George W. Bush has somehow managed to legitimately win a second term.  The results isn't surprising, but it is rather disheartening that Amerika has given Bush and the GOP a mandate.  Not that I think Kerry was the answer; hell I didn't even vote for him.  Kerry and Edwards were nothing more than career politicians looking to win the ultimate prize.  Besides that, I couldn't vote for a guy who voted in favor of the war in Iraq, in favor of the Patriot Act, in favor of the censorship bill, basically leaving me with no reason to ever vote for him.  To boot, he ran a campaign that was based on ""anybody but Bush"" and really left little reason other than that for people to vote for him.  George W. Bush didn't get my vote either.  Man, he's fucked up this country like no other.  His regime has brought the first net loss in jobs since Herbert Hoover and the Great Depression, he left bin Laden lurking around so he could go depose Saddam, completely bungled Iraq, took money out of Social Security, started No Child Left Behind but didn't put the promised money into it, has given large corporations free reign at the expense of the working class, and has managed to go down in the books as having the administration with the most deficit spending ever.  George Bush's presidency could be described in one word: clusterfuck.  I voted for the only candidate who I felt actually had a real stand on what matters...Ralph Nader.  Nader was talking about all the issues that the two major parties won't; issues like stopping corporate welfare and crime, creating a living wage rather than a minimum wage, cutting the fat in government spending, and universal health cares were issues that he talked about and Kerry and Bush didn't.  I know Nader wasn't going to win and never will win, but that doesn't mean his message was wrong.

What is really disturbing is that despite the fact that Bush administration has failed and lied to the country, Amerika gave him a record amount of votes AND his party gained more control of the House and Senate.  Either Amerikans, are fascists, stupid, stupid fascists, or the Democrats are so woefully inept that they couldnt convince the nation to vote for them.  I'm leaning more towards stupid fascists.  Especially since 11 states passed gay marriage bans, Ohio even banned civil unions.  So much for that whole equal protection under the law thats in the bill of rights.  Amerika, you've really done it this time.  Thanks for being so blatantly racist, homophobe, and ignorant."

"event","Watched Nightmare on Elm Street and The Exorcist to celebrate Samhain.  My roommate showed those two movies as well as The Shining and Halloween, two vital films to celebrate the holiday.  Unfortunately, I wasn't around to watch them today but since they are my copies, I can watch them later if need be.  Listening to Nick Cave right now, man he's made some awesome fucking songs.  Listen to ""There is a Light,"" ""Tupelo"", ""Red Right Hand,"" or ""Do You Love Me"" for further validation.  Pretty quiet tonight, but it looks like last nite wasn't.  The water fountain is missing from the hallway, it looks like there was a struggle between the wall, the fountain, and a drunk kid.  There are also large splotches of sticky substances all over the floor, which completely kills any motivation to walk around barefoot.  Despite that, I'm not in a bad mood.  Actually, I feel pretty content.  That always happens whenever I finish some kind of school related work that I couldn't put off any longer.

Now, even though I feel pretty good right now, I would like to discuss something/someone.  Let's take this person I know and call him Dach Zoherty.  Now, let's say Dach likes to talk a lot about how bad things are and how much he wants to help end the world's ailments.  Now let's say that Dach further goes on to say that people hurt each other and don't respect each other's rights.  This Dach person seems like he's got a good head on his shoulders and really cares about the lives of other people.  Flash forward to Halloween night, let's read Dach's away message.  It says, and I quote, ""out to throw toilet paper and shit.""  Does that sound like the words of someone who has respect for others and wants to better the world?  I think it sounds like the words of a hypocritical fuckbag who wants to appear transcendent but really puts the rights and property of others behind his own cheap get offs and juvenile activities.  How can one care about how others live or show respect for others if he's covering their property in the same material that one uses to wipe their rear end?  Maybe this Dach should really listen to what he says and actually act on that, rather than be a dipshit.

But, enough of that.  Don't want to end the night on a negative note.  I watched Four Rooms this weekend and I highly recommend it to anyone.  The first story in it is pretty stupid, it has witches and Madonna.  The third story in it, directed by Robert Rodriguez, is pretty funny and is really fun to watch.  So is the last story, directed by Quentin Tarantino.  It's vintage Tarantino and has some of the best dialogue I have ever heard in one of his films.  I think I might have to bring Ed Wood to my room and watch it again, I love it.  That's it for tonight, need my beauty sleep and I need it bad."

"event","Someone needs to exercise population control.  Seriously, its getting ridiculous.  I guess I'll start off with the absurd, inoffensive moment.  At lunch today, I was strolling through the food area and the ice cream machine happened to catch my attention and not because I wanted ice cream.  There are three levers on the machine and a red light above each lever.  When there is no more ice cream in the column containing that particular lever, the red light turns on.  At this point in the day, two of the three lights are on, so there is one lever which contains ice cream.  So, this girl goes up to get her ice cream and guess what?  She doesn't go for the lever that contains ice cream.  No, she cranks like hell on the two levers that contain no ice cream and didn't even pull on the unlit lever once.  What the fuck is up with that?

Next, the second floor bathroom was closed today.  I can deal with that, I showered last night and the bathroom down on my floor provides an adequate toilet for releasing waste and a sink for washing and brushing my teeth.  The reason the bathroom was closed happens to earn my ire today.  Last night, the drunk white boys of the second floor decided to decorate the bathroom with shaving cream.  This decorating started at three a.m.  I know this as a fact because i was depositing some bodily waste whilst the shaving cream party started.  As I made my journey to the sinks, I happened to notice the large mirror that covers the wall had the following written on it:  FUCK WHITE PEOPLE      I HEART MEN.  I just happened to miss the cherubs that wrote that delightful message, but I could hear them laughing and bragging in the hall adjacent to the bathroom.  Evidently, they decided to alter the message overnight to FUCK NIGGERS    I HEART MEN.  Then they decided to go to town with shaving cream, applying it on everything but their faces.  The janitor was understandably offended and closed the bathroom this morning.  I am pretty sure that I know who the shaving cream artists are.  They are the same kids who wrote ""kill fags"" and ""white power""  all over several halls in the building and took chalk to the quad to write such delightful messages such as ""death to fags,""  ""kill queers,"" ""don't believe Siena's lies (in reference to the campus policy of diversity)"" and ""Homos spread AIDS.""  If I had it my way, these kids wouldn't get fined or maybe expelled.  They would get flogged repeatedly across the back, chest and face with a Singapore Death Cane.

Next, if you refer to my first journal entry, there was the Himmleresque student who felt that ""niggers cause all the trouble.""  Well today, we were talking about Bush and gay marriage and the mongoloid made an under his breath comment to the effect of ""we should kill all the faggots.""  Just as I was about to ask him what his fucking problem was, I noticed it when I saw the logo of his old high school.  He went to CBA, or Christian Brothers Academy for those of you unfamiliar with the Albany area.  CBA, based on the students from there who go to Siena, believe in a fuhrer, not a pope.  Either CBA breeds homophobia and racism, or the ones that go to Siena happen to be the Hitler Youth 2K4.  I thought that Christian schools preach respect and diversity and the fact Christ welcomed and loved diversity and not Hitler's Final Solution.  I'm about one step away from taking Himmler and severing his head from his body.  It's 2004 and we still have people who believe that ""white pride world wide"" bullshit.  It's so fucking pathetic that Amerikans can't just be compassionate or at the very least, shut the fuck up about people who might not look or act like them."

Nothing of particular note happened today, but I do want to comment on one thing; when did men/guys/boys become so lame?  Ladies, this doesn't mean that you're Kool and the Gang, it just means that you didn't happen to catch the attention of my maladjusted eye.  As I was saying, when did the male sex decide that wearing acid washed jeans, tight Abercrombie shirts, and sideways American Eagle hats was cool?  Maybe I'm just not with the trends, but dressing like the cast of the Real World and talking like the guy in Malibu's Most Wanted just seems oh so lame.  Maybe bandannas, Che shirts, shorts, and the back and forth switch between sandals and combat boots aren't cool but there has to be a middle ground.  There has to be a way to make the vanilla wafer student body all over Amerika not look like the cast of Queer Eye.  Instead of pumping money into Iraq, the government could spend money researching ways to stop making guys look like Elton John's life partner."

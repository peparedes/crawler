"event","&nbsp;Am rewatching &nbsp;<em>Batman Begins</em> and <em>Dark Knight</em> to prepare myself for <em>Dark Knight Rises</em> (and take my mind off the impending emotional explosion of Iron Man 3). And &nbsp;ok, I am a slasher, but Gordon/Wayne is a really good pairing cause those two have waay more chemistry together than Rachel and Wayne. I mean, holy crap, that scene where Batman reveals his identity to Rachel is like OOOH, THIS IS GONNA BE...erm, a bit underwhelming? and then at the last scene of Batman Begins where Gordon says<em> 'I never said thank you'</em> (or smth very similar) and Batman is all quiet for a few moments and then <em>'And you'll never have to',</em> part of me was like 'HOLD ON, THERE WAS SUPPOSED TO &nbsp;BE A LOVE CONFESSION HERE, NO?'&nbsp;<br /><br />P.S.: But I still ship Iron Man/Batman so hard. SO SO HARD. There should be a fic where Batman and Iron Man kick ass together in battle and are flawless and then also proceed to blow everyone's brains with science (except Banner's, cause he is their Science Bro).<br type=""_moz"" />"

"event","1. Favorite childhood book?<div class=""entry-content"" style=""margin: 10px 0px 0px; min-height: 100px;"">Um, I think that would be &quot;The Adventures of Neznaika and his friends&quot; by Nosov. Although I loved the author's semi-autobiographical stories about his son.<br /><lj-cut><div class=""entry-content"" style=""margin: 10px 0px 0px; min-height: 100px;"">2. What are you reading right now?<br /><br /><em>The Academ's Fury</em> by Jim Butcher<br /><br />3. What books do you have on request at the library?<br /><br />None, I use the library quite rarely.<br /><br />4. Bad book habit?<br /><br />Dog-earing books. Reading while eating, or eating while reading, which sometimes results in food stains.<br /><br /><br />5. What do you currently have checked out at the library?<br /><br />Nothing.<br /><br />6. Do you have an e-reader?<br /><br />Yes, though I use it primarily for holidays and books in Russian.<br /><br />7. Do you prefer to read one book at a time, or several at once?<br /><br />I prefer to read one book at a time, but sometimes fall into reading several books at once.<br /><br />8. Have your reading habits changed since starting a blog?<br /><br />Not much I think, my reading has become more varied, however I think the volume is still the same or similar.<br /><br />9. Least favourite book you read this year (so far)?<br /><br />It has got to be &quot;<em>What did you expect from a witch?</em>&quot; by E.Nikitina (in Russian). I'm still not sure why I stuck with it. The attempts at humour were terrible and I wanted to kill the heroine about midway through the book.<br /><br />10. Favorite book you&rsquo;ve read this year?<br /><br />It's a toss up between &quot;<em>Surely you're joking Mr. Feynman&quot; </em>and &quot;<em>Chronicles of a Curate&quot;.</em><br /><br /><br />11. How often do you read out of your comfort zone?<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Rarely, since I only have one discomfort zone: romance (granted I love Jane Austen and Georgette Heyer, but I mean &quot;quivering loins&quot; type of romance). I also don't read anything New Age or spiritual.<br /><br />12. What is your reading comfort zone?<br /><br />Pretty much everything except the stuff in point 11.&nbsp;<br /><br />13. Can you read on the bus?<br /><br />Yep.&nbsp;<br /><br />14. Favorite place to read?<br /><br />Anywhere I can be comfortable, so bed or sofa or armchair. But I do in on benches in sunshine and lying down on grass too.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />15. What is your policy on book lending?<br /><br />I lend quite easily as long I get my books back.<br /><br /><br />16. Do you ever dog-ear books?<br /><br />All the bloody time. :(<br /><br /><br />17. Do you ever write in the margins of your books?<br /><br />Very rarely and only in non-fiction books.<br /><br /><br />18. Not even with text books?<br /><br />If I ever did, then I don't remember.<br /><br /><br /><br />19. What is your favourite language to read in?<br /><br />Well, I read both in English and Russian and I don't have a preference. It's a different experience.<br /><br /><br />20. What makes you love a book?<br /><br />Interesting characters, interesting plot or beautiful language.<br /><br /><br />21. What will inspire you to recommend a book?<br /><br />If somebody is asking for recs and I know something that will suit them, I will rec a book. Otherwise I will only&nbsp;recommend books if I am gushing about them after reading.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />22. Favorite genre?<br />.<br />Can't say I have an absolutely favourite genre, but I suppose crime fiction is the one I read the most.<br /><br />23. Genre you rarely read (but wish you did)?<br /><br />I rarely read horror, but I don't particularly wish to read more of it, unless I spot something that catches my eye.<br /><br />24. Favourite biography?<br /><br />Um, &nbsp;Longford's biography of Wellington for sheer volume. I also loved an autobiography by a famous Russian actor Oleg Basilashvili.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />25. Have you ever read a self-help book?<br /><br />No.<br /><br /><br />26. Favourite cookbook?<br /><br />Don't really have one, though Joanne Harris's <em>&quot;French Kitchen&quot;</em> is wonderful.<br /><br /><br />27. Most inspirational book you&rsquo;ve read this year (fiction or non-fiction)?<br /><br />&quot;<em>Surely you're joking Mr. Feynman&quot; &nbsp;</em>by Ralph Leighton and Richard Feynman.<br /><br /><br />28. Favorite reading snack?<br /><br />Oh, ANYTHING. SERIOUSLY.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />29. Name a case in which hype ruined your reading experience.<br /><br />Can't think of one. I have read a couple of books because of the hype, but I knew going in that they were unlikely to be much to my taste and it was really a case of morbid curiosity.<br /><br />30. How often do you agree with critics about a book?<br /><br />Rarely pay attention to critics.<br /><br />31. How do you feel about giving bad/negative reviews?<br /><br />I don't have a problem saying whether I liked/hated a book.<br /><br /><br />32. If you could read in a foreign language, which language would you chose?<br /><br />Oh, ALL OF THEM?! But possibly Japanese or Chinese. Books in both are not translated enough.<br /><br />33. Most intimidating book you&rsquo;ve ever read?<br /><br />Books don't really intimidate me.<br /><br /><br />34. Most intimidating book you&rsquo;re too nervous to begin?<br /><br />None.<br /><br />35. Favorite Poet?<br /><br />Um, not big on poetry but somebody like Pushkin, Lermontov or Blok.<br /><br /><br />36. How many books do you usually have checked out of the library at any given time?<br /><br />These days one or two, but at school and uni, usually had the limit maxed out.<br /><br /><br />37. How often have you returned books to the library unread?<br /><br />I have returned books not fully read, when it came to study material.<br /><br /><br />38. Favorite fictional character?<br /><br />Sam Vimes and Vetinari and Nanny Ogg from Discworld series; Jack Aubrey from Patrick O'Brian's books. Erast Fandorin from Akunin's books; &nbsp;Gervase Fen from Edmund Crispin's novels; Roderick Alleyn from Ngaio Marsh's novels; Niccolo from Dorothy Dunnett's books; Dalziel and Pascoe; Lord Peter Wimsey. Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin... I could go on. XD&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br />39. Favourite fictional villain?<br /><br />Hmm, the main character of &quot;Perfume&quot; by Patrick Suskind; Dexter from &quot;Darkly Dreaming Dexter&quot; by Jeff Lindsay. Niccolo from Dorothy Dunnett's books can be sometimes very much a villain.&nbsp;<br /><br />40. Books I&rsquo;m most likely to bring on vacation?<br /><br />Anything I want to read at the time.<br /><br />41. The longest I&rsquo;ve gone without reading.<br /><br />Oh, um, books proper possibly a couple of weeks, but I still read fic and blogs and articles at the time.<br /><br /><br />42. Name a book that you could/would not finish.<br /><br />Lord of the Rings second time round.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />43. What distracts you easily when you&rsquo;re reading?<br /><br />If I am fully into the book, nothing. If I am not, then any passing thought can.<br /><br /><br />44. Favorite film adaptation of a novel?<br /><br />Master and Commander; 1995 version of Pride and Prejudice, Jurassic Park, Sphere, Disclosure.<br /><br />45. Most disappointing film adaptation?<br /><br />Onegin and the new Anna Karenina, also the latest Pride and Prejudice.<br /><br /><br />46. The most money I&rsquo;ve ever spent in the bookstore at one time?<br /><br />Um, I remember something like &pound;80 in an actual bookstore, but more at amazon.<br /><br />47. How often do you skim a book before reading it?<br /><br />Don't really skim books, just read the blurb if it's someone I know. If not, then I could buy just on the strength of synopsis, or I will google the author before buying.<br /><br /><br />48. What would cause you to stop reading a book half-way through?<br /><br />Anything. Characters, plot, language. Sometimes it's something I can't even put my finger on, just a general WTF feeling.<br /><br />49. Do you like to keep your books organized?<br /><br />I try to keep them organized by fiction/non-fiction first, then subject matter, then series if any.<br /><br />50. Do you prefer to keep books or give them away once you&rsquo;ve read them?<br /><br />ALWAYS KEEP.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />51. Are there any books you&rsquo;ve been avoiding?<br /><br />Mmm, there are books I definitely don't want to read like Twilight or Fifty Shades of Grey, but I don't avoid anything that feels like I would like it.<br /><br /><br />52.Name a book that made you angry.<br /><br />Anna Karenina by Tolstoy, which I loved, made me angry because I have a different view of the characters then you are taught at school, so I was <em>really</em> angry at the 'general' opinion not the book.<br /><br /><br />53.A book you didn&rsquo;t expect to like but did?<br /><br />Can't think of one. I usually expect to like all the books I buy. Just sometimes I love them a lot more than expected.<br /><br /><br />54. A book that you expected to like but didn&rsquo;t?<br /><br /><em>Swordspoint </em>by Ellen Kushner, <em>Three</em> by Ted Dekker, <em>Rusalka</em> by C.J. Cherryh. I also have a troubled relationship with C.S. Forester's Hornblower. The books are good, but the more I read the bigger my dislike for Hornblower himself was.<br /><br /><br />55. Favorite guilt-free, pleasure reading?<br /><br />All of my reading is guilt-free and pretty much all of it is for pleasure.</lj-cut></div></div>"

"event","&nbsp;Yesterday we got the keys to our new house. I used to tell most people, that I live in a village, though it's really a small town, but once we move into the new one in a couple of months (after the biggest jobs such as taking down couple of walls and putting new floors in are done) then we will truly be living in a village. There is a pub, a church across the road from it, a village hall, a biggish manor house, which to be honest I suspect used to be the vicarage and stables. The rest (30 or 40 houses) are residential.<br /><br />We had dinner in the local pub last night, food is good, decor is nice and the locals relatively friendly. Oh and the pub cat is v. cute and pettable and friendly. :D I did a victory lap on my bike inside the garage. XD Even my car will get a place to live.<br type=""_moz"" />"

Well, not really, just that most of my other hobbies are kind of obvious from my posts. I love crime stories, though when it comes to 'hardboiled' I dislike the new Scandinavian/British strain of really dark brooding suffering detectives. Yes, I like a well-rounded character and I realise not all people are happy in life, but, well, blame the Golden Age detective fiction.<br /><br />In recent years, especially last three or fourI have grown more and more fond of popular science reading of any kind i.e. physics, chemistry, biology, geology - it's all fun. If I have any regrets in life is that as a child I was not inspired enough to want to put in the work and go for scientific subjects at &nbsp;A-levels and later on at Uni. <br /><br />Despite what I sometimes write I am a rather unromantic person. I can't stand it when my husband tries being romantic, which is probably the reason we skipped the whole dancing around/chocolate/flower period and went straight to trying cohabiting. I don't mind romance (if not too over the top) in movies, fiction or other people's lives, but in my marriage I prefer to do without. I'd rather stay home and watch 'Waterloo' for the 50th time (because my husband forces me to) in my pyjamas, while munching snacks and 'pretend' fighting with the husband to having him 'sweep me off my feet.' I like them on the ground, thank you.</div></div></div></div>"

"event","&nbsp;It rained. Hard, but thankfully by the time we got there it wasn't raining quite so hard. We got there about twenty to 7, when it was going to start and we put our chairs and umbrellas very near the field set aside for the Cavalry display.&nbsp;<br /><br />The display was very cool. The first part was riders picking up things off post as they galloped past, then trying to do the same with a sword (1796 pattern :3 ), then cutting cabbages, then using, I am tempted to say lances, but those things looked more like spears to pick up small paper targets from the ground. :D<br /><br />Then they did a Jubilee cannon and musket salute (there was only one regiment represented, dunno which, but there were some &quot;civilians&quot; and a rifleman keeping them company) and the concert started in earnest. The first half consisted of Elgar's Nimrod (unfortunately the Spitfire didn't make it because of the rain), couple of arias and violin concertos and it ended with <em>1812</em> overture with canon fire and fireworks at the very end. MY GOD. IT WAS BEYOND AWESOME.<br /><br />Second half consisted of <em>Thunder and Lightning </em>polka, <em>Waltz of the Flowers </em>from the Nutcracker (people were encouraged to waltz to it, so my mom and I did, though I slid through mud several times as we were going fast XD ). then the Cavalry did another display set to music, which consisted of doing things like going in tight circles, two horse lines weaving through each other etc. :D Then. THEN. It was Beethoven's Battle symphony, he wrote on the occasion of the battle of Vitoria. They attempted all the 193 cannon shots, Beethoven set in his score, and though I didn't count, there were a hell of a LOT of them. Plus it was accompanied by musket fire and fireworks at the end. It was pretty spectacular. The only problem is that unfortunately this symphony is nowhere near as gripping or memorable as the 1812. :(&nbsp;<br /><br />It all ended with the, as my husband informs me, traditional trio: Jerusalem, Rule Britannia and Land of Hope and Glory. The last was especially spectacular, because again, that is a gripping piece of music and the FIREWORKS WERE BLOODY AMAZING and they were exploding pretty much over our heads.<br /><br />So all in all, it was all v. enjoyable, the rain did stop around the first piece of music they played and didn't start until it was time to go, but the field was a bloody swamp, our shoes and pants were caked with mud, and my ankle was HUGE, cause my leg was hurting as is and all the waltzing and walking through mud didn't help. XD But it was so worth it if only to hear the<em> 1812</em> with cannon fire. :D<br type=""_moz"" /><br type=""_moz"" />"

"event","&nbsp;Today I went to London to submit my husband's documents for a&nbsp;Russian&nbsp;visa. I thought I'd avoid bureaucratic brain rape, but while it was a mild case (a sort of intercrural brain rape), I didn't and ended up spending almost two hours at the visa centre. But! It ended up being a Good Thing, since a girl asked me a question about a spousal visa application and we got chatting and... It turned out she's not only Russian but comes from the same city, she's only a few years older than me and he husband's slightly older than mine (we both have antique husbands &lt;3 ) and she lives about 40 mins from us. :D We chatted very happily, went for coffee afterwards and exchanged phone numbers. :D And then I went for book/food therapy.&nbsp;<br /><br />And I dunno what is it about me, but why do I always get stopped and asked for directions/help so often? Today it was four times. Yes, I counted. XD&nbsp;<br type=""_moz"" />"

"event","&nbsp;Best thing about geeky things is sharing them and having friends who share your geeky interests. But I feel especially lucky that my parents also share some geeky interests of mine, or maybe I share<em> their </em>geekiness. Most of our shared geekiness usually concerns books or specific authors, but my dad is great for discussing Napoleonic stuff and weaponry with, and my mom can go on mile-long monologues about detective stories of Agatha Christie/Ngaio Marsh/Dick Francis/Nero Wolfe. It is an AMAZING feeling.&nbsp;<br /><br />Napoleonic stuff is especially good, as I've found out recently, to get most of my dad's side family members going though. XD&nbsp;<br type=""_moz"" />"

"event","&nbsp;So. The House. The house that Andy and I have recently moved to, Andy actually bought pretty much straight after separating from his wife. And then he didn't really live in it until now. Which means that it is full of junk. I've been able through the heartless tactic of <em>&quot;If you can't tell me in 15 seconds what this thing is and whether you've used it in the past month, I'm throwing it away,</em>' to sort out the living room, kitchen, bathroom and the guest bedroom, but the dining room and what I call 'the tiny bedroom' were still of things and boxes. So what with the long weekend we decided it was time. TIME FOR BOOKCASES.&nbsp;<br /><br />Andy loves books, but &nbsp;while he does have some in the house, pretty much all of his books went the way of rubbish heap when he separated from his wife, and that's the one thing I could punch his ex-wife for. &gt;.&lt; So up until we moved in he had just enough shelving for them. And then came my boxes of doom.&nbsp;<br /><br />So over the weekend Andy made three big bookcases (well, five big shelves each with a little space on top to put outsize books lying down). And he actually entertained the foolish hope that that will be enough. HA. While I managed by 'double-rowing' the top shelves with small books and by putting books flat on top of the ones standing up to fit in pretty much everything I had in the house (thankfully I got two small bookcases for the bedroom, so there was some space there. :) ), there are still four boxes of books in the storage Andy has been using for them and some books at Andy's mother's house.&nbsp;<br /><br />Andy has promised me two more bookcases. XD The Napoleonic Wars and Era took up one entire bookcase. Wellington has his own shelf, and some of the books didn't fit so I had to put them lying down on top of others. This was the first time in my life when upon taking out yet another Wellington biography I said <em>&quot;Oh for fuck's sake'. </em>XDD<br /><br />And there was also cleaning and stuff involved. I hurt now. x___x<br /><br /><strike><strong>GIVEAWAY:</strong> It turns out that I have two copies of<em> &quot;Life in Wellington's Army&quot; </em>by Antony Brett-James. If anyone's interested, I will gladly post it to you for free. First come, first served. :) &nbsp;</strike>Has been claimed.<br /><br /><br type=""_moz"" /><br type=""_moz"" />"

"event","<br />On 27th of December my fiance and I flew to Russia for New Year. Let me tell you people, I don't know how it is for others, but in my case having an ex-military fiance who still has atavistic/irrational fears of KGB is pretty hilarious. As we were landing I mimed attaching electrodes to him and made &quot;Bzzzt&quot; sounds. It was childish.&nbsp;I loled a lot. <br /><br /><lj-cut>We spent 28/29 December trying to see as much of Saint-Petersburg as we could: a task somewhat hindered by the amount of things worth seeing and the holiday closures. :( I nearly had to resort to dragging him out of the Miliary History Museum by the ears (but I got to see Napoleon's pistol captured by Austrians at Waterloo and presented to Russians and Imperial Eagles). My fiance nearly resorted to inappropriate touching of displayed items when we came across an 19th C British rifle (the make escapes me), which he never saw in real life before. <br /><br />I also had two teeth drilled on the 30th, after we saw my pregnant at the time (she gave birth on the 6th of January) friend and before we went to the Mariinsky (former Kirov) Theatre to see the &quot;<em>Fountain of Bakchisarai</em>&quot; ballet. Turned out I've never seen this particular ballet myself and it was awesome. :3<br /><br />On the 31st we sat down to have the New Year dinner at 11p.m. (a normal procedure in our part of the world). At 11:55, my fiance exclaimed: &quot;Where's Putin?!&quot; Hilarity ensued. Let me backtrack. Like the Queen's speech on Christmas Day in UK, in Russia the president gives a speech five minutes before midnight on the 31st. Which we told my fiance about. Turns out he didn't realise Putin was no longer our president. I can see how he made that mistake.<br /><br />At around 5:30 am on the 1st I decided it was time for people to go to sleep. My mother, grandma and mom's cousin ganged up against my fiance and the whole WWII&nbsp;discussion was getting militant. Dresden was mentioned. So was Molotov-Ribbentrop act. &gt;.&lt;<br /><br />At around 2pm on the same day we woke up to more guests and eating started again. (NOM&nbsp;NOM&nbsp;NOM) Then my friend and <em>her</em> fiance, who happens to be French arrived. He speaks very good English so the communication (helped along by whiskey and wine) was relatively easy. Somebody mentioned Entente. All loled. Then somebody mentioned Trafalgar. Russians ROFLED. To teach us manners the English and the French started speaking German to each other, which none of the Russians knew. (Of course Russian side promptly reverted to Russian and poked fun at the 'foreigners' XD&nbsp;). <br /><br />2nd Januray: more eating and family introductions.<br /><br />3rd: Flying back.<br /><br />5th was not so pleasant but we shall pass over this event. <br /><br />7th was Orthodox Christmas and I also got my original Christmas <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Peninsular-War-Atlas-General-Military/dp/1849083649"">present</a> from my fiance (it's arrival&nbsp;was massively delayed). :D<br /><br />On the 10th I went back to Aberdeen, 12th to sword practice&nbsp;and this Friday to college. On the way to college I was cracking up in the taxi, listening to the radio. They were discussing outrageous prices in some restaurant and how ridiculous it was to charge such prices for fare such as Scottish Eggs. They went to imagine an add for it done in &quot;French style&quot;: black and white images, a woman in trench coat (imagine a perfume ad, you'll get it) etc. and a deep male voice saying in the end &quot;L'oeuf d'Ecosse&quot;. The hilarity for me came primarily from imagining this as a slash ad and the fact that in Russian 'egg' is a euphemism for testicle.<br /><br />Here endeth the post. XD<br /><br />P.S.:&nbsp;Sorry. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0JelXjf_Lk"">THIS.</a> I WANT.</lj-cut>"

"event","<p><br />The last books of 2010:<br /><em><br />131. &ldquo;Mallory's Oracle&rdquo;<br />132. &ldquo;Black Sunday&rdquo; Thomas Harris<br />133. &ldquo;One False Move&rdquo;, Harlan Coben<br />134. &ldquo;Hanging Valley&rdquo;, Peter Robinson<br />135. &ldquo;Thirteenth editorial&rdquo;, Olga Lukas (Russian)</em><br /><br />I think I've done quite well, this year's total beats the previous one by 13 books. :DDD Out of the books I've read this year I'd like to highlight a few that I enjoyed the most:<br /><br /><em>4. &quot;Pursuit of Glory: Europe 1648 - 1815&quot;, Tim Blanning</em>.<br /><em>74. &quot;Alex's adventures in numberland&quot;, Alex Bellos</em>. A book about math, extremely well written and entertaining and math is awesome!&nbsp;:D<br /><em>76. &quot;Lamb&quot;, Christopher Moore</em>. Hilarious most of the time but also bittersweet and somewhat sad at several points in the book, but freaking amazing throughout.<br /><em>112.&ldquo;Doctor Dogbody&rsquo;s leg&rdquo;, James N. Hall&nbsp; </em>Age of sail tall stories style. Funny and unputdownable. <br /><br /><br />There were quite a few other books I thoroughly enjoyed but I can't really highlight anything by Ngaio Marsh, Reginald Hill, Ruth Rendell, Alexander Kent or Bill Bryson, since I can't really choose which ones I liked the most.</p><br />"

Originally my plan was to first meet up with a friend in NY and then leave for Anthrocon and then either return back to NY for a few more days or just go straight back to FL. But, Anthrocon doesn't seem like its going to happen. Why? because i don't have anyone to room with. And for this trip to happen i need a roomate(s) because i wouldn't have the money for hotel fees alone. There is a couple people that i know and trust who i wanted to room with. One of them is going through some problems and isn't going to attend anymore. The other is a lost cause...

So yeah it kinda sucks. Never been to a furcon but i had a feeling it would have been fun."

"event","Last week saturday i went to the Bamboo Nightclub with my girlfriend. Mind you this is the first time she had every gone to a club so it was a completely new experience for her. So we are at the club at i met up with my cousin. I introduced him to Linda and he told her how much i said i'm crazy about her and she had a huge smile on her face. We went to the bar and we were watching her cousin Natale dancing on top. Yeah, her cousin works there as a Gogodancer. So not only was my cousin there but her cousin was there also.

We called her so she could notice us and when she did she came over and practically placed her ass in my face and was dancing. I was lauging and at the same time moving my head back because my girlfriend was right there next to me and i'm sure it was weird to see her cousins ass in my face. Then one of Natale's friend came over and did the same thing ^_^. They gave me free drinks and i took Linda to the second floor so we could sit down on the couch. She then sat in my lap and we started kissing. The rest of the night we danced and talked then we left when the club closed. We went straight home and probably had one of the best night of sex ever. ^^  

all in all i have to say thats probably the best weekend i've ever spent with her. She went back to Gainesville for classes and i won't see her again until march so i can't wait."

Now where to start. I bought a ton of stuff on Black Friday. I think i got half my christmas shopping done that day for both myself and my family. Spent damn near $400 bucks at just Best Buy alone.

Now i'm just trying to get some decorations and alot of holiday stuff to make this christmas a really really good one.

Well aside from shopping all i'm been doing is working, hanging out with my girlfriend and friends and playing Gears of War. And as soon as i beat that damn final boss i can finally move on to my next game. ""Sonic the Hedgehog"". God i love my XBOX 360 ^_^."

"event","It was raining pretty hard yesterday. I actually didn't mind the rain because it was too hot outside so it was much needed. Linda told me that she and Sarah was going to BestBuy to get a few things and since i needed a couple things for my computer i decided to meet them there.

Driving in the rain of course doubled my travel time but i was suprised to get there before them since they left before i did. Well when i got there i was looking at HardDrives and stuff and then before i knew it they had arrived and was over in wireless looking at MP3 players. I walked up to them and Sarah noticed me and boy she was barely wearing anything. I asked her if she dressed up just to go to Besbuy and she said no, she said thats what she wore to school. I looked at her weird and she said it was her last day and she wanted to wear whatever she wanted.

So i got them some help and Linda found the MP3 player she wanted. Sarah wanted me to help her to pick a CD. ""by the way, she loves Country and Rap music"" O_O. Almost every CD i recommended she either have it already or doesn't like the artist. I told her she is very hard to please and she denied. I soon then found out she was just being a hardass and was purposely doing what she was doing just to get me riled up. I found her a Ludacris CD which she bought and then i walked off to the gaming department.

Samantha saw me and of course hugged me like she always does. This girl makes me wonder sometimes. i mean does she really like me or something? o.o i dunno.

I saw Doug and Beth and they seemed busy so i didn't bother them. I then saw Lauren walked in out of uniform and she came up to me, said she was sorry and then hugged me o.o. I didn't need to ask to know what that was about. She asked me if i was ok and i said i was fine. then she said Beth told her and thats how she knew. 

Lauren was asking beth if the Witch is gone and i was like ""huh?"" Beth said yes, Jon from DI heard and said she left yesterday. I then figured out who they were talking about and they said thats what they call her now. Don't know where they pick that up from but i just stayed quiet and walked away.

I was hungry and i asked Linda and Sarah if they wanted to eat and they said yes. Of course Sarah was being picky about where to eat. and she finally decided to go to a chinese buffet restaraunt. We got there and we got started.  We were making lots of jokes while we ate. It was mostly me and Sarah while Linda continued eating. We had so much until we couldn't eat anymore. And the Sushi they had was pretty good. mmmmm...

We talked for awhile after we ate and then we left and i followed them home. Linda had promised me a S-video cable so i went to get it. Their mom was home and we talked for a bit then i layed down and rest because i was so freaking tired. They had a extra computer monitor that they didn't need so i took if off their hands. ^_^

I stayed until 6:30pm then i left and went to buy some stuff at publix and then  i went home. 

That was pretty much my day and i had fun. 

I'm trying to decide what to do tomorrow. Its either Arena football or movie. I'll have to talk to them today and see what they want to do."

I had played one FF game and it was FF8 and guess what? I hated it. I hated the battle system and it just didn't enjoy it. Since then i stayed far away from any FF game. 

Now i decided to give FFXI a try to see what all the craze is about. After about 2 hours of installing the game i finally got it up and running. Unfortunately for me playing this game with the XBOX 360 controller isn't what i expected it to be like. So it seems like i'm going to have to buy a USB keyboard if i really want to see what this game has to offer. But so far i'm interested so thats a good thing."

Now i'm actually deciding to sell my 360 on Ebay and make some money ^^. I'll see if i can $1000-$1500 for it. Heck, with that much money i don't mind wating until January-February to buy the system again.

Also saturday i'm going to stop at Best Buy and buy a bigger Transflash card for my cellphone. I only have a 75MB card ""which came with the phone"" and it doesn't hold that much songs not to mention all the pictures and video's i have on there.

I think the biggest TFlash card Best Buy carries is the 256MB card. The biggest availble right now is 512 and i would love to get that one but i'll have to be satisfied with 256MB. That should hold a maybe around 50-60 songs considering most of the songs i have are 4-5MB in size.

Um, if i have the money to spare i might just buy 2 256MB but i'll be spending alot of money so i don't know yet. Also it depends on how much discount i get on the card. Its $44 a piece at BB but i might get it for half the price or even less.

Also i'll be going to the movies later on in the evening with a friend to watch Aeon Flux. It seems like a really interesting movie and Charlize Theron is so freaking hot. *drools*

So yeah, my Saturday will be pretty busy and i'll be getting alot done while enjoying myself."

"event","Its been almost a week since the launch of the XBOX 360 and i don't have one yet. Naturally its all sold out everywhere and the only way to attain one is to find someone nice enough to sell it to you or going on ebay and spend half the money you have in your savings account...

I have a friend that has one and he doesn't want it anymore. He wants to sell it to be for 500 bucks. He has everything the premium version had ""the $399 one"" except for the headset, universal remote and ethernet cable. But he also has the play and change kit which didn't come with it.

The only draw back is that i don't have the money right now since i've been spending alot of money to get my car in tip top shape and he doesn't have a warrantly ""execpt for the stupid 90 day warranty from Microsoft"". I'm not too sure if i want to spend 500 bucks on a system and if it decides to crap out on me after 90 days then i'll be SOL. 

He still has the receipt but he bought it from Target and i'm really not sure Target has those lovely 2 year replacement plans that Best Buy has.

Now the good news is that i've recently found out from my Sup at Best Buy that we are expecting a shipment in the middle of December. So now i'm considering just waiting and get it when we recieve it. Surely by then i'll definately have the money to buy it. And since i work their getting games and accessories won't be expensive.

When i do get it the first game i'll probably buy is DOA 4. I have DOA 1, 2, 3 and EX Beach Volleyball on my XBOX already and i definately can't wait for the new one. I also have 2 differnt DOA EX playing cards which are rare items to find. I had to go on ebay to get em and i got them for a really good price too. But they are definately worth it if you're a DOA fan like me.

going to watch some anime now, Ja ne."

Actually the last update i had was suppose to be a 2 part update of things that happened to me in two weeks but because my CPU burned out on me i didn't get a chance to finish it. It was like a week before i got another CPU. The one i got is great but its nothing like my 2.7AMD processor that got toasted. I wasn't complaining though since i got it for free. Its nice when you work at Best Buy and can get things from Geek Squad ^^.

Since my comp was back up i just didn't have the time to finish up what i was talking about. It makes no sense now for me to even bother talking about it since its been so long so i'll just leave it as it is.

There has been alot of things happeneing in my life. I've been going out alot and i hardly ever have time to use my comp so you've rarely ever see me update my journal.


As for the most recent things that have happened. Well, i got a new cell phone and its really kickass. It has a camera with video mode plus it also plays MP3's. Its really cool. 

Um.. i had sex on the beach last night. No not the alcoholic beverage but actual sex on the beach ""smiles"". I say last night but it was more like 3AM in the morning. Anyway i had so much fun and it was even better because Alicia was wearing a mini skirt and for those that knows me know that girls in skirts is one of my ultimate turn on's. 

Three of my sexual fantasies was to have sex on the beach, have sex with a girl while she's wearing a skirt and to have sex in a public area. I did em all last night and it was awesome ^_^.

What was funny is that while we were out there on the beach fooling around, some guy that was jogging by saw us o.o... Yeah, it was a total thrill and thats why i like it.

Another one of my sexual fantasies was to have sex with a cop and i did that like 3 months ago ^_^. Now that is one fantasy that is not easy to fulfill and i did it so i'm really happy about that. Its something that makes you want to brag and tell your friends, lol."

"event","Wow, so many things have happened the past week its amazing. First, lets go back next saturday, not yesterday but last week saturday. Ok so its 6AM in the morning and i'm just comming off from work, i got outside and i saw Ashley and Mike walking towards Mike's car to leave. Ok, both Mike and Ashley work at the same place so they're cowokers. Ashley is new, she only started a week ago and she relies on the bus for transportation to and from work *cringe*. 

The bus system out here sucks so bad but let me not get into that. So anyway, she's new and Mike decides to give her a ride from work since he lives so close to her. I'm not sure if he takes her to work also... 

Now Ashley is what i called a semi goth chick. She dresses halfway like a goth and she really doesn't do what most Goth chicks do. As in go to clubs and raves and get high like a kite and so on.... Actually, i think she used to do all that stuf before but she stopped. But now she isn't really fully goth... if that makes sense. >_<

I never really payed much attention to her but she always kinda stood out to most people dressing the way she does and with the red hair and all.

Ok, now back to what happened. So i walked towards both of them and i started talking to them. We ended up talking for about 5 minutes or so and then Mellissa, Sue and Rosevelt came walking out the building towards us. Then we all started talking and Mellisa and Rose ""everyone calls him Rose for short"" asked me if i wanted to come over for breakfast. Now, i was suppose to be at a store meeting at Best Buy from 7-10am and then i would have to work from 2-11. So i wouldn't have gotten any sleep at all and i was already tired. SO i told them i had something to do and i couldn't make it. 

Ashley was asking Mellisa and Rose why they didn't invite her and they told her that she is more than wellcome to come. Mike was suppose to take her home but he was tired and he didn't want to go for breakfast and Ashley didn't want to ride with Rose because he was always kinda touching on her.... >_<. 

But they eventually convinced her to go. We all left, Ashley with Rose, Mellissa and Sue in the same car and Mike went home while i left to pick up my mom. I called Best Buy and gave them some BS excuse as to why i couldn't make it to work. I really wanted to work but i was so tired and it really was stupid how i had to go to a meeting for 3 hours and then come back and work 9 more hours. I didn't know why my supervisor made the schedule like that so i was kinda pissed also.

So anyway, i wasn't going to work anymore so i called Rose on my cell and told him that i would be ablt to make it afterall. So i went to pick up my mom, drop her home, showered and went to Mellisa's place.

Ashley was there sitting down and it happened to be that every other seat was taken so i had to sit next to her. The entire time i was sitting next to her she was closing in on me and flirting. I was suprised at first but then i decided to do the same. And before i knew it we were there massaging each other and holding hands.... o.o. 

To be continued


Ok, i'm going to bed now, i'll try and finish this up in the morning before i go to work."

Most of my days i'm just working, sleeping and doing things other than stuff i want to do. Lets see, today i came home from work at 6:30Am, yes am. I jumped online and played Halo 2 for a bit because someone was in the bathroom and i wanted to shower. After about 30 minutes of of Halo 2, i went to shower and then i made breakfast. At 7:45am i had to take my mom to some meeting she has at work. I came back and instead of going to sleep i decided to play some more Halo 2 online until about 10:30 knowing i had to go pick her up at 12....

Anyway, my sister woke me up around 12:30..., and i was so freaking tired its like i wanted to faint. I got something to drink from the kitchen and then i left. While driving i was blasting some music to keep me awake and i managed to make it in one piece, got my mom, came home and went right to bed... >_<. 

And now i'm awake again.

I'm not sure what i'm spend the rest of the day doing. Its either watching more Turn A Gundam, catching up on Naruto, reading some more manga or playing Halo 2 online.

I actually wanted to go to the barber today but since i slept most of the day out and the barber is about closed right now, thats pretty much rules that idea out.

Anyway i'm gonna get some food in my belly right now and maybe i'll update in a little bit..."

I spent my entire birthday in pain, that sucks ass...

My Uncle also died the day before my birthday so that made it even worst. I wasn't all that close to him but i was still very much depressed.

Um... oh yeah, i got me a new car ^_^. Its SOOOOOOOOOO much better than my previous car and i love it so much. My sweet Scarlet, lol. Coincidentally its red... Yeah, actually its more like CRIMSON which is even better. 

I thought it was awesome how i found a car that i wanted and it turned out to be my fav color. As for the car itself, its in reallllllllllllly good condition. It just has a few scatches here and there but you can hardly see it. 

oh, Its a 4D 97 Kia Sephia RS. Very nice economic car. I love it and i think its a very nice upgrade over my 94 Ford Tempo GL.....o.o

I left most of my belongings in NY when i moved year so i'm happy i'll get my stuff back.

Tomorrow i'll get the keys for my 3 bedroom apartment and i'll have to make some calls and get the light and phone turned on. I'll probably go with satelite instead of cable though.

I bought a air mattress and i'm going to buy a bed also. I'll be spending some major cash this week buying things for the new place.

I'll be living with my family again for the time being until everyone gets settled. And in ten months or so i'll finally get my OWN place even though this apartment is in my name so technically i do own this apartment ^^.

Also i'm going to buy me a new car... Scarlet is not doing so well so i'll have to upgrade to Scarlet II lol. I'm thinking of getting a sportscar but i still haven't make up my mind yet. 

I'm definately loving the new Mustang though ^^. And of course any car i buy will most likely be in red but i will go with black or platnum if my color is not available...

Video games... I've been buying alot more games than i usually do. Most of them are for XBOX. I own about 10 xbox games right now and i've only had the system for less than 4 months so i think thats pretty decent.

I'm really loving the DOA series right now. I own all of them. DOA 1-3 and Xtreme Beach Volleyball. And for those who haven't played XBV yet then you don't know what your missing. Its a awesome game. Its very fun and interactive. Plus it has hot babes wearing almost nothing. Whatelse can you ask for?

So far the games that i own are...

Halo 2
Top Spin
NCAA 2005
Outrun 2
Dead or Alive Ultimate 1
Dead or Alive Ultimate 2
Dead or Alive 3
Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball.
Mech Assault 2
Blood Wake.

Games thats on my list right now are..

Ninja Gaiden
Conker Live and Reloaded
Halo

and a few more that i can't remember right now but i'm definately loving my XBOX right now and i haven't touch my GC or PS2 in months. 

I'll probably get Jade Empire also. Not because i really want it but because i can get it for 9 bucks ^^. I've yet to pay full price for any of my XBOX games. I would say 99% are free ^^."

"event","Working two jobs sure is tiring. I'm putting in well over 70 hours a week and its just too much for me. I've told my supe at BB to cut some of my hours because i'm already working full time at THD and theres no way i can do 30+ hours at Best Buy and 40+ hourst at The Home Depot.

Even though i have less free time now that i have two jobs, the money is sure looking good ^_^. 


And on another note. We've gotten a new GM at Best Buy and he seems to be pretty cool so far.

He's actually going to replace our 50"" TV that we have in the break room with a brand NEW one ^^. And not just that, we are going to have 2 TV's, one is for watching Satelite* yes we have satelite channels, all the movie chans too ^^* and one for gaming *big grin*.

Yeah.. He's actually going to have a Xbox hooked up to one of the TV's so we can play games whenever. Now thats sweet.

And on april 3rd we are finally going to have our *Lock_In*. Its basically a day when we just kick back and have fun when the store is closed. We'll have food, drinks, music, Karaoke, Games. Yes, we'll be having a Halo 2 tournament.^_^

Its going to be on sunday from 8PM-12AM. It should be alot of fun. Man, i love my job at Best Buy. The job is awesome, the discount is awesome. And you get away with so much shit its unbelievable, lol. No seriously.... 

The things we do at BB you would automatically get fired for at any other job. 

And i can't wait until thursday because thats the launch day for the PSP ^^. I requested to work that day just because i wanted to be there for the launch of the new unit. It should be very exciting even though i'm not going to buy one yet.

And i know my supervisor is going to be down on me to sell alot of D-subs *digital subscription* with the PSP. Plus PRP's *Product Replacement Plan*.

Its easier.. to sell Gamefly than anything else. But when it comes to Napster and Rapsody and even Netflix then its a challege. Itunes pretty much sells itself since everyone wants an IPOD.

Netflix is going to be next to impossible to sell now since Block Buster is doing the same crap and its even cheaper.

I can see myself selling alot of Gamefly with the PSP since the unit is and pretty much all the games are questionable on whats good or bad.

Most of the launch games will be crap of course, and instead of a customer spending 50 beans on something that they might hate, they can just rent it for less than half the price for 2 months. And they can rent as much games as they want in that time. I think thats a awesome deal right there.

I might do the same thing when i get my PSP. But i won't be buying my PSP at Best Buy since i won't be getting any discount on it. I'll probably just trade in a bunch of free games that i got. Like the extra copy of Halo 2 and Mech Assault 2 and get some credit at Gamestop, then use it to buy the PSP.

Yeah, i actually get free XBOX games just for selling games at Best Buy. Thank you Microsoft, i am officially now a XBOX whore.

The main reason why i got a second job is because i want to save more and at the same time have more money to spend on the things i want and need. 

So yeah, i'm now working at Best Buy and The Home Depot. Now i just have to call publix and turn down their job offer ^^'''. 



oh yeah, i finally received my copy of DOA: Xtreme Beach Volleyball in the mail. Haven't played it yet but i'm very eager to *drools*.

Oh, one more thing. I'm also planning on buying one of those portable gaming screen so i can hook up my xbox in my car. The best one i've seen so far is the 7.2"" LCD screen from intec. And it has the biggest screen that i've seen also.

I'll probably get it in a couple weeks or so when i'm generating some major cash now that i have 2 jobs.


Well i'm hungry and i just came from work so i'm just going to use the comp for a little bit more then go home, eat, watch TV, and sleep.

I actually heard the game was quite good and IGN gave it a 9.4 out of 10 so there has to be something good about it other than the fact that it has the DOA girls in skimpy outfits and the game itself puts some major adult movies to shame. ^^''.

But theres another reason why i really need the game. The thing is, to unlock Hitomi""who is a new char in DOA 3"". I need to have save data from either DOA 3 or DOA:XBV. So yeah, in order to fully complete DOA: Ultimate and get all the costumes and every single unlockables in the game. I need one of the other two games so there...

I bet you all thought i wanted to get the game just because i wanted to drool over the sexy DOA girls... *whistles*"

"event","Sunday night me and Cheyne went over to Ronnie's house to hang out. We started up the XBOX and went online to play some Halo 2 ^^. Ok, this was my first time playing multiplayer in H2 so of course i needed time to adjust.

Oh yeah, Ronnie has a 60 inch Plasma TV with stereo surround sound so it was a awesome gaming setup.

The first map that we played was actually from the original Halo so i knew my way around the area and i was kicking serious ass ^^.

Cheyne was talking to his sister on the phone so it was just me, Ronnie and James playing against each other. James was actually at his house logged on to XBOX Live so he wasn't at Ronnie's house.

So anyway, i didn't won the game but i did came in second place. Hey.. i was still rusty in the game, i mean i haven't played a multiplayer FPS game in at least a year now...

The next game Cheyne decided to join in and we played another map. Ok, i got my ass owned in this game because it was a huge as level and i didn't know my way around it so i was getting picked off left and right.

We played a number of other matches after that one. We played team battle, flag matches, sniper matches..etc.

We finished playing around 3am in the morning...o.O. Ronnie had to go to work at 8 am in the morning and he went to his bed reaaaaaly late... 

Cheyne wanted to stay up longer and watch a movie. I was going back and forth watching Ronnie's roomate playing RE 4 in his room, and he actually finished the game that same morning. And after seeing the things in that game, i want to get it even more than ever. Its nothing like you've ever seen. RE 4 in an awesome game.

So anyway, i stayed up with Cheyne and watched Black Hawk Down even though i've seen the movie already. The movie ened around 5 am and i was tired as hell.

I went to the bathroom to take a wiz and was getting ready to leave. Cheyne said he was sleeping over and he was asking me if i wanted to stay but i told him i'm hungry and i wanted to go home, shower, eat and go to bed.

I left and drove home, shower, ate dinner and went to bed.

My aunt woke me up at 11am in the morning saying i have a phone call. Turns out it was Best Buy calling me asking me if i want to work today because someone didn't show up.... I said yes only because i wanted more money ^^. Yes, i love money ^_^

Going to work kinda ruin my plans for the day because i was suppose to go to Jason's house and play DOA Ultimate and Halo 2. I called him and left him and message saying i couldn't make it, and went to work.

At work at asked Justin who didn't show up and he told me it was Ronnie....>_<. Turns out that he was too tired to make it but he made up some bullship excuse saying his leg was hurting him....

Thats what happen when you go to bed at 2am in the morning when you have to work at 8am....

I was actually glad i went to work because we had stategy guides on sale that they. How much were they? Well you won't believe it when i tell you but i'll say it anyway. They were on sale for 1 Cent!. Yes, 1 Cent, one penny. I didn't believe it until i checked myself.

It wasn't all strategy gudies but some of them. The one's i remember are Madden 2005, The Incredibles, Pikmin 2, and Dead or Alive Ultimate. I have DOA Ultimate so guess which one i bought ^^.

Talk about a sweet deal. That has to be the cheaptest thing i ever bought, lol. 

So yeah, i had a fun night. Later this week all of us might be hanging out again. Ronnie wants me to check out some strip club with him, Justin and Beth. Yeah.. Beth's a girl... 

why does she wants to go to a strip club you say? Well... she's bisexual. Something i recently found out ^^. And she has a boyfriend and she's married.... >_<. I feel so sorry for Justin who is the boyfriend."

I spent about 600 bucks over the holidays and my wallet is feeling kinda light... >_<. I bought gifts for everyone and sent it back to NY.And not only did i sent gifts.. but i sent money also.

Christmas day i went over to my friends house for a bit and hang out with him and his sisters. Jason was playing DOA 3 and i was just watching since he only has one XBOX controller....-_-. We just talked for a bit and he showed me all gifts he got.

His mom actually bought him a playboy callender... wtf o.O??. Anyway..., they wanted me to stay longer so i did. I stayed and watched I, ROBOT with them even though i have the DVD and i've already seen the movie. 

Jason's sisters kept on questioning me about everything. It was the first time they were meeting me since they live on their own. But i think that the older sister liked me *forgot her name....* 

So they wanted me to stay and eat a little before i left but i said i couldn't because i wouldn't feel too hungry when i went back to eat at my house. So after the movie i left and went back home to eat.

After dinner we ate dessert and watched the Bourne Supremacy. Alot more happened but its just too much to type.

Oh yeah, my uncle had came to visit for christmas ^^."

Also Kelly seems to be mad at me for something i said a couple days ago.  Basically what happened was that i had some cut on my lip and when everyone at work asked me what happened i told them that i kissed Kelly and she punched me and bust my lip...*lol*. Ok, i thought it was funny and i was obviously joking.

Some of them actually thought i was serious and they went to ask her. At the end of the day when i was leaving she said *You are such a liar* But she said it with a huge ass smile on her face so i thought she got a little humor out of it.

Anyway, yesterday*when i say yeserday i mean like 2 hours ago* when i was leaving i stopped and try to talk to her. She said that she doesn't want to talk to me at the moment because of what i did. I was a little suprised because i never thought she would get angry at something like that.

I told her i was just joking around and that its not a big deal but she still seemed pissed. She kinda walked away from me and i just left because i just didn't feel like running her down and beg for her forgiveness....

I don't know why i'm starting to like her so much. At first the only thing i use to notice was her big boobs but now i'm starting to really falling for her. Theres just something about her that draws my attention and its hard for me not to look at her.


damn, look at the time...

"event","Today i went shopping with Brandy. Who is Branday? Well... she's a co-worker. I'm really just interested in her sister Kelly and i'm kinda trying to get at Kelly through her. So basically i'm using her... Or was anyway.

This morning i woke up and i felt kinda guilty for going out with her just so i can hook up with her sister. Today she was suppose to come over and we were going to watch some movies and hang out. My cousin wanted to have sex with her of course and i wasn't too happy with that because i just don't want to hurt her feelings in any way.

Basically, if she wants to have sex with me then so be it. But i don't want to force it on her. I just don't feel right doing that.

So anyway, today we walked around doing some christmas shopping and i learned more about her, and more about Kelly. Apparantly, Kelly is a little bit immature than i thought she was. She usually just goes out and do whatever she wants. And she actually loned out her mom car to a friend. Of course she got into trouble for it and from what her sister told me, she can't go anywhere for 2 weeks... exept work of course.

So.. after me and Brandy went shopping we talked for a bit and she told me that she's a bit tired and that she also as things at home to do so she couldn't come over my place today. That was ok though and i'm kinda glad because she's a really nice girl and i really want to get to know her a little bit more. And at the same time i want her to get to know me more also, so that way she wouldn't feel too uncomfortable when she does come over.

I told her that its ok if she can't come over and that maybe we'll do it some other time. She agreed and said that she will check her schedule to make sure that when we do decide on a date to hang out, she won't have anything planned or she won't be too tired from work.

Now, the weird thing is that i'm starting to have a little interest in Brandy. First i was just using her to get at her sister and now i think i'm interested in them both >_<. 

And for them being sisters, they are totally opposite. Kelly has a killer body and she's very hot. Brandy is a bit bigger than Kelly, she's more mature, she's 21 and Kelly is 18.

Also they both love video games, movies, and....*drumroll* ANIME. Yes, anime. So i actually got some things in common with them.

But yea.. they look nothing alike. I was suprised when i found out that they were sisters...."

"event","Wednesday i went to the movies after work to see Blade Trinity and it wasn't as good as i expected it to be. There was more talking and jokes than action and some of the lines were really corny. 

Compared to the first two blade movies i honestly think that this one was the worst. And don't even get me started on Dracula.. or *Drake* which is what they call him. First of all, the person they got to play the part of Dracula was some pretty boy that doesn't even fit the role. 

And Dracula didn't really seem that evil. He was all about fighting with honor and all that crap. I was like *wtf is he talking about?*. He's suppose to be pure evil and he should be going on a killing spree.

Anyway, the way Dracula died at the end almost made me vomit. It was way to easy, its like Blade was fighting a 13 year old school girl compared to the guys he fought in the first two movies.

I'm really dissapointed in how the movie turned out and i had really high hopes for it. I thought it would be the best movie this chirstmas holiday but the way it turned out i wouldn't be suprised if the Incredibles made more money than it.


Anyway i better get going because i need to visit my uncle at the hospital. He had some breathing problem so he had to get surgery."

"event","Am i the only one that has eyes to notice the lack of games the DS has launched with? It couldn't be more than 7 games and not one of them has my interest. The only game that i might play is Mario 64 DS but then again i've already played the damn thing on the N64 over and over again already.

Couldn't they at least create a new Mario game and release it instead of porting something from the N64? Are they that lazy...

How can Nintendo launch a brand new system with games like this? Do they want to stay in the video game business or what? I mean this is ridiculous and these guys are starting to piss me off ever more. 

The DS has some really cool features and i think its capable of doing so many things. The touch-screen feature is just awesome and its definately something original and unique in video games.

I'll just wait until some decent games are released for the DS before i even bother to get it. I'll most likely get the PSP before the DS if its below 200 bucks. But if Sony decides to price it at $250 or even $300 then they can kiss my ass because i aint paying that much for a handless system even if it was forged by the mighty zeus himself.

The only way i'll pay that much for the PSP is if Morgan Webb from X Play came to my house and presented it and threw herself at me *lol*. 

Oh Morgan...*Drools*

Now the store opens at 6am for the big sale so i had to get there two hours early to help put some things out and fix up the place a bit. I had a whole cart full of GBA SPs to put out and a bunch of PS2 games.

We had to drink some red bull to keep up our energy because we all knew it was going to be a very long day.

I was mostly in the DVD area and i had hords of customers comming up to me. By the end of the day all XBOX's were sold out, all GBA's were pretty much sold out, all PS2's were sold out, all Nintendo DS's were sold out, and a ton of the GC's were sold also.

alot happened yesterday and even though i would love to talk about it some more, i got to get to work in like the next 10 minutes.. Yup, another 12 hour work day for me."

I got her number and i'm trying to find a day when we're both free so we hang out and play games and watch movies and whatever..

Now a day after that, i accidentally locked my keys in my car...-_-. I had a spare key but it was home and i was at my cousins house which is like a 30 minute drive away. It was at night time and i had to be at work for a meeting the next day at 6am in the morning. Fortunately my cousin lives like 2 minutes away from where i work and he was going to give me a ride.

So i came back from work and he was trying some method of getting the car door open. He went to pep boys to get something from his car and i started trying also. After an hour i gave up and went to watch a DVD.

Fortunately again we had to go to my house and have sunday dinner. So once we arrived and grabbed my spare key and put it in my wallet.

Tuesday night i was comming back home to bring back a movie i rented at blockbuster. It was due that day and i didn't want to pay any late fee. O yeah, the DVD i rented was Dawn of the Dead and i'm glad i rented it because it wasn't that good...>_>

So on my way back, i decided to stop at Mcdonalds and get something to eat. I left and started eating in my car.. while driving. After awhile i started to think that maybe i shouldn't be eating and driving while on the highway and then all of a sudden i ran right into the back of a car...-_-.

It wasn't a very hard hit and it was a SUV that had a spare tire on the back of it. So basically all i hit was the spare tire and there was no damage at all to the car ^^. So yeah i pulled over to the side of the road and the person i hit came out and was inspecting his car. I was looking to see if there was any damage but i didn't see any and he didn't either.

He asked me what type of insurance i have and before i got a chance to answer he told me that he would forget everything that happened and walk away if i pay him some money... o.O. I told him i had only 20 bucks on me and he said that was fine since there wasn't any damage to his car. He said the only thing that might be damaged is the spare tire. Besides i believe his car is dent resistant or something.

So i gave him 20 bucks and shook his hand and then we pulled off. OK, this was my first car accident and even though it sucks to have any accident at all, i think i got off pretty damn easy. I mean it could have been alot worst than that. Worst comes to worst i could have completly damaged the guys car or even killed someone. Thankfully no one got hurt and i only left the scene with minor damages to my car.

But i'm really glad it wasn't worst than that. And that the guy was cool enough not to get the insurance companies involved ^^.


Now just a couple days ago i went to Best Buy with my cousin and he went to bring back some graphics card he had bought for his computer. He then bought a CD and we walked around a bit and we were getting ready to leave. While he was paying for the CD he bought i was standing next to this girl waiting for him.

She was dressed in normal clothes so i thought she was a customer but she actually worked there. She then stood up and said that if i remember her from last week. I was a bit suprised because i didn't remember her and she remembered me and she was very pretty. So after she mentioned the movie that i was trying to find  for her, thats when i remembered her.


See, the story is that she and her friend came in like a week ago and they were looking for a certain DVD. I went to find the movie for them and then she said that she was going to start working here soon. I told her that i'm glad and that i'll talk to her later. *i was busy so i couldn't really talk to her much*

So back to that night. She was mad that i didn't remember her and i was trying to make up excuses of how her hair style looks different and all of that. 

We talked for awhile and i can tell that she was really into me. I told her that i'll never ever forget her again and that i'll make a special trip just to see her. She was happy to hear that and since we didn't really know each other. I got her name and i introduced myself and my cousin.

The store was getting ready to close so we had to go and she said it was ok. I told her that i'll talk to her later. And like i said earlier, she is very pretty and i just have to hook up with her. *grins evily*


So after all those bad days i had this week, something good came out of it. ^^.

Now off i go to finish playing Jak and Daxter since i'm so close to finishing the game."

"event","I want to buy a XBOX system by next week and i'm contemplating wheather i should buy a used one in gamestop or try and find one or ebay or something.

I really don't want to shell out 150 bucks for a new system so thats why i'm trying to get a used one or someone willing to sell a new system for cheap.

Its not like i don't have the money to get a new system but i want to save as much of my money as i can. Hey, i'm a responsible adult now so i can't just spend alot of cheese unwisely. If i can save some money then i'll go with an alternate method.

So anyone out there knows where i can find a xbox for the cheap? ^^'''
or should i just stick with gamestop?

If i really can't find the system online then i'll have to go with what i initialy planned and trade in some old games and DVD's and buy one at gamestop."

"event","Seeing this announcement was a shocker. I can't believe that all exclusive Nintendo games are going to the PS2. Even though i'm a Nintendo fan, i'm starting to lose all hope in them and just focus on Sony and Microsoft.

Why buy games for a video game system if the game isn't even exclusive? Capcom had said that a number of games were suppose to be exclusive to Nintendo and yet they've went back on their word. We've seen it with Viewtiful Joe and the up comming Killer 7, and now its going to happen to Resident evil 4. 

I think its now obvious that Nintendo are the only one's making exclusive games for their system and other developers wants to expand to multi system because they want their games to sell more. And seeing as how they're more PS2 owners than NGC owners, i can fully understand the reasoning of why Capcom wants to bring RE4 to PS2 even though it kinda hurts as a GC fan. 

But hey, Capcom is in the business to make money so they'll do whats best for them. And as for me, i'll still continue to support Nintendo but they're not doing anything special for me to keep them as my favourite.

Right now i'm planning on selling my GBA because i really have no use for it right now and i can use to money to buy a XboX or something. 

Nintendo has really fucked up and its going to cost them. I'll be buying more PS2 and XBOX games since thats where all the great games are. And Nintendo will have to do something damn great with their next system to get me to buy it.

I've always been loyal to Nintendo since i owned the very first system, but now i think i might be jumping on the Sony bandwagon. Sorry Nintendo but my hard earned money has to go to a system with EXCLUSIVE video games. Or at least games that i want to play.

The only way Nintendo will ever get my devotion back is for them to outsell the PS3 with their next system. And from the direction they're going right now, i hardly think thats going to happen.

So far the only nintendo game that i really want that is exlusive is Metroid Prime 2. RE4 was one of them but now its not exclusive and i wouldn't be suprised to see RE4 being released on PS2 with more features and it will most likely sell better too....

I've already made plans on buying a XBOX and i have a bunch of games that i want to buy that has online gameplay too.... I'll probably own more XBOX games in 2 months than GC games and i've had my GC since it first came out. That only shows you how much mature games Nintendo are comming out with -_-.

So by nov 9th i'll most likely own a XBOX and thats the same day Halo 2 is comming out which is the most anticipating game in years. 

Heck, i might even sell a couple GC games since i'm not really playing them anymore..-_-. I somehow feel cheated buying the GC for 200 beans when i'm finding all the games i want to play on other video games systems. -_-

Well thats that. I'll probably be heading to Gamestop sometime this week and trade in my GBA and some other things and use the credit to help buy me a xbox. I might as well do that and save me some money."

"event","GTA San Andreas came out tuesday and it was selling like hotcakes. I had tons of people calling in asking if we had it, how much we had, what time we're closing and all the like. I had a cordless phone with me and it was ringing like crazy the entire day. 

The game was almost sold out in one day and i wanted to get a copy myself so bad but i had to restrain myself.

I have a ton of things i'm already paying for and other things to buy so GTA will have to be put on the wait list no matter how badly i want to play it. Just yesterday i bought R.O.D TV v3 and i still need to buy Evangelion Platinum v2 plus i need to pick up the newly released GTO vol 21 and i also have Halo 2, Metroid Prime 2, and DOA Ultimate on my list for the comming months.... Not to mention i have to use money for gas, car insurance, and my cell phone. 

 So far i know Ryan has bought the game so i'll probably go hang out with him one of these days and play it. He's been telling me so much about it at work and i'm so jelous right now. 

Ronnie also said he's going to get it and he has a  50 inch widescreen so it would be really fun to play it on that. 

But for those who hasn't played GTA yet, you're all missing out. its a great game. I've played GTA 3 and Vice City and San Andreas will be bigger than both games. Seriously!. it will probably take more time to complete one city in San Andreas than it took to complete all of Vice City. The game is huge.


Well thats pretty much all i have to say about that. And curse you all thats playing the game right now >_<."

I know SEED of Chucky is comming out later this month or next month and i definately want to see it. And for those who don't know, its the sequel to Bride of Chucky *lol*. Yeah, after all these years i didn't think they were going to make a sequel to that movie.

And i'm still wondering how the hell does two dolls have intercourse and produce a child? o.O. I know its a movie but it makes no sense. The dolls have life in them but they shouldn't have sexual organs or anything like that.

O well, i guess i'm the only one that's thinking so much into it..."

"event","The days seems to be going so quickly and i can hardly ever find the time to get things done. I've been living in FL for about 4 months now and i still haven't opened up a bank account. I was suppose to get it done a few days ago but things just keep comming up and getting in the way.

Just yesterday i spent pretty much the entire day just cleaning my car and before i knew it night had came...

Also, even though things are going really great for me, i'm still getting a little depressed at times mainly because i really don't know much people here and i can hardly keep in contact with my friends in NY and other online friends.

And it seems i've lost contact with some of my online friends because i've not been on the net as i use to. I can't even remember the last time i chat online in realtime...

As much as i love to be offline and do other fun things in life, i'm still missing out on alot of things by not being online more frequently and its like i'm starting to totally forget the internet.

I'm not as up to date on things as i use to be and its just hard to keep up with technology when your offline most of the time.

Right now i really have to forget about my computer back in NY because theres really no place to put it even if i had it so thats why i've been planning on getting a laptop because its mobile and won't really be a problem to get around.

Getting a laptop right now would be easy but that means i would have to shell out a good sum of money which i don't want to do right now. I use to spend money carelessy in the past on things i REALLY don't need but i've stop doing that because i'm not rich or wealthy. 

And i'll have to find a place for myself soon so i have to save most of the money i make. 

I'm hoping things will progess faster and that things will continue to get better for me. 

And i also know that some of my friends are having a tough time and i wish them all the best."

"event","Yesterday i went to the mall to buy a few things. I went into JCPenny and i was trying on a couple pants in the dressing room and i had my keys around my neck. I left the dressing room and payed for the pants i wanted and then i went to Waldenbooks to buy a couple manga.

I was in there for about 30 mintues and i finally got what i wanted ""Battle Royale vole 5-6 ^^"" and then i was getting ready to leave. I ran into a friend who i just always seem to run into for some reason...o_o, and we started chatting a bit. He went into a cellphone store and then i left the mall and was heading to my car.

I felt around my neck and my keys weren't there so i checked my pockets and then the bags but i didn't have it on me so i was really starting to get worried. The first place i checked was the bookstore but i didn't see them so i went back to JCPenny and checked the dressing room i was in. It turns out that someone had came in the room and cleaned it out so i went to one of the employee's and asked her if the store has a lost and found and she said ""no, not really..."".

She asked me what i lost and i told her it was my keys and she called up someplace and asked them if they found a key in the dressing room and they said  yes. I had a huge ass smile on my face. I went to some desk and they gave it to me and i was like super happy because if i had lost my keys then i would have been really screwed considering that i had my house keys and everything else on it plus i had my cell phone in my car >_<'''.

I do have a spare key for my car but i keep it at home of course and it would have been hell just to get home, get it, and get my ass back at the mall.

I'm just glad that no one else had found my keys because my car was right next to where JCPenny was and someone could have easily stole it."

Its a 94 Ford Tempo GL. It was in a very good condition and it has 4 doors, power windows, power seats,ice cold AC and to make it even better, it was favourite color ^^. 

I payed down on it thursday then i went to get my insurance and then the next day i payed the rest of the money.

I took it to the carwash and got it all cleaned up and i vacuumed the inside. Sunday i waxed it and shine down the rimms and i cleaned up the dashboared a bit.

Even though its not my ideal car,it sure beats walking or riding a bicycle ^^. Besides it runs quite well and now i can go whereever i want without depending on other people. 

Tomorrow i have the day off from work so i'll clean it up some more and work on one of the door windows. 

It sure feels good when you're cruzing in the wind in your own car ^_^"

"event","Today was quite the day... First of all, i was suppose to be off from work today and i had planned on doing a number of things. I was at my cousins place and when i went home i got a message from my work place.

The person that called didn't leave a message so now i was wondering what the heck they were calling me for. I picked up the phone and called them and found out that good old Ronnie didn't show up for work and they really really needed someone to help. And guess who that someone was? Bingo!, that someone was me. I agreed to come in because i wanted to get some extra hours and extra hours = more cheddar ^^.

It was about 3PM and i dumped all my clothes in the washer so i had nothing to wear. I was able to finished washing my clothes but i didn't have enough time to full dry what i wanted to wear so i just wore my pants half wet/dry...<_<. 

So i reached work about 6 and i went directly to my department. I saw Elizabeth and i was talking to her. I told her that i stayed up late last night watching American Pie 2 and then she said she is going to stay up late tonight doing something. So i asked her what she's going to do and she said she is giong to invite some friends over because she's going to be bored. 

I asked her if she lived alone and she said no, she lives with her HUSBAND * -_-* but he is out of town. And i was like *huh?* and she repeated herself...

When she said that i didn't know what else to say. I really didn't think that she could have been married. I mean the girl is a 20 year old that looks like she's 15 for christ sake >_<. I guess her small size blinded me from noticing her damn ring...

So, now that i know she's married, do i stand a chance of actually hooking up with her? hmmm... i don't know but i think she is doing things behind her husbands back and if i was in my right mind i would have found out more about the little get together she was having tonight.

I'm really hungry right now and i'm about to leave in the next 10 minutes and go eat then i'll head straight to work.

Unfortunately i'll be working the late shift today...>_< and the sucky part is that i'll be working until close this entire week -_-. 

After work today i'll go to my cousins house and finally be able to watch Kill Bill 2 ^^. He's had that DVD so long now and i never got the chance to watch it because his sister had it for the longest freaking time!..

oh yeah, i forgot to mention that i actually got some award at work yesterday for doing a good job in my department. *well, everyone in my department got one*. I was actually suprised since i just started working at this place a few weeks ago but i'm happy because thats the first time i'm every being recognized for what i do at my job and its about damn time ^^.

also theres a few girls at work i'm interested in and all of them are suprising blonds o.o. Actually, theres a cute blond girl sitting next to me right now but she looks very young and if she see's me typing this i might get the o'l evil eye ^^'''.

damn, theres so much i want to say but i never have the time. Also i still don't have my damn car yet. Wednesday and Thursday i don't work so i have to get a car before thursday.

"event","Well, I know that I have not written in forevor.  So is it any surprise that when I finally do write about something, that it is to complain about work again?  Well, the manager, Miranda, nice though she may be, is one of the laziest managers in the world.  She is always calling off, always calling in sick.  And always leaving freaking early.  Now Patty left early a couple times recently, on days when she would have been back helping me.  But she had a good reason, her husband had surgery recently, and there had been complications, so she had to go and take care of him.  That is a reasonable reason.  But Miranda never has a reasonable reason.  Not to mention when she is back there working, she is always going off to bakery, produce, or up front to check out.  She is always screwing up orders, including once when there was a 200 pc chicken order.  Then there is Amanda, who is starting to get as bad as Miranda.  In some ways she is worse.  Always going off to talk to people she knows when she is supposed to be working.  And she has a habit of going off to bakery at times as well.  The only two worth working with are Patty and Deb.  Shane is not to terrible, at least he sticks around and helps out.  He is only someone who helps out occasionally though when someone is on vacation.  Then considering I have to walk pretty much all of the time, and if I have not said it before, it takes Me an hour to walk back and forth from work, I am pretty tired most of the time.  

I need a new job.  I will try to keep up with this better, and hopefully I will have some beter things to talk about soon.  Sorry to be so gloomy everyone."

"event","This is really starting to suck ya know.  Having a constant ringing sound in your ears is not very much fun, let Me tell you.  Especially as it is impairing My hearing.  And considering I need to hear the customers to hear what they want at work, that just makes it all the worse.  I suppose I should go and get it checked out.  It's just that it is gonna hurt Me financially.  I do not make a whole hell of a lot of money, and doctor's bills are never cheap.  Still, this ringing has been going on now for a out a week.  So I should probably go and get it checked out sometime soon.  At least it is not getting any worse.  *sighs*  On good news, I finally did get to talk to My girlfriend.  Turns out she had a seriously bad migraine and had to go to the ER for it.  I feel really bad for her.  I want her to get online tonight so I can talk to her, cuz I really miss her, but I do not want her head to hurt worse for looking at the screen.  *sighs*  Life just sucks right now."

So that kinda put a damper on things.  But the thing that really makes this one really bad birthdays, is the fact that I have not gotten to talk to My girlfriend all day.  I do not know what is wrong with her, but there must be something if she has not been able to contact Me, for I know that she would do everything she could to talk to Me today.  I just hope that she is okay, I am really worried about her."

"event","I have had a hard time giving Kit punishments for infractions of certain rules that I have given to her.  Believe it or not this actually bothered her, and I understand why.  For how can she grow if I am not giving her guidance.  And that is what punishments are, they are guidance to help her to grow into the submissive that I need her to be.  So I do know where she is coming from.  Well, that changed tonight.  She has a problem with being open whenever there is something on her mind that is bothering her.  Often she will clam up rather than talk about it with Me.  This bothers Me.  So tonight, I have given her her first punishment.  Well, I do not know if it is so much a punishment, rather than an assignment.  I gave her an essay to write, on why she clams up like this, why it is not a good idea to do so, and ways that she might get better at not doing it.  I think it will be a good way for her to study this problem more clearly, and hopefully get a better handle on it, and open up to Me more."

"event","It has been very hard on Me with Kit working now.  We have so precious little time to talk these days, and then something happens like tonight.  We had more time than usual cuz I had off today.  So once she got off work I was looking forward to a long night together.  But no, of course not.  Just My kind of luck her internet goes out and she is unable to get back on tonight.  So that is time lost, and to Me, any time lost with her is agonizing.  *sighs*  I did not think it was going to be this hard on Me.  With her working now and Me mostly getting closing days, we do not get to spend a whole lot of time together.  And the time we do get to spend together gets ruined like this.  The distance between us has been harder to bear lately.  The physical distance that is.  It is so very hard not to be able to touch her, to see her smile in person.  I know it is just as hard on her to.  Especially on nights like this.  Somedays I do not know where I find the strength to keep going on, but then I think of her, knowing that she loves Me somehow gives Me the strength.  I just hope that we are able to see each other soon.  I so very badly need to be able to touch her, to know that she is real, that I did not just dream her up.  She is so very perfect for Me I could almost believe that she was just someone that My mind dreamed up for Me."

"event","You get to see a lot of different people when you work in customer service of any kind.  The same goes for working in a deli.  Many different kinds of people with many different pecularities about how they want their food served.  I thought I would just take the time to talk about some of them.

First we have the alumininum foil guy.  This guy, a elderly black fellow in one of them powered grocery chairs, demands that we wrap up his chicken in aluminum foil.  The bags that we normally use, though quite sturdy, are not good enough for him.  And of course it has to be double wrapped.  If he even suspects that we  did not double wrap it he will demand that we go back and do it again.  Which can be quite annoying.  He is the only person that wants his chicken that way.  

Next is the guy that Patti calls, 'The First Slice Guy'.  Now this guy is seriously picky.  He refuses to take the first slice off of any loaf of meat or cheese.  And I do not think that there is any other customer we have that is as picky as he is about the thickness of the way he wants his meat cut.  Fortunetly for Myself though, I do not have to deal with him anymore.  Cuz the very first time I served him, when I was still new, I think I gave him to much or to little.  It seemed to really irk him, and he stalked away muttering something under his breath, and did not order anything else, though I knew that he wanted to.  Now everytime he sees Me working in the deli, he just turns and walks away.  Ahh well.  *chuckles*

There was this really old woman the other day who came in, and I am talking like she had to be in her 50s.  Anyway, she was dressed reallll trampy.  Her top was barely more than a bra and she was practically falling out of it, which was something that was rather hard not to notice.  Her shorts were ridiculously short either.  *shivers*  And I do not mean to sound crude or mean or anything, but she did not have the body for this sort of outfit.  Yikes.

There was this one guy who came walking into the store one night with this big ass lizard sitting on his shoulder.  I did not even know he was allowed to bring something like that into the store.  It had a collar and a leash on it.  It was just sitting there calmly, looking aorund.  It was pretty cool looking.  I am thinking that it was an iguana.

Then there is the smiley lady, who always has this goofy smile on her face, and always asks for what she wants in the exact same way and in the exact same tone of voice.  I like her though, she's nice.

Those are a few of the more odder ones.  Hope that I did not bore ya.   hehe"

"event","Yeah yeah, I do not wanna hear it, I know all to well that I have been horrible at keeping up with this.  It is the old excuse, not thinking that I have anything interesting to write about.  Well, guess what the topic of this one is gonna be?  Yes, that's right, it's gonna be about something completely, entierly, 100% new.  I am gonna complain about work.  Oh wait, that is nothing new huh?  Ahh well, it is My journal and I am gonna write about what I wanna write about, and I wanna complain about work.  :P

This is going to be a really rough week at work.  First of all, Deb, our harders and best worker, is on vacation, so it is left up to Amanda and Patty to do all the opening, and unless they help each other in the mornings, they are gonna have a really rought time of it, because Miranda has been worthless lately.  I swear for a Deli manager, she works everywhere but in the deli it seems.  One day she was in the bakery all day decorating cakes.  And the next day Patty, the assistant manager, had to work through three weeks worth of bills cuz Miranda had let them go that long, and she could have been doing it the day before instead of screwing around with cakes, that is the bakery's job.  Other days she can be found back in produce, or up at the front end with the cashiers.  I am sorry, but they all have their own people working for them, but she decides she needs to go up there despite the fact that she is needed at the deli.  Anyway, where was I?  Oh yeah, Deb.  It is gonna be hell this week without her.  

Another thing, the freaking people who are managing that store, and writing up the schedules, need to make up their freaking minds.  Two weeks ago we closed at 9:30, last week it was 10, and now this week it is 10:30.  They really need to keep it at one freaking time already, it is getting ridiculous how many times they have changed it around.  I guess this week it is because of some program that our store is sponsering, and we are sponsering it with...what else but deli foods!  Of all the friggen kinds of food that the store could donate it just has to be the deli foods.  

And then of course I get the pleasure of closing the deli 5 times this week, yay Me.  I have 40 hours, but of course, only one night off, which just friggin sucks.  I hate only having one night off for a week.  I like to have two, no more, no less.  *shakes head*  

Okay, rant is over, you may now return to your own regularly scheduled bitching.  lol"

She is making decent money and the job is something I know that she is going to really enjoy.  And I could not be more proud for her and happy for her.  The only thing is the job is 9 in the morning to 5 at night, which is really gonna cut into our time spent together.  This is gonna make things hard on the both of us, but she has My fullest support.  I am likely going to miss her like crazy, but....this is for the better for it might help us get together all the sooner.  She is worried that the time apart will start to change things for us, that we might start to grow apart.  Well, I will be said and I will miss the amount of time that we spend together, but I understand why she both needs and wants to do this.  And personally I do not think that we will grow apart.  My love for her is the strongest thing that I have ever felt before in My life."

Yummy.  Then at Wal-Mart I finally got myself a fan.  And it even has a remote control.  That is so cool.  When we got home we had a little birthday gathering for her.  Everyone was in a happy mood for a change.  Then me and Mikey went out to throw the ball around, so I got in a bit of exercise to.  Well, it was sort of productive.  Anyway it has been a good day.  I just wish that the damned mail went on memorial day so more of my books would come.  Oh well.   Oh yeah, did I forget to mention that I have started to use Amazon.com?  I know I said before, at least I think I did somewhere, that I would rather go to the bookstore to buy them there myself, but let's face it, my trips out to Barnes and Nobles are few and far between.  So I finally broke down and started ordering online.  At least there I can get used books for a good price that are still in good condition.  But I have more books now, so I am a happy camper there.

In other news, my girlfriend had decided to quit smoking.  As her Dom I was having her cut back with the eventual goal of quitting in the future, but she decided to just go right ahead and stop cold turkey.  I am very proud of her for that.  I know she is gonna be difficult for a while, but I am a patient man and will give her all the comfort and support that I am able to give.  What is it about quitting this nasty habit that makes people bitchy?  I know the cravings must be bad and all, but when I have had cravings for caffeine I never got bitchy about it.  I guess cuz nicotine is a lot stronger that is why.  Or maybe I am just a much more mellow person then most.  *shrugs*"

"event","Okay, I am starting to have doubts that it was my uncle Scott who hid my computer.  He came back here and we argued about it and he swore on my dad's grave, his brother, that he did not do it.  And though he is still a suspect as far as I am concerned, I am starting to have doubts that he did it.  

Which means that I am getting seriously paranoid about things here.  If it was not him then it was Mikey, and I thought that I was on good terms with him.  It was not Robyne, she was at work, and definetly not Haley or my Gram.  I really do not think that it was my uncle Mike.  So really the only to suspects are Mikey and Scott.  

I am so sick to death of all this crap.  I so need to get out of here, get my own place.  But my job is not good enough for that.  I desperately need a new job.  A good paying one.  There is this customer who comes into the deli every now and then, who is starting a new job.  One that pays 10 something an hour to start.  He thinks that he would be able to get me in there actually.  The thing is it is reallly hard work out there, I am not sure if I am tough enough to do it.  I guess that I am going to find out though, if he can get me in there I am going to go for it.  It is finally time to find out just what I am capable of."

Last night I get home and I find my computer is missing from my room.  I look all over the house for the danged thing, unable to find it.  I am going nuts here, wondering if Haley got a hold of it and dragged it off somewhere and damaged it.  No, that is not what happened.  Mikey came out and mentioned to me that he saw my uncle scott going outside a few times, so he suggested that I look in the shed.  So I go out and look in the shed.  Wonder of wonders, I find my laptop out there.  Now this is just fucking ridiculous.  How childish can the man be?  Cuz I know it was Scott, he is the only one in this house who is childish enough to do it.  

Apparently, he thinks I get online to much.  Which is not true, and even if I did, it is none of his freaking business how much I get online.  I am sorry, but if someone has a problem with me, they need to come and talk to me about it face to face.  This kind of shit is just old, and I am sick of it.  I can tell you one thing, if I had not gotten it back, I would have had the cops involved this time.  Cuz I cannot even begin to count how much money I have lost just because of this kind of shit."

"event","I love my grandmother.  More than anyone else in my life she has been like a mother to me.  I remember when my father died, my stepmother at the time took off the day after his funeral, going out of town and partying, leaving me, my brother and sister alone for a day and a half, without ever telling us where she was going.  When my Gram heard about this, she got in such a rightous anger that she came down and picked us up, and took us up to her house.  There had not been any food or anything in the house when my stepmother did that.  And I stayed up here to.  She took me in, gave me a place to stay, built an extra room on the house for me, fed me, and all of that stuff.  She has done so very much for me, to much in my personal opinion.  But my Grandmother does not know the meaning of the word selfish.  She is one of the most giving people I know, as well as one of the most soft hearted.  Watch out when she gets mad though, it is a scary site to behold.  I love this woman to death, and she deserves a lot more than the cake and the card that I got her for Mother's Day.  But even with that, I got a, ""Awww, now why did you go and do that for?"", before I got a ""Thank you"".    :)"

"event","Okay, there is something that I just have to ask here.  I spend a lot of time online with my girlfriend Kit.  An awful lot of time.  Somewhat to the exclusion of some of my other online friends.  Now, one of those friends, Amber, seems to be taking exception to this.  She seems to think that I am treating her differently because I do not talk to her as much as I used to.  She is really, truly upset about it.  *sighs*  I tried to tell her that I still care very much about her, that I still very much value her friendship, but she just does not seem to believe me.  

I wonder sometimes if it has anything to do with the mutual attraction that we once felt for one another.  I no longer do that with her anymore, and do not flirt with her like I once did.  It could be that she is upset about that, but if so, then she needs to get over it.

Heather, I am going to use you as an example here if you do not mind.  When you and Dave first met, and first started dating, it was long distance to.  Granted not as long a distance as me and Kit, but still pretty long.  At that time you stopped getting online as much to talk.  Now, at first I will admit I was just a little jealous.  But I knew that he was making you happy, and so I was happy for you, and did not begrudge you that.  :)

I have not even stopped talking to her completely, but she still thinks I am treating her differently.  Am I doing something wrong here?  Because I do not think that I am."

I am glad for her though, she does not get to get out much.  And I guess I can understand Mike being in a bad mood and not feeling like going anywhere.  He did work about 12 hours yesterday, and I certainly know what that feels like.  So if I have to walk, I have to walk.

She also mentioned something about Deb and Patty getting a night of closing each week.  Ha!  I will believe that one when I see it.  I do not much think it will.  They pretty much have a lock on the daytime shifts.  Which really sucks, I guess that is seniority for ya.  I need a new job.  I am going to put an application in at Wal-Mart.

Nor do they play out any role plays of fathers and daughters.  They are just a more nurturing, less strict kind of Dom, and Kit thinks that this is the kind of Dom that I will end up being.  And she is probably right.  It does sound like how I will be with her.  Anyway, this group has discussions every week.  Last night me and Kit joined.  The topic up for discussion was discipline.

Now this was the area that I admit that I was most worried about for myself.  I am not sure how I will deal with the disciplinary part of being a Dom.  Cuz I know that I am not going to enjoy that part, and might even feel a bit awkward.  After that discussion though I am feeling a lot better about it.  There are some really experienced Doms in that group, and I think I can learn a lot from them.  I am even already getting a few ideas about how I will discipline Kit whenever I have to.  The discussion really helped me out a lot in my thinking about it to.  I am still not going to like doing it, but then no Dom likes to discipline their sub, except the extreme ones I am sure.  I do not think I will feel awkward about handing out a punishment anymore.  A sub needs rules and needs to know what is expected of them.  Whenever they step out of line it is their Dom's place to put them back over that line and correct their behaviour.  If I am to be a good Dom, I have to understand and accept that.  And I think that I am able to.  No, I know I am able to.  I am going to strive to be the best Dom that I can be, for my kitten's sake.  She deserves it.  :)"

And I know it is not his responsibility to get me to work, but it is not like it is asking a lot you know?  Considering how much I do around here, giving my Gram money every week, doing dishes every other day because no one else wants to be bothered with them, taking the trash out when everyone else lets the thing build up two feet above the can.  Watching Haley quite often, taking care of her.  Among a few other things.  No one else helps out here as much as I do, with the exception of Mike himself, cuz he does most of the outside stuff.  It is not fun to have to walk back and forth to work.  Someone mentioned to me to get my license and get a car.  I would love to know where I am gonna get the money for a car.  I do not make very good money, and after giving my Gram money each week, paying on my computer each week, paying on my internet every month, and buying as much of my own food as I can, I do not have money for a car at the moment.  Not until I can manage to get a better job.  

Besides all of that yesterday was a bad day.  I was late in getting to work, because somehow I managed to read the schedule wrong.  I thought I went in at 2, but I was supposed to be there by 1.  So I was 40 minutes late in getting to work today.  Which really made me feel shitty.  I have never been late for anything in my entire life from my teenage years through adult hood.  I am not worried about losing the job or anything.  Hell, Adam was late twice and he is still working there.  Still, a day after getting two of those store coupons that they give as rewards down there, for doing a good job selling the boars head meats, this really did not make me feel very good.  I am just going to have to start writing my schedules down again so that I am sure."

Just to let you know, there is going to be some foul language involved in this entry, so you are warned.  Apparently watching a race has reached a significant amount of importance today.  I just asked my Uncle Mike for a ride to work today.  And his response was...""That depends on when the race comes on today, I'm not missing it for nothing"".   That fucking asshole.  You know it takes me an hour to walk to work, and I do not always have a ride available to me.  And when I do have one, it gets snatched away because a fucking race seems to be all important.  Watching a bunch of fucking cars driving around in a circle.  What the hell is so important about this race, that he cannot spare 20 minutes to give me a ride to work?  What?  Afraid he is going to miss someone getting a flat tire?  You know what?  Fuck him, I will gladly walk to work.  It is not like he does it for free or anything either.  Whenever me and Robyne get a ride to work from him, we always put gas in his car.  Which is not a problem, I do not mind doing that.  Especially with the price of gas these days.

Well, in my opinion, the honor is all mine.  For her submission to me is truly a wonderful gift.  For her to give up control over any part of her life to me is amazing.  Because it involves an awful lot of trust, and I know that it is not easy to trust anyone that much.  That it can be frightening to give that much trust and control to someone.  But she does trust me that much, and wants to give that control over to me.  And it really touches me and warms me deep within.  It is hard to describe to anyone who has not been given such a gift really.  It makes me smile every time that I think about it.  It gives me such a joyous feeling, and I want to make this lifestyle for her as satisfying as it can possibly be."

I started one of those yahoo blog things though, and have posted quite a bit in it.  What I think I will do is start to post in them both.  So that no one here gets let out or anything.  

For those who have not been privy to the events of the last month or so, it turns out that I am a Dominant.  Surprised?  So was I.  It seems that the wolf in me has finally decided to come out completely.  And my girlfriend could not be more overjoyed, as she is a natural submissive.  So how about that?  I am going to be entering into a D/s relationship, already have actually, just not physically yet.  And boy am I ever looking forward to the time that it does.  Anyway, sorry again, and I promise I will start trying to keep up to date a little more often."

"event","I only have eighteen hours this week.  Which really, really sucks.  It means that I will make under a hundred dollars this week, which sucks even more.  *sighs*  That and the hour long walks to and from work really suck.  McDonald's is hiring and its less than a ten minute walk from my house.  I would be making more to.  Eighteen hours a week is just not enough.  Hell my normal hours are not truly enough either at that."

"event","I have had a rather annoying day.  At work I found out that because of some screw up or something, I have to tear down the display cases so that they can be cleaned tomorrow morning.  Which means I gotta take out the salads and the boxes they sit on, all the meat trays.  And all the loaves of meat and cheese.  And all the black cloth things that they lay under it.  I gotta stick the salads and meat trays on a high boy, and the loaves in a couple of shopping carts.  Gotta wheel all that into the cooler.  Then I had to sweep up all the mess.  Normally I gotta yank all the signs out, but I did not get to that part cuz I did not have as much time as I usually do.  

Then on the walk back home I stepped on a damned screw in the road.  Went through my shoe and jabbed me in the foot.  Did not break the skin or anything thank goodness.  Still hurt though.  And on that walking home note, its not a fun walk either.  It is an hour long walk.  I have to do it sometimes cuz sometimes, I do not get a ride home cuz of everyone working and all, which really, realy sucks.  I need to start looking for a closer job.  Then, when I got home, I found 5 oranges on my bed.  My three year old niece Haley did that.  It was partly not her fault.  My cousin Robyne was encouraging her to come back to my room and chuck them at me before I went to work.  I still had to put her on a time out though, which makes me feel like an ass, but I gotta do it or she will not learn any better.  It is a constant battle trying to discipline that kid because of Robyne.  *sighs*   Well, I guess I am gonna get myself to bed."

"event","I had to close the deli yesterday.  Uggh, I hate it when I have to close.  It is tiring and boring.  Cleaning the fryer is the biggest pain in the ass about it.  But the worst part is the boredom of it.  Because for the last part of the day you are there by yourself with no one to talk to.  And there really is not enough to do to keep you really occupied.  I have to close tonight and tomorrow night to unfortunetly.  

One good thing though is that Amanda is back a little early.  She was there with me until eight last night.  I love working with Amanda.  Me and her get along pretty good.  We pick on each other all night long.  It's fun.  Granted her being back means I will get less hours, but at least there is another person now to help with the closing duties.  For which I am glad.  Three closers means less of it for me.  

I had an off night last night to.  A little bit anyway.  First a back that I was putting chicken into spilled on me and spilled onto the floor.  Then I misplaced a part to the scanner when I was changing the paper in it and spent twenty minutes looking for the danged thing before I found it.  I always seem to have a bit of an off night whenever I have a day off."

"event","I am bored.  I am off work today and I almost wish that I was working.  Got nuttin to do.  I really should not be on here right now, as I only have dial up and I am on the main house line.  I will not have DSL again until I can get my back verizon bill paid off.  Last time I had it I was using the last of my money that I had gotten when my father had passed away.  Just hoping I would get a job so I would not have to cancel it.  When I ran out of money I still did not call and cancel.  Very stupid I know, but I was so sure that I would find a job.  *sighs*  Maybe I will use part of my income tax to help pay it off combined with what I make working this week.  I might be able to pay it off with that, though I guess it is just wishful thinking.  I will probably have to wait at the very least until next week, or maybe even the week after that.  Until then, my internet access is still rather limited.

I was out passing the baseball around with my cousin earlier, I am a little tired from it, but it is a good tired at least.  Not like the tired I feel when I have to walk home from work.  I live an hour's walk from the place that I work at, and every now and then I have to walk it.  It really sucks.  My uncle, who is starting truck schooling soon, used to be my ride.  But now when he starts his schooling again, I will have to walk more and more.  It can leave me pretty tired, let me tell you.  Especially after closing nights.  I hate closing at the deli.  Mostly cuz it is so boring and I am the only one left there for a few hours with no one to talk to.  That and I hate having to clean the fryer.  

Well, I better get off of here before an important phone call is missed because of me.  It is so hard to stay off though, having been without internet for so very long.  Ah well, later."

"event","Well, as it has been quite a while since I have been able to post in here, naturally, there is quite a bit of news that I can write about in here.  

First and foremost, I have a job, though anyone reading this will already know that I am sure.  Working at a Deli is pretty cool.  The people I work with ther eare really nice for the most part.  Especially the manager Miranda.  Se is great to work for.  It is not every boss that will let you joke around with her as much I do, always teasing and picking on her.  Patty is nice to, but a little scatter brained.  She is the assistant manager.  Scatter brained is not fair, or accurate I guess.  She is just a little bit of a slow worker I guess.  Deb is the best worker there by far.  The woman just zooms around, she really gets things done.  Amanda is nice, though a little ditzy, though she is on maturnity leave.  Then there is Adam.  Though he is a great worker to, he is a little pompous.  The type that thinks he knows everything better than anyone else.  I hate that.  That and he thinks he is funny, but really isnt.  Sometimes he is a little rude to the customers to, but, I can tolerate him.  He tries to be pleasant when I work with him, and that is something I guess.

Now for some news that might shock some, but will make others in the know just shake their heads.  My sister is in jail.  Last year she attempted to rob a minute mart, with a knife.  She was probably high on something at the time.  She is going to be in jail for eighteen months.  I am sorry, but I do not really feel all that sorry for her.  She truly brought this onto herself.  I just hope that it will open her eyes a little bit as to the realities of the world.  

Hmmm, I guess there is not to much more interesting than that.  So, I will leave you to chew on that bit of gossip for a while."

"event","Well, I have failed to get a job.  And now I have been given until the 13th to move out of here.  *sighs*  I will call my grandmother tomorrow to see if I am able to go back there.  And thus lose access to the internet once again.  I would say that I hope that I am able to go back there, but I cannot say that.  For I really truly hate it there.  I love my grandmother to death yes, but I never liked living there when Mikey was around.  The last few times that I was even up there for extended periods of time I got such horrible vibes.  During Christmas I stayed the night there and for some crazy reason I started crying as I was laying in my bed.  Just this 4th of July I came back with a terrible headache.  Now my only hope to stay off the streets is to go back to live there.  I can't help but to feel horribly depressed.  That place just sucks all the life out of me.  But, I guess I do not have any choice.  I am spiraling back down into the mood where I wonder why I even exist in this world.  I certainly do not do anyone any good here.  Not that I have ever seen.  I do not know when I will be back here again.  Knowing my luck it will probably be a very long time. I will miss you all very much."

"event","Well, it would seem that my time is almost up.  And still no job.  In four days I will be asked to leave this place.  Where I go from there, is anyone's guess.  My uncle Scott is living at my grandmother's house.  There realyl is no room for me there.  And besides which, there is already so many people there that the septic tank is almost constantly overthrowing.  If the wrong person sees that, that can get the house condemned.  *sighs and shakes my head*  So not only do I not know if I can go back there, I do not even think it is a good idea to.  There is 6 people already there and the house is not that big.  Not to mention neither is the septic tank.  I walked into the backyard and the overflow from it looks really bad.  And the smell...it is a wonder no one else has noticed it and reported it.  I do not know what my gram will do if that place gets condemned.  

Not only that but I feel constantly more alienated here.  I do not know if it is my own fault and I am withdrawing into myself but I know that I do not like it.  I never thought I would feel like this around my friends here.  But I don't know.  Goddess I hope someone calls about a job within the next few days.  Otherwise not only will I lose access to the net, again, but I do not know were I will be living.  I am so glad my father cannot see me right now.  He had such high hopes for me."

"event","I feel like such a bad grandson right now.  Yesterday my cousin Robyne called me on behest of my grandmother, who wanted to invite me over for a 4th of July barbecue.  Yes it was on the 3rd, but well...they had the fireworks here on the 1st of July, so, might as well have the barecue a little early as well.  Tell me, what is the point of having a holiday on a certain date if you are never going to celebrate it on that day?  Mind boggling I tell ya.  Anyway, I got up there, and I learn that my grandmother has recently had surgery.  You see, she had a couple of arteries clogged in her neck, and went in to get it fixed.  The operation went very well though and she is doing great these days.  So I am very glad for that.  But still I feel like a really bad grandson for not knowing about this before hand.  Anyway, the day went reasonably well, though now I am shamed.  My cousin Mikey, you know, the one that likes to destroy my computer, steal my yahoo accounts?  Yeah, that one.  Well, he now has a job.  Yay.  So I get to be ashamed of myself for my apparent lack of ability to find one myself.  *sighs*  Now I find myself counting on someone I very much despise.  You see, he thinks I could get a job up there, but I would need to find alternate means of transportation to get there and back.  It's a 30-45 minute drive to get the place he works at, and with two people here working and only one vehicle to get back and forth with, it would be insane for Tif to get everyone back and forth from work.  So, if I got in up there, I would almost have to get on the same shift as Mikey, so that I could catch a ride with him.  How is the irony for that?"

"event","Well.  It would seem as though I am in a spot of trouble as it were.  I told you all I got laid off before.  What I have not told you is that my roomates here have given me until July 8th to find a new job or they are going to ask me to leave.  Which I suppose is fair enough.  Without a job I cannot help pay for things.  Without being able to do that then it is not fair to let me stay here.  Though I do not really like the way I was told this.  I got sent an e-mail.  *rolls eyes*  

If I do not have a job by then they are gonna ask me to move back to my gram's.  Only problem is, I do not think that I can go back there.  When I stopped living there the last time my sister jumped right into my room there, and well, now there is not any more room for me up there anymore.  So, if the worst should happen and I cannot find a job by that time...I do not know what is going to happen to me.  

I have a bunch of applications out, got called for one interview.  But I do not know how good my chances are there. There are other applicants, and though I have experience with factory work now, not with that kind.  They build mobile homes.  So though I am crossing my fingers and feeling hopeful, I don't know. 

I really do not know what I am going to do if I cannot find a job in time."

"event","Well, today at work I started out as I always do.  On the zippers.  Unfortunetly, as we are on day shift with office people running around I could not make up all 36 boxes at once as I normally do.  Could only do 4 or 5 at a time, cuz they start to bitch if it gets to cluttered.  *rolls eyes*  Anyway, did that off and on all day.  But something good did happen, I got shown how to clean a grinder, which is something new at least.  But while my friend Gary was showing me how to do that, Steve, our supervisor, came along.  He wanted to talk to us about the black binders that they hang on the presses.  They tell you what to do on that press, what to watch out for and so forth.  Gary knew about them.  So Steve said to him.  ""You already know all this cuz you get moved around a lot"".  Then he said to me, ""You dont but you will"".  I am interpreting this to mean that they plan on keeping me around a while, and that they intend to train me on new stuff eventually...which is great.  :)"

"event","Well, the movie was very good in my opinion.  The fight scenes were excellent as always, and I was so glad to see Anakin stop being such a whiny little brat.  And ohhhh man, Yoda was so freaking cool once again.  That little crack muppet is just awesome when he decides to throw down.  And let me tell you, that army of wookies is NOT something I want to be coming up on if I am part of an invading army.  Someone tells me we are invading Kashyk and I am telling them where they can stick it.  The fight between Obi-Wan and Anakin was awesome as well.  I admit to getting a little misty eyed to when the slaughter of the Jedi commenced, especially when Anakin killed all the younglings.  *turns away and hides a sniffle*  To anyone who has not seen the movie get your but out there and watch it!

"event","Today was a fairly decent day I should think.  We went out to state college today and went to Barnes and Nobles, a movie theatre, and the mall.  At Barnes and Nobles, my own little slice of paradise, I got three books.  Book 6 of the ""War of the Spider Queen"" series, called ""Resurection"".  I also got the first two books of another series that was recommended to me, ""Game of Thrones"", and ""Clash of Kings"".  I am taking a bit of a risk getting those two because of who suggested them to me, a guy at work, on another crew, that I would never have thought to be a reader.  Perhaps his taste in books will surprise me.  At the theatre we checked out the times for Star Wars:  Episode three, but we had just missed the 3:00 showing.  There was another one at 4, but Tiff needed the truck so we did not go.  But we are about to go in about...10 minutes to the theatre in town.  So it's all good.  At the mall we stopped at EB and the movie store that they have there.  I'll tell you all my opinion on the movie after I have seen it.  Also on Darkness, which I rented at blockbuster, we stopped there on the way back.  Later!"

"event","Well at work last night I started on the zippers, as I do at the start of every day.  It's the only time of the day when I feel useful and contributing to the plant's production.  I do not actually do anything with the parts the zippers put out, rather I just get the boxes ready for the day.  What I do is take the box, stick a plastic bag in the box, then put 4 rows of 6 sleeves in it.  Fold the bag and tuck in in, and stack it.  Then the packers will take those out, stick the parts in the sleeves and package them.  After I was done with that Steve had me take this long duster thing and dust the walls of the clean room, great, more janitorial work.  The thing is though, is that the dang room did nto seem to really need it.  I do not think I made a speck of difference in there.  Ohh well, it was something to do for an hour at least.  Then after first break is when I got my first ray of hope.  Steve told my friend Gary, who also works there, to train me on the bender.  This made me happy cuz I was finally learning something new at long last.  I was hoping it would continue after lunch.  But, alas no.  Steve told me then to go out and grind this gaylord full of parts, mostly shitter seats and nut cups.  Yes you heard me correctly.  Among the other stuff we make there, we also make doosh nozzles (spelling?), ass rods, shiiter seats and nut cups, as me and Gary affectionately refer to them.  lol

The shiiter seats are self explanatory, we make the ones used for potty training, the nut cups go with them, I guess they are supposed to help keep the child from peeing all over the place.  Doosh nozzles, well, hehe, women use these for...well...I am not sure I wanna know what they are used for.  The ass rods are used for enemas.  Yes it's a bit crude, but we have to amuse ourselves somehow don't we?  :P

Anyway, don't know if the training on the bender is a ray of hope or just a way to keep me busy for 2 hours.  I guess we will find out when we go back to day shift."

"event","Yesterday and the last couple weeks in general have really sucked for me at work.  Ever since we stopped doing the bird baths they have me doing odds and ends stuff.  Except for the couple weeks they had me doing the centering cores.  Which admitted was the most boring thing in the world, but at least it kept me there and actually kept me feeling that I was actually contributing in a real way.  But now that has stopped as well.  At first I was ecstatic cuz it meant I did not have to sit there in those stupid sleeve, and gloves and stupid nylon coat and sweat my ass off.  But now they got me doing some of the most stupid stuff. Almost every day I blow down the warehouse and sweep it up.  That needs done though often cuz of material getting all over the place.  But then they have me spraying windex all over the glass of the presses and doors, mopping up floors, chipping paint off of venting ducts, and mopping up oil.  It's like they are turning me into a janitor.  Not that there is anything wrong with being a janitor.  Just that I am not all that keen on being one.  But I do not feel that I will even still be around there much longer.  There honestly does not seem to be all that much for me to do.  Half the time I wander around the plant waiting for someone to give me something to do.  And most of the time my supervisors pass me by with not much more than a nod.  They just do not need me around there, I honestly do not know why they keep me there, not that I am complaining on that note.  I just wish I had something important to do, I feel useless there these days and I hate feeling useless.  On night shift I am able tog et away with that cuz there are no office people there to deal with.  But we will be switching back to day shift next week, when they will be there almost all the time.  They see me wandering around that aimlessly and I will not be around there much longer.  Hell I will be surprised if I do not get the call to lay me off over the next few days of break.  Which would suck cuz though the pay is not all that great since I am still just a temp, it is a decent place to work.  I am just frustrated lately. 

Welcome back the grumbling and complaining world of Gary Keith Snook the Third.  Are you still all so glad to have me back here?  lol  ;)"

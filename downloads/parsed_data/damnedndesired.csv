I'm at Rach's place right now with Steph and we're gonna meet up with Jeff later. Anyways, this week has been really stupid cuz the boi was really getting on my nerves. I wannna break up with him and find a dude that will totally trust me and not call me all the time to see if I'm with a guy. Stupid Asshole, men are so not worth it. 

Anyways, we were talking about how we should have gone for Logan and John, at least they would have paid for us for everything. Man, I should totally give him a call and apoligise for the shit I said about him.

Well, I have nothing else to say, so I'm gonna go and beat up the boi."

"event","I was going to go on a two week trip with Lana, Jon (my man.. well he is in my dreams.. he isn't in reality.. as of yet anyways), Jeff, Jeff's boyfriend, and some other guy. My parents and sister were going on a trip too. And we had just moved into a new house, and I was scared to leave it lol, so the night we were supposed to leave, I made everyone stay there instead. We were going to leave in the morning.

So, we were watching tv. Jeff was cuddled up with his boyfriend. And I let Lana cuddle up to my Jon. I knew that since she was living in Calgary (I think she moved to go to school lol), and her boyfriend (Scott ;)) was in Vancouver going to school, she hadn't seen him in awhile, and needed to cuddle up to someone or something, lol. And then so I look over at them, ready to tell them ""Okay, my turn to cuddle with my boy."" and Lana leans over and KISSES him!!!! *glares* I just stared at them, shocked.

So, Lana pulls away, and smiles at Jon and askes, ""What are you thinking about?""
and Jon answeres, ""St-- SHIT."" And they both realize what just happened, and look over at me, and like, jump up, ready to explain that it was all a big mistake or something. And I stood up too (I dunno where I found the strength to do so after seeing my best friend and boyfriend kiss *grr*) and just turned around and walked away. Walked to the Kitchen. and Lana followed me, and was explaining that she was just lonely without Scott, and that she was really sorry. She didn't mean to, and shit like that. I just smiled at her, and hugged her and was like ""Don't worry about it. I understand."" lol, and then I like spilled something on myself or something, cause I went upstairs to my room and changed. I put on this hideous shirt, (I'm guessing it was a gift from Jon, otherwise I'd never be caught DEAD in the shirt.) though it was a kinda cute shirt lol.

And then, I set out to look for Jon. and I found him in the bathroom, staring at himself in the mirror, and every now and then hitting his head against the wall lol. And so I walked in, and shut the door. And looked at him, knowing he had something to say, and wouldn't want me to talk until he got it all out. So I just waitied, and he started to pace, and he didn't want to look at me. Whenever he looked up, he'd just quickly glance at me. And finally he started talking, I don't remember what he was saying, but as he finished, I walked towards him, and just hugged him.

lol, I woke up when we started to kiss *glares* stupid mind, never letting me kiss Jon in my dreams! *whines*


Whenever I dream about Jon, (which is quite alot), I never get to kiss him. *cries*
And whenever I go to bed NOT thinking about Jon, I DREAM about him..

Rach... what do you think my dream means?

Ack! it's 4:30, told sister she could go on. ttyl"

"event","Well I was right Friday was the full moon, and man was I ever energetic. Bri was sooo sweet and went with Jeff and me to BA. It was the first time I was there with a guy, like that; I usually spend the whole night on the dance floor and with whatever guy that tries to keep up with me. But I turned down the one guy that came up to us, he wrapped his arm around Jeff and me, then leaned into me, but I pulled away. I noticed what he was doing but I wasn't interested in the slightest. Nore for the guy at the bar. It was funny I was heading to the dance floor and the guy from the bar was looking at me when I was with Bri and then when I walked away, to the dance floor, he almost gave himself whiplash turning his head. But that wiggle was all for Bri. ;)

Oh I also had a really fucked up dream. Okay so in the first part I was hunting, also hunted by, a very strange man. He was a wizard but also carried some strange disease on him, that was killing millions. Somehow, when I was hiding in a room, he was captured, it became a 'little white room'. Then it streamed off into a Harry Potter dream. Same bad guy, Harry had to go off and study specially to be able to beat him. He had to learn to drive a motorcycle. He already knew how to drive a quad. When he was starting to feel up Draco a lot was when I woke up."

"event","Okay so this is like soooo not my day. (I really really mean it) First my dream before I wake up is about me and my boy having sex, and yes that is a good thing just give me a moment.

Then while I'm on and off between alarm (I set my alarm 7:30, 7:45, 8:00. This is a very hard thing to do as I only have two alarm settings and a snooze button that I usually don't use, and I'm still asleep when I have to do this) I had a dream where I was going to do this duet thingy with one of Bri's friends, might of been that guy with the club and the dancing and the over protectiveness; anyways, so we need help picking out a song so he calls up some one. 

(also note that I woke up and went back to sleep into the same dream) The someone he call was Nick, my Nick, and he jokingly suggested a Nick Tse song, which is kinda cool, and I pissed at him for making fun of my fav artist. There is a really big reason that the Nick in dream is scary but I'll explain that later. 

Then at the trainstation I ran into Sarah, always a bad thing, but also Rob was there too which is a much worse thing. He was the sweetest guy back in High School one of those you can talk to be friends with types. Then suddenly he's like a fucking sex fiend, and he isn't that good looking.

On to why the Nick thing was soooo scary. See I was down with Bri and he started driving down the street that goes to Nicks place, and I told him I was a little uncomfortable going down there because it was the way to Nicks house. So he's like show me where it is, mostly because he lived down that way too. So I tell him the turn off and he's okay yeah I live that way too. But then I tell him the next turn he's like 'fuck you're shitting me right'... Note I wouldn't of know to shit him... and I'm like no, he used to live just up the street from Nick.

Anyways thats not the big thing, I pointed out his house, or the one I think is his house, and Bri tells me that I just made it so Nick would never see the light of day again. It was my choice on what I wanted done to him... The only thing I was worried about was it getting back to Bri, I'm not getting my boy in prison just because of a waste of life like Nick. So thats why I was like ahhh about the dream, scary soooo scary. Add the other people... its been a while since I saw Rob... sometime last semester.

So innocent and trusting... you can be very shy at<br>times, but it's only because you're not sure<br>how to act.  You give off that ""I need to<br>be protected vibe.""  Remember that not all<br>people are good.  Being too trusting will get<br>you easily hurt.

"event","Lalalala! I am so bored, and I had an odd dream again last night. Non famous Scott was in it, and I was like, trying to pee in a co-ed public washroom, and the stall I was in was like three stalls put together. Anyways, Scott comes in just as I sit on the toilet, and some other guy comes in, so I'm like, not peeing but having to, and the other guy leaves, and then Scott finishes, and to make me pee, he starts rapping and telling jokes, getting me to like, laugh it out. It didn't work, and I told him to go out and make sure no one else comes into my stall, and so he does. And then some stuff happened, I forget what, and then Scott's driving me home and we're just talking. I don't know what about I don't remember. But we get to my house, and it looks the same on the outside, but the inside layout is so totally different then it really is. And I go upstairs, to like.. check my email or something.. all I know is I went onto the internet and was talking to Chessy! And my sisters having a sleepover with a few of her friends, and at one point either one of them came out to talk to me, or Scott came upstairs to see me on the puter. lol. Anyways, for the most part, he came inside and was talking to my mum, telling her jokes.

Why would you dream about your own house, and not have the same layout in your dream than it is in real life? 

Anyways...  I'm gunna do the ""How Will Lucius Malfoy Seduce You?"" Quiz thingy, doing four, posting all four. (Or maybe just three... Hufflepuff, Slytherin and Gryffindor. I could be in all three of those houses, I may do Ravenclaw just for fun.)

"event","Girls, I hate you both!!! How is it you both always have a boyfriend, or always have like a million guys interested in you, when I don't? It's frustrating, I hate being single. I've been single for too long, and of course, no one (but Lan or Chels I'm sure) would understand my feelings and thoughts on being single. *sighs* Even Jeff would always have a girlfriend in high school, and if he wasn't so dead set on ""I'm gay, I don't like girls."" he'd probably have a girlfriend now, while I continue to go around being single and not having anyone interested in me. 

I probably wouldn't even mind, if all my ex boyfriends hadn't have been such fucking assholes (Kyle- your not included in this!).  Why can't I get a guy interested in me? And where the hell do I have to go just to find a guy who could possibly be interested? *glares at the world as tears fall from her eyes*

Anyways, So, this weekend shall be fun! :) All I know about Friday is that we're going to dinner and a movie, I think my mum wants me to come home on friday night... *makes face* or on saturday during the day.. probably so that she can drive me to Kim's on sat night, and make sure she knows how to get there for when she picks me up afterwards!

Hehe, last night, I got two new tops. ( A cool tank top one with sleeves, and a sweater that you wouldn't actually wear a tank top or tshirt underneath it.) And today, I got a new pair of jeans, they're really cool... and comfortable. *giggles* And I've changed my one necklace into a braclet, that right now is hanging off of my jeans.

Weee! Rach and Nins both posted, hehe. Already read their post, and to Rach's last comment.. ""Huh??"" lol"

There's two guys there who keep hitting on me, mainly Andrew C, but the boy is 16 for frickin sakes. He gave me the old pick up line, ""Is it just me or did I see you fall from the sky, cuz damn, you look like a sexy angel."" I basically said you need a better pick up line cuz that one is going to keep you from ever getting any. He is so cute and adorable, always makes me laugh.

And my day kept on getting better cuz my boss knew it's my b-day tomorrow, so he gave a $100 tab to Outlaws. I'm gonna save it till Ed's b-day and we can go then. 

On my way home from the train, guess who got on too? Slyvia. My best friend from Beav. We lost touch over the years, she made new friends and so did I. But I got her new number so I'm suppose to call her tomorrow, or she is going to hunt me down, and tickle me to death. hehe. you thought something else, didn't you? 

Well, I'm not gonna comment on Rach's last part of her post cuz I don't wanna get my head stuck in something that probably will never get out of."

Oh Steph by the way and better excuse, or one you should use (not that Nins might believe it) is that you haven't seen Kim in a while and that you can see Nins anytime. Thats what Jeff said, well something along those lines."

Well, today was a little weird...

Okay, so, I woke up late (well, at like 2 in the afternoon.) and then for the next two hours my mum made me clean the kitchen and the bathroom my sister and I share. Okay, I lied, it took me about an hour to get showered and dressed (I was daydreaming! ) and then for an hour to an hour and a half, I was put to work. Anyways, and then I went down for supper (a couple hours later) and saw the travel guide books my dad brought home. hehe, my fam trip is getting closer! Gotta get to Chapters to get some more books, and gotta start on figuring out what I'm gunna pack.

Anyways, and then when I was watching The O.C. my sister said ""You can go on soon, I just wanna finish playing some games."" I didn't even ask if I could go on, and she never lets me on before she goes to bed, unless she's sick. *feels her forehead* I don't think she's sick! lol

Yeah, I dunno why I thought today was weird, but it was. Lol... maybe I had a few odd dreams that I don't remember, and they are making me think that today was a strange day. *shrugs* anyways, I'm gunna go off and do some more roleplaying! :)"

"event","Ohayo all! :) Steph here.

Well, last weekend was pretty cool. On saturday morning, my mum woke me up, and almost right away, me dad took my sister and I to go see Lord of the Rings: Return of the King. It was pretty cool, one of my favorite scenes was when Merry and Pippin were like drunk or whatever.. in the first scene they were in! :) hehe. Oh, and when Pippin was sing- my god, I had to pee like a race horse and I just HAD to stay until he was done singing lol. He has an amazing voice! :)

Then, not long after I got home, Meighan called and said Jeff was going to come over, and wanted to know if I wanted to join. (Or Jeff called me, wanted to do something and then so we called Meighan at Rachels place, and we all decided to hang out. Whatever..) So, my mum ended up driving me over there. :) After Meighan and I went and picked Jeff up from the train station, once we got back to Rachels house, I called up Logan. Nina asked me to, because she and Logan just ""love"" playing phone tag, lol. Anyways, I ended up waking Logan up, he was having a nap because his cousin, Tony, and him and some of his friends were planning to go out. (Again, Sorry man, for waking you up :p). 

So, around 9:30/10:00, Logan and Tony came over to Rachel's place for about an hour, give you take a few minutes. *grins* I was so happy. It was hilarious, Logan started asking Jeff questions on being gay. Tony was trying not to laugh, while Meighan and I couldn't stop laughing. Just the way Logan worded his questions was hilarious, plus the fact that he was asking them, lol. But yeah, all in all, the hour or so they spent with us was fun! :) Although, I wish I had asked Tony for his adress or something, cause I doubt I'll be able to see him anytime soon. Specially since he doesn't even live in Canada.

So anyways, Jeff and I stayed up til around 5 am, we watched Freaky Friday (Meighan's DVD), and I fell asleep after it ended, Jeff fell asleep during the last scene. Meighan had already fallen asleep around 3 am in the basement. 

The next day, when I woke up, Jeff was in the basement playing The Hobbit on PS2, and Meighan called Rachel's cell, to see when Rach would be back in Calgary. So, at about, 3: 30 in the afternoon, we went and picked her up from the bus station. We then just went back to Rachel's to hang out for the day. Rach and I went and drove Jeff all the way home. We stayed there for a couple hours. Jeff popped in Idle Hands, and Rach just had to stay and watch it, to see how it ended lol. She got into the movie right away. Peter was drunk though, he was like.. pissed drunk. Like, really really really drunk! lol. It was more entertaining than the movie was, even Rach agreed to that, even though she was more interested in watching the movie. Because of all the killings lol.

Anyways, I slept over at her house that night, cause we went back to her place after the movie, and went online til around 6 am. I woke up at 12 pm, and an hour later Meighan woke up, and then kinda woke Rachel up. Meighan went to work, but Rach and I decided to see a movie. We invited Nina, but Nina was at work til around 9:30, so we went and picked her up, and then went to go see Honey! :) That was an awsome movie. hehe.

I got home late, after seeing Honey, and went online for a couple hours, and just as I was about to fall asleep (which to me, felt like 2 hours after I went to bed) My mum came in, needing cigarettes and asked me if I had been able to get her a pack. I kinda glared at her, for waking me up just for smokes, but handed her the pack I had (shockingly) been able to get. (I didn't think I'd have enough money in my bank to get her any, and I had enough! hehe.)

But yeah, it was pretty cool. Today (or Yesterday I guess- the 30th.) after dinner, my mum and I went out to Winners. To just, look around. I picked out two tops I'm going to be getting, and a skirt and four pairs of pants I like. My mum will get me one pair of pants (and of course, both shirts. they are both like 25-30 dollars marked down to like 10! lol). With the money my mum gives me, I'm gunna get myself the skirt, or one of the other pairs of jeans (if they even fit.) 

Tomorrow (or Today, I guess.) my mum and I are going to go shopping. She's gunna get her check, give me a hundred dollars. I'm gunna finish with everyones christmas gifts, and then hopefully be able to get one of the jeans or the skirt. And still be able to save some money for when I want to go to the movies or out to dinner or to a club with me mates! :)

Hehe, well, I was supposed to be in bed about 15 minutes ago, and I've got a pretty busy day ahead of me. (Shopping, wrapping gifts, and then getting me ass over to Rachel's, lol.) So I'll ttyl all! Byes!"

"event","So I went to Bonneyville and Thorsby... fun to see the cousins but really boring other wise. Didn't do much at my little grandma's (Bonneyville) but play a lot of card games, read a lot of books, and might of convinced my cousin to join my rpg. At my big grandma's (Thorsby) I have a lot of cousins so it wasn't as boring. Well relatively. The first day there not many of my cousins were there, so it was puzzle playing and talk. When my cousins and other relatives arrived it was more fun. My one cousin Ryan is going to Japan with me, kinda more the other way around. So we were planning that out, and then gift exchange and stockings. Then lots and lots of food, mmmm deep fried turkey. Then a puzzle, card game, and a board game, dirty minds. Its was really funny cuz by uncles and aunts were going purple from laughter at some point. Like when my uncle had to say ""When you bend over you get jumped from behind"" actually he couldn't say it he was laughing so hard. It was a clue and we had to figure out what it was hinting to, leap frog. Another one for that same one was ""You have to spread you legs to do me""

Well, almost done Christmas shopping. Only Rach left and that's gonna be easy to get except Jeffy and I can't find a time to go and get it. Can't wait for New Years'. It's gonna be wicked fun. But It's gonna be sad to cuz it's the last day we get to have Meighan with us. I'm sure, we're gonna go to BC in the summer to see her.

My love life sucks ass. It seems that I never get to hang out with Logan. I'm starting to think that he and I will never get to be together. Oh well, I'm starting to like this other dude at work who will remain nameless. He's too cute, someone who I can always count on.

Well, gotta go for now, nothing else to write. Oh, last thing. Steph, I finally posted!!"

"event","Okay, so today was quite wicked! (today- meaning Dec. 26th)

Jeffy woke me up at like 10 am, after a minute I hung up on him and fell back asleep again. Woke up at 10:30, stayed in bed for almost half an hour lol. Meigh called me a little after 11, and she said she was going to go boxing day shopping with her dad. So, I went downstairs and asked my mum if she could drive me to chinook, so that I could go boxing day shopping with Jeffy and Nin. My mum finally said okay after a little bit. I was talking to Jeff on the phone, and then he suggested that he and Nin meet up with me at dalhousie station. My mum liked that idea better (lol, considering she doesn't like driving.) 

So, Jeff and I called up Nina, and we all worked out a plan. Then around 2 pm, my mum dropped me off at dalhousie station and just as I got to the platform the train Nin and Jeff were on arrived. We then walked to Starbucks, so that they could get some napkins. Then, after finding out that the 10 bus didn't go to market mall, we decided to go to chinook. 

As soon as we arrived at Chinook, we went and got our tickets for the movie. (Cheaper By The Dozen.) Afterwards, we went to the food court, so that Nin and Jeff could get something to eat. And after we all got some ice cream from Dairy Queen, and finished it off, we went to Chapters. All three of us picked out Meigh's gift, and part of Rachel's. Nin and Jeff are chipping in on buying her something else, while I'm gunna buy her something else myself, and just add it to what I already got her. 

Jeff also went into HMV and got himself a cd- Britney Spears' In The Zone. (We've all got that cd now lol.. ;) it's awsome!) 

Umm.. ooh, So, I've got Nin's christmas gift, and Meigh's now. (Although I still feel like I should get them something else as well.. *shrugs* anyways...). I got part of Rachel's, and I just need to get Jeff's. :) I know exactly what I'm going to get him, *giggles*. We are all exchanging gifts on New Years Eve. :) Which also gives me time to wrap the pressies, hehe.

Oh, Nin told me something exciting :) (well sort of, lol.) Tony hasn't left yet, and wants to do something with us before he does leave.. I sure hope I can see him before he leaves, just so I can say goodbye, and get in a little bit of Tony dosage to last me for a little bit. Hehe, maybe see if I can get his adress, or internet handles (if he has any). 

Umm yeah.. not much else to add/post. Maybe Nin will actually post something sometime soon. I'm sure Rach would have, if she was able to get onto the internet at all.. she's away for a few more days. We all miss her, but she's coming back on Sunday or Monday! :) Which is cool.

Ack, another long add by me... wow, and I thought my life was boring ;) lol.
Night all.. I'm gunna head off to bed. (I'll try and make my next post short, lol)

Wait- I just remembered.. Cheaper By The Dozen, was a great movie. It was hilarious, and even had a sad part. Which is always good for comedy movies. Now, I'm a quite emotional person, and I feel if a movie can actually make me cry it's worth seeing. And this movie made me cry! *grins* hehe.. I see my emotioness as one of my stronger points, go me! lol

Now I'm off.. buh byes"

"event","Okay so, today was pretty eventful.

First off, I slept til like.. 1: something PM. I had a pretty strange dream... My family was going on a fam trip, and Rach was coming with us, because Rach and I were gunna be the two main female lead characters in some movie. Anyways, so after meeting the other actors that are going to be in the movie with us, we're walking around, and I have a premintion. (Dude, a Preminition in my dream!!!! How bizarre is that? It still scares me.) Okay so anyways, in my dream preminition, I'm at the doctors with my father, mother, sister and one of the other actors from the movie. And the doctor tells me I'm pregnant. and I'm like ""Oh my god! I can't believe my family is here to hear this."" and then it shoots to the actor guy, going to his girlfriend and telling her he got me pregnant. And she breaks up with him. Lol.. I woke up and was like ""Odd dream... wonder if there's any meaning behind it.."" lol. So I plan on asking Rach and Meigh if they think it has any meaning to it, and what the meaning might be.

Then.. about twenty minutes after I woke up, Jeffy calls me. Chandra hasn't been paying her bills, and the cable went, and the electricity will be going off sometime this week (or next.) Peter (Chandra's bother) isn't impressed with her, and actually is starting to hate her... his own sister! That's pretty bad. Chandra has also been calling us all bitches and whores and shit like that, behind our backs. The only reason Jeffy and I found that out, was because Jeff told Peter that one of us heard Chandra call us whores. *shakes head* So yeah, Jeff is hoping to move out by midnight Fri night, cause thats when Chandra is coming hope. I forget where Jeff said she was. But yeah, Brian is suspected, now, of stealing Rachel's perfume. (Tell you more about it when I see ya Rach :))

So anyways..  while I'm talking to Jeff, Chandra's mom calls him. Cause Peter had called her, and told her some of the stuff about Chandra, but then he had to go, to work or something. So anyways, Jeff and I ended up getting cut off while he was talking to Chandra's mom, and he called me back when they hung up. She told him it's legal for him to just up and leave, so that's what he's planning on doing. He told me Ally offered to let him live with her until it was time for him to move in with Nina. Both my mum and I said ""No, don't even think about saying yes to that offer."" It'd be just like living with Chandra, only with someone who I can't tolerate half as much. lol

Later on, after hanging up with Jeff for the second time, my mum put me to work. I had to mop the floor, clean the counters, sink, and a few dishes that can't be put into the dishwasher. And then I finally got a shower, and it went cold halfway through it :(.. oh well, lol.

And then, tonight, I met my brothers new girlfriend, Leah. She's pretty, and pretty nice... but I got an odd vibe off of her. Like she didn't want to be here, or something.  *shrugs* oh well.. and she kept looking at me.. or my necklace I should say. I tried hiding it a few times, before I realized she was looking at it, guess it didn't work. I wear it all the time, sept for when I'm in the shower. I even wear it when I'm sleeping, hehe. Oh and also, I was SOO quiet tonight, I was more quiet tonight, when meeting Leah, then I was when I met Tony, Logan and John. (Although, I was pretty quiet when meeting them, hehe.)

*Shrugs* Anyways.. and my sister and I got to open our gifts early. I got a new watch, a flute, some music, a cd (from my brother-- Fefe Dobson), some clothes, and some kind of mat type thing... some hair stuff.. not much else. I think there is something else, but whatever.

Ooooh, it's midnight now.. Happy Christmas everyone!!!! 

Gunna go for now though, buh byes.

Wow...I half figured I woulda seen more of those movies... on both lists. *shrugs* Oh well... there sare still quite a few (from both lists) of movies that I wanna see.

Anyways, onto other things, like I knew I wouldn't, I didn't see Tony this weekend. Almost saw him tonight, but then Nina couldn't go, and we won't be spending the night at Jeffy's ever again, and Rach probably wouldn't have been able to go anyways, because of her family plans for tomorrow. Meighan didn't wanna go, and yeah. Oh well, hopefully next weekend... actually, with my logic, if we see the guys next weekend, it'll be VERY lucky... long story, sort of.

Uhh... ooh, I got Nina's gift, not sure if I'll get her an addition to the gift, but yeah, I got it! Yeys! Now I only really have to worry about Meighan's gift, Rachel's, and Jeff's. Actually, I already know what I'm getting Rachel and Jeff. (Well, half of Rachel's anyways...)

Well.. this is a long post as it is, so I'll end it there, and I'll post tomorrow or monday or something. Toodles! (Ack! BAD memory...)"

"event","Yes, Chandra's quite a bitch. I'm Rachel. *waves* She stole my perfume, its was one of my favorites too. *glares and growls*

We aren't staying there over night again. Not that I would want to anyways. Of course we do have to go there and piss her off. *evil* We still haven't found her tape-recorder.

But I have a boyfriend of sorts. He was suppose to be Steph's but she had the bad luck, like usual, of being taken. *winks* Oh well... He's name is Brian but I gave him the nickname MB... He's preth (Goth/Preppy) *giggles*

Hmmm, also I'm trying to quite smoking this is my second day. Not going well, but awwww. Yeah when we, Steph Nina and I, were at Kyle's they kicked me out for a smoke. So its not really working to well.

I'm watching a old black and white film. Its suppose to be scary but its just bad. The actress looks like Lucy Lawless. The monsters all bad and stark negative, and radioactive, and speaks like one the the droids off of Dr. Who. 

Thats about it for now, but hey I wrote something."

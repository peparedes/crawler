"event","well it just so happens that ive been a bad girlfriend again, and me and cody are no longer., i hate to think its done because we had good times, 
but toms river
well lets just say
i wish toms river was a little town in australia or something.
so much fucking bullshit in my life that i can dedicate to that place.
i guess it all really started when brian got punched in the face, it was such a turn off i mean, i didnt want anything to do with it or the person who thinks that its fine.
i guess im just failing on this aspect in my life. ive gotten good grades, i love my family, i have great friends, but i just have a relationship problem. i want to be able to do what i want when i want and i really get turned off when a guy says, ""you cant do that."" in my mind, that makes me want to be like ""ok, watch me.""  
this scares me because i look at some people in my family and they just never got married and are the total worst with relationships, i mean they just do as they please like me. and i dont want to be that way forever, but for now i really guess i cant handle having a relationship.
and oh for that cell phone, he owes me 106 bucks, but ill handle that later.
i feel good. i feel civil, no regrets, time to start over. im like a fucking snake. just peeling the skin. i just hope it keeps growing back. please god, just fucking help me out. im so lost lately.
tomorrow i leave for cancun. im going to miss my friends and my cat. well im a little emotional, we need some lyrics:

and someday soon I'll get it right 
and then you'll see just how good I can be 
so don't ask me about forever because right now I'm feeling lost 
but there's got to be some place for me because if there isn't where will I go? 
Will there be some place for me and will you be waiting there for me? 
If and when we get there please catch me before I crawl all the way home 
but I won't stop until you do.


And I'm not handling this well
You never know just what you have
Until you get it yanked out of your chest
Well that's it
I'm walking to the water
I'm standing on the bank
I'm staring at my reflection
Oh my god, I look pathetic tonight
Well, guess what
I'm diving in this river
And I'm fishing out my heart
And I'm never gonna let you get your hands on this again."

"event","ok, let me start off by saying that tonight was absolutley insane and i feel like a bad person, because i am.
brian calls me in front of cody. i let cody know that he toilet papered my car, and he was already pissed. so of course i have to listen to cody and drive to jackson so he can just punch him in the face. i dont know why i let it happen, but i did and i cant take it back.  after all of that goes down and im already upset that i let it happen, 3 cop cars pull us over and make me get out of the car, tell me im liable for arrest and that im ignorant.  i didnt even want to look at cody at that point, i was so mad and regretful.  i dont hate brian, its just of course my boyfriend has a problem with him, all the computer bullshit and the car thing, everything in the passed just got him so heated...
so we go home, act like everythings fine and drive to red bank.  we get onto broad street and codys mom calls and is like get the fuck home..the cops called his house and let them know what happened.  we get home and he got yelled at, not as bad as i expected.  he knows he was wrong, as do i.

i just feel really horrible about this.  im so impulsive and there was no reason for me to listen to him, i really didnt have to but i did, to avoid another fight..weve been fighting all week, and i hate fighting with him..we were always the ones who got along wonderfully.

i think this happened tonight for a reason. we went home and talked for hours, enjoyed each others company and expressed how bad we felt, he felt bad for not listening to me and respecting me.. i did not want to do it.
i told him that there was really no reason for this to happen, but it did.    
then i got a call from col saying that it was fucked up.. like DING DING DING I KNOW... i know, i know i know.

it kind of reminds me of the amy thing that happened with adam, like we didnt want it to happen but its like we were responsible.

on another note, i got my nose pierced and lo got her first tat. it was like wow. we just kept saying wow..wow..
<3

cody, i love you. youre a big teddy bear who really doesnt want to harm anything, you just want to protect what you care about and it happened to be me... and when those things come together it turns into you doing something stupid. i know this is it with fighting for you. youre done, im done with being dumb also.  

brian, just know i regret speaking to you on the phone, and being a fucking sneak. i was retarded and im learning how much it mustve confused you and pissed you off. i dont think and i never have with you, just keep away from me for the good of me and you. im sorry."

"event","yeah no school for stephanie today, to much on my mind and so little time.
we went to the regent. talked, its like therapy time, then imlayston after getting in trouble. aunt natalie and margaret definitley got our asses in trouble, oh well the robo cops will be after us tomorrow,..
after school i organized my life, it was really replenishing.
then we went to the doc, it was like a big partay in the waiting room. thank god cody came and freed me from that shitty tension.
we went back to his house and then met up with everybody again,then decided we needed some alone time. i love that. really, when we find no one else at the house, its beautiful. we could totally sell our love making but you know how those things are...sentimental.
so we watched cops, and i made him watch american idol for a little bit which he totally enjoyed. i swear guys try to hide their excitement for that show. we also watched 60 minutes which was really interesting. why am i talking about tv shows? im so gay.
i just got those butterfly things thinking about him. <333
like really, im just so happy when hes holding me, i feel so complete and content with everything thats going on. not even content, ecstatic that this is finally happening the way it should. im going to miss him so much, i really was thinking about it when we were watching the 60 min special on sadamm and it made me a little scared, just to think that hes going to have to be so brave. i know he can do it. hes such a strong person in and out. will power i wish i had...kelly watched tv on his head today and it was probably the cutest thing ive ever seen a dog do, but then again i prob thought it was that cute because codys head was involved. im a dork.

that was amazing tonight by the way. legs are shaky. ha. whew.

"event","ok so everyone knows im totally neurotic, but mix a missed period with me and hysterics slash anxiety just pretty much oozes out of me. and that was this week, until now because im bleeding. i just want the world to know NO  i am not having no babies. thank you god, really, me and cody are lucky and were irresponsible. and breaking that to my mom was ridiculously hard. ive told her alot in the past, but this? sex? pregnancy? taking a test with her? i give her credit for not shooting herself right there.

so, me and my friends had a funny night last week, we fucking left at midnight and had a midnight get together with blodgett. i love that kid. hes almost as spontaneous as me. maybe. and then we saw adam! what the fuck fuck fuckin havent seen him in AWHILE. he looked so cute in a button up and he smokes now?? dont start that ish. (you got your shout out ad, fucking shh now) so we drove around and had some fun, fucking went to the regent and got food and puked. too much regent.

today we went to cols, and everybody died their hair and hates it now, good thing i had no money to buy the damn shit. itll wash out guys, funny though..

then me and cody went to a moooviee. butterfly effect is real trippy. it was a really good story line.

i need to let something out.
i cant really let this out of my mouth because its so emabarrassingly corny, but sometimes i could almost cry when i look at my boyfriend. i absolutley care about him so much i cant even find the words for it. today we were sitting waiting for the movie and he kissed me, and i didnt want to stop kissing him, i just wanted to kiss him and kiss him and take his clothes off and go at it right there. i guess thats why we got in that predicament this week. like we were sooo tense and feeling so edgy and really didnt even know how to approach talking about it, we ended up yelling and i cried, but it was just because we were so nervous. it was positive that that went down in my eyes, because we were bottling it all up. we both know for sure how much we mean to eachother and fighting just wont happen, especially over stupid things.
sometimes i just look over at him and im like is this happening? is he really there? someone fucking slap me. just the way he smiles or holds me, he shows me that he cares and i love him so much for that, honestly, i dont know what i would do without him now. and when he leaves im going to pray that absence makes my heart grow fonder, because this is really the most beautiful relationship that i want to see myself in for a long time. we get along so well, enjoy eachothers company, and are honest with eachother. 
bills moms boyfriend died, and he is such a good friend and went over there like a gentleman and kissed his mom, and talked to bill, and i was looking at him thinking, he grew up. we grew up. how did that happen? a few years ago i would tease him about how he couldnt tap it, and he would just make me sit on his lap, and now, well now he totally has me head over heals, not to mention hes tapping it. mission accomplished babe, you make my knees weak. is it bad to say i think im really falling in love? i feel older, like love can be so real now, and it feels so right, so yeah, i am not lying to myself. im in love. i know the phrase is still shaky but i just want to say it so much sometimes, but thats how i feel and i hope that its mutual. thank god for you. really, youve shown me so much and i thank god for you."

ramapo has orientation real soon like march 6, im so excited to be going up there and having a good time. i have to send the musical theatre director some tapes of me and get a head start, im going to be right by new york so auditions should be fun, or just partying and getting served in ny should be cool too.

last night was a fucking adventure. i got home at like 3, saw some people i have not seen in the longest time. we had so much fun but i fucking puked and so did lauren> perhaps the regent coffee twice a day isnt a good idea? well lou bought me toast and i felt alot better.

me and kris are going to be con artists today and beg old men for money.
IMLAYSTON is in full effect today. its fucking 42 degrees? jump on the advantage. we are going to the horse farm and cemetary to take pretty pictures and be peaceful, then family planning center because some people like to scare others about gonnorhea. haha wesley, what a kidder. he had me up til like fucking 4 that night worrying and being like oh my god his dick is burning, and then he turns that one around. well ill be in full effect and get him when he least expects it.

"event","ok, colleen..it was perfectly fine for stating your opinion. because it was valid and had a lot to back it up. you never meant to start a fight again or anything, its your journal and you say what you want.
 
SO ON THAT NOTE. THIS IS MY JOURNAL AND I SAY WHAT I WANT TONIGHT!

i think it is a disrespectful, gross thing to take the leftovers. they are 3 year leftovers with fucking mold on them. (aka tortured soul. get the metaphor fucks)


no one should be starting fights over this bull. its funny, no one really cares what these 2 to with themselves, but we are girls. and friends who consider themselves loyal or at least people who have respect for themselves dont let out huge secrets and stab people in the back, and they especially dont ex-boyfriend steal, twice.

i think its so gross that a person can do that, i mean what is there to talk about anyway,? how fucking much they hate someone? and especially when you sucked off the kids best friend for a week. i mean COME ON HERE!

so anyway. im really done being mean, really. i mean i just put that in there because some ugly bitch computer shit talked on my best friend. and that just dont make sense since shes so god damn mature you know?

ok as for girls, i hate them. im crazy, a bitch, call me what you will. i honestly could give 2 shits. i love my girls. you know why? because we have our heads on straight. if i broke up with cody, and lauren went for him after we got in a huge fight im sure people would look at that and be like wow. thats disgusting and really just skanky.

so i hope everyone gets the moral of the story. dont ex boyfriend steal. and as for the friends this girl has now, they better watch out. 


 i mean come on if they do anything bad or something she sees as immoral, shell go tell everybody and then steal their ex boyfriends because she ""always had a crush on him, she always thought he was cute,"" and the girl who was with him didnt really like him anyway.i guess thats what the confusion was. i guess people dont realize that relationships go sour, but no girl is a superhero and can save the guy from a broken heart. all they can do is warm those leftovers up in the microwave and hope that the insides arent cold..."

then cody came over. i love him. we watched some weird shit on michael jackson and got nauseous. kissing him is always a plus. whoa. fireworks...i could spend every second so happy with his strong arms around me. i cant even start this. it will be a novel.

i want to party with ame this weekend. i miss col, i saw her today but thats just not enough honey.! funny poem by the way, i love you.

im so happy that we are all in a good place in our lives now. real friends, real relationships, real peace. no one needs bullshit, and im glad that is all thrown away. as for kristen, ive never seen her so strong. thank god. i guess prayers do work.

hold me

my dad has no idea who i am. what i do, or what i even have attempted to do. so fuck you dad.
""and i smoke like a chimney...and yes..i left. the refrigerator door half open..daddy."" 
fuck them. i want to go to canada. not fucking some dumb mexico. and ill be stuck with his stubborn ass.
i think he fails to realize im smarter than him in alot of ways. i know exactly why he gets mad at me or anything, why hes always taken out his anger on me, and why hes such an anal fuck.
stop placing your stress factors on my back. you have my whole life, and im a stressed out mess from it. i havent even began to rebel yet dad. if thats what you want then so be it. keep fucking treating me like my feelings dont matter..its what your dad did to you and thats exactly why your sister ran the fuck away from shit..]
jesus. dont we see a resemblence..daughter runs away from idiot stubborn anal father. 
sometimes i look at kristen and understand why she ran. its a stupid thing to say but i wish i had the balls so my parents would realize im not their little fuckin science project. i got into college, ive paid my insurance, ive worked, ive done awesome in school, been active, but i have this hard time and they have to take away what i actually need.? ok..well if they wont let me drive to school, then i just wont go.fucking idiots.

anyway. on with life. BACK TO REALITY..LAUREN.ha.. i saw amy today!!!! me and her and lauren went to the regent and hung out for awhile. then i went home for a little..went to brick and saw my darling man. i fucking love him. he measured my butt. it was really funny. i just want him to know that i want all this side bullshit with brian not to interfere. i love him too much to lose him, and thats the fuckin truth. i just want him to be happy with me and what we are, not what i was with someone else..sure hes had ex girlfriends, crazy ones actually. but brian doesnt know how to let go and its scary.i just want to lead a different life now, and i want it to be only with cody, because hes been right for me all along. i was so confused and i finally figured out that hes so perfect for me, and just thinking about him gave me butterflies.i want him in my bed right now with me ripping his clothes off. hes so beautiful. especially when inside of me. pure perfection right there. im so lucky to have met him 3 years ago.just took me such a fuckin long time to realize oh hey. hes yours. ha. i think he forgives me for it now.

i miss my friends. i got home too late from the show so i didnt call colleen. i miss lauren. shes probably going crazy stuck in her house. or maybe shes working. who knows. i gotta call her.
me and cody went to the trd with son and wes..it was snowing outside and when me and cody were in the car we listened to classical music and it was like a movie. hah.
not to bring up the past, but i realized something today. i have a really amazing boyfriend. yea yea youve all heard it over and over but i want to talk about something here.ive never been apologized to. like he said something just kidding around, and when we were home he made it a point to apologize even though he didnt have to. i never had that before. it makes a girl feel like someone really loves you. obviously since they dont want to hurt you in any way, even verbally. and i never had a guy pay attention to me in public and treat me like i was their girl. like he pays attention to me, makes it a point to come over and give me a kiss at a show and hang out with me? maybe these are just basic things but its my first time experiencing being treated like this and i appreciate it. thumbs up for my love.
god im going to fucking miss him. hes such a turn on. sometimes i just want to rip everything off of him and lock the doors so he cant get out until the morning. we need some serious alone time. just leisurly time, light the candles, take our time, ease into everything. i want to just be lost in him. yeah. i want to lose myself in him. that sounds about right. i want to take a bath together. and make a healthy dinner. that would be fantastic.
so anyway, ramapo in the fall which im totally psyched about. i cant wait to experience college. its so scary but so great. i cant believe i did it. and i got into a good school, my first choice. its so beautiful there.
its snowing, and i can feel the cold air through the windows. this sucks. im going to go wrap myself in blankets. goodnight."

everything 
.
ok let me start making sense. it doesnt matter what we are doing. we can be out in the city or just laying in bed looking at eachother and i am so unbelievably taken away by this love we have for eachother. honestly, ive never felt more beautiful. is that a jessica simpson song? hahaha
tonight i just went over there. ive been sick and i felt a little under the weather and i swear when he put his arms around me i felt so comforted and just stopped feeling shitty. he has an effect over me in a huge way. all the little things he does..he listens to me bitch about how stupid the world is and we talk about how much ""finesse"" we have. yeah..""finesse."" its like this big guy with tats can tell me i have finesse and that he likes style..like oh my god code ahahaha.
he gave me a beautiful ring for christmas.
hes leaving for the marines in july, and honestly, im going to miss him desperatley. i try not to bring him down and say that but i am.
hes so bluntly honest. like me. and the conversations we have are so fun and interesting because we are truthful. i feel like im hiding nothing. im shedding it all and im not afraid, because he loves me just the way i am, and he has, for a long time. but i was in another world.
its just amazing how someone i ran away from and wanted to punch in the face totally swept me off my feet.
and let me tell you. he gave me my first. im not getting into that but that was an experience in itself.
i love how i walk in his house and the fireplace is always on like at my house. i love his mom, and his brother and sister. and his dad owns a tattoo shop, and he likes going to new york. how more perfect can you get for me?
and he likes watching movies and falling asleep in my arms.and yogurt and healthy food.
when i kiss him, i feel safe and like his arms could hold me up and support me if a tital wave was coming or something. i just feel so passionate.
he shows me things, like attempting to teach me stick, and i show him that theatre isnt such a dorky thing.
we dont plan, we just do. take things day by day. we want to just drive sometimes..we are going to vermont and then canada..just because we never saw it. finally someone to be a semi hippie with.. or not.
i didnt think i could drop the L bomb on another guy after my big crazy long fiasco. but im learning to love, respect and cherish people that i do love, instead of fuck them over.
and i can honestly say that i love him. tonight he kissed me and says, ""you know, i really do love you. you mean the world to me. youre my world steph.""

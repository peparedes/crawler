You: how fabulous we have the xx and xy chromosomes BOTH covered
You: now tell me your dreams
Stranger: have a sex with a nice girl...
You: there are no ill effects of talking to this random stranger tell me the things you hide deeply and dream about in your soul, not just your body
You: we are all animals and desire sex
Stranger: so can i fuck you ?
You: but what do you dream about that makes you wake and wonder if you are really human?
You: sure you can fuck me
You: you can also know me, build a sandcastle with me

Stranger: if you show me your pussy...i can do it better...
You: hey mr duh. there is no upload picture feature on this thing and i'm too lazy to take a pic, upload it to a site and link you
You: i mean really? what do YOU have to offer?

Stranger: like a bitch,,,right?&gt;
You: bitching fantastic i say
You: yes
Stranger: you are a bitch ,right?
You: well the fact that &quot;bitchin&quot; is an adjective that defines me somewhat COULD also relate me to being a bitch
You: you are not bitchin so you are definately not a bitch
You: i'm not disconnecting by the way
You: i will start to talk about cheese and rectangular assholes if you don't get interesting
You: use a thesaurus if you have to, i can wait.

Stranger: i wanna say godbye...
Stranger: because i cant see your pussy...
You: but then supersonic cheese wave begin to immerse you in a strange aura that dissolves your fingers leaving you with the inability to hit that dagnammit disconnect button and you decide to be my interesting friend with no words instead
You: and you grow a greater understanding of the human desire to connect at a soul level and spill your inner most thoughts to me
You: ok. go!
You: we all gots problems, if your biggest one is your desire to spooge then i guess i can't help ya, BUT THATS BULLSHIT, i know you got more on your mind

"event","dear fred,
&nbsp; if you weren't dead i would blame you for my relapse.&nbsp; now i blame you because i know if your words had already been tattooed across my chest as planned, i wouldn't have been shoving needles in the veins of my tits the other day.&nbsp; i'm pretty sure the reason i haven't gone through with the tattoo is how offended my lover has voiced he would be to see a past lovers words right over my heart, and he doesn't fuck me when i'm sad, so maybe its his fault.&nbsp; fucking myself with tar and sharps is more dependable and keeps me sooo warm.&nbsp; i'm on my dead mates path, i hope to meet him here.&nbsp; 

yeah and i know, if i had gotten off and stayed off at the last exit and done something different with my life instead of just hovering right near the onramp i wouldn't have caved so easily, yes i know i'm at fault, yes i know.&nbsp; and i hope no one finds anything good to say about this.&nbsp; and i hope i fall overboard and drown.&nbsp; this place is toxic and my life keeps turning to brown to cope.&nbsp; but i smile,&nbsp; I SMILE, so deeply when i smell her cooking.&nbsp; &quot;let it all go&quot;&nbsp; 


today is ok, ya know?
i'm not on drugs and it's ok, ya know?&nbsp; i wish i had better company and a warmer climate, but the suns out.&nbsp; hey the suns out.&nbsp; thanks for the vent.&nbsp;"

this down time is a gift.&nbsp; the heavy weight of body gives the heart a chance to explore its limits.

we are touching even though no matter contacts directly.&nbsp; i blew my nose on a shirt alot the last few nights, it felt silk.&nbsp; my body danced for 4 or 5 hours last night, stopping to sych pulse to beat and breath to timed repeatativity, a long meditation filled with visions of birds on my eyelids.&nbsp; i don't remember when i started dancing with my eyes closed.&nbsp; perhaps its always been.&nbsp; body body body body bodybody bodybobdyobyob and head, floating on water. i could feel it in my cells sloshing, and followed it.&nbsp; yes, mushrooms held my hand, but i held my heart.

"event","i am in the most stable place to dream as i know every square inch and can keep it stable in the dreaming, my parents house,&nbsp; where i grew up, of course its the most stable location.&nbsp; and its also where we first met.&nbsp; when i was 6, he sent me aliens outside of my sisters bedroom window.&nbsp; i was in that room sleeping or not, it doesn't matter,&nbsp; he had his reasons.&nbsp; he was only 10, i have no idea what it is to be 10 on his world.&nbsp; we have crossed dream paths so many times its countless.&nbsp; so many forms, light and dark.&nbsp; i always thought perhaps someday i woudl run into the dreamer here in this place, waking.&nbsp; but that just isn't where he is from.&nbsp; i could have woken in his world,&nbsp; this morning.&nbsp; but i would have been leaving something very precious behind.
the dreams starts as his father and he show up at my parents door.&nbsp;&nbsp; they enter and somehow tell me its time.&nbsp; i am meant to be existing in his world and we are promised to each other there.&nbsp; its strange and feels sudden. i don't know him, i recognize nothing about him.&nbsp; he looks young, perhaps 14.&nbsp; glowing blond hair, glowing blue eyes swimming with fractals, and a unicorn horn smack in the middle of his forehead.&nbsp; his father as well.&nbsp; there is a world waiting for me,&nbsp; i belong.&nbsp;&nbsp; something seeps into the dream, there is someone missing,&nbsp; someone i cannot leave without remembering and seeing.&nbsp; i am handed a unicorn horn, it seems to be metallic of sort and grows longer when i point it downwards.&nbsp; its a choice, if i put it to my forehead,&nbsp; i transform and am agreeing to go home and marry this boy.&nbsp; it terrifies me.&nbsp; i say hell no and freak out but they are so incredibly insistent that this world of alien contact, magic and far advanced technology is where i belong and have been tied to this place and this person since before i was born.&nbsp; 
it floods in like a hurricane.&nbsp; dustin.&nbsp; i express in some telepathic form this cosmic connection i alredy have to someone here and tell them i cannot leave with out at least seeing him again, knowing if dustin is real.&nbsp; 
i am in front of a mirror and three girls sit around me,&nbsp; one of them feels like dustin but she isn't him when i look at her.&nbsp; she wants to know how the horn would look on my forehead and without notice set its there,&nbsp; on my forehead.&nbsp; it rests for a moment and i fill with fear again at the possibility that i was just tricked into agreeing to leave for this world.&nbsp; dustin comes back into my head and the horn falls off into my hand, i realize my hair was in the way and it was just stuck to my hair, not my forehead.&nbsp; its laying in my hand and although the desire is overwhelming to put it back on my head,&nbsp; i turn towards the boy and forcefully insist i cannot go.&nbsp;&nbsp; he nods his head in agreement and although his father seems mad he just nods.&nbsp; he is closer to me now,&nbsp; inches from my face looking into my eyes,&nbsp; i see a burden unraveling in his fractal iris.&nbsp; he wants to tell me something and he is judging by my eyes whether it would hurt me more for me to know or if its important that i do.&nbsp; he chooses.
some kind of light unravels around him.&nbsp; the dreamer returns.&nbsp; he tells me of every other dream where we have crossed,&nbsp; i remember them even in the dreaming.&nbsp; he is the boy from the maze club over lava where cars float in the sky and colors shift at will.&nbsp; i kissed him there for the first time.&nbsp; he is the boy from the underground with the tubes coming out of his head and the burns over half of his face (there is a story behind this too, but its long.&nbsp; the only importance is that i FOUND HIM in that dream.&nbsp; i hunted him down and healed him)&nbsp; he is the boy that pulled me from the experimental tank where i was submerged fluid and sucked me into his dream where he was fumbling with bullets that kept falling from a gun.&nbsp; he was fnord cale bossa in the attic of the house of tunnels i crawled through seeking a treasure and finding it was him.&nbsp;&nbsp; he was the force that crushed me and held me to the floor again in the entrance to that house the next night, it felt good. he was the boy in the pool who erased ben from my mind and beckoned me to follow him into a pit of black water that i was sure meant certain death, i was scared and could not follow.&nbsp; there are another 20 or so dreams but to list them all now would take a billion year.&nbsp; one more: he was the fox who had a space ship for legs that flew me through the stars with me in one hand and a bowl of cherries in the other as he one by one placed them in my vagina.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; ""from what came within the darkness, became pure light""&nbsp; he whispers to me.&nbsp; although his energy is now as obviously familiar to me as ever,&nbsp; i see what miht be his true form for the first time.&nbsp; again,&nbsp; he is the unicorn boy with light for hair and swirling fractals in his eyes.&nbsp; i push my face to the side of his, my lips barely touching his cheeck and try to inhale him.&nbsp; he is another life.&nbsp; 
i fall backwards and dustin catches me.&nbsp; i am so overwhelming happy to see him, he holds me close to his body.&nbsp; i know what the right thing to do is.&nbsp; i know i have to stay.&nbsp; he sees how torn i am.&nbsp; something about a place in london is spoken of and i know they must return.&nbsp; 

i will never see home again...&nbsp;&nbsp; my world of alien unity, perfected technologies beyond human ability to conceive, and magic is lost.&nbsp; it hurts.

i am in bed beside dustin,&nbsp; somehow ""he"" is there suddenly over me.&nbsp; he says goodbye and kisses me on the forehead.&nbsp; he falls to the ground dying and disappears into light.&nbsp; i know somehow that he has given me a gift to go home and be able to come back at will,&nbsp; to open the doorway.&nbsp; i have no idea how to do it but in a panic at his impending death i just reach my hands out and with a wail i simple break reality in half and walk through.&nbsp; his body is lying 20 feet from me on the ground, there are figure all around him holding him and crying.&nbsp; they look up in fear at my doorway which i look around me and see is made of the deepest darkness to ever possibly exist.&nbsp; it seems to pull in all light around it and crush it to nothing.&nbsp; they look confused as they focus on what seems to be between my eyes and i step from the darkness and run to his side.&nbsp; they look at me and plead with me, begging me to ""give it back""&nbsp; i pick up his head and can see my reflection in his eyes, now mirrors.&nbsp; on my forehead is a tiny many pointed star.&nbsp;&nbsp; its his soul, and my ticket to being able to come home to this world whenever i like.&nbsp; i can see in my peripheral the beauty of the place, its ability to shift at my will into my every dream, but my eyes will not tear from his, now fractals again.&nbsp; i have no idea how to give it back to him, but i close my eyes and offer up anything at all and everything i am/i have/all existence to save him,&nbsp; ""to give it back"".&nbsp; i kiss him.&nbsp; with the kiss i can feel his life returning as he slowly moves into a sitting position with me.&nbsp; i didn't realize his horn was gone until i saw it reappear then.&nbsp; i wanted to touch it but he told me if i did it would erase my memory of dustin and i would be his forever.&nbsp; he holds my hands and won't let me touch it, i don' t know if i would have.&nbsp; i hear my name being called.&nbsp; dustin has awoken and has followed me into my darkness, my portal.&nbsp; the people around me look at me in terror and tell me he can't pass through the final membrane and will be lost there forever in darkness if i don't go after him and lead him home very quickly.&nbsp; the boy in my arms holds my hand to his chest, kisses it and somehow throws me backwards towards my doorway.&nbsp; i stop short and begin to backstep into it.&nbsp; he yells ""wait, on her forehead, its still there"" but i am already gone.
consumed in darkness, following dustins calls for me..&nbsp;&nbsp; a light suddenly floods the surrounding area, from my forehead is a horn of pure light,&nbsp; i move my hand over it, through it, nothing but warmth and a shifting glow around me.&nbsp; dustins arms fall around me and i walk with him attached to my side, back through my doorway entrance and back into our room.&nbsp; we fall back into bed and he is immediately asleep again, perhaps remembering none of this.&nbsp; just a dream of darkness with a single light in the middle,&nbsp; i think to myself.&nbsp;&nbsp; i sit up in bed.&nbsp; 

i reach my hand out,&nbsp; and ...&nbsp;&nbsp; i slice a small slit through the air,&nbsp; it appears but this time in light.&nbsp; i reach my hand through and his returns my grasp.&nbsp; i know i have no idea what this will mean.&nbsp; but i feel fullfilled.&nbsp; i let, go, slip away,&nbsp; wrap myself around dustin and when i fall asleep,&nbsp; i wake here,&nbsp; my hand still tingling in the strangest way.&nbsp; and the words come back into my head,
from what came within the darkness, became pure light.&nbsp;"

... to help...<br /><br />the car hood is hard and the hands holding mine behind my back are strong and cold.&nbsp; apparently if you see cops stop and you are trying to get help you are supposed to sit or stand still with your hands in sight,&nbsp; waving and walking quickly towards them is not the best of options.&nbsp; my shoulders feel like they are being torn back off my body and my nerve damage from surgery 3 years ago on the right side feels like its ripping open.&nbsp; what the hell just happened?&nbsp; they frisk every part of my body for weapons and start harassing me, asking me if i was throwing rocks at cars.&nbsp; ???&nbsp; what the fuck.????&nbsp; someone must have been pissed enough at my walking on the freeway to call me in i guess.. and to make up some bullshit story...&nbsp;&nbsp; i remember alot of pain and being thrown around.&nbsp; its kinda blurry even though it happened an hour ago.&nbsp; somehow, magically, i talked, cried and begged my way into not being arrested or taken down to the station like they said they were doing.&nbsp; i convinced them of my honesty and what was actually going on with the broken down car and also through begging not to take me to the station but to drop me off at a gas station on hegenburger road. somehow they agreed, drove me around looking for dustins car for a bit as well.. &nbsp; i go into the jack in the box next door, plug my phone in after trying several eletrical sockets to find one that worked and call dustin.&nbsp; <br /><br />he is at the tire place.&nbsp; AAA took my number anyways and helped him. <br />""i am stuck at this jack in the box on hegenburger, i tried to rescue you, now i am stuck and need a rescue please""<br />""i don't know if this tire place is going to have my tire,&nbsp; if not i am ditching it and catching a ride to the show in chico with another band coming through here and then i won't be able to help you, i have to go and talk to the tire people, will call back""<br /><br />............................<br /><br /><font size=""1"">faith<br /><br /></font>10 minutes of shock and feeling abandoned pass.&nbsp; i realize still that this could just be a misunderstanding.&nbsp; he calls back, the tire is fixed and he is coming to get me, somehow he finds his way.&nbsp; the first thing i ask in the car of course is about what he said on the phone..&nbsp; was he really going to ditch me there if he couldn't get the tire?<br />""what else could i have done?""<br />used your credit card on a taxi?&nbsp; asked that band picking you up to come take me home real quick?&nbsp; asked someone for a ride?&nbsp; fucking reassure me in any way at all that you give a shit?&nbsp; <br />was it semantics?&nbsp; miscommunication? <br />i am met with hostility to my question.<br />somehow 30 minutes later i am being convinced that there is no way he would have just left me there but that he was under alot of stress.&nbsp; this is 100% believable to me.&nbsp; logically not just emotionally.&nbsp; i know dustin.&nbsp; ... i think.&nbsp; we sit in the parking lot for another 20 minutes.&nbsp; 20 minutes he should be rushing to this show...&nbsp; i am never given the emotional reassurance or sensitivity i ask for (and in clear direct words too) but i am given love and finally a thank you for what i went through for him.&nbsp; but the blame is still there and its laid in my lap. shifted if you want a lame pun babe.&nbsp; its my fault for being hurt because i didn't have faith in him.&nbsp; <br /><br />faith.&nbsp; <br />he asks me to have faith in him, that he will never let me down, he asks for faith.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;"

"event","my friend that accompanied me from cali to jax is needing a place to stay until the 27th anywhere from jacksonville to orlando (closer to orlando the better).  she is catching a ride to the rainbow gathering from o-town after that but i gotta hit the road a little sooner most likely so if anyone wants to lend a couch they would be doing me and her a favor.  she's a really sweet kid, honest and smart to boot.  doesn't steal or anything else creepy and usual of most rainbow kids so give a bed.
if you can, contact us asap, my feet are getting itchy to get back to the road."

"event","i am just an experience.  
but why i was robbed my death of cancer, my ""glory death"" so to speak, i still ponder over.  i just wanted a neatly wrapped package in life.  an introduction, a theme, a peak and a grand finale.  i struggled so long with the idea of being an experience but in the end i really had made peace with it.  i was ready to let go of consciousness and meat prison and move into the beyond.  i was even happy for it, the kind of happy at the end of the 6th star wars but then my life had to go and try to make 1 through 3 later.   a piece of crap i tell you.  granted my 1-3 come after but in the same way i am much less mature and under developed.  i jump at the slightest irregularity in my body.  panic attacks day in and out.  i am scared of my own shadow these days.  i am scared to ride bart because it leans when it turns.  i am scared to ride greyhound for fear it will careen over the edge of the freeway,  scared of planes falling burning from the sky and most of all scared of some completely out of control solar occurrence that would devour the universe in an instant like in my dreams.
i think about people alot.  sometimes i spend whole days dwelling on just one individual like an obsessed ex lover.  i'm sure everyone on this friends list has been in that spot in my brain before even if i have never met you.  i just do that.  i still remember kenita sensario the girl in elementary school that everyone made fun of and i tried to play with but only if no one else was looking.  i think about her all the time and i barely said two sentences to her.  everyone else is just multiplied by how much time i've spent around them.  there was a boy i had a crush on named levi whitney i ran into once in the last 10 years after going to middle school with him,  i've daydreamed up an entire world of possibilities for that kid.  he was this genius boy who i consider a friend to this day except that no way does he remember even my name.. phillip, currently my partner in life, reminds me so much of him its ridiculous.  if you can imagine how vividly those two still are to me, can you imagine how often YOU must be swimming through my thoughts?  thom hipp do you ever check up on this?  i am sure not.  i miss your southern accent fiercely.  i guess my obsession with you as a person in general was too much a burden really. a couple of the jax furs that brightened my last trip home didn't even remember who i was much less my name.. 
my curse of being an experience is probably shared when it comes down to it.  all of us blips intersecting when the equation goes that direction and fading away with distance.  
i just want to be thought about when i am gone.  what a selfish wish.  my wrist was hurting so bad a few minutes ago but i ""cured"" it with the last of my cure. going to be a rough few days and i deserve every bit of it.  why the fuck am i so sappy?  does anyone/everyone else get so stuck in their past?  i even miss my exhusband right now.  
if you ever wonder if anyone thinks you are incredibly important to them,  moreso than their ""happiness today"" (which is rare), please consider this obsessive, anxious, washed up, ex junkie, ex jacksonville hot shot and know i still really fucking love you. every last god damn one of you like you were my here-now.  live happy folks, live long and strong and fill it up with the richest flavors you can get ahold of.  and if anyone needs me for anything at all, just let me know.
the party is off, it was just a desperate attempt to hold on to a fullfilling past i haven't been able to duplicate ever again. 

i love you
my hands are being a bitch and paining me so fuck off.  


you guys ARE NOT just experiences to me, you are dear friends who i still remember vividly to this day and will never forget. thank you."

"event","FUCK MY BRAIN.  since the surgeries remembering certain (large significant) events is very difficult, especially when remembering a name is involved.  my boyfriend at the time of my surgeries showed me a movie that i damn well have been trying to remember the name of for about 4 hours.  i have looked up every possible conbination of details i can remember to no avail.  so here is my need from YOU:

NAME THIS FUCKING MOVIE:

a guy has a psycho ex that wrecks with him in her car on purpose and she dies but he gets a burn on his face and has plastic surgery.  he finds the love of his life when he wakes up drunk in a puddle (some girl from a bar he never actually met but idolized before ""death"") but when they are in bed she starts to turn into the girl that was originally the psycho ex and he flips out.  he ends up in jail because he ties her up and finally he figures out he is in a program preserving him because he died or almost died and the program is on the fritz and so becoming a nightmare.  his burn on his face starts coming back and he decides somehow to call the techies of the dreamworld he is stuck in and the tech tells him he can escape this world and come live in the future if he jumps off the skyscraper they are at the top of.  the guy does it and thats the end..  something to do with clouds?  for some reason i can think of the names eternal sunshine spotless mind and eyes wide shit..  as if its a combination of both of those movies but i know its a REAL FILM.  i just have little memory of that period of time.   

OH FUCKING WOMBAT BALLS TELL ME THE NAME OF THIS MOVIE BEFORE I GO NUTS.

its a newer movie if that helps.. maybe 2004"

""god""'s birthday gift to me was realization of personal choice.  i started using the word ""i"" again in my journal years ago as an attempt to reintegrate sense of self,  but it wasn't until now that i started using the word ""i"" in my own personal thoughts.  using the word i does not claim ego in this temporary human meat shell, nor does it overlay my own image on the sensory input taken in moment to moment existence as i thought it did.  all the word ""i"" has done is taken away my excuse for being an asshole to myself."

doc rupert you told me to tell them all (warning me of the losses that will quickly accrue)  and i believe in you.  you said it was the beginning of the path to healing and i will know i am on the way once i find myself doing it.  doc rupert when you appeared from the face of the fire i knew i believed and your gift was my own life back.  my realignment to myself.
i have decades of burningman to pour into here but for now i cannot expend that energy.  what needs to fit here instead is this short event.

after you appeared from the focus of the firelight, i knew.  i ran through the temple fire 4 times that night for the four issues deforming me.
the first time for the death of my heart, the second for the death of my faith in my friends, the third to purify the heroin in my veins and the fourth to reopen my third eye which i had sewn shut since my hospitalizations and drug addiction.   my forehead sank into the dust afterwards and the visions began.

i chanted to krishna when the withdrawals began, and they immediately disapearred.  

i am not going to fear you if you are hearing this for the first time.  i am not going to fear your loss though i would mourn it.  i am not going to fear anything you could do to hurt me BECAUSE i have hurt myself worse than you EVER can.  no one could do to me what i have done.

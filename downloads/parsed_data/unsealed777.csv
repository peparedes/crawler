if i could figure out why rage ruins me i would figure out world peace
only to run brings more pain that comes like a deep wound that blood will ozze out and even when it  stops more is still inder there waiting
oh god if i agree what damage will wait for me?"

my mind corupted with heartless beings

sharp daggers of mindless indulgence pierce in to the flesh of reality

like a child in a fake fantasy punchinh holes in a wall of reality

My favorite song came on(when the world falls down) when jereth falls in love with sarah and dances with her a a very romantic and lovable ballroom scene and all the while this song in the background was being sung. I really loved the meaning of this love song....read it and see what meaning it holds for you...


1 there is such a sad love, deep in your eyes
a kind of pale jewel, open and closed within your eyes
i will place the sky within your eyes

2 there is such a fooled heart beating so fast, in search of new dreams
a love that will last within your heart
i will place the moon within your heart

3 as the pain sweep through makes no sence for you, every thrill has gone 
was not too much fun at all
and i will be there for you when the world falls down..

4...it is falling..
falling..
falling in love...

5 i will paint you mornings of gold
i'll spin you valentine evenings, though we are strangers 'till now
we are choosing a path between the stars
i willl lay my love between the stars..

repeat of 3 and 4"

"event","The last month or so has been insanely busy. I've been pretty bogged down for the most part with work and appointments. Three more treatments until my laser hair removal is complete! Really excited about that. 

I have met a new friend to hangout with in the area. Technically, he is still about a forty minute drive one way to hangout, but it's definitely nice to have someone local who I can hangout with once a week or two. I met him on OkC, actually. I don't really use the website for dating, but most of the people who I run into are interested in predominately dating. T and I aren't really dating, but we're feeling that out a bit. I think we both know that any interest in the other beyond friendship would just be physical. We're both using the other as a distraction from our own personal current heartbreaks. And that's okay. It's nice to have a distraction when you're trying to get over someone. It helps takes the edge off, even if it doesn't help a great deal. It's a reminder that others can still want you. 

I have always found that they're are two types of people...those you naturally fall for and love right off the bat, and those you grow to love. The two times I've really had my heartbroken was from men in the first category. The second, I've always seen as the safe choice...while, I love them...they don't tend to devastate me emotionally if things don't work out. So T would be a safe choice for my heart right now. He's a nice friend, but he's not someone I've just fallen for. 

Someone abandoned a kitten at the store the other day, and one of the associates agreed to take it. T and I had dropped by the store because I had forgotten something and he was enamored with the little guy. So when the coworker decided yesterday that she couldn't keep it after all, because they were moving and finding a new place with a cat would be too hard...I texted T and he immediately agreed to foster the cat until we could find him a home. So I bought the basics it would need and went with him to pick the kitten up. He's only had one pet (his current cat who is 14) so he is being a worrywort about Milo hissing and hiding from the kitten. It's kinda adorable how much he worries and dotes on the little guy. 

The laptop that I bought back in March seems to have a bad harddrive. So it is being mailed off to the company for them to correct the issue. So I'll be without a decent laptop for a week or two. Hopefully, they'll be quick about it. Next week is my busy extra days week at work, so I wouldn't have time to hangout much on the computer anyways, but being without a computer is still a pain."

"event","Something I try to do every day is read the news before and after work. I've always found it relaxing, and it's good to keep up with what's going on in the world. The one story that really caught my eye and caused my blood pressure to instantly spike was <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/10/us-hepatitis-gilead-phrma-idUSBREA391I220140410"">http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/10/us-hepatitis-gilead-phrma-idUSBREA391I220140410</a> . Pretty much, a new drug that cures 90 percent of people infected with hepatitis. The price tag the company is selling the treatment for? $1,000 per pill, 84 pills per course of treatment over 12 weeks, which means $84,000 per patient. The price justification? 'Overall, patients will be spending less over their lifetimes treating this illness. So it will be a net gain for patients and insurance companies.' The logical behind that reasoning makes me sick. I suppose we should start slapping ridiculous price tags on vaccines too. Vaccines have been great at combating illness that can leave lifetime effects on sufferers. So, the price tag on them should be fairly cost prohibitive by that reasoning. Exploitation for profit, especially when it comes to a person's health makes me furious. I have always considered health and health care a basic human right, regardless of socioeconomic status, or ability to pay. I have never thought it was right to have a system that profits off of denying ill people treatment. Or having a tiered system that only provides the best service to the wealthy. 

The American healthcare system and drug manufacturers have always struck me as inherently unjust. I will readily agree that it costs a lot of money for companies to research, test, and then manufacture new drugs, but that does not justify the price tags they tack on. Monetary profit should not outweigh the human cost and need. I have always personally believed that there should be a cap on profit. Maybe double the cost of the process in the first five years, and then have a set price (x times actual cost of manufactoring) after they hit that 2x cost. If they hit that profit mark before the five year mark then they lose their patent and generics can be made. I'm not really proposing that particular solution, all I know is that the astronomical cost and profits is a serious issue. Personally, I applaud India every time I see them deny patents to drugs whose costs are extremely prohibitive, and allowing other drug manufactures to create generics at a reasonable price. The large companies usually scream, but then they are first in line to run their clinical trials in the country because of it's lax requirements."

"event","Not much is going on here. I signed up for two extra days at the third shift job this week...turns out I won't really be getting any extra days at all. Apparently, they are closed starting Thursday at 11PM and reopen Sunday at 11PM. So I will miss my Friday and Saturday nights there. Boo on the loss of money (because I do need it), but it will be nice to have a weekend semi off, especially since Casey will be in town. I am not telling my manager at my other job either. Right now she has me on a light weekend (very rare), where I only work four hours on Saturday and four on Sunday. She'll definitely increase me to working longer hours as I usually work eight both days anyway. Going to talk to my shift supervisor at work tonight as well about full time. If I am hired on full time there and worked the same hours I did between the two jobs now, I'd be making $1000 more a month after taxes. Which, I really need. The current schedule is just murder on my health and happiness. At least if I was still working the same hours, it'd be the same hours every day instead of my current work and sleep insanity. By the end of the weekend, I subsist on sugar and caffeine."

"event","Saw this on <lj user=""justphoenix"" />'s profile and I responded. The goal is to name ten movies that start with the letter they give you. She has kindly gifted me with the letter D. I figured most of my movies would be from the 80's, 90's, or early '00 as I rarely watch movies as an adult. I watch plenty of documentaries, but rarely a feature movie. I was drawing a blank on movies starting with a D, so I sought out a list.

In no particular order of actually liking:

1. Daddy Daycare
2. Dare Devil
3. The Dark Knight
4. Dark Shadows
5. Dumb and Dumber
6. Dude, Where's My Car?
7. Drag Me to Hell
8. Despicable Me.
9. Date Night
10. Date Movie

I was really reaching on the list. The only ones I can remember actually enjoying was The Dark night and Despicable Me. Most of the others were goofy or just bad. I remember beginning to watch Drag me to Hell with the first ex, and he had to turn it off when the old lady tried to 'gum' the main character to death. It just grossed him out way too much. Eventually finished that movie by myself months and months later. 

So if anyone is interested in doing the same. Just comment and I'll toss you a letter for your movies."

"event","I tend to watch pretty much anything documentary related when I have a free moment or when I am going to sleep at night. As a result I tend to run out of quality material and expand into the realm of pseudo science and crazy conspiracy theories. So the gem of the night, while I was eating, was a History Channel show. Sadly, the History Channel has really turned into crazy conspiracy theories and UFOs/Big Foot/Random Crazy Possibly Mythical Creature. So inline with that theme the show was, ""Secrets of UFO Vortexes,"" which was all about aliens being attracted to the Earth's ley lines and UFO hot spots. Apparently, there's something that the aliens know that we don't about these locations. So UFO spotter comes on talking about viewing the UFO and how the same object was regularly spotted in the area for the next five years. First thing that popped into my head, ""You would think that beings intelligent enough to conquer inter/intra-galactic space travel would have figured out cloaking devices by now."" Well, I was amused...."

"event","The day went pretty well overall. Valerie and I went and met up with Casey for lunch before coming back and haning out. We watched a few different shows and cut up the majority of the time. It's fun telling past stories and just reflecting on life. See who went where, and just talking about things and people I haven't thought about in years. It amuses me to think about how long ago middle school was. Really it hasn't been that long, right? Seven or so years...but it seems like an eternity. 

I suppose it vaguely disturbs me to see 'kids' I went to school with starting to settle down, marry, start families and really start 'home life'. The more I age the more certain I become that I'm not ready to start a family. Hell, I'm still in school and trying to find myself. I can't imagine trying to raise a kid right now. Kids are definitely a no go for a very long time.

For dinner we decided to go to Taco Bell, as Valerie loves it. Gotta say, the two dollar meal deals rock. Got my exusual of a chicken burrito which came with a medium drink and chips. First time I've had Taco Bell since I've been back. Not sure if my body is rejoycing for that or not, but my taste buds definitely agreed. Gonna try to keep it from creeping back into the diet."

Annoyed as hell. It never fails that Hollywood takes a perfectly good book and turns it into a hulking piece of crap jammed into a two hour time slot. If you are going to make a movie 'based' on a work, do it right. Make it something the fans will be proud of and will want to watch over and over again. Not something they eagerly await, pray that you don't screw up, go to the movie theater, and comes out ranting because you slayed the work. I'm actually glad that Ender's Game was canceled. As much as I want to see it, at least Card had enough balls to not sell out to Hollywood. He's waiting on someone to do it right. As a fan I appreciate that."

I remember spending hours playing with this. Tempted to go and look for the firetruck and pond. We were in the Pack Rat months ago and ran across them in the toy section. Really brought back memories of all the awesome and simple toys we had as kids. Afterward we went to a 'classic' toy store, but sadly they didn't really have 'classic' toys. They did have a lot of cool 'puzzle' toys I would have loved as a child."

My mom had the day off since her doctor was out of town. We took the opportunity to go hiking in the mountains (me, mama, and Rob). It was nice overall...the trail was dry and easy to walk on. Usually Rob and I go to Boone to hike and the trails are much more steep and muddy. Operation Fatten Andrea Up is still in motion apparently, after we picnicked we drove and got ice cream.

If I could get rid of one emotion it would be disappointment. Disappointment is always the root cause of all the sadness in my life. Whether the disappointment is caused by my own actions or the the actions of others,I feel I would be better off without it. I usually have pretty low expectations for people...keep your expectation low and it's hard to be disappointed. Sometimes people prove you wrong and you are unexpectedly delighted with the outcome. Other times you let yourself hope that this one time, this one person will live above those low expectations, only for them to dash your hopes. It's the times when you let yourself be optimistic that the disappointment hurts so much. It'd be nice not to have that emotion, just not to care."

About Protectors...

You're a cold-hearted bastard, plain-and-simple. You always jump into everyone elses' lives and try to ""save"" them, whatever that means. OK, that's not true at all, but that is how many others see Protectors. Sucks, but true.

First off, you're not at all cold-hearted. Sure, you're not the most outgoing of people, but those close to you know a much more outgoing, fun side of you. You also don't try to ""save"" people. You just worry about others and want to make sure people are taken care of. You're big on safety and security. It would be nice to get more credit for the good you do, but you know there's more to it than the attention and glory.

You're big on work -- hard work and commitment. Understandable, given that taking care of people is not something to be taken lightly. Others might see you as a bit of a bore though. I say screw them. You know what's important, and you should stick to it. Just don't judge others for not having that same ethic.. it's not a common thing, and you'll be happier if you accept that flaw in others.

Possible Careers: Doctor, Insurance Agent, Conservationist 

Here these thinkers ponder the apparent chaos of the world in order to extract from it the universal truths and principles that can be counted on. These principles, once extracted, will provide the logical structure on which to build strategies.

They have a finely nuanced ability to analyse situations, find root causes and foresee consequences. They distrust action taken too quickly without the necessary investigation. They are usually levelheaded, objective, impersonal yet intensely involved in problem solving. They are fiercely independent, seeking input and comments from a chosen few. When reporting to others, they need to establish credibility first: their own and that of the person they are reporting to. If the gap in knowledge and expertise is too great and their own proficiency dismissed, belittled or ignored, they will lose interest and motivation.

They are less interested in running the world as they are in understanding it. They are curious and capable of explaining complex political, economic or technological problems, taking great pleasure in explaining all the factors and intricacies. They are rigorous with their thoughts and analysis, choosing the exact words that convey precisely what is meant. They may spend a lot of time defining words, concepts and systems in order to define a problematic solution.

They are armchair detectives, scientists and philosophers, spending most of their time in quiet reflection to ponder truth, and solve mysteries. They may tend to neglect social requirements and responsibilities, finding many relationships to be too superficial to be of much interest."

"event","I got a call from the Principal of East Valley HS (Spokane) today on our way home from shopping and I've got an interview at 9:00am next Wednesday.  I'm considering this my ""first"" interview of the season because my true first interview was, as the VP put it, a legal formality so they could hire their long-term sub on to a continuing contract.

The Principal seemed like a great guy on the phone.  Very personable, could remember information off my application...sounded like someone who might just re-key the school over break to mess with the teachers.  He also was able to shed some light on the job that wasn't in the posting.  It's only 3 periods of HS per day with some elementary band in the afternoon.  It sounds pretty tempting."

NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND---The Football Version

1. All teams must make the state playoffs and all MUST win the championship. If a team does not win the championship, they will be on probation until they are the champions, and coaches will be held accountable. If after two years they have not won the championship their footballs and equipment will be taken away UNTIL they do win the championship.

2. All kids will be expected to have the same football skills at the same time even if they do not have the same conditions or opportunities to practice on their own. NO exceptions will be made for lack of interest in football, a desire to perform athletically, or genetic abilities or disabilities of themselves or their parents. ALL KIDS WILL PLAY FOOTBALL AT A PROFICIENT LEVEL!

3. Talented players will be asked to workout on their own, without instruction. This is because the coaches will be using all their instructional time with the athletes who aren't interested in football, have limited athletic ability or whose parents don't like football.

4. Games will be played year round, but statistics will only be kept in the 4th, 8th, and 11th game. It will create a New Age of Sports where every school is expected to have the same level of talent and all teams will reach the same minimum goals. If no child gets ahead, then no child gets left behind. If parents do not like this new law, they are encouraged to vote for vouchers and support private schools that can screen out the non-athletes and prevent their children from having to go to school with bad football players."

"event","So I started my training for my new job.  Mostly how to buy stuff and pay people.  Lots of websites to bookmark and forms to fill out.  I'll be going over budgetting and travel for the rest of the week.  It doesn't sound too amazing compared to teaching, but I feel a lot better sitting behind a desk than I do at a school right now.

If you haven't heard, there was a school shooting today in Tacoma at Foss HS.  That's the stadium you can see on your way to the bridge towards Bremerton/Silverdale.  I hate hearing about them because I have taught and intend to teach again.  This one took place less than an hour from where I lived and taught last year and that is the closest one to me since the Moses Lake shooting my first year at WSU.

This is one of the millions of things they don't train you for and makes you want to go find a nice desk job where hundreds, if not thousands of emotionally/hormonally unbalanced teenagers are far, far away.  They busted some kids last year in Silverdale who had guns and a 'plan' for another one of the schools in our district.  That too got me thinking about my career path. 

I love teaching and helping kids make music, but is it safe for me to do for the next 30 years?  The odds are in my favor that I could start teaching again in August or September and never be at a school with a shooting before I retire.  However, it takes one whackjob kid getting dumped, being cut from a team, failing a class, etc to change all that."

They said it years back when Qwest Field, then called Seahawks Stadium, was in the design stages:&nbsp; Everything about the architecture of the interior that stadium was designed to focus the crowd noise between the hashes.&nbsp; You can stand at the middle of that field and hear someone buying a beer in the back row of the upper deck, but you can't hear the person standing next to you.&nbsp;

1. The ""real"" interview.  They bring in the best and most qualified candidates and make them show why they should get the job.  This was the CK High and Auburn-Riverside interviews last year.

2. The ""type"" interview.  They bring in the best and most qualified candidates and pick the one that fits the mold made by the exiting director.  A jazzer for a jazz school, marching guy for a competitive marching school, etc.  This was WF West, West Valley, Ashland, and KSS interviews.

3. The ""BS"" interview.  They have someone in mind before the job is posted.  Then they bring in people as highly qualified, if not higher, than their pick and go through the motions to make everything look good to the powers that be.  This was Hanford.

I've got an interview Monday at Curtis HS in University Place.  I think it will fall into category 1.  I couldn't find any articles on their amazing jazz band or scores for their marching band.  They have a great athletics program and maybe they focus on pep band.  It's the good part of Tacoma and I'll be interested to hear about the school and the music program.  I've got other applications out to Lake Stevens and Kent, with another going out to Bellevue tomorrow.

My approach hasn't changed too much from last year.  I'm applying for almost the exact same types of jobs.  The main difference is I'm a little more careful about the area.  I don't want Jen to have to be away from Science for too much longer.  If I get to do what I love, so should she.  For us, the worst case scenario will be moving back to the Tri-Cities with me subbing and her getting back into science.  I'd be able to get picked up by an area high school marching band for their staff with my background and then I could just bide my time until we can find a more permanent solution."

"event","...and I've already had one interview.  I took a nice little drive down I-5 this morning to Chehalis to interview at W.F. West HS for their band position.  I think the interview went well.  I hit it off with the directors at the feeders and the choir director.  If anything is going to be counted against me, it'll be the fact that I'm not a 'jazzer', but I responded to the ""jazz background question"" quite nicely.  For those of you wondering where you've heard the name W.F. West HS before, that's where Kyla works.

I'm sad to leave Klahowya and I'll be clearing the rest of my junk out this weekend.  I wanted to be out today, but I was on the road and in the interview.  I'm leaving things just a little better than I found them and I don't just mean the band room.  They're started on the path to be a balanced and strong music program; I just hope they get there.  

From the emails that went out on the last day of school, there's a lot more teachers leaving the school that I thought.  Some came right out and expressed their dissatisfaction with the district/school/admins.  I understood many of their frustrations.  I really feel like the job they told me to do and the job they expected me to do were two different things at times.

I'll be spending the weekend and most of the week by myself while Jen's in Yakima with her mom.  I'll be waiting for phone calls and decompressing from the school year.  I offically start sleeping in tomorrow.  Finally."

My Percussion Ensemble performed at the State Solo & Ensemble contest on the 28th.  They did well, but didn't get a I.  However, it was the best I've heard them play since the regional contest, so I was happy.

The marching band went to Wenatchee last weekend for the Apple Blossom Festival Parade.  We finished 1st in the AA division.  So much for the ""four-peat"" of sweepstakes for Klahowya, but we're still getting hardware and I'm ever so proud of those kids.  They marched and played right up to our buses, about a half-mile more than any other band.

We're definitely in the mad dash to June 21st at KSS.  We've started getting our end of the year paperwork and we're prepping for graduation and various awards ceremonies.  It'll all be over too soon.  I'm going to miss the seniors.  They were a great bunch of kids."

We had 21-33 minute classes the rest of the day, which sucks for me.  By the time my 7th graders were warmed up and we did the work in the method books, it was almost time to pack up.  Not a good way to get the percussion ensemble ready for state and the marching band ready for Wenatchee.

I had the distinct honor of being a scribe for a kid with an IEP.  My job was to write down anything she said...not the correct version of what she said.  As scribes we were also allowed to read the questions to our students, as long as it wasn't the reading portion of the test, but that still didn't do much good.  It's very hard to look at a math problem, know the answer, and have to write down a wrong answer.  It'd be great if we could report back to our student's math teacher and tell them what the student is struggling with."

To make matters worse, we had the Academic Achievement Assembly today.  If you had a 3.5 or higher Fall Semester, you got out of 1st period and KSSR and got to be recognized and have breakfast.

Base their salary on their Free Throw Percentage.  

Kobe Bryant shoots around 85% at the charity stripe this season.  For one of the marquee players in the league, that is unacceptable.  This is a player that young kids try to emulate on the playground and in high school gyms across the country, but he can't do one of the easiest parts of the game.  He can dunk, make acrobatic shots, and three-pointers with 2 defenders in his face and those actions earn him $15.9M per year.  If he knew that by shooting 85% at the line would only earn him 85% of that, wouldn't he probably work on it more and shoot in the high 90's?  He's #17 in free throws, but #11 in pay.  

Shaq, another of the icons of the modern NBA makes $20M per year.  He is a career 53% free throw shooter.  Yeah, you put all 325 pound of him under the rim and he'll send guys to the hospital and score points, but come on.  There's a reason teams used to use the ""Hack-a-Shaq"" defense.  The odds are in your favor to only give up half the points you normally would.  And you know what?  I think until he remembers what fundimentals are, he only deserves to make half the money.

Some of the other top paid players:
Chris Webber: $19.1M - 75%
Micheal Finley: $18.6M - 84%
Kevin Garnet: $18M - 81%
Stephon Marbury: $16.4M - 74%

Players with 90+% FT%*:
Steve Nash: 92.3 - $9.6M	 
Peja Stojakovic: 91.4 - $7.6M 	 		 
Chauncey Billups: 90.3 - $5.9M
Salim Stoudamire: 90.0 - $675,000 

What kind of message is the NBA and it's fans sending to college and high school players?"

We have 29 when everyone's there.  The adjudicator had lots of good comments.  Most of it was stuff I've said to them before, but since it came from someone else maybe it'll sink in.

I should have stayed home on Tuesday, but I realized that I felt like crap at about 6:15.  Too late to call in sick.  I stuck it out yesterday to get some quality rehearsal time in.  And, well, I couldn't very well be sick the day of the concert.  I'm still sick.  Tomorrow will be day five.  I'm hoping that now that the stress of this concert is over, my body will start to recover.

Our concert went quite well.  It was what they call the Westside District Band Festival, so it was with my 2 feeder schools' 6th grade bands.  They played well, but there's no low brass in the group so I'll be switching some kids next year.  My 8th graders played Country Gardens and Irish Tune From County Derry our of Frank Erikson's ""A Percy Grainger Suite"".  They did well, but I had 5 kids out for various reasons.  My high schoolers played Robert W Smith's ""To The Summit"", which was a commissioned work by Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma.  It's pretty cool and they're starting to actually interpret the music and do some really nice things with it.  We also did the cheesiest thing we've played all year:  a Disney medley.  The percussion didn't have much of a clue, but that's pretty typical."

"event","We had our second power outage of the year today.  The wind was gusting and it was just plain nasty out.  Three transformers blew up and we were without power when I showed up to the school.  We started the day because, ""If you start, you don't have to make it up.""  Well, we went 3 hours without power on emergency lights.  And then about 2 or 3 minutes into the period that probably would've been the last of the day, the power came on.

The thing that pisses me off about this whole situation is:
1. We have no set policy for power outages.  KSS (and our two feeders) is in the boonies and can be without power while the rest of the district is just fine.  We need to say, ""If the power is out at X minutes before school, there is no school.""  We've run at about a 10-15% absence rate during both outages.

2. You cannot teach band at KSS during or after a power outage.  It took until 6th period for kids to finally accept that we were going to still have class.  Both my high school classes just complained and were unfocused the whole period.  My 7th graders couldn't rehearse because the sun wasn't up yet and only about 25% of my room had enough light for kids to read music.  In percussion class, I had kids holding flashlights so others could see their music.  It's stupid.  I'd rather just not see the kids instead of them being all crazy from a power outage.  It'd be a better excuse for a wasted rehearsal.

I don't know who to bring this up to, but somebody has got to say something.  We've had two power outages that should have resulted in a cancellation so far.  Both times, my day would have been better spent tightening the stands and washing the whiteboard.  The policy of, ""You've got windows.  The sun will be up at about 7:45."" doesn't work in my room and is a bit ridiculous.  Do I want the kids to be sent home because I want a day off?  No.  Do I want school to be canceled because they're putting us in an environment that will basically sabotage our lessons and cause endless frustration?  Yes."

And like last year, we'll be punctuating the trip with the final regular season home game for the Seahawks.  When I bought the tickets in August, I thought it'd be a fun distraction to go see a pre-season Super Bowl lock play our underappreciated little 'Hawks.  Well, it looks like it's turned into the biggest game of the season:  The two best teams in the NFL squaring off late in the season among rumors of a Super Bowl preview.

Not really surprised by the stuff I heard about the chapter and band.  Saw Rob Simpson and his posse across the court from us, but couldn't get his attention (and I forgot to add him to my new phone).  We also had a nice chat with Leslie from Marketing after the game.  It was nice to hear that I am missed by somebody at WSU.  Apparently Athletic Marketing holds me in high regard as far as band TAs goes.

"event","OK, so everyone in the Seattle-area press has to footnote their articles with, ""...and the Cougars classlessly celebrated on the poor, dejected Huskies' 'W' at midfield.""  You know what?  FUCK THEM!  They had it coming ever since 2000.  They did it then when they beat us 51-3 and did it again in 2002 prompting the bottle throwing.  Granted they were coached by someone with infinitely less class than Ty ""I can't smile"" Willingham at the time (and that asshat probably told them to do it), but those Husky players should've known it was coming and that they deserved every second of it.  

Then ""Ol' Smiley"" gets on TV and says that ""there's no place for that in college football.""  Get off your fucking cross.  You know had you won that game in Pullman, your kids would've done the same damn thing.  If you want to be treated with respect, how about you show a little first.  And not just on the field.  Start by giving WSU fans seats equal in quality and quantity that UW fans get in Pullman.  Start by keeping Don James out of the media the week of the game when he does nothing but call Cougar fans (and all of Eastern Washington) a bunch of uneducated, inbred, hicks.  Maybe even shoot Brad an email and have him tell his TAs and drum majors that it's classless, to the level of USC, to play on penalties."

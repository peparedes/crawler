love song for my sister
born like magic 
slowly she danced with peace

fast rain talks of home

who told of his end
imagened light pull together"

Now for some Quotes: 
-'How do you know? Loving God isn't any different from loving man- or a child. It's want to be with Him, to be near Him.' He made a hopeless gesture with his hands. 'It's wanting to protect Him from yourself'-
-he had begun to forget that it would ever be another day, just as one forgets that one will ever die. It comes suddenly on one in a screeching brake or a whistle in the air, the knowledge that time moves and comes to an end.-
-Nobody really knew how long a second of pain could be. It might last a whole purgatory.-
-Dance first. Think late. It's the natural order.- Charles Baudeliare
-Dancing can reveal all the mystery that music conceals- Halyley
-Today is onlyone day in all the days that will ever be, but what will happen in all the other days that will ever come can depend on what you do today.- Ernest Hemmingway
-Love is not just something to do it's the moment that transcends our physical into the most spiritual level of understanding-
-Everything in life is temporary, because everything changes. That's why it takes great courage to love, knowing it might end anytime but having the faith it will last forever.-
-Le coeur a ses raisons que la raison ne connait pas-
-I would rather live in a world where my life is surrounded by mystery, than to live in a world so small that my mind could comprehend it- Henry Emerson Fosdick
-Tis a strange fate we should suffer so much fear and doubt over so small a thing. Such a little thing.-
-What hath god wrought- First telegraph msg.

"event","Putting this in here because my deadjournal won't update

So the end of my year ended on an interesting note. Many of my hallmates went fucking insane and about half of them are now either not speaking to me or hate me, including my RA. Its funny though because they are angry at me for my reaction to something they did to me. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense. They violated my trust, my property and many other things. These past few days have been at very least confusing. My parents were looking at new houses today out near my grandparent's house. Some of them were really amazing. I don't nknow why they don't just move if they want to, probably for the same reasons why my grandparents don't move, they want to talk about moving and play with the idea but probably won't do it for a long long time. On a different note i am still procrastinating in my work but thats ok i will get it in tomorrow and then i will start on putting away my clothes and other items aquired at college. A paculiar thing happened recently. Rosie imed me with concern for my well being over my away msg and journal. Didn't expect that. didn't know how to react to it either. Also amanda miller from gma has been texting me alot. nice girl. dunno why she is texting me but its all good. Speaking of gma i stopped by last thursday and picked up cathy. got coffee for her and rae and drove cathy home after chillin and listening to the melismatics. Then i went through the art room and a friend of cathy's asked me about rosie and why we broke up so once again i had to explain things. Looking back at the person i was with rosie and the life i lived i realize that i was not horribly different, i was just in a different situation. Also on that Thursday i came back so happy from GMA that i picked julie and jonnalyn and carlo up and we went to Kelly drive and chilled. Then came back and ate with Liz and other peoples. 

I am hoping to get all my stuff put away this week, see Troy, visit and hang out with friends and start lessons perhaps. 

On a different topic of news one of the more confusing part of my last few days has been a girl. ::gasp:: i know isn't that out of the blue. well not really but whatever. So there have been a few girls at nova that i have been interested in this year and for the most part nothing has come about from my interest partially because i know nothing will happen and partially because i have been advised to not persue things any further. There was one girl in particular though that i have known all year but never really thought about seriously till someone asked me if i liked her. At that point i had found her attractive but knew so little about her that i didn't really know if i had any interest. However i decided to get to know her a bit more because i realized she was a cool person. We have been talking.. alot...and we have chilled some at nova and things have been great from my end even though i am clearly a chickenshit. I eventually told her i had interest in her (i told her in the worst possible way) as soon as i was sure that i did have definate interest.  so like i said we saw alot of eachother and i felt like i was being all stalkerish even though i just was trying to give us a chance to talk. then we talked and i was cool with the resolution we came to. She called the next day. She missed me. great stuff. its good to feel missed. however now she is going to DC and won't be back till midjune. but thats ok we figured out that we will hang out then and see how things are without any stings attached and then move on from there. well tahts my life for the last couple of days. if anyone wants to chill or do anything give me a call or drop me an im. peace"

Cait and ME! The next picture would be a bit different.. you need to ask me for it though and visit because i refused to send them. I joked around before the formal that i should go in the dress and she should go in my suit. So half way through we switched. I looked both good and really bad. Cait just looked baggy. but i am editing that pic and taking privilage in not putting it up.

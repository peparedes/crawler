"event","I am faling further, and further into mad solitude. I have not been out of the basement for three weeks. Except at night, I like to go out around 3 in the morning. I go to the girls dorm and try to watch them sleep. But the evil Deans, Gestapo, or ""Security"" caught me the last two times. I barely escaped capture. Last time I was forced to jump onto the back of a beatup pickup truck. To my dismay the bucktoothed hillbilly driving the truck happened to pull over and discover me in the back with his hog ""Horace"". Well one thing led to another and he was initally angered because he thought I was trying to ""make time"" with Horace. Unpleasantness followed. Lets just say I went home that night with a rather sore, and sticky behind. How in the hell do these hillbilly's make it to the United Kingdom?! I have almost completed my napalm bomb, oh now that Dean will pay...oh yes. I have it all set out for the Gallahad Ball on thursday night. But now, I must spend quality time with my dear Cathleen. She exists only in my dreams, but she is more real than those GAP girls will ever be."

"event","Those insullent bastards caused the police to show up again, they almost found my stash of dynamite and thermite hidden behind the loose brick in the wall. But I distracted them by stabbing Brad in the toe with a rusty nail. Sure it got me a night in the pen, but Brad didn't press charges or anything, seeing as I threatened to pur liquied nitrodgen down his pants while he slept. I have take some nasty pictures of Dean Wurmer and the physics teacher getting real close in his office. Boy won't his wife be happy to see these!! Need coffee now, or rum...or both..."

"event","I woke up in my own vomit again, there weren't so many chunks this time..I haven't been eating much lately. Brad is having a huge party tonight to honor his becoming president of the student council board. So I put out the buckets to catch the spilled liquor as it leaks throught the floor cracks. It's getting colder down here in the basement. I pulled my back muscles from shivering last night, and they still want me to pull weeds from the garden today. I swear, when my plan all falls into place Delta Phi will get theirs along with the Churchill academic board...and that Dean Wurmer! May latest plan invloves a mongoose, some ducttape, and a mideval catapult. Though I'm not sure where I will get the catapault. The fools tried to infiltrate my lair(basement) again. But the electric wiring around the doorframe fended them off. They claim they were coming down to get some old Playboys. Yeah...right, like I'm gonna give up that treasure trove. Well I see the vomit is mixing with the spilled liqour, so I must go get the strainer and get to work..."

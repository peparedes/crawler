"event","I got my new journal, I'm more comfortable using that, I can have it with me all the time, write what i want, and not write it for an audience as oh so journals are now, just a personal web page that gets so tiresome, frankly i'm sick of reading over pointless entries by pointless people, so I'm not gonna bother anymore, I'll keep this thing open because well, I'm sure it will have a purpose at some point.

This post is a contradiction due to that it's slightly to an audience, but it's just to give information, not to make myself sound interesting, i.e. ""Me and kelly met up, kelly is my best friend with a really long pony tail and brown eyes."" That just pisses me off, you know who kelly is you moron, its your friend, no-one else cares, no-one could care less you fucking moron, shut up.

That's the only time I'm gonna rant to an 'audience' as it were.

Anyway, real journal now, real thoughts, no getting side tracked by an audience.

Bye.

(p.s. I'm not gonna be checking comments or reading other journals for the time being, it's come to the point where I'm spending 4 to 5 hours reading whats been going on in peoples lives the past week, when frankly it matters not. I fell behind, but i wanna stay there cos Magie is there and she keeps me away from this thing. Which is good cos it saves me from staying up all night and getting really bad back pains and unadmirable habits. If you really should need to contact me, email me, or call me. I'm trying to stay away from the pc as much as possible.)"

It's been kinda hectic round these parts lately. Magie is moving in, <b>BIG FUCKING YAY!!!!!!!!</b>

This is gonna be my first post that will be going in my memories section. She's moving in Thursday, I can't wait.

We had a gig last night, it was amazing, people were going nuts for us, it was great, people were skanking, moshin and jumping off the stage....and two guys got naked on stage and danced about. Freaks.

Then we smoked a 9 inch spliff, that was also amazing. Heh.

<i>Today</i>

Work was hard, but only for me, I worked so hard today I passed out, I was doing the work of 6 people, including the manager, supervisor and sales assistant. I just went dizzy and dropped, started off hyperventilating then just went dizzy n tingly then passed out. Did anyone care? No, they just kept going on telling me to do stuff cos they're too damn lazy and fucking annoying to do anything themselves. I'm not gonna rant because I don't wanna do that anymore, dwelling aint my bag maaaaaaaaan. I'm too cool for that. All I'll say is, people at work, are n00bs.

<i>back to last night,</i>

I seemed to make an impression on a few girls, which was odd, I mean, I thought girls only ever flirted BACK, but yeh, I was doing nothing and girls were trying it on, that was cool, but yeh, all I want is Magie.

I'm still trying to sort out how I'm gonna see magie over Christmas, I think I might go up there boxing day, or the 27th till after new year, which will of course mean the 2003 edition of my volume of new year parties (This would be the second) would be cancelled. Thing is, I think about it and I realise, I don't know half the people I used to know, and the people I do wouldn't show anyway as I've not played a part in their life enough yet. That also means, I don't want to invite them anyway cos they smell....

I dunno, I want to spend at least one of the holidays with her, It doesn't seem we'll get them both so I'm just gonna go for new years. In fact, it'll be really great to spend the start of a new year with her because 2003 is going to be us going through final stages of moving in together, so yeh, I duno, I just like the idea...."

I can't take this anymore and I'm almost pretty sure,
I've been here before.
I can't take this any longer, I wont heal until I'm stronger,
Strong enough to not be afraid.

Of what anybody thinks, or what anybody says,
About the way, about the way I am,
I'll wait until the day, when those feelings fade away,
Then I'll make my break...

I can't take this anymore and I'm almost pretty sure,
I've been here before.
I can't take this any longer, I wont heal until I'm stronger,
Strong enough to not be afraid.

I'll leave it up to you, yeh I'll leave it in your hands,
Respect your wishes and your demands,
If it was up to me,
Honey, we'd already be, back at home...

Living out her dreams, living out.....

Everybody, everything, never taught me how to stand up on my own,
Had to learn it from the one who let me go
Now I walk alone, I walk alone

Living blissfully,

Guess you have to step away,
Make me wanna be, a bigger man, a bigger man that that,
I need you by my side, as I take it all in stride,
I put away, I put away my pride

I'll leave it up to you, yeh I'll leave it in your hands,

"event","It's because I just cant talk any more, I don't know, I'm going through a weird period in my life, someone may have already noticed this by reading the amount of contradictions I've made in the past few months.

I'm not sure if I'm happy or sad anymore, I'm too busy nowadays to concentrate on how I feel. Last week I was feelings lost, this week, I'm looking to next week, the week before last week I just felt shit, I was still growing accustomed to working 6 days a week, it's been a year since I worked, now I'm back in the cycle and it's hard to get used to.

I spoke to clare all day yesterday, my business with her is over now, I'm now sure I feel nothing for her at all, there were times when I thought, ""why am I jealous of her being around other guys"" and I didn't understand it, but she was going on about her relationships and it was just like I was hearing anyone talk. I didn't care, hahaha I'm good.

Ocean's trying to pry her way into my life once more, I'm ok with that because I realised, she can't get to me anymore. I no longer feel nauseous from being around her, I still have a lot of hate and anger towards her in some ways, she still ruined my life and made me lose a person who meant a lot to me. I guess it was fate though. If I hadn't had broken up with Lee because of her, I wouldn't be where I am now, happier than ever with Magie.

I dunno about us though, I love her so much but god dammit being this far away is so damn hard. I know I rant about this every other post, but, she's still very far away, the best way to explain it would be I guess, it feels like I'm always out of breathe, struggling for air, my muscles ache and I just wanna lay down, then I get to see her and I feel like nothing ever before. It's funny how she'll never see me like this because as soon as she turns up, I smile again. 

Thinking like that gets me paranoid, like, what if people are different when I'm not around...I need to stop thinking.

I've always thought that. 

On a lighter note, skirtbox are playing next Saturday, I'm gonna really try n see em, I only got their CD a few days ago but I love em. Oh and apparently we're playing with Captain Everything in January. We'll see though, I cant see it happening.

Fate's a weird little thing, I'll never quite understand it, but I guess that's the whole point. Well anyway, I'm going to bed as I have to be up 7, it's now 1, I wont get to sit down till 8pm. Here we go again....."

"event","ok, I'm bored, so, this is what I'm gonna do.

I just put on some music and I realised that some songs just suit a scene so well. for instance,

Deftones - Be quiet and drive.

As soon as this starts up it sounds like a mood changing, it's sort of transitional. So, the scene would show something like the aftermath of a sudden event, like hearing about a death of a person. The music quickly picks up pace and you get the impression that the person this music relates to is quite quick in his/her actions and behaves on the matter quickly, sometimes without thought.

As the lyrics start, they slow down the pace to a degree which gives the image of the person planning for his/her next action, maybe, packing a bag, making phones, all rushed in his/her haste - resulting in the pace being kept in the music as well as the words. 

By the time the power in the music and words have risen, the character can be seen, either walking, running, or driving in a car, looking to be emotional, stressed and rather panicky. This is shown by the vocals become out of sync to the rest of the song, e.g. A kind of wailing being used, followed by the impression that the singer is crying and screaming into the microphone, which would be shown in the scene by the character being scared, angered, upset, even destroyed; inside.

The song quickly fades out from there, which would leave the character arriving at his/her destination, reaching a point where the mood then changes again.

This would also leave a chance for an end of scene, having that the song itself is five minutes long, this is a plentiful amount for a satisfactory scene length.

The rolling stones - Paint it black.

This was best used in ""The Devil's Advocate"", and is often best remembered for it. Not much other image is giving from it, possibly because I can only imagine the same story from that film. Oh well.

The weakerthans - Confessions of a futon revolutionist.

Incredibly long title, incredibly catchy song, very very quick, which is a large contradiction to the past two songs. Right away you can imagine fast, quick moving shots from many different camera angles, bright colours, happiness. I imagine a scene of a couple, holding hands, running, laughing, a kind of cheesy take on the romantic couple. Could almost be used as a comedic skit.

It, like, Be quiet and drive, has a great length for it's scene capacity. Which means, it would be possible to use the whole song, leaving for a range of scenes in it's quickly changing pace.

Bush - Greedy fly.

A calm start, almost tranquil, giving the impression in this opening scene, that someone is driving through a relatively lively, but over rated place - Las Vegas perhaps, feeling miserable, or on guard.

The music quickly changes to a busy atmosphere or even a panic stricken one. Maybe an attack has happened. I then get the impression of this scene being played to the Mafia, or a similar business/operation.

Again, the music then slows and quiets, leaving for a phone call to be received - the character being told about his upcoming health imposition. The phone is then disconnected and another strike is blown. 

The music then suddenly stops, giving the chance to show the effect of that attack. Possibly the injury sustained from the sudden impact from another vehicle.

Also there can be heard in the music a vehicles engine, revving over. This could be greatly used for the character trying to make their escape in desperation, also showing a quick reflection of his emotions, which is often needed to underline the actual theme in the scene.

Static X - Love dump.

By using samples in the start, you are already given a scene, a girl showing her disappointment for anothers actions. A bass line is then brought in, quite heavy, followed quickly by the other instruments. This music can only show one impression. Devastation and anger, towards a person. The impression is given that this woman has been hurt in such a way she cannot forgive. The words show that she is angered, disgusted at herself and depressed.

Not all of this piece would be needed as a scene like that wouldn't carry on for very long before the scene changed, unfortunately, the doesn't greatly, apart from the introduction to, what sounds to be a piano or organ melody. This could easily be associated to a character from a dark and possibly gothic background.

System of a down - DDevil.

This song is extremely short, but also extremely emotional. It's simply not possible to define a single scene to this piece as it's fast range of pace leaves almost unfollowable to follow through acting.

My best impression from this would be that this is for one single character, going through a kind of hallucination. All starting and ending in one minute 43 seconds. During this hallucination there would be seen, bright coloured objects behaving out of character, giving an air of fear through their movements.

As the music jumps quickly to almost a sort of solo with the power being reduced and only being left to the silence, you are given the impression of this victim of his own mind, being faced one on one with a particularly powerful manifestation, not knowing how to behave in this circumstance, he begins to feel insane and simply falls into an imaginary spiral.

Ok, TV's back on being good again, so I'm off to eat.

oh yeh, and in other news of me, I took a day off today.

Now you see why I write stories instead of my real life."

And that's just what they did, they sewed and they stitched all day long, and by 5 o'clock, they were done, they had made the biggest load of pants ever, that biggest load of pants ever somehow, between the factory and the clothes store, became my PC.

True story.

Life, it's a tricky business, you gotta plan it just right or you go ass over tit and its game over. I, currently am about to do a triple summersault before landing head first into a vat of shit. just kidding, life's ok if you take away the mind numbing routine of up at 7, work till, come home, sit, eat, TV, talk, sleep, up at 7, work.....

(wouldn't that be great kiddies, ask your parents for a rail gun for xmas. Tell em Chris said so. When they ask who Chris is, stand blankly for roughly 2 minutes until they forgot what they asked, then beat em upside the head with a 2 by 4. Learn em good.)

<b>Friday</b>

I'm sure something happened but I don't know what....Oh yeh, the gig.

It was ok I guess, I'm never happy with how I play on stage. It was ok, but I coulda done better.

Saw Ransom, he was pissed. *BIG SARCASTIC SURPRISED FACE*

Me n Magie had a big chat, we sorted everything out that was causing problems before, I apologised for basically being a cunt when I could have just kept quiet. We're much closer for it all. I dunno why, but before I never really realised how happy I'll be spending the rest of my days with her, I guess I always just thought relationships have to end. 

<b>Saturday</b>

First day of work, It was extremely tiring, but good in it's little way. My feet were so sore that once I got in and sat down, I literally couldn't walk. I don't know why, but the soles of my feet were so painful I couldn't even stand. It's ok now.

Oh and....I GOT VICE CITY!!!!

It's so fucking cool, the opening sequence is amazing, the missions are brilliant, the radio stations are great (VROCK has Slayer - Raining blood!!!), the vehicles are ace, shit, everything about it is amazing. Everyone who had it in the USA was bitching about glitches, but there aren't any, proving that R* did take out all the bugs. I was right, I rule, Vice rules. I'm gonna go play it now.

<b>Sunday</b>

I took Magie to the train station to go home. I hate letting her go. *WAH*

Back to the Academy tomorrow, I can't be bothered with it, I'd rather just go to work full time, I might do that actually. I'll see.
